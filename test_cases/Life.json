{"train": "\"LIFE\" \nScreenplay by \nRobert Ramsey and Matthew Stone \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. PRISON CEMETERY -- DAY \nA handful of people are gathered in an open field under a fierce Mississippi sun. A couple of young inmates, JAKE and LEON, lean on their shovels. They are waiting to bury two identical CASKETS with inmate numbers stenciled on the pinewood lids. \nA GUARD rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes a long, healthy pull from his canteen. He offers it to the PRISON CHAPLAIN, who is much obliged. SUPERINTENDENT BILL BURKE, a 40-year-old black man, glances at his watch and loosens his tie. Sure is hot. \nMARY HUMPHRIES, an elderly white woman in a nurse's uniform, stands behind WILLIE LONG, an ancient inmate sleeping peacefully in a wheelchair. She readjusts an umbrella to shield the old black man from the blistering sun. \nBurke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief. He gives the nod to the chaplain, who steps forward and cracks his bible. The men remove their hats. \nCHAPLAIN In accordance with the regulations of the State of Mississippi, we gather here today to lay to rest the remains of inmates R. Gibson, number 4316, and C. Banks, number 4317. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God have mercy on their souls. \nBURKE Go ahead, fellas. \nThe young inmates plunge their shovels into the dirt. One by one, the mourners head back toward a prison van parked on a nearby dirt road. \nNURSE HUMPHRIES I'll come back for you in a little while, Willie... \nShe leaves Willie alone with Jake and Leon. He rolls his chair up to the edge of the graves and gazes at the pinewood caskets. \nJAKE These two guys friends of yours, old man? \nWILLIE We spent some time together. \nLEON Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time. \nWILLIE I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932. \nLEON 1932? That's like, that's like... \nWILLIE Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys. \nWillie pulls a bottle of moonshine from his jacket and takes a swig in their honor. \nJAKE Hey, the dude's holdin'. \nLEON Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up. \nWillie passes the bottle to Leon, who takes a swig and winces from the unexpected kick. \nLEON Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday. \nJAKE I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files. (taking a swig from the bottle) Damn, that shit's nasty. \nWILLIE Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned. \nLEON What were they, bootleggers? \nWillie holds up the bottle, checking the clarity of the liquor. \nWILLIE Something like that. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nEXT. SPANKY'S BACK ALLEY (1932) -- NIGHT \nRAY GIBSON holds up a similar bottle of liquor to a light over a door. Music comes from within. He takes a swig and stashes the bottle in his belt. He adjusts his tie, polishes his shoes on the back of his pants and raps on the door. \nINT. SPANKY'S -- NIGHT \nThe speakeasy is jumping, jammed with people. Up on stage a hot JAZZ BAND is playing backup for a seductive CHANTEUSE. Well-heeled PATRONS enter through doors near the stage. \nIn the back, at the end of a long hallway, a BOUNCER cracks open the door and Ray squeezes inside. \nBOUNCER Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you. \nRAY Is Spanky here? \nBOUNCER No, but... \nRAY Then what's the problem? \nBOUNCER Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door. \nRAY But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now? \nOn his way into the Men's Room, Ray squeezes past the bag men on their way out. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nGlancing around, Ray spots Claude's feet under the stall door. He steps up to the sink, washes his hands and takes a towel from the ATTENDANT. Scanning the assortment of grooming products, he selects a bottle of cologne and takes a sniff. \nRAY (displeased) You have any of that French stuff? \nAs the attendent bends down to retrieve a bottle of the good stuff, Ray palms a coin from the tip basket. \nATTENDENT Here you go. \nRay offers the quarter, a gesture of uncommon generosity. \nRAY Keep the change. \nATTENDENT Why, thank you, sir! \nRay pats the cologne on his face. A toilet flushes and Claude steps over to the sink. Ray catches his eye in the mirror. \nRAY Don't I know you? \nCLAUDE I don't think so. \nRAY Sure I do. What's your name again? \nCLAUDE Claude Banks. \nRAY Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together. \nCLAUDE You went to Monroe? \nRAY (beaming) That's right! Good old Monroe... \nRay throws his arms around Claude, deftly snatching his wallet. Claude extracts himself from Ray's embrace. \nCLAUDE Well, I went to Jefferson, so you must have a different Claude Banks in mind. \nClaude straightens his jacket and heads for the door. Ray stashes the stolen wallet in his jacket. \nRAY Sorry, man. My mistake. \nINT. SPANKY'S -- NIGHT \nOn the stage, the chanteuse has downshifted into a sultry number about back-door lovers and broken dreams. \nRay steps out of the men's room and is instantly collared by BULLETHEAD, a man who makes his living being large and threatening. \nRAY Watch the threads, Bullethead. If this is about my tab, I've got it covered. \nPressed up against the wall, Ray reaches into his jacket and produces Claude's wallet. Bullethead snatches it, inspects it and is not impressed. \nBULLETHEAD This ain't about your tab, Ray. You've got bigger problems than that. \nHe stuffs the wallet back into Ray's jacket and hustles Ray out the back door past the bouncer who let him in. \nBOUNCER Is that Ray Gibson? Who the hell let him in here? \nBACK AT CLAUDE'S TABLE \nClaude returns to the table where Daisy is sipping champagne. He takes the glass out of her hand. \nCLAUDE Come on, honey, let's get out of here. \nDAISY But I'm having a good time... \nWAITER Excuse me, sir, I believe you forgot this. \nThe waiter presents Claude with the bill. \nCLAUDE The bill. Of course, the bill. We couldn't leave without paying the bill. Especially such an incredibly large bill. \nINT. VAN -- NIGHT \nClaude is shoved into the back of the van and the doors are slammed behind him. He bangs and shouts, but it's no use. \nRAY Save your energy, Claude. You're gonna need it. \nRay is stretched out against the back wall. Claude is knocked to the floor as the van lurches into motion. \nRAY Here, this belongs to you. (tossing Claude his wallet) It was empty when I found it. \nCLAUDE Good old Monroe. \nRay swigs from his bottle and offers it to Claude, who isn't interested. \nDiner patrons stare. \nRAY I said you're soft. \nCLAUDE Hey, man, don't ever call me that. \nRAY I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft. \nClaude narrows his eyes. \nCLAUDE Alright. You want some pie? \nRAY Yeah, I want some pie. \nCLAUDE Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie. \nResolved, Claude stomps over to the counter. \nCLAUDE Excuse me, ma'am, I bet a brick will turn that one right there into a colored pie. \nClaude lays down a dollar bill. Mama casually pulls a shotgun from under the counter. \nMAMA And I bet this right here will turn you into a colored pie. \nCLAUDE Okay, Ray, I think we can go now. Much obliged... \nRay gives the whole place a cool once-over as Claude pulls him out the door. Mama turns to Billy, still studying the stitching on his shirt. \nMAMA Don't be concentrating so hard, baby. You're liable to seize yourself again. \nEXT. DOCKS -- NIGHT \nThe truck rolls up to the waters edge. Ray kills the engine and flashes the lights twice. In the passenger seat, Claude is fast asleep. After a few moments, a FAT MAN appears, shining a flashlight into the cab. \nRAY How you doing? We're looking for Slim. \nSLIM You found him. \nRay cocks an eyebrow. \nEXT. DOCKS -- NIGHT \nUnder cover of darkness, a couple of MEN finish loading crates into the bed of the truck. Ray and Claude keep their eyes peeled for the law. Down by the river, they can see lights and hear music from a district of rowdy juke joints. SLIM steps up, wiping his hands. \nSLIM That's it, fellas. Thirty six cases of Puerto Rico's finest. At five bucks a case, that's $180. \nRay pulls out a wad and slaps it in Slim's sweaty palm. The fat man starts counting it out. \nRAY Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim? \nSLIM That's Natchez-under-the-Hill. \nRAY Blacks welcome there? \nSLIM Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out. \nRAY Maybe we will. Nice meeting you. \nSlim slips into the shadows. \nCLAUDE Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you? \nRAY What gave you that idea? \nCLAUDE Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing! \nRAY Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking... \nCLAUDE Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking? \nRAY What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward. \nCLAUDE (dubious) Reward? \nRAY There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash. \nA look of excitement crosses Claude's face, but he quickly shakes it off. \nCLAUDE That's gas money. \nExasperated, Ray stuffs a few bills into Claude's pocket. \nRAY There's your gas money. You stay here and watch the truck. And don't worry, I've got the keys. \nLeft alone, Claude mutters and kicks at the dirt. He leans against the truck. \nRay shakes his head. Carefully, she begins to clear the table. Suddenly, he grabs her wrist. Winston's glass tips over. Ray flips over the cocktail napkin to reveal an extra pile of cards. \nRAY Looks like he had a whole lot of nothing in his hand until you came along. \nWAITRESS (wrenching free) You're hurting my arm. \nEXT. JUKE JOINT -- NIGHT \nRay dashes into the street, glancing both ways. No sign of Winston. Damn. \nEXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT \nWinston produces Ray's pocket watch and pops it open. A smile crosses his face as the mechanical tune plays. \nA sheriff's sedan rounds a corner, illuminating Winston in its headlights. The car pulls up and SHERIFF WARREN PIKE steps out. Distinguished by a casual cruelness, he's a young white man who loves his uniform. \nPIKE If it isn't Winston Hancock. \nWinston tries to move past Pike, but the sheriff blocks his path with a night stick. As Winston backs off, another squad car pulls up behind him. TWO DEPUTIES step from the car, guns drawn. \nPIKE I thought we agreed that you were gonna leave town. \nWINSTON I tried to leave, Sheriff Pike. But your wife begged me to stay. \nPike slams Winston with his club, sending the black man to his knees. As Winston struggles back to his feet, a stiletto flashes and he lunges for the sheriff, slashing his cheek. The deputies grab Winston from behind, holding him by both arms. The long knife clatters to ground. Pike touches his face, examining the blood on his fingers. \nPIKE You just committed suicide, boy. \nINT. BORDELLO HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nRay walks slowly down the hallway to Room 13. He is about to knock when he hears the sound of lovemaking from within. \nINT. SYLVIA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nRay opens the door and peeks in. Sylvia's on top and in charge. Claude is concentrating real hard. Ray smiles to himself and closes the door. \nINT. JUKE JOINT -- NIGHT \nClaude hitches up his suspenders as he comes down the stairs. He finds Ray having a drink at the now-empty bar. \nCLAUDE Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you. \nRAY Here I am. \nCLAUDE Guess we better get going, huh? \nRAY Still got that ten dollars? \nCLAUDE Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia. \nRAY That jelly you were talking to right here? \nCLAUDE She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short... \nRAY So you made a generous contribution. \nCLAUDE What can I say? When the spirit moves me. \nRAY That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight. \nCLAUDE What are you talking about? \nRAY While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes. \nCLAUDE You lost all our money in a card game? \nRAY He even got my daddy's watch. \nCLAUDE Fuck that cheap-ass watch -- (off Ray's glare) I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money? \nRAY We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money. \nEXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT \nRay and Claude head down the alley. \nCLAUDE You sure the truck's this way? (looking over his shoulder) I swear it was back that way. \nSuddenly, the bloodied figure of Winston Hancock lurches from the shadows and grabs Claude by the lapels. Claude is too scared to scream, staggering backward. But the man's grip loosens and he slips to the ground. \nCLAUDE (croaking) Ray... Yo, Ray...! \nRay turns back to find Claude trembling with fear and covered in blood. He just points down. Ray eyes widen. He kneels down and turns Winston's body over. \nCLAUDE I think he's hurt pretty bad. \nRelief all around. \"Thank goodness.\" \nRAY Oh, wait, looks like Jenny died, too. \n\"Bad luck, man.\" \"That's harsh...\" \nRAY Then it goes on for a while about how the crop didn't come in on accounta the frost. (flips over the page) She finishes up with something about a tornado and how your mama and your daddy died in that. But don't worry none. She'll take care of the dog. That is, if it gets over the worms. \nThe prisoners share dark looks. Ray folds up the letter and hands it back to Poker Face. \nPOKER FACE Appreciate it. \nRAY Anybody else need anything read? \n\"No, man, we're good.\" The men shake their heads and return letters and cards to their pockets. Jangle Leg nods and switches places with one of the convicts, parking next to Claude. \nJANGLE LEG How you doin'? \nCLAUDE I'm all right. \nJANGLE LEG You ever done time before? \nCLAUDE You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core. \nJANGLE LEG Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg. \nCLAUDE 'Preciate it. Claude. \nAs they shake, Jangle Leg inspects Claude's hand thoroughly. \nJANGLE LEG Soft and supple. Like a lady's. \nCLAUDE (eyes narrowing) I try to moisturize regularly. \nHOPPIN' BOB (over his shoulder) Hey, Jangle Leg, what'd I tell you about pitching woo on the job? \nJANGLE LEG Sorry, Cap'n. \nClaude snatches back his hand and gives Jangle Leg a hard look. \nHOPPIN' BOB Break's over! Back to work! \nAs the men grab their tools and return to work, Claude leans over to Ray. \nCLAUDE Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg? \nRAY Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year. \nCLAUDE So? \nRAY He does it all by himself. \nINT. MESS HALL -- DUSK \nWincing with each movement and covered in grime from the day's labors, the new men bring up the back of the chow line. COOKIE, the grub-slinger, slaps a large dollop of an unidentifiable substance onto Ray's tray. \nRAY What is that? \nCOOKIE Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise. \nRAY Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there? \nCOOKIE Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs. \nAnother prisoner lays down some tobacco and gets a juicy steak. Ray grabs a hunk of corn bread and makes his way to the back of the room. Claude steps up, holds out his tray for Cookie. \nCLAUDE Excuse me, I don't like it when the food touches each other, so if you could just -- (SPLAT!) -- keep everything separate. \nDisappointed, Claude turns to discover that the only seat left is next to Ray. Scowling, he limps toward it. \nJangle Leg's eyes follow Claude as he approaches the table. Biscuit smacks him. \nBISCUIT Eyes front, mister! \nClaude sits down and promptly goes to work scraping his burnt toast with his knife. The irritating sound slowly brings the entire room to dead silence. All eyes fall on Claude. Scratch, scratch, scratch... \nCOOKIE (stepping up) Problem with the toast? \nCLAUDE It's fine now. \nCookie glowers and takes a seat. \nRAY Stop aggravating people. Just eat your food. \nAs the room returns to normal, Claude starts polishing his fork with his shirttail. Irritated, Ray shoots him a look. \nRAY My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread. \nRay picks up his corn bread and takes a huge bite out of it, rolling his eyes with enthusiasm. \nRAY I thought my mama made good corn bread but this is really something special. \nRay looks at the faces around the room, smiles broadly. Goldmouth is getting embarrassed. \nRAY Who knew I'd have to come all the way down to this here prison, deep in the asshole of the great state of Mississippi, to find such a tasty piece of corn bread? \nThe prisoners begin to laugh. Ray's got them now. \nRAY And who knew that in this great corn bread-making institution I'd come face to face with the biggest, ugliest, stinkiest, ugliest gold- mouthed negro in the entire world. Now get out of my face before I lose my appetite! \nEXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DUSK \nA punch sends Ray sprawling in the dust. Goldmouth looms over him. The incorrigibles form a circle around the combatants. Poker Face, the camp bookie, is taking all bets. \nGOLDMOUTH How you like your corn bread now, New York? \nGoldmouth and Ray square off. Goldmouth swings, Ray ducks and counters with a swift jab to the gut. Goldmouth just flashes a shiny grin and clobbers Ray with a fist the size of a Thanksgiving turkey. Ray sinks to the dust. Radio drops down near him. \nRADIO Come on, New York, you can do better than that! Get up and show him how they do it in Harlem! \nRay shakes his head and staggers back to his feet. He circles the big man and gets in a couple of good shots, much to the crowd's approval. Goldmouth shakes his head and wipes the blood from his nose. Now he's mad. He grabs Ray by the shirt and delivers a crushing blow. Ray reels backward into Cookie's arms. \nCOOKIE I appreciate you going to all this trouble over my corn bread. I don't get a lot of compliments in my line of work. \nCookie shoves Ray back into the ring for more punishment. Claude emerges from the mess hall, munching on a piece of corn bread. He squeezes in between Poker Face and Willie. \nWILLIE Your pal's getting the tar whipped out of him on your account. \nCLAUDE How many times I got to tell you? He ain't my pal. Besides, he looks like he knows what he's doing. \nJust then Claude winces as Goldmouth delivers a jaw-crushing uppercut that knocks Ray on his back. Claude bristles under the incriminating looks coming at him from all directions. \nCLAUDE Alright, alright... \nClaude crouches down as Ray rolls over on his stomach and pushes himself up onto all fours. His eyes are swollen shut, his face covered with blood. \nCLAUDE Hey, Ray, I think you made your point, whatever that is. Maybe now's a good time to throw in the towel. You know what I'm saying? \nRay manages a smile and staggers to his feet. \nRAY (slurring) Shit, Goldmouth. Back in New York, I know bitches who hit harder than you. \nGoldmouth pulls back his fist and lets it fly. Ray hurtles through the crowd, collapsing in the dust. Willie steps in. \nWILLIE The man's taken enough of a beating. Let's get him inside. \nCookie, Radio and Poker Face raise Ray to his feet. Goldmouth slings him over his shoulder and carries him toward the bunkhouse. Dazed, Ray catches Claude's eye. \nRAY Got him good, huh, Claude? He won't be bothering us anytime soon. \nA quick elbow jab from Goldmouth and Ray is out for good. Disgusted with himself, Claude tosses what's left of the corn bread to the mangy dog, who makes short work of it. \nBISCUIT (wagging a finger) Shame, shame, that's your name. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. MESS HALL -- DAY \nOn Sundays, the mess hall also serves as a chapel. From a makeshift pulpit, the blind REVEREND CLAY and his DAUGHTER lead the congregation of convicts in a rousing chorus of \"Down by the Riverside.\" \nEXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY \nThe gospel music filters into the yard, where the prisoners mingle with kinfolk. \nEXT. SGT. DILLARD'S HOUSE -- DAY \nMRS. DILLARD hums along with the gospel music as she places a couple of freshly-baked pies on the window sill to cool. \nEXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY \nThe CAMERA FINDS Claude and Daisy walking hand in hand toward a simple shack just beyond the gun line. This is the TONK HOUSE and Dillard is the gate keeper. \nCLAUDE Request permission to go to the tonk, boss. \nDillard considers Daisy. \nDILLARD I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only. \nCLAUDE You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York. \nDILLARD I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee. \nRAY This is a big surprise, mama. I sure didn't expect to see you down here. \nA long, uncomfortable beat. Mama's lip starts to tremble. \nMAMA GIBSON Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this. \nRAY Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall. \nMAMA GIBSON Don't you lie to me, Rayford. (composing herself) You still have your daddy's watch? (Ray shakes his head) Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more. \nShe puts some money in his hand. \nRAY I can't take that, mama. \nMAMA GIBSON Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this. \nReluctantly, Ray stashes the money in his pocket. \nRAY I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy. \nMAMA GIBSON Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different. \nRAY They gave me life, mama. \nMAMA GIBSON I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too. \nINT. TONK HOUSE -- DAY \nReclining on a straw mattress, Claude watches intently as Daisy gets dressed. The rickety door reverberates with a loud pounding. \nHOPPIN' BOB (off) Time's up, Banks! We got a crowd gathering out here! \nClaude leaps from the bed and slams his fist against the door. \nCLAUDE Woman came all the way from New York, goddamnit! We'll come out when we're good and ready! \nDaisy quickly buttons up her dress. \nCLAUDE Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter? \nDAISY Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking. \nCLAUDE Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up. \nDAISY He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job. \nCLAUDE A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise. \nDaisy smiles weakly and looks away. She doesn't have much faith in this promise. \nDAISY Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too. \nCLAUDE Ray Gibson? (thinks about it) No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand? \nDAISY Sure, Claude, whatever you say. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY \nThe prisoners jump down from the cart and grab hammers and pick axes as Hoppin' Bob keeps count with pebbles. \nDILLARD We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it. \nHOPPIN' BOB You heard the boss! Let's move! \nRay and Claude jump down after Willie. \nWILLIE (squinting at the sun) Looks like a scorcher. \nRADIO I bet the son of a bitch goes over a hundred and ten. \nPOKER FACE I'll take that action. \nEXT. FIELD -- DAY \nThe long line levels a road to a work tune being sung by Jangle Leg. \nDillard checks the thermometer on the truck -- 90 degrees and rising. Mopping his brow, he starts down the line. \nThe sun arcs overhead, a blazing inferno... Heat rises off the road... The men sweat profusely... \"Taking it off here, boss!\" echoes up and down the line. \nBiscuit has his work cut out for him, lugging a water bucket from man to man, offering the ladle. \nThe sun... the hammer... the ladle... the axe... the sun... the hammer... the ladle... the axe... The mercury hits 110 degrees... \nA NEW GUY lets his hammer slip from his fingers, collapses in the dirt. Radio nods to Poker Face, who hands him a pack of cigs. \nBLAM! A high horn note sounds. \nSMASH CUT: \nCLOSE-UP -- Biscuit, all dolled up and flashing a million- dollar smile. She begins to sing. \nBISCUIT A tisket a tasket... \nBiscuit is up on a makeshift platform in the bunkhouse, lipsyncing to Ella Fitzgerald. But its not the depressing bunkhouse anymore, it has transformed into Ray's Boom-Boom Room. PULL OUT SLOWLY as Ray, decked out in a sleek tuxedo steps in front of the CAMERA. He speaks into the CAMERA as he walks... \nRAY That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room. \nGOLDMOUTH (O.S.) Hey, Ray... \nRay looks to his left, sees Goldmouth in the old bunkhouse. \nGOLDMOUTH Where am I at, man? \nRAY (in nightclub) C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door. \nThe CAMERA PANS off Ray to Goldmouth, in a tuxedo, at the front door of the nightclub with two lovely ladies. He waves to himself, sitting on his bunk. Himself waves back, smiling like a kid in a candy store. \nWillie is behind the bar, serving drinks to three gorgeous SKIMMIES. \nWILLIE Hey, Ray, I could get used to this! \nCLOSE ON Cookie sitting a table eating a huge porterhouse. The CAMERA DOLLIES around to find Ray eating with him. \nCOOKIE Ray, my man, this steak is like butter! \nRAY Made just for you, Cookie. \nCOOKIE How about some steak sauce? \nRAY No problem. Oh, boy! \nRay motions to a busboy clearing a table. It's Claude. \nRAY How about some Worchestershire sauce! And clean that damn table. \nClaude grimaces. \nCUT TO: \nWillie laughing, Goldmouth laughing, Poker Face in the bunk laughing. \nPOKER FACE Hey, Ray, I know you got some gambling! \nCUT TO: \nRay at a craps table holding a pair of dice. He looks at Poker Face on his bunk. \nRAY C'mon, Poker Face, what's a club without some dice? \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK as Ray throws the dice. A perfect seven. The CAMERA PANS UP to Poker Face in a tux clutching a fistful of cash. \nPOKER FACE Lucky seven! My nigger! Let it ride! \nAcross the room, Jangle Leg, in a tux, sits at the piano. Radio, also in a tux, beats on the drums. \nJANGLE LEG Sing, girlfriend! \nBiscuit sings the song, smiling lovingly at her man. Everyone is having a great time in Ray's Boom-Boom Room, until... \nWhistles blow. At the front door, Hoppin' Bob appears with FIVE TRUSTIES dressed in police outfits. The incorrigibles scatter. \nRADIO Hey, Ray, looks like trouble! \nA hard white light from Hoppin' Bob's flashlight shines directly into the CAMERA. \nCLOSE ON Ray, in his bed, back in the old bunkhouse. The music stops abruptly. He shields his eyes from the harsh light. Hoppin' Bob is looming over him. It's back to reality. \nHOPPIN' BOB You don't shut up, you're gonna spend the rest of the night in the hole, Gibson! That goes for the rest of you girls, too. I don't want to hear another peep about no Boom-Boom fucking Room! \nA loud burst of flatulence cuts through the darkness. Hoppin' Bob turns his flashlight on Cookie. \nCOOKIE Sorry, Cap'n. \nScowling, Hoppin' Bob steps out of the cage and locks the door behind him. The men slowly settle back in. \nRADIO (whispering) Pretty good story, Ray. Didn't much care for the ending though. \nLights out at Camp 8. \nEXT. CAMP 8 -- YARD -- DAY \nCLAUDE I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nThe sun beats down on the tin roofs... \nINT. BUNKHOUSE -- CAGE -- NIGHT \nThe prisoners are gathered around a table, laying out money. As usual, Poker Face is keeping tabs. \nCOOKIE I'll take Claude to die on Wednesday for fifty cents. \nPOKER FACE Wednesday for two bits. And don't forget you already owe me a steak. \nBISCUIT I'll take Claude for Friday. That's my birthday. \nWith an ear to his receiver, Radio slaps his money on the table. \nRADIO Weatherman says a heat wave's coming. I say neither one of 'em son of bitches gonna last past Thursday. \nPOKER FACE I told you before, I don't take pennies. Two cigarettes or one nickel minimum. What about you, Willie? Gonna get in on this action? \nWILLIE I got a crispy new dollar bill says both of them gonna make it. \nThis gives the men pause. Willie tosses his money on the table. \nPOKER FACE Now that's what I call a bet. \nGOLDMOUTH It's a mighty long shot, Willie. Nobody ever made it a week in the hole. \nJANGLE LEG Not in August, anyway. \nBut Willie leaves the money where it is. \nPOKER FACE Who else has some guts around here? \nPoker Face makes notations as the betting resumes. \nEXT. FIELD -- DAY \nWork goes on as usual for the prisoners of Camp 8. Trusties keep their eyes peeled for slackers. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nThe brick shacks bake in the noonday sun. \nEXT. FIELD -- DAY \nBiscuit moves down the line offering the ladle to the men as they struggle under a crushing heat wave. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nSuperintendent Abernathy strides up and gives the nod to Dillard, who unlocks the doors. Huddled in their respective cells, Ray and Claude shrink from the bright sunlight. Then, slowly and painfully, they rise to their feet. \nIn the background, the incorrigibles gather at the gun line as word spreads that the fellows are still alive. Abernathy glances at the crowd with annoyance. \nABERNATHY I don't think these boys have learned their lesson. Let's give 'em another week for good measure. \nDILLARD Sure you want to do that, sir? \nABERNATHY Don't you ever question me, Sgt. Dillard. When I give an order, you jump to it, or I'll kick you and that first-cousin you call a wife outta that pretty little house so fast it'll make your pin-head spin. You got that? \nDILLARD Yes, sir. \nDillard slams the doors on Ray and Claude and clamps shut the padlocks. Abernathy smiles at the incorrigibles, who regard him with undisguised hatred. \nAT THE GUN LINE \nA somber Poker Face offers Willie a wad of bills. \nPOKER FACE Well, they made it a week. Looks like you win, Willie. \nWILLIE Let it ride. \nINT. CLAUDE'S CELL -- NIGHT \nA slot at the bottom of the door opens. A tin plate of mush slides through and the slot closes. Slumped in the corner, Claude reaches for the food -- but a RAT beats him to it, scampering out of the shadows and leaping onto the dish. \nINT. RAY'S CELL -- NIGHT \nA commotion and wild screams come from Claude's cell. Ray leaps to his feet, shouting through the wall. \nRAY Claude? You alright?! \nINT. CLAUDE'S CELL -- NIGHT \nRay's eyes blink open. Claude holds out a hand and helps him stand up. They share a look. They made it. \nABERNATHY (scowling) Sergeant Dillard, make sure these two are out in the fields first thing in the morning. \nAbernathy turns on his heels. Dillard considers the two tough guys standing before him. \nDILLARD Go on, get inside. \nRay and Claude stagger toward the bunkhouse as the incorrigibles gather on the porch and help them in out of the sun. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINSERT -- TIME PASSAGE \n(Note: This montage is mixed with 16mm and Super 8 footage. A beautiful 1940s song plays over.) \nA. King Kong is machined-gunned off the top of the Empire State Building... \nB. FDR introduces his New Deal... \nC. The incorrigibles chop weeds... \nD.

At the height of the depression, poor people line up in front of a soup kitchen... \nF. Ray and the crew sit around the poker table playing cards and laughing... \nG.

Instead of black and white stripes, the prisoners now wear blue twill. In an audience of new faces, the CAMERA FINDS some familiar ones. Ray and Claude are surrounded by their crew -- Willie, Radio, Poker Face, Cookie, Biscuit, Jangle Leg and Goldmouth. A decade has passed. \nEXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY \nA line of NEW PRISONERS stands before Dillard, now 10 years older. \nDILLARD ...Camp 8 is for incorrigibles, so whatever you've done to get here, believe me, we are not impressed. You new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at Camp 8. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard -- \nDillard pauses in front of a big country boy who can't be more than 18 years old. The kid is bouncing a rubber ball. \nDILLARD What the hell you think you're doing? \nThe kid don't answer. An OLD GUY steps forward. \nOLD GUY Excuse me, boss. That kid don't talk. Something wrong with his head, just can't get right, boss. \nDILLARD Can't get right, huh? We'll see how long he last. Now, where was I? \nHOPPIN' BOB We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss. \nDILLARD That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line... \nINT. BUNKHOUSE -- DAY \nA plump PIG roots about in a small pen. A sign dangles from a post -- \"First Prize.\" The incorrigibles of Camp 8 limber up for the big game with the inmates of Camp 12 across the field. \nPOKER FACE Think you can handle something that big, Cookie? \nCOOKIE I handled your mama, didn't I? Don't y'all worry. I got plans for that bad boy. Ain't none of him going to waste. \nBeyond the fence, a late-model sedan rolls up. STAN BLOCKER, in a straw hat and a rumpled suit, climbs out and stretches his legs. Irritated, he smacks a mosquito and exchanges a few words with Dillard. \nDILLARD Banks! Get over here! \nClaude hustles over, removing his hat. \nDILLARD This is Stan Blocker. Scout for the Nigger Leagues. \nBLOCKER Negro Leagues, actually. Pittsburgh Crawfords. Ever hear of us? \nCLAUDE We get the games on the radio sometimes. \nBLOCKER We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton. \nCLAUDE You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there. \nBLOCKER Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him? \nCLAUDE You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested? \nBLOCKER Crawford's are always looking for new talent. \nCLAUDE Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison. \nBLOCKER There are ways around that. Right sergeant? \nBlocker winks at Dillard, then glances at the incorrigibles practicing in the field. Goldmouth, Cookie, Poker Face, Biscuit -- they don't exactly inspire confidence. \nBLOCKER Nice looking squad. See you after the game. \nBlocker takes a seat on the bench. \nEXT. BASEBALL FIELD -- DAY \nThe inmates of Camp 12 are in the field. Our boys from Camp 8 cheer for Cookie digging in at the plate. Ray taunts the opposition from the third base line. \nThe PITCHER winds up and releases a fast ball. Cookie swings and connects for a base hit up the middle. \nIN THE STANDS \nMrs. Abernathy and Mrs. Dillard share a box of Cracker Jack. \nMRS. ABERNATHY Of course, the superintendent's hoping for a boy, but personally, I'd prefer a girl. \nMRS. DILLARD Whatever it is will be a little gift from heaven. Look at the way she glows. \nMae Rose sits next to them. She is SIX MONTHS PREGNANT. She removes her sunglasses and coyly bites a fingernail when she spots Can't Get Right in the on-deck circle. \nDOWN ON THE FIELD \nCan't Get Right smiles shyly. Sensing trouble, Claude ushers Can't Get Right toward the plate, massaging his shoulders. \nCLAUDE You're my boy, just keep what little mind you have focused on the game. If you hit that ball the way I know you can, you might just be our ticket off this farm. \nCan't Get Right digs in. Claude returns to the sidelines and appeals to the gods. The pitcher winds up and releases a fast ball. Can't Get Right connects with that familiar CRACK! Blocker stands up and watches the ball clear the fence and just keep going. \nWith his team cheering him on, Can't Get Right trots around the bases. But he's still looking at Mae Rose. \nEXT. CAMP 8 YARD (LATER) -- DAY \nCookie slowly turns the pig on a spit over an open fire. The incorrigibles are savoring a victory feast. As always, trusty guards keep an eye on things. \nOff to the side, Blocker is laughing with Ray and Claude. He takes a hit off Ray's bottle of shine. It's not his first, either. \nBLOCKER Mark my words, within five years there's gonna be a colored man playing in the majors. \nRAY Come on, the world hasn't changed that much. \nBLOCKER Maybe not yet. But it will. And I'll be out of a job. Damn, that's some tasty hooch. \nCLAUDE It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses. \nRAY So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy? \nBLOCKER I think that boy could be the next Josh Gibson. I'm gonna talk to the front office about him, you can bet on that. Damn, it's getting late. We got a game in Memphis tomorrow. \nBlocker starts for his car, parked just beyond the gun line. \nCLAUDE What about us? Don't forget to mention us. \nConfused, Abernathy looks back and forth between the two men. Then Willie steps forward. \nWILLIE Actually, it was me, boss. I know I may look old... \nBISCUIT Any fool could see that baby's mine, boss. \nCOOKIE I beg to differ. That cute little rascal belongs to me... \nPOKER FACE I'm the father... \nRADIO I'm the father, boss... \nGOLDMOUTH I'm the father... \nJANGLE LEG I'm the father... \nAnd so it goes down the line, until every last man of Camp 8 has stepped forward to claim kinship with the Superintendent. Even hard-ass Dillard can't help cracking a smile. Disgusted, confused and thoroughly fed up, Abernathy jams the revolver into his belt and climbs into the car. As he guns the engine, Mae Rose gazes out the back window, smiling one last time at the father of her baby. Can't Get Right smiles back. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY \nIt's visiting Sunday and Ray's Boom Boom Room is in full swing. Sylvia's girls are everywhere. Down at the gunline, Dillard takes his cut from inmates lined up for their turn in the tonk. A FIVE-PIECE PRISON BAND is playing the blues. Nearby, Willie is dispensing Ray's moonshine from a bunkhouse window. He raises a jar in a toast. \nWILLIE To Superintendent Abernathy. May he have many more grandchildren! \nThe incorrigibles erupt in boisterous agreement. Claude grabs Can't Get Right and shakes him. \nCLAUDE What I want to know is where? When? How? \nWILLIE Wasting your breath, Claude. He ain't the type to kiss and tell. \nJust then, Rev. Clay and his daughter emerge from the mess hall and start across the yard. It's a good thing the old man is blind because he wouldn't want to see how far his flock has strayed. The Reverend inhales deeply as one of Sylvia's girls passes nearby. \nREV. CLAY There's a sweet fragrance in the air today. \nCLAY'S DAUGHTER The magnolias are blooming early this year, daddy. \nBlissed out incorrigibles enjoy a last dance as the band downshifts into a slow, sultry number. In the midst of the dancers, Claude clings to Sylvia. Nearby, Jangle Leg dances intimately with a YOUNG WOMAN. \nUp on the porch, Ray refreshes Biscuit's drink. Biscuit has been crying and it shows. The liquor probably isn't helping. \nRAY Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him. \nBISCUIT Hell with him. It ain't that. \nHe pulls some folded sheets of paper from his pocket, passes them to Ray. \nRAY These are free papers. \nBISCUIT (devastated) What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure. \nRAY Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep. \nPoker Face leans in. \nPOKER FACE (sotto) I'll give you three to one she gives him the strap. \nRay gives Poker face a shove, then turns back to Biscuit. \nRAY It's 1945. It's a different world now. \nBISCUIT Not for me, it ain't. \nRAY Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would. \nRay hands back the papers and heads off to dance with a PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN lingering nearby. Left alone, Biscuit polishes off his moonshine and checks his reflection in the bunkhouse window. \nBISCUIT No life on the inside, no life on the outside... \nHe crumples the discharge papers and drops them. Then he steps down from the porch and walks calmly past the dancing prisoners toward the gun line. \nRay lifts his head off his date's shoulder. Something about the way Biscuit is walking suggests that he isn't going to stop. \nRAY Hey, Biscuit...! \nBut it's too late. Biscuit crosses the gun line and keeps walking, his eyes focused on the horizon. \nTRUSTY Man over the line! \nThe band stops playing, the dancers grow still. Dillard turns around and squints. \nDILLARD Goddamnit, Biscuit, get back here! \nBut Biscuit isn't paying attention. He breaks into a run. Dillard nods to Hoppin' Bob who raises his rifle and draws a bead. But he can't pull the trigger. He lowers his gun. \nSuddenly enraged, Ray hauls off and knocks Claude down with a solid right. Surprised, Claude touches his bloody lip. \nRAY My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going. \nCLAUDE Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block. \nRAY Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks. \nCLAUDE Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson. \nA hard look comes to Ray's eyes as Claude rises to his feet. \nRAY Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret. \nCLAUDE The only thing I regret is the day I met you. \nRAY Well, if that's the way it is... \nCLAUDE That's the way it is. \nRAY Then I have nothing left to say to you. \nRay walks away, leaving Claude to nurse his split lip. \nCLAUDE You never said nothing of value anyway. \nINSERT -- TIME PASSAGE \nA. In his Pittsburgh Crawfords uniform, Can't Get Right lays into a fast ball, sending it soaring into the bleachers... \nB. People dance in the street in Time Square, marking the end of WWII... \nC. Hoppin' Bob drops a package on Ray's bunk. Ray rips off the brown paper to reveal a book: \"So You Want to Learn to Fly...\" \nD. Claude and Sylvia make love in the tonk house... \nE. In the mess hall, Ray pointedly carries his tray past a table where Claude sits with Willie... \nF. An A-bomb explodes in the Bikini Atolls... \nG. Jimmy Stewart hugs his wife and children at the end of \"It's a Wonderful Life\"... \nH. Jackie Robinson slides across home plate at Ebbets Field... \nI. Ray runs full tilt across a field toward a barn. Sure enough, there's the single engine crop duster parked right where he said it would be... \nJ. Claude and another INMATE repair a hole in the bunkhouse roof. They dive for cover as Ray's crop duster swoops low overhead and dips out of sight beyond the trees. A puff of smoke rises into the sky... \nK. Soot-stained, Ray is marched to the hole and shoved inside... \nL. Newly elected president Harry Truman holds up a copy of the Chicago Tribune baring the headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman\"... \nM. RCA unveils the first color television... \nN. Cars pull up next to speaker poles in front of a drive-in movie screen... \nO. In the bunkhouse, early rock and roll plays on a modern 1950s radio that sits where the old vacuum tube receiver used to be. A YOUNG TOUGH now occupies Radio's old bunk... \nP. At the poker table, Poker Face slumps forward onto his pile of chips, revealing a straight flush. The other men quickly fold... \nQ. With a TRUSTY standing guard, Claude and Ray silently shovel dirt into Poker Face's grave. The CAMERA MOVES past gravemarkers -- Biscuit, Jangle Leg, Radio... \nR. Marilyn Monroe's skirt rises on a blast of subway air in \"The Seven-Year Itch\"... \nS. Rosa Parks is arrested for refusing to sit in the back of the bus... \nT. Elvis Presley creates a sensation on the Ed Sullivan Show... \nU. School children learn to \"duck and cover\" in the event of nuclear attack... \nV. The inmates of Camp 8 work to level a road. Ray's on one side, Claude's on the other... \nW. Prisoners mingle with friends and family on visiting Sunday. Claude waits on the bunkhouse steps. His face brightens when Sylvia appears... \nX. Blacks sit-in at lunch counters in Greensboro, N.C... \nY. Kennedy is elected... \nZ. OMITTED... \nAA. Martin Luther King delivers his \"I have a dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial... \nBB. The Zapruder footage of Kennedy being shot... \nCC. American soldiers jump down from helicopters and run for the jungles in Vietnam... \nSuddenly, he makes a break for the Dillard house. \nTRUSTY Man over the line! \nRay turns to see Claude dashing across no-man's land. Shots ring out from the shooter shack, kicking up dirt around Claude's feet as he serpentines across the field. \nEXT. DILLARD'S HOUSE -- DAY \nBreathless, Claude makes it to the kitchen window and digs his hand into the golden-brown crust, shoving a sloppy fistful of pie into his mouth. More shots ring out. Bullets PING all around him. Grabbing the pie, he darts around the side of the building, out of range. Back against the wall, he drops down on his haunches, snarfing pie like a hungry wolf. \nEXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY \nA case of empty Coke bottles sits in the middle of the yard, glinting in the hot sun. His face smeared with boysenberry, Claude finishes taking off his boots and socks and steps barefoot onto the bottles. \nDILLARD Comfortable? \nCLAUDE As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss. \nDILLARD We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job. \nHe takes a trusty's rifle and moves among the inmates, who have gathered around. He stops when he gets to Ray. \nDILLARD How about it, Ray? \nRay glances at Claude, then back at Dillard. \nDILLARD I'll make you trusty right now. If that pie-eatin' son of a bitch falls off those bottles and you have to shoot him, I'll see to it you get a pardon. Hell, I'll personally escort you out the gate. \nDillard offers the rifle to Ray, who doesn't have to think too long. \nRAY You don't want to give me a gun, boss. I'm liable to use it on you. \nEXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- SUNDOWN \nRay's been given the same treatment as Claude. Barefoot, balanced on Coke bottles, the two men stand a few feet apart facing each other. A trusty with a rifle keeps an eye on them. After years of silence, the tension reaches the breaking point... \nCLAUDE You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal. \nRAY Excuse me? Are you talking to me? \nCLAUDE I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now. \nRAY After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be. \nCLAUDE I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing. \nRAY I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all. \nThe trusty tightens his grip on his rifle. He'd love the opportunity. \nCLAUDE I was sorry to hear about your mama passing. \nRAY That was five years ago. \nCLAUDE I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it. \nRAY We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me. \nThey stand in stony silence. Then Ray starts to laugh. A long, low belly laugh. \nCLAUDE What?! \nRAY You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you. \nCLAUDE Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue. \nThe two men start to laugh. Really laugh. Nearly a decade's worth of laughter comes welling up out of them, and they nearly lose their balance, which only makes them laugh harder. \nEXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY \nA trusty bangs the rap iron. Young prisoners pour from the bunkhouse and line up for breakfast. Claude and Ray bring up the rear, the elder statesmen of the bunch. By a long shot. \nDILLARD Fourteen acres today and only 12 hours of daylight! Eat up and move it out! Gibson! Banks! Get your sorry asses over here! \nClaude and Ray step out of line and approach Dillard. \nDILLARD Every morning I wake up praying that Ray Gibson and Claude Banks have died in their sleep and every morning you disappoint me. \nRAY AND CLAUDE Sorry, boss. \nDILLARD I stand before you a defeated man. Try as I might, I can't seem to break you. I swear, if they dropped a nuclear bomb on this camp, you and the cockroaches would be the only things left. But starting today at least I won't have to endure your presence any longer. You've got fifteen minutes to clear out your footlockers. You're both being reassigned to the Superintendent's mansion. And I, for one, will not miss you. \nRay and Claude share a look. Then Ray embraces Dillard, who stoically endures the breach of his personal space. \nRAY I always wanted to do that. (sighing) There is so much love inside of this man. \nCLAUDE Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station. \nRay scowls as Claude straightens his chauffeur uniform and heads up the path to the mansion. \nEXT. GREENVILLE BUS STATION -- DAY \nClaude pulls up in front of the station, steps out of the car and holds the door for Wilkins, who checks his watch. \nWILKINS You know I trust you, Claude. \nCLAUDE Yes, sir. \nWILKINS I'll be right back. \nWilkins heads into the station, leaving Claude alone with the Continental. All around him are the sights, sounds and smells of the free world. A woman rushes into the arms of a man as he climbs off a bus. Across the street is Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint where Cookie never made it to the peach cobbler. A young brother with a boom box walks by. In the street, kids crowd around the back of an ice cream truck. Then Claude catches his reflection in the car window and frowns. When did he get this old? Unnerved, he moves around to the back of the car and pops open the trunk. \nRAY (sitting up) Damn, it was getting hot in there. \nCLAUDE What the hell are you doing in that trunk?! \nRAY You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you? \nCLAUDE I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you. \nRAY Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk. \nCLAUDE You ain't getting out of that trunk. \nRAY Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here. (Ray struggles out of the trunk) We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go! \nCLAUDE Go where, Ray? \nRAY Back to New York for starters. \nCLAUDE And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man. \nRAY This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys. \nCLAUDE Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car. \nRAY Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys. \nCLAUDE I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride. \nRAY Don't make me take them away from you. \nCLAUDE Hey, there's Wilkins! \nRay looks, Claude clocks him. Ray slumps back into the trunk. Claude stuffs Ray's legs back into the trunk and slams the lid. \nCLAUDE Who's driving now, bitch? \nHe looks up just as Wilkins and the new superintendent exit the bus station. Warren Pike's hair has gone grey and he's 40 years older, but there's no mistaking the former sheriff of Natchez County. He still bears a nasty scar on his cheek from a wound inflicted long ago. \nCLAUDE'S POV -- Pike appears as a young man in his sheriff's uniform striding slowly toward him. \nClaude blinks and looks again. Pike has returned to his old self as he and Wilkins step up. \nPIKE (dropping his bags) There you go, boy. \nOblivious, Pike climbs into the back seat. Wilkins nods to Claude. \nWILKINS Come on, Claude, time to go. \nClaude snaps to it, grabbing the bags. He considers opening the trunk, but decides to carry them around to the front seat with him. \nEXT. KITCHEN PORCH -- DUSK \nBacks to the CAMERA, Ray and Claude urinate, presumably off the porch. \nRAY You sure it was him? \nCLAUDE Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em. \nRAY I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now. \nCLAUDE We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe. \nRAY I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one. \nINT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT \nWilkins pours a frosty drink and offers it to Pike. \nWILKINS Lemonade? \nPIKE He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins. \nWILKINS Do you realize what your saying, Gibson? \nRAY That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me. \nPIKE Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger! \nRAY He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it. \nWILKINS Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike? \nPIKE What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal! \nCLAUDE Forty years of cheap labor! Gimme that gun. \nClaude grabs for the gun. \nRAY No, I'm gonna kill him -- \nCLAUDE No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him! \nClaude yanks the gun free and points it right in Pike's face. Wilkins trains his gun on Claude. But the moment passes. Claude lowers the gun. Bewildered, Wilkins does the same. \nCLAUDE I can't do it. \nRAY That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun. \nCLAUDE What'd you say? \nRAY I said you're soft. \nCLAUDE Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that. \nRay mouths the word -- \"soft.\" Claude clenches his jaw, points the gun and pulls the trigger. Click. \nPike smirks and pulls a small gun from his boot. But as he raises it -- BLAM! Pike is hurled backward by a shotgun blast. Shocked, Ray and Claude look at Wilkins, his gun still smoking in his hands. \nAfter a significant beat, Ray reaches down and gingerly retrieves his daddy's gold pocket watch. \nRAY I believe this is mine. \nEXT. SUPERINTENDENT'S MANSION -- DAY \nA gurney carrying Pike's body is lifted into the back of a van by two COUNTY CORONERS. Nearby, a distraught Wilkins tells his story to a couple of SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. \nWILKINS ...I was drawing a bead on a bird when Mr. Pike just stepped into my line of fire. \nDEPUTY #1 Where were the two convicts when the shot was fired? \nWILKINS They were busy loading up the truck. We got him back here as quick as possible, but... I just feel terrible about this... \nINT. MANSION -- DAY \nRay and Claude watch through the window as Wilkins talks to the deputies. \nCLAUDE Why don't he just tell 'em the truth? \nRAY He knows nobody wants to hear the truth. \nOne of the deputies pats Wilkins sympathetically on the back. Then he and his partner put away their notebooks and head for their vehicle. Wilkins heads up the steps and into the house. \nWILKINS Well, I think they bought it. One of the deputies belongs to my church. \nVisibly shaken, Wilkins takes a seat, wiping the sweat from his brow with a handkerchief. \nWILKINS I realize there's no way... There's nothing I can say to make up for forty years... I'll have Charlotte prepare those pardon papers right away. \nWilkins winces and swallows a couple of pills from his box. \nWILKINS Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom? \nCLAUDE (giving him a hand) Sure, boss. \nWILKINS I'm not your boss. Not anymore. \nEXT. PRISON CEMETERY (PRESENT) -- DAY \nJake looks at Willie expectantly. \nJAKE So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right? \nLEON (smacking him) No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we? \nJAKE (chewing on it) Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons? \nNURSE HUMPHRIES Who wants Jell-O? \nThe magic word. The poker players join a stampede of oldsters in a clatter of canes, walkers and artificial limbs. Ray and Claude are left alone at the table. \nRAY Hey, where you going? We got money on the table here! \nClaude glances around to ensure that he's not overheard. \nCLAUDE You know, Ray, I've been chewing on what you said this afternoon. I think I got a plan. \nRay gives Claude a long look. \nRAY Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here? \nCLAUDE Shh! Is that so hard to believe? \nRAY Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway. \nCLAUDE You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that. \nRAY It's too late for plans. \nCLAUDE Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway. \nRay turns away as Claude walks off. A DODDERING INMATE stands nearby slurping on Jell-O. His robe hangs open. \nRAY Hey, man, cover that shit up! \nDisgusted, Ray discards his own Jell-O. He pulls out his daddy's pocket watch and checks the time. The little mechanical tune nags at him. He snaps the lid shut and considers the watch resting in the palm of his hand. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT \nThe building is dark. But then, through a first-floor window, we see the unmistakable orange glow of a fire. \nINT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT \nAn ALARM BLARES as the place fills with smoke. Wearing a robe and slippers, Nurse Humphries runs among the prisoners, helping them out the door. \nEXT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT \nCoughing and disheveled, Ray emerges onto the lawn pushing Willie in the wheelchair. As other prisoners evacuate the building, Ray looks around for Claude, but he doesn't see him. Nurse Humphries takes a quick head count. \nNURSE HUMPHRIES Is everyone here? \nRAY Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude! \nNURSE HUMPHRIES Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude? \nRAY He must still be in there. \nGrimly, Ray starts toward the burning infirmary. Nurse Humphries holds him back. \nNURSE HUMPHRIES Wait for the firemen! \nRAY It'll be too late. \nNURSE HUMPHRIES You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it! \nRAY I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me. \nRay shakes her off and runs up the steps, disappearing into the burning building. \nINT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT \nRay dodges flames as he presses into the inferno. \nEXT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT \nNurse Humphries, Willie and the rest of the inmates watch grimly as flames engulf the building. Nobody could survive this blaze. From the highway comes the siren wail of approaching fire engines. But it's too late. Sparks erupt into the night sky as the roof collapses... \nEXT. INFIRMARY -- DAWN \nFire trucks pull away from the smoldering ruins. A local REPORTER interviews witnesses. INVESTIGATORS comb through the wreckage, making notes. COUNTY CORONERS pull a couple of gurneys from the back of their van. \nEXT. INFIRMARY RUINS -- DAY \nSuperintendent Bill Burke is led through the destruction by a FIRE INSPECTOR. They approach the coroners as they finish zipping up two body bags. \nBURKE How did it start? \nFIRE INSPECTOR Probably old wires. The place was a tinderbox just waiting to go. \n", "test1_input": "RAY All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving. \nSpanky considers the terms. Can he afford to trust Ray? Can he afford not to? \nSPANKY If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense. \nRAY Understood. \nSPANKY Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going. \nRay glances around. The pulley rope is still twitching in the water. \nRAY I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind. \nSPANKY If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot. \nRAY I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full. \nSpanky sees Ray's point. He nods to the henchman, who hoists Claude's limp body out of the water and onto the cement. Spanky plants a foot on Claude's chest and applies pressure. A geyser of Harlem River water shoots from Claude's mouth as he sputters back to life. \nSPANKY For your sake, I hope you can drive. Somebody give him some dry clothes. \nCUT TO: \nTHE SPINNING WHEEL OF A TRUCK \nThe CAMERA MOVES UP the side of the old Ford truck to find Claude sitting pensively in the passenger seat. \nINT. TRUCK (MOVING) -- NIGHT \nRay palms the wheel. \nRAY Tell me about that hot sketch you were hypin' last night. She was a choice bit of calico. You two been seeing each other a long time? Gonna slap the handcuffs on her and stroll down the aisle one of these days? \nTight-lipped, Claude shifts in his seat. \nRAY Sometimes I wish I could find me a sheba to settle down with. Suppose I'm just a tomcat by nature. (trying to fill the silence) This little rum run is gonna seriously improve my relationship with Spanky. He's a good man to have on your side. He's got the capital and the connections. That's what you got to have in that business. Spanky's place is pretty plush, but one of these days I'm gonna open up my own establishment. Ray's Boom-Boom Room. You like that? Ray's Boom-Boom Room. That's in the groove, don't you think? \nIf Claude does like it, he's not letting on. \nRAY Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation. \nCLAUDE Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job. \nRAY Start your job? What kind of job? \nCLAUDE Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars. \nRAY That's some long green. \nCLAUDE Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay. \nBeat of silence. Ray laughs to himself. \nCLAUDE What? \nRAY Nothing. \nCLAUDE No, tell me what's so funny. \nRAY I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me. \nCLAUDE Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you. \nRAY Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time. \nCLAUDE I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles. \nRAY Why didn't you take it? \nCLAUDE The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy. \nRAY You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that. \nCLAUDE At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about. \nRAY You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller. \nCLAUDE Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer. \nRAY A loan officer? \nCLAUDE That's right, a loan officer. \nRAY So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you? \n", "test1_true": "Ray pulls out his pocket watch. A mechanical tune plays as he checks the time. \nRAY How would I get a loan, anyway? \nCLAUDE You need collateral. \nRAY (re: watch) Like this? \nCLAUDE That thing? Who'd you steal it from? \nRAY My daddy gave me this watch. \nCLAUDE Yeah? Who'd he steal it from? \nRAY My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time. \nCLAUDE Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied! \nRay stuffs his daddy's watch back in his pocket. \nRAY Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room. \nCLAUDE There is no Boom-Boom Room. \nRAY When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me? \nCLAUDE Oooh... \nRAY I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut. \nEXT. ROADSIDE DINER -- DAY \nThe truck veers off the highway and jerks to a halt in front of the rundown establishment. \nINT. ROADSIDE DINER -- DAY \nA dozen WHITE FOLKS look up as Ray and Claude push through the door. \nRAY Man, something smells good in here. How's everybody doing? \nNothing but sullen stares from all corners of the room. \nCLAUDE (sotto) Maybe we oughta find another place. \nRAY Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there. \nCLAUDE I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now. \nClaude tugs Ray towards the door but Ray won't be dissuaded. He boldly addresses a YOUNG MAN in an apron behind the counter. \nRAY Good evening, Billy. We'd like some coffee and a couple of slices of that homemade pie you've got advertised. \nBILLY How you know my name's Billy? \nRAY It says so right there on your shirt. \nBILLY (glancing down) That what that says? \nBilly's MAMA sets a piping hot pie on the back counter and steps up next to her son. She casts a disparaging glance at Claude's suit. \nMAMA If you boys can read so good, how come you missed that sign in the window? \nClaude considers the sign she's pointing to. \nCLAUDE You mean this sign? The one that says \"No Coloreds Allowed.\" That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign? \nRAY Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way. \nMAMA Those are whites-only pies. \nRAY Got any nigger pies? \nClaude jabs him. \nCLAUDE Any fool could see those are whites- only, not-for-blacks, come-on-let's- get-the-fuck-outta-here pies. Thank you very much. \nClaude starts tugging Ray toward the door. \nRAY (sotto) Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude. \nCLAUDE (sotto) Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for? \nRAY You're soft. \nCLAUDE What'd you say? \n", "test1_id": 360, "test2_input": "PIKE Well, if that's the case, then you don't have anything to worry about, do you? \nPike turns his back on the prisoners and checks the time on a gold pocket watch -- Ray's pocket watch. But from his cell, Ray can't hear the mechanical tune. \nPIKE Time to get home to the missus. See y'all in the morning. \nIn the cell, Claude turns to Ray. \nCLAUDE The man's gotta point. We're innocent, after all. I just gotta get a good night's sleep on this filthy mattress. Keep our heads on straight, stay cool, what's the worst thing that could happen to us? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM -- DAY \nThe CAMERA Scorseses in on the JUDGE'S face... \nJUDGE Life! \nThe gavel comes down with a thundering crash. Stunned, Ray and Claude resist the BAILIFFS' efforts to remove them from the courtroom. \nRAY Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life! \nCLAUDE Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning! \nThey continue to protest loudly as they are dragged bodily through the door. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY \nBlues music kicks in as a prison transport bus rolls down a dirt road cutting through the bleak Mississippi Delta. \nINT. BUS (MOVING) -- DAY \nLONG-CHAIN CHARLIE, a white prison sergeant, sits behind the wheel. A shot gun hangs within easy reach. \nThe CAMERA MOVES BACK past grim-faced PRISONERS with their hands and feet shackled. We arrive at Ray and Claude sitting in grim silence as the bus lurches along. \nEXT. PRISON -- DAY \nThe bus veers off the country road and passes under a sign: MISSISSIPPI STATE PENITENTIARY. Sgt. Dillard's voice PLAYS OVER. \nDILLARD (V.O.) Welcome to the farm. Here you will be provided with ample opportunity to repay your debt to society through the rigors of hard labor... \nRay and Claude stare out the window, getting their first look at the harsh reality that awaits them. Cotton fields stretch to the horizon in every direction. HOE-GANGS till the earth under the watchful gaze of TRUSTY SHOOTERS... \nDILLARD (V.O.) In between harvest and planting season we got fields need clearing, roads need building and ditches need digging. You will eat only what you can grow. Your crop don't come in, you'll go hungry. If you die, don't worry 'bout us none. We'll find somebody to replace you... \nAlong the road, CONVICTS cast hard looks at the new men as the cart passes. A WHITE SERGEANT on horseback shifts his rifle and casually spits tobacco juice in the dirt... \nEXT. CAMP 8 -- DAY \nA low-slung, single-story bunkhouse surrounded by a dirt yard. Two shooter shacks sit at diagonal corners of the yard. In each shack, two trusties with rifles keep vigilant watch over the camp. SGT. FRED DILLARD paces down the line of new men as HOPPIN' BOB, an uncommonly ugly trusty, unlocks their leg irons. \nDILLARD This here is Camp 8. Camp 8 is for incorrigibles, so whatever you've done to get here, believe me, we're not impressed. You new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at Camp 8. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line. If you step outside the gun line without my permission, you will be shot. If you trip and fall over the gun line, you will be shot. If you spit, if you pee, if you stick your ass out and take a dump over the gun line, you will be shot. \nDillard plucks a hat off one of the new prisoners and tosses it over the gun line. SHOTS ring out from the nearest shack. The hat is torn to shreds. \nDILLARD One of my trusties puts a bullet in you when you're trying to run, I'm liable to give him a pardon for saving me the trouble of tracking you down, so you can bet their aim is true. \nDillard puts a cigarette in his mouth. Hoppin' Bob is right there with the flame. \nDILLARD My name is Sgt. Dillard. In the unlikely event that you need to address me, you call me boss. You already met this handsome fella right here. Hoppin' Bob's my ace boon coon. You run afoul of Hoppin' Bob, you run afoul of me. \nNodding to Bob, Dillard saunters off. \nHOPPIN' BOB New men, strip down! \nRay and Claude share a look. Self-consciously, the men begin to undress. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE -- DAY \nDouble bunks line the walls, with a footlocker for each inmate. As usual, there's a poker game going on. \nHOPPIN' BOB Okay, ladies, got some fresh meat for ya! \nAll activity comes to a halt as the new men shuffle into the cage wearing their prison-issue \"ring-arounds.\" Hoppin' Bob slams the metal doors shut behind them. \nHOPPIN' BOB We ain't got no wallflowers at Camp 8. Everybody gotta dance eventually. But don't worry, they won't try nothing tonight. That would take all of the fun outta the courtship. \nThe INCORRIGIBLES hungrily eye the new men in total silence. Claude sticks close to Ray as they shuffle toward their assigned bunks. The CAMERA SETTLES on a much younger WILLIE LONG. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- MORNING \nThe inmates jump down from the mule cart and grab hoes and shovels. Because he can't count, Hoppin' Bob keeps track of the men using a system all his own -- a PEBBLE in his pocket for each man. Dillard stands by with his shotgun. \nDILLARD Got three miles of ditch to clear today. Let's keep it moving! \n", "test2_true": "The men of Camp 8 labor under the brutal mid-day sun. JANGLE LEG, a handsome, muscular man, sings a verse to set the work tempo. Up and down the line, a mighty chorus responds. The CAMERA FINDS Ray and Claude swinging pick axes, sweating profusely. \nCLAUDE I don't believe this before Abe jive. I didn't go to night school to sing in no Mississippi Boys Choir! \nClaude stops to catch his breath and take off his shirt. \nRAY I wouldn't do that if I was you. \nCLAUDE Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway? \nA SHOT rings out. Claude hits the ground as a bullet kicks up some dust nearby. \nRAY Told ya. \nClaude looks up to see Dillard cracking pistachio nuts as Hoppin' Bob puts another round in the chamber of his rifle. \nDILLARD Why ain't his pick swinging? \nHOPPIN' BOB (echoing) Why ain't that pick swinging? \nCLAUDE It's too hot, boss. I'm tired. \nHOPPIN' BOB He says it's too hot, boss. \nDILLARD Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments. \nHOPPIN' BOB Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your... (off Dillard's look) metropolitan assets! \nDILLARD Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown. \nHOPPIN' BOB State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?! \nCLAUDE I got it... boss. \nDILLARD He don't sound like he's from 'round here. \nHOPPIN' BOB He's from New York City. That one, too. \nDILLARD New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here. \nRAY We noticed. \nAnnoyed, Dillard jabs the butt of his rifle into Ray's solar plexus. Ray sinks to his knees in the dirt. \nDILLARD Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for? \nHOPPIN' BOB Judge gave 'em the long ride. \nDILLARD Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast. \nDillard swaggers off, dogged at the heels by the ever faithful Hoppin' Bob. Resigned, Ray and Claude return to their labor. \nEXT. DITCH -- DAY \nThe men rest in the ditch as BISCUIT, a slight inmate with a red bandanna tied around his head, dispenses water, one ladle per man. \nBISCUIT Drink it up! \nWillie exchanges two cigarettes for a second ladle. POKER FACE pulls a crumpled envelope from his shirt. His expression never changes, hence the name. \nPOKER FACE Either of you new fellas know how to read? I've had this letter four months now. \nCLAUDE You can't read? None of these guys can read? \nWILLIE Last fella who could read made parole 'round Christmas. \nPOKER FACE I don't even know who this is from. \nRAY Here, gimme that. \nRay unfolds the letter and scans it. \nRAY It's from your mama's neighbor, Mrs. Tidwell. She thought you oughta know that your second cousin Bo died. \nThe prisoners express their condolences. \"Sorry, man.\" \"That's some bad news.\" \"I know you loved Bo like a brother...\" \nRAY And your other cousin, Sally, on your daddy's side, she died. \nMore sympathy from the men. \"Ooh. Twice in one letter.\" \"Rough break, Poker Face...\" \nRAY Apparently, your sister died. \nPOKER FACE Jenny? \nRAY No, it says Marleen here. \n", "test2_id": 361, "test3_input": "Hoppin' Bob empties his canteen over their faces. They sputter back to consciousness. \nHOPPIN' BOB Now you girls set aside your differences and get back to work or I'll see to it -- \nRAY -- we'll spend a night in the hole. We heard this shit before. \nRay and Claude stagger to their feet and pick up their tools. Hoppin' Bob and the trusties head back up the hill. Ray starts to chuckle. \nCLAUDE What the fuck are you laughing about? \nRay opens his palm to reveal TWO PEBBLES. Claude regards Ray with new-found respect. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- SUNDOWN \nOne by one, the prisoners of Camp 8 climb into the mule carts under the watchful eye of Hoppin' Bob. As each man passes, he removes a pebble from his pocket. The last one in is Willie. Hoppin' Bob's pocket is now empty. \nHOPPIN' BOB All in, boss! \nDILLARD Move it out. \nHOPPIN' BOB Movin' it out, boss. \nDillard spurs his horse, escorting the mule carts back to camp. \nEXT. FIELD -- SUNDOWN \nAs the carts fade into the distance, Ray and Claude pop up from a roadside ditch and take off for a grove of trees in the opposite direction. \nEXT. WOODS -- SUNDOWN \nRunning for all they're worth, Ray and Claude crash through the bramble. Claude trips over a root and sprawls face first in the bushes. Ray turns around and helps him to his feet. Claude is still laughing giddily. He throws his arms around Ray. \nCLAUDE You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City! \nRAY New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay? \nAs Ray and Claude disappear into the woods... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BUNKHOUSE -- NIGHT \nRadio's pulling in some jazz music out of New Orleans. Prisoners hit their bunks as the floorwalker does the nightly head count. He stops at Claude and Ray's empty bunks, glancing around, puzzled. \nEXT. DILLARD'S PORCH -- NIGHT \nDillard smokes a cigarette on the swing. His wife steps out with a fresh bourbon and ice. Suddenly, SIRENS start to wail and emergency floodlights blaze to life at Camp 8. \nEXT. FIELD -- NIGHT \nHounds scramble down from the back of a truck and gather around the DOG BOY. He holds out a handful of soiled laundry and a dozen snouts sniff it thoroughly. \nNearby, Dillard gathers a DOZEN MEN with rifles and flashlights into a posse. He puts a cigarette in his mouth. Hoppin' Bob lights it for him. \nEXT. WOODS -- NIGHT \nTrees rise ominously around Ray and Claude as they push through dense underbrush. \nCLAUDE I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going? \nRAY Absolutely. The map is very clear. \nCLAUDE Let me take a look at that map. \nClaude considers it from various angles. \nCLAUDE You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this? \nRAY Cookie didn't draw it. I did. \nCLAUDE You drew this?! \nRAY I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map. \nCLAUDE That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going! \nRay shrugs and presses on. Dumbfounded, Claude considers the map again, then tears it to shreds. The braying of hounds echoes through the trees. \nCLAUDE Hey, wait up! \nEXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \nRay and Claude race through the underbrush. \nEXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \nRay and Claude race up to a chain-link fence. On the other side, an old Ford is parked on a dirt road. Hearing the posse closing in behind them, Ray and Claude fling themselves onto the fence. \nEXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \nThe posse is gaining ground. Dillard takes two men off to the left, sending the rest of the men straight ahead. \nEXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \nClaude clears the fence first and scrambles for the old Ford. Ray's shirt snags on a piece of wire as he drops down from the fence. Stuck, he dangles helplessly a few feet off the ground. \nINT. FORD -- NIGHT \nClaude yanks open the door and jumps behind the wheel. TWO WHITE TEENAGERS bolt up in the backseat where they were necking. After a beat -- group scream. The half-dressed teenagers dive from the car and scramble off down the road. Claude twists the key in the ignition and the engine roars to life. \nCLAUDE Come on, Ray, time to go! \nRAY I'm stuck! \nClaude sees Ray caught up on the fence, then hears the sounds of the approaching posse. If he floored it right now, he might make it. But he can't just leave Ray hanging there. \nEXT. FENCE -- NIGHT \nClaude runs up and grabs Ray's legs, pulling for all he's worth. The shirt rips free, sending Ray and Claude tumbling to the ground. They leap to their feet and turn toward the car -- running smack into the barrel of Dillard's shotgun. \nEXT. SUPERINTENDENT'S MANSION -- DAY \nAn OLD BLACK PRISONER delivers a frosty mint julep to SUPERINTENDENT ABERNATHY who rocks slowly in his chair. At his feet, his 10-year-old daughter MAE ROSE is playing jacks. Her long blonde hair makes her look like a little angel. \nMAE ROSE Look, daddy. They caught those two men who escaped last night. \nMae Rose is pointing down the drive, where Dillard and a couple of trusties march Ray and Claude toward the house. \nABERNATHY They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger? \nMAE ROSE Nagger? \nABERNATHY No, nigger. \nMAE ROSE Nigger. \nABERNATHY That's my girl. \nBound by leg irons and handcuffs, Ray and Claude are deposited at the bottom of the stairs. \nDILLARD Here they are, Superintendent. We tracked 'em all the way to the Tallahachie. \nABERNATHY That's quite a ways. I'm glad you New York boys could see some of our lovely countryside while you're down here. What do you say, Mae Rose? How should we teach these two a lesson? \nMae Rose considers their faces. Ray and Claude look like they've been to hell and back. \nMAE ROSE A night in the hole? \nABERNATHY Better make it a week. \nDillard nods and turns Ray and Claude around. As they march back down the drive, Abernathy takes sip of his mint julep and affectionately pats Mae Rose on the head. \nEXT. CAMP 8 -- DAY \nThe incorrigibles of Camp 8 gather at the gun line, watching silently as Dillard and a couple of trusties march Ray and Claude toward the hole. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nThe trusties shove them each into a small, dank cell and slam the doors behind them. Dillard secures both doors with an iron bar. \nDILLARD See you in a week, boys. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. RAY'S CELL -- DAY \nRay slumps to the floor, propping his feet against the wall. \nRAY Hey, Claude. I just want to say thanks for coming back for me. \nINT. CLAUDE'S CELL -- DAY \nClaude considers his bleak surroundings. It's a small, uncomfortable space, not even big enough to lie down. Just a tin bucket for a toilet. \nCLAUDE Don't mention it. \nRAY (off) Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now... \n", "test3_id": 362}

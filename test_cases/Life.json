They sputter back to consciousness. \nHOPPIN' BOB Now you girls set aside your differences and get back to work or I'll see to it -- \nRAY -- we'll spend a night in the hole. We heard this shit before. \nRay and Claude stagger to their feet and pick up their tools. Hoppin' Bob and the trusties head back up the hill. Ray starts to chuckle. \nCLAUDE What the fuck are you laughing about? \nRay opens his palm to reveal TWO PEBBLES. Claude regards Ray with new-found respect. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- SUNDOWN \nOne by one, the prisoners of Camp 8 climb into the mule carts under the watchful eye of Hoppin' Bob. As each man passes, he removes a pebble from his pocket. The last one in is Willie. Hoppin' Bob's pocket is now empty. \nHOPPIN' BOB All in, boss! \nDILLARD Move it out. \nHOPPIN' BOB Movin' it out, boss. \nDillard spurs his horse, escorting the mule carts back to camp. \nEXT. FIELD -- SUNDOWN \nAs the carts fade into the distance, Ray and Claude pop up from a roadside ditch and take off for a grove of trees in the opposite direction. \nEXT. WOODS -- SUNDOWN \nRunning for all they're worth, Ray and Claude crash through the bramble. Claude trips over a root and sprawls face first in the bushes. Ray turns around and helps him to his feet. Claude is still laughing giddily. He throws his arms around Ray. \nCLAUDE You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City! \nRAY New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay? \nAs Ray and Claude disappear into the woods... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BUNKHOUSE -- NIGHT \nRadio's pulling in some jazz music out of New Orleans. Prisoners hit their bunks as the floorwalker does the nightly head count. He stops at Claude and Ray's empty bunks, glancing around, puzzled. \nEXT. DILLARD'S PORCH -- NIGHT \nDillard smokes a cigarette on the swing. His wife steps out with a fresh bourbon and ice. Suddenly, SIRENS start to wail and emergency floodlights blaze to life at Camp 8. \nEXT. FIELD -- NIGHT \nHounds scramble down from the back of a truck and gather around the DOG BOY. He holds out a handful of soiled laundry and a dozen snouts sniff it thoroughly. \nNearby, Dillard gathers a DOZEN MEN with rifles and flashlights into a posse. He puts a cigarette in his mouth. Hoppin' Bob lights it for him. \nEXT. WOODS -- NIGHT \nTrees rise ominously around Ray and Claude as they push through dense underbrush. \nCLAUDE I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going? \nRAY Absolutely. The map is very clear. \nCLAUDE Let me take a look at that map. \nClaude considers it from various angles. \nCLAUDE You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this? \nRAY Cookie didn't draw it. I did. \nCLAUDE You drew this?! \nRAY I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map. \nCLAUDE That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going! \nRay shrugs and presses on. Dumbfounded, Claude considers the map again, then tears it to shreds. The braying of hounds echoes through the trees. \nCLAUDE Hey, wait up! \nEXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \nRay and Claude race through the underbrush. \nEXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \nRay and Claude race up to a chain-link fence. On the other side, an old Ford is parked on a dirt road. Hearing the posse closing in behind them, Ray and Claude fling themselves onto the fence. \nEXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \nThe posse is gaining ground. Dillard takes two men off to the left, sending the rest of the men straight ahead. \nEXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT \nClaude clears the fence first and scrambles for the old Ford. Ray's shirt snags on a piece of wire as he drops down from the fence. Stuck, he dangles helplessly a few feet off the ground. \nINT. FORD -- NIGHT \nClaude yanks open the door and jumps behind the wheel. TWO WHITE TEENAGERS bolt up in the backseat where they were necking. After a beat -- group scream. The half-dressed teenagers dive from the car and scramble off down the road. Claude twists the key in the ignition and the engine roars to life. \nCLAUDE Come on, Ray, time to go! \nRAY I'm stuck! \nClaude sees Ray caught up on the fence, then hears the sounds of the approaching posse. If he floored it right now, he might make it. But he can't just leave Ray hanging there. \nEXT. FENCE -- NIGHT \nClaude runs up and grabs Ray's legs, pulling for all he's worth. The shirt rips free, sending Ray and Claude tumbling to the ground. They leap to their feet and turn toward the car -- running smack into the barrel of Dillard's shotgun. \nEXT. SUPERINTENDENT'S MANSION -- DAY \nAn OLD BLACK PRISONER delivers a frosty mint julep to SUPERINTENDENT ABERNATHY who rocks slowly in his chair. At his feet, his 10-year-old daughter MAE ROSE is playing jacks. Her long blonde hair makes her look like a little angel. \nMAE ROSE Look, daddy. They caught those two men who escaped last night. \nMae Rose is pointing down the drive, where Dillard and a couple of trusties march Ray and Claude toward the house. \nABERNATHY They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger? \nMAE ROSE Nagger? \nABERNATHY No, nigger. \nMAE ROSE Nigger. \nABERNATHY That's my girl. \nBound by leg irons and handcuffs, Ray and Claude are deposited at the bottom of the stairs. \nDILLARD Here they are, Superintendent. We tracked 'em all the way to the Tallahachie. \nABERNATHY That's quite a ways. I'm glad you New York boys could see some of our lovely countryside while you're down here. What do you say, Mae Rose? How should we teach these two a lesson? \nMae Rose considers their faces. Ray and Claude look like they've been to hell and back. \nMAE ROSE A night in the hole? \nABERNATHY Better make it a week. \nDillard nods and turns Ray and Claude around. As they march back down the drive, Abernathy takes sip of his mint julep and affectionately pats Mae Rose on the head. \nEXT. CAMP 8 -- DAY \nThe incorrigibles of Camp 8 gather at the gun line, watching silently as Dillard and a couple of trusties march Ray and Claude toward the hole. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nThe trusties shove them each into a small, dank cell and slam the doors behind them. Dillard secures both doors with an iron bar. \nDILLARD See you in a week, boys. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. RAY'S CELL -- DAY \nRay slumps to the floor, propping his feet against the wall. \nRAY Hey, Claude. I just want to say thanks for coming back for me. \nINT. CLAUDE'S CELL -- DAY \nClaude considers his bleak surroundings. It's a small, uncomfortable space, not even big enough to lie down. Just a tin bucket for a toilet. \nCLAUDE Don't mention it. \nRAY (off) Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now... \n", "test1_id": 360, "test2_input": "CLAUDE I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nThe sun beats down on the tin roofs... \nINT. BUNKHOUSE -- CAGE -- NIGHT \nThe prisoners are gathered around a table, laying out money. As usual, Poker Face is keeping tabs. \nCOOKIE I'll take Claude to die on Wednesday for fifty cents. \nPOKER FACE Wednesday for two bits. And don't forget you already owe me a steak. \nBISCUIT I'll take Claude for Friday. That's my birthday. \nWith an ear to his receiver, Radio slaps his money on the table. \nRADIO Weatherman says a heat wave's coming. I say neither one of 'em son of bitches gonna last past Thursday. \nPOKER FACE I told you before, I don't take pennies. Two cigarettes or one nickel minimum. What about you, Willie? Gonna get in on this action? \nWILLIE I got a crispy new dollar bill says both of them gonna make it. \nThis gives the men pause. Willie tosses his money on the table. \nPOKER FACE Now that's what I call a bet. \nGOLDMOUTH It's a mighty long shot, Willie. Nobody ever made it a week in the hole. \nJANGLE LEG Not in August, anyway. \nBut Willie leaves the money where it is. \nPOKER FACE Who else has some guts around here? \nPoker Face makes notations as the betting resumes. \nEXT. FIELD -- DAY \nWork goes on as usual for the prisoners of Camp 8. Trusties keep their eyes peeled for slackers. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nThe brick shacks bake in the noonday sun. \nEXT. FIELD -- DAY \nBiscuit moves down the line offering the ladle to the men as they struggle under a crushing heat wave. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nSuperintendent Abernathy strides up and gives the nod to Dillard, who unlocks the doors. Huddled in their respective cells, Ray and Claude shrink from the bright sunlight. Then, slowly and painfully, they rise to their feet. \nIn the background, the incorrigibles gather at the gun line as word spreads that the fellows are still alive. Abernathy glances at the crowd with annoyance. \nABERNATHY I don't think these boys have learned their lesson. Let's give 'em another week for good measure. \nDILLARD Sure you want to do that, sir? \nABERNATHY Don't you ever question me, Sgt. Dillard. When I give an order, you jump to it, or I'll kick you and that first-cousin you call a wife outta that pretty little house so fast it'll make your pin-head spin. You got that? \nDILLARD Yes, sir. \nDillard slams the doors on Ray and Claude and clamps shut the padlocks. Abernathy smiles at the incorrigibles, who regard him with undisguised hatred. \nAT THE GUN LINE \nA somber Poker Face offers Willie a wad of bills. \nPOKER FACE Well, they made it a week. Looks like you win, Willie. \nWILLIE Let it ride. \nINT. CLAUDE'S CELL -- NIGHT \nA slot at the bottom of the door opens. A tin plate of mush slides through and the slot closes. Slumped in the corner, Claude reaches for the food -- but a RAT beats him to it, scampering out of the shadows and leaping onto the dish. \nINT. RAY'S CELL -- NIGHT \nA commotion and wild screams come from Claude's cell. Ray leaps to his feet, shouting through the wall. \nRAY Claude? You alright?! \nINT. CLAUDE'S CELL -- NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "CLAUDE Can't take it no more, Ray! Die, motherfucker! Gotta get the fuck outta here! \nClaude pounds against the door, raising a holy racket. We continue to cut back and forth between cells as needed. \nRAY Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure. \nCLAUDE He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck! \nClaude continues shouting and pounding. \nRAY All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon. \nCLAUDE How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?! \nRay looks around his cell. Claude's pounding is bound to wake up somebody soon. \nRAY We'll just get off at the next stop. \nCLAUDE (stops pounding, confused) Say what? \nRAY That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now. \nCLAUDE The hell you talking about? What train? \nRAY We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street. \nClaude focuses on what Ray is saying and starts to breathe easier. \nCLAUDE Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium. \nRAY Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox. \nCLAUDE Red Sox... Who's on the mound? \nRAY I don't know. Who do you want? \nCLAUDE Allie Reynolds. He's my boy. \nRAY Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats? \nCLAUDE I know people. \nRAY They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh? \nCLAUDE You get ketchup? \nRAY Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want. \nCLAUDE I can't eat it with mustard. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- NIGHT \nDillard strides toward the hole, shotgun in hand. He pauses to listen to the argument, cocking an eyebrow in befuddlement. \nRAY (off) Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself. \nCLAUDE (off) What am I gonna eat? \nRAY (off) You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start. \nCLAUDE (off) Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today? \nRAY (off) Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...! \nDillard shakes his head, shoulders his gun and heads back toward his house. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nAbernathy gives the nod to Dillard, who unlocks the doors. Two trusties drag Ray and Claude out of their cells. \nINT. BUNKHOUSE -- DAY \nThe men crowd around the windows. \nRADIO What's going on? Are they alive or dead? \nGOLDMOUTH Don't look too good. \nPOKER FACE They're not moving. \nEXT. THE HOLE -- DAY \nSlowly, Claude opens his eyes, squinting in the harsh light of day. Summoning his strength, he staggers to his feet. \nCLAUDE Hey, Ray... \n", "test2_id": 361, "test3_input": "CLAUDE Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station. \nRay scowls as Claude straightens his chauffeur uniform and heads up the path to the mansion. \nEXT. GREENVILLE BUS STATION -- DAY \nClaude pulls up in front of the station, steps out of the car and holds the door for Wilkins, who checks his watch. \nWILKINS You know I trust you, Claude. \nCLAUDE Yes, sir. \nWILKINS I'll be right back. \nWilkins heads into the station, leaving Claude alone with the Continental. All around him are the sights, sounds and smells of the free world. A woman rushes into the arms of a man as he climbs off a bus. Across the street is Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint where Cookie never made it to the peach cobbler. A young brother with a boom box walks by. In the street, kids crowd around the back of an ice cream truck. Then Claude catches his reflection in the car window and frowns. When did he get this old? Unnerved, he moves around to the back of the car and pops open the trunk. \nRAY (sitting up) Damn, it was getting hot in there. \nCLAUDE What the hell are you doing in that trunk?! \nRAY You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you? \nCLAUDE I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you. \nRAY Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk. \nCLAUDE You ain't getting out of that trunk. \nRAY Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here. (Ray struggles out of the trunk) We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go! \nCLAUDE Go where, Ray? \nRAY Back to New York for starters. \nCLAUDE And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man. \nRAY This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys. \nCLAUDE Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car. \nRAY Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys. \nCLAUDE I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride. \nRAY Don't make me take them away from you. \nCLAUDE Hey, there's Wilkins! \nRay looks, Claude clocks him. Ray slumps back into the trunk. Claude stuffs Ray's legs back into the trunk and slams the lid. \nCLAUDE Who's driving now, bitch? \nHe looks up just as Wilkins and the new superintendent exit the bus station. Warren Pike's hair has gone grey and he's 40 years older, but there's no mistaking the former sheriff of Natchez County. He still bears a nasty scar on his cheek from a wound inflicted long ago. \nCLAUDE'S POV -- Pike appears as a young man in his sheriff's uniform striding slowly toward him. \nClaude blinks and looks again. Pike has returned to his old self as he and Wilkins step up. \nPIKE (dropping his bags) There you go, boy. \nOblivious, Pike climbs into the back seat. Wilkins nods to Claude. \nWILKINS Come on, Claude, time to go. \nClaude snaps to it, grabbing the bags. He considers opening the trunk, but decides to carry them around to the front seat with him. \nEXT. KITCHEN PORCH -- DUSK \nBacks to the CAMERA, Ray and Claude urinate, presumably off the porch. \nRAY You sure it was him? \nCLAUDE Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em. \nRAY I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now. \nCLAUDE We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe. \nRAY I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one. \nINT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT \nWilkins pours a frosty drink and offers it to Pike. \nWILKINS Lemonade? \n", "test3_true": "WILKINS I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house. \nPIKE Well, fortunately, I carry my own. \nPike pulls a flask from his jacket and tilts it high. Claude enters from the kitchen with the two steaming bowls of gumbo. \nWILKINS Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots. \nPIKE You don't have to twist my arm. (digging in) Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick. \nWILKINS Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight. \nCLAUDE Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike. \nWILKINS Goodnight, Claude. \nPike nods coldly. Claude steps back into the kitchen. \nPIKE If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy. \nWILKINS I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean. \nPIKE (sarcastic) Respect? Well, isn't that progressive. \nWILKINS If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict. \nPike curls his lip with disdain before taking a healthy spoonful of gumbo. \nEXT. MARSH -- DAY \nClaude and Ray beat the bullrushes with switches. Amid a flutter of wings, three pheasants take to the air. Wilkins fires first, knocking one out the sky. Pike pulls off two rounds, playing clean up. \nEXT. FIELD -- DAY \nRay and Claude dump their game bags into the back of a pickup truck. Nearby, Pike drains his flask while Wilkins scrapes mud off his boots. The breeze picks up, clouds fill the sky. \nWILKINS Well, that's a pretty good haul. What do you say, Mr. Pike? Ready to call it a day? \nPike pulls a gold watch from his pocket and releases the face plate. A familiar mechanical tune floats on the gathering breeze. Ray turns around slowly. His eyes fall on the watch in Pike's hand. His daddy's watch. In Pike's hand. \nPIKE Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath. \nRAY That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune. \nPIKE Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore. \nRAY Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it? \nPIKE Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back. \nClaude looks at the watch, then at Ray. Uh oh. \nRAY Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years? \nPIKE (eyes narrowing) Something like that, yes. \nRAY She give you that scar, too? \nPike thrusts the barrel of his gun up under Ray's chin. \nPIKE I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy. \nRAY Like you shot Winston Hancock? \nWilkins turns to see Pike holding Ray at gunpoint. \nWILKINS What's going on here? \nPIKE I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners. \nRAY That's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you. \nRay grabs the barrel of the shotgun and slams it into Pike's face. Pike rolls over and freezes, staring down the barrel of his own gun now in Ray's hands. Confused, Wilkins points his gun at Ray. \nCLAUDE Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble. \nWILKINS He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out. \nRAY I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head. \nPIKE Shoot him, Wilkins! \nCLAUDE Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this. (cautiously) Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around. \nRAY He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike. \n", "test3_id": 362}

CONTINUED: 
NELL The slutty girl who works at the make-up counter? 
RONNIE Yeah, I mean, no, she's not a slut. But you're thinking of the right person. 
NELL How could you do this to me? 
RONNIE I'm sorry. I don't mean to hurt you. It's just, well, I believe in this world, you play the hand you're dealt and at this point in my life, I've been dealt five Aces. I'd be a fool not to bet. 
NELL Why are you doing this, Ronnie? 
RONNIE I have to, Nell. 
NELL Don't you love me? 
RONNIE Of course I love you. 
NELL Then tell me why? 
RONNIE Because I've never dated the prom queen before. 
NELL Remember when you started this job? You weren't such a hotshot then. I've stood by you when you were at your worst. Every time you fell, I held your hand and told you everything would be okay. Time and time again. 
RONNIE Come on.   Why do you have to bring that up? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NELL I never cared about who you wanted to be, I fell in love with who you really are. If you leave me, Ronnie, I won't be there to pick you up when you fall. 
RONNIE Even if I do fall, it won't matter, because I'm learning to fly. 
Ronnie stands up and walks away. Nell sits there sad. She looks down at her Cinnabon and devours the whole thing. 
INT. MALL - MAURICE'S FOR MEN - DAY 
Ronnie looks through a clothing rack. It's full of cheap fabrics, lots of imitation silks and shit. A SLICK SALESMAN approaches Ronnie. 
SLICK SALESMAN Can I help you, sir? 
RONNIE Yeah, um, I've got a really special date tonight with a hot young lady -- Do you know Brandi? 
SLICK SALESMAN No. 
RONNIE Never mind. Anyway, I need something that's really 'cool.' Something that will impress her and I guess you could say I'm not exactly in the know with what the hipsters are up to these days. 
SLICK SALESMAN Let's see. Are you looking to fall in love or are you looking to get laid? 
RONNIE Um, I guess love, but uh... 
SLICK SALESMAN You want to get laid, too? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Watch it, man.     She's a lady.   But yes. 
SLICK SALESMAN Alright, I got just the thing. Something classy is what you want. Show her you're a man with taste. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Ronnie's Mom sits on his bed with a bottle of Wild Turkey. She waits for Ronnie to come out of the closet. 
MOM Come on, Ronnie, just get out here. 
RONNIE It's too tight in the butt. 
MOM Let me see. 
Ronnie comes out of the closet and he's wearing a ridiculous fucking outfit. It's an imitation silk button up, with a pair of black parachute pants. There's two belts for some DOUBLE BELT action. He's got no socks on and a pair of white shoes. He looks like a goddamn fool. 
MOM Ronnie, you look so handsome! RONNIE Really, you don't think I look like a phony. 
MOM Hell no.   You look like a stud muffin. 
RONNIE Yeah, I guess these clothes are kind of cool. 
MOM Nell is a lucky girl. 
RONNIE Its not Nell, Mom.

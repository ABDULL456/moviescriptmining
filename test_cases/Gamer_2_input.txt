90   EXT. SPAWN POINT #4 - MOMENTS LATER                                90 
KABLE breaks the DAYLIGHT - but without a smooth LEAP AND ROLL, and no ROCKSTAR POSE - instead, he TRIPS and tumbles ASS OVER END down an embankment, landing in a heap at the bottom. 
SIMON (O.S.) (sarcastic) I can see turning you loose was a great idea. 
KABLE (woozy) What happened. 
SIMON (O.S.) YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control, you got it. 
KABLE tests his hands, clenching and unclenching - THE KID WASN'T LYING ... while starting to trip hard on the VODKA, which is kicking in INSTANTLY... 
KABLE No shit... 
SIMON (O.S.) Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up... 
An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DIRT just a few feet away, BLINDING, DEAFENING - and KABLE shifts into ANOTHER WORLD... 
91   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4                                       91 
He's MOVING FAST... SOUND is just an idea, disconnected from reality... BODIES AND BULLETS drift by without gravity... his vision doubles and bleeds... 
SIMON (O.S.) What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something! 
BLUES. Lots of them.        KABLE starts shooting wildly - HITTING NOTHING. 
(CONTINUED) 
WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 91   CONTINUED:                                                          91 
SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) This is unbelievable. 
92   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4                                        92 
KABLE is running erratically at least... hard to HIT... but definitely HEADED SOMEWHERE. 
A SHELL SMACKS KABLE'S shoulder, knocking him off his feet; the armor absorbs it, but he's out of time... he's shooting air... 
SIMON (O.S.) (frustrated) Fuck it. 
We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER... 
KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves down on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss cheese. 
Too close. 
SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) (the voice of reason) Kable. Listen: it's the last game. You're going to be dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole if you don't pull your balls together! 
KABLE Blow me. 
He scrambles to his feet and charges for the entrance to the UNDERGROUND GARAGE. 
SIMON (O.S.) Dammit! 
93   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER                      93 
KABLE slams open a door marked P4 and stumbles into the CAR GRAVEYARD... 
Reality is ROARING, SPINNING... KABLE slams into the side of a parked car, legs rubber... he looks it over - TIRES FLAT, NO GOOD... he stumbles to the next, then another... another... his head hits a passenger side window, SPIDERWEBBING IT...

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 93   CONTINUED:                                                                    93 
FINALLY, the ONE: A FORD F-250 SUPER CHIEF... GUN METAL GREY, PRISTINE. 
Note: the F-250 is a CONCEPT TRUCK - a future design for FORD'S F-line. In our world this is a 2009 factory model, which makes it old, but not antique. The truck is about as BADASS as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH A BUILDING OR TWO. 
KABLE gets to the FUEL CAP DOOR and pries it open... ENGRAVED under the cap is a prominent WARNING: 
Ethanol Only 
SIMON (O.S.) Kable. Dude. What are you doing? 
KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat. 
Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK. 
SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) What the hell? 
He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain down the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KABLE brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING. His head is clearing. 
KABLE looks around, unzips his pants and PISSES INTO THE TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless. 
KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he's regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS THE IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK... 
BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole into the dashboard. 
KABLE checks what's left of the mirror.               HACKMAN and six other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast. 
SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) GO, GO, GO!

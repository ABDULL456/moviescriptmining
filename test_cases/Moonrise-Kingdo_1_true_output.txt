Suzy bites her fingernails. She shrugs. 
SAM How come? 
Pause. Suzy says philosophically: 
SUZY Well, I can show you an example, if you want -- but it doesn't make me feel very good. I found this on top of our refrigerator. 
Suzy looks into her leather folder and shuffles through some pages. She withdraws a small pamphlet. 
INSERT: 
The cover of the pamphlet. There is a drawing of a broken tea- cup and the title "Coping with the Very Troubled Child". 
Sam frowns. His eyes widen. 
SAM Does that mean you? 
Suzy nods. Sam explodes with laughter. 
SUZY It's not funny. 
SAM To me, it is. 
Sam slaps his knee and shakes his head. Pause. Suzy dumps her fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a frisbee into a tree trunk. It bounces off with a ding. She stands up and says coolly: 
SUZY You really know how to make friends. 
Suzy walks away. She goes behind a bush and sits down on a rock. She starts to cry. Sam looks stricken and confused. He is very still. He gets up slowly. He tentatively approaches the bush. He looks behind it. He takes two steps closer. He stands above Suzy. He unties his neckerchief, crouches down, and holds it out. 
SAM I'm sorry. 
Suzy looks to Sam. She hesitates. She takes the neckerchief. 
SUZY That's OK. 
SAM I'm on your side. 
SUZY I know. 
Suzy dries her eyes. She unfolds the neckerchief and studies its design. It is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning off the side of a galloping horse. Sam motions to the books: 
SAM Which one's the best? 
CUT TO: 
Dusk. Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud from a book called The Francine Odyssies. There is an illustration on the cover of an enormous panther with a bloody sword walking behind a small girl in a nightgown. 
SUZY His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the rippling surface of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor. "My people once were lead by a great and noble beast -- and I no longer see his face in this reflection." 
Suzy looks to Sam. He is asleep. She takes the pipe out of his mouth and tips the ashes into the camp-fire. She draws a blanket over his chest. She continues: 
SUZY Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested. There would be another time for war. 
INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT 
The dining room. There is a long, wide, empty table with sixteen chairs around it. Tucked in the corner, Lionel, Murray, and Rudy sit at a folding card table. They have plates on place-mats and forks and knives. There is one extra seat. Mrs. Bishop's voice booms, amplified, from the next ROOM: 
MRS. BISHOP (O.S.) Suzy! Dinner! I'm not going to say it again! 
Pause. Mrs. Bishop charges into the room with a steaming casserole. She wears an oven mitt on one hand and carries an electric megaphone in the other. She sets the casserole on the card table and looks out the window. Through the thicket 
of trees behind the house, a pair of headlights blinks. Mrs. Bishop checks her watch. She says sharply: 
MRS. BISHOP Where's your sister? 
LIONEL I don't know, but she borrowed my record player for ten days without asking. 
MRS. BISHOP (CONFUSED) What does that mean? 
Lionel holds up a small, folded-up piece of pink stationary. Mrs. Bishop snaps it out of his hand and opens it.

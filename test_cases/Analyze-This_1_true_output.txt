BEN He's not leaving. 
CARL (trembling) Three hundred. 
JELLY (pays him) You're not that fuckin' crazy. 
Carl takes the money, gives Ben the thumbs up and exits. Jelly follows him to the door and waves for someone to come in. 
BEN Listen, if you're upset about your car, I can understand that. But you don't just barge in here -- 
Paul Vitti steps into the office.    Ben freezes.   Jelly crosses to take Vitti's coat. 
VITTI You know who I am?

BEN Yes. 
VITTI No you don't. 
BEN Okay. 
VITTI You've seen my picture in the papers? 
BEN Yes.    And no.    Sometimes.   Never. 
VITTI Jelly, wait outside. 
Jelly exits. Vitti walks around the room, taking everything in. He picks up the phone and listens.          Hangs up. 
VITTI Sit down. 
BEN Sure. 
Ben sits quickly on the coffee table. He crushes a box of tissues, then moves them out from under his ass. Vitti picks up a stack of CDS and looks through them. 
VITTI Tony Bennett, huh? 
BEN Yeah.   He's my favorite. 
Vitti picks up an autographed baseball bat from Ben's desk. 
BEN (puts up his hands) Mr. Vitti, I tried to give the guy my insurance information, but he wouldn't take it. Seriously, I tried several times because it was all my please don't kill me. 
VITTI I was just gonna ask if you liked baseball. 
(CONTINUED)

BEN Yes.   Big Yankee fan. 
Vitti puts the bat down. 
BEN Mr. Vitti. Not that it's your fault, but your friend, he interrupted a patient's session and that's -- not good. I think this is a matter for our insurance companies, don't you think? 
VITTI I don't care about the car. 
BEN Then what -- ? 
VITTI A friend of mine is having a problem and he might have to see a shrink, so I'm going to ask you a couple questions. Do we sit? 
BEN Whatever makes you comfortable. 
Ben starts for his chair, but Vitti sits in it first. Ben sits on the couch. Vitti adjusts the cuffs of his shirt, and runs a hand down the crease in his slacks. 
VITTI Okay, the first thing I gotta know about is privacy. You must hear a lot of weird shit in here. How do I know you won't go testifying -- not testifying -- but, you know, talking about it to somebody else. 
BEN I won't discuss a patient with anyone for any reason, unless I know the patient may be a danger to himself. Like if I'm concerned a patient might kill himself... 
VITTI Not fuckin' likely -- 
BEN -- or kill someone else. 
(CONTINUED) 
22   CONTINUED:    (5)                                                22 
Ben looks to Vitti for a response.    Vitti stares at him for a long, uncomfortable beat. 
VITTI So who starts? 
BEN Why don't you tell me why you think you need therapy? 
VITTI I don't need therapy. I'm helping out my friend. You didn't hear me say that? 
BEN Right.   I'm sorry. 
VITTI You guys are supposed to be so great when it comes to listening. You can't remember what I said two seconds ago. 
BEN I'm very sorry. 
VITTI I have to tell you, Doc, I'm not thrilled with the level of service up to this point. 
BEN Why don't you tell me about your friend? 
VITTI He's a powerful guy. Never had a problem dealing with things, you know? Now all of a sudden, he's falling apart. He cries for no reason. He's having trouble sleeping. And then he started having these attacks. You know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest pains -- like you think you're gonna die.

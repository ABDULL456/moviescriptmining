Withnail: The bastards. Justice suck. It's a miserable cheap cigar and the bastards won't see me. I: Why are we having lunch in here? Withnail: It's dinner and Danny's here. I: Danny!? How did he get in? Withnail: I let him in this morning. He lost one of his clogs. He's come in because of the perpetual cold. I hope the buggers sales plummet. I: I've got your savaloy. Here. I don't want it. Withnail: Then stick it in the soap tray and save it for later. 
[He scrunches up the paper that was holding his chips and puts it in the toilet] 
I: Don't vent spleen on me. I'm in the same boat. Withnail: Stop saying that. You're not in the same boat. The only thing you're in that I've been in is this fucking bath. I: Danny's here. Head hunter to his friends. Head hunter to everybody. He doesn't have any friends. The only people he converses with are his clients and occasionally the police. The purveyor of rare herbs and prescribed chemicals is back. Will we never be set free?

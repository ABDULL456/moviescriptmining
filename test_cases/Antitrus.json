{"test1_input": "INT. GARY'S WORKROOM (LAKE VIEW) - MOMENTS LATER \nThey enter. An entire wall is taken-up by a Bosch triptych. As Gary crosses to the other side of the room, Milo stands by a table covered in art books -- hundreds of them (Soutine, Chinoiserie, Roy Lichtenstein...) \nMILO You know a lot about art, I guess. \nGARY There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it. \nGary heads back, carrying something spherical. \nGARY There's more to life than computers? I'm looking into it. \nGlancing down at the daunting display of books, Gary looks vaguely afflicted. He mutters: \nGARY 'Once I start looking into something. \nLooking up now (and much more at ease) he holds up a shiny, detailed metal object: model satellite. \nGARY I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room. (as Milo takes it, carefully) It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up. \nMILO Low enough to relay internet traffic. \nGARY (he smiles: exactly) Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky? \nMILO (turning the sleek object) Skywire. \nINT. GARY'S WORKROOM - LATER \nMilo and Gary peer at a monitor, side-by-side. Milo sips his own Snapple now. Gary speaks his language. \nGARY The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges. \nMILO It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it? \nGARY You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me? \nMilo has a deer-in-the-headlights look. \nMILO ...Ask you? \nINT. GARY'S HOUSE - ANOTHER ROOM - DUSK \nAs they walk, Milo chides himself for his reticence. Gary seems to read his mind. \nGARY I know what people say, and not just the Justice Department. We clone ideas, inflict our second-rate versions on the world, we haven't done anything original since 1.0. \nMilo's amazed by Gary's acuity. And his candor. \nGARY Do I think that's fair? No. I'd put some of our apps up against anybody's. But is there some truth to it? \nThey have come to a stop in a windowed entryway. Milo watches Gary keenly. Gary nods. He knits his brow. \nGARY When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost \nMILO I do! \nGARY (pleased) Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here. (the furrows deepen) But somehow got away. \nEXT. CUPERTINO HILLS (SILICON VALLEY) - NIGHT \nA block of floodlit \"tract mansions,\" Taco Bell palaces of the Valley's newly rich. Milo & Alice cross a vacant lot to where the lights twinkle below. Their '89 Honda Civic is parked nearby. Milo is excited. \nMILO If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too. \nALICE I think that's great, Milo. I do. \nMILO ...But? \nALICE Didn't you visit the campus? \nMILO I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide. \nALICE No way. You have this -- destiny. \nMILO C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating -- \nALICE Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die? \nMILO (shrugs) You saved my life in alot of ways. \nHe's sweet. She kisses him. He holds onto her. \nALICE It's not just Gary that makes you wanna go there? 'Cause it's a big place. You might not even see him again. \nHe'd hate to think that's true. But he manages a smile. \nMILO I know. \nEXT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe Honda is loaded with luggage and boxes, some of which are tied to the roof. Milo & Alice stow a final piece. \nMILO When's Brian coming for the TV? \n", "test1_true": "As they head back in, they see a Toyota park at the curb. \nALICE 'Give you guys some time alone. \nShe continues inside. He waits, watches Teddy cross the sidewalk to join him. \nMILO ...You got my E-mail? \nTEDDY And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime. \nMILO Is that how Larry feels? \nTEDDY Uh. Not exactly. \nA brown Buick parks behind Teddy's car. As they speak, a rumpled, 50ish MAN in an off-the-rack suit gets out. \nMILO Wanted to say goodbye to him... \nTEDDY Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five! \nMilo grins, he high-fives Teddy. \nTEDDY We rented a loft in Sunnyvale. (he gives Milo the number) You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms. \nMILO Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff. \nThey embrace. It's awkward, but it's heartfelt. \nINT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER \nMilo enters, reading Teddy's phone number. \nMILO Guess what? They got their -- \nThe rumpled Man sits on a radiator, watching CNN on a TV, the last remaining piece of furniture. Alice enters, holding a jam jar filled water, hands Milo a business card. \nALICE Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the Justice Department. (gives Barton the water) Sorry about the glass. \nMilo reads the card: Lyle Barton, Asst. Prosecutor, DOJ, Seattle Branch Office. Milo's a little spooked. \nBARTON Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant. \nMILO Right... What's that mean again? \nBARTON Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do. \nMILO (fiddling with the card) It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something... \nBARTON Like I said: shot in the dark. \nMilo tries to give back the card. \nBARTON If you see something there that rubs you the wrong way? Do the right thing. \nAnd he goes. \nMILO That took some fun out of -- \nALICE We're not gonna let it. \nShe kisses him. They head out. We linger. On TV a graphic says: SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA: MASS SUICIDE - LIVE. Emergency Medical Personnel roll gurneys with bodies out of a new Mediterranean mansion. Footage shows bodies (including a few children) on bunkbeds, uniformly shod in black Nikes. \nCNN VOICE -- ingested the fatal mixture of sedatives crushed in apple sauce. According to the cult's eerily professional website, it was \"time to move on...\" \nEXT. OUTPOST CORPORATE CAMPUS - DAY \nCrane past identical, low, steel & glass buildings, amid the vast lawns & fir trees... Past a building under construction... To find Redmond's Lexus, cruising. \nINT./EXT. REDMOND'S CAR/CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS \nMilo looks out the window, Redmond gives the tour: \nREDMOND There're 20 buildings, I mean not counting the Gyms, the Day Care, etc. \nThe Day Care is a Michael Graves-looking building with a big cartoon-dog sculpture on its roof, ears cocked to the sky. A Teacher leads her little charges inside. \nREDMOND Gary's put millions in there. And the people with kids? They're not hotshot geeks, they're just payroll clerks or whatever. \nTwo Men in suits, with briefcases, (conspicuous amid the Geeks in jeans and T-shirts) enter Building #19. \nREDMOND You'll see alot of that: Department of Justice goons snooping around. \nThe car pulls into a lot full of Miatas, BMW's, Boxters. \nCLOSE ON - THE OUTPOST LOGO \nTHEN TILT UP TO SHOW: \nEXT. BUILDING 20 QUAD - DAY \nThe logo is of inlaid stone. Redmond & Milo walk over it. Milo carries a box with some personal effects, including a small painting. Redmond wears a photo I.D. tag. \nREDMOND So how'd you like the house? \n", "test1_id": 537, "test2_input": "MILO His Snapples were in alphabetical order. \nREDMOND (he laughs) Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big... (he opens the door) 'Guess he needs to micro-manage something. \nINT. BLDG. 20 LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nAt the desk, a RECEPTIONIST looks up, stands to hang a temporary ID pass around Milo's neck. \nRECEPTIONIST Milo, I'm Judith. Welcome! \nMilo smiles. Redmond uses his magnetic swipe card on an inner door (a security cam is at every door); he holds the door open for Milo. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThey walk up a long carpeted hallway, past open offices where Geeks (mostly males under 30) sit at workstations. \nREDMOND Everybody has the same office, there's no dumbass corporate hierarchy. \nThey pass a room in which Geeks play video games. Just outside it, a chubby programmer, DESI, sips a Diet Coke. \nDESI Get out while you can, dude! \nREDMOND Desi, Milo. \nDESI The guy who was at Gary's house? \nHe bows deep, with mock-obeisance. Milo blushes, Redmond laughs, he snags Milo's elbow. They walk again, passing a service hall with a Civil Defense sign. \nREDMOND Best bomb shelters in America, accessible from every building. You gotta figure we're a major target, right? \nANOTHER HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER \nUp the hall, a young woman (LISA) is about to go into her office. She pauses half a second, looks at Milo, goes in. She's beautiful. \nREDMOND Whoa. Lisa actually looked at you. \nAs they pass her office, they look in: she's already at her workstation, studiously avoiding their gaze. \nREDMOND Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody. \nMILO (shy, changing the emphasis) She's a programmer? \nREDMOND Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps. (he all but winks) You'll be working with her. \nMILO I've got a girlfriend, remember? \nREDMOND Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost. \nINT. MILO'S OFFICE - MOMENT LATER \nA handsome, modest office like all the others: workstation, whiteboard, window. They enter. \nREDMOND Here's your world. (pointing at the desk) Copy of Gary's book, also the audio version, narrated by Gary. \nMilo puts down his box, picks up the book: The Next Highway (Gary by a highway on its cover). As we look at it: \nVOICE (SHROT) The card's encoded. Tells us who came through the door and when. \nINT. OFFICE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY - LATER \nIn an office with a bank of monitors that play feeds from security cameras, BOB SHROT, 40, Head of Physical Security, issues Milo his swipe card. Redmond watches. \nSHROT Unauthorized entries sound like this. \nHe drags the card through a sample slot, producing an unbelievably loud, piercing EEEEEEEE. He shouts over it: \nSHROT If you see a tailgater, report him. \nMILO Tailgater? \nSHROT (kills the alarm) Somebody coming in on your swipe. (gives Milo a photo ID) You see somebody wandering around without ID, it's your duty to challenge him. I don't give a shit if you're a stock-option billionaire. If you don't challenge, I'll have your butt. \nINT. HALLWAY - LATER \nMILO He seems a little -- tense. \nREDMOND Geeks pull his chain cause he's non- tech. Ex-cop or something. They moon cameras, or use ATM's as swipe cards. The cameras're our real security so he's a little demoralized. \nEXT. BUILDING 20/PARKING LOT - DAY \nAs they walk, Milo watches two Hardhats roll a spool of fiber- optic cable into the building under construction. \nMILO What're they building? \nREDMOND #21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in. \nMILO Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites. \nREDMOND You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested. \nThey approach a 1990 Deux Chevaux, cheap but charming. \nREDMOND Oh, right. Your girlfriend's an artist. \n", "test2_true": "Blond wood, smoked glass -- a room as sleek as the Geeks who lunch here are nerdy. Milo and Redmond push trays. \nREDMOND I phoned her at your hotel, told her about our corporate housing options. She sounds neat. \nLisa's at a table, looking at Milo. When their eyes meet, she busies herself, placing the plates back on her tray. \nMILO ...She is. (turning away from Lisa) She is! \nLisa passes behind them, smiles fleetingly at Milo. At a table, Randy and Phil note the \"interaction.\" Meantime: \nREDMOND 'Might be some friction on the domestic front. You're expected you to put in ridiculous hours. People've accused us of breaking up relationships to get their undivided attention. \nHe laughs. \nINT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nLisa moves swiftly up the hall. She looks up it and down it (making sure no one's looking) before ducking into \nMILO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nShe goes to the box on Milo's desk (his personal effects) -- starts rooting through it. \nINT. CAFETERIA - LATER \nRedmond and Milo have eaten; Redmond stacks their plates. \nREDMOND Your counselor'll fill you in on everything else. That's who you'll be working with almost daily. \nINT. MILO'S OFFICE - LATER \nMilo has fed the old Skywire disks into his machine. He reads a complicated screen. \nVOICE Busy? \nMilo looks up. It's Gary. Milo is thrilled. \nMILO No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself. \nGARY Okay. I'm Gary. \nMilo's smile deepens. Gary notices the small painting (by Alice) hanging on the wall. He stares at it. \nGARY 'Think I should buy some originals? \nMILO ...Do I? \nGARY Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions. \nMILO That's insane. You're ahead of your time. \nGARY That's what I told her. My wife. \nMilo colors as Gary drags a second chair in front of the screen; didn't realize he was contradicting Mrs. Boyd. \nGARY 'Thinks I'll be less of a control freak if I have a hobby. 'Just gives me something else to obsess about... \nMilo smiles as Gary sits down, studies the screen. \nGARY Anything we can salvage from the old code before you start fresh? \nMilo can't quite get over: Gary's his counselor. \nMILO Uh, might be one or two things. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. QUAD - OUTSIDE MILO'S OFFICE - LATER \nTwo awe-struck Geeks see Gary through the window. \nGEEK 1 He's been in there like an hour. \nGEEK 2 Shit. \nINT. MILO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMILO SCROLLS THE SCREEN: \nMILO Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden. \nGARY Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before? (when Milo shakes his head) It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right? (when Milo shakes his head) In a tree. \nINT. EMPTY HOUSE - EVENING \nWe're in an old (empty) Craftsman house. Through a front window, we see Alice lead Milo up a path. As they enter: \nALICE ...The corporate condos were as romantic as they sound. \nMilo's grinning as he takes in the house. \nTHE BEDROOM - MOMENT LATER \nWindows give onto a garden with a small studio. Milo's still beaming, Alice is pleased. Till he says: \n", "test2_id": 538, "test3_input": "Dolly-zoom in on a trace of fingerprint powder. \nFear seizes Milo. He ejects his the Skywire CD -- it is a bright silver color, with a Skywire logo on it -- slips it in an equally distinct silver (CD) jewel-case. \nINT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER \nMilo smiles at Desi as he moves up the hall. He almost bumps into Gary's Secretary. \nSECRETARY Milo, hi! How was the party? \nMILO Great! Great! Thanks for asking! \nHe continues up the hall. He ducks into the service hall. \nINT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nShrot watches as \nThe computer produces an alarm-like buzzing. The second window locks onto the matching print. The prints flash in unison, garishly confirming the match. \nINT. TUNNEL/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS \nMilo races along the tunnel that leads from #20 to the Day Care... \nINT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nShrot punches a number on the phone. \nLEN You calling Phil and Randy? \nSHROT I'm calling Gary. \nINT. STAIRWELL/DAY CARE BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo climbs the stairs, fumbles with the swipecard, enters the Day Care. \nINT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nLen is at the console. On a security monitor, he has called- up video from a moment ago: Milo hurrying up the hall, almost running into Gary's Secretary. \nShrot has an eye on the video as he speaks on the phone. \nSHROT He's left his office, we think he's gone back to the Day Care for some reason. Can you tell me why, Gary? (he listens) Whatever you say. (hangs up angrily) Wants to consult with Phil. Was it Phil's idea to run the fingerprints? \nShrot straps on his service revolver as he heads out. \nSHROT Come with me. \nLEN (trying to catch up) Where we going? \nINT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo is under the table, detaching one of the the black plastic data towers that contain the \"primers,\" stored surveillance material, etc. \nINT.

DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo carefully detaches a second data tower. \nEXT. BLDG. 20 - CONTINUOUS \nShrot and Len hurry out of the building, toward the Day Care across the quad. Len is ill-at-ease: \nLEN Bob, I'm a programmer, not a cop. \nIn his haste, Shrot doesn't even hear him. \nINT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nGunther, Riman & Randy head down the service hallway, en route to the bomb shelter stairs. \nINT. DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo, lugging one bulky black data tower under each arm (wondering if he should just ditch one) gets as far as the main, colorfully-carpeted room -- \nShrot is there, gun drawn. Len stands just behind. \nSHROT What are you doing? \nMILO You're better off not knowing. \nShrot thinks he's being mocked, as usual. \nSHROT What're you doing?! \nMilo sets down one of the towers. \nMILO They're surveilling programmers from in here. They steal their code. Sometimes -- I know this sounds insane -- sometimes they kill one. \n", "test3_true": "MILO They let me break into 21. 'Cause there's nothing in there. You know they've been keeping things from you. 'Getting in the way when you try t'do your job. That's why you never told 'em your suspicions about me. Right? \nShrot doesn't deny it. \nMILO If you had I'd be dead now. \nMilo's sincerity is striking. Shrot cogitates. \nMILO You've been following your gut all along. Please don't stop now? \nINT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS \nGunther, Riman and Randy climb the metal stairs, turn at a landing, climb some more. \nWhen they get to the next landing, Riman opens the door.

Take a look. \nHe shines his light under the table, where the towers have been detached. \nSHROT What's in here worth taking, anyway? \nEXT. QUAD - CONTINUOUS \nMilo hurries away from the Day Care. He has just one data tower, now, so he can move faster. \nINT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRandy starts to push past Shrot -- \nRANDY He must be out there still -- \nHe gets to the front room, where the jettisoned data tower still sits (but he doesn't see it). \nSHROT (calling after) Forget about it. His car's not in the lot, he's gone! \nShrot watches anxiously to see if he's stopped Randy. \nEXT. OUTPOST - PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nMilo moves low among the high-priced cars, lugging the tower. He gets to his Deux Chevaux, opens the trunk -- \nVOICE Hey! \nMilo turns. It's Desi, again. \nDESI Wanna get a cheeseburger or something? \nMILO Maybe another time. \nAs calmly as possible, he stows the tower, slams the trunk, gets in the car. \nINT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRandy hangs up the phone. \nRANDY (to Shrot & Len) Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now. \nSHROT Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place. \nRANDY We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in? \nReluctantly, Shrot & Len head out toward the front room. \nINT./EXT MILO'S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nMilo is on the phone, he drives as fast as one can in his car. \nMILO Meet me at the other location. \nLISA (V.O.)

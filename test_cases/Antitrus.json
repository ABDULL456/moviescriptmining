{"train": "\"ANTITRUST\" \nScreenplay by \nHoward Franklin \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nON A BLACK SCREEN \nit says: \"The coolest thing?\" \nVOICE Wow. That's hard. I'd have to say it's the day we launched Outpost \nWe hear a (famous) Seattle alternative band. \nEXT. OUTPOST CAMPUS - DAY (BEGIN MAIN TITLES) \nQuick cuts, seductive angles: 70 hot-air balloons rise over a vast, green corporate campus. Their mylar skins are imprinted with Outpost '98 logos; their gondolas are dressed in Outpost-colored bunting. \n18,000 Outpost employees cheer. They're spread out over rolling lawns, amid Arabian tents and costumed Acrobats. Over the balloon-dotted sky, the graphic re-appears: \"The coolest thing?\" \nDIFFERENT VOICE (DARYL) It's the beverages. \nINT. OUTPOST OFFICE - DAY (CONTINUE TITLES & MUSIC) \nA Programmer sits in his handsome office, forested landscape out the window. The screen says: DARYL, M.I.T. '95 \nDARYL Gary always makes sure we've got the coolest stuff to drink. \nJUMP CUTS of tall refrigerators: Snapples, Cokes, Fruitopias, Zaps, Jolts, Barques & Sprites are lined-up behind glass doors. \"The coolest thing?\" \nDIFFERENT VOICE (DIANA) Knowing your work means something. \nINT. OUTPOST CAMPUS - DAY (CONTINUE TITLES & MUSIC) \nA 24-year-old Korean-American Girl sits at the edge of a plashing, post-modern fountain. DIANA, STANFORD '97 \nDIANA (V.O.) Knowing everywhere in the world, this is the software people use. \nMONTAGE of world capitals & remote places: Stockbrokers & Farmers, News Anchors & Students, CEO's & Eskimos boot-up Outpost '98, or log-on with Outpost Internet Traveler. \nDIANA (V.O.) 20 years ago, Gary had an idea, that's all he had. And now the company's bigger than IBM. \nOver the last shot (a Ghetto Kid uses Outpost Word in the library): \"The coolest thing?\" \nVOICE (V.O.) It's the people. Which is weird. \nEXT. COFFEE HOUSE/TERRACE - DAY (CONTINUE TITLES & MUSIC) \nA Programmer sits with two colleagues, drinking latt\u00e9s at the edge of Lake Washington. MITCH, BERKELEY, '98 \nMITCH Big companies are s'posed to be impersonal. \nMONTAGE: Programmers play competitive games at an Outpost picnic; Toddlers play on computers in an Outpost Day Care Center; Geeks confer at a diagram-covered whiteboard; Employees listen/dance to the Seattle band we've been hearing, on-stage, at the Outpost '98 launch. \nMITCH (V.O.) There's this myth that doing a start- up is cooler. But there's no community with a start-up. No permanence. \nBACK TO SCENE: COFFEE HOUSE/TERRACE (CONTINUE TITLES) \nOne of Mitch's colleagues is nodding. DONNY, HARVARD, '97 \nDONNY It bums me out when the media say we're cultish, or whatever. Why? 'Cause we care about each other? \nDonny didn't mean to sound so mushy. Nobody knows where to look for a second. \nMITCH 'Love you too, bro. \nAs they laugh: \"The coolest thing?\" \nVOICE (TERRY) I'll tell you what's not cool. \nTERRY How Gary gets this superbad rap. \nMONTAGE of magazine covers (Newsweek, Vanity Fair, WIRED) featuring Gary Boyd. They say, eg: \"Who Owns Cyberspace?\" On a Time cover, he's composited by the Capitol Dome: \"ROBBER BARON OR VISIONARY? Outpost's Antitrust Woes\" \nTERRY (V.O.) There's this prejudice against super- smart people. People like Gary. \nGARY (early 40's) reads a statement before a Congressional Sub-Committee. His voice is pleasant but firm: \nGARY A kid working in his garage can create the next Outpost, the new IBM. All it takes is a great idea. \nA bloated Senator looks hostile. \nGARY That's why nobody can have a monopoly in a business built on ideas. \nAs we watch, CAMERA pulls back from the screen on which the movie is being projected. REVERSE INTO: \nINT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - EVENING (END MAIN TITLES) \nOver an audience of 40 or so computer students we read: \nSTANFORD UNIVERSITY \nBRIAN He's my god. I hear he actually calls recruits sometimes. Or is that an Urban Legend? \nREDMOND Gary's running the biggest software company in the world, Brian. He's being harassed by the Justice Department, and he's got a new baby. \nAcross the room, Milo (eating chips, perusing code) reaches for a napkin but unwittingly grabs some bunting. It unravels in a long TP-like streamer -- just as Danny approaches, peering at Milo's ID tag. \nDANNY Milo? I'm Danny. \nMILO Oh hi. \nHe tries to sluff the paper off his hand; Danny holds out a cell phone. \nDANNY Gary would like to speak to you? \nMilo and Teddy look at each other: right. But Danny looks like he means it. Milo's grin fades. He takes the phone. \nMILO ...Hello? \nGARY (ON THE PHONE) Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you. \nMILO You would? Wow. When would we come? (he waits; he looks up) 'Think he hung up. \nDanny holds out two plane tickets, in 1st class folders. \nINT. UNIVERSITY AVENUE DINER (PALO ALTO) - NIGHT \nAlice examines one of the tickets almost suspiciously. \nALICE But how does he know that's what you guys're working on? \nLarry, Teddy & Brian are at the table with Alice & Milo. It's a student hang-out, with loud music. \nMILO All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools. \nLARRY In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em. \nBRIAN (to Teddy) I can't believe you refused a ticket! \nTEDDY My parents're already freaked-out I'm staying here. 50 miles from Chinatown. \nBRIAN Well maybe if you told 'em how much money you'd be making -- (to Milo) You're going up there. Right? \nLARRY I think you should go. \nMILO (amazed) You do? \nLARRY I mean, it's your life. \nAs Alice predicted, Milo is pleased by Larry's remark. \"Empowered.\" Larry smiles conspiratorially at Alice. \nINT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT \nIn a tidy, playfully decorated room, Alice stirs in bed, sees the space next to her is vacant. \nTINY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo sits at a desk, thinking, agitated, in the dim light of a PC. He looks up, sees Alice in the doorway. \nMILO I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff. \nALICE C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times. \nShe picks her way through geek clutter (motherboards, code manuals, Coke cans) sits next to him. \nMILO A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they -- \nALICE Then you've gotta ask him about that. \nHe looks at her: you've gotta be kidding. \nALICE It's important. \nMILO If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway. \nALICE Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad. \nHe doesn't deny it: she sees right through him. \nMILO When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest. \nALICE But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high? \nINT. 737 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY \nIn the cabin, everybody types on a notebook but Milo. He looks out the window expectantly: at the Seattle skyline. \nINT. SEA-TAC AIRPORT - GATE 13 - DAY \nMilo comes off the plane. Danny and Redmond greet him. \nINT/EXT. HIGHWAY/CAR - DAY \nRedmond drives his black Lexus 85 m.p.h. Danny leans forward from the backseat. \nMILO His Snapples were in alphabetical order. \nREDMOND (he laughs) Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big... (he opens the door) 'Guess he needs to micro-manage something. \nINT. BLDG. 20 LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nAt the desk, a RECEPTIONIST looks up, stands to hang a temporary ID pass around Milo's neck. \nRECEPTIONIST Milo, I'm Judith. Welcome! \nMilo smiles. Redmond uses his magnetic swipe card on an inner door (a security cam is at every door); he holds the door open for Milo. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThey walk up a long carpeted hallway, past open offices where Geeks (mostly males under 30) sit at workstations. \nREDMOND Everybody has the same office, there's no dumbass corporate hierarchy. \nThey pass a room in which Geeks play video games. Just outside it, a chubby programmer, DESI, sips a Diet Coke. \nDESI Get out while you can, dude! \nREDMOND Desi, Milo. \nDESI The guy who was at Gary's house? \nHe bows deep, with mock-obeisance. Milo blushes, Redmond laughs, he snags Milo's elbow. They walk again, passing a service hall with a Civil Defense sign. \nREDMOND Best bomb shelters in America, accessible from every building. You gotta figure we're a major target, right? \nANOTHER HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER \nUp the hall, a young woman (LISA) is about to go into her office. She pauses half a second, looks at Milo, goes in. She's beautiful. \nREDMOND Whoa. Lisa actually looked at you. \nAs they pass her office, they look in: she's already at her workstation, studiously avoiding their gaze. \nREDMOND Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody. \nMILO (shy, changing the emphasis) She's a programmer? \nREDMOND Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps. (he all but winks) You'll be working with her. \nMILO I've got a girlfriend, remember? \nREDMOND Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost. \nINT. MILO'S OFFICE - MOMENT LATER \nA handsome, modest office like all the others: workstation, whiteboard, window. They enter. \nREDMOND Here's your world. (pointing at the desk) Copy of Gary's book, also the audio version, narrated by Gary. \nMilo puts down his box, picks up the book: The Next Highway (Gary by a highway on its cover). As we look at it: \nVOICE (SHROT) The card's encoded. Tells us who came through the door and when. \nINT. OFFICE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY - LATER \nIn an office with a bank of monitors that play feeds from security cameras, BOB SHROT, 40, Head of Physical Security, issues Milo his swipe card. Redmond watches. \nSHROT Unauthorized entries sound like this. \nHe drags the card through a sample slot, producing an unbelievably loud, piercing EEEEEEEE. He shouts over it: \nSHROT If you see a tailgater, report him. \nMILO Tailgater? \nSHROT (kills the alarm) Somebody coming in on your swipe. (gives Milo a photo ID) You see somebody wandering around without ID, it's your duty to challenge him. I don't give a shit if you're a stock-option billionaire. If you don't challenge, I'll have your butt. \nINT. HALLWAY - LATER \nMILO He seems a little -- tense. \nREDMOND Geeks pull his chain cause he's non- tech. Ex-cop or something. They moon cameras, or use ATM's as swipe cards. The cameras're our real security so he's a little demoralized. \nEXT. BUILDING 20/PARKING LOT - DAY \nAs they walk, Milo watches two Hardhats roll a spool of fiber- optic cable into the building under construction. \nMILO What're they building? \nREDMOND #21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in. \nMILO Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites. \nREDMOND You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested. \nThey approach a 1990 Deux Chevaux, cheap but charming. \nREDMOND Oh, right. Your girlfriend's an artist. \nMILO You know he's never been anybody's counselor before? \nALICE Milo! What about --? \nShe gestures at what she hopes will be their home. \nMILO Oh, It's great. It's great! (they start to kiss, but:) 'Think I should tell him I learned everything using 1.0? Maybe I could show him one of my early programs. \nShe pulls him back into the kiss. \nMONTAGE W/ MUSIC \n1.) MILO types intently in his office. \n2.) GARY sits with MILO at his desk, discussing code. Pan to the window; we see a different pair of awed Geeks. \n3.) Milo & Alice read in bed. He's reading Gary's book. \n4.) MILO shows GARY one of his early programs, written on 1.0.: it's simple-looking, with some childish writing scrawled on it. Gary seems touched. \nINT. OUTPOST CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nTwo DOJ AGENTS depose Gary. (A video-cam records his answers.) Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is reading from a document: \nDOJ AGENT \"Infotek's urgent need to license Outpost Office is such that we can use it as a tool in the current negotiation.\" (looks up) When you wrote the word \"tool,\" what'd you mean by it? \nGary studies his copy of the E-mail. He looks vexed. \nGARY I don't remember. \nDOJ AGENT What d'you think you meant by it? \nGARY I'm confused. Am I supposed to speculate under oath? \nThe Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable, while offering nothing). \nOTHER AGENT Since you didn't have an answer to that question, Mr. Boyd -- \nGARY (\"confused\" again) Didn't I? Have an answer? \"I don't remember.\" \nThe Agents confer. Gary sees Phil, looming outside the open door. One of the Agents sees him, too. He doesn't try to hide his annoyance: \nDOJ AGENT Did you wanna take a break, Mr. Boyd? \nINT. AN OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER \nGary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it. \nPHIL Your protege's moving so fast we can barely keep up with him. \nGary reads the page from the envelope: computer code. \nGARY This is good. Who did it? \nPHIL 'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac. \nGARY Maybe we should all get on it. \nINT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY \nMilo stares at his screen, frustrated. Gary enters. \nGARY How's it going? \nMILO Maybe I'm going too fast. \nGARY (sharply; incredulous) Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they -- \nCatching himself, Gary trails off. He sits down, exhales. \nGARY Even when I had a hand in every aspect of the company I knew the one thing you can never control is somebody's creative process. \nGary seems sincerely contrite. (He needn't be: Milo just wants to please him. Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop obsessing about convergence, to be a \"worldly zillionaire,\" engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more engrossing than Skywire?) \nMILO It's okay. Really. \nGARY (reaching into his pocket) Take a look at this. Slightly different approach. \nReading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow. \nMILO You did this -- overnight? \nGARY You're making me young again. \nINT. LISA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPAN OFF a TV, where local news footage shows a mangled, smoking BMW, post-wreck, on a lonely nocturnal highway. \nNEWS VOICE ...A graduate of MIT, he was on the antidepressant Prozac, and had been warned not to drink and drive. (Etc.) \nLisa watches the news report, knowingly. \nINT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - DAY \nStill distracted, he finds a page of code on his desk, gives it to Milo. Once again, Milo marvels. \nMILO You really wrote this just today? \nGARY (dark, unsmiling) What're you implying. \nMILO (taken aback) Nothing! \nTheir eyes are locked. Gary blinks, sags into his chair. \nGARY Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. (knits his brow) I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead? \nMILO (uncomfortable) I'm sure. \nGARY The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait. \nMilo just wants to get out. He studies the code to hide his discomfort. Gary watches him. \nGARY It scales, don't you think? \nMILO Definitely. \nHe smiles. For the first time it looks forced. \nINT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA youthfully upscale place, a converted red-brick warehouse. Alice looks great. The Waiter pours wine. \nALICE This feels fairly grown up, I'd say. \nMilo smiles (again it looks forced) raises his glass. \nMILO To our new life. (she's looking at him) ...What's wrong? \nALICE That's what I need to ask you. (when he says nothing) You know you can't keep anything from me. \nMILO He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, \"Did you really do this just today?\" Cause I was impressed. He said \"What're you implying?\" \nShe just looks at him. He grows a little defensive: \nMILO It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly. \nALICE (just confused) What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it? \nMILO That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire. (upset) 'Not saying it makes sense. \nA Busboy leaves a basket of rolls. Glum, preoccupied, Milo takes one without looking, brings it to his lips -- \nALICE Milo! \nHe looks at Alice, looks at the roll, blanches. \nMILO I'm so stupid. \nHe throws the roll back into the basket. \nALICE He's your boss. He's not your -- \nMILO (he's nodding) I know, I know. \nALICE If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor. \nMILO (the very idea hurts) Isn't that -- extreme? \nALICE What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it. \nWe see the rolls: covered in seeds. \nALICE I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much -- \nMILO You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting. \nHe smiles. But his heart's not in it. She hates to see him suffer. She picks up her glass. \nALICE C'mon. Let's do the toast? \nEXT. TERRACE OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY \nMilo sits alone, marking up pages of code as he eats. He doesn't notice Lisa, standing with her tray. \nLISA Did you wanna be alone? \nMILO No. Please. \nHe indicates she should sit. \nLISA They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going? \nMILO \"There is no second place.\" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration. (looks at her, curious) Is it like that with your counselor? \nLISA Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower. \nMILO Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code? \nEXT. BUILDING #20 QUAD - DAY \nThrough a window, we watch Milo traverse the quad. \nGARY (O.S.) What'd the girl say? \nPHIL There may be a little less trust after your outburst. \nWe are \nINT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nGary turns back inside, where Phil reads Milo's new code. \nPHIL Hasn't affected his work, though. \nGARY Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me. \nPhil is confused by Gary's sincerity; so is Gary. \nEXT. BUILDING #20 PARKING LOT - EVENING \nDesi and another Geek watch in astonishment: Gary walks Milo to his car, his arm circled over Milo's shoulder. He seems to be -- apologizing. \nEXT./INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - EVENING \nMilo comes eagerly up the path: can't wait to tell Alice what just happened. He enters -- pulls up short. Alice is waiting for him. She's white. \nMILO ...What's wrong? \nShe doesn't know how to say it. \nMILO What! \nALICE Teddy was killed last night. \nMILO What're you -- what? \nALICE It was a hate crime. \nMilo is staggered. She moves to him... \nALICE I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. \nHe hangs onto her, for support. \nEXT. SUNNYVALE LOFT BLDG. (SILICON VALLEY) - DAY \nEstablish the funky building, vestiges of police tape on the door, a limo and many cars parked out front. \nINT. LOFT - MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS \nA mixture of Teddy's relatives and Computer Friends have gathered. In the BG, Teddy's Dad weeps volubly. \nINT. TEDDY'S WORKSPACE - CONTINUOUS \nTeddy's brother, NELSON, shows Milo the workspace: red Stanford pennant, rubber trees on the desk. Milo, in a suit, peers at the painted-over epithet on the wall. \nNELSON They trashed his hard disk, all his back-ups. Nothing's left. \nMILO They caught the guys? \nNelson shows Milo a San Jose Mercury: mugshots of two skin- headed Aryan Nations Members in their 20's. \nNELSON It's an airtight case. They found the weapon with Teddy's blood on it and their fingerprints. They'd been arrested twice for beating-up Asians. How come they weren't in jail? \nMilo unpins a picture of himself & Teddy from a board. \nMILO He told me about the break-in. He didn't seem to take it that seriously. \nNELSON You guys don't take anything seriously do you? That's not on a hard drive? \nMilo is stung by this. Alice appears in the doorway. \nALICE Nelson? Your mom wants you. It's time to go to scatter the ashes. \nMilo is pinning the picture back up. The pushpin falls to the floor, he kneels to retrieve it. On the floorboards, he sees a thin, shiny plastic filament. He picks it up. \nMILO I didn't know he was working with fiber optics. \nBut when he looks up, Nelson's gone. \nALICE We gotta go too, honey. \nAs he heads out with Alice, he unthinkingly stuffs the filament in his suit pocket. \nEXT. BLUFF OVER THE PACIFIC - DAY \nA raw beautiful bluff. The sea stretches to infinity behind a smaller group of Mourners. A LAY MINISTER intones the Lord's Prayer. \nEXT. BLUFF - LATER \nMilo approaches Larry with trepidation. Larry nods, it's okay. They hug each other. They walk slowly back toward the cars. \nMILO Gotta go home. 'Think I ate something. \nINT./EXT. MILO'S CAR/OUTPOST PARKING LOT - DAY \nPulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone. He hits HOME on the speed-dial. Gets a busy signal. Rings off. He's about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded on the receiver. \nHe throws it down like it's contaminated. \nEXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY \nMiddle-of-the-day sounds: chirping birds, school children. Milo pulls to the curb at a bad angle. \nEXT. INT./FRONT DOOR/FOYER - DAY \nHe fumbles with his keys. When he gets inside: \nMILO Alice? Alice! \nHe moves into the bedroom. He sees her through the window, painting in the studio. \nEXT./INT. BACK GARDEN/STUDIO - MOMENT LATER \nHe stands outside the studio. Waits for her to look up. She does. She smiles. Then she sees something's wrong. He waits for her to come out here, where it's safe to speak. \nEXT. BACK GARDEN - LATER \nHe paces, agitated. She watches him. She's skeptical, but doesn't want to appear unsympathetic. \nALICE Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case. \nMILO I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys. \nALICE I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that. \nMILO I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says \"Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?\" It's like they know what every kid's doing. \nALICE They hack into people's programs? \nMILO Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically. (he freezes) Oh Jesus. \nINT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER \nMilo's at the closet, rummaging among the clothes hanging there. Alice comes up behind him. He finds his suit jacket. He digs in one pocket, then another. He finds the fiber optic strand (from Teddy's floor). Shows it to her. \nMILO (almost silently) It's a camera. \nEXT. BACK GARDEN - AGAIN \nThey've trooped back outside. She's worried she's indulging his paranoia. \nMILO It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top. \nALICE You're scaring me. I think we should just go. \nMILO Go where? You can't get away from people like this. \nALICE \"Like this?\" It's Gary you're talking about. \nMILO (it really hurts) You think I don't know that? \nALICE Milo. Why would he -- \nMILO How should I know? \"Solving a problem,\" I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know. (can't think about it) I've gotta get in there. \nALICE Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and -- \nMILO It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening. (muttered, obsessive) ...gotta get in there. \nALICE Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post? (as he mulls this) And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards -- \nMILO I can't just walk away! \nALICE You can't just walk in, either. \nMILO They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five. \nALICE Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed? \nHe knows what she's saying: he's unqualified for this, a space-cadet. She tries to hold him. But he wriggles away. \nMILO No! I can't just keep my head in the sand. That's how I got into this mess. \nHe paces, he thinks. She watches him, worried. \nMILO I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me. \nALICE (scared, reluctant) ...Whaddo I do? \nMILO So you believe me? \nShe can't lie. She shakes her head. \nALICE Just tell me what to do. \nPanning off the civil defense sign we find Shrot standing at a closet, examining a piece of the alarm clock. \nINT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo is at work, bringing up schematic screens, diagnosing the system with his unique concentration. \nPanning to the window, we see the evacuated Programmers enjoying themselves on the lawn. It's a rare, exciting event: they jump around, miming explosions. \nINT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nShrot and the Guard collect pieces of the bomb out of the debris, puts them in a tray. \nINT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo brings up the screen that controls the #21 cameras. On the monitors, he sees nothing very interesting: a hallway, a room under construction... \nHe pulls down a menu. RECORDING is highlighted. He clicks PLAYBACK. The image hardly changes, but a Guard wanders through. He types, the tape rewinds (the Guard moves backwards). He finds a neutral spot (showing an empty hallway), stops the tape. \nINT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nGary, Randy & Phil approach Shrot; Gary stares at him. \nRANDY What is it? \nSHROT Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall. \nRANDY There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual. \nSHROT (thinking aloud) Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I -- \nGary explodes, with incredulity. \nGARY Milo? Try to have a clue. Try to think. \nGary strides off. Shrot feels unfairly maligned. \nRANDY That kid's the great white hope. \nSHROT I could get it out of him. \nRANDY You're not listening. \nRandy and Phil head up the hall. Shrot watches them. Even if his \"intellectual superiors\" are convinced of Milo's innocence, he isn't. \nHe walks swiftly back toward his office. Then he runs. \nINT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo reads a warning message. DOWNLOADING PLAYBACK STREAM TO RECORD CYCLE WILL CAUSE BIT OVERLOAD. DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED? Y/N. He types Y. \nThe glitch freezes the tape (we see it lock into place): it shows the empty hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThey've let the Programmers back in. They head up the hall as Shrot heads down it. He pushes past them gruffly. \nHe knows he's enhancing his Neanderthal image (they make cracks) but he's more interested in obeying his instinct. \nINT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo immobilizes another camera in #21... and another. \nINT. HALLWAY CONTINUOUS \nShrot rounds the corner. His office is in view, now. \nINT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo, at the keyboard, closes up windows, one by one. \nINT. SECURITY OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nShrot is back, he has only to round the corner to see Milo. We assume his POV as he does so: \nMilo sits in the chair where Shrot left him. \nMILO Everything okay? \nINT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nPan off the clock (3:20 AM) to find Milo at his desk, looking at the clock with a certain dread. It's time. \nEXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - NIGHT \nMilo walks the path between the two buildings, fiddling nervously with the dummied swipe card. \nHearing footfalls behind him, he whirls: it's a Geek loping to his car. He smiles. Milo smiles: waits, walks on. \nNearing #21, Milo looks around, making sure no one else is around. His POV (panning): A Programmer works late, visible through a lighted window in #20... The dog sculpture with cocked ears sits atop the Day Care, its quizzical expression seeming to wonder what Milo is up to... The Geek he just saw racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his James Bond BMW... \nMilo arrives at the entrance. Heart pounding, he brings the card to the slot. Will he trigger that awful alarm? \nHe slides the card, the door clicks. \nINT. DAY CARE CENTER - CONTINUOUS \nHe steps in on colorful carpeting, amid balls & tricycles. Kid's artwork hangs on the wall. He moves through this room, into the \nCOMPUTER ROOM \n20 screens glow. They hang suspended over a wide, ringed table, a chair at each keyboard. Indeed, Gary has spared no expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship). There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming). \nMilo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings are of desks or tables with computers. \nTracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- familiar. Milo passes it. And comes back to it. \nStaring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing still occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously -- numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do is a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, his frustration evident. \nAs he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolve into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now). \nWhen all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. All of them show variations on a theme: \nA workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a programmer (if he were present). The stations are of various shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed view of screen & keyboard. At this hour, few programmers are present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. A Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there. \nINT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nPhil and Randy work at the coffee table. \nPHIL Did you download Corey? In San Jose? \nRANDY Damn. 'Have to go back over there. (he stands, stretches) Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door. \nPHIL You don't look anything like a three- year-old. \nINT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo works the keyboard. Again, the code gets dense and obscure as he goes deeper. He succeeds in calling-up a graphical interface. Among the menus he can choose from are: TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS. \nHe clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal Tech, etc.). He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy. Two windows open. In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an award in the Gate's Bldg. In the other, uploaded police video stenciled SUNNYVALE PD) of the White Supremacists whose mug- shots we saw in the San Jose Mercury; they're being interrogated. \nIn the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handheld crime-scene video (marked SV-PD) of a ransacked grocery store. \"DIE GOOK!\" is painted on a wall. Milo looks confused: some \"narrative\" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without audio. \nHe types some more. \nIn the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regarding the audio. About the only phrases we can understand are: \"Audio Block ON\" and \"Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filter Type PBX-R17.\" \nHis eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware substitute. He digs in his shirt pocket. He takes out his swipe card, studies it. He casts about some more, till he sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar. \nINT. BUILDING 20 - SERVICE HALL - CONTINUOUS \nRandy whistles as he heads up the hall. Arriving at the door with the Civil Defense sticker, he swipes his card. \nINT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nOn-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Aryan Nations suspects come out of it. A still photo appears in the 2nd window: a steel hasp. \nMilo's eyes are narrowed: what am I seeing? Meantime, he is reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within. \nHe has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its magnetic strip into a metal slot. He wiggles the card. We hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice of a serene, eminently sane female: \nMULTIMEDIA NARRATOR -- run this methamphetamine lab known to Federal Authorities, per ND 47, from which we removed the implement, fingerprints intact. \nCrime-scene video streams in now stenciled FBI by the time/date). A handheld camera pans a blood-spattered wall then shows a mutilated Asian murder victim. (All of this footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always present in streaming video, and its sinister graininess.) \nMULTIMEDIA NARRATOR FBI footage, procured by ND 47, shows the aftermath of an Aryan Nations' killing in Denver. Note the evidence of torture, which is typical. \nMilo pales as he realizes he is watching a primer on how racial killings are done. \nHe hears a creaking noise behind him, and whirls. \nIt's the classroom hamster, on his wheel. \nINT. STAIRWELL/BOMB SHELTER - CONTINUOUS \nStill whistling, Randy descends some metal stairs, enters a vast bomb shelter (canned foods, etc.) \nINT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo has tapped into his own file: footage of him lecturing at Stanford (as an RA), pointing to a whiteboard. \nMULTIMEDIA NARRATOR -- complete immersion in code-writing renders him both unobservant and suggestible [click]. On two occasions he went truant from classes to attend Comix Conventions. \nThe audio crackles and drops out again. Milo's eyes narrow: he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speaking to someone. She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro. \nWhat's he seeing? He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware almost urgently, till the narration crackles back on: \nMULTIMEDIA NARRATOR -- Rebecca P, a Connecticut art stu- dent facing Federal drug charges, whose records were supplied to us by N.D. 47. \nHe hears her voice under the Narration, answering an unseen Interrogator (sounds like Phil). It's a job interview. Milo subtly, unconsciously shakes his head, as if to deny what his eyes see. The narration begins to fibrillate, again: \nMULTIMEDIA NARRATOR (O.S.) Armed with his personal files, she was easily able to ingratiate herself with the socially maladroit Milo -- \nThe audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files and ER photos of himself marked STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER: he's waxen, bloated, gasping for breath. With a certain dread, Milo jams the card in deeper: \nMULTIMEDIA NARRATOR ...she planted the sesame seed both to test the extent of his proclivity and to provide a bonding experience, since she would quote \"save his life.\" \nMilo is devastated, disbelieving. Now he sees real-time ER footage: an Allergy Victim, bloated, twitching, gasping, dying... \nEXT./INT. MILO'S CAR/STREET - DAWN \nMilo sits in his idling car, staring at his own house, up the street. How can he go in there? \nHe puts the car in gear, does a U-Turn. \nEXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - SEATTLE - EARLY MORNING \nThe Deux Chevaux is parked on the street outside a government building. Not many people are around, yet. A Janitor hoses down the sidewalk. \nINT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - RECEPTION AREA MORNING \nMilo slides a business card across a reception desk. It's the one the rumpled Prosecutor, Lyle Barton, gave him that day in Palo Alto. \nMILO (O.S.) He gave me this. 'Said I should come see him if -- \nDOJ RECEPTIONIST He's not in yet. \nMILO Can I wait in his office? \nDOJ RECEPTIONIST It's locked, dear. \nHe looks over his shoulder, then back again, frightened. \nMILO Please. \nDOJ RECEPTIONIST Wait in his outer office. \nINT. BARTON'S OUTER OFFICE - MORNING \nMilo sits on a wooden bench, foot tapping. Hearing Barton's voice, he comes to his feet. Barton enters with a Co-Worker, holding a container of coffee, discussing the particulars of a case. \nCO-WORKER Do I make the call, or do you? \nMilo is relieved the second he sees Barton's kindly face. \nMILO Mr. Barton, do you remember me? \nBARTON ...It's -- Milo, isn't it? \nMILO Yes sir. I need to talk to you. \nBARTON Give me two seconds with Lacy here? (unlocks his door) Go on in, I won't be a moment. \nMilo enters as Barton finishes up with his colleague. \nBARTON (O.S.) I'll make the call, but I think you need to send a Fax first (etc.). \nINT. BARTON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo paces. He surveys framed diplomas, commendations and photos on the wall. He takes comfort in their solidity: pictures of Barton's teenage Kids, Barton and Wife at the Grand Canyon. There's a college football photo, a young Barton with his team. Milo studies it, smiles. Move in on the photo, till we see the number on Barton's Notre Dame football jersey: ND 47. \nMilo's smile fades. It takes a moment before he even hears Barton behind him. \nBARTON Milo? \nMILO Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me. \nBARTON Have a seat. \nAs Milo takes the seat in front of the desk (mind spinning) Barton moves to his own chair. \nBARTON What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset. \nMILO I am. I am, sir. \nWhat's he gonna say? \nBARTON Milo? \nMILO My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley. \nBARTON My goodness. \nMILO It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they? \nBARTON If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first. \nMILO I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis. \nBARTON Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area. \nMILO (he gets up) 'Just didn't know who else to talk to. \nBARTON (circles an arm over Milo) And Outpost? You're happy there? \nMILO Yes sir. \nINT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING \nAlice is on the phone in the front room. Agitated, she puffs on a pencil (surrogate cigarette). We hear Phil through the receiver: \nPHIL (ON THE PHONE) 'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department? \nMilo sits across from her. He doesn't know where to start. \nLISA What's wrong? \nHe looks around, wants to make sure no one's listening. He speaks very quietly. \nMILO I snuck into #21. \nLISA Why would you do a thing like -- \nMILO You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care. \nLISA The Day Care? \nTwo Men with even features enter the restaurant. One has a laptop case slung over his shoulder. \nMILO Can we go someplace else? \nEXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT \nThey're in a bandshell. The rain falls heavily, drips off the eaves. She holds the filament from Teddy's workspace. \nMILO It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there. \nLISA But why would they --? \nMILO You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make \"sense.\" I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much. \nShe's peering at him. He reads her mind. \nMILO I'm not one of them. Not trying to \"suss you out.\" \nShe wants to believe him. \nMILO They killed my best friend! I'm living with somebody they pay to go to bed with me. Can't you trust somebody just once? I don't wanna be alone here. \nHis plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent. But she can't quite do it. \nLISA I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry. \nShe smiles sadly as she backs away. \nMILO (forcefully) I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. (quieter) I know what he did to you. \nLISA Oh yeah? \nShe tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes. \nLISA So that's in my -- file? \nHe wants to comfort her. He takes a step toward her. She shakes her head: no. \nLISA Is that my -- scenario? (when he hesitates) Tell me. \nMILO They'd frame him. \nLISA (horrified) He's out of prison? \nMILO (he nods) They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his \"act of revenge.\" \nShe draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks. She weeps silently. He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing her fear, her trauma. He touches her shoulders. She tenses, tries to back away. \nLISA No. \nBut he holds on. \nMILO Nobody's gonna hurt you. \nSlowly, he wraps his arms around her. \nShe remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her face into his shoulder. The rain drums on the bandshell. After a moment: \nLISA ...Milo? \nMILO Hmm? \nLISA I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean. \nMILO No, no. Never. \nShe clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame. \nA wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm. \nVOICE (PHIL) All his suspicions were allayed? \nINT. LIBRARY-LIKE OFFICE - DAY \nAlice nods. She sits in front of leather-bound books. \nVOICE You're sure. \nShe's at Gary's house. On the hot seat. Phil and Randy watch her. Gary does, too, but deep in shadow, behind a desk, at a remove. Rain falls heavily on the Lake. \nEXT. BUILDING 21 - DAY \nClose on a satellite dish. We pan from the base of the dish to the wiring: a cable is fused to a component box. \nLisa is on the scaffolding, having climbed it brazenly, in broad daylight. She holds a small metal box with a meter and two clamps. She applies the clamps to the base of the cable. The needle on the meter dances. \nGUARD Hey! Get down here! \nShe was expecting to be busted. Still, she's scared. \nEXT. SAINT CATHERINE'S DAY SCHOOL - DAY \nA Catholic school on a wooded lane. Schoolgirls in uniform play on the swings and hopscotch courts. \nINT. LIBRARY - SAINT CATHERINE'S \nMilo types madly on a four-year-old PC. It takes him a moment to notice SISTER BEATRICE. \nMILO This is a lifesaver. My PC crashed just before finals. \nSISTER BEATRICE None of us knows how to use it. I'm thinking of taking a course. (she wants to look) May I? \nMILO Sure. \nWith her, we see the complex lines of code. \nSISTER BEATRICE Forget it. \nINT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nLisa sits with Bob Shrot. She's unfolding a page of sketch paper. \nLISA I needed t'see it up close for a graphic. The outpost with a dish on top? I climbed up there to get it right. \nShe hands him an unfinished rendering of the dish. He looks at her, at the drawing, at her again. She's scared, but tries to hide it. \nSHROT (hands back the drawing) Next time you ask. \nRelieved, she gets up. The meter tumbles to the floor, thud. She goes white. But when she looks up, she sees \nShrot didn't see it: Len is standing in the inner door, waving a printout. \nLEN 'Might of found something. \nLisa grabs up the meter as Shrot joins Len. As she goes out, she hears: \nLEN Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time. \nSHROT Let's get him in here. \nINT. SEATTLE MONORAIL CAR - NIGHT \nMilo looks up as his train comes into a station. Lisa enters the car, carrying a stack of comix. He stands, they kiss, he takes the comix. \nMILO Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there. \nLISA The dishes are juiced up, too. \nMILO Thank God. \nLISA Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts. \nMILO (confused) They know I broke in. Alice helped me. (figuring it out) Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own. \nLISA He doesn't know about the Day Care. \nMILO Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf? \nLISA Yeah, that's old, in a tree. \nMILO Oh. \nLISA Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it? \nThey look at each other: the consequences of this discovery would be deadly. \nINT. BUILDING 20 CAFETERIA - DAY \nA busy lunch hour. Milo is eating with some other Programmers, including Desi. There's a stir of excitement in the room. \nGary comes straight to Milo's table; all conversation instantly drops out. \nGARY Milo? \nMilo stands. Gary hands him a heavy vellum invitation. \nGARY I'm giving a benefit for the art museum Thursday night. Thought you'd like to bring Alice. \nEverybody at the table is listening. \nMILO That's great! Thanks. \nGARY (as he goes) 'Sorry about the late notice... \nHe'd better have his story straight with Gary and Alice. \nMILO No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you. (looks at her) You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I -- \nALICE (fighting tears) Just shut up? \nOr is she faking it? Has he lost the trust of all of them? He's afraid, now. \nEXT. INT. DAY CARE - DAY \nMove in on the building, past Kids playing in the yard. \nINT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nWe hear the children's shouts OS. Short, with a fingerprint kit, is dusting the keyboards. Len stands over him. \nLEN Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do. (looking around, perplexed) What would Milo want in here, anyway? \nSHROT They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later. \nEXT. LIBRARY PARK - EVENING \nBy the balustrade, in the dimness, Milo stands with Lisa. \nLISA Does he know you know? \nMILO He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do. (he breathes) We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version. (knows she won't like it) But I've gotta go home for an hour. \nLISA Why?! \nMILO She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't. \nLISA Please don't go. \nMILO At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary. \nShe looks at him, worried, then takes a disk out of her backpack. \nLISA Here's the interface. \nHe takes it. They kiss. She watches him go, worried. \nEXT./INT. MILO'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAs Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen. \nHe opens the front door, steps in. She comes from the kitchen in an apron, wiping her hands. The apron is spattered, her hair is askew. \nALICE I'm a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook, since we're always afraid for you to eat in Chinese restaurants. I've been mincing things into teeny-tiny pieces all afternoon. \nHe smiles to hide his terror. Is she killing him now? Or just testing his reaction? Or is it a sincere overture? \nMILO Great! \nALICE Look at me! I'm gonna change. \nWhen she turns away, we see the fear on his face. \nINT. THE BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER \nAlice pulls into a dress. \nIN THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nMilo, at the stove, sniffs at the food that simmers in a wok. He grabs a a spoon, examines it; but it's minced too fine to discern one ingredient from another. \nBEDROOM \nAlice pulls her hair back with a ribbon... \nKITCHEN \nMilo churns the garbage in the wastebasket, reads the label on a jar, the label on a can... \nBEDROOM \nAlice applies blush-on. \nKITCHEN \nMilo goes through the spice cabinet... \nLIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER \nMilo paces. He stops when she comes from the bedroom. \nMILO (he smiles) You look beautiful. \nALICE Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss. \nMILO ...What? \nALICE I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now. \nDolly-zoom in on a trace of fingerprint powder. \nFear seizes Milo. He ejects his the Skywire CD -- it is a bright silver color, with a Skywire logo on it -- slips it in an equally distinct silver (CD) jewel-case. \nINT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER \nMilo smiles at Desi as he moves up the hall. He almost bumps into Gary's Secretary. \nSECRETARY Milo, hi! How was the party? \nMILO Great! Great! Thanks for asking! \nHe continues up the hall. He ducks into the service hall. \nINT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nShrot watches as \nThe computer produces an alarm-like buzzing. The second window locks onto the matching print. The prints flash in unison, garishly confirming the match. \nINT. TUNNEL/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS \nMilo races along the tunnel that leads from #20 to the Day Care... \nINT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nShrot punches a number on the phone. \nLEN You calling Phil and Randy? \nSHROT I'm calling Gary. \nINT. STAIRWELL/DAY CARE BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo climbs the stairs, fumbles with the swipecard, enters the Day Care. \nINT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nLen is at the console. On a security monitor, he has called- up video from a moment ago: Milo hurrying up the hall, almost running into Gary's Secretary. \nShrot has an eye on the video as he speaks on the phone. \nSHROT He's left his office, we think he's gone back to the Day Care for some reason. Can you tell me why, Gary? (he listens) Whatever you say. (hangs up angrily) Wants to consult with Phil. Was it Phil's idea to run the fingerprints? \nShrot straps on his service revolver as he heads out. \nSHROT Come with me. \nLEN (trying to catch up) Where we going? \nINT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo is under the table, detaching one of the the black plastic data towers that contain the \"primers,\" stored surveillance material, etc. \nINT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nPhil hangs up the phone. He turns to Randy, who is with the two men: the blond GUNTHER, the pale-eyed RIMAN. \nPHIL He's in the Day Care. \nINT. DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo carefully detaches a second data tower. \nEXT. BLDG. 20 - CONTINUOUS \nShrot and Len hurry out of the building, toward the Day Care across the quad. Len is ill-at-ease: \nLEN Bob, I'm a programmer, not a cop. \nIn his haste, Shrot doesn't even hear him. \nINT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nGunther, Riman & Randy head down the service hallway, en route to the bomb shelter stairs. \nINT. DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS \nMilo, lugging one bulky black data tower under each arm (wondering if he should just ditch one) gets as far as the main, colorfully-carpeted room -- \nShrot is there, gun drawn. Len stands just behind. \nSHROT What are you doing? \nMILO You're better off not knowing. \nShrot thinks he's being mocked, as usual. \nSHROT What're you doing?! \nMilo sets down one of the towers. \nMILO They're surveilling programmers from in here. They steal their code. Sometimes -- I know this sounds insane -- sometimes they kill one. \nLISA (ON THE PHONE) It's three years old, it -- \nINT. MILO'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nMILO (ON THE PHONE) Bring it to the other location. \nLISA But you said the other -- \nHe rings off. He reads something off a business card. \nINT. LISA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nScrambling, Lisa grabs her old laptop, finds her keys. \nINT. GARY'S HOUSE - GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS \nPhil's on the phone. \nPHIL Yeah, alright. (hangs up, briefs Gary) He's off campus, he's taken some surveillance data with him. \nGary's eyes narrow. \nPHIL She's bringing her laptop, it's wired. Second she boots up, we're on 'em. \nEXT./INT. BUILDING/MILO'S CAR - RURAL ROAD - NIGHT \nMilo reads the address off the business card, which has a satellite dish as its logo. (He holds it in front of him.) \nWhen he brings down the card, it reveals a real-life satellite dish through the windshield. \nAs the car pulls up by a low cinderblock building, we read a sign that says KNQR - PUBLIC ACCESS. \nINT. KNQR - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS \nMilo rushes in, lugging the tower. There's a linoleum floor, framed one-sheets for tacky public access shows (Yoga, blow- dried Evangelist, Nude Talk Show). Behind the reception desk sits a beefy RENT-A-GUARD with an earring. \nRENT-A-GUARD Help you? \nMILO Brian here? Brian Bissel? \nRENT-A-GUARD (picks up the phone) Who wants to see him? \nINT./EXT. LISA'S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nLisa drives fast, checking her rear-view-mirror to make sure she's not being followed. Pan to the seat next to her: her laptop lies on the passenger seat. \nINT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA monitor shows a green interface with yellow coordinates (like an air traffic controllers' screen). Randy sits at the keyboard in front of it, phone cradled on shoulder. \nRANDY (into the phone) Nothing. They haven't booted-up yet. \nINT. KNQR - CONTINUOUS \nMilo speaks to Brian. \nMILO This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner. \nBRIAN You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show. \nMILO Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life. \nBrian is examining the data tower. He touches the Outpost logo branded into it, rather reverently. \nLisa comes in, laptop slung over her arm. \nBRIAN Will I get to work for Outpost? \nMILO No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost. \nBRIAN What? \nMILO What'd they ever do for you? \nBrian's thinking it over. He shrugs. \nBRIAN Okay. \nMILO Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door -- \nBRIAN What?! \nMILO (to the Rent-a-Guard) Wanna be a part of history? \nRENT-A-GUARD Not really. \nMILO (digging in his pocket) Well -- would you like to pick up an extra -- 232 dollars? \nINT. GARY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nGary is pacing... \nPHIL (on the phone) Nothing yet, Gary... \nPHIL Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes -- \nEXT. KNQR - CONTINUOUS \nGunther and Riman squeal into the station parking lot. \nINT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nLisa looks out the window to the parking lot, below. Milo is typing in coordinates. \nLISA They're already here. My laptop must be wired! \nBRIAN (anxiously) Milo? \nMILO (typing) We're there. \nMilo hits enter. \nINT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS \nGary hits enter. \nEXT. SPACE CONTINUOUS \nA second Skywire satellite shifts regally away from the Earth, as if shunning the signal. \nINT. SATELLITE ROOM KNQR - CONTINUOUS \nMilo, Lisa, Brian watch the TV's. \"ER\" et al. \nMILO Damn! \nEXT./INT. KNQR - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS \nGunther and Riman tear through the barricade the Rent-A-Cop has erected with ruthless precision. \nINT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo cogitates while Lisa reviews the satellite coordinates -- \nLISA (to Brian) You checked your connections? \nBRIAN (to Milo) Yes! Should you reboot? \nMilo is scrolling the software, trying to figure out which of a 1,000 possible glitches is getting in the way. \nMILO ...He knows. \nLISA What? \nMILO He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12. \nINT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS \nPHIL Ready for number three? \nGARY Let's go. \nPHIL Longitude 109 -- \nGARY Wait... He knows. \nPHIL What? \nGARY 'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12. \nPHIL Gary? \nGARY Just do it. \nINT. KNQR - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe Rent-A-Guard drags furniture, props, lights, in front of the entrance to the satellite room. \nINT. ENTRANCE - KNQR - CONTINUOUS \nGunther and Riman have created an opening in the barricade. They step through it. They hear the racket the Rent-a-Guard is making upstairs. They head that way. \nINT. STAIRWAY/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe Rent-A-Guard is holding a lightstand as they ascend, guns drawn. \nGUNTHER Step aside. We won't hurt you. \nRiman takes the lightstand from him. The Rent-a-Guard puts his hands up, sidles across the hallway as they tear into the barricade. \nINT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nLisa reads to Milo. \nLISA Latitude 47 degrees. \nMILO Wait a second. He knows I know. \nWe hear sirens grow near. Gunther watches the broadcast, still gripping his gun. \nRIMAN (to Gunther) You know the scenario for this. \nThis sounds ominous. Lisa wonders what it means. Milo wonders what it means. He swallows hard. \nMILO 'Last thing you wanna do is hurt us now. (not at all sure) Right? \nGUNTHER (to Brian) Who's seeing this? \nBRIAN (with dread) Who isn't? \nCUT TO: \nA MONTAGE \n1. MOVE PAST ROWS & ROWS OF PC's playing surveillance footage, a crash-scene upload, and an obituary, in a college computer lab. Students watch, agog. \nGARY'S VOICE OVER We work hard to stay ahead because we know any kid working in his garage can put us out of business. \n2. TIMES SQUARE - Pedestrians and motorists (with craned necks) watch the Jumbo-Tron, now the world's biggest desktop. In one window, college video of a promising Programmer, in the other, footage of a cult suicide. (Sometimes the Programmer in question is simultaneous with his obit, sometimes not, but the connection by now becomes clear). \nGARY'S VOICE OVER The first rule of the software business is: those who don't innovate are doomed to die. \n3. The cuts accelerate. In a NETWORK CONTROL ROOM, Technicians flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming. At the NIKKEI, the Brokers are transfixed by what comes over the Big Board. In a VEGAS CASINO Gamblers sip their drinks as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors. On a STREET CORNER, a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper. At a STADIUM, the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vision behind them plays Milo's broadcast. In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer footage for Shoppers. A guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost '98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf... In the Day Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magnetic hoop, which he runs over each tower, wiping out data. \nThrough all the cuts, we hear Gary's narration: \nGARY'S VOICE OVER That's why we work so hard to invent or acquire great new applications. Consumers don't care where new ideas come from, just so long as they're offered at competitive prices. Isn't that what the free market's about? Sure, we like being #1, but it's pressure, too. This business is binary: you're a zero or a one. \nINT. JUSTICE DEPT. - WASHINGTON D.C. - CONTINUOUS \nA group of Government Lawyers, working late (Chinese takeout, loosened ties) watch with a dawning sense of unbelievable good luck. \nJUSTICE DEPT. LAWYER 'Guess we should wake the Attorney General. \nTIGHT ON: A PC SCREEN - Teddy Chin's recruitment file is in one window, the hate crime footage is in another. \nGARY'S VOICE OVER I've been called \"aggressive\" but to me, that's really a compliment. \nREVERSE: SUNNYVALE LOFT - CONTINUOUS \nLarry watches with his start-up partners. His eyes close: it hurts to see Teddy, again. \nGARY'S VOICE OVER Look at all the jobs and technologies my \"aggression\" has created. \nINT. LYLE BARTON'S HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nOPEN on a framed photo of Barton, his Wife and Kids. The broadcast plays, OS. \nBARTON'S WIFE (O.S.) Lyle? Phone for you. \nShe comes in. No Barton. The front door is wide open, the TV is still on. \nGARY'S VOICE OVER We really are a family here at Outpost. \nINT. MILO & LISA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPaintings are gone from the wall, clothes flung around. Move in on a note pinned to the pillow, as the TV plays. \nGARY'S VOICE OVER I think that's why outsiders sometimes sees us as \"cultish\" or \"secretive.\" \nMilo, It wasn't so bad, really. \nXX \"Alice\" \nEXT. OUTPOST CAMPUS - NIGHT \nHigh wide shot: sirens scream as unmarked sedans and squadcars squeal into the sanctified parking lot. \nGARY'S VOICE OVER Is loyalty and group spirit somehow \"sinister\" nowadays? \nINT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS \nOpen on Gary's TV monitors, then pan into the room. Phil has departed; the Outpost Lawyers have taken his place. \nLAWYER The \"murder\" stuff is all innuendo: bad PR, legally null. 'Could probably be spun as Urban Legend. There is a case for corporate espionage, but if you cop a plea, you'll get a slap -- \nGARY Cop a plea? I'm confused, Ted. You think I knew about this? \nThe Lawyers suppress their opinion. \nGARY I'm running the company, fighting the DOJ, raising a family. Randy and Phil obviously overreacted. To this endless, antitrust witchhunt. \nLAWYER (get real) The government's gonna offer 'em a helluva deal to tie you into this. Whether you knew about it or not. \nLAWYER 2 Randy, Phil and whoever else knew about it. \nGARY That won't be a problem. \nINT./EXT. CAR/RURAL ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nGunther & Riman turn off a rural road... \n", "test1_input": "INT. GARY'S WORKROOM (LAKE VIEW) - MOMENTS LATER \nThey enter. An entire wall is taken-up by a Bosch triptych. As Gary crosses to the other side of the room, Milo stands by a table covered in art books -- hundreds of them (Soutine, Chinoiserie, Roy Lichtenstein...) \nMILO You know a lot about art, I guess. \nGARY There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it. \nGary heads back, carrying something spherical. \nGARY There's more to life than computers? I'm looking into it. \nGlancing down at the daunting display of books, Gary looks vaguely afflicted. He mutters: \nGARY 'Once I start looking into something. \nLooking up now (and much more at ease) he holds up a shiny, detailed metal object: model satellite. \nGARY I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room. (as Milo takes it, carefully) It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up. \nMILO Low enough to relay internet traffic. \nGARY (he smiles: exactly) Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky? \nMILO (turning the sleek object) Skywire. \nINT. GARY'S WORKROOM - LATER \nMilo and Gary peer at a monitor, side-by-side. Milo sips his own Snapple now. Gary speaks his language. \nGARY The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges. \nMILO It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it? \nGARY You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me? \nMilo has a deer-in-the-headlights look. \nMILO ...Ask you? \nINT. GARY'S HOUSE - ANOTHER ROOM - DUSK \nAs they walk, Milo chides himself for his reticence. Gary seems to read his mind. \nGARY I know what people say, and not just the Justice Department. We clone ideas, inflict our second-rate versions on the world, we haven't done anything original since 1.0. \nMilo's amazed by Gary's acuity. And his candor. \nGARY Do I think that's fair? No. I'd put some of our apps up against anybody's. But is there some truth to it? \nThey have come to a stop in a windowed entryway. Milo watches Gary keenly. Gary nods. He knits his brow. \nGARY When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost \nMILO I do! \nGARY (pleased) Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here. (the furrows deepen) But somehow got away. \nEXT. CUPERTINO HILLS (SILICON VALLEY) - NIGHT \nA block of floodlit \"tract mansions,\" Taco Bell palaces of the Valley's newly rich. Milo & Alice cross a vacant lot to where the lights twinkle below. Their '89 Honda Civic is parked nearby. Milo is excited. \nMILO If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too. \nALICE I think that's great, Milo. I do. \nMILO ...But? \nALICE Didn't you visit the campus? \nMILO I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide. \nALICE No way. You have this -- destiny. \nMILO C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating -- \nALICE Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die? \nMILO (shrugs) You saved my life in alot of ways. \nHe's sweet. She kisses him. He holds onto her. \nALICE It's not just Gary that makes you wanna go there? 'Cause it's a big place. You might not even see him again. \nHe'd hate to think that's true. But he manages a smile. \nMILO I know. \nEXT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe Honda is loaded with luggage and boxes, some of which are tied to the roof. Milo & Alice stow a final piece. \nMILO When's Brian coming for the TV? \n", "test1_true": "As they head back in, they see a Toyota park at the curb. \nALICE 'Give you guys some time alone. \nShe continues inside. He waits, watches Teddy cross the sidewalk to join him. \nMILO ...You got my E-mail? \nTEDDY And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime. \nMILO Is that how Larry feels? \nTEDDY Uh. Not exactly. \nA brown Buick parks behind Teddy's car. As they speak, a rumpled, 50ish MAN in an off-the-rack suit gets out. \nMILO Wanted to say goodbye to him... \nTEDDY Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five! \nMilo grins, he high-fives Teddy. \nTEDDY We rented a loft in Sunnyvale. (he gives Milo the number) You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms. \nMILO Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff. \nThey embrace. It's awkward, but it's heartfelt. \nINT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER \nMilo enters, reading Teddy's phone number. \nMILO Guess what? They got their -- \nThe rumpled Man sits on a radiator, watching CNN on a TV, the last remaining piece of furniture. Alice enters, holding a jam jar filled water, hands Milo a business card. \nALICE Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the Justice Department. (gives Barton the water) Sorry about the glass. \nMilo reads the card: Lyle Barton, Asst. Prosecutor, DOJ, Seattle Branch Office. Milo's a little spooked. \nBARTON Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant. \nMILO Right... What's that mean again? \nBARTON Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do. \nMILO (fiddling with the card) It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something... \nBARTON Like I said: shot in the dark. \nMilo tries to give back the card. \nBARTON If you see something there that rubs you the wrong way? Do the right thing. \nAnd he goes. \nMILO That took some fun out of -- \nALICE We're not gonna let it. \nShe kisses him. They head out. We linger. On TV a graphic says: SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA: MASS SUICIDE - LIVE. Emergency Medical Personnel roll gurneys with bodies out of a new Mediterranean mansion. Footage shows bodies (including a few children) on bunkbeds, uniformly shod in black Nikes. \nCNN VOICE -- ingested the fatal mixture of sedatives crushed in apple sauce. According to the cult's eerily professional website, it was \"time to move on...\" \nEXT. OUTPOST CORPORATE CAMPUS - DAY \nCrane past identical, low, steel & glass buildings, amid the vast lawns & fir trees... Past a building under construction... To find Redmond's Lexus, cruising. \nINT./EXT. REDMOND'S CAR/CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS \nMilo looks out the window, Redmond gives the tour: \nREDMOND There're 20 buildings, I mean not counting the Gyms, the Day Care, etc. \nThe Day Care is a Michael Graves-looking building with a big cartoon-dog sculpture on its roof, ears cocked to the sky. A Teacher leads her little charges inside. \nREDMOND Gary's put millions in there. And the people with kids? They're not hotshot geeks, they're just payroll clerks or whatever. \nTwo Men in suits, with briefcases, (conspicuous amid the Geeks in jeans and T-shirts) enter Building #19. \nREDMOND You'll see alot of that: Department of Justice goons snooping around. \nThe car pulls into a lot full of Miatas, BMW's, Boxters. \nCLOSE ON - THE OUTPOST LOGO \nTHEN TILT UP TO SHOW: \nEXT. BUILDING 20 QUAD - DAY \nThe logo is of inlaid stone. Redmond & Milo walk over it. Milo carries a box with some personal effects, including a small painting. Redmond wears a photo I.D. tag. \nREDMOND So how'd you like the house? \n", "test1_id": 537, "test2_input": "Gary takes the page. As he reads it over: \nGARY Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid. \nMILO ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a \"system.\" \"Losers,\" who played games of chance. He could \"read\" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious. (he shrugs) His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again. \nGARY What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right? \nMilo thinks: he's testing me. \nMILO No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse. \nGARY ...Worse? \nMILO Cause he was a liar. And I hated him. (mimicking a voice) \"Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world.\" The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- (he shrugs) Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one. \nGARY Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet. \nGary smiles. There's no way to read it. \nEXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT \nEstablish the humble building, in a Park. \nINT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nLisa and Milo sit together in front of a monitor. A Kid does his homework on a computer at the next table. Milo shakes his head, as he scrolls. \nMILO He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire. \nLISA (she's thinking) What about \"60 Minutes.\" \nMILO Yeah, they dig stuff like this. (he types, then reads) \"CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001.\" \nLISA But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like -- \nMILO (he's shaking his head) Say there's just one \"mole\" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for? \nAt the next table, she notices a Lady reading Time. \nLISA Time? \nMILO (types, reads) Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN. (scrolling & scrolling) \"GE joins Outpost in new venture,\" which means NBC is out. \"Disney joins Outpost,\" ABC is out. \"Outpost and Newscorp in new deal,\" Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em. (still scrolling) It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in! \nHOMEWORK KID Shhh. \nMILO Sorry. \nLISA Milo? \nShe's thought of something. He's watching the nerdy Kid, smiling sadly, perhaps identifying with him. \nLISA How close are you? \nMILO What? \nLISA He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this -- (gestures at the screen) mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it. \nMove in on Milo as he thinks it over with a mixture of excitement and skepticism. \nEXT. LIBRARY/PARK - NIGHT \nMilo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library, thinking it through. \nMILO We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet. \nLISA A what? \nMILO It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away. \nLISA But they'd still get the idea, right? \nMILO You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you? \nLISA It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work. \nMILO Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast. \nLISA Before they kill somebody else, too. \nMILO (a new wrinkle) Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions. \nLISA You mean -- break in? \nMILO I don't know -- \nLISA And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished. \nThe complications pile up. They walk. They think. \nLISA I'll go look. (when he looks dubious) They'll just have a few more pictures of me snooping around. \nThey come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the park, stop walking. \n", "test2_true": "LISA I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally? \nGallows humor. What a game girl. He's nuts about her. \nMILO Why were you snooping in my office? \nLISA Oh. (she gets bashful) I liked you. I was checking you out. \nHe kisses her. There are no constraints now, there's no \"adulterous\" guilt: they kiss with a passion deferred. \nINT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nSlow push-in on the phone on Milo's desk: it's ringing. \nINT. ALICE'S STUDIO - CONTINUOUS \nAlice is calling him. Her face hardens, she hangs up. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER \nAs we pan the Best Western decor (in semi-darkness): \nMILO (O.S.) 'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are? \nLISA (O.S.) 'Cause their apartments might be bugged? \nMilo grins. He & Lisa lie in bed. \nMILO I told Teddy about you. \nLISA What'd he say? \nMILO \"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?\" \nShe smiles, rather bashfully. \nMILO I felt guilty. 'Cause I \"owed so much\" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into -- \nLISA Gary. \nIt's painful for him: losing a second father. \nMILO Larry used to say how the guys who wrote the first cool operating systems, like the UNIX guys at Berkeley? They just gave it away. They figured it was human knowledge, it belonged to the world, like Shakespeare or aspirin. 'Know what I'm gonna do after we broadcast the incriminating stuff? Air the Skywire code. Then nobody can have a monopoly. \nINT. ALICE & MILO'S HOUSE - LATER \nAlice is in bed. In the darkness, Milo comes in as quietly as possible. But she switches on the bedside lamp. \nALICE Where were you? (holding his gaze) You know you can't keep anything from me. \nMILO Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle. (is she buying it?) To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you... \nOf course she buys it: it's in the file. \nALICE (she smiles) I won't turn you in. \nINT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING \nShrot and Len go over the print-out of the card entries. \nLEN Every entry was authorized. \nSHROT Keep looking. \nLEN What're we looking for? \nSHROT Any irregularity in the pattern. \nINT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING \nMorning TV is on in the kitchen. A Seattle station airs a puff piece about a party at Gary's house: people in formal clothes (including Gary & his Wife) hold drinks and eat canap\u00e9s on the terrace over Lake Washington. (Gary's haircut is different: it's file footage.) \nTV VOICE Last years' party-goers pledged over $2 million to the Museum; this year's event promises to raise even more. Lured in part by the chance to see the stunning Boyd house... \nAlice, grinding coffee, isn't paying attention. Milo is. \nMILO Look at this. \nALICE What? \nMILO Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you. \nALICE He has thousands of employees, Milo -- \nMILO It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited -- \nALICE Milo -- \nMILO I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life. (he gets up) I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself. \nALICE Milo, you -- \nBut he's out the door. She's not entirely displeased by such a dramatic demonstration of his loyalty to her. \n", "test2_id": 538, "test3_input": "ANGLE: Milo, Alice, Gary, Barry Linder, Clarissa, Ricky. Milo looks utterly preoccupied... \nLINDER The merchandising implications are epic. A kid's watching the movie, he points and clicks at the laser blaster -- before the reel's even over he's ordered the toy. \nALICE But, I mean -- Devil's Advocate -- won't that influence the content? Won't the artists complain? The directors or writers or whoever? \nLINDER Artists? Darling, the only art left in America is business. You're in Picasso's house! \nGary smiles as everyone toasts him, except Milo; he hasn't heard any of it. \nMILO Where's the bathroom? \nLINDER The irreverence! \nLaughter. \nTRACK MILO as he wends his way through laughing, chatting Guests, dread and determination on his face. He moves away from us, enters the \nENTRANCE HALL \nspeaks to the Houseman who guards the residential rooms. \nHOUSEMAN You'll have to use one over there. \nHe indicates an area on Milo's side of the door. \nMILO There's like eight women waiting in line. They take forever. (winces: painful bladder) Please? \nHOUSEMAN Right here. \nHe points to a door immediately behind him. As the Houseman watches, Milo goes into the \nBATHROOM \nHe stands there a moment, breathes deeply. He cracks open the door. The Houseman is turning away another Guest; Milo makes his move. \nDEN-LIKE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nLooking over his shoulder, Milo hurries to a door at the far end of the room, silently cursing the Mondrian that inevitably appears. \nThe Houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom door, assumes Milo's still inside. \nINT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nGary chats with his guests. Alice looks up at the digital art, now a Bosch again. \nINT. GARY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS \nMilo walks fast. As he passes from one room to next, he sees a Mondrian: he's been in this room. All the austere, tastefully decorated rooms are blending together. \nHe stands in the center of the room making quarter turns. Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly- appointed \"den,\" the ultimate expression of bland, rich, professionally-decorated taste. \nHe's lost. \nHe starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS \nThe Houseman looks over his shoulder again. He sees the Mondrian and, in the room beyond that, another Mondrian. \nHe moves to the bathroom door, knocks on it. Opens it. He pulls a sleek walkie-talkie from his jacket. \nINT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS \nMilo, still lost, is getting frantic. He doubles back, cuts toward another wing of the house. Through an open doorway he sees: \nA young, chillingly calm NANNY, watching him. The Baby fusses in her arms. Milo smiles, keeps moving. \nINT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS \nA Second Houseman follows the trail of Mondrians. He sees Mondrians in two different directions. He hesitates, picks a direction, keeps moving. \nINT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary. \nINT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo has finally made it. Sitting at Gary's work station, he slips a CD-ROM into the PC. It floods with text. The music echoes from far off. The entire wall behind him is filled with a Mondrian. \nINT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAs Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary, whispers in his ear. We see Gary smile, excuse himself. He and Alice share a look as he moves off. \nWe go with Gary. His smiles fades instantly. He pushes through Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant \"do;\" he hardly hears them. \nINT. GARY'S WORKROOM - NIGHT \nMilo writes frantically on his tiny pad, copying from the PC screen: \nLONGITUDE - 77 Degrees 03 Minutes 58 Seconds East \nLATITUDE - 38 Degrees 55 Minutes 14 Seconds South \n", "test3_true": "He flips the page, begins entering the fixes for the next satellite. Thinking he's heard something, he looks up. \nNobody's there. \nINT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS \nThe Second Houseman turns in several directions, confused by the trail of Mondrians. Passing into the next room, he runs into a Third Houseman, also confused. Each follows a different Mondrian, in a different room. \nINT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS \nUnlike the Housemen, Gary doesn't follow the paintings. He moves swiftly, seems to know where Milo is. \nGARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo still working... \nPARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAlice looks up at the digital painting: still a Bosch. Her face sets grimly. \nINT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMilo clicks, closing the window. Concentrating, he doesn't see what we see on the wall behind him: the Mondrian drains away... And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch triptych. \nAfter a moment, Milo senses something. \nGary stands in the doorway. Watching him. Milo doesn't breathe. Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's. \nGary comes behind Milo. He reads the screen. It's filled with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down. \nGARY (reading the screen) \"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice...\" (he looks up) You left my party to send E-mail? \nMILO I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons. \nGary stares at Milo. He looks skeptical. The party music floats in from afar as the moment stretches. \nGARY You could've handwritten it. \nMILO I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties. \nGARY Oh, that's right. You're \"clueless.\" \nThis hangs there. \nMILO Gary, I'm sorry if I was rude -- \nThe Second Houseman sticks his head in. \nHOUSEMAN Everything OK, Mr. Boyd? \nGARY No problem. (when he's gone) Is there? \nMILO Gary, I -- \nGARY You see what's hanging on the wall? \nHe looks over. Milo looks over. Among the framed commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood program, written on Outpost 1.0. Gary has had it framed. \nMilo absorbs it. Even now, he feels something for Gary. \nGARY I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are. \nMILO I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more. \nMilo smiles almost tenderly. He doesn't know if Gary buys it. Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes. But they're obscured by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses. \nGary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with the art books, vaguely looks through one. \nGARY When will you have a Beta version? \nMilo wonders: does he know? He picks his words carefully. \nMILO I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software. \nGARY I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting.

The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers. 
SPENGLER (monitoring valences) Full neutronas, maser assist. 
They adjust their settings and prepare to fire. 
STANTZ Throw 'em! 
They trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime. 
VENKMAN (to the firemen) Okay, who knows "Cumbaya?" 
A few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands.  Venkman grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum. 
VENKMAN All right.  Nice and sweet -- (starts singing) Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya -- 
Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding hands and swaying to the music. 
ALL (singing) Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya. 
Stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime. 
STANTZ Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff. 
VENKMAN Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray? 
SPENGLER It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell. 
STANTZ I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it. 
SPENGLER We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol -- 
His eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a line drawing of the Statue of Liberty. 
STANTZ (he sees it, too) Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us -- 
SPENGLER Something good -- 
VENKMAN And pure -- 
WINSTON And decent. 
EXT.  THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 
There is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives with a police escort.  Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor himself and they cross to the museum entrance. 
Hardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the Ghostbusters. 
HARDEMEYER Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control. 
VENKMAN Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one. 
MAYOR Are you telling me there're people trapped in there? 
HARDEMEYER (to his assistant) This is dynamite.  Call A.P., U.P.I., and C.N.N. and get them down here right away. When the police bring this kid out I want them to hand it right to the mayor and I want it all on camera. 
STANTZ Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by midnight, you're going to go down in history as the man who let New York get sucked down into the tenth level of hell. 
The Mayor stops to consider the situation. 
MAYOR (to the Fire Captain) Can you get into that museum? 
FIRE CAPTAIN If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe. 
The Mayor turns to Venkman. 
MAYOR You know why all these things are happening? 
VENKMAN We tried to tell you last night, but Mr. Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony bin. 
Hardemeyer flips out. 
HARDEMEYER This is preposterous!  You can't seriously believe all this mumbo-jumbo!  It's the Twentieth Century, for crying out loud! (viciously, to Venkman) Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff is or how you got it all over the museum, but you better get it off and I mean right now! 
He pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily through the slime curtain.  Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the slime. 
MAYOR (to Venkman) Okay, just tell me what you need.

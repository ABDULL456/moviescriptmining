(quickly) I didn't get it. I'm a terrible shrink, probably... I should've never got out of real estate -- actually I should never have left Ohio for that cowboy in Armarillo -- have you ever been to Amarillo? \nTIN CUP A cowboy? \nMOLLY It's not as romantic when you're actually with one -- a wrangler, y'know -- so of course the oil man in Dallas looked great after that -- I don't know what I was thinking... That's when I went to the gulf and ended up in, well, trailer sales and then all those condos in Corpus Christi -- the bottom fell outta the market and I needed a new gig -- \nTIN CUP A new gig? \nMOLLY Therapy.

I shoulda just layed up, made my par, and moved on. \nMOLLY Look, I want to propose something -- as long as you understand this is professional -- we're not going out together -- \nTIN CUP Tee it up. \nMOLLY I can help you with the mental aspects of the game. You've got Romeo to be your swing doctor, I can be your head doctor. \nTIN CUP But you said you were a lousy shrink? \nMOLLY Well, yeah... I'll improve. \nTIN CUP I got no money to pay for you. \nMOLLY I'll trade my services for golf lessons and help you through the qualifying.

(beat) Behind that twinkle in his eyes is nitroglycerin. \nTin Cup waves and motions to his team. \nTIN CUP Quiet in the gallery!

I'm going over those trees... with a little draw. That way I get home in two. That way I'm putting for eagle. \nROMEO You don't need eagle to qualify!

Dr. Griswold? (to Molly) Dr. Griswold, should I hit the Big Dog or the two? \nSuddenly an OFFICIAL steps forward. \nP.G.A.

Tin Cup turns with amusement to      his playing partners, lest they think management has     lost the upper hand with labor. \nTIN CUP Guess I'm going with the safe shot, boys. \nTin Cup reaches for the two iron, studies it a moment, frowns, and then: \n", "test1_id": 2655, "test2_input": "MOLLY You guys are really being childish -- \nSIMMS Molly, leave this one to me. \nTIN CUP Dr. Griswold, I know what I'm doing. \nTin Cup takes a couple of swings to limber up, aiming out \nonto an open area of the course.   Serious, intent, the look of eagles... \nTIN CUP (to himself) Dollar bills... \nHe takes a full back-swing, opens beautifully, and launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some driving range markers... to \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" from his faithful. \nThe ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further. \nCLINT Them signs are at least thirty yards farther -- that ball musta gone 220... \nTIN CUP That ball's about 2-2-7... toed it a bit... but it'll do... \nREGULARS Nearly 230 with a seven!

You don't think about winning; you just want to look good. (turns away to putt) Thing is, this ain't a beauty pageant.

Finally, you gotta respect a man's doggedness. You know?

Then he walks over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green from it. He walks back for his ball, turns to McCord... and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in Tin Cup's eyes. \nTIN CUP Fifty bucks says I knock it on... with a seven iron. \nAnd he selects the seven iron, addresses the ball right- handed, and: \nHe swings -- the ball rockets low off his club, and... \n... it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and... \n... it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin. \nThe gallery goes crazy as Tin Cup steps from the woods collecting his money from McCord while jabbing a taunting finger at Simms. \n133   INT.

{"train": "TIN CUP Some say it's because that's the best way to play through the winds of West Texas... and some say it's because I never finish anything. You can decide. The point is every finishing position is unique as if that is the signature left to the artist, the warrior athlete who, \nfinally and thereby, has asserted his oneness with and power over the universe by willing a golf ball to go where he wants and how and when, because that is what the golf swing is about... (finally) It is about gaining control of your life, and letting go at the same time. \nMolly stares back, exhausted and intrigued. \nMOLLY Jeez Louise... \nTIN CUP There is only one other acceptable theory of how to hit a golf ball. \nMOLLY I'm afraid to ask. What's the other theory? \nTIN CUP Grip it and rip it. \nMOLLY While I appreciate your poetic sensibility, Mr. McAvoy -- \nTIN CUP Call me Roy, Molly... \nMOLLY Call me Dr. Griswold... \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Roy... but at this point I think I'm more of the 'grip it and rip it' school. Hand me the driver. \nTin Cup does.   She tees it up. \nTIN CUP Waggle it, Doc, don't forget to waggle. (as she stares at him) Waggle... the club head... (shows her) ... it's a little relaxing ritual... \nShe waggles the club head, then takes the club back. \nTIN CUP Let the Big Dog eat! \nShe stops, lets the club fall. \nMOLLY What Big Dog? \nTIN CUP The driver, the number one wood -- \nMOLLY It's metal. \nTIN CUP Yeah, woods are metal -- don't worry about it -- and the driver's known as the Big Dog and I'm just saying to turn him loose, let 'er rip, let the Big Dog eat! \nMOLLY Oh. \nShe swings.   Tops the ball.   It goes ten feet. \nMOLLY This is, without a doubt, the stupidest, silliest, most idiotic grotesquery masquerading as a game that has ever been invented. \nTIN CUP (cheerfully) Yes, ma'am, that's why I love it. (beat) And if you hit one good shot -- if that tuning fork rings in your loin -- you can't wait to get back. \nShe cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night.   It felt great and she knows it. \nMOLLY I think the Big Dog ate something. \nTIN CUP Did the tuning fork ring in your loin? \nMOLLY I wouldn't go that far. \nTIN CUP Always quit on a good shot. We'll call that lesson number one... \n(confidentially) ... and if ya wouldn't mind paying me in cash -- there's a little I.R.S. situation I'm dealing with \nMOLLY If you're such a legendary striker of the golf ball as everyone says, then why are you, at your age, out here in the middle of nowhere operating a barely solvent establishment, ducking the I.R.S., collecting a few pathetic dollars to buy your next sixpack -- when you're capable of so much more? \nHer speech is delivered without judgement or rancor, so matter of factly that he's disarmed. \nTIN CUP Perhaps I'm chocked full of inner demons? \nMOLLY No, you're chocked full of bullshit -- (cheerily) Same time next week? \nShe heads off to the parking lot.    He stares. \nTIN CUP What did you mean I should try 'being saddled' sometime? \nTIN CUP (CONT'D) Were you being literal or was that some kind of Freudian type deal? Molly? Doctor? (beat) What kind of saddle? \nCLOSE ON MOLLY \nAs she walks into the West Texas night.    She smiles, enjoying Tin Cup's confusion. \nTin Cup just stares into the night, holding his cash, until JOSE'S VOICE ECHOES down from the roof. \nJOSE I got it!   Esta bien!    The flag is up! \nCUT TO: \n7   INT. DRIVING RANGE SHACK - NIGHT                           7 \nTin Cup enters, cash in hand, as the regulars all gather excitedly around the TV monitor now coming in. \nTIN CUP A class act there, boys -- probably the first actual `lady type' female ever seen on these premises -- \nROMEO Shut up, boss -- we got the Corpus Christi dog track on the dish -- \nEARL This is yer dead mortal cinch lock bet with Do-reen. \nEveryone's glued to the set. A greyhound race comes on from a remote Texas track on the gulf. \nTIN CUP Free money, boys, what does Doreen know about the fine art of Greyhound breeding? \nROMEO All she knows is she likes the three dog 'cause his name is Pride of Odessa 'cause she's from Odessa. \nSIMMS Like I told you, it was more'n you had in the bag. \nSTADLER Yeah, well... I had to go for it after your caddy said he could get home from here. \nSimms swivels his head around to look at Tin Cup. \nTIN CUP I could. \nSimms looks away, at the shot he's facing: a two hundred fifteen yard carry over water. He looks back at Tin Cup, shaking his head. \nSIMMS I gotta hand it to you, Roy. For fifteen holes you've seemed to grasp the concept here: I'm trying to win and your job is to help me. \nTIN CUP Five percent of your earnings does numb the gag reflex. \nSIMMS Give me the seven iron.   I'm laying up. \nTIN CUP You can make that shot. \nSIMMS The smart play's to lay up. \nTIN CUP These fans didn't pay thirty bucks to watch a tour star lay up on a short par five. \nSIMMS I'm sitting on a two shot lead with three to go, and my partner's in his pocket. Suddenly, par's a good number. Gimme the seven Iron. \nTIN CUP No way. You're going for the green. These fans paid good money to see golf shots they can't hit, not golf shots they feel shitty about themselves for having to hit. \nSimms reaches for the seven iron.   Tin Cup clamps a hand over the club. \nTIN CUP Thirteen years on tour and you're still a pussy. Hit the fucking one iron, Dave. \nSIMMS Thirteen years in a driving range and you still think this game's about your testosterone count. \nSimms removes Tin Cup's hand from the seven iron and grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball. Tin Cup mutters to the gallery. \nTIN CUP Two-fifteen to carry, and the tour star's laying up. \nAnd the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging Simms to go for the green. Simms motions for Tin Cup, as \nif reconsidering. \nSIMMS But if you're gonna editorialize, do it on the other side of the ropes. I got no qualms about firing your ass right here, right now. \nTIN CUP Fire me?   Hell, I should fire you. \nSimms steps back to his ball with the seven iron, and: \n16   Stadler's still standing back where he hit the shot into  16 the lake. MICKELSON and GARY McCORD, the other team in the pairing, are there with him. Romeo, Stadler's caddie, stands just behind them. \nMcCORD (to Mickelson) I know you could knock it on from here, I'm just saying that caddie's been drinking muddy water if he thinks he can. \nROMEO He can. \nAll the players look at Romeo as: \nSimms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of the water to a smattering of polite applause. \nSimms tosses the club back to his bag as Tin Cup retrieves the divot. And: \nSTADLER Hey, Dave!   We in a hurry? \nSimms looks several yards back where Stadler is still standing with McCord and Mickelson. \nSTADLER 'Cause I just bet McCord and Mickelson that your caddie could knock it on from here. \nSIMMS We're trying to win a tournament, pardo. \nSTADLER I know.    But I'm getting five to one. \n17   EXT. TV TOWER                                                17 \nThe ANNOUNCER from the GOLF CHANNEL looks at the monitor where a hand-held camera is picking up Stadler motioning Tin Cup over. \nGOLF CHANNEL ANNOUNCER From two-fifty from a snarly lie, over water, on national TV, with no warmup... I'd give ten to one to a tour pro. \n18   BACK TO COURSE                                               18 \nStadler, McCord, and Mickelson are smiling at the bet. \nThis is golf. But Simms snarls at being challenged. Stadler drops a ball in the rough for Tin Cup to hit. \nSTADLER Here ya go.   Take a hack at it. \nSIMMS Balls versus brains, Roy. You hit that shot, just keep walking, 'cuz your ass is fired. \nTin Cup mulls over the warning, as: \nSTADLER, McCORD, MICKELSON Come on, Roy!    Your fans are calling! \nStadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery. Tin Cup puts down Simms's golf bag. \nTIN CUP How you gonna fire me in front of all these people? Especially when I knock it on the green. \nAnd he heads over to where Stadler and the others stand waiting. \n19   OMITTED                                                      19 \nPETER KOSTIS, with a hand mike, following the group, begins to describe the extraordinary event unfolding. \nKOSTIS (on mike) It seems like the Charity Tournament is taking a little \nDoreen dances in a yellow rose outfit, a more classic strip look than her protegees. \nCLOSE ON ROW OF DOLLAR BILLS \nheld aloft by the eager locals in the front row... and then a handful of papers held aloft by one Roy McAvoy, also in the front row. \nDoreen dances over and picks the papers from his hand, reading them as she dances. \nDOREEN The DieHard/West Texas Calcutta, the Duvall County Boys Club Pro/ Scratch, Woody's Steak House One Club Scramble... what do I want with all these entry forms? \nTIN CUP It's a business proposition. I'm offering you my winnings from all them tournaments this summer. \nDOREEN In exchange for what? \nTIN CUP My driving range back. \nShe dances away from him, not exactly sold on the idea. \nShe dances back to him, reclines a leg on the partition, and moves her face opposite his. \nDOREEN Roy, I'm not as dumb as my hair makes me look. \nTIN CUP They ain't all strictly minor league. One of 'em pays almost two grand! \nShe twirls off.    He chases her, beer and entries in hand. \nTIN CUP Now wait, Doreen. You gotta do the math, and you gotta look at how good I'm playing. I hit the shot of the tournament at the best-ball. They put it on national TV. \nDOREEN I saw. \nTIN CUP And what does that tell you? \nThe MUSIC comes to an END.   The club is momentarily silent. \nTIN CUP (shouting) And what does that tell you? \nDOREEN It tells me you took an unauthorized day off. Next time it happens, you're fired. In the meantime, I'm putting in a time clock. \nTIN CUP I'm not punching in no time \nclock like some working stiff! \nCUT TO: \n27   INT. DRIVING RANGE - NEXT DAY                               27 \nTin Cup punches the new time clock which is located under the awning near the ball wash. \nKACHUNK goes the TIME CLOCK as he hurries outside -- \n29   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY                                    29 \n-- and there he finds Molly, waiting on the tee with her driver and a bucket of balls. \nTIN CUP Am I early? \nMOLLY Mr. McAvoy, I can appreciate that you have a fairly laid-back, relaxed lifestyle -- but I have hours to keep. \nTIN CUP A former paramour once ascribed my fluid sense of time to being born under the sign of Pisces -- something about floating through the universe -- \nHe tees a ball for her and steps back.   She's staring at him, half-amused. \nMOLLY You amuse me, Roy. But I'm the only woman in America born after World War II who thinks astrology is a crock of shit. (beat) Now let's see if the Big Dog'll eat. \nTIN CUP Waggle. \nMOLLY I'm waggling... \nTIN CUP Set up to the ball like I showed you last time. \nMolly addresses the shot.    Her stance is rigid, overly \nmechanical.   Tin Cup winces.    But she looks terrific. \nTIN CUP Quit trying to wring that club's neck, Molly. Show it a little warmth and compassion... \nHe moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders. \nTIN CUP Remember, this game's about trust and touch and letting go. So while I'm subtly enhancing your technical prospects, why don't you tell me all about your personal life... \nMOLLY It's none of your fucking business, Roy. \nTin Cup's hands move down to square her hips.    He's discreet and professional. \nTIN CUP Your boyfriend's a golfer -- that's my bet -- and he's why you're taking this game up. Hell, I probably even know him -- \nSIMMS (O.S.) Get your hands off her ass, Roy. \nAnd, as Tin Cup's hands recoil in alarm... \nDAVID SIMMS steps onto the range. \nMOLLY (to Simms) Hi, sweetie... \nTIN CUP Not him... \nCLOSE ON TIN CUP \nCrushed and bewildered. \nAnd he rips a drive down the fairway. \nBOONE Nutted it. \nTin Cup selects the baseball bat from his golf bag. Romeo hands him a pink ball and Tin Cup shows it to Boone. \nTIN CUP I'll be playing a Pink Lady today. \nBOONE That little pink fag ball supposed to rattle me? \nTin Cup moves over to the tee markers. \nTIN CUP Not unless I knock it by you. \nAnd he tosses up the Pink Lady and fungoes it long and straight down the fairway. \nCUT TO: \n34   EXT. MESQUITE FIRST FAIRWAY - DAY                           34 \nTin Cup stops at his ball, and looks twenty yards back to \nwhere Boone has arrived with his caddie at his drive. \nTIN CUP Yep, I caught this thing way the Hell on the toe. \nBoone knocks an iron onto the edge of the green. \nBOONE Drive for show, putt for dough, big shot. \nTIN CUP Did you hear that, Romeo? Boone was being profound! He has revealed to me the essential mystery of golf! Drive for show, putt for dough... (holds out a palm) Louisville Slugger, please. \nBoone's a little rattled by Tin Cup's insouciance. \nROMEO You got Boone shakin' already -- (studying the approach) Front left bunker's your best angle to the pin. \nTIN CUP (calling his shot) Front left bunker -- plugged lie. \nHe tosses up the ball and fungoes a lazy fly ball. \nCUT TO: \n35   EXT. MESQUITE 1ST GREEN AND SAND TRAP - DAY                 35 \nBoone gazes with malicious delight at Tin Cup's ball, buried in the front left bunker. He watches Tin Cup take the hoe from Romeo and move down into the trap. \nBOONE I want to see a legitimate swing. No scooping. \nTin Cup holds up a hand like a gallery marshal requesting silence. \nTIN CUP Stand, please.     Gallery, please, stand. \nHe addresses the ball, choking down on the hoe, positioning the blade at an odd angle. He hacks at the ball with an unorthodox chopping motion. The ball pops up in the air, lands on the green, releases and rolls up a foot from the hole. \nBoone's jaw drops. Tin Cup hit an impossible shot with utter ease and facility. \nTIN CUP I'll finish. \nTin Cup trades Romeo the shovel for the rake, takes the pin out of the hole, and pool cues the putt home. Par. Boone looks at his own sixty-foot putt and he knows he's just been had... utterly, embarrassingly, and thoroughly. \nWithout a word he counts four hundred dollars from his roll and drops it on the green. \nBOONE Get the hell off my course. \n38   EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY                                        38 \nTin Cup and Romeo emerge, Romeo carrying T.C.'s sticks. \nTIN CUP Listen, swami, your job is to teach me patience and humility, not to advise me on my love life. \nROMEO No. My job is to get your head straight so you can qualify for The Open, much less win it. To get your head straight you got to forget about the doctor lady. \nThey head up the street under a collonade toward Tin Cup's waiting Caddy. \nTIN CUP Not all my thinking occurs below the belt. I actually stand for a few things beside where my next romantic interlude is coming from. \nROMEO Then you got no problem telling the doctor lady you can't teach her no more till after the Open. \nTin Cup blinks silently a moment, feeling slightly cornered. \nTIN CUP That would make an issue of something that ain't an issue. Besides, I'm focused. \nRomeo responds with a Spanish curse. \nTIN CUP I mean, this is my quest! \nROMEO Ahhh... your quest... chingaso... \nTIN CUP This is where I stand up for all the little guys everywhere who've had their fill of soulless robots like David Simms -- \nROMEO He may be a soulless robot but he's a rich, happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend who's got you by the huevos -- (beat) Besides, how is getting into the U.S. Open gonna change what she thinks about you? \nTIN CUP It'll prove to her that I'm not who she thinks I am. \nROMEO But you are who she thinks you are! Look, I don't bet on a horse with a hard-on. \nTIN CUP Hard-on?! Hard-on?! Hard-on?! Here, touch me, feel -- (as Tin Cup grabs himself) I don't feel nothing! Here! \nROMEO (embarrassed) Hey, hey... shit... cool it... \nCUT TO: \n42    INT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - FEW BEATS LATER - DAY                42 \nTin Cup is dutifully lying on the couch because he heard that's what you do. He stares at the ceiling. Molly enters and sits down. \nMOLLY Roy... are you okay? \nTIN CUP I need therapy. \nMOLLY Obviously. \nTIN CUP What do I do? I mean... to do it ... therapy... I mean, how do I start doing... it. \nMOLLY In parlance you might understand, just kick back and let the Big Dog eat. \nHe sighs and plunges in. \nTIN CUP Okay, okay, let 'er rip... (deep breath) Suppose there's this guy. He's standing on the shore of a big, wide river. And the river's fulla all manner of disaster, like alligators and piranhas and currents and eddies, and most people won't even go down there to dip a toe. But on the other side of the river's a million dollars, and on this side of the river there's a rowboat. I guess my question's this: What would possess the guy on shore to swim for it? \nMOLLY He's an idiot. \nTIN CUP No. He's a hell of a swimmer, see. His problem's more like... why's he always gotta rise to the challenge? \nMOLLY He's a juvenile idiot. \nTIN CUP You don't understand what I mean by the river. \nMOLLY We're talking about you and what you like to call your inner demons, Roy, that human frailty you like to blather about, not some mytho-poetic metaphor you come up with in a feeble and transparent effort to do yourself credit. \nTIN CUP Y'mean you're gonna make me feel lousy? I came here to feel better -- what kinda therapy is this? \nMOLLY You don't have any inner demons. What you have is inner crapola, inner debris -- garbage, loose wires, horseshit in staggering amounts. \nTIN CUP I ain't just some jerk driving- range pro who drinks too much booze and eats too few vegetables. \nMOLLY You're being defensive -- cut to the chase and tell me why you're here. \nTIN CUP Well... I'm smitten with a woman. \nMOLLY That's good.   Is she smitten with you? \nTIN CUP Not yet. \nMOLLY Have you asked her out? \nTIN CUP She's seeing a guy. I don't know how serious it is, but the guy's a real horse's ass, in my opinion... \nMOLLY If you shared your heart with this woman -- maybe asked her out to dinner -- then it would force these issues out in the open. \nTIN CUP I'm afraid she'll say no. \nMOLLY Ahh... so what you're saying is that all your speeches about swimming across the shark infested waters are really just about your golf game -- not about your personal life. \nTIN CUP Christ, I didn't know we were gonna get into my personal life! \nMOLLY This is therapy! \nTIN CUP Well, jeez, I know, but I didn't think it was that kind of therapy... \nMOLLY What were you expecting?    Ann Landers? \nTIN CUP Yeah. \nMOLLY Look, it's rather simple. Those risks that you love to take on the golf course, the risks you talk so passionately and poetically about -- you need to apply those risks to your personal life with the same passion. \nTIN CUP I should ask this woman out. \nMOLLY Yes! \nTIN CUP I should risk coming right over the top and snap-hooking it out of bounds left. \nMOLLY Yes! \nTIN CUP Risk hitting it a little thin and -- \nMOLLY For Godsakes, Roy, that's enough! \nTIN CUP Right.   Sorry. \nMOLLY S'okay... (beat) Look, just walk up to this woman, wherever she is, look her in the eye with those big beautiful green eyes of yours, let down your guard and don't try to be smooth or cool or whatever -- just be honest and take the risk -- you can do it! \nTin Cup rises with new confidence. He does several deep breathing exercises, trying to work up the courage. She stares at him. And he walks right up to her. \nTIN CUP Dr. Griswold -- I think I'm in \nlove with you. \nMolly is stunned. \nMOLLY What?! \nTIN CUP From the moment I first saw you I knew I was through with bar girls and strippers and motorcycle chicks, and when you started talking I was smitten and I'm smitten more every day I think about you -- and the fact that you know I'm full of crapola only makes you more attractive to me because usually I can bullshit people but I can't bullshit you and in addition, most women I'm thinking about how to get into their pants from Day One but with you I'm just thinking about how to get into your heart -- \nMolly was clue-less.   She just stares. \nMOLLY My God... \nTIN CUP (optimistically, proudly) Stunned, eh? So what about dinner and we can talk about `us' and if we have a future and how to drop that horse's ass boyfriend of yours -- \nA KNOCK at the door.   He's startled. \nTIN CUP Debt collection? Process server? \nEx-flame? Jesus, I'm clean. (disguises his voice) Who is it? \nThe door opens -- Molly enters. He's surprised but well- settled into his bath of cynicism. \nMOLLY God, you've got a beautiful swing -- \nTIN CUP -- And big, beautiful green eyes -- I'm a beautiful guy. \nMOLLY I came here to apologize. \nTIN CUP For what? \nMOLLY Well, I counseled you, you did exactly what I said, and I just... poured cold water over your effort. (quickly) I didn't get it. I'm a terrible shrink, probably... I should've never got out of real estate -- actually I should never have left Ohio for that cowboy in Armarillo -- have you ever been to Amarillo? \nTIN CUP A cowboy? \nMOLLY It's not as romantic when you're actually with one -- a wrangler, y'know -- so of course the oil man in Dallas looked great after that -- I don't know what I was thinking... That's when I went to the gulf and ended up in, well, trailer sales and then all those condos in Corpus Christi -- the bottom fell outta the market and I needed a new gig -- \nTIN CUP A new gig? \nMOLLY Therapy.    I took all the classes. \nI'm licensed, y'know. (suddenly dejected) Oh God... (reaching into her purse) Mind if I smoke? (lights up) Anyway, I'm flattered you asked me out. I can't accept because I am involved with David and I haven't seen any evidence that he treats old people, kids or dogs badly. \nTIN CUP I got a little carried away, I guess. I shoulda just layed up, made my par, and moved on. \nMOLLY Look, I want to propose something -- as long as you understand this is professional -- we're not going out together -- \nTIN CUP Tee it up. \nMOLLY I can help you with the mental aspects of the game. You've got Romeo to be your swing doctor, I can be your head doctor. \nTIN CUP But you said you were a lousy shrink? \nMOLLY Well, yeah... I'll improve. \nTIN CUP I got no money to pay for you. \nMOLLY I'll trade my services for golf lessons and help you through the qualifying. If you get into the Open, well, you're on your own. \nTIN CUP You'll be with David. \nMOLLY Yeah... \nSilence.   A deal.   It's the best they can do. \nCUT TO: \n47   EXT. COTTONWOOD - FIRST TEE - MORNING                     47 \nLocal qualifier. The First Tee of the Local Open Qualifier. And the voice of the starter. \nSTARTER (V.O.) ... the next group... Roy McAvoy, Salome, Texas... who will be playing with... \nThe regulars applaud and whistle and shout way too many \"You the man's!\" as Tin Cup steps onto the first tee, followed by his Sancho Panza, Romeo. Tin Cup is feeling on top of the world, at his cocky best. \nROMEO How ya feelin', boss? \nTIN CUP I'm feelin' like par's a bad score, podnuh -- fifty-eight's within the realm! \nROMEO Jesus, the doctor lady's here -- \nPOV SHOT - MOLLY \nstanding not far from the regulars. \nTIN CUP Didn't I tell ya? She's gonna be your guru partner. You handle my swing mechanics and she handles my brain mechanics. \nROMEO Long as you keep your dick out of it -- \nTIN CUP Me an' the 'big guy' have an understanding. He's gonna lie low till I get in the Open -- then... then... \nROMEO The Big Dog'll eat? \nTIN CUP The Big Dog'll hunt, that's for sure... \nTin Cup steps up to the tee, a couple quick limber \nswings, and he tees it up.   As he does, Romeo slips over to Molly. \nROMEO (softly) Looks like we partners, Dr. Molly \nMOLLY I just have to help him keep his head on straight -- \nROMEO If you can, you be the first. \nMOLLY He does have the occasional tendency towards self-destruction it seems. \nROMEO It ain't occasional and it ain't no tendency -- it's a fact of life that he gonna blow sky high, it's just a matter of when and how fast can the pieces be put back together. (beat) Behind that twinkle in his eyes is nitroglycerin. \nTin Cup waves and motions to his team. \nTIN CUP Quiet in the gallery! A man's trying to do his job. \nAnd Tin Cup uncoils a mighty drive with an elegant stroke, fully confident and smooth. The gallery applauds. \nHe snaps it over his knee. He dumps these halves on the ground with the halves of the driver and three wood. \nRomeo stares, aghast.   Tin Cup merely shrugs. \nTIN CUP Sometimes I fan that two iron. Better gimme the three. \nRomeo warily hands Tin Cup the three iron.    Tin Cup looks at it, frowns, then: \nHe snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground. \nMolly leans over to the regulars. \nMOLLY Is this normal behavior for him? \nEARL The word 'normal' and him don't collide in the same sentence too often. \nShe watches in amazement as -- \nTIN CUP Sometimes I catch that three a little thin... \nHe drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven iron from his bag. \nHe snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire. \nTIN CUP And I've hooked my four iron... (snap) ... and hit flyers with the five... (snap) ... and shanked the six... (snap) ... and skulled the eight... (snap) ... and fatted the nine... (snap) ... and chili-dipped the wedge... (snap) ... and bladed the sand wedge... (snap; then pauses to reflect contemptuously on his putter) ... and then there's Mister Three-putt... \nHe snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of \nbroken clubs at his feet. \nThen, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seven iron. The regulars hold their breath, thinking this is the end of Tin Cup's Open bid. But... \nTin Cup smiles and caresses the seven iron affectionately. \nTIN CUP But the seven iron, I never miss the seven iron. It's the only truly safe club in my bag. \nHe moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down the middle with the seven iron. \nTIN CUP You happy, Romeo? \nROMEO No, boss, I'm tired... my life's too short to spend it watching you fall apart. I done it too many times. \nRomeo turns and starts walking away. \nTIN CUP What's this? You're quitting? First sign of adversity, you're quitting? (as Romeo continues) Anyone want to bet me I can't par in with a seven iron? (to Molly) Doc? Take the bet? \nMOLLY Roy -- just shut up and hit the ball. \nCUT TO: \n54   QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS                                      54 \nTin Cup's magic with a seven iron.   He drives with a seven iron. \n55   He chips with a seven iron.                                55 \n56   He blasts out of sand with an open-bladed seven iron.      56 \nCUT TO: \n57   EXT. COTTONWOOD LOCAL QUALIFIER - EIGHTEENTH HOLE - DAY     57 \nTin Cup drains a ten foot putt -- also with the seven iron, and left-handed to boot. He's past the local qualifier. \nThe regulars erupt in cheers.   You'd have thought he won the Masters. \nAnd Tin Cup shrugs to the tiny gallery, with insouciance and cockiness, and pronounces -- \nTIN CUP An easy game, this golf... \nCUT TO: \n58   EXT. 19TH HOLE - OUTDOOR BAR - DAY (LATER)                  58 \nTin Cup holds court surrounded by his regulars and much of the gallery. He's a local hero -- but Molly's not impressed. \nA WAITRESS delivers a tray of long neck beers. \n19TH HOLE WAITRESS Beer for everybody. \nCLINT You the man, Tin Cup! \nA toast is raised to their king, and Tin Cup eats it up. \nTIN CUP Thanks, boys, what'ya think was my best shot -- the seven iron on twelve, the seven iron on fourteen, or maybe it was the bunker shot on eighteen which, to my recollection was a -- seven iron? \nMuch laughter.   This is the Tin Cup they love. \nEARL You definitely the man! \nTIN CUP How'd I do, Doc? \nMOLLY (cheerfully) You failed miserably. \nTIN CUP What?! I parred the back nine with a seven iron, I qualified for the regionals, I -- \nMOLLY Your job is not just to qualify for the Open, it's to prepare for the Open. My job is to help you prepare. \nTIN CUP You said to 'trust my feelings'! \nMOLLY You guys are really being childish -- \nSIMMS Molly, leave this one to me. \nTIN CUP Dr. Griswold, I know what I'm doing. \nTin Cup takes a couple of swings to limber up, aiming out \nonto an open area of the course.   Serious, intent, the look of eagles... \nTIN CUP (to himself) Dollar bills... \nHe takes a full back-swing, opens beautifully, and launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some driving range markers... to \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" from his faithful. \nThe ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further. \nCLINT Them signs are at least thirty yards farther -- that ball musta gone 220... \nTIN CUP That ball's about 2-2-7... toed it a bit... but it'll do... \nREGULARS Nearly 230 with a seven!    Pureed it, baby, he pureed it! \nTin Cup hands Simms the seven iron. \nTIN CUP Take a minute to limber up, fine with me -- \nSIMMS Don't need to. \nSimms is still in a sport jacket, slacks, no golf shoes. \nTIN CUP Take your jacket off? \nSIMMS No, no, I'm fine. \nSimms drops a ball about where Tin Cup's sat.   He stands above the ball and addresses it. \nTIN CUP (cockily) You're gonna need to muscle up, big guy -- give it the old steroid jerk... \nSimms is cool as ice. He smiles, then moves around to the other side of the ball, suddenly facing away from the course. This baffles everyone. \nREGULARS What the hell you doin'?    Wha's this? \nAnd David Simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward the desert, onto the lonely highway... \n59   ... and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces, for    59 About three miles, forever. It's probably still going... \n60   CLOSE ON TIN CUP                                            60 \nThe hustler's been hustled. \nCLOSE ON MOLLY \nShe shrugs and smiles. \nCUT TO: \n61   EXT. COTTONWOOD CLUBHOUSE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)             61 \nMolly drives away in Simms' car -- followed by Simms in Tin Cup's Cadillac convertible. Simms waves. \nTin Cup and the Regulars stand alone. Weakly, lamely, a couple of the Regulars speak. Without conviction. \nCLINT You the man, Roy... \nEARL You definitely the man... \nCUT TO: \n62   INT. GOLDEN TASSEL - NIGHT                                  62 \nA nearly nude dancer named SAMMANTHA on stage to a big Saturday night crowd. Tin Cup's in the front row, sitting with Doreen and a beer. Disconsolate. \nP.A. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Bring out those bills, boys, if ya wanta see a little more of Sammantha! \nGuys pull out singles and larger bills around the runway, placing them on the railing for the gyrating stripper. \nSAMMANTHA (to Tin Cup) Hey, honey... \nTin Cup tosses some money onstage with a lackluster wave, he's depressed -- or something. \nTIN CUP Hey, honey... \nDOREEN I heard you qualified for the Regionals -- why you so down? \nTIN CUP I broke my clubs -- don't ask why, my caddie's pissed off at me, I lost my wheels in a sucker bet, and my shrink thinks I'm a fool -- 'cause I probably am... \nDOREEN You're seeing a therapist?! \nTIN CUP Yeah, what's wrong with that? \nDOREEN Only way you'd ever go into therapy was if the shrink was a doll and you were trying to get her into the rack -- \nTIN CUP You're so shallow. The Good Doctor and I are dealing with my regression and denial -- \nDOREEN Oh, Tin Cup, what a crock.    You got a hard-on. \nA GUY from the next table leans over, interrupting. \nGUY You `Tin Cup'?     Won the Local with a seven iron? \nUnfazed, Tin Cup steps up to hit again, but... once more -- \nThwock! -- Another horrible-looking squib to the right. \nRomeo stops washing balls and notices, watching Tin Cup. \nThwock, thwock! -- Something's terribly wrong. \nCLOSE ON TIN CUP \nConcern crosses his face. \nTIN CUP Romeo! \nROMEO I'm watching. \nTIN CUP It ain't no chili dipper. \nROMEO Yeah, boss, you got the 'S' word. \nTIN CUP What am I doing wrong? \nROMEO Shanks are like a virus -- they just show up. Nobody can figure 'em out. \nThwock, thwock, thwock! -- Three more chili dippers.   Our man definitely has the shanks. And he's panicking. \nTIN CUP Romes!   Something's terribly wrong.   What's your guess?! \nROMEO It's the woman. \nTIN CUP I thought you said it was a virus? \nROMEO A woman can have the same effect. \nTIN CUP What do I do? \nROMEO Keep swinging... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n80   EXT. RANGE - THAT NIGHT (MUCH LATER)                          80 \nThwock, thwock, thwock! -- Night has fallen and he still has the shanks. \nThe regulars have gathered and are huddled, murmuring. The word has spread like wildfire -- Tin Cup has the shanks. \nCLINT Never thought it would happen... \nEARL The shanks is for us mortals, not \nfor the great ones... \nJOSE Esta muy feo... muy, muy feo... \n(It is very ugly, very, very ugly...) \nTin Cup angrily throws his club out into the night and turns to the regulars. \nTIN CUP Y'know why they named this game 'golf'? 'Cause the words 'fuck' and 'shit' were already taken! \nA CAR HORN HONKS -- All heads turn to see: \nPOV SHOT - PINK CORVETTE \npulls in -- Doreen gets out, carrying a big package. \nDOREEN Hiya, fellas! \nTIN CUP What is this? Everybody like to watch a train wreck?! \nDoreen approaches the regulars, and we notice for the first time that there are a number of bags and packages with the boys. \nDOREEN He's in one of his pleasant moods, I see -- \nROMEO He's got the shanks. We got the makings of a Greek tragedy here. \nDOREEN (shouting to Tin Cup) Quit whining and get over here. We've got something for you. \nTin Cup drags his sorry ass to the group. \nTIN CUP Unless it's a 'swing thought,' I'm not interested... \nDOREEN (ignoring his attitude) We're here to sponsor you in the \nOpen. Me an' the boys have pooled our resources and come up with some cash so you can look and feel as spiffy as all them big-name pros. \nTIN CUP But I got the shanks -- \nDOREEN Yeah, and you obviously still have a hard-on for the doctor chick -- your face is all screwed up and tight like you haven't been laid in awhile -- \nTIN CUP Is it really that obvious? \nDOREEN It's not a good look for you. Roy, your heart is not the only organ you wear on your sleeve. There's a certain, vulgar appeal to your transparency. \nTin Cup shrugs.   She always has him outflanked. \nCLINT C'mon, Tin Cup, we're trying to make you a presentation -- \nTIN CUP Awright, awright... \nMolly starts laughing -- He is destroyed. \nTIN CUP The therapist laughs at her patient? Is that how it works? A man is laid bare before God and he's the butt of the cosmic joke? \nMOLLY I'm sorry, I just... \nTIN CUP Some of this shit might actually \nwork, y'know... I mean I think there's something to this hat with the pendulum golf ball thing... may be on to something here... \nMOLLY Oh, Roy, Jesus... Quoting yourself, 'It is the paraphernalia for lost and desperate souls.' \nTin Cup lets down. The wind goes out of his sails and he loses his defensiveness. \nTIN CUP Well, God damn... a lost and desperate soul stands before you. (beat) I assume I have the confidentiality of doctor-client privilege in regards to this outfit? \nMOLLY Of course you do. What happened? \nTIN CUP I got the shanks. \nMOLLY Are you taking penicillin? \nTIN CUP It can't be treated! It's much worse than whatever you thought it was. (beat) There's a glitch in my swing. \nMOLLY So it's in Romeo's department? \nTIN CUP He thinks it's your department -- says it's a head thing. \nMOLLY Oh. Well. I just came over to congratulate you on the regionals and return your car -- David says he doesn't want it, just wanted to make a point with you -- (beat) But I suppose we could have a therapy session right here and now \nTIN CUP I don't want therapy. I want you. \nMOLLY Roy...   I gotta get some air -- \nTIN CUP Look at me -- (considering what that means) Well, not right at the moment -- but listen to me. You're with the wrong guy. I'm the right guy. Everyone tells me my face is all screwed up tight as a drum 'cause I've been crazy about you from the day you showed up wearing this stupid stuff and the whole damn thing has both inspired me to get here on the verge of greatness yet it's also caused me to get the shanks which could humiliate me in front of a zillion people. (beat) Such is life. So dump that phony bastard and come to the Open in my corner -- you can delay your romantic urges, which I know are lurking in there among the excess of brain cells you possess -- until the appropriate time... (beat) Tell me you're not at least moderately attracted to me. \nTin Cup stands there with the ball still dangling from his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows -- for the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks. \nMOLLY You have moments. \nTIN CUP Tell me which ones are my moments and I'll try to duplicate them. \nMOLLY This is a moment. You look great. \nTIN CUP Now?! \nMOLLY Utterly exposed, completely vulnerable, the inner child trying to get out. \nTIN CUP My inner child needs spanking. \nMOLLY You always liked that part about saddling up, the smell of leather \nTIN CUP C'mon, let's have a drink. Call it therapy. Charge me 75 an hour. Little Cuervo, little Freud... \nShe's thinking about it. \nMOLLY Naw... I gotta go. (turns to leave) Oh, I don't have a car, I need a ride. \nCUT TO: \n83   EXT. ALONG RIVER BACK TO TOWN - DAY                       83 \nTin Cup and Molly in his convertible.   He works on her without pushing too hard. \nTIN CUP I know a spot along the river's great to watch the sunset? \nMOLLY Not tonight. \nTIN CUP 'Not tonight' means maybe some other night? \nMOLLY I didn't mean it like that. \nTIN CUP Consciously you didn't mean it like that -- but how about unconsciously, you're the expert, did you mean it unconsciously? \nMOLLY Unconsciously, Roy, I don't have a clue what I'm talking about. \nTIN CUP I feel we're making progress. \nMOLLY I do too. But I have no idea what it's progress towards... \nA84     EXT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DUSK                                 A84 \nThe Caddy pulls up in front of her office at the new mall. She gets out. \nMOLLY Good luck in the Open, Roy. \nTIN CUP Put your money on me, Doc, the odds are fabulous and God knows I'm overdue... \nHe drives away, and we stay: \nCLOSE ON MOLLY \nWatching Tin Cup careen away in his Caddy. \nCUT TO: \n84/85   EXT. SOUTHWESTERN HIGHWAY - DAY                            84/85 \nThe intrepid Winnebago on the way to the Open.    Romeo drives -- Tin Cup stares out the window. \nSIMMS Hiya, Roy... welcome to the big leagues... (checks the list) Here ya go, Charlie, his name's right here. (to Tin Cup) They spelled your name wrong -- easy mistake with a total unknown. \nSECURITY GUARD (to Cop) Let him in. \nSimms smiles at Tin Cup, the easy smile of a man on top. \nTin Cup doesn't respond, just asks the Guard: \nTIN CUP Which way to the practice range? \nAs Tin Cup tries to regain some dignity, and climbs back into the Winnebago -- \nSECURITY GUARD (to Simms) He said he was a 'legend'? \nSIMMS Oh he is... he's a very big name at a driving range in Salome, Texas... \nThey all have a good laugh, and -- \nCUT TO: \n91   EXT. PRACTICE RANGE - DAY                                   91 \nLots of the big names are there.   Romeo is like a kid at the ballpark. \nROMEO Look! Right there! Fred Couples... and Ray Floyd! \nRomeo notices that Tin Cup is staring at the pile of practice balls lying there on the tee. \nTIN CUP Look at these balls. Brand new Titleists. Lookit 'em, every one a brand new Titleist. (lowers his voice) Sneak a few in the bag when you get a chance. We swipe enough free shit we might even pay for this fiasco. \nTin Cup limbers up, trying not to be in awe of the real legends who line the practice range, hitting beautiful shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease. \nROMEO You think it would be inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd for an autograph? \nTIN CUP I think it's a dead giveaway, Romes... but if I still got the shanks we're gonna be found out real fast... \nTin Cup nudges a ball from the pile into address position. Romeo hands him a different club. \nROMEO Hit the seven iron. You never miss the seven... \nTIN CUP Good thought, Pods... \nTin Cup waggles, shakes, limbers, addresses... \nTIN CUP Dollar bills... \nAnd he swings. \nTHWOCK! A hideous shank squirrels across line, almost hitting a group of U.S. Open officials. Heads turn. \nTIN CUP (to anyone who'll listen) Who hit that shot? Anybody see? \nHe addresses another one.   And swings. \nTHWOCK!   A disaster.   He crumbles. \nROMEO A little thin, Boss. \nTIN CUP A little fucking thin?! I still got the shanks! Everybody's watching! Christ, Simms is here... \nSimms has arrived and is watching Tin Cup with delight as he loosens up. \nROMEO Maybe we should work on putting. Ya can't shank a putt. \nTin Cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to strike another ball. \nTIN CUP If you're the Mexican Mac O'Grady, Romes, you gotta figure out why I'm still shanking the ball. (beat) What's the problem? I'm catching it on the hosel, right? Moving my head? I'm laying off it, I'm pronating, I'm supinating, I'm clearing too early, I'm clearing too late, I'm off plane, I ain't dropping in -- oh, God, my swing feels like an unfolding lawn chair. \nROMEO You got a virus in your brain.   I \ngot to kill the brain to kill the virus. \nTIN CUP Anything.   Kill me now! \nROMEO Put all your change in your right pocket. \nTin Cup follows orders, not questioning the logic. \nROMEO Very good. Now tie your left shoelace in a double knot. \nAgain, Tin Cup dutifully follows orders. \nROMEO Esta bueno. Now, turn your hat around backwards and put a blue tee behind your right ear... \nTIN CUP I'll look like a fool. \nROMEO What you think you look like hitting those squirrelly chili peppers up Freddy Couples' ass, eh? Do what I say or I quit. \nTIN CUP Okay, okay... \nROMEO Perfect... now hit a seven iron into that tree over there. You're ready. \nTin Cup hits a perfect seven iron into the trees. \nTIN CUP How'd I do that? \nROMEO You ain't thinking about shanking, you ain't thinking about the doctor lady, you ain't thinking period. You just lookin' like a fool and hittin' it pure -- your natural state. \nTIN CUP Fuck you. \nTIN CUP The Anti-Christ shoots 67, you believe it? \nROMEO Ol' Anti-Christ got a hot putter... \nSIMMS (V.O.) (on television) ... you see, this game is all about integrity and tradition and honor... \nTIN CUP What? It's about cheating and racism and bullshit! \nROMEO Easy, boss... \nCUT TO: \n96   EXT. JUST OFF EIGHTEENTH - DAY (SAME TIME)               96 \nLive coverage of the Simms interview. Molly is among a small crowd gathered to watch. He doesn't seem to know that she's there. \nSIMMS (live on mike) So tomorrow I'll just go out there and try to make some good swings and, Lord willing, maybe I can put up another good number. Thank you. \nNANTZ Thank you, David Simms, a brilliant opening round 67 to take the lead. \nSimms walks away, now off-camera.   FANS call out -- \nFANS David!   David!     Over here! \nSIMMS Gotta go. \nSimms cuts down behind the tent toward the clubhouse, away from the galleries. The marshals open a rope allowing him to avoid the crowds, but -- \nAn ELDERLY COUPLE with a young child are there.   The lady has a tiny dog in her arms. \nOLD MAN Excuse me, Mr. Simms! (off no response) Can you sign an autograph for our grandson? \nSIMMS (snaps) Can't you see I'm busy?! I'm working! This is my office! Do I come to your office and ask you for an autograph?! Jesus... \nHe practically stiff-arms them as he passes, heading up to the clubhouse. They stand there in shock. \nSIMMS (muttering to himself) Who the fuck these people think they are... \nCAMERA PANS OVER TO the edge of the tent. Molly, trying to get to David, has seen the whole thing. \nCLOSE ON MOLLY \nShe speaks to herself. \nMOLLY Old people, children, and dogs... \nCUT TO: \n97   INT. CLUBHOUSE BAR - SUNSET                                  97 \nSimms enters to numerous congratulations from officials, caddies, other PLAYERS. Instantly, in public, he feigns humility with convincing flair. \nPLAYER #1 Helluva round, Dave! \nSIMMS Got lucky out there... \nPLAYER #2 Great start, Simmsy... \nSimms stops when he sees Tin Cup and Romeo drowning their sorrows. \nSIMMS Hey, Tin Cup -- heard you put a monster number up there... \nTIN CUP Coulda been worse... \nA small bar crowd is enjoying Simms' taunts. \nSIMMS I played in the Pro-Am with some asshole movie star shot 82 here once... how did a great ball- striker like you, a `legend,' manage to shoot an 83? \nTIN CUP I missed a four foot putt on the eighteen for an 82, that's how... \nSIMMS It ain't like playing some muni track in Brownsville, is it? \nA voice interrupts. \nMOLLY Does, `integrity, tradition, and honor' include kicking a man when he's down? \nSIMMS Oh, Mol', this is just guy stuff, bar talk, part of the game -- no offense, right, Cup? \nNo answer.    Tin Cup's about as low as one can go. \nMOLLY (defensively) This man still has a lot of good golf shots in his system -- \nTIN CUP (trying to hide) Molly, it's okay, go away... I don't need any attention right \nnow... \nSOME GUY AT THE BAR (to Tin Cup) You the guy shot 83?! \nMOLLY David, I'll bet you a hundred dollars right now that Roy here can hit a ball -- (looks around) -- from right here to... through that door to the patio... \nShe points to a double door, forty feet away across, the bar, about an 8 x 8 foot opening. \nTIN CUP Molly, please... \nMOLLY (to bartender) And give me a vodka tonic with a twist -- \nSIMMS Molly, really, this isn't... dignified... \nMOLLY Roy? \nMOLLY No, no, no... you were great... \nTIN CUP Tempo is everything... \nMOLLY Perfection's unobtainable... \nTIN CUP Mighta rushed it on the downswing... \nMOLLY Come over the top a little... \nTIN CUP Yeah... well, as Walter Hagen once said -- 'Sex and golf are the only two things you can be bad at and still enjoy...' \nMOLLY Let's take a mulligan and tee it up again -- \nThey embrace with enthusiasm and start thrashing again. \n102   BACK OUTSIDE                                                 102 \nRomeo's patience is getting thin.

SIXTEENTH HOLE - DAY                                   105 \nWe hear Ben Wright's voice as Tin Cup marks his ball on the green. A small gallery has begun to follow him. \nWRIGHT (V.O.) If anyone was ever to make a run at what is the most storied number in Open history, Miller's sixty- three, it would be today when the rain has softened the greens, enabling the players to take dead aim at the flags. Still, the unswerving courage of an unknown driving range pro from Salome has raised that humble journeyman from the ashes of an ignominious eighty-three to wave a mighty fist at the pantheon of golf's immortals. This man, this Roy McAvoy has laid siege to the record book by birdieing the first seven holes. A brave par from the water at eight, and a glorious birdie three at the daunting twelfth, another at thirteen... \nTin Cup gets his read, and steps up to putt. \nWRIGHT (V.O.) ... this putt to go ten under for the day... \nTin Cup putts -- When the ball is still two feet from the hole, Tin Cup raises his putter in triumph... and sure enough, the ball drops in the hole. \nCUT TO: \n106    EXT.

DRIVING RANGE (SALOME) - EVENING                       107 \nDoreen is behind the till. The regulars and several customers crowd the counter, staring up at the TELEVISION as Dewey rushes in from his job. \nDEWEY They said on the radio he was ten under -- \nEVERYONE Shhhh!!! \nSilence, everyone watching the TV, everyone starting to contort in body-English, then: \nA joyous roar -- Tin Cup's putt went down.    Earl twirls with glee. \nEARL He's shooting the lowest round ever! \nCLINT And eighteen's a par five. A birdie there, he shoots sixty! \nDOREEN We gotta go, boys.

TELEVISION TOWER - DAY                                 108 \nThe MONITOR shows Tin Cup approaching his ball in the fairway. Ken Venturi is commentating. \nVENTURI McAvoy's hit another big drive, but this is not a shot he wants to get aggressive with... \n109   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               109 \nTin Cup and Romeo survey the shot -- a long downhill carry over a lake to a slightly elevated green. A shot similar to the one he pulled off at the best-ball. \nROMEO Two-sixty to carry, Roy. You got to lay up, man. I don't care how good you swinging. You got to lay \nup. \nTin Cup looks at the iron Romeo proffers. He looks back at the shot, throws some grass in the air, testing the wind. He looks at the gallery, the lake, the green, the whole grand setting... and then: \nTIN CUP This is for Venturi, up there in the booth, thinking I should lay up... (addressing his ball) Dollar bills... \nHe swings and holds the pose. He caught the ball perfectly -- it sails high and true into the luffing breeze, the GALLERY ROARS, and... \n... the ball drops, SPLOOSH! into the WATER, a couple feet short of dry land. The GALLERY GROANS.` \nBACK TO TIN CUP \nStaring amazed, almost betrayed, that his ball didn't carry the water. \nTIN CUP That's a long fucking ways. (holds out his hand) Gimme another ball. \nROMEO Roy... \nTIN CUP What? \nROMEO It's a water hazard. You go up there and take a drop. Try to save par like you did yesterday. \nTin Cup's eyes blink with thought as Romeo's words get through to him. \nTIN CUP You're right.    What the hell was I thinking? \nAnd he starts down to the water. A THUNDEROUS OVATION greets his approach, and he raises his hat to salute the fans saluting him. \nCUT TO: \n120   INT.

You were in the same spot on eighteen yesterday without a headwind and you -- \nTIN CUP You don't think I can knock it on from there? \nREPORTER #3 It seemed like a low-percentage shot. \nTIN CUP So am I! Look at me. I'm playing for... (points at his sew-on patches) ... Rio Grande Short-Haul Trucking, Brink and Brown Sanitation, First State Bank of Salome, Wally's Smokehouse...

Plus these are my people. I'm a waffle house guy -- gotta stay in touch with that... \nROMEO Plus he needs his carbohydrates -- \nTIN CUP If the boys from Salome was in town -- this is where they'd be... \nThe boys from Salome walk in -- with Doreen, all looking like hell from the long bus trip. They're ecstatic to see Tin Cup and Romeo. \nCLINT The legend! \nEARL God damn, we been driving for two days to help you in the last round -- \nJOSE Saw the Winnebago outside -- we're starving... \nDEWEY Sixty-two!    Sixty-two! \nTIN CUP We're home now! \nROMEO You boys a sight for sore eyes. We so damn sick of guys in blazers and slacks that don't wrinkle. It ain't natural 'round here... \nDOREEN Congratulations, Roy -- we're with you all the way. \nTIN CUP Doreen, meet Dr. Griswold... er, Molly... my shrink -- \nMOLLY Ex-shrink. (matter-of-factly) We're sleeping together now so I can't be his therapist. \nDOREEN I knew it. \nMOLLY Knew what? \nDOREEN Nothing, dear. Good luck. (looking around) Say, I have a little extra cash -- why don't we go somewhere fancy and celebrate -- y'know, kinda get \nready for the final round? \nBut the Regulars overwhelm her. \nDEWEY This is the Waffle House, Doreen -- \nCURT Hell, I been dreaming of waffles for 1800 miles... \nEARL They got a waffle house in Odessa just about like this... \nJOSE Odessa?   It's in Midland, ain't it?... \nCLINT No, it's in Odessa. \nThey all pull up chairs and settle in for a long evening at the Waffle House. \nA ball rolls past them and into a hole.   Tin Cup looks over and sees Simms. \nSIMMS Sorry, Roy, can't believe I didn't see you with all that high-priced endorsement crap you're flaunting. \nTIN CUP That's always been your problem, Dave. You don't think about winning; you just want to look good. (turns away to putt) Thing is, this ain't a beauty pageant. (turns back, getting in Simms' face) And it ain't a rain-shortened Quad Cities or a Greater Greensboro you can back into. This is you'n me, pal. This is match-play, and this time you ain't getting no three shots. \nCUT TO: \n125   EXT. FIRST TEE - HIGH ANGLE - DAY                          125 \nA large gallery surrounds the tree and lines the fairway as: \nSTARTER With the honor in the final pairing, from Salome, Texas, Mr. Roy McAvoy. \nBoisterous applause.   Tin Cup tips his cap and nods at \nDavid Simms, his pairing in this the final twosome of the final round of the U.S. Open. \nTIN CUP Fairways and greens, Dave... and don't forget to wave as I blow by. \nSIMMS You mean blow up? Like you always do? \nAnd Tin Cup moves to the tee. \nHis hand shakes worse than it did the first day as he tees his ball. Stepping back to line up his shot, he peers down the fairway through a narrow corridor of faces. A daunting sight. He edges over to Romeo and tautly whispers: \nTIN CUP Do me a favor. Bet me a buck I don't put it in the fairway. \nROMEO I bet you a hundred. \nTIN CUP Okay, good. (going to tee off) Puts things back in perspective. \nCUT TO: \n126   EXT. FIRST HOLE - MINUTE LATER                               126 \nTin Cup looks at his ball, almost invisible in the deep rough. He tries to locate the green beyond the trees that surround him. In golf parlance, he's in jail. He selects a club. \nROMEO Which way you going? \nTin Cup points over the trees.   Romeo grimaces.   Tin Cup addresses the shot. Then: \nTin Cup swings -- the ball flutters weakly out of the rough and disappears into the branches of a bushy tree, dropping eventually next to its trunk, and: \nCUT TO: \n127   LEADER BOARD                                                 127 \nA scorer changes the number beside Tin Cup's name from -7 \nto -5.   Simms is still -7. \nCUT TO: \n128   EXT. THIRD TEE - DAY                                        128 \nTin Cup arrives on the tee where Simms now has the honor. \nSIMMS Nice double, Roy. \nTIN CUP Just keep making pars, asshole. \nSIMMS I'll take eighteen of 'em. \nTIN CUP And I will own you. \nCUT TO: \n129   EXT. THIRD GREEN - DAY                                      129 \nMolly and Doreen stand together behind the big gallery. Molly is using a cardboard periscope to look over the gallery to the green. Doreen is on her tip-toes but all she can see are the backs of heads. \nA swell of cheers builds, then turns to groans. \nMOLLY Oh no, Tin Cup ran it five feet past. (beat) How did he get the name 'Tin Cup'? \nDOREEN (O.S.) He played catcher on the high school baseball team. The star pitcher had this big-league curve, and not all his pitches hit Roy in the mitt. Finally, you gotta respect a man's doggedness. You know? (beat) The team decided Tin Cup sounded better than Clank. \nMolly puts down the periscope at that remark, and hands it to Doreen. \nMOLLY 'Clank''s not a good name for a man... \nDoreen looks through the periscope. \nPERISCOPE'S POV - TIN CUP \nlining up a putt.   She pans over to Romeo helping him. \nDOREEN (V.O.) Tell me something, Molly... have you ever had a Latin lover? \nCUT TO: \n130   EXT. LEADER BOARD                                          130 \nThe regulars study the board -- the scruffiest lot ever seen at an Open. Next to them stand a group of U.S.G.A. officials, all in neat, matching blazers. The contrast is thrilling. \nCLINT Our boy's in trouble... ya think he's chokin'? \nEARL Our boy don't choke. He fucks up but he don't choke... \nTin Cup follows the flight of his approach, and up ahead on: \n143   EXT. FOURTEENTH TEE - DAY                                    143 \nPeter Jacobsen hears the GALLERY ROAR.   He turns to his caddie, incredulous. \nJACOBSEN He's throwing darts back there. We gotta make birdies, Squeaky, or we are playing for second. \nAnd he snatches his driver from the bag, determined to make birdies. \nCUT TO: \n144   EXT. LEADER BOARD                                            144 \nThe scorer posts -7 next to Tin Cup's name.    Simms is still at -7, as is Jacobsen. And... \n145   EXT. FOURTEENTH GREEN - DAY                                  145 \nJacobsen rolls a long putt into the hole, and as the GALLERY CHEERS, he points a finger of challenge back at -- \nTin Cup waiting in the fairway.   Tin Cup seems to enjoy the taunt. \nTIN CUP That's right, Peter. You'n me. That's all there is. \nAnd he selects a club, and... \nCUT TO: \n146   INT. DRIVING RANGE (SALOME) - DAY                            146 \nTin Cup's fans, deeply into the beer by now, contort with body-english and holler at the TV screen. \nFANS Get in there!    Come on!   Go down! \nThey explode with cheers.   Some twirl with glee.   Others exchange high fives. \nEARL He's tied for the lead again!    And they're running outta holes! \nCUT TO: \n147   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY                                  147 \nThe leader board is superimposed on the monitor.    McAvoy -8, Jacobsen -8, Simms -7. \nNANTZ So it's come down to the seventy- second hole of this great championship, and the skill and courage of three Texans who have dueled throughout the day for the chance to be crowned Open Champion... Peter Jacobsen is on the fairway at 8 under, McAvoy at the 18th tee is tied at minus 8, and David Simms trails by one... \n148   EXT. EIGHTEENTH TEE                                          148 \nTin Cup and Romeo watch Jacobsen hit his shot. \nTIN CUP Jacobsen's laying up. (turning to Simms) You ain't gonna have that luxury, Dave. Not if you play to win. \nHe moves to the tee, and... \nCUT TO: \n149   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER                                       149 \nThe monitor shows Tin Cup's drive bounding down the middle of the fairway. \nNANTZ McAvoy's hit a perfect drive, Ken. \nVENTURI I'm not sure that's good news for McAvoy. With his inexperience, the last thing he needs is an excuse to fool with that water again today. \n150   BACK TO TEE                                                 150 \nTin Cup whispers to Romeo as Simms tees up. \nTIN CUP I didn't catch it all. \nROMEO Then you got to lay up. \nSimms rips a drive down the middle, the ball landing a little short of Roy's. \n151   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               151 \nTin Cup in the fairway, studying his shot. \nTIN CUP So birdie wins it. \nHe looks at Simms, ten yards across the fairway from him. \nTIN CUP You or me, Dave? \nSimms points to himself. He has a wood in his hands, but he puts the club back and reaches for an iron. Tin Cup edges closer to Romeo. \nTIN CUP (whispering) He's laying up. Birdie to tie, eagle to win, and that gutless wonder's laying up. \nROMEO (whispering) Par to tie, birdie to win... you lay up too, Roy. You can make birdie laying up. \nThey watch Simms lay up. Then Romeo offers Tin Cup an iron, hoping he'll take it. \nTIN CUP You know something, Romeo? Eagle puts me ten under. No one's ever finished an Open ten under, not even Nicklaus. \nROMEO You don't need an eagle. Birdie wins, par ties. (firmly) Hit the lay up. Hole a wedge for goddamn eagle. \nTin Cup throws some grass in the air, looks back at the green, the gallery, the whole grand setting... and he seeks out Molly's face in the crowd. He moves over so she can hear him. \nTIN CUP This is everything, ain't it? This is the choice it comes down to. This is our immortality... \nVENTURI (V.O.) Oh, my.   This is tragic. \n159   BACK TO TIN CUP                                             159 \nHolding his hand out to Romeo, as the gallery murmurs uncomfortably. \nTIN CUP Gimme another ball. \nBACK TO DOREEN AND MOLLY \nwatching behind the ropes. \nMOLLY I can't believe he's doing this. \nDOREEN (unfazed) I can, honey... \nMOLLY He can blow the whole tournament! \nDOREEN It's a miracle he lasted this long... \nCUT TO: \n160   REGULARS                                                  160 \nwaiting at the green, amidst the rest of the gallery who's in shock about Tin Cup's decisions to keep going for it, keep trying to prove a point. \nCLINT He done blew a gasket, boys... \nEARL The wheels is definitely falling off now... \nJOSE It was a miracle while it lasted... \nREGULARS' POV \nTin Cup swings a third time. \nCUT TO: \n161   EXT. EIGHTEENTH GREEN - DAY                               161 \nA BALL lands SPLOOSH! in the WATER, and... \n162   BACK UP FAIRWAY                                           162 \nTin Cup holds out his hand for yet another ball, saying nothing. \nRomeo hands him another ball. \nTin Cup unloads another 3-wood.    Another splash. \nTin Cup holds out his hand again. \nROMEO This is your last ball, man. If this gets wet, you disqualified. \nTIN CUP I can make it across. \nTin Cup snatches the ball from Romeo's hand. \n163   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER                                     163 \nVenturi and Nantz can barely look at the monitor. \nVENTURI This is the most painful thing I've ever watched. \nMcCORD (V.O.) Jim, this is the last ball he has in his bag. If he doesn't finish the hole with it, he can't turn in a card. He'll be disqualified. \nVenturi and Nantz cover their eyes. \nTin Cup unloads another three wood -- another splash. \n164   BACK TO TIN CUP                                             164 \nHe looks at Molly. \nCLOSE ON MOLLY \nShe's just laughing. \nRomeo tosses down another ball -- Tin Cup launches his fifth attempt to clear the pond. Splash. \nMOLLY You're right, Roy, what the hell! Let 'er rip! \nDOREEN You two are made for each other. \nBACK TO TIN CUP \nThis is still all business to him.    He sets his jaw, addresses the shot, and: \nTIN CUP Dollar bills... \nHe swings -- another perfect shot... but this time the wind relents a knot, and: \n165   BALL                                                        165 \nclears the water, clears the slope, hits the front of the green, rolls up toward the pin, and drops in the hole. The gallery goes berserk! \n166   BACK TO TIN CUP                                             166 \nRaising his three wood aloft in triumph, he looks over at Molly and finally cracks a smile. \n", "test1_input": "TIN CUP Written by JOHN NORVILLE and RON SHELTON \nDecember 1995 Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nTINNY CHEATIN' HEART MUSIC, the dull GROAN of a TRACTOR, CRICKETS CHIRPIN' love songs, sporadic ZAPS from BUG LIGHTS, and an occasional random THWOCK as we -- \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT.

(We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation.) \nFour of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of yellow into the gathering darkness. ROY \"TIN CUP\" McAVOY stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest light, hitting golf balls. THWOCK...! Launching them, really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between his legs. Behind him: \nA group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin Cup. These men are the range regulars: CURT, CLINT, EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and his preferred libation in the other. They're all looking back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to: \nROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-time bookie and full-time driving range man. Born across the river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante, best friend. \nROMEO Okay, all bets are down! \nTheir eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful, until... ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED. And Dewey cheers triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet. \nROMEO Number one is the winner! Dewey has the winner. Pays five to two! \nRomeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money from the losers. It's fast-paced, inane, time-killing gambling. Tin Cup looks over. \nTIN CUP Don't you shitheels ever get bored? \nThe regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the negative as they turn back to Romeo and the action at the bug lights. \nTIN CUP ... 'Cuz I got a riddle. \nTin Cup leads the regulars inside. \nCUT TO: \nA3   INT. DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY                                A3 \nTin Cup holds court. \nTIN CUP Takes about two ounces of brains to figure it out. Anyone think they got a brain with two ounces of brains in it? \nThe regulars silently look at each other, reluctant to reveal the heft of their brains. \nTIN CUP For Chrissakes, boys! A little self-confidence from the players' gallery. We ain't talking long division. \nEARL (timidly) How much we gotta lose? \nTIN CUP You want to liven things up, Earl? That's a hell of an idea. Say everyone puts in twenty bucks and the pot goes to whoever solves the riddle. \nDEWEY You going to get the riddle, Tin Cup? \nTIN CUP (patiently) Dewey. I'm the one asking the riddle. I already know the answer. I don't getta guess. Although... We could say if I get to five hundred bounces and no one gets the riddle, I get the pot. And I know what you're thinking. It's an impossible riddle. Well, It's not. It's an easy riddle. And if somehow by the grace of fluke luck I win, and you all don't agree it was an easy riddle, hell, I'll refund your money. \nEARL, CLINT & ALL I'm in... We're in... Count us in... etc... \nTIN CUP Okay, a man's driving down the road with his son and they get in a crash. Two ambulances come and take the man and his son to different hospitals. Son goes into the operating room, the doctor looks at him and says, 'I can't operate on this boy. He's my son.' How's that possible? (beat) The clock's ticking boys... \nTin Cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge. \nEARL Father didn't sneak back in, right? He's still at the other hospital? \nTIN CUP It ain't 'Star Trek,' Earl.   No one beamed him aboard. \nThat eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds. The men think harder. \nEARL Well... if the father married the son's daughter -- \nTIN CUP It's a family riddle, Earl.   Think clean thoughts. \nThe regulars puzzle some more. \nCLINT Give us a little hint. \nMOLLY (O.S.) The doctor's a woman. \nAll heads turn to take in the arrival of: \n3   MOLLY GRISWOLD                                             3 \nStanding just inside the door -- she's a fresh-faced beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest. And all the men are asking themselves the same question: what's she doing here? The silence invites Molly to supply the riddle's answer. \nMOLLY The doctor is the son's mother. Feminists pose the riddle to reveal how deeply our sexual stereotypes run. (directly to Tin Cup) I take it you're a feminist? \nTin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the spell. The regulars wait for Tin Cup's response. \nTIN CUP Ma'am, I've been called a lot of things -- but no one's ever saddled me with that one. \nMOLLY You might try being saddled sometime -- the smell of leather, the sting of a whip... \n", "test1_true": "TIN CUP (slightly taken aback) I'm just a humble golf pro... \nMOLLY You're Roy McAvoy the golf pro? I pictured something... different. I have a seven o'clock lesson. \nTIN CUP I thought I had a Doctor Griswold \nat seven. \nThey hurry out to the range, Tin Cup oblivious to his gaffe. \nAnd the regulars gather to look out the window -- \n4   THEIR POV - THROUGH WINDOW                                 4 \nTo the range, where Molly is stretching and Tin Cup is discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost. \nCUT TO: \n5   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT                                 5 \nThe lesson begins. Tin Cup can be slightly condescending in these situations, though she's got him a little wary. \nTIN CUP The first thing you gotta learn about this game, Doc, is it ain't about hitting a little white ball into some yonder hole. It's about inner demons and self-doubt and human frailty and overcoming all that crap. So... what kinda doctor'd you say you were? \nMOLLY I'm a psychologist -- in layman's terms call me a neo-Jungian, post- modern Freudian, holistic secularist. \nTIN CUP Damn. \nShe begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc. \nMOLLY Inner demons and human frailty are my life's work. I used to practice in El Paso but I've moved here now... \nTIN CUP What're those? \nMOLLY I ordered these from the Golf Channel. \nHe stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some of this stuff. He's enchanted and dismayed. \nTIN CUP That stuff's a waste of money. \nMOLLY I'm sure there are excesses and repetitions here, but I believe in the gathering of knowledge and I figured, well, there must be some truths about the golf swing illustrated by these devices -- and that you'd help me sort through it. \nShe stands there with contraptions coming from every limb. \nMOLLY I have dozens of golf videotapes, too... And a golf watch. \nTIN CUP (irritated, impatient) Take it off. All of it. Now! You're a smart woman, for Chrissakes -- don't you know the work of charlatans when you see it? \nShe deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile. \nMOLLY No. I can always tell when someone is lying to himself, but I'm quite susceptible and frequently wrong when that person lies to me. (pointing to the pile of devices) That stuff cost me over 200 dollars -- \nTIN CUP Then it's 200 dollars of shit... \nHe tees a ball, hands Molly her driver and steps back. \nTIN CUP Go ahead.   Take a swing. \nMolly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs, and mutters under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman. \nMOLLY Aw, fuck... \nTIN CUP Well, you talk like a golfer -- \nMolly unloads a mighty second swing. The club head bounces off the mat. The ball sits untouched. \nMOLLY Shit. \nTIN CUP 'Fuck...' 'Shit...' these are highly technical golf terms and you're using them on your first lesson -- this is promising. \nMOLLY Awright, wise ass, show me. \nTin Cup takes the club from Molly, motions for her to step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the night. \nTIN CUP Something like that. \nHe hands her back the club and tees up another ball. Molly just looks at him. \nMOLLY Impressive. Y'know, I tend to process things verbally. Can you break down into words how you did that? \nTin Cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech. \nTIN CUP 'What is the golf swing?' -- by Roy McAvoy. (beat) The golf swing is a poem. \nTIN CUP (CONT'D) Sometimes a love sonnet and sometimes a Homerian epic -- it is organic and of a piece, yet it breaks down into elegant stanzas and quatrains. The critical opening phrase of this song is the grip, in which the hands unite to form a single unit by the simple overlap of the smallest finger... (displays grip) ... held lightly, a conductor's \nbaton. (starts swing) Lowly and slowly the clubhead is pulled back, led into position not by the hands but the body which turns away from the target, shifting to the right side without shifting balance. Tempo is everything, perfection unobtainable, as the body coils, now to the top of the swing, in profound equilibrium. And then a slight hesitation, a nod to the gods... \nMOLLY A nod to the gods? \nTIN CUP To the gods, yes... that he is fallible. As the weight shifts back to the left pulled now by powers inside the earth -- it's alive, this swing, a living sculpture -- and down through contact, always down, into terra firma, striking the ball crisply -- with character -- a tuning fork goes off in your heart, your balls -- such a pure feeling is the well-struck golf shot -- And then the follow through to finish, always on line -- The reverse 'C' of the Golden Bear, the steelworker's power and brawn of Carl Sandburg's Arnold Palmer, the da Vinci of Hogan, the unfinished symphony of Roy McAvoy. \nMOLLY What?    What's unfinished? \nTIN CUP I have a short follow through -- my swing can look unfinished. \nMOLLY Why? \n", "test2_input": "ROMEO You're looking particularly lovely this evening -- This is nicer than the leopard suit -- \nDOREEN Cut the horseshit, guys. So... the one and two dogs always run wide and the three dog always breaks slow, so I figure there's gonna be a big ol' pile of fur at the turn and the three dog's gonna tiptoe around it and walk on home... I was right. (smiles) You owe me twelve thousand dollars. \nROMEO We going to pay you. \nTin Cup squirms as Doreen babbles a bit. \nDOREEN I know you're going to pay me. \nDOREEN (CONT'D) (admiring her own outfit) Y'know I finally got rid of the leopard suit thing -- it was so retro, y'know... it's not easy being a post-modern stripper... (beat) So... twelve big ones? \nTin Cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces some official-looking papers. He hands them to her. \nTIN CUP There. With equity and inventory it's worth twelve grand... more or less. \nDoreen leans forward to examine the papers.    She looks at Tin Cup with surprise. \nDOREEN This is how you think you can settle up? By deeding me your driving range? \nTIN CUP Only on condition you don't sell right away, and me'n Romeo keep our jobs. \nDOREEN What in the world would I want with your stupid driving range? \nTIN CUP Equity, inventory, cash flow... not to mention an enhanced stature in the community, and prepaid membership in the Salome Chamber of Commerce. \nFor a moment, Doreen can only stare dumbly at Tin Cup, caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune. Then she starts to consider the idea more seriously. \nDOREEN What are your labor costs? (off no response from Tin Cup) Payroll, Roy. What do you pay \nyour help? \nTIN CUP Let's see... the tractor kid gets five bucks an hour. Romeo, he gets ten cash -- \nDOREEN What do you pay yourself? \nTIN CUP Myself? \nDoreen nods in a way Tin Cup finds threatening. \nDOREEN To hit golf balls all day... when you're not breaking for beers or corn dogs or to gather the guys and lay bets on which crow flies off the fence next. \nTIN CUP You're referring to my managerial salary? \nDOREEN I'm referring to every nickel you snatch out of the till and every bag of beer nuts you lift from the rack, is what I'm referring to. (beat) I'll say it's worth ten and you still owe me two. \nShe smiles, he sighs. \nCUT TO: \n11   EXT.

And I can't see my new salary of seven bucks an hour plus lessons getting it done. \nROMEO But your clubs are your livelihood. \nTIN CUP Well the hood ain't too lively at the moment. \nA CAR HORN SOUNDS from outside. \nTIN CUP Whoever it is, tell 'em I'm in Houston on business. \nRomeo opens the door, and steps outside. \nROMEO David Simms!   What you doing in town? \nRomeo steps outside to greet Simms.   Warily. \nCUT TO: \n13    EXT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                      13 \nRomeo and Simms under the awning.   A spiffy new car parked nearby. \nDAVID SIMMS, 38, looking every bit like the successful tour pro he is... Payne Stewart to Tin Cup's Maynard G. Krebs. \nSIMMS Romeo! It's been awhile.    Is Tin Cup around? \nRomeo is evasive. \nROMEO He's on business in Houston... You supposed to be out playin' on the golf tour. \nSIMMS (unfazed) Well, you tell him I'm in town for my big charity best-ball tournament, and I got a spot for him when he comes back from... whatever. \n", "test2_true": "SIMMS Romeo! You wound me. I'm fond of the guy, going way back to our days at University of Houston, when we won all those titles together. \nROMEO He says he carried you on his back. \nSimms won't be drawn into this adolescent competition -- he's too comfortable with himself and his success. \nSIMMS I didn't have much craft back then -- just a little native ability. Roy's a great ball- striker.... \nROMEO Why you here? \nSIMMS I want to win my own tournament, and he can help me if we can manage to behave like grownups together. Tell him that. \nTin Cup suddenly appears in the doorway. \nTIN CUP What's the catch? \nSIMMS There is no catch. I put together a tournament with an elite field and a half-million dollar purse, and I'm tired of seeing all the money head out of town. \nTIN CUP Then make more birdies. \nSIMMS I need you on my team. \nTIN CUP You ain't that friendly a guy... \nSIMMS We're playing Cottonwood where you once shot fifty-nine, where you can shoot sixty-five in your sleep 'cuz you know every bump on every fairway, every subtle break on every green -- \nTIN CUP (warily) You an' me -- \nSIMMS Me an' you -- like the old days. \nTin Cup can't quite believe this offer from his old nemesis but there aren't many options out there. He grabs Simms's hand and starts pumping it, gushing with enthusiasm. \nTIN CUP ... Well, put 'er there, partner! These two homeboys are gonna show the world what golf in West Texas is all about! \nSIMMS No, Roy. I didn't mean I want you to play with me. I just want you to caddie for me, read my putts, club me, that kinda stuff. \nTin Cup wilts like a time-lapsing daisy.   His hand falls free of Simms's. Words fail him. \nROMEO You son of a bitch. \nTIN CUP (to himself, blankly) Caddie? Me? \nSIMMS I can't bring a guy in off the street to play in my tournament. It's a big-time event, corporate sponsors, thirty dollar tickets... I got a network to cover -- \nROMEO (interrupting, \noutraged) This guy off the street, he could kick your ass on that golf course. Like he kicked your ass in junior golf. Like he kicked your ass in college. Like -- \nSIMMS I'll pay you a hundred for the loop, five percent of any earnings -- \nROMEO Get the hell outta here! Take your goddamn color coordinated corporate sponsored soul and get outta here. \nSIMMS Okay, okay, just thought I'd offer you some work... \nSimms heads to his car. \nTIN CUP Simms! \nSIMMS (stops) What? \nTIN CUP I'll take the job. \nROMEO We'll take the job. \nSimms nods in agreement, and exits.    Tin Cup stands there with Romeo, feeling humiliated. \nPOV SHOT - SIMMS \ndrives away down the road. \nTIN CUP (O.S.) That man stands for everything I hate in life. \nROMEO (O.S.) You mean like... success? \nCUT TO: \n14   EXT. COTTONWOOD GOLF COURSE CHARITY EVENT - DAY               14 \nBanners and galleries and concession tents create the atmosphere of a polite circus. \nA15   EXT. COTTONWOOD GOLF COURSE CHARITY EVENT - 16TH GREEN     A15 - DAY \nBILLY MAYFAIR putts out on the 16th green to polite applause. \nB15   EXT. COTTONWOOD GOLF COURSE - 16TH TEE - DAY               B15 \nThe two twosomes tee off and the caddies follow, including Tin Cup. \n15    EXT. COTTONWOOD - 16TH FAIRWAY - DAY                       15 \nA leader board reads:   SIMMS/STADLER -10, MICKELSON/ MCCORD -8. \nA giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant green which is fronted by a lake, as: \nSTADLER hits a three wood toward the green -- the BALL PLUNKS in the middle of the lake. The GALLERY GROANS. \nStadler just shrugs to Simms, as if to say, \"I thought I had enough club.\" \n", "test3_input": "He puts the Walkman headset over his ears on the first tee. We hear what he hears, and -- \nMOLLY (V.O.) (on tape) ... `Private victories precede public victories. You cannot harvest a crop before you plant it...' \nKaboom!   He launches a tee shot down the middle. \nMOLLY (V.O) (on tape) ... `How you view the problem, is the problem...' \n66   TIN CUP chips into the cup.                                66 \n67   TIN CUP drains putt after putt with confidence.            67 \nMOLLY (V.O.) (on tape) ... `Follow your bliss...' \n68   TIN CUP takes a club from Earl who's huffing and           68 puffing a little too hard for a caddie, and -- \nTin Cup crisps a three iron over water to a tight green. \nTin Cup is carrying his own bag now -- Earl is several paces behind, dragging his body slowly, exhausted. \n69   CLOSE ON SCOREBOARD -- Even par, even, even, one           69 under... \nMOLLY (V.O.) (on tape) ... `Say not that I have found the truth but that I have found a truth...' \n70   CLOSE ON TIN CUP -- Still in a zone, confident,            70 relaxed, hitting lots of good shots. But the score is close, the competition tougher. He's near the top, but not first. \n71   TIN CUP lips out a fifteen-foot putt -- heartbreak.        71 He starts to lose it, but... \nMOLLY (V.O.) (on tape) ...`You can't have the fruits without the roots...' \nAnd Tin Cup just smiles and taps in. \n72   SCOREBOARD tells us we're down to the 36th, final hole.    72 \n73                           TIN CUP                            73 Whattya think, Earl? \nEARL I think three under will qualify. You need birdie. I could shit. \nTIN CUP A little more confidence there, Earl... \nEARL I wish Romeo was here. I ain't cut out to do this. I'm a spectator by nature. An observer. I'm a -- \nTIN CUP Shut up and hand me the Big Dog. \nEARL You got it. \nTin Cup takes the driver and uncoils a beauty. \nTIN CUP The Force is with me, pods... \nCUT TO: \n74   TIN CUP hits a wedge approach -- the ball lands inches     74 from the hole. The crowd gasps... but -- \nThe backspin grabs it and the ball spins back and back and back, ten, twenty, thirty feet before coming to a rest. \nThe men head solemnly to the final green. \nCUT TO: \n75   EXT. LA PALOMA - 18TH GREEN - DAY                           75 \nTin Cup surveys the thirty-foot snake of a putt.   Earl's of absolutely no use. \nTIN CUP We need this one big time, Earl, whattya think? \nEARL (unsurely) Looks straight to me. \nTIN CUP Straight?! Thing's a roller coaster breaks four ways and dies at the hole -- you're blind! \nEARL Actually, I am blind... 20-60 in one eye -- and that's the good eye... \nTIN CUP I got a blind caddie... just hold the stick, Earl -- and be sure to pull it out... \nTin Cup studies the hell out of this putt. If it goes in, he's in the Open. He misses, back to Salome. \nMOLLY (V.O.) (on tape) ... when the going gets tough, the, the, the, whirrrrrrrrrrr, the, the... \nTin Cup shakes the Walkman and pounds his ears. \nTIN CUP Doc?  Doc? (panicky) Earl, Earl -- the tape's jammed! She's abandoning me! \nMARSHAL Are you okay? \nTIN CUP Yeah, yeah... I'm flying solo now... \nMARSHAL What? \nTIN CUP I gotta make this putt. \nMARSHAL Obviously. \nTin Cup stares endlessly at the long putt. \nTIN CUP ... just pick the line, feel the speed -- bad timing, doc, Jesus... \nHe steps up to the putt, still talking to himself. \nTIN CUP Like a million others you made in your life, Roy. Just see it going in. Just feel it... right in the back of the jar... just pull the goddamn trigger, you pussy... \n", "test3_true": "TIN CUP Pull the stick, Earl, pull it! \nEarl's having trouble with the flagstick, shaking it, panicking, and finally -- he snaps it free, but... \nThe ball stops dead on the lip of the cup. \nTin Cup contorts in anguished body-English, then falls to his back like a shot animal. \nTIN CUP Choking dogs die! \nAnd the BALL falls into the cup with a CLICK -- and a ROAR. \nTin Cup takes a peek at the cup.   The ball stays in the hole. \nCUT TO: \n77   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                        77 \nThe Winnebago returns home, a travelling party of beer, boisterousness, and celebration. We hear them all, led by Turk the bouncer and his guitar, singing \"The Double bogey Blues\"... all the way back to Texas. \nCUT TO: \n78   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY                                78 \nTin Cup arrives, fresh from the qualifier.   Romeo is shafting glubs. \nTIN CUP Romes!  You've come back! (no answer) You shoulda been there, Romes, I drained a 30-foot snake to qualify! (off no answer) Earl gave me a straight read -- the thing broke half a dozen times -- missed ya, pods! \nRomeo gives him the silent treatment. \nTIN CUP Okay, don't talk to me -- but you're still my guy... (losing patience) It's a little late to be pissed off! We're in the Open! You and me! \nStill nothing from Romeo. \nTIN CUP Awright, be that way -- (switches course) -- say... has Molly been around? \nROMEO I knew you had the hots for her. \nTIN CUP What's this? Garbo speaks? Of course I have the hots for her and I'm doing a damn good job of keeping things platonic and professional till I kick Simms' ass and show her I ain't who she thinks I am because, in fact, I am who she thinks I am but if I win the Open I won't be. \nRomeo stares back at that curious logic. \nROMEO Well, I don't think her nor me nor the God of Golf his self can keep you from blowing up in the Open... \nTIN CUP I made it this far! I just got to hold it together for 72 more \nholes! \nROMEO There's a lotta triple bogeys out there waiting to grab your ass. \nTIN CUP (cheerily) You're complaining again! Romeo's back! Whining, bitching, pissed off -- you're my man! \nSilence.   Some chagrin. \nROMEO You didn't fall in love with Earl to be your caddie? \nTIN CUP He was a wheezing heart attack waiting to happen -- cost me three strokes a side... (beat) I carried my bag the last four holes. I love ol' Earl but I need you. \nROMEO You don't love me? \nTIN CUP (exasperated) I love you, too, God damn it! \nROMEO As much as Earl? \nTIN CUP I don't know! Yes, yes, as much as Earl -- (beat) More than Earl! \nROMEO Am I special? \nTIN CUP If you can remove the sexual connotations and overlay a golf theme, Romeo -- I am your Juliet. \nRomeo ponders it all. \nROMEO Muy bien, Julietta. In that case -- I am your caddy once again. \nTIN CUP Podnuh. \nThey shake hands. \nTIN CUP Awright... now that we got that bullshit outta the way, I'm gonna hit me some balls and start oilin' that sweet swing o' mine for the big boys... \nRomeo sits back in the shade, still washing the thousands of golf balls in the rack, watching as -- \n79   Tin Cup drops a bucket of balls on the hardscrabble           79 ground, pulls out a club and limbers up. \nTIN CUP Nobody heard from Molly, eh? \nROMEO You got it bad, don't ya? \nTIN CUP Somethin' about that chick... \nTin Cup addresses the ball and takes a swing.    Everything looks normal in his swing, but... \nThwock! -- the BALL squirls off to the side and RATTLES against a fence. Ugly. \nTIN CUP Hmmm... little chili dipper there... \nROMEO Be sure to do that in the Open. \n"}

The Stocky Trucker gives him a disgusted look and stands up. 
STOCKY TRUCKER Don't put yourself out. 
The Man in the road ahead signals for Racine to pull around into the opposite lanes and move on. 
TRACKING along beside the Cadillac, Racine moves slowly through the nightmare scene. Figures move by carrying lights and tools. The Injured CRY OUT in pain. Three cars are meshed in crumpled steel. A clutch of Onlookers are outlined against the beams of headlights... Racine might as well be driving into Hell.

EXT. BRIDGE OVER CANAL - NIGHT 
Here is relief. The  Cadillac moves all alone across the bridge. The lights  penetrate the FOG at orderly intervals, barely illuminating the bridge. A huge FOG HORN fills the air from not far way. 
EXT. "THE BREAKERS" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 
The deserted hotel looms ghostly in the FOG. The Cadillac, lights out, rolls silently to a stop in the half-hidden delivery driveway. 
INT. "THE BREAKERS" - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT 
Racine, carrying only a flashlight, has made his way to the supply area he visited before. His beam probes dark corners, responds to random CREAKING. Satisfied that he is alone, he moves a wooden crate and reaches into the hole in the wall which it hid. He brings out Teddy's incendiary device and places it on the floor in the middle of the room. 
EXT. "THE BREAKERS" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 
Racine grunts under the weight of Edmund's corpse, flung over his back. He stumbles back toward the hulking hotel. The trunk of the Cadillac is closed. 
INT. "THE BREAKERS" - CORRIDOR - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT 
Racine sits down hard. He is streaming with sweat under the enormous dead weight. He adjusts the plastic sheet so that Edmund's bloody skull won't contact the wall. Racine gathers his strength and half-lifts, half-drags the body down the corridor, his silhouette that of a twisted, double-headed monster. His flashlight glows from ahead at his destination. 
IN THE SUPPLY AREA, Racine has dropped Edmund's body over some tipped shelves. Now he lifts the  heavy ceiling beam he spotted earlier. He has to change  its angle only two feet in order to let it drop -- now -- on Edmund's head. 
Racine walks over to the incendiary device. He pulls out the lever and straightens up. As he does he looks down a connecting hallway. He sees movement. He snatches up the flashlight and the wooden plank and rushes down that hallway. 
AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY, Racine slides to a halt, breathing hard. Again he sees the movement. A horrible, sweaty figure confronts him -- there is a broken mirror attached to the wall. Racine looks at himself a long moment and the tension seems to drain away... 
Someone speaks in the shadows!

Racine jumps and spins toward the sound,   which is only a little more than a MOAN. His flashlight    seeks out the source - a RAGGED BUM is stirring in his   sleep on a bed of newspapers. He wears an old baseball    cap. 
Racine looks at him a long time, trying to decide what to do. He looks back  in the direction of the supply area. He looks at the Bum settling again into a deep sleep. He looks for one final second at himself in the mirror. 
EXT. "THE BREAKERS" - BEACH - NIGHT 
Racine appears at a run from the fog. He has the Bum with him, grasped firmly at the neck of the collar and the seat of his pants. Racine is forcing the Bum to run along with him. The Bum is mightily confused, not least by the fact that Racine has jammed the baseball cap all the way down over his nose -- he can see nothing. Racine lets go, hurtling him across the sand. 
RACINE (a low growl) Get the hell out of here and don't come back. 
The Bum is sprawled in the sand. The baseball cap has come off. He watches Racine's dark figure recede in the fog. 
RAGGED BUM (a whisper) Come on back here and fight like a man! 
INT. RENTED FORD - SIDE STREET - NIGHT 
Matty sits fidgeting in the front seat, trying to peer through the soupy FOG. She sucks on an unlit cigarette. 
Racine appears at the driver's window. Matty gasps.     He is a horrible sight. He gets in the driver's seat. 
MATTY Thank god.   I thought -- 
Racine grabs her and pulls her down out of sight, bending his body low over her. 
RACINE Shh! 
The windows are suddenly illuminated by the beams of headlights. They grow brighter and a police patrol car, red light slowly revolving on the top, passes next to the Ford and moves off quietly in the FOG.

RACINE (whisper) They're right on time and I'm running late. 
He rises slowly and watches the patrol car disappear. 
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT 
The Ford stops at front of the drive. 
INT. RENTED FORD - NIGHT 
Racine and Matty break from a kiss.    He moves her away from him. 
RACINE We won't talk for a long time. 
She nods.   They look at each other.   She gets out. 
EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT 
The rented Ford speeds through the foggy night.

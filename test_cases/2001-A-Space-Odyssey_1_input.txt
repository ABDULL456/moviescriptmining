BOWMAN You're kidding. 
POOLE No.

BOWMAN (softly) What the hell is going on? 
POOLE I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure. 
BOWMAN Two units in four days. How many spares do we have? 
POOLE Two more. 
BOWMAN Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.

C69 IN POD BAY BOWMAN OBTAINS ANOTHER COMPONENT FROM THE WAREHOUSE GOES OUT IN THE POD AND REPLACES IT. 
POOLE WORKS IN THE COMMAND MODULE. 
THIS WILL BE A CONDENSED VERSION OF THE PREVIOUS SCENE WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES. 
THE SETS WILL CONSIST OF POD BAY, COMMAND MODULE, POD INTERIOR.

C70 POD BAY. BOWMAN AND POOLE LEANING OVER THE FAULTY COMPONENT, AGAIN WIRED TO TESTING GEAR. 
BOTH MEN STARE IN PUZZLED SILENCE. 
SEE DISPLAYS FLASH EACH TESTING PARA- METER. 
BOWMAN (after long silence) Well, as far as I'm concerned, there isn't a damn thing wrong with these units. I think we've got a much more serious problem. 
POOLE Hal? 
BOWMAN Yes.

C72 COMMUNICATIONS AREA. 
MISSION CONTROL I wouldn't worry too much about the computer. First of all, there is still a chance that he is right, despite your tests, and if it should happen again, we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails. 
If the computer should turn out to be wrong, the situation is still not alarming. The type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers. 
It has almost always revolved around a single detail, such as the one you have described, and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer's performance in other areas. 
No one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning. It may be over-programming, (con't)

MISSION CONTROL (con't) but it could also be any number of reasons. 
In any event, it is somewhat analogous to human neurotic behavior. Does this answer your query?  Zero-five-three- Zero, MC, transmission concluded.

She comes over to the register with an order. Mumford is am[...] her, likes her a lot. 
MUMFORD Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily? 
LILY I think it's like... inquisitive. 
MUMFORD It was Henry Follett. 
LILY (reacts) Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is. 
MUMFORD What do you want to know? 
LILY You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything. 
A Patron passes on the way out. 
PATRON Hey, Doc... how's it going? 
MUMFORD Fine, Vincent... how's yourself? 
LILY How long you been in this town? 
MUMFORD Oh, I don't know... 
LILY Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long. (Mumford gives her a look) And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined. 
MUMFORD Lily, I don't think even you could know that -- 
Lily sees something out the window. 
LILY Look at that guy... 
Mumford turns to look out the window. A young man of about 30, in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, is skateboarding down the street at high speed, weaving in and out amongst the cars. He zips past the front of the restaurant. 
LILY You know who that is, don't you? (Mumford does not) You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down. 
MUMFORD Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man. 
LILY hands over Mumford's bagged order, rings it up. Back on track: 
LILY So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret? 
MUMFORD (takes his bag to go) You like me. How come? 
LILY Not sure. Let me think about it. 
Mumford is smiling as he goes out. Another Patron, LIONEL DILLARD, a lawyer, brings his check to Lily, watching Mumford cross the street. Lily can't stand this guy. 
LIONEL That's the new psychiatrist? 
LILY Psychologist. He's not medical. 
LIONEL Probably thinks he's pretty smart. 
Lily gives him a look as she takes his money. 
INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY 
An overweight, teenage girl named NESSA WATKINS is on Mumford's couch. She fidgets as she talks and can't decide whether to lie down (so she's looking away from him) or sit up and face him. She plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps taking out a lighter, then stuffing it back in her big, sloppy handbag. 
NESSA ...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America. 
MUMFORD What do you mean, "in no time"? 
NESSA In maybe three or four issues. 
MUMFORD Weekly or monthly? 
NESSA Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff? 
MUMFORD Why do you think you tell me, Nessa? 
NESSA Don't do that thing... (Mumford: what?) ...that shrink thing. 
MUMFORD It's a big part of the show. 
She jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter, but is afraid to actually break his rules.

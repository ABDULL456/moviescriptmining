MARY I'm okay. 
Katherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her. 
KATHERINE It's going to be okay... We're all going to be okay... 
The chattering, hissing sycophant grabs Gabriel's body by the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door. Lucifer has remained behind, crouched on his haunches, his liquid, yellow eyes on Katherine. 
KATHERINE I can't quite bring myself to say thank you. 
LUCIFER I understand. 
KATHERINE Then this is done. 
LUCIFER Not necessarily. Maybe I like you. Maybe I want you to come with me. 
He rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her. 
LUCIFER You owe me, Katherine. And you're going to ask me to take you home. 
KATHERINE (clutching Mary) No. 
LUCIFER You will. You will because any other way is going to be more awful than you can imagine. 
KATHERINE Are you threatening me? 
Just a grinning, twisted stare. 
KATHERINE Then you've picked the wrong person this time. I've just about had it up to here with ghosts. So you can put away the horror movie sneer and the K-Mart halloween eyes, because we know you now. We know you all. And if you want to force the issue then go ahead because you're just another angel to me. Take a look at your buddy Gabriel. Then ask yourself, do you really, really want to fuck with us? 
The smallest hint of a pause. 
LUCIFER Perhaps another time. 
KATHERINE I'm holding my breath. 
LUCIFER Goodbye, Katherine. For now. 
And he's gone. Through the door and into the night. 
MARY Is he coming back? 
KATHERINE I don't think so, honey... I don't think so... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
The fullness of day over Old Woman Butte, hot and bright. Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon. 
The village is full of police vehicles now. Green broncos from the Navaho Tribal Police. Blue and white sheriff department sedans. 
The Navaho cops are talking with Katherine and Mary. Thomas is sitting on the trunk of a patrol car getting his wounds properly bandaged as the Sheriff we met earlier leans beside him chewing on a wild oat stalk. 
SHERIFF (to deputy bandaging Thomas) Is he going to live? 
DEPUTY With any luck. 
SHERIFF (to Thomas) I thought I told you to give me a call if anything snarled. 
DAGGETT There wasn't a phone. 
SHERIFF Hmmm. 
He chews some more on his stalk. Looks off at the village. 
SHERIFF This fella, Gabriel... 
DAGGETT Yeah. 
SHERIFF Gabriel what? 
DAGGETT Just Gabriel. 
SHERIFF Pretty violent guy, Gabriel. Even for out here. 
DAGGETT Yeah. 
SHERIFF Caught up with him at the village? 
DAGGETT He caught up with me. 
SHERIFF What were you doing way up here? 
DAGGETT Enemy Ghost Way for Mary Tsosie. 
SHERIFF Indian stuff.

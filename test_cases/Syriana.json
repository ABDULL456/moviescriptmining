And anywhere one can dream is good, providing the place is obscure, and the horizon vast. \nVICTOR HUGO If a triangle could speak it would say that God is eminently triangular. \nSPINOZA \nFADE IN: \n1 EXT. TEHRAN, IRAN - MORNING 1 \nThe minarets of Shi'a mosques dot the skyline. The sun rises through the smog. Keening SIRENS call the faithful. A GROUP of bearded, turbanned MEN in white robes carrying Korans walk down an empty street. \nAs the religious men pass a nondescript metal door, a THUMPING SOUND rises... \nThe door cracks open and THREE MUSLIM WOMEN in full black sack emerge. The door shuts quickly behind them. Stay with the THREE MUSLIM WOMEN as they walk away. CLICK CLICK CLICK on the cobblestone. We hear GIGGLES. \nSUPERTITLE: TEHRAN, IRAN One of them reaches down and removes stiletto high-heels, which disappear under-the black cloth. \n2 INT. PRIVATE NIGHTCLUB - MORNING 2 \nDown two flights of crowded stairs, there's a bar, dance floor, low couches, minimal lighting, wasted PEOPLE. Wealthy young IRANIANS sit at a table littered with ice- buckets and bottles of Absolut and Johnnie Walker. And with them is BOB BAER, 40's, professionally nondescript, he could be anything, a salesman, a high- school teacher. His face is ever-changing and his eyes miss nothing. Bob is the only American in the place and still you almost wouldn't notice him. \nARASH AMIRI, 20's, a confident young Iranian, yells over the music. Beside him is his BROTHER. \nARASH AMIRI Have you ever tried liquid MDMA? Bob's forehead is sweating and his hair is sticking to it, which he wipes away as he sips his scotch. \nBOB Liquid MDMA? No, I never tried it. \nThe music is louder. Arash proudly shouts over it -- \nARASH AMIRI Tehran is the world capital! \n(CONTINUED) \n2 CONTINUED: 2 Bob doesn't respond. Arash shouts again -- \nABASH AMIRI (CONT'D) So, how's the kid? \nBOB Great. He's great. Arash just stares. Bob sips his drink. \nBOB (CONT'D) Are we gonna do this? A girl begins to dance in front of Arash. \nABASH AMIRI After prayer -- \n3 EXT. TEHRAN ROOFTOP - DAY 3 \nDISTANT POV down to the street as TWO CARS pull up. Bob gets out of one, walks to the rear, opens the trunk -- \n4 EXT. TEHRAN STREET - DAY 4 \nThe trunk SLAMS. Bob carries a worn ATTACHE CASE. The Amiris get out of their car, oblivious Shiite party boys. Bob walks, happy. Dour MEN at cafe tables miss nothing. \n5 INT. KEBAB SHOP - DAY 5 \nCorrugated metal shutters CLOSE, sealing out the light. Arash ushers Bob through the gloom toward TWO MILITARY CASES. Bob expertly flips one over and opens it. Inside: A STINGER MISSILE, neatly disassembled. He finds the serial number: 3j16w4921. A SMILEY FACE is scratched into the metal of the Stinger. Bob tries to activate the Stinger. It's dead. Arash and his brother perspire. Bob is perspiring. Bob thinks he hears faint MOUTH BREATHING from behind the curtain closing off the rear of the shop. Bob opens HIS ATTACHE CASE. He removes a pouch. The pouch holds a battery. The battery has a serial number. Bob finds: 3j16w4921. A perfect match. He removes the dead battery and replaces it with the live battery. He activates the missile. It works. Everyone is relieved. \n(CONTINUED) \n5 CONTINUED: 5 Bob moves to THE NEXT MILITARY CASE. He replaces the next battery and activates the second missile. Arash and his brother share a celebratory glance. Arash suddenly takes ONE CASE and drags it through the curtain. Bob hears LOW VOICES. He turns questioningly to Arash's brother who just stares and smiles like an idiot. Then Arash reappears, passing by Bob. \nBOB You said they were both for you. Arash tosses an envelope at Bob -- \nARASH AMIRI What do you care? Bob glances in the envelope. Behind him, the Amiris are picking up the other case. Bob moves toward the curtain. IN THE BACK OF THE SHOP Bob's eyes adjust. Several robed shapes, ghosts in grey light, carry the case out a door. The BARREL OF A GUN touches the side of Bob's head. The SOUND of a SHELL CHAMBERED and a MOUTH BREATHER. Bob raises his hands. The barrel slides around to his forehead and Bob is staring into the blue eyes of MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA, 40's, bearded, and calm. \nBOB (FARSI) I was looking for the bathroom. MSA seems remarkably serene, then he screams in Arabic. \nBOB (FARSI) (CONT'D) You don't speak Farsi, do you, you son of a goat? MSA screams again, tightening his finger on the trigger, then he backs out the door, never losing aim on Bob. \n", "test1_true": "The HIGH POV down to the street. The Amiris exit the kebab shop carrying the REMAINING MILITARY CASE. CAMERA ADJUSTS to incorporate SOMEONE'S HAND on the rooftop. And next to it, a remote-control TRIGGER DEVICE. \n7 EXT. TEHRAN STREET - DAY 7 \nAs the Amiris carry the case toward their car, Bob appears in the doorway and heads up the street toward us. Behind Bob, in the distance, the Amiris get into the car. Bob glances up at the roof and NODS ONCE, continuing to walk toward camera as -- The car EXPLODES. Bob walks on as if nothing happened. \n8 INT. TEHRAN CAFE - DAY 8 \nTight on the game of Asteroids. The version from the 70's. Black and white triangle \"spaceship\" spinning, shooting white dots at drifting \"rocks,\" breaking them up, only to create more rocks. A hand rapidly hits the firing button. ROBBY BAER, 16, concentrates, hits hyper space, smiles, remembers he has a retainer, hides his smile. He glances over at a cafe table where Bob and MARGARET BAER, 40's, frank and guarded in a way that is compelling, are having morning coffee. We realize that all around them are IRANIANS, that a crowd is massing in the street outside, and that Bob clearly doesn't want to have this conversation. \nMARGARET If you go back you get promoted. Which could open doors later. For consulting. \nBOB Those people back there don't know what's going on. They don't wanna know. \nMARGARET Have you thought about college? Has that made it onto the radar screen? \nBOB And it's not like anybody else could roll in here. It's not like it's just reading reports. \nMARGARET I took Pakistan because of the hardship pay. The private school \nTUITION -- \n(CONTINUED) \n8 CONTINUED: 8 Bob's expression, not unkind, but familiar to her, says he knows exactly why she took Pakistan. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) I believe in what I'm doing, too. They look at each other. \nBOB Well, then here we are. \nMARGARET Here we are. In the street it's turning into a full-blown protest. \nBOB Let's say, somehow, I get a Branch or even a Group, then what? Will you come? Will you bring Robby? Now, Margaret looks away. A STUDENT-LEADER is up on a platform brandishing a Coke bottle, SHOUTING in Farsi into a bullhorn. \nMARGARET What's he saying? \nBOB He's against the ban on Coca-Cola. He says you have to fix your soul, which is not something you can put on a soft-drink. We see the faces of the protesters, silently staring, their mouths covered by black tape. \nCUT TO: \n9 INT. WOODMAN HOUSE - MORNING 9 \nAt a kitchen table, RILEY, almost 3, puts his hand in a bowl of dry Cheerios, squishes it around, then throws a handful on the floor. \nBRYAN (O.S.) You are a Cheerio dissemination device. Yes, you are -- Pull back to find his father, BRYAN WOODMAN, American, late 20's, in a shirt and tie. Blonde and blue-eyed like a modern T.E. Lawrence, he's lost in the child, sharing his sense of wonder. \n(CONTINUED) \n9 CONTINUED: 9 \nJULIE (O.S.) Don't let him do that, please. His wife, JULIE WOODMAN, 28, sleepy American, very fit in sweats, cooks bacon at an older range. They have the worst house in the best neighborhood and have yet to properly furnish it. \nBRYAN . An evolutionarily perfect machine for the spreading of imported Cheerios to all corners of the kitchen. The toddler smiles at him. Julie puts four plates down. They both notice the empty place setting. Just then, a golden boy, MAX, 6, enters the kitchen. \nMAX Mommy, I want bacon. \nJULIE You have bacon. Max sits at the table. \nMAX I want real bacon. \nJULIE You have real bacon, only it's made from soy beans. Max looks at his plate. \nMAX I want pig bacon. \n10 EXT. GENEVA WATERFRONT - DAY 10 \nBryan drives a BMW wagon along Lake Geneva, the fountain spouting into the sky. A kite is wedged upside down in the foot well. \nSUPERTITLE: GENEVA, SWITZERLAND On every building signs advertise watch companies. \n11 INT.

DIVISION CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY 28 \nThe idea of promoting Bob gains traction -- \nFRANKS Bob's a hero. They'll give him something good. He is an Iran expert. \nDIVISION CHIEF Fred, Bob's never had a desk job, never done nine-to-five. Can he show up to work everyday? Can he stay on message? \n(CONTINUED) \n28 CONTINUED: 28 \nFRANKS Yes, absolutely. I'll prep him. \nCUT TO: \n29 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY 29 \nBob waits in a hard back chair. It's a spare, functional, highly polished place. Marines like statues stand guard. VOICES come from a partially open door across the hall. \nMARILYN (V.0.) Imagine gasoline ten dollars a gallon at the pump. Or heating oil that costs twenty-five hundred a month for a two-bedroom apartment. If oil goes to a hundred a barrel, the U.S. turns into a third-world country. That is a fact. \nTERRY GEORGE (V.0.) Do you have any analysis to back up that fact? \nSUPERTITLE: WASHINGTON, D.C. \nDISTINGUISHED VOICE (V.0.) In the next fifteen years, The North Sea and Alaska dry up. Two million barrels a day to the U.S. gone. That is a known fact. \n30 INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY 30 \nThe Deputies Meeting. A small room with recessed lighting filled with the rung below the top-tier of Washington bureaucracy. Navy STENO GUYS record the conversation. \nTERRY GEORGE I need data supporting known facts. Because what I know is that in the entire region when we even whisper our support, those people are delegitimized. TERRY GEORGE, 40's, Deputy CIA Chief, quite a good guy to those in power, speaks to a DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN, 60's. Through the partially open door, one third of Bob is visible. \nDISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN Iraq had no established ethnic majority. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n30 CONTINUED: 30 \nDISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN (CONT'D) It's like trying to organize Louisiana. Iran, on the other hand, is Persian -- The Deputy National Security Advisor, MARILYN RICHARDS, 40's, sculpted hair, with the soul of a seventy year-old white, Republican male, is in charge -- \nMARILYN There has been some good news concerning Iran lately. Right, Terry? \nTERRY GEORGE For Iran, yes -- \nMARILYN The President is very interested in Iran, Terry. Marilyn takes in the presence of the DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN sitting near her. Terry slides a file across the table to her. \nTERRY GEORGE I know that, Marilyn. In fact, we just pulled one of our officers out and I took the initiative to ask him to come down here. He infiltrated Hezbollah in Beirut in the eighties, won himself some nice medals. We're thinking about giving him a station. \nMARILYN Beirut in the eighties, is that a resume builder? Polite chuckles follow Terry George to the doorway. \n31 INT. OUTSIDE SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY 31 \nTerry George appears, crooks a finger. As Bob passes -- \nTERRY GEORGE Don't chomp down on any bait. He looms over Bob, pointedly taps Bob's files -- \nTERRY GEORGE (CONT'D) We're fine. Iran is fine. Fine. \n32 INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY 32 \nBob sweats slightly as he plows on, reading from notes. \n(CONTINUED) \n32 CONTINUED: 32 \n", "test2_true": "BOB (CONT'D) And we're reprogramming resources into Iran. Our next review will show that --- \nMARILYN Thank you for coming over, Mr. Baer. Welcome back and forgive me if I wade right in, but forgetting for a second your bureaucratic checklist, I'm trying to get undigested information, so if you could give me a reading of the temperature over there? Bob glances at Terry. Exasperated, Marilyn continues. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) India is now our ally. Russia is our ally. Even China will be an ally. Everybody between Morocco and Pakistan is the problem. Failed states and failed economies, but Iran is a natural cultural ally of the U.S. The Persians do not want to roll back the clock to the 8th century. I see students marching in the streets. I hear Khatami making the right sounds. And what I'd like to know is if we keep embargoing them on energy, then someday soon are we going to get a nice, secular, pro-Western, pro-business government? The steno guys type away. A long beat on Bob. \nBOB It's possible. It's complicated. \nMARILYN Of course it is, Mr. Baer. Thank you for your time. Bob looks to Terry who nods. Bob starts to leave. \n(CONTINUED) \n32 CONTINUED: ( 2) 32 \nMARILYN (CONT'D) (sotto, to the room) Intelligence is the misnomer of the century. Bob stops. He can't help himself -- \nBOB They let young people march in the street and then the next day shut down fifty newspapers. They have a few satellite dishes up on roofs, let 'em have My Two Dads, but that doesn't mean the Ayatollahs have relinquished one iota of control over that nation. The steno guys hands are frozen. \nDISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN Mr. Baer, the reform movement in Iran is one of the President's great hopes for the region and crucial to the petroleum security of the United States. \nTERRY GEORGE \n(A WARNING) These gentlemen are with the CLI. Bob has no idea what this is or whether he should answer. \nDISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN The Committee for the Liberation of Iran, Mr. Baer. \nBOB We've had Iran in embargo for almost thirty years, we backed their neighbor, a neighbor we invaded twice, in a ten year war against them, we're hanging on by a thread with a massive occupation force, so I got news for you... Thomas Jefferson just ain't that popular over there right now. Silence except for the steno guys clicking away, then complete silence. Terry George stares at Bob a long beat. \nTERRY GEORGE That will be all, Mr. Baer. \nCUT TO: \n33 EXT. CAPITOL HILL APARTMENT - MORNING 33 \nBennett exits a cab, walks up the steps with an overnight bag. A MAN, 60's, tough and well-preserved, in a dark suit and tie, waits on the stoop with a folded paper. \nDANNY DALTON (V.0.) I hear phrases thrown around like \"the corrupting influence of money\" or \"the evil influence of dollars in politics,\" when more money was spent on the syndication rights to Seinfeld than on the whole of the last presidential election. Bennett just walks past him to open the door. \n34 INT. BENNETT'S APARTMENT - MORNING 34 \nA nice three bedroom that is part of the quiet gentrification movement not yet reflected in the streets. Cable news plays silently in the living room. There's a goldfish in a small aquarium. Through a door, Bennett and the man are in the kitchen. \n35 INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 35 \nA SMALL TV: plays C-Span testimony on Campaign Finance Reform. DANNY DALTON, 40's, an \"oilman,\" testifies. \nDANNY DALTON Last election cycle I spent three hundred thousand. I got pictures of myself with the President that I use all over the world. People don't know Danny Dalton, but they know the President of the United States and they see that I know the President of the United States... Bennett has showered and changed. He makes coffee. The man sits at a dinette. He lights a cigarette. \nBENNETT I'm not making this coffee for you. I'm making it for me. You I'm making oatmeal and then you sleep. \nBENNETT SENIOR You look like shit. \n(CONTINUED) \n35 CONTINUED: 35 Bennett just stares for a moment. Bennett takes the oatmeal off the stove, sets a bowl in front of the man whose fingernails are black, whose dark suit is filthy. \nBENNETT Are you working? \nBENNETT SENIOR I had a little trouble at work. Bennett grabs his travel coffee and starts away -- \nBENNETT There's some beer in the fridge for after you wake up, so you don't die on my floor of the DT's. And no smoking in my house. Bennett leaves the kitchen. The man yells after him. \nBENNETT SENIOR I don't need your goddamn hospitality. The front door SLAMS. The man glances up at a photo of Bennett Jr. at his Howard University graduation. And next to it, the man, BENNETT SR., graduating 25 years earlier. ON TV: old, white senators listening judiciously. \nDANNY DALTON (ON TV) In our country we don't stuff dollars into ballot boxes. What we do is turn money into votes and what turns money into votes is free speech - the ability of a candidate to get his message out - and that takes money, real money, meaning, not so loosely translated: MONEY IS SPEECH! And last time I checked, speech in the USA is protected. You can't limit my advocacy just because it works. I have a sovereign, inalienable right to petition my government. Tilt up to find Bennett Senior, part of a six pack dangling from two fingers, staring at a wall covered with an intricate MATRIX of KILLEEN OIL's limited partnerships and strategic alliances all over the world. \n(CONTINUED) \n35 CONTINUED: (2) 35 \nDANNY DALTON (CONT'D) The money I gave the President is the best investment I have ever made in my business. Next election cycle I plan to double it. \n(BEAT) And why is it some dirty little secret that it's in America's interest to do business overseas? Bennett Sr. stares up at the wall.

Seventy-five million dollars... \n(BEAT) How much for my other kid? Prince Nasir stares at Bryan. \nBRYAN (CONT'D) If I were your economic advisor I'd tell you it's not the dumbest thing you've ever done, but it'll probably be the dumbest thing you do today. Probably. \n(BEAT) But why would you need an economic advisor? Twenty years ago you had the highest GNP in the world and now you're tied with Paraguay. Your second biggest export is second-hand goods. Followed by dates on which you lose five cents a pound. \n(BEAT) You want to know what the business world thinks of you. They think a hundred years ago you were chopping each other's heads off in the desert and that's exactly where you'll be in another hundred. So, yes, on behalf of my firm, I accept your money... \nNASIR Okay, fine. I'll have the money forwarded to your firm immediately. \n(BEAT) And I'll give you another hundred million for the other kid. They look at each other. \nNASIR (CONT'D) OK. So now that you're my economic advisor; tell me something I haven't heard. Bryan stares a beat, thinking. \nBRYAN Okay. You want an idea, here's an idea. \n(CONTINUED) \n82 CONTINUED: (2) 82 He draws in the sand: he draws Nasir's kingdom, the Persian Gulf, Iran. Turkey. And Europe. \nBRYAN (CONT'D) Your kingdom is here. The North Field is here. Europe is here. Because of trade restrictions and outdated alliances, you've been selling your gas for peanuts, loading it on ships, and waving as it sails away. (re: the stick) But, pretend for a second this is excess Iranian pipeline capacity. He lays the stick across the circles in the sand like an overland pipe running to Europe. \nBRYAN (CONT'D) Here is your route. Overland. Through Iran. You commoditize it, you control it, you take it right to the front door of every home in Europe. Your profit just went up by a factor of three, possibly four. I think that's a pretty good idea. Overhead the falcons spiral higher and higher, chasing. each other in the sky. The rising MURMUR of AMENS -- \nCUT TO: \n83 INT. SUBURBAN MEGA CHURCH - DAY 83 \nA cavernous mega church, a religious Wal-Mart with 8500 worshippers in stadium seating. REVERAND STEWART, 30's, intelligent and sincere, wears a headset -- \nREVERAND STEWART And when Jesus had been Baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, \"This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.\" Let us pray: 0 God, open our hearts to your word and open your word to our hearts. Amen. AMENS. Danny Dalton, his WIFE and CHILDREN sit in good seats up front. Danny has a flag pin on his lapel. \n(CONTINUED) \n83 CONTINUED: 83 \nREVERAND STEWART (CONT'D) This is the third in our four week series on Luke 2:52. And Jesus continued to grow in wisdom, stature, and in the love of God and those who knew him. The task is NOT getting more of God, but letting God get MORE of us. High above the pulpit, dead center of the auditorium is a giant American flag waving under the cross. Slowly the MURMURING RISE of different PRAYERS. \nCUT TO: \n84 INT. MOSQUE - PERSIAN GULF - DAY 84 \nA long narrow mosque packed with men kneeling shoulder to shoulder CHANTING PRAYERS. Most of them are under thirty. Their movements are unified and ecstatic. \nTHE CLERIC (V.0.) They will try to disguise the difference, to make Muslims who speak about religion appear to be fanatics or backward people. \n85 INT. MADRASSA - DAY 85 \nBoys study at small desks. Boys chanting. Boys lined up. Even smaller boys at smaller desks. \n86 INT. SMALL ROOM - MADRASSA - DAY 86 \nA circle of TEENAGERS, round-shouldered, melancholy, including Farooq and Wasim, sit at a table eating lamb and french fries. \nTHE CLERIC (V.0.) They will tell us the dispute is over economic resources or military domination and if we believe that we play right into their hands, with only ourselves to blame. There is a remarkable contrast between the setting at the government barracks (sterile, poor) and the Mosque (warm, rich). The teenagers wear serious expressions and try/fail to be respectful as they gorge. \n(CONTINUED) \n86 CONTINUED: 86 \nTHE CLERIC (CONT'D) No. The divide between human nature and modern life cannot be bridged by free trade. No. It cannot be cured with deregulation, privatization, openness or lower taxes. No. THE CLERIC, 40, is a serene man whose beard and glasses make him appear older than his age. Wasim watches as he talks in hypnotic cadence, making eye contact with each boy in turn. \nTHE CLERIC (CONT'D) The pain of living in the modern world will never be solved by a liberal society. The Cleric's sympathetic gaze falls on Wasim who is bruised with black eyes from his beating. \nTHE CLERIC (CONT'D) Liberal societies have failed. Christian theology has failed. The West has failed. He serves more lamb and vegetables to Wasim's plate. Wasim begins hungrily eating again. \n", "test3_true": "Boys pull a plow in the fields. The sound of BEES. \nTHE CLERIC (V.0.) The divine and the worldly are but a single concept and that concept is Koran. They walk past bee hives spaced across the desert. Farooq and Wasim and two OTHERS are with him. \nTHE CLERIC (CONT'D) No separation of religion and state - Koran. Instead of Kings legislating and slaves obeying - Koran. They stand in a corn field growing in the desert. The boys are impressed with themselves as only young, uneducated men can be when discussing philosophy and politics with a learned man. \n(CONTINUED) \n87 CONTINUED: 87 \nTHE CLERIC (CONT'D) The true confrontation is over Islam. They must eradicate Islam in order to rescue their own doctrine from extinction. True Islam will end up partial Islam. And partial Islam cannot exist. The cleric bends down to pull a weed. \nTHE CLERIC (CONT'D) Do you believe me when I tell you this? Wasim watches Farooq nod emphatically. They are full and The Cleric seems to know everything in the world.

But he's on the phone, the cord dangling from ear to Blackberry which reads \"work.\" \nBRYAN (INTO PHONE) He invited me to come with him. I think he thinks he's somekindof reformer.

Bryan's phone vibrates again - JULIE HOME. He turns the phone off. \nPRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) However, unlike Washington's Greater Middle East Initiative, we respect each country's right to move at its own pace. APPLAUSE. One leader after another solemnly shake hands with Nasir as a photographer records the moment. \nANGLE - A WEATHERED MAN In the crowd with a student's backpack at his feet. PRINCE NASIR moves down the steps. Bryan and the rest of his entourage join him heading toward black limousines. WEATHERED MAN picks up his pack, moves around the crowd, slips past a barrier. \nWEATHERED MAN (ARABIC) (to Prince Nasir) You are a good man. I want to shake your hand. The bodyguards and police start shouting in Arabic. \nGUARDS (ARABIC) Stop. Don't move -- WEATHERED MAN wears a serious expression heading straight for Nasir who turns and sees him -- \nWEATHERED MAN (ARABIC) You are good man. Like Sadat, you will shake my hand. Good man. The guards are SCREAMING. People start scattering -- The weathered man is reaching in his backpack -- \n(CONTINUED) \n89 CONTINUED: (2) 89 BODYGUARDS grab Nasir, hustling him toward a limo. Bryan lunging after them -- The weathered man is tackled and pummeled. The limos race away, sirens blaring, flags flying. The weathered man is held and searched. They find pens and pads. His spilled bag held books. \n90 INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY 90 \nNasir and Bryan in a stretch with bodyguards as they race away with sirens blaring and flags flying. Bryan is pale. He watches Prince Nasir settle back into his seat. An AIDE fires Arabic at him. \nAIDE (ARABIC) Your highness, do you still want to meet and greet? \nPRINCE NASIR (ARABIC) Everything as scheduled. Nasir looks out the window. He switches to English for Bryan but is speaking more to himself. \nPRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) Respect the right to move at their own pace. Respect the right to do nothing is more like it. Except condemn Israel and strengthen the conservative religious movements. \n91 INT. ALBERGO LOBBY - DAY 91 \nPrince Nasir and his party enter the hotel and sweep through the lobby. They approach the elevators. Bryan and Prince Nasir and one bodyguard enter an elevator. \n92 INT. ELEVATOR - ALBERGO - DAY .92 \nThe elevator TONES at another floor. The elevator stops, the door opens and BOB stands there. \nPRINCE NASIR American? \nBOB Canadian.

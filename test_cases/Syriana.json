{"train": "SYRIANA \nWritten by \nStephen Gaghan \nBased on the book \"See No Evil\" by \nRobert Baer \nExile is not a material thing, it is a spiritual thing, all corners of the earth exactly the same. And anywhere one can dream is good, providing the place is obscure, and the horizon vast. \nVICTOR HUGO If a triangle could speak it would say that God is eminently triangular. \nSPINOZA \nFADE IN: \n1 EXT. TEHRAN, IRAN - MORNING 1 \nThe minarets of Shi'a mosques dot the skyline. The sun rises through the smog. Keening SIRENS call the faithful. A GROUP of bearded, turbanned MEN in white robes carrying Korans walk down an empty street. \nAs the religious men pass a nondescript metal door, a THUMPING SOUND rises... \nThe door cracks open and THREE MUSLIM WOMEN in full black sack emerge. The door shuts quickly behind them. Stay with the THREE MUSLIM WOMEN as they walk away. CLICK CLICK CLICK on the cobblestone. We hear GIGGLES. \nSUPERTITLE: TEHRAN, IRAN One of them reaches down and removes stiletto high-heels, which disappear under-the black cloth. \n2 INT. PRIVATE NIGHTCLUB - MORNING 2 \nDown two flights of crowded stairs, there's a bar, dance floor, low couches, minimal lighting, wasted PEOPLE. Wealthy young IRANIANS sit at a table littered with ice- buckets and bottles of Absolut and Johnnie Walker. And with them is BOB BAER, 40's, professionally nondescript, he could be anything, a salesman, a high- school teacher. His face is ever-changing and his eyes miss nothing. Bob is the only American in the place and still you almost wouldn't notice him. \nARASH AMIRI, 20's, a confident young Iranian, yells over the music. Beside him is his BROTHER. \nARASH AMIRI Have you ever tried liquid MDMA? Bob's forehead is sweating and his hair is sticking to it, which he wipes away as he sips his scotch. \nBOB Liquid MDMA? No, I never tried it. \nThe music is louder. Arash proudly shouts over it -- \nARASH AMIRI Tehran is the world capital! \n(CONTINUED) \n2 CONTINUED: 2 Bob doesn't respond. Arash shouts again -- \nABASH AMIRI (CONT'D) So, how's the kid? \nBOB Great. He's great. Arash just stares. Bob sips his drink. \nBOB (CONT'D) Are we gonna do this? A girl begins to dance in front of Arash. \nABASH AMIRI After prayer -- \n3 EXT. TEHRAN ROOFTOP - DAY 3 \nDISTANT POV down to the street as TWO CARS pull up. Bob gets out of one, walks to the rear, opens the trunk -- \n4 EXT. TEHRAN STREET - DAY 4 \nThe trunk SLAMS. Bob carries a worn ATTACHE CASE. The Amiris get out of their car, oblivious Shiite party boys. Bob walks, happy. Dour MEN at cafe tables miss nothing. \n5 INT. KEBAB SHOP - DAY 5 \nCorrugated metal shutters CLOSE, sealing out the light. Arash ushers Bob through the gloom toward TWO MILITARY CASES. Bob expertly flips one over and opens it. Inside: A STINGER MISSILE, neatly disassembled. He finds the serial number: 3j16w4921. A SMILEY FACE is scratched into the metal of the Stinger. Bob tries to activate the Stinger. It's dead. Arash and his brother perspire. Bob is perspiring. Bob thinks he hears faint MOUTH BREATHING from behind the curtain closing off the rear of the shop. Bob opens HIS ATTACHE CASE. He removes a pouch. The pouch holds a battery. The battery has a serial number. Bob finds: 3j16w4921. A perfect match. He removes the dead battery and replaces it with the live battery. He activates the missile. It works. Everyone is relieved. \n(CONTINUED) \n5 CONTINUED: 5 Bob moves to THE NEXT MILITARY CASE. He replaces the next battery and activates the second missile. Arash and his brother share a celebratory glance. Arash suddenly takes ONE CASE and drags it through the curtain. Bob hears LOW VOICES. He turns questioningly to Arash's brother who just stares and smiles like an idiot. Then Arash reappears, passing by Bob. \nBOB You said they were both for you. Arash tosses an envelope at Bob -- \nARASH AMIRI What do you care? Bob glances in the envelope. Behind him, the Amiris are picking up the other case. Bob moves toward the curtain. IN THE BACK OF THE SHOP Bob's eyes adjust. Several robed shapes, ghosts in grey light, carry the case out a door. The BARREL OF A GUN touches the side of Bob's head. The SOUND of a SHELL CHAMBERED and a MOUTH BREATHER. Bob raises his hands. The barrel slides around to his forehead and Bob is staring into the blue eyes of MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA, 40's, bearded, and calm. \nBOB (FARSI) I was looking for the bathroom. MSA seems remarkably serene, then he screams in Arabic. \nBOB (FARSI) (CONT'D) You don't speak Farsi, do you, you son of a goat? MSA screams again, tightening his finger on the trigger, then he backs out the door, never losing aim on Bob. \n36 EXT. EMIR'S ESTATE - MARBELLA - DAY 36 \nBryan and Julie and the kids arrive at the manicured entrance of a vast, impressive estate, their rental wagon anomalous among Bentleys and Rolls. An Arab valet opens Julie's door. The kids are excited. \n37 EXT. GARDEN - DAY 37 \nA geometric sculpture garden. Giacomettis and Henry Moores. A TV monitor plays video of gardens and flowers. GUESTS cluster together. You could almost tag labels on them: arms dealer, Ambassador, Minister of Trees. Bryan and Julie and the kids wander into the party. \nBRYAN .I'm probably the tenth guy this month to pitch something like this. It's like the Godfather. Emir, I come to you on this special day. Vincent is riding motorcycles through Cambodia, through land-mines. Some charity thing. \nJULIE That's guilt not charity. He's Catholic and can't view himself as a shallow model f.u.c.k.e.r, which he is. And when war breaks out in some energy producing country, he's the first one into work. Bryan looks at her. \nJULIE (CONT'D) Honey... you're a man who supports his family, not a boy. \n(CONTINUED) \n37 CONTINUED: 37 \nBRYAN I thought you like him. Vincent. \nJULIE I do, honey. For you, I like him very much. She takes his hand as they walk. \nVOICE (O.S.) Please, attention please, your host, his majesty, the Emir... ON A TV MONITOR: the Emir, HAMAD AL-SUBAAI, 60's, bearded, overweight, sitting in front of greenery, his TWO SONS behind him, addresses his party guests. \nEMIR (ON TV) It is my pleasure to personally welcome each of you to the Casa De Las Palmas, our oasis of palms in the south of Spain. \n38 INT. EMIR'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 38 \nThe EMIR, his two sons, PRINCE MESHAL, late 20's, weak- chinned, effeminate, with longish hair, and PRINCE NASIR, 30's, handsome, with large expressive eyes, close-cropped hair, powerful and serious, are across a table from \nCHINESE OIL EXECUTIVES. The Emir's PRERECORDED SPEECH drones on -- \nEMIR (ON TV) And symbolic of the affection of my people for each of you. At nine o'clock, we will have wonderful music from the London Philharmonic. Please eat and socialize and enjoy. The Emir ignores himself on TV and turns to business. He recently had a stroke and was filmed from his good side. \nEMIR (CONT'D) (a slight slurring) I am happy to welcome the Chinese to my country and optimistic you will not be nearly as greedy as the Americans. Assiduous nods from the CHINESE oil executives as the King's young Japanese SECRETARY slides contracts across. \n39 EXT. POOL PAVILION - DAY 39 \nBryan and Julie watch Max tentatively approach the pool. Nearby, Riley has introduced himself to an Arab family. \nJULIE Arabs are very family oriented, as a people. Is that racist? Max, a book-oriented, rather than water-oriented, child is afraid to jump in. \nBRYAN \n(WATCHING-MAX) Not if what you're saying is positive. A bigger BOY fakes like he might push him in. Bryan starts to his feet -- \nJULIE Don't. Let him work this out. It's important for his autonomy. Max finds his courage, jumps, and disappears beneath the surface, then bobs up happily. Julie smiles. \nBRYAN Hedge strategies are tough for these guys. Oil goes up the people wonder why those extra billions aren't in the treasury. Prices go down, no one's thanking them for saving a few bucks. Julie looks at her husband to determine whether he's testing his \"pitch\" or in need of encouragement. \nJULIE Make a game of it. Pretend they're six year-olds and you have to get them to eat carrots and all they want is dessert. Make it about good parenting. \n40 INT. EMIR'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DUSK 40 \nEMIR The house is a Genius-Home. One of my sons had it wired by experts from the United States. \n(CONTINUED) \n40 CONTINUED: 40 The Emir sort of wilts, fading out. Prince Meshal foists a remote control on his father. The other son, Prince Nasir observes his father and brother. The Emir rouses. He presses a few buttons. The monitors show the estate: lawn; squash court; guard house. \nPRINCE MESHAL watch... ON TV: the image of a rear guard house. Suddenly, the gate slides back, stops, slides the other way. \nCHINESE OIL EXECUTIVE Your Highness, that is incredible. (to Prince Nasir) Prince Nasir, isn't that amazing? \nPRINCE NASIR \n(DISMISSIVE) Fascinating. The Emir presses the remote. ON TV: seven swimming pools. Meshal proudly shares the moment with his father. \nPRINCE MESHAL Oh, look, it's getting dark, better turn on the lights -- ON SIX OF SEVEN MONITORS: pool lights turn on, shimmering turquoise. One pool remains dark. The Emir notices the dark pool. He presses the device. ON THE MONITOR: The lights go off. He presses again. Six pools light up, but one is still dark. The Emir ignores his son and speaks for the room. \nEMIR Send a fool on a fool's errand. Meshal frantically tries to make the pool light come on. \nON THE MONITOR: ONE IS STILL DARK -- \n41 EXT. POOL SIDE - DUSK 41 \nCHILDREN SCREAM, shouting, playing tag in the crepuscular light beside the dark pool. Max is among the children. \nCUT TO: \n51 INT. TRAILER - FOREIGN WORKERS COMPOUND - DAY 51 \nTight on JOHNNY and PONYBOY just before they run to catch the boxcar in THE OUTSIDERS. \nBOY (O.S.) Why are they running after him? \nWASIM (O.S.) Maybe he has a knife or committed a crime or something. Wasim, Farooq, other men and boys watch a small TV in a cheap trailer, housing for immigrant labor. \nSUPERTITLE: FOREIGN WORKERS COMPOUND - PERSIAN GULF wasim sits with Farooq watching the film. YUNUS, 6, watches Wasim, his older brother, with reverence. \nFAROOQ They gave us french fries at the Madrassa. Wasim's father, Saleem, enters with a few groceries. \nWASIM Papa, close the door. \nANOTHER FRIEND His sister has a thing for you. \nWASIM His sister has a big ass. \n(TO FAROOQ) Of course, at the Madrassa you don't have to worry about that. \nFAROOQ And lamb. We got skewers of lamb. \nYUNUS I like lamb. The children's faces are lit by the TV'S glowing light. \n52 (OMIT) 52 \n53 EXT. GOVERNMENT PLAZA - DAY 53 \nAgainst a wall, YOUNG MEN are frisked by police who tap their legs apart with batons. Above them a watchful portrait of the Emir, in epic pose, astride a stallion. A line of Pakistani and Filipino MEN winds out of a building. People are paranoid. No jokes. Eyes darting. As more MEN arrive, POLICE in riot gear watch them, shouting in Arabic into a bullhorn. Yunus watches Wasim and Saleem. He mimics how his brother stands. An OLD MAN tries to talk to them. \nOLD MAN Hot today. Can't remember the streets this hot. Saleem looks around, sees if anyone was listening, then takes the old man's arm. \nSALEEM You don't want to talk here. Suddenly, a POLICEMAN shoves Saleem from behind. Saleem turns to the officer, already apologizing, but Wasim steps between them. The cop pushes Wasim with his baton. \nPOLICEMAN Tough guy? Is that right, tough guy? What's your name, tough guy? Wasim doesn't say anything. Yunus watches his father and brother. The cop pokes Wasim again with the stick -- \nPOLICEMAN (CONT'D) What's your name? \nWASIM Johnny. The policeman swiftly brings his club down on Wasim's head, dropping him to his knees. other POLICEMEN close. Saleem gets in the middle, but is beaten down. Wasim tries to reach for Yunus who is SCREAMING and hitting at the policeman's legs. A club comes down on Wasim's head -- \nCUT TO: \n54 EXT. PRINCETON UNIVERSITY - DAY 54 \nPerfect calm at a beautiful, rural Ivy League campus with STUDENTS strolling between buildings. \n55 INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY 55 \nTight on note cards of \"conversational topics\" and reminders to be \"natural.\" A perfect MOTHER and FATHER coach their PERFECT NERVOUS DAUGHTER. \nNERVOUS DAUGHTER I learned the value of diversity in my time at the Model U.N. And, across the rich leather and wood anteroom of a Princeton admissions office, Bob and Robby also wait. \nROBBY Maybe you'll get made Ambassador to somewhere cool, like France or Italy or Ghana. What's your dad do? He's Ambassador to Ghana. That's so cool. I know. Bob looks over at his son like he doesn't really know who this person is, which he doesn't. \nBOB How's your mom? \nROBBY \n(FORCED GAIETY) Great! She's great'. The Perfect Family glances over at them. After a beat -- \nROBBY (CONT'D) Do you know what mom's job is? \nBOB she's a secretary. \nROBBY What did she do when you met her? \nBOB She was a secretary. \n(BEAT) Robby, are you nervous? Indignant Robby speaks loudly for The Perfect Family -- \n(CONTINUED) \n55 CONTINUED: 55 \nROBBY I've been airlifted out of foreign countries and I speak three languages because I have to. They'll feel sorry for me. An ADMISSIONS OFFICER signals to Robby who disappears through the door. \nFARISH Not anymore. \n59 INT. SQUASH COURT - DAY 59 \nThe SHARP SOUNDS of SQUASH. Looking through the opaque square of Plexiglas in the door to a squash court, Sydney and Bennett grunt and lunge and sweat. \nSYDNEY I took a bit of a temperature reading. The other associates seem to like you. That's not really a good sign. \nBENNETT I'm sorry, Sir. HIGH ANGLE - down to the fishbowl aspect of the court. Sydney has a very good serve. As they talk he wins three points in a row, Bennett lunging at the spinning ball. \nBENNETT (CONT'D) Sir, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but Kazakhstan... You got capitalists with a K -- Point. \nSYDNEY Six apiece. \n(CONTINUED) \n59 CONTINUED: 59 \nBENNETT You got banker gangsters, gangster bankers. The Federal prosecutor is a good man. Smart. \nHONEST -- \nSYDNEY Inherited a ton of dough -- Point. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) Seven.- Six. Already got his mind made up. Got his teeth in it like a little terrier. As Sydney is talking, he wins the point. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) Eight - Six. Match point. \nBENNETT I think they've got someone inside the deal. Somebody they can squeeze., \nSYDNEY Like an informant? \nBENNETT Yes, Sir. Like an informant. Just my feeling based on their overconfidence. Sydney aces Bennett. \nSYDNEY Match! He turns and holds out his hand. \n60 INT. CLUB ROOM - DAY 60 \nThe casual bar of a fancy, D.C. Men's Club. Very old money. Lots of power. Membership includes one woman, one Jew, and Vernon Jordan. Bennett and Sydney eat lunch. \nSYDNEY If people in oil deals talked to U.S. Attorneys, there'd be no oil business. DEAN WHITING, 60's, congenial, but powerful in build, an ex-marine, an insider for forty years, wanders over. \n(CONTINUED) \n60 CONTINUED: 60 \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) Dean, you know Bennett Holiday. \nBENNETT Good to see you again, Sir. \nSYDNEY We've been discussing the Connex- Killeen merger situation. \nWHITING Will they get approval? Helluva large company if they do. I mean, client. \nBENNETT I don't know, Sir. The Tengiz field, Killeen's largest asset, is being looked at pretty heavily by the U.S. Attorney's office. Sydney Hewitt nods to another club member. Bennett turns to see DONALD FARISH III joining a far table. \nWHITING Well, Bennett, as they say in the bible, there are many, many ways to light Europe. \nCUT TO: \n61 INT. BEDROOM - WOODMAN HOUSE - NIGHT 61 \nA light SWITCHES ON. Bryan and Julie are both awake listening to Riley CRYING down the hall. It's unnerving, but neither one moves right away, perhaps hoping he'll fall back asleep. \nJULIE I wish I could just believe he's floating around on a cloud or in the corner watching us. Julie wants Bryan to comfort her, but he doesn't. \nBRYAN That minister eulogizing our child made me sick. How do you eulogize a child? He was great at playing. He loved popsicles. She rolls into him and he holds her, but he's staring at the ceiling as the child's cries echo down the hallway. \n62 INT. RILEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 62 \nBryan opens the door to his son's bedroom. Riley is standing in his crib, crying inconsolably. \nRILEY (his voice catching) I want to look out the window. He holds up his arms for his father who lifts him. They walk to the window. Riley stops crying instantly, as children will, and shimmies out of his dad's arms. At the window, they stand together, silhouetted against the dark night and distant street light. \nCUT TO: \n63 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 63 \nBRYAN (ON TV) If on Monday Khatami refuses the I.A.E.A. inspectors, look for crude prices to spike yet again. Push into the television -- \nCUT TO: \n66 INT. MINI-STUDIO - DAY 66 \nBryan under the lights, listening. on closer inspection he looks tired and his tie is loosened. \nBRYAN It's not like it's any secret Iran will refuse the snap inspections. (after a pause) okay. Thank you, Rebecca. Bryan nods and the lights go off on Bryan. He stares -- \nBOSS (O.S.) Go home. \nBRYAN It was a stupid question, Henry. \nVINCENT (O.S.) The Prince's man called again. \n(DEFENSIVE) I'm just telling him. \nCUT TO: \n67 EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 67 \nBob and Stan drunkenly exit T.J. O'Toole's into the standard suburban mall parking lot. There is a bright multiplex sign. FAMILIES and TEENAGERS stroll. \nSTAN I like consulting. No, I love it. Love it. And I'll say this for it, private business is efficient. There I said it. Fucking cliche. And the CIA is like what, a thirty billion a year business. so anybody wants to sell anything, a pencil, a computer, they gotta interface through a security clearance -- don't give me shit -- I got two kids in college and we're doing our kitchen. \nBOB Stan, I got a chance to go back. I want to go back. Is it safe for me? \n(CONTINUED) \n67 CONTINUED: 67 \nSTAN You talking about with your wife or the wackos? Bob doesn't say anything. He looks away. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Clear it with Hezbollah... shit, I'm late to pick up Sue. Stan hits his remote lock and leaves Bob standing there. Wide shot of Bob alone in the mall lot gently sloping to IKEA cobalt blue in the distance. \nCUT TO: \n68 EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 68 \nThe bolt action of a gleaming hunting rifle. Danny D., the \"oilman\" whose Congressional testimony was broadcast on CSPAN, sights a weapon. \nDANNY D. Is the Caspian a lake or a sea? \nBENNETT Sea. Caspian Sea. Like seashore. \nDANNY D. Looks like Lake Michigan. Size of Lake Michigan. The Red Sea opens into the Indian Ocean -- Jimmy Pope and OTHER HUNTERS drink and clean thirty ought sixes, their faces lit by firelight. \nJIMMY Caspian's surrounded. Like a pond. Caspian pond. \nDANNY D. France and Russia want it to be a pond, that's for damn sure. The Caspian, I mean. In some court somewhere right now. \n(BEAT) Moot point, hopefully. An animal carcass rotates on a spit over the fire. \n(CONTINUED) \n68 CONTINUED: 68 \nJIMMY \n(TO BENNETT) Mr. Janus, Chairman of Connex, and Dean Whiting, founding partner of your firm, are proud members of the Committee to Liberate Iran. Danny D. here is, too. \nDANNY D. D. is for Dalton. I was on the other side of the Tengiz deal. \nBENNETT The other side? \nJIMMY El Presidente Nazerbayev's best pal in the whole world. \nDANNY D. It's a beautiful field. Goddamn, is it a beautiful field. Danny hands a clean, checked rifle to Bennett. \nDANNY D. (CONT'D) I guarantee we'll let the air out of some tomorrow. \n69 EXT. 777 RANCH - HONDO, TEXAS - DAY 69 \nA herd of zebra trots across a field and distant GUNSHOTS crack through the pine forest. This is a private game preserve, 10,000 acres of \"conservation.\" A large sign shows a buck in cross-hairs and `777 Ranch - Experience Wildlife from Four Continents in Texas.\" \nDANNY D. (O.S.) I believe in getting inside their personal space. So it's you and him and nothing else. That's eighteen yards for a tiger or rhino... Bennett and Jimmy ride in the back of a \"wagon,\" a modified shooting platform pulled behind a Jeep. \n73 INT. TAXI - BEIRUT - DAY 73 \nBob rides in a taxi through the streets of Beirut, a city that was once the Paris of the Middle-East: dust, noise, construction cranes, and knock-off designer clothes. \nSUPERTITLE: BEIRUT, LEBANON They turn off the wide airport road into a warren of narrow streets. The cab stops and the driver turns -- \nCABBIE Southern Suburbs. Bob happily waves him on. Streets narrow. People stare. \nBOB How can you tell if you're talking to a Shiite or a Sunni Muslim. \n(BEAT) If you feel like Shee-iteing your pants you know. The driver glances at Bob in the rearview. OUTSIDE a MAN has a gun stuck in his waistband. Another MAN on a roof has a rifle. A paranoid, guarded place. They turn and suddenly a metal gate is across the road. MEN pour out around the car. Flannel shirts, olive drab army shirts, beards, no beards, guns in waistbands. Bob's door is opened and he is yanked from the cab. \nBOB (CONT'D) I'm here to see Said Hashimi. They roughly frisk Bob. \nBOB (CONT'D) Hashimi. Said Hashimi. They take his pen, remove his belt, check his passport: it's Canadian. Bob's picture. The name is SEYMOUR RISEN. They check his license: the name is SEYMOUR RISEN. \n(CONTINUED) \n73 CONTINUED: 73 Bob is pushed into another vehicle. Someone pulls bills from Bob's wallet and flips them to the cabbie. The gate rises. The car pulls away. The gate drops. The cabbie is left standing there holding the bills. \n74 INT. ANTERIOR ROOM - HEZBOLLAH COMPLEX - DAY 74 \n1970's Arab architecture. Large room. Wide doorway. Wide hallway. Wide stairs. No direct sunlight or sight-lines. LOCAL FARMERS, WORKERS wait. Flannel crosses to Olive Drab. Both have guns in their waistbands. They talk quietly, then laugh. Bob sits on a low couch. Opaque glass separates two rooms and shadows move behind it. SOMEONE offers Bob hot tea. A door opens and a man signals for Bob, who gets up, holding his pants. \n75 INT. HASHIMI'S ROOM - DAY 75 \nDim light. An air-conditioner hums in the wall. SAID HOSSEIN HASHIMI, 80's, Tolstoyan grey beard, turban, rheumy eyes, the spiritual leader of the Hezbollah, sits in a high-back chair in a corner. Bob sits in a high-back chair near Hashimi. The young men revere Hashimi and guard him carefully. \nSAID HASHIMI I have a good feeling about American people, Bob. A good people. A welcoming people. There are ten million Muslims in the U.S. I have over 300,000 followers in Detroit alone. \nBOB Thank you for this audience. I have a business proposal for Mussawi. One that benefits everyone. Hashimi nods magisterially. \nSAID HASHIMI Mussawi is an energetic young man. \n(BEAT) Your Arabic is very good. \n(CONTINUED) \n75 CONTINUED: 75 The power CUTS OUT. The air-conditioner SLOWLY DIES OUT. It's near dark in the room. The guards move nervously toward Bob and Said Hashimi. \nBOB I thought it would also be prudent to say, I have no interest in Hezbollah. This is business and it doesn't concern Hezbollah. In the distance a dog barks and chickens cluck. After a beat, Hashimi turns his rheumy eyes on Bob. \nHASHIMI If what you say is true, consider yourself welcome in Lebanon. The generator comes on with a distant WHIR. The lights come on. A man crosses to the air-conditioner, reaches up and trips the circuit breaker, bringing it back to life. \nCUT TO: \n76 INT. GROTTO - BEIRUT - DAY 76 \nAn ancient grotto where the early Christians used to hide, be discovered, and executed. A tourist attraction, it's a cool, vast, dimly lit, subterranean space. Bob reads a description of a stalactite formation. He is alone, waiting for someone. The grotto ECHOES. In the distance, TWO ARAB SCHOOL CHILDREN, playing with the echoes, do a little dance step and rap out, in broken English, a well-known American SONG. \nMUSSAWI I gotta ask you one question. Amin Shehab... car accident? Bob turns to look at MUSSAWI, 30's, closely-shaved bullet head, seemingly good-natured, a businessman, he speaks English with a New Jersey accent. \nBOB Yeah, sure. Only one of them was propelled by gas and the other by \nC-4. \nMUSSAWI The papers said heart attack. Bob nods pleasantly. \n(CONTINUED) \n76 CONTINUED: 76 \nBOB He saw an engine coming at him at 27,000 feet per second and his heart stopped. This settles a beat. \nMUSSAWI Rumors of Bob, but never Bob. It is Bob, right? What is it you tell people you do these days, Bob? \nBOB I'm between State Department and Defense. Bob surreptitiously looks around to see if Mussawi is alone. It's clear Bob makes him nervous as well. \nMUSSAWI Just me, buddy, as requested. Bob reaches inside his jacket. Mussawi reaches in his. \nBOB I'm getting some information, Jimmy. \nMUSSAWI My name is Mussawi. Bob hands a picture to Mussawi. \nBOB Okay, Jimmy. Mussawi glances down at the picture. It surprises him. ANGLE on the picture of PRINCE NASIR crossing a street. Bob has a small pad on which he scribbles a dollar figure. Mussawi glances at the number. He's impressed. \nMUSSAWI He's traveling to Beirut. It's dangerous to travel. He'll disappear. \nNASIR Phase three. \nBRYAN \n(CALCULATING) Twenty-seven, twenty-eight million cubic meters per day. We'll be in the stream for what, ten one hundredths of a cent, which is, roughly... Seventy-five million dollars. Nasir nods. \n(CONTINUED) \n82 CONTINUED: 82 \nBRYAN (CONT'D) Great. That's great. Seventy-five million dollars... \n(BEAT) How much for my other kid? Prince Nasir stares at Bryan. \nBRYAN (CONT'D) If I were your economic advisor I'd tell you it's not the dumbest thing you've ever done, but it'll probably be the dumbest thing you do today. Probably. \n(BEAT) But why would you need an economic advisor? Twenty years ago you had the highest GNP in the world and now you're tied with Paraguay. Your second biggest export is second-hand goods. Followed by dates on which you lose five cents a pound. \n(BEAT) You want to know what the business world thinks of you. They think a hundred years ago you were chopping each other's heads off in the desert and that's exactly where you'll be in another hundred. So, yes, on behalf of my firm, I accept your money... \nNASIR Okay, fine. I'll have the money forwarded to your firm immediately. \n(BEAT) And I'll give you another hundred million for the other kid. They look at each other. \nNASIR (CONT'D) OK. So now that you're my economic advisor; tell me something I haven't heard. Bryan stares a beat, thinking. \nBRYAN Okay. You want an idea, here's an idea. \n(CONTINUED) \n82 CONTINUED: (2) 82 He draws in the sand: he draws Nasir's kingdom, the Persian Gulf, Iran. Turkey. And Europe. \nBRYAN (CONT'D) Your kingdom is here. The North Field is here. Europe is here. Because of trade restrictions and outdated alliances, you've been selling your gas for peanuts, loading it on ships, and waving as it sails away. (re: the stick) But, pretend for a second this is excess Iranian pipeline capacity. He lays the stick across the circles in the sand like an overland pipe running to Europe. \nBRYAN (CONT'D) Here is your route. Overland. Through Iran. You commoditize it, you control it, you take it right to the front door of every home in Europe. Your profit just went up by a factor of three, possibly four. I think that's a pretty good idea. Overhead the falcons spiral higher and higher, chasing. each other in the sky. The rising MURMUR of AMENS -- \nCUT TO: \n83 INT. SUBURBAN MEGA CHURCH - DAY 83 \nA cavernous mega church, a religious Wal-Mart with 8500 worshippers in stadium seating. REVERAND STEWART, 30's, intelligent and sincere, wears a headset -- \nREVERAND STEWART And when Jesus had been Baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, \"This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.\" Let us pray: 0 God, open our hearts to your word and open your word to our hearts. Amen. AMENS. Danny Dalton, his WIFE and CHILDREN sit in good seats up front. Danny has a flag pin on his lapel. \n(CONTINUED) \n83 CONTINUED: 83 \nREVERAND STEWART (CONT'D) This is the third in our four week series on Luke 2:52. And Jesus continued to grow in wisdom, stature, and in the love of God and those who knew him. The task is NOT getting more of God, but letting God get MORE of us. High above the pulpit, dead center of the auditorium is a giant American flag waving under the cross. Slowly the MURMURING RISE of different PRAYERS. \nCUT TO: \n84 INT. MOSQUE - PERSIAN GULF - DAY 84 \nA long narrow mosque packed with men kneeling shoulder to shoulder CHANTING PRAYERS. Most of them are under thirty. Their movements are unified and ecstatic. \nTHE CLERIC (V.0.) They will try to disguise the difference, to make Muslims who speak about religion appear to be fanatics or backward people. \n85 INT. MADRASSA - DAY 85 \nBoys study at small desks. Boys chanting. Boys lined up. Even smaller boys at smaller desks. \n86 INT. SMALL ROOM - MADRASSA - DAY 86 \nA circle of TEENAGERS, round-shouldered, melancholy, including Farooq and Wasim, sit at a table eating lamb and french fries. \nTHE CLERIC (V.0.) They will tell us the dispute is over economic resources or military domination and if we believe that we play right into their hands, with only ourselves to blame. There is a remarkable contrast between the setting at the government barracks (sterile, poor) and the Mosque (warm, rich). The teenagers wear serious expressions and try/fail to be respectful as they gorge. \n(CONTINUED) \n86 CONTINUED: 86 \nTHE CLERIC (CONT'D) No. The divide between human nature and modern life cannot be bridged by free trade. No. It cannot be cured with deregulation, privatization, openness or lower taxes. No. THE CLERIC, 40, is a serene man whose beard and glasses make him appear older than his age. Wasim watches as he talks in hypnotic cadence, making eye contact with each boy in turn. \nTHE CLERIC (CONT'D) The pain of living in the modern world will never be solved by a liberal society. The Cleric's sympathetic gaze falls on Wasim who is bruised with black eyes from his beating. \nTHE CLERIC (CONT'D) Liberal societies have failed. Christian theology has failed. The West has failed. He serves more lamb and vegetables to Wasim's plate. Wasim begins hungrily eating again. \nPRINCE NASIR Don't see many Occidentals these days. Bob doesn't say anything. \nPRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) It's too bad. Bob nods again. As the elevator moves higher more light floods in through the wire mesh. Bob's eyes meet Nasir's. \n93 EXT. ROOFTOP GARDEN - ALBERGO - DAY 93 \nPrince Nasir, Bryan, and bodyguards sit with a larger party across the rooftop garden. Bob sits by himself eating a sandwich. From below there is the distant THUMPING of a car stereo. A little bird dances along the railing watching for crumbs. All of Beirut is spread out below. PUSH past the bird over the railing where seven floors below a Toyota Land Cruiser pulls around the hotel. \n94 INT. ALBERGO LOBBY - DAY 94 \nAn EMPLOYEE approaches another EMPLOYEE at the desk and furtively pulls her away. ANGLE THROUGH A DOOR to the front of the hotel, which is now completely empty, except for the Toyota Land Cruiser with dark tinted windows and five antennae. The stereo is thumping some odd AMERICAN SONG. \n95 EXT. ROOFTOP GARDEN - DAY 95 \nBob puts down bills for his check. The waiter is nowhere to be seen. There's no one behind the bar. No one at the waiter's station. Bob glances over at Prince Nasir who is laughing at something in the Wall Street Journal. \n96 INT. ALBERGO LOBBY - DAY 96 \nShots of the empty lobby, someone DINGING the bell. Everyone has disappeared. \n97 INT. ALBERGO HALLWAY - DAY 97 \nBob outside his hotel room door. The hallway is empty. \n98 INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 98 \nBob enters his room, chaining the door. He turns and THREE MEN with guns are standing there. He's slammed against the door. Duct tape around his mouth, his arms taped back, his legs wrapped. A black duffel bag goes over him, swallowing the light. \n99 EXT. LAND CRUISER - DAY 99 \nThe duffle is heaved into the back of the Land Cruiser with a THUD. The trunk gate is slammed -- \nMATCH CUT TO: \n100 EXT. SMALL WAREHOUSE - DAY 100 \nThe doors of a UPS truck open. Boxes loaded on a dolly. Follow the dolly into -- \n101 INT. SMALL WAREHOUSE - DAY 101 \nA small warehouse. Roll past a few desks, some lamps. The dolly stops. Tilt up to find -- Bennett finishing a file and starting another. And beyond, a DOZEN PARALEGALS and the mountain of boxes holding 1.3 million pages of documents. Bennett's phone VIBRATES loudly. He checks the number. \n102 INT. BAR - DAY 102 \nTight on a hand written \"business\" card that says, \"If you find me, call my son, Bennett Jr., at this number.\" Bennett takes the card from a bartender and finds his father slumped in the corner of a seedy bar. \nCUT TO: \n103 INT. BARE BULB APARTMENT - DAY 103 \nA rundown kitchen. The windows are sealed. In another room three MEN eat lunch, sharing a two liter bottle of Mecca Cola, gossiping in Arabic. \n(CONTINUED) \n103 CONTINUED: 103 On a wooden table is a generator, a homemade shocking device the size of masonry brick with a long wire to the generator, and a thick pair of rubber gloves. Bob is duct-taped tightly to a chair. His face is battered. His mouth is cracked. He's severely dehydrated. His hands and feet are dark purple and swollen. A door opens. FOOTSTEPS. Mussawi's VOICE -- \nMUSSAWI (O.S.) Bob, what do you know about torture methods used by the Chinese on the Falun Gong? Number one method? What's your guess? Water dungeon? Did-you guess water dungeon? Impractical here. Bob's POV of Mussawi crossing to the generator. He uses the hand crank, which makes a grinding SOUND. \nMUSSAWI (CONT'D) Number two method? Number two: twisting arm, putting face in feces. Not interested in two. Number three? Number three they call pulling nails from fingers. What do you think, Bob? Does Number three sound good to you? He lets go of the generator and picks up an evil-looking pair of pliers the size of bolt-cutters. Bob's POV over his own hands as Mussawi approaches. \nMUSSAWI (CONT'D) The purpose is to get them to recant their beliefs. Mussawi circles behind Bob who tries to speak but his throat is too dry. Other MEN hold the chair steady. \nMUSSAWI (CONT'D) What if I had to get you to' recant? That would be difficult, right? Because if you have no beliefs to recant, then what? Bob wiggles his hands as if they could escape. SOMEONE mashes Bob's right hand flat, splaying the fingers. \nMUSSAWI (CONT'D) You're fucked is what. The pliers fix on the nail of his pinkie. \n(CONTINUED) \n103 CONTINUED: ( 2) 103 \nMUSSAWI (CONT'D) Bob, you're gonna give me the name of every person who has taken money from you. Bob stares at him. Says nothing. Slowly Mussawi pulls with the pliers. Bob's eyes half- close. Mussawi jerks away. There's a fingernail in the pliers. Mussawi retches. \nMUSSAWI (CONT'D) Ugh. That's disgusting. Bob is dazed. They throw water in his face. \nMUSSAWI (CONT'D) Come on, Bob. Help me out here. As water drips down Bob's face he holds his tongue out and drinks. His voice returns. \nBOB \n112 EXT. THE SONG OF ROLAND - NIGHT 112 \nThe fantail of Prince Meshal's yacht, SONG OF ROLAND, one of many beautiful boats, anchored off Juan Les Pins. A dinner party in progress. The tinkle of crystal and music. Candles flicker. Glowing people. \n113 INT. PRIVATE SALON - NIGHT 113 \nCognac swirls. A gold cigar cutter slices off the tip. Dean Whiting, Meshal, and REZA BARHANI, a middle-man, light expensive cigars in a book-lined study on the boat. \nREZA BARHANI Capitalism cannot exist without waste. On the walls pictures of Meshal as a child with Reagan, Qaddafi. As a teenager with Clinton, King Fahd, Mitterrand, Chernomyrdin. \n(CONTINUED) \n113 CONTINUED: 113 \nREZA BARHANI (CONT'D) We should write thank you notes to Mr. Whiting and. the USA for producing one quarter of the world's garbage and one quarter of the demand. \nWHITING You're certainly welcome. Ha, ha. Our pleasure, really. Bonhomie galore. But Meshal is either wary or stupid or both. Reza points to a glass case where a huge leather- bound book is displayed. \nREZA BARHANI Prince, that is a rare treasure. \n(TO WHITING) The First Arab edition of Dr. Johnson's dictionary. Meshal stares. It's his, but means nothing to him. \nWHITING Prince, is there anything we can do for you? The Prince thinks about this for a beat. \nPRINCE MESHAL Americans are very happy to drill holes in other people's countries. \n(TO WHITING) I've heard of you. The cat's paw of the Saudi Princes. Whiting and Reza exchange a quick glance, but this is what Dean Whiting lives for. \nWHITING I know your brother, the foreign minister. Very bright. I know your father, too. He threw the second creepiest party I've ever been to in Washington. And from what I can tell you could probably use a bit of a cat's paw yourself. Second born son so beaten down by his family he can't even tell me what he wants when he's asked straight out, a grown-up baby who hates his brother and maybe wants to be king, maybe. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n113 CONTINUED: ( 2) 113 \nWHITING (CONT'D) Well, Prince, are you a king? Can you tell me what you want? The Prince is at first taken aback, but then takes a beat to consider the offer. Whiting and the Middle-man wait. \nPRINCE MESHAL I do have one small dream, a selfless dream. At my house I have a perfect one-third replica of Hyde Park. I have ducks and deck chairs from the real Hyde Park. \n(BEAT) I wish for a monument to the success of the moors in Europe in the 8th century. \nREZA BARHANI That already exists. It is called the Alhambra. \nPRINCE MESHAL A replica in my country to inspire the people and a new Cordoba Valley from which to view it. It took the masters a hundred years, but I believe we can do it in ten. \n(BEAT) By the way, do you know that my brother does not believe in God? Whiting sips his cognac and, considering the Prince, does indeed look like a cat digesting a canary. \nCUT TO: \n114 EXT. MADRASSA CORNFIELD - DAY 114 \nWind ripples across the leaves of corn. Wasim's hand pulls weed grass. Farooq smiles mischievously. \n115 EXT. MADRASSA \"YARD\" - DAY 115 \nWasim, Farooq play soccer. Farooq is a natural athlete. \nWASIM The spider is a symbol of the sin of man. He bites the finger of Peter Parker who is now half dark and half light. \n(CONTINUED) \n115 CONTINUED: 115 \nFAROOQ A real spider captures, then stings and immobilizes, then watches as the prey takes days to die. \nWASIM They'd never show that. Suddenly they stop. MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA, the blue-eyed Egyptian, has been watching them. They are embarrassed. \nFAROOQ Are we in trouble? MSA smiles a patient, charismatic, spooky smile. They already know each other. \nMOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA Look around you at your family... In an OPEN AIR CLASSROOM the Cleric leads young children in recitation of the Koran. Boys walk to class. Boys plow a field. \nMOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA (CONT'D) Look around you at your brothers united by faith in God Almighty and submission to his law. A bull sleeps in the shade. \nFAROOQ Wasim is still a virgin. Wasim lightly shoves Farooq. \nMOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA That is good because fornication is a serious crime. \nCIA SECURITY OFFICER We'll need you to turn your passport over to us. \n(CONTINUED) \n118 CONTINUED: 118 \nCIA SECURITY OFFICER #2 Passports. \n119 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WALTER REED - DAY 119 \nBob in his bed. He stares out the window at a red brick wall, a fragment of sky. He sees MARGARET in the doorway. \nMARGARET In their helpful way they told me you were at one of six places but since you were a number and not a name did I happen to have that number. No. No is the answer to whether I have your number. She rests her hand on the railing of the bed. On the verge, she looks away, then back again. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) They wouldn't give me any information. I didn't know how to find you, what I'd find... He pulls her close, careful of his bandaged hands. \nBOB I'm okay. I'm fine. Hey -- \nMARGARET (into his chest) They wouldn't tell me a thing. Not one thing. He holds her. As she becomes aware of the bandages on his hands, as her worry has been abating, anger has ineluctably filled in behind. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Where were you, Bob? He looks at her; he can't tell her the truth. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Were you back in Beirut? He just stares. This is infuriating. \nMARGARET (CONT'D) Bob, please tell me where you were and tell me what happened. Please. Bob motions for her to come closer. \n(CONTINUED) \n119 CONTINUED: 119 \nBOB I saw these Shiites selling an Egyptian a missile. In Iran. I had a feeling about this guy, a Sunni nut-job, but I'm back here where I got on the wrong side of Terry, then an opportunity just happened to come up involving someone I worked with before, not a radical, I mean, he went to Rutgers, only now he flips, wants to cut my goddamn head off. And now they got me isolated away in here and they send these suits around asking me nonsense questions about bad people who are no longer with us, no longer with us on their goddamn orders. So you tell me what happened. You tell me, Margaret. Margaret doesn't know what to say so she says nothing. \nCUT'TO: \n120 INT./EXT. GENEVA - DAY 120 \nArabs strolling along the street. Nasir and hisfamily shop in an expensive jewelry store. \n121 INT. HOTEL PRESIDENT WILSON - DAY 121 \nArabs stare out windows at the rain. Doors are open. People mingle. Smoke is in the air. A young WOMAN walks by, holding the hand of a much older MAN, laughing at something he's saying. \n122 INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 122 \nBryan plays Monopoly with a group of young Arab MEN. They are using real money. The \"bank\" is stacks of hundreds and fifties and twenties. They smoke and drink. An Arab youth moves the silver top hat. \nARAB YOUTH Shit. Park Place. Shit -- Park Place with hotels. Bryan holds Park Place. The Arab Youth takes off his diamond encrusted Rolex and tosses it toward the bank. \nARAB YOUTH (CONT'D) Where are you from in the States? \n(CONTINUED) \n122 CONTINUED: 122 \nBRYAN El Segundo. No one has heard of it. \nBRYAN (CONT'D) It's near Los Angeles. \nARAB YOUTH Movie stars, convertibles? \nBRYAN El Segundo is like Saudi Arabia with a surf break. They hoot and protest. They don't believe him. \nBRYAN (CONT'D) It's a desert town on an ocean controlled by an oil company. Tankers lined up offshore. There's this smell in the air. They pass out flyers to families moving in. This town is a quiet town where everyone works and our families are happy. If you have a problem with it or if you don't like the smell, you can leave. \nARAB YOUTH If anyone works, it can't be Saudi Arabia. They all LAUGH LOUDLY, then the laughter fades as they realize Julie and Riley are in the hotel room. Julie eyes the money and the Asian girl in the corner. \nJULIE He wanted to say good night to his father. Riley goes over and stiffly gives Bryan a hug. \nCUT TO: \n123 INT. VENDING AREA - CIA - DAY 123 \nA vending machine HISSES filling a cup. Bob presses the extra dark button, bandages on the tips of his fingers. Bob looks over and sees people staring. They look away. \n124 INT. DIVISION CHIEF ANTEROOM - CIA - DAY 124 \nBob stands in front of an ASSISTANT'S desk. \n129 CONTINUED: 129 \nHOTEL SECURITY GUARD You're not on the list. You don't have a badge and you don't have a wristband. Bennett looks at the three guards. He pulls out a card and scribbles ONE WORD on the back. \nBENNETT Take this to Sydney Hewitt. Now. \n(BEAT) Please. INSIDE THE ROOM the guard makes his way to Sydney Hewitt and hands him the card. \nSECRETARY OF DEFENSE Their hopes are the same as all people in every land: to lead lives of dignity in a nation at peace. And America will help them. APPLAUSE as Sydney looks up sharply. At the head table: Dean Crutcher, Reza, and Tommy clap along heartily. \nMATCH CUT TO: \n130 INT. CONNEX BOARDROOM - DAY 130 \nTommy, his PERSONAL LAWYER at his ear, -- \nTOMMY Not to my recollection -- Bennett and Sydney square off against Tommy, Jimmy, their personal lawyers, one apiece. \nBENNETT Killeen Oil through Daniel Dalton and PetroKa Energy Consultants created assetless shell companies owned by the heirs of President Nazerbayev. This was. discussed... (checks his notes) At the Upstream Division Meeting held in January of 2003 in Sun Valley, Idaho? \nTOMMY I was at the meeting, but I don't focus on those kinds of details. \n(CONTINUED) \n130 CONTINUED: 130 \nBENNETT Wherein it was described that Killeen bore all financial risk, but President Nazerbayev's children, while attending The Lily School in Switzerland, were entitled to all of the profits - seventy million dollars. Tommy's personal lawyer leans in and whispers in his ear. \nTOMMY I attended the meeting but, as I said, I don't focus on those kinds of details. \nBENNETT Daniel Dalton Jr. and PetroKa Energy Consultants -- \nTOMMY'S LAWYER A firm retained by Killeen well prior to Connex's involvement -- \nJIMMY Oh, fer Chrissakes, Tommy, we both got letters from the Grand Jury, it's not your own private little pity party -- \nBENNETT A good faith purchaser is in good faith only if they didn't know about the problems at the time of the purchase -- \nTOMMY This is the oil business we're talking about, right? \nJIMMY The lowliest little shareholder knows we deal with some of the most stank places on earth -- \nBENNETT It is illegal to offer gifts, money or the promise of money or anything of value to influence foreign officials -- \n(CONTINUED) \n130 CONTINUED: ( 2) 130 \nJIMMY Oh, is it? I have personally seen a bill from this law firm to the government of Saudi Arabia for 36 million dollars. A one line bill for services rendered. \nBENNETT The business of Whiting, Sloan is not under discussion at this time. \nJIMMY Well, it oughta be. Danny's a good man. He's a friend of mine. \nCUT TO: \n131 EXT. LAKE FRONT - GENEVA - DAY 131 \nThe ARAB YOUTH exits the hotel and runs across the wide waterfront square. He cuts for a lone figure sitting on wall. He runs up to Bryan. \nARAB YOUTH They've sued the Emir on the Isle of Jersey and frozen his money. He was in Bulgari and his credit card stopped working. \n132 INT. NASIR'S SUITE - DAY 132 \nPrince Nasir tosses a newspaper at Bryan -- \nPRINCE NASIR Some people, cousins of mine actually, sued my father in The Commonwealth alleging that he broke agreements to repay funds transferred from the State. Bryan follows Nasir. He glances at a photo of AGGRIEVED ARABS leaving court with DEAN WHITING looking protective. \nBRYAN A Mareva injunction? \nPRINCE NASIR Aggrieved Royals. Aggrieved about what? That he tried to cut their allowances from one hundred thousand a month to eighty. They pass wife, children, hangers-on. Room after room. \n(CONTINUED) \n132 CONTINUED: 132 \nPRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) There are 300 years of corrupt layers in the middle-east and you have to break the ice. There must be structural changes. I tell them, with just one of your boats you could revolutionize Yemen, build desalinization plants. The man with the 200 foot boat needs a 250 foot boat. The man with 250. now needs 300. They dead-end in a small office. The Emir's JAPANESE SECRETARY half-rises. \nSTAN Questions two and three seem obvious to me. Missiles are everywhere. Christ, Casey gave 'em out like party favors. This damage assessment, well, let's just say Nasir wasn't a home run. They're worried. About fall-out. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n138 CONTINUED: 138 \nSTAN (CONT'D) They're worried you may want to talk about it. But if you're already under investigation? \nBOB What about Mussawi? \nSTAN Mussawi's a soldier. He's just like you. Bob stares at Stan who continues. \nSTAN (CONT'D) Maybe he found God. Maybe he was having a bad day. Maybe Americans shouldn't travel these days. \nBOB Did Prince Nasir hide Mohammed Sheik Agiza in the Water Ministry? Does he fund terrorist organizations? \nSTAN Tell people what they want to hear and they have a better chance of believing you. People were paid to lie, coached on their polygraphs. Single sources spread through different intelligence agencies that don't communicate with each other. You know how it's done. \nBOB Who's worried about the Nasir job? Stan, who's worried about me talking? On the screen: a LOUD, ACTION BEAT. Stan leans over and \nWHISPERS -- \nCUT TO: \n139 EXT. ENERGY DEPARTMENT - DAY 139 \nHulking structures in concrete like Albert Speer's vision of heaven as Danny D. rants at Bennett -- \n(CONTINUED) \n139 CONTINUED: 139 \nDANNY D. Some trust fund prosecutor, got off-message at Brown, thinks he's gonna run this up the flag pole, make a name for himself, maybe get elected some two-bit, no-name congressman from nowhere, with the result that Russia or China can suddenly start having, at our expense, all the advantages we enjoy here. No, I tell you. No. \n(MINCING) But, Danny, these are sovereign nations... Sovereign nations! What is a sovereign nation, but a collective of greed run by one individual. But, Danny, they're codified by the U.N. charter. Legitimized gangsterism on a global basis that has no more validity than an agreement between the Crips and the Bloods! Passing people shoot sidelong glances. A GROUP of men in suits are clearly waiting for Danny D. \nDANNY D. (CONT'D) Corruption charges. Corruption? Corruption ain't nothing more than government intrusion into market efficiencies in the form of regulation. That's Milton Friedman. He got a goddamn Nobel prize. We have laws against it precisely so we can get away with it. Corruption is our protection. Corruption is what keeps us safe and warm. Corruption is why you and I are here in the white-hot center of things instead of fighting each other for scraps of meat out there in the streets. \n(BEAT) Corruption... is how we win. Danny D. winds down. Finally -- \nBENNETT You broke the law, Mr. Dalton. \nDANNY D. Oh, who gives a shit! \n(CONTINUED) \n139 CONTINUED: (2) 139 \nBENNETT You have 37 million dollars hidden away and the only question I can see of any relevance is whether you'll get to keep any of it. The two men are tiny against the architecture, the nation's capitol going on with it's day around them. \n140 EXT. CAPITOL HILL -- WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY 140 \nSydney approaches Bennett who eats his lunch outside the law offices of whiting and Sloan. \nSYDNEY How'd it go? Think you'll get invited on any more hunting trips? \nBENNETT He has kids. He's got a wife. \nSYDNEY He broke the law. Sydney holds out a golden envelope to Bennett. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) Mr. Janus himself wanted me to extend an invitation to oilman of the Year. He's being honored so it should be a nice weekend. Relax. Get a massage. Congratulations. Perhaps the slightest flicker of distaste crosses Bennett's face. On the reverse the Capitol Building is so close you could reach out and touch it. \nCUT TO: \n141 INT. EMIR'S SUITE - GENEVA - DAY 141 \nA vast hotel suite, SILENT until the Emir's electric wheelchair rolls into sight. He rolls across marble, through rooms, until he approaches Prince Nasir and Prince Meshal. A long beat before the Emir speaks in Arabic. \nEMIR I am tired. \nPRINCE NASIR \nFATHER -- \n(CONTINUED) \n(INTO PHONE) Everything's fine. \n146 INT. DOWNSTAIRS STUDY - NIGHT 146 \nWhiting's study, unlike the standard, upper-crust, decorating of the rest of the home, has a specific Middle- Eastern flair. Persian antiques. Pictures of Whiting on a camel, with Persian friends at oxford in the sixties. Whiting is an Arabist. The motion sensor light is on. Whiting tries a window. \nALARM COMPANY How're we doing, Mr. Why-Teeng? It's secure. He tries another one. It's secure. \nWHITING \n(INTO PHONE) Everything's fine. There's a sliding glass door that leads to a patio and pool. Whiting tries it and it slides open. \nWHITING (CONT'D) \n(INTO PHONE) The sliding door is unlocked. He turns slowly. The room looks different. There is an alcove with a wet-bar and walk-in closets. \nALARM COMPANY Did you leave it unlocked? \nWHITING Send a car, you imbecile. He looks at the alcove and closet. Just then, the desk phone RINGS, startling him. The phone rings and rings. on the wall behind Whiting's head are beautifully framed photos with Kissinger, Clinton, King Fahd. Rack focus off Whiting and slowly ZOOM to... \nAN OLD PHOTO \n(CONTINUED) \n146 CONTINUED: 146 Of Dean Whiting and the old EMIR, NASIR'S FATHER. \nWHITING (CONT'D) \n(FINALLY ANSWERING) Hello. \n147 INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT 147 \nIt's early morning. A couple of drunks at the counter. Bob is at a booth with a mug of coffee. Dean Whiting appears outside the window, enters the restaurant, sits. \nBOB You were in Beirut in '84. \nWHITING I lost friends there as I'm sure you did. \n(BEAT) I got a peek at your file. You're a good man, one whose experience is narrow and deep. Your entire career you've been used and probably never even known what for. \nBOB I didn't used to need to know. A Grand Slam Breakfast is set in front of Bob. \nWHITING In this town, you're innocent until you're investigated. Bob looks up and squints at the waitress' name-tag. \nBOB Bacon looks perfect, Deborah. Bob puts syrup on the pancakes. Eats a piece of bacon. \nBOB (CONT'D) Innocent until investigated. That's nice. It has a nice ring to it. I bet you've worn some miles on little sayings like that. Very wise, gives the listener the sense of law being written as it's spoken. \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n147 CONTINUED: 147 \nBOB (CONT'D) If anything happens to me or my family, an accident, an accusation, anything, then first your son will disappear, his body will never be found. Then your wife. Her body will never be found either. This is guaranteed. Then, whatever is the most dangerous thing you do in your life, it might be flying in a small plane, it might be walking to the bank, you will be killed. \n(BEAT) Do you understand what I'm saying? I want you to acknowledge that you do understand so that we're clear and there won't be any mistakes. After a beat, Whiting nods. \nWHITING Beirut rules, Mr. Baer? Whiting loves the game. Bob looks tired, maybe a little sad. \nBOB I've made decisions that resulted in deaths, but I never lost a nights sleep. Never. I killed people, but I always had about 500 pages of U.S. law behind me, law that I believed in, and that was good enough. \nWHITING You still do, Mr. Baer. You still do. Bob stares at him. \nBOB I want my passports back. \nCUT TO: \n148 EXT. D.C. - DAY 148 \nTight on Bennett as he runs through a downtrodden neighborhood. Sweat dripping, breathing heavily, he runs faster and faster. People on stoops watch him go. He's oblivious to the UNMARKED CAR following him. Finally the car races up beside him. The window rolls down and Donald Parish III's face appears. \n(CONTINUED) \n148 CONTINUED: 148 \nJIMMY POPE We use one quarter of the oil in the world, Bennett. Your house is light and warm and my house is light and warm, but what if it was that way half the week, or none of the week. Hell, China's economy ain't growing as fast as it could because they can't get all the oil they need. I'm damn proud of that fact. Bennett gives him nothing. A beat. \nJIMMY POPE (CONT'D) What if it involved someone at your firm? Someone way the hell above you. We'd have to have an understanding. \nBENNETT If he's as big as you say then when he goes down the merger will be approved. Despite himself, Jimmy is impressed -- \nJIMMY POPE Just like that. \nBENNETT We're looking for the illusion of due-diligence. Two criminal acts successfully prosecuted gives us that illusion. Jimmy hands Bennett a plate of ribs and smiles. \nJIMMY POPE Call me Jimmy. \nCUT TO: \n152 INT. SHED - DAY 152 \nON TELEVISION: grainy video of a suicide bomber's videotaped \"will.\" THE BOMBER, 19, stands in a field of dry rubble and flowers, is both nervous and confident, a backpack anything but innocuous at his feet. \nSUICIDE BOMBER (ON VIDEO) I wish for everyone who hears this to fear God and to follow God and his prophets. When I die I want the people who inherit my possessions to do the following: A group of twenty or thirty BOYS, including Wasim and Farooq, watch the video in a makeshift shed. \nSUICIDE BOMBER (VIDEO) (CONT'D) One: the people who prepare my body should be good Muslims so this will remind me of God and his forgiveness. Two: I don't want anyone to rip their clothes or slap their faces because this is an ignorant thing to do. Mohammed Sheik Agiza watches the boys watch the video. \nMOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA His influence on those left behind grows. There is no sense of loss, since he continues to live and inspire, his fame spreading. Wasim impassively stares at the video. \nSUICIDE BOMBER Three: I don't want a pregnant woman to come and say good bye to me because I don't approve it. \n153 EXT. THE BEES - DAY 153 \nGolden honey flares in sunlight dripping off a comb into a collection jug. Wasim replaces the comb into a hive. In a line of square wooden hives, Farooq removes a comb and begins draining the honey. Wasim pulls out another comb. \nWASIM \nOW -- \n(CONTINUED) \n153 CONTINUED: 153 Wasim looks down. A bee is on his arm. He brushes it off. Wasim and Farooq look at the bee on the ground as it drags'itself around in a circle. \nWASIM (CONT'D) \n(SOFTLY) If I truly lack faith, then I am not the right person. He looks to Farooq who seems very young at this moment. \nFAROOQ The questioning means that you have faith and makes it stronger \nWASIM That's a lot of shit, I think.

DESERT - DAY 154 \nPan across the desert to find Nasir staring into space. \nPRINCE NASIR Twenty seven tribes in my country and we all hate each other. My father arrested the malcontents. He crushed the religious zealots. Try reasoning with people who have one foot in the afterlife, he said, as he leveled village after village. Another angle and Bryan is approaching. Behind him is the desert house made mainly of tents and sails. DIGNITARIES wait on the deck and watch Nasir. \n(CONTINUED) \n154 CONTINUED: 154 \nPRINCE You know what place my children love most on earth? My children love Colorado.

BEDOUIN TENT - DAY 155 \nThe tent is crowded with tribal and military leaders. Worried and suspicious, they.sit on rugs and recline against pillows. Nasir enters and takes his seat. \nPRINCE NASIR For centuries Islam has been ruled by people with no respect for law, monopolies handed out for the things that people want, commerce stifled, young people unable to find jobs, critics jailed or put to death, women are second-class \nCITIZENS -- He is interrupted by a BEDOUIN LEADER. \nBEDOUIN LEADER Tomorrow is the coronation. Your brother has the support of the United States. And 10,000 of their troops are stationed in our country. \nPRINCE NASIR This is true. My father is ill and weak and unwilling to fight the Americans. But others are willing. And when a country has five percent of the world's population but does fifty percent of its military spending, then the persuasive powers of that country are on the decline. The crowd is unmoved. Rallying the men will not be easy. \nFRANKS Great. He eats some chips, offers some to another guy. \nFRANKS (CONT'D) Is it night there still? \nWILLY Morning. \nCUT TO: \n164 EXT.

No firm our size has pulled off anything like this. Bryan crosses to the CHINESE OIL EXECUTIVES. \nBRYAN (CONT'D) He's a visionary, like Faisal or Attaturk, and the people love him. By Monday, he'll be running the country. The Chinese seem unconvinced. Finally, the tent opens and the leaders file out. Prince Nasir addresses the crowd. \nPRINCE NASIR The Middle-East and the Arab people have seen empires come and go in six millennia. The Pax Romana, the Pax Ottomanica, the Pax Brittanica, were nothing more than invasions and occupations that ended... The Pax Americana will end, too. His wife and daughters proudly watch. \nPRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) We have endless patience for history, but a man starving to death while sitting on a chair made of gold can no longer afford to be patient. The time for democratic, Arab self- determination has arrived. The crowd CHEERS. And as Prince Nasir, his family and supporters move toward the vehicles, find Nasir's BODYGUARD whispering into a cell phone -- \nBODYGUARD Silver Hummer -- \n(CONTINUED) \n164 CONTINUED: 164 As Nasir and Bryan enter a SILVER HUMMER. \nCUT TO: \n165 EXT.

JANUS (CONT'D) Those number crunchers can get a little over-zealous, can't they, but Christ, when we write the GAAP rules like some kind of abstract painting.

Strategize. Advise. But don't own. Your words. \nSYDNEY You aren't going to hurt me, Bennett. You'll wash out of the private sector. Fact, you're already gone. You'll end up working public defender cases. You'll make 1/50th the money. You could have been on the boards of Fortune Five Hundred companies. You could have been an advisor to Presidents. You could have helped us win like Romans instead of sitting on the sidelines hoping we don't turn into Visigoths. \n(BEAT) You jumped that turnstile, sir, but don't worry, we'll get you off at trial -- Sydney takes the documents out of Bennett's hands. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) \n(CALMING) We expect you kids to try and kill the father. We encourage it. Just maybe not so soon. Sydney senses something and sees DONALD FARISH III and FBI AGENTS have entered the room. Sydney turns back to Bennett, a flash of true venom -- \nSYDNEY (CONT'D)' You ungrateful, pissant, nobody. FBI restrains Sydney. Pat looks up from her needlepoint. \n(CONTINUED) \n177 CONTINUED: 177 \nBENNETT A piece of advice Syd, one attorney to another... Bennett leans close -- \nBENNETT (CONT'D) \n(SOTTO) Get rid of that watch. It makes you look like a nigger. ANGLE - on Sydney's wrist is the Mickey Mouse watch. And then a handcuff is slipped over it and clicked tight. Sydney now appears completely relaxed again. He looks at Donald Farish III and nods -- \nSYDNEY Don. Not the perp walk, Don -- Farish nods as if to acknowledge they're barely out of round one. And they begin leading Sydney out. Across the room, silhouetted by the windows, Mrs. Janus helps Mr. Janus slip on his tux jacket. They see Bennett standing awkwardly in the middle of the room. Pat extends her hand for him to join them. \n178 EXT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE BALCONY - EVENING 178 \nThe three are silhouetted against the skyline. Mr. Janus looks out at the valleys of Manhattan. \nMR. JANUS I'm a straight shooter, Bennett. I think it was Trollope who said the best capitalist is someone who's greedy and honest. We can't forget that second part. \nMRS. JANUS It was Trollope, honey. \nMR. JANUS We're creating a lot of jobs this quarter, Bennett, a lot of jobs. We're building a business and that's what America's all about. \nCUT TO: \n179 INT.

And by an act of our Congress it is illegal to trade with Iran, so we can't be in business with any of those countries, even though they have oil and we sell it. This is our business, Tommy, selling oil, not finding it. Anyone can find it. It's everywhere. Jimmy motions out the window -- \nJIMMY (CONT'D) A monkey can stick a straw in the ground, slurp it out and boil it, right, Thomas?

Bennett notices that Sydney wears a Mickey Mouse watch. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) And WHEN the government approves this merger it's gonna buy a lot of houses out on the Vineyard, maybe even yours, so, of course, it's delicate all around. Who's this U.S. Attorney, Donald Farish the 3rd? What's his agenda? Who's behind him? Is it a political force? Another corporation? Is he a glory boy making a name? \nBENNETT I know him. He taught a class of mine at Georgetown Law. Sydney knew this, of course. Sydney looks Bennett over, then he chuckles, the effect of which is unsettling. \nSYDNEY Well, there you go, he taught a class of yours at Georgetown Law. Mr. .Whiting did say to me, I have a feeling about this young man. He said, he can position himself. Sydney stands. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) Hold these guys in a circle. Ask the careful questions.

Put him up for a promotion. Bob's a good guy. He saved our ass in Beirut in '85. \nFRANKS \n(BEAT) Great. Terry likes him. We'll get him an audition downtown. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_id": 1975, "test3_input": "27 EXT. BELTWAY - DAY 27 \nDIVISION CHIEF (V.0.) You'll get him an audition \nDOWNTOWN -- Bob exits into downtown D.C, the traffic lightening. He goes through a tunnel. \nCUT TO: \n28 INT. DIVISION CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY 28 \nThe idea of promoting Bob gains traction -- \nFRANKS Bob's a hero. They'll give him something good. He is an Iran expert. \nDIVISION CHIEF Fred, Bob's never had a desk job, never done nine-to-five. Can he show up to work everyday? Can he stay on message? \n(CONTINUED) \n28 CONTINUED: 28 \nFRANKS Yes, absolutely. I'll prep him. \nCUT TO: \n29 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY 29 \nBob waits in a hard back chair. It's a spare, functional, highly polished place. Marines like statues stand guard. VOICES come from a partially open door across the hall. \nMARILYN (V.0.) Imagine gasoline ten dollars a gallon at the pump. Or heating oil that costs twenty-five hundred a month for a two-bedroom apartment. If oil goes to a hundred a barrel, the U.S. turns into a third-world country. That is a fact. \nTERRY GEORGE (V.0.) Do you have any analysis to back up that fact? \nSUPERTITLE: WASHINGTON, D.C. \nDISTINGUISHED VOICE (V.0.) In the next fifteen years, The North Sea and Alaska dry up. Two million barrels a day to the U.S. gone. That is a known fact. \n30 INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY 30 \nThe Deputies Meeting. A small room with recessed lighting filled with the rung below the top-tier of Washington bureaucracy. Navy STENO GUYS record the conversation. \nTERRY GEORGE I need data supporting known facts. Because what I know is that in the entire region when we even whisper our support, those people are delegitimized. TERRY GEORGE, 40's, Deputy CIA Chief, quite a good guy to those in power, speaks to a DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN, 60's. Through the partially open door, one third of Bob is visible. \nDISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN Iraq had no established ethnic majority. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n30 CONTINUED: 30 \nDISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN (CONT'D) It's like trying to organize Louisiana. Iran, on the other hand, is Persian -- The Deputy National Security Advisor, MARILYN RICHARDS, 40's, sculpted hair, with the soul of a seventy year-old white, Republican male, is in charge -- \nMARILYN There has been some good news concerning Iran lately. Right, Terry? \nTERRY GEORGE For Iran, yes -- \nMARILYN The President is very interested in Iran, Terry. Marilyn takes in the presence of the DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN sitting near her. Terry slides a file across the table to her. \nTERRY GEORGE I know that, Marilyn. In fact, we just pulled one of our officers out and I took the initiative to ask him to come down here. He infiltrated Hezbollah in Beirut in the eighties, won himself some nice medals. We're thinking about giving him a station. \nMARILYN Beirut in the eighties, is that a resume builder? Polite chuckles follow Terry George to the doorway. \n31 INT. OUTSIDE SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY 31 \nTerry George appears, crooks a finger. As Bob passes -- \nTERRY GEORGE Don't chomp down on any bait. He looms over Bob, pointedly taps Bob's files -- \nTERRY GEORGE (CONT'D) We're fine. Iran is fine. Fine. \n32 INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY 32 \nBob sweats slightly as he plows on, reading from notes. \n(CONTINUED) \n32 CONTINUED: 32 \n", "test3_true": "BOB (CONT'D) And we're reprogramming resources into Iran. Our next review will show that --- \nMARILYN Thank you for coming over, Mr. Baer. Welcome back and forgive me if I wade right in, but forgetting for a second your bureaucratic checklist, I'm trying to get undigested information, so if you could give me a reading of the temperature over there? Bob glances at Terry. Exasperated, Marilyn continues. \nMARILYN (CONT'D) India is now our ally. Russia is our ally. Even China will be an ally. Everybody between Morocco and Pakistan is the problem. Failed states and failed economies, but Iran is a natural cultural ally of the U.S. The Persians do not want to roll back the clock to the 8th century. I see students marching in the streets. I hear Khatami making the right sounds. And what I'd like to know is if we keep embargoing them on energy, then someday soon are we going to get a nice, secular, pro-Western, pro-business government? The steno guys type away. A long beat on Bob. \nBOB It's possible. It's complicated. \nMARILYN Of course it is, Mr. Baer. Thank you for your time. Bob looks to Terry who nods. Bob starts to leave. \n(CONTINUED) \n32 CONTINUED: ( 2) 32 \nMARILYN (CONT'D) (sotto, to the room) Intelligence is the misnomer of the century. Bob stops. He can't help himself -- \nBOB They let young people march in the street and then the next day shut down fifty newspapers. They have a few satellite dishes up on roofs, let 'em have My Two Dads, but that doesn't mean the Ayatollahs have relinquished one iota of control over that nation. The steno guys hands are frozen. \nDISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN Mr. Baer, the reform movement in Iran is one of the President's great hopes for the region and crucial to the petroleum security of the United States. \nTERRY GEORGE \n(A WARNING) These gentlemen are with the CLI. Bob has no idea what this is or whether he should answer. \nDISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN The Committee for the Liberation of Iran, Mr. Baer. \nBOB We've had Iran in embargo for almost thirty years, we backed their neighbor, a neighbor we invaded twice, in a ten year war against them, we're hanging on by a thread with a massive occupation force, so I got news for you... Thomas Jefferson just ain't that popular over there right now. Silence except for the steno guys clicking away, then complete silence. Terry George stares at Bob a long beat. \nTERRY GEORGE That will be all, Mr. Baer. \nCUT TO: \n33 EXT. CAPITOL HILL APARTMENT - MORNING 33 \nBennett exits a cab, walks up the steps with an overnight bag. A MAN, 60's, tough and well-preserved, in a dark suit and tie, waits on the stoop with a folded paper. \nDANNY DALTON (V.0.) I hear phrases thrown around like \"the corrupting influence of money\" or \"the evil influence of dollars in politics,\" when more money was spent on the syndication rights to Seinfeld than on the whole of the last presidential election. Bennett just walks past him to open the door. \n34 INT. BENNETT'S APARTMENT - MORNING 34 \nA nice three bedroom that is part of the quiet gentrification movement not yet reflected in the streets. Cable news plays silently in the living room. There's a goldfish in a small aquarium. Through a door, Bennett and the man are in the kitchen. \n35 INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 35 \nA SMALL TV: plays C-Span testimony on Campaign Finance Reform. DANNY DALTON, 40's, an \"oilman,\" testifies. \nDANNY DALTON Last election cycle I spent three hundred thousand. I got pictures of myself with the President that I use all over the world. People don't know Danny Dalton, but they know the President of the United States and they see that I know the President of the United States... Bennett has showered and changed. He makes coffee. The man sits at a dinette. He lights a cigarette. \nBENNETT I'm not making this coffee for you. I'm making it for me. You I'm making oatmeal and then you sleep. \nBENNETT SENIOR You look like shit. \n(CONTINUED) \n35 CONTINUED: 35 Bennett just stares for a moment. Bennett takes the oatmeal off the stove, sets a bowl in front of the man whose fingernails are black, whose dark suit is filthy. \nBENNETT Are you working? \nBENNETT SENIOR I had a little trouble at work. Bennett grabs his travel coffee and starts away -- \nBENNETT There's some beer in the fridge for after you wake up, so you don't die on my floor of the DT's. And no smoking in my house. Bennett leaves the kitchen. The man yells after him. \nBENNETT SENIOR I don't need your goddamn hospitality. The front door SLAMS. The man glances up at a photo of Bennett Jr. at his Howard University graduation. And next to it, the man, BENNETT SR., graduating 25 years earlier. ON TV: old, white senators listening judiciously. \nDANNY DALTON (ON TV) In our country we don't stuff dollars into ballot boxes. What we do is turn money into votes and what turns money into votes is free speech - the ability of a candidate to get his message out - and that takes money, real money, meaning, not so loosely translated: MONEY IS SPEECH! And last time I checked, speech in the USA is protected. You can't limit my advocacy just because it works. I have a sovereign, inalienable right to petition my government. Tilt up to find Bennett Senior, part of a six pack dangling from two fingers, staring at a wall covered with an intricate MATRIX of KILLEEN OIL's limited partnerships and strategic alliances all over the world. \n(CONTINUED) \n35 CONTINUED: (2) 35 \nDANNY DALTON (CONT'D) The money I gave the President is the best investment I have ever made in my business. Next election cycle I plan to double it. \n(BEAT) And why is it some dirty little secret that it's in America's interest to do business overseas? Bennett Sr. stares up at the wall. He pops a beer. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_id": 1976}

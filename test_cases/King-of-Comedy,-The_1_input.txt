RITA Well, I guess it won't kill me. 
PUPKIN This is supposed to be the finest Cantonese cuisine in the city. 
RITA Yeah? Then what happened to the tablecloths? 
PUPKIN drops his eyes. 
RITA Oh, don't worry about it.   This is 
fine. (She takes a long drink) I'm having a good time. So you've been devoted to me, huh? 
PUPKIN I used to see you at the Garden every year. 
RITA Oh, the Follies. That was the right name for 'em. How did you know which one was me? We all looked like chickens. What I mean is, we all looked like the same chicken. I thought it was gonna be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I wind up looking like Henny Penny. 
RITA chuckles to herself. 
PUPKIN You just didn't get the breaks. 
RITA Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't have the money for the right coach. But what difference does it make? 
She starts laughing to herself. 
RITA I remember once we were down in Atlanta and the ice machine broke down. We did three hours of slush. Everyone was falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow like the whole thing was planned. And the people ate it up. 
PUPKIN I liked the show. 
RITA Yeah? The Follies? You really must have been carrying the torch. What did you think when I got married? You knew I got married? 
PUPKIN I knew it wouldn't last. 
RITA You think I should have married you, instead, huh? 
PUPKIN Peter Drysdale!     Really, Rita! 
RITA 
If he'd only been hit by a train. He was worth a helluva lot more dead than alive, I can tell you that. 
RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby, talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the YOUNG MAN. 
PUPKIN Are you seeing anyone? 
RITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her looking at the YOUNG MAN. 
RITA What do you mean? 
PUPKIN I want to know about the competition, that's all. 
RITA Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And Thursday --- let's see -- 
PUPKIN I'm serious, Rita. 
RITA (imitating him) I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice) Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert. I see a lot of people. 
PUPKIN Anyone special? 
RITA (chuckling) You mean am I "going steady"?   Rupert, I'm thirty-one years old! 
PUPKIN What about that guy tonight? 
RITA Him? 
PUPKIN Why him? 
RITA What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit home watching TV? He's just some guy. He's got his own aluminum siding business. He comes into the city sometimes, that's all. 
PUPKIN You don't go out with him for his money?!? 
RITA Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do you think they pay me in that dump? Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get the world's greatest tippers in there either. Somebody has to take care of me. 
PUPKIN That's what I want to talk to you about, Rita. 
The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink. 
PUPKIN Who's your favorite movie star? 
RITA You are, Rupert.     Especially your nose. 
PUPKIN Just tell me. 
RITA Is this some kind of game? Are you going to tell me something about my character? 
PUPKIN You'll see.    Give me his name. 
RITA I can't think of anybody. 
PUPKIN You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody does. 
RITA Okay. Okay. Let's see.       (pause) Marilyn Monroe. 
PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his inside jacket pocket.

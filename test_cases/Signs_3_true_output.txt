Beat. 
GRAHAM What's wrong with the water next to your bed? 
BO It tastes old. 
Graham slowly gets up from the bed.  He takes his daughter's hand and starts out of the room. 
GRAHAM What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night? 
BO Only for pee or poop. 
GRAHAM Right. 
Graham leads his four-year old daughter down the darkened hall. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Morgan's body is half off his bed.  Graham gently lifts him back onto the pillow and covers him up. 
There are two glasses of water on Bo's bedside table.  Graham moves to Bo's bed.  He sits on the edge of it.  She stares back at him as she holds her panda. 
GRAHAM (soft) What are you thinking about? 
BO (soft) Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself? 
Beat. 
GRAHAM (soft) It makes me feel better. 
BO (soft) Does she ever answer back? 
GRAHAM (soft) No. 
BO (soft) She doesn't answer me either. 
Beat.  They both sit quietly for a moment. 
Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window.  A LARGE SILHOUETTED FIGURE STANDS ON THE ROOF IN THE DARKNESS AND STARES AT HIM. 
THE FIGURE MOVES.  HIS SHADOW PASSES OVER THE CHILDREN'S BEDROOM AS HE JUMPS FROM THE ROOF. 
Graham stands.  He looks to his daughter with startled eyes. 
BO (soft) Get under a blanket.  They can't get you under the blankets. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 
GREY SNOW FILLS THE SCREEN.  Merrill sleeps in front of the family room television. 
A hand gently shakes him.  Merrill wakes and looks up at his brother zipping up his overcoat. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 
Merrill quickly puts on his boots at the front door. 
MERRILL Okay, this guy is trying to scare us.  He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house.  It's time for an ass whoopin'! 
GRAHAM This is not an intelligent way to approach this. 
Merrill opens the front door.  It's pitch black outside. Merrill turn to Graham and gestures with his fingers. 
MERRILL (whispering) We both go outside and move around the house in opposite directions. We act crazy, insane with anger. Make him crap in his pants and force him around till we meet up on the other side. 
Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a circle. 
GRAHAM (whispering) Explain, act crazy? 
MERRILL (whispering) Curse and stuff. 
GRAHAM (whispering) I'm not going to curse. 
MERRILL (whispering) You don't mean it.  It's just for show.

BROWN TOM(dubious): What sort of mortal speaks unicorn? 
SCREWBALL: Why aren't you frozen then? 
JACK: I don't know.... I was underwater.... and when I came up for air, everything was covered with ice. 
GUMP: You'll do.... We best get you some weapons. 
JACK(puzzled): Weapons....? What are they? 
BROWN TOM (dubious): He's no champion, Gump. 
GUMP: We'll have to make him one.... or kill him trying....! Follow me! 
Gump leads Jack and the others into the woods. The unicorn follows. 
FAERIES(singing together): What can you do when there's nothing to be done? Sing a little song And have fun, fun, fun.... 
48 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT 
Lili creeps around the base of the tree, making no sound. She moves with the grace of an animal and hides behind a gnarled root where she can watch the goblins. 
Blix holds court, surrounded by a lantern's glow. Pox sits on a bit of crumbling masonary. Blunder watches Blix gesture with the alicorn. 
BLIX: Look at us! Waiting around like lackies....and for what? We're the ones with the power! 
BLUNDER: You shouldn't talk like, Blix. We gets in plenty big trouble! 
BLIX: I'm not afraid! Not even Darkness lasts forever! 
Blix aims the alicorn at Blunder, causing a burst of fire to erupt beneath the tiny, helmeted goblin. 
Blunder YELPS and runs off, clutching his flaming backside. 
Blix roars with laughte. Power has gone completely to his head. 
BLIX (cont): Watch out, Pox! 
Blix points the alicorn at Pox. Fire explodes beneath the pig-faced goblin. He leaps SCREAMING into the air. 
Blix points the alicorn at the fire he started and it grows larger. 
BLIX (cont): Higher.... higher.... Burning fire! Making music Like the choir! 
Blunder and Pox watch Blix make the fire fountain into the air. 
The heavens blaze. Lili is dazzled. 
Something very strange is happening within the swirling column of flame. Gradually, a demonic face emerges, 
Outlined in the fire we see the leering face of Darkness! 
Pox and Blunder applaud Blix's rebellion. 
POX/BLUNDER (chanting): Higher.... higher.. Burning fire! Making music Like a choir! 
The three unsuspecting goblins looks up and see the demonic Lord of Darkness flaming above them. 
Blix tosses the alicorn into the air. Blunder unwittingly catches it. 
BLIX: Greetings, Worship.... 
POX: W-w-welcome, Great Lord.... D-d-darkest of the .... 
DARKNESS: Your devotion disgusts me? You insignificant strands of toad slobber! 
Blix and Pox drop grovelling to their knees, covering their heads with leaves and dirt. 
Blunder can't control himself. He rushes forward and points the alicorn up at Darkness. 
BLUNDER: Hear me, you angels of light! Your reign is over! A new order begins! All the imps of Hell will dance freely over this dark land.... I hold the power.... 
DARKNESS: Enough! 
Darkness points a burning finger at Blunder. The alicorn is rippef from the goblin's graps and flies up to Darkness. Blunder YELPS in terror. 
Something terrible happens: the ground around Blunder begins to soften. To his horror, the little goblin sinks under as if into quicksand. 
BLUNDER: Please.... It was only a joke... I didn't mean it.... Honest....! 
Blunder is in up to his neck. 
BLUDNER (cont): Whatsamatter? Have you no sense of humour? I hope you choke of faerie breath and flower petals! 
Blunder's hand points up from the earth. Darkness ZAPS it, turning it to another chicken-claw! 
Blunder is gone without a trace; sucked under with a disgusting SLURP. 
Darknesss HOWLS his triumph to the heavens. 
From her place of concealment, Lili overhears every word. 
DARKNESS: Did you think this alicorn a mere plaything....? With it my empire is eternal! Before I ruled only the night. Now, my minions will frolic in darkness until the end of time. 
Darkness aims the alicorn at the column of fire started by Blix, tracing an arc of flames through the night. 
Like a mad orchestra conductot with a magic baton, Darkness controls the fire's movements. The blaze twists and swirls across the black night, blazing meteor trails, bright as the aeora. 
BLIX (fawning): Forgive this intrusion.... My goblins are a free-spirited lot. I like to encourage their.... initiative. What do you think of this policy, Master? 
Columns of flame shower around the Dark Lord and from within thier incendiary interiors, evil wraith-like spirits emerge, swirling like ghosts. 
Bright as comets, numbers of etheral flaming spirits orbit their fiery master. Darkness stands in total control within their mighty conflagration, the alicorn his sceptre.

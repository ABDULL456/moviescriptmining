JERRY If you're asking if we were the kind of freaky twins you see at the mall wearing the same shirt, no. Listen, Paul traveled a lot, so we didn't -- 
CONTINUED: 
MORGAN Oh. That's right. He stamped visas in Karachi for a year. Then was a junior FSO in Beirut. Interesting places. 
JERRY What're you... saying. 
MORGAN I'm just saying you didn't talk much. maybe you did. 
JERRY Am I getting a lawyer here? 'Cause didn't hear my rights read to me-- 
MORGAN You familiar with the slogan, "Declare War on War?" 
JERRY what? No, why? Morgan pulls out a SURVEILLANCE PHOTO: Jerry, college-age, at a STUDENT RALLY holding up a sign with an image of the Pentagon crossed out in red: "DECLARE WAR ON WAR!" 
MORGAN Because you painted it when you were part of the student activist group "Project Underground" at Berkley. 
JERRY (stares-at pic; LAUGHS) Wait. Come on -- okay: her name was Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd ever seen and she wanted me -- I would've gone to an "Anti-Oxygen" rally for her. I swear to God, dude-- 
MORGAN Don't "dude" me. I'm not your friend. I don't have friends... so: Jerry. Why'd you drop out of school? 
JERRY Why'd you stay in? I don't know, I didn't really see the point. 
MORGAN You haven't been able to hold a job 
JERRY Unless I've been fired from Kinko's, which is a statistical impossibility, I'm holding a job right now. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MORGAN Construction work, bartender in Singapore, telemarketing, real estate office, messenger, supermarket sign painter, taxi driver, gas station in Florida, fishing boat in Alaska-- 
JERRY -- what can I say? Guess I haven't found myself yet -- 
MORGAN Who deposited the seven-fifty? 
JERRY For as second I thought God, maybe. The ATM was obviously broken -- or do.. accidents not happen in your . universe? 
MORGAN JERRY The money originated from the --this is all -- listen, this HSBC bank of Singapore -- is all very interesting -- but opened with a transfer from a this has nothing to do with corporation called 'The Star me! Do you understand? of Orion,' a dummy front for Hezbollah. This morning Majid -- alright, this is insane, I Al-Khoei says the agents.of want a lawyer-- destruction are already inside our borders-- -- we find hardware in your -- I told you, it all just apartment, latest military showed up there'. You're not spec, airplane manuals, plus listening to me! twelve hundred pounds. of-- sit (tries to stand up) your ass down now -- ammonium (abruptly sits) nitrate fertilizer. Just curious if you knew any of Paul's friends in Beirut, or if he knew any of your friends -- what do you mean in Singapore, oh but that's "friends"?! right, we haven't really established whether or not you two were close-- (losing it) -- I guess we were rett close when I looked into his open casket this morning and saw the bad make-up job covering the gash in his skull! Or how about when I watched him being lowered into the ground -- that establish anything for you?! Somebody set me up! Morgan stares at him, unmoved. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MORGAN "Somebody." Who? 
JERRY A woman, I don't know! She called me and told me I was gonna be arrested. GET 
REAL, MAN! DO I LOOK LIKE A TERRORIST TO 
YOU?!?! 
MORGAN No more than Abdul Hamid, Taliban POW we caught in Afghanistan. Except his real name was Johnny Walker Lindh. Grew up in Marin County with a basketball hoop in his driveway and a carton of Tropicana in his fridge. He was blonder than you.. though. 
(RISES) When I come back, you'd better tell me who you work for-- And heads out the door, SLAM! Jerry yells; 
JERRY 
I WORK FOR KINKO'S!!. 
INT. DHS OBSERVATION ROOM - HALLWAY CONTINUOUS 
Morgan meets supervisor MARTIN KREBS, a senior D.H.S. big wig. Standing with LATESHA.SIMMS, 32 but looks 16, African-American, computer wonk with no room fora personal life; and TOBY GRANT, 20's, straight part in his hair, wet behind the ears. They've all been observing through a two-way mirror. Latesha refers to a laptop, one she clutches like a safety blanket: 
LATESHA He fits the profile: disaffected, 'susceptible to radical indoctrination, problem with authority. Doesn't vote or pay taxes, but witness statements all say he's not a player. He does sketches of his landlady's dog. Oh, and he's lying about the woman who called him -- we checked the records, no calls came in before we picked him up -- 
KREBS What about the brother? 
LATESHA Mid-level FSO. Been stateside the past three years. No red flags. He was killed when a truck ran a light in Crystal City. 
CONTINUED: 
MORGAN That kind of equipment and a major cash infusion five hours after a terrorist threat and were smiling and saying "coincidence?" 
KREBS So either he's a rank-and-file sleeper or a dumbshit mule. 
GRANT (eager to contribute) Or a misdirect. There's nothing subtle about him or the gear. He's not exactly a pro-- Morgan levels a look at Grant as Krebs takes .a BEAT. Figuring out the next move: 
KREBS Get Smith on financials; Rieger on travel; and let's dryclean family and friends. Again. (to Morgan, veiled 
THREAT) I don't want the FBI rushing in on this. Break him. Fast. And leaves Morgan to twist.. The pressure's on. To Latesha: 
MORGAN v m m putting you on the brother.

JORDAN (CONT'D) Thank you for that and for your years of incredible loyalty and admiration. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN (CONT'D) The point is though, that under Donnie's leadership, along with Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff moving into key management positions, this place is gonna be better than ever! 
A smattering of applause. Jordan notices a few Brokers gravely shaking their heads. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) And the fact that I'm gone won't stop me from giving Donnie advice, not that he needs any-- 
DONNIE (jumping in) Why would anyone in their right mind not follow JB's advice? 
Donnie looks petrified; he's used to being an offensive tackle, not the quarterback. 
JORDAN Before I go, there's something I want to remind you all, and that's this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger than any one person, even me. Especially me. You guys are Stratton, each and every one of you, and that is why it's sure to remain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world! 
Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all 300 Brokers on their feet. WE PUSH IN on Jordan. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) See, the very idea of Stratton is that when you come here and step into this bullpen for the first time, you start your life anew. You have a place here and no one can take that away from you! Stratton Oakmont is America! Give me your tired and poor! The very moment you walk through that door and pledge your loyalty to this firm, you become part of a family, you become a Strattonite! It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter where you're from! Whether your family came over on the Mayflower or on a fucking inner tube from Haiti! The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
More applause. Jordan scans the young faces -- they worship him. In the crowd he finds KIMMIE BELZER, 30s. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) Everybody here knows Kimmie Belzer, right? 
Hoots and hollers...      He raises his hand for quiet. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) In case any of you weren't aware of it, Kimmie was one of Stratton's first brokers, one of the original twenty. Now when most of you met Kimmie, you met her the way she is today -- a beautiful woman who drives a brand new Mercedes, a woman who lives in the finest condo complex on Long Island. A woman who wears $3000 Armani suits, who spends her winters in the Bahamas and her summers in the Hamptons! 
Wild applause. 
JORDAN (CONT'D) But that's not the Kimmie I met. The Kimmie I met was broke, a single mom on the balls of her ass. Three months behind on her rent with an eight year old son! She came to me for a job and when I hired her she asked for a $5000 dollar advance so she could pay his tuition. And what did I do, Kimmie? 
KIMMIE You wrote me a check for $25,000! 
JORDAN Because I believed in you, like I believe in each and every one of you! 
KIMMIE I love you, Jordan! 
As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the adoration. He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd, looks out at the faces. A change has come over him. He stands there, thinking. An eternity, then: The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
JORDAN You know for years I've been telling you guys not to take no for an answer, to keep pushing, to not hang up the phone till you get what you want. This deal I'm about to sign, barring me from the securities industry, barring me from Stratton, my home... What the fuck is that? I'll tell you what it is, it's me being a hypocrite. It's me taking no for an answer, it's them selling me, not the other way around! Fuck it, I'm not leaving! 
Jordan smiles, thrusts his hands in the air -- 
JORDAN (CONT'D) THE SHOW GOES ON!! 
The place goes absolutely INSANE. And as Donnie and Max trade looks, TECHNO MUSIC BLASTS taking us to...

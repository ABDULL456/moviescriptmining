Please, Matt. 
Head bowed, Matt exits scene. 
CUT TO: 
258. INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MATT AND HELEN 
Immediately following: 
HELEN 
Did you talk to him? 
MATT 
(downcast) 
Yeah. 
(he has a sudden inspiration) 
I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone. 
They exit scene hurriedly. 
CUT TO: 
259. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. CLOSEUP 
All of his beliefs are shaken by this seeming betrayal. Dickson takes a framed photograph of Phyllis from his desk, gingerly sets it face down in the center drawer of his desk. 
Also in the desk drawer is - he cannot help but notice - a gun. 
CUT TO: 
260. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - CLARK 
As he dictates to someone off screen: 
CLARK 
Â—a thirty-day option on ten thousand shares of stock of this company, now registered in the name of Thomas A. Dickson. Now make that in triplicate and get it to me just as fast as you can. Hurry! 
CUT TO: 
261. INT. SOMEWHERE IN THE BANK - CLOSE SHOT AT PAYROLL WINDOW 
Shooting past cashier in f.g. towards line of laborers waiting to be paid. 
Cashier stands in front of a tall counter upon which is a small metal box filled with currency. He is speaking into the phone by his side as scene opens. 
He hangs up receiver and turns to the men on the other side of the window. 
CASHIER 
(speaking thru small window) 
Sorry ladies and gentlemen, there's no more money. You'll have to go on to the next window. 
He snaps the window shut, slams down cover of little metal box. 
Angry ad-lib from line of laborers waiting to be paid. 
CUSTOMER AD-LIBS 
What do you mean there's no more money? etc. 
Panicked shouting and pushing. In the center of the crowd, a woman faints. 
CUT TO: 
Another cashier, another window, another angry line of depositors. 
CASHIER 
That's all there is! 
More pushing, shouting, angry ad-lib. 
CUT TO: 
262. INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Phyllis Dickson, serious-faced, comes up steps and thru ante room on the way to Dickson's private office. 
She pounds on door of office. There is no reply from within. Standing next to her is a bank guard, uncertain about what to do. Throughout scene, there are b.g. sounds of melee in the bank. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(to bank guard) 
Are you sure he's in there? 
GUARD 
Yes, ma'am. He must be in there. He hasn't come out. 
She pounds on the door again. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(shouting) 
Tom! Tom! Tom! 
(to guard) 
I've got to get in there. Can't you find me a key? 
GUARD 
(reaching into Helen's desk) 
Yes, I think there's one right here in the drawer. 
CUT TO: 
263. INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - FULL SHOT 
As Mrs. Dickson rushes in. 
Dickson is standing by a window. 
264. CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON 
She walks over to him - CAMERA PANNING WITH HER - and stands in back of him. 
MRS. DICKSON 
(softly - seriously) 
Tom! Oh Tom, darling - I came to explain about last night . . . 
Dickson remains silent. Mrs. Dickson continues: 
MRS. DICKSON 
Cyril Cluett doesn't mean anything to me, Tom. I went out with him last night simply because . . . well, I had begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life. That I was an outsider. Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre, and then we went back to his apartment afterward for a drink. That's all it was. I didn't do anything wrong, Tom. I couldn't do anything wrong. I love you too much. You know that. 
265. CLOSEUP - DICKSON 
As he stares dully out the window. 
Mrs. Dickson's voice coming over shot: 
MRS. DICKSON 
(breaking down - sobbing) 
Oh, Tom! Tom! 
CUT TO: 
266. INT. SOMEWHERE IN BANK - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - MATT AND HELEN 
Favoring Matt. 
They are furiously working two phones, going down a list of people who owe Dickson and the bank a favor. 
Although Matt has focus in the scene, Helen's voice is always in b.g., as she handles calls, making the same pitch. 
MATT 
(into phone - rat-a-tat) 
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse. 
HELEN

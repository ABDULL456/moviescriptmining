THIRTY PEOPLE and an inexpensive bier SEEN from the back of the hall. \nANGLE \nA MAN's back FILLS the SCREEN. He is dressed in a black suit; his hands are clasped behind him. ANOTHER MAN stands next to him. The Second Man reaches behind the First Man's back and puts a discreetly folded ten-dollar bill into his hands. \nANGLE \nThese Two Men from the front. Both somber, in their early fifties. They begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral parlor. \nANGLE \nThe WIDOW. A woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier receiving condolences. The Two Men approach her. The First Man (the recipient of the money) speaks: \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a very good friend of ours, and a very fine attorney. \nGALVIN It's a shame about your husband, Mrs. Dee. \nThe Widow nods. \nGALVIN I knew him vaguely through the Lodge. He was a wonderful man. (shakes head in sympathy) It was a crime what happened to him. A crime. If there's anything that I could do to help... \nGALVIN removes a business card from his jacket pocket and hands it to her as if he were giving her money. (i.e., \"Take it. Really. I want you to have it...\" She takes the card. \nBeat. \nGALVIN (thoughtfully realizes he is usurping her time) Well... \nHe shakes her hand and moves on. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nGalvin sitting in the deserted coffee shop in his raincoat. \nReading a section of the paper. He picks up his teacup, drinks. Lowers it to the table. \nANGLE - INSERT \nGalvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops of tea. His hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table. \nHe moves his hand to the paper, open at the obituary section. \nWe SEE several names crossed out.

SECOND FUNERAL HOME AND STREET - AFTERNOON \nGalvin outside a second funeral home. WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE entering, Galvin enters the home. \nANGLE \nGalvin, coming down the aisle toward the front, shrugging himself out of his overcoat, he approaches the BEREAVED WIDOW sitting by the front of the home, he extracts his card from his pocket, starts to speak. He is stopped by the WIDOW'S SON, a hefty man in his mid-forties, who interjects himself between Galvin and the widow. \nSON (of the card) What is that...? \nGALVIN I... \nSON What the hell is that... \nGALVIN ...I was a friend of your fa... \nSON You never knew my father. (hits card out of Galvin's hand) You get out of here, who the hell do you think you are... \nThe FUNERAL MANAGER hurries down the aisle, and starts extricating Galvin from the commotion. \nGALVIN (to Funeral Manager) I'm talking to this man... \nGALVIN ...now who is that...? \nMICKEY ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them... \nGALVIN Sally Doneghy, now who is that? \nMICKEY One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way... \nGALVIN ...hey, I don't need your charity... \nMICKEY ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file. \nGalvin pours himself a drink. \nGALVIN Hey, what are you, my nanny? \nMickey walks to him, knocks the drink out of his hand and slaps him several times in the face. \nMICKEY Listen to me. Listen to me... listen to me, Frank, 'cause I'm done fuckin' with you. I can't do it any more. Look around you: You think that you're going to change? What's going to change it? You think it's going to be different next month? It's going to be the same. And I have to stop. This is it. I got you a good case, it's a moneymaker. You do it right and it will take care of you. But I'm through. I'm sorry, Frank, this is the end. (beat) Life is too short, and I'm too old. (beat) \nMickey walks out of the office. Slams the door. Beat. \nGalvin looks around the office. Goes to his sofa. Sits, reaches to side table. \nANGLE - INSERT \nThe side table, a pack of Luckies. Galvin taking one, his hand shaking a little. Also on side table a pile of change containing a small rosary and a wedding ring. \nINT. GALVIN'S OFFICE ANTEROOM - INSERT - DAY \nThe carriage of a typewriter. A sheet of paper. Its letterhead reads \"Frank P. Galvin. Attorney at Law, 124 State Street, Boston, Mass. 02981. Cable FRAGAL.\" Someone is typing, \"Sorry I had to go out. Back at 10. Judge Geary called. Are you available for lunch Wednesday University Club?\" A hand takes a paper from carriage and puts it on desk. Takes a pen and signs, \"Claire.\" \nANGLE \nGalvin in the anteroom, dressed in his suit, unshaved, having just signed the paper.

O'ROURKE'S BAR - DAY \nDark paneling, clean, simple. A drinkers' bar. OLD BARTENDER and THREE CUSTOMERS spaced widely, Galvin in his overcoat downing a shot, the file open before him. He is reading. \nHe checks his watch, scoops the file together under his arm, throws a dollar on the bar, and heads for the door. \nINT. NORTHERN NURSING HOME CORRIDOR - DAY \nGalvin walking tentatively down the corridor of a very rundown nursing home. He receives suspicious looks from the Attendants. He is checking numbers on the doors against a notation in the file. He finds the correct door and enters. \nINT. NURSING HOME WARD - DAY \nThe door to the ward from the inside. Galvin opening the door to the dark ward, backlit, tentative, a little unsteadied from his drinking. He puts his back against the door, puts down file and briefcase, extracts a small cheap Polaroid camera from the briefcase, readies it to shoot, picks up his paraphernalia, and starts off down the ward. As he walks down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each bed. Galvin stops at the foot of one bed and reads the chart. \nANGLE - P.O.V. \nThe chart held by Galvin. DEBORAH ANN KAYE, various medical notations. He lowers the chart and we SEE in the bed beyond it a shriveled, tiny form stuck with needles and tubes. \nANGLE \nGalvin replaces the chart, puts his file, briefcase, etc. on the foot of the bed, takes a flash photo of the figure in the bed. Takes another one. Puts down camera, sits on the end of the bed gazing at the unseen form. He lights a cigarette, and sits looking at her. \nINT. CORRIDOR - GALVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nSALLY DONEGHY. A mousy woman in her forties is standing by a door on which is written, \"Frank P. Galvin. Attorney at Law.\" \nGALVIN I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in? \nSALLY It's locked. \nGALVIN (astonished) It's locked? \nSally Doneghy points to the note on the door. Galvin takes it from the door. Reads. \"Back at 10, Judge Geary. Lunch...\" \nGALVIN I'm terribly sorry... I hope we didn't put you out. Won't you come in...? (motions Sally into inner office, gestures with note) I'd offer you some coffee, but it looks like my girl just went out. \nGALVIN The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate... \nGRUBER ...and you're going to do that? \nGALVIN (surprised, of course) Yes. \nGRUBER You're going to settle out of court? \nGruber stops at the bottom of the stairs, beside an exit to the outside. \nGALVIN Yes. \nGRUBER Why? \nA beat. \nGALVIN (it's a meaningless question to him, as if to a child) Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors... \nGRUBER (glances at watch, impatient) Her doctors killed her. \nGALVIN (a beat) I'm sorry...? \nGRUBER Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. (a beat) Her doctors murdered her. \nGALVIN Do you know who her doctors were? \nGRUBER I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were. \nGALVIN The most respected... \nGRUBER (smiling) Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill? \nA beat. Gruber discards end of a cigar. Takes a leather case from his suede jacket, extracts a new cigar. Offers one to Galvin. \nGRUBER You want a cigar? \nGalvin takes one absently. \nGALVIN The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of... \nGRUBER What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...? (checks watch) Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge... \nGalvin, excited, is trying to light the cigar. His hand shakes badly. He has forgotten to bite off the end. He bites it, lights the cigar. \nGALVIN Well, well, when can we meet again. \nI'd like to get a deposition.. \nGRUBER Okay. I'll meet you here. Tuesday night... I gotta go. You going my way? \nGalvin shakes his head. \nEXT. GRUBER'S HOSPITAL PARKING AREA - NIGHT \nGruber opens door and walks out into the cold, into the parking lot, followed by Galvin, who is lighting his cigar. \nGALVIN We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss... \nGRUBER I understand. \nGALVIN ...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony... \nThey stop before a 1950s very beautiful small Mercedes Sedan. \nGruber opens the door, gets into the plush red leather interior, starts car, leaves door open, still talking to Galvin. \nGRUBER Right. Seven o'clock. Here. \nGalvin scribbles information in his appointment book. \nGALVIN Thank you... \nGRUBER ...that's perfectly all right. \nGALVIN (beat) Uh, why, why are you doing this? \nGRUBER (thinks a second) To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it? \nINT. O'ROURKE'S TAVERN - NIGHT \nIRISH NURSE #2 (V.O.) ...and what did he say...? \nIRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.) (spies Galvin, her tone changes) ...Sir, you aren't allowed to be in here... \nANGLE \nGalvin sitting on the bed looking at Deborah Ann. He looks up to the speaker. A slovenly Irish Nurse, who has come into the room and is standing by him. The other Nurse is framed in the doorway. Galvin is lost in thought. \nNURSE You can't be in here. \nGALVIN (as if remembering something, simply) I'm her attorney. \nINT. BISHOP BROPHY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe Bishop from the waist up, sitting behind his beautiful desk. Compassionately: \nBISHOP It's a question of continuing values. St. Catherine's -- to do the good that she must do in the community has to maintain the position that she holds in the community. So we have a question of balance. On the one hand, the reputation, and, so, the effectiveness of our hospital, and two of her important doctors -- and, on the other hand, the rights of your client. \nANGLE \nGalvin seated across from the Bishop. A YOUNG PRIEST seated, discreetly, attentively, across the room. Sherry glasses in front of Galvin and the Bishop. Galvin drinking from his. \nBISHOP A young woman. In her prime... deprived of... (searches for a word) ...life... sight... her family... It's tragic. It's a tragic accident. \nGalvin has been dreaming. \nBISHOP ...nothing, of course, can begin to make it right. But we must do what we can. We must do all that we can. \nHe gestures to the Young Priest, who crosses the room, extracts a sheet from a file folder, and places it before Galvin, who is sitting as if in a dream. The Bishop waits a beat, not wanting to interrupt Galvin's reverie, then catches his eye and gestures down at the paper. Galvin glances down. \nINSERT \nThe sheet: \"I, Frank P. Galvin, duly appointed conservator for Deborah Ann Kaye, in consideration of Two Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($210,000.00) paid in hand to me this day by St. Catherine Laboure Hospital do hereby release from any and all claims...\" \nANGLE \nGalvin and the Bishop as before. Galvin finishes reading, looks up. \nBISHOP Yes. We must try to make it right. \nBeat. Galvin nods. Beat. Bishop nods discreetly to the Young Priest who extracts Mount Blanc fountain pen from his pocket, holds it out to Galvin. \nBISHOP It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... (beat) ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture... \nGALVIN How did you settle on the amount? \nBISHOP We thought it was just. \nGALVIN You thought it was just. \nBISHOP Yes. \nGALVIN Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy. \nBISHOP That was our insurance company's recommendation. \nGALVIN Yes. It would be. \nA beat. \nBISHOP Nothing that we can do can make that woman well. \nGALVIN And no one will know the truth. \nBISHOP What is the truth? \nGALVIN That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money. (beat) I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money. (to Young Priest, waving away document) I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser. (beat; pleading for understanding) I can't do it. I can't take it. \nYOUNG PRIEST If we may discuss money, Mr. Galvin. How is your law practice? \nGALVIN It's not too good. I've only got one client. \nHOLD. \nINT. LAWYERS ROOM AND CORRIDOR - DAY \nGalvin, determined, coming down a corridor in the Courthouse, opens a door. CAMERA FOLLOWS him IN. The Lawyers Room. \nTen or twelve AMBULANCE CHASERS waiting for clients. They all look up as he enters, then return to their reading, phones, card games. CAMERA FOLLOWS him TO the corner of the room where MICKEY MORRISSEY is playing Gin with a CRONY. \nThe young Lawyer stands as Concannon sits, listening. \nYOUNG LAWYER Please turn to your Page Four. \nAll the lawyers in the office turn in their files to that page. \nYOUNG LAWYER We're going to start with a review of the depositions of the Operating Room Team: the nurse-anesthetist, the scrub-nurse, the... \nINT. LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT \nGalvin and Mickey at a library table piled with books. A dingy, dusty law library. They are smoking, speak in undertones, referring to the yellow legal pads in front of them. Rehashing material. \nMICKEY Who have we got? \nGALVIN We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. \nMICKEY You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. \nGALVIN Admittance form is wrong. \nMICKEY Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. \nGALVIN I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... \nMICKEY (conceding) ...Gruber's not bad. \nGALVIN Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book, (hunts for book on desk, holds it up; reads) 'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.' (rummages through a pile of papers on the desk) ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...' (checking a list) They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? \nMICKEY (checking list) No. \nGALVIN (reading from pad) 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up. \nMICKEY Right. \nGALVIN Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan. \nMICKEY Right. \nGALVIN Brindisi versus Electric Boat. \nMICKEY You got a good memory, Franky. \nGALVIN I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport... \nINT. O'ROURKE'S PUB - NIGHT \nGalvin and Mickey entering the bar, walk over to the bar. \nGalvin sees something O.S. Call to the bartender. \nGALVIN Jimmy?

What did you do? \nLAURA I changed my room at the Hotel. \nGALVIN Why? \nLAURA The TV didn't work. \nThe clock reads 10:12. \nANGLE \nGalvin downs his drink, picks his briefcase off of the bar and starts for the door. \nINT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS-DAY \nJUDGE SWEENEY, a florid man in his sixties, sitting in shirtsleeves eating bacon and eggs off of a hotel service on a tray, talking conspiratorially with Ed Concannon, who is drinking coffee, seated across the desk. They are obviously old friends. The sound of a door opening. They turn their heads to the door. \nANGLE - P.O.V. \nGalvin standing in the door. \nJUDGE (V.O.) You're late, Mr. Galvin. \nHe enters the room. CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he sits next to Concannon. \nGALVIN Yessir. I'm sorry. \nJUDGE Why is that? \nGALVIN I was held up. \nConcannon smiles and extends his hand. \nCONCANNON Ed Concannon. \nGALVIN (shaking his head) Frank Galvin. We've met before. \nAs the Judge starts to speak Galvin cannot help looking at Concannon out of the corner of his eye. \nJUDGE Let's do some business. \nANGLE - P.O.V. GALVIN \nConcannon, brisk, expensive-looking, tanned, huge gold watch, custom-made suit. \nJUDGE (V.O.) They tell me that no bargain ever was completed other than quickly when both parties really cared to make a deal. \nConcannon feels Galvin's eye on him, half-turns, smiles. \nANGLE - THE JUDGE, CONCANNON, GALVIN \nJUDGE Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother. \nGALVIN This is a complicated case, your Honor... \nJUDGE I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? (smiles at Galvin) See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? \nGALVIN My client can't walk, your Honor. \nJUDGE I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you. \nCONCANNON Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars. \nJUDGE Huh! \nCONCANNON My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. (beat) When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. (turns to Galvin) As long as you understand that. (beat) It's got to be that way. \nGALVIN We are going to try the case. \nA beat. Galvin fumbles for a cigarette. The three sit in silence. \nJUDGE (incredulous) That's it...? (beat) Come on, guys... life is too short... (beat) You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it. (beat; turns to Galvin) Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records. \nGALVIN ...things change. \nJUDGE ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... \nGALVIN I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro... \nJUDGE And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. (beat) I myself would take it and run like a thief. \nGALVIN I'm sure you would. \nThe Judge turns, unbelieving that Galvin has patronized and insulted him. He controls himself. \nJUDGE Hm. (beat; checking book) We have the date set? Next Thursday. Good. (smiles) See you boys in court. \nJOHN That's thirty-three bucks. Can you believe that...? \nMICKEY Oh, yeah. Your broad from last night. \nGalvin pays the Cigar Stand Operator. \nJOHN Thanks, Franky. \nGALVIN Tell her that I'll meet her there, okay? See you tomorrow in the office. \nMickey shrugs. \nGALVIN We're doing fine. \nANGLE \nThe two of them crossing the lobby. \nDick Doneghy, looking around the lobby, spies them, starts across, and accosts Galvin. \nDONEGHY You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? (pushes Galvin into a wall; advances; pushes him again) Who do you think you are...? \nGALVIN Hold on a second. \nDONEGHY I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did? \nHe pushes Galvin again. Galvin waves Mickey off. \nGALVIN It's all right, Mickey. \nDONEGHY You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours... (pushes Galvin again) You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years. (beat) Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister. \nGALVIN I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case... \nDONEGHY What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred... \nGALVIN I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars. \nDONEGHY You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives. \nHe nods sadly to himself. Beat. \nGALVIN If I could accept the offer right now, I would. (beat) They took it back. \nDONEGHY I understand. (starts to walk away from Galvin; stops) I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred. \nINT.

Especially if you were unprepared. \nGALVIN I had a witness disappear on me. \nJUDGE That happens. \nGALVIN I could subpoena him if I had a week. \nJUDGE I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now.

TOWLER ...I was one of a group of... \nCONCANNON Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right? \nDR.

TOWLER Yes. \nANGLE \nConcannon starts to stroll a bit around the conference room, in back of the assembled assistants, by the large windows, which offer a panoramic view of Boston. \nCONCANNON Anything special about the case? \nDR.

I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my... \nDR. THOMPSON ...I made a reservation at... \nGALVIN ...apartment. (stops) No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they... \nDR. THOMPSON ...What difference would... \nGALVIN These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case.

Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is? \nMARY ROONEY No. \nGALVIN He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what? \nMARY ROONEY ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me? \nGALVIN I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that.

P.O.V. JUDGE. \nJUDGE Let's begin. \nGalvin gets to his feet. Walks over to the JURY. Looks at them, appraising. He pauses as before a great effort. Takes a breath. Exhales. \nGALVIN It's a terrible thing to sit in judgment. So much rides on it. I know that you've thought, 'How can I be pure. How can I be impartial without being cold. How can I be merciful and still be just?' And I know that most of you have said some sort of prayer this morning to be helped. To judge correctly. We have the reputation of two men. Two well respected doctors and a renowned hospital before us. And with those two respected men we have my client, Deborah Ann Kaye... (beat) ...who was deprived of sight, of locomotion, hearing, speech, of everything, in short, which constitutes her life. (beat) We are going to prove she was deprived through negligence.

I was engaged to render an opinion. \nCONCANNON Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today? \nDR. THOMPSON Just as you are, Sir... \nCONCANNON Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor? \nDR. THOMPSON No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State... \nCONCANNON ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine? \nDR. THOMPSON No. \nCONCANNON Neurology? \nDR. THOMPSON No. \nJUDGE Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question? \nDR.

I'll see the Plaintiff's Counsel in my chambers. Now, please. \nThe Courtroom rises. The Bailiff is heard, \"All rise, court is adjourned until one o'clock.\" \nINT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS - DAY \nGalvin, furious, standing against the wall. The Judge comes in from his own entrance, shucking his robe. Equally angry. \nJUDGE I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today. \nGALVIN I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me. \nJUDGE Listen to me, fella... \nGALVIN No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair. \nGalvin is pacing. Beat. \nJUDGE (conciliatory) Galvin, look, many years ago... \nGALVIN And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are. \nJUDGE (beat; barely controlling anger) Are you done? \nGALVIN Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass. \nJUDGE You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail. \nINT.

What do you do when you don't have a witness? \nMICKEY (reciting a catechism; dispiritedly) You use their witness. \nGALVIN That's right. \nMICKEY I think we tried that. The case is over. \nGalvin continues pacing. He will not hear what was just said. \nMICKEY And how the fuck... You broke the first law that they taught you in law school. You never ask a question you don't know the answer to. (beat) Frankie, wake up. You got your own expert witness says there was no negligence. It's over. Period. There'll be no other cases... \nGalvin turns on him, animal-like. \nGALVIN There are no other cases. This is the case. (beat) Now you decide... (beat) Are you in or out...? \nINT.

He said, 'They don't pay you to do your best. They pay you to win.' (beat) That's what pays for this office. (beat) And that's what pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor. And for the kind of law that you want to practice. And that's what pays for your clothes and my whiskey, and the leisure that we have to sit back and discuss philosophy. (beat) As we're doing tonight. (beat) We're paid to win the case. \nANGLE - CONCANNON AND LAURA \nLaura sitting across from him, impassive. \nCONCANNON You finished your marriage.

We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form. \nJUDGE ...one moment, Mr. Concannon... \nThe Judge nods, meaning, \"I am considering...\" \nANGLE \nThe Judge. He is making some notations on a page in front of him. He nods to himself, he has reached a decision.

(explains to them) It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original... \nCONCANNON Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here. \nJUDGE I'm going to uphold that. \nANGLE \nGalvin getting to his feet. \nGALVIN I object, your Honor... \nJUDGE Overruled... \nGALVIN Exception! \nJUDGE Noted. Thank you. (to Jury) Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed... \nANGLE \nGalvin, silent, fuming, sitting at the table. \nJUDGE (V.O.) Her entire testimony must be stricken from the record. You shouldn't have heard it, but you did. Now, that was my mistake... and you must strike it from your minds, give it no weight. \nGalvin takes a sheet of legal paper and starts writing on it. \nINT. BISHOP BROPHY'S SUITE - DAY \nALITO Legally it's over. Concannon was brilliant. \nBROPHY Tell me about Kaitlin Costello. \nALITO There's nothing to tell.

Beat. \nGALVIN You know, so much of the time we're lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us what is right. Tell us what's true. There is no justice. The rich win, the poor are powerless...' We become tired of hearing people lie. After a time we become dead. A little dead. We start thinking of ourselves as victims. (pause) And we become victims. (pause) And we become weak... and doubt ourselves, and doubt our institutions... and doubt our beliefs... we say for example, 'The law is a sham... there is no law... I was a fool for having believed there was.' (beat) But today you are the law. You are the law... And not some book and not the lawyers, or the marble statues and the trappings of the court... all that they are is symbols. (beat) Of our desire to be just... (beat) All that they are, in effect, is a prayer... (beat) ...a fervent, and a frightened prayer. \nGALVIN In my religion we say, 'Act as if you had faith, and faith will be given to you.' (beat) If... If we would have faith in justice, we must only believe in ourselves. (beat) And act with justice. (beat) And I believe that there is justice in our hearts. (beat) Thank you. \nHe stands still a moment, then surveys the still courtroom. \nINT.

He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court. \nBISHOP No -- we don't want this case in court. \nALITO Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff. \nBISHOP I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed. \nALITO No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not. \nBISHOP So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me. \nALITO All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial. \nThe Bishop nods, meaning, \"You are dismissed.\" As an afterthought: \nBISHOP If we were to go to trial, would we win the case? \nALITO Well, of course, it's always dangerous... \nBISHOP I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win? \nALITO (in an \"of course\" tone) Yes. \nAlito, preparing to leave, reaches to the Bishop's desk, where he has laid his leather folder. \nANGLE \nThe clipping in the folder, confused Galvin being led into jail, \"Boston Lawyer Held in Jury Tampering Case.\" Alito's hand snaps the folder shut. \nINT.

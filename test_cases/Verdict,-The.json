THIRTY PEOPLE and an inexpensive bier SEEN from the back of the hall. \nANGLE \nA MAN's back FILLS the SCREEN. He is dressed in a black suit; his hands are clasped behind him. ANOTHER MAN stands next to him. The Second Man reaches behind the First Man's back and puts a discreetly folded ten-dollar bill into his hands. \nANGLE \nThese Two Men from the front. Both somber, in their early fifties. They begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral parlor. \nANGLE \nThe WIDOW. A woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier receiving condolences. The Two Men approach her. The First Man (the recipient of the money) speaks: \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a very good friend of ours, and a very fine attorney. \nGALVIN It's a shame about your husband, Mrs. Dee. \nThe Widow nods. \nGALVIN I knew him vaguely through the Lodge. He was a wonderful man. (shakes head in sympathy) It was a crime what happened to him. A crime. If there's anything that I could do to help... \nGALVIN removes a business card from his jacket pocket and hands it to her as if he were giving her money. (i.e., \"Take it. Really. I want you to have it...\" She takes the card. \nBeat. \nGALVIN (thoughtfully realizes he is usurping her time) Well... \nHe shakes her hand and moves on. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nGalvin sitting in the deserted coffee shop in his raincoat. \nReading a section of the paper. He picks up his teacup, drinks. Lowers it to the table. \nANGLE - INSERT \nGalvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops of tea. His hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table. \nHe moves his hand to the paper, open at the obituary section. \nWe SEE several names crossed out. He circles one funeral listing. \nANGLE \nGalvin sitting, raises cup of tea to his lips. Looks around deserted coffee shop. Sighs. \nINT. SECOND FUNERAL HOME AND STREET - AFTERNOON \nGalvin outside a second funeral home. WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE entering, Galvin enters the home. \nANGLE \nGalvin, coming down the aisle toward the front, shrugging himself out of his overcoat, he approaches the BEREAVED WIDOW sitting by the front of the home, he extracts his card from his pocket, starts to speak. He is stopped by the WIDOW'S SON, a hefty man in his mid-forties, who interjects himself between Galvin and the widow. \nSON (of the card) What is that...? \nGALVIN I... \nSON What the hell is that... \nGALVIN ...I was a friend of your fa... \nSON You never knew my father. (hits card out of Galvin's hand) You get out of here, who the hell do you think you are... \nThe FUNERAL MANAGER hurries down the aisle, and starts extricating Galvin from the commotion. \nGALVIN (to Funeral Manager) I'm talking to this man... \n", "test1_true": "He is manhandling Galvin toward the back of the funeral parlor. The Son calls after him: \nSON Who the hell do you think you are? \nEXT. SECOND FUNERAL PARLOR - AFTERNOON \nThe Funeral Manager and Galvin standing in the cold. \nFUNERAL MANAGER I don't want you coming back here. Ever. Do you understand? \nGALVIN I was just talking to... \nFUNERAL MANAGER Those are bereaved people in there. \nThe Funeral Manager gives Galvin a small shove, and goes back to his post at the door, greeting the entering mourners. \n\"Good evening...\" \nANGLE \nGalvin, the ground cut out from under him. Standing watching the mourners enter. \nEXT. SECOND FUNERAL STREET - DUSK \nGalvin walking down a residential street. He has been walking a while in the cold, snowy night. He stops for a stoplight at a corner, waits for the light although there is no traffic. \nLights a cigarette. The light changes. He looks both ways and irresolutely starts across the street. He stops. He checks his watch. He sighs, and starts back in the opposite direction. \nINT. O'ROURKE'S BAR - NIGHT \nGalvin holding forth at the bar of a seedy drinking-man's establishment, THREE DRINKERS, acquaintances, standing around him, appreciative. \nGALVIN Pat says, 'Mike... there's a new bar, you go in, for a half a buck you get a beer, a free lunch, and then take you in the back room and they get you laid.' \nThe bartender, JIMMY, comes up to Galvin. \nJIMMY Another, Frank...? \nGALVIN (gestures to include group) ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...' (gestures to Jimmy) Everyone. Buy yourself one too. \nINT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe seedy, disorganized small office, Galvin in shirt-sleeves opening a file cabinet. He takes out an armload of files, carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in. He sits on his desk, as if exhausted by his effort, pours from a whiskey bottle into a large water glass, downs the glass. \nHe has been drinking for some time. He starts stumbling back to the file cabinet. On the way his eye is caught by his degrees hanging on the wall. He stumbles to them, picks them up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in. He goes back to the file cabinet, the phone starts ringing. Galvin lets it ring, continues emptying the files into the wastebasket, tearing some of them up as he does so. \nHe repeats softly to himself, as a litany, \"It doesn't make a bit of difference, it doesn't make a bit of difference...\" He starts back to the desk for the bottle, knocks the still- ringing phone off the desk. He pours himself a drink. \nAs he downs it we hear -- softly -- from the phone on the floor: a MAN'S VOICE. \"Frank. Frank. Frank. Goddamnit. Are you there...? Frank...\" Galvin pays no attention. \nDrinks his drink and gazes at the wall -- now empty of degrees. \nANGLE - P.O.V. \nThe empty wall. Galvin's P.O.V. The telephone heard Voice Over insisting, \"Frank...\" \nINT. GALVIN'S OFFICE ANTEROOM - NIGHT \nMICKEY MORRISSEY, a man in his late sixties, dressed in suit and overcoat, looking worried, unlocks the door to the dark anteroom. Looks around. Sees something in the next room. \nANGLE - P.O.V. \nGalvin asleep on his couch, clothed as before. Covered in his overcoat, the bottle and glass next to the couch on the floor, the sound of the phone off the hook. \nANGLE \nMickey walks into the office. Stands looking at Galvin. \nMICKEY (harshly) Get up. (beat, more harshly) Get up. \nGalvin wakes up. Looks around. Swings his legs over the couch. Drinks from the glass. Vacantly: \nGALVIN Hi, Mickey... \nMICKEY What the hell do you think you're doing...? (surveys the wrecked office) What's going on here...? \nGALVIN Uh... \nMICKEY Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy... \n", "test1_id": 294, "test2_input": "GALVIN The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate... \nGRUBER ...and you're going to do that? \nGALVIN (surprised, of course) Yes. \nGRUBER You're going to settle out of court? \nGruber stops at the bottom of the stairs, beside an exit to the outside. \nGALVIN Yes. \nGRUBER Why? \nA beat. \nGALVIN (it's a meaningless question to him, as if to a child) Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors... \nGRUBER (glances at watch, impatient) Her doctors killed her. \nGALVIN (a beat) I'm sorry...? \nGRUBER Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. (a beat) Her doctors murdered her. \nGALVIN Do you know who her doctors were? \nGRUBER I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were. \nGALVIN The most respected... \nGRUBER (smiling) Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill? \nA beat. Gruber discards end of a cigar. Takes a leather case from his suede jacket, extracts a new cigar. Offers one to Galvin. \nGRUBER You want a cigar? \nGalvin takes one absently. \nGALVIN The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of... \nGRUBER What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...? (checks watch) Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge... \nGalvin, excited, is trying to light the cigar. His hand shakes badly. He has forgotten to bite off the end. He bites it, lights the cigar. \nGALVIN Well, well, when can we meet again. \nI'd like to get a deposition.. \nGRUBER Okay. I'll meet you here. Tuesday night... I gotta go. You going my way? \nGalvin shakes his head. \nEXT. GRUBER'S HOSPITAL PARKING AREA - NIGHT \nGruber opens door and walks out into the cold, into the parking lot, followed by Galvin, who is lighting his cigar. \nGALVIN We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss... \nGRUBER I understand. \nGALVIN ...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony... \nThey stop before a 1950s very beautiful small Mercedes Sedan. \nGruber opens the door, gets into the plush red leather interior, starts car, leaves door open, still talking to Galvin. \nGRUBER Right. Seven o'clock. Here. \nGalvin scribbles information in his appointment book. \nGALVIN Thank you... \nGRUBER ...that's perfectly all right. \nGALVIN (beat) Uh, why, why are you doing this? \nGRUBER (thinks a second) To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it? \nINT. O'ROURKE'S TAVERN - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "GALVIN I want to buy you a drink. \nJIMMY (THE BARTENDER) Thanks, Franky. \nGalvin looks around. A very attractive self-possessed YOUNG WOMAN is sitting in the crook of the bar across from him; she is intently perusing the newspaper and circling items with a felt pen. Galvin speaks to her: \nGALVIN Would you like a drink? \nShe looks up. Smiles. \nWOMAN I'd like an apartment. \nGALVIN Settle for a drink? \nShe gestures at her own full glass in front of her. \nWOMAN No. Thank you. \nGalvin shrugs. \nGALVIN I had a very good day today. \nWOMAN (beat, smiles, downs drink, gets up off the stool, sincerely) I'm glad you did. Thank you. Good night. \nGALVIN You're very welcome. \nHe watches her as she leaves the bar. He turns back to his drink. \nGALVIN Well, well, well. Huh? \nJIMMY Yeah. \nGALVIN (sighs) It's a long road that has no turning. \nJIMMY That's for sure, Frank. \nINT. GALVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA shoddy one-and-a-half room bachelor apartment. Galvin, beer and cigarettes on the table beside him. He is sitting on an armchair in the bedroom. A yellow legal pad in his lap. \nHe is talking on the phone softly, soothingly. \nGALVIN I'm going to the Archdiocese tomorrow at two. I know you don't. I know you don't... no, you're just following your life. You have a life too... you have to move out West. It doesn't help you to stay here. Well... I'm sure she knows you care for her. \nHis attention wanders to the legal pad in his lap. \nANGLE - P.O.V. \nThe legal pad. Spread on it a couple of Polaroids of Deborah Ann in the nursing home. Below them, written on the pad, large, \"Dr. David Gruber. Ass't. Chief Anesthesiology, Mass. Commonwealth. 'They killed her. And they killed her kid -- Her doctors murdered her.'\" \nThe following figures are written on the pad: $150,000.00 written very large, circled, crossed out. $250,000.00 similarly circled and crossed out. $225,000.00 circled many times. \nGALVIN (voice over; on phone) Well. Well. Well. Finally we're none of us protected... we... we just have to go on. To seek help where we can... and go on... I know that you love her... I know you're acting out of love. \nANGLE - GALVIN ON THE PHONE \nGALVIN (into phone) As soon as I know... you give him my respects too. Not at all. Not at all... Good night. (beat) Well, bless you, too. Good night. \nHe hangs up phone, sighs. Lights a cigarette. Rotates his neck to loosen it up. Reaches to the table next to his bed for the bottle to pour a drink. \nANGLE - INSERT \nHis hand reaching for the bottle. On the table the photo of a very beautiful blonde woman in a silver frame. She is the same woman we saw earlier in the news clip. She is on the deck of a sailboat, laughing. A pile of change on the table, a money clip, a rosary, and the wedding ring in the pile of change. \nANGLE \nGalvin looking at the photo in the silver frame next to his bed. He sighs deeply. Beat. Reaches up to the lamp above his head and turns it off. He sits stiffly in the dark a moment, then lets his head fall back to the chair. \nINT. NORTHERN NURSING HOME WARD - DAY \nGalvin, spruced up a bit, sitting on a bed, his briefcase on his lap. Gazing at the unseen Deborah Ann Kaye in the dark ward. Silent. Beat. He looks in his briefcase, takes out a file. \nANGLE - P.O.V. - INSERT \nThe file, labeled Deborah Ann Kaye. Galvin extracting the photo of the young mother romping with her two children; he takes the yellow legal pad from his briefcase and puts it on top of the picture (the figures crossed out; \"Her doctors murdered her,\" etc.). \nWe hear the door to the ward open and TWO IRISH WOMEN gossiping. \nIRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.) Jimmy, I said, don't you go in your pocket if there's nothing there... \n", "test2_id": 295, "test3_input": "IRISH NURSE #2 (V.O.) ...and what did he say...? \nIRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.) (spies Galvin, her tone changes) ...Sir, you aren't allowed to be in here... \nANGLE \nGalvin sitting on the bed looking at Deborah Ann. He looks up to the speaker. A slovenly Irish Nurse, who has come into the room and is standing by him. The other Nurse is framed in the doorway. Galvin is lost in thought. \nNURSE You can't be in here. \nGALVIN (as if remembering something, simply) I'm her attorney. \nINT. BISHOP BROPHY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe Bishop from the waist up, sitting behind his beautiful desk. Compassionately: \nBISHOP It's a question of continuing values. St. Catherine's -- to do the good that she must do in the community has to maintain the position that she holds in the community. So we have a question of balance. On the one hand, the reputation, and, so, the effectiveness of our hospital, and two of her important doctors -- and, on the other hand, the rights of your client. \nANGLE \nGalvin seated across from the Bishop. A YOUNG PRIEST seated, discreetly, attentively, across the room. Sherry glasses in front of Galvin and the Bishop. Galvin drinking from his. \nBISHOP A young woman. In her prime... deprived of... (searches for a word) ...life... sight... her family... It's tragic. It's a tragic accident. \nGalvin has been dreaming. \nBISHOP ...nothing, of course, can begin to make it right. But we must do what we can. We must do all that we can. \nHe gestures to the Young Priest, who crosses the room, extracts a sheet from a file folder, and places it before Galvin, who is sitting as if in a dream. The Bishop waits a beat, not wanting to interrupt Galvin's reverie, then catches his eye and gestures down at the paper. Galvin glances down. \nINSERT \nThe sheet: \"I, Frank P. Galvin, duly appointed conservator for Deborah Ann Kaye, in consideration of Two Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($210,000.00) paid in hand to me this day by St. Catherine Laboure Hospital do hereby release from any and all claims...\" \nANGLE \nGalvin and the Bishop as before. Galvin finishes reading, looks up. \nBISHOP Yes. We must try to make it right. \nBeat. Galvin nods. Beat. Bishop nods discreetly to the Young Priest who extracts Mount Blanc fountain pen from his pocket, holds it out to Galvin. \nBISHOP It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... (beat) ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture... \nGALVIN How did you settle on the amount? \nBISHOP We thought it was just. \nGALVIN You thought it was just. \nBISHOP Yes. \nGALVIN Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy. \nBISHOP That was our insurance company's recommendation. \nGALVIN Yes. It would be. \nA beat. \nBISHOP Nothing that we can do can make that woman well. \nGALVIN And no one will know the truth. \nBISHOP What is the truth? \nGALVIN That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money. (beat) I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money. (to Young Priest, waving away document) I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser. (beat; pleading for understanding) I can't do it. I can't take it. \nYOUNG PRIEST If we may discuss money, Mr. Galvin. How is your law practice? \nGALVIN It's not too good. I've only got one client. \nHOLD. \nINT. LAWYERS ROOM AND CORRIDOR - DAY \nGalvin, determined, coming down a corridor in the Courthouse, opens a door. CAMERA FOLLOWS him IN. The Lawyers Room. \nTen or twelve AMBULANCE CHASERS waiting for clients. They all look up as he enters, then return to their reading, phones, card games. CAMERA FOLLOWS him TO the corner of the room where MICKEY MORRISSEY is playing Gin with a CRONY. \n", "test3_true": "MICKEY What do you want? \nGALVIN (dragging him up) Come on. Let's get a drink. \nMICKEY (sighs, to partner) Don't touch anything. \nGalvin leads Mickey out of the room. \nINT. FIRST CORRIDOR COURTHOUSE - DAY \nMickey and Galvin silhouetted against a window at the end of the dark corridor, arguing. \nMICKEY (enraged) Are you out of your mind...? \nGALVIN ...I'm going to need your help... \nMICKEY You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand? (beat) Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life? \nGALVIN I'm going to help her. \nMICKEY To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead... \nGALVIN They killed her. And they're trying to buy it... \nMICKEY That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer... \nHe turns away. \nGALVIN Mick. Mick. Mick... \nMICKEY What? \nGALVIN You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...' \nMICKEY I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...? \nYou know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon. \nGALVIN ...he's a good man... \nMICKEY ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case. \nGALVIN ...I have to stand up for her... \nMICKEY Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back. \nGALVIN I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help. (beat) Mick, will you help me...? (beat) Will you help me...? \nINT. CONCANNON OFFICES CORRIDOR --DAY \nA young ATTORNEY in shirt-sleeves and vest racing through a huge, ultra-modern, ultra-successful legal office. The office is near empty. A couple of secretaries are at their desks, a couple of lawyers in their cubicles. The CAMERA FOLLOWS the Attorney tearing through the corridors of the office, up a spiral staircase, through yet more office space, into: \nINT. CONCANNON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \n...a conference room. Mahogany, tinted glass, a panoramic view of Boston. Twenty-five attorneys, male and female, mostly young, gaze at the young Attorney as he enters the room. He stops running. He approaches the front of the room tentatively. Standing at the blackboard in front of the conference room is EDWARD CONCANNON. Senior partner of the firm, late fifties, imposing, he radiates success. As the young Attorney approaches Concannon he is stopped with a gesture. Concannon addresses the room. \nCONCANNON (smiling) Anybody ever hear, 'For want of a shoe a horse was lost?' Who's going on vacation tomorrow? \nA young MAN raises his hand. \nCONCANNON Friedman. St. Barts. is that right? \nFRIEDMAN Yessir. \nCONCANNON (to secretary taking notes at the side of the room) Send Mrs. Friedman a dozen roses tomorrow morning please, Sal. I tell you what, send her a sunlamp. (smiles, there is laughter from the room; to Friedman, sympathetic) I'm sorry, but you'll have to stay. No vacations till this thing is cleared. \nConcannon motions to the young Attorney who has run in. The young Attorney goes to Concannon and hands him a box of chalk. \nConcannon takes a piece and writes on the blackboard \"Jan. 12th.\" He underlines it heavily. \nCONCANNON Our court date is January twelfth. You're all acquainted with this case. It's been scheduled for eighteen months. We have the attorney for the Plaintiff, Frank Galvin -- and I trust you are all familiar with his record -- and we have been expecting him to call us to negotiate. As he did not, and five days before we're supposed to go to court we made him a rather generous offer, which he refused. Five days before the trial. What does this mean? I want to find out. (writes on the blackboard, \"1) Research\") (writes \"2) Homework\") Acquaint yourselves again with the depositions. Don't rely on the fact that we did it last year. Do it again. We're going to review them here, and you do it at home. You each have a full file. Know the deps, and I want you all to be here when we work with the defendants... when is that, Billy...? \nThe young Attorney responds. \nYOUNG LAWYER (BILLY) Tuesday evening, Sir. \nConcannon writes on blackboard \"3) Public Awareness.\" \nCONCANNON I want an article in the Globe As Soon As Possible, 'St. Cat's... Neighborhood Giant serving the community' etc. We've got it in the files. I want something in Monday's Herald: 'Our Gallant Doctors,' something... Be inventive, I want television... (nods toward one of the young lawyers) ...talk to our man at GBH. And to belabor the obvious for a moment... (beat) Our clients are: the Archdiocese of Boston; St. Catherine Laboure Hospital, and Drs. Marx and Towler, two of the most respected men in their profession. The thrust of this defense will be to answer in court, in the press and in the public mind -- to answer the accusation of negligence this completely: not only that we win the case, but that we win the case so that it's seen that the attack on these men and this institution was a rank obscenity. (beat) All right. Let's get the cobwebs off. Billy...? \n", "test3_id": 296}

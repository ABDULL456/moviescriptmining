THIRTY PEOPLE and an inexpensive bier SEEN from the back of the hall. \nANGLE \nA MAN's back FILLS the SCREEN. He is dressed in a black suit; his hands are clasped behind him. ANOTHER MAN stands next to him. The Second Man reaches behind the First Man's back and puts a discreetly folded ten-dollar bill into his hands. \nANGLE \nThese Two Men from the front. Both somber, in their early fifties. They begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral parlor. \nANGLE \nThe WIDOW. A woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier receiving condolences. The Two Men approach her. The First Man (the recipient of the money) speaks: \nFUNERAL DIRECTOR Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a very good friend of ours, and a very fine attorney. \nGALVIN It's a shame about your husband, Mrs. Dee. \nThe Widow nods. \nGALVIN I knew him vaguely through the Lodge. He was a wonderful man. (shakes head in sympathy) It was a crime what happened to him. A crime. If there's anything that I could do to help... \nGALVIN removes a business card from his jacket pocket and hands it to her as if he were giving her money. (i.e., \"Take it. Really. I want you to have it...\" She takes the card. \nBeat. \nGALVIN (thoughtfully realizes he is usurping her time) Well... \nHe shakes her hand and moves on. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nGalvin sitting in the deserted coffee shop in his raincoat. \nReading a section of the paper. He picks up his teacup, drinks. Lowers it to the table. \nANGLE - INSERT \nGalvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops of tea. His hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table. \nHe moves his hand to the paper, open at the obituary section. \nWe SEE several names crossed out. He circles one funeral listing. \nANGLE \nGalvin sitting, raises cup of tea to his lips. Looks around deserted coffee shop. Sighs. \nINT. SECOND FUNERAL HOME AND STREET - AFTERNOON \nGalvin outside a second funeral home. WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE entering, Galvin enters the home. \nANGLE \nGalvin, coming down the aisle toward the front, shrugging himself out of his overcoat, he approaches the BEREAVED WIDOW sitting by the front of the home, he extracts his card from his pocket, starts to speak. He is stopped by the WIDOW'S SON, a hefty man in his mid-forties, who interjects himself between Galvin and the widow. \nSON (of the card) What is that...? \nGALVIN I... \nSON What the hell is that... \nGALVIN ...I was a friend of your fa... \nSON You never knew my father. (hits card out of Galvin's hand) You get out of here, who the hell do you think you are... \nThe FUNERAL MANAGER hurries down the aisle, and starts extricating Galvin from the commotion. \nGALVIN (to Funeral Manager) I'm talking to this man... \nGALVIN ...now who is that...? \nMICKEY ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them... \nGALVIN Sally Doneghy, now who is that? \nMICKEY One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way... \nGALVIN ...hey, I don't need your charity... \nMICKEY ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file. \nGalvin pours himself a drink. \nGALVIN Hey, what are you, my nanny? \nMickey walks to him, knocks the drink out of his hand and slaps him several times in the face. \nMICKEY Listen to me. Listen to me... listen to me, Frank, 'cause I'm done fuckin' with you. I can't do it any more. Look around you: You think that you're going to change? What's going to change it? You think it's going to be different next month? It's going to be the same. And I have to stop. This is it. I got you a good case, it's a moneymaker. You do it right and it will take care of you. But I'm through. I'm sorry, Frank, this is the end. (beat) Life is too short, and I'm too old. (beat) \nMickey walks out of the office. Slams the door. Beat. \nGalvin looks around the office. Goes to his sofa. Sits, reaches to side table. \nANGLE - INSERT \nThe side table, a pack of Luckies. Galvin taking one, his hand shaking a little. Also on side table a pile of change containing a small rosary and a wedding ring. \nINT. GALVIN'S OFFICE ANTEROOM - INSERT - DAY \nThe carriage of a typewriter. A sheet of paper. Its letterhead reads \"Frank P. Galvin. Attorney at Law, 124 State Street, Boston, Mass. 02981. Cable FRAGAL.\" Someone is typing, \"Sorry I had to go out. Back at 10. Judge Geary called. Are you available for lunch Wednesday University Club?\" A hand takes a paper from carriage and puts it on desk. Takes a pen and signs, \"Claire.\" \nANGLE \nGalvin in the anteroom, dressed in his suit, unshaved, having just signed the paper. He takes a piece of Scotch tape from the dispenser on the desk, picks up a file folder from the coffee table. It is torn in several places and rudely Scotch- taped. \nANGLE - P.O.V. - INSERT \nThe file headed Deborah Ann Kaye v. St. Catherine Laboure Hospital et. al. \nANGLE \nGalvin surveys the anteroom, opens door to corridor, Scotch tapes the note he has just typewritten to the outside of the door. \nINT. O'ROURKE'S BAR - DAY \nDark paneling, clean, simple. A drinkers' bar. OLD BARTENDER and THREE CUSTOMERS spaced widely, Galvin in his overcoat downing a shot, the file open before him. He is reading. \nHe checks his watch, scoops the file together under his arm, throws a dollar on the bar, and heads for the door. \nINT. NORTHERN NURSING HOME CORRIDOR - DAY \nGalvin walking tentatively down the corridor of a very rundown nursing home. He receives suspicious looks from the Attendants. He is checking numbers on the doors against a notation in the file. He finds the correct door and enters. \nINT. NURSING HOME WARD - DAY \nThe door to the ward from the inside. Galvin opening the door to the dark ward, backlit, tentative, a little unsteadied from his drinking. He puts his back against the door, puts down file and briefcase, extracts a small cheap Polaroid camera from the briefcase, readies it to shoot, picks up his paraphernalia, and starts off down the ward. As he walks down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each bed. Galvin stops at the foot of one bed and reads the chart. \nANGLE - P.O.V. \nThe chart held by Galvin. DEBORAH ANN KAYE, various medical notations. He lowers the chart and we SEE in the bed beyond it a shriveled, tiny form stuck with needles and tubes. \nANGLE \nGalvin replaces the chart, puts his file, briefcase, etc. on the foot of the bed, takes a flash photo of the figure in the bed. Takes another one. Puts down camera, sits on the end of the bed gazing at the unseen form. He lights a cigarette, and sits looking at her. \nINT. CORRIDOR - GALVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nSALLY DONEGHY. A mousy woman in her forties is standing by a door on which is written, \"Frank P. Galvin. Attorney at Law.\" \nGALVIN I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in? \nSALLY It's locked. \nGALVIN (astonished) It's locked? \nSally Doneghy points to the note on the door. Galvin takes it from the door. Reads. \"Back at 10, Judge Geary. Lunch...\" \nGALVIN I'm terribly sorry... I hope we didn't put you out. Won't you come in...? (motions Sally into inner office, gestures with note) I'd offer you some coffee, but it looks like my girl just went out. \nFrench windows, a fire in the grate, a view of Boston Common, JOSEPH ALITO, a slender, elegant man in his forties dressed in a very expensive suit, reading from his notes, news clippings, etc., which are held in a leather folder. \nALITO 'Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce nineteen sixty as a full partner. Resigned the firm nineteen sixt-ynine over the Lillibridge case...' Do you...? \nAlito, strolling as he reads, moves toward the windows with his file TO REVEAL BISHOP BROPHY, a self-contained man in his early sixties, sitting on a leather couch, listening. \nBISHOP He was accused of jury tampering. \nALITO Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks. \nBISHOP Four cases in three years... \nALITO The man's an ambulance chaser... \nBISHOP ...tell me about this case. \nALITO This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court. \nBISHOP No -- we don't want this case in court. \nALITO Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff. \nBISHOP I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed. \nALITO No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not. \nBISHOP So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me. \nALITO All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial. \nThe Bishop nods, meaning, \"You are dismissed.\" As an afterthought: \nBISHOP If we were to go to trial, would we win the case? \nALITO Well, of course, it's always dangerous... \nBISHOP I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win? \nALITO (in an \"of course\" tone) Yes. \nAlito, preparing to leave, reaches to the Bishop's desk, where he has laid his leather folder. \nANGLE \nThe clipping in the folder, confused Galvin being led into jail, \"Boston Lawyer Held in Jury Tampering Case.\" Alito's hand snaps the folder shut. \nINT. GALVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY \nA man's arms full of textbooks. Prominently displayed: \n\"Methodology and Practice in Anesthesiology.\" The man stops, fumbles for a key in his pocket. \nANGLE \nGalvin, in his overcoat, arms full of books, reading from a textbook and trying to unlock his office door. \nINT. OFFICE \nGalvin entering. CLAIRE PAVONE, a woman in her fifties, at the secretary's desk, hanging up the phone. \nCLAIRE (to phone) Thank you very much. \nGalvin looks up at her in surprise. \nGALVIN What are you doing here? \nCLAIRE Mickey told me to come back to work. \nGalvin nods, proceeds into his office, reading from the textbook. Claire follows him into the office. \nCLAIRE ...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy... \nGALVIN ...yes. Get her on the phone... \nCLAIRE ...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office... \nGALVIN (putting down books) Gruber... \nCLAIRE Mickey told him to call. (reading from notes) 'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.' \nGALVIN The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate... \nGRUBER ...and you're going to do that? \nGALVIN (surprised, of course) Yes. \nGRUBER You're going to settle out of court? \nGruber stops at the bottom of the stairs, beside an exit to the outside. \nGALVIN Yes. \nGRUBER Why? \nA beat. \nGALVIN (it's a meaningless question to him, as if to a child) Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors... \nGRUBER (glances at watch, impatient) Her doctors killed her. \nGALVIN (a beat) I'm sorry...? \nGRUBER Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. (a beat) Her doctors murdered her. \nGALVIN Do you know who her doctors were? \nGRUBER I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were. \nGALVIN The most respected... \nGRUBER (smiling) Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill? \nA beat. Gruber discards end of a cigar. Takes a leather case from his suede jacket, extracts a new cigar. Offers one to Galvin. \nGRUBER You want a cigar? \nGalvin takes one absently. \nGALVIN The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of... \nGRUBER What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...? (checks watch) Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge... \nGalvin, excited, is trying to light the cigar. His hand shakes badly. He has forgotten to bite off the end. He bites it, lights the cigar. \nGALVIN Well, well, when can we meet again. \nI'd like to get a deposition.. \nGRUBER Okay. I'll meet you here. Tuesday night... I gotta go. You going my way? \nGalvin shakes his head. \nEXT. GRUBER'S HOSPITAL PARKING AREA - NIGHT \nGruber opens door and walks out into the cold, into the parking lot, followed by Galvin, who is lighting his cigar. \nGALVIN We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss... \nGRUBER I understand. \nGALVIN ...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony... \nThey stop before a 1950s very beautiful small Mercedes Sedan. \nGruber opens the door, gets into the plush red leather interior, starts car, leaves door open, still talking to Galvin. \nGRUBER Right. Seven o'clock. Here. \nGalvin scribbles information in his appointment book. \nGALVIN Thank you... \nGRUBER ...that's perfectly all right. \nGALVIN (beat) Uh, why, why are you doing this? \nGRUBER (thinks a second) To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it? \nINT. O'ROURKE'S TAVERN - NIGHT \nIRISH NURSE #2 (V.O.) ...and what did he say...? \nIRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.) (spies Galvin, her tone changes) ...Sir, you aren't allowed to be in here... \nANGLE \nGalvin sitting on the bed looking at Deborah Ann. He looks up to the speaker. A slovenly Irish Nurse, who has come into the room and is standing by him. The other Nurse is framed in the doorway. Galvin is lost in thought. \nNURSE You can't be in here. \nGALVIN (as if remembering something, simply) I'm her attorney. \nINT. BISHOP BROPHY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe Bishop from the waist up, sitting behind his beautiful desk. Compassionately: \nBISHOP It's a question of continuing values. St. Catherine's -- to do the good that she must do in the community has to maintain the position that she holds in the community. So we have a question of balance. On the one hand, the reputation, and, so, the effectiveness of our hospital, and two of her important doctors -- and, on the other hand, the rights of your client. \nANGLE \nGalvin seated across from the Bishop. A YOUNG PRIEST seated, discreetly, attentively, across the room. Sherry glasses in front of Galvin and the Bishop. Galvin drinking from his. \nBISHOP A young woman. In her prime... deprived of... (searches for a word) ...life... sight... her family... It's tragic. It's a tragic accident. \nGalvin has been dreaming. \nBISHOP ...nothing, of course, can begin to make it right. But we must do what we can. We must do all that we can. \nHe gestures to the Young Priest, who crosses the room, extracts a sheet from a file folder, and places it before Galvin, who is sitting as if in a dream. The Bishop waits a beat, not wanting to interrupt Galvin's reverie, then catches his eye and gestures down at the paper. Galvin glances down. \nINSERT \nThe sheet: \"I, Frank P. Galvin, duly appointed conservator for Deborah Ann Kaye, in consideration of Two Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($210,000.00) paid in hand to me this day by St. Catherine Laboure Hospital do hereby release from any and all claims...\" \nANGLE \nGalvin and the Bishop as before. Galvin finishes reading, looks up. \nBISHOP Yes. We must try to make it right. \nBeat. Galvin nods. Beat. Bishop nods discreetly to the Young Priest who extracts Mount Blanc fountain pen from his pocket, holds it out to Galvin. \nBISHOP It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... (beat) ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture... \nGALVIN How did you settle on the amount? \nBISHOP We thought it was just. \nGALVIN You thought it was just. \nBISHOP Yes. \nGALVIN Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy. \nBISHOP That was our insurance company's recommendation. \nGALVIN Yes. It would be. \nA beat. \nBISHOP Nothing that we can do can make that woman well. \nGALVIN And no one will know the truth. \nBISHOP What is the truth? \nGALVIN That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money. (beat) I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money. (to Young Priest, waving away document) I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser. (beat; pleading for understanding) I can't do it. I can't take it. \nYOUNG PRIEST If we may discuss money, Mr. Galvin. How is your law practice? \nGALVIN It's not too good. I've only got one client. \nHOLD. \nINT. LAWYERS ROOM AND CORRIDOR - DAY \nGalvin, determined, coming down a corridor in the Courthouse, opens a door. CAMERA FOLLOWS him IN. The Lawyers Room. \nTen or twelve AMBULANCE CHASERS waiting for clients. They all look up as he enters, then return to their reading, phones, card games. CAMERA FOLLOWS him TO the corner of the room where MICKEY MORRISSEY is playing Gin with a CRONY. \nThe clock reads 10:12. \nANGLE \nGalvin downs his drink, picks his briefcase off of the bar and starts for the door. \nINT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS-DAY \nJUDGE SWEENEY, a florid man in his sixties, sitting in shirtsleeves eating bacon and eggs off of a hotel service on a tray, talking conspiratorially with Ed Concannon, who is drinking coffee, seated across the desk. They are obviously old friends. The sound of a door opening. They turn their heads to the door. \nANGLE - P.O.V. \nGalvin standing in the door. \nJUDGE (V.O.) You're late, Mr. Galvin. \nHe enters the room. CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he sits next to Concannon. \nGALVIN Yessir. I'm sorry. \nJUDGE Why is that? \nGALVIN I was held up. \nConcannon smiles and extends his hand. \nCONCANNON Ed Concannon. \nGALVIN (shaking his head) Frank Galvin. We've met before. \nAs the Judge starts to speak Galvin cannot help looking at Concannon out of the corner of his eye. \nJUDGE Let's do some business. \nANGLE - P.O.V. GALVIN \nConcannon, brisk, expensive-looking, tanned, huge gold watch, custom-made suit. \nJUDGE (V.O.) They tell me that no bargain ever was completed other than quickly when both parties really cared to make a deal. \nConcannon feels Galvin's eye on him, half-turns, smiles. \nANGLE - THE JUDGE, CONCANNON, GALVIN \nJUDGE Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother. \nGALVIN This is a complicated case, your Honor... \nJUDGE I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? (smiles at Galvin) See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? \nGALVIN My client can't walk, your Honor. \nJUDGE I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you. \nCONCANNON Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars. \nJUDGE Huh! \nCONCANNON My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. (beat) When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. (turns to Galvin) As long as you understand that. (beat) It's got to be that way. \nGALVIN We are going to try the case. \nA beat. Galvin fumbles for a cigarette. The three sit in silence. \nJUDGE (incredulous) That's it...? (beat) Come on, guys... life is too short... (beat) You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it. (beat; turns to Galvin) Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records. \nGALVIN ...things change. \nJUDGE ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... \nGALVIN I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro... \nJUDGE And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. (beat) I myself would take it and run like a thief. \nGALVIN I'm sure you would. \nThe Judge turns, unbelieving that Galvin has patronized and insulted him. He controls himself. \nJUDGE Hm. (beat; checking book) We have the date set? Next Thursday. Good. (smiles) See you boys in court. \nSnow falling. Galvin standing outside, having just rung the bell. The door is opened by a gangly teen-age boy. CAMERA FOLLOWS Galvin into... \nINT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n...the hall of the house. The boy motions toward a closed sliding door and then goes into the living room opposite. \nGalvin hangs up his coat on the hall coat rack, we hear the boy resume the practice of a passage of Chopin on the piano. \nGalvin knocks on the sliding door. \nJUDGE (O.S.) Yes? \nGalvin opens the door and goes into the Judge's darkened study. The Judge is watching a basketball game on TV, drinking a beer. CAMERA FOLLOWS Galvin into the room. \nJUDGE What is it? \nGALVIN Thank you for seeing me. \nJUDGE That's perfectly all right. \nJudge turns down the volume of the game, but keeps watching it. \nGALVIN I need an extension for my case. \nJUDGE You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared. \nGALVIN I had a witness disappear on me. \nJUDGE That happens. \nGALVIN I could subpoena him if I had a week. \nJUDGE I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you. \nJudge leans forward, turns up the volume on the game. \nEXT. STREET - GALVIN - PHONE - NIGHT \nLONG SHOT of cars whooshing in the snow past a lonely street corner. A MAN at an open telephone stand. The sound of the telephone on the far end ringing. \nANGLE \nGalvin at the stand, shivering in the cold, talking on the phone. An open note pad in his bare hand. \nVOICE Continental Casualty... \nGALVIN Mr. Alito, please. \nVOICE Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch... \nGALVIN I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number? \nVOICE I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed... \nGALVIN ...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him... \nVOICE I can't guarantee that... \nGALVIN I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent. \nINT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nGalvin is sitting at his desk, a stack of files piled on his desk, he is sorting through them looking for something. The phone rings, he snatches it up. \nGALVIN (into phone) Hello. Yes. Thank you for calling. Frank Galvin... I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye...? I'd like to discuss your firm's offer of the two hundred th... In the sense that I feel that we'd like to accept it. (beat) Well, it's rather a shock to me, too; but it's my client's wishes... She's changed her mind as of this evening... I must say that I tried to dissuade her... \nHe wipes his sweating forehead, he hears the sound of his office door opening, he looks up. \nANGLE - P.O.V. \nMickey opening the front door to the office, carrying an armful of lawbooks, and a couple of files, he turns on the lights in the anteroom, and we SEE that he is surprised to see Galvin in the office. \nANGLE - GALVIN \nOn the phone. \nGALVIN ...Well, she, on the eve of the case...

Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is? \nMARY ROONEY No. \nGALVIN He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what? \nMARY ROONEY ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me? \nGALVIN I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big... \nMARY ROONEY I've got nothing to say to you. \nGALVIN You know what happened. \nDR. THOMPSON I am on the staff of... \nMICKEY Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say... \nDR. THOMPSON ...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I... \nMickey drops his belligerent attitude.

THOMPSON Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I... \nMICKEY (grilling him again) Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means? \nDR. THOMPSON 'Code Blue'... \nMICKEY It's a common medical term. \nMickey half-turns to Galvin, shrugs minutely, meaning, \"We're in trouble.\" \nINT.

(beat) I thought it's not over till the jury comes in. \nGALVIN Who told you that? \nLAURA You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place. \nGALVIN And what makes you so tough? \nLAURA Maybe I'll tell you later. \nGALVIN Is there going to be a later...? \nLAURA Not if you don't grow up... \nGALVIN If I don't 'grow up...' \nANGLE - CLOSEUP \nGALVIN at Plaintiff's table, looking down at notes. \nJUDGE Is the Plaintiff ready? \nGALVIN (looking up) Ready, your Honor. \nJUDGE Defense...? \nCONCANNON Ready for the Defense, your Honor. \nANGLE \nThe Courtroom.

Exhales. \nGALVIN It's a terrible thing to sit in judgment. So much rides on it. I know that you've thought, 'How can I be pure. How can I be impartial without being cold. How can I be merciful and still be just?' And I know that most of you have said some sort of prayer this morning to be helped. To judge correctly. We have the reputation of two men. Two well respected doctors and a renowned hospital before us. And with those two respected men we have my client, Deborah Ann Kaye... (beat) ...who was deprived of sight, of locomotion, hearing, speech, of everything, in short, which constitutes her life. (beat) We are going to prove she was deprived through negligence.

Concannon consulting his notes. \nCONCANNON Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct? \nDR. THOMPSON That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion. \nCONCANNON Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today? \nDR. THOMPSON Just as you are, Sir... \nCONCANNON Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor? \nDR. THOMPSON No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State... \nCONCANNON ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine? \nDR. THOMPSON No. \nCONCANNON Neurology? \nDR. THOMPSON No. \nJUDGE Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question? \nDR. THOMPSON I... given the limits of your question, that's correct. \nJUDGE The Doctors were not negligent. \nDR. THOMPSON (beat) I... um... \nThe Judge shrugs, meaning, \"Well then what in the hell are we doing here?\" \nANGLE \nGalvin, furious. \nANGLE \nThe Judge and Witness. \nJUDGE Thank you. \nThe Witness starts to step down. Galvin strides over to him and speaks to the Judge. \nGALVIN I'm not through with the witness, your Honor. With all due respect if you are going to try my case for me I would appreciate it if you wouldn't lose it. \nThe Judge stands, furious. \nJUDGE Thank you. I think that's enough for this morning. I'll see the Plaintiff's Counsel in my chambers. Now, please. \nThe Courtroom rises. The Bailiff is heard, \"All rise, court is adjourned until one o'clock.\" \nINT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS - DAY \nGalvin, furious, standing against the wall. The Judge comes in from his own entrance, shucking his robe. Equally angry. \nJUDGE I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today. \nGALVIN I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me. \nJUDGE Listen to me, fella... \nGALVIN No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair. \nGalvin is pacing. Beat. \nJUDGE (conciliatory) Galvin, look, many years ago... \nGALVIN And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are. \nJUDGE (beat; barely controlling anger) Are you done? \nGALVIN Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass. \nJUDGE You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail. \nINT.

What do you do when you don't have a witness? \nMICKEY (reciting a catechism; dispiritedly) You use their witness. \nGALVIN That's right. \nMICKEY I think we tried that. The case is over. \nGalvin continues pacing. He will not hear what was just said. \nMICKEY And how the fuck... You broke the first law that they taught you in law school. You never ask a question you don't know the answer to. (beat) Frankie, wake up. You got your own expert witness says there was no negligence. It's over. Period. There'll be no other cases... \nGalvin turns on him, animal-like. \nGALVIN There are no other cases. This is the case. (beat) Now you decide... (beat) Are you in or out...? \nINT.

He said, 'They don't pay you to do your best. They pay you to win.' (beat) That's what pays for this office. (beat) And that's what pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor. And for the kind of law that you want to practice. And that's what pays for your clothes and my whiskey, and the leisure that we have to sit back and discuss philosophy. (beat) As we're doing tonight. (beat) We're paid to win the case. \nANGLE - CONCANNON AND LAURA \nLaura sitting across from him, impassive. \nCONCANNON You finished your marriage.

We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form. \nJUDGE ...one moment, Mr. Concannon... \nThe Judge nods, meaning, \"I am considering...\" \nANGLE \nThe Judge.

(explains to them) It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original... \nCONCANNON Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here. \nJUDGE I'm going to uphold that. \nANGLE \nGalvin getting to his feet. \nGALVIN I object, your Honor... \nJUDGE Overruled... \nGALVIN Exception! \nJUDGE Noted. Thank you. (to Jury) Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed... \nANGLE \nGalvin, silent, fuming, sitting at the table. \nJUDGE (V.O.)

Beat. \nGALVIN You know, so much of the time we're lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us what is right. Tell us what's true. There is no justice. The rich win, the poor are powerless...' We become tired of hearing people lie. After a time we become dead. A little dead. We start thinking of ourselves as victims. (pause) And we become victims. (pause) And we become weak... and doubt ourselves, and doubt our institutions... and doubt our beliefs... we say for example, 'The law is a sham... there is no law... I was a fool for having believed there was.' (beat) But today you are the law. You are the law... And not some book and not the lawyers, or the marble statues and the trappings of the court... all that they are is symbols. (beat) Of our desire to be just... (beat) All that they are, in effect, is a prayer... (beat) ...a fervent, and a frightened prayer. \nGALVIN In my religion we say, 'Act as if you had faith, and faith will be given to you.' (beat) If... If we would have faith in justice, we must only believe in ourselves. (beat) And act with justice. (beat) And I believe that there is justice in our hearts.

This is the point. \nMICKEY You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. \nGALVIN Admittance form is wrong. \nMICKEY Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. \nGALVIN I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... \nMICKEY (conceding) ...Gruber's not bad. \nGALVIN Not bad...?

O'ROURKE'S - NIGHT (LATER) \nGalvin and Laura are in a booth. The remains of a dinner and drinks around them. They are both smoking cigarettes, intent on each other. Both a little drunk. \nGALVIN The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink? \nLAURA I think I will. \nGalvin motions \"another round\" to the bartender. \nGALVIN Jimmy! (beat) That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice. \nLAURA And are they going to get it? \nGALVIN They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...' \nLAURA Maybe what? \nGALVIN (beat) Maybe I can do something right. \nLAURA And is that what you're going to do? (a beat) Is that what you're going to do...? \nGALVIN That's what I'm going to try to do. \nINT. GALVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe bedroom, dark, sound of people moving, the bedside light is flicked on. We SEE Galvin in shirt-sleeves, holding a whiskey glass a little unsettled, turning on the light, Laura, with a glass, also a bit unsteady, standing beside him. \nBoth awkward. He looks at her, turns back to the bed, turns down the bed, sees the silver-framed picture of his wife, he looks back at Laura, starts to take the picture to turn it down. \nLAURA That's all right. \nShe starts taking off her blouse. \nINT.

See you tomorrow in the office. \nMickey shrugs. \nGALVIN We're doing fine. \nANGLE \nThe two of them crossing the lobby. \nDick Doneghy, looking around the lobby, spies them, starts across, and accosts Galvin. \nDONEGHY You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? (pushes Galvin into a wall; advances; pushes him again) Who do you think you are...? \nGALVIN Hold on a second. \nDONEGHY I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did? \nHe pushes Galvin again. Galvin waves Mickey off. \nGALVIN It's all right, Mickey. \nDONEGHY You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours... (pushes Galvin again) You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years. (beat) Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister. \nGALVIN I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case... \nDONEGHY What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred... \nGALVIN I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars. \nDONEGHY You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives. \nHe nods sadly to himself. Beat. \nGALVIN If I could accept the offer right now, I would. (beat) They took it back. \nDONEGHY I understand. (starts to walk away from Galvin; stops) I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred. \nINT. O'ROURKE'S PUB - NIGHT \nLaura is sitting in the same place at the bar. Mickey comes up to her. \nMICKEY Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other. \nLAURA How'm I doing so far? \nMICKEY So far you're great. You got a cigarette? \nLaura opens her purse, starts hunting for a cigarette. \nLAURA What are you drinking? (hands him cigarettes, smiles, calls the Bartender) Jimmy...? \nINT. GRUBER'S HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nGalvin walks up to a door marked Doctors Only. He opens his briefcase, takes out the box of Macanudo Cigars, smiles to himself, walks inside. \nINT.

Stops outside of a very lovely brownstone with a small brass plaque. The plaque: Dr. David C. Gruber.

GRUBER'S HOUSE & STREET - NIGHT \nGalvin getting out of a taxi, rushing up the steps of a brownstone. Peeps through the window on the side of the house. Dark. He grabs the brass knocker. Pounds. Nothing, he pounds again. Nothing. He is beaten. He is without resource. He starts vacantly down the stairs. The door behind him is opened. He turns. \nANGLE - P.O.V. \nA middle-aged black WOMAN in livery. \nMAID What is it? \nGalvin in the steps speaking with her. \nGALVIN Dr. Gruber. \nMAID Dr. Gruber's not in. \nGALVIN I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting... \nMAID He's not in, Sir. \nGALVIN Where is he? \nShe hesitates. She has been instructed not to say. Galvin starts up the steps. \nGALVIN I... please.

(beat) If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number... \nGalvin turns away from the door. He is still clutching the box of cigars unconsciously. \nINT. O'ROURKE'S - NIGHT \nMickey and Laura. Positions unchanged, at the bar. Somewhat progressed toward a convivial drunkenness \nMICKEY Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is? \nLAURA Should I? \nMICKEY A huge law firm. Okay?

Okay...? \nLAURA Yes. \nMICKEY ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy. (beat) Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case. \nLAURA The Big Boy did...? \nMICKEY That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out. \nLAURA Huh. \nMICKEY Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.

JUDGE SWEENEY'S HOUSE-NIGHT \n", "test3_input": "She is traumatized by the question. The casual conversation has become immediate and painful.

Galvin looks up, surprised. \nGALVIN What the hell are you doing here? \nMICKEY We got to talk. \nHe is moving Galvin off down the sidewalk, away from the Hotel. CAMERA STAYS STILL, and their voices get fainter as they move away. \nGALVIN What are you doing in New York...? \nMICKEY Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee... \nThey continue walking. We cannot hear them. Galvin is becoming agitated. He stops Mickey, stands there, Mickey very sad, Galvin incredulous, talking to him. Mickey nods. \nGalvin starts hurriedly back down the street toward the Hotel. \nINT. NEW YORK HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY \nLONG SHOT of Laura seated at a table alone. \nANGLE \nGalvin at the entrance to the restaurant looking at her.

We SEE her back, and Galvin approaching. We SEE her shoulders droop, beaten. He draws closer. Galvin comes up to her, his face a mask of pain and confusion. She sighs, starts to speak. Stops. Beat. They look at each other -- he starts to speak, cannot. He knocks her to the floor, she upsets the table. A large man at the next table starts to restrain Galvin. \nLAURA (as if in shock) It's all right... it's all right... it's all right... it's all right... \nINT.

He enters the frame carrying a bottle of booze, goes through door into study. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS HIM INTO THE ROOM. THE TV: \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) The Knicks are pressing hard... (etc.) \nHe sits on a sofa opposite the television. Watches the game a beat. Opens the fresh bottle of whiskey and pours a large shot into the almost-empty glass in front of him. Looks to his left. Reaches behind him to some glasses on a shelf, takes one down, pours drink into the new glass, leans to his left, CAMERA MOVES WITH him, and we SEE Galvin sitting in a deep leather armchair, staring.

COURTROOM -- JUDGE'S P.O.V. - DAY \nHalf full of spectators. \nANGLE \nGalvin gets up from Plaintiff's table, takes up a large book as Dr. Towler takes the stands. He reads: \nGALVIN Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar? \nDR. TOWLER Yes. I wrote it. \nGalvin shows the book. \nGALVIN 'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct? \nDR. TOWLER I. Yes. It is. \nGALVIN And you wrote that... \nDR. TOWLER Yes. \nGALVIN (reading) ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask? \nDR. TOWLER She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission. \nGALVIN If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...? \nDR. TOWLER Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case. \nGALVIN Thank you. \nGalvin signals he is done. The Judge signals Dr. Towler to leave the stand, which he does. \nJUDGE Mr. Concannon...? \nCONCANNON Nothing further, your Honor. \nJUDGE Mr. Galvin, rebuttal? \nGALVIN (to Bailiff) Katherine Price. \nThe Bailiff calls out her name. \nBAILIFF Katherine Price... \nANGLE \nKathy at the back of the court, coming down the aisle. As she passes the Defendant's table, Towler grabs Marx and starts whispering frantically. Concannon looks on, ignorant of what is happening. We hear Dr. Towler's \"Oh, my God...\" \nANGLE \nGalvin surveys the courtroom, Kathy crosses in front of him, takes the stand, we hear the Bailiff administering the formula as we WATCH Galvin turn and look at the Jurors. \nBAILIFF (V.O.) State your name please. \nKATHY (V.O.) Katherine Lynn Price. \nBAILIFF D'you swear that the evidence you are about to give will be the truth, the... \nANGLE \nThe Bailiff swearing in Kathy. \n"}

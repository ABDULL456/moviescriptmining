CLIVE It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily in this situation Graham and I would be looking up at the stars, wondering about life on other planets but we know now, don't we? It's a bit of an anti-climax. 
PAUL Thanks a bunch, Hurley. 
CLIVE I don't mean that in a bad way. They all scratch their noses. 
GRAHAM Paul, can I ask you something? 
PAUL Shoot. 
GRAHAM Why are you in such a hurry to leave? 
PAUL I've outlived my usefulness. 
CLIVE How so? 
PAUL There's only so much knowledge I can share about the universe and quantum theory and how to make a really nice meatball sandwich. The only thing I have to offer them now are my abilities. 
GRAHAM So? 
PAUL So the only way they're going to get hold of them is by obtaining some of somatic stem cells. 
GRAHAM So what, do they take a swab from your cheek? 
PAUL Negative. 
CLIVE Stool? 
PAUL Sadly, not that simple. 
GRAHAM Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles. 
PAUL Believe me, a needle would be a picnic compared to what they had in store for me. 
CLIVE I don't follow. 
PAUL Stem cells are multipotent. GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank. 
PAUL Lineage defined? GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank. 
PAUL (CONT'D) The camouflage response, the memory transfer, the revivification, they all originate in my cerebellum. In order to cultivate them in a laboratory they would have to... 
GRAHAM/CLIVE Cut your brain out. 
PAUL Bingo! Fortunately, someone was kind enough to give me the heads up, if you'll pardon the pun. So, when they were transferring me to the medical facility and I noticed the bumper sticker on your RV, I figured you might be sympathetic types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed the wheel and took my chance. 
CLIVE I thought the crash was our fault. 
PAUL Well it was, kinda. 
GRAHAM So, you're saying if they catch you... PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads. 
PAUL So tell me, are you guys virgins or what? 
GRAHAM/CLIVE No. They all cough. 
PAUL Alright then, Clive, when was the last time you got laid. 
CLIVE Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick. 
PAUL Three years ago you had sex with a midget? 
CLIVE She was an Ewok! Sniff. 
PAUL There are only two types of person small enough to fit inside an Ewok costume. 
CLIVE She was a midget. 
PAUL I can't believe you thought boning a space bear sounded less embarrassing than a person of short stature. 
CLIVE I know. I'm sorry. 
PAUL Was it nice? 
CLIVE 
WONDERFUL 
PAUL You sly dog! PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.

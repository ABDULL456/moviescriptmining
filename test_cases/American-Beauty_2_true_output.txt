Lester, Carolyn and Jane are eating dinner by CANDLELIGHT. RED ROSES are bunched in a vase at the center of the table. Nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody else's presence, until... 
JANE Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music? 
CAROLYN (considers) No. No, we don't. As soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that I'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like. 
A long beat. Lester suddenly turns to Jane. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LESTER So Janie, how was school? 
JANE (suspicious) It was okay. 
LESTER Just okay? 
JANE No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular. 
A beat. 
LESTER Well, you want to know how things went at my job today? 
Now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind. 
LESTER (CONT'D) They've hired this efficiency expert, this really friendly guy named Brad, how perfect is that? And he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they? No, no, that would be too... honest. And so they've asked us-- (off her look) --you couldn't possibly care any less, could you? 
Carolyn is watching this closely. 
JANE (uncomfortable) Well, what do you expect? You can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day. 
She gets up and heads toward the kitchen. 
JANE (CONT'D) I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken to me for months. 
She's gone. Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically. 
LESTER Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You treat her like an employee. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CAROLYN (taken aback) What?! 
Lester is quiet, staring at his plate. 
CAROLYN (CONT'D) (more authority) What? 
Lester gets up and starts after Jane, taking his plate with him. 
LESTER I'm going to get some ice cream. 
Carolyn watches him go, irritated. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Jane stands at the sink, rinsing off her plate. Lester enters. 
LESTER Honey, I'm sorry. I... 
Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish. 
LESTER (CONT'D) I'm sorry I haven't been more available, I just... I'm... 
He's looking to her for a little help here, but she's too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any. 
LESTER (CONT'D) (finally) You know, you don't always have to wait for me to come to you... 
JANE Oh, great. So now it's my fault? 
LESTER I didn't say that. It's nobody's fault. Janie, what happened? You and I used to be pals. 
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
On VIDEO: We're looking through GREENHOUSE WINDOWS at Lester and Jane in the kitchen We can't hear what they're saying, but it's obvious it's not going well.

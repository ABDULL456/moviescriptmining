BEN (interrupting) I'm sure she would be glad to... wouldn't you dear? 
JO Well, I don't know.     It's been some time... 
PRIME MINISTER I beg you, Madame. A tranquil coda to conclude a dramatic evening! 
JO All right.   I'm very flattered. 
AMBASSADOR (To butler) Stanis would you put up some chairs quickly. (To guests) Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us tonight...Jo Conway...the famous Jo Conway...she has graciously consented to sing for us .. (To his wife) Darling would you see that the Prime Minister has a very good seat. 
They move off to seats -- Jo is led to piano by Ambassador. Aide crosses to Ben. 
AIDE Would you like to sit down, sir? 
BEN No...I'll just stand over here.

Discreetly, Ben moves away from the group, and over toward a side wall, the CAMERA PANNING HIM. All eyes are on Jo. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Jo adjusts herself at the piano. Her face seems serious. She looks up briefly with her eyes to check where Ben is. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT 
The people in the hallway, realizing there is to be more entertainment, move toward the main room.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Ben watches Jo, and at the same time seems to be lookIng around the room, particularly toward the various exits. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays the introduction to her song. We see the great tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place that she has become so professional in such an intimate drawing room setting. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - FULL SHOT 
Everyone in the ballroom is listening intently, and with surprise, at her singing.

The hallway, showing people crowded at the door, listening. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT 
The first landing on the flight of stairs above the hallway. No one is around. Jo's voice loses some of its volume. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT 
A higher stairway landing. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
A second floor corridor, deserted.    Jo's voice fading. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
A door at the end of the corridor. We now hear the song floating up clearly, but much diminished.

In a room on the other side of the door, Hank McKenna is listening to the music. Hank seems a little puzzled. Then, his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his feet. He runs towards the door and begins trying to open it. 
HANK That's my Mother's voice!    That's my Mother singing! 
Mrs. Drayton is quite startled by Hank's performance. 
MRS. DRAYTON Hank -- are you sure? Are you really sure? 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Hank turns around at the doorway, to look at Mrs. Drayton. 
HANK That's her!    I know it!

Mrs Drayton's face, still awed by what she has heard. 
MRS. DRAYTON What is she doing here? 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Hank, a little mystified, has no answer. He walks slowly back into the room, towards Mrs. Drayton, listening and thinking about what he hears. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
Mrs. Drayton's face shows a new and dangerous thought coming into it. She looks down at Hank. 
MRS. DRAYTON Hank? -- can you whistle that song? 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
He looks at her and nods abstractedly. 
HANK I guess so. 
She kneels down quickly to him. 
MRS DRAYTON Then go on -- whistle it.   Whistle it as loud as you can. 
On Hank's face comes a little understanding. He can barely believe what she means. Then he understands. He turns, and deliberately facing the door, starts to whistle the song. He whistles loud and vigorously. Mrs. Drayton stands up and moves back to a chair, as she watches him. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
Down in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for the straining ears of Jo. She looks across the ballroom to find Ben, and her eyes go up.

Huge, powerful, pale bodies have been ploughed purple with rake marks, bruises and roasties. Plus, one dark body -- that of CHESTER WILLIAMS, a skilled wing from the Cape, a reserved and private man. \nPienaar takes off his green and gold jersey, sits, begins taking off his cleats. His body hurts. He has been raked, scratched, bruised, and his ankle is swollen. \nA noble warrior, defeated. \nBOLAND BOTHA (V.O.) Francois Pienaar's team came to Loftus Versfeld stadium this afternoon, unprepared and arrogant. \nINT. TV STUDIO \nMeet BOLAND BOTHA as he tapes his commentary on the test match. He is an ex-Springbok player from the boycott years, now turned ponderous, florid rugby commentator. He is a household name, and the last word on the state of the Springboks. \nBOLAND BOTHA They left 80 minutes later with their tails between their legs, like whipped mongrels. (BEAT) And I, for one, am glad. Not because we lost, but because there's now no way to disguise the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared to reenter the world of top-notch international rugby. \nBoland defines the South African talent for pessimism and negativity. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SA RUGBY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nBOLAND BOTHA (ON TV) The Rugby World Cup is now less than a year away, and I, for one, am relieved that we are the host nation, and therefore qualify automatically for the tournament. Because I'm not sure we would get in on merit alone. \nThe Rugby President sucks on a rum and coke, watches Boland with one of his HENCHMEN. \nRUGBY PRESIDENT Who gets the axe? Someone has to. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRANCOIS PIENAAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNo after-match party this night. Still depressed by the loss, Pienaar stays home with this fiancee NERINE. \nBOLAND BOTHA (ON TV) Pienaar's team played without discipline, without strategy and without courage. \nPIENAAR He's trying to get them to drop me. \nNERINE He's just bitter because the Springboks were boycotted when he played. \nPIENAAR Maybe, but people listen to what he says. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWearing pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers, Mandela multi- tasks, watching Boland Botha and going through a pile of correspondence, scribbling notes or signing his name. \nBOLAND BOTHA (ON TV) They brought shame upon our nation, and I, for one, can say without fear of contradiction, that today, these fifteen so-called men did not deserve to wear the hallowed green and gold. \nON MANDELA: a thought, an idea -- a big one -- is churning in his head. He grunts, turns off the TV, puts the correspondence aside, stands. \nMary enters with a glass of milk and some pills, on a tray. \nMARY Here's your muti. I warmed the milk tonight. \nMANDELA You're too good to me. \nMandela takes his pills. \nMARY Your daughter called, to cancel her visit this weekend. \nMandela pauses, between pills. \nMANDELA Did she say why? \nMARY No, she didn't. (making it up) She said to tell you she was sorry. \nMandela nods, has a hard time swallowing his last pill. \nMARY Do you need anything else tonight? \nMANDELA No, thank you. I'm going to bed. Good night. \nMARY Good night, Madiba. Sleep well. \nMandela smiles at her, but as soon as he is past her, the smile fades. As he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, his face becomes sadder and older and lonelier. \nIN HIS BEDROOM, Mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown. He looks at his bed. It is as smooth and as blank as a sheet of paper. \nHe peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch. He switches off the light and lies down, still and straight. \nThe most popular man in the world starts and ends each day alone. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY \nA very poor township outside Johannesburg. A stark reminder of how much work Mandela has ahead of him. A STAMPEDE OF KIDS runs by. \nWe FOLLOW THE KIDS and find a SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH. A noisy LINE OF THREADBARE KIDS leads from outside into the church. There is a pecking order in the line, based on size. \nMRS. COLEMAN (O.S.) No pushing now! There's enough for everybody! \nINT. SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH - DAY \nAt a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of second-hand clothes under the watchful eye of MRS. COLEMAN, a stout and charitable woman. Next to her, MRS. DLAMINI hands out a lollipop and says -- \nMRS. DLAMINI God bless you. \n-- to each kid. The clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm kept by Mrs. Dlamini's \"God bless yous\". \nThe last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids reduces until there is only ONE SMALL BOY (SIPHO) left and only one article of clothing. An old SPRINGBOK RUGBY PRACTISE JERSEY. Green and gold. \nSipho could use it. His clothes are more holes than anything else. He looks at the Springbok jersey mournfully. \nMRS. COLEMAN You're a very lucky boy. It's a real Springbok practise jersey! It's a bit big, but it's warm and it'll last for ever! \nSipho shakes his head. \nMRS. COLEMAN It's yours, take it!

EERSTERUST CONFERENCE CENTER - DAY \nEersterust is a settlement and conference location just outside Pretoria. \nToday it is the location of a full membership meeting of the National Sports Council, an ANC organization that is now the governing body of all sports in South Africa. \nA banner draped across the conference center entrance tells us so: WELCOME NATIONAL SPORTS COUNCIL. \nINT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY \nAn NSC FIREBRAND has the podium and the microphone. \nNSC FIREBRAND ... and now for the next item on our agenda. \nThe hall is jammed. Very few white faces. \nNSC FIREBRAND The NSC executive proposes a full membership vote on the following motion ... \nA ripple of anticipation goes through the delegates. \nNSC FIREBRAND ... that as a prominent symbol of the apartheid era, the colors, emblem and name of the Springboks be eliminated immediately ... \nThat causes a stir. The delegates understand how big this is. \nNSC FIREBRAND ... and that all sports teams representing South Africa shall be known forthwith as the Proteas. \nExcitement and noise level rises. The NSC Firebrand has to shout through his mike. \nNSC FIREBRAND (SHOUTING) We will submit this motion to a hand vote. (MORE) \nNSC FIREBRAND (cont'd) In the event of a close count, we will go to a written ballot. (the moment he's been WAITING FOR) ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF ELIMINATING THE SPRINGBOKS, RAISE YOUR HANDS. \nThe NSC firebrand shoots his clenched fist into the air. With a roar, the delegates respond, raising their fists. Unanimous. The Springboks are history. \nANOTHER ANGLE, as ONE OF THE OLDER DELEGATES steps outside to make a call. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY \nAt his desk, Mandela puts down his phone. Anger in his eyes. He slams both palms down hard on his desk. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nBoth bodyguard units (minus Jason) are crammed into the small office. The black bodyguards murmur amongst themselves in Xhosa. (Ad-lib.) The white bodyguards talk Afrikaans (ad- lib). \nNo talk between the two units, only tension. \nTension broken with a crash as JASON SLAMS THE DOOR OPEN. \nJASON Both units to the cars, right now. \nEXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY \nGrey BMW, armored grey Mercedes, grey BMW in a line at the entrance. \nJason, Kwezi, Winston and Sam scramble out of the building and dive into the lead BMW. \nEtienne, Hendrick, George and Willem dive into the trailer. \nINT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY \nBrusque, scowling, Mandela marches towards the exit, shadowed by Linga, flanked by Barbara. \nBARBARA What do I tell the Japanese trade delegation? \nMANDELA I delegate that decision to you. \nBARBARA Do you want me to inform the VP? \nMANDELA No. \nBARBARA We should at least include the Minister of Sport. \nMANDELA No. \nMandela heads out to the cars. Barbara has no choice but to follow. \nEXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY \nEver the gentleman, Mandela ushers Barbara into the Mercedes. As she gets in: \nBARBARA I strongly advise against doing this. Especially on your own. It ... it gives the impression of autocratic leadership. \nINT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY \nMandela gets in, closes the door. \nBARBARA You risk alienating your cabinet and your party. \nMANDELA Your advice is duly noted, Barbara. \nBARBARA Madiba ... the people want this. They hate the Springboks. They don't want to be represented by a team they cheered against all their lives. \nMANDELA Yes, I know. But in this instance the people are wrong. And it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that. \nMandela leans forward to talk to Linga. \nMANDELA Can you tell the boys that Madiba wants to go to Eersterust, very fast. \nLinga murmurs into his radio. The convoy pulls out, very fast. Barbara makes one last plea. \n", "test1_id": 681, "test2_input": "BARBARA You're risking your political capital. You're risking your future as our leader. \nMANDELA The day I am afraid to do that is the day I am no longer fit to lead. \nBARBARA At least risk it for something more important than rugby. \nMandela looks out the window, says nothing, angry. \nEXT. FREEWAY - DAY \nMandela's convoy heads away from Pretoria, very fast. \nNSC FIREBRAND (V.O.) ... and in concluding this historic conference ... \nINT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY \nNSC FIREBRAND ... brothers, sisters, comrades, we in the executive applaud your diligence and courage. \nThe NSC Firebrand and the executive applaud the members. The applause spreads until the hall rocks. They are all very pleased with themselves. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EERSTERUST - CONFERENCE HALL - DAY \nMandela's convoy roars in. Mandela is the first one out, Linga next. \nJason and crew scramble to cover the immediate area. \nKwezi opens the door for Barbara on the other side. \nMandela strides over to Jason, says something to him. Jason looks surprised, turns to Hendrick. \nLinga's customary scowl intensifies. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY \nAs the applause finally begins to diminish, the NSC Firebrand turns and nods to a CHURCH CHOIR DIRECTOR, off to the side. \nThe choir director brings his CHOIR onto the stage. \nNSC FIREBRAND Brothers, sisters ... join us in our anthem. \nAnyone not standing, stands. The choir director raises his hands. The choir inhales. Go. \nCHOIR (SINGING) Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrica etc (God Bless Africa) -- \nBut before the first line is fully sung, an ASSISTANT rushes out, whispers urgently into the NSC Firebrand's ear. \nThe Firebrand's eyes bug out in surprise. He crosses to the Choir Director, says something quickly. \nThe Choir Director stops the choir in mid-chorus. Consternation everywhere. What's going on? \nNSC FIREBRAND Brothers, sisters, members of the choir -- we would only interrupt such beautiful music for something truly important. In this case, for someone truly important. (beat, milking it) Please welcome President Mandela! \nThe place goes berserk as Mandela enters, with Linga at his back, and -- surprise, surprise -- Hendrick Booyens leading the way. \nFace stern and unsmiling, Mandela walks the length of the hall towards the podium. The delegates press in towards them. \nANOTHER ANGLE - Jason coordinates security inside and out. Lifts his radio to his mouth. \nJASON (INTO RADIO) Smile. \nON HENDRICK, as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly becomes a smile -- which scares the throng more than the scowl did. \nON LINGA, the same. \nANOTHER ANGLE - Barbara enters at the back of the hall, accompanied by Kwezi. \nMandela reaches the podium, turns looks out over the crowd, face thunderous. \nWhen they see his anger, the crowd quietens down quickly. \nMANDELA Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am here because I feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight. \nHe lectures them like a headmaster. They don't like it. \nMANDELA I am aware of your earlier vote. I am aware that it was unanimous. (BEAT) Nonetheless, I propose that we restore the Springboks. Restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately. \nInstant and complete silence in the hall. This is utterly unpopular. Shocked faces, especially from the executive and the NSC firebrand. \nON BARBARA, as she sees her worst political nightmare playing out in front of her. \nMANDELA Let me tell you why ... \nMurmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise. Mandela's going to have to row upstream on this one. \nMANDELA ... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison, my jailers were all Afrikaners. (BEAT) For twenty seven years, I studied them. I learned their language, I read their history, I read their poetry. I had to know my enemy, in order to prevail against him. (BEAT) And we prevailed, did we not? All of us here ... we prevailed. \nFor the first time, Mandela says something the crowd likes. \nMANDELA Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner. They are our fellow South Africans, our partners in democracy. \nJust as quickly, Mandela loses them again. \nMANDELA And they treasure Springbok rugby. If we take that away, we lose them. We prove that we are what they feared we would be. (BEAT) We have to be better than that. (MORE) \nMANDELA (CONT'D) We have to surprise them with compassion, with restraint, and generosity. \nThe grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder. \nMANDELA Yes, I know. All the things they denied us. \nON HENDRICK, totally engrossed in his job, eyes sweeping across the crowd, feeling the tension. \nMANDELA But this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge. This is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us - - even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold. \nThe crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the moment. \nLINGA is as alert as Hendrick, tuned in to the jumpy vibe. \nMANDELA (ANGRY) You elected me. (BEAT) You elected me to be your leader. Let me lead you now. (BEAT) Who is with me on this? \n", "test2_true": "MANDELA Who is with me? \nThe murmuring becomes a dull roar of argument and disagreement. \nON BARBARA as she closes her eyes and lowers her head: this is a fiasco. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EERSTERUST CONFERENCE CENTER - DAY \nAs delegates spill out of the conference hall, Mandela's convoy leaves as fast as it arrived. It almost looks as if they're fleeing. \nINT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY \nSilence. Mandela looks exhausted, almost gaunt. Facing his own people like that took it out of him. Barbara stares out the window, chewing her lip, totally stressed out. \nLinga heaves a great sigh, exhales a truckload of stress. \nINT. GREY BMW (LEAD CAR) - DAY \nJason and his crew travel in stoic silence. \nINT. GREY BMW (TRAILER) - DAY \nSimilar silence from Etienne and crew. It seems like the silence of defeat. \nINT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY \nBARBARA Twelve votes. Twelve! MANDELA A luxury. All we needed was one more yes than no. \nBARBARA What if you hadn't got it? \nMANDELA Well, as you know, I am an obedient party member. \nBarbara snorts disagreement. She is angry at her boss. \nBARBARA I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got problems everywhere we look. Housing, food, jobs, crime, our currency. You can't keep interrupting affairs of state to placate a minority. \nMANDELA But, I must. This minority still controls the army, the police, and the economy. Without them, we cannot address the other problems. \nBARBARA So this rugby, it's just a political calculation? \nLife and energy, flood back into Mandela. He sits up against his seat belt, faces his Chief of Staff. \nMANDELA It's a human calculation. (BEAT) If we take away what they cherish -- the Springboks, their national anthem -- we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us. \nON LINGA, in the front seat. He's not supposed to listen -- but how could he not? \nMANDELA I will do what I must to break this cycle. Or it will destroy us. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SPRINGBOK DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nThe sound of cleats approaching on concrete. Exhausted footsteps. The DRESSING ROOM ATTENDANT PUTS CASES OF BEER (cans) on a side table, rips them open, backs away -- \n-- as the Springboks enter silently, faces miserable, shoulders slumped. They've lost another game. \nOne of the players grabs a beer, opens it, takes a gigantic SWIG -- \nANGRY SPRINGBOK This beer tastes like kuk. \n-- hurls the beer against the wall so hard it ruptures, sending foaming beer everywhere. \nON PIENAAR as his eyes flash and he shoots to his feet. \nPIENAAR It's not the beer. \nPienaar picks up a case of beers, goes to the angry Springbok. \nPIENAAR Take another. (BEAT) Everybody take a beer. \nThis is an order. The entire team takes a beer, including Pienaar. \nPIENAAR A toast ... \nPienaar cracks his beer, raises it up. They all crack and raise their beers. \nPIENAAR ... to the taste of defeat. \nThat bewilders his team. \nPIENAAR Drink it. Remember it. And promise yourself never to taste it again. \nPienaar takes one long swig -- \nPIENAAR You're right. It tastes like kuk. \n-- tosses his beer against the wall, so that it ruptures. Eighteen other beers rupture against the wall. The dressing room is awash with beer and foam -- and re-kindled passion. \nAs with Mandela, Pienaar is a leader, on a smaller scale. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nBoth units crammed into the small office. As usual, neither team talks to the other. Jason enters with two files. \nJASON Here's the schedule for the overseas trip. \nJason and the boys look over one, Etienne and his unit look over the other -- and discuss it amongst themselves in Afrikaans. Hendrick says something pointed, which resonates with the others. \nLINGA What did he just say? \nHENDRICK I said -- \nETIENNE He asked when we were supposed to sleep. \nHENDRICK As well as other basic human functions. \nJASON Hey. If Madiba can do it, we can do it. \n", "test2_id": 682, "test3_input": "HENDRICK Ja. We're tied. \nA fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild. \nHENDRICK We're up by three. \nACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line. Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted. \nA ripple of concern goes through the crowd -- \n-- and the VIP box. \nLINGA They're ahead? \nHENDRICK By four. \nNerves in the box. \nBut not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession -- \n-- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking the last Wallaby to try and tackle him. \nThe crowd roars. \nIn the VIP box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the waiter. \nThe difficult, angled conversion is missed. \nLINGA What does that mean? \nHENDRICK We're only ahead by one. \nAnother penalty kick. \nHENDRICK We're ahead by four. \nA drop goal. \nHENDRICK By seven. \nAn incredible try by the Springbok fly half. \nHENDRICK By fourteen. \nEveryone dares to dream. The classic South African penchant for pessimism begins to abate. \nTwo things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day. \nSUDDENLY, A REFEREE'S WHISTLE CREATES PANDEMONIUM on the field, in the stands, and in the VIP box. \nLINGA What happened? \nHENDRICK We won! \nLINGA We did? \nMandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins the famous \"Mandela shuffle\" -- a very cool African boogie that is one of his signature moves. ON THE MANDELA SHUFFLE -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. VIP PARTY - NIGHT \n-- the same shuffle hours later, at a VIP party. Mandela has changed clothes, wears one of his Indonesian-inspired \"Madiba shirts\" and dances energetically with the absolutely stunning TROPHY WIFE of one of the VIP's. \nTROPHY WIFE You must be very pleased! \nMANDELA What man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you? \nTROPHY WIFE Oh, Mr. President, you're exaggerating. \nMANDELA Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. As you know, I am not. (BEAT) But when I look at you ... I envy my father. \nThe man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. But, once again, he is dancing with a stranger -- \n-- and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that Mandela is pushing himself way past empty. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JASON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJason is asleep on his face, in his suit and shoes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAPE TOWN WATERFRONT - NIGHT \nBig party, spilling onto the streets. Most of the partiers are white. Black South Africans look on, or serve drinks. \nWe follow the crowd into a big sports bar -- \nINT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT \n-- where the Springboks are pounding beers and blowing off the steam of months of training grind, plus a huge win. \nEven though most of the players are with their wives or girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three deep, men pay for round after round of beers. \nPienaar and Nerine are part of the action. Then Pienaar gets a TEXT MESSAGE which makes him shake his head, give Nerine a chagrined look. \nHe grabs the Springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near the player's ear and screams again the hubbub: \nPIENAAR COACH'S RUN, NINE A.M. SHARP. PASS IT ON. \nThe Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the player next to him, repeats it. \nPienaar watches the message travelling through his team -- and grins. \nThen, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead TV's. \nON THE TV: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie. The boogie is followed by a quick \"How far we have come\" type of montage. One of the images shows an island ringed by rough surf. \nPienaar gets an idea. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n", "test3_true": "Pienaar leads his hung-over, sleep-deprived team on a very slow jog through the mostly empty streets. \nWhen he gets to an intersection, he sneaks a peek down at the palm of his left hand. \nCLOSE-UP ON PIENAAR'S HAND, where he has drawn a crude street map. \nPienaar takes a left at the intersection. \nCUT TO: \nAnother intersection, another peek at the map on his hand, and another left turn, takes the team -- \nEXT. CAPE TOWN WATERFRONT - DAY \n-- back onto the waterfront, to an idling FERRY BOAT, where the coach and the manager wait for them -- along with the player's wives and girlfriends. \nCOACH I hope you're not that slow next week. \nPienaar grins, stops. The team stops around him. \nSPRINGBOK FLYHALF What's going on? \nPIENAAR A change of pace. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FERRY BOAT - DAY \nThe ferry pulls away from the waterfront, with the team on board, pulling on tracksuits against the cold sea air. \nIt is early winter. The seas are fairly rough. \nSo are the stomachs of the `boks who partied hard last night. \nSPRINGBOK HOOKER Who's bloody idea was this? \nON PIENAAR, innocent as a lamb. \nEXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY \nBehind the ferry, Cape Town and Table Mountain, in all their glory. \nAhead of the ferry, one of the most notorious island prisons in modern history -- \n-- ROBBEN ISLAND. \nEXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY \nRobben Island lies only eight miles from the mainland. It is two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and seals. It would be pretty -- \n-- but for its MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. Concrete, barbed wire, guard towers. \n(In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still had the feel of real incarceration. Today, it is a tourist destination.) \nEXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY \nAs they approach the island, a sense of dark history settles over the Springboks and their partners. \nOne of the Springboks turns to a DECKHAND, getting ready to moor at the jetty. \nSPRINGBOK LOCK How do they bring the prisoners here? \nDECKHAND On this boat. \nSobering. \nEXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY \nThe Springboks and their partners step onto dry land with some relief, look around at the prison, humbled. \nNERINE (TO PIENAAR) Imagine being able to see Cape Town so close by. \nPIENAAR That would make it worse. \nThey head towards the prison entrance, slowly becoming a tighter and tighter bunch. The ghosts of Mandela, and all the others who spent much of their lives here, are very strong. \nCUT TO: \nVARIOUS SHOTS OF THE SPRINGBOK PARTY, in the EXERCISE YARD, the LIME QUARRY, the MESS HALL. None of the usual horsing around. This place affects them, deeply. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROBBEN ISLAND PRISON - SECTION B - DAY \nSection B is the bleak political wing. Tiny cells line each side of a damp concrete hallway. \nA PRISON GUARD shows the Springboks into the hallway, and they dwarf it, as they stand there, shocked. Shocked at what was done in their names. This group is as quiet as we have ever seen them. \nPIENAAR Can we see the President's cell? \nPRISON GUARD Yes, of course. (leading them down past THE CELLS) We've done it up just the way it was. \nThey reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the door, showing the number 466/64 -- MANDELA'S PRISON NUMBER. \nPRISON GUARD (pointing at the number) That means he was the 466th prisoner admitted in 1964. \nThe Prison Guard unlocks the door, pulls it open, then unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door. \nINT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY \nPienaar peers into the cell. It is tiny. There is no bed, just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of blankets. A chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate are the only other objects in the room. \nA couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. The barred window is opaque. It lets in light but does not allow the prisoner a view. \nWhen Pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. He can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time. \nThis is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place. Pienaar is stunned by it. He turns, slowly, looking at Mandela's world for over twenty years. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROBBEN ISLAND PRISON - SECTION B - DAY \n", "test3_id": 683}

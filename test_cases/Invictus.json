It has the power to inspire, the power to unite people that little else has ... It is more powerful than governments in breaking down racial barriers.\" NELSON MANDELA \nEXT. ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL, WESTERN CAPE - DAY \nA big, rich, powerhouse all-white high school located near the freeway into Cape Town. The RUGBY FIELDS are immaculate. FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS in striped rugby jerseys train with total intensity under the critical eye of the COACH. \nRight ACROSS THE BOUNDARY FENCE from the rugby fields is an area of WASTE LAND leading up to the freeway. There, BLACK AND \"COLORED\" (MIXED-RACE) BOYS of the same age play a loose game of soccer with a tennis ball. Most of them have bare feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys. \nTwo cultures, separated by more than the high boundary fence. \nSUPER TITLE: SOUTH AFRICA, FEBRUARY 11, 1990 A COMMOTION ON THE FREEWAY intrudes on the soccer game. Horns honking, cars pull over onto the shoulder, people jump out. \nEXT. FREEWAY - DAY \nLead by police motorbikes, then patrol cars, a white Mercedes approaches, heading towards Cape Town. Whoever is in the Mercedes has stopped traffic. \nEXT. ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL, WESTERN CAPE - DAY \nThe soccer players abandon their game and run for the freeway, whistling and shouting. \nThe rugby players are more disciplined -- or obedient -- and do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes right by them. The coach shakes his head in disgust. \nHIGH SCHOOL BOY Who is it, sir? \nCOACH It's that terrorist, Mandela. They let him out. (BEAT) Remember this day, boys. It's the day our country went to the dogs. \nCUT TO: \nA short, STOCK-FOOTAGE MONTAGE which spans the tumultuous four years between NELSON MANDELA'S release from prison and his inauguration as President of South Africa. \nFootage would include: \n- Mandela's release from prison - negotiations with the apartheid regime - scenes of white fear and emigration - the horrifying sectarian violence leading up to the ELECTIONS - the khaki-clad AWB (Afrikaner right wing) attack on the World Trade Center (where negotiations were taking place) - the lifting of economic sanctions and cultural boycotts - the lifting of the international ban on the Springbok rugby team and immediate Test match losses to New Zealand and Australia. - popular black leader Chris Hani's assassination by white RIGHT WINGERS - black retaliation - Mandela's frantic intervention to keep the country from going up in flames - the election itself, with those incredible images of thousands and thousands of people, black and white, lining up patiently, some to vote for the first time in their lives - the African National Congress victory - Mandela's inauguration as President, where he delivers the FAMOUS WORDS: \n\"Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another, and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world.\" \nAs APPLAUSE FADES ... \nGO TO BLACK: \nINT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDark. We can make out the FORM OF A TALL MAN SLEEPING ALONE at the very edge of the big bed, as if not wanting to rumple the blankets too much. \nOn the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00. The man's eyes open in the dark, instantly awake. He reaches out, switches on the light. \nNELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in one movement. He has the physical vigor and energy of someone twenty years younger. \nThe second he is up, he turns around and makes his bed, leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed. Or a prison bunk. \nFor this is the discipline of twenty seven years behind bars. \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nDressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, Mandela comes down the stairs and heads for the front door. \nThis is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous man on the planet. \nEXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a moment to savor the air. It is bone dry and cold -- typical conditions in the Highveld at this time of year. \nIt is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is completely alone in the world. \nThe big yard is fenced. There is a small GUARD HOUSE at the driveway gate. \nWhen Mandela steps away from the house, A UNIFORMED SOUTH AFRICAN POLICEMAN IN THE GUARDHOUSE pushes the button that opens the gate. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWhen the gate begins to open we see that there are TWO GREY BMWs parked either side of it. \nINT. GREY BMW - NIGHT \nLINGA MOONSAMY comes to full alert as the gate opens. He is a big, scowling man dressed in a suit. He checks the load on a pistol, tucks it into his shoulder holster. \nLINGA Here he comes. Like clockwork. \nJASON It makes him such an easy target. \nBehind Linga, in the back seat, sits JASON TSHABALALA, a naturally tense and suspicious man. Both of them are hollow- eyed, exhausted, running on adrenaline. \nThey get out of the BMW, fast and quiet. This does not look good. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAs Mandela walks out through the gate, Jason and Linga intercept him. \nJASON (traditional greeting in XHOSA) I see you, father. \nMandela's face comes alive as he smiles. \nMANDELA (without breaking stride) Morning boys. How are you? \nJason is Mandela's head of personal security, Linga his number one bodyguard. They are both former \"terrorists\", and they are utterly devoted to Mandela. \nJASON We're sharp, Madiba. \nMANDELA Good ... good. And how's your mother doing, Linga? \nLINGA She's much better, thank you. \nMANDELA Good. \nJASON I don't care if they're signed or -- \nJason does a double-take when he sees the signature on the orders: NELSON R. MANDELA. \nJASON Wait here. \nJason storms out, holding the orders. The four black bodyguards seethe with hostility. The four white bodyguards stare straight ahead, refusing to give ground. \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY \nMandela and Barbara look over a position paper on something or other. When Jason knocks and enters, they pause. \nJASON Sorry to disturb you. \nMANDELA You look agitated, Jason. \nJASON That's because I've got four Special Branch cops in my office. \nMANDELA What have you done? \nJASON Me? Nothing. They say they're the Presidential bodyguard. They have orders. (BEAT) Signed by you. \nMANDELA Yes. They've had special training, those boys -- with the SAS. And lots of experience. They protected De Klerk. \nJASON Yes, but -- \nMANDELA You asked for more men, didn't you? \nJASON Yes, but -- \nMANDELA In public, when people see me, they see my bodyguards, too. You represent me, directly. The rainbow nation starts here. (BEAT) Reconciliation starts here. \nJASON Reconciliation? Madiba, not long ago they tried to kill us! Maybe even these four guys. They tried and, often, they succeeded! \nCUT TO: \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE \nLinga, Sam, Winston and Kwezi stare down Etienne, Hendrick, George and Willem. \nBACK TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY \nMandela stares at Jason in an entirely different way -- with wisdom, compassion and sympathy. \nMANDELA Yes, I know. (VERY GENTLY) Forgiveness starts here, too. \nMandela lets that sink in for a moment. He knows he asks for something very difficult, but he demands it of himself to an even greater degree. \nMANDELA Forgiveness liberates the soul. It removes fear. That is why it is such a powerful weapon, Jason. (MORE) \nMANDELA (CONT'D) (BEAT) Please try it. \nJason exhales. He isn't remotely ready to forgive. \nJASON Yes, Madiba. Sorry to disturb you. \nJason turns, leaves. Barbara shakes her head at Mandela. \nBARBARA You ask a lot. \nMANDELA Only what is necessary. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY \nAs Jason -- very upset -- walks back to security, Jessie holds out a file for him. \nJESSIE Two copies of the schedule. \nJason snatches the file, keeps walking. \nJESSIE Thank you, Jessie! \nWhen he reaches the security office door, Jason walks right past, keeps going, has to make a full loop of the reception area, just to get himself together. \nEven so, when he gets back to the security office door, Jason pauses, gathers himself to do something that he knows he's going to hate. \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nThings haven't eased up one little bit inside the office. The silence is deafening. Jason enters, looks them all over. His face is grim. \nLINGA Can we get rid of these guys, now? \nJason flashes a look at Linga, then -- and this hurts him, visibly -- he holds out one of MANDELA'S SCHEDULES to Etienne. \nJASON This is his schedule for the next month. Let's look it over for duty assignments. \nETIENNE Right. \nLINGA What? \nLinga and the others are shocked. \nLINGA Jason, I have to talk to you. Outside. \nLinga virtually pulls Jason out of the office. \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY \nJust outside the Security Office door, so they keep their voices low. \nLINGA How can we trust them? JASON We can't. (heading back in) This is what Madiba wants, okay. \nNot okay for Linga, judging by the expression on his face. \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nWhen Jason and Linga enter, Etienne looks up from Mandela's schedule. \nETIENNE Are there any special orders or conditions? \nCrowd noise increases. They know the opening whistle is about to blow. \nThen, Mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level. \nMANDELA'S POV: A GROUP OF ROUGH-LOOKING WHITE MEN WAVE THE NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG AT HIM. \nWITHOUT WARNING, MANDELA CHANGES DIRECTION, heads towards this group, towards a wall of his former -- and perhaps current -- enemies. \nON JASON: shit! \nJASON (INTO RADIO) Stay with him. \nETIENNE Stop him. \nJASON Stay with him. \nWith his bodyguards scrambling to stay in position, Mandela reaches the stands, hand outstretched, leans into the crowd. \nMANDELA Thank you for honoring our new flag! \nSome shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not. \nThe crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- Mandela is delaying the rugby. \nMandela is undeterred. He's into this one-on-one outreach. He turns, looks for more hands to shake -- \n-- and Jason steps in between Mandela and the crowd. \nJASON We're delaying the rugby, Madiba. \nMANDELA Oh, yes, of course. \nMandela gives one last wave, turns away. \nAs he does, SOMEONE WINDS UP AND THROWS SOMETHING from the stands. \nJason and Etienne catch the movement, whirl, too late. \nAN ORANGE WHIZZES PAST MANDELA'S HEAD, explodes juicily on the field. \nMandela didn't see it, doesn't react. If anything, his smile widens as he heads across the field. The bodyguards close around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel. \nINT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - TUNNEL ONTO FIELD - DAY \nJason signals for extra bodyguards to escort Mandela all the way up to his box. Hendrick, the biggest, leads the way. \nJason stays in the tunnel, along with Etienne. Both men are in a muck sweat, adrenaline coursing through them. \nETIENNE Why didn't you stop him? \nJASON Next time, you try. \nETIENNE Does he do that sort of thing all the time? \nJASON Ask my ulcer. (BEAT) Good thing that was just an orange. \nETIENNE And good thing he never saw it. \nJASON Oh, he saw it. He sees everything. (rubbing his ulcer) I hate rugby. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY \nTwo international front rows come together with bone- crunching force. \nHuge, violent men grunt like bulls. The crowd roar vibrates the stadium. The scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies under the watchful eye of the referee. \nFanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it. \nThe Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum force. \nThe ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out laterally to the wing, with lightning speed. \nThe wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which bounces erratically -- \n-- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One last burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle, and the wing scores in the corner. \nAs the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on their hips, stunned. \nAt the center of the huddle Pienaar bleeds behind his gum guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into his team. \nPIENAAR Concentrate, dammit! Focus! We can beat these guys if we play our game, not theirs! \nON PIENAAR, as he realizes he is not getting through. There is dullness, shock in his player's eyes -- \n-- which all lift to the heavens as the CONVERSION KICK SOARS through the uprights. \nWe FOLLOW THE KICK as it drops past a GIANT SCOREBOARD. \nSTAY ON THE SCOREBOARD as it registers the conversion and shows the score: LIONS - 10 SPRINGBOKS - 0 \nINT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM VIP BOX - DAY \nIn the VIP box, Mandela turns his back on the field as the game restarts beneath him and continues in the background. He has BINOCULARS around his neck. \nMANDELA Shall we work while we watch? We have lots of promises to keep. \nBarbara sits to his right, with her ever-present files and folders. \nBARBARA Yes, we do. \nMary pours tea at the back of the box. Linga stands two steps behind Mandela. \nOn Mandela's left, sits the PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY, a small man with a small man's ruthlessness and drive. \nMANDELA It's not too late, if the boys can just pick up their game. \nRUGBY PRESIDENT If they don't, heads will roll. This is unacceptable. (LEANING FORWARD) Come on you bloody bastards! \nMandela's expression shows that he has a gentleman's distaste for profanity. He turns to Barbara. \nBARBARA Where do you want go first, for foreign investment? \nThe atmosphere is absolutely dismal as the men undress and shower. \nNobody catches anybody else's eye. Huge, powerful, pale bodies have been ploughed purple with rake marks, bruises and roasties. Plus, one dark body -- that of CHESTER WILLIAMS, a skilled wing from the Cape, a reserved and private man. \nPienaar takes off his green and gold jersey, sits, begins taking off his cleats. His body hurts. He has been raked, scratched, bruised, and his ankle is swollen. \nA noble warrior, defeated. \nBOLAND BOTHA (V.O.) Francois Pienaar's team came to Loftus Versfeld stadium this afternoon, unprepared and arrogant. \nINT. TV STUDIO \nMeet BOLAND BOTHA as he tapes his commentary on the test match. He is an ex-Springbok player from the boycott years, now turned ponderous, florid rugby commentator. He is a household name, and the last word on the state of the Springboks. \nBOLAND BOTHA They left 80 minutes later with their tails between their legs, like whipped mongrels. (BEAT) And I, for one, am glad. Not because we lost, but because there's now no way to disguise the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared to reenter the world of top-notch international rugby. \nBoland defines the South African talent for pessimism and negativity. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SA RUGBY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nBOLAND BOTHA (ON TV) The Rugby World Cup is now less than a year away, and I, for one, am relieved that we are the host nation, and therefore qualify automatically for the tournament. Because I'm not sure we would get in on merit alone. \nThe Rugby President sucks on a rum and coke, watches Boland with one of his HENCHMEN. \nRUGBY PRESIDENT Who gets the axe? Someone has to. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRANCOIS PIENAAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNo after-match party this night. Still depressed by the loss, Pienaar stays home with this fiancee NERINE. \nBOLAND BOTHA (ON TV) Pienaar's team played without discipline, without strategy and without courage. \nPIENAAR He's trying to get them to drop me. \nNERINE He's just bitter because the Springboks were boycotted when he played. \nPIENAAR Maybe, but people listen to what he says. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWearing pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers, Mandela multi- tasks, watching Boland Botha and going through a pile of correspondence, scribbling notes or signing his name. \nBOLAND BOTHA (ON TV) They brought shame upon our nation, and I, for one, can say without fear of contradiction, that today, these fifteen so-called men did not deserve to wear the hallowed green and gold. \nON MANDELA: a thought, an idea -- a big one -- is churning in his head. He grunts, turns off the TV, puts the correspondence aside, stands. \nMary enters with a glass of milk and some pills, on a tray. \nMARY Here's your muti. I warmed the milk tonight. \nMANDELA You're too good to me. \nMandela takes his pills. \nMARY Your daughter called, to cancel her visit this weekend. \nMandela pauses, between pills. \nMANDELA Did she say why? \nMARY No, she didn't. (making it up) She said to tell you she was sorry. \nMandela nods, has a hard time swallowing his last pill. \nMARY Do you need anything else tonight? \nMANDELA No, thank you. I'm going to bed. Good night. \nMARY Good night, Madiba. Sleep well. \nMandela smiles at her, but as soon as he is past her, the smile fades. As he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, his face becomes sadder and older and lonelier. \nIN HIS BEDROOM, Mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown. He looks at his bed. It is as smooth and as blank as a sheet of paper. \nHe peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch. He switches off the light and lies down, still and straight. \nThe most popular man in the world starts and ends each day alone. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY \nA very poor township outside Johannesburg. A stark reminder of how much work Mandela has ahead of him. A STAMPEDE OF KIDS runs by. \nWe FOLLOW THE KIDS and find a SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH. A noisy LINE OF THREADBARE KIDS leads from outside into the church. There is a pecking order in the line, based on size. \nMRS. COLEMAN (O.S.) No pushing now! There's enough for everybody! \nINT. SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH - DAY \nAt a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of second-hand clothes under the watchful eye of MRS. COLEMAN, a stout and charitable woman. Next to her, MRS. DLAMINI hands out a lollipop and says -- \nMRS. DLAMINI God bless you. \n-- to each kid. The clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm kept by Mrs. Dlamini's \"God bless yous\". \nThe last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids reduces until there is only ONE SMALL BOY (SIPHO) left and only one article of clothing. An old SPRINGBOK RUGBY PRACTISE JERSEY. Green and gold. \nSipho could use it. His clothes are more holes than anything else. He looks at the Springbok jersey mournfully. \nMRS. COLEMAN You're a very lucky boy. It's a real Springbok practise jersey! It's a bit big, but it's warm and it'll last for ever! \nSipho shakes his head. \nMRS. COLEMAN It's yours, take it! Go on. \nSipho turns and leaves. Mrs. Coleman looks at Mrs. Dlamini, completely confused. \nBARBARA You're risking your political capital. You're risking your future as our leader. \nMANDELA The day I am afraid to do that is the day I am no longer fit to lead. \nBARBARA At least risk it for something more important than rugby. \nMandela looks out the window, says nothing, angry. \nEXT. FREEWAY - DAY \nMandela's convoy heads away from Pretoria, very fast. \nNSC FIREBRAND (V.O.) ... and in concluding this historic conference ... \nINT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY \nNSC FIREBRAND ... brothers, sisters, comrades, we in the executive applaud your diligence and courage. \nThe NSC Firebrand and the executive applaud the members. The applause spreads until the hall rocks. They are all very pleased with themselves. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EERSTERUST - CONFERENCE HALL - DAY \nMandela's convoy roars in. Mandela is the first one out, Linga next. \nJason and crew scramble to cover the immediate area. \nKwezi opens the door for Barbara on the other side. \nMandela strides over to Jason, says something to him. Jason looks surprised, turns to Hendrick. \nLinga's customary scowl intensifies. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY \nAs the applause finally begins to diminish, the NSC Firebrand turns and nods to a CHURCH CHOIR DIRECTOR, off to the side. \nThe choir director brings his CHOIR onto the stage. \nNSC FIREBRAND Brothers, sisters ... join us in our anthem. \nAnyone not standing, stands. The choir director raises his hands. The choir inhales. Go. \nCHOIR (SINGING) Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrica etc (God Bless Africa) -- \nBut before the first line is fully sung, an ASSISTANT rushes out, whispers urgently into the NSC Firebrand's ear. \nThe Firebrand's eyes bug out in surprise. He crosses to the Choir Director, says something quickly. \nThe Choir Director stops the choir in mid-chorus. Consternation everywhere. What's going on? \nNSC FIREBRAND Brothers, sisters, members of the choir -- we would only interrupt such beautiful music for something truly important. In this case, for someone truly important. (beat, milking it) Please welcome President Mandela! \nThe place goes berserk as Mandela enters, with Linga at his back, and -- surprise, surprise -- Hendrick Booyens leading the way. \nFace stern and unsmiling, Mandela walks the length of the hall towards the podium. The delegates press in towards them. \nANOTHER ANGLE - Jason coordinates security inside and out. Lifts his radio to his mouth. \nJASON (INTO RADIO) Smile. \nON HENDRICK, as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly becomes a smile -- which scares the throng more than the scowl did. \nON LINGA, the same. \nANOTHER ANGLE - Barbara enters at the back of the hall, accompanied by Kwezi. \nMandela reaches the podium, turns looks out over the crowd, face thunderous. \nWhen they see his anger, the crowd quietens down quickly. \nMANDELA Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am here because I feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight. \nHe lectures them like a headmaster. They don't like it. \nMANDELA I am aware of your earlier vote. I am aware that it was unanimous. (BEAT) Nonetheless, I propose that we restore the Springboks. Restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately. \nInstant and complete silence in the hall. This is utterly unpopular. Shocked faces, especially from the executive and the NSC firebrand. \nON BARBARA, as she sees her worst political nightmare playing out in front of her. \nMANDELA Let me tell you why ... \nMurmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise. Mandela's going to have to row upstream on this one. \nMANDELA ... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison, my jailers were all Afrikaners. (BEAT) For twenty seven years, I studied them. I learned their language, I read their history, I read their poetry. I had to know my enemy, in order to prevail against him. (BEAT) And we prevailed, did we not? All of us here ... we prevailed. \nFor the first time, Mandela says something the crowd likes. \nMANDELA Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner. They are our fellow South Africans, our partners in democracy. \nJust as quickly, Mandela loses them again. \nMANDELA And they treasure Springbok rugby. If we take that away, we lose them. We prove that we are what they feared we would be. (BEAT) We have to be better than that. (MORE) \nMANDELA (CONT'D) We have to surprise them with compassion, with restraint, and generosity. \nThe grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder. \nMANDELA Yes, I know. All the things they denied us. \nON HENDRICK, totally engrossed in his job, eyes sweeping across the crowd, feeling the tension. \nMANDELA But this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge. This is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us - - even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold. \nThe crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the moment. \nLINGA is as alert as Hendrick, tuned in to the jumpy vibe. \nMANDELA (ANGRY) You elected me. (BEAT) You elected me to be your leader. Let me lead you now. (BEAT) Who is with me on this? \nCUT TO: \nINT. UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY - DAY \nMandela addresses the General Assembly, thanking them for their support in the fight against apartheid. \nMANDELA The millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again. \nLinga and Hendrick are his closest bodyguards. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - SOUTH LAWN - DAY \nMandela addresses diplomats, members of Congress, black leaders at a made-for-TV ceremony on the South Lawn. \nMANDELA I have come here with a message. People of the Unites States of America: Open your markets to us. People of the United States of American: Come and invest in our country. \nLinga, Jason, Etienne and Hendrick are in on this one -- a little island of South Africans in a sea of U.S. SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY \nWe are in a COURTYARD behind the palace. Drawn by four white horses, A ROYAL CARRIAGE (an open carriage) pulls up, stops. The courtyard quickly fills with liveried footmen, then security guards. \nQUEEN ELISABETH and Mandela emerge from the palace. Footmen open doors on both sides of the carriage. The Queen and Mandela climb in (the Queen on the right hand side). \nWhen they sit down next to each other, Mandela leans over and says something to the Queen that makes her giggle ... \n... almost. For Queens do not giggle. \nThe carriage pulls forward and these two human icons sit up straight, as they get set to face the world. \nTV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... and in London, President Mandela made quite an impression on the Queen -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. PIENAAR PARENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nON TV: footage of Mandela with the Queen, riding down the mall waving to ecstatic crowds. \nTV ANNOUNCER -- as he concluded a gruelling trip TO-- \nMr. Pienaar MUTES THE TV, so that he can deliver the latest one-liner to Mrs. Pienaar. \nMR. PIENAAR In related news, it was announced that President Mandela will be visiting South Africa this week. \nMrs. Pienaar laughs. \nIN THE BACKGROUND, in the kitchen, a plump, middle-aged Tswana woman washes the dishes and keeps an eye on the TV. This is EUNICE, the Pienaar's maid. \nShe does not find Mr. Pienaar's joke amusing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JOHANNESBURG AIRPORT - NIGHT \nThe PRESIDENT'S JET taxis towards the familiar BMW, Mercedes, BMW convoy. \nCUT TO: \nMandela disembarks, very slowly. He is exhausted, his feet are swollen, his knee hurts. This is a very different man than the one we have just seen wooing the world. \nHe is met at the bottom of the stairs by Hendrick. \nHENDRICK It's good to be home, sir. \nMandela just nods. Too tired to talk. \nHendrick escorts Mandela to the Mercedes, opens the door for him. \nMandela takes a step towards the open door -- and staggers. \nReflexively, Hendrick reaches out, steadies him. \nMANDELA I'm fine. \nMandela steps out of Hendrick's hands, holds onto the open door. \nMANDELA Travelling the world, begging for money, is very tiring. \nMandela reaches into his jacket, pulls a SMALL PACKAGE out, hands it to Hendrick. \nMANDELA This is for you. \nMandela slides into the car. Once the door is closed, Hendrick glances at the package. We don't see it. It is too dark. \nBut we do see that Hendrick is amazed by it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GREY BMW - NIGHT \nHendrick is being driven home through the Highveld night. He chews on something really sticky, chewy. He pauses to dislodge some of it from a tooth, before it pulls out a filling. \nThen, he resumes chewing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nOn the bedside table, THE CLOCK clicks from 4:59 to 5:00. Mandela's eyes open in the dark ... close for a second ... then shoot open again. \nIt takes everything Mandela has to sit up and switch on the light. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe bodyguards' BMW's flank the gate. As the gate opens -- \n-- Linga gets out of one BMW, Hendrick gets out of the other. They are alert. It is freezing cold. \nPienaar comes back, stands in the doorway, a stunned expression on his face. \nNERINE What? Who was it? \nPienaar doesn't answer immediately. \nMR. PIENAAR Told you. It was his girlfriend. \nMRS. PIENAAR Shush! \nPIENAAR I've been invited to tea. \nNERINE Who with? \nPIENAAR The President. \nMR. PIENAAR The President of SA Rugby? Count your fingers after he shakes your hand. \nPienaar points at the muted TV. \nPIENAAR The President. \nON THE TV: footage of Mandela with a group of SAUDI PRINCES. \nEunice turns and looks at Francois, wide-eyed. \nThe Pienaar family all stare at the TV, stunned. \nPIENAAR He wants me over for tea, week after next. \nEunice picks up her handbag, puts on her coat and heads for the door, stops when she reaches Pienaar. \nEUNICE Mr. Francois -- you must tell Madiba that the bus service is very bad, and too expensive. He must please fix it. (LEAVING) Good night everybody. \nMRS. PIENAAR Good night Eunice, thank you. \nAll eyes on Pienaar. \nMR. PIENAAR What the hell does he want with you? \nPienaar shakes his head -- he has no idea. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY \nNerine's modest little car heads towards the seat of power. \nINT. NERINE'S CAR - DAY \nNerine drives. Pienaar wears a blue blazer, grey slacks and subdued tie -- and is surprisingly nervous. \nNERINE Francois, relax. You've met him before. \nPIENAAR I shook his hand on the rugby field, that's all. \nNERINE You didn't even vote for him. \nPIENAAR He's still the President. (CONFESSING) He's had dinner with the Queen. With Presidents and movie stars. All I do is play rugby. What if I pull something stupid in front of him? \nNerine stops to let Pienaar out. Gives him a kiss, straightens his hair. \nNERINE You won't. I'll pick you up right here. \nEXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY \nPienaar climbs out of Nerine's car. \nA pretty sizeable KNOT OF JOURNALISTS rush towards him. \nPienaar takes a deep breath. He is a bundle of nerves. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nSmall office packed with big men. \nETIENNE See who's coming for tea? \nHENDRICK My nephew wants me to get his autograph. \nLINGA Who? \nETIENNE Francois Pienaar. \nJASON Who wants to escort him in? \nHendrick bolts for the door. \nHENDRICK I will. \nJASON No autographs. \nHENDRICK (INSULTED) I know how to do my job, okay. \nHendrick leaves. \nLINGA Who's this Pienaar? \nETIENNE You can't be serious? He's the captain of the Springboks. \nLinga shrugs, provocatively indifferent. \nLINGA I like soccer, myself. \nETIENNE Well, you know what they say about soccer -- it's gentleman's game played by hooligans. One the other hand, rugby is a hooligan's game played by -- \nLINGA Ja, ja, I've heard it before. It wasn't funny the first time. \nNot exactly violin music and roses ... but they are talking to each other. \nINT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY \nMANDELA Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar. He's the captain of the Springboks. \nMandela clearly expects Pienaar to shake hands with Mrs. Brits. Pienaar holds out his hand -- \nPIENAAR (AFRIKAANS GREETING) Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits. \n-- gently shakes hers. \nMRS. BRITS Ek ook, Meneer. (TO MANDELA) Shall I pour, sir? \nMANDELA No thank you, I think I'd like to. \nMrs. Brits leaves. Mandela does not sit until the door closes behind her. Pienaar only sits after he does. \nMandela's manners would not be out of place in Victorian England. \nMANDELA How do you take your tea, Francois? \nPIENAAR Milk and sugar, please. \nMandela pours tea for both of them. \nON PIENAAR, as, just for a moment, he realizes that here he is, with the President pouring him a cup of tea. \nMANDELA The English have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest. \nMandela hands Pienaar the tea cup. \nPIENAAR Thank you, sir. \nBoth men have big hands. Fine china dwarfed and threatened. \nIn the exact moment that both their hands hold the same saucer, Mandela looks Pienaar in the eye. \nMANDELA You have a very difficult job. \nPIENAAR I do? I sell gas braais. \nMandela lets go and Pienaar takes the tea. \nMANDELA Captain of the Springboks. A very difficult job. \nPIENAAR Not compared to yours, sir. \nMANDELA Ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while I'm doing mine. \nPienaar grins. True. \nMANDELA It is not so difficult to get people to do their best. And I imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically. \nPIENAAR Or they wouldn't be chosen in the first place. \nMANDELA Yes. But to get people to be better than that? (MORE) \nMANDELA (CONT'D) Better than they think they can be? Now, that is difficult, I find. \nPIENAAR Yes sir, it is. \nMANDELA How do we do that? By example? To an extent. But there is more to it than that ... (searching for the right WORD) ... inspiration, perhaps. \nPienaar is engrossed. This is a master lesson on leadership, from a master. \nMANDELA How do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do? How do we inspire everyone around us? (BEAT) Sometimes, I think, by using the work of others. \nLong pause. Pienaar knows to keep quiet. \nMANDELA On Robben Island, when things were very hard, I found inspiration in a poem. \nPIENAAR A poem? \nMANDELA A Victorian poem. Just words. But they helped me to stand when all I wanted was to lie down -- (SUDDENLY DISMISSIVE) But you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense. \nPIENAAR No! They make a lot of sense, sir. (BEAT) On the day of a big match, say a test, in the bus on the way to the stadium, nobody talks. \nMANDELA Yes ... yes. Everybody is preparing. \nPIENAAR When I think we're ready, I have the bus driver put on a song I've chosen; a theme song. One we all know. We listen together and ... it helps. \nMANDELA Yes! I remember when I was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The whole stadium welcomed me with a song. (BEAT) At the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak. But to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be South African. It helped me to come home and do better. It allowed me to expect more of myself. \nA beat. \nPIENAAR May I ask what the song was, sir? \nMANDELA Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. A very inspiring song. \nMandela looks into Pienaar's eyes. \nMANDELA We need inspiration, Francois. \nBrown African eyes, blue African eyes meet over their cups of tea. \nMANDELA Because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations. \nSomething passes between them. Whatever it is has a profound impact on Pienaar. \nPIENAAR Yes, sir. We probably do. \nCUT TO: \nCameras click and whirr as MANDELA AND PIENAAR SHAKE HANDS for the press. \n(NOTE that there are NO FLASHES.) \nCUT TO: \nINT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY \nPienaar walks away from the President's offices, still processing his meeting with Mandela. He seems a little stunned and mystified. Something profound just happened -- but he's not quite sure what. \nEXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY \nWhen Pienaar steps outside and sees all of Pretoria -- all of South Africa -- stretching away below him, he pauses. He looks at his country in a new way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY \nTHE MINISTER OF SPORTS BRIEFS MANDELA on the World Cup, with the help of a BIG DIAGRAM ON AN EASEL (just like a March Madness bracket layout, showing all the teams.) The Minister looks ragged, exhausted. \nMINISTER OF SPORT Four pools of four teams each, playing in nine different venues around the country. Two teams will advance from each pool to the quarter finals. \nMandela studies the diagram. He loves this stuff. \nMANDELA The Ivory Coast qualified. This is wonderful. \n(For the record, the sixteen teams who qualified were: South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Canada, Romania, Italy, France, Japan, West Samoa, Argentina, Tonga and Ivory Coast.) \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY \nThe Springbok squad leap up after the push-ups, sprint to the 50 m line, drop, begin 20 rapid crunches -- \n-- under the critical eye of the new COACH and MANAGER. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY \nMINISTER OF SPORT Australia won the previous World Cup. New Zealand won the one before that. (MORE) \nMINISTER OF SPORT (cont'd) They're both clear favorites to reach the finals this time. (BEAT) According to the experts, we'll reach the quarter finals, and no further. \nMANDELA According to the experts, you and I are still supposed to be in jail. \nThat brings a grin from the Minister of Sport. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY \nThe coach blows his whistle. \nCOACH Again! \nON PIENAAR, as he leaps to his feet, leads the charge back to the 25 m line. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY \nMINISTER OF SPORT You make a personal appearance at the finals, and at the opening match between the Springboks and Australia. (BEAT) The finals will be broadcast to over a billion people around the world, live. \nMANDELA A billion people watching us! (wheels turning in his HEAD) Yes ... yes. This is a great opportunity. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY \nHands on their knees, sucking air, retching, the squad has worked their way down the full length of the field. \nSPRINGBOK MANAGER I reckon you've knocked the stuffing out of them today. \nCOACH I haven't even begun. (BEAT) We may not be the most talented team in the world -- but we're going to be the fittest. \nHe blows his whistle. \nCOACH And back! The squad can't believe their ears. No one moves. Except Pienaar. \nPIENAAR Come on boys, let's show him. \nStaggering more than sprinting, Pienaar heads towards the 25m line. \nSPRINGBOK FLANK Shit, what's Pienaar been eating? \nBut, they follow him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY \nAlone in his office, Mandela looks at the World Cup diagram, for a moment, then picks up his phone. \nMANDELA (INTO PHONE) Please call the head of South African rugby for me. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nThirty completely wiped-out athletes. Some are too tired to shower, some have made it that far, but are too tired to change. \nPienaar has showered and changed and slumps next to his locker. \nThe SPRINGBOK MANAGER enters, followed by the RUGBY PRESIDENT. \nPienaar and the boys drag themselves upright. \nThe Rugby President looks them over as if they were his very own stable of race horses -- a stable he's not entirely sure he likes. \nRUGBY PRESIDENT Afternoon men. It's good to see you working so hard. I have a short announcement. (BEAT) As part of the PR buildup to the World Cup, you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country. \nThe players greet this announcement with complete silence. \nRUGBY PRESIDENT I know you have plenty on your plates already -- but this is a request that comes from the top. (looking at Pienaar, POINTEDLY) The very top. \nThe Rugby President turns on his heel, and leaves, followed by the Manager. \nThe players say nothing for a long moment, but body language alone shows that they are completely disgusted. \nSPRINGBOK HOOKER This is complete crap. \nSPRINGBOK FLANK Are we some kind of circus act now? \nSPRINGBOK LOCK We don't have time for kuk like this. \nThe boys are getting angrier by the second. \nSPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#2 THIS GOES TO WHOEVER COLLECTS THE MOST GLASS! \nMayhem, as kids sprint out across the field, hunting for glass. Sipho goes for the tiniest, most treacherous shards. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LUXURY BUS - DAY \nThe bus hits a rut in the dirt road with an almighty jolt, which wakes the sleeping Springboks. \nThey look out of the windows and see the absolutely hellish outskirts of the township. Every possible incarnation of poverty, as far as the eye can see. \nThis shocks them. Most of them have never been anywhere like this township. \nSPRINGBOK LOCK Shit, I'm glad I don't live here. \nEXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY \nThe driver sounds the horn, as they pull into the township. \nINT. LUXURY BUS - DAY \nThe bus pulls up at the field -- \nEXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY \n-- which is covered with kids on their hands and knees. \nINT. LUXURY BUS - DAY \nSPRINGBOK HOOKER What the hell are they doing? \nThe driver sounds the horn again, and the kids on the field sprint for the bus, hands and pockets full of broken glass. \nPIENAAR Don't forget, we've got TV cameras on us at all times. \nSPRINGBOK LOCK (MUTTERING) What a bloody joke. \nEXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY \nAs the kids approach the bus, they dump their broken glass under the banner, which reads -- \nONE TEAM, ONE COUNTRY \n-- brown, green, white, blue shards tinkling and piling up, like lethal jewels, backlit in the low winter sun. \nOne of the big kids gets the R100. Attention focussed on THAT -- \n-- until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics and the Springboks exit, one by one. \nPienaar first, with a huge NET BAG OF PRACTISE BALLS over his shoulder. \nThe Springboks are all so big, so strong, so healthy, they look like gods, or aliens, emerging from a spaceship. The kids go quiet, awed and uncomfortable. \nUntil Chester Williams steps off the bus, and there is a collective sigh of recognition and wonder. \nNow, the kids can relate to the Springboks. Even Sipho, who looks on from the side of the field. \nSpringbok management notes it. \nThe TV crews note it. \nPienaar notes it. \nPIENAAR Okay Chester -- I reckon you're up. \nCHESTER WILLIAMS (PANICKING) What am I supposed to do? \nPIENAAR What you do best. \nPienaar turns to the throng. \nPIENAAR WHO WANTS TO PLAY RUGBY? A roar. They all do. \nPienaar opens the net bag full of rugby balls, gives a ball to Chester. \nPIENAAR Let rip. \nChester boots the ball out over the crowd, high and incredibly far in the thin winter air. (60 yards, easily.) \nPienaar tosses balls to the others. \nPIENAAR Let's do our best. \nOne after another, the Springboks kick the balls high into the air. \nPIENAAR Go get them! \nThe kids go after them. Sipho stays on the sideline. \nBEGIN RUGBY CLINIC MONTAGE \nBarely controlled chaos. Each Springbok works with one ball and a group of kids. There are THREE THEMES to this montage. \nFIRST, a primer on the basic rules of rugby, with demonstrations. \nSPRINGBOK HOOKER Who here knows the first rule of rugby? \nTOWNSHIP KID Me! \nSPRINGBOK HOOKER What is it? \nTOWNSHIP KID Only hit the other players when the ref isn't looking! \nLaughter. A good ice-breaker. \nPIENAAR No. The first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways. \nPienaar demonstrates. (NOTE: All the rules are demonstrated.) \nVARIOUS SPRINGBOKS - If you drop the ball, or pass it forwards, you scrum for possession. - This is a scrum. - You kick forwards. (MORE) \nVARIOUS SPRINGBOKS (cont'd) If you kick it out of bounds, you throw it back in to a lineout. - This is a lineout. - You score in four ways: a try, when you dot the ball down behind the try line. That's five points. - Another two points when you convert the try by kicking the ball through the uprights. - Three points for a penalty kick. - Three points for a drop kick. - Have you got all that? \nMandela springs out of the helicopter, energized, excited. Linga and Jason with him. \nThe players assemble in a loose, semi-formal unit. Not a line, but orderly. (We may or may not notice that Chester Williams is missing.) \nPienaar stands at the front, relaxed. He's an old hand with Mandela, by now. \nMANDELA Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me for interrupting your work the day before such an important match ... (BEAT) ... I just wanted to wish you good luck, in person. \nThere is a naughty twinkle in Mandela's eye. \nMANDELA And sometimes, very seldom, as President, I am allowed to do what I want. \nThey all laugh. \nMandela wades in amongst them, leaving Linga and Jason behind. \nPicture this: Behind the barbed wire security of a modern, South African military base, a tall, regal black man in his 70's is surrounded by huge, sweating, battered, brutal- looking white men -- \nPIENAAR (DOING INTRODUCTIONS) Mr. President, this is -- \nMANDELA I know who this is. (SHAKING HANDS) Good luck, Andre. (shaking hands with all of THEM) Good luck Brendan, we're behind you all. Japie -- etc \n-- every single one of whose names he has committed to memory. Statesmanship is often about attention to detail. \nThe players are awe-struck. \n(FOR THE RECORD: Andre, Gavin, James, Japie, Christiaan, Brendan, Hennie, Joel, Johan, Joost, Marius, James, Chris, Pieter, Garry, Mark, Kobus, Hannes, Krynauw, Ruben, Francois, Robby, Adriaan, Rudolf.) \nCUT AWAY to Jason and Linga, who are amazed by what they're seeing. \nLINGA Did you ever imagine this? \nJASON How could I? \nBy the time Mandela has shaken every single player's hand, he has won the team over, coach and manager included. They glow. \nAnd then, Mandela frowns, steps back, looks at all of them. \nMANDELA But where is Chester? \nPienaar doesn't answer immediately, he looks at his coach first. Coach nods. \nPIENAAR He's injured, sir. His hamstring. We're trying to keep it quiet. \nMANDELA Is he out for the whole tournament? \nPIENAAR With hamstrings, who knows? (BEAT) We'll miss him. \nMANDELA The whole country will miss him. \nA somewhat sour note to leave on. But it's about to be rescued. \nSPRINGBOK PROP Mr. President, sir -- \nMANDELA Yes, Hennie. \nSPRINGBOK PROP -- this is for you. From us. \nThe huge, thick man holds out a GREEN CAP with gold piping and a Springbok leaping above the visor. \nMandela takes the cap as if he has just been given a holy relic. \nMANDELA I am honored. Truly honored. \nMandela runs his finger over the embroidered Springbok leaping across the front of the cap. \nMANDELA Good luck gentlemen. Your country supports you, completely. \nThe team applauds, beaming, glowing. \nMandela turns to go back to the helicopter. \nMANDELA Francois, walk with me. \nPienaar walks Mandela back towards the helicopter. \nMANDELA I have something for you. \nMandela reaches into his jacket, pulls out an ENVELOPE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S LETTERHEAD on it. Gives it to Pienaar. \nMANDELA This helped me, many times. Perhaps it will help you, too. \nCUT TO: \nPienaar holds the envelope, stares upwards at the rising, departing helicopter, as do the rest of the team -- until Coach blows his whistle. \nCOACH Enough fun and games! We've still got work to do. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - SECURITY CENTER - NIGHT \nJason paces restlessly, going over his mental check list, making sure he hasn't missed anything. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S CAPE TOWN HOUSE - NIGHT \nMandela reads, scrawls comments, signs papers from a big \"In\" pile. Mary enters with his glass of milk and his pills. \nMARY It's time for bed. \nMANDELA I think I'll stay up a little longer. The country is excited tonight. \nMARY You need to sleep. The doctor said. \nMANDELA The doctor has no sense of occasion. \nMandela turns on the TV, begins flipping channels. Rugby, rugby, rugby. Mandela is sucked in. \nMary sighs. \nCUT TO: \nHENDRICK Ja. We're tied. \nA fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild. \nHENDRICK We're up by three. \nACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line. Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted. \nA ripple of concern goes through the crowd -- \n-- and the VIP box. \nLINGA They're ahead? \nHENDRICK By four. \nNerves in the box. \nBut not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession -- \n-- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking the last Wallaby to try and tackle him. \nThe crowd roars. \nIn the VIP box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the waiter. \nThe difficult, angled conversion is missed. \nLINGA What does that mean? \nHENDRICK We're only ahead by one. \nAnother penalty kick. \nHENDRICK We're ahead by four. \nA drop goal. \nHENDRICK By seven. \nAn incredible try by the Springbok fly half. \nHENDRICK By fourteen. \nEveryone dares to dream. The classic South African penchant for pessimism begins to abate. \nTwo things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day. \nSUDDENLY, A REFEREE'S WHISTLE CREATES PANDEMONIUM on the field, in the stands, and in the VIP box. \nLINGA What happened? \nHENDRICK We won! \nLINGA We did? \nMandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins the famous \"Mandela shuffle\" -- a very cool African boogie that is one of his signature moves. ON THE MANDELA SHUFFLE -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. VIP PARTY - NIGHT \n-- the same shuffle hours later, at a VIP party. Mandela has changed clothes, wears one of his Indonesian-inspired \"Madiba shirts\" and dances energetically with the absolutely stunning TROPHY WIFE of one of the VIP's. \nTROPHY WIFE You must be very pleased! \nMANDELA What man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you? \nTROPHY WIFE Oh, Mr. President, you're exaggerating. \nMANDELA Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. As you know, I am not. (BEAT) But when I look at you ... I envy my father. \nThe man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. But, once again, he is dancing with a stranger -- \n-- and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that Mandela is pushing himself way past empty. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JASON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJason is asleep on his face, in his suit and shoes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAPE TOWN WATERFRONT - NIGHT \nBig party, spilling onto the streets. Most of the partiers are white. Black South Africans look on, or serve drinks. \nWe follow the crowd into a big sports bar -- \nINT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT \n-- where the Springboks are pounding beers and blowing off the steam of months of training grind, plus a huge win. \nEven though most of the players are with their wives or girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three deep, men pay for round after round of beers. \nPienaar and Nerine are part of the action. Then Pienaar gets a TEXT MESSAGE which makes him shake his head, give Nerine a chagrined look. \nHe grabs the Springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near the player's ear and screams again the hubbub: \nPIENAAR COACH'S RUN, NINE A.M. SHARP. PASS IT ON. \nThe Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the player next to him, repeats it. \nPienaar watches the message travelling through his team -- and grins. \nThen, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead TV's. \nON THE TV: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie. The boogie is followed by a quick \"How far we have come\" type of montage. One of the images shows an island ringed by rough surf. \nPienaar gets an idea. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe other Springboks and their partners wait to look into the cell themselves, a little puzzled by how much time Pienaar's taking. \nINT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY \nPienaar almost looks as if he is in a trance. He hears Mandela's voice in the cell with him. \nMANDELA (V.O.) (RECITING \"INVICTUS\") Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. \nNow, Pienaar sees Mandela in prison clothes, in the cell. (The image is unclear, ghostly.) \nMANDELA (V.O.) In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbow'd. \nPienaar sees Mandela sitting on the dirt in the prison yard, breaking up rock with a hammer, along with rows of other political prisoners. \nMANDELA (V.O.) Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid. \nPienaar sees Mandela leading his fellow prisoners to the lime quarry, to mine lime under the eye of a guard who looks like Pienaar. \nMANDELA (V.O.) It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishment the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe gates open. Linga gets out of one BMW, Hendrick out of the other. We know the routine. \nOnly, Mandela doesn't appear for his walk. Linga and Hendrick wait for a moment, then head in through the gate -- \nEXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n-- break into a sprint, when they see MANDELA'S FORM, CRUMPLED on the lawn. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - MORNING \nBarbara, Mary, the house staff, plus Linga, Hendrick, Etienne and Jason, all wait. All are scared. Nobody talks. \nThe SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS from on the top floor brings them to their feet. MANDELA'S DOCTOR descends the stairs. \nBARBARA What happened? \nDOCTOR It's simple exhaustion, but it'll lead to worse if it's not treated. He needs complete rest. And I don't mean just shifting the affairs of state to his bedroom. (MORE) \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) No phone calls, no visitors, no meetings. No politics. \nMARY You know him. He won't do that. \nDOCTOR Then I'm going to put him into hospital. In isolation. \nBARBARA No. Not yet. I'll threaten him with hospital if he doesn't behave. \nMARY I'll cancel everything. \nDOCTOR And I'll come back tonight to make sure he's not working. \nThe doctor leaves. The rest of them look at each other, relieved ... and maybe a little guilty, for letting things get this bad. \nBARBARA (to Mary, aside) Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan. Not yet. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - DAY \nDark. Curtains drawn. The door opens quietly. A shaft of light from the door shows Mandela, on his back in bed, eyes closed. \nBarbara enters. The sight of Mandela lying like this is chilling. It is too close to what he would look like lying in a casket. \nBarbara makes sure he is breathing. He is. She unplugs his phone, takes it. Unplugs his TV. Sweeps the room for papers, articles, legal briefs. For the first time, she takes an arm load of stuff away from him. She gives Mandela one last, long look, closes the door behind her. \nWe stay behind and look at Mandela, and ponder South Africa's fate if this were worse than just deep, sedated sleep. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SPRINGBOK TRAINING FACILITY - DAY \nChester Williams jogs under the tense eye of coach, trainer, manager and Pienaar. \nHe accelerates, running fast, but not sprinting. \nCOACH That's not good enough. \nChester opens it up. Full sprint, sustained. Pienaar grins. Chester is back. \nCOACH Let's hope the Samoans don't injure it again. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nONE, BRIEF SHOT of a typically brutal Samoan tackle, and the ensuing foul play in the maul. \nCUT TO: \nFOUR QUICK SHOTS of Chester williams scoring four tries. \nCUT TO: \nONE MORE SHOT of the Springboks trudging off the field. Every single player is bruised or bleeding, or both. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY \nLooking frail, but better than before, Mandela pencils in a score ON THE WORLD CUP BRACKET DIAGRAM: SOUTH AFRICA 42, WESTERN SAMOA 14. The diagram shows us that this was a quarter final match. \nWe can see that he has entered all the South African scores. \n(For the record: South Africa 27 - Australia 18; South Africa 21 - Romania 3; South Africa 20 - Canada 0.) \nFor the semi-finals, against South Africa, Mandela pencils in France. \nOn the other side of the bracket, Mandela pencils in England vs. the All Blacks. \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY \nMandela watches at home with Barbara and Mary. \nMANDELA Let's do some work while we watch. \nBarbara resists her natural impulse to work and says: \nBARBARA Just enjoy the rugby. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe sound of the match ON THE RADIO of one of the BMWs. Johan Lomu's name in every sentence. \nAll the bodyguards are out of the cars, enjoying the winter sunshine as they listen to the match. \nKWEZI So, let me understand this. The All Blacks are killing a team that thrashed us last year? \nETIENNE Thanks for reminding me. \nHendrick opens the trunk of their BMW, pulls out a RUGBY BALL, shows it to Linga. \nLinga nods. Okay. Throw it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUN CITY RESORT - DAY \nAnother Lomu try, and a ripple goes through the Springboks. \nSPRINGBOK HOOKER We're going to have to tackle better than the English, that's for sure. \nPIENAAR We do. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY \nTV blares. Barbara does some work. Mandela comes and peeks over her shoulder -- \nMANDELA Are those the judicial appointments for the Free State? \n-- and Barbara shuts the file. \nBARBARA They'll keep until after the match. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY \nA pile of guns in holsters, on the hood of a BMW. Suit jackets draped over the side mirrors. \nIn the wide street, in their shirts and ties, the boys toss the ball around. The white bodyguards handle the ball expertly, the black bodyguards for the first time in their lives. \nETIENNE Give it a spin when you pass it. (DEMONSTRATING) Like this. \nKwezi catches the ball, tries to throw it with spin, blows it. The ball bounces crazily all over the street, seems to have a mind of its own as it eludes Kwezi. \nThey all laugh. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUN CITY RESORT - DAY \nLomu scores his third try. \nSPRINGBOK WING How much does Lomu weigh? \nSPRINGBOK FLANK About 120 kilos. \nSPRINGBOK LOCK Shit, that's what I weigh. \nSPRINGBOK WING Ja, but at least you're slow. \nAs we will discover, the wing is going to have to defend against Lomu. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY \nMandela isn't watching TV. He's at the window, looking out at a GAME OF TOUCH RUGBY, taking place on the street outside his house. \nMANDELA Come and look at this. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY \nTwo mixed teams. Hendrick passes to Linga, who passes back to Hendrick, who scores. \nHENDRICK (PANTING) You should've played rugby. \nLINGA (PANTING) They wouldn't let me carry my gun. \nLaughter. This scene was unthinkable a year ago. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY \nBarbara and Mary stand next to Mandela at the window. Mandela's eyes twinkle with pleasure as he hears the laughter. In a way, this small moment already justifies everything he has done. Almost. \nHe gives Barbara a sly look. \nMANDELA Do you still think I'm wasting my time with the rugby? \nBefore Barbara can reply, excitement on the TV makes Mandela turn away. He looks at the TV just as Lomu scores his fourth try, to make it 42 - 15. Mandela shakes his head, awed. \nMANDELA Barbara, can you please tell the Minister of Sport that I need a detailed briefing on the All Blacks. \nBarbara gives Mandela a long look. \nAs in Cape Town, Pienaar stares out into the night, pensively. Preoccupied. \nSo preoccupied, that when Nerine enters quietly, he hardly turns. \nNERINE I brought one of your mom's protein shakes. \nPienaar nods, thanks. Nerine puts the protein shake down. She tries to read Pienaar's mood, see what he needs from her at this moment. \nNERINE Thinking about tomorrow? \nPIENAAR No, tomorrow's taken care of, one way or another. \nPienaar turns to her. \nPIENAAR I'm thinking about how you spend 30 years in a tiny cell, but come out ready to forgive the people who put you there. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWe have seen that solitary shape under the blankets before. We have seen the clock on the bedside table change from 4:59 to 5:00 before. We have seen Mandela's eyes open, immediately. \nBut we have never seen Mandela roll over and go back to sleep. \nSUPER: JUNE 24, 1995 - RUGBY WORLD CUP FINAL. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe two BWMs wait faithfully. \nINT. GREY BMW (LEAD) - NIGHT \nLinga looks at his watch. \nINT. GREY BMW (TRAILER) - NIGHT \nHendrick does the same. Gets out. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nLinga gets out, meets Hendrick at the gate. \nLINGA Big day. \nHENDRICK Be an even bigger day if we actually won. \nThen, they both look at their watches again. \nHENDRICK Where is he? \nThey share a worried look. Linga reaches for his radio. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMandela's bedroom door is opened from outside the room. Light from the hallway hits the bed. Mandela looks very still under the covers. \nMary peers in, concern wiping away sleep. She sees Mandela lying there. Mary tiptoes in, concern growing, until she stands over Mandela -- \n-- who opens his eyes without moving otherwise. \nMANDELA Can a man not sleep in, when he has a big day ahead of him? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMary's voice on Linga's radio. \nLINGA (INTO RADIO) Okay, thanks. Out. \nLinga lowers his radio, embarrassed. \nLINGA He's sleeping in. \nHENDRICK Or was. \nLinga and Hendrick stand at the gate for a moment, then turn to head back to their respective cars. Linga pauses. \nLINGA I had an idea. About today. (BEAT) It's a crazy idea. \nHENDRICK Hey, don't worry, man. I already know you're crazy. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nMandela eats breakfast -- porridge and fresh fruit -- and looks over the newspaper headlines, all screaming about today's World Cup final. \nThe doorbell rings, and he pauses, listens to the sound of voices at the door -- then the sound of heavy footsteps approaching through the house. \nMandela wipes his mouth and waits. Linga and Hendrick appear in the doorway. They look even bigger indoors. \nMANDELA Morning, boys. \nLINGA & HENDRICK Morning, Madiba. \nMANDELA What is it? \nLinga hesitates -- until Hendrick gives him a (for Hendrick) discreet nudge. \nHENDRICK Linga had an idea, sir. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - DAY \nMary walks briskly to her car, gets in and drives towards the opening gate, fast. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - MORNING \nMandela emerges into daylight, wearing not a suit, not a Madiba shirt -- \n-- he is wearing Francois Pienaar's green and gold number 6 rugby jersey. \nOn his head is THE SPRINGBOK CAP given to him by the team in CAPE TOWN \nThe crowd catches its breath. This is unprecedented, shocking ... and brilliant. \nThe Springboks digest this extraordinary display of support. \nSPRINGBOK HOOKER (murmuring to Pienaar) The All Blacks won't like that. \nPienaar nods, eyes glinting. Mandela is giving them an edge. \nAs he walks towards the waiting teams, Mandela lifts the Springbok cap high, waves it, and fires his famous, beautiful, huge, African smile at the crowd -- \n-- who roar and stand, slowly, and start chanting, slowly ... \nCROWD Nelson ... Nelson ... Nelson ... NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON ... \n63 000 South Africans, chanting as one. \nCUT TO: \nA QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS \nALL ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA, THE CHANT ECHOES through EMPTY STREETS. Not a soul, not a car to be seen. Everyone is inside, watching TV. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nCROWD ... NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON ... etc. \nMandela shakes hands with the Springboks, who are brimming with pride. Mandela shakes Chester Williams' hand with special energy. \nMANDELA I'm so glad you're here. \nChester beams. \nCUT TO: \nIN THE STANDS, EUNICE ULULATES, loud African warrior woman call. Mr. Pienaar looks at her, shocked. Looks at her as a person for the first time, maybe. \nMR. PIENAAR DO THAT AGAIN! \nEunice ululates again. \nCUT TO: \nON THE FIELD, Mandela shakes hands with the All Blacks, who, as predicted, don't like his partisan clothing. Mandela looks up at Jonah Lomu. \nMANDELA Hello, Jonah. \nLomu looks down at Mandela, eyes glowing with aggression -- \n-- and suddenly, he bares his tattooed Tongan tongue in a FIERCE WAR CRY. \nAs do the rest of the All Blacks. \nWE HAVE SEGUED TO THE FAMOUS HAKA, a Maori war dance that tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen, their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their skulls with a sharpened tea spoon. \nIt is abundantly clear why, as the Minister of Sports told Mandela, half of the All Blacks matches are won before the whistle blows. \nThis is very intimidating. \nEspecially because, this day, the All Blacks push the haka closer and closer to the Springboks -- \n-- who do not back down. In fact, they close ranks and advance. \nMajor, major international smackdown. This is not fake. The emotions, the aggression are real. \nON MANDELA, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a warrior's glitter in his eyes. He wants to respond, primally. His fists clench at his side. \nThe HAKA ENDS with a fearsome, guttural Maori yell. \nON THE SPRINGBOKS, massed together, faces red with emotion, pulses racing. \nMandela takes a deep breath in. \nThen the boys answer. \nWith, of course, a terrorist anthem of their own: NKOSI SIKELEL' IAFRIKA. \nPienaar starts it. \nPIENAAR NKOSI -- \nALL SPRINGBOKS -- SIKELEL' IAFRIKA etc ... \nWith decent pronunciation, with full fervor and heart, THE BOYS ROAR THE ANTHEM back at the All Blacks. \nThe crowd joins them. \"Nkosi\" roars through the stadium, through the nation. \nON MANDELA: his heart swells, as he sings with his people. \nCUT TO: \nON JASON, who stands surrounded by his former enemies singing the song that kept him -- kept all of them -- going through the apartheid years. \nIn this stadium, at this moment, all hostility, all fear, are a thing of the past. \nThe tension finally goes out of Jason's shoulders. \nON JASON'S FACE, close to tears, as NKOSI slowly fades. \nAs Mandela said -- a very inspirational song. \nBEGIN HEARTBEAT OVER. Is that a heartbeat, or an African drum? \nCUT TO: \nON THE FIELD, the All Black fly half tees up the ball, for kick off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nTwo sets of bruised, bleeding, exhausted, cramping men face each other for the extra time kick off. \nPienaar turns to his men. \nPIENAAR Who's the fittest team on this field? \nThe answer lies in their eyes: they are. \nAn All Black penalty goal makes it 12 - 9 almost immediately. \nA Springbok penalty goal answers. 12 - 12. \nSeven minutes from the end of extra time, the Springboks earn a scrum deep in All Blacks territory. \nPIENAAR Keep it here. Run it forward. \nThe scrum goes down, wheels a little. \nSPRINGBOK FLY HALF Francois! Pienaar turns his head. The fly half taps his own chest: give me the ball. \nPienaar hesitates, then nods to the scrum half: give him the ball. \nThe ball goes into the scrum. \nThe ball works its way back through the feet of the eight Springbok forwards. \nThe scrum half gathers it, spins it out to the fly half -- \n-- who takes one step to his left and KICKS A DROP GOAL high into the air. \nBall soaring past a backdrop of open mouths. Higher than the uprights ... \n... but through them nonetheless. \nSpringboks 15 - 12 All Blacks. \nAn entire nation jumps to its feet. \nINT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY \nEveryone is on their feet in the press box. \nMANDELA How long before the end? \nMINISTER OF SPORT Seven minutes. \nThey turn out to be the longest seven minutes in Mandela's life. In every South African's life. \nBEGIN CLIMAX SEQUENCE: \nThis is where we fold the Rainbow Nation into the rugby match, fully. \nINTERCUT BETWEEN PEOPLE ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE RUGBY as we show the whole nation wanting exactly the same thing at the same time. Faces, postures, eyes are identical, no matter where they are, who they are, what color they are. \n(It would be nice if we used all the faces we've already cut away to throughout this story.) \nON THE FIELD \nThe All Blacks attack desperately. The Springboks tackle and tackle and tackle. \nON PIENAAR, totally spent but dragging himself to his feet for another tackle. \nHe glances over at the referee, makes another tackle -- \n-- looks over at the referee -- \n-- the referee puts his hands on his whistle -- \n-- another tackle, another look -- \n-- the referee lifts the whistle to his lips -- \n-- another tackle, another look -- \n-- the REFEREE BLOWS THE FINAL WHISTLE. \nIt's over. \nThe Springboks have won. \nEND CLIMAX SEQUENCE \nEXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nPandemonium on the field, pandemonium in the stands. \nJason is hugged by an ecstatic boer (Jason is not a hugger). \nCUT TO: \nMrs. Pienaar and Nerine are in tears. Mr. Pienaar hugs a shocked Eunice. \nINT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY \nPandemonium in the VIP box. Mandela shakes hands with everyone he can find. It is way too loud to say anything. \nHendrick and Linga almost hug. Almost. They shake hands with total joy and engagement, whack each other on the shoulder. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OUTSIDE ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nSipho toi-tois next to the cop car (a township war dance, very political). The two cops toi-toi with him. \nCUT TO: \nAROUND THE NATION, an EPIDEMIC OF HUGGING begins. This spills out onto the streets later, but for now, let's restrict this to the people who've been watching the match together. \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_input": "MR. PIENAAR I feel sorry for you, son. You've got your whole life ahead of you. What's it going to be like now? \nMRS. PIENAAR (late 40's) enters holding some kind of PROTEIN SHAKE for Pienaar. \nMRS. PIENAAR Don't be so gloomy. (handing over shake) I added vitamins -- there's a horrible flu bug going around. Tell Nerine when you get home. \nPIENAAR Thanks, ma. \nMR. PIENAAR I'm telling you, Francois -- look at Angola, look at Mozambique. Look at Zimbabwe. We're next. They're going to take our jobs and drive us into the sea. Just you wait. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY \nMagnificent, sweeping government buildings made of carved African field stone, with an Italian tiled roof, situated on a hill overlooking Pretoria. The seat of power. \nToday, the entrance is mobbed with a huge, joyous, multi- racial throng, plus news crews from all over the world. Lots of new South African flags evident. \nWe move through the throng and swoop up into the air, so that we can soar along the outside of the building and LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOWS into the offices of state -- \n-- where people who worked for the De Klerk regime are packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the Mandela regime. These characters run the gamut from little old Afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of grand apartheid. They are all white. A good third of the offices are already deserted. \nThe deserted offices have open doors. Through a window, through an open door, we see Mandela and his bodyguards striding down a Union Building hallway. \nWe swoop in through the window -- \nINT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY \n-- and catch up with the new President. Mandela is regal in a magnificent tailored suit. Jason in front, Linga behind. \nPORTRAITS of the architects and champions of apartheid look down sternly on them as they pass. \nThey pass a WORKER hanging a PORTRAIT OF MANDELA next to one of De Klerk, the previous President. \nON LINGA, as he smiles at that. \nMandela, on the other hand, looks into the empty offices, and into the offices being packed up. \nUp ahead, the double doors to the OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, are closed. Jason speeds up, opens them, pokes his head in, then opens the doors wide. \nJASON (with great pride) After you, Mr. President. \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY \nMandela's offices are fronted by a LARGE RECEPTION AREA, already filled with PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE HIM. \nTo one side are his CHIEF OF STAFF'S SUITE of offices, to the other side, the SMALL PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY OFFICE. \nBeyond these are MANDELA'S SECRETARIES, TYPISTS AND ASSISTANTS -- his gatekeepers. \nBeyond that is the inner sanctum, MANDELA'S OWN OFFICE. \nThe phones are ringing off the hook. Fax machines are chattering. Everyone wants a piece of Mandela. \nMandela enters, Jason and Linga behind him. \nMANDELA Good morning everybody. \nALL (GREETINGS) \nBARBARA MASEKELA, Mandela's CHIEF OF STAFF (and now Ambassador to the U.S.), emerges from her office, carrying an arm load of files, folders and papers -- \nMANDELA Barbara, good morning. You've had your hair done. I like it. \n-- accompanies Mandela back towards his office. \nBARBARA Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk about your cabinet appointments and ministers. \nMANDELA Give me one moment, please. \nBarbara waits outside Mandela's office, as he enters ahead of her. \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY \nMandela stands in the middle of his office, takes a moment to savor where he is. \nThen, he takes off his jacket, hangs it up and is ready for work. \nMANDELA BARBARA -- \nBarbara enters. \nMANDELA -- please assemble the staff for me. Whoever has not already left. \nBARBARA Right now? All of them? \nMANDELA Yes, please. \nCUT TO: \nINT. UNION BUILDING STAFF DINING ROOM - DAY \nWhat's left of the UNION BUILDING STAFF are packed into the DINING ROOM. White faces, bitter and resentful. Waiting to be fired. \nThrough the glass doors, THEY SEE MANDELA APPROACHING DOWN THE HALLWAY, Linga and Jason with him. \nSTAFF MEMBER#1 Here he comes. \nSTAFF MEMBER#2 He wants the satisfaction of firing us himself. \nThey stand up straight, determined to receive the ax with pride. \nINT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY \nLinga and Jason amp up when they see the room full of restless Afrikaners. At the STAFF DINING ROOM DOOR, Mandela turns to them. \nMANDELA I'd like you to stay out here, please. \nJASON But, Madiba ... \nMANDELA I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding behind men with guns. \nMandela opens the doors and enters. Jason and Linga stay outside ... just. \n", "test1_true": "Mandela enters, smiles -- gets not one smile in return. \nMANDELA (IN AFRIKAANS) Gooie more almal. \nSTAFF MEMBER (ASIDE) Does he think greeting us in Afrikaans makes this any sweeter? \nMANDELA Some of you may know who I am. \nThis gets a few bitter chuckles. Mandela is at this best just talking to people, like this. Only, he doesn't just talk to them, he wades in amongst them, shaking hands and making individual contact as he speaks to all of them. \nMANDELA Good morning ... how are you ... thank you for coming at such short notice ... etc. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nMandela is a continual security nightmare. You can see the tension on Jason and Linga's faces as he disappears into the throng. \nBACK TO: \nWhen Mandela reaches the middle of the room, he stops shaking hands, and turns slowly as he talks to everybody. \nMANDELA I couldn't help noticing the empty offices as I came to work today. And all the packing boxes. \nOne black man, surrounded by a throng of serious white faces. \nMANDELA Now, of course, if you want to leave, that is your right. And if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government, then it is better that you do leave, right away. \nHe can be tough and blunt, when necessary. \nMANDELA But if you are packing up because you fear that your language, or the color of your skin, or who you served previously, disqualifies you from working here now, I am here to tell you, have no such fear. (BEAT) Wat is verby is verby. What's past is past. We look to the future, now. \nThis is not what they expected to hear. \nMANDELA We need your help. We want your help. If you would like to stay, you will be doing your country a great service. \nMandela pauses, to look at the faces. They are receptive. \nMANDELA I ask only that you do your jobs to the best of your abilities, and with good hearts. I promise to do the same. (BEAT) If we can manage that, our country will be a shining light in the world. \nCUT TO: \nJason and Linga are right outside the glass doors, looking in and listening. Jason shakes his head. \nJASON He wants to win them over, one damn boer at a time. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY \nMandela heads back through to his office, Barbara, Mary and other assistants forming a phalanx around him. Linga peels off, goes into the security office. \nJason stands at the desk of one of the assistants (JESSIE), waits for her to finish a call, then: \nJASON Molo, sister. \nJESSIE (FRAZZLED) It's still morning? \nJason grins. \nJASON When you get a chance, can we see the schedule for the month? We need to plan security. \nJessie's phone rings. \nJESSIE (ANSWERING PHONE) Office of the President, good morning. \nJessie waves Jason off. He crosses to the security office, enters. \nINT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY \nOnce he closes the door behind him, Jason shows his fatigue. Linga is feet-up on the sofa, sucking on a cup of coffee. Three more bodyguards -- SAM, KWEZI and WINSTON -- slump in chairs. \nJason grabs coffee, sits at his desk, puts his feet up with a groan. \nJASON We need more men. \nLINGA Did you talk to Barbara about it? \nJASON Yesterday. \nA knock at the door. \nJASON That's Jessie, with the schedule. (LOUDLY) Come in, beautiful. \nThe door opens -- but what enters is not beautiful. \nFOUR BIG WHITE COPS in suits enter, Special Branch written all over them. ETIENNE VAN ECK, HENDRICK BOOYENS, GEORGE and WILLEM. \nThe bodyguards stand up like junk yard dogs protecting their territory. \nJASON What is this? \nETIENNE Mr. Jason Tshabalala? \nJASON That's me. Am I under arrest? \nEtienne snaps out a crisp salute. \nETIENNE Captain Van Eck and team reporting for duty, sir. \nHendrick, George and Willem snap out salutes. Their military deportment contrasts strongly with the less rigid body language of the black bodyguards. \nJASON What duty? \nETIENNE We're the Presidential bodyguard. We've been assigned to this office. (holding out a sheet of PAPER) Here are our orders. \nJason takes the orders, studies them, face increasingly angry. \nLINGA (TO HENDRICK) You're Special Branch, right? \nHendrick nods, sternly. Linga, Sam, Kwezi and Winston react to that -- there is a long and brutal history between them and the Special Branch. \nETIENNE You'll see that they've been signed. \n", "test1_id": 681, "test2_input": "From memory, Mandela writes the first line of the poem: \nOut of the night that covers me ...

JASON We're not going to decide which way we bring him in until the very last moment. (BEAT) We need uniforms, plain clothes, sharp-shooters ... \nLINGA And sniffer dogs. \nJASON Yes. No truck bombs, no Oklahoma City. \nThe locals stir, share a look. This is going to be a nightmare. \nJASON We've got an army unit on standby at Silvermine, if you need more men. \nNot an option the cops favor, judging by their faces. \nJASON We're not taking any chances, okay. The President's going to be very exposed. (BEAT) Much too exposed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY \nThe silver Mercedes tools into Cape Town past Groote Schuur. Mandela travels with Barbara, who opens her first file of the journey -- but is forestalled by her boss. \nMANDELA Barbara, I have been studying. \nBARBARA For the summit in Taiwan? Good. \nMANDELA No. Not exactly. \nMandela hands Barbara a folded SPORTS SECTION. \nMANDELA Test me. \nBarbara unfolds the sports section -- \n-- to reveal COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SPRINGBOK SQUAD. A collector's pull-out. \nBarbara looks at the photos, shakes her head. \nBARBARA They look like thugs. \nMandela just smiles at that remark. \nMANDELA Block out the names. See if I can recognize them. \nBarbara gives her boss a put-upon look -- this is such a waste of time! -- but blocks out the first row of names. Mandela points at the first photo. \nMANDELA Andre Joubert. (NEXT PHOTO) (MORE) \nMANDELA (CONT'D) Gavin Johnson. (BEAT) Did I get them right? \nBARBARA Yes, Madiba. \nMANDELA (immensely pleased with HIMSELF) This is how I used to study in law school.

CAPE TOWN STREETS - EVENING \nThe entire Springbok squad has been on a training run through Cape Town, on ordinary streets, through ordinary people. \n(This is unthinkable in top-level sports anywhere else. It really happened.) \nWhen they are recognized, drivers toot their horns, pedestrians cheer, kids on bicycles ride with them (mostly still white). \nAs they approach the hotel grounds, Pienaar surges to the front, so that he can give them a message as they pass through the hotel gate. \nPIENAAR Players-only meeting in the team room after dinner. \nINT.

We can't just mouth the words anymore. \nSPRINGBOK HOOKER Nobody cares, as long as we win matches. \nPIENAAR They do care. \nSPRINGBOK LOCK It's their song, not ours. \nSPRINGBOK WING It's a terrorist song. \nSPRINGBOK PROP They used to arrest you for singing it. \nPIENAAR And now it's one of our anthems. \nBut he's talking to a deeply conservative group of guys. \nSPRINGBOK HOOKER Cap.

I definitely can't pronounce the words. \nOne look at his men, and Pienaar knows he has hit a wall. \nPIENAAR Okay, boys. It's optional. Take it if you want to. \nThe players are relieved.

It is a very rough game. Almost as rough as politics. \nBoland laughs. \nBEGIN BOLAND BOTHA/MANDELA INTERVIEW SEQUENCE \nSHOTS OF BOOZE BEING DELIVERED to people's houses all over the country by BOTTLE STORE DELIVERY VANS (a very South African alcoholic enabling service). Lots and lots of booze. \nBOLAND BOTHA (V.O.) How do you think the Springboks will do? \nMANDELA (V.O.) I think they will do very well. Their level of commitment is tremendous. \nTHE SPRINGBOKS TRAIN on an isolated field at the SILVERMINE ARMY BASE outside Cape Town. Tactics and refinements, not fitness training. \nBOLAND BOTHA (V.O.) Now, it's been said that you used to support any team who played against the Springboks. \nMANDELA (V.O.) Obviously, that is no longer true. I am one hundred percent behind our boys. \nJASON, ETIENNE, LINGA and HENDRICK stand anxiously outside Newlands Stadium. One of them points to the top of a tall building nearby -- a Eureka! moment, for reasons we don't yet understand. \nBACK TO THE STUDIO: \nMANDELA After all, if I cannot change when circumstances demand it, how can I ask others to? \nEND BOLAND BOTHA/MANDELA INTERVIEW SEQUENCE \nEXT.

(This is pre-9/11.) \nHe lifts his radio to his mouth. \nJASON (INTO RADIO) Do you see that jet, to the east? \nCUT TO: \nEtienne, in another part of the stadium, looks eastwards -- sees it. \nETIENNE (INTO RADIO) Did they get clearance for this? \nCUT TO: \nJASON (INTO RADIO) Not from us. \nThe 747 gets closer, fast. \nJason is hit by a horrible thought. \nJASON (INTO RADIO) Where is he? \nLINGA (ON RADIO) VIP BOX. \nJason finds the VIP box, looks out at the 747 -- \n-- and realizes that the jet is heading straight at that side of the stadium. \nJASON (INTO RADIO) Get him out of there. Now. \nCUT TO: \nINT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY \nMandela is not in his seat. Linga turns. Hendrick points at the closed door of the VIP bathroom. \nLINGA (INTO RADIO) No time. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nJason has to fight down the impulse to flee. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY \nEveryone in the VIP box sees the jet. They all stand. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nThe 747 nose appears over the rim of the stadium. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. 747 COCKPIT - DAY \nCAPTAIN Full throttle. \nCaptain and co-pilot go full throttle, yank the 747 straight upwards. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nThe ALMIGHTY ROAR OF FULL THROTTLES fills the stadium, as the 747 passes less than 200 feet overhead -- \n-- so that everyone can read the huge letters painted on the bottom of the wings: \nGOOD LUCK BOKKE \n(This really happened.) \nTHE CROWD GOES WILD. \nJASON NEARLY FAINTS with relief. \nINT. VIP BOXES - ELLIS PARK - DAY \nLinga and Hendrick share a look. They have just had a brush with the unthinkable. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nTHE DRESSING ROOM VIBRATES with the roar ... \nSPRINGBOK WING What the hell was that? \n... which slowly fades ... \n... leaving only the background roar of the revved up crowd. \nThe boys jog in place, dying for the release of rugby. Pienaar appears to be praying, silently. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nThe REFEREE walks off the field, into the tunnel, stands there for a moment, then raises his whistle to his mouth and blows a LONG, ECHOING BLAST -- \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY \n-- which is the signal to come to the field. \nThe cop opens the door, throws down a full parade ground salute as Pienaar leads his men out of the dressing room. \nPIENAAR Breathe, boys. Breathe. \nINT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nWITH THE `BOKS, we head down the hallway, down some stairs to the tunnel onto the field -- \n-- where the referee holds his hand up like a traffic cop, keeping the boys in a line in the tunnel. \nAs they wait, they hear the CRUNCHING APPROACH OF BIG MEN IN CLEATS. \nDown the opposite stairway come THE ALL BLACKS. This is the first time we have seen them in the flesh. \nHuge men, black on black uniforms, arrogant. Been here before, done this before. The best in the world, expecting nothing but the best from the day. \nThey ignore the Springboks, dismiss them, line up next to them in the tunnel. \nThe SOUND OF THIRTY MEN JOGGING IN PLACE in their cleats, on the concrete, sounds like a drum roll before a medieval battle. \nThe Springbok wing sneaks a peek at JONAH LOMU. \nThe biggest, fastest wing ever. Even bigger looking in this confined space. Bigger than the Springbok wing, bigger than any of the Springbok backs, bigger than most of the Springbok forwards. \nThe referee nods to both captains, turns, and leads them onto the field -- \nEXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \n-- where the already-whipped up crowd goes crazy, as both teams sprint onto the field and go through their brief warm- up ritual. \nWE FOCUS ON THE CROWD, focus on how white and old South Africa most of them are. \nThe referee blows his whistle again, and both teams assemble in a line, facing each other. Glaring like boxers across immaculate green grass. \nINT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \nSeen only in silhouette, Mandela walks down the tunnel. He is flanked by Jason, The Minister of Sport and the President of SA Rugby. \nLinga, as always, has Mandela's back. Plus Hendrick. \nEXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY \n", "test3_id": 683}

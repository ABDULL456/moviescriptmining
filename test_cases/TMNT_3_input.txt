EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT 
Nightwatcher runs along the rooftops. He pauses. He lifts his visor to feel the night air on his face. He sees WINTERS TOWER in the distance... practically egging him on. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PETE'S DINER - CONTINUOUS 
Classic Diner design, Pete's Diner is closed for the evening. The last light goes out. 
INT. PETE'S DINER - CONTINUOUS 
A greasy DINER COOK finishes cleaning up the tables. He suddenly hears a noise in the back. Big CLANK. KITCHEN - He walks to the back. He hears the noise... now from inside the WALK-IN FREEZER. He slowly approaches it. ANOTHER NOISE. He moves to open INSIDE OF FREEZER - the door slowly opens. The man's face peers in. His eyes go WIDE. He SCREAMS!!! 
EXT. ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS 
Nightwatcher hears the scream. Runs to the source and looks down at Pete's Diner. Sees the commotion inside. Uses his bolo chain and a power cable to form a ZIP LINE down the street as- 
INT. PETE'S DINER - MOMENTS LATER 
-KERSMASH! He goes through the front window! He stands, cat- like. Ready for anything. The room is only lit by the neon signage behind the counter. Suddenly - Night creeps to the freezer. He can hear the CHEWING and the SNARLING behind the thick door. He takes out a spiked brass- knuckle. Ready. Places a hand on the door... and opens it. ON DOORWAY - The creature is huddled over a pile of frozen meat. Chewing with pieces flying everywhere. Disgusting. It turns around - monkey-like and ferocious looking DEMON... but "cute" in a bizarre kinda way. Music builds as go- WIDER ON SIDE VIEW - Night stands there. The horrible demon creature suddenly jumps out of the freezer too! Face off with Raph as we realize- -it's only THREE FEET TALL! 
NIGHTWATCHER Hey there little fella. All that commotion for just little ole y- The Demon SCREAMS! It jumps Night, slamming him to the floor behind a row of tables! 
NIGHTWATCHER (O.S.) 
WAHH! OOOF! AAAGGH! OW!! WHOAAA!!! Plates, glasses and utensils fly everywhere, smashing all over the diner as the Demon pummels him. CLOSE ON NIGHT - The Demon is jumping up and down, slamming his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor! It lunges forward, mouth open as Night backhands it with a PLATE. The Demon jumps back and up, landing on a rotating CEILING FAN. 
T he creature lunges down again, but this time, Night is ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped up on cocaine. A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night knows he's there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his pocket. And waits... until... ...the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside! WIDE - POOOMPH! POOOMPH! POOOMPH! The pellets explode in its mouth, sending smoke shooting out of it's nostrils, ears and eyes! It shrieks, flying out of the Diner! 
A 
NIGHTWATCHER (victory taunting) Yeah! That's what I thought! Don't mess with the Nightwatcher! Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on the side of his head to see through the thick smoke. He finds the DINER COOK huddled behind the counter. Night looks scary. 
DINER COOK Pl-pl-please don't hurt me! 
NIGHTWATCHER Whattaya talkin' about? I JUST 
SAVED YOU! 
DINER COOK Please, sir. I have kids. Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor. He picks it up, puts it on the counter. 
NIGHTWATCHER There ya go, pal. Make sure this is safe. HEY - YOU HEARIN' ME? 
DINER COOK 
TAKE IT! JUST TAKE IT! DON'T HURT 
ME, PLEASE! 
NIGHTWATCHER 
LISTEN! I DON'T WANT YER FRIGGIN' 
CASH! WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE SUCH A 
HARD TIME BELIEVIN' I'M A GOOD GUY? (points threatening) 
I JUST SAVED YOUR STINKIN' LIFE! Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash register till! Night jumps. Looks out the window. CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the Diner and to the rooftop across the street... and over the green shoulders of LEO. ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of Nightwatcher standing over him, holding the register. CLOSE ON LEO - He's fuming. Staring down at Nightwatcher. The frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him. 
B ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the register. Trying to figure out his next move.

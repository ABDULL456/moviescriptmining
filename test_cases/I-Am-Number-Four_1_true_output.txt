EXT. PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Sarah steps out just in time to see John climb into a pickup truck. It's the one from Sam's garage. 
SARAH John! He looks back. 
JOHN It's Henri. I have to go. Sorry. OFF her confused disappointment as the truck SQUEALS away... 
INT. PICKUP - NIGHT - MOVING 
Sam is behind the wheel. 
JOHN Thanks. I owe you. 
SAM Anything to get out of Thanksgiving at my house. He offers John a weary smile. 
SAM I checked out that blog on the way over. Saw the video. What was the deal with your ankle? John pulls up his khakis, shows Sam the trio of scars. 
JOHN Death scars. 
SAM They kind of look like the symbols in my dad's research. 
(THINKING) You guys don't -- 
JOHN Abduct people? No. Irritated, he covers them back up. 
SAM How about the ones you said were hunting you? 
JOHN They're capable of anything. 
(URGENT) We need to get to Warsaw -- now. 
Suddenly, John's cell phone RINGS. He snatches it up, but is disappointed to see the name âSARAHâ flashing on the LCD. He hits ignore and the truck hurtles into the dark. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's a dilapidated Victorian. Mist shrouds the yard which is littered with junked cars and trash. The pickup crawls to a stop in the shadows across the street. 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT 
The teens sit in silence. 
JOHN Number 417. Henri tracked the URL to that house. Sam scans the street. 
SAM I don't see his SUV anywhere. 
JOHN He would have parked it across town. Sam opens the glove compartment and pulls out a revolver. 
SAM Stole it from Ed. 
(BEAT) Let's move. John yanks Sam's arm away from the door handle. 
JOHN I called you because I needed a ride, not a sidekick. If I could have run here, I would have. 
(BEAT) Go home. I'll call you when I get back. OFF Sam as John climbs out alone... 
EXT. WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's graveyard quiet. John nervously sneaks down the side of the house. His breath fogs as he inch-CREAKS up the wooden 
STEPS TO 
THE KITCHEN PORCH.

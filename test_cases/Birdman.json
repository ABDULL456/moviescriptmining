I'm gonna have to start from scratch, with less than twenty-four hours... Let's see if these-- \nHe turns to see a completely naked Mike. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Holy-- What is happening? Where are your underpants? \nMIKE At home, under the bed, I think. \nSam glances at Mike for a second, then returns to her phone. Larry begins to help Mike into some pants which, given the situation, is very awkward. \nLARRY Okay. Everything is too small. \nSAM Yeah, you're not kidding. \nLesley enters the room immediately coming face to face with a naked Mike. She doesn't notice Sam who is partially hidden by a clothes rack. She just goes about trying a costume shirt. LESLEY Oh, that's nice... (To Larry.) Forgive him, Larry. Mike's like my five year old son. Neither one of them has clean underwear... \nLARRY Or pubic hair, I imagine. (Folding the pants.) Okay, well, I can take out the suit but we're going to need some new pants and shirts. (MORE) (CONTINUED) LARRY (CONT'D) (Looking back.) And underwear... \nMike just stands there naked, staring at his penis in the mirror. \nLESLEY (To Larry.) This is too small. (To Mike.) What the hell are you doing? MIKE Waiting for Larry to finish. \nLARRY I'm finished. \nLarry disappears deeper into the costume room. \nMIKE Okay, well, then I'm just standing here with my balls out. \nLESLEY Get dressed. Riggan's daughter is hanging around, and I don't need her to walk in here and-- \nMIKE Leslie... \nLESLEY No, Mike. You haven't seen her. She's always hanging around, just-- I don't-- Watching everyone. It's creepy. It's-- \nMIKE Les... \nLESLEY I don't know if the drugs fried her brain or what, but I don't need her running to her father saying you showed her your junk. \nMIKE Okay, then we should probably get her out of here. \nLesley's expression goes blank. \nLESLEY Oh, God. Really? \n(CONTINUED) \nMIKE Hey, Sammy... \nSAM It's Sam. \nLESLEY Fuck. \nSam steps forward. LESLEY (CONT'D) (To Sam.) I didn't mean-- \nSAM (Totally relaxed.) It's cool. He's a handful, huh? \nThey both look back at Mike. LESLEY Almost. \nSam smiles at her and exits. Lesley wheels on Mike. \nLESLEY (CONT'D) Jesus... How is it you always manage to find a new way to humiliate me? \nMIKE To be fair, you make it really easy. \nLESLEY What the hell was she doing here? \nMIKE She brought me. \nLESLEY And stayed??? MIKE I know, right? She's a little-- \nLESLEY Look at me, Mike. This is Broadway. I'm here. Finally. And I'm begging you, if you love me, please, do me a favor... don't fuck it up. \n", "test1_true": "(CONTINUED) \nLesley moves toward Mike. He cups her face in his hands tenderly. They are face to face. \nMIKE (CONT'D) Play with my balls... \nShe twists his nipples hard and walks out. \nMIKE (CONT'D) I won't fuck it up... Probably! Larry reappears holding some clothes. We follow him out... \n10   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            10 ...through the hallway. He walks by Jake and Riggan who are mid conversation. We stay with them. \nRIGGAN (O.S.) I don't care, sign it. JAKE (O.S.) Listen to me. \nRIGGAN (O.S.) No you listen to me-- \nJAKE (O.S.) I can't afford to listen to you... \nLARRY I'm gonna need to go shopping again. \nJAKE Fucking sew something, you old fuck! \nRIGGAN I don't care. Give him what he wants. JAKE His agent is asking for almost four times what we were paying-- \nRIGGAN Then go into the reserve. \nJAKE The reserve is gone. You spent it on the fog. And those fake trees... (CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN It's a dream sequence, it-- \nJAKE And three union midgets that dance around like-- \nRIGGAN You're not supposed to call them midgets-- JAKE The reserve is gone! \nRIGGAN Listen to me, you didn't see what I just saw. But you will, at the preview tomorrow. Look, get the contract done. I'll get the money. \nRiggan begins marching toward the stage. JAKE (Calling after him.) When??? \nLaura comes down some stairs and chases Riggan. \nLAURA (Incredulous.) Hey, is it true? Shiner? \nRIGGAN He's in. \nLAURA Holy shit! When can I meet him? \nRIGGAN He's in a fitting with Larry. Lesley comes down the hallway. \nLESLEY I'm going to Starbucks. You guys want anything? \nRIGGAN I'm fine. How's Mike? \nLESLEY Did you talk to your daughter? \nRIGGAN No. (CONTINUED) \nLESLEY He's great. \nLAURA (To Lesley. Matter-of- factly.) Honey, your tits look like fucking anjou pears in that top! \nLESLEY (Uncomfortable.) Okay, well I'm gonna-- Thank you. \nShe walks away. \nLAURA And that ass. Like two eggs in a hanky! \nA10                                                                 A10 \nRiggan walks, Laura follows him. \nLAURA Okay, I was going to tell you this over dinner, but everything-- I have some news too. RIGGAN Good or bad? Cause right now-- \nA technician walks by. \nLAURA (Whispering.) I missed my last two periods. (Beat.) I think it's happening this time. \n", "test1_id": 2163, "test2_input": "BIRDMAN (V.O.) It's always 'we' brother. \nThe television turns on by itself, playing an episode of the original Birdman cartoon. Riggan points his fingers at the tv and sends it hurling at the shadow. Then he proceeds to destroy everything in his room with his telekinetic powers. \nWe slowly pan to see that, behind Riggan, Jake stands on the other side of the half-opened door. We push in on Jake, watching in shock. The camera turns and becomes Jake's POV... \n35   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          35 \n...and now, from his view, we see Riggan yelling at the shadow. \nRIGGAN Fuck you! Fuck you! \nHe picks up a chair and throws it down. He then picks up the newspaper from the floor and tossing it all around. And now we understand that he is not using telepathy. He has been using only his hands. Completely mad. As Riggan turns to pick up something else, he spots Jake on the other side of the door. He immediately calms himself and walks over. (CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) What's up? \nJAKE Um... Well. Two hours to curtain. Why don't you rest a little bit? \nRIGGAN Yeah. Sure. \nJAKE Last preview, buddy. We're almost there. \nRIGGAN Okay. \nJAKE How ya doin? \nRIGGAN Good. Great. JAKE Good. That's good. (A beat.) The, uh, money came through. I just have to transfer it to the account. \nRIGGAN Oh, that's terrific... \nJAKE Okay. Well, I'm gonna do that. (He stares at Riggan who seems about to collapse.) You know I'm proud of you, right? This took balls. And you did it. \nRiggan nods. An exhausted sadness in his eyes. \nRIGGAN I can't do this anymore, Jake. \nJAKE What? \nRIGGAN I think I'm gonna cancel the preview. I'm exhausted. \nJAKE It's a joke, right? (He forces a laugh.) Good one, Riggan. \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN I'm starting to believe that this is not for me. The applause is... lukewarm. I think they're laughing at me. \nJAKE What are you--? Listen. There's a three block line of people waiting to see you. We are sold out. It's a full house. \nRIGGAN Really? \nJAKE Yes. And the French embassador is coming. And the prince of Saudi Arabia, with one of his wives. And... I wasn't going to tell you this, but-- Martin Scorsese. He's casting for his new film. But don't tell anyone, okay? This is between you and me. RIGGAN Okay. I'll be ready. \nRiggan smiles. He has forgotten about his existential doubts. A worried Jake closes the door. He walks a few steps and finds Laura and Lesley. They've been listening to his conversation with Riggan. \nLESLEY How is he? \nJAKE He'll be okay. \nLESLEY Poor creature. \nLAURA Is it true? Scorsese? JAKE Yes. And the new Pope too. (Beat.) \nThey both understand. \nLAURA You're an asshole, Jake. \nJAKE I'm the one keeping this boat afloat. \n(CONTINUED) \nLESLEY So there is no line of people out there? \nJAKE I don't know. Now go and get ready. That's your job. (He begins to walk.) I'll better invest in a taco truck, or a strip joint near the airport. \nLaura leaves. We follow Lesley up to Riggan's dressing room. She knocks on the door. Nothing. Silence. She half-opens the door and, from behind her, we see Riggan examining his right hand. He has blood falling from the palm to the wrist. \n", "test2_true": "RIGGAN (Smiles.) Yeah, I-- This is nothing. Shaving. He cleans his hand against his trousers. \nLESLEY I just want to say I'm sorry. \nRIGGAN For what? \nLESLEY I knew what Mike was capable of, and I brought him in, anyway. \nRIGGAN You did good. \nLesley nods. A beat. \nLESLEY Tomorrow's my first opening night on Broadway. \nRIGGAN Mine too. \nLESLEY And I want you to know that, whatever happens, I'll always be grateful to you for that. \nRIGGAN Me too. It's going to be great. Full house. \n(CONTINUED) \nShe looks at him with tender eyes. Then we follow her along the corridor until she passes by Mike's dressing room. Mike half-opens the door and sees Lesley walking by. He has a black eye. He waits for Lesley to be completely gone, and then he comes out of his dressing room and we follow him up the stairs to... \n38   EXT. ROOFTOP - THEATER - DUSK                                  38 ...the rooftop. He finds Sam standing on the cornice, looking at the street. \nMIKE For fuck's sake, just jump already. \nSam stares out, a smile creeping over her face. SAM How did you know I'd be up here? \nMIKE I didn't. I was just hoping. \nSilence. Mike walks up next to her and stares out as well. \nSAM Where's Lesley? \nMIKE Moving on. \nSAM Smart girl... \nMIKE I appreciate that. A beat. \nSAM Ready for the last preview? (Noticing his black eye.) Who did that to you? \nMike smiles. No answer. \nSAM (CONT'D) Could have been anybody, I guess. (After a beat.) I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley. He barely says no, smiling, and lights a cigarette. She understands. \n(CONTINUED) \nSAM (CONT'D) Oh, don't tell me... \nSilence. \nMIKE What's the worst thing he ever did to you? \nSam is surprised by the question. She thinks for a moment. SAM He was never around, so... \nMIKE That was--? \nSAM No. That was-- Who gives a shit. It was the way he tried to make up for it by constantly trying to convince me I was special. (A beat.) What about you? \nMIKE My dad? \nSAM Yeah. \nMIKE He pretended I was his son. \nShe stares him down. Silence. \nSAM So, what happens now? \nMIKE I have no idea... SAM Yeah... \nA beat. \n", "test2_id": 2164, "test3_input": "He smiles to her sadly, and then he wipes the mustard from his face with the piece of toilet paper. \nSAM Dad! \nRIGGAN What? (CONTINUED) \nSam looks at the ruined toilet paper in his hands. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Oh... Shit. I'm sorry. \nSAM (Smiling.) It's okay. You just destroyed the entire human race in one blow. \nRiggan looks at her with the saddest of expressions. SAM (CONT'D) Dad. (She hesitates.) Do you know you're becoming a trending topic? \nRIGGAN Really? What does that mean? \nSam searches for something on her iPhone and then hands it to Riggan. Riggan looks at the phone and sees a hand-held video of himself in the streets in his underwear. \nSAM 350,000 views in less than an hour. Believe it or not, this is power. \nRiggan looks at more footage, seemingly confused. After a moment, the phone vibrates and the video is interrupted by a text message, which reads \"Truth or Dare?\" \nRIGGAN It's for you. \nShe grabs the phone and looks at the screen. Then at her father. Riggan is staring at her. She looks down. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Go ahead... \nSAM (Hesitant.) Are you...? \nRIGGAN Go. \nA sympathetic smile. An understanding. Sam exits. \nRiggan stares into the mirror absently. His eyes locked on his reflection trying to find himself in the image. Then he spots a vase with dying roses, the same roses he flung to the ground previously. \n(CONTINUED) \nHe gets up and goes into the bathroom. He pulls off the long wig and the mustache. He washes his face. Then he opens a small bottle and uses the liquid to scrub his goatee. The dark dye begins to run out, leaving only white hair. For the first time we see that Riggan has a white beard. \nHe puts on new clothes and comes out of the bathroom. He grabs a beige raincoat and heads out of the dressing room and into... \n47   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            47 \n...the hallway. As he passes by Mike's door he can hear Sam and Mike. They're trying to be as quiet as possible, but we can hear them flirting and laughing. \nHe pauses for a moment but continues on. After a few seconds, his phone vibrates. He looks at it. A text from Jake reads: \"Have you seen this??? Awesome!!!\" He clicks the attachment and sees the, now infamous, video of his underwear escapade in the street. We zoom in until the image fills the screen, when we finally pull away, we discover that... \n48   INT. RUM HOUSE - LATER                                         48 ...Riggan's video is being played now in a television in the bar. We see the MTV logo on the bottom of the screen and a video caption that reads: \"Birdman goes viral, 930.000 views and counting\". The camera pans to find Riggan sitting at the bar, drunk. He is one of the few customers. He polishes off his drink. RIGGAN Let me have another one. \nBARTENDER You got it. \nThe bartender pours another whiskey for Riggan. A waiter steps up to the bar. The bartender points to a martini. \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) (To the waiter.) That's going over to Ms. Dickinson. \nRiggan's head tilts at the mention of the name. He looks over to see Tabitha sitting at a table, scratching in her notebook. \nRIGGAN (Hands the waiter a bill.) I got it. She's a friend of mine. \n(CONTINUED) \nThe waiter pockets the money and gives Riggan the drink. He walks it over to Tabitha and places it down in front of her. Not looking up, she pulls the drink closer and takes a sip. \nRiggan sits down across from her. She looks up and immediately recognizes him. He takes out the Carver cocktail napkin and pushes it in front of her. She looks at him, and then down to the napkin. She reads it in silence. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) (Re: The napkin.) That was twenty years before I put on that damned costume. \nA pause. Then she pushes the napkin back toward him. \nTABITHA I don't care. \nRIGGAN I'm just saying, when you come tomorrow night, I want you-- \nTABITHA It doesn't matter. \n", "test3_true": "TABITHA I'm going to destroy your play. \nRIGGAN You haven't even seen it. I don't-- Did I do something to offend you? \nTABITHA As a matter of fact you did. You took up space in a theater which otherwise might have been used on something worthwhile. RIGGAN But you don't even know if it's-- \nTABITHA That's true. I haven't read a word of it, or even seen a preview, but after the opening tomorrow I'm going to turn in the worst review anybody has ever read. And I'm going to close your play. Would you like to know why? Because I hate you. And everyone you represent. Entitled. Spoiled. Selfish. Children. Blissfully untrained, unversed and unprepared to even attempt real art. Handing each other awards for cartoons and (MORE) (CONTINUED) TABITHA (CONT'D) pornography. Measuring your worth in weekends. Well, this is the theater, and you don't get to come in here and pretend you can write, direct and act in your own propaganda piece without going through me first. So, break a leg. \nTabitha goes back to her writing. Riggan sits for a moment. \nRIGGAN What has to happen in someone's life, for them to end up becoming a critic? \nShe looks up at him. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Whatcha writin'? You reviewin' a play? Was it good? Bad? Did you even see it? Lemme read. \nHe snatches the notebook from her. TABITHA I will call the police. \nRIGGAN No you won't. Let's read your review! (He scans the notebook.) \"Callow\". A label. \"Lackluster\". Label. \"Marginalia\". Sounds like you need penicillin to clear that up. None the less... label. (Looks to Tabitha.) All labels. You're a lazy fucker aren't you? (Looks one last time at the notebook.) Epistemological vertigo? \nTabitha wants to reach for the notebook, but her pride won't let her. Riggan takes a flower from a vase at the center of the table. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) You know what this is? You don't, do you? You can't even see it if you don't label it. You mistake those sounds in your head for true knowledge. \nTABITHA Are you finished? \nRIGGAN (Wrinkling one of the pages.) Nothin' about intention, structure, (MORE) (CONTINUED) RIGGAN (CONT'D) technique. Just crappy opinions backed up by crappy comparisons. You're incapable of writing more than a couple of paragraphs, and you risk nothing of yourself. (He tears out the page and tosses the notebook.) Well, I'm an actor and this play has cost me everything. So you can take your cowardly, malicious, shittily written reviews and shove them up your... (Showing her the wrinkled page.) ...wrinkly, tight ass. \nRiggan wears a proud smile. And suddenly, Tabitha begins to smile with him. \nTABITHA You think you're an actor? (Calls to the waiter.) Eddie! Eddie the waiter approaches the table. \nWAITER Yeah, Mrs. Dickinson? \nTABITHA Give us some Shakespeare. \nWAITER No problem. Got anything in mind? \nTabitha looks over at Riggan picking the perfect verse. \nTABITHA The Scottish Play. Act five... \nWAITER Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools. The way to dusty death... \nHe is brilliant. The monologue is perfectly played and powerful. Riggan being mercilessly reminded of his mediocrity... by Eddie the waiter. \nWAITER (CONT'D) ...Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more. It is (MORE) (CONTINUED) WAITER (CONT'D) a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury... Signifying nothing. \nA few drunks clap at the beautiful performance. Then, a powerful silence rings out for a moment, until... \nTABITHA Thank you, Eddie. \nWAITER You got it. TABITHA (To Riggan. A derisive laugh.) You're no actor. You're a celebrity. Let's be clear on that. \nTabitha rises from her seat and grabs her things. \nTABITHA (CONT'D) I'm going to kill your play. She walks away. Riggan sits numb. After a moment, he reaches over and gulps down Tabitha's entire martini, gin pouring out the sides of his mouth. Unaware, he slams the empty martini glass on top of the Carver napkin and gets up. We follow him out onto... \n49    EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                    49 \n...the street, where he walks through the theater district. Tired. Drunk. Empty. Neon lights all around him. A crazy, old homeless man passes by in the opposite direction shouting furiously. Riggan keeps walking until he arrives at a bench, with a tree behind. Everything is quiet. Riggan sits on the bench, lost. We begin to tilt up, slowly, toward a tall tree. We move closer into the branches and the green leaves. Silence. \nA49                                                               A49 Night turns into day. The sounds of the city disappear and birds begin to sing. The branches now caressed by golden shafts of morning sun. Finally, we tilt down slowly and find... \n50    EXT. STREET - DAY.                                          50 \n...Riggan still sleeping on the bench. He looks like a bum. His raincoat is dirty and wet. \n(CONTINUED) \nBIRDMAN (V.O.) God. You look like shit, brother. You get that mongoloid look when you're hung over, don't you? \nRiggan opens an eye. He scratches his hair. \nBIRDMAN (V.O.) Let's go. Get up. It's a beautiful day. \n", "test3_id": 2165}

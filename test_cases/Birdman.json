Inarritu Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris, Jr. Armando Bo \n1    BLACK                                                        1 \nWe hear a clock ticking. \nFADE IN: \n1    INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY                  1 Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the center of what seems to be a makeshift \"meditation\" space. \nWe slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55). He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor. His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out. \nMAN (V.O.) How did we end up here? (Beat.) This place is a fucking dump. \nWe begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking. \nMAN (V.O.) Smells like balls. \nA slight twitch in Riggan's neck. \nMAN (V.O.) We don't belong in this shithole. \nA Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call. On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. She stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan through her iPhone. \n1A                                                                1A \nThe Korean Store owner (50) stands in the background screaming at her the whole time. \nRIGGAN Sam, I can't-- \n(CONTINUED) \nSAM Dad? What kind of-- (Turning to Korean.) SHUT UP!!! (Back to screen.) What kind of flowers did you say you wanted? \nRIGGAN Alchemillas. Or something soothing that smells nice. Listen I can't-- SAM It all smells like fucking Kimchi! \nRIGGAN Then whatever looks nice. Anything but roses. No roses. \nKOREAN Flowers don't need you touch! They need you buy!!! \nSAM (Close into the screen.) I hate this job. \nAnd the Skype call is over. Riggan closes the laptop and leans forward trying to regain his calm. His reflection appears in the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. He has a dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. There is a piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase \"A thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing.\" \nANNIE ON SPEAKERS Riggan, they're starting scene five. We need you on stage. \nRIGGAN Shit... Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He hurries out... \n2   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            2 \n...through the narrow corridors of the theater. There is a lot of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and disappear carrying equipment and scenery. As Riggan descends the stairs, a Stage Hand\u00b7 passes by in the opposite direction. \nSTAGE HAND\u00b7 Mr. Thomson. \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN Steve. \nSTAGE HAND\u00b7 It's Daniel. \nRIGGAN (Already passed.) Okay. \nRiggan continues on until he arrives backstage. He runs into Jake (42) his producer and friend. \nJAKE How's it going, buddy. \nRIGGAN Great. It'd be even better if I could get Ralph to stop acting like he's in an educational video for syphilis... The camera moves off of them and onto... \n3   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                              3 ...the stage. Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style kitchen. \nAround the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense, her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she is. Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every person she meets feel like she's seducing them. And Ralph (40), slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible. \nCREW MEMBER Grab his legs. I got the top. \nJAKE Don't move him! Wait for the ambulance. (Calling out.) For the love of God! I could get a black audience in this theater faster than a doctor! \nRiggan heads off the stage, and Jake chases after him. We follow them as... \n4   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           4 \n...they walk through the corridor. \nJAKE Where are you going? We'll have the understudy ready to rehearse in five-- (CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN Forget the understudy. We have to postpone the preview. \nJAKE What are you-- It's a full house. We would have to refund all the-- \nRIGGAN Then do it. A crew member\u00b7 passes in the opposite direction. \nCREW MEMBER\u00b7 How's Ralph? \nRIGGAN He'll be fine. \nJAKE Wait. Wait. Fuck. Wait. RIGGAN Listen to me. It was going to be a disaster. That guy's the worst actor I've ever seen. The blood coming out of his ear was the most honest thing he's done so far. \nJAKE He's not that bad. \nRiggan stops in his tracks and stares at Jake. \nJAKE (CONT'D) Okay, he's fucking horrible. But-- \nRiggan starts walking again. \nJAKE (CONT'D) You have the press in your dressing room in a few hours. How are we-- RIGGAN I'll make something up. \nTwo Technicians\u00b7 hurry up in the opposite direction. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Jake. This happened for a reason. It wasn't an accident. \nJAKE What do you mean? \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN I-- (A beat.) I made it happen. \nJAKE Oh. Okay. (Beat.) Are you drunk? \nRIGGAN Find me an actor. A good actor. Philip Seymour Hoffman... JAKE He's doing the third Hunger Games. \nRIGGAN Michael Fassbender? \nJAKE Doing the prequel to the X-Men prequel. They arrive at Riggan's dressing room. \nRIGGAN What's his name? Jeremy Renner... \nJAKE Who? \nRIGGAN The... the Hurt Locker guy. \nJAKE Yeah. He's an Avenger. \nRIGGAN (With disgust.) Fuck. They put him in a cape, too? (A beat.) Look, I don't care. Find me someone. Riggan enters... \n5   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS            5 \n...his dressing room and tries to shut the door. Jake, still in the corridor, stops it with his foot. \nJAKE (Sticking his head in.) Ralph'll sue us. He'll sue us. And he's got a case. \n(CONTINUED) \nRiggan releases the door. \nRIGGAN Then make him go away. \nJAKE How do you suggest I do that? \nMIKE You gonna stand there? \nSAM (Glancing at her cell.) This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so self-conscious. Larry searches for a few costume pieces. \nLARRY Okay. I'm gonna have to start from scratch, with less than twenty-four hours... Let's see if these-- \nHe turns to see a completely naked Mike. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Holy-- What is happening? Where are your underpants? \nMIKE At home, under the bed, I think. \nSam glances at Mike for a second, then returns to her phone. Larry begins to help Mike into some pants which, given the situation, is very awkward. \nLARRY Okay. Everything is too small. \nSAM Yeah, you're not kidding. \nLesley enters the room immediately coming face to face with a naked Mike. She doesn't notice Sam who is partially hidden by a clothes rack. She just goes about trying a costume shirt. LESLEY Oh, that's nice... (To Larry.) Forgive him, Larry. Mike's like my five year old son. Neither one of them has clean underwear... \nLARRY Or pubic hair, I imagine. (Folding the pants.) Okay, well, I can take out the suit but we're going to need some new pants and shirts. (MORE) (CONTINUED) LARRY (CONT'D) (Looking back.) And underwear... \nMike just stands there naked, staring at his penis in the mirror. \nLESLEY (To Larry.) This is too small. (To Mike.) What the hell are you doing? MIKE Waiting for Larry to finish. \nLARRY I'm finished. \nLarry disappears deeper into the costume room. \nMIKE Okay, well, then I'm just standing here with my balls out. \nLESLEY Get dressed. Riggan's daughter is hanging around, and I don't need her to walk in here and-- \nMIKE Leslie... \nLESLEY No, Mike. You haven't seen her. She's always hanging around, just-- I don't-- Watching everyone. It's creepy. It's-- \nMIKE Les... \nLESLEY I don't know if the drugs fried her brain or what, but I don't need her running to her father saying you showed her your junk. \nMIKE Okay, then we should probably get her out of here. \nLesley's expression goes blank. \nLESLEY Oh, God. Really? \n(CONTINUED) \nMIKE Hey, Sammy... \nSAM It's Sam. \nLESLEY Fuck. \nSam steps forward. LESLEY (CONT'D) (To Sam.) I didn't mean-- \nSAM (Totally relaxed.) It's cool. He's a handful, huh? \nThey both look back at Mike. LESLEY Almost. \nSam smiles at her and exits. Lesley wheels on Mike. \nLESLEY (CONT'D) Jesus... How is it you always manage to find a new way to humiliate me? \nMIKE To be fair, you make it really easy. \nLESLEY What the hell was she doing here? \nMIKE She brought me. \nLESLEY And stayed??? MIKE I know, right? She's a little-- \nLESLEY Look at me, Mike. This is Broadway. I'm here. Finally. And I'm begging you, if you love me, please, do me a favor... don't fuck it up. \nRiggan stops. Silent. A beat. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Is that good or bad? (He stares at her.) Riggan...? \nRIGGAN It's good. It's great. She smiles, her eyes filled with emotion. Riggan smiles back, and nods absently. \nLAURA Say something else... \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN (Joking.) You're pretty sure it's mine? \nLAURA (Unamused but plays along) Well, let's see. There's you. Jake. That masseuse wore a condom so... Yes, it's yours... idiot. \nShe puts her head on Riggan's chest. We see his mind racing. Laura is moved, and confused. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Are you excited? \nRIGGAN Yeah. \nLAURA Me too. Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across the face. Riggan looks at her, confused. \nRIGGAN What--? \nLAURA You're not funny. \nShe kisses him intensely on the lips and briefly places his hand on her belly, then moves it up to her breasts. After a moment, she backs away. \nLAURA (CONT'D) First preview tomorrow. Here we go! \nLaura turns and walks away. Riggan continues down the corridor. He passes by a Security Guard\u00b7 in front of a small TV. The camera becomes Riggan's POV and advances until... \n11   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - EVENING                             11 \n...we go through the stage door. We scan the backstage area to see the stagehands ready to do their jobs. We can feel the electricity of a first preview. \nOn stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible. Annie stands at her podium, calling the cues for the show. \nANNIE (Into her headset.) Cue 34 and 35. Go. (CONTINUED) \nShe turns and looks directly into the camera. \nANNIE (CONT'D) Places. \nRIGGAN (O.S.) Okay. \nRiggan walks on screen wearing his costume, carrying a bucket of ice and a bottle of gin. He goes to the opposite side of the stage and takes his place in the wings. He peeks out at the audience who seem to be watching with interest. \nThen we pan to the stage to find Mike, Lesley and Laura performing the scene we saw at the beginning, around the table. Mike looks comfortable, sipping at his drink. A half empty bottle of gin on the table. \nMIKE The maniac shot himself right in front of us. I rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital. \nLESLEY I'll never get that image out of my head. Right before he did it, his eyes-- they were so sad... lonely. \nLAURA Did you have to treat him? \nMIKE I didn't have to. But I did. (Pouring another drink.) He was in bad shape. His head swelled up to like twice the size of a normal head. I'd never seen anything like it. And I swear to God, I hope I never do again. \nRiggan stands near Annie. RIGGAN He's good. \nANNIE He's incredible. I think he's drinking real gin. \nRiggan looks out at Mike, who is refilling his glass. \nRIGGAN What? \n(CONTINUED) \nA stagehand gives Riggan a bottle. Riggan watches and waits for his cue. \nMIKE Ask Nick what real love is. He'll agree with me. You watch. \nLESLEY Why don't we just head to the restaurant? LAURA Don't get him started, Mel. You haven't seen how he's been lately. He's been depressed. I'm worried about him. He's been-- \nShe gently pushes Riggan and we follow him on stage... \nRiggan keeps walking up to... \n13   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          13 ...the hallway. Jake chases him. \nRIGGAN I want him gone. \nJAKE No. \nRIGGAN What? \nJAKE We can't do that. \nRIGGAN What are you-- Of course we can do that. It's our show. \n(CONTINUED) \nJAKE Riggan, listen to me-- \nRiggan comes to a halt and faces Jake. \nRIGGAN No. You listen to me. Get him the fuck out of my play. Did you see him out there? \nJAKE It was a preview! Nobody gives a shit about previews. Nothing matters until that old bat from the New York Times is sitting in that audience on opening night. \nRIGGAN We're getting rid of him. I'm not going to stand up on that stage and-- \nJAKE Shut up! Just shut up for once and listen to me. As soon as we announced he was taking over, the advance doubled. We can't afford to lose a preview. We can't afford to lose money. We can't afford to lose Mike. This is about being respected, validated, remember? That's what you told me. That's how you got me into this shit. Now, you're the director. Get him under control. (A beat. As a friend.) These are not the nineties anymore. \nJake storms away. Riggan heads toward his dressing room. Out of nowhere, Mike barrels into him, pinning him against a wall. \nRIGGAN (Startled.) Holy Fuck! \nMike presses up against Riggan, breathing down his neck. After a painful silence... \nMIKE (Like he's possessed.) You were good... \nRIGGAN Meet me in front of the theater in 10 minutes. \nMike chuckles and slaps Riggan gently on the face before he disappears into his dressing room. Riggan begins walking again. We follow him into... \n14   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             14 \n...his dressing room. He goes into the bathroom and quickly washes his face. \nSYLVIA (O.S.) What the hell was going on up there? \nWe pan over to see his ex-wife Sylvia (43), standing in one corner, staring at Riggan. She is elegant and simply beautiful. \nRIGGAN I didn't know you were here tonight. SYLVIA That guy's an asshole, huh? \nRiggan dries his hands with a towel and comes out of the bathroom. \nRIGGAN What are you doing here? SYLVIA Sam and I are going to grab a bite after she's finished with-- \nRIGGAN No, I mean here. Now. \nSYLVIA Well. I know how much this means to you, so-- \nRIGGAN I appreciate that. \nA beat. \nSYLVIA So, how's it going? \nRIGGAN The play? \nSYLVIA No, you and Sam. \nRIGGAN It's good. (A beat.) It's the same. \nSYLVIA Do you talk to her? \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN We talk. We-- I don't know, it's been crazy around here. \nRIGGAN I will. \nSYLVIA You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan. She exits. Painful silence... until... \nBIRDMAN (V.O.) We should have done that reality show they offered us. \"The Thomsons.\" That would've been good. Crazy, druggy, wise ass daughter. Milfy wife with the perky tits. People would have watched that. \nRIGGAN (To the poster.) Shut up. \nRiggan stands up and grabs his jacket. He opens the door and goes out to... \n15   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           15 ...the hallway. \nBIRDMAN (V.O.) Where are we goin'? \nRIGGAN (Almost whispering.) Leave me alone. \nRiggan walks between crew members. Annie interrupts him. \nANNIE The sun bed is here. \nRIGGAN What does that mean? \nANNIE It means there's a sun bed out there being delivered to in here. \nRIGGAN Who ordered a sun bed? \n(CONTINUED) \nANNIE Mike. He says it's for his character. Carver's red necks, \"people of the land\". Part of his process and that shit. \nRiggan cannot deal with this right now. He continues walking until he arrives at a metal door that takes him out to... \n16   EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS           16 \n...an alley way. Riggan walks toward the street. There is a man playing drums. Riggan finds Mike leaning against a parked car, dazed and looking up at the marquis... \nRIGGAN Let's go. Walk. \nRiggan begins to walk, Mike follows. \nMIKE Where are we going? RIGGAN To get you some coffee. Have I done anything to disrespect you? \nMIKE Not yet. \nRIGGAN I have a lot riding on this play. MIKE Is that right? \nRIGGAN People know who I am, and-- \nMIKE Bullshit. \nRIGGAN Mike-- \nMIKE Bullshit. People don't know you. They know the guy in the bird suit. They know the guy who tells those quaint, slightly vomitous stories on Letterman. \nRIGGAN Well, I'm sorry for being popular, but that-- (CONTINUED) \nMIKE (With irony.) Popular? POPULAR?... Oh God, popularity is just the slutty little cousin of prestige. \nRIGGAN Okay, I don't even know what that-- \nMIKE My reputation is riding on this play. And that's... That is... RIGGAN A lot? \nMIKE A lot. Exactly. Fuck you. Yes. This doesn't work out for you, you get to go home to your studio pals and jump right back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. \"There's a douchbag born every minute\". That was P.T. Barnum's premise when he got rich inventing the circus. And you and your pals know nothing's changed, and whatever toxic shit you make people are still gonna pay to see it. But, after you're gone, I'll still be here. I'll still be making my living on the stage. Baring my soul. Wrestling with emotions, complex emotions. \nRIGGAN Right. Is that what tonight was about then? (Mocking him.) Wrestling with \"complex emotions\"? \nMIKE Tonight was about making it alive. About making it bleed. This isn't the Warner Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and this is how we do things. \nMike turns and opens the front door of The Rum House. \nRIGGAN Where are you going? \nMIKE They have coffee in here. \nHe walks into the restaurant. Riggan backtracks and we follow him into... \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Why is that funny? \nMIKE He wrote it on a cocktail napkin. \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN So... \nMike slides the napkin back to Riggan. \nMIKE He was drunk. \nA17                                                                 A17 \nHe walks away and we follow him as he passes by the bar next to Tabitha Dickinson, the Critic. \nTABITHA You headed to Hollywood, Mike? \nMike stops. MIKE Hollywood's headed here, Tabby. \nTABITHA (A devilish smile.) Good luck with that. \nMike looks directly into her eyes. \nMIKE \"A man becomes a critic when he can not be an artist, in the same way that a man becomes an informer when he cannot be a soldier.\" Flaubert, right? \nHe flashes his own devilish smile. She stares back. If she weren't so much older than him, you'd swear there was sexual electricity between them. \nTABITHA He's a Hollywood clown in a Lycra bird suit. \nMIKE Yeah. And at 8 o'clock tomorrow, he's gonna get on stage and risk everything. What're you gonna be doing? \nA standoff. \nTABITHA Don't you ever worry that I'll give you a bad review? \n(CONTINUED) \nMIKE Oh, I'm sure you will. If I ever give a bad performance. (Beat.) Ms. Dickinson. \nTABITHA Mr. Shiner. \nMike smiles and waves over to an obviously nervous Riggan. He goes toward the exit, but we stay with Tabitha, scribbling on her notebook. Suddenly she raises her eyes and, with a dark expression, looks at Riggan who is passing by. \nWe follow Riggan toward the exit. Through the window we see him leave the restaurant. Then we pan to a wooden wall, and this wall takes us to... \n19   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - LATER                               19 \n...the theater hallway. Riggan walks through the quiet corridor, until he arrives at... \n20   INT. GREEN ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                       20 ...the Green Room. Sam sits listlessly, drawing some lines across a roll of toilet paper. \nRIGGAN What're you still doing here? \nSAM (Continues scribbling.) Nothing. I'm-- Nothing. Your costumes are hanging in your room. \nRIGGAN Great... \nSAM I got the coconut water you wanted. If you want me to get-- \nRIGGAN Hey. \nSAM What? \nRIGGAN I'm not sure if I said thank you. \n(CONTINUED) \nSAM For what? \nRIGGAN All of it. You've been doing a good job. And I've been... \nSAM Yeah. \nRIGGAN So, I just wanted to say that-- (He stops abruptly.) What is that? \nThree dancers on stage pass by in front of Laura. We follow the dancers backstage where we find Mike and Lesley wearing pajamas. LAURA (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...Not because I didn't love Nick. And not because I didn't love the-- The idea of it. But because I just wasn't ready to love myself. There's a certain distance to it all now. A wistful distance. Underscored by a gentle breeze and the sound of the birds... laughing at the whimsy of it all. \nA stage hand helps Mike and Lesley into a double bed. The camera slips under the covers with them and stays there. \nMIKE (Whispering.) Hey, Les... \nLESLEY (Whispering.) What? MIKE I'm hard. \nLESLEY No, you're not. It's just that sometimes you don't consider other people's feelings. \nMIKE No. I'm hard. Feel. \n(CONTINUED) \nLESLEY Oh, you gotta be kidding. \nThe stage begins to revolve as we hear... \n22   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            22 ...music through the transition. It remains dark. \nMIKE Let's really do this. Let's fuck. \nLESLEY Are you crazy? No. \nMike rolls on top of Lesley. \nLESLEY (CONT'D) Cut it out... \nMike continues to maneuver himself. \nLESLEY (CONT'D) I'm serious, Mike. Stop! \nMIKE I'm Mel. Not Mike. Mel. A knock on a door. \nRIGGAN (O.S.) Terri! Terri! \nA furious Lesley tries to reposition herself under Mike. \nRIGGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Terri! I know you're in there! \nThe knocking gets louder. \nRIGGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Terri??? \nMike, lost in his libido, has begun to have sex with Lesley. The camera comes out from under the covers and pans to Riggan who stumbles into what is now the Motel Room set. He wears a mustache and a long wig, that makes him look like a wild man. He holds a gun in his right hand. A neon \"Motel\" sign is illuminated. A clever effect of falling rain is visible behind the set, accompanied by the appropriate sound effect. Riggan is wet because of the \"rain\". \nLesley uses Riggan's entrance to escape from Mike. \n(CONTINUED) \nLESLEY Ed! \nMike hops out of bed, unaware of the very noticeable erection protruding underneath his pajama bottoms. \nSome laughter from the audience. \nLESLEY (CONT'D) What are you doing here? Lesley doesn't understand the audience response, until she notices the erection herself. \nRIGGAN (To Lesley.) Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you. I worshipped you... \nMIKE Listen Ed, I know this is hard but-- More laughter. Riggan is disturbed, but he continues... \nRIGGAN (to Mike) Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you. \nHe shoves Mike violently to the floor. \nLESLEY Eddie! Please! \nRiggan points the gun at Mike's head. \nRIGGAN What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me? \nLESLEY Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun. She begins to cry. Her performance is beautiful. \nLESLEY (CONT'D) Just look at me. I was drowning. I was not capable of-- You deserve to be loved. You do. \nLAURA You're an actress, honey. \nLesley begins to cry. Laura hugs her. LESLEY I'm pathetic. You know, I've dreamt of being a Broadway actress since I was a little kid. And now I'm here. And I'm not a Broadway actress. I'm still just a little kid. And I keep waiting for someone to tell me I made it. \nLAURA (Hiding how moved she is.) Hey. You made it. \n(CONTINUED) \nLESLEY I did? \nLAURA Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner, on a fake motel bed, in front of-- \nLESLEY (A little laugh.) Shut. Up. Riggan steps into the doorway and sees Laura hugging Lesley. \nRIGGAN Is she okay? \nLAURA She's gonna be fine. \nRiggan enters gingerly and walks up to Lesley. RIGGAN None of this is your fault. (Into her eyes.) You're beautiful. And talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay? \nLESLEY Okay. \nRIGGAN Okay. \nRiggan leaves the room. Laura leans on the makeup table. \nLESLEY That was very sweet. \nLAURA Yeah. Laura is suddenly teary. \nLESLEY What's wrong? \nA beat. \nLAURA (Smiling.) Nothing. Two years, he's never said anything like that to me. \n(CONTINUED) \nLESLEY (Into her eyes.) Hey. You're smart. And beautiful. And talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay? \nLAURA We're gross. \nLESLEY We are. Laura smiles and caresses Lesley's hand. They look at each other. Then Laura leans forward, close to Lesley's face... \nLESLEY (CONT'D) (Nervous.) What are you doing? \nLAURA Nothing. Laura kisses Lesley tenderly on the lips. Lesley seems confused. A few seconds of silence. Then... \nLESLEY Do it again. \nLaura kisses her again. A knock at the door. They separate. Mike opens the door holding the prop gun. \nMIKE (To Lesley.) Can we talk about this like two-- \nLesley hurls the hair brush at his head. \nLESLEY FUCK YOU!!! \nMIKE Okay, well, you're not ready. Mike points the prop gun at her, pretends to fire and... \nMIKE (CONT'D) That was hot. \nHe exits the room. We follow him... \n27   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          27 ...down the hallway up to Riggan's dressing room. Riggan sits at his table, picking the brains out of his hair. \n(CONTINUED) \nMIKE (Holding the gun.) Your gun is ridiculous. It looks like a plastic toy. And it still has the red plug in the barrel. (Shows the plug.) You look like a seven year old when you're holding it. I'm not threatened by it at all. \nHe tosses the gun onto Riggan's table. MIKE (CONT'D) Have some self respect and get a new one. (Takes a step then turns.) That was a fun crowd, huh? \nWe follow Mike to... \n28   INT. STAIRS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          28 ...the stairs. He climbs them as he lights a cigarette. He goes through a metal door that takes him out onto... \nMIKE (Looking at the street.) There's a bald guy about to walk by down there. Spit on his head. \nSAM No! \nMIKE You said dare. \nSAM Truth. \nMIKE Too late. \nShe stares into Mike's eyes, knowing she's being tested. She leans over the railing and spits down toward the street. SAM Happy? \nMAN (O.C.) (From the street) Fuck you! \nSam laughs. Mike smiles at her carefree laugh. It could be the first time we've seen a genuine smile from him. \nSAM Truth or dare? \nMIKE Truth. \nSAM You're boring. MIKE Truth. \nShe stares him down. \nSAM (Nervous, pretending.) Do you want to fool around with me? \nA pause. \nMIKE No. \n(CONTINUED) \nSAM (Taken aback.) Really? Why not? \nMIKE That's a second question. \nSAM It's a second part. \nA pause. MIKE I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up. \nImpressed with his honesty. \nSAM That didn't seem to be a problem for you on stage. MIKE Nothing's a problem for me on stage. \nSAM I wanna ask another question... \nMIKE You just asked-- \nSAM One more. \nMIKE Go 'head. \nSAM If you weren't afraid. What would you want to do to me? \nHe carefully considers it, then moves his face close to hers. MIKE I would want to pull the eyes out of your head... \nSAM ...That's sweet... \nMIKE ...And stick them in my skull, and then look out at this street and see it the way I saw it when I was your age. \n(CONTINUED) \nMike turns and stares out at the street once more. Sam stares at the mystery that is Mike. \nSAM G'night, Mike. \nShe walks away and into the building, never looking back. \nA29                                                                A29 \nMike stares out into the night. We move to his POV. The street. Night turns to day. Pedestrians begin to walk below. \nB29                                                                B29 \nWe crawl down the wall until we arrive at Riggan's dressing room window. We push in to find... \n(CONTINUED) \nMIKE What the fuck is going on! \nRIGGAN Get up! \nMIKE Back away. \nRIGGAN Get up. Riggan slaps Mike on the arm. \nMIKE Ow, fuck that hurts! \nRIGGAN So, Carver is the reason you became an actor? MIKE What? \nRIGGAN This is my play! I did the work. I raised the money. I arrange the press. \nMIKE They called me for an interview. I said-- I don't know, I said the first thing that came to mind. Jesus, we got the cover of the Arts section! \nRIGGAN You said the first-- Fuck the Arts section. The first thing that came to mind? Right. Cause that's you. Mr. Natural. Mr. Fuck the scene, just stare at my massive hard-on. Because that's the truth of the moment. MIKE You think it looked massive? \nRIGGAN Shut up. Shut the fuck up. You don't get hard on my stage unless I tell you to. \nMIKE Your stage? This stage belonged to a lot of great actor's, pal. But you are not one of them. \nMike storms out of the room. Riggan follows him into... \n33   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          33 \n...the hallway. He slaps Mike on his sun burned back. \nRIGGAN So, you wrote your own lines? \nHe slaps him again. \nMIKE Ow. Fuck. Yes I did. \nRIGGAN You changed a few words, and mumbled a little, you self absorbed prick. \nMIKE Look who's talking... \nRIGGAN Let me tell you something, you spiteful nobody piece of shit. MIKE Nobody? My hard-on has already fifty thousand views on youtube. \nRIGGAN Fifty thousand views? A cat playing with a dildo has more than that. \nMIKE I don't care. \nRIGGAN Yes you do. (Beat.) Everybody says: \"Mike is so honest\". (Smacks him.) \"So truthful\". (Smacks him again.) \nMIKE (Like a child.) Ouch. Fuuuuuck. Cut the shit! Riggan corners Mike against the wall. \nRIGGAN You said in the interview that your father was a drunk, like Carver. Is that true Mike? Is it really true? \nRiggan stares intensely into Mike's eyes. Mike looks away. \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Because my father was. My father was a mean fucking drunk. Beat the shit out of us. But we were okay with the beatings. You know why? Because at least when he was beating us, he wasn't thinking about taking us out to his tool shed... \nMike's expression changes. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) That sonofabitch would smile and say, \"Do you want to kneel down and unbuckle my belt? Or do you want me to take it off and use it?\" I learned how to make myself numb. But my sister-- (Holding back tears.) My little sister... \nRiggan can't go on. Mike is horrified. \nMIKE Jesus, Riggan. I'm really sorry. I didn't-- That's fucking horrible... \nRIGGAN (Crazy smile.) Yeah. It's also not true. See? (Cracking up.) I can pretend too, you little dick! \nRiggan shoves Mike violently. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Don't fuck with me, Mike. \nMIKE You're crazy... \nRIGGAN You have no idea what I'm capable of. You understand me? Riggan pulls the paper out of his back pocket. \nBIRDMAN (V.O.) It's always 'we' brother. \nThe television turns on by itself, playing an episode of the original Birdman cartoon. Riggan points his fingers at the tv and sends it hurling at the shadow. Then he proceeds to destroy everything in his room with his telekinetic powers. \nWe slowly pan to see that, behind Riggan, Jake stands on the other side of the half-opened door. We push in on Jake, watching in shock. The camera turns and becomes Jake's POV... \n35   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          35 \n...and now, from his view, we see Riggan yelling at the shadow. \nRIGGAN Fuck you! Fuck you! \nHe picks up a chair and throws it down. He then picks up the newspaper from the floor and tossing it all around. And now we understand that he is not using telepathy. He has been using only his hands. Completely mad. As Riggan turns to pick up something else, he spots Jake on the other side of the door. He immediately calms himself and walks over. (CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) What's up? \nJAKE Um... Well. Two hours to curtain. Why don't you rest a little bit? \nRIGGAN Yeah. Sure. \nJAKE Last preview, buddy. We're almost there. \nRIGGAN Okay. \nJAKE How ya doin? \nRIGGAN Good. Great. JAKE Good. That's good. (A beat.) The, uh, money came through. I just have to transfer it to the account. \nRIGGAN Oh, that's terrific... \nJAKE Okay. Well, I'm gonna do that. (He stares at Riggan who seems about to collapse.) You know I'm proud of you, right? This took balls. And you did it. \nRiggan nods. An exhausted sadness in his eyes. \nRIGGAN I can't do this anymore, Jake. \nJAKE What? \nRIGGAN I think I'm gonna cancel the preview. I'm exhausted. \nJAKE It's a joke, right? (He forces a laugh.) Good one, Riggan. \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN I'm starting to believe that this is not for me. The applause is... lukewarm. I think they're laughing at me. \nJAKE What are you--? Listen. There's a three block line of people waiting to see you. We are sold out. It's a full house. \nRIGGAN Really? \nJAKE Yes. And the French embassador is coming. And the prince of Saudi Arabia, with one of his wives. And... I wasn't going to tell you this, but-- Martin Scorsese. He's casting for his new film. But don't tell anyone, okay? This is between you and me. RIGGAN Okay. I'll be ready. \nRiggan smiles. He has forgotten about his existential doubts. A worried Jake closes the door. He walks a few steps and finds Laura and Lesley. They've been listening to his conversation with Riggan. \nLESLEY How is he? \nJAKE He'll be okay. \nLESLEY Poor creature. \nLAURA Is it true? Scorsese? JAKE Yes. And the new Pope too. (Beat.) \nThey both understand. \nLAURA You're an asshole, Jake. \nJAKE I'm the one keeping this boat afloat. \n(CONTINUED) \nLESLEY So there is no line of people out there? \nJAKE I don't know. Now go and get ready. That's your job. (He begins to walk.) I'll better invest in a taco truck, or a strip joint near the airport. \nLaura leaves. We follow Lesley up to Riggan's dressing room. She knocks on the door. Nothing. Silence. She half-opens the door and, from behind her, we see Riggan examining his right hand. He has blood falling from the palm to the wrist. \nMIKE He was right, though. \nSAM About what? \nMIKE About your being special. You're hanging around here trying to make yourself (MORE) (CONTINUED) MIKE (CONT'D) invisible behind that fragile little fuck up routine. But you can't. You're anything but invisible. You're big. And you're sort of this really great mess, a candle burning at both ends, and no amount of booze or pills is gonna hide that. \nSam tosses Mike's cigarette over the balcony, and kisses him. He leans into the kiss. MAN'S VOICE (From below.) Jesus Fuck! \nShe suddenly pulls away. \nSAM It's a good thing you're an actor and not a writer cause that little speech was just like, Oprah... Hallmark... R. Kelly bad. She kisses him lightly one more time and then walks away. When she gets to the door she stops and leans on the frame. \nSAM (CONT'D) Truth or dare? \nMIKE Truth. \nSAM No. \nMIKE Truth. \nSAM No. Truth or dare? \nThe slightest smile as she exits through the door, and after a short pause, Mike follows... \n39   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS                         39 \n...along a darkened hallway. They reach a tiny wooden door and Sam leads the way through it. \nMIKE Do you have any idea where you're going? \nSAM Absolutely not. \n(CONTINUED) \nShe continues on until she gets to... \n40   INT. ABOVE STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                      40 \n...the \"grid\" above stage where the lights are located. We can see, below us, the empty seats of the auditorium and the kitchen set. \nMIKE What now...? \nMike reaches up to kiss her. She stops him. \nSAM How do you do it? MIKE What? \nSAM How do you go out there and pretend to be someone else in front of all those people? \nMIKE I don't pretend. Not out there. Just about every place else, but never out there. \nSAM Good to know. \nThey stare at one another... \nMIKE What are we doing here? \nSAM What do you mean? \nMIKE I mean, what are we doing here? \nShe moves in. \nSAM Adrenaline... They kiss. The camera begins to drift down toward the stage... \nRIGGAN (O.S.) Fucking teenager. \nAs the camera continues down from the grid, we discover an auditorium full of people staring at the actors on stage. \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN (O.S) (CONT'D) By the time I got to the hospital, the kid was dead. He was off in a corner laid out on a gurney. We took the old couple up to the O.R.. They were a mess. We worked like hell on them for most of the night... \nWe pan along the auditorium back to the stage to find Riggan, Mike, Lesley and Laura in the kitchen. RIGGAN (CONT'D) When we were done, we wrapped them in full body casts. The husband was depressed. Even when I told him his wife was gonna pull through, he was still depressed. So, I got up to his mouth hole and asked him, and he told me it was because he couldn't see her through the eye holes. Can you imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart was breaking because he couldn't turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife. \nLESLEY (In genuine tears.) That's terrible. (Beat.) Perfect. And terrible. \nSeeing no other way out, Riggan signs the autograph. \nTOURIST Dude! You fuckin' rock! \nDirectly in front of him stand a lady and her two kids. \nLADY Can we take one picture? \nRIGGAN Are you kidding me? \nKID #1 Why is he naked? LADY One picture... \nKID #2 I can see his weenie. \n(CONTINUED) \nRiggan tries to get past them, but a crowd has formed. A swarm of cell phones begin to glow like fireflies. \nLADY (To her kids.) Get next to him! \nRIGGAN Give me a fucking break, lady. \nThe kids run up next to him. Even more people crowding around. Riggan puts up his middle finger, just as the Lady takes the shot. He shoves the kids aside and moves on. \nWOMAN ON STREET He looks so old in person. \nMAN ON STREET (From across the street.) You suck! RIGGAN Fuck you! \nRiggan pushes through the crowd to get to the lobby. The people begin to chant. Dozens of cell phones recording him. \nCROWD Bird-man! Bird-man! Bird-man! \nRiggan pushes his way through to the lobby doors... \n43   INT. LOBBY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                             43 \n...to be stopped by the vision of Ralph in a wheelchair. His head wrapped in a bandage. A man in a suit next to him. \nRIGGAN Jesus Christ! What're you doing here? \nRALPH Waiting for Jake. This is Mr. Roth, my attorney. \nRiggan continues walking toward the auditorium. Ralph and Mr. Roth follow him. \nMR. ROTH We're pursuing financial remuneration for the injuries Mr. Pinkus suffered while rehearsing your-- \nRIGGAN I have a play to do. (CONTINUED) \nRALPH I'm going to ruin you! \nRiggan storms toward the auditorium, but is stopped by an old Usher. \nOLD USHER I'm sorry sir, you're going to have-- \nRiggan shoves the old lady aside and enters... \n44   INT. AUDITORIUM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                       44 \n...the theater. Riggan stands in the back among the audience. He sees the \"rain\" falling on the stage. The \"Motel\" sign is lit. Mike and Lesley are in bed, for the motel scene, waiting for the knock on the door. With nothing else to do, Riggan yells his line from the back of the auditorium... \nRIGGAN Knock knock knock! Terri! Terri! \nThe audience turns to see Riggan standing in his underwear. They begin to murmur and laugh and point at him. Riggan marches down the aisle. He looks haggard and covered with perspiration. \nLesley and Mike, confused, come out of bed. \nLESLEY Ed! What are you doing here? \nRIGGAN Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you-- I worshipped you... \nMIKE Listen Ed, I know this is hard but-- \nRIGGAN Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you. \nGiggles from the audience. Riggan turns threateningly and points to an audience member on the aisle who is giggling at him. \nRiggan sits up slowly. He is really hung over. BIRDMAN (V.O.) Stand up! Forget about the times. Everyone else has. So you're not a great actor... Who cares?!! You're much more than that. Fuck! You tower over all these theater douchebags. You're a movie star! A Global force! Don't you get it? \nRiggan stands up and begins to stumble forward. We pan around to find Birdman (a stronger Riggan wearing a cool Birdman outfit), following behind him. \nBIRDMAN You spent your whole life building a reputation and a bank account, and now they're both blown. So what? Fuck it. We make a come back. Something huge. Take what belongs to us. Take back the spotlight. Magazine covers and billboards. Happy meals with Birdman dolls. Remember that? That's who you are. That's who we are! \nRiggan just marches on. People and cars pass by, but nobody notices Birdman. Riggan tries to ignore him. \nBIRDMAN (CONT'D) C'mon, buddy. Tell me we're going back to the big leagues. Let's do this. Shave off that pathetic goatee, and put the mask back on! Batman my balls. We'll start a new franchise. Birdman: Phoenix Rising. Trust me! A billion world wide. Swear to God. \nA50                                                                 A50 \nRiggan keeps walking. Birdman, insistent, chases, until suddenly he begins to flutter off the ground. \nBIRDMAN Do you hear me? You can do anything! You're an icon! (CONTINUED) \nDesperate, Birdman flies a bit higher around him. \nBIRDMAN (CONT'D) You're bigger than life. You save people from their boring, miserable lives... \nThe camera pans to the street in front of them. People carry out their everyday routines. There is a deli, a souvenir shop, a small bank... \nBIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...You make them jump, laugh, cry, shit their pants... All you have to do is snap your fingers and... \nB50                                                                 B50 Riggan snaps his fingers, once, twice, and the bank suddenly explodes. The sound is so loud that it seems to belong to another movie. The earth shakes. People run. Dust all over. Fire. An unsteady camera pans back to Birdman. \nBIRDMAN (Excited.) That's what I'm talking about! That is cool! Explosive! Big, fast, loud! (He turns directly to the camera and talks about the audience.) Look at them. They love that shit! They starve for blood and action, not this artsy-fartsy-philosophical bullshit! \nC50                                                                 C50 We hear a loud roar, and the camera pans to discover a huge alien about to crash a cab against the asphalt. Birdman uses his powerful blow to send the alien flying away. \nBIRDMAN And when you shout \"whooaa!\"... (Riggan shouts \"Whooaa!\") ...it explodes in the eardrum of millions. Your power is unlimited. \nRiggan slows down his pace, as he starts to listen. \nBIRDMAN (CONT'D) You glimmered on 3000 screens, over 5 continents, in 47 countries at the same time. You are ubiquitous. You're a God! You can do it again. You can soar above all of them. \nD50                                                               D50 \nRiggan suddenly begins to levitate. \nBIRDMAN There you go, you mother fucker! See? Gravity doesn't even apply to you. \nThe camera flies up with Riggan as he floats above the street. There is something magical in his ascension, gently impelled by the breeze. A beautiful backlight makes his body glow. Birdman flutters around him. BIRDMAN (CONT'D) Listen to me. We gotta go back! We have to do this. We have to end it on our terms. With a grand gesture. \nA strange light suddenly palpitates in Riggan's eyes. Something makes sense in what Birdman is telling him. \nThe camera becomes Riggan's POV. He looks down to see the people on the street, watching him in awe. BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) We'll go back. We'll show them how much they're going to miss us. Flames. Icarus. Sacrifice... \nWe tilt up again to Riggan's face. He has a plan. \nBIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Let's go back one more time and show them what we're capable of. You can do it. You're Birdman. Do you hear me? You're... \nA GUY'S VOICE (O.S.) Birdman! \nE50                                                               E50 \nAnd as the camera pulls away, we discover Birdman is gone and Riggan is standing on the ledge of a tall building. The camera tilts down and we see that more people have gathered around, and more cars has stopped, and they all point at Riggan, worried about the situation. \nA guy wearing shorts, a Bob Marley t-shirt and a robe opens his window, one floor below Riggan, and looks up at him. \nGUY Dude, what are you doing? \nRiggan looks down at the people on the street far below. (CONTINUED) \nGUY (CONT'D) You okay, buddy? Do you want me to call someone? \nWe pan to a lady on her balcony filming Riggan with her phone. \nLADY Is this for real, or you're shooting a film? \nRIGGAN A film. \nThe lady looks around but sees nothing. \nLADY Oh, you people are full of shit. \nSYLVIA (CONT'D) Are you okay? You seem-- I don't know, you seem abnormally calm. \nRIGGAN I am calm. I'm great. I spent most of the day observing how beautifully this pile of dirty clothes was lit by the warm afternoon sun. (A tiny smile.) So beautiful. Sylvia, teasing him, closes her eyes and imitates Riggan's meditation posture. \nSYLVIA (Mocking him.) Oh yes. God is those purplish light dots I see between my eyes and my eyelids. \nRIGGAN You know? I have this voice that talks to me and tells me the truth. It's comforting, and scary. \nA beat. \nSYLVIA I'm going to pretend I didn't hear you say that. \nRIGGAN Okay. \nSYLVIA (Changing the subject.) You wouldn't believe the crowd outside. They said, some people paid up to 500 dollars a ticket. \nHe sits down. RIGGAN You wanna hear something funny? \nSYLVIA Sure. \nRIGGAN Do you remember our last anniversary party? \nSYLVIA Seriously? You're going to ruin a nice moment with that? \n(CONTINUED) \nRIGGAN Do you remember the party? \nSYLVIA The party where you fucked Janet Rossbach in our bed? Yeah, it rings a bell. \nRIGGAN Yeah, well. Let's skip over that part for a minute. SYLVIA Gladly. \nRIGGAN After you threw the guests out of the house, and the furniture out of the window. You locked yourself in the bathroom. \nSYLVIA I remember. Why are we-- \nRIGGAN I drove down to Malibu. I sat on the beach for a while. Just... staring out at the ocean. \nSYLVIA Riggan... \nRIGGAN Until I walked straight into the water and tried to drown myself. \nSilence. Sylvia stares at Riggan, surprised. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) I was in up to my chest when I felt the first one. On my back, like somebody was holding a frying pan against me. And then my chest, and my legs. The water was full of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the water, and I started rolling around the sand like a maniac... crying. \nSylvia doesn't know how to react. \nSYLVIA You said it was a sunburn. \nRIGGAN (Smiling.) And you believed me. \n(CONTINUED) \nSYLVIA To be honest, I didn't give a shit. \nRIGGAN I love you. And I love Sam. \nSYLVIA I know. \nSilence. They stare at each other. RIGGAN I never should have video taped Sam's birth. First of all because you and Sam both look like shit in that video. But mostly because I missed the moment. I should have just been there with the two of you. Present in my own life. So I'd have it. But, I don't. I don't have any of it. SYLVIA You have Sam. \nRIGGAN No, I don't. \nSYLVIA Listen, she's just-- \nRIGGAN No, I understand. She needed a father and she got one shamefully successful youtube video. Pretty pathetic. \nSYLVIA (Putting a finger on Riggan's lips.) Shhh... There are more pathetic things than that. That mustache, for example. She kisses him. \nANNIE ON SPEAKERS Places for act two. Places. \nSYLVIA Riggan... \nRIGGAN You should get back to your seat. You don't want to miss what's next. \nThe audience, one by one, jump to their feet, applauding wildly. The sole exception is Tabitha, who remains seated, a dazed expression on her face. We stay with the audience a few seconds longer. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nThe sounds slowly vanish. After a moment of silence... BIRDMAN (V.O.) You won't be hearing from him anymore. \nMAN (V.O.) Is he...? \nBIRDMAN (V.O) He's gone. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAWN \nOne of the old Birdman films is playing on a small television screen that hangs on a corner. The scene ends and a Morning Show host appears. Behind him a picture of Riggan and a caption that reads: \"Nation in shock.\" A shot of a candle vigil in Central park. \nHOST What do we talk about when we talk about Riggan Thomson? When we come back, more on the actor who two nights ago shot himself during the opening performance of his new Broadway play... \nWe pan away from the TV to see that the waiting room is filled with newsmen waiting for something to happen. There is almost no room to breath. \nWe pan to see Jake emerging from an elevator, carrying a newspaper under his arm. He walks through the dense mass of newsmen with a serious expression on his face. We follow him into... \nINT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS \n...a room. Jake peers in. Riggan lies on a bed, the bandages on his nose cover most of his face. Sylvia is looking out the window. \nJAKE Is he...? \nSYLVIA He's awake. \nJake enters the room. \nJAKE (Serious.) I thought I lost you, buddy. Thank god you're a horrible shot! What the hell happened? I was watching you up on that stage, and all of a sudden you get that goofy look in your eye, and you were just like-- \nHe starts to laugh. \nSYLVIA What the hell are you laughing about? He tried to-- What is wrong with you? (CONTINUED) \nJAKE I'm happy, okay? He's alive. My best friend is alive. And he is the man of the hour! \nJake holds the New York Times up in the air. \nRIGGAN What is that? \nJAKE You did it. \nSYLVIA (Coming to them.) You have to be shitting me... She wrote a review? \nJake unfolds the newspaper and we see the headline of the review: \"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\". JAKE (To Sylvia.) Read it. \nHe hands her the newspaper. She begins to read to herself. \nSYLVIA I don't believe this... \nJAKE Read it out loud! \nSAM \"Thompson has unwittingly given birth to a new form that can only be described as supra-realism. Blood was spilled both literally and metaphorically by artist and audience alike. Red blood. The blood that has been sorely missing from the veins of the American theatre...\" (Beat. To a smiling Jake.) You're happy about this? \nShe hands it to Riggan. \nJAKE Happy? I'm fucking euphoric. This is the-- This is the kind of review that turns someone into a living legend. \n(CONTINUED) \nSYLVIA He tried to-- He shot the nose off his face! \nJAKE He's got a new nose! And if he doesn't like that one, we'll get him another one. We can use Meg Ryan's guy. Who gives a shit? Turn on the tv. There are people praying for him all over the country. They're lighting candles in Central Park. He did it. (To Riggan) You did it! The play's gonna run forever. It's gonna open in London, in Paris... The studios will call us again. We'll get book offers. \nSYLVIA How do you know all that? You can see the future? JAKE (Euphoric.) Yes. \nShe slaps him in the face. \nSYLVIA Did you see that coming? You're so full of shit, Jake. \nJake needs a few seconds to recover. Then he looks at Riggan who just sits there, in silence. \nJAKE Why aren't you saying anything? This is what you wanted wasn't it? (Riggan gazes at the review.) Riggan, this is what you wanted. RIGGAN It's what I wanted. \n", "test1_input": "CLARA Hang on. Who's this Barthes guy? Which Birdman was he in? \nGABRIEL Roland Barthes was a French philosopher, who-- CLARA Oh. Okay. Sure. Now, is it true you've been injecting yourself with semen from baby pigs? \nRIGGAN What? \nCLARA As a method of facial rejuvenation. \nRIGGAN Who told you that? \nCLARA It was tweeted by... (checks her notes) @prostatewhispers. \nRIGGAN It's a lie. \nCLARA I know. But did you do it? \nRIGGAN No! \nGABRIEL Are you afraid at all that people will say you're doing this play to battle the impression that you're a washed-up super hero? \nRIGGAN No. I'm not. And that's exactly why 20 years ago I refused to do Birdman 4. \nHAN Birdman 4??? You do Birdman 4??? \nJake opens the door and the camera pans to him. \n(CONTINUED) \nJAKE Okay. That's enough for today. Thank you for coming. We're expecting some great pieces from you... \nRiggan stares at the Birdman poster. \nJAKE (CONT'D) Publicity guys are trying to get you a Times feature. Riggan stands up and pulls the Birdman poster off of the wall. \nJAKE (CONT'D) So, How'd it-- Whoa. If I were you I wouldn't do that. \nRIGGAN I don't want to look at it anymore. JAKE That was a present from the crew. Don't fuck with those guys, they're union. \nRIGGAN I don't care. \nRiggan leaves the poster on the floor, facing the wall, and walks to the window. He opens it. We can hear distant drums coming from the street. \nJAKE So... How'd it go? \nRIGGAN Great. \nJAKE (Worried.) Did they ask about Ralph? \nRIGGAN Nope. \nJAKE Good. He did it, you know? The motherfucker threatened to sue us. Didn't even wait to get out of the hospital. \nRIGGAN And, what did you say? (CONTINUED) \nJAKE What'd I say? I said, \"You motherfucker. You're threatening me? ME? I swear to god, you fuck, I so much as get a letter from a lawyer, the press'll get the pictures we got off your computer.\" \nRIGGAN What pictures? JAKE The guy has a thing for nuns... in diapers. What do you care? You shouldn't have any knowledge about it anyway. The important thing is that I made him go away. \nRIGGAN Right. That's great. JAKE Yeah, it's fantastic. One problem. We don't have an actor. And if we cancel the first preview the press will smell the blood. We can't afford to lose any more money. At all. \nRIGGAN What do you want me to do? \nJAKE We pay an understudy, let's use the understudy. \nRIGGAN No. \nJAKE No? Riggan, listen to me. Our dream actor is not going to knock on that door and say: \"Hey fellas, when do we start?\" \nB5                                                                  B5 \nThere is a knock at the door. Leslie peeks in. \nLESLIE Can I talk to you for a second? \nRIGGAN Yeah. What's up? \n", "test1_true": "LESLIE Did you find another actor? \nRIGGAN No. \nLESLIE Okay. Well... Mike's available. \nRIGGAN He is? JAKE Mike who? \nRIGGAN I thought he was doing-- \nLESLIE He was. He quit. Or got fired. JAKE Mike who? \nRIGGAN Which one? Quit or fired? \nLESLIE With Mike it's usually both. \nJAKE Mike Fucking Who? \nLESLIE Shiner. \nJAKE Yes! \nRIGGAN Jake... JAKE Yes! How do you know Mike Shiner? \nLESLIE We share a vagina. \nRIGGAN You think he'd want to do it? \nLESLIE Yeah. \n(CONTINUED) \nJAKE How do you know? \nLESLIE Because he said he'd want to do it. \nJAKE Yes! \nRIGGAN Jake. Hang on a minute. JAKE (to Riggan) Ask me if he sells tickets. \nRIGGAN Does he sell tickets? \nJAKE A shitload of tickets. Now ask me if the critics like him? \nRIGGAN Do they like him? \nJAKE They want to spooge on him. \nRIGGAN (Indicating Lesley.) Hey. \nJAKE Leslie... \nLESLIE Right on his face. \nJAKE Everything for a reason, right? RIGGAN You think he'll be able to come tonight? \nLESLEY I can call him and find out. \nRiggan gives Jake a look. \nJAKE I'll call his agent. \nJake charges out of the room. The camera follows him into... \n6   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                         6 \n...the hallway and as Jake makes a left turn, Annie enters from the right. \nJAKE Annie, turn the work lights on and get me a fresh copy of the script. We're gonna have a \"put in\" tonight. \nANNIE Who? JAKE You'll find out... \nJake disappears down the hall and we follow Annie through the theater and onto... \n7   INT. STAGE - THEATER - EVENING                              7 ...the stage, where she turns some of the stage work lights on. We pan along the stage until we find Riggan, wearing the same clothes as before, scanning the empty auditorium. \n", "test2_input": "MIKE (O.S.) Intimidating. Isn't it? \nRiggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes. \nMIKE (CONT'D) Do you have any idea who walked these boards before you? (Beat.) Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando, Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... And now you. Riggan Thomson. \nRiggan, trying to hide the intimidation. \nRIGGAN Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike. I appreciate it. \nMIKE Hey. This is what we do. (Indicates a script.) So, you wrote this adaptation? \nRIGGAN I did. \n(CONTINUED) \nMIKE And you're directing the adaptation and starring... \nRIGGAN I am. \nMIKE Ambitious. \nRIGGAN Thank you. \nA sly smile from Mike. He leaps onto the stage. \nMIKE Why don't we do a bit of it? \nRIGGAN Hey, I wasn't expecting you to-- MIKE First preview is tomorrow, right? \nRIGGAN Yeah, but you can go on with the script until you feel comfortable-- \nMIKE Let's just do some of it. \nRiggan tries to hide his excitement. He grabs the script from a nearby table and walks it over to Mike. \nRIGGAN Take a look at page twenty-- \nMIKE Yeah. I don't need that. \nRIGGAN What? \nMIKE I don't need the script. Just give me a cue. \nRIGGAN What are you talking about? \nMIKE Feed me a line. \nRIGGAN I don't-- What? (CONTINUED) \nMIKE Feed. Me. A line. \nRiggan drops the script and begins the scene. \nRIGGAN \"I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute.\" \nMike stares at Riggan, hyper-focused. \nMIKE (Ruminating.) Am I saying that love is absolute? (He transforms.) \"Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about is. The kind of love I'm talking about you-- (An intense pause.) Well, you don't try to kill people. \nRiggan is transfixed, and almost immediately intimidated. \nRIGGAN How do you know the lines? \nMIKE I have a thing, a whatever, a gift. (A beat.) Come on, I helped Lesley get off book. Hey, give me that cue again. \nRIGGAN \"I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is--\" MIKE Okay, can I-- Do you mind if I-- \nRIGGAN No, go ahead. \nMIKE Follow me. He says, \"I'm the wrong person to ask.\" What's his intention? Is he fed up with the topic? Deflecting? Guilt about his wife maybe? Then four sentences all say the same thing... \"I didn't even know the man.\" (MORE) (CONTINUED) MIKE (CONT'D) \"I've only heard his name mentioned in passing.\" \"I wouldn't know.\" \"You'd have to know the particulars.\" First of all, particulars? What are you, my grandmother? But the point is, YOU DON'T KNOW THE GUY, WE FUCKING GET IT. Make it one line. \"I didn't even know the guy.\" Right? ... \nRIGGAN You pretty much know my lines too, huh? MIKE Can we-- Are we doing something here? Come on let's go. Cut it down, give it to me again. \nRIGGAN \"I'm the wrong person to ask--\" \n", "test2_true": "RIGGAN Okay, let me-- \nMIKE Come on. Give it to me right now. Fuck me. Right now. Right here. Let's do it. \nRIGGAN Okay, yeah... \nMIKE DO IT! RIGGAN (Jumps in w/out thinking.) \"Hey. I'm the wrong person to ask, okay? I didn't even know the guy. So what's your point?\" \nMIKE \"What's my point?\" \nRIGGAN \"What's your point? What are you saying? Spit it out. You're saying, what? That love is an absolute?\" (CONTINUED) \nMIKE (Exploding.) \"Yeah! Alright? The kind of love I'm talking about is absolute. The kind of love I'm talking about you-- (A painful memory.) Well, you don't try to kill people. \nRiggan stands silently, his heart pounding. \nMIKE (CONT'D) So what do you think, boss? Do I have a job? \nRiggan calls over to the wings. \nRIGGAN What do you think? \nMike turns to see Sam, who has been there for a bit. SAM Larry needs to see him for a fitting. \nMIKE I'm gonna take that as a yes. (Walking to Sam.) And you are...? \nRIGGAN That's my daughter, Sam. \nMIKE Right. Yeah. I can see it around the... (A beat) She doesn't look anything like you. (To Sam.) And your job is...? \nRIGGAN She's my assistant. MIKE Your assistant... (To Sam.) And can you speak? \nSAM Yup. I can even 'sit', 'stay' or 'roll over' if you have any treats. \nRIGGAN Welcome aboard, Mike. \n(CONTINUED) \nMIKE (Mock saluting.) Thank you, Captain. \nWe follow Mike and Sam off as they... \n8   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            8 \n...advance through the hallways. \nMIKE I'm Mike Shiner, by the way. \nSAM I know who you are. (Reluctantly honest.) I saw you in 'Hothouse' at the Geffen. It was... great. \nMIKE That ass is great. \nShe turns her head toward him with a disgusted expression. \nSAM Dude. Seriously? \nMoving by her, into a dressing room. \nMIKE This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so self-conscious. \nShe follows him into the room where we see... \n9   INT. COSTUME DEPARTMENT - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                 9 \n...Larry stressing out while he works on a costume. He turns to see Mike standing there. Sam stands against the wall, focused on her cell phone. \nLARRY Oh, thank the Lord and pass the biscuits! I finally have an actor to dress. Hello, Mr. Shiner. \nMIKE How're you doing, Larry? \nLARRY Better, now that you're here. Take off your clothes. \n(CONTINUED) \nMike takes off his shirt and hands it to Sam. She doesn't budge, and it hits the floor. He begins to unbutton his pants... \n", "test3_input": "He smiles to her sadly, and then he wipes the mustard from his face with the piece of toilet paper. \nSAM Dad! \nRIGGAN What? (CONTINUED) \nSam looks at the ruined toilet paper in his hands. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Oh... Shit. I'm sorry. \nSAM (Smiling.) It's okay. You just destroyed the entire human race in one blow. \nRiggan looks at her with the saddest of expressions. SAM (CONT'D) Dad. (She hesitates.) Do you know you're becoming a trending topic? \nRIGGAN Really? What does that mean? \nSam searches for something on her iPhone and then hands it to Riggan. Riggan looks at the phone and sees a hand-held video of himself in the streets in his underwear. \nSAM 350,000 views in less than an hour. Believe it or not, this is power. \nRiggan looks at more footage, seemingly confused. After a moment, the phone vibrates and the video is interrupted by a text message, which reads \"Truth or Dare?\" \nRIGGAN It's for you. \nShe grabs the phone and looks at the screen. Then at her father. Riggan is staring at her. She looks down. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Go ahead... \nSAM (Hesitant.) Are you...? \nRIGGAN Go. \nA sympathetic smile. An understanding. Sam exits. \nRiggan stares into the mirror absently. His eyes locked on his reflection trying to find himself in the image. Then he spots a vase with dying roses, the same roses he flung to the ground previously. \n(CONTINUED) \nHe gets up and goes into the bathroom. He pulls off the long wig and the mustache. He washes his face. Then he opens a small bottle and uses the liquid to scrub his goatee. The dark dye begins to run out, leaving only white hair. For the first time we see that Riggan has a white beard. \nHe puts on new clothes and comes out of the bathroom. He grabs a beige raincoat and heads out of the dressing room and into... \n47   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            47 \n...the hallway. As he passes by Mike's door he can hear Sam and Mike. They're trying to be as quiet as possible, but we can hear them flirting and laughing. \nHe pauses for a moment but continues on. After a few seconds, his phone vibrates. He looks at it. A text from Jake reads: \"Have you seen this??? Awesome!!!\" He clicks the attachment and sees the, now infamous, video of his underwear escapade in the street. We zoom in until the image fills the screen, when we finally pull away, we discover that... \n48   INT. RUM HOUSE - LATER                                         48 ...Riggan's video is being played now in a television in the bar. We see the MTV logo on the bottom of the screen and a video caption that reads: \"Birdman goes viral, 930.000 views and counting\". The camera pans to find Riggan sitting at the bar, drunk. He is one of the few customers. He polishes off his drink. RIGGAN Let me have another one. \nBARTENDER You got it. \nThe bartender pours another whiskey for Riggan. A waiter steps up to the bar. The bartender points to a martini. \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) (To the waiter.) That's going over to Ms. Dickinson. \nRiggan's head tilts at the mention of the name. He looks over to see Tabitha sitting at a table, scratching in her notebook. \nRIGGAN (Hands the waiter a bill.) I got it. She's a friend of mine. \n(CONTINUED) \nThe waiter pockets the money and gives Riggan the drink. He walks it over to Tabitha and places it down in front of her. Not looking up, she pulls the drink closer and takes a sip. \nRiggan sits down across from her. She looks up and immediately recognizes him. He takes out the Carver cocktail napkin and pushes it in front of her. She looks at him, and then down to the napkin. She reads it in silence. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) (Re: The napkin.) That was twenty years before I put on that damned costume. \nA pause. Then she pushes the napkin back toward him. \nTABITHA I don't care. \nRIGGAN I'm just saying, when you come tomorrow night, I want you-- \nTABITHA It doesn't matter. \n", "test3_true": "TABITHA I'm going to destroy your play. \nRIGGAN You haven't even seen it. I don't-- Did I do something to offend you? \nTABITHA As a matter of fact you did. You took up space in a theater which otherwise might have been used on something worthwhile. RIGGAN But you don't even know if it's-- \nTABITHA That's true. I haven't read a word of it, or even seen a preview, but after the opening tomorrow I'm going to turn in the worst review anybody has ever read. And I'm going to close your play. Would you like to know why? Because I hate you. And everyone you represent. Entitled. Spoiled. Selfish. Children. Blissfully untrained, unversed and unprepared to even attempt real art. Handing each other awards for cartoons and (MORE) (CONTINUED) TABITHA (CONT'D) pornography. Measuring your worth in weekends. Well, this is the theater, and you don't get to come in here and pretend you can write, direct and act in your own propaganda piece without going through me first. So, break a leg. \nTabitha goes back to her writing. Riggan sits for a moment. \nRIGGAN What has to happen in someone's life, for them to end up becoming a critic? \nShe looks up at him. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) Whatcha writin'? You reviewin' a play? Was it good? Bad? Did you even see it? Lemme read. \nHe snatches the notebook from her. TABITHA I will call the police. \nRIGGAN No you won't. Let's read your review! (He scans the notebook.) \"Callow\". A label. \"Lackluster\". Label. \"Marginalia\". Sounds like you need penicillin to clear that up. None the less... label. (Looks to Tabitha.) All labels. You're a lazy fucker aren't you? (Looks one last time at the notebook.) Epistemological vertigo? \nTabitha wants to reach for the notebook, but her pride won't let her. Riggan takes a flower from a vase at the center of the table. \nRIGGAN (CONT'D) You know what this is? You don't, do you? You can't even see it if you don't label it. You mistake those sounds in your head for true knowledge. \nTABITHA Are you finished? \nRIGGAN (Wrinkling one of the pages.) Nothin' about intention, structure, (MORE) (CONTINUED) RIGGAN (CONT'D) technique. Just crappy opinions backed up by crappy comparisons. You're incapable of writing more than a couple of paragraphs, and you risk nothing of yourself. (He tears out the page and tosses the notebook.) Well, I'm an actor and this play has cost me everything. So you can take your cowardly, malicious, shittily written reviews and shove them up your... (Showing her the wrinkled page.) ...wrinkly, tight ass. \nRiggan wears a proud smile. And suddenly, Tabitha begins to smile with him. \nTABITHA You think you're an actor? (Calls to the waiter.) Eddie! Eddie the waiter approaches the table. \nWAITER Yeah, Mrs. Dickinson? \nTABITHA Give us some Shakespeare. \nWAITER No problem. Got anything in mind? \nTabitha looks over at Riggan picking the perfect verse. \nTABITHA The Scottish Play. Act five... \nWAITER Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools. The way to dusty death... \nHe is brilliant. The monologue is perfectly played and powerful. Riggan being mercilessly reminded of his mediocrity... by Eddie the waiter. \nWAITER (CONT'D) ...Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more. It is (MORE) (CONTINUED) WAITER (CONT'D) a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury... Signifying nothing. \nA few drunks clap at the beautiful performance. Then, a powerful silence rings out for a moment, until... \nTABITHA Thank you, Eddie. \nWAITER You got it. TABITHA (To Riggan. A derisive laugh.) You're no actor. You're a celebrity. Let's be clear on that. \nTabitha rises from her seat and grabs her things. \nTABITHA (CONT'D) I'm going to kill your play. She walks away. Riggan sits numb. After a moment, he reaches over and gulps down Tabitha's entire martini, gin pouring out the sides of his mouth. Unaware, he slams the empty martini glass on top of the Carver napkin and gets up. We follow him out onto... \n49    EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                    49 \n...the street, where he walks through the theater district. Tired. Drunk. Empty. Neon lights all around him. A crazy, old homeless man passes by in the opposite direction shouting furiously. Riggan keeps walking until he arrives at a bench, with a tree behind. Everything is quiet. Riggan sits on the bench, lost. We begin to tilt up, slowly, toward a tall tree. We move closer into the branches and the green leaves. Silence. \nA49                                                               A49 Night turns into day. The sounds of the city disappear and birds begin to sing. The branches now caressed by golden shafts of morning sun. Finally, we tilt down slowly and find... \n50    EXT. STREET - DAY.                                          50 \n...Riggan still sleeping on the bench. He looks like a bum. His raincoat is dirty and wet. \n(CONTINUED) \nBIRDMAN (V.O.) God. You look like shit, brother. You get that mongoloid look when you're hung over, don't you? \nRiggan opens an eye. He scratches his hair. \nBIRDMAN (V.O.) Let's go. Get up. It's a beautiful day. \n"}

Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy vigilante's stash.  The first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends.  The second's more in line with what he needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING. 
A TRAIN rumbles past underneath.  BRUCE removes his COWL and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park.  A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten topcoat: perfect.  As he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd -- 
It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine condition.  He removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him.  Stitched on the vest is a single initial, "R," in a black circle.  He stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... 
The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE.  Someone's in the tunnel with him.  He lowers the costume abruptly -- 
-- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away.  The kid's just crawled up through the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff: 
DICK It's MINE! 
He lunges furiously at BRUCE.  The two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE -- 
EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling. BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment.  DICK lands hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... 
Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent.  The body armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view... 
As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the bridge.  Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. 
The kid sizes up the situation immediately.  He nods his head up and down.  Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to BRUCE. 
BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth.  He pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off. 
DICK NO.  WAIT! 
BRUCE turns, uncertainly.  DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP. 
The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably.  Then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping.  As he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK -- 
-- which is obviously intended to divert the cops.  BRUCE makes haste in the opposite direction. 
EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER 
BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it. 
INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
TWO COPS scanning the park.  The CAPED HORSE charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights.  From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in the saddle. 
The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn.  A moment later, he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. 
A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap, obviously one of the homeless.  A COP leans on the horn and shouts out the window: 
COP Dumb son of a bitch!! 
The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path. The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN 
A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table.  ALFRED, in robe and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE BANDAGE. 
ALFRED Commissioner Gordon called.  He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman. 
BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair.  His shirt is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS. 
BRUCE Great.  What'd you tell him? 
ALFRED I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman. 
BRUCE makes a face: how droll.  ALFRED tears off the tape with a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF PAIN. 
BRUCE Jesus, Alfred -- !! 
ALFRED In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings. 
BRUCE It's just a few bruises. 
ALFRED One bruise, sir.  Which covers your entire body. 
BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's bag. 
BRUCE I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face -- 
ALFRED I shouldn't worry overmuch.  I doubt the two of you move in the same circles. 
BRUCE -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. 
ALFRED Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming. 
INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY 
In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS littering the carpet.  HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one wall. 
They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE across the street... 
HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT 
A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone.  He signals "all clear" to his counterpart watching from the house opposite. 
INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT

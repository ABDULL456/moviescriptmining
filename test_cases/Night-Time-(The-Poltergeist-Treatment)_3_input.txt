This discovery, along with the disclosure of the events at the Freeling household, cause experts to hypothesize that perhaps through a rift in the barrier between "now" and "then," and through one of the members of the Freeling family, as a mortal host, the spirits have found a gateway into the 1980's and American suburbia. Some hypothesize that they are looking for help to the next world, the world that they belong in, and the world that has been denied them. 
The Freelings are instantly descended upon by professional, pseudo-professional and crack-pot ghost hunters who all want to spend an evening in the house with the ghosts and their new-fangled equipment for recording spirits on film and tape. A psychologist informs the family that perhaps the spirits are attracted to one member of the family, and that a battery of tests could be run to determine who it was. Not wanting to place any kind of "blame" or ostracization upon any member of the family , they refuse the testing. Besides, what would they do with the "guilty" party? As the Freelings and their house become unwitting celebrities, the children are saddled with a barrage of torment from schoolmates. They are avoided. They are "the haunted people."

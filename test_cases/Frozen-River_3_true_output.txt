LILA We gotta go back. 
RAY I can't believe they put their baby in a duffle bag. 
LILA I can't believe you left it out there. 
RAY If you'd let me search it I would never have taken it- 
LILA We gotta go back. 
RAY I know! I know that. 
Ray speeds along. 
80   INT. ROUTE 37, THE RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT                 80 
Partly hidden, behind a barn, Trooper Mike Napoli watches the cars pass on Route 37, leaving the Reservation. The Acclaim passes. 
81   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                  81 
The trailer is aglow in Christmas lights. Ricky has fallen asleep on the couch. 
A car horn blows outside. T.J. runs outside. 
82   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - SAME                                   82 
A beat up car is there. Inside a teenager, MITCH, a few years older than T.J., hands him out a Hot Wheels Tech Track Air Stunt Challenge Set. 
MITCH That's what you wanted, right? 
T.J. Close enough. 
T.J. gives Mitch a piece of paper with a list of names and credit card numbers including that of Irene ThreeRivers. 
MITCH Thanks Man, Have a Merry One. 
T.J turns to go back inside. He sees SMOKE RISING through the cracks in the siding and goes to the back. 
BLACK SMOKE POURS from under the trailer where old insulation is smoldering. T.J. runs to the shed, takes a fire extinguisher and sprays under the trailer. Steam rises. The fire appears to be out. 
83   INT. RAY'S TRAILER   - NIGHT                                83 
T.J. comes back in. Smoke filters up though the cracks in the linoleum floor. He covers Ricky with extra blankets and opens the windows. 
84   EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                                   84 
Ray and Lila drive down the boat launch to the river. The storm has stopped and the river is an endless white surface. 
85   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                        85 
Ray and Lila creep along. 
LILA Look, there. Tracks. 
RAY (squints) Where? 
LILA Up there. 
Ray speeds up. Faint tire tracks appear in the distance. 
LILA (CONT'D) Slow down, I don't want to run over it. Stop. I think it was here. 
Ray stops the car. Lila gets out. Ray puts her jacket over her head and follows. 
Ray's cell phone plays "Old MacDonald" on the seat of the Acclaim. 
86   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                  86 
Wearing his coat in the trailer, with the windows and door open, T.J. dials the phone. He gets Ray's cell phone. 
RAY'S VOICE (faintly heard though the phone) Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you're alive, because the boys are worried about you. 
He doesn't leave a message. 
Ricky snores on the couch covered in a pile of blankets. 
87   EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                                   87 
Lila runs ahead. Ray struggles to keep Lila in sight. 
Ray comes up behind Lila, rifling through THE UNZIPPED DUFFEL BAG. She suddenly jumps back at the sight of the tiny face of an infant, wrapped in blankets, eyes closed, lips blue. 
LILA It's dead. 
Ray looks at the baby. Instinctively, she swoops down and gathers it up. 
Ray heads for the car.

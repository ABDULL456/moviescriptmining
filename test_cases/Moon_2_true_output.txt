Gerty is continuing to run tests on Sam 3. Sam 2 enters. He carries the freighted exhaustion of a man who has just completed a long and difficult journey. 
SAM 2 How long before he's conscious, Gerty? 
GERTY The new clone will be conscious within one hour. 
SAM 2 That's good. That's very good. 
GERTY Sam?   Where is Sam? 
SAM 2 He's gone home, Gerty. 
Sam 2 leaves. 
149   INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                             149 
Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER in preparation for his trip back to Earth. 
Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire. 
Gerty glides in as he works. 
GERTY Sam, this is not going to work. 
SAM 2 What? Why not? 
Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15 million dollars worth! 
GERTY If the Rescue Unit examine my memory banks they will discover what has taken place over the last week. As you know I record everything. If they are suspicious, the first thing they will do is search my memory banks, and this would put you in considerable danger. 
Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now. This is serious. It could ruin everything. 
The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam. 
GERTY (CONT'D) I recommend erasing my memory banks. I can reboot myself once you have departed. 
SAM 2 So that's what we're going to have to do. (beat) Are you ok with that? 
GERTY I'll require your assistance, Sam. 
SAM 2 Sure, just let me finish this. 
Sam 2 continues his work.

Sam 1 inside the crashed rover, resembling a wild animal pinned in a trap. He's still breathing. 
SAM 1'S DREAM 
Once again we see Tess beneath the tree sitting on the blanket. She looks over at Sam, continuing to wave. 
TESS Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on! 
Sam begins to walk towards Tess.

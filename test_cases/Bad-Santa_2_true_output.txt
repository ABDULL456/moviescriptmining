Bob Chipeska holds up one hand. 
CHIPESKA Now don't get me wrong. I was against the Clinton impeachment. What a man does with his penis -- Oval Office, Women's Big & Tall -- it's not for the American people to say. 
GIN Right. 
CHIPESKA But when you're dealing with children, a tender sensibility, a position of trust -- then perhaps, someone who has screaming orgasms with large women -- 
GIN Mm. 
CHIPESKA Though I can't fire him for that. 
GIN No. 
CHIPESKA Sizisra. They'd say. 
GIN Sure. 
CHIPESKA Not true. I am no siziat. But I can see the picket line now. 
GIN Yeah, a big fuckin' fat one. 
CHIPESKA They'd all say, If it had been a supermodel or, uh... 
GIN Heeyeah. Unfair practices. A lot of special pleading. Bitch, bitch, bitch. Fuckin' broads. 
CHIPESKA But -- I can't help it -- the guy makes me uneasy. 
GIN Well sure. Santa fuckin' someone in the ass. 
CHIPESKA So maybe there's something I could fire him for. 
GIN Yeah. Yeah. I getcha. 
CHIPESKA Do you? Do you think you could find something? 
GIN Oh shit yeah. There's always something. 
INT. SAGAURO SQUARE MALL - VIDEO ARCADE - NIGHT 
POV through the arcade's window shows Willie talking in pantomime to a young girl -- a very young girl -- at one of the pinball machines. Willie has his hands out to either side and is either demonstrating the kind of body English to apply to the machine, or else is describing an elaborate sexual encounter -- either recalled or prospective. The girl, giggles. 
A REVERSE shows Marcus halted at the arcade window staring in with disbelief that gives way to jaw-grinding anger: 
MARCUS ...Motherfucker... Oh, you lousy fucking motherfuck... 
EXT. SAGOARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Willie and Marcus walk to their cars. 
MARCUS That's just the kinda shit that's gonna get us pinched! 
WILLIE (apologetic) She said she was eighteen. 
MARCUS You promised no arcades! You said you'd only hustle Big & Tall! 
WILLIE Ah, it's like shooting fish in a barrel -- there's no sport, 
MARCUS How many times, you fuck? "The bigger the store, the bigger the take." Well, we can't work the big stores with your big fucking train wrecks! 
WILLIE (pulling out his keys) You got some nerve you little shit ya! You my mom now?! You shat me out your womb, is that it? You gotta take care of me!? Well I can take care of myself and I don't need no lectures! I know how to keep a low profile! 
BOOP-BOOP! Willie uses his key fob to deactivate the car alarm to the Mercedes. 
MARCUS What the fuck is this?! 
WILLIE Mind your own fucking business.

SPOONER And I think it's smart enough to repair itself -- don't you? 
CALVIN (studying him) Yes. I think so. 
SPOONER Where? 
CALVIN Any repair shop... 
SPOONER No. It's always the owner who brings the robot in for repair. Where would a robot without an owner go? 
CALVIN I'm not sure what you're getting at. 
SPOONER (stepping closer) Does U.S. Robotics have a factory in the city limits? 
Calvin.   Tucking her hair behind her ears. 
CALVIN The locations of our factories are classified. 
SPOONER I don't care. 
Calvin.   Looks up at him.   A Mexican stand-off. 
CALVIN I have several conditions if I show you. 
SPOONER I expected that. 
CALVIN First. I want it brought in unharmed. 
SPOONER (doesn't like it, but) Agreed. 
CALVIN Second.   I want to talk to it, alone. 
SPOONER Too dangerous. 
CALVIN This model violated the Three Laws. It also moved and reacted differently than any robot I've ever seen. There must be some sort of logical explanation. I want to find out what that is. No police. No prosecutors. No you. Just me and the robot. 
Spooner, looks down at this small woman.      Narrows his eyes. 
SPOONER When they told me you were a psychologist, that wasn't the whole truth, was it? 
CALVIN I never said I treated human beings. 
37   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT   37 
Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16- lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS stretches forever in either direction. 
A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head. 
CALVIN That should be outlawed once and for all. 
SPOONER That'll be the day I stop driving. 
Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR. Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale. 
CALVIN I can recommend a behavior modification program, you know -- if you want to overcome your robo- phobia. 
SPOONER I'm not afraid of robots.   I just don't like them. 
CALVIN Why? Because they make every aspect of our lives more convenient? 
SPOONER Exactly. They do our dirty work. Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody can do someone else's dirty work without coming to hate them. I don't want to be around when your robots decide they've taken their last order. 
CALVIN That day will never come, Detective. Robots aren't like human beings -- they don't question their existence. 
Spooner cranks the gear shift.    Throwing her a look. 
SPOONER Spoken like a true robo-phile. 
38   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - NIGHT                               38 
The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT. 
Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex. 
39   EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT                                         39 
Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R. ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly, the gate begins to open. 
40   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                           40 
A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway.    Shaking his head. 
NIGHT FOREMAN Head-Office already ordered a system-wide inventory check. Don't know about a missing NS-2...

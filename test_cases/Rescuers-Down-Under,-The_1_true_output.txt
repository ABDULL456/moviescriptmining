Cody:    NO!!  Please!! 
(Joanna runs for the cliff, sees how far down it is and balks in fear.) 
McLeach: (mocking) Why, whatever is the matter Joanna??  (She points down; McLeach kicks her over the edge).  Git!! 
(Joanna goes down to eat the eggs; she searches the nest for them; finds the eggs; takes a bite of one; it is rock hard; she tries another with the same result; she drops one egg on the other which lands on her tail and she shreiks in pain) 
(screaming from on top of cliff)  JOANNA!!  You hurry up and eat those eggs and get your tail up here!  MOVE IT!! 
(Joanna moves the "eggs" to the edge; knocks them over the cliff with her tail; she yanks on the rope for McLeach to bring he up; as she does, another rock falls that looks like an egg; Bernard comes out of hiding.) 
Bernard: (to the eggs) O.k. you guys, she fell for it.  Looks like the coast is clear. 
Wilbur:  (flying in to Marahute's nest)  Girls?  Girls, I'm here! (laughs) Where are you, you little chickees you?  (laugh) 
Bernard: (puzzled at first)  Wilbur?  (louder) Wilbur! 
Wilbur:  (screams and falls off the edge) Don't EVER do that to me again! Oh... boy... I lost a lot of feathers on that one. 
Bernard: Wilbur am I glad to see you!  Give me a hand with these eggs will ya? (rolling the eggs out of hiding.) 
Wilbur:  Yeah, sure.  Wait a minute.... what the heck are you doing up here anyway?? 
Bernard: The kidnapper took the boy and Jake.... Miss Bianca. 
Wilbur:  Miss Bianca??  Miss Bianca's in trouble?!?  Woah!  Geez!  That's terrible!  We gotta do something!  (chastising) Bernard, I'm disappointed in you.  Hidin' under a nest while Miss Bianca needs our help.  I gotta talk to you mister...

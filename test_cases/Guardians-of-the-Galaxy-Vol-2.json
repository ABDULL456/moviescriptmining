Rocket gawks at Drax, betrayed. \nROCKET Dude. \nDRAX Oh, right. He didn't steal one of those. I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is. \nTHE SOVEREIGN FIRE UPON THE MILANO. \nQuill does his best to evade their blasts. \nQUILL What were you thinking?! \nROCKET Dude, it was really easy to steal. \nGAMORA That's your defense? \nROCKET Come on. You saw how that high- priestess talked down to us! I'm teaching her a lesson! \nQUILL Oh! I didn't realize your motivation was altruism. A shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions and are trying to kill us. \nROCKET Exactly. \nQUILL I WAS BEING SARCASTIC! \nROCKET Oh no! You tricked me! You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish! \nDrax points at Rocket and LAUGHS at him. \nQUILL SHUT UP, DRAX! You knew! You should have told us! \nDrax is aghast. He looks at Rocket. \nDRAX Did you tell him it was easy to steal? \nROCKET Are you kidding me? \nDRAX What? \nROCKET You never listen to anything! \nGAMORA None of you listens! Can we please just put the bickering on hold until after we survive the massive space battle?! \nRocket glances at Quill, nodding back at Gamora. \nROCKET Whoa. Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. \nQUILL Do not try to bro down with me right now, dude. I will fricking punch you in your fricking face. \nROCKET Real nice!

SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nA SOVEREIGN ADMIRAL is beside Ayesha. \nAYESHA What is the delay, Admiral? \nADMIRAL High Priestess, if we destroy their craft, we risk destroying the batteries. They're extraordinarily combustible and could, in turn, destroy the entire fleet. \nAYESHA We have thousands of batteries and thousands of ships. Our concern is their slight against our people.

But the access point is 47 clicks away. And it's through that Quantum Asteroid Field over there. \nQuill spots, to his side, a HUGE FIELD OF SMALL, GLOWING ASTEROIDS, SWIRLING IN RANDOM PATTERNS, DISAPPEARING OUT OF SPACE and EMERGING AGAIN a few feet or a few yards away. \nQuill ZOOMS SIDEWAYS toward the field. \nDRAX Quill, to make it through that, you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe. \nQuill smirks. \nQUILL Lucky for us - \nROCKET I am. \nRocket FLIPS the pilot controls between them so that he's the one piloting the ship. Quill gapes at him. \nThe Milano DIVES into the QUANTUM ASTEROID FIELD, SWOOPING in and around the SWIRLING ATOMIZED STONES, barely missing them. \nThe Sovereign ships FOLLOW.

Gamora glances at him. He explains: \nDRAX I have famously huge turds. \nGAMORA We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing? \nDRAX They raise havoc with the pipes. That's why I do all the plumbing. I take responsibility for my actions. Unlike some people... \nDrax eyes baby Groot. \nQUILL Groot, he's right, you have to start aiming inside the box. \nGroot looks ashamed.

GO! \nAs they're about to reach the jump point, Rocket sees a MAN standing casually atop the oval ship, LIGHT BURSTING THROUGH HIS BODY and into the craft - the source of the explosion. \nROCKET It's a guy. \nQuill doesn't see as the Milano DISAPPEARS INTO THE JUMP POINT. \nI/E.

Two bodyguards, BRAHL and HALF-NUT, salute and follow him as he descends the stairwell. \nAt the bottom of the stairs a group of RAVAGERS in BLUE UNIFORMS LAUGH. A gruff, older warrior, STAKAR, and a man seemingly made of diamonds, MARTINEX are among them. \nYondu stops when he sees them. He's struck.

But instead of returning you, Yondu kept you. I have no clue as to why. \nQUILL Because I was a skinny kid who could squeeze into places adults couldn't, making thieving easier. \nEGO I've been trying to track you down ever since. \nDRAX I thought Yondu was your father. \nQUILL What? \nDrax stares at him. \nQUILL (CONT'D) We've been together all this time and you thought Yondu was my actual, blood relative? \nDRAX You look exactly alike. \nROCKET One's blue. \nQUILL He wasn't my father.

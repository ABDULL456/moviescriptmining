{"train": "GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 \nWritten by \nJames Gunn \nBLACK: \nO.S. \"BRANDY\" by LOOKING GLASS PLAYS. \nEXT. FORD COBRA MUSTANG - DAY \nSUPER: MISSOURI EARTH \nOVERHEAD SHOT: A `79 Cobra winds alongside the Missouri River, past swaying loosestrife, vibrant sugar maples, and oily self-pump gas stations. A hazy sun glints off the hood of the Cobra which, like its descendant the Milano, is orange and teal. \nWe MOVE DOWN AND IN on a fresh-faced girl of 18 in the passenger seat: MEREDITH QUILL. As \"Brandy\" blasts from the car stereo, she pushes her fine, feathered hair from her mouth, and sings along, out-of-tune - \nMEREDITH Do do do do do do do do do do do! \nThe driver, a MYSTERIOUS MAN in his 30's, dressed in sleek, mod attire, LAUGHS. \nMeredith LAUGHS too. She SINGS and dances with abandon in her seat. She's a lively goofball, and it's apparent where Peter Quill received much of his personality. \nEXT. DAIRY QUEEN/WOODS - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Cobra pulls beside this Dairy Queen in a desolate area. \nEXT. WOODS BEHIND DAIRY QUEEN - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Mysterious Man helps Meredith down the steep hillside into the woods. \"Brandy\" continues to play on the car stereo in the lot behind them. Meredith GIGGLES. \nMYSTERIOUS MAN This way, my river lily. \nMEREDITH Where are you taking me? \nThe Mysterious Man shows her a STRANGE SPROUT nestled amongst the trees. \nA few inches tall and decidedly alien in nature, its delicate limbs twist and turn in a complex pattern. \nMEREDITH (CONT'D) Oh. It's beautiful. \nThe Mysterious Man looks proudly at Meredith. With a perpetually excited glint in his eye, and the air of a self- empowerment guru, he is an intoxicating presence. \nMYSTERIOUS MAN I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil, but it rooted quickly. \nHe nods toward the sky between the branches above. \nMYSTERIOUS MAN (CONT'D) Soon it will be everywhere - all across the universe, fulfilling life's one true purpose. \nMEREDITH Which is what? \nMYSTERIOUS MAN Expansion. \nThe Mysterious Man takes her in his arms.    He gazes into her eyes. She grows almost teary. \nMEREDITH I'm not sure what you're talking about. But I like the way you say it. \nMYSTERIOUS MAN My heart is yours, Meredith Quill. \nMEREDITH I can't believe I fell in love with a spaceman. \nAnd they KISS, with passion, and love. \"DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO!\" sings Looking Glass as SOURCE BECOMES SCORE and we TILT DOWN to the plant. It TWITCHES AND GROWS AND TWISTS. \nWe PUSH IN ON IT, where we see the plant is made, not only of cellulose and leaves, but of a BRIGHT COSMIC LIGHT. And we KEEPING PUSHING IN, INTO THE PLANT ITSELF, more FLESH-LIKE than you'd imagine, where COLORFUL BACTERIA OVERCOMES US as \"BRANDY\" DISTORTS AND TRANSFORMS into something epic. \nO.S. A CRACK OF INTERDIMENSIONAL THUNDER \nSUPER: 34 Years Later \nEXT. THE SOVEREIGN - OUTER SPACE \nAn artificial, golden planet, made of interlocking orbs, revolves around a blue sun. \nWe PUSH IN on THUNDEROUS INTERDIMENSIONAL CRACKS on one small patch of planet. \nSUPER: THE SOVEREIGN M49 5IOL339P21+H9LNI31 \nI/E. POWER STATION - DAY \nA DIMENSIONAL CRACK SNAPS in the sky overhead. PETER QUILL looks from it to an old MATTEL ELECTRONICS FOOTBALL GAME converted into a tracker. A RED DOT APPROACHES. \nQUILL Showtime, a-holes! It'll be here any minute! \nGAMORA (O.S.) Which will be its loss. \nQuill turns toward GAMORA, loading a rifle. DRAX, ROCKET, and BABY GROOT also ready themselves for battle in this grand, open-air power station. Dozens of BATTERIES are couched in conductor towers encircling them. Quill, Gamora, and Rocket wear flying rigs. \nQUILL Is that a rifle? \nGAMORA You don't know what a rifle is? \nQUILL I thought your thing was a sword. \nGAMORA We've been hired to stop an interdimensional beast from feeding on those batteries' energy, and I'm going to stop it with a sword? \nQUILL (mumbling to himself) Don't look at me like I'm stupid. You're the one being all inconsistent. \nA LOUDER, LARGER CRACK: something seems to be fighting its way through the sky. \nGAMORA Drax, why aren't you wearing one of Rocket's aero-rigs? \nDRAX It hurts. \nGAMORA Hurts? \nDRAX (MUTTERING) I have sensitive nipples. \nRocket, who is working on a pair of speakers wired to Quill's Walkman, LAUGHS HARD at this. Drax points at him. \nDRAX (CONT'D) What about him?! What's he doing?! \nROCKET If I finish this, we can listen to tunes while we work. \nDRAX How is that a priority? \nGAMORA (CONT'D) Drax, no! That doesn't make - \nThe creature OPENS ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH, SCREECHING, and Drax LEAPS INSIDE IT, instantly swallowed up. \nQUILL What is he doing?! \nGAMORA He said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside, so he -- \nQUILL That doesn't make sense! \nGAMORA I tried to tell -- ! \nQUILL Its skin is the same thickness from the inside as from the out! \nGAMORA I REALIZE THAT. \nINT. BEAST'S STOMACH - DOESN'T MATTER \nDrax HOLLERS as he SLASHES AWAY inside the goo of the beast's stomach. To no avail. \nI/E. POWER STATION - DAY \nQuill reloads his pistol, thinking. \nQUILL Gamora, there's a cut on its neck - Rocket, get it to look up. \nQuill and Rocket JET UP HIGH up over the creature as they BLAST REPEATEDLY at it. \nQUILL (CONT'D) Hey, you giant Sea Monkey, up here! \nGamora's rifle is jammed.    She tosses it down.   PULLS HER SWORD. SNAPS IT OPEN. \nThe beast SCREECHES at Quill and Rocket FLYING overhead.       The colorful SPLATTER MATTER FLIES FROM ITS MOUTH, BATTERING ROCKET, BURNING his clothes. \nBut its neck is exposed, where the skin is thinner, and there is a small wound. \nGamora DASHES, LEAPING HIGH into the air, and she PLUNGES her sword directly into the wound. \nShe holds tight to the hilt as she FALLS, SLICING AN INCISION down the length of the creature's neck. \nThe beast WOBBLES, TOPPLES, and DIES. As it COLLAPSES, Drax SPILLS OUT of the wound. He raises his arms in victory. \nDRAX Ha ha! I have single-handedly vanquished the beast! \nQuill SCOFFS. Rocket SNORTS. Gamora stares at him, dead-eyed. Baby Groot throws a rock at him. \nDRAX (CONT'D) What? \nI/E. POWER STATION - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Guardians de-rig by the Anulax batteries. \nDRAX What are they called again? \nQUILL Anulax batteries. \nDRAX Harbulary batteries. \nQUILL That's nothing like what I just said. But they're worth thousands of units a piece. Which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them. \nRocket pulls out one of the ANULAX BATTERIES, checking it out. \nGamora, Drax, and Quill walk on. Rocket stays back a moment. Quill nods down the walkway, where GOLDEN SOVEREIGN CITIZENS stand at the edge of the station, gawking. \nQUILL (CONT'D) Just be careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended and the cost of transgression is death. \nDRAX Sounds judgmental for a bunch of golden morons. \nQUILL That's the kind of thing you might want to keep to yourself. \nGAMORA I'll hold my tongue, as long as they deliver what was promised. \nEXT. LAIR OF THE HIGH PRIESTESS - MORNING \nAn enormous golden palace in the shape of a globe, dappled by morning sunlight. \nAYESHA (O.S.) We thank you, Guardians, for putting your life on the line. We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens. \nINT. LAIR OF THE HIGH PRIESTESS - DAY \nHIGH PRIESTESS AYESHA is stunningly beautiful with golden skin. Her CHAMBERMAIDS and other DENIZENS flutter throughout her luxurious lair, all of whom are equally perfect. \nAYESHA Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community, impeccable, both physically and mentally. We control the DNA of our progeny, germinating them in birthing pods. \nQUILL I guess I prefer making people the old-fashioned way. \nAYESHA Well... perhaps someday you could give me a history lesson in the archaic ways of our ancestors... for academic purposes. \nQUILL Yeah, I mean, if it's for research that could be pretty -- \nQuill sees Gamora staring at him. \nQUILL (CONT'D) Pretty repulsive. I'm not into that kind of casual - \nGAMORA Oh, please. (TO AYESHA) Your people promised something in trade for our services. Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way. \nAyesha nods. \nTwo SOLDIERS emerge with A WOMAN in a hood and cloak, her wrists bound by SHACKLES. They SHOVE HER TO HER KNEES and yank back her hood, REVEALING -- \nNEBULA. Her clothes are tattered.    Her hand is now just a low- tech metal claw. \nShe glares at Gamora. Gamora glares at her. Quill looks from one to the other, feeling the tension. \nQUILL (QUIETLY) Family reunion. Yaaaay. \nAYESHA I understand she is your sister? \nGamora roughly picks Nebula up, starts to go. \nGAMORA She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar. \nAYESHA Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries. Do with her as you please. \nQUILL Thank you, High Priestess Ayesha. \nEveryone catches their breath, relieved. \nROCKET Well, that's what you get when Quill flies. \nGamora THROWS SOMETHING HARD at the back of Rocket's head. \nROCKET (CONT'D) Ow! \nGAMORA There's still a Sovereign craft behind us! \nThe electronics FLICKER. \nQUILL Our weapons are down! \nGAMORA Twenty clicks to the jump. \nThe Mean Pilot BLASTS at them from the sole Sovereign Craft, TAKING OUT another part of a wing. The Milano is TREMBLING. \nDrax starts climbing down into the living area. \nQUILL Where's he going? \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nA group of pilots have gathered around the Mean Pilot, rooting him on, like kids at a video arcade. \nFRIGHTENED PILOT Come on, Zylak, you can do this. \nI/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE \nNebula sees the bowl of yaro root has spilled in front of her. \nShe reaches for a piece, but it's KICKED OUT OF HER WAY. \nShe looks up to see Drax, grabbing a cable on a spool attached to the wall. \nDRAX It's not ripe. \nDrax HOOKS the cable to his belt. A folder on the wall reads SPACESUITS FOR EMERGENCY and, below that, in Rocket's scrawl: OR FOR FUN. \nDrax pulls a small disk from the folder. He slaps it between his shoulder blades and a SHIMMERY SHEATH COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY - a thin force-field spacesuit. \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nGamora watches THE MAP leading to the jump point. \nGAMORA Fifteen clicks. \nAnother BLAST from the Sovereign craft HITS them. \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nThe pilots rooting on the Mean Pilot erupt into CHEERS. \nI/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE \nDrax grabs a huge rifle. \nHe punches buttons on the wall. A SECOND PROTECTIVE SHIELD OPENS UP between him and Nebula, and THE FIRST PROTECTIVE SHEATH OPENS, exposing him to space -- \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nThe Mean Pilot watches in awe as Drax JUMPS OUT the back of the Milano. \nI/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE \nDrax smiles. The cable UNSPOOLS and SNAPS TAUT when it reaches its end. \nDrax is DRAGGED HAPHAZARDLY by the Milano like a water sled on a boat. \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nON THE MAP, the jump point gets closer. \nGAMORA Ten clicks. \nI/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE \nThe Mean Pilot BLASTS WILDLY at Drax, missing him by mere inches. \nDrax brings the sight to his eye.   Aims at the ship. \nDRAX Die, spaceship. \nAnd he SHOOTS, BLASTING the Sovereign ship. \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nThe Mean Pilot SCREAMS as his lights go out. The Frightened Pilot shakes his head in disgust. \nFRIGHTENED PILOT You suck, Zylak. \nZylak is really sad. \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nAs Quill and Rocket leave the asteroid field, it seems for a moment they're scot-free... \nGAMORA Five clicks! \nThen DOZENS OF OMNICRAFT pull around them on both sides. \nQUILL Son-of-a-! They went around the field! \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nAyesha smiles. \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nIt looks like the end of the road for the Guardians when - \nTHERE IS A BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT AND ALL OF THE OMNICRAFT EXPLODE. \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nROCKET Is that better? \nDRAX I don't know. \nQUILL It's worse. \nROCKET YOU SON-OF-A-!! \nRocket LEAPS, SNAPPING at Quill, when Nebula looks up into the sky. \nNEBULA Someone followed you through the jump point. \nA HUGE SPACESHIP HOVERS overhead. \nThe Guardians COCK THEIR WEAPONS as they FALL BACK-TO-BACK in tight formation. \nNEBULA (CONT'D) Set me free. You'll need my help. \nGAMORA I'm not a fool, Nebula. \nNEBULA You're a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat. \nGAMORA You'll attack me the moment I let you go. \nNEBULA (mumbly, unconvincing) No, I won't. \nQUILL You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie. \nDRAX I bet it's the one-inch man!! \nThe SHIP LANDS, CRUSHING ALL OF THE TREES AROUND IT. \nA HATCH OPENS, and an adventurous, outer space frontiersman steps forward. He has grown hardened and haggard over the years, but he is definitely the MYSTERIOUS MAN from the beginning of the film. MANTIS, a creepy woman with antennae, emerges behind him. \nThe Man smiles. \nMYSTERIOUS MAN After all these years, I've found you. \nQUILL Who the hell are you? \nMYSTERIOUS MAN I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious. My name's Ego. And I'm your Dad, Peter. \nEXT. CONTRAXIA - OUTER SPACE \nQUIET. A planet of mostly water and white icy patches of land, revolving around two overlapping suns. \nSUPER: CONTRAXIA M15 5127512731+X1955KX \nEXT. THE IRON LOTUS - DAY \nSNOW FALLS GENTLY over this sleepy, pastel-colored town of wood and stone buildings. \nPUSH IN on the Iron Lotus, a robot brothel and saloon. ASSORTED RAVAGERS, including KRAGLIN, as well as some ROBOTIC COURTESANS, are drunk and GIGGLING, trying to catch snowflakes on their tongues. \nINT. IRON LOTUS SUITE - DAY \nYONDU UDONTA is staring out the window as he puts on his pants. He looks utterly disconnected and alone. \nBehind him are three ROBOT COURTESANS.   One pushes a button on her neck and she POWERS DOWN. \nTULLK (O.S.) Yondu! Come on down! \nYondu looks down at the street where an older Ravager, TULLK, drunkenly dances, waving for him to join. \nINT. IRON LOTUS - MOMENTS LATER \nYondu exits his suite. Two bodyguards, BRAHL and HALF-NUT, salute and follow him as he descends the stairwell. \nAt the bottom of the stairs a group of RAVAGERS in BLUE UNIFORMS LAUGH. A gruff, older warrior, STAKAR, and a man seemingly made of diamonds, MARTINEX are among them. \nYondu stops when he sees them. He's struck. Stakar LAUGHS as he tells a story - \nSTAKAR And I was like, Aleta, I love you, but you're crazy now, you always BEEN - \nYondu approaches Stakar with trepidation. \nYONDU Stakar. \nStakar is surprised to see him. \nYONDU (CONT'D) Been some time. I'd - \nSTAKAR Seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable. \nThe blue-coats turn and walk away. \nYONDU Stakar... \nStakar glances at the PROPRIETOR as he passes her. \nSTAKAR There are a hundred Ravager factions, Sneeper. You just lost the business of ninety-nine by serving one. \nPROPRIETOR Please, sir! Sir! \nYondu stands there for a moment, hurt, as they head out the door. \nBut, little by little, his hurt turns to rage and he FOLLOWS. \nEXT. IRON LOTUS - DAY \nYondu trots quickly toward Stakar and the others. \nYONDU You all can go to hell! I don't care what you think of me! \nStakar swirls toward him, furious. \nSTAKAR Then why you following us for?! \nYONDU `Cause you'll listen to what I got to say! \nSTAKAR I don't got to listen to nothing! You betrayed the code! Ravagers don't deal in kids! \nYONDU I didn't know what was going on - \nSTAKAR You didn't know `cause you didn't want to know, `cause it made you rich! \nQuill and Gamora enter this private spot; the campfire flickers through the trees beyond them. \nQUILL Give me a break! After all this time, and he just expects to be my Dad all of the sudden! \nGAMORA I hear you. \nQUILL I mean, this could be a trap - the Kree purists, the Ravagers, now the Sovereign - they all want us dead. \nGAMORA I know, but - \nQUILL But what? \nGAMORA What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau? \nQUILL Who? \nGAMORA The wonderful television-singer man. He had a magic boat. \nQUILL David Hasselhoff? \nGAMORA Right. \nQUILL He had a talking car, not a magic - \nGAMORA Why did it talk again? \nQUILL Just to be a good friend, I guess. \nGAMORA And as a child you carried his picture in your pocket, and you told the other children he was your father, but he was out of town -- \nQUILL (EMBARRASSED) Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany. Why are you bringing this up now? I was drunk when I told you that. \nGAMORA I love that story. \nQUILL I don't. It's just sad! I was so sad because I'd see the other kids off playing catch with their dads, and I wanted that, more than anything in the world. \nGamora takes Quill's hands in her own. \nGAMORA My point is, maybe this man is your Hasselhoff. I know it's a long shot. But I lost my father as a child. I'd give anything... \nQuill nods, grudgingly. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) If he ends up being evil, we'll just kill him. \nQuill CHUCKLES. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) What's funny? \nI/E. CRASHED MILANO - SUNRISE \nInside the ship, \"THE CHAIN\" BY FLEETWOOD MAC PLAYS on the cassette player. Nebula is angry. \nNEBULA You're leaving me with that fox?! \nRocket is SOLDERING the ship. \nGAMORA He's not a fox. \nGamora glances at Rocket as she grabs her outer-space- adventurer version of luggage. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) Shoot her if she does anything suspicious. Or if you feel like it. \nRocket GRUNTS.    Gamora looks at a sad Baby Groot. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) It will just be a couple days. We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship. \nGamora steps out. Rocket sees Groot, who is ABOUT TO CRY as he watches them go. \nDrax and Quill come from the back of the ship. \nDRAX What about your spool of songs? \nQUILL I have clones. \nDRAX What if the Sovereign come? \nQUILL There's no way for them to know they're here. \nDRAX I am uncertain about parting ways. \nQUILL You're like an old woman. \nDRAX Because I am wise? \nQuill turns to Rocket as Drax and Gamora head toward the ship. He starts to say something nice - perhaps something conciliatory but -- \nROCKET Hope daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy. \nQuill just shakes his head and SNICKERS. \nQUILL So what's your goal here? To get everyone to hate you? `Cause it's working. \nQuill turns back around with Gamora and Drax and walks away. \nRocket looks at the others leaving as THE SONG BECOMES SCORE: I can still hear you saying you will never break the chain. Rocket watches them move away. \nIN SLOW-MOTION, Quill, Drax, and Gamora approach the oval ship. The slit opens. Ego, with Mantis, is waiting inside. \nEgo smiles and CLASPS his hand on Quill as he enters. \nINT. EGOS SHIP. SUNRISE \nQuill sits back against the wall, alone, nervous. He looks across the way at a SLEEP CHAMBER, where Mantis helps Ego lie down on a slab. \nShe places her hand on his forehead with her hand: her antennae ALIGHT. And he drifts off to sleep. \nQuill takes a small, folded piece of paper out of his pocket. \nIt's the PHOTO OF DAVID HASSELHOFF. \nHe looks at it, then looks at Ego.    Quill's eyes fill with cautious hope. And the SONG ENDS. \nEXT. BERHERT - MOMENTS LATER \nEgo's ship rises, blocking out the sun. \nFour moons shine over the forest. The campfire CRACKLES beside the Milano, and \"SOUTHERN NIGHTS\" BY GLENN CAMPBELL emerges from the cassette player within. \nThe Monstrous Ravager and Kraglin lead a group of Ravagers up over a ravine. Dozens of M-Ships quietly lower behind them. Kraglin nods toward the sounds of Glenn Campbell in the distance. They raise their weapons. \nOVERHEAD SHOT: dozens and dozens of Ravagers come from different directions, surrounding the Milano. \nOne Ravager cluster, lead by Half-Nut, CREEPS close enough to the Milano that they see the lights within the vehicle and can hear Rocket inside HUMMING along to the song. \nHalf-Nut licks his lips in anticipation, closing in for the kill, when he steps on a small pedal. It CLICKS. \nA HUNDRED DARTS FLY AT THE GROUP from traps set in trees. They STICK INTO THE RAVAGERS' BODIES, knocking them instantly unconscious. As one Ravager FALLS, a GUNSHOT is discharged. \nINT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT \nNebula is awakened by the SHOT. She sees a frightened Groot, peering through a hole at the bodies falling. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL, beside him, a futuristic walkie-talkie with ROCKET'S HUMS emerging. \nEXT. CRASHED MILANO - PERCUSSIVE BOMB TRAP - NIGHT \nRocket is crouched on a limb in shadows above the Milano, smiling and HUMMING to \"Southern Nights\" into his comm. \nHe spots A LARGER GROUP OF RAVAGERS APPROACHING THE MILANO from the other side, led by Retch. \nRocket LEAPS TOWARD THEM, from one tree limb to another like a squirrel. \nThe GROUP enters a clearing close to the ship. A TALL RAVAGER looks up and spots Rocket LEAPING OVER THEIR HEADS. \nTALL RAVAGER There! \nThe Ravagers BLAST at Rocket, following him. He HOPS from tree to tree as BULLETS WHIZZ PAST HIM, leading them right where he wants them. \nHe stops in a tree at the end of the run.   He holds a device with two buttons. He presses one of them. \nA PERCUSSIVE BOMB at the feet of the Ravagers BURSTS, sending half of them FLYING UP into the air. \nAs the confused group on the ground watches, Rocket presses the second button and a second BOMB BURSTS. They FLY UP INTO THE AIR as well. \nRocket SNICKERS, as he continues pushes the buttons and the two groups of Ravagers FLY UP and DOWN until the bombs are depleted of energy. \nRetch looks up from the ground, to see the little animal hopping away in the tree limbs overhead. \nEXT. CRASHED MILANO - STICKY DISK TRAP - NIGHT \nAn EVEN LARGER GROUP OF RAVAGERS walk beneath the branches, MOONLIGHT FLICKERING ON THEIR FACES. \nTILT UP TO REVEAL ROCKET'S SILHOUETTE on a gnarled limb. He's clutching an armful of small discs. He breathes shallowly, waits. As soon as the last Ravager is passing beneath him, he LEAPS onto his back. \nRocket JUMPS FORWARD FROM ONE MAN TO THE NEXT, SLAPPING A STICKY-DISC to each of their heads - SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! \nAnd then he LEAPS from the Ravager at the front of the line BACK UP INTO THE TREES. \nThe men are confused. They bring their fingers to the sticky discs on their bodies. \nRocket smiles in the tree as he flicks a trigger. The STICKY- DISCS SEND ELECTRICITY COURSING THROUGH ALL OF THE MEN'S BODIES. \nThey CONVULSE for a moment, then COLLAPSE. \nEXT. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - NIGHT \nRocket LEAPS to the ground in a crouch. He sees Brahl approaching in front of him, and then another RAVAGER approaching from behind. They train their weapons on him. \nBRAHL Ain't so tough now without all your toys, are you? \nRocket LEAPS up onto Brahl's face. \nHe PUNCHES HIM IN THE THORAX so hard he can't breathe. \nThe other Ravager SHOOTS at him, but Rocket BACKFLIPS over the SHOT so Brahl is STRUCK instead. \nRocket LANDS on the back of the shooter's neck and RAPID-FIRE PUNCHES HIM in the head, until the man CRUMPLES to the ground, unconscious. \nAs Rocket lands, he HEARS WHISTLING and he looks up to see -- \nYONDU'S ARROW FLYING THROUGH THE TREES, DIRECTLY TOWARD HIM. \nROCKET Crap. \nAnother high-pitched WHISTLE and the arrow STOPS ABRUPTLY, FLOATING with the tip almost grazing Rocket's forehead. \nYondu waltzes out of the trees with Tullk, Kraglin, the Monstrous Ravager, and many more. \nRocket reluctantly raises his hands in surrender. \nYONDU Hey there, rat. \nROCKET How's it going, you blue idiot? \nYONDU Eh, not so bad. We got a pretty good gig. A golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals to her, so she can kill y'all. \nINT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT \nNebula looks out the window to see even more Ravagers surrounding Rocket. She looks at baby Groot. \nNEBULA Your friend. There's too many of them. They're going to kill him. \nGroot looks as if he's about to cry. \nNEBULA (CONT'D) He needs my help. If you care about him, you need to get me out of these bonds. \nGroot is unsure. \nEXT. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - NIGHT \nThe Ravagers have entirely encircled Rocket. There's no chance of escape. Though upset, he mostly holds it in. \nYONDU Pretty easy to find you, since we put a tracer on your ship back during the War over Xandar. \nROCKET You give me your word you won't hurt Groot, and I'll tell you where the batteries are. \nYONDU Lucky for you my word don't mean squat. Otherwise I'd actually hand you over. \nMONSTROUS RAVAGER Otherwise you'd what?! \nYondu scowls at the Monstrous Ravager. \nDRAX When was I that tiny? \nGamora shakes her head in disbelief. They step past the statue and onto the steps approaching the palace. \nGAMORA You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit. What are you, exactly? \nEGO I'm what they call a Celestial, sweetheart. \nThe Guardians STOP behind him, astounded. \nQUILL A Celestial. Like a... god? \nEGO Small `g', son. At least on the days I'm feeling humble as Drax. \nHe LAUGHS and walks up the stairs. \nINT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER \nEgo SAUNTERS with Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis, through the enormous open doors, toward huge DIORAMAS lining either side of the palace, like cosmic Stations of the Cross. \nEGO This form you see before you is only an extension of who I truly am. I don't know where I came from, exactly. \nThe DIORAMAS around them begin to ANIMATE: In the first, a FLICKERING BRAIN COMPOSED OF POLYCHROMATIC LIGHT FLOATS in space. \nEGO (CONT'D) The first thing I remember is flickering, adrift in the cosmos - utterly and entirely alone. \nThe flickering brain pulls cosmic dust and rocks into itself, ingesting them, GROWING. \nEGO (CONT'D) I fed on the matter around me like plankton. I grew smarter and stronger. \nA hard metal shell forms around the brain, with channels running through for his energy to flow like rivers. \nEGO (CONT'D) I formed a sheathe to protect myself from the elements. \nEgo continues developing outward from the shell, growing the planet, then its beautiful landscapes and structures. \nEGO (CONT'D) And continued building from there, layer by layer, the very planet you walk on now. I built the spires reaching up to the sky and the tunnels burrowing into its depths. \nQUILL Wow. \nEGO But I was no ant to be fulfilled solely by labor. I wanted more. I desired... meaning. \nIn the core shell - the Self Chamber - the flickering brain floats, alone, perhaps sad. \nEGO (CONT'D) There must be some life out there in the universe besides just me, I thought, and I set myself to task with finding it. \nThe brain grows a SKELETAL FRAMEWORK OF LIGHT up from the self chamber and to the surface of the planet. He pulls molecules around this shape to create his \"human\" self. \nEGO (CONT'D) I created what I imagined biological life might be like, down to the most minute detail. \nDRAX Did you make a penis? \nQUILL Dude. \nDRAX If he's a planet, how did he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her. \nQUILL I don't need to hear about how my parents, you know - \nDRAX Why? My father would tell me the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice. \nQUILL That's disgusting. \nDRAX It was beautiful. You earthers have hang-ups. \nEGO Yes, Drax, I've got a penis. \nQUILL Oh my God. \nEGO It's not half bad. I've also got pain receptors, a digestive system, and all the accompanying junk. I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human as I set out amongst the stars. \nIn another DIORAMA, Ego explores various uninhabited and barren planets. \nEGO (CONT'D) I visited thousands of planets over thousands of years, one barren husk after the next until I found what I sought... \nEgo stares down at a CUTE ALIEN CHILD. \nEGO (CONT'D) Life. I was not alone in this universe after all. \nEgo reminisces: wistful? Sad? It's hard to tell. \nQUILL When did you meet my mother? \nEGO Not long after. \nEgo turns toward the last set of DIORAMAS. They show Meredith and Ego kissing and Ego with his hand on Meredith's pregnant belly. \nEGO (CONT'D) It was with Meredith that I experienced love for the first time. I called her my river lily. And from that love, Peter, you. \nIn the final DIORAMA we PUSH IN on the belly and see, inside the womb, VERY young Peter Quill, a fetus, himself encased in light. \nQuill looks up in amazement - this story is the story of himself. And Ego gazes at Quill with adoration. \nEGO (CONT'D) I searched for you for so long. When I heard a man from earth held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying, I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved. \nEgo puts his hand on Quill. Quill wants to believe, but he can't quite let it go. \nQUILL If you loved her why did you leave her? \nEXT. THE ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE \nThe Ravagers' massive ship FLOATS in space. \nSUPER: RAVAGER TERRITORY HE2 6SM6R16617+6241023 \nTULLK (O.S.) You can't do this! \nINT. ECLECTOR CENTRAL AREA - OUTER SPACE \nRavagers LAUGH as they DRAG Tullk across the floor while he STRUGGLES to get free. \nTULLK This is mutiny! Mutiny! \nThey shove Tullk into a cylindrical room as a glass door CLOSES on him. \nHe continues SCREAMING and SLAMMING ON THE GLASS, but we can barely hear him. \nYONDU (CONT'D) I got an idea on how to get outta here. But we're gonna need your little friend. \nINT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nBaby Groot is wearing a tiny Ravager uniform. He reacts to clothes like a cat, struggling to take them off but unable. Ravagers are gathered around him, drunk and LAUGHING. They are CHANTING \"MASCOT.\" \nRETCH Lil' feller's all worked up! Needs a drank! \nRetch POURS ALCOHOL on him. The Ravagers LAUGH MORE as others POUR DRINKS on him as well. Groot SCREAMS at them, furious but helpless. \nRETCH (CONT'D) Lookit how cute it is when it's all riled up! \nHALF-NUT It's Goddang precious! \nINT. ECLECTOR CELL - LATER \nGroot, in shadows, MOPES down the hallway, looking traumatized. His clothes are torn and he's soaked in alcohol. \nAs he passes the cell, he hears - \nYONDU (O.S.) Hey, twig. C'mere. \nGroot sees Yondu and Rocket looking at him in the cell. He steps toward them. \nROCKET Oh, man. What'd they do to you? \nYONDU Hey, you wanna help us get outta here? \nGroot NODS.   Rocket looks unsure. Yondu speaks slowly. \nYONDU (CONT'D) There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me. \nGroot NODS. \nYONDU (CONT'D) In the Cap'n's quarters, there's a prototype fin, like the thing I wore on my head. \nGroot NODS. \nYONDU (CONT'D) There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's inside that. It's red. You got it? \nGroot NODS EMPHATICALLY and DARTS OFF to get it.   Yondu looks at Rocket, pleased. \nRocket looks more than a bit uncertain. \nINT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER \nBaby Groot CREEPS into this dark room.    DRUNKEN RAVAGERS are sprawled everywhere. \nHe spots a bureau.    A drawer is half open. \nHis face lights up. \nMOMENTS LATER \nBaby Groot stands outside of the cell, beaming, holding A PAIR OF SHORTS. \nYONDU That's my underwears. \nROCKET Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know what you were talking about. You have to explain it more careful. \nYONDU All right. It's a prototype fin - \nMOMENTS LATER \nGroot is back in front of the cell, holding a wriggling ORLONI in his hands. \nROCKET That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot. \nYONDU You explain it this time. \nRocket starts to speak - \nMOMENTS LATER \nGroot looks hopeful, holding out a CYBERNETIC EYE. \nYONDU That's Vorker's eye. He takes it out when he sleeps. Go look again. \nGroot starts to SLINK OFF - \nROCKET But leave the eye here. \nYONDU Why? \nRocket CAN HARDLY SPEAK he finds it so funny. \nROCKET He's gonna wake up tomorrow and he's not gonna know where his eye is! \nMOMENTS LATER \nGroot is DRAGGING a LARGE PIECE OF FURNITURE to the cell. \nROCKET That's a desk. We told you it was this big. \nRocket shows him how small it is with his hands. \nGroot makes a face like \"Oh!\" as if NOW he gets it. It's all coming together. \nMOMENTS LATER \nGroot is holding a SEVERED TOE. \nROCKET Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere with a bunch of severed human toes. \nYondu SUBTLY SHAKES HIS HEAD. \nROCKET (CONT'D) Okay, then let's just agree to never discuss this. \nYondu RIPS the Ravager patch off his jacket. \nYONDU The drawer you want to open. Has this symbol on it, okay? \nGroot takes it. He looks at Yondu and NODS. \nAnd then, slowly, HE PLACES IT ON TOP OF HIS HEAD. \nINT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nThe hoard of Ravagers hear Taserface's voice. \nTASERFACE (O.S.) HE'S GOT IT! YONDU'S GOT THE DAMN FIN! \nRETCH GO! \nSERIES OF SHOTS - INT. ALL OVER THE SHIP - OUTER SPACE \nALL OF THE RAVAGERS all over the ship, in a panic, LOAD THEIR WEAPONS and HEAD TOWARD THE CELL. \nINT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE \nYondu and Rocket and Groot COME AROUND THIS CORNER IN SLOW- MOTION, the three biggest badasses in the history of cinema. \nA HOARD OF RAVAGERS, led by Brahl, FILE IN at the end of the hallway. \nBut Yondu WHISTLES and the ARROW TWISTS QUICKLY BACK AND FORTH, SLICING THROUGH EACH OF THEM. \nYondu SLAMS through a door into - \nINT. ECLECTOR DOCKING BAY - OUTER SPACE \nOur heroes step onto a catwalk in this, the biggest space in the Eclector. There are catwalks throughout and dozens of docked M-ships. The SCURRILOUS RAVAGER sees them from above -- \nSCURRILOUS RAVAGER Down there! \nIN AN EXTREME WIDE ANGLE, we see the ARROW FLYING UP AND DOWN, BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS, CUTTING THROUGH ALL SORTS OF RAVAGERS, closer and further from CAMERA. \nWe TRAVEL BEHIND YONDU AND ROCKET as BODIES FALL AROUND THEM IN SLOW-MOTION LIKE FIREWORKS. \nGroot looks up and sees RETCH looking down at him. \nRETCH FLEES in terror as Groot GROWS branches to pull himself up behind him. \nGroot HOWLS FURIOUSLY, TAKING CHASE. \nRetch YOWLS like a child as he frantically runs. \nBut Groot GROWS HIS BRANCHES around RETCH's legs, TRIPPING HIM. \nBAM! He FALLS, face first to the floor. \nAnd, with a WAR CRY, Baby Groot FLINGS the sadistic Ravager off the edge towards the abyss below. \nAs RETCH FALLS past Yondu and Rocket, Baby Groot DROPS back down onto Rocket's shoulder, and they push their way through the doorway - \nINT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE \nYondu, Rocket, and Groot move into this area, where they look up at DOZENS OF SECURITY MONITORS encircling them showing Ravagers filing toward them from every part of the ship. \nYondu WHISTLES as he watches the MONITORS - \nON A MONITOR, the arrow FLIES out the wall. He whistles so that it strikes TWO RAVAGERS running towards them. \nIt ZIPS out of that room and \nINT. DARK HALL - OUTER SPACE \nA HOARD of Ravagers come running down a hall. The ARROW ZIPS overhead, smashing out all the lights so that the hall is completely dark, except for the DIM RED LIGHT OF THE ARROW. \nAnd we can just make out the RED LIGHT smashing through the body of every Ravager there and then on into -- \nINT. SPACEPORT - OUTER SPACE \nA YELLING CROWD OF RAVAGERS come, hungry for war, when the arrow SHOOTS THROUGH THE CHAINS holding a giant spaceship in place over their heads. \nIt FALLS, instantly CRUSHING them all, and then zips on -- \nINT. BAR - OUTER SPACE \nGef the Ravager is drunkenly drinking a mug of beer, when the arrow zips past him and through the mug, SHATTERING it. \nAs Gef looks at the shattered mug, confused, the arrow comes flying back, ripping through Gef himself, FLINGING him off the bar stool. \nINT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE \nRocket also uses the MONITORS to pinpoint where their attackers are. He methodically SHOOTS THROUGH the walls, striking the Ravagers as they get closer. \nWIDE OVERHEAD SHOT, the CAMERA REVOLVES as hoards of Ravagers GET CLOSE to Yondu and Rocket but the arrow and gunshots ZIP THROUGH THE WALLS taking them all down, one by one, like Busby Berkely gone mad. \nThen Yondu stops, seeing something on one of the MONITORS. \nTaserface, clutching a big ass gun, is marching down the hall towards them. \nYondu WHISTLES, loudly and angrily. \nINTERCUT - INT. ENGINE ROOM/SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE \nTaserface sees THE ARROW COMING AROUND A CORNER TOWARDS HIM. \nYondu WHISTLES again. \nThe ARROW BURSTS INTO FLAMES. \nTaserface DODGES it. \nHe turns to watch it go, CACKLING pridefully over his agility. \nBut his smile quickly dissipates. \nThe arrow PLUNGES into a giant tank - which EXPLODES, ENGULFING HIM. \nEXT. ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE \nA huge portion of the giant spacecraft EXPLODES, leading to a domino effect of one part of the ship BURSTING after another. \nINT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE \nROCKET is dumbfounded as he sees on the MONITORS the numerous EXPLOSIONS throughout the ship. \nROCKET You maniac. The whole ship is gonna blow. \nINT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE \nQUILL (CONT'D) Drax thinks you're not a dancer. \nGAMORA If you ever tell anyone about this, I'll kill you. \nThey look at each other. \nQUILL When are we going to do something about this... unspoken thing between us? \nGAMORA What unspoken thing? \nQUILL THIS CHEERS-SAM-AND-DIANE-GUY-AND- GIRL-ON-A-TV-SHOW-WHO-DIG-EACH- OTHER-BUT-NEVER-SAY-IT-'CAUSE-WHEN- THEY-DO-THE-RATINGS-WOULD-GO-DOWN sort of thing? \nGAMORA There is no unspoken thing between us. \nQUILL Well, that's a Catch-22. Because if you said there was, it would be spoken, and then you'd be a liar. So by saying there isn't, you're telling the truth, and admitting there is. \nGAMORA That's not -- \nGamora PULLS AWAY. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) What we should be discussing right now is that something about this place doesn't feel right. \nQUILL What are you talking about? You were the one who wanted me to come here! \nGamora moves into -- \nINT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - DAY \nGAMORA That girl, Mantis. She's afraid of something. \nQuill follows her.   He stops, staring at her, hurt and frustrated. \nQUILL Why are you trying to take this from me? \nGAMORA I'm not -- \nQUILL He's my father. He's blood - \nGAMORA You have blood on earth. You never wanted to return there. \nQUILL Again - you made me come here! And Earth?! Earth is the place my mother died in front of me. \nGAMORA No, it's because that's real, and this is a fantasy. \nQUILL This is real. I'm only half human, remember? \nGAMORA That's the half I'm worried about. \nQUILL Oh, I get it. You're jealous because I'm part god! You like me being the weak one! \nGamora adds some pieces to her transmitter. \nGAMORA Uh. You were insufferable to begin with. I haven't been able to reach Rocket. I'm going to see if I can get a signal outside. \nQUILL You know, this isn't Cheers after all. It's whatever the show is where one person is willing to, you know, open themselves up to new possibilities, and the other person is just kind of a jerk who doesn't trust anyone! It's a show that doesn't exist - it would never be made, it would be so horrible! It would get zero ratings! \nGAMORA You're having a conversation with yourself! I don't know what Cheers is! \nQUILL I finally found my family, don't you understand that!? \nGAMORA I thought you already had. \nQUILL So this is how it ends, then? Our whole story. Like this? You and me? \nGAMORA Get it through your head, Peter. There is no you and me. There never was. \nQuill watches her leave. \nEXT. EGO'S FIELDS - SUNSET \nGamora sits, alone in the fields, pouting, fuming.   She stops, staring angrily inward. \nTwo plants, nearby, flitter against one another in the wind, making a CLICKING sound. She side-eyes them. They don't stop. \nShe slices them off with her sword. \nGAMORA Dammit. \nGamora hears something. She turns to see, in the distance, an M-ship flying toward the planet. \nShe watches as it gets closer and closer, and realizes it is FLYING DIRECTLY AT HER. \nGamora RUNS. \nINT. NEBULA'S SHIP - SUNSET \nNebula HOLLERS as she BLASTS HER GUNS, DIVING towards Gamora. \nEXT. HILLSIDE - SUNSET \nGamora FLEES from Nebula's ship like Cary Grant from the crop duster in North by Northwest as HUGE CHUNKS OF LAND EXPLODE on either side of her. \nGamora leaps into a DITCH, LANDING HARD, as the M-Ship SWOOPS just a couple feet above her. \nGAMORA You psychopath. \nGamora sees the M-Ship banking and FLYING BACK at her again. \nShe stands and runs along the hillside as GUN BLASTS burst behind her. But Gamora sees a CAVERN, leading down into the earth. \nShe DARTS into it. \nINT. EGO'S CAVERN - FIRST/SECOND LEVELS - SUNSET \nAs Gamora RUNS down the cavern, she glances back over her shoulder where Nebula, insane with rage, continues FLYING towards her -- \nThe M-SHIP ENTERS THE CAVERN, which is too small for it, CLIPPING ITS WINGS - but it keeps flying. It again BLASTS at Gamora as she FLEES - \nThe BLASTS cause the ground to COLLAPSE around Gamora, and she FALLS, SMASHING DOWN THROUGH ONE LEVEL, to another level below, SLAMMING HARD on the ground. \nThe underside of the M-ship gets SCRAPED APART as it flies above her, and pieces of it come RAINING DOWN around her. \nNebula ZOOMS towards a huge cavern wall.   She tries to turn her ship in time, to no avail. \nShe SIDESWIPES it, falling down, CRASHING on the ground, where she is now on the same level as Gamora. \nQUILL Well, you might not be mortal, but ME - \nEGO Death will remain a stranger to both of us as long as the light burns within the planet. \nEgo smiles. \nQUILL I'm immortal? That's... really? \nEGO Yes, as long as the light exists. \nQUILL And I can use the light to make cool things? Like how you made all this? \nEGO It'll take thousands of years of practice before you get really good at it . But, yes. \nQUILL Well, get ready for an eight hundred foot statue of Pac Man, then. With Skeletor. And Heather Locklear. I'm gonna make some weird shit. \nEgo puts his arm around him, smiles kindly. \nEGO I can't wait to see your weird shit. \nQUILL Wow, that... \nEGO Came out a little disgusting. \nThey CHUCKLE. \nEGO (CONT'D) It is a tremendous responsibility, Peter. Only we can remake the universe. Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos and lead it where it needs to go. \nQUILL How? \nEgo holds up his fingers, letting forth a flame of white cosmic light. Quill holds up his fingers, letting forth a smaller, less intense flame of white cosmic light. \nREVEAL MANTIS, IN THE HALL, around the corner, looking at Ego and Quill and the light emanating from their fingers. \nEGO Come with me. \nMantis looks like she's having a panic attack. \nINT. DRAX'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER \nCLOSE-UP OF DRAX, sound asleep. \nMANTIS (O.S.) Drax! Drax! \nHe WAKES to see a panicked Mantis sitting on the bed beside him. \nMANTIS (CONT'D) Drax, we need to talk - \nDRAX Ugh. I am sorry, but I like a woman with some meat on her bones. \nMANTIS What? \nDRAX I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting. \nMANTIS No! That's not what I - \nDrax starts to GAG. \nMANTIS (CONT'D) What are you doing?! \nDRAX I'm imagining being with you physically! \nMANTIS Drax, that's not - I don't like you like that. I don't even like the type of thing you are. \nDRAX (OFFENDED) Hey! There's no need to get personal! \nMANTIS Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted. I should have told you earlier, I am stupid. You are in danger. \nEXT. NEBULA'S SQUASHED M-SHIP - NIGHT \nGamora and Nebula still sit here, quietly and awkwardly. Gamora glances down a twisting tunnel, where phosphorescent lights shine brightly. \nGAMORA What's that? \nShe moves towards it.   Nebula, hesitantly, follows. \nINT. PALACE - NIGHT \nEgo and Quill enter the palace. \nEGO You need to readjust the way you process life. Everything around us - including the girl - is temporary. We are forever. \nQUILL Doesn't eternity get boring? \nEGO Not if you have a purpose, Peter. Which is why you're here. I told you how all those years ago I had an unceasing impulse to find life. \nEgo is standing underneath the diorama of him facing the little alien girl. \nEGO (CONT'D) I didn't tell you how when I did find it, it was all so... disappointing. \nINT. TWISTING CAVERNS - NIGHT \nGamora and Nebula move further down the cavern, stepping into light, getting closer. \nEGO And that is when I came to a profound realization. \nINT. PALACE - NIGHT \nEGO My innate desire to seek out other life was not so that I could walk among that life. \nEgo looks at his son, moved by the memories. \nEGO (CONT'D) Peter, I had found meaning. \nQuill is taken aback. But Ego sets his finger lightly on his forehead, and the white light bursts through his son's body. \nWe see THE COSMOS IN QUILL'S EYES. He looks ecstatic, far beyond where he stands, and seems to finally understand. \nQUILL I see it. Eternity. \nINT. TWISTING CAVERNS - NIGHT \nGamora and Nebula stop, in horror. \nGAMORA Oh my God. \nMANTIS The bodies are his children. \nGamora is horrified. \nINT. PALACE - NIGHT \nOn the DIORAMAS we see Ego with hundreds of species of female aliens. \nEGO Out of all my labors the most beguiling was attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species. I hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough to power the expansion. \nINT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - NIGHT \nYondu and Rocket walk here. \nEGO (O.S.) I had Yondu deliver some of them to me. It broke the Ravager code - but I compensated him generously. And, to ease his conscience, I told him I would never hurt them. \nINT. PALACE - NIGHT \nEGO That was true. They never felt a thing. But, one after the other, they failed me. None of them had the Celestial genes. Until you, Peter. Out of all my spawn, only you have carried the connection to the light. \nPeter smiles, an enchanted idiot, the cosmos in his eyes. \nINT. DRAX'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT \nGAMORA We need to find Peter now and get off this damn planet. \nMANTIS Ego will have won him to his side by now. He has a way of - \nNEBULA Then we just go. \nGAMORA No. He's our friend. \nNEBULA All any of you do is yell at each other. You're not friends. \nDRAX You're right. We're family. We leave no one behind. (TO NEBULA) Except maybe you. \nNEBULA Oh my god. \nINT. PALACE - NIGHT \nEGO For the first time in my life, I am truly not alone. \nQuill suddenly looks sad. \nEGO (CONT'D) What is it, son? \nQUILL My friends. \nEGO That's the mortal in you, Peter. \nQUILL Yes. I don't need that. \nEGO What are we? \nQUILL Forever. \nEGO What are they? \nQUILL Temporary. \nEGO You think you love them. But love is merely an evolutionary trick in the service of reproduction. We are beyond such things. \nQUILL Yes. \nEGO NOW - \nQUILL But my mother. \nEgo looks at him, questioningly. \nQUILL (CONT'D) You said you loved my mother. \nEGO That I did. My river lily, who knew the words to every song that came on the radio. I returned to earth to see her three times. I knew if I came back a fourth, I'd never leave. (MORE) \nEGO (CONT'D) The expansion, the reason for my very existence would be over. So I did what I had to do. But it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head. \nQUILL Wh- what? \nZOLLY IN ON QUILL as the cosmos disappear from his eyes. Tears stream down his face. \nEGO I know that sounds bad - \nQUILL PULLS OUT HIS PISTOLS AND FIRES; THE BLAST TEARS THROUGH EGO, DISPERSING the MOLECULES forming his body. \nQuill SHOOTS at him AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. The flesh disappears from Ego like bites from a cookie, exposing the angry alien skeletal form beneath. \nBut, as the charge on Peter's blasters wears out, Ego just looks at him, and, although he's filled with holes, he's merely disappointed. \nEGO (CONT'D) Who in the hell do you think you are? \nQUILL You killed my mother! \nEGO TRANSFORMS into DAVID HASSELHOFF. \nEGO I tried so hard to find the form that best suited you, and this is the thanks I get? \nAnd then, once again, BECOMES HIS USUAL FORM. \nEGO (CONT'D) You really need to grow up. \nA SPIKY COSMIC LIGHT-PROPELLED TENDRIL SHOOTS UP from the floor behind Quill, and JUTS into Quill's body. \nQuill is THRUST INTO THE AIR.   He opens his mouth to SCREAM and WHITE LIGHT EMITS. \nEGO (CONT'D) I wanted to do this together! But I suppose you'll have to learn by spending the next thousand years as a battery, `Star-Lord'. \nINT. DRAX'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT \nTHROUGH THE WINDOW to the PALACE - PAN TO Gamora watching as her TRANSMITTER - the one she was trying to contact Rocket on - BEEPS. She answers. \nGAMORA Rocket?! \nGamora follows Drax, Nebula, and a confused Mantis as they move out. \nINT. LASER DRILL - OUTER SPACE \nDRAX What are you doing? You could have killed us all crashing in here like that! \nROCKET Uh, `Thank you, Rocket'? \nDRAX We had it under control. \nMANTIS We did not. That is only an extension of his true self. He will be back soon. \nQUILL (RE: NEBULA) What's Smurfette doing here!? \nNEBULA Back rubs, dishes, killing gods, whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home. \nROCKET She tried to murder me! \nNEBULA I saved you, you stupid fox. \nGAMORA He's not a fox. \nGROOT I am Groot. \nROCKET I'm not a raboon either! \nGROOT I am Groot. \nROCKET `Raccoon,' whatever! \nDrax looks out the window. \nINT. PALACE - NIGHT \nTENTACLE-LIKE STRANDS BURST UP through the palace flooring all around the drill. \nINT. PALACE - NIGHT \nDrax turns to the others. \nDRAX How do we kill a Celestial? \nQUILL There's the center to him - his brain, his soul, whatever it is, in some sort of shell -- \nMANTIS It's in the caverns below the surface. \nQuill climbs up the ladder to see - \nQUILL YONDU? \nNebula looks at Gamora. \nNEBULA If he's got that fin back, I am so screwed. \nI/E. PALACE - SUNRISE \nYondu THRUSTS the ship upward for takeoff.   But TENTACLES wrap around the ship -- \nAnd YANK IT BACK DOWN into the floor, destroying the foundation of the palce. \nTHE ENTIRE PALACE SLOPES. \nINT. LASER DRILL - SUNRISE \nEveryone FALLS forward. \nYONDU Thrusters are out! \nQuill starts rewiring the mechanics. \nQUILL I guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid. Otherwise you would have delivered me to this maniac! \nYONDU You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?! \nQUILL That's what you told me, you old doofus! \nYONDU Once I figured out what happened to them other kids, I wasn't gonna just hand you over. \nQUILL You said you were gonna eat me! \nYONDU That was being funny! \nQUILL Not to me!! \nROCKET You people have issues. \nQuill sees THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD where EGO'S CREEPY SKELETAL is GROWING IN FRONT OF THEM. \nQUILL Of course I have issues that's my fricking father!!... Thrusters are back up. \nQuill thrusts the ship FORWARD instead of up. \nIt CRASHES through Ego and DOWN THE SLOPING FLOOR -- \nAnd OUT THROUGH the giant pane of glass at the end. \nI/E. LASER DRILL/CRACK IN THE PLANET - SUNRISE \nEveryone holds on in what's essentially the worst roller coaster drop ever. \nYONDU We should be going up! \nQUILL We can't. Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it. We have to kill him. \nThey PLUMMET toward a fissure in the earth below.   It's too small for the ship. \nQUILL (CONT'D) Rocket! \nROCKET Got it. \nRocket BLASTS the lasers perfectly, CHIPPING AWAY PIECES of rock, forming an opening in the crack. \nThey SMASH into the opening, barely fitting, leading down into the planet. \nQuill flies perfectly, TWISTING through tunnels and around corners. \nRocket mans the lasers, BLASTING PIECES OUT OF PLACE just in time so they can SCRAPE through. \nROCKET (CONT'D) So, we're saving the galaxy again? \nQUILL We drill into the center, we kill him. \nQuill holds tight to the steering wheel. Yondu notices the BLINKING LIGHT on the comm. He taps it. \nYONDU What is it, Kraglin? \nKRAGLIN (O.S.) Um, remember that Ayesha chick? \nYONDU Yeah, why? \nYondu looks out the window where AYESHA'S SQUADRON is SWOOPING OUT OF the cracks in the ceiling all around them. \nYONDU (CONT'D) Aw, hell. \nQuill PULLS AWAY from the envoys. \nBut the Sovereign envoys start BLASTING AT THE CRAFT all at once; the LASER LOSES POWER and the VEHICLE TURNS SIDEWAYS - \nDrax, Mantis, and Gamora GO TUMBLING from the hole in the side. Nebula and Groot grab onto the floor. \nINT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nGamora, Drax, and Mantis FALL from an incredible height. They LAND - ONE, TWO, THREE - WITH APLOMB. \nGamora looks up and sees the Laser Drill CURL behind the Self Chamber as it tries to avoid the envoys' BLASTERS. \nINT. SELF CHAMBER/LASER DRILL - DAY \nNebula and Groot settle as the ship rights itself and BLASTS PIERCE the ship around them. \nQuill peers down at Rocket, who has jumped out of his seat and is pouring out the contents of his satchel. \nQUILL Why aren't you firing the laser?! \nROCKET They blew out the generator! I think I packed a small detonator. \nNEBULA A detonator is worthless without explosives! \nROCKET We got these! \nRocket shows Nebula the Anulax batteries. \nQuill leaves the controls to Yondu as he CLIMBS down beside Rocket, now messing with wiring on his BOMB. \nQUILL Is it strong enough to kill Ego? \nROCKET If it is, it will cause a chain reaction throughout his entire nervous system. \nQUILL Meaning what? \nROCKET The entire planet will explode. We'll have to get out of here fast. I rigged a timer. \nRocket stuffs the bomb back in his satchel.   Groot climbs on his back. \nRocket and Quill slap on their AERO RIGS. \nQUILL Go! \nThe run and jump out of the laser drill, FLYING ON THEIR AERO RIGS, avoiding the GUNFIRE. \nThe ZOOM towards the blast hole on the side of the self chamber. \nINT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY \nRocket and Quill land here, messily, TUMBLING. \nINT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nMantis is worried about something else entirely; the entire chasm begins TREMBLING and the walls start to MUTATE. \nMANTIS He's coming. \nDRAX Didn't you say you could make him sleep? \nMANTIS When he wants! He's too powerful! I can't! \nDRAX You don't have to believe in yourself because I believe in you. \nThey look ahead. They see, on the enormous wall in front of them, the LIGHT-FORM of a giant EGO SCREAMING ANGRILY. \nHis SCREAM becomes a TUNNEL OF ROCKS RUSHING TOWARDS THEM like a train. \nMantis sees a nerve bundle on the ground coming from Ego's Core. Although afraid, she grabs it. \nMANTIS SLEEP! \nShe SCREAMS with effort and some pain as energy travels through the bundle and into the core, where it darkens. \nThe LIGHT LEAVES THE ROCK FORMATION and it SLAMS into the ground in front of them, SPLASHING DIRT OVER THEM. \nBut they are safe, shivering. Drax and Gamora look at each other. \nDRAX I never thought she'd be able to do it. With as skinny and weak as she appears to be. \nMantis's arm is TREMBLING. \nMANTIS I don't know how long I can hold him! \nGAMORA You need to, girl. If you don't keep Ego at bay, we all die. \nINT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY \nRocket shines a powerful PEN-LIGHT inside the cavity, exposing the interior, spattered with Swiss-cheese-like holes glowing with light. \nROCKET The metal is too thick! For the bomb to work we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core. And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes. \nQUILL Well... \nQuill slowly eyes Groot, who is playing with a leaf on his arm and thinking about something else entirely. \nROCKET That's a terrible idea. \nQUILL Which is the only kind of idea we got left. \nRocket SIGHS. He puts Groot on his back and MOVES with Groot deeper into the blast hole, mumbling to himself: \nYondu flips ALL the switches; ALL THE POWER RUNS PAINFULLY OUT OF NEBULA'S BODY INTO THE VEHICLE -- \nAND THE LASERS BEAM OUT OF THE SHIP IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE, like a dangerous disco ball, slicing through almost nearly every single ENVOY. \nINT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nA BEAM ALMOST HITS Drax, but he LEAPS out of the way. Smoke rises from a hole in the ground between him and Mantis. \nDRAX Hey! \nINT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY \nWith flair, Yondu spins the pilot's wheel, so that the whole rig REVOLVES. \nAyesha looks on, in horror as the BEAMS SLICE THROUGH the remaining CRAFT - and one is COMING HER WAY. \nAYESHA (ON SHIP) NO!! \nAYESHA'S ENVOY IS RIPPED APART. \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nAyesha SITS BACK. She looks around her at the other pods: all of them are down. \nAYESHA NO! NOOOOO!! \nINT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY \nQuill sees FLAMING CHUNKS FLY into the rig... \nAnd FIRE SPILLING toward the ship's engine, dripping fuel. \nQUILL We're gonna blow! \nYondu WHISTLES as the FLAMES HIT THE FUEL - \nINT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nGamora watches as the ENTIRE LASER DRILL EXPLODES.   She is stricken. \nGAMORA Peter? \nShe sees a tiny body flying from the ship - it's Nebula, who LANDS across from her on her feet. \nGamora looks at her, worried. Nebula gives her what might be a little smile, and looks upward. Gamora follows her line of sight. \nQuill is FLYING FROM THE EXPLOSION on his aero-rig. Yondu is holding onto a flying arrow: his one arm up straight, his heels touching. Quill looks at him and SNICKERS. \nYONDU What? \nQUILL You look like Mary Poppins. \nYONDU Is he cool? \nQuill looks at the man who raised him. He smiles. \nQUILL Yeah. He's cool. \nYondu looks out at the Guardians as he comes in for a landing. \nYONDU I'm Mary Poppins, y'all! \nQuill and Yondu LAND beside Nebula. Gamora sees Quill and MARCHES TOWARD HIM. \nThe CAMERA CIRCLES GAMORA AND QUILL, FIERY SHIP FRAGMENTS RAINING DOWN AROUND THEM IN SLOW-MOTION, as if this is the greatest heavy metal video of all time. \nThe other Guardians enter, one by one - Nebula, Drax, Yondu, Rocket FLYING DOWN on his aero-rig, and finally, Mantis, staring forward with concentration until -- \nA HUGE CHUNK OF SPACESHIP FLIES IN FROM THE SIDE, FLATTENING MANTIS. The others all look down at her in shock. \nQUILL Oh. Wow. \nMantis, UNCONSCIOUS BENEATH a ship fragment, has lost hold of Ego. \nTHE ENTIRE HOLLOW AROUND THEM BEGINS TO RUMBLE.   THE GROUND AND WALLS THEMSELVES SHIFT and WAVER. \nThe whole cavity is alive. Drax checks on Mantis. \nDRAX She's just unconscious. \nINT. SELF CHAMBER TUNNELS - DAY \nGroot RUNS and HOPS through the tunnels. He comes to a crossroads. \nHe sees a COSMIC LIGHT emanating from one tunnel.   He dashes off toward it. \nINT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nQUILL How long before the bomb goes off? \nROCKET In the unlikely event Groot doesn't kill us all, about six minutes. \nYondu speaks into the comm on his lapel. \nYONDU Kraglin. \nINT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY \nKraglin, NODDING OUT, abruptly wakes. \nYONDU (O.S.) We need the Quadrant for extraction in T-minus five minutes. \nKRAGLIN Aye, Cap'n! \nEXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nOur heroes peer up to see the SURFACE OF THE PLANET UNFOLDING ABOVE THEM, so that THE BRIGHT SKY SHINES THROUGH. \nQUILL Someone needs to be up top when Kraglin arrives. Drax, take Mantis. \nDrax nods. He picks up Mantis. Quill grabs the aero-rig off himself and SLAPS it on Drax's back, which AUTOMATICALLY WRAPS around his upper body. \nDRAX Ahhh! My nipples! \nHe FLIES UPWARD. \nAnd once again, the LIGHT TENDRILS STAB THROUGH QUILL'S BACK, thrusting him to his knees. \nSmaller light tendrils stab into his face and body. \nAnd we see the LIGHT being sucked out of Quill and up into the Self Chamber once more as it BURSTS WITH LIGHT. \nEARTH - EXT. STREET - DAY \nPOLICE OFFICERS and bystanders are in the streets, snapping phone photos, etc, beside the HUGE, STILL SWATCH OF EGO'S LIFEFORM. \nOFFICER FITZGIBBON Please, everyone. Step back. I need you all to clear the - \nWEIRD OLD MAN What is that? \nThe LIFEFORM ALIGHTS WITH ENERGY and MOVES again, SPILLING INCREDIBLY QUICKLY towards them. \nPeople abandon their cars in traffic as it RUNS OVER THEM. \nA WOMAN FALLS. People TRAMPLE around her. \nBut an old man's hands reach in, helping her up. \nREVEAL GRANDPA QUILL, in his 70's or 80's now. \nGRANDPA QUILL Come on, ma'am. \nHe HELPS the woman into an SUV. \nHe SLAMS on the gas, SCREECHING AWAY from the enormous tidal wave of organic light. \nXANDAR - I/E. STARBLASTER/CITY - DAY \nEGO'S LIFEFORM smashes down the PARK WALLS and into the street. \nEGO (O.S) It doesn't need to be like this PETER \nEXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nEgo approaches his son. \nEGO Why are you destroying our chance?! \nAAKON - EXT. AAKON CITY - NIGHT \nAAKONS run from a giant wave behind them. \nEGO (O.S) Stop pretending you aren't, what you are! \nKREE HOMEWORLD - EXT. STEEP HILLSIDE - DAY \nKREE MONKS run from the cosmic flesh as it pours down the hillside behind them. \nBut it's too fast, RUSHING OVER THEM. \nPRIMITIVE PLANET - EXT. WETLANDS - DAY \nTHOUSANDS OF ORLONI are darting in fear across this dusty desert, as it WASHES OVER them. \nEGO (O.S) One in billions.. \nARAGO-7 - EXT. STONY LANDSCAPE - DAY \nTHREE HURCTARIANS run, SCREAMING. \nEGO (O.S) Trillions, even more! \nEASIK - EXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nAN EASIK MOTHER clutches her BABY, covering it with her own body, as the spreading lifeform LOOMS UP behind her. \nShe closes her eyes and waits for the worst. \nEXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nQuill looks up at Ego, barely able to focus, as the molecules form skin over the muscle and skeleton and innards beneath. \nEGO What greater meaning could life possibly have to offer?! \nYondu struggles beneath the tentacle beside Quill. \nYONDU I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy! I use my h - \nQuill hears this as the earth COVERS Yondu's face. \nQuill LOOKS INWARD. And suddenly, everything becomes... \nQUIET. \nTears come to Peter Quill's eyes as he remember those around him and what they mean to him. And we see his MEMORIES. \n- YOUNG PETER QUILL AND HIS MOTHER CUDDLED AND LISTENING TO MUSIC ON THE WALKMAN TOGETHER, EACH WITH ONE EAR PIECE. \n- QUILL AND DRAX LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ON THE MILANO. \n- GAMORA AND PETER LOOKING INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES AND DANCING ON KNOWHERE. \n- QUILL AND ROCKET FLYING THROUGH THE SKY ON AERO-RIGS FOR THE FIRST TIME, SMILING AS THE AIR RUSHES THROUGH THEIR HAIR. BABY GROOT CLUTCHES HAPPILY ONTO QUILL'S BACK. \n- YONDU AND YOUNG QUILL IN THE FOREST. YONDU'S ARM IS ON PETER'S ARM AS HE TEACHES HIM HOW TO SHOOT. \nQuill looks back up at Ego as we HEAR the gentle chords of FLEETWOOD MAC'S \"THE CHAIN\" starts echoing throughout the hollow. \nHe clutches his fist and we see the light growing within it. \nBits of earth begin to ROLL UP AND SCRAMBLE AND SWIRL around Quill's body, his arms, his legs, as if he's pulling them towards himself with magnets. \nAnd Ego looks confused, as the GROUND QUAKES AROUND HIM. \nQuill glares at his father, his voice distorting with Celestial thunder. \nQUILL You shouldn't have killed my mom and squished my walkman. \nAhd a SOLID TORNADO OF EARTH PROPELS QUILL FORWARD. Ego tries to protect himself as Quill SLAMS into him, FLYING UPWARDS WITH HIM -- \nQuill raises his fist, NOW A GIANT CLUB.   And he SMASHES Ego. \nKRAGLIN (CONT'D) It's called a Zune - what everyone listens to on earth nowadays. It's got three hundred songs. \nQuill nods, touched. \nQUILL Wait. \nQuill holds out Yondu's arrow.   Kraglin's lip trembles. \nQUILL (CONT'D) Rocket grabbed the pieces and reassembled them. I think Yondu would want you to have it. \nKRAGLIN Thank you... Cap'n. \nEXT. QUADRANT - OUTER SPACE \nYondu's SPARKLING ASHES ARE BLOWN OUT IN SPURTS FROM THE CREMATORY INTO SPACE. \nINT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nRocket, Drax, and Mantis are here, watching Yondu's ashes in the vacuum of space, SWIRLING almost magically. \nINT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE \nQuill sits down on the bed in Yondu's quarters.   He scrolls through selections on the Zune. \nHe comes to \"FATHER AND SON\" by CAT STEVENS. \nHe PRESSES PLAY. \nHe listens. As he does, Groot crawls up onto the bed, and then onto his lap. \nQuill offers him one of the ear buds. \nGroot holds it against his ear, amazed by the clarity of sound. Quill watches him, hearing the beauty of the song more through Groot's face than the music itself. \nAnd they sit there together, listening to the music, a new father and son. \nINT. M-SHIP - OUTER SPACE \nNebula FLIES AWAY, sad, perhaps regretful, but forcing her chin up to brace against what's to come. \nINT. QUADRANT SMALL HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE \nGamora watches, THROUGH A WINDOW, as Nebula leaves. \nINT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nRocket sees something by the ashes.   His eyes alight. \nROCKET They came. \nINT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE \nGroot sees COLORFUL FLASHING LIGHTS out of the window.   He pulls on Quill's shirt to show him. \nThey go to get a better view. \nINT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nDrax and Rocket see Yondu's COSMIC ASHES PULSING AND SWIRLING out in space as, one by one, enormous RAVAGER SHIPS arrive around them. \nThey each FLASH SPECIFIC LIGHT SEQUENCES - and, with all the ships together - it looks like fireworks. \nDRAX What is it? \nROCKET I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies and told them what he did. \nQuill comes up behind them with Groot, just as Gamora enters. Quill smiles. \nQUILL It's a Ravager funeral. \nINT. HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE \nKraglin sees it from here. He SCREAMS with joy, and he slams his fist twice against his chest, a Ravager salute. \nI/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 1 - OUTER SPACE \nSTAKAR and Martinex watch him there, moved. \nMARTINEX He didn't let us down after all, Cap'n. \nSTAKAR No, he did not, son. He did not. \nI/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 2 - OUTER SPACE \nCHARLIE-27, an enormous man, is wistful as he salutes. \nCHARLIE-27 Fare thee well, old friend. \nI/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 3 - OUTER SPACE \nALETA is here, tears in her eyes, alcohol in her hand, an ALL- FEMALE RAVAGER CREW around her. \nALETA See you in the stars, Yondu Udonta. \nINT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nAnd the Guardians all watch, enchanted by the majesty. \nROCKET He didn't chase `em away. \nQUILL No. \nROCKET Even though he yelled at `em. \nQuill shakes his head. \nROCKET (CONT'D) And was always mean. \nQuill shakes his head. \nROCKET (CONT'D) And he stole batteries he didn't need. \nQuill is surprised - what? And then he looks at Rocket, a little animal who doesn't know the rules of how to be any more than a young boy whose tribe sold him into slavery. \nQUILL Of course not. \n", "test1_input": "NEBULA I don't know. I thought it was stupid. \nGAMORA Yeah, it would be. \nNEBULA It's still wordy. \nGAMORA I wasn't the one who thought of it. \nNEBULA Your name doesn't matter. I'll be free of these shackles soon enough, and I'll kill you, I swear. \nGAMORA No. You'll live out your days in a prison on Xandar, wishing you could. \nWARNING LIGHTS FLASH. \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - MOMENTS LATER \nGamora MOVES UP from the stairs. Rocket and Quill are in the pilot seats. Drax is moving up from the back. \nQUILL We got an armed Sovereign fleet, approaching from the rear. \nGamora takes the center seat, sees a REARVIEW SCAN: \nGolden, capsule-shaped, Sovereign OMNICRAFT, with a video screen on front and a blaster on each side - getting closer. \nGAMORA Why would they do that?! \nDRAX Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries. \nQuill and Gamora look at Rocket, astounded.    Rocket gawks at Drax, betrayed. \nROCKET Dude. \nDRAX Oh, right. He didn't steal one of those. I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is. \nTHE SOVEREIGN FIRE UPON THE MILANO. \nQuill does his best to evade their blasts. \nQUILL What were you thinking?! \nROCKET Dude, it was really easy to steal. \nGAMORA That's your defense? \nROCKET Come on. You saw how that high- priestess talked down to us! I'm teaching her a lesson! \nQUILL Oh! I didn't realize your motivation was altruism. A shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions and are trying to kill us. \nROCKET Exactly. \nQUILL I WAS BEING SARCASTIC! \nROCKET Oh no! You tricked me! You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish! \nDrax points at Rocket and LAUGHS at him. \nQUILL SHUT UP, DRAX! You knew! You should have told us! \nDrax is aghast. He looks at Rocket. \nDRAX Did you tell him it was easy to steal? \nROCKET Are you kidding me? \nDRAX What? \nROCKET You never listen to anything! \nGAMORA None of you listens! Can we please just put the bickering on hold until after we survive the massive space battle?! \nRocket glances at Quill, nodding back at Gamora. \nROCKET Whoa. Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. \nQUILL Do not try to bro down with me right now, dude. I will fricking punch you in your fricking face. \nROCKET Real nice! Resorting to violence. \nQUILL More incoming! \nMORE SHIP FLY AT THEM from the front. \nROCKET GOOD! I WANT TO KILL SOME GUYS! \nThey twist and turn between the oncoming ships as ROCKET FIRES AT THEM, SCREAMING. They EXPLODE. \nOn the front of the Sovereign ships is the VIDEO IMAGE OF A PILOT. \nSOVEREIGN PILOT (ON SHIP) Bloody hell! \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nThe same SOVEREIGN PILOT sits in a REMOTE POD. On a SCREEN in front of her we see ROCKET FIRING. \nThe SHIP IS HIT and the SCREEN GOES STATIC. \nThe Pilot SHOUTS in anger, like a kid who lost at a video game. \nHigh Priestess Ayesha surveys from a walkway above; ROWS OF PODS containing PILOTS, all flying their Omnicraft remotely. \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK \nGAMORA You're not killing anyone. Those ships are all remotely piloted. \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nA SOVEREIGN ADMIRAL is beside Ayesha. \nAYESHA What is the delay, Admiral? \nADMIRAL High Priestess, if we destroy their craft, we risk destroying the batteries. They're extraordinarily combustible and could, in turn, destroy the entire fleet. \nAYESHA We have thousands of batteries and thousands of ships. Our concern is their slight against our people. We hired them and they steal from us? It is heresy of the highest order. \nThe Admiral speaks into his comm. \n", "test1_true": "A FRIGHTENED SOVEREIGN PILOT, on the outskirts of the battle, hears the Admiral in his headset. \nADMIRAL (O.S.) (CONT'D) Fire with the intent to kill. \nA MEAN SOVEREIGN PILOT, FIRING at the Milano, smirks. \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nTHE MILANO'S WING IS STRUCK.   The EMERGENCY SYSTEMS FLASH ON. \nQUILL What's the closest habitable planet? \nGamora dances her fingers over the UNIVERSAL NEURAL TELEPORTATION NETWORK, clicking through \"jump points\" until she finds one. \nGAMORA It's called Berhert. \nQUILL How many jumps? \nGAMORA Only one. But the access point is 47 clicks away. And it's through that Quantum Asteroid Field over there. \nQuill spots, to his side, a HUGE FIELD OF SMALL, GLOWING ASTEROIDS, SWIRLING IN RANDOM PATTERNS, DISAPPEARING OUT OF SPACE and EMERGING AGAIN a few feet or a few yards away. \nQuill ZOOMS SIDEWAYS toward the field. \nDRAX Quill, to make it through that, you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe. \nQuill smirks. \nQUILL Lucky for us - \nROCKET I am. \nRocket FLIPS the pilot controls between them so that he's the one piloting the ship. Quill gapes at him. \nThe Milano DIVES into the QUANTUM ASTEROID FIELD, SWOOPING in and around the SWIRLING ATOMIZED STONES, barely missing them. \nThe Sovereign ships FOLLOW. They are not pilots on par with Rocket, so most of the ships are immediately PELTED WITH STONES AND DESTROYED. \nINT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY \nOne after another the SOVEREIGN PILOTS screens go blank, and they FALL BACK, angry and upset. \nPUSH IN on Ayesha, barely containing her fury. \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nQuill FLIPS the controls back, so he's piloting again. \nROCKET What are you doing?! \nQUILL I've been flying this rig since I was ten years old. \nROCKET I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft! \nRocket FLIPS the controls back to him. \nQUILL You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag. \nQuill FLIPS the controls back to him. \nGAMORA Stop it! \nROCKET Quill, later on tonight you're gonna lay down in your bed and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillowcase and you're gonna be, like, `what's this?' and it's gonna be because I put a turd in there. \nRocket FLIPS the switch back. \nQUILL You put your turd in my bed, I shave you. \nROCKET Oh it won't be my turd, it will be Drax's. \nDrax LAUGHS cheerfully. Gamora glances at him. He explains: \nDRAX I have famously huge turds. \nGAMORA We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing? \nDRAX They raise havoc with the pipes. That's why I do all the plumbing. I take responsibility for my actions. Unlike some people... \nDrax eyes baby Groot. \nQUILL Groot, he's right, you have to start aiming inside the box. \nGroot looks ashamed. Quill FLIPS the controls back. \nGAMORA Stop it. \nRocket SWITCHES it back. Quill SWITCHES it back. \nThey're nearing the end of the Asteroid Field when both go to switch it at the same time and -- \nWHAM! A LARGE ASTEROID SMASHES THROUGH the stern of the Milano. \nI/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE \nA CHUNK OF THE REAR OF THE CRAFT DISAPPEARS. \nNebula IS SUCKED toward the hole - but, fortunately, her arms are shackled to a post, so she doesn't fly out. \nHer face and body cover with frost. \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \nEverything FLIES AROUND THE SPACECRAFT, RUSHING THROUGH THE HOLE. \nGroot GOES FLYING, but Quill CATCHES HIM, and casually TOSSES him back to Drax -- \nSo that he can punch in a code, causing - \nI/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE \nA PROTECTIVE ENERGY SHIELD SLIDES UP in front of the hole. Nebula COLLAPSES to the floor. She yells upstairs -- \nNEBULA Idiots! \nI/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE \n", "test2_input": "KRAGLIN Yeah... I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace. Or a nice hat. Something that'll make the other girls go `oooooo, that's nice.' \nNebula gives him a look of pure death. \nKRAGLIN (CONT'D) Anyway, uh, happy trails. \nINT. PALACE COURTYARD - DAY \nQuill looks up at a GIANT SCULPTURE of his mother. He is upset. Ego is behind him, watching him, sadly. \nQUILL My mother told everyone my father was from the stars. \nQuill turns to look at his father, somewhat accusatory. \nQUILL (CONT'D) She had brain cancer - so everyone thought she was delusional. \nEgo looks sad, ashamed. \nEGO PETER - \nQUILL Listen. I'd love to believe all of this, I really would - but you left the most wonderful woman ever, to die alone! \nEgo has tears in his eyes. \nEGO I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter. But if I don't return regularly to this planet, and the light within, this form will wither and perish -- \nQUILL So why didn't you come back?! Why'd you send Yondu, a criminal, of all people, to fetch me?! \nEGO I loved your mother, Peter! I couldn't stand to set foot on an earth where she wasn't living! You can't imagine what that's like! \nQUILL I know exactly what that's like! I had to watch her die! \nEgo stops, seeming to hear his son.   He touches him. \nEGO Over the millions and millions of years of my existence I have made many mistakes, Peter. But you're not one of them. Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be. \nQuill looks at him, vulnerable. \nEGO (CONT'D) There are so many things I need to teach you. This planet, and the light within... they are a part of you. \nQUILL What do you mean? \nEgo takes Quill's hands in his own, gently, putting them in the correct position. \nEGO Give me your hands, son.    Here. Hold them like that. \nQuill holds his hands apart.   Ego steps back, holding his hands in the same way. \nEGO (CONT'D) Now close your eyes and concentrate. Take your brain to the center of the planet. \nQuill concentrates. He holds his hand out.    A white light emanates from it. \nEGO (CONT'D) Yes! Yes! \nQUILL Whoa. \nThe light disappears as quickly as it came. \nEGO Yes, yes - it's okay. Just relax. Concentrate. You can do it. Bring it back. \nQuill concentrates and the LIGHT, once again, bursts up from the palms of his hands. \nEGO (CONT'D) Yes, yes, now - shape it - \nEgo shows him, pulling in the molecules around him, so that the light itself forms into the shape of a ball. \nEGO (CONT'D) Feel the energy. \nQuill tries to pull molecules into the ball. And, little by little, they come, and the ball glows brighter. \nEGO (CONT'D) Yes. \nQuill laughs. Ego is JOYOUS. He almost looks as if he's going to break down in tears. \nEGO (CONT'D) You're home, Peter. \nEgo cups his hands. \nEGO (CONT'D) Here. \nQuill, smiling, THROWS him the ball. Ego LAUGHS. He inspects the cosmic ball of light, and he throws it back to Quill. \nQuill LAUGHS, catching it, and throws it back.   Ego moves back further. \nAnd Ego and Quill continue tossing the ball back and forth there, LAUGHING, a friendly father and son game of catch in the middle of a palace courtyard. \nEXT. PALACE - DAY \nDrax and Mantis sit here, soaking in the sun and gazing at the lush, flowing hills, like something an alien Maxfield Parrish would paint. \nDRAX How did you get here? \nMANTIS Ego found me in my larva state, orphaned on my homeworld. He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own. \nDRAX So you're a pet? \nMANTIS I suppose. \nDRAX People usually want cute pets. Why would Ego want a hideous one? \nMANTIS I am hideous? \nDRAX You're horrifying to look at, yes. \nMantis seems sad about this.    Drax notice this, feels bad. \nDRAX (CONT'D) But it is a good thing. \nMANTIS Oh? \nDRAX When you are ugly and someone loves you, you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who to trust. \nMANTIS Well, then I am certainly grateful to be ugly! (THINKING) Poor Gamora. She can never trust anyone. \nDrax nods and stares out at spattered patches of water. \n", "test2_true": "MANTIS Disgusting? \nDRAX Innocent. \nDrax stares out at them without expression. \nSlowly, Mantis TOUCHES his shoulder. \nAnd, as she does, TEARS INSTANTLY FLOW DOWN HER CHEEKS. She stares with Drax at the hills. They feel the sadness together: she cries while he's stoic. \nMANTIS I have never met anyone like you, or your friends. You are filled with such... love. It is a thing I did not know existed, not like this, and I think... I think it may be the very finest of all things. It both hurts and soothes the heart. \nShe looks at Drax. There is something she wants to say, but she is torn. \nMANTIS (CONT'D) Drax, there is something I must TELL - \nGAMORA (O.S.) What's going on? \nDrax and Mantis turn to see her behind them. She smiles. \nMANTIS I am learning many things. Like I am a pet and ugly. \nGAMORA You're not ugly. (ADMONISHING) Drax. \nDrax, confused, points at Mantis, as if her ugliness proves itself. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) Mantis, can you show us where we'll be staying? I'm getting eye-strain in this place. \nMantis nods, yes. \nEXT. PATH TO SLEEPING QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER \nGamora, Drax, and Mantis walk across the sunset. \nGAMORA Why are there no other beings on this planet? \nMANTIS The planet IS Ego. A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back. \nGAMORA And you're not a flea? \nMANTIS I'm a flea with a purpose. I help him sleep. \nGamora curls around Mantis, cutting her off. \nGAMORA What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out? \nMantis looks around, worried. \nMANTIS Nothing. \nGamora and Drax share a look: why is she so scared? Mantis moves on. \nMANTIS (CONT'D) Your quarters are this way. \nINT. ECLECTOR CELL - OUTER SPACE \nRocket HITS THE GROUND, hard.   Yondu LANDS equally hard on the ground beside him. \nThey look up to see Taserface, Gef the Ravager and an OBTUSE RAVAGER locking the cell door. \nTASERFACE We'll deliver you to the Kree in the morning. Neither one of you gonna last much longer after that. \nRocket crawls toward them as they walk away. \nROCKET Okay, Taserface. See you later, Taserface. Hey, Taserface, tell the other guys we said hi, Taserface! \nTaserface glances back, perturbed, as he disappears around the corner. \nINT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE \nTaserface, Gef, and Obtuse come around the hall. \nGEF THE RAVAGER What about the little plant? Can I smash it with a rock? \nTASERFACE No, Gef! It's too adorable to kill. Bring it to the tailor. \nINT. ECLECTOR CELL - OUTER SPACE \nYondu and Rocket settle.   Yondu looks like a beaten man. \nROCKET No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks. \nYONDU I was a Kree battle-slave for twenty years when Stakar freed me. He offered me a place in the Ravagers. Said all I needed to do was adhere to the code. But I was young and greedy and stupid - like you stealing those batteries. \nROCKET That was mostly Drax. \nYONDU Me and Stakar, and the other captains - we weren't so different from you and your friends. The only family I ever had. But I broke the code. They exiled me. \nYONDU (CONT'D) These ones here are the ones who followed - of course they're jerks. Which is what I deserve. \nROCKET Slow down, drama queen. You might deserve this, but I don't. We gotta get out of here. \nYONDU Where's Quill? \nROCKET Went off with his old man. \nYONDU Ego? \nYondu looks concerned. Rocket stares at him, picking this up. \nROCKET Yeah. It's a day for dumbass names. \nYondu SNICKERS. \nROCKET (CONT'D) You smiled and for a second I got a warm feeling, but then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth. Ever heard of floss? \nYondu's smile disappears. \nYONDU You're like a professional asshole or - ? \nROCKET Pretty much a pro. Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised? \nYONDU He was skinny, could fit into places we couldn't. Good for thieving. \nRocket nods, GRUMBLES. \n", "test3_input": "EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER/PLANET'S HOLLOW - DAY \nEgo SLAMS Quill back against a wall. Ego pulls the huge rocks away from the wall, FLYING THEM TOWARDS HIM and BATTERING HIM THERE. \nEgo and Quill FLY TOWARDS each other. \nEgo uses the LIGHT TO BRING ROCKS TO HIS BODY, forming a giant AVATAR OF HIMSELF. \nQuill brings YELLOW ROCKS to his body, forming a GIANT PAC- MAN. \nEgo's form flies into Pac-Man's mouth, so hard there's a SONIC BOOM. \nThey fall, TUMBLING, still striking one another on the way down. \nThey LAND HARD. \nINT.

PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY \nGamora and Nebula are caring for Mantis as Rocket and Groot ARRIVE. \nGAMORA Where's Peter? \nRocket doesn't answer. Or he can't answer. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) Rocket, where is he?! \nRocket looks down at a timer in his hand. The time is almost there. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) Rocket?! Rocket, look at me! Where is he?! \nRocket just shakes his head a little. \nBut Groot points sadly outside. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) I'm not leaving without him. \nGamora hardens. She stands and SNATCHES A RIFLE off the wall. She COCKS IT. \nShe STARTS OUT the bay door -- \nWhen AN ELECTRICAL BLAST HITS HER from behind. \nShe FALLS OVER, unconscious, REVEALING Rocket with his gun. \nROCKET I'm sorry. I can only afford to lose one friend today. (INTO COMM) Kraglin, GO! \nINT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY \nDrax looks uncertain as Kraglin presses thrust. \nDRAX Wait. Is Quill back? (INTO COMM) Rocket, where's Quill?! \nI/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY \nRocket looks sadly out the bay door as it CLOSES; Drax's voice echoes on his comm. \nDRAX (O.S.) 251             Where's Quill?! WHERE'S QUILL?!                   251 \nEXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nQuill and Ego are exhausted, on their knees and leaning against one another like boxers after too many rounds. \nINT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY \nThe timer reads 00:26 seconds \nEXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nEgo reaches for the core.. \nEGO No, we need to stop it! \nQuill throws him to the ground. But Ego comes back up, grasping his son's jacket, pleading with him now. \nEGO (CONT'D) Listen to me! You are a god! If you kill me, you'll just be like everyone else! \nQUILL What's so wrong with that? \nEgo looks at his son, scared. \nEGO NO - \nINT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY \nThe countdown reaches zero.    The brain EXPLODES. \nI/E. EGO'S NERVOUS SYSTEM - DAY \nThe explosion causes the life forces to BURST THROUGH THE ENTIRE PLANET. \nEXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY \nEverything around Quill is EXPLODING. \nHe looks down at his hands, where the glow FADES and DISAPPEARS. \nHe gazes up at the mammoth walls around him as they BLOW UP and COLLAPSE. \nHe lowers at head, at peace with the death that's coming, when, from the side, through the debris -- \nYONDU IS FLYING TOWARDS HIM ON AN AERO-RIG. \nYondu GRABS him, almost a tackle, really, LIFTING HIM up and FLYING AWAY. \nEXT. PLANET'S HOLLOW - DAY \nAs Yondu and Quill FLY UPWARD, the planet EXPLODES behind them, flames licking their heels, huge stretches of the planet caving in. \nEXT. SKY - DAY \nYondu holds a surprised Quill as they SOAR up into the sky, \n", "test3_true": "QUILL What? \nYONDU I'm sorry I didn't do it right. I'm damn lucky you're my boy. \nQuill is touched. \nYondu SLAPS the SPACESUIT disk onto Quill; THE SHIMMERY SHEATHE COVERS HIM. \nQUILL What? \nYondu breathes out as completely as he can, emptying his lungs. And they EXIT THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE, bursting into - \nEXT. SPACE - OUTER SPACE \nQuill struggles to get free, but Yondu holds him there, trapping him, but it is also an embrace. The ENTIRE PLANET is COLLAPSING BEHIND THEM. \nQUILL Yondu, you can't! What are you doing? What are you doing?! \nYondu's jet pack expires its supply of fuel, and they STOP THERE, in space, FLOATING. \nYondu's grip weakens. Quill turns to face him. \nQUILL (CONT'D) Yondu. Yondu, no! \nYondu grabs his son's face with both hands, looking and touching him with love. \nQUILL (CONT'D) No. \nAnd Yondu's FACE EXPANDS and his BODY GOES LIMP as he DIES there. And he starts to DRIFT AWAY. Quill grabs onto his shirt. He is CRYING. \nQUILL (CONT'D) No! \nAnd, suddenly, behind Quill, Rocket and Drax PROPEL themselves toward him in aero-rigs, GRABBING him. \nFADE TO BLACK \nINT. ECLECTOR CREMATORY - LATER \nYondu's body lies on a plank here: Various colored cloths are laid in strips over his body and face, yaro lilies beneath him, red-fired pyres and Yondu's toys all around. \nRocket, Groot, Drax, Gamora, Mantis, and Kraglin surround the table. Quill is at the head. He has to say a few words. But it is not easy. \nQUILL The other day I told Gamora how I used to pretend my dad was David Hasselhoff. \nRocket and Drax exchange a look. \nQUILL (CONT'D) He's a singer and actor from earth... a really famous guy. \nDrax nods. \nQUILL (CONT'D) And, you know, today it struck me. Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow. And he didn't have the voice of an angel, but he did have the whistle of one. And both David Hasselhoff and Yondu went on kickass adventures, and hooked up with hot women, and fought robots. (MORE) \nQUILL (CONT'D) So, the thing is, David Hasselhoff kinda did end up being my Dad after all, only he was Yondu. I had a pretty cool Dad. \nQuill starts to break down. \nQUILL (CONT'D) And what I'm trying to say here is, that thing you're searching for your whole life, sometimes it's right there by your side all along and you don't even know it. \nGamora sees Nebula, watching from a darkened doorway, before she turns and walks away. She moves after her. \nGroot looks up at an upset Rocket. \nGROOT I am Groot? \nROCKET Yeah. That's the friend I was talking about. \nGROOT I am Groot. \nROCKET He did call you `twig.' \nINT. QUADRANT SMALL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nGamora catches up to Nebula in the hall. \nGAMORA Nebula. \nNebula turns toward her, but she doesn't look her in the eye. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) I was just a child. Like you. I was concerned with staying alive until the next day - every day. And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you. I am sorry. \nNebula nods. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) I'm trying to make it right, everything I did. (MORE) \nGAMORA (CONT'D) There are little girls like you were - little boys - all over the universe - who are in danger. You can stay with us, and help them. \nNEBULA I'll help them by killing Thanos. \nGAMORA I don't know if that's possible. \nNebula shrugs: maybe. She turns to leave. But Gamora grabs her, perhaps too roughly. Nebula turns, ready to snap. \nAnd Gamora EMBRACES her. Nebula does not know how to react. \nGAMORA (CONT'D) You'll always be my sister. \nTears well in Nebula's eyes and, for just a moment, she embraces her sister back with one hand... \nBefore pushing her away and leaving. \nINT. ECLECTOR CREMATORY - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Guardians lift Yondu on the plank. A bulbous and rusty crematory is at the center of the room. It doesn't burn with fire, but a SWIRLING, VIBRANT COSMIC ENERGY. \nThey SLIDE YONDU IN as they watch with sadness and respect as his body is enveloped by the sparkling colors. Quill closes the door on the crematory. \nAs Quill moves away, Kraglin approaches. \nKRAGLIN Pete. \nQuill turns toward him. He's holding something. \nKRAGLIN (CONT'D) Cap'n found this for you in a junker shop. Said someday you'd come back to the fold. \nKraglin puts an MP3 player in his hand. \n"}

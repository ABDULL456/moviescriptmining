Eggs follows his gaze and looks down. 
EGGS (gasps) But.. you're all alive!? 
BIG REVEAL: IN THE DARK PIT ARE DOZENS OF ENSLAVED BOXTROLLS in chains! They surround a massive, unrecognizable machine. They work on different sections drilling, welding, wrenching, etc. 
Oil Can looks up and spots Eggs and Fish. 
OIL CAN Eggs? 
BOXTROLL PRISONERS Eggs! Eggs! EGGS! 
Then amidst all the weird gurgling a HUMAN VOICE calls out. 
PRISONER Huh? 
EGGS Huh? 
Eggs looks and sees a strange man HANGING UP SIDE DOWN amongst the boxtrolls. His head is covered with a wild mop of tangled hair and a long beard and mustache dangle from his face. 
Pickles looks up and spots Eggs straddling the cage and the duct. He points up, the Redhats follow his gaze. 
PICKLES There he is... 
Snatcher stares at Eggs' dirty, panicked face. 
SNATCHER It can't be. It's not possible. (ANGRY ) It's not right! 
MR. PICKLES That's our boxtroll! Give `im back! 
SNATCHER (SHOVES PICKLES) Don't stand there gawking. Get him! 
MR. GRISTLE Chase time! 
Gristle laughs with delight and bolts off, tossing his white paper hat to the ground. Snatcher looks to Trout. 
SNATCHER Mr. Trout! 
Mr. Trout pulls a lever and the cage Eggs is standing on jerks up. Fish falls the rest of the way into the duct and disappears. 
FISH AHHHHHH! 
The cage drops! Eggs leaps onto a rafter as the cage crashes to the factory floor! 
SNATCHER TEN YEARS and NOW you show up?! 
Eggs looks down as the floor closes over the boxtroll prisoners faces. 
OIL CAN Eggggs! 
EGGS What are you doing with them? 
SNATCHER You'll find out soon enough! 
Pickles runs past fumbling with a bolas gun as Gristle leaps onto the nearest hanging cage and points at Trout with his cricket bat. 
MR. GRISTLE Up! 
Trout pulls a lever and Gristle rides the cage up into the rafters like a pirate. 
MR. GRISTLE (CONT'D) I'M FLYING ON A CAGE! 
He leaps off the cage and grips his cricket bat with his teeth. He swings through the rafters on ropes, all the while laughing like a maniac. He lands in front of Eggs and swings the bat aloft. 
MR. GRISTLE (CONT'D) HA! (swings) RAH! 
Eggs shrieks and runs across the skinny girders. Gristle follows on his heels. 
SNATCHER SHOOT MR. PICKLES! Shoot! 
Pickles nervously aims his bolas gun at him. 
MR. PICKLES It'd be easier if he'd stop moving! 
Gristle runs behind Eggs, swinging his bat at his head. Eggs avoids being hit but loses his footing. 
MR. PICKLES (CONT'D) Stop moving! 
Eggs falls, hits a beam hard, and grabs the bottom edge of a girder. He hangs there, an easy shot. 
MR. PICKLES (CONT'D) Thank you. 
Gristle raises his bat to strike. Pickles fumbles for the trigger. There's no way they can miss. 
EGGS (defiant, scared) Boxtrolls don't hurt anyone! Let them go! 
SNATCHER Yes, well, I need them. They're my ticket to a white hat, Trubshaw Baby! 
WINNIE (O.S.) TRUBSHAW BABY!? 
Everyone freezes and whirls around. Pickle's shoots distractedly - POP! - but the net misses Eggs and loops around a rafter. 
MR. PICKLES Oops. 
Winnie stands in the open doorway of the factory. 
WINNIE (TO EGGS) I knew there was something strange about you! 
Winnie notices Gristle wielding a cricket bat, Pickles a gun, and Snatcher looking sheepish.

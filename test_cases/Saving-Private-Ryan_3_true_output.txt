Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the barricade.  He salutes Miller. 
REIBEN I'm Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see me? 
Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates, searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly. Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers have been killed in action. 
The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard. Somehow he remains upright. 
Ryan All three? 
MILLER Yes. 
Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning him against some sandbags. 
THE PARATROOPERS Are stunned at the news.  They look at Ryan, there's nothing else they can do. 
MILLER'S MEN Also look at Ryan, but then, one after another, they turn away, adverting their eyes, looking a their own boots, the debris on the bridge, the sky, anything other than Ryan. 
MILLER We've been sent to get you out of here.  You're going home. 
Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a little room. 
Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch. 
MILLER Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm taking you and your men with me. 
Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty- ninth Division. 
MILLER I'm giving you new orders, Sergeant. 
Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command. 
MILLER I'm not going to leave you and your men here to get killed.  Get them together, we're moving out. 
A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly. 
RYAN (O.S.) No, sir. 
They all turn and see Ryan standing there.  Miller is about to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on the arm and speaks softly to him. 
MILLER Come on, Private, you're going home. 
Ryan jerks away from Miller. 
RYAN No, sir. 
All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.  Miller remains patient. 
MILLER Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help. 
RYAN Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks. 
MILLER This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks. 
That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers, but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I'm still not going. 
Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger. 
MILLER Private, if you want to commit suicide, that's your choice, but you're going to have to wait until after I get you back to the beach. And you're not going to take these men with you. 
Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller. 
RYAN I'm not leaving, sir. 
Miller starts to boil over. 
MILLER The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private? 
RYAN I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving. 
Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn't resist. 
MILLER Listen you little son-of-a-bitch you're coming with me or I'll...I'll... 
Ryan speaks softly. 
RYAN What are you going to do, sir, shoot me? 
Miller considers it.  Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind Miller. 
REIBEN (politely) Uh, excuse me, Captain.

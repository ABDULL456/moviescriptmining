Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk up to a typical L.A. Taco truck on the side of the street. There is nothing fancy looking about it. 
ANNA No. 
OLIVER Yeah. 
ANNA Really? 
OLIVER It's really good. JUMP CUT: They're sitting on milk crates by the truck, ready to take their first bite, Anna dives in un-selfconsciously, we're not sure what she thinks. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
OLIVER What do you think? 
ANNA It's so good. Oliver's so relieved. 
OLIVER It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd like it. 
ANNA Why? 
OLIVER You're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel. Anna can barely swallow her huge bite... 
ANNA I like this place. 
INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM 
They lie on the bed, continuing their conversation, side by side, looking up at the ceiling together. 
ANNA I used to love hotels. But now I'm always in a new apartment or... in another hotel somewhere. 
OLIVER How do you keep hold of friends... or boyfriends? 
ANNA It makes it very easy to end up alone - to leave people. 
OLIVER You can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people. She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine. 
ANNA You are like that? Its what you do? Oliver nods yes. They know each other much better than either one knew. 
ANNA So we are the same? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
OLIVER Yeah, I guess so. The look to each other. 
CUT TO PAST 
INT. HAL'S HOUSE - OLIVER'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Thumps and loud 1920's music wakes Oliver in the middle of the night. He turns the lights on, discombobulated. He gets up, works his way through the dark house. Turning on lights. 
OLIVER Pop? 
INT. HAL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Hal's awake, he's taken down dozens of books from a wall to wall bookshelf. A huge physical task. MARIA a nurse is with him. Oliver's dumbfounded. 
HAL Oh, did I wake you? Yeah. (Handing Maria some books) Thank you Maria. (to Oliver) And now that you're here, uh, would you please put those up there? 
OLIVER What are you--? Pop. What? 
HAL I'm reorganizing. 
OLIVER Prednisone makes you crazy. 
HAL I'm just not sleepy. I feel great. 
INT. HAL'S OFFICE 
Oliver and Hal are sitting at either side of his desk, Arthur is in hal's lap. The sound from last scene bleeds over...

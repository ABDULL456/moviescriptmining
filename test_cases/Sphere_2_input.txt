BARNES What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back? 
TED Maybe we didn't want to come back. 
BACK IN -- THE ROOM 
Norman, Harry, and Beth... 
BETH What are you looking for? 
HARRY A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power. 
ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS. 
BETH What's that noise? 
They LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE. 
NORMAN Sounds a little like water -- 
SUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him -- sucking him inside... 
BETH Norman! 
NORMAN Get this thing off me. 
Beth bends down, presses a button, the CHAIR releases Norman... 
BETH I think the chair thinks you want to fly this thing. 
ON BETH's FACEPLATE -- as she's looking down -- WE BEGIN TO SEE -- reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering across... 
"RV-LHOOQ... DCOM1... " 
Her EYES look up slowly... as we 
CUT TO: 
THE BLACK SCREEN in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow lettering: 
"RV -- LHOOQ -- DCOMl -- U.S.S STAR VOYAGER" 
"ASSIMILATING DATABASE" as a series of numbers race upwards in count... 
And the desk in front of them LIGHTS UP, a control panel coming to life. 
HARRY Nice work, Norman. 
NORMAN Whatever I can do to help. 
ON THE SCREEN as it changes, now filled with columns: 
SHIP SYSTEMS DATA SYSTEMS QUARTER MASTER FLIGHT RECORDS 
Harry punches some keys on the control panel. 
HARRY A flight recorder.  Our future is about to be seen in our present. 
ON THE SCREEN as it changes: 
FLIGHT DATA SUMMARIES FDS 01/01/47-12/31/49 FDS 01/01/50-12/31/52 FDS 01/01/53-12/31/55 FDS 01/01/56-12/31/56 FDS 01/01/56-02/01/56 FDS 02/02/56-UNKNOWN ENTRY EVENT 
NORMAN 01-01-47.  Two thousand-forty seven. 50 years in our future. 
HARRY Unknown Entry Event. 
Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys... 
ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving... WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the illusion of depth. 
The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like we're flying through it. 
The stars and other space matter streaking by. 
BETH What's that cluster of stars there? In the center? 
Harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image... 
HARRY Our answer. 
NORMAN To what? 
HARRY Time travel.  A black hole. 
The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer and closer, brightening. 
The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole. 
ON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS: 
HARRY (O.S.) Ted?  Captain? 
BARNES (O.S.) Yes, Harry. 
HARRY (O.S.) We know how this craft got here. Where it's been. 
BARNES (O.S.) So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels. 
STILL ON NORMAN -- frightened... 
NORMAN Picked up something?  What is it? 
BARNES (O.S.) I don't know.  But it's something alien. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CARGO BAY 
ANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance.  AS WE PAN UP and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly swirling green and blue fluids.  Like mercury.  Mesmerizlng. 
AS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top. 
They walk around it, circling it, looking up at it. 
HARRY This answers one of our questions. 
NORMAN Which one?  Let me get the list out. 
HARRY This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... sphere.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home. 
NORMAN But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past. 
HARRY Our present. 
BARNES But what does it do?  This... sphere.

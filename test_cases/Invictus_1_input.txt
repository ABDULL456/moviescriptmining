The atmosphere is absolutely dismal as the men undress and shower. 
Nobody catches anybody else's eye. Huge, powerful, pale bodies have been ploughed purple with rake marks, bruises and roasties. Plus, one dark body -- that of CHESTER WILLIAMS, a skilled wing from the Cape, a reserved and private man. 
Pienaar takes off his green and gold jersey, sits, begins taking off his cleats. His body hurts. He has been raked, scratched, bruised, and his ankle is swollen. 
A noble warrior, defeated. 
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.) Francois Pienaar's team came to Loftus Versfeld stadium this afternoon, unprepared and arrogant. 
INT. TV STUDIO 
Meet BOLAND BOTHA as he tapes his commentary on the test match. He is an ex-Springbok player from the boycott years, now turned ponderous, florid rugby commentator. He is a household name, and the last word on the state of the Springboks. 
BOLAND BOTHA They left 80 minutes later with their tails between their legs, like whipped mongrels. (BEAT) And I, for one, am glad. Not because we lost, but because there's now no way to disguise the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared to reenter the world of top-notch international rugby. 
Boland defines the South African talent for pessimism and negativity. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SA RUGBY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV) The Rugby World Cup is now less than a year away, and I, for one, am relieved that we are the host nation, and therefore qualify automatically for the tournament. Because I'm not sure we would get in on merit alone. 
The Rugby President sucks on a rum and coke, watches Boland with one of his HENCHMEN. 
RUGBY PRESIDENT Who gets the axe? Someone has to. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FRANCOIS PIENAAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
No after-match party this night. Still depressed by the loss, Pienaar stays home with this fiancee NERINE. 
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV) Pienaar's team played without discipline, without strategy and without courage. 
PIENAAR He's trying to get them to drop me. 
NERINE He's just bitter because the Springboks were boycotted when he played. 
PIENAAR Maybe, but people listen to what he says. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Wearing pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers, Mandela multi- tasks, watching Boland Botha and going through a pile of correspondence, scribbling notes or signing his name. 
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV) They brought shame upon our nation, and I, for one, can say without fear of contradiction, that today, these fifteen so-called men did not deserve to wear the hallowed green and gold. 
ON MANDELA: a thought, an idea -- a big one -- is churning in his head. He grunts, turns off the TV, puts the correspondence aside, stands. 
Mary enters with a glass of milk and some pills, on a tray. 
MARY Here's your muti. I warmed the milk tonight. 
MANDELA You're too good to me. 
Mandela takes his pills. 
MARY Your daughter called, to cancel her visit this weekend. 
Mandela pauses, between pills. 
MANDELA Did she say why? 
MARY No, she didn't. (making it up) She said to tell you she was sorry. 
Mandela nods, has a hard time swallowing his last pill. 
MARY Do you need anything else tonight? 
MANDELA No, thank you. I'm going to bed. Good night. 
MARY Good night, Madiba. Sleep well. 
Mandela smiles at her, but as soon as he is past her, the smile fades. As he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, his face becomes sadder and older and lonelier. 
IN HIS BEDROOM, Mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown. He looks at his bed. It is as smooth and as blank as a sheet of paper. 
He peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch. He switches off the light and lies down, still and straight. 
The most popular man in the world starts and ends each day alone. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY 
A very poor township outside Johannesburg. A stark reminder of how much work Mandela has ahead of him. A STAMPEDE OF KIDS runs by. 
We FOLLOW THE KIDS and find a SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH. A noisy LINE OF THREADBARE KIDS leads from outside into the church. There is a pecking order in the line, based on size. 
MRS. COLEMAN (O.S.) No pushing now! There's enough for everybody! 
INT. SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH - DAY 
At a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of second-hand clothes under the watchful eye of MRS. COLEMAN, a stout and charitable woman. Next to her, MRS. DLAMINI hands out a lollipop and says -- 
MRS. DLAMINI God bless you. 
-- to each kid. The clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm kept by Mrs. Dlamini's "God bless yous". 
The last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids reduces until there is only ONE SMALL BOY (SIPHO) left and only one article of clothing. An old SPRINGBOK RUGBY PRACTISE JERSEY. Green and gold. 
Sipho could use it. His clothes are more holes than anything else. He looks at the Springbok jersey mournfully. 
MRS. COLEMAN You're a very lucky boy. It's a real Springbok practise jersey! It's a bit big, but it's warm and it'll last for ever! 
Sipho shakes his head. 
MRS. COLEMAN It's yours, take it! Go on. 
Sipho turns and leaves. Mrs. Coleman looks at Mrs. Dlamini, completely confused.

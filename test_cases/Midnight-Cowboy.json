I mean Christ! \nJoe inspects the boots, seats himself on a battered Army cot - which has been added while he slept -- swinging a boot by its strap, considering whether to stay or go. \nRATSO (CONT'D) I drug in a cot, if you want to stay. \nJOE Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette. \nRatso offers a cigarette from his crushed package, Joe strikes a match on his thumbnail and lights up, staring at Ratso. \nJOE (CONT'D) You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea? \nRATSO I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you? \nJOE Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression. \nJoe makes a slow move to pull on one boot. \nRATSO I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I? \nJOE Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear? \nRATSO I'm impressed. You're a killer. \nJOE So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know. \nJoe yawns, picks up a few blankets and spreads them on the cot. He puzzles out the faded printing on one blanket. \nJOE (CONT'D) Property of the YMCA. You make me wanna puke sometimes, Ratso. \nRatso blows out the candle and wraps himself in blankets. \nRATSO Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso.

Is that enough? (then) And keep your meat hooks off my radio. \nEXT. VEGETABLE MARKET - DAY \nRatso wears a threadbare raincoat of faded black, several sizes too large, as he shops with housewives at a sidewalk vegetable stand -- elbowing his way through the ladies, testing fruit, picking up vegetables and putting them back -- till the GREENGROCER spots him. \nGREENGROCER You! Out! Out! I told you, I calla cops! \nThe other shoppers deliberately turn their backs, avoiding involvement. As the Greengrocer grabs Ratso, Joe ambles into the scene, wearing his dangerous little smile. \nJOE Hey, looka here, that ain't nice, picking on a cripple... \nJoe intervenes just long enough for Ratso to escape, then ambles on, leaving the Greengrocer in frustrated fury.

X FLAT - DAY \n", "test2_id": 379, "test3_input": "... a drab entrance hall, dimly lit -- signs identifying various commercial tenants -- a pink-on-black placard reading MACALBERTSON, TWO FLIGHTS UP. Joe has started up before he notices Ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the stairs, struggling to catch his breath. His face and hair are wet with perspiration, his lips lavender-blue. \nIn swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in Ratso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak or offer reassurance. \nJOE Better dry your hair some. You sweating all over the goddam place. \nJoe pulls out his shirttail, grabs Ratso by the neck and rubs his head dry. \nJOE (CONT'D) You got a comb? \nRATSO Don't need a comb. \nJOE Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess. \nJoe hands Ratso his own comb. Ratso swipes at his tangled hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb. He hands the comb back, tugs at his hair with his fingers, pats it in place, then looks back into Joe's eyes. \nRATSO Okay? I look okay? \nIn a moment of silence, distant sounds can be heard -- a siren, the grinding teeth of a garbage truck, the twang of an electric guitar upstairs at the party -- then Ratso makes a quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs, pulling himself on the bannister. \nINT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT \nA bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter -- electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up, showing the murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters, LOVE WAS GROOVY -- GROOVY IS DEAD. Joe shouts over the amplified music. \nJOE Better get a hold of someone and tell them I'm here. \nRatso points to his ear -- he can't hear -- following Joe across the room. The huge loft is crowded with a random selection, gathered to serve as dress extras in an underground film. The party is the scene. The MacAlbertsons merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen, with cameras strategically placed to record the happening... \n... Hansel with tape recorder, Gretel with hand-held camera drifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a detached, whimsical fashion. Gretel turns her camera on Joe and Ratso as they approach. \nJOE (CONT'D) Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I... \nRATSO Rico. Rico Rizzo. \nGretel smiles without recognition. Hansel gestures vaguely. \nHANSEL Do you need anything? I mean there's beer and so forth. Whatever your thing is... \nThe twins move away together, pausing to confer with the operator of a tripod camera -- focused on an emaciated flower girl with long hair and dirty feet, stretched in a sarcophagus, clutching a dead daffodil, her eyes glazed. Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head -- LOVE! \nRATSO If you want the word on that brother and sister act, I'll give you the word. That Hansel's a fag and Gretel's got the hots for herself. So who cares, right? Load up on the salami... \nRatso heads for the refreshment table. Joe starts after him but pauses, intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a light show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies projected against abstract currents of color and strobe light... \n... a bored fat lady in a muu-muu, squatted like a Buddha at a low table, rolling joints for the guests. She lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to watch the show. Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what it is... \nJOE Shee-it, this is one helluva party! \n... glancing around at the others, imitating their techniques -- the quick inhaler, who follows with sharp gulps of air - the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils -- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy, starting to laugh at the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action around him slowing almost imperceptibly, overcranked -- a veil of smoke hanging over the fat woman's face, transforming her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joe's head, relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face, spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand, grinning at... \n... a serious young technician handling the light show, scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh... \n... Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back to the crowded loft, fascinated to see... \n... a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end of the loft, photographing the scene below... \n... a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the style of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle, predatory eyes searching the crowd... \n... Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the buffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware of Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he steals, turning away casually, disinterested... \n... Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming... \n... Shirley in fleeting close-up, gone in an instant, reappearing... \nINT.

Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you? \nJoe grins, watching Shirley's lips move, unable to keep her in sync, startled to hear Ratso's voice. \nRATSO'S VOICE She's hooked... \nINT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT \nJoe realizes he is back at the party, Ratso whispering hoarsely. \nRATSO ... I'd say she was good for ten bucks, but I'll ask for twenty... \nBut Joe is watching with terrible fascination as Hansel and Gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus. \nSHIRLEY'S VOICE Did you know? We were going to make it? \nJoe glances down to see himself flanked by Ratso and Shirley. \nRATSO You really want to do business? \nSHIRLEY Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ? \nThe flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped in black paint and smears a huge X across LOVE. Joe laughs. \nHANSEL'S VOICE Why are you laughing, Joe? \nHansel holds a microphone toward Joe, who shrugs, grinning at Ratso and Shirley. Gretel's camera moves down Joe's body. \nHANSEL Are you for real, Joe? \nJOE Well, I ain't a f'real cowboy, but I'm one hell of a stud! \nShirley glances at Ratso, who nods, whispering in her ear. \nRATSO A very expensive stud. And I happen to be his manager. \nThe scene -- from Joe's viewpoint -- becomes increasingly confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the center of attention in his own blown mind... \n... Shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body, lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips... \nSHIRLEY It's too much -- to come face to face with a walking talking sex fantasy -- to buy a man's -- God! \n... the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera... \nSHIRLEY'S VOICE I can't wait to tell my man Monday. I should be taking notes. Look at my arm! \n... Shirley's talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh on her tanned arm... \nRATSO'S VOICE I gotta sit down. I feel crummy. \nRatso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing one in Ratso's hand Gretel photographing his reaction... \nSHIRLEY'S VOICE Eat it -- a man in your line of work has to keep his strength up... \n... Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate, watching him bite into it... \nSHIRLEY It's fantastic, now I know, everything you do has sexual implications. If I you know, bought it -- could I take pictures of you naked? That's part of it, isn't it, kinky kinda things? \n... the tall black girl and a few others are trying to promote an orgy. A scrofulous old wino dances spastically, working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to two girls dancing together... \n", "test3_id": 380}

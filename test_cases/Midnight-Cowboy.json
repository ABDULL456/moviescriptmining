TV STUDIO - DAY \nA Susskind-type MODERATOR is speaking into camera: \nMODERATOR Tonight we'll discuss a subject most of us seem to consider either bad taste or frivolous or funny. But if our experts are right, we face what might be called a masculinity crisis. Every fourth American man uptight, threatened by the increasing sexual demands of American women... \nEXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY \nAn IRATE WOMAN speaks into camera: \nIRATE WOMAN They always put it that way, but well, all it means, you know, is every fourth American woman's never satisfied. That's it. I never am -- have been, you know... \nEXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY \nA COOL WOMAN speaks into camera: \nCOOL WOMAN This, this image of the, the man eating woman. It isn't our increasing demands.

A big problem. With so many women I know... \nCamera pulls back to show the picture among other pinups of women -- rich, beautiful or naked, but all blonde -- steam wilted on the wall over a dishwashing machine. JOE BUCK grins at the wall as he scrapes garbage. \nJOB Just keep your pants on, ladies... \nMULTIPLE SPLIT SCREEN \nA LADY COMMENTATOR, gradually surrounded by lonely women... BEAUTY PARLOR FASHION SHOW PSYCHIATRIST'S COUCH COCKTAIL BAR GYMNASIUM STATUE OF LIBERTY \nLADY COMMENTATOR Before World War One -- American men outnumbered women by over six percent. Today American women not only outnumber men, but live five years longer -- leaving them in control of vast corporate wealth and seventy-five percent of America's purchasing power... \nThe Lady Commentator is replaced by Joe, stacking dishes, surrounded by frustrated ladies. He laughs tolerantly. \nJOE Y'all,line up and take your turn... \nINT. TV STUDIO - DAY \nThe Moderator smiles into camera. \nMODERATOR My question is this -- will American know-how come up with a marketable male to replace all the men who are worrying themselves into an early grave over women's increasing sexual demands? \nINT. STALL SHOWER - DAY \nJoe sings as he soaps himself, \"Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies, for you know New York will be your new home!\" Sound and image freeze on Joe's open mouth. \nSUPERIMPOSED MAIN TITLE AND CREDITS \nTITLES follow as indicated, sound and action continuing after each credit. \nINT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY \nJoe's song continues over a sweating WAITRESS, glancing up. \nThe pink Manager points at his watch angrily. \nMANAGER Four to midnight, understand? \nAngle widens to include Joe, holding his suitcase and radio. Ralph stares at him curiously, stacking dishes. \nJOE Say, look, uh, I gotta have a word with you, if you got a second. \nMANAGER Later. Later maybe. \nThe Manager hurries away, carrying a basket of dishes. \nRALPH You ain't coming to work? \nJOE Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East. \nJoe tilts his Stetson as the Waitress appears at the door... \nWAITRESS Cups! \n... but she disappears without noticing Joe. Ralph offers his hand. Joe takes it, holds it. \nRALPH What you gonna do back there, East? \nJOE Lotta rich women back there... \nRALPH Yeah? \nJOE Men, they mostly faggots. \nRALPH Must be some mess back there. \nJOE Well, ain't no use hanging around here. \nRALPH Ain't gonna collect your pay? \nJOE I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money... (slaps hip) He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige! \nINT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY \nThe door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY swings open and Joe appears, measuring his effect on the customers and his fellow employees as he crosses the sterile white dining room, observing the drab details of the life he has left behind - garbage on greasy dishes, limp food in steam table trays, coffee-soaked cigarette butts, caked mustard and ketchup on formica table tops -- two pimply high school girls slurping suggestive noises after Joe through the straws of empty coke glasses. O.S. a Tiomkin-tradition chorus sings, \"From this valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile for they say you are taking the sunshine...\" \nEXT. TOWN MAIN STREET - DAY \nThe song ends as Joe comes from the cafeteria \"... that brightened our pathway a while.\" \nJOE Tough tiddy, ladies, you had your chance. \nFrom a high angle -- Joe starts his long walk toward the bus depot along the street of a small Western town struggling to urbanize itself. The click-clack-click of his boots is loud but somehow lonely The radio at his ear drones grain prices on the Commodity change. Joe's pace slows as he passes... \nEXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY \n... a gilt-lettered sign in the window, glittering in the sun, momentarily hiding the fact that the shop is deserted. Joe grins as he hears remembered sounds and voices incomplete flashes, more significant in tone than content a girl giggling sexily -- \"Keep your meat hooks off my beauty operators, sugar\" -- tinkling noises of a busy beauty parlor - Sally Buck singing \"Hush, little baby, don't say a word, Grammaw gonna buy you a mockingbird...\" \n... a shift of light revealing a row of tarnished driers, a broken mirror, a FOR RENT sign in the window. Joe turns toward the bus depot, radio pressed to his ear. \nANNOUNCER'S VOICE Benson and Hedges One Hundreds makes special awards from time to time for anything that's longer than anything... \nJOE Care to get out your yardstick, gentlemen? \nAt the same moment, a recognizable variant of the \"Big Country\" theme blares loud. \nINTERCUT WESTERN FILM CLIP \nGary Cooper (or John Wayne) walks a frontier street. \nSALLY BUCK'S VOICE Don't forget to say your prayers, honey... \nJoe leans forward to help the old Lady, irritably struggling with the release button on her seat. She scowls as Joe leans over to release her seat, then pulls her blanket around her and turns away from him. Joe switches off her reading light. \nOLD LADY I want it on. \nJoe switches it on again, fakes a good-natured grin, settles back with his radio, aware of an OLD COWHAND seated opposite him, replacing the Pale Blonde. The Old Cowhand is appraising Joe's wardrobe curiously. He looks away when he sees Joe watching him. Joe settles back, unable to think of a way to open a conversation. \nEVANGELIST'S VOICE Oh, my friends, I say unto you, invest with Jesus, put your dollars to work where they'll pay off at compound interest. The Good Book says money answereth all things... \nThe Old Cowhand has rolled-himself a cigarette. Joe quickly lights a match on his thumb and holds it across the aisle. \nJOE Light? \nThe Old Cowhand's \"thanks\" is lost in a fit of coughing as he inhales his first drag. He settles back, wiping his watery eyes on a faded bandana. \nEVANGELIST'S VOICE ... everyone who sends a dollar to the Evangelical Congregation of the Air will get free gratis a genuine leatherette hymn book so you can sing along with Sister Rosella and the Evangelical Choir... \nJOE You throw in Sister Rosella and you got a deal, right, old timer? \nJoe glances across the aisle. The Old Cowhand manages a faint, humorless smile. \nJOE (CONT'D) Going far? \nOLD COWHAND Up the line. Not far. \nJOE I'm bound for New York City. \nThe Old Cowhand reappraises Joe's wardrobe even more curiously. \nJOE (CONT'D) Ever happen to come across a cowman name of Woodsy Niles? Friend of my grammaw Sally Buck... \nThe Old Cowhand considers, shakes his head. Joe leans back, laughing to himself. \nINT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME \nLittle Joe's head is lost in a beat-up cowboy hat, similar to the one worn by the old Cowhand. Sally Buck smiles on WOODSY NILES -- a long-legged cowboy with a shock of black hair -- who stands at her dressing table, admiring himself in a new Stetson. \nSALLY BUCK Like it, honey? Does it fit? \nWOODSY You do me good, Sal, you do me real good. You know what I gonna give you for that Stetson? \nWoodsy grabs Sally Buck, lifting her off her feet, carrying her to the bed. Struggling, they fall across the covers together, Little Joe laughing with them. \nSALLY BUCK Woodsy Niles! The boy! \nWOODSY He don't know what makes little apples by now, it's time he found out. \nINT. BUS - NIGHT \nJoe shakes his head, grinning, offering the old Cowhand a cigarette. \nJOE Smoke? \nThe old Cowhand shakes his head, showing the rolled cigarette Joe lit for him. Joe nods, still bemused. \nINT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME \nLittle Joe is cuddled in Sally Buck's arms, under the covers, watching Woodsy, sitting cross-legged on the bed, naked except for his Stetson and guitar, singing drunkenly. \nWOODSY ... git along little dogies! \nEXT. MIDWEST TOWN - MORNING \nFrom a high angle -- the bus slows to a stop. \nINT. REMEMBERED MOVIE HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME \nANASTASIA clutches a younger Joe, eyes wild, gasping. \nANASTASIA You're the only one, Joe, the only, only one ever! \nINT.

ROOM 1014 - DAY \nJoe sets his radio on the dresser, his suitcase on the bed, then turns to examine his new home -- as anonymous as his Texas hotel room -- but boasting a coin-operated television set. Fascinated, Joe inserts a quarter. \n... the love song continues over a television talk Show featuring a POODLE WIGMAKER defending his profession against a Joe Pyne-type PANEL HOST, \"...well, I perform a real service, there's a need, so many people, you know, really live in their pets, I mean, lonely, I grant you, but their feeling is real. They want to lavish as much love, give them as much, yes, pamper them like they were really human children or whatever...\" \nSALLY BUCK'S VOICE There's a TV dinner in the fridge, lover boy... \nINT. REMEMBERED PARLOR - ANOTHER TIME \nLittle Joe stares sullenly at an antique TV box while Sally Buck puts her hat on at the fireplace mirror. There is a framed picture of Woodsy Niles on the mantle. \nSALLY BUCK You be okay, won't you? Maybe I bring you a treat if you're a good boy... \nINT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJoe turns away from a small terrace, buckling his belt, glancing off toward the sound of Cass in the shower. He flicks the TV remote control, enjoying his power, ignoring the silent images on the screen -- battle casualties, a pretty girl recommending aspirin, a man's stomach flashing animated pain, starving war refugees, a dog eating pzazz -- flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and perfume bottles on Cass's dressing table. \nCASS'S VOICE Don't look, baby... \nJoe turns to look as Cass comes from the bathroom, holding a towel around her as she runs behind the closet door. \nJOE Say, Cass, I, uh, sure have enjoyed being here. Believe it's as fine a time as I've had in my life! \nCASS'S VOICE Me, too, lover. \nJOE That's good, it is, cause, well I guess I didn't tell you why I came to New York, did I? \nA tower of black bugle beads emerges from the closet door. \nCASS Zip this thing, will you, Tex? \nJoe zips her dress, follows her to the dressing table, where she sprays her hair with lacquer. \nJOB Truth is, Cass, I'm, well, I'm in business. \nCASS Oh, poor you. Morey's got terrible ulcers. \nCass stretches her upper lip across her teeth and she smears it with, orange lipstick. \nJOE Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler. \nCASS (lips stretched) Hers'n zodda meg a livig. \nJOE Beg pardon, ma'am? \nCASS Said, a person's gotta make a living. \nJOE You sure you heard what I said? \nCASS Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number? \nJoe grins, relieved as she takes out a gold lame purse and opens it. He frowns as she folds; it upside down, empty. \nCASS (CONT'D) Darn! I didn't get to the bank -- Tex -- could you let me have a little coin for the taxi-waxi? \nJoe stands mute as she cups his chin in her hand, seductively. \nCASS (CONT'D) You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun. \nJOE Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some... \nJoe tries to laugh but it sticks in his throat as Cass speaks -- an impassioned whisper -- still holding Joe's chin. \nCASS You bastard! You son of a bitch! You think you're dealing with some old slut? Look at me! You think just cause you're a longhorn bull you can get away with this crap? Well, you're out of your mind. I am a gorgeous chick, thirty-one, that's right, you said it! \nSobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed. Joe stands bewildered by the vastness of her grief. \nJOE Hey. Hey, Cass. Did you think I meant that? Christ, would I be asking you for money with a wad like that riding on my hip? \nJoe waves his wallet at her, but she only cries louder. He hands her a kleenex. She clutches it to her face, wailing. Joe leans over the bed, whispering in her ear: \nJOE (CONT'D) Hey. You are a gorgeous-looking piece, Cass. Guy gets horny, just looking at you. It's a fact. How much you need for that taxi? Ten? Twenty? There you go. \nJoe tucks a twenty-dollar bill into her bosom, tilts his Stetson and starts out. Cass blows her nose, looking after him. O.S. chorus sings, \"From this valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile...\" \nEXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY \nFrom a high angle, Joe walks away from the apartment house, chorus continuing O.S. \"... they say you are taking the sunshine that brightened our pathway a while.\" \nJACKIE May I ask one thing, cowboy? If you sit there and he sits way over there, how's he gonna get his hand into your pocket? But I'm sure he has that all figured out... (to Ratso) Good night, sweets. \nTV HOST May present your chosen mate! \nThe TV host pulls aside the screen which has concealed the lower half of the three young men. Number Two, her chosen mate, is a dwarf sitting on a high stool. The girl's spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically, including the dwarf. \nEXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY \nJoe has difficulty keening up with Ratso, who swings himself along with surprising agility, his half skipping little gate favoring one game leg. \nRATSO Look, with these chicks that want to buy it, most of 'em are older, dignified, right? Social register types. They can't be trotting down to Times Square to pick out the merchandise. They need a middleman, right? That's O'Daniel. \nJoe hesitates as Ratso darts into traffic against a red light, yelling unheard obscenities at a cab driver who blasts his horn. Joe runs recklessly forward as Ratso slams the taxi fender with his fist, pretending to be hit, falling into Joe's arms. The taxi stops, halting traffic. Ratso, recovers, strolls casually in front of the cab, biting his thumb at the driver. \nRATSO (CONT'D) It is a crime, a stud like you passing out double sawbucks to a chick like that. With proper management you should be taking home fifty, a hundred bucks a day. More if you wanta moonlight... \nEXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR \nAt,the corner of Central Park South, Ratso points toward a young man with diamond cuff-links, sitting with a blue-haired matron who puffs on a small cigar. Ratso waves jauntily at the young man, raising his thumb and forefinger in a circle, leaving the young man baffled as Ratso hurries Joe on. \nRATSO Him I placed with O'Daniel just two weeks ago. And look. Not much of a stud either, what I hear... \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - COCKTAIL HOUR \nRatso automatically checks the coin return boxes of the phone booths they pass. Walking the park side of the street, looking across at the limousines and taxis waiting outside luxury hotels and apartment buildings. \nJOE Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now? \nRATSO Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what? \nRatso stops opposite the Plaza hotel, pointing across at an aristocratic blonde stepping out of a Rolls Royce. \nRATSO (CONT'D) Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks. \nJOE Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that? \nJoe peels a ten from his wallet and offers it to Ratso. \nRATSO Joe, please. You know what I'd ask anyone else? Oh hell, tell you what I'll do, I'll take the ten... (he does) ... but when I hand you over to Mr. O'Daniel, I'll have to have another ten, Joe; just to like cover expenses... \nINT. PUBLIC PHONE BOOTH - DUSK \nRatso is on the phone. Joe holds the door open, listening. \nRATSO This boy is just your meat, Mr. O'Daniel, believe it, I'm telling you -- what? -- Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. The point is he needs you. Right now. Tonight... (aside to Joe) I got his tongue hanging out... \nEXT. WEST SIDE HOTEL - DUSK \nCamera moves slowly up the anonymous wall of a drab hotel, following the line of dim red lights marking the fire exits. \nRATSO'S VOICE Name's Joe Buck. Cowboy. Just in from Texas, don't know the ropes, new to the city, but very promising material, sir, and ready, if you get what I mean. Fabulous. Right away. What's that room number there again? \nINT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ELEVATOR - DUSK \nAs ancient open cage lift rises at the same pace as camera in preceding shot. Joe grins excitedly at Ratso, who nods but glances significantly at the elevator operator. Ratso follows Joe to door as the operator grinds to a stop. \nINT. WEST SIDE HOTEL CORRIDOR - DUSK \nRatso steps out with Joe, gesturing to the corridor... \nRATSO Hold it a second... \n... but the operator slams the door and starts on up. Ratso leans heavily on the down button, glancing at Joe. \nRATSO (CONT'D) Nine-oh-one, got it? \nO'DANIEL Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged! \nJoe laughs, driving an obscene uppercut into the air. O'Daniel laughs with him. \nO'DANIEL (CONT'D) You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now? \nJOE Get down -- where? \nO'DANIEL Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer. \nO'Daniel drops on all fours, crawling to find the plug of an electric cord. He shoves it into a wall socket, switches off the overhead light and suddenly a hollow, tinted plastic Jesus glows on the dresser. O.S. a revivalist congregation sings. And now we notice, with Joe, placards and flags, horns and tracts, all the paraphernalia of a street corner evangelist. \nJOB Shee-it... \nO'DANIEL That's the ticket, just open your heart and let it flow. It ain't the words, it's the love beyond 'em! \nEXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME \nSally Buck sings with the congregation while a rawboned preacher stands in the river, preparing to immerse little Joe. \nO'DANIEL'S VOICE Don't fight it, boy! \nINT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ROOM - DUSK \nO'Daniel tries to pull Joe down beside him. \nO'DANIEL Pray and you shall be heard! \nEXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME \nCamera becomes little Joe, glimpsing the fevered faces of Sally Buck and the congregation singing on the riverbank, just before being plunged under the river. O'Daniel's voice reechoes, filtered through water. \nO'DANIEL Don't be frightened, son! \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT \nJoe runs in aimless panic, pushing through the crowd, pursued by O'Daniel's voice and the singing congregation. \nO'DANIEL Don't run from Jesus! \nJoe stops short as he sees the front page of a tabloid on a newsstand. There is a picture of Joe being led away by two deputies, under a headline ALABAMA MURDERER SHOTGUNS ELEVEN. \nEXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT \nJoe searches the faces of the crowd, running forward suddenly as he sees Jackie and the farmboy picked up by two men in a large convertible. Joe chases the car to Eighth Avenue but stops, frightened as he sees himself in multiple image on the front of every newspaper displayed on a newsstand. \nINT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT \nThe saloon is almost empty during the after dinner lull. The BARTENDER doesn't look up from his newspaper as Joe approaches. \nJOE Say, you know that runty little bastard I was with? \nBARTENDER I don't know nothing. \nJoe tenses as he sees the . tabloid picture of himself on the back of the bartender's paper. Joe's hand closes around an empty beer bottle, a terrible violence surging very near the surface. O.S. women scream. \nINT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME \nReflected in the mirror, we see little Joe wildly smashing bottles and glass display cabinets -- the voices of women screaming O.S. -- little Joe hurling a perfume bottle which shatters the mirror and his own image. \nINT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT \nThe empty beer bottle stands where it was. Joe has disappeared. On the TV screen over the bar, sound drowned out by the jukebox, we see a blowup of the tabloid photograph, revealing a young man very similar to, but clearly not Joe. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT \nINT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE LOBBY - NIGHT \nJoe's image frozen -- as if another still photograph - standing at the desk, waiting for his key. \nJOE'S VOICE Key to 1014... \nAction continues as the DESK CLERK hands Joe a folded paper instead of a key. Joe opens it, deeply perplexed. \nDESK CLERK Looks like you been locked out of your room, buddy. Till you pick up your tab. \nJOE Uh, what about my things'n all? \nDESK CLERK We keep them nice and safe till you get this straightened out. \nINTERCUT \nRoom 1014 warm and inviting, Joe's suitcase on the bed. \nJOE Listen, tell you what, you can keep all the rest of the goddam junk if you let me have just the suitcase. That suitcase means a lot to me. \nINTERCUT \nThe postcard photograph marked X -- THIS IS ME. \nDESK CLERK We keep everything. House rules. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT \nJoe stands outside the hotel, stunned, seeing the bright colored lights turn suddenly grey. The film continues in black and white as Joe walks into the crowd. \nEXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY \nThe FOR RENT sign flapping in the wind. \nINT. BAR - DAY \nJoe nurses a short beer, like the regulars. He looks up as a crippled panhandler approaches, vaguely reminiscent of Ratso. \nJOE Screw off. \nINT. ROOM 1014 - NIGHT \nThe bed turned back, clean sheets, a soft night light. \nINT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT \nJoe is stretched on a bench, his Stetson over his eyes. A loud speaker announces a bus \"departing for Texas\" but Joe does not move. A policeman taps Joe's boots with his night stick. Joe rises and starts away with mixed anger and apprehension. \nINT. PUBLIC MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nTwo matching Ivy Leaguers exchange a glance as they see Joe washing his feet in the basin. Joe stares back with a belligerent grin. \nJOE Any objection, gentlemen? \nINT. ALL NIGHT CAFETERIA - NIGHT \nJoe balances a cup of coffee, walking past the other solitary night people, avoiding each other's eyes. Joe spots what he's looking for and seats himself next to a gaunt woman and her ten year old son, both freaked out, erratically touching things, themselves, each other in a futile effort to make contact with reality. But Joe is only concerned with the plastic-wrapped crackers left by their empty soup bowls. \nJOB Y'ain't gonna eat them? \nThe woman stares at Joe blankly. The boy runs a toy mouse across the table, up his mother's arm and around her face. With a polite nod, Joe opens the crackers and squirts one with ketchup. Joe upsets his chair as a great gob of ketchup spills onto his pants... \nJOE Shee-it. \n... glancing around with an embarrassed laugh, but the only one looking is a cop, scratching his calf with a night stick. Joe keeps his back to the customers as he moves to the water dispenser, wets a paper napkin and tries to wipe away the stain. But the water has only spread the stain across his pants and down his leg. He blushes as a blonde young streetwalker giggles. \nJOE (controls fury) What you got in your pockets? \nEagerly, the boy produces a family photograph, a subway token, a dirty handkerchief. Joe grabs his wrist, revealing a watch. \nJOE (CONT'D) How much's that worth? \nFAT BOY I can't go home without my watch! My mother'd die! She'd die! Take my books! Not my watch! She'd die! \nBut Joe has already kicked open the door. Theremin voices drown out the Fat Boy, calling \"Earthling, where are you?\" \nINT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT \nJoe sprawls, trying to sleep, his feet on the balcony rail, the radio at his ear. On screen, once again, the Martian maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, but we hear the voice of a desperate woman on two-way radio. As she speaks, a policeman moves along the aisle, slapping his palm with his night stick. \nDESPERATE VOICE Bill, can I call you Bill, Mister Bonner? I feel like I know you from listening. What I called about, Bill, I'm gonna kill myself... \nEXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY \nFrom a high angle, only Joe's Stetson and radio can be seen above a passing bus, its side panel advertising BILL BONNER'S STRAIGHT LINE, A STRAIGHT TALK SHOW. \nBONNER'S VOICE Why call me, baby? If you want to do it; just do it, don't talk about it. Are we drunky? Feeling a little sorry for ourselves maybe? \nJoe appears in full figure as the bus passes. He stands looking at the suitcases in a luggage shop window. \nDESPERATE VOICE Well, Bill, what I got thinking, I didn't want the neighbors to have to find me, this young couple with the boy I want to have my cat, see, Bill? \nINT. RADIO STATION - DAY \nBONNER, tough in a grey crew-cut, talks on the phone. \nBONNER Okay, baby, now listen, just hold on while I leave the line for a minute. And think about all the kids that are dying overseas for you, okay, baby? Got that? I'll be back in exactly sixty seconds. After this message from... \nA taxi born blasts, interrupting the sponsor's message. \nEXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY \nJoe's fist slams a fender violently, using Ratso's fake injury trick to stop traffic, running across the street toward... \nEXT. NEDICK'S - DAY \n... Ratso staring out at Joe, paralyzed in the act of lighting a cigarette -- intercut in flashing close-ups -- Joe outside the window, Ratso inside -- reflecting their conflicting emotions -- Joe's murderous rage -- Ratso's panic -- one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something like pleasure at finding a long-lost friend... \nINT. NEDICK'S - DAY \n... Ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath. \nRATSO Don't hit me, I'm a cripple. \nJoe's hand falls on Ratso's shoulder. \nJOE Oh, I ain't gonna hit you, I'm gonna strangle you to death... \nThe cigarette in Ratso's mouth burns into his lip. He jerks spasmodically, choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the butt and drops it in his coffee cup. \nJOE (CONT'D) ... only first I'm gonna turn you upside down and shake you out right here and now. \nCoughing, eyes tearing, Ratso empties his pockets on the counter, finally producing: sixty-four cents, a few sticks of gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and two pawn tickets. He raises his eyes, somehow ashamed. Joe kicks the toe of Ratso's loafer. \nJOE What's in your socks? \nRATSO Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes. \nRatso removes his loafers and shakes them, glancing at the counter man. His socks don't even conceal his toes. Disgusted, Joe shoves Ratso's small pile back at him. \nRATSO (CONT'D) You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it. \nEXT. DEMOLITION SITE - DAY \nA huge metal ball arcs on chain, demolishing a brick facade. \nINT. X FLAT - DAY \nRatso's face seems to radiate evil as he lights a Sterno can. Joe forces his eyes half-open. \nJOE Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here. \nRATSO Whatsa matter now? \nJoe shivers, pulls a blanket around him, resisting sleep, but the noises of demolition fade, the love theme lures Joe back. \nJOE You don't seem like no fag... \nRATSO What's that supposed to mean? \nJoe's eyes close, his voice continuing out of half-sleep. \nJOE \nWant me to stay here, y'after something. What y'after? \nINT. REMEMBERED CAR - NIGHT \nJoe's thumbnail flares a match, exposing Anastasia on the car seat with Joe, both nearly naked. Anastasia butterfly-kisses Joe's chest as he lights a cigarette. \nANASTASIA \nSay you love me. Just say it. \nJOE \nOkay. I love you. \nAnastasia purrs as her lips find Joe's breast, trying to nurse.

X FLAT - NIGHT \nJoe awakens in a cold sweat, fighting the blankets, wild-eyed as he sees Ratso at the table, examining Joe's radio by candle-light. Joe lunges across the room to snatch the radio from Ratso's hands. \nRATSO For crissake! \nStill wild-eyed, Joe suddenly points at his stocking feet. \nJOE Where's my boots -- ? \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY \nJoe lies on his cot, watching Ratso struggle to penetrate the fibrous husk of a coconut, experimenting with a variety of rusty tools in an old cigar box. \nRATSO The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out. \nJOE This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not? \nRATSO I been sick. Hold this, will ya? \nJoe takes his time rising to hold the coconut while Ratso tries to poke a hole with a bent ice-pick. \nRATSO (CONT'D) In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey? \nJOE I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey! \nJoe jerks his hand away just in time to avoid the ice-pick. The coconut bounces on the floor. Ratso picks it up, holds it, while Joe tries to crack it, swinging his boot like a hammer. \nRATSO Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes. \nJOE What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now? \nJoe swings violently. Ratso yelps, hopping on his one good leg, sucking his thumb. \nRATSO Cowboy killers! Break my finger, Christ! I got news for you, baby, no chick with any class buys that big dumb cowboy crap... \nRatso holds his thumb under the tub-sink faucet. \nRATSO (CONT'D) ... the cowboy bit's out, except among fags of a certain type, which take a certain, type hustler to exploit. Like I could handle it -- being a stealing operation basically -- but take your average fag, very few of them want a cripple. \nJoe holds the coconut like Yorick's skull, thinking hard.* \nJOE Well, I am dumb, that's for sure. I don't talk right. I can't think too good. Just only one thing I ever been good for's loving. Women go crazy for me. Fact. Crazy Annie. Had to send her away. So I don't cash in on that, what am I? I'm shee-it. May's well flush me down that hole with the dishwater. \nJoe sets the coconut on the floor, holding it with both hands while he tries to smash it with the heel of his boot. \nJOE (CONT'D) That's why you gonna stop crapping about Florida and get your skinny butt moving to earn twenty bucks worth of management you owe me... \nINT. ROOM 1014 - DAY \nThe suitcase lies open, displaying Joe's wardrobe. \nJOE'S VOICE Make that twenty-three bucks. \nINT. X FLAT - DAY \nJoe slams his heel down. The coconut shoots out from under him and he lands on his ass. \nRATSO Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap. \nJOE You talk like a man with a tin twat. \nRatso sets the coconut on the window sill, balancing it as he raises the X window. \nRATSO You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey? \nJOE Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue. \nJoe slams, the window down. The coconut flies down to crash O.S. on the sidewalk below. \nEXT. SIDEWALK - DAY \nAn alley cat laps up the milk of the broken coconut. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - FANTASY \nJoe stands naked in the middle of traffic. A siren shrills. Anastasia, catatonic in a hospital smock, moves toward Joe like a sleepwalker, passing through him. \nThe Mutual of New York tower flashes MONY. \nINT. CORNER PHONE BOOTH - DUSK \nRatso consults the memo as he speaks into the phone. \nRATSO Mr. McNeill, I'm calling for Miss Beecham at the Barbizon Hotel for Women. She won't need you tonight... \nEXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT \nA doorman helps a young lady into a limousine. \nRATSO'S VOICE Would you believe a whole goddam hotel with nothing but lonely chicks? \nJoe and Ratso watch from across the street. \nRATSO Score once in that setup, the way chicks talk, Christ... \nJoe cracks his gum, tilts his hat, starts across the street. \nRATSO (CONT'D) Get the money! Remember Cass Trehune? Cash! These rich bitches write a check at night, call the bank and stop payment in the morning. Get the cash! \nIn Ratso's eyes -- as Joe enters the hotel -- its facade suddenly wipes away to reveal rich ladies in negligee waiting in every room. \nINT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT \nJoe starts up the stairs, two at a time. A BELLHOP grabs him. \nBELLHOP Hey! No men upstairs! \nEXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT \nRatso warms his hands at a chestnut vendor's cart, seeing... \n... zoom close-up, a lady in a window grabbing Joe. \nINT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT \nJoe picks up a house phone, watched by the Bellhop. \nEXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT \nRatso sees Joe zip from room to room in wild animation. \nINT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT \nThe lobby watches Joe blow a gum bubble at the elevator. \nEXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT \nStaring at a window display of Florida sportswear, Ratso's imagination soars, seeing... \nEXT. FLORIDA BEACH FRONT - FANTASY \n... Ratso, like a model in a travel poster, in gaudy sport shirt, talking on the phone against a background of hotels... \n... Ratso like James Bond, surrounded by bikinis, dictating while girls serve coconut milk and massage his game leg... \n... Ratso like George Raft, in evening clothes, running a posh casino, flicking a coin... \n... Ratso simply himself, dressed as he is, sitting on the beach, at peace in the sun... \n... the same identical picture with Joe sitting beside Ratso. \nINT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT \nRatso leans over the tub-sink, dry-heaving while he coughs, wearing a sheepskin coat much too large for him. He controls the cough with effort -- hearing the door open and close O.S. -- wipes his mouth and turns to grin at... \n... Joe, trying to light the empty Sterno can, deliberately ignoring Ratso. Ratso shrugs, washes his mouth at the faucet, finds a cigarette butt and lights it, careful to avoid inhaling the first puff. \nJOE Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies? \nRATSO The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ. \nJOE Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you? \nJoe slams ten dollars on the table. Ratso glances at Joe with curious concern. \nRATSO Where'd that come from? \nJOE Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from? \nRATSO You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me. \nRatso pulls off the coat and throws it at Joe. \nJOE Wear it yourself. I wouldn't put it on my back. \nJoe throws it back at Ratso. \nRATSO Goddamned if I'll wear it! \nRatso hurls it in a corner. Joe shoves the ten at Ratso. \nJOE Go get your medicine. Before you die on my goddam, hands... \nEXT. EAST RIVER BRIDGE - DAY \nHigh angle -- Joe and Ratso cross an foot, chilled by wind, neither wearing the sheepskin coat. The Queens riverfront and factories appear cold and bleak, deserted on Sunday. \nEXT. LONG ISLAND CEMETERIES - DAY \nCamera moves into acres of tombstones, piled like low-rent housing projects for the dead, the various faiths segregated by crumbling boundaries. \nJOE'S VOICE Shee-it. I hate boneyards. \nRATSO'S VOICE So split. He ain't your goddam, father. \nEXT. PROTESTANT CEMETERY - DAY \nRatso leads Joe past a Negro family at a grave -- glances around -- snatches an elaborate floral piece from a headstone and hides it under his black raincoat as he darts toward a low dividing wail and swings himself over into... \nEXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - DAY \n... an endless section of plain stone markers. Joe touches his hat to two nuns, guiltily hurrying to overtake Ratso at ibis father's grave, indistinguishable from the other graves except for the name on the headstone. Ratso places the floral piece on the grave with almost absurd solemnity. Joe laughs. \nJOE Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso. \nRATSO The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect. \nJOE Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave. \nRATSO Can he smell the difference, eh? \nJoe reads from the ribbon on the floral display. \nJOE Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'. \nRATSO He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall. \nJoe is frowning, standing at the,headstone, momentarily depressed with an undefined sorrow. \nHANSEL'S VOICE We want you, Joe. You've been chosen. \n... five youths stand beside the sarcophagus -- two sailors, two cycle freaks, a weight-lifter -- waiting to be pallbearers. Joe joins them. All lights and cameras are turned on the slow funeral procession, carrying the flower girl out of the loft to the tune of \"Moonlight and Roses\". Strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene... \nSHIRLEY'S VOICE I had a thing for him. Before I knew. Why should knowing make it more of a thing? \n... Shirley talks to Gretel as she photographs the funeral. \nSHIRLEY Naturally I'll have to ask myself why a cowboy? And why a cowboy whore? But not tonight. \nINT. MACALBERTSON LANDING - NIGHT \nShirley is pulling her coat out of the pile on the bannister. \nSHIRLEY Incidentally, how much is this going to cost me anyway? \nJoe turns to Ratso, whose attention is fixed on the coats. \nJOE Tell her, Ratso. \nRATSO Twenty bucks... \nSHIRLEY Sold. Let's go. \nRATSO ... and taxi fare for me. \nSHIRLEY Get lost. \nRATSO I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare. \nShe takes a dollar from her purse and hands it to Ratso, takes Joe's arm and starts down the stairs. Ratso lingers, starting quickly through the coats, frisking them for loose change. \nINT. LOFT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT \nAt the foot of the stairs, Shirley kisses Joe violently. \nSHIRLEY Your name's Joe. Which is fabulous. Joe could be anyone. Kiss me, Joe, move over, Joe, go away, Joe. It's just perfect. \nThey glance up as Ratso appears, swinging down too rapidly on the bannister. He misses a step and falls -- a clown's fall, unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself. Shirley and Joe are laughing when Ratso lands at the foot of the stairs. \nSHIRLEY (CONT'D) He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right? \nRATSO (rises, mimics) Is he all right! \nJOE Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not? \nRATSO Walk? Naturally I can walk. \nSHIRLEY He's got taxi fare. \nJOE Sure you're all right? \nRATSO (shouts) I said yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! \nINT. TAXICAB - NIGHT \nJoe and Shirley are kissing. Shirley rolls away, flushed, fanning herself. Joe rolls down the window. \nEXT. VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT \nJoe leans out of the taxi window, waving his Stetson, bellowing at the snow. \nJOE Whoopee ti yi yo...! \nEXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT \nJOE Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you! \nSHIRLEY You gonna beat me, Joe? \nJOE Beat your butt, you don't lemme think! \nSHIRLEY Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem? \nJOE I show you what problem -- \nBut the end of his sentence is swallowed by Shirley, taking his kiss in her open mouth, crushed by its impact, an animal noise snarling deep in her throat -- the agonized alley cat wail of pleasure -- Joe's problem is solved. Joe's love theme swells triumphant. At the same time, Shirley half-rises, trying to force Joe's head down, her own on top. The issue is joined. Shirley has named the game. Her objective is to force Joe onto his back. Joe's objective is to retain his initiative. Camera ignores the classic action on the central front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical maneuvers... \n... Joe's elbows pinning her shoulders... \n... her eyes bright, accepting the challenge... \n... his tight smile revealing clenched teeth... \n... her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm... \n... Joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly... \n... Shirley laughing triumphantly... \n... his hand closing on her wrist... \n... her talon-nails clawing the air... \n... her toes walking up his calf... \n... her legs suddenly locking around his knees... \n... her free hand grabbing his hair... \n... her shoulder rising as she forces his head back... \n... her lips pressing down on his... \n... his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh... \n... her eyes popping, teeth clamping his ear lobe... \n... his hand catching her ankle... \n... her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams... \n... her foot appearing upside down beside her face... \n... her talon-nails furrowing flesh, drawing blood... \n... his head rearing back, roaring... \n... both rolling to the floor, out of view... \n... her feet suddenly flying up into view... \n... her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket... \n... her other hand wildly exploring Joe's back... \n... her ankles locking spasmodically... \n... her eyes and mouth wide, gaping... \n... the blanket suddenly ripping free, flying into the air as her arm flings itself around Joe... \nRATSO What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ! \nJOE Who? \nRATSO I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know? \nRatso is trembling so violently that the sou, starts to slop over. Joe takes it and sets it on the table. \nJOE Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what. \nRATSO No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor. \nJOE Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me? \nRATSO I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance. \nJOE You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida? \nRATSO I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask. \nJOE Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this. \nRATSO I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable. \nJoe sets his Stetson on his head. \nJOE When I put you on that bus down to Florida tonight, that'll be the happiest day of my life! \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY \nJoe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl away while he waits, hearing a phone ring. Then the phone is answered by a woman's voice. \nJOE Hey, Shirley... Miss who? Oh, yeah, well, when will Missus Gardner be home? ... I'm a friend of hers, a goddam good friend... Shee-it, I can't wait till then... \nJoe hangs up while the answering service's voice is still talking. The match has burned out. Joe flips it away. \nINSERT \nHeadline -- WALTER P. BOX TAKES NEW YORK BY SURPRISE. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - DUSK \nJoe loiters outside a gag headline print shop, his eyes following a man in homburg and chesterfield. \nEXT./INT. METROPOLE - DUSK \nJoe lingers momentarily, identifying with the violence in a jazz drummer, his eyes searching for a pickup. \nINT. ARCADE - DUSK \nJoe tests his skills in a shoot-down with a large metal cowboy and kills him, a recorded voice sneaks, \"Got me!\" as the cowboy slumps. Joe glances off as he hears polite applause... \nTOWNY'S VOICE Bravo... \n... TOWNY -- a stout, round-faced man -- clasps Joe's hand between both of his own, like an old friend. \nTOWNY How are you? (more quietly) Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago. Call me Towny. I'm here to attend a paper manufacturers' convention and, frankly, to have a little fun, dammit... \nTowny grips Joe's elbow, almost forcibly leading him away. \nEXT. SIDE STREET WEST OF BROADWAY - DUSK \nTowny's face appears huge at Joe's shoulder. \nTOWNY This is my first night in town and I'll consider it a ghastly omen clouding my entire ten days, if you don't consent to have dinner with me. Anywhere you like... \nJoe is rehearsing the speech in the bathroom mirror. \nJOE Well, he is, he's sicker'n shee-it. And I've gotta get him South quick as I can... \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY \nJoe stands in a long line, glancing impatiently at the clock while Ratso waits on a bench, wrapped in his blanket. \nINT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nTowny is stretched out on the couch, staring morosely. \nTOWNY I was so childish with her. \nJoe moves into frame past camera, standing in front of him, so that we can see the scene from behind Joe's waist. \nJOE What d'you want? \nTOWNY What? \nJOE What you got me up here for? \nTOWNY Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please. \nJOE You want me to leave? \nTOWNY No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise. \nJOE I'm going to Florida. \nTOWNY This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please... \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY \nJoe's face is expectant, next in line at the ticket window. He nods reassuringly toward Ratso. \nINT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nJoe's face is puzzled then angry as Towny takes a Saint Christopher medal from his sack and hands it to Joe. His eyes are looking past Joe, his speech out of sync. \nTOWNY Please take it. You don't have to be Catholic. Saint Christopher is the patron saint of all travelers. I want you to have it. For helping me be good. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY \nIt's Joe's turn. The clerk looks at him expectantly. \nINT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nJoe's voice is angry. \nJOE Listen, I gotta have money. \nTOWNY Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here... \nTowny hurries across the room to the bedside table. Beside the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman wearing a hearing-aid. Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost knocking the lamp off the table in his fright. Pressed against the table, protecting but calling attention to his wallet, Towny holds out the bill. \nTOWNY (CONT'D) Here. Don't even thank me. \nJOE (takes the bill) I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars. \nTOWNY I simply don't have it, Joe. \nJOE Get outta my way. \nTOWNY You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there. \n", "test1_input": "EXT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL - DAY \nFrom a low angle -- identical with the postcard photograph -- an unseen hand scrawls a huge X--- THIS IS ME. Camera zooms up to a close-up of Joe at the window. \nEXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY \nFrom on high -- as though Joe were watching himself -- the Stetson moves through a crowd of Fifth Avenue shoppers... \nEXT. GLASS BUILDING - DAY \n... passing a glass bank, lady tellers counting money... \nEXT. CAR SHOWROOM - DAY \n... passing a display of imported luxury cars... \nEXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY \n... passing a window which features a single gem -- pausing as horns blast O.S. and a mod blonde in a stalled sports car motions to Joe -- she needs a push. Joe grins, glances at himself in the window, runs a comb through his hair, then turns back to see a cop helping the mod blonde. \nEXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY \nJoe's heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury apartment houses. O.S. The torchy woman's voice sings Joe's love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a fire bell, a screech of brakes. Joe's spirits rise as he hears the tic-tac-tic of high heels overtaking the heavy click-clack-click of his boots. He adjusts his pace to arrive at the corner at the same time as a smart and -- in Joe's eyes -- very RICH LADY. Joe grins boyishly, holding his Stetson over his heart. \nJOE Beg pardon, ma'am, I'm new here in town, just in from Houston, Texas, and looking for the Statue of Liberty. \nThe delicate profile gives no signs of hearing. Joe follows her to the parkway in the middle of the avenue. There she stops and turns, neither friendly nor hostile. \nRICH LADY Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty? \nJOE Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business! \nRICH LADY I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line... \nJOE You sure are a pretty lady. \nThe Rich Lady tries to frown, taken aback, blushing. \nRICH LADY You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all. \nJOE No, ma'am, I'm not. \nRICH LADY Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? \nA twinkle of amusement and sympathy reveals the age lines at the corner of her eyes. Then she continues on quickly, just as the light turns. Joe's view is blocked for a moment by traffic, then he sees... \n... the Rich Lady, newly aware of her flanks as she climbs the steps of a brownstone and searches for her key. Still from Joe's viewpoint, he sees himself move into frame and follow the Rich Lady up the steps. The love theme swells O.S. as the Rich Lady leads him into the house and closes the door... \n... leaving Joe standing alone on the parkway island, surrounded by towering wealth. The love theme continues over... \nEXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY \n... a pair of high-heeled pink slippers, walking a miniature poodle -- slowing slightly, reacting to Joe's cowboy boots as they pass, pause and turn back. \nCASS'S VOICE Hurry up, Baby. Do um goody-goods for Mama. \nJoe grins, holding his hat over his heart as he approaches CASS TREHUNE, a blonde lady in a tight black dress, with the look of a movie star who wrecked her career with food. \nJOE Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty... \nCASS You're hoping to get a look at what? \nJOE The Statue of Liberty. \nCASS It's up in Central Park, taking a leak.

APARTMENT HOUSE ELEVATOR - DAY \nCass holds the DOOR OPEN button till Joe enters the elevator, then the doors close with a soft expensive little kllooosh and Cass turns with the smile of a very tiny girl... \nCASS Hi. \n... her lips closing on Joe's as the poodle yaps shrilly at their feet. Superimposed, almost subliminally, a golden dollar sign appears, halating like a star, and the bell of a pinball machine rings O.S. \nINT. CASS'S APARTMENT - DAY \nA princess telephone is ringing on a gold and white desk. Cass runs to grab it... \nCASS Hello? \n... as Joe steps from the elevator, which opens directly onto Cass's penthouse. Cass beckons him toward her, hooks a finger into his neckerchief and pulls his mouth toward hers while she talks on the phone. \nCASS (CONT'D) Morey? Hi-ee, honey... \nCass gurgles happily as her free hand unbuckles Joe's garrison belt. \nCASS (CONT'D) I'm just out of breath, honey, running to catch the phone. \nAs her fingers reach for Joe's zipper, cut to... \n... Joe's hand unzipping her dress. \nCASS (CONT'D) I was walking Baby. Him got to do him goody-goods, right? \nThe poodle tugs at Joe's slacks until they fall. Cass steers her ear to Joe's mouth, shuddering deliciously. \nCASS (CONT'D) Oh God, oh stop. I can't stand that. I just die... (quickly into phone) It's Baby, Morey. Him trying to say hello. Say hello to Morey, Baby. \nCass holds the phone toward the yapping poodle, twisting herself against Joe as she wriggles out of her dress, passing the phone from one hand to the other. \nCASS (CONT'D) Okay, old goosie? Now lookie, when do you want me to meet you? Whatever you say. I'll take a nap, watch TV, you know, kill time. Okay, but just one, a big wet one. \nCass hangs up. The poodle yaps hysterically, disentangling himself from her tumbling dress -- hops onto the couch glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes O.S. \nINT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThe poodle bounces onto the bed -- remaining long enough to establish a TV REMOTE CONTROL TUNER lying on the satin coverlet -- then leaps down in panic as he hears Joe and Cass explode into the bedroom, laughing lustily... \n... the remote control tuner buried suddenly under the full flesh of Cass's hip, activating... \n... a twenty-five-inch television screen, blasting at full volume... \n... Cass's eyes widening, profoundly impressed... \nCASS Ye gods... \n... the images and sound of the television set flicking joyfully from channel to channel... \n... Joe laughing, engulfed by Cass's abundance... \n... Cass wild-eyed, overflowing the frame... \n... a gleaming slot machine -- three Sahara cowgirls clicking into line for jackpot -- silver dollars overflowing the frame... \nEXT.

Joe has started up before he notices Ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the stairs, struggling to catch his breath. His face and hair are wet with perspiration, his lips lavender-blue. \nIn swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in Ratso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak or offer reassurance. \nJOE Better dry your hair some. You sweating all over the goddam place. \nJoe pulls out his shirttail, grabs Ratso by the neck and rubs his head dry. \nJOE (CONT'D) You got a comb? \nRATSO Don't need a comb. \nJOE Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess. \nJoe hands Ratso his own comb. Ratso swipes at his tangled hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb. He hands the comb back, tugs at his hair with his fingers, pats it in place, then looks back into Joe's eyes. \nRATSO Okay? I look okay? \nIn a moment of silence, distant sounds can be heard -- a siren, the grinding teeth of a garbage truck, the twang of an electric guitar upstairs at the party -- then Ratso makes a quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs, pulling himself on the bannister. \nINT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT \nA bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter -- electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up, showing the murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters, LOVE WAS GROOVY -- GROOVY IS DEAD. Joe shouts over the amplified music. \nJOE Better get a hold of someone and tell them I'm here. \nRatso points to his ear -- he can't hear -- following Joe across the room. The huge loft is crowded with a random selection, gathered to serve as dress extras in an underground film. The party is the scene. The MacAlbertsons merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen, with cameras strategically placed to record the happening... \n... Hansel with tape recorder, Gretel with hand-held camera drifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a detached, whimsical fashion. Gretel turns her camera on Joe and Ratso as they approach. \nJOE (CONT'D) Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I... \nRATSO Rico. Rico Rizzo. \nGretel smiles without recognition. Hansel gestures vaguely. \nHANSEL Do you need anything? I mean there's beer and so forth. Whatever your thing is... \nThe twins move away together, pausing to confer with the operator of a tripod camera -- focused on an emaciated flower girl with long hair and dirty feet, stretched in a sarcophagus, clutching a dead daffodil, her eyes glazed. Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head -- LOVE! \nRATSO If you want the word on that brother and sister act, I'll give you the word. That Hansel's a fag and Gretel's got the hots for herself. So who cares, right? Load up on the salami... \nRatso heads for the refreshment table. Joe starts after him but pauses, intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a light show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies projected against abstract currents of color and strobe light... \n... a bored fat lady in a muu-muu, squatted like a Buddha at a low table, rolling joints for the guests. She lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to watch the show. Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what it is... \nJOE Shee-it, this is one helluva party! \n... glancing around at the others, imitating their techniques -- the quick inhaler, who follows with sharp gulps of air - the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils -- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy, starting to laugh at the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action around him slowing almost imperceptibly, overcranked -- a veil of smoke hanging over the fat woman's face, transforming her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joe's head, relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face, spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand, grinning at... \n... a serious young technician handling the light show, scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh... \n... Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back to the crowded loft, fascinated to see... \n... a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end of the loft, photographing the scene below... \n... a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the style of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle, predatory eyes searching the crowd... \n... Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the buffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware of Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he steals, turning away casually, disinterested... \n... Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming... \n... Shirley in fleeting close-up, gone in an instant, reappearing... \nINT. MACALBERTSON BATHROOM - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "SHIRLEY I can tell, can't you? \nJOE Yeah, oh yeah. \nSHIRLEY What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you? \nJoe grins, watching Shirley's lips move, unable to keep her in sync, startled to hear Ratso's voice. \nRATSO'S VOICE She's hooked... \nINT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT \nJoe realizes he is back at the party, Ratso whispering hoarsely. \nRATSO ... I'd say she was good for ten bucks, but I'll ask for twenty... \nBut Joe is watching with terrible fascination as Hansel and Gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus. \nSHIRLEY'S VOICE Did you know? We were going to make it? \nJoe glances down to see himself flanked by Ratso and Shirley. \nRATSO You really want to do business? \nSHIRLEY Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ? \nThe flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped in black paint and smears a huge X across LOVE. Joe laughs. \nHANSEL'S VOICE Why are you laughing, Joe? \nHansel holds a microphone toward Joe, who shrugs, grinning at Ratso and Shirley. Gretel's camera moves down Joe's body. \nHANSEL Are you for real, Joe? \nJOE Well, I ain't a f'real cowboy, but I'm one hell of a stud! \nShirley glances at Ratso, who nods, whispering in her ear. \nRATSO A very expensive stud. And I happen to be his manager. \nThe scene -- from Joe's viewpoint -- becomes increasingly confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the center of attention in his own blown mind... \n... Shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body, lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips... \nSHIRLEY It's too much -- to come face to face with a walking talking sex fantasy -- to buy a man's -- God! \n... the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera... \nSHIRLEY'S VOICE I can't wait to tell my man Monday. I should be taking notes. Look at my arm! \n... Shirley's talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh on her tanned arm... \nRATSO'S VOICE I gotta sit down. I feel crummy. \nRatso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing one in Ratso's hand Gretel photographing his reaction... \nSHIRLEY'S VOICE Eat it -- a man in your line of work has to keep his strength up... \n... Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate, watching him bite into it... \nSHIRLEY It's fantastic, now I know, everything you do has sexual implications. If I you know, bought it -- could I take pictures of you naked? That's part of it, isn't it, kinky kinda things? \n... the tall black girl and a few others are trying to promote an orgy. A scrofulous old wino dances spastically, working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to two girls dancing together... \n", "test2_id": 379, "test3_input": "The bus tires sing as it speeds South. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY \nJoe and Ratso have reversed places, putting Ratso by the window. Joe watches a middle-aged couple try on their new straw hats, unaware that Joe is watching them. \nRATSO You get your first palm tree in South Carolina. \nJOE How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that? \nRATSO I read it. \nJOE Shee-it. You believe all you read? \nEXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe metal grating rings as the bus soars onto it. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT \nTwo aging young ladies in brand-new resort wear are casually examining Joe, along with the other men on the bus, but Joe is frowning at Ratso, who shivers despite the bright sun. \nJOE If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more? \nRATSO I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway? \nJOE Keep the goddam blanket on. \nRATSO I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you? \nJOE Sounds like they knew you. \nRATSO Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico? \nJoe nods. Ratso closes his eyes, momentarily at peace. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN \nThe bus passes a Florida hotel sign too swiftly to read it. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAWN \nJoe frowns in his sleep, awakens, lifts his Stetson to see Ratso wide awake, in misery, wiping tears from his eyes. \nJOE Hey -- whatsa matter? \nRATSO (barely audible) I'm wet. \nJOE You're what? \nRATSO I wet my pants! My seat's all wet. \nJOE Hell, don't cry about it! \nRATSO Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself. \nJoe laughs suddenly, uncontrollably. \nRATSO (CONT'D) I'm falling apart, that's funny? \nJOE (nods, laughing) You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule. \nRatso begins to laugh with Joe as if it were the funniest thing they'd ever heard. Then Ratso's face pales as he starts to choke and cough. Joe pats him on the back. \nJOE (CONT'D) Hey, what size pants you wear? \n", "test3_true": "The bus is parked in the distance. Joe comes from a clothing store, bare-headed, wearing plain slacks and sport-shirt. He carries the boots, Stetson and cowboy suit in one hand, a bundle under his arm. He dumps his cowboy regalia in the trash bin of a sandwich stand and calls to the WAITRESS. \nJOE Couple crullers'n coffee to go. \nThe Waitress draws coffee, wraps crullers. \nWAITRESS Where you from? \nJOE New York. \nJoe pays. She smiles, gives him change. Joe smiles, starts on toward the bus, hardly aware that he has accomplished something rare and remarkable for Joe -- a simple human contact without fear or threat, a pleasant everyday happening. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY \nJoe and Ratso have moved to the seat farthest back, wider than the others. Joe blocks the view of the other passengers as he helps Ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a Florida shirt. In the middle of the operation, Ratso dozes off. Joe shakes his head, scowling, annoyed, but continues, lifting Ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist. Ratso awakens as Joe zips the fly. \nRATSO Hey, what the hell you doing? \nJOE I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing? \nThey both smile. It isn't funny enough to laugh at. Joe arranges the blanket, takes out a package of cigarettes, glances at Ratso and puts it away. \nEXT. TRAVELING SHOT WITH BUS - DAY \nPalm trees are streaking past the window. The sun is glaring hot. A group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the bus as it passes. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY \nRatso's eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep. Joe leans across to pull down the shade. He hesitates a moment, watching... \n... past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to work, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as Joe is now dressed... \n... then Joe lowers the blind and seats himself. Ratso nods slightly, his voice practically inaudible. \nRATSO Thanks, Joe. \nJOE Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay? \nJoe glances at Ratso, but there is no response. Surreptitiously, Joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face away from Ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand as he smokes. \nJOE (CONT'D) Yeah, guess that's what I'm gonna do. \nThey ride for a moment in semi-darkness, Joe smoking, looking at the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades down. Joe turns, checking the blanket around Ratso, noticing that Ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward position. Joe leans over to straighten Ratso's head, blocking our view for a moment. Then Joe leans back, frowning, thoughtful. We still do not see Ratso's face. Joe rises slowly, starting forward in the bus... \n... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he reaches... \n... the DRIVER, staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the Driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly. \nDRIVER Yes, sir? \nJOE, My friend's dead in the back seat. \nDRIVER Your friend's what in the back seat? \nJOE Dead. Dead as a doornail. \nDRIVER Is this some kind of... \nHe glances at Joe, then pulls off the road and stands up. \nDRIVER (CONT'D) Okay, folks, everything's fine. Nothing to worry about. \nThe passengers crane their necks as Joe follows the Driver to the rear of the bus. The passengers at the rear are staring ahead, trying not to see what is going on. The Driver touches Ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it. \n", "test3_id": 380}

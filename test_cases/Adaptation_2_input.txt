LAROCHE We'll get into plant multiplication. Buy little ones, turn 'em into big ones, sell 'em at a profit. Simple plant multiplication for the masses. 
BAXLEY John, we're thinking maybe now's a good time for you to take a few weeks. 
LAROCHE I don't need a vacation, Buster. 
BAXLEY It's a good time.   Things are slow. 
Laroche stares at Buster.   Buster stares back. 
LAROCHE Y'know, the guys on my crew here, all they do is smoke weed all day. I been meaning to talk to you about that. So if it's a question of productivity -- 
INT. VAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Laroche weaves through traffic.   Orlean holds on. 
LAROCHE They're gonna fire me. Goddamn politics. Crazy White Man's bad publicity. (pounds steering wheel) I can't believe I'm dealing with this! (pounds steering wheel) Like I could give a damn. If they fire me, I'll sue. I already did some legal research on this when I was doing the other shit. They can't fire me. And I ain't going to quit. 
MONTAGE 
Gray skies. Kaufman drives his rental car: he looks at the Seminole Nursery, the Collier County Courthouse, Laroche's house. He drives through swampy terrain. He walks around at an orchid show, he attends a slide-show orchid lecture. It's all dull. He ends up sitting on a bench on an empty beach, staring out at the ocean. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Orlean dials the phone.   It rings for a long time.    Finally: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) (groggy) Yeah? 
ORLEAN John, it's Susan. (waits for response) Orlean. (waits) So, I was just wondering if you might be willing to talk some more. 
LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE) What about? 
Orlean rolls her eyes. 
ORLEAN C'mon, John, I'm trying to put together a book. Don't just abandon me down here. 
LAROCHE I'm no longer interested in orchids. I'm pursuing other avenues. I apologize for any inconvenience this might cause you. 
Orlean is silent, taps her fingers on the bedside table. 
LAROCHE Thank you for your time. 
Laroche hangs up. Orlean sits there for a moment, flips through her list of orchid collector names. 
EXT. EMPTY BEACH - DAY 
Kaufman sits on the bench, looking out at the ocean. An attractive, spandexed couple skate by, chatting in German. He watches the woman, hoping for a look, for something. He doesn't get it. They're gone. A tan older man sits on the bench, lights a cigarette. Kaufman continues to look at the ocean, even though he feels the guy's eyes on him. He doesn't want to engage. 
GUY ON BENCH We could use the rain, huh? 
Kaufman nods, looking at the ocean.      Pause. 
GUY ON BENCH (cont'd) So you from around here? 
Kaufman shakes his head "no."   Pause. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GUY ON BENCH (cont'd) So where then? 
KAUFMAN California. 
GUY ON BENCH (excitedly) Yeah? I'm moving to L.A. I just wrote a screenplay. I sent it to a lot of agents. But if they turn me down, I'll go there and market it myself. I used to be in marketing in New York, so I know exactly how to sell this thing. (beat) Where's a nice place to live if you don't have a car? 
KAUFMAN You kind of need a car. I guess West Hollywood would be okay. 
GUY ON BENCH So you recommend West Hollywood then. 
KAUFMAN I'm not recommending it. 
Pause. 
GUY ON BENCH I moved down here for a change, and I wrote the screenplay. Just like that. It's a great idea. 
The old guy waits for a response.    He gets none. 
GUY ON BENCH (cont'd) It's about a mob guy, but it's not your regular mob story. There's a twist. A cop tells this mob guy's wife that the mob guy's cheating on her. But the truth is, the cop's lying because he wants her for himself. See, they used to go together in high school. (waits for response, then:) You know anything about screenplays? 
Kaufman shakes his head.

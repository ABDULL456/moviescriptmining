JILL Hello? 
Pause. 
DUNCAN (O.S.) It's me. 
JILL I know. Who are you? 
Pause. No answer. 
JILL I won't be here much longer. The doctor and his wife are coming home soon. 
DUNCAN (O.S.) I know. 
JILL Can you see me? 
DUNCAN (O.S.) Yes. 
JILL (turning toward the window) I'm sorry I turned the lights down. It didn't work anyway. I can turn them back up if you like -- 
DUNCAN (O.S.) Don't. 
JILL Don't? (beat) You've really scared me. Is that what you wanted? (beat) Is that what you wanted? 
DUNCAN (O.S.) No. 
JILL What do you want? 
DUNCAN (O.S.) Your blood... all over me. 
Pause. Jill is terrified. 
JILL You don't know me. You don't know who I am or where I live. I'll get Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him or the police. 
DUNCAN (O.S.) You've called the police? 
Pause. Jill searches for some way of answering him. 
JILL I want to talk to you. 
The line goes dead. Jill hangs up. She stands. She starts to shake. 
The phone rings and Jill snatches it up. 
JILL Leave me alone! 
SACKER (O.S.) Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker! Listen to me! (beat) We've traced the call. It's coming from within the house. A squad car's on its way over there now... just get out of that house! 
Jill hangs up. She stands frozen in shock. Several seconds go by. She doesn't move. 
Then the phone rings. She turns and tiptoes toward the front door. Halfway there, the phone stops ringing. She pauses for a second, then continues. 
INT. FRONT HALL 
Jill reaches the front door. Carefully, quietly, she turns the bolt. Then O.S. she hears a creak. She turns and looks up the staircase. At the top, a door is opening. Someone is coming out! A mumbling sound is heard on the sound track. 
Jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it. It opens, but only an inch. The chain is still across it! She frantically works to get the chain free. After agonizing seconds, the chain falls clear and the door swings open. 
Standing there on the other side of the door, is a police Detective, JOHN CLIFFORD. (We have cut ahead in time some twenty or thirty minutes.) Behind him on the street, several patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb, their domelights silently flashing. 
CLIFFORD Are the parents here yet? 
COP'S VOICE (O.S.) Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes ago. 
CLIFFORD Christ! (beat) What a homecoming! 
COP'S VOICE (O.S.) They wanted to talk to someone. I asked them to wait until you got here. Come on in. 
Clifford sighs and steps into the front hall. The door is closed by the uniformed COP with whom Clifford has been speaking. The cop is a man in his thirties. His name is CHARLES GARBER. Garber and Clifford stand in the front hall and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move around them. In the living room beyond can be seen several other POLICEMEN, Dr. Mandrakis and his wife. 
GARBER We were only a block away when the call went out. When we got here, the guy was still waiting upstairs in the children's bedroom. He was covered with blood. 
CLIFFORD Blood?

LINDENMEYER (backing away fast) Get that fucking thing away from me! 
REILLY (laughing) You're...such a wimp. 
He grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the snake. The half of the snake which drops to the floor stops moving. 
But the half still in Reilly's hand begins REGENERATING a new tail. Literally growing a new one. Lindenmeyer can't believe his eyes. He studies the snake closely. 
REILLY (CONT'D) Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea. 
LINDENMEYER (in awe) It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules... 
REILLY (proudly) Coordinated by polymer neural net. 
LINDENMEYER (touching the snake) It feels so.. .real. 
REILLY It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs... (a beat) It's a physiological machine. 
LINDENMEYER (awed) This is supposed to be years away. 
REILLY As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away. 
LINDENMEYER (restraining himself) How do you kill it? 
REILLY Separate the character module from the neural net... 
Using Lindenmeyer's scissors, he cuts off the snake's head and removes a small character module connected to the base of the neural net. The snake stops moving. It "dies." 
REILLY (CONT'D) ... and you get nanodeath. (discarding the snake) Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones. 
LINDENMEYER Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is. 
REILLY I know. (a beat) I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you... 
He exits. As Lindenmeyer reaches for the Sheila 3.2 character module, Sid 6.7 appears on the screen in front of him and winks. 
SID 6.7 You catching my drift? 
LINDENMEYER I think I understand what you have in mind... 
Peeling the label off the Sid 6.7 character module, Lindenmeyer removes the module from its slot. Sid 6.7 disappears from the screen.

REILLY 
opening his office door for Lindenmeyer fifteen minutes later. Reilly immediately double bolts the door behind him and leads Lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry. As well as a large aquarium full of nanopythons. 
LINDENMEYER You need a maid. 
REILLY What I need is a nymphomaniac. 
He removes a tarp from a large, rectangular, metallic tank with a circular window in the middle of it. 
Clear, plastic tubing, which branches into hundreds of increasingly smaller and smaller branches, floats in electrified fluid. The tubing is a synthetic human nervous system. 
INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE 
Reilly turns to Lindenmeyer. 
REILLY Where's the Sheila 3.2 module? 
Lindenmeyer hands him the labelless character module. Reilly opens the "incubator." 
INSIDE THE INCUBATOR 
Reilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the synthetic nervous system. 
The polymer neural net instantly crackles with life. It grows around the module. Cells (nanomechanisms) immediately begin adhering to the tubing. Forming the beginnings of a skeletal architecture. 
INSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE 
Lindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window. 
REILLY It feeds on what is basically amniotic fluid. (a beat) In eight hours, we are going to have ourselves one hell of a play toy. 
Off Lindenmeyer's wicked, but somewhat anxious, smile, we

INSIDE PARKER'S CRAMPED PRISON CELL 
It's night. Light is dim. His bed is empty. The wall next to it is completely bare, except for the five Christmas cards sent each year by Chief Cox.

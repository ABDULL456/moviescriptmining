Suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple. They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and stands eyeing them severely. 
NURSE Madam, your mother craves a word with you. 
We see that the party is breaking up. But for groups of die-hard revellers, the room is nearly empty. 
NURSE (CONT.) Come, let's away. 
She takes firm control of her charge. 
Juliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to follow as he trails them across the room. 
CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door, but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase that arcs around to the mezzanine level. They join a vexed Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris. 
Inaudible words are exchanged. Juliet flickers her eyes nervously to Romeo. 
CUT TO: Romeo. He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure. 
CUT TO: Gloria. Catching Juliet's interest in the boy, she indicates to her daughter to 'COME ALONG'. 
CUT TO: Romeo; a dawning realisation. 
ROMEO (under his breath) Is she a Capulet? 
CUT TO: Juliet. She stops and turns back. 
CUT TO: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she is. 
CUT TO: Juliet. The Nurse whispers in her ear. 
NURSE His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy. 
An orchestral treatment of Joy Division's "Love will tear us Apart" swells; 
HOLD ON: Juliet. Like a cloud passing across the sun, a dark coldness descends upon her. 
CUT TO: Mercutio. He throws himself upon the shell shocked Romeo. 
MERCUTIO Away, begone, the sport is at its best. 
Mercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door. 
ROMEO Ay so I fear, 
A covert glance over his shoulder. 
ROMEO (CONT.) The more is my unrest. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. 
Mercutio bundles Romeo through the front door and down the stairs to the waiting getaway car. 
INT. CAPULET MANSION - STAIRS ALCOVE WINDOW - NIGHT. 
CUT TO: Juliet. Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the stairs, she breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE. NIGHT. 
CUT TO: Mercutio's convertible and its noisy confederacy joining the line of departing limos. 
A huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in giant words "CAPULET." 
As the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo turns. Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the mystery girl high up in the tower. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT. 
CLOSE ON: Juliet leaning out of the tower window. Brilliant sparkles light in her eyes. 
PUSH IN: We hear her secret whisper: 
JULIET My only love, sprung from my only hate. Too early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is to me 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE DRIVE. NIGHT. 
CUT TO: JULIET'S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo, through the falling curtain of fiery embers. 
JULIET (CONT.)(V/O) That I must love a loathed enemy. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT. 
Warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks. Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass. 
CRANE DOWN: The side of the building past revellers who don't know when to leave. Standing in the front doorway is someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing Romeo. It is Tybalt. The music darkens as we push through the smoky wind. 
TYBALT I will withdraw. But this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall. 
INT. MERCUTIO'S CAR. NIGHT. 
Caught in the jam of departing vehicles, Mercutio's car crawls along the bridge that links Capulet island with the mainland. The boys sing along raucously with the radio. 
BOYS "I am a pretty piece of flesh, I am a pretty piece of flesh..."

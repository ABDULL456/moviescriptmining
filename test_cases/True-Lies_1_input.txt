Harry doesn't have a G-suit or a helmet of anything.  He just has his walky on his belt. 
INSIDE THE CRAMPED COCKPIT, Harry looks around for the lever which vectors the thrust.  Finds it, and sets it to 90 degrees (vertical).  He bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle up to FULL. 
GIB (to pilot) It'll be fine.  He's got hundreds of hours in Harriers.  Joint-ops, cross-training and all that. 
AGENT Harry can fly anything. 
The big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble-bee. 
GIB He's a little rusty.  It's like riding a bicycle .  .  .  you never forget.  Uh .  .  .  I'd seek shelter! 
It drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way. At about six feet above the ground it slides sideways, clips the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar.  It lifts unsteadily straight into the sky.  It turns around 180. 
GIB He's got it. 
HARRY Sorry. 
Harry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust-nozzles turn, accelerating the plane forward. 
300   EXT. CAUSEWAY - DAY 
Gib is standing, watching Harry go.  He never believes this guy.  Harry's voice comes over the walky... 
HARRY Tell Helen what's going on.  Tell her I love her.  And ask the pilot where the button for the 20mm cannon is-- never mind.  I found it. 
The plane disappears toward Miami. 
301   EXT. HIGH RISE - MIAMI - DAY 
AN AERIAL SHOT, circling the building.  It is an unfinished building in the high rise district.  The Aerospatiale sits on the roof, its rotor turning slowly.  The street below is jammed with cars.  Honking horns echo up the glass canyons. 
302   EXT. STREET - DAY 
ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to clear the street around the building, setting up a perimeter two blocks away. 
303   INT. HIGH RISE - DAY 
INSIDE THE HIGH RISE the terrorists have barricaded themselves on the twentieth floor.  There are 12 TERRORISTS, all with automatic weapons.  Occasionally one of them will fire a burst down a stairwell with an AK-47.  Miami-Dade SWAT team members are deployed in the stairwell but are keeping their distance. 
304   INT. HIGH RISE - ON THE 21ST FLOOR - DAY 
Malik is sequestered with the bomb.  It sits on the floor, still in its shipping case.  Dana stands nearby, looking scares.  She is not ties up.  Where can she go? 
She watches Malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key. He has a TV set up on some crates, and we see that his video- tapes demands are running on CNN.  Harry's face fills the screen, verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat.  He is identified at the bottom of the screen as HARRY TASKER, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION.  Dana stares at her father's face on the national news.  It's like a bad dream.  She has been crying but she is fairly composed now. 
DANA I have to go to the bathroom. 
The terrorists ignore her.  A terrified ACTION NEWS REPORTER and his CAMERAMAN, under guard by TWO TERRORISTS, are hastily setting up to shoot Malik. CAMERAMAN Tape is rolling. 
MALIK This is a communique from Crimson Jihad.  You have heard from your own expert.  You have seen the Holy fire with your own eyes.  Do not force us to destroy this city.  And do not try to use force against us.  I can trigger this bomb instantly.  All I have to do is turn that key... (he points fiercely at the bomb) ... and five million of your people will die. 
The reporter glances down, nervously. 
REPORTER What key? 
MALIK (pointing like the guy's blind) That key right there! 
Malik looks down.  The key is gone. 
MALIK (to his men) Someone has stolen the key! 
He turns, looking around wildly.  Malik then sees Dana running for the stairwell to the roof.  He pulls a pistol and shoots at her, but hits the wall as she bangs through the door.  He runs after her. 
305   EXT. BUILDING / ROOF - DAY 
ON THE ROOF, Malik bursts through the stairwell door.  His TWO MEN have followed him.  Malik stops suddenly when he sees-- Dana standing at the edge of the roof.  She is holding the ARMING KEY by its chain.  Dangling it over the edge.  He signals to his men not to fire. 
DANA (terrified, but thinking) You shoot me, this'll fall. 
Malik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally.  She backs up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof. Malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest. 
DANA Don't come any closer.  I'll drop it!  I swear to God. 
MALIK If you drop it, I will have no reason not to kill you. 
He advances, calling her bluff.  She backs away from him along the edge. 
MALIK Come on, child.  Give me the key. (smiling) Don't you want to live?  I give you my word. 
DANA No way you whacko. 
She reaches the corner of the building.  Her back touches something.  it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting building supplies.  Careful to keep the key dangling over open space, Dana climbs up on the lattice-work boom and moves out beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off Malik.  She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking clearly. 
Malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her.  He knows she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun.  It is a game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom.  Dana puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better.  It is windy and the boom is swinging. 
306   INT. 20TH FLOOR - DAY 
The Crimson Jihad warriors hear a thunderous, shrieking roar and look toward the window. 
307   EXT. HIGH RISE - DAY 
RISING INTO VIEW, LIKE A GARGOYLE FROM HELL, IS THE HARRIER. It fills the windows completely, hovering only a few feet outside.  The terrorists raise their AK-47s to fire just as Harry hits the 20mm nose-cannon.

CLOSE SHOT 
stage. Miss Martin thrusts her head out of the window. 
MISS MARTIN Driver? Driver, what's the matter? 
DAVE Nothin'. Restin' hosses. Git out and stretch yore laigs if you want. 
MISS MARTIN Resting horses? What for? I can see with my own eyes it's downhill. 
Dave brightens visibly at this challenge. 
DAVE You in such an all-fired hurry, lady? 
MISS MARTIN Certainly, we are in a hurry. 
DAVE (beaming) Well -- we'll hurry some. 
His whip cracks like a rifle shot and the startled horses literally jerk the heavy stage over the rim and down the grade. 
LONG SHOT 
grade, with the stagecoach bounding and reeling down the narrow road and around the sharp bends. 
CLOSE FULL SHOT 
Dave and Rocklin on stage as it thunders downhill. Dave is leaning out and listening hopefully for the outcries from within. None come. Rocklin is hanging on with both hands and mildly amused. 
INT. STAGECOACH - DAY 
The two women are really being scrambled. 
EXT. STAGECOACH - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY 
CLOSE TWO SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin. Rocklin is as calm as if he were walking. Dave is more and more pleased with himself. He again leans out to listen. 
LONG SHOT 
grade, with coach approaching in b.g. In f.g. the road narrows and makes a sharp turn at the very edge of a precipice. There is no possible way of getting the coach safely around this turn except at a walk. 
LONG SHOT 
road, from point of view of driver's seat, establishing the same menace ahead. 
CLOSE TWO SHOT 
Dave and Rocklin, as Rocklin glances out of the corner of his eyes as if wondering whether or not Dave is too drunk to perceive the disaster. He makes no move, however, to advise or interfere. 
FULL SHOT 
road; at danger corner, as stage comes in. At the very last second, Dave pulls in the horses and negotiates the turn in safety. 
CLOSE SHOT 
stage. Dave grins at Rocklin, then listens for the outcry he expects from the women within. The old lady's head bobs out of the window. 
MISS MARTIN (fiercely) Now what's the matter. Why are we stopping again? 
Old Dave's mouth drops open, and as Rocklin begins to grin at his discomfiture. 
DISSOLVE 
EXT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY 
FULL SHOT of lonely adobe which serves as a combination roadhouse, stage station and bar. As the coach rolls into f.g., a little Mexican boy (Pablo) runs out to change the horses. 
PABLO (as Rocklin swings down) Buenas noches, senor. 
ROCKLIN Buenas noches, amigo. 
PABLO (grinning at the friendly tone) Ha llegado anticipademente, senor. 
ROCKLIN Tuvimos suerte en haber llegado. 
He glances pointedly at Dave who is climbing down unsteadily and Pablo bursts out laughing. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT 
on door of coach. As Dave comes into shot, Miss Martin's head pops out of the window. 
DAVE (gruffly) We stop here. 
MISS MARTIN Why do we stop here? 
DAVE If you wanta eat and stretch yore laigs. 
MISS MARTIN Will you please stop referring to my legs! 
DAVE You got some, ain't you? 
He turns and lurches toward the roadhouse. 
INT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY 
FULL SHOT from doorway. It is a large barn-like room on one side of which is a bar. On the other side is a fireplace and a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches. Standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a wizened little man, dressed in an odd assortment of ragged garments of unrecognizable origin. On the counter is a travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and shovel. As Dave enters, the man (Zeke) turns around and reveals a face even hairier than Dave's.

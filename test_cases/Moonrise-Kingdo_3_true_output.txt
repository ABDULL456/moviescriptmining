Pause. Social Services puts down her pen. She clasps her hands together in front of her. She says finally: 
SOCIAL SERVICES Well, normally, we'd try to place him in another foster home, but that option is no longer available to us, in my opinion, with his case history -- which means he'll go to Juvenile Refuge. 
Captain Sharp exchanges a look with Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward interjects: 
SCOUT MASTER WARD What's that? An orphanage? 
Social Services frowns. She asks calmly: 
SOCIAL SERVICES Who's speaking? 
SCOUT MASTER WARD This is Scout Master Ward. 
Social Services refers to a document in her file-folder. She nods. 
SOCIAL SERVICES Right. An orphanage -- but the first step is the admissions panel requires a psychological evaluation to determine whether or not the boy's a candidate for institutional treatment or electroshock therapy. Beyond that -- 
CAPTAIN SHARP (INTERRUPTING) Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that be necessary? He's not violent. 
Social Services picks up the document. She points to it. 
SOCIAL SERVICES The report describes an assault with scissors. 
CAPTAIN SHARP (OBJECTING) That was the girl! Who did that. 
SOCIAL SERVICES (PAUSE) Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but that's not our job. OK? 
CAPTAIN SHARP (LONG PAUSE) OK. 
Social Service hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords out of their sockets. Scout Master Ward looks to Captain Sharp. Silence. 
Becky opens a tin of home-made lemon bars. Captain Sharp declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He looks completely enchanted. 
INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT 
The living room. There is a wicker rocking chair, a vase filled with wilted wildflowers, and a portrait of some 
Pilgrims hanging over a stone fireplace. Lionel, Murray, and Rudy sit together on the floor playing Parchesi. 
Mr. Bishop lurches into the doorway, shirtless. He carries an open bottle of red wine with a glass in one hand and a long- handled woodsman's axe in the other. 
MR. BISHOP I'll be out back. 
Lionel, Murray, and Lionel look up from their game. Mr. Bishop hesitates. He seems slightly disoriented. 
MR. BISHOP I'm going to find a tree to chop down. 
Mr. Bishop exits. Pause. Lionel rolls a pair of dice. 
INT. SUZY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT 
Old linoleum floor. Dark curtainless window. One bare light bulb. Suzy sits erect in the bathtub staring blankly into space. Mrs. Bishop washes her with a soapy sponge. Suzy's clothes and leather folder are in the corner with the kitten scratching at them. 
MRS. BISHOP I do know what you're feeling, Suzy-bean. I've had moments myself where I say: what am I doing here? Who made this decision? How could I allow myself to do something so stupid -- (WITH FEELING) -- and why is it still happening? We women are more emotional. You have to REMEMBER -- 
Suzy turns to Mrs. Bishop and interrupts: 
SUZY I hate you. 
MRS. BISHOP (HESITATES) Don't say "hate". 
SUZY Why not? I mean it. 
MRS. BISHOP You think you mean it. In this moment. You're trying to hurt me. 
SUZY Exactly. (PAUSE) I know what you do with that sad, dumb police man. You go to bed with him. 
Mrs. Bishop looks stunned. She says quietly: 
MRS. BISHOP He's not dumb, but I guess he is kind of sad. Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that. It's not appropriate for me to even acknowledge what I already just said.

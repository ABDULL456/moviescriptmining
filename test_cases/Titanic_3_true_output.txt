WOMAN 
Come back! Please! We know you can hear us. For God's sake! 
MAN 
Please... help us. Save one life! SAVE ON LIFE!

286 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN 
IN BOAT 6: Ruth has her ears covered against the wailing in the darkness. The first class women in the boat sit, stunned, listening to the sounds of hundreds screaming. 
HITCHINS 
They'll pull us right down I tell ya! 
MOLLY 
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go. 
(nobody moves) 
Well come on! 
The women won't meet her eyes. They huddle into their ermine wraps. 
MOLLY 
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more. 
HITCHINS 
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat! 
Ruth keeps her ears covered and her eyes closed, shutting it all out. 
287 IN BOAT ONE: Sir Cosmo and Lucile Duff-Gordon sit with ten other people in a boat that is two thirds empty. They are two hundred yards from the screaming in the darkness. 
FIREMAN HENDRICKSON 
We should do something. 
Lucile squeezes Cosmo's hand and pleads him with her eyes. She is terrified. 
SIR COSMO 
It's out of the question. 
The crewmembers, intimidated by a nobleman, acquiesce. They hunch guiltily, hoping the sound will stop soon. 
TWENTY BOATS, most half full, float in the darkness. None of them make a move.

288 EXT. OCEAN 
Jack and Rose drift under the blazing stars. The water is glassy, with only the faintest undulating swell. Rose can actually see the stars reflecting on the black mirror of the sea. 
Jack squeezes the water out of her long coat, tucking it in tightly around her legs. He rubs her arms. His face is chalk with in the darkness. A low MOANING in the darknes around them. 
ROSE 
It's getting quiet. 
JACK 
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized... 
Rose is unmoving, just staring into space. She knows the truth. There won't be any boats. Behind Jack she sees that Officer Wilde has stopped moving. He is slumped in his lifejacket, looking almost asleep. He has died of exposure already. 
JACK 
I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all this. 
She laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear. Rose finds his eyes in the dim light. 
ROSE 
I love you Jack. 
He takes her hand. 
JACK 
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it. 
ROSE 
I'm so cold. 
JACK 
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me? 
ROSE 
I can't feel my body. 
JACK 
Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
Jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak. 
JACK 
It brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm thankful. 
His voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart. But his eyes are unwavering. 
JACK 
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise. 
ROSE 
I promise. 
JACK 
Never let go. 
ROSE 
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. 
She grips his hand and they lie with their heads together. It is quiet now, except for the lapping of the water.

289 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN - NIGHT 
Fifth Officer Lowe, the impetuous young Welshman, has gotten Boats 10, 12 and Collapsible D together with his own Boat 14. A demon of energy, he's had everyone hold the boats together and is transferring passengers from 14 into the others, to empty his boat for a rescue attempt. 
As the women step gingerly across the other boats, Lowe sees a shawled figure in too much of a hurry. He rips the shawl off, and finds himself staring into the face of a man. He angrily shoves the stowaway into another boat and turns to his crew of three. 
LOWE 
Right, man the oars. 
CUT TO: 
290 EXT. OCEAN / BOAT 14 
The beam of an electric torch plays across the water like a searchlight as boat 14 comes toward us. 
ANGLE FROM THE BOAT as the torch illuminates floating debris, a poignant trail of flotsam: a violin, a child's wooden soldier, a framed photo of a steerage family. Daniel Marvin's wooden Biograph camera. 
Then, their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like signoposts, the first bodies come into the torch's beam. The people are dead but not drowned, killed by the freezing water. Some look like they could be sleeping. Others stare with frozen eyes at the stars. 
Soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row. They hit the oars on the heads of floating men and women... a wooden thunk. One seaman throws up. Lowe sees a mother floating with her arms frozen around her lifeless baby. 
LOWE 
(the worst moment of his life) 
We waited too long.

291 EXT. OCEAN 
IN A HOVERING DOWNANGLE we see Jack and Rose floating in the black water. The stars reflect in the mill pond surface, and the two of them seem to be floating in interstellar space. They are absolutely still. Their hands are locked together. Rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling above her. The music is transparent, floating... as the long sleep steals over Rose, and she feels peace. 
CLOSE ON Rose's face. Pale, like the faces of the dead. She seems to be floating in a void. Rose is in a semi-hallucinatory state. She knows she is dying. Her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of Jack's song: 
ROSE 
"Come Josephine in my flying machine..." 
ROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way a glorious band from horizon to horizon. 
A SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens. 
TIGHT ON ROSE again. We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals. Her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes track down from the stars to the water. 
ROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars. She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water, leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of the men sound slow and DISTORTED. 
Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares across the water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past her motionless form and moves on. The boat is 50 feet away, and moving past her. The men look away. 
Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair has frozen to the wood under her. 
ROSE

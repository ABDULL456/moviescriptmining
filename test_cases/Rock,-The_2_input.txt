Along one side of the lab is a plexi-glass wall. Inside the plexi-glass is an airlocked GAS CHAMBER. F.B.I chemists LONNER and LING motion to Goodspeed. 
DR. LONNER 
C'mere, Billy. (points inside gas chamber) A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp.  Could be detergent, could be seran gas. 
INSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - is a LARGE WOODEN CRATE next to a TABLE OF POISON DETECTION INSTRUMENTS. 
ISHERWOOD Bosnian refugee camp?  I don't get it. 
GOODSPEED Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians don't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out your hand. 
Isherwood does so.  It's shaky. 
ISHERWOOD I'm okay.  Really.  Let's do it- 
Hold on Goodspeed's uncertain look, and CUT TO: 
INT.  GAS C ER - DAY - MINUTES LATER The door HISSES open.  Goodspeed and Isherwood, in vulcanized rubber suits and visored helmets, enter. They go to the INSTRUMENT TABLE before the crate. 
A GLASS VESSEL with tiny air holes (like a salt shaker) descends from the ceiling.  Inside are COCKROACHES. . 
GOODSPEED Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys. 
DR. LING (into mike) We have airlock, Bill.  Proceed. 
GOODSPEED (into helmet mike) July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a wooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside. 
Goodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries open the cratels wooden lid.  He motions to Isherwood.  Together they gingerly lift the lid. 
INSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with "UNICEF" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts out a HOT-PLATE.  Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER.  Gocidspeed runs a POISON SENSOR past each. 
GOODSPEED Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts out a sweatshirt) ... old clothes. 
ISHERWOOD This is thrilling. 
Isherwood lifts out a DOLL.  Goodspeed's POISON SENSOR'S NEEDLE goes crazy... ! 
GOODSPEED Careful, goddamn it Marvin! 
The doll's eyes open.  Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm. 
OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR.  LING stabs a button marked "exhaust" and another marked "emergency." 
A KLAXON sounds.  F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit. 
IN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST FANS begin to suck it up. 
IN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and explode, guts splattering the vessel walls. 
ISHERWOOD What's hap...  what's happening....? 
DR. LING looks at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the control panel. 
DR. LING Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear.  You're okay. 
Goodspeed grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and grabs A SCALPEL.  Cuts open the doll's chest. 
GOODSPEED I've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news is the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits. 
ISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES.  The rubber is beginning to bubble and corrode. 
DR. LING What's the really bad news. 
GOODSPEED peels back the doll's plastic chest, revealing: a C-4 EXPLOSIVE DEVICE and TEN POISON AMPULES. 
GOODSPEED Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas to kill everybody in the building. 
Isherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting. 
ISHERWOOD The acid's eating...  it's eating my fucking suit... 
GOODSPEED Chill, Marvin. (yells outside) WHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS? 
Dr. Lonner flips on the sprinklers.  The pipes KNOCK.  A FEW PATHETIC DROPS trickle from the SPRINKLER HEADS. 
DR. LONNER Something's blocking the pipes, Bill.  When in Christ's name are they gonna give us a new building ... 
DR. LING Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin. 
Isherwood, terrified, jerks open an OVERHEAD CABINET, revealing several 6 inch needled SYRINGES. 
DR. LING You die, we all die, Bill.  Inject yourself, then diffuse it. (Goodspeed continues to inspect-the device) Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote. 
Isherwood fumbles with a huge syringe.

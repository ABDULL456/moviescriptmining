TJ thinks, holding Dustin's toe in his grip. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
DUSTIN (CONT'D) I swear to God, man. It's at the wrecking yard on Sunrise. 
TJ If you're lying, I'm gonna cut off every one of your fingers. 
TJ doesn't quite know what to do now. He stares at Dustin who looks genuinely frightened. TJ releases the shears and backs away. And the second he does so, Dustin leaps off the couch, grabs TJ by the throat and slams him down on the living room floor. TJ drops the shears. 
DUSTIN You finished? Want to tell me something else while you're visiting? 
Dustin wails into TJ. TJ cowers on the ground. Punches land UNTIL - 
A LAWN CHAIR comes CRASHING through the front window into the living room, raining glass everywhere. Dustin stops punching, stunned, and looks up to see Hesher, dripping wet, step through the big nasty hole he has just made. 
HESHER Hello. 
DUSTIN What the fuck? 
Dustin moves to stand. Hesher pounces on him, dragging him along the ground. He grabs the shears and brings them straight up to Dustin's nose. In the same movement, he snaps the shears shut and takes the end of Dustin's nose off. 
Dustin squeals in pain and scurries backwards, clutching his face, blood leaking between his fingers. TJ stands, stunned. 
TJ What the fuck is wrong with you? 
HESHER What? 
DUSTIN Oh my god, my nose! 
TJ What the fuck is wrong with you? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
HESHER I just saved you. 
TJ You cut his nose off. 
HESHER Only a bit, it's just a cut. 
Dustin is crying now, clutching his face. 
TJ goes to the kitchen. 
TJ You just cut his nose off! 
HESHER What are you talking about? 
TJ runs a rag under the tap and takes it to Dustin. Hesher stands, clutching the shears, confused. 
TJ Hold this against your face. 
Dustin moans. Hesher is still confused. 
TJ (CONT'D) You gotta stop the bleeding. 
DUSTIN Oh my god! 
HESHER What's your problem? 
Dustin holds the rag. TJ stands to face Hesher. 
TJ I want you outta my life. I'm serious. I never want to see you again. How many times do I have say it? 
They look at each other a moment. Hesher looks taken aback. He honestly believed he was doing a good thing. 
TJ leaves, through the front door. Hesher stands over a whimpering Dustin wondering what went wrong. 
EXT. RED BRIDGE - NIGHT 
TJ rides his bike over a rickety red bridge. He pulls his bike up outside the tall wire fence of a big dirty wrecking yard - D&S Auto-Wreckers. It's still raining very hard. TJ is soaking wet. He sits on his bike, looking at mountains of wrecked cars inside. 
TJ hops off his bike and shoves it behind a dumpster. He gets up on the dumpster and climbs the wrecking yard's fence. 
EXT. D&S WRECKING YARD - MOMENTS LATER 
TJ roams the stacks, looking for his mother's car. He looks distraught. All around sit stacks of wrecked cars. A vicious dog on a chain barks and snarls nearby. 
TJ stops. He sees his mom's car atop a tall stack of wrecks. He looks at it a moment, contemplating what to do. He moves to the base of the stack and begins to climb. 
He clambers slowly up the pile in the rain. It's awkward and difficult and more than a little dangerous. 
Finally he reaches the top. He wrenches open the car door and squeezes behind the wheel. 
INT. RED VOLVO - CONTINUOUS 
TJ sits, catching his breath. The rain clatters on the roof of the car. TJ is up high enough to see the lights of the surrounding neighborhood. He sits and contemplates the last few days and months of his life.

NICO Mrs. Z. (tries to be light) Is this a way to act on the day of my son's baptism? The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes. 
SARA                                * It's Lucy.   She's gone again. Nico glances from Sara to Rosa.                              * 
Mrs. Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain. Nico holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara.            * NICO It's that kid from the bar on Damen? The one with the drugs?

Sara doesn't know. Nico does.     He comforts Mrs. Zingaro   * another moment, then stands. 
NICO Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening? (as the woman nods miserably) I have to go to work now. But I'll come by tonight. You'll be at the bakery? MRS. ZINGARO Si, Nico. NICO We'll talk, okay? We'll find a way to take care of this. 
Nico kisses Mrs. Z. He takes Sara's hand in goodbye,         * starts for the door. 47   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY Festivities still in progress. Nico passes through, nodding, thanking people for coming, taking farewells. Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch. 48   INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING Nico is driving.   Jackson checks in on the radio. JACKSON (into mike) Unit Ten Tango X-ray.    We're up and clear. 49   EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - UNMARKED CAR 
moves into the central city. 50   POV THROUGH CAR WINDOWS - STREETS - MOVING 
Bad-looking hombres on stoops, street corners. NICO (O.S.) I promised the Lieutenant, I'm gonna take care of you. Broken windows and lost kittens for your last week. WIDEN SHOT to include Nico and Jackson. 
JACKSON And then you're gonna come visit me in a nice, clean, air conditioned office --

51   EXT. STREET - BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                        * The unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar. 
52   INT. UNMARKED CAR as it parks. Jackson gives Nico a look:     "What are we stopping at this dive for"? 
NICO I gotta take a quick leak. Stay put. 
He gets out of the car, starts for the bar. 53   INT. BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                                 * 
Dim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar.    Nico enters.

His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working- class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head. 
BAD DUDE                                 * Why the fuck don't you assholes                        * leave me alone?                                        * 
He continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool,     * then another; the same exchange is repeated. 54   FAVOR ONE PARTICULARLY TOUGH CUSTOMER                           * 
A hulking bruiser with an earring.   He watches as -- 55   NICO 
approaches him. Three ARMY JACKETS look up sullenly. Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches. NICO Gentlemen. One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose. FIRST ARMY JACKET (to others) I thought this was a kosher bar. They didn't allow no pork in here. The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar. Nico holds out a photo of a young girl (Lucy). NICO You seen this girl? SECOND ARMY JACKET I seen the top of her head. NICO That's witty.

Nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next stool. From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          * sawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move         * ominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move     * almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right out of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash. Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks like his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk shirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with a shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening into the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has been put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its feet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six. Seven. Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat- tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men -- 
NICO Come on.   Show me something. No one moves.

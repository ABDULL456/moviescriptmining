Frank distractedly opens and closes a 12' high curtain in one of the rooms - (CONT) 
93   CONTINUED:                                                       93 
FRANK No loan, no contingencies.    Cash sale. 
94   EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT                                    94 
Wet streets and neon. Well-dressed crowd behind a velvet rope outside the club. The Apollo in the background: James Brown on the marquee. 
95   INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT                                    95 
A still-powerful older man in a nice suit rises from his chair to wild applause. From the stage - 
SINGER Mr. Joe Louis, ladies and gentlemen. 
Joe bows graciously, gives a little wave to the crowd, and sits back down as the band starts up again. 
At another table, Frank sits with Charlie Williams and Rossi, slightly older dope men. Like Frank, they favor expensive tailored suits. Their dates, too, are nicely dressed - not too much make-up or jewelry. Frank's glance moves from Joe Louis and his wife to a beautiful young woman at the table. 
FRANK Who's the beauty queen? 
CHARLIE She is a beauty queen.    No kidding. Miss Puerto Rico. Her glance crosses Frank's briefly but is yanked to the entrance of the club when Frank's brothers come in with their wives and girlfriends. Teddy's in a parrot green suit, gold chains, hat, acting like he owns the place. 
96   INT. BACK ROOM - SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER                        96 
Frank hustles Teddy into an empty back room. 
FRANK What is this? 
He turns Teddy so he's facing a mirror. 
TEDDY What. These are clothes.     This is a very nice (suit) - 
(CONT) 
96   CONTINUED:                                                       96 
FRANK I'm wearing clothes. These are clothes. Those - (Teddy's in the mirror) - are a costume. With a sign on it that says Arrest me. You look like fuckin Jackie Fox. 
TEDDY What's wrong with Jackie.    I like Jackie. 
FRANK You like Jackie? You want to be Superfly? Go work for him, end up in a cell with him. 
Teddy pulls himself from Frank's grasp. Smooths his shirt, adjusts his hat. Frank tries to explain to him: 
FRANK The guy making all the noise in the room is the weak one. That's not who you want to be. 
TEDDY He wants to talk to you by the way.     I told him I'd tell you. 
Frank stares at his brother's reflection in the mirror. 
FRANK You and Jackie were talking about me? 
TEDDY Not about you. We were talking. He said he wanted to talk to you about something. 
Frank clearly wants nothing to do with Jackie Fox. 
FRANK I'm taking you shopping tomorrow. 
TEDDY I went shopping today. 
FRANK You go shopping every day.    Like a girl. 
97   EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER - NIGHT                            97 
A creme Bentley pulls up and out pour Jackie Fox and his entourage. 
(CONT) 
97   CONTINUED:                                                        97 
He's got an armful of New York Times Magazines -with him on the cover, flaunting Gangster Chic. He starts handing them out to the crowd on his way into the club. 
98   INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                        98 
Joe Louis has come over to speak to Frank at his table. 
JOE LOUIS It's a tax thing. It's a mistake my lawyers will straighten out, but for the time being it's a headache - 
FRANK How much you owe? 
JOE LOUIS It's nothing, like - fifty grand. 
Frank isn't sure if it's an honor or a curse to have a celebrity like Joe Louis asking to borrow money, but nods. 
FRANK Sure.   Don't worry about it. 
JOE LOUIS Thank you.   I'll pay you back soon as - 
FRANK Joe. It's a gift. Not a loan.       You don't owe me nothing. 
Jackie glides into the club with his magazines and entourage. Frank watches him make the rounds, lingering at Miss Puerto Rico's table and holding her hand longer than he should with his girlfriend on his arm. Frank glances to Teddy wearily, then to Doc, alone at the next table like a sentry. Frank doesn't have to say he's ready to leave. Doc knows the look. Gets up.

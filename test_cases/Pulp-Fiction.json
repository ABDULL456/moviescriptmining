COFFEE SHOP \u0096 MORNING \nA normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs. \nTwo of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style. \nIt is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace \"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\" fashion. \nYOUNG MAN No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit. \nYOUNG WOMAN You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous. \nYOUNG MAN I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but \u0096 \nYOUNG WOMAN \u0096 but you forget about it in a day or two - \nYOUNG MAN \u0096 yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun. \nYOUNG WOMAN When you go on like this, you know what you sound like? \nYOUNG MAN I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like. \nYOUNG WOMAN You sound like a duck. (imitates a duck) Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack... \nYOUNG MAN Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again. \nYOUNG WOMAN After tonight. \nThe boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth. \nYOUNG MAN (with a smile) Correct. I got all tonight to quack. \nA WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee. \nWAITRESS Can I get anybody anymore coffee? \nYOUNG WOMAN Oh yes, thank you. \nThe Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man lights up another cigarette. \nYOUNG MAN I'm doin' fine. \nThe Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke. \nThe Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee. \nThe Young Man goes right back into it. \nYOUNG MAN I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier!  Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: \"We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er.\" \nYOUNG WOMAN Did it work? \nYOUNG MAN Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger. \nYOUNG WOMAN Did they hurt the little girl? \nYOUNG MAN I don't know. There probably never was a little girl \u0096 the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone. \nYOUNG WOMAN You wanna rob banks? \nYOUNG MAN I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'. \nYOUNG WOMAN So you don't want to be a bank robber? \nYOUNG MAN Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty. \nYOUNG WOMAN And no more liquor stores? \nYOUNG MAN What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: \"Empty out the register,\" and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em. \nYOUNG WOMAN I'm not gonna kill anybody. \nYOUNG MAN I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it. \nYOUNG WOMAN Well, what else is there, day jobs? \nYOUNG MAN (laughing) Not this life. \nYOUNG WOMAN Well what then? \nHe calls to the Waitress. \nYOUNG MAN Garcon! Coffee! \nThen looks to his girl. \nVINCENT Royale with Cheese. \nJULES (repeating) Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac? \nVINCENT Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac. \nJULES Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper? \nVINCENT I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.  But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup? \nJULES What? \nVINCENT Mayonnaise. \nJULES Goddamn! \nVINCENT I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it. \nJULES Uuccch! \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHEVY (TRUNK) \u0096 MORNING \nThe trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking them. \nJULES We should have shotguns for this kind of deal. \nVINCENT How many up there? \nJULES Three or four. \nVINCENT Counting our guy? \nJULES I'm not sure. \nVINCENT So there could be five guys up there? \nJULES It's possible. \nVINCENT We should have fuckin' shotguns. \nThey CLOSE the trunk. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD \u0096 MORNING \nVincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building. \nWe TRACK alongside. \nVINCENT What's her name? \nJULES Mia. \nVINCENT How did Marsellus and her meet? \nJULES I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress. \nVINCENT She ever do anything I woulda saw? \nJULES I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot. \nVINCENT What's a pilot? \nJULES Well, you know the shows on TV? \nVINCENT I don't watch TV. \nJULES Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows? \nVINCENT Yeah. \nJULES Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. \nThey enter the apartment building. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) \u0096 MORNING \nVincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait for the elevator. \nJULES You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half- black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror. \nVINCENT Yeah maybe, fat right? \nJULES I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem.  What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan. \nVINCENT I think I know who you mean, what about him? \nJULES Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good.  And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife. \nThe elevator arrives, the men step inside. \nINT. ELEVATOR \u0096 MORNING \nVINCENT What'd he do, fuck her? \nJULES No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad. \nVINCENT Well what then? \nVINCENT It's not a date. \nJules just looks at him. \nINT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) \u0096 MORNING \nTHREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out. \nOne of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway. \nJULES Hey kids. \nThe two men stroll inside. \nThe three young caught-off-guard Guys are: \nMARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner. \nROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a \"Flock of Seagulls\" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand. \nBRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut. \nVincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking. \nJULES How you boys doin'? \nNo answer. \nJULES (to Brett) Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question. \nBRETT We're doin' okay. \nAs Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys. \nJULES Do you know who we are? \nBrett shakes his head: \"No.\" \nJULES We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya? \nNo answer. \nJULES (to Brett) Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right? \nBRETT I'm Brett. \nJULES I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett? \nBRETT I remember him. \nJULES Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'? \nBRETT Hamburgers. \nJULES Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers? \nBRETT Cheeseburgers. \nJULES No, I mean where did you get'em? MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the- Box, where? \nBRETT Big Kahuna Burger. \nJULES Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they? \nBRETT They're good. \nJULES Mind if I try one of yours? \nBRETT No. \nJULES Yours is this one, right? \nBRETT Yeah. \nJules grabs the burger and take a bite of it. \nJULES Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger. (to Vincent) Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger? \nVINCENT No. \nJules holds out the Big Kahuna. \nJULES You wanna bite, they're real good. \nVINCENT I ain't hungry. \nJULES Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger. (to Brett) You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France? \nBRETT No. \nJULES Tell 'em, Vincent. \nVINCENT Royale with Cheese. \nJULES Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that? \nBRETT Because of the metric system? \nJULES Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system. (he points to a fast food drink cup) What's in this? \nBRETT Sprite. \nBrett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in the chair. \nJULES Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?! \nBRETT (in agony) No. \nJULES Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?! \nBRETT (in spasm) I didn't. \nNow in a lower voice. \nJULES Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett? \nBRETT (in spasm) Yes. \nJULES There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. \"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\" \nThe two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting Brett. \nAGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD: \n\"VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE\" \nFADE IN: \nMEDIUM SHOT \u0096 BUTCH COOLIDGE \nWe FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds like a cross between a gangster and a king. \nMARSELLUS (O.S.) I think you're gonna find \u0096 when all this shit is over and done \u0096 I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right now you got ability. But painful as it may be, ability don't last. Now that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life, but it's a fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git realistic about. This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers who thought their ass aged like wine.  Besides, even if you went all the way, what would you be? Feather-weight champion of the world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you can even get a credit card based on that. \nA hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front of Butch. Butch picks it up. \nMARSELLUS (O.S.) Now the night of the fight, you may fell a slight sting, that's pride fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride only hurts, it never helps. Fight through that shit. 'Cause a year from now, when you're kickin' it in the Caribbean you're gonna say, \"Marsellus Wallace was right.\" \nBUTCH I got no problem with that. \nMARSELLUS (O.S.) In the fifth, your ass goes down. \nButch nods his head: \"yes.\" \nMARSELLUS (O.S.) Say it! \nBUTCH In the fifth, my ass goes down. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR (MOVING) \u0096 DAY \nVincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT. \nEXT. SALLY LEROY'S \u0096 DAY \nSally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus owns. \nVincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic. \nVince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally LeRoy's. \nENGLISH DAVE Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, git your ass on in here. \nVincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door in our faces. \nINT. SALLY LEROY'S \u0096 DAY \nThe spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave crosses to the bar, and Vince follows. \nVINCENT Where's the big man? \nENGLISH DAVE He's over there, finishing up some business. \nVINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of yet still UNSEEN Marsellus. \nENGLISH DAVE (O.S.) Hang back for a second or two, and when you see the white boy leave, go on over.  In the meanwhile, can I make you an espresso? \nVINCENT How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' American? \nENGLISH DAVE Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow? \nVINCENT At Marsellus' request. \nENGLISH DAVE Have you met Mia? \nVINCENT Not yet. \nEnglish Dave smiles to himself. \nVINCENT What's so funny? \nENGLISH DAVE Not a goddamn thing. \nVINCENT Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do. \nEnglish Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him. \nENGLISH DAVE My name's Paul, and this is between y'all. \nButch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his cup of \"Plain ol' American.\" \nBUTCH (to English Dave) Can I get a pack'a Red Apples? \nLANCE Still got your Malibu? \nVINCENT You know what some fucker did to it the other day? \nLANCE What? \nVINCENT Fuckin' keyed it. \nLANCE Oh man, that's fucked up. \nVINCENT Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years. It's out five fuckin' days \u0096 five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it. \nLANCE They should be fuckin' killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution. \nAs he cooks his heroin... \nVINCENT I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean? \nLANCE It's chicken shit. You don't fuck another man's vehicle. \nCLOSEUP \u0096 THE NEEDLE \nGoing into Vincent's vein. \nCLOSEUP \u0096 BLOOD \nSpurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin. \nCLOSEUP \u0096 VINCENT'S THUMB \nPushing down on the plunger. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE \u0096 NIGHT \nVincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door \nCLOSEUP \u0096 NOTE \nThe Note reads: \n\"Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink.  Mia\" \nMIA (V.O.) Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink. \nFADE TO WHITE \nMusic in. \nFADE TO: \nINT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nVincent enters on the background. \nVINCENT Hello? \nINT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nMIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in the background. Dusty Springfield is singing \"SON OF A PREACHER MAN\". \nMia's mouth comes toward a microphone. \nMIA (into microphone) Vincent. \nINT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nVincent turns. \nMIA (over intercom) Vincent. I'm on the intercom. \nINT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nMIA (into microphone) It's on the wall by the two African fellas. \nINT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nMIA (over intercom) To your right. \nVincent walks. \nMIA ...warm. Warmer. Disco. \nVincent finds the intercom on the wall. \nVINCENT Hello. \nMIA (over intercom) Push the button if you want to talk. \nVINCENT (into intercom) Hello. \nINT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nMIA (into microphone) Go make yourself a drink., and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail. \nINT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nMIA (over intercom) The bar's by the fireplace. \nVINCENT (into intercom) Okay. (licks lips) \nMIA Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word? \nVINCENT No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage. \nMIA And...? \nVINCENT No and, that's it. \nMIA You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet? \nVINCENT Yeah. \nMIA And you believed that? \nVINCENT At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable. \nMIA Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable? \nVINCENT No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you. \nMIA A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else. \nVINCENT But did it happen? \nMIA The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once \u0096 at my wedding \u0096 then never again.  The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle. \nCUT TO: \nED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE \nED SULLIVAN (into microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment you've all been waiting for, the worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest. \nPatrons cheer. \nEd Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy. \nED SULLIVAN ...One lucky couple will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding. \nMarilyn holds the trophy. \nED SULLIVAN ...Now, who will be our first contestants? \nMia holds her hand. \nMIA Right here. \nVincent reacts. \nMIA I wanna dance. \nVINCENT No, no, no no, no, no, no, no. \nMIA (overlapping) No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted, Now, I want to dance. I want to win. I want that trophy. \nVINCENT (sighs) All right. \nMIA So, dance good. \nVINCENT All right, you asked for it. \nVincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan. \nED SULLIVAN (into microphone) Let's hear it for our first contestants. \nPatrons cheer. \nVincent and Mia walk up to the microphone. \nED SULLIVAN Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name? \nMIA (into microphone) Missus Mia Wallace. \nED SULLIVAN (into microphone) And, uh, how 'bout your fella here? \nMIA (into microphone) Vincent Vega. \nED SULLIVAN (into microphone) All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away! \nMia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's \"YOU NEVER CAN TELL\". They make hand movements as they dance. \nINT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME \u0096 NIGHT \nThe front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango- style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing. \nThen... \nThe two just stand face to face looking at each other. \nVINCENT Was than an uncomfortable silence? \nMIA I don't know what that was. (pause) Music and drinks! \nMia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove. \nVINCENT I'm gonna take a piss. \nMIA That was a little bit more information than I needed to know, but go right ahead. \nVincent shuffles off to the john. \nMia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It feels good. \nJody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up. \nJODY (O.S.) Lance! The phone's ringing! \nLANCE (calling back) I can hear it! \nJODY (O.S.) I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call this late! \nLANCE (by the phone) I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna tell this fuckin' asshole right now! (he answers the phone) Hello, do you know how late it is? You're not supposed to be callin' me this fuckin' late. \nBACK TO: \nVINCENT IN THE MALIBU \nVincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the conversation. \nVINCENT Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place. \nLANCE Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the problem? \nVINCENT You still got an adrenaline shot? \nLANCE (dawning on him) Maybe. \nVINCENT I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin'  Doing on me. \nLANCE Don't bring her here!  I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt to my house! \nVINCENT No choice. \nLANCE She's ODin'? \nVINCENT Yeah. She's dyin'. \nLANCE Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer! \nVINCENT Negative. \nLANCE She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it \u0096 are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone? \nVINCENT Sorry. \nLANCE I don't know you, who is this, don't come here, I'm hangin' up. \nVINCENT Too late, I'm already here. \nAt that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out of SHATTERS from the impact. \nJODY (O.S.) What the hell was that? \nLance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front lawn. \nEXT. LANCE'S HOUSE \u0096 NIGHT \nVincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out. \nLANCE Have you lost your mind?! You crashed your car in my fuckin' house! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone \u0096 \nVINCENT If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now! \nLANCE Are you deaf? You're not bringin' that fucked up bitch in my house! \nVINCENT This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn. \nINT. LANCE'S HOUSE \u0096 NIGHT \nWE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom. \nJody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it. \nWe follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking through the hall into the living room. \nJODY It's only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on out here? \nAs she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of the room. \nFrom here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing. \nJODY Who's she? \nLance looks up at Jody. \nLANCE Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenaline shot. \nJODY What's wrong with her? \nVINCENT She's ODing on us. \nJODY Well get her the hell outta here! \nLANCE AND VINCENT (in stereo) Get the fuckin' shot! \nJODY Don't yell and me! \nShe angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking for the shot. \nWE MOVE into the room with the two men. \nVINCENT (to Lance) You two are a match made in heaven. \nLANCE Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay? While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta get a medical book. \nLANCE It's ready, I'll tell you what to do. \nVINCENT You're gonna give her the shot. \nLANCE No, you're gonna give her the shot. \nVINCENT I've never does this before. \nLANCE I've never done this before either, and I ain't starting now. You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot. The day I bring an ODing bitch to your place, then I gotta give her the shot. \nJody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic marker in her hand. \nJODY Got it. \nVincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is. \nVINCENT Okay, what do I do? \nLANCE Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion. \nLance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like \"The Shape\" killing its victims in \"HALLOWEEN\". \nVINCENT I gotta stab her? \nLANCE If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard. \nThen once you do, push down on the plunger. \nVINCENT What happens after that? \nLANCE I'm curious about that myself. \nVINCENT This ain't a fuckin' joke man! \nLANCE She's supposed to come out of it like \u0096 (snaps his fingers) \u0096 that. \nVincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion. \nHe looks down on Mia. \nMia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her. \nVincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this. \nVINCENT Count to three. \nLance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect. \nLANCE One... \nRED DOT on Mia's body. \nNeedle raised ready to strike. \nLANCE (O.S.) ...two... \nJody's face is alive with anticipation. \nNEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike. \nLANCE (O.S.) ...three! \nThe needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard. \nVincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the chest. \nMia's head is JOLTED from the impact. \nThe syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline out through the needle. \nMia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest \u0096 SCREAMING. \nVincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death. \nMia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of air. \nThe other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright. \nLANCE If you're okay, say something. \nMia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice. \nMIA Something. \nVincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and shaking from how close to death Mia came. \nJODY Anybody want a beer? \nCUT TO: \nINT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) \u0096 NIGHT \nVincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says anything, both are still too shaken. \nEXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE \u0096 NIGHT \nThe Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway toward her front door. \nVINCENT (O.S.) Mia! \nShe turns around. \nAs Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, empty locker room. \nFADE TO BLACK \nTITLE CARD: \n\"THE GOLD WATCH\" \nWe hear over the black and white title: \nSPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.) \u0096 Well Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and, hands-down, the most brutal fight this city has ever seen. \nThe SOUND of chaos in the b.g. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ALLEY (RAINING) \u0096 NIGHT \nA taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from inside. \nSPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.) ...Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring. Do you think he knew Willis was dead? \nSPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.) My guess would be yes, Richard. I could see from my position here, the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing. I think any man would've left the ring that fast. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) \u0096 NIGHT \nInside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks, sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a white styrofoam cup. \nThe Sportscasters continue their coverage. \nSPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.) Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing? \nSPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.) Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation. But it's of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the \u0096 \nCLICK \u0096 Esmarelda shuts off the radio. \nShe takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see: \nEXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) \u0096 NIGHT \nA window about three stories high opens on the auditorium- side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to the dumpster below. \nESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight. \nGym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and throws it to the ground. \nINT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) \u0096 NIGHT \nButch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door. \nEsmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through the rearview mirror: \nESMARELDA (Spanish accent) Are you the man I was supposed to pick up? \nBUTCH If you're the cab I called, I'm the guy you're supposed to pick up. \nESMARELDA Where to? \nBUTCH Outta here. \nThe ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life. \nThe meter is FLIPPED on. \nEsmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal. \nEXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) \u0096 NIGHT \nThe cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace. \nINT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) \u0096 NIGHT \nLocker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave. \nVINCENT Mia. How you doin'? \nMIA Great. I never thanked you for the dinner. \nIn the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table \u0096 dead. \nHis face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body. \nThe huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big. \nMia sits in a chair at the far end of the room. \nMarsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him. \nMARSELLUS (O.S.) What'cha got? \nENGLISH DAVE He booked. \nMARSELLUS (O.S.) I'm prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass. \nENGLISH DAVE I'll take care of it. \nINT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) \u0096 NIGHT \nButch gets one of his boxing gloves off. \nButch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to take him wherever he wants to go. \nBUTCH (to himself in French with English subtitles) Fabienne my love, our adventure begins. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) \u0096 NIGHT \nEsmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic jacket. He leans in the driver's side window. \nESMARELDA Forty-five sixty. \nHanding her the money. \nBUTCH Merci beaucoup. And here's a little something for the effort. \nButch holds up a hundred dollar bill. \nEsmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds it out of reach. \nBUTCH Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em? \nESMARELDA The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans. \nHe gives her the bill. \nBUTCH Bon soir, Esmarelda. \nESMARELDA (in Spanish) Sleep well, Butch. \nHe tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. She drives off. \nINT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) \u0096 NIGHT \nButch enters and turns on the light. \nLying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE. \nFABIENNE Keep the light off. \nButch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again. \nBUTCH Is that better, sugar pop? \nFABIENNE Oui. Hard day at the office? \nBUTCH Pretty hard. I got into a fight. \nFABIENNE Poor baby. Can we make spoons? \nButch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind. \nWhen Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in babytalk. \nFABIENNE I was looking at myself in the mirror. \nBUTCH Uh-huh? \nFABIENNE I wish I had a pot. \nBUTCH You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot? \nFABIENNE A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy. \nBUTCH Well you should be happy, 'cause you do. \nFABIENNE Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did \"Lucky Star,\" it's not the same thing. \nBUTCH I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly. \nFABIENNE The difference is huge. \nBUTCH You want me to have a pot? \nFABIENNE No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it. \nBUTCH You think guys would find that attractive? \nFABIENNE I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same. \nBUTCH If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in it. \nFABIENNE You'd punch me in my belly? \nBUTCH Right in the belly. \nFABIENNE I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe. \nBUTCH You'd do that to me? \nFABIENNE Yes! \nBUTCH Did you get everything, sugar pop? \nFABIENNE Yes, I did. \nBUTCH Good job. \nFABIENNE Did everything go as planned? \nBUTCH You didn't listen to the radio? \nBUTCH I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I called you a retard, but I took it back. \nShe hands him a towel. \nBUTCH Merci beaucoup. \nFABIENNE Butch? \nBUTCH (drying his head) Yes, lemon pie. \nFABIENNE Where are we going to go? \nBUTCH I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this. But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever. I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there. \nFABIENNE So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora? \nBUTCH You betcha. And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico. \nFABIENNE But I do not speak Spanish. \nBUTCH You don't speak Bora Boran either. Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el zapataria? \nFABIENNE What does that mean? \nBUTCH Where's the shoe store? \nFABIENNE Donde esta el zapataria? \nBUTCH Excellent pronunciation. You'll be my little mama ceta in no time. \nButch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her teeth. \nButch keeps on from the other room. \nBUTCH (O.S.) Que hora es? \nFABIENNE Que hora es? \nBUTCH (O.S.) What time is it? \nFABIENNE What time is it? \nBUTCH (O.S.) Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean. \nFabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or two, then she remember something. \nFABIENNE Butch. \nShe walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed. \nShe looks at him for a moment. \nFABIENNE Forget it. \nShe exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP: \nMOTEL ROOM \u0096 MORNING \nSAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still asleep in bed. \nFabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still wears the terry cloth robe from the night before. \nON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking on the entire Vietnamese army in the film \"THE LOSERS\". \nButch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing him. \nHis start startles Fabienne. \nFABIENNE Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream? \nButch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus. \nButch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp. \nBUTCH What are you watching? \nFABIENNE A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name. \nBUTCH Are you watchin' it? \nFabienne enters the room. \nFABIENNE In a way. Why? Would you like for me to switch it off? \nBUTCH Would you please? \nShe reaches over and turns off the TV. \nBUTCH It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war. \nFABIENNE What was it about? \nBUTCH How should I know, you were the one watchin' it. \nFabienne laughs. \nFABIENNE No, imbecile, what was your dream about? \nDOUBLE-TAKE: \"Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?\" \nButch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. He STOMPS on the gas pedal. \nThe little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour. \nButch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk. \nButch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside. \nPEDESTRIAN Jesus, are you okay? \nButch look at him, spaced-out. \nBUTCH I guess. \nMarsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather around the body. \nGAWKER #1 (to the others) He's dead! He's dead! \nThis jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to. \nTWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage. \nThe woozy Marsellus gets to his feet. \nGAWKER #2 If you need a witness in court, I'll be glad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He hit you and crashed into that car. \nMARSELLUS (still incoherent) Who? \nGAWKER #2 (pointing at Butch) Him. \nMarsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles. \nMARSELLUS Well, I'll be damned. \nThe big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away. \nMarsellus starts moving toward Butch. \nButch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him. \nBUTCH Sacre bleu. \nMarsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild. \nHe HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, screaming. \nLOOKY-LOO WOMAN Oh my God, I've been shot! \nThat's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here. \nMarsellus RUNS after him. \nThe CROWD looks agape. \nButch is in a mad, limping RUN. \nThe big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run. \nButch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads \"MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP\". \nINT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP \u0096 DAY \nMAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES into his world. \nMAYNARD Can I help you wit' somethin'? \nBUTCH Shut up! \nButch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door. \nMAYNARD Now you just wait one goddamn minute \nBefore Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist in Marsellus' face. \nThe gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS FLAT on his back. \nOutside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by. \nButch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the face. \nButch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger. \nBUTCH So you like chasing people, huh? \nHe BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter. \nBUTCH Well guess what, big man, you caught me \u0096 \nMAYNARD (O.S.) \u0096 hold it right there, godammit! \nButch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men. \nBUTCH Look mister, this ain't any of your business \u0096 \nMAYNARD \u0096 I'm makin' it my business! Now toss that gun! \nButch does. \nMAYNARD Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter. \nZED Wanna do it here? \nMAYNARD Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room. \nZed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old room. \nRussell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty. \nAs Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room. \nMAYNARD (to The Gimp) Up! \nThe Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on the ceiling. \nMAYNARD Keep an eye on this one. \nThe Gimp bows its head: \"yes.\" Maynard disappears into Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air. \nButch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy. \nFrom behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and: \nMAYNARD (O.S.) Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em! \nWe the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus. \nZED (O.S.) You wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I like to fight! \nButch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free. \nThe Gimp is laughing wildly. \nThe ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free. \nThe Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear: \nMAYNARD (O.S.) That's it... that's it boy, you're goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like that... that's good. (grunting faster) Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em! \nButch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt. \nThe Gimp sees this and its eyes widen. \nTHE GIMP Huhng? \nThe Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts. \nButch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains. \nINT. PAWNSHOP \u0096 DAY \nButch sneaks to the door. \nOn the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with Marsellus. \nButch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with. \nHe picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots what he's been looking for: \nA Samurai sword. \nIt hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon \"DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER\" sign. Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business. \nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM \u0096 DAY \nButch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon. \nSodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to Russell's old room. \nINT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM \u0096 DAY \nButch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions. \nZed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse. \nMaynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch. \nMaynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind him with the sword. \nMiserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen. \nBUTCH Hey hillbilly. \nMaynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword. \nButch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed. \nMaynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock. \nButch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES. \nZed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, which lies within reach. \nButch's eyes follow Zed's. \nBUTCH You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up. \nZed's hand inches toward the weapon. \nButch GRIPS the sword tighter. \nZed studies Butch. \nButch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her hand. \nBUTCH I'm sorry, baby-love. \nFABIENNE (crying) You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts. \nBUTCH I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie. Everything's fine. Hey, how was breakfast? \nFABIENNE (waterworks drying a little) It was good \u0096 \nBUTCH \u0096 did you get the blueberry pancakes? \nFABIENNE No, they didn't have blueberry pancakes, I had to get buttermilk \u0096 are you sure you're okay? \nBUTCH Baby-love, from the moment I left you, this has been without a doubt the single weirdest day of my entire life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about it. \nFabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up. \nFABIENNE Butch, whose motorcycle is this? \nBUTCH It's a chopper. \nFABIENNE Whose chopper is this? \nBUTCH Zed's. \nFABIENNE Who's Zed? \nBUTCH Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead. \nAnd with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES. \nFADE TO BLACK \nTITLE CARD: \n\"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF\" \nTITLE DISAPPEARS. \nOver black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking. \nJULES (O.S.) You ever read the Bible, Brett? \nBRETT (O.S.) Yes! \nJULES (O.S.) There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. \"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men...\" \nFADE UP: \nINT. BATHROOM \u0096 DAY \nWe're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum. \nJULES (O.S.) \"...blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherded the weak through the valley of darkness. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\" \nBANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! \nThe Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door. \nThen he listens to them talk. \nVINCENT (O.S.) Friend of yours? \nJULES (O.S.) Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin. \nWaiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around is the way to go. \nINT. APARTMENT \u0096 DAY \nThe bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his hand cannon. \nFOURTH MAN Die... die... die... die...! \nDOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before. \nHe SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion crosses his face. \nTWO SHOT \u0096 JULES AND VINCENT \nStanding next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, \"Are we hit?\" They're as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man. \nFOURTH MAN I don't understand \u0096 \nThe Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD. \nThe two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs it off. \nThen heads toward Marvin in the corner. \nVINCENT Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind?  Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon? \nJULES (to himself) We should be fuckin' dead right now. (pause) Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him. \nVINCENT \nJULES We should be fuckin' dead! \nVINCENT Yeah, we were lucky. \nJules rises, moving toward Vincent. \nINT. KITCHEN \u0096 MORNING \nJimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee. \nTHE WOLF Thank you, Jimmie. \nHe takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three men the plan of action. \nTHE WOLF Okay first thing, you two. (meaning Jules and Vincent) Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct? \nJIMMIE Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink. \nTHE WOLF Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe down the upholstery \u0096 now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off it. Give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.  But the windows are a different story.  Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal.  Jimmie \u0096 lead the way, boys \u0096 get to work. \nThe Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen. \nVINCENT (calling after him) A \"please\" would be nice. \nThe Wolf stops and turns around. \nTHE WOLF Come again? \nVINCENT I said a \"please\" would be nice. \nThe Wolf takes a step toward him. \nTHE WOLF Set is straight, Buster. I'm not here to say \"please.\"I'm here to tell you want to do. And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen. \nJULES It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated. \nVINCENT I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me. \nTHE WOLF If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this. So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car. \nINT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM \u0096 MORNING \nJimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he has. \nThe Wolf is on the phone. \nTHE WOLF (into phone) It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. (pause) White. (pause) Nothin', except for the mess inside. (pause) About twenty minutes. (pause) Nobody who'll be missed. (pause) You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon. (he looks at Jimmie) How we comin', Jimmie? \nJimmie comes over with a handful of linen. \nJIMMIE Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin' \u0096 \nTHE WOLF \u0096 Winston, Jimmie \u0096 please, Winston. \nJIMMIE You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore \u0096 \nTHE WOLF \u0096 let me ask you a question, if you don't mind? \nJIMMIE Sure. \nTHE WOLF Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires? \nJIMMIE No. \nTHE WOLF Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do. (takes out a roll of bills) I like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man? \nJIMMIE Oak's nice. \nINT. GARAGE \u0096 MORNING \nBoth Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain. \nBoth are twice as bloody as they were before. \nJULES I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit! \nVINCENT Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings? \nJULES Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass. \nVINCENT I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow. \nJULES You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I'm \"SUPERFLY T.N.T,\" I'm the \"GUNS OF NAVARONE.\" I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull. \nINT. CHEVY NOVA \u0096 MORNING \nThe interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript vehicle. \nThe Wolf circles the car examining it. \nJules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job they've done. \nTHE WOLF Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of this yet. \nJIMMIE I can't believe that's the same car. \nTHE WOLF Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet. Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us right along to phase two, clean you two. \nEXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD \u0096 MORNING \nJules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one of those guns nozzles attached. \nTHE WOLF Strip. \nVINCENT All the way? \nTHE WOLF To your bare ass. \nWINSTON (painfully) It's your future: I see... a cab ride. (dropping the act) Sorry guys, move out of the sticks. (to Raquel) Say goodbye, Raquel. \nRAQUEL Goodbye, Raquel. \nWINSTON I'll see you two around, and stay outta trouble, you crazy kids. \nWinston turns to leave. \nJULES Mr. Wolf. \nHe turns around. \nJULES I was a pleasure watchin' you work. \nThe Wolf smiles. \nWINSTON Call me Winston. \nHe turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche. \nWINSTON You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one's elders shows character. \nRAQUEL I have character. \nWINSTON Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character. \nRAQUEL Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny. \nThe Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road. \nThe two men left alone look at each other. \nJULES Wanna share a cab? \nVINCENT You know I could go for some breakfast.  Want to have breakfast with me? \nJULES Sure. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u0096 MORNING \nJules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a refill for both men, \nVINCENT Thanks a bunch. (to Jules, who's nursing his coffee) Want a sausage? \nJULES Naw, I don't eat pork. \nVINCENT Are you Jewish? \nJULES I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine. \nVINCENT Why not? \nJULES They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals. \nVINCENT Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good. \nJULES A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces. \nVINCENT How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces. \nJULES I don't eat dog either. \nVINCENT Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal? \nJULES I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way. \nVINCENT So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal? \nJULES We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs. \nThe two men laugh. \nVINCENT Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet. \nJULES I just been sittin' here thinkin'. \nVINCENT (mouthful of food) About what? \nJULES The miracle we witnessed. \nVINCENT The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence. \nJULES Do you know that a miracle is? \nVINCENT An act of God. \nJULES What's an act of God? \nVINCENT I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies. \nJULES Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved. \nVINCENT But why? \nJULES That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep. \nVINCENT So you're serious, you're really gonna quit? \nJULES The life, most definitely. \nVincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress. \nPUMPKIN In the bag. \nJules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, Pumpkin points to the briefcase. \nPUMPKIN What's in that? \nJULES My boss' dirty laundry. \nPUMPKIN You boss makes you do his laundry? \nJULES When he wants it clean. \nPUMPKIN Sounds like a shit job. \nJULES Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing. \nPUMPKIN Open it up. \nJules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase. \nJULES 'Fraid I can't do that. \nPumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the hammer. \nPUMPKIN I didn't hear you. \nJULES Yes, you did. \nThis exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong. \nHONEY BUNNY What's goin' on? \nPUMPKIN Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst. \nHONEY BUNNY Shoot 'em in the face! \nJULES I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me. \nPUMPKIN You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last. \nMANAGER (on the ground) Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here. \nJULES Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business! \nPUMPKIN I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One... \nPUMPKIN ...two... three. \nJULES You win. \nJules raises his hand off the briefcase. \nJULES It's all yours, Ringo. \nPUMPKIN Open it. \nJules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can't see shit. \nHONEY BUNNY What is it? What is it? \nPUMPKIN (softly) Is that what I think it is? \nJules nods his head: \"yes.\" \nPUMPKIN It's beautiful. \nJules nods his head: \"yes.\" \nHONEY BUNNY Goddammit, what is it? \nJules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case. \nLike a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under Pumpkin's chin. \nHoney Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction. \nHONEY BUNNY Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad! \nJULES (to Pumpkin) Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool! \nPUMPKIN Chill out, honey! \nHONEY BUNNY Let him go! \nJULES (softly) Tell her it's gonna be okay. \nPUMPKIN I'm gonna be okay. \nJULES Promise her. \nPUMPKIN I promise. \nJULES Tell her to chill. \nPUMPKIN Just chill out. \nJULES What's her name? \nPUMPKIN Yolanda. \nWhenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only at Pumpkin. \n", "test1_input": "MIA Whaddya think? \nVINCENT It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate. \nVincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke. \nAfter a second of watching him \u0096 \nMIA What are you doing? \nVINCENT Rollin' a smoke. \nMIA Here? \nVINCENT It's just tobacco. \nMIA Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy? \nAs he finishes licking it \u0096 \nVINCENT You can have this one, cowgirl. \nHe hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's hand. He lights it. \nMIA Thanks. \nVINCENT Think nothing of it. \nHe begins rolling one for himself. \nAs this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds. \nBack to Mia and Vincent. \nMIA Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam. \nVINCENT Sure did. I heard you did a pilot. \nMIA That was my fifteen minutes. \nVINCENT What was it? \nMIA It was show about a team of female secret agents called \"Fox Force Five.\" \nVINCENT What? \nMIA \"Fox Force Five.\" Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one... two ... three... four... five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show \"Baton Rouge,\" she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me.  We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex... \nVINCENT What was your specialty? \nMIA Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist \u0096 when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke. \nVINCENT Do you remember any of the jokes? \nMIA Well I only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show. \nVINCENT Tell me. \nMIA No. It's really corny. \nVINCENT C'mon, don't be that way. \nMIA No. You won't like it and I'll be embarrassed. \nVINCENT You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh. \nMIA (laughing) That's what I'm afraid of. \nVINCENT That's not what I meant and you know it. \nMIA You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you? \nVINCENT I meant I wouldn't laugh at you. \nMIA That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much. \nVINCENT What a gyp. \nBuddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake. \nMIA Yummy! \nVINCENT Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like. \nMIA Be my guest. \nShe slides the shake over to him. \nMIA You can use my straw, I don't have kooties. \nVincent smiles. \nVINCENT Yeah, but maybe I do. \nMIA Kooties I can handle. \nHe takes a sip. \nVINCENT Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake. \nMIA Told ya. \n", "test1_true": "He slides the shake back. \nThen the first of an uncomfortable silence happens. \nMIA Don't you hate that? \nVINCENT What? \nMIA Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable? \nVINCENT I don't know. \nMIA That's when you know you found somebody special. When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence. \nVINCENT I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other. \nMIA Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say. \nVINCENT I'll do that. \nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) \u0096 NIGHT \nMia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush. \nMIA (imitating Steppenwolf) I said goddamn! \nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) \u0096 NIGHT \nVincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant. \nMia comes back to the table. \nMIA Don't you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you? \nVINCENT We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section. \nMIA Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes. \nVINCENT No there's not. \nPointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table. \nVINCENT That's Marilyn Monroe... \nThen, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS \u0096 \nVINCENT ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off. \nMIA Pretty smart. \nVINCENT I have moments. \nMIA Did ya think of something to say? \nVINCENT Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you. \nMIA Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say. \nVINCENT Only if you promise not to get offended. \nMIA You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask. You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise. \nVINCENT Then let's just forget it. \nMIA That is an impossibility. Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility. \nVINCENT Is that a fact? \nMia nods her head: \"Yes.\" \nMIA Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission. \nVINCENT What do you think about what happened to Antwan? \nMIA Who's Antwan? \nVINCENT Tony Rocky Horror. \nMIA He fell out of a window. \nVINCENT That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you. \nMIA Is that a fact? \nVINCENT No it's not, it's just what I heard. \nMIA Who told you this? \nVINCENT They. \nMia and Vincent smile. \nMIA They talk a lot, don't they? \nVINCENT They certainly do. \nMIA Well don't by shy Vincent, what exactly did they say? \nVincent is slow to answer. \n", "test1_id": 2709, "test2_input": "Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall. \nFabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR. \nButch looks toward her, suddenly calm. \nBUTCH (to Fabienne) No! It's not your fault. (he approached her) You left it at the apartment. \nHe bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor. \nHe touches her hand, she flinches. \nBUTCH If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff. I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you. You ain't a mind reader. \nHe kisses her hand. Then rises. \nFabienne is still sniffling. \nButch goes to the closet. \nFABIENNE I'm sorry. \nButch puts on his high school jacket. \nBUTCH Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you. \nFABIENNE Why does it mean that? \nBUTCH Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch. \nFABIENNE Won't the gangsters be looking for you there? \nBUTCH That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split. \nRising from the floor. \nFABIENNE I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry. \nButch brings her close and puts his hands on her face. \nBUTCH Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you. (pause) I love you, remember? (he digs some money out of his wallet) Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast. \nFABIENNE Don't go. \nBUTCH I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie. \nFABIENNE Blueberry pie. \nBUTCH Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay?  Okay? \nFABIENNE Okay. \nHe kisses her once more and heads for the door. \nBUTCH Bye-bye, sugar pop. \nFABIENNE Bye. \nBUTCH I'm gonna take your Honda. \nFABIENNE Okay. \nAnd with that, he's out the door. \nFabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her. \nINT. HONDA (MOVING) \u0096 DAY \nButch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street. \nBUTCH Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it. \"Bedside table \u0096 on the kangaroo.\" I said the words: \"Don't forget my father's watch.\" \nEXT. CITY STREET \u0096 DAY \nThe little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it. \nCUT TO: \nA parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow pointing at one hour. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER \u0096 DAY \nButch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door. \nEXT. ALLEY \u0096 DAY \nButch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out. \nEXT. STREET \u0096 BUTCH'S APARTMENT \u0096 DAY \nEverything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside. Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home. \nButch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information. \nButch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard. \nAcross the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign sticks up in the air, with the name \"Teriyaki Donut\" and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice. \nEXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD \u0096 DAY \nButch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building. Once again, everything appears normal \u0096 the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door \u0096 nothing appears disturbed. \n", "test2_true": "Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it. \nINT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT \u0096 DAY \nHis apartment hasn't been touched. \nHe cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. Obviously, no one is there. \nButch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. \nHe takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it. \nWith carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he goes to the bedroom. \nHis bedroom is like the rest of the apartment \u0096 neat, clean and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of \"Ring Magazine\" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo. \nSure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. \nHe walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in the toaster. \nButch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something. \nWhat he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter. \nBUTCH (softly) Holy shit. \nHe picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it. \nThen... a toilet FLUSHES. \nButch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. There is someone behind it. \nLike a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing what to do. \nThe bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book \"MODESTY BLAISE\" by Peter O'Donnell. \nVincent and Butch lock eyes. \nVincent freezes. \nButch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's direction. \nNeither man opens his mouth. \nThen... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts. \nThat's all the situation needed. \nButch's finger HITS the trigger. \nMUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun. \nVincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY \u0096 LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom. \nBy the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is annihilated. \nButch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip. \nWith the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back on the kitchen counter. \nThen he exits the apartment, quickly. \nEXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD \u0096 DAY \nButch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard... \n...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street... \n...goes through the alley... \n...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT. \nEXT. HONDA \u0096 DAY \nButch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET \u0096 DAY \nThe Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building. \nINT. HONDA \u0096 DAY \nButch looks out the window at his former home. \nBUTCH That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.  They keep underestimatin' ya. \nThis makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with it. \nHe drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut. \nButch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see: \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD \nThe big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly. \nLaughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him. \nWhen Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS! \n", "test2_id": 2710, "test3_input": "Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits. \nVINCENT Who ya callin'? \nJULES A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake. \nVINCENT Where's Toluca Lake. \nJULES On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any other partners in 818. (into phone) Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules. (pause) Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit. We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours. \nINT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM \u0096 DAY \nJules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while Vincent stands behind him. \nJULES We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation. He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door. \nVINCENT If he kicks us out, whadda we do? \nJULES Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what. \nJules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at the sink. \nVINCENT Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin. \nJULES Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit. Don't forget who's doin' who a favor. \nVincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel. \nVINCENT If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass. \nWhen Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is stained with red. \nJULES What the fuck did you just do to his towel? \nVINCENT I was just dryin' my hands. \nJULES You're supposed to wash 'em first. \nVINCENT You watched me wash 'em. \nJULES I watched you get 'em wet. \nVINCENT I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job. \nJULES I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares? But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that... I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you... Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position. \nJULES Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He's your friend, you handle him. \nINT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN \u0096 MORNING \nThree men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe. \nJULES Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice. You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What flavor is this? \nJIMMIE Knock it off, Julie. \nJULES What? \nJIMMIE I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up. I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is. I'm the one who buys it, I know how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it. But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage. \nJULES Jimmie \u0096 \nJIMMIE \u0096 I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, \"Dead nigger storage?\" \nJules starts to \"Jimmie\" him \u0096 \nJIMMIE \u0096 answer to question. Did you see a sign out in front of my house that said, \"Dead nigger storage?\" \nJULES (playing along) Naw man, I didn't. \nJIMMIE You know why you didn't see that sign? \nJULES Why? \nJIMMIE 'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business! \nJules starts to \"Jimmie\" him. \nJIMMIE \u0096 I ain't through! Now don't you understand that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage counselor, no trial separation \u0096 fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced. The last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I wanna help ya out Julie, I really do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife doin' it. \nJULES Jimmie \u0096 \nJIMMIE \u0096 don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' you can say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Now she's workin' the graveyard shift at the hospital. She'll be comin' home in less than an hour and a half. Make your phone calls, talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house. \nJULES That's all we want. We don't wanna fuck up your shit. We just need to call our people to bring us in. \nJIMMIE Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's in my bedroom. \nINT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM \u0096 MORNING \nMarsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone. \nMARSELLUS ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya think she'll do? (pause) No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little? \nINT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM \u0096 MORNING \nJules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone. \nJULES You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do. \nMARSELLUS I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm doin' is contemplating the \"ifs.\" \n", "test3_true": "MARSELLUS You ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be comin' directly. \nJULES You sendin' The Wolf? \nMARSELLUS Feel better? \nJULES Shit Negro, that's all you had to say. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \u0096 MORNING \nThe CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka \"THE WOLF\". We also see The Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in. \nTHE WOLF (into phone) Is she the hysterical type? (pause) When she due? (jotting down) Give me the principals' names again? (jots down) Jules... \nWe SEE his book. The page has written on it: \n\"1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)\" \nTHE WOLF ...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie... \nHE WRITES: \n\"Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)\" \nTHE WOLF Expect a call around 10:30. It's about thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten. \nHe hangs up. We never see his face. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD OVER BLACK: \n\"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JIMMIE'S STREET \u0096 MORNING \nA silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a dime in front of Jimmie's house. \nA ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG. \nINT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE \u0096 MORNING \nJimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at Jimmie. \nTHE WOLF You're Jimmie, right? This is your house? \nJIMMIE Yeah. \nTHE WOLF (stick his hand out) I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems. \nJIMMIE Good, 'cause we got one. \nTHE WOLF So I heard. May I come in? \nJIMMIE Please do. \nIn the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up. \nTHE WOLF You must be Jules, which would make you Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie? \nJIMMIE \nTHE WOLF Your wife, Bonnie... (refers to his pad) ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that correct? \nJIMMIE Uh-huh. \nTHE WOLF I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it none too much. \nJIMMIE She won't at that. \nTHE WOLF That gives us forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say when I say it, should by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it. \nINT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE \u0096 MORNING \nThe three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, circling it. \nTHE WOLF Jimmie? \nJIMMIE Yes. \nTHE WOLF Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee in there. Would you make me a cup? \nJIMMIE Sure, how do you take it? \nTHE WOLF Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar. \nJimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination. \nTHE WOLF About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything? \nJULES Aside from how it looks, the car's cool. \nTHE WOLF Positive?  Don't get me out on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work. \nJULES Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top. \nTHE WOLF Good enough, let's go back to the kitchen. \n", "test3_id": 2711}

{"test1_input": "VINCENT It's not a date. \nJules just looks at him. \nINT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) \u0096 MORNING \nTHREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out. \nOne of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway. \nJULES Hey kids. \nThe two men stroll inside. \nThe three young caught-off-guard Guys are: \nMARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner. \nROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a \"Flock of Seagulls\" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand. \nBRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut. \nVincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking. \nJULES How you boys doin'? \nNo answer. \nJULES (to Brett) Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question. \nBRETT We're doin' okay. \nAs Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys. \nJULES Do you know who we are? \nBrett shakes his head: \"No.\" \nJULES We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya? \nNo answer. \nJULES (to Brett) Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right? \nBRETT I'm Brett. \nJULES I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett? \nBRETT I remember him. \nJULES Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'? \nBRETT Hamburgers. \nJULES Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers? \nBRETT Cheeseburgers. \nJULES No, I mean where did you get'em? MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the- Box, where? \nBRETT Big Kahuna Burger. \nJULES Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they? \nBRETT They're good. \nJULES Mind if I try one of yours? \nBRETT No. \nJULES Yours is this one, right? \nBRETT Yeah. \nJules grabs the burger and take a bite of it. \nJULES Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger. (to Vincent) Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger? \nVINCENT No. \nJules holds out the Big Kahuna. \nJULES You wanna bite, they're real good. \nVINCENT I ain't hungry. \nJULES Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger. (to Brett) You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France? \nBRETT No. \nJULES Tell 'em, Vincent. \nVINCENT Royale with Cheese. \nJULES Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that? \nBRETT Because of the metric system? \nJULES Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system. (he points to a fast food drink cup) What's in this? \nBRETT Sprite. \n", "test1_true": "BRETT Sure. \nJules grabs the cup and takes a sip. \nJULES Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot! (to Roger) You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we're here for? \nRoger nods his head: \"Yes.\" \nJULES Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid. \nMARVIN It's under the be \u0096 \nJULES \u0096 I don't remember askin' you a goddamn thing. (to Roger) You were sayin'? \nROGER It's under the bed. \nVincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out a black snap briefcase. \nVINCENT Got it. \nVincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent just stares at it, transfixed. \nJULES We happy? \nNo answer from the transfixed Vincent. \nJULES Vincent! \nVincent looks up at Jules. \nJULES We happy? \nClosing the case. \nVINCENT We're happy. \nBRETT (to Jules) Look, what's your name? I got his name's Vincent, but what's yours? \nJULES My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your ass outta this shit. \nBRETT I just want you to know how sorry we are about how fucked up things got between us and Mr. Wallace. When we entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions \u0096 \nAs Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair. \nVince smiles to himself. Jules has got style. \nBrett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding. \nJULES (to Brett) Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that.  Please, continue. I believe you were saying something about \"best intentions.\" \nBrett can't say a word. \nJULES Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like? \nBrett still can't speak. \nJules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in front of an interrogator. \nJULES What country you from! \nBRETT (petrified) What? \nJULES \"What\" ain't no country I know! Do they speak English in \"What?\" \nBRETT (near heart attack) What? \nJULES English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it? \nBRETT Yes. \nJULES Then you understand what I'm sayin'? \nBRETT Yes. \nJULES Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like! \nBRETT (out of fear) What? \nJules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's cheek. \nJULES Say \"What\" again! C'mon, say \"What\" again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say \"What\" one more goddamn time! \nBrett is regressing on the spot. \nJULES Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like! \nBrett does his best. \nBRETT Well he's... he's... black \u0096 \nJULES \u0096 go on! \nBRETT ...and he's... he's... bald \u0096 \nJULES \u0096 does he look like a bitch?! \nBRETT (without thinking) What? \nJules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder. \n", "test1_id": 2709, "test2_input": "Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to take him wherever he wants to go. \nBUTCH (to himself in French with English subtitles) Fabienne my love, our adventure begins. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) \u0096 NIGHT \nEsmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic jacket. He leans in the driver's side window. \nESMARELDA Forty-five sixty. \nHanding her the money. \nBUTCH Merci beaucoup. And here's a little something for the effort. \nButch holds up a hundred dollar bill. \nEsmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds it out of reach. \nBUTCH Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em? \nESMARELDA The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans. \nHe gives her the bill. \nBUTCH Bon soir, Esmarelda. \nESMARELDA (in Spanish) Sleep well, Butch. \nHe tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. She drives off. \nINT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) \u0096 NIGHT \nButch enters and turns on the light. \nLying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE. \nFABIENNE Keep the light off. \nButch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again. \nBUTCH Is that better, sugar pop? \nFABIENNE Oui. Hard day at the office? \nBUTCH Pretty hard. I got into a fight. \nFABIENNE Poor baby. Can we make spoons? \nButch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind. \nWhen Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in babytalk. \nFABIENNE I was looking at myself in the mirror. \nBUTCH Uh-huh? \nFABIENNE I wish I had a pot. \nBUTCH You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot? \nFABIENNE A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy. \nBUTCH Well you should be happy, 'cause you do. \nFABIENNE Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did \"Lucky Star,\" it's not the same thing. \nBUTCH I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly. \nFABIENNE The difference is huge. \nBUTCH You want me to have a pot? \nFABIENNE No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it. \nBUTCH You think guys would find that attractive? \nFABIENNE I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same. \nBUTCH If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in it. \nFABIENNE You'd punch me in my belly? \nBUTCH Right in the belly. \nFABIENNE I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe. \nBUTCH You'd do that to me? \nFABIENNE Yes! \nBUTCH Did you get everything, sugar pop? \nFABIENNE Yes, I did. \nBUTCH Good job. \nFABIENNE Did everything go as planned? \nBUTCH You didn't listen to the radio? \n", "test2_true": "BUTCH I won alright. \nFABIENNE Are you still retiring? \nBUTCH Sure am. \nFABIENNE What about the man you fought? \nBUTCH Floyd retired too. \nFABIENNE (smiling) Really?! He won't be fighting no more?! \nBUTCH Not no more. \nFABIENNE So it all worked out in the finish? \nBUTCH We ain't at the finish, baby. \nFabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss. \nFABIENNE We're in a lot of danger, aren't we? \nButch nods his head: \"yes.\" \nFABIENNE If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they? \nButch nods his head: \"yes.\" \nFABIENNE But they won't find us, will they? \nButch nods his head: \"no.\" \nFABIENNE Do you still want me to go with you? \nButch nods his head: \"yes.\" \nFABIENNE I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance - \nButch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch. \nFabienne reacts. \nFABIENNE Say it! \nBUTCH Fabienne, I want you to be with me. \nFABIENNE Forever? \nBUTCH ...and ever. \nFabienne lies her head back. \nButch continues to massage her crotch. \nFABIENNE Do you love me? \nBUTCH Oui. \nFABIENNE Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure? \nButch kisses her on the mouth. \nBUTCH Will you kiss it? \nShe nods her head: \"yes.\" \nFABIENNE But you first. \nButch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame. \nFABIENNE (in French, with English subtitles) Butch my love, the adventure begins. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP: \nMOTEL ROOM \nSame motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up. \nShe's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his head out. \nBUTCH I think I cracked a rib. \nFABIENNE Giving me oral pleasure? \nBUTCH No retard, from the fight. \nFABIENNE Don't call me retard. \nBUTCH (in a Mongoloid voice) My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby! \nFABIENNE Shut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid voice. \nBUTCH Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back!  Can I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful Tulip. \nFABIENNE Oh I like that, I like being called a tulip. Tulip is much better than Mongoloid. \nShe finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head. \n", "test2_id": 2710, "test3_input": "BUTCH I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I called you a retard, but I took it back. \nShe hands him a towel. \nBUTCH Merci beaucoup. \nFABIENNE Butch? \nBUTCH (drying his head) Yes, lemon pie. \nFABIENNE Where are we going to go? \nBUTCH I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this. But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever. I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there. \nFABIENNE So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora? \nBUTCH You betcha. And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico. \nFABIENNE But I do not speak Spanish. \nBUTCH You don't speak Bora Boran either. Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el zapataria? \nFABIENNE What does that mean? \nBUTCH Where's the shoe store? \nFABIENNE Donde esta el zapataria? \nBUTCH Excellent pronunciation. You'll be my little mama ceta in no time. \nButch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her teeth. \nButch keeps on from the other room. \nBUTCH (O.S.) Que hora es? \nFABIENNE Que hora es? \nBUTCH (O.S.) What time is it? \nFABIENNE What time is it? \nBUTCH (O.S.) Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean. \nFabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or two, then she remember something. \nFABIENNE Butch. \nShe walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed. \nShe looks at him for a moment. \nFABIENNE Forget it. \nShe exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP: \nMOTEL ROOM \u0096 MORNING \nSAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still asleep in bed. \nFabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still wears the terry cloth robe from the night before. \nON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking on the entire Vietnamese army in the film \"THE LOSERS\". \nButch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing him. \nHis start startles Fabienne. \nFABIENNE Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream? \nButch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus. \nButch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp. \nBUTCH What are you watching? \nFABIENNE A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name. \nBUTCH Are you watchin' it? \nFabienne enters the room. \nFABIENNE In a way. Why? Would you like for me to switch it off? \nBUTCH Would you please? \nShe reaches over and turns off the TV. \nBUTCH It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war. \nFABIENNE What was it about? \nBUTCH How should I know, you were the one watchin' it. \nFabienne laughs. \nFABIENNE No, imbecile, what was your dream about? \n", "test3_true": "FABIENNE You just woke up from it. \nBUTCH Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I don't remember. \nFABIENNE Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning. I didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams. I always remember mine. Did you know you talk in your sleep? \nBUTCH I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk in my sleep? \nFABIENNE You did last night. \nBUTCH What did I say? \nLaying on top of him. \nFABIENNE I don't know. I couldn't understand you. \nShe kisses Butch. \nFABIENNE Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes. \nBUTCH One more kiss and I'll get up. \nFabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss. \nFABIENNE Satisfied? \nBUTCH Yep. \nFABIENNE Then get up, lazy bones. \nButch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabienne brought. \nBUTCH What time is it? \nFABIENNE Almost nine in the morning. What time does our train arrive? \nBUTCH Eleven. \nFABIENNE I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages. \nBUTCH (surprised at her potential appetite) Anything to drink with that? \nButch is finished dressing. \nFABIENNE (referring to his clothes) Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie. \nAs he goes through the suitcase. \nBUTCH Pie for breakfast? \nFABIENNE Any time of the day is a good time for pie. Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes. And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese \u0096 \nBUTCH \u0096 where's my watch? \nFABIENNE It's there. \nBUTCH No, it's not. It's not here. \nFABIENNE Have you looked? \nBy now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase. \nBUTCH Yes I've fuckin' looked!! \nHe's now throwing clothes. \nBUTCH What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! Are you sure you got it? \nFabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way. \nFABIENNE Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer \nBUTCH \u0096 on the little kangaroo. \nFABIENNE Yes, it was on your little kangaroo. \nBUTCH Well it's not here! \nFABIENNE (on the verge of tears) Well it should be! \nBUTCH Oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not. So where is it? \nFabienne is crying and scared. \nButch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing. \nBUTCH Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' watch. You know what my father went through to git me that watch?... I don't wanna get into it right now... but he went through a lot. Now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch. Now think, did you get it? \nFABIENNE I believe so... \nBUTCH You believe so? You either did, or you didn't, now which one is it? \nFABIENNE Then I did. \nBUTCH Are you sure? \nFABIENNE (shaking) No. \nButch freaks out, he punches the air. \n", "test3_id": 2711}

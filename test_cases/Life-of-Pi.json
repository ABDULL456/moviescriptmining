{"test1_input": "Mamaji stands admiring the Piscine Molitor, a pool of sparkling magnificence. Attractive French men and women in bathing suits, the setting a celebration of idealized beauty. \nADULT PI (V.O.) One day Mamaji said to my father that of all the pools in the world, the most beautiful was a public pool in Paris. That the water there was so clear you could make your morning coffee with it, that a single swim there changed his life. \nMamaji dives into the crystal clear water - and we follow, taking in the divine miracle of his underwater journey across the pool. \nADULT PI (V.O.) Before I was born, he said to my father, \"If you want your son to have a clean soul, you must take him one day to swim in the Piscine Molitor.\" I never understood why my father took this so much to heart... \n9    INT. PI'S HOME, MONTREAL - DAY                                9 \nADULT PI ... but he did, and I was named \"Piscine Molitor Patel.\" \n10   EXT. PI'S PRIMARY SCHOOL, 1972 - DAY                         10 \nPI (AGE 11) leans against the railing of a balcony, reading \"L'Ile Mysterieuse (The Mysterious Island)\" by Jules Verne. \nADULT PI (V.O.) Imagine me trying to explain that name to my schoolmates. I barely made it to the age of eleven before... \nA boy (BULLY #1) calls up to him from the courtyard below. \nBULLY #1 Hey PISCINE! \nPi glances down, all the boys in the courtyard watching him. \nBULLY #1 (CONT'D) Are you Pissing right now? \nPi freezes. The other boys laugh uncontrollably. \nANOTHER BOY Look at him he's Pissing! \nADULT PI (VO) With one word my name went from an elegant French swimming pool to a stinking Indian latrine. I was Pissing everywhere. \n11   I/E. SCHOOLYARD, 1972 - DAY                                 11 \nBOYS in school uniform kick a ball. Pi attempts to join. Bully #2 intercepts the pass. \nBULLY #2 No Pissing in the schoolyard! \n12   INT. SCIENCE CLASS, 1972 - DAY                              12 \nADULT PI (V.O.) Even the teachers started doing it - not deliberately, of course... \nSCIENCE TEACHER So then - what might occur if we release gas too quickly? Pissing? \n", "test1_true": "BOY He said Pissing! \nSCIENCE TEACHER That's enough - order! \nADULT PI (V.O.) When we returned the next year for our first day of school, I was prepared. \nSC. 13 INT. INDIAN HISTORY CLASS, 1973 - DAY 13 \nClass is held in a large open room. Roll call. \nBOY Present sir. \nHISTORY TEACHER Piscine Patel... \nPI - AGE 12, rises, crosses to the front. \nPI (AT 12) Good morning. I am Piscine Molitor Patel, known to all as...

(He writes \"3.14.\") 3.14. PI. \nPi underlines his name, faces the class. \nHISTORY TEACHER Very impressive, Pi. Now sit down. \nWRITER (V.O.) And from then on you were Pi? \nADULT PI (V.O.) Well, no. Not quite ... \nAs Pi returns to his seat, Bully #2 leans forward, whispering: \nBULLY #2 Nice try, Pissing. \nADULT PI (V.O.) But I still had the whole day ahead of me. French Class was next... \n14   INT. FRENCH CLASS, 1973 - DAY                                14 \nPi repeats his act in French, 3.14159265 on the board. \nPI (12) Je m'appelle Piscine Molitor Patel - dit'Pi'... \nADULT PI (V.O.) Then Geography... \n", "test1_id": 2730, "test2_input": "RAVI ... I'm sleeping. \nPI It's a thunderstorm! Let's go watch! \nRAVI Are you crazy? We'll get hit by lightning. \nPI No, we won't. It'll hit the bridge first. \nRAVI Don't tempt a storm, Pi. \nOn the other side of the narrow room, Mother shifts uncomfortably on the double bed she shares with Father. \n75   INT. SHIP HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                               75 \nPi heads upstairs to the deck. \n76   EXT. THE CARGO DECK - CONTINUOUS                             76 \nThe deck of the ship is dark. Pi steps out into a bracing rain and walks to the rail, wind whipping his hair. He laughs, exhilarated, as rain splashes over his face. Throwing arms wide, Pi dances in imitation of Anandi's dance, slipping more than once on the rain-soaked deck, shouting in giddy adolescent triumph. \nPI More rain, lord of storms! Let it rage! \nHe finishes, laughing as he falls against the railing. The deck lights suddenly all come on at once; a warning alarm sounds over the loudspeakers. \nPi slips to the front of the deck and stands up, watching in horror as a wave washes over the bow, carrying several sailors overboard. He pushes himself away from the railing and runs back down below. \nINT. THE STAIRS TO THE CABINS/LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS \nPi stumbles down the tilted staircase. \nPI AMMA! APPA! RAVI! GET OUT, GET OUT! \nHalfway down, Pi hits water. He dives, searching for his family. The hall lights flicker - the passage falls dark an instant before the emergency lights come on in the water below, which nearly reaches the ceiling. Pi dives, trying to swim against the flowing current; he's astonished to find a ZEBRA swimming toward him, passing overhead. He tries to swim further, but the enormous force of rushing water and air is too great; he scrambles backward, groping toward the stairwell. \nEXT. THE CARGO DECK - CONTINUOUS \nPi bursts on deck, coughing and gagging for air. \nPI HELP!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!! \nPi sees movement - animals running. He scrambles toward them, the ship groaning as it lists sideways. \nOxen and deer are visible on the far side of the deck, backlit by emergency lights; Pi hears monkeys screeching, the clatter of hoofs pounding. In the distance, Sailors shout orders in panicked voices. \n", "test2_true": "PI (CONT'D) Please save my family! \nJAPANESE CAPTAIN Don't scare. Okay? Wait stay here. \nHe grabs a life vest and starts to put it on Pi. \nJAPANESE CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Here, put this on! \nPI You have to help them, please! Oh no my family, please. You have to help them, my family is back there. \nJAPANESE CAPTAIN We don't have time. \nThe Taiwanese Sailor jumps onto the ship. \nTAIWANESE SAILOR We help. You must go. \nPI Who let all the animals out? \nThey shove a life vest over Pi's head. \nSAILOR #1 You have to go now. \nPI No wait! My father - he can't swim - \nJAPANESE CAPTAIN This is your last chance--just go! \nPI No please! \nThey guide Pi to the side, where a section of the ship's railing has been removed to give access to the lifeboat. They push Pi over the edge; Pi falls onto the lifeboat, bouncing on the protective tarp that is still stretched taut across the bow. He grabs at the rope holding the bow, trying not to slip off. The sailors are shouting at the French cook, who stands at the stern. \nSAILOR #1 Hey! You! What are you doing?! \nFRENCH COOK Loosen the lines! Bring it down! \nSAILOR #1 Tie it down! Tie it down! \nFRENCH COOK (to the sailors:) Jump! Jump! \nThe sailors look towards the upper deck. Pi follows their looks and watches in horror as a zebra launches itself over the side of the ship, careening through the air toward the safety of the lifeboat. The French cook staggers backward and jumps out of the way, falling to the water below. Pi throws up his arms as the life boat starts to drop. The zebra arcs through the air, missing the tarp, landing on the exposed stern with a sickening thud, shattering the rear bench. The force sends the rig lines spinning. \nThe lifeboat plummets to the water below. The impact spins it around, nearly washing Pi overboard. He is left clinging to the back of the tarp, the zebra on the floor of the lifeboat before him. As the lifeboat drops down the side of the swell, Pi slides to the front of the tarp. The Tsimtsum's propeller rises behind him. \nAs Pi steadies himself, a swell lifts the lifeboat, crashing it onto the deck of the Tsimtsum. It drops back into the sea, rolling over completely. The vessel instantly rights itself - the lifeboat is designed to be virtually unsinkable. Pi lands on the lifeboat's floorboards, next to the zebra. \n", "test2_id": 2731, "test3_input": "108    EXT. THE RAFT/THE LIFEBOAT - A SHORT TIME LATER             108 \nPi reels himself over to the lifeboat. He moves around to the side of the boat, grabs the dorado by the tail and throws the entire fish over the side and into the stern. It lands with a thud, and from somewhere inside the boat, Richard Parker lets out a grunt of surprise. \nAfter a moment, Pi hears the wet mashing noises of the tiger devouring the fish. As Pi pushes away from the lifeboat, he puts the whistle in his mouth, blowing a few sharp blasts to remind Richard Parker who's in charge. \n112A   EXT. THE RAFT - NIGHT                                   112A \nA full moon. All around the raft, the green surface of the water glows with millions of flecks of glowing plankton - and beneath the surface, fish swim past at multiple depths and in multiple directions. Pi brushes his fingers over the surface of the water. The surface ripples where he touched it, the plankton glowing more brightly, the effect moving outward and downward through the water, an ever-expanding ring. \nPi hears a faint, rapid succession of blows. He peers into the encroaching darkness but can see nothing. Richard Parker is nowhere to be seen. The blows stop and Pi returns his attention to the light show below. \nPi senses movement deep within the water, a cone of rushing energy pressing up toward the luminescent surface. \nSuddenly, the glowing silhouette of a huge creature wrapped in phosphorescent plankton - a HUMPBACK WHALE - streaks to the surface nearby, its mouth gaping. Fifty feet in length, it thrusts itself up into the air. Pi barely has time to react, gripping the raft and holding on for his life as the whale comes crashing back down into the water. \nThe animal slips back into the ocean, creating a wave that sends the raft swirling across the water's surface, submerging for a moment, then bouncing off the side of the lifeboat. \nPi's neatly-stacked water cans and biscuits tumble over the side of the raft and into the ocean. \nThe whale disappears into the night, leaving Pi open-mouthed and shaken. \nPI (V.O.) Of course, I brought all the biscuits and water on the raft with me to keep them safe. Idiot. \n116   EXT. THE RAFT/LIFEBOAT - LATE AFTERNOON                  116 \nA calm day; gentle waves. Afternoon, the sun beating down. Pi wears his shirt wrapped around his head to hold off the heat. \nPI (V.O. - CONT'D) Hunger can change everything you ever thought you knew about yourself. \nPi uses his knife to cut another scratch into the hull. There are 38 scratches on the side of the lifeboat. He glances down, staring longingly at the fish that swim just beneath the raft, then looks across the lifeboat, where the gaff lies hooked in the tarp close to the tiger's end of the boat. Richard Parker is nowhere to be seen. \nPi reaches out with the boat hook to try to snag the gaff, but it is hooked deeply into the tarp. He lays the boat hook on the tarp and climbs aboard, crawling forward to free the gaff. As he wiggles the hook free, Richard Parker's head pops out from beneath the tarp only a few feet away. \nPi's winces, prepared for an attack. In an instant, he's struck hard across the face - a stunning blow that sends him backward onto the tarp. \nPause. Pi opens one eye. Richard Parker hasn't moved. Pi looks down - a slender grey-blue fish with wings is flopping about on the tarp. Pi has been hit by a flying fish. \nRichard Parker has seen the flying fish as well. He rises to his haunches. Pi grabs the flying fish and tosses it to Richard Parker. \nPI (CONT'D) Here, it's yours. \nThe tiger stands, jaws opening in anticipation... \n", "test3_true": "The air around the boat whirs   to life as they are struck from all directions by a school of   flying fish that descends upon them like a swarm of locusts.   Some sail clear over the boat; a number crash into the side.   Other, less fortunate fish land in the boat, where they start   a racket of flapping and flailing. Pi yelps in anguish   as he is struck repeatedly. \nThe school of fish is being pursued through the ocean by tuna. It is a feeding frenzy - the ocean boils with jumping fish and snapping jaws. \nRichard Parker becomes totally absorbed in the kill, leaping, blocking, and batting down as many of the fish as he can. \nA fat, three-foot long yellowfin tuna lands onboard, cracking hard against the center bench and falling, stunned and twitching, into the boat. \nPi sees Richard Parker's head swivel in his direction. In a moment of insanity brought on by hunger, Pi reaches back and grabs the boat hook from the tarp, shoving it aggressively into the tiger's face just as Richard Parker launches forward. \nThe boat hook catches Richard Parker square in the mouth; the tiger staggers back in shock and growls in outrage. Pi rises up to his full height, staring directly into the tiger's eyes and shouting in fury, his gaze wide, his posture defiant. \nPI (CONT'D) MINE!!!! MINE!!! AHHH!! AAAAHHHH!!!! \nBoy and tiger face off for several seconds, both panting, neither blinking nor showing fear, as the rain of fish gradually slows around them. \nRichard Parker turns his focus from Pi and takes in the situation around him. Realizing that he stands up to his knees in a pile of flying fish, he turns his attention to a more convenient meal. \nPi uses the gaff to snag the tuna, shoving it to the farthest edge of the bow. As he rises, late afternoon light casts golden flames across the surface of the water, throwing Pi into backlight. \nPi picks up the boat hook and turns to face Richard Parker. \nEXT. THE RAFT - SUNSET \nPi takes a small piece of tuna and gingerly raises it to his lips, tasting flesh for the first time. A pause as he savors the taste, considering... and then hunger takes him over. He grabs at the tuna, stuffing pieces into his mouth, devouring it. \nA132   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                 A132 \nPi uses a bandage from the first aid kit to wrap a cut on his leg. As he works, he glances back toward the boat, deep in contemplation. \nPI (V.O.) I can't risk my life every time I have to climb onto the boat for supplies. It's time to settle this. If we're going to live together, we have to learn to communicate. \nB132   EXT. THE RAFT - DAY                                     B132 \nPi reaches into the stern, prying loose a seven-foot strip of wooden molding that lines the front edge of the seats. \nPI (V.O.) Maybe Richard Parker cannot be tamed, but with God's will, he can be trained. \nPi works intently with his knife, whittling the strip of molding into a long tapered wand with a handgrip on one end. \n133    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                  133 \nPi crosses the tarp, approaching Richard Parker with his new training stick. \n", "test3_id": 2732}

{"train": "LIFE OF PI \nWritten by \nDavid Magee \nBased on the original novel by \nYann Martel \n1   EXT. PONDICHERRY ZOO, INDIA, 1961 - DAY                      1 \nCREDITS OVER: a magical fairy tale world in collage - images of fantastic creatures striped and spotted, hoofed and horned. \nGoats and warthogs mingle in an open field; a baby giraffe tries to reach leaves over a fence; rhinos roll happily in rich red mud, looking like giant muddy boulders, while nearby, black and white Malayan tapirs cool themselves in watering holes. \nExotic monkeys with comical faces cling lovingly to one another, swing from trees, climb over one another, prance and screech; a probiscus monkey with a 'Jimmy Durante' nose pointing out through the plane of the screen. Flamingoes strut about in the aviary, their pink feathers reflected in the water. \nA sloth droops lazily from a tree branch, unfazed, while a nearby hummingbird zips manically from flower to flower like Tinkerbell... \n... the Pondicherry zoo is a children's paradise nestled in a botanical garden. \nWRITER (V.O.) You were raised in a zoo? \n3   EXT. PONDICHERRY ZOO, INDIA, 1961 - DAY                      3 \nThere's a flurry of activity in the animal clinic behind a monitor lizard that wanders the main path. ZOO WORKERS gather in the doorway, talking excitedly. \nNo one notices the lizard. \nADULT PI (V.O.) Born and raised in Pondicherry, in what was the French part of India. My father owned the zoo, and I was delivered on short notice by a herpetologist who was there to check on the Bengal Monitor Lizard. \nThe zoo owner (FATHER - late 20s) hurries down the path as quickly as his heavy leg brace will allow and hurries into the animal clinic. \nADULT PI (V.O.) Mother and I were both healthy... \nThe lizard crawls away. \nADULT PI (V.O.) but the poor lizard escaped and was trampled by a frightened cassowary... \n5   INT. PI'S HOME, KITCHEN, MONTREAL - DAY                       5 \nA modest row house. There is a French influence to the decor, along with books and artwork that celebrate the spiritual. \nMamaji stands admiring the Piscine Molitor, a pool of sparkling magnificence. Attractive French men and women in bathing suits, the setting a celebration of idealized beauty. \nADULT PI (V.O.) One day Mamaji said to my father that of all the pools in the world, the most beautiful was a public pool in Paris. That the water there was so clear you could make your morning coffee with it, that a single swim there changed his life. \nMamaji dives into the crystal clear water - and we follow, taking in the divine miracle of his underwater journey across the pool. \nADULT PI (V.O.) Before I was born, he said to my father, \"If you want your son to have a clean soul, you must take him one day to swim in the Piscine Molitor.\" I never understood why my father took this so much to heart... \n9    INT. PI'S HOME, MONTREAL - DAY                                9 \nADULT PI ... but he did, and I was named \"Piscine Molitor Patel.\" \n10   EXT. PI'S PRIMARY SCHOOL, 1972 - DAY                         10 \nPI (AGE 11) leans against the railing of a balcony, reading \"L'Ile Mysterieuse (The Mysterious Island)\" by Jules Verne. \nADULT PI (V.O.) Imagine me trying to explain that name to my schoolmates. I barely made it to the age of eleven before... \nA boy (BULLY #1) calls up to him from the courtyard below. \nBULLY #1 Hey PISCINE! \nPi glances down, all the boys in the courtyard watching him. \nBULLY #1 (CONT'D) Are you Pissing right now? \nPi freezes. The other boys laugh uncontrollably. \nANOTHER BOY Look at him he's Pissing! \nADULT PI (VO) With one word my name went from an elegant French swimming pool to a stinking Indian latrine. I was Pissing everywhere. \n11   I/E. SCHOOLYARD, 1972 - DAY                                 11 \nBOYS in school uniform kick a ball. Pi attempts to join. Bully #2 intercepts the pass. \nBULLY #2 No Pissing in the schoolyard! \n12   INT. SCIENCE CLASS, 1972 - DAY                              12 \nADULT PI (V.O.) Even the teachers started doing it - not deliberately, of course... \nSCIENCE TEACHER So then - what might occur if we release gas too quickly? Pissing? \n15   EXT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS, 1973 - DAY                             15 \nClass is held out of doors in a courtyard. Pi, at a portable chalkboard, writes and says: 3.14159265358979323846. \nPI (12) These are the first twenty decimal places of Pi. \nADULT PI (V.O.) My last class of the day was Mathematics.... \n16   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, 1973 - DAY                              16 \nA LIBRARIAN runs down the hall, a huge book tucked under his arm, followed by dozens of students. He reaches Pi's class, pushes his way through the crowd. \nLIBRARIAN Slowly, Slowly! Slowly, Slowly! \n17   INT. MATH CLASS, 1973 - CONTINUOUS                           17 \nClose on Pi writing digits. Pull back - the entire chalkboard is filled with numbers. All watching are stunned. The librarian compares Pi's writing to the math book. \nLIBRARIAN It is right... He's really doing this! \nStudents clap and cheer - even the bullies. Several chant along with him as he writes: \nALL 1! 4! 9! 3! 1! PI! PI! PI! \nADULT PI (VO) By the end of that day, I was Pi Patel, school legend. \n18   INT. PI'S KITCHEN - DAY                               18 \nThe writer laughs, then ventures onto a new topic. \nWRITER Mamaji tells me you're a legend among sailors, too. Out there all alone - \nADULT PI I don't even know how to sail. And I wasn't alone out there. Richard Parker was with me. \nWRITER Richard Parker...? Mamaji didn't tell me everything. He just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal. \nADULT PI So what were you doing in Pondicherry? \nWRITER Writing a novel. \nADULT PI By the way, I enjoyed your first book. The new one, is it set in India? \nWRITER No, Portugal, actually. But it's cheaper living in India. \n18   INT. PI'S HOME - CONTINUED                                   18 \nADULT PI When the French handed Pondicherry back to us in 1954, the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order. \n25   EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE, 1955 - DAY                                25 \nThe sign on the gate reads: \"JARDIN BOTANIQUE DE PONDICHERRY.\" \nADULT PI (V.O.) My father, who was a clever businessman, came up with one. (MORE) \nADULT PI (V.O.) (CONT'D) He ran a hotel, and he got the idea to open a zoo in the local Botanical Gardens instead. \nFather oversees a SIGN PAINTER as the painter who adds the words 'AND ZOO' to the sign. \n26   EXT. THE NURSERY - CONTINUOUS                                26 \nWOMEN WORKERS plant and dig in the Botanical Gardens nursery. As MOTHER (refined - 20's) passes by, she admonishes a worker who pulls up a sapling with too much force. \nADULT PI (V.O.) As it also happened, my mother was a botanist in the Gardens. They met, married, and a year later my brother Ravi was born. I came two years after that. \n27   INT. PI'S HOME, OUTER ROOM, MONTREAL - DAY                   27 \nWRITER It sounds magical, growing up in- \nThe Writer stops, realizing that Pi's eyes are closed in prayer. The Writer watches in awkward silence, his head halfbowed. \nADULT PI Amen. Let's eat. \nWRITER I didn't know Hindus said 'amen.' \nADULT PI (As he serves food:) Catholic Hindus do. \nWRITER Catholic Hindus? \nADULT PI We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods instead of just one. \nWRITER But you're a Hindu first? \nPI None of us knows God    until someone introduces us. I was    first introduced to God as    a Hindu. There are 330 million gods    in the Hindu religion - how can I    not come to know a few of them? \n28   EXT. OUTSIDE THE PATEL HOME, 1966 - NIGHT                 28 \nYOUNG PI (5) and Ravi listen to Mother quietly singing a gentle tune as she kneels before their home, using rice powder to draw a Kolam pattern - a geometric design meant to bring the home prosperity. \nRavi walks up to Pi, coins in hand, and whispers. \nRAVI (14) Challenge. I'll give you two rupees. Run into that church and drink the Holy water. \n37   INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH, 1973 - DAY                             37 \nPi leans down to the font beside the door and drinks. He's about to leave again when he notices the stations of the cross depicted on plaques that encircle the church. \nPRIEST You must be thirsty. Here, I brought you this. \nNot knowing what else to do, Pi takes the glass and drinks. An awkward pause as he searches for something - anything - to say. He finally points up to one of the paintings. \nPI Why would a god do that? Why would he send his own son to suffer for the sins of ordinary people? \nThe Priest smiles down upon Pi. \nPRIEST Because He loves us. God made Himself approachable to us - human - so we could understand Him. (MORE) \nPRIEST (CONT'D) We can't understand God in all His perfection, but we can understand God's son and His suffering as we would a brother's. \n38   INT. PI'S DINING ROOM, MONTREAL - INTERCUT/CONTINUOUS      38 \nADULT PI That made no sense. Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty? What kind of love is that? \n39   EXT. PLANTATION HOME, MUNNAR, 1973 - DAY                   39 \nRavi and other kids play cricket. Pi sits by a stream, lost in thought. \nADULT PI (V.O.) But this Son - I couldn't get Him out of my head. \n41   INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH, MUNNAR, 1973 - DAY 41                41 \nPi stands quizzing the priest near the altar. \nPI If God is so perfect and we're not, why would He want to create all this? Why does He need us at all? \nPRIEST All you have to know is that He loves us. \"God so loved the world that He gave His only Son.\" This Son taught us to love one another... \nThe priest's words continue as Pi leans in, listening. \nADULT PI (V.O.) The more I listened to the priest, the more I came to like this Son of God. \n42   INT. PI'S BEDROOM, 1973 - DAY                              42 \nMOTHER That is true. Your father is right. Science can teach us more about what's out there - (With a hand to her heart:) - but not what is in here. Art, music, literature - they all spring from our faith. \nFATHER Some eat meat, some eat vegetable. I do not expect us all to agree about everything. But I would much rather have you believe in something I don't agree with than to accept everything blindly. And that begins with thinking rationally. Do you understand? \nPi nods. \nFATHER (CONT'D) Good. \nPause. \nPI I would like to be baptized. \nFather and Mother react. Ravi stifles a laugh. \n46   EXT. PI'S STREET - DAY                                    46 \nPi walks down the front steps of his row house, stretching and rubbing his belly at the end of a good meal. The writer follows. \nWRITER So you're a Christian and a Muslim? \nADULT PI And a Hindu, of course. \nWRITER And a Jew, I suppose? \nADULT PI Oh, well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the University. And why not? Faith is a house with many rooms. \nWRITER But no room for doubt? \nADULT PI Plenty. On every floor. Doubt is useful. It keeps faith a living thing. After all, you can't know the strength of your faith until it's been tested. \n47   INT. THE TIGER FEEDING AREA, 1973, PART 1   - DAY            47 \nPi (12) and Ravi (14) cross into a drab cement enclosure behind the tiger exhibit. A hallway with closed gates at both ends leads out to the exhibit. \nRAVI Where's Selvam? We shouldn't be in here without him. \nPI Stop worrying. I have seen him do this a thousand times. I want to meet our new tiger. \nHe drops meat on the floor by the bars. \nRAVI Pi!... \nPI Hello! Richard Parker! \nFATHER (In Tamil:) Do it. Go ahead. \nSelvam sets the goat down and ties a piece of rope around the animal's neck. \nFATHER (CONT'D) (To the boys:) Animals don't think like we do; people who forget that get themselves killed. That tiger is not your friend. When you look into his eyes, you are seeing your own emotions reflected back at you - nothing else. \nSelvam ties the goat to the bars at the gate area where Pi had been about to feed Richard Parker. \nRAVI (Quietly, to Pi:) Don't be stupid! Say you're sorry. \nMother arrives at the gate with a WOMAN WORKER and rushes to Pi's side. \nMOTHER What have you done, Piscine? You know what your father said about coming back here. \nPI I'm sorry. I was... \nMother turns to Father, quietly - referring to the goat: \nMOTHER What are you thinking? \nFATHER This is between a father and his sons. (In Tamil:) Selvam, the gate. \nMOTHER He said he's sorry. You want to scar them for life? \nFATHER Scar them? That boy almost lost his arm! \nMOTHER But he's still a boy! \nFATHER He will be a man sooner than you think, and this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget. (Turning to Selvam:) Selvam. \nSelvam opens the far gate. Richard Parker re-enters the hallway. He sees the goat and slinks forward, lowering his body, his ears flattening against his skull. The goat freezes. Everyone watches in silence, transfixed by the intensity of the tiger. Pi watches the animal spirit glowing up within Richard Parker's eyes as instinct takes over. \nIn a sudden, single burst, Richard Parker bolts the length of the hallway, claws reaching out through the bars of the cage toward the goat. \nWe don't see what happens next - but the family does. \nON THE CAGE: Only a few seconds have passed, but Richard Parker has already turned to go back into his enclosure, the lifeless goat in his mouth. The family watches - Father is impassive, Ravi traumatized; mother wraps her arms around Pi. \n52   INT. PI AND RAVI'S BEDROOM, 1976 - MORNING                52 \nA rainy early morning in monsoon season. Pi (now 16) lies in bed, reading \"Notes from the Underground.\" Ravi is still asleep. The radio plays in the other room. \nNEWS ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO) ... and so has placed the country in a State of Emergency. (MORE) \nANANDI No - that also means the lotus flower. \nPI The lotus flower is hiding in the forest? Why would a lotus flower hide in the forest? \nAnandi blushes. She has no answer. \n62   EXT. THE ZOO EXHIBITS, 1977 - DAY                            62 \nPi and Anandi stand at the Bengal Tiger cage, Pi proudly introducing Anandi to the zoo's finest exhibit. \nPI And this is Richard Parker. He's the most magnificent creature we've ever had here. (Beat.) Look at the way he's turning his head. Showing off - like a dancer. \nANANDI No, he heard something - he's listening. You see? \nPi beams. \n64   INT. PATEL DINING ROOM, 1977 - DUSK                          64 \nPi sits at dinner with the family, a half-smile on his face, obviously lost in thoughts about Anandi. Father's voice gradually breaks through into Pi's consciousness. \nFATHER So...you see? We have talked about it for some time... Do you understand what I'm saying? Pi? \nPi glances over. \nPI Sorry. You've been... \nFATHER Worried. For my family. Our animals are worth far more abroad than here in India, and if the town council stops supporting us, I don't know where we'll be. So... it is what we have to do. Do you understand? \nPI I'm sorry... what are we talking about? \nRAVI We are leaving India. \nPI What?? \nMOTHER We are selling the zoo. \nFATHER The zoo itself was never ours to sell - the land belongs to the town. But the animals are ours, and if we sell them, we will have enough to start a new life. \nPI But where would we go? Our life is here Appa! \nFATHER Canada. I have some opportunities for work in Winnipeg. I'll be shipping most of the animals for sale in North America; we can get freighter passage for the whole family. So, it is settled. We will sail like Columbus! \nPI But Columbus was looking for India! \nThe cook shoves a plate of plain rice over the counter. \nFRENCH COOK Here's your rice. I cook for sailors, not curry eaters. \nFather grabs the cook's forearms, yanking him halfway over the high counter. \nFATHER What did you call us?? \nFRENCH COOK Let go of me! \nFATHER Who do you think you are? You're nothing but a servant! \nFRENCH COOK I feed people! You feed monkeys! \nFATHER I'll teach you respect! \nSailors descend on the two, pulling them apart. \nA SHORT TIME LATER - \n69   INT. THE TSIMTSUM MESS HALL, 1977 - DAY                        69 \nThe family sits eating silently in the aftermath of the scuffle. A TAIWANESE SAILOR comes alongside Pi carrying a plate of rice with gravy. He speaks with a Taiwanese accent and a gentle smile. \nTAIWANESE SAILOR Hello, I am happy Buddhist, so I eat rice next to gravy. On ship, gravy is not meat. Is taste. Okay? You try? \nPi smiles in gratitude, but the gravy looks anything but appetizing. \n70   INT. TSIMTSUM CARGO HOLD, 1977 - DAY                           70 \nPi eats a banana from the food set aside for the animals in the cargo hold. He sits next to the transport cage of ORANGE JUICE, a female orangutan with a baby orang in her arms. Animal crates and cages surround Pi, the air filled with screeches and growls. \nFather enters the hold, carrying food for the animals. \nFATHER (Noting Pi's banana:) Don't worry - we will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Manila. \nFather mixes tranquilizer pills into food for the orangs. \nPI Why give O.J. a tranquilizer? She's not going to cause any trouble. \nFATHER The stress of traveling is not good for the animals. (MORE) \nFATHER (CONT'D) And it helps with the seasickness. We don't want to be cleaning up after a seasick orangutan, do we? \nPi sees the Tsimtsum at an angle, it's bow dipping below the water. As he tries to get up, Pi notices the orange emergency whistle that dangles from the vest. He grabs it and blows, shouting between blasts. \nPI HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY, HELP ME! \nThe deck lights of the freighter glow with a cheery, unnatural brilliance. By the light of the ship, Pi can just make out a distant figure in the water. \nPI (CONT'D) HEY! OVER HERE! \nPi spies a lifebuoy tied to a rope. He grabs it and heaves it as far as he can across the water. OUT IN THE WATER, the lifebuoy splashes a few yards away from the shadowy figure. \nThe moment Pi feels the tug on the line, he jumps into the uncovered part of the boat, lies back and begins hauling the rope in. Nearly finished, he lifts his head to peer over the side and sees who he's rescued. \nPI (CONT'D) Richard Parker? \nA beat - and then Pi realizes what he's done. He scrambles backward in horror, trying to throw the rope overboard. \nPI (CONT'D) NO! GO AWAY! \nRichard Parker paddles toward the boat. Pi grabs an oar, wielding it against the approaching tiger. Richard Parker tries to grab the oar. Pi yanks the oar away, falling onto his back. \nHe listens as Richard Parker claws his way up the side of the swaying boat, coughing and gagging water. Pi scrambles backward, oar still in hand. He rises and jumps overboard. \n79   EXT. THE OCEAN - CONTINUOUS                                  79 \nPi plunges into the roiling water. An enormous wave rolls toward Pi - filling his lungs with air, Pi dives under, away from the assault of the raging storm. \n80   EXT. BENEATH THE WATER - CONTINUOUS                          80 \nSilence as Pi hangs below the surface, arms wide, groping for focus and calm. \nLightning casts a blazing white veil over the surface of the water above him, backlighting fish and animals, waves frozen in time like wrinkled bedsheets, their motionless texture pocked and dimpled with raindrops. As the sky explodes in white flashes, the scene is caught in surreal still shots. \nA hippo swims past, it's heavy form moving gracefully. \nPi swims toward the camera - then freezes, reacting in horror as... \nA shark swoops past him and up toward the struggling animals near the surface. Pi dives defensively - the camera follows. Ahead, the Tsimtsum is visible, fifty feet beyond Pi, its deck lights dipping below the surface, casting an eerie underwater glow, bubbles flowing up to the surface; nearby, Pi can make out the floating oar. \n81   EXT. THE OCEAN/THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS                       81 \nPi bursts above water in total panic, throwing his arms around the oar, coughing up sea water and bile. The lifebuoy floats a dozen feet off; he swims toward it. He grabs the oar moments before a huge wave sweeps him up and over the lifeboat. He lands on the other side, the oar lost, and drags himself onto the stern. He jumps over the kicking zebra and scrambles onto the boat tarp. \nAn oar sticks out from under the boat cover, hanging out over the front of the lifeboat. Pi climbs out on the oar, keeping himself a safe distance from the tiger he assumes is beneath the tarp. The air vibrates with a tremendous belching groan; Pi looks over to the cargo ship, watching, astounded... \nO.J. turns to look at Pi, a look of inconsolable sadness in her eyes - as though she knows better what lies ahead. \n84   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     84 \nHigh noon. Intolerable heat. Flies circle the zebra, landing on Pi's face and arms. He's too exhausted to brush them away. The only sound is the incessant lapping of water against the hull. Pi stares out across the ocean - no rescue in sight. He pushes himself upright, calling over the waves. \nPI HELLO...! HELLO...! ANYBODY? \nPi kneels and bangs his bailing bucket against the hull. The hyena emergees, shaking its head violently in an attempt to clear its thoughts. It screams in frustration and begins yipping. Pi picks up the oar and pokes the hyena to fend it off. He watches with increasing alarm as the hyena paces in frantic circles - whatever tranquilizers this animal received are wearing off. The boy wraps his grip around the paddle, prepared to defend himself. \nThe hyena abruptly stops pacing, coughing and retching - then lies down, shaking from emotional and physical distress. It sets its head on the edge of the tarp, predator eyes fastened on Pi. \n85   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DUSK                                    85 \nA boy, a hyena, a zebra and an orangutan silhouetted against the last fading light of day. \nPi has hung the paddle and lifebuoy off the end of the boat and perches on the bow. The hyena's eyes seem to glow in the last light, fixed on Pi. Pi stares back. \nPi fights fatigue as waves splash interminably against the hull. He winces at each creak of the lifeboat; his eyes glaze over as he stares out at the endless, dusky seascape. Pi sees movement in the shadows. The hyena attacks the zebra; the zebra barks and squeals. O.J. reacts to the violence, crying out. \nPI No! Stop it! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! \n86   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAWN                                     86 \nSilence. Morning. Hazy. Pi slumps over the oar, eyes half open, glazed. He has stayed up a second night for fear of being attacked, and now he slowly nods sideways, giving in to exhaustion despite himself, and tumbles into the water. \nPi gasps in shock as the water slaps him into full consciousness. He climbs back onto the life ring - coughing, tired, wet, sad and fearful. \nThe lifeboat rolls and growls beneath Pi's feet as he stares - and then he notices O.J. The poor orang is sitting on a side bench half-hidden by the tarp, and horribly seasick. Her tongue lolls out of her mouth and she's visibly panting. \nPI I'm sorry, O.J.; I don't have any seasickness medicine for you - \nAnd then it strikes him. \nPI (CONT'D) Supplies! Ah, supplies! \nPi pulls up the edge of the tarp nearest the bow. A row of benches with hinged lids curve around the bow. Pi opens the rearmost bench and finds a \"LIFEBOAT MANUAL AND NAVIGATIONAL GUIDE\" in a plastic bag along with a pencil lying on top of bags of supplies. He pulls out the manual and flips through it - an illustration shows that the boat is lined with compartments. He opens the next bench - it's stuffed with life jackets. \nHe tosses one of the life jackets to O.J., who has no idea what to make of it. O.J. turns to watch him, utterly bewildered. \n88   EXT. THE OCEAN, BEHIND THE LIFEBOAT/THE LIFEBOAT - DAY       88 \nAn hour later. Pi finishes tying a knot in a piece of rope that joins oars to the lifebuoy. Pull back to reveal that Pi has built a makeshift raft, tying three oars into a triangle around the lifebuoy and using the banana net to gather the life vests into a bunch beneath. \n108    EXT. THE RAFT/THE LIFEBOAT - A SHORT TIME LATER             108 \nPi reels himself over to the lifeboat. He moves around to the side of the boat, grabs the dorado by the tail and throws the entire fish over the side and into the stern. It lands with a thud, and from somewhere inside the boat, Richard Parker lets out a grunt of surprise. \nAfter a moment, Pi hears the wet mashing noises of the tiger devouring the fish. As Pi pushes away from the lifeboat, he puts the whistle in his mouth, blowing a few sharp blasts to remind Richard Parker who's in charge. \n112A   EXT. THE RAFT - NIGHT                                   112A \nA full moon. All around the raft, the green surface of the water glows with millions of flecks of glowing plankton - and beneath the surface, fish swim past at multiple depths and in multiple directions. Pi brushes his fingers over the surface of the water. The surface ripples where he touched it, the plankton glowing more brightly, the effect moving outward and downward through the water, an ever-expanding ring. \nPi hears a faint, rapid succession of blows. He peers into the encroaching darkness but can see nothing. Richard Parker is nowhere to be seen. The blows stop and Pi returns his attention to the light show below. \nPi senses movement deep within the water, a cone of rushing energy pressing up toward the luminescent surface. \nSuddenly, the glowing silhouette of a huge creature wrapped in phosphorescent plankton - a HUMPBACK WHALE - streaks to the surface nearby, its mouth gaping. Fifty feet in length, it thrusts itself up into the air. Pi barely has time to react, gripping the raft and holding on for his life as the whale comes crashing back down into the water. \nThe animal slips back into the ocean, creating a wave that sends the raft swirling across the water's surface, submerging for a moment, then bouncing off the side of the lifeboat. \nPi's neatly-stacked water cans and biscuits tumble over the side of the raft and into the ocean. \nThe whale disappears into the night, leaving Pi open-mouthed and shaken. \nPI (V.O.) Of course, I brought all the biscuits and water on the raft with me to keep them safe. Idiot. \n116   EXT. THE RAFT/LIFEBOAT - LATE AFTERNOON                  116 \nA calm day; gentle waves. Afternoon, the sun beating down. Pi wears his shirt wrapped around his head to hold off the heat. \nPI (V.O. - CONT'D) Hunger can change everything you ever thought you knew about yourself. \nPi uses his knife to cut another scratch into the hull. There are 38 scratches on the side of the lifeboat. He glances down, staring longingly at the fish that swim just beneath the raft, then looks across the lifeboat, where the gaff lies hooked in the tarp close to the tiger's end of the boat. Richard Parker is nowhere to be seen. \nPi reaches out with the boat hook to try to snag the gaff, but it is hooked deeply into the tarp. He lays the boat hook on the tarp and climbs aboard, crawling forward to free the gaff. As he wiggles the hook free, Richard Parker's head pops out from beneath the tarp only a few feet away. \nPi's winces, prepared for an attack. In an instant, he's struck hard across the face - a stunning blow that sends him backward onto the tarp. \nPause. Pi opens one eye. Richard Parker hasn't moved. Pi looks down - a slender grey-blue fish with wings is flopping about on the tarp. Pi has been hit by a flying fish. \nRichard Parker has seen the flying fish as well. He rises to his haunches. Pi grabs the flying fish and tosses it to Richard Parker. \nPI (CONT'D) Here, it's yours. \nThe tiger stands, jaws opening in anticipation... \nThe tiger backs off as Pi approaches - curious and annoyed. Pi uses the stick to probe into the tiger's territory, testing his limits; Richard Parker gets angry, batting at the stick. Pi looks away, tries again, then turns to face Richard Parker, who growls, angry and begins batting at the stick. \nPI NO! \nPi gives the tiger a stern glare. RP stops, stares back, then backs off. \nPI (CONT'D) Good. \nPi reaches into a pouch behind his back, taking out a piece of fish. He places it on the end of the stick and reaches out, offering it to Richard Parker, who sniffs the air. \nPi puts the fish on the bench. Richard Parker eats the fish, then backs up, growing calmer. \nPi takes out another fish, reaches out to tap the bench, then tosses the fish on the bench. Richard Parker takes the fish, eats. \nPi tosses the next piece near the edge of the tarp and taps, encouraging Richard Parker to follow his direction. \nPI (CONT'D) Go Richard Parker. Go. Go on home; I'll leave you alone. I'll respect that. I promise. Go, c'mon. \nRichard Parker stares at Pi. Pi raises his arms and yells, chasing Richard Parker around the bench and under the tarp. \nPI (CONT'D) Yes! \nPi sits, the battle over. \n137   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT/THE RAFT - DAY                            137 \nThe sun is high. Pi raises the adjustable canopy he has rigged on his raft and sits beneath it. He feels the wind on his face and watches Richard Parker lounge in the stern of the lifeboat. Pi smiles, for a moment genuinely happy. \nHe uses his knife to carefully sharpen his pencil, then begins writing in the margins of his survival manual, which are covered with journal entries... \n`LIFE IS GOOD' MONTAGE - Pi's raft has transformed again. Fish strips dry on lines; he has fashioned new tools, rigged an elaborate water collection system out of turtle shells, and a collapsible shade umbrella. \n- Pi trims his fingernails, a fish bone toothpick in his mouth. \nPI (WRITING - V.O.) I never thought a small piece of shade could bring me so much happiness. That a pile of tools - a bucket, a knife, a pencil- might become my greatest treasures. Or that knowing Richard Parker was here might ever bring me peace. In times like these, I remember that he has as little experience of the real world as I do. We were both raised in a zoo by the same master. Now we've been orphaned, left to face our ultimate master together. Without Richard Parker, I would have died by now. My fear of him keeps me alert. Tending to his needs gives my life purpose. \n138   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                             138 \nA school of dolphins, hundreds of them, pass in the distance, the blue sea roiling. \nPI Dolphins, Richard Parker! \nJust beyond the school of dolphin, something else catches Pi's attention on the horizon - a freighter, much like the Tsimtsum, is within a few miles of their position. \nPI (WRITING - V.O.) (CONT'D) Words are all I have left to hang onto... \n147   EXT. LIFEBOAT - DAY                                      147 \nPi's fingers tremble as he writes in his manual, the tiny cramped letters barely legible, every white surface of the page covered. \nPI (WRITING - V.O.) Everything mixed up, fragmented. Can't tell daydreams, night dreams from reality anym -- \nThe lead in his tiny stub of a pencil runs out, worn to a nub of wood. Pi slowly puts down his pencil, brooding. \n148   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                  148 \nPi lies on the tarp, his position nearly unchanged, beating a drum rhythm on the hull, a wreck of conflicted thoughts and frayed nerves. \nWe hear a distant rumble of thunder. Pi raises his head. Dark thunderclouds rise up over the horizon blackening the heavens. Another rumble of thunder, this one closer. \nPI Storm! Storm, Richard Parker! \n149   EXT. LIFEBOAT - DAY                                      149 \nPi takes down the canopy on the raft. Pi begins quickly stowing his gear in the storage bench, beneath the tarp. Richard Parker flees to the safety of his den under the tarp. As Pi stows gear, he remembers his manual and takes it out from his waistband. \nThe storm front sweeps across the ocean in a squall line, high winds and rain striking Pi and the lifeboat with tremendous force. The manual slips from his hands and Pi is knocked off his feet and into the water. He lifts his head out of the water in time to watch the manual flying off into the storm. \nPI No! \nThe manual is gone. Pi ties himself to the lifeboat with a rope from the raft. \n150   EXT. LIFEBOAT - DAY                                         150 \na stunning display of clouds and lightning fills the sky, as Pi looks on in awe. The sky lights up, a vivid white splinter of lightning crashing down from the sky, puncturing the water near the lifeboat. The water is shot through with what looks like the white roots of an enormous celestial tree; the clap of thunder is tremendous. \nPI Praise be to God, Lord of All Worlds, the Compassionate, the Merciful! \nA wave washes Pi off of the tarp and onto the floor of the boat. Pi climbs onto the bench. He looks up in wonder at the sky, overwhelmed by the magnificence of the roiling clouds. \nPI (CONT'D) It's beautiful... Where are you, Richard Parker? You have to see this! \nAnother angle: he begins unbuttoning the tarp, calling excitedly to Richard Parker. \nPI (CONT'D) Come out Richard Parker! Come see the hand of God! \nPi continues to unfasten the tarp. \nPi lies, unconscious, in the bow of the lifeboat. Waves lap at the sides of the boat, which presses against the shore of an island. \nA gust of wind blows across Pi's face, tousling his hair. Pi gradually opens his eyes. A beat. He tips his head back. \nPi's POV - above and behind him, the tops of trees. \nPi turns, looking at the island, amazed. The trees have a pale bark with an amazing profusion of leaves, their color burning with a neon-like intensity. There is no sand; instead the ground is an intricate, tightly webbed mass of tube- shaped seaweed, about two fingers in diameter. \nPi turns to look back to the stern; he calls under the tarp. \nPI Richard Parker? \nPi rises, stepping out of the boat. The seaweed is rubbery - uncertain ground. His legs are wobbly. He hooks the gaff on a root and falls to the ground. Pi tears up a piece of the seaweed and examines it. He takes an experimental bite. Soon he's grabbing handfuls of the seaweed, eating as fast as he can. \nPi climbs the ridge on unsteady legs. A forest comes into view with nearly symmetrical ponds dotting the island here and there, many of them reaching 40 feet in diameter. \nHalf the island seems to be covered with meerkats - thousands of them standing together in groups all over the island. The moment the first of the meerkats notices Pi, it turns and stands on its hind legs - and the others immediately follow suit. \nEXT. THE ISLAND - DAY \nPi walks slowly forward, taking in the meerkats and the island. Gradually, the meerkats return to all fours - their squeaking and barking noises coming and going in waves throughout the herd. They pay him so little attention that Pi has to shove them aside with his legs in order to walk. \nPI Excuse me... Go on, move! \nPi walks beyond the throng of meerkats toward a pond, pausing to examine the fish bones that litter the edge of one of the ponds. The edge is steep; he gets too close, slips down the side and into the water. Pi tastes the water. He begins a gentle, blissful breaststroke across the pond. \nPi hears a commotion. He lifts himself up to peer over at the meerkats. In the distance, Richard Parker blazes a trail through the meerkats, catching, pinning and eating as many as he can. Pi smiles, watching the tiger. \nLATER: \n164   EXT. THE TREE - SUNSET                                   164 \nPi sits cradled in a nest of branches, rigging a hammock. As the last rays of the sun disappear, he hears a commotion below on the island and pushes aside branches to see better. The meerkats are abandoning the ponds, scurrying up onto land and running for the forest, their collective stampede noisier than a herd of elephants. Richard Parker, in the meantime, runs for the shoreline, scrambling down the ridge as fast as possible and leaping into the lifeboat. \nThe trunk beneath Pi is swarmed as meerkats settle upon all the branches in the tree. Several invade Pi's hammock, sitting on him, climbing over him, making themselves comfortable at his expense. \nPI Hey! Hey! Hey c'mon. Hey! Hey-get away. This is my bed! \nPi shoves them off as best he can and settles in for the night. \n165   EXT. UP IN THE TREE - NIGHT                                 165 \nPi sleeps, nestled in the branches of the tree. \nHe blows his whistle, calling: \nPI RICHARD PARKER! \n172   EXT. THE ISLAND/LIFEBOAT - SUNSET                        172 \nRichard Parker runs down the ridge and jumps into the stern. Pi climbs aboard and shoves off. \nCUT TO: \n173   EXT. OCEAN NEAR ISLAND - LIFEBOAT - SUNSET               173 \nPi and the tiger watch as the island recedes into the distance, lit by the late afternoon sun. \nPI (V.O) No one has ever seen that floating island since; you won't read about those trees in any nature book. And yet if I hadn't found those shores, I would have died. And if I hadn't discovered that tooth, I would have been lost, alone forever. (MORE) \nPI (V.O) (CONT'D) Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, He was watching. Even when He seemed indifferent to my suffering, He was watching. And when I was beyond all hope of saving, He gave me rest, then gave me a sign to continue my journey. \n177   EXT. THE MEXICAN COAST/THE JUNGLE - DAY                     177 \nPi leans over the side of the lifeboat. He falls overboard. We follow him underwater, his feet - hit a sandy bottom. \nADULT PI (V.O.) By the time we reached the Mexican shore, I was afraid to let go of the boat. My strength was gone. I was so weak. I was afraid that in two feet of water, so close to deliverance, I would drown. I struggled to shore and fell upon the sand. It was warm and soft, like pressing my face against the cheek of God. And somewhere two eyes were smiling at having me there. \nAn empty coastline, nothing but sand, rocks and jungle. Pi struggles to bring the lifeboat ashore. Richard Parker is hiding under the tarp, nowhere to be seen. Pi pulls the painter line until the boat is on the beach, then collapses on the sand. \n177   EXT. THE MEXICAN COAST/THE JUNGLE - DAY                     177 \nPi collapses on the beach. He hears Richard Parker coming a moment before he sees him; Pi turns, looking up as the tiger jumps over the boy, stretching in the air above him and landing in the water ahead of him. \nADULT PI (V.O.) I was so spent I couldn't move. And so Richard Parker went ahead of me. \nRichard Parker walks along the beach, his gait clumsy and uncoordinated from so much time spent at sea. \nADULT PI (V.O.) He stretched his legs and walked along the shore. \nRichard Parker stops, staring ahead into the forest, his back to the boy. Pi watches the tiger from behind, Richard Parker's ribs gently rising and falling as he smells the jungle air. \nADULT PI (V.O.) At the edge of the jungle, he stopped. I was certain he was going to look back at me, flatten his ears to his head, growl - that he'd bring our relationship to an end in some way. But he just stared ahead into the jungle. \n178   INT. PI'S HOME, DINING ROOM, MONTREAL - SUNSET           178 \nOn Adult Pi alone: \nYOUNG PI Yes. Just like I told you. \nCHIBA Bananas don't float. \nOKAMOTO (In Japanese:) Why are you talking about bananas? \nCHIBA You said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas. But bananas don't float. \nOKAMOTO (In Japanese:) Are you sure about that? \nYOUNG PI Of course they do. Try it for yourself. \nOKAMOTO In any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats. \nYOUNG PI I've just told you a long story. I'm very tired. \nOKAMOTO We're here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific. \nYOUNG PI Something I never forget. I lost my whole family. \nPause. \nOKAMOTO (In Japanese:) Get him some water. (In English:) We don't mean to push you. And you have our deepest sympathies. But we've come a long way. And we're no closer to understanding why the ship sank. \nYOUNG PI Because I don't know. I was asleep. Something woke me up. It may have been an explosion; I can't be sure. And then the ship sank. What else do you want from me? \nCHIBA (OFF) A story that won't make us look like fools. \nOKAMOTO We need a simpler story for our report. One our company can understand. A story we can all believe. (Chiba gives Pi a glass of water.) \nYOUNG PI So.... a story without things you never seen before. \nOKAMOTO That's right. \nYOUNG PI Without surprises. Without animals or islands. \nOKAMOTO Yes. The truth. \nB175   INT. PI'S HOME, MONTREAL - DAY                      B175 \nWRITER So what did you do? \nADULT PI I told him another story. Four of us survived... \n", "test1_input": "RAVI ... I'm sleeping. \nPI It's a thunderstorm! Let's go watch! \nRAVI Are you crazy? We'll get hit by lightning. \nPI No, we won't. It'll hit the bridge first. \nRAVI Don't tempt a storm, Pi. \nOn the other side of the narrow room, Mother shifts uncomfortably on the double bed she shares with Father. \n75   INT. SHIP HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                               75 \nPi heads upstairs to the deck. \n76   EXT. THE CARGO DECK - CONTINUOUS                             76 \nThe deck of the ship is dark. Pi steps out into a bracing rain and walks to the rail, wind whipping his hair. He laughs, exhilarated, as rain splashes over his face. Throwing arms wide, Pi dances in imitation of Anandi's dance, slipping more than once on the rain-soaked deck, shouting in giddy adolescent triumph. \nPI More rain, lord of storms! Let it rage! \nHe finishes, laughing as he falls against the railing. The deck lights suddenly all come on at once; a warning alarm sounds over the loudspeakers. \nPi slips to the front of the deck and stands up, watching in horror as a wave washes over the bow, carrying several sailors overboard. He pushes himself away from the railing and runs back down below. \nINT. THE STAIRS TO THE CABINS/LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS \nPi stumbles down the tilted staircase. \nPI AMMA! APPA! RAVI! GET OUT, GET OUT! \nHalfway down, Pi hits water. He dives, searching for his family. The hall lights flicker - the passage falls dark an instant before the emergency lights come on in the water below, which nearly reaches the ceiling. Pi dives, trying to swim against the flowing current; he's astonished to find a ZEBRA swimming toward him, passing overhead. He tries to swim further, but the enormous force of rushing water and air is too great; he scrambles backward, groping toward the stairwell. \nEXT. THE CARGO DECK - CONTINUOUS \nPi bursts on deck, coughing and gagging for air. \nPI HELP!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!! \nPi sees movement - animals running. He scrambles toward them, the ship groaning as it lists sideways. \nOxen and deer are visible on the far side of the deck, backlit by emergency lights; Pi hears monkeys screeching, the clatter of hoofs pounding. In the distance, Sailors shout orders in panicked voices. \n", "test1_true": "PI (CONT'D) Please save my family! \nJAPANESE CAPTAIN Don't scare. Okay? Wait stay here. \nHe grabs a life vest and starts to put it on Pi. \nJAPANESE CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Here, put this on! \nPI You have to help them, please! Oh no my family, please. You have to help them, my family is back there. \nJAPANESE CAPTAIN We don't have time. \nThe Taiwanese Sailor jumps onto the ship. \nTAIWANESE SAILOR We help. You must go. \nPI Who let all the animals out? \nThey shove a life vest over Pi's head. \nSAILOR #1 You have to go now. \nPI No wait! My father - he can't swim - \nJAPANESE CAPTAIN This is your last chance--just go! \nPI No please! \nThey guide Pi to the side, where a section of the ship's railing has been removed to give access to the lifeboat. They push Pi over the edge; Pi falls onto the lifeboat, bouncing on the protective tarp that is still stretched taut across the bow. He grabs at the rope holding the bow, trying not to slip off. The sailors are shouting at the French cook, who stands at the stern. \nSAILOR #1 Hey! You! What are you doing?! \nFRENCH COOK Loosen the lines! Bring it down! \nSAILOR #1 Tie it down! Tie it down! \nFRENCH COOK (to the sailors:) Jump! Jump! \nThe sailors look towards the upper deck. Pi follows their looks and watches in horror as a zebra launches itself over the side of the ship, careening through the air toward the safety of the lifeboat. The French cook staggers backward and jumps out of the way, falling to the water below. Pi throws up his arms as the life boat starts to drop. The zebra arcs through the air, missing the tarp, landing on the exposed stern with a sickening thud, shattering the rear bench. The force sends the rig lines spinning. \nThe lifeboat plummets to the water below. The impact spins it around, nearly washing Pi overboard. He is left clinging to the back of the tarp, the zebra on the floor of the lifeboat before him. As the lifeboat drops down the side of the swell, Pi slides to the front of the tarp. The Tsimtsum's propeller rises behind him. \nAs Pi steadies himself, a swell lifts the lifeboat, crashing it onto the deck of the Tsimtsum. It drops back into the sea, rolling over completely. The vessel instantly rights itself - the lifeboat is designed to be virtually unsinkable. Pi lands on the lifeboat's floorboards, next to the zebra. \n", "test2_input": "A rat skitters out from under the tarp, grabbing biscuit crumbs, then retreating. \nA low growl. Richard Parker charges out from his den and bounds onto the tarp. Pi staggers in terror and falls helplessly into the storage bench, with only his head poking out above the tarp. \nThe tiger steps toward Pi, then hesitates - again, the softness of the tarp unnerves him. He steps back off the tarp and paces the stern. \nPi creeps out of the storage bench - then watches in horror as Richard Parker swivels and charges him again, this time beneath the tarp. The rat scurries back out of hiding and Richard Parker's head follows, looming up out from the gap between the tarp and the storage bench. Pi jumps onto the tarp, out of the tiger's reach. \nRichard Parker scrambles backward and reappears at the far end of the tarp, roaring, prepared to attack from above - then halts, watching in astonishment as the rat hops around the lifeboat, finally running up Pi's shirt and landing on Pi's head. \nPi grabs the rat by the tail and throws it. The rat sails, paws and tail stretched wide, across the boat. Richard Parker opens his mouth and the rat flies in, its tail disappearing between the tiger's lips like a spaghetti noodle. \nAs Richard Parker enjoys his treat, Pi climbs backward over the bow, unhooking the rope, grabbing the water cans and the biscuits and slipping over the side, falling into the water. \nHe drops onto the raft and pushes himself back with his feet. The raft floats back and hits the end of the ropeline with a jerk. Pi remembers the rope and goes back to untie it. \nSuddenly Richard Parker appears at the bow and lunges at him, almost falling off the front of the lifeboat onto Pi. The tiger scrambles back onto the boat and off the tarp, while Pi paddles the raft away. \nWhen he is finally at a safe distance, fear and stress overwhelm Pi - he throws up what little food and water he has taken. \n92   EXT. THE RAFT, BEHIND THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                  92 \nA full moon, backlit clouds rolling through the skies, reflected in the water below. Pi floats behind the lifeboat, weeping, surrounded by nothing but terror and the abyss. A thick range of clouds moves in, threatening to cut off the light from the moon and stars. \nPi watches Richard Parker on the lifeboat, a shadowy silhouette on the bow ahead. The tiger takes the zebra carcass under the tarp. The clouds blot out the sky. Darkness envelops them. \n93   EXT. ABOVE THE RAFT - EARLY MORNING                         93 \nAngle on Pi, the raft and boat from above, lost on an endless ocean, the bright colors of morning light dancing on the surface of the water. \nPi has taken out his pencil and now writes on the back page of his survival manual, his voice heard over: \nPI (WRITING V.O.) \"My name is Pi Patel. I have been in a shipwreck. I am on a lifeboat alone - with a tiger. Please send help.\" \nHe tears the page out and stuffs it into an empty water can, sealing the opening with a plastic lid. He tosses it as far as possible; the can splashes down, rippling the water, then bobs, going nowhere. Pi stares at the bobbing can, crushed as he sees the futility of this plan. \nA defeated pause, and then Pi looks up and sees the majesty of his surroundings. The cloud cover breaks; dawn light glows down on Pi. \nA grunt from the lifeboat. Pi turns, surprised. He grabs the tow line and reels into the lifeboat. \nHe lifts the tarp; Richard Parker's eyes glow out at him from the shadows, greeting Pi with a low snarl. Pi gingerly lowers the tarp and casts the raft back from the bow. He looks up. \nPI (CONT'D) (In awe, shuddering:) God... I give myself to you. I am your vessel. Whatever comes... I want to know. Show me. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. THE RAFT - DAY \nPi sits on his makeshift raft, flipping through his manual. The foldout map of the manual shows the ocean's currents, longitudes, latitudes, and depths. Pi stares at the chart, bewildered by it all. He rises up on his knees, looking out at the ocean around him, then sits back, hand to forehead. \nPI There are no lines! \n95 EXT. THE RAFT - DAY - MONTAGE 95 \nMontage - Pi struggling with discomfort on his raft. \nPI (READING - V.O.) \"Set your house in order and dig in for the battle to survive. Establish a strict schedule for eating, keeping watch and getting rest. Do not drink urine or sea water. \nKeep busy, but avoid unnecessary exertion. The mind can be kept occupied by playing card games, Twenty Questions, or I Spy. Community singing is another sure- fire way to lift the spirits. Telling stories is highly recommended. Above all, don't lose hope.\" \n- Pi scratches marks into the side of the boat to indicate the passage of time - it is his 11th day at sea. \nA96   EXT. THE RAFT - A SHORT TIME LATER                       A96 \nPi is still reading his survival manual. The waves pick up. The lifeboat rocks. Somewhere beneath the tarp, the tiger lets out a faint groan of discomfort. On Pi as he contemplates this... \nPI (READING V.O.:) \"Few things can sap the spirit faster than seasickness. Waves are more strongly felt when a boat turns sideways to the current. A sea anchor is used as a drag to keep the boat's head to the wind. (MORE) \nPI (READING V.O.:) (CONT'D) Proper use of them can increase control and reduce seasickness during rough seas... \nPi takes a sea anchor from inside his life ring and tosses it overboard. As soon as the sea anchor has been deployed, the raft slows down and the anchor lines go taut. \n97   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                           97 \nPi has rigged an additional line between the open end of the lifeboat and his raft. \nPI (READING V.O.) For castaways who must share their lifeboats with large dangerous carnivores it's advisable to establish a territory as your own. The following course of action is recommended. Step one: choose a day when waves are moderate but regular. Step two: with the lifeboat facing into the waves, making the ride as comfortable as possible, blow your whistle soothingly. Step three: turn the lifeboat sideways to the waves, accompanied by harsh aggressive use of the whistle. With sufficient repetition, the animal will associate the sound of the whistle with the discomfort of seasickness. Similar methods have long been used by circus trainers, though they generally lack access to rough seas. \nHe reels in this line, turning the boat sideways to the waves. The rocking increases. Pi blows the whistle several times harshly (\"warning\" signal) as the rocking increases. From within the boat, he hears the tiger groan. He grabs the original lifeline that connects the raft to the boat and hauls himself in. Pi grins, spits out the whistle. \nPI (CONT'D) (A ringmaster's call:) Let the trumpets blare, let the drum rolls begin! Prepare to be amazed! Here it is, for your enjoyment and instruction, the show you've been waiting for all your life will soon begin! (MORE) \nPI (CONT'D) Are you ready for the miracle of it? Well, then - I give to you... \nPi lets go of the second line, raising his hand with a flourish. \nPI (CONT'D) ... the ASTOUNDING BENGAL TIGER! \nHe pulls the raft next to the tarp end of the lifeboat. The tiger crawls out from under the tarp, violently ill. \n", "test3_input": "PI (CONT'D) (Rocking the boat:) Hello, Richard Parker. Sorry about the choppy ride. \nPi pulls himself onto the bow. Richard Parker tries to lift his head, then groans, giving it up. Pi lifts the whistle to his mouth and blows it repeatedly as he advances to the front edge of the tarp, opens his fly and pisses in a straight line across the midpoint of the boat. \nPI (CONT'D) (Pointing:) MINE! YOU UNDERSTAND? YOURS - MINE! (He blows his whistle) You understand? \nHe steps back to observe the effect of this provocation on the seasick tiger. Richard Parker staggers to the edge of the tarp. He takes a deep sniff and winces, groaning, his tongue hanging out in distaste. The tiger turns away from Pi, facing the stern. Pi thinks the battle is won - until the tiger lifts his tail and sprays him with a tremendous burst of urine. \nPI (READING V.O.) (CONT'D) Step four: disregard steps one through three. \nA97   EXT. THE RAFT - AFTERNOON                                 A97 \nPi pulls in the solar still. Pi bends down to suck fresh water from the straw that protrudes from a water still, delighted to discover that it works. He carefully pours some of the water into a can for himself, then pours the rest into a bucket. \nB97   EXT. THE RAFT/THE LIFEBOAT - A SHORT TIME LATER            B97 \nPi pulls himself up to the bow of the lifeboat, sets a bucket of water in the boat and blows his whistle. Richard Parker sticks his head out from under the tarp. \nPI Here, Richard Parker. I've got some water for you. \nPi blows the whistle once more, casting the raft adrift again. Richard Parker sniffs, then begins lapping greedily at the water. \n103   EXT. RAFT - INSERT                                         103 \nINSERT of Pi writing in manual - text on page reflects Pi's accompanying V.O. \nPI (VO) In the zoo, we fed our tigers an average of five kilos of meat a day. Richard Parker will be getting hungry soon. \n104   EXT. RAFT - CONTINUOUS                                     104 \nPi chews for a moment, then spits out a blob of biscuit and presses the food ball onto his hook, savoring the crumbs that remain in his mouth. He tosses the hook and biscuit onto the water - the hook sinks, leaving the crumble of biscuit floating uselessly on the surface. Pi watches helplessly as fish rise to the surface to nibble at the soggy crumbs. \nPI (V.O.) Tigers are powerful swimmers, and, if he gets hungry enough, I'm afraid the little bit of water between us won't be any protection. I need to find a way to feed him. God made tigers carnivores, so I must learn to catch fish. If I don't, I'm afraid his last meal will be a skinny vegetarian boy. \nPi thinks a moment. He takes off one of his shoes, using the knife to cut a sliver of leather off the side. He presses the hook through the leather and tosses it in the water. Pi pulls in his fishing line - the leather is gone. \nA SHORT TIME LATER - \n105   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                          105 \nPi has cut his shoe into a dozen bits of leather and tried fishing several times - Always with the same result. Richard Parker, watching, mops at his jaw to wipe away drool - he's clearly getting hungry. \nPI Patience! \n", "test3_true": "Pi still fishes with no success. Richard Parker stares in the water at the dorado. He leans over the side of the boat, pawing hungrily at the surface as fish streak past - but the fish elude him. Richard Parker leans out further, striking with both paws - and finally jumps in altogether. \nRichard Parker strikes and splashes as fish streak past. Pi grins at the tiger's predicament - but the moment Richard Parker realizes he can't climb back aboard, he begins swimming toward the raft. Pi snaps to, recognizing the danger he's in. He reels the raft over to the lifeboat, practically leaping onto the bow. \nAs he hauls the raft aboard, Richard Parker manages to catch the netting on the raft with one paw. Pi leans back against an oar with all his weight, trying to lever the raft aboard; the weight of the tiger tips the entire bow lower in the water. Pi is about to lose the struggle when the tiger's claw rips through the netting, and the lifeboat springs back up in the water; the momentum flips the raft up onto the boat. \nPi turns, watching as Richard Parker swims up behind him alongside the bow. He digs into the supply box and rises with a hatchet in his hand, crossing to stand over the tiger and blowing the whistle threateningly. \nStandoff. Pi pumps the axe a few times, but cannot bring himself to kill the tiger. Richard Parker stares up at Pi a long moment, then paddles to the stern, trying once again to pull himself aboard at the other end of the boat. \nPI What am I doing? \nPi kicks at the side of the boat in frustration, and is surprised to hear a metal clunk. He finds a rectangular aluminum air box used for bouyancy: Pi then pulls the tarp back fully for the first time and examines the contents below. \nAs he removes one of the floorboard panels, imagining new uses for the wooden slats, he hears Richard Parker scratching at the hull of the boat. \nPI (CONT'D) Wait - I'm thinking. \n107    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                                   107 \nPi has tied a bunch of the flotation boxes to his raft and loaded it with all the provisions from the lifeboat. He points a flashlight beam over the side at the exhausted Richard Parker, the tiger's face and whiskers just above the surface of the water, scratching at the side of the boat. \nPi backs to the other end of the boat, pushing his raft into the water with one hand as he rocks the boat to help Richard Parker climb in. The moment the tiger is aboard, Pi climbs onto the raft and pushes off, retreating to safety, blowing the whistle to remind Richard Parker who's in command. \nAs he floats away, Pi collapses, exhausted, on the raft. \nA107   EXT. THE RAFT - DAY                                        A107 \nPi goes through the supplies listed in his survival guide, matching supplies to the pile of booty he's just retrieved from the lifeboat. \nPI (WRITING - V.O.) 93 cans of water... \nB107   EXT. THE RAFT - DAY                                        B107 \nPi removes all of the lifejackets from under the life ring, stacking them onto his latest raft structure. The empty banana netting now drapes beneath the raft; Pi notices that dorado are attracted to the net and gets an idea. \nOne of the dorados gets very close to the net - Pi realizes his opportunity. He hauls in the netting and wrestles the dorado onto the raft, flailing against the creature's strength and throwing his full weight onto the creature to keep it from sliding back into the ocean, riding it like a bucking bronco. Pi grabs a hatchet from the raft and strikes the fish over and over again. As the fish begins to die, it flashes all kinds of colors in rapid succession - blue, green, red, gold and violet flicker and shimmer neon-like on its surface. Pi starts back, watching this colorful display in terrified wonder. Finally, the fish ebbs to grey, lifeless. \nPI I'm sorry.     I'm sorry. \nPi is devastated. He weeps, bringing his hands together, pressing them against his forehead, murmuring a prayer to himself and bowing over the dead fish in abject grief. \nPI (CONT'D) Thank you, Lord Vishnu. Thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives. Thank you... \n"}

ELECTRA They didn't give you a choice, did they? 
RATH No, they didn't. 
ELECTRA But you knew what they were training you for? 
RATH Of course.  I was going to be James Bond. 
ELECTRA Ahhhh... 
RATH They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel -- 
ELECTRA The exotic women. 
RATH Women?  No... not really. 
ELECTRA Why not? 
RATH Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women. 
ELECTRA Why? 
RATH Because you are a women. 
ELECTRA Why did you leave the Agency? 
RATH The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you. 
ELECTRA They tried to kill you? 
RATH Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared. 
ELECTRA Then you went freelance? 
RATH The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets. 
ELECTRA Tell me about the first time. 
RATH My first take? 
ELECTRA Yes. 
RATH Why? 
ELECTRA Because I want to know. 
RATH It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline. 
ELECTRA Are they usually like that? 
RATH No.  Just the first one. 
ELECTRA After that? 
RATH They become complicated... messy. 
ELECTRA Did it ever bother you? 
RATH Did it ever bother James Bond? 
ELECTRA That's fiction. 
RATH This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you! 
ELECTRA Does that mean it didn't bother you? 
Rath leans back and stares at her.  She waits. 
RATH You get a job swinging a hammer, the first day you get a blister, it tears open, it bleeds and it stays sore a long time.  You keep swinging the hammer, you get a good hard callous that covers that spot and it never bothers you again. 
Electra says nothing.  He leans forward and slides a rook into her back row. 
RATH Check. 
He leans back. 
RATH Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless... 
ELECTRA No.  Something honest. 
A beat.  Rath likes this woman. 
She moves her Queen. 
ELECTRA Mate. 
He smiles. 
ELECTRA I hope your plan is better than your game. 
INT. CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT 
The room is ugly.  Shag carpeting, wood paneling and polyester patterned curtains. 
We hear a COMPUTER KEYBOARD CLICKING away as we MOVE ACROSS a table.  The hotel phone is in a modem, which is held together with duct tape.  Between the modem and the computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of naked circuit boards. 
It is a very similar set up to Rath's, only it has been put together with a fraction of the resources. 
Bain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off.  Beside the desk-top is a six pack of Old Style beer, a bag of Doritos and his Gameboy. 
On the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel is his cleaned gun.

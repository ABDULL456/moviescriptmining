Finally, finding the right row, they turn in. 
DEKKER You'd have to have some major firepower, not to mention an extra large set of balls to try and knock off a police station. 
CONNERS Not if you were a cop.    You could just walk right in and... 
AN EMPTY SPACE, marked in tape, "ITEM #4958378." 
CONNERS ...   Take whatever you want.   Shit. 
85A   AT THE FRONT DESK--                                       85A 
Dekker and Conners surround Harry as he digs through his file box. After a few moments, grabs a clipboard. 
HARRY Here is it. Line seventeen. 
DEKKER Bernie Callo. 
HARRY Like I said... No one takes anything out of here, unless they sign for it. 
CONNERS So what...     He showed you a warrant? What? 
HARRY He must've. 
CONNERS You don't remember? 
HARRY You know how many times someone signs shit in and out? I see the same guys all the time. I can't remember one instance two weeks ago. But if his signature's there, that means he signed for it. Take it up with him!

86   INT.   CAPTAIN JENKINS'S OFFICE - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT      86 
Jenkins listens as Conners and crew brief the situation. 
CONNERS The money from Richards's place traced back to the Pacific Savings heist a few months ago, a case Callo headed up. 
TEDDY Callo signed the money out of evidence two weeks ago. 
JENKINS How much? 
TEDDY 
VINCENT If it's Callo, it would explain how they knew police protocol and how our department operates. 
TEDDY Also explains why he was so pissed this morning about being replaced by Conners. He wanted to be the point so everything went according to plan. 
CONNERS He doesn't need another reason to be pissed at me. 
JENKINS What about motive?    Do we have one? 
VINCENT Pressure might've been getting to him. He's been getting the cold shoulder from cops since he testified about Pearl Street Bridge. 
JENKINS No.   Don't buy that. 
TEDDY (beat) He was also getting divorced. 
This is news to everyone. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004           53. 
TEDDY About a month ago, he told me he and his wife might be splitting. Asked if I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him out. I didn't think it was this bad. 
JENKINS (conflicted) Bernie Callo is a first rate cop.     A boy scout. This doesn't make any sense. 
CONNERS They never do, Captain. 
JENKINS Don't act like you're not enjoying this, Conners. I know what you think of him. 
CONNERS Doesn't matter what I think.      Facts here speak for themselves. 
DEKKER No they don't. We haven't asked the question... Why, if Callo's involved, don't they ask for him at the bank? (points to Conners) They asked for you. 
All eyes find Conners.   Then, Jenkins' PHONE RINGS... 
JENKINS (answering the phone) Jenkins. 
TIME CUT TO: 
87   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - 4:18 PM - DAY                       87 
The small home in a RURAL AREA is now COMPLETELY SURROUNDED by COP CARS. 
88   INT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME                                       88 
A typical family-themed home. FAMILY PICTURES adorn the walls. Everything in its right place. Except for... MRS. CALLO, 40's, sits in the kitchen SOBBING. Police encircle her. 
In the center of the Living Room... BERNIE CALLO LIES DEAD, a bullet wound right between the eyes.

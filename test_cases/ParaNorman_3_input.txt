AGGIE Aggie. My name was Aggie. ParaNorman 89. 
141 CONTINUED: 141 A brightly-colored butterfly flutters between them. Aggie starts to remember as she follows its flight. 
AGGIE (CONT'D) I... I remember my mommy brought me here once. We sat under the tree and she told me stories. They all had happy endings. 
(BROW FURROWS) And then those horrible men came and took me away and I never saw her again! She scowls angrily at the butterfly flitting past her face. It instantly crumples up into ashes. Surprised, she GASPS and watches the blackened dust fall to the ground. There's anger in Aggie, but there is confusion, sadness and regret there too. She isn't quite so scary anymore. 
NORMAN Sometimes when people get scared they say and do terrible things. I think you got so scared, that you forgot who you are. But I don't think you're a witch. Not really. Aggie looks into his eyes. 
AGGIE You don't? 
NORMAN I think you're just a little kid with a really special gift who only ever wanted people to understand her. He smiles softly. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) So we're not all that different at all. 
AGGIE But what about the people who hurt you? Don't you ever want to make them suffer? Norman thinks this over, and shrugs. 
NORMAN Well, yeah, but what good would that do? You think just because there's bad people out there that there's no good ones either? I thought the same thing.

141 CONTINUED: (2) 141 
NORMAN (CONT'D) For a while. But there's always someone out there for you. Somewhere. Aggie frowns, looking lost. 
AGGIE I just want my mommy... 
NORMAN I'm sorry, Aggie. She's gone. 
AGGIE That story you were telling. How does it end? 
NORMAN I think that's up to you. Aggie blinks through tears at the grass beneath her feet. 
AGGIE Is this where they buried me? 
NORMAN It's a pretty good place to sleep. Then you can be with your mom again. Aggie holds Norman's gaze, then looks down to the ground, her tiny frame heaving with a last SOB. She sits down on the grass and curls up, resting her head on her hands. Norman kneels down next to her as she closes her eyes. Her breathing grows deeper and more peaceful; her tiny frame shifting softly under her long hair. The air around them grows blurry and indistinct. Aggie softens as though out of focus, and the whole world becomes a swirling dance of glowing orbs. Norman closes his eyes as a blizzard of light engulfs him, spiraling up into the clouds high above his head. Lightning flashes white far above and thunder RUMBLES softly through the sky, as if moving away. 
EXT. TOWN HALL - CONTINUOUS 
The zombies form a group in the center of the square, all of them looking up into the clouds. The people around them stop and stare, awestruck as a breeze buffets their clothes and the air around them begins to shimmer. As the modern townsfolk watch on, some of the zombies take each others' arms for support. Those with eyelids close them. One by one their bodies dissolve away, leaving ethereal figures in their place. ParaNorman 91. 
143 CONTINUED: 143 For a moment they float where they stood, ghostly apparitions of the people they once were before the curse. They stare sadly out at their flesh and blood descendents, and in an instant become just specks of light that are caught by the breeze and carried out of sight. 
EXT. OLD FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT 
Norman blinks open his eyes, taking a moment to survey the scene around him. He sits upon the upturned root of the tree, the earth around broken and twisted, a testament to what has happened. He looks up into the sky and gives a sad smile. 
NORMAN Sleep tight. He clambers down through the roots back toward the path.

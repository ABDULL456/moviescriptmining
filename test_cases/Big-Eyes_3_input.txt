FRIENDLY GUY I thought that was you! 
WALTER 
(EMBARRASSED) Oh! Uh... er, hi, Don. 
FRIENDLY GUY Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we heard back from the city, on that setback? My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail. Walter is mortified. He turns away from Margaret. 
WALTER Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday. 
FRIENDLY GUY Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects! Pleased, the guy cheerily strides away. 
ON WALTER AND MARGARET He is stricken. Something ominous just happened. 
MARGARET What was that?? 
WALTER 
(ASHAMED) I -- I didn't want you to know... A long, horrible pause. Walter's face turns gray. We SLOWLY PUSH IN. This revelation is churning. Agony. 
WALTER I'm in commercial real estate. A stunned beat. 
MARGARET You're a -- Realtor? 
WALTER 
(CONTRITE) YES! A hugely successful Realtor! Top earner in the Downtown office three years running! 
MARGARET And you're... ashamed? 
WALTER Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet! 
(HEARTFELT) All I ever wanted was to support myself as an artist... 
(SAD; BEAT) I tried to make a clean break, but couldn't cut it. I'm just a goddam Sunday painter. An amateur. Margaret looks at him, touched by his vulnerability. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DUSK 
End of the day. Golden light slants in through the windows of this small tidy apartment. The door opens. Margaret holds it for Walter, who chivalrously staggers in, carrying all her supplies: Easel, paints, cans. He carefully puts it all down -- then turns. Beat. Walter stares at Margaret, their faces caught in the warm light. Then, enchanted, he kisses her. Silence. Margaret smiles, captivated. Caught in his glow. The moment could last forever... 
IN THE DOORWAY Jane stares unhappily. Threatened. 
JANE A-hem! 
ON MARGARET She turns, startled. Feeling guilty, Margaret rushes from Walter. Busying herself, she skims through the MAIL. Jane shakes her head and marches out. Margaret flips through envelopes -- until one stops her. On edge, she slowly removes an official DOCUMENT. She scans it... and her face drops. Crushed. Something terrible... Walter is worried. 
WALTER What's wrong...? 
MARGARET 
(SOFT) Frank wants to take away Jane. He says I'm an unfit mother... Walter is taken aback. 
WALTER You're a perfect mother. 
MARGARET He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. It's beyond my abilities as a single woman... Margaret trails off, shaken. Walter gulps unsurely. Then, he takes her in his arms. We 
SLOWLY PUSH IN. 
WALTER Marry me. 
MARGARET 
(SHE GASPS) Walter! I -- 
WALTER (he puts a finger to her lips) Shh. Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. (he gives a winning smile) I know it makes no sense!

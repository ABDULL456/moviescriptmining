MARIE Let's just get this over with. (to Elena) You won. You got what you wanted... 
ELENA (mocking) I just wanted justice... 
THEO Tomorrow you'll take the stand, tell the jury you faked the evidence, faked the tape... 
ELENA (sarcastic) Really? 
MARIE We are prepared to make it worth your while. 
She holds the Daughter diamond in front of Elena's greedy little eyes. 
ELENA (poker face) Not bad. But I always wanted a family... 
Theo nudges Marie. She sighs, holds out the Mother diamond in the other hand. A broad grin stretches across Elena's face. 
F 
THEO They're yours after you exonerate my client. 
ELENA I'm afraid I'm gonna need that payment up front. 
MARIE No, that's not the deal. 
ELENA It is now. Take it or leave it. 
Marie takes a deep breath. It's the most difficult thing she's ever had to do in her young life. Dead silence, except for Uncle Marty's snoring from the front room. 
inally, with a very heavy heart, Marie hands over the diamonds. 
THEO When this is all over, you'll leave town. For good. 
Elena points to the ankle bracelet. 
ELENA I go more than five miles from the police station and I'm straight back in juvie... 
THEO I understand your Parole term is up next week. 
Elena smiles. 
ELENA You've done your homework. Fine. (points to the ankle bracelet) As soon as this thing comes off, I'm outta here... 
She reaches down and grabs the diamonds. Dances past Marie... 
THEO May I suggest a little discretion, Miss Sandoval. Certain...questions might be asked about this...arrangement if you were to...say...turn up to Blue Bay High wearing a tiara... 
Elena winks. 
ELENA I ain't gonna flaunt it, mate. I gots too much class for that shit. 
MARIE You're going to tell the truth on the stand tomorrow, yes? 
Elena raises her right hand... 
ELENA I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth... 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
The court Bailiff nods, takes the Bible from Elena's hands. She's dressed in the closest thing to a modest suit she has in her wardrobe; a low cut jacket and tiny miniskirt... 
The courtroom is packed with journalists, TV cameras and nosey neighbors. Everyone wants a piece of this story. At the defendant's table, Jay, slick once more in Armani, watches Theo approach the witness box with a new-found confidence. 
Sitting in the front row of the public gallery, Marie is riveted on the action. At the back of the courtroom, Kristen fidgets nervously beside Morrison as Theo steps up, ready to question the newly compliant star witness in this sensational rape trial... 
THEO It's your assertion that my client, Mr. Clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you on the night of the 25th. Is that true? 
A hushed silence. Marie, Jay, Theo all wait expectantly... 
THEO Is that what you say happened? 
Elena clears her throat. 
ELENA He... He didn't... 
A collective intake of breath from the crowd. 
ELENA ....just sexually assault me.

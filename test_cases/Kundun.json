And chickens.  And we had four years of bad crops, all the farmers did. \nPortrait of a mountain - Anye Machin II - twenty thousand feet high and slightly obscured by clouds. \nWOMAN (VO) In the night, I knew you were coming. \nNow, the foothills.  The still photograph of this barren mountain range comes to life as we see something moving. \nIt is a small caravan - traveling this narrow mountain pass. \nWOMAN (VO) At dawn, you were born. \nCLOSER on this caravan.  We can make out eight or ten men, walking, and on horseback, dressed in heavy, brocade coats, and large woolen hats, black braids trailing down their backs.  A yellow palanquin is carried by four large monks, wearing maroon robes. \nThe caravan reaches the top of the mountain pass and turns - a sudden shift in direction - a switchback.  The travelers head downhill. \nBOY (VO) Tell me. \nNow, we see the mens's destination.  A lake.  An incredibly blue, circular lake, sunk between snow-dusted mountains.  It is LHAMO I' LATSO - \"the Oracle Lake\" - and it shimmers in the sunlight. \nAs the lake comes into view, a young man pushes back the curtain of the yellow palanquin and peers down at it. \nThe man is dressed in royal robes.  He is young, twenty four years old.  His name is RETING RINPOCHE.  He is the Regent of Tibet. \nThe color of the lake changes - from brilliant turquoise, to a deep, murky, unfathomable darkness. \nWOMAN (VO) You were a beautiful baby. So calm. \nBOY (VO) No cried? \nThe woman laughs. \nWOMAN (VO) Maybe, just a little. \nThe palanquin is set down on a flat rock overlooking the lake.  The water's color changes again, to a deep purple, then blue again, then red, then indigo. \nWOMAN (VO) And that day, your father got better.  He named you Lhamo. \"The Protector.\" \nBOY (VO) I know. \nSilence. \nThe noblemen and monks surround Reting as he steps out of the palanquin. \nOne man stands out here, a monk, a high lama in fact, with a kind face and fantastic, mesmerizing eyes.  He is the LAMA OF SERA. \nWOMAN (VO) Go to sleep, Lhamo. \nReting stares at the lake. \nThe water turns a light grey, and an image appears - obscure at first, then becoming more solid.  A vision. \nHe sees a house - a small, stone, one-story, u-shaped house. \nMAN (OC) Good day. \nMOTHER (OC) Please, come in, so cold. \nMAN (OC) We are traveling to Lhasa.  May we...? \nMOTHER (OC) Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen. \nMAN (OC) Thank you. \nA middle-aged man, the SERVANT, wearing heavy, ragged clothes and wrapped boots, enters the kitchen. \nLhamo slides over so that the man can sit on the platform beside him.  The man picks up a few pebbles and drops them - he knows the game. \nWe recognize this servant.  His name is KEUSTANG RINPOCHE. He is one of the monks we saw at the Oracle lake, the one with the mesmerizing eyes.  Keustang Rinpoche is the Lama of Sera Monastery. \nLhamo sees a dark brown rosary around the Servant's neck and immediately pulls at the string of beads. \nLHAMO Mine. \nThe Servant takes the rosary off and gives it to the boy. Lhamo hangs the string of beads around his own neck.  The Servant makes a move to take back the rosary, but Lhamo resists. \nLHAMO Mine. \nSERVANT Mine. \nLHAMO Please. \nSERVANT I will give it to, if you can tell me who I am. \nLhamo looks up, into the man's piercing, black eyes. \nLHAMO The Lama of Sera. You come. \nThe Mother enters and immediately sees the rosary around her son's neck.  She gives it back to the Servant. \nMOTHER Lhamo, no. \nLhamo goes back to his game.  The Mother hands the tired man a slice of bread and a steaming cup of tea.  The man's hands are shaking.  He cannot look the woman in the eye. \nSERVANT Thank you. \nEXT.  COURTYARD  DAWN \nThe travelers make their departure at dawn. \nAs the party reaches the gate, Lhamo runs from the house, crying: \nLHAMO Wait!  No! \nThe men stop.  Lhamo runs to the Servant. \nLHAMO Me, too.  Me go, too. Lhasa! \nLhamo is in tears. \nMOTHER No, no, no.  Lhasa! He always says he will travel far away.  He always wants to go. \nSERVANT We cannot, young master. \nLHAMO You come back? \nA pause. \nSERVANT We will. \nThe travelers head down the road. \nMother and child return to their home, the Mother carrying the boy on her hip as he swings himself around to take a last look at the strangers. \nEXT.  COURTYARD  DAWN \nThe Father readies a pack train of horses.  Lobsang and Lhamo pull on the cinche straps. \nEXT.  FARMLAND  DAY \nThe Mother plows with a heavy yoke attached to a large yak. Lobsang Samten and Tsering Dolma help their mother.  Lhamo sleeps under an umbrella. \nEXT.  COURTYARD  DAY \nLobsang and Lhamo running, carrying a bowl of eggs. \nINT.  KITCHEN  NIGHT \nLobsang is wrapped in maroon wool, trying to hold still as his Mother pins and stitches.  Lhamo sits, sipping tea, watching, woefully. \nMOTHER Say, Kumbum Monastery. \nKEUSTANG RINPOCHE With permission? \nThe Lama carefully pulls back the boy's overalls.  There is a little birthmark, like a conch shell, on his shoulder. \nKeustang Rinpoche pulls up the boy's pants legs.  There is a funny skin marking on the legs, like tiger stripes. \nThe Lama rearranges the boy's clothing, then one more time, takes the beautiful, little hands in his own and whispers: \nKEUSTANG RINPOCHE \"Kundun\" \nHe says to the others, in a soft, secretive voice: \nKEUSTANG RINPOCHE He is the Presence. \nIn the background, by an open curtain, we see Lhamo's Mother. \nShe says, softly: \nMOTHER My oldest boy is an incarnation. \nKEUSTANG RINPOCHE So is your youngest. \nKeustang releases the boy's hands and brings his own closed palms up to his forehead. \nKEUSTANG RINPOCHE I wish you long life. \nThe Mother begins to cry. \nINT.  ALTAR ROOM  DAY \nLittle Lhamo, now dressed in yellow, fills the copper water bowls with difficulty. \nHis parents stand beside him.  They share one, frightened curious look. \nCLOSE on the statue of Buddha.  It is an image of Chenrezig, the Buddha of Compassion.  He has eleven heads and four, outstretched arms. \nEXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  DAY \nLhamo sits in the saddle in front of his Mother.  His Father and Sister ride beside them, through an incredible, empty, Tibetan landscape.  A Monk rides lead. \nEXT.  EST. SHOT / KUMBUM MONASTERY  DAY \nTurquoise-roof, golden-pagoda, a beautiful, white-washed monastery built against a terraced, green hillside of Amdo. \nINT.  PRIVATE ROOM, MONASTERY  DAY \nMother pats her son Lhamo's unruly hair and makes a soft, comforting sound.  Lobsang is there beside his brother. Lobsang is already dressed as a tiny monk - in a maroon robe, with short, clipped hair  An older brother, TAKSTER, age 17, a lama, is there. \nThe Mother lies: \nMOTHER I will be back in a few days. \nLHAMO How many? \nMOTHER Two. \nLhamo holds up two fingers. \nLHAMO This many? \nMOTHER Yes, yes.  Your brothers are here. \nTakster moves closer.  She places the sad youngster in Takster's arms. \nMOTHER One more kiss. \nLhamo kisses her, as does Lobsang and even Takster falls into her arms for a moment.  Then, she turns and goes, quickly. \nA Monk appears.  He produces a concertina and begins to play for the little boy. \nBut, Lhamo begins to cry, through the music, through the hugs of his brothers.  As a result of Lhamo's tears, Lobsang begins to cry.  Takster holds them both.  The music continues. The older, wiser, Takster begins to cry, too. The three brothers hold one another.  Three brothers, three monks, crying for their mother.  The music continues, echoing in this stone monastery. \nThe young \"Kundun\" is gently rocked by his older brother. \nHe begins to fall asleep. \nDREAM SEQUENCE \nThe sound of the concertina becomes chanting and we see row after row of monks, in a temple, their voices mingling in the empty room. \nView of a courtyard, with young novices, reciting.  Lobsang is among them. \nBOYS'S VOICES (VO) \"May I be the doctor and the medicine, And may I be the nurse, For all sick beings in the world, until everyone is healed.\" \nA TEACHER, a very stern-looking monk, carrying a thick, flat board, menacingly, behind his back, walks among the students. \nA golden head of a Buddha - a huge head - appears to be bursting through an archway at the end of a dark hallway. \nLhamo makes a dive for the tent's door. \nEXT. TENT  NIGHT \nStanding outside the tent is a BODYGUARD - a huge, burly man, wearing monk's robes.  He turns to the boy.  In one hand he holds a big stick.  His face is distorted and deformed by a large tumor under one eye.  It is a frightening sight.  He looks like a monster to the child. \nLhamo jumps back inside the tent.  The Bodyguard closes the appliqued flap. \nINT.  DRELJAM  DAY \nLhamo has had a haircut.  His Mother walks beside the carriage, holding his hand. \nLHAMO Who am I? \nMOTHER We do not know. \nEXT. PLAINS OF TIBET  NIGHT \nBy candlelight, Lhamo is transferred from the rugged, simple carriage, to one of exquisite, yellow silk. \nINT. PALANQUIN  JUST BEFORE DAWN \nLhamo peeks out of the silk curtain as he hears the arrival of many horses, many men.  SOLDIERS - hundreds of Tibetan soldiers - surround the palanquin. \nEXT.  PLAINS, OUTSIDE LHASA  DAWN \nThe yellow palanquin is carried across a human border of Tibetan noblemen.  These fantastic-looking men and women part, and drop to the ground in prostration, as the palanquin moves through their welcoming committee. \nINT. PEACOCK TENT  DAWN \nLhamo walks along a long, patterned carpet, looking up, at this lofty tent's stunning, blue silk, ceiling. \nHe is led to a tall, wooden throne, and he is lifted, and then he climbs to the top.  Lhamo settles in a cross-legged position on the brocade cushion. \nHe looks down. \nHundred of monks, abbots, noblemen, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Chinese, even a red-headed Englishman - they all bow to Lhamo. \nReting Rinpoche, the young Regent of Tibet, the man who saw this boy's face in his vision, stands below the throne.  He addresses the crowd: \nRETING RINPOCHE Chenrezi, the Buddha of compassion. The Wish Fulfilling Jewel. The Fourteenth Dalai Lama. \nAnd the Regent turns, hikes up his gorgeous robes, and prostrates before the child. \nRETING RINPOCHE Long life. \nIn the crowd stand Lhamo's Mother and Father and Lobsang Samten. \nOn their faces, we must see that they did not realize who their son, their brother, was believed to be. \nFirst the Mother, and then the Father, bow in front of their youngest child. \nMOTHER Long life. \nFATHER Long life. \nFinally, Lobsang. \nLOBSANG Long life, Lhamo. \nWe hear the sound of a great, Tibetan horn. \nWe hear peels of childish laughter. \nINT.  THE POTALA  DAY \nLobsang and Lhamo skid, slide, skate down the endless, slippery hallways of this huge, labyrinthine monastery. \nThree Monks scurry behind the boys, trying to keep up, trying to keep the young incarnate from slipping out of their sight. \nThey shout, in loud stage whispers: \nMONKS Kundun!  Kundun! \nThe monks are no match for the little boys, who are quickly out of sight. \nINT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  THE POTALA  DAY \nReting Rinpoche sits cross-legged on the floor of this brightly-painted, red room. \nAcross from him sits Lhamo, dressed in fine, yellow silk. \nThese are simple rooms, decorated with statues, deity scrolls and mandalas, an altar to Buddha.  Behind a glass case are toys, mixed in with the Buddhist artifacts:  dolls, puppets, balls, blocks, trains. \nReting Rinpoche is speaking. \nRETING RINPOCHE Centuries ago, a young boy was born.  His name was Gedundrub. The night of his birth, robbers came to his home and his family fled hiding the baby in a cattle pen. When they returned the next day, the baby was safe. They found him guarded by a pair of black crows. \nVendors hawk their goods to elegant ladies, wearing turquoise jewelry and carrying silken parasols.  Animals are herded through town by young boys.  Children play and squabble.  A white wall is covered with cartoons, lampoons - political posters - picturing the Regent, perhaps, as a man holding too much power. \nTENZIN GYATSO I want to go down there. \nNORBU THUNDRUP You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony. \nTENZIN GYATSO I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy.  Eat from the shops. \nNORBU THUNDRUP You cannot. \nTENZIN GYATSO I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside. \nNORBU THUNDRUP But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama. \nTENZIN GYATSO Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama. \nNORNU ThUNDRUP I would not know.  Maybe. \nThe view travels and we see a prison yard.  Shackled men share the yard with hairy, fat dogs. \nOne man looks up and sees that the yard is under surveillance.  Of course the men all know that this terrace belongs to the boy Dalai Lama. \nAs the boy watches, first one poor, ragged man, then another prostrates. \nTenzin Gyatso pulls away from the telescope.  He waves to the prisoners. \nEXT.  VALLEY OUTSIDE LHASA  DAY  (SUMMER, 1942) \nThe boy rides in his palanquin of yellow silk. \nHe is older now, seven or eight.  He peers through the curtain. \nA grand procession carries the Dalai Lama from the Potala to his summer residence, the Norbulinka. \nMonks walk in procession, as do members of the aristocracy, wearing their finest gowns and jewelry, holding their finest parasols, and soldiers, wearing ancient uniforms.  There are horses, banners and carriages.  Bodyguards carry the Dalai Lama's possessions - wrapped in yellow silk.  A band plays, \"God Save the King.\" \nIt is a magnificent display, and along the side of the road, Tibetans prostrate in the presence of the boy, not daring to look at him. \nEXT.  THE NORBULINKA  DAY \nEstablishing shot of this lovely park. \nZt looks like a sweet, summer home compared to the looming expansiveness of the Potala.  It is filled with deer and antelope, peacocks and nesting birds.  An eccentric collection of trees grow here - some indigenous, some gifts - bearing flowers and fruit.  There are fish ponds and even a Kyichu river tributary nearby. \nWe find the young Dalai Lama standing by this tributary daring to put one foot on a slippery, stepping stone.  An Attendant gently pulls him back. \nBeyond the river, a herder leads a small group of braying sheep towards town.  The boy watches.  He listens to the herder's song. \nEXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY \nThe Dalai Lama drops bits of food into a fish pond.  He calls the huge, lazy fish to come eat. \nTENZIN GYATSO Little ones first, only little ones. \nThe boy pushes the bigger ones away with a stick. \nEXT.  YELLOW WALL, NORBULINKA  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso runs through an open gate in a mustard yellow wall (which separates the Dalai Lama's residence from the rest of the Norbulinka), and up the steps leading to a white, one story, home - his parent's. \nINT.  PARENT'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY \nA startling, blue room. \nThe young Dalai Lama leans on the table where is Father sits eating pork rinds. \nLobsang is there, practicing his writing on a chalk board. \nTenzin Gyatso grabs one pork rind, then another, then a third. \nLOBSANG SAMTEN The Dalai Lama is not supposed to eat pork.  It is not good for your brain. \nThe Father uses the grease from the roasted lamb on the table to caress his long mustache and twirl each side into a point. \nThe Dalai Lama takes another, and then, suddenly, the boy reaches up and for no reason, he pulls on his Father's mustache, obviously hurting the man.  The Father slaps the boy's hand, hard. \nThe boy sits back, and begins drawing imaginary letters on the tabletop with his slapped hand. \nHis Father reaches out and takes the hurt hand.  He pulls the boy into his arms. \nFATHER I am sorry, Lhamo. \nTENZIN GYATSO It is alright, Father. \nThe Master of the Robe knocks at the door.  Father and son look up. \nMASTER OF THE ROBE Kundun, you must come back now. \nTENZIN GYATSO But you will always be here? \nMOTHER Me? \nTENZIN GYATSO You will always! \nMOTHER I have one more piece of news.  A baby is coming. \nTenzin grabs at her stomach and shrieks with laughter. \nTENZIN GYATSO Oh, Mama!  Who will it be? \nThe Mother places her hands on Tenzin Gyatso's. \nMOTHER Oh, no!  Who can it be? \nA string of old monks, stand, waiting for the naughty boy. \nINT.  ENTRANCE HALL, DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE, NORBULINKA, DAY \nThe boy runs up the stairs and towards the old men, but he stops and looks at a small cabinet standing, unobtrusively, in a corner.  Tenzin Gyatso goes to the cabinet and rattles the locked door. \nTENZIN GYATSO My teeth!  My teeth are in here! \nA monk takes the boy by the hand and leads him down a hallway. \nTENZIN GYATSO My old teeth! \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, EVENING \nA bell and a dorge are laid out on a small table.  Tenzin Gyatso sits in front of this table. \nA monk is chanting in low, deep tones, in the background. \nThe Dalai Lama's teacher, TAKTRA RINPOCHE, sits on the floor.  (Being the teacher, Taktra Rinpoche sits slightly higher than the Dalai Lama.)  Taktra is an older man, in his sixties.  He is stern, solid, no-nonsense. \nTaktra Rinpoche begins a prayer. \nTAKTRA RINPOCHE \"I take refuge in the three jewels, The Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangra.\" \nBut the boy leaps up from his table and goes to Taktra and hangs around his neck, shouting: \nTENZIN GYATSO You recite! You recite! \nTaktra gives the boy just the slightest of looks. \nTAKTRA RINPOCHE \"I take refuge in the three jewels, The Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangra.\" \nTenzin Gyatso releases the Lama and goes back to his own table. \nTAKTRA RINPOCHE \"Until I attain enlightenment.\" \nTaktra Rinpoche has a small table with the same hand instruments in front of him.  The teacher lifts the dorge, in a particular fashion, and rotates it. \nTenzin Gyatso lifts his dorge.  Taktra's hands move to the boy's and show him the correct movement.  It is tried again. Now, the bell is lifted and rung. \nTENZIN GYATSO I would like you to be my new Regent. \nTaktra stops.  He nods to the boy. \nAs the chanting continues, Taktra Rinpoche begins a weaving motion with his hands, delicate, beautiful, hypnotic. \nTenzin Gyatso copies the elder. \nWe are CLOSE on the boy's moving hands. The chanting becomes the voices of a hundred men, as we FADE OUT. \nFADE IN:  on the boy's hands, but they are a little larger - they are the hands of an eleven or twelve year-old boy - and the motion they carry out is on the verge of becoming extraordinarily beautiful. \nINT.  DARK ROOM, POTALA  EVENING (1944) \nTenzin Gyatso sits alone, in a small, dark green, room.  He is older.  His robes have changed slightly, his manner is more refined, more dignified. \nHe is on a retreat. \nThere is a soft knock at the door.  The door is opened and food is placed inside the small room by bodiless hands. Tenzin Gyatso collects his food.  He sips his tea and eats his tsampa, while reading from a long, narrow stack of scriptures.  Thangkas of MILERAPA - the great Tibetan poet and teacher - hang on the walls. \nWe notice the curly-toed shoes of the Master of the Kitchen, just visible beneath the wooden door. \nEXT.  COURTYARD, THE POTALA  NIGHT \nThe boy walks alone, moving to the rhythm of a memorization. His breath consolidates in the cold night air.  The sky is brilliant with stars. \nTENZIN GYATSO (reciting) \"As long as any living thing draws breath, wherever he shall be, there, in compassion, shall the Buddha appear, incarnate.\" \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA  DAY \nSchool is in session. \nThe view of the floor reveals that a \"toy\" war is being waged. \nWith a \"Meccano\" set, the young Dalai Lama has created what looks like an airplane, and a tank.  These vehicles are manned by beautifully detailed lead soldiers - British World War One Field soldiers, French Legionaries and American Artillery men. \nNorbu Thundrup, is flying low with a tsampa~dough airplane. He drops little tsampa-dough bombs from his hand.  He hits a tank and knocks down a few lead soldiers. \nTENZIN GYATSO Oh, nicely done, Norbu.  I will get you. \nThe Lord Chamberlain enters. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN May I listen to the news with you, Holiness? \nTENZIN GYATSO Please. \nA large, old-fashioned, short-wave radio broadcasts that there is still a real war in progress.  The BBC report is of the Pacific front. \nTENZIN GYATSO How big is Tibet's army? \nLORD CPIAMBERLAIN Roughly five thousand men. \nTENZIN GYATSO Is that big? \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN No.  Not very big. \nTENZIN GYATSO The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too. \nThe broadcast reports news of the civil war in China. \nTENZIN GYATSO Will we be in this war? \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN No.  This war is almost over. \nTENZIN GYATSO Will we ever be in war? \nThe Lord Chamberlain is silent.  Norbu answers. \nNORBU THUNDRUP We have enemies. \nTENZIN GYATSO The Chinese. \nNORBU THUNDRUP Yes. \nTENZIN GYATSO But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN No, we don't. \nTenzin Gyatso gets to his feet and takes an atlas from his table.   He lays the book open on the floor. \nTENZIN GYATSO This is Britain. \nNORBU THUNDRUP Ahh. \nTENZIN GYATSO Where is Poland? \nThe Lord chamberlain sits on the floor.  He points to Poland. \nTENZIN GYATSO Where is Pearl Harbor? \nThe Master of the Kitchen comes to look at the atlas. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN In the Pacific Ocean.  It is an island.  American territory. \nTENZIN GYATSO Where is Alsace? \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN I do not know, Holiness. \nTenzin Gyatso turns to a well thumbed page:  Tibet. \nTENZIN GYATSO This is Tibet. And this is China. \nNORBU THUNDRUP Ahh. \nThey all look at huge China. \nTENZIN GYATSO Certainly, we are safe in Tibet. \nNo one answers. \nFinally, as Norbu Thundrup begins to gather up the tsampa- dough: \nNORBU THUNDRUP We hope, Kundun. \nTenzin Gyatso turns to the Lord Chamberlain. \nTENZIN GYATSO What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama? \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN He warned about the future of Tibet. \nEXT.  DALAI LAMA'S TERRACE  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso climbs up on a small, wooden platform, and mans his telescope. \nTENZIN GYATSO It's the army, firing on Sera Monastery! Oh, no!  Oh, no! \nThe shooting continues. \nTENZIN GYATSO Why is this?  What is happening? Tell me! \nNORBU THUNDRUP Reting Rinpoche has been arrested.  He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side.  Now, there is trouble between them and the army. \nThe Lord Chamberlain arrives on the terrace. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun. \nTENZIN GYATSO Look here! \nThe Lord Chamberlain peers through the telescope as the shooting continues. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Tragic.  Unnecessary. \nThe Lord Chamberlain steps away from the telescope and the boy takes his place. \nThe shooting slowly stops. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Holiness? I have a letter. \nThe boy looks up. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN The Thirteenth Dalai Lama's warning. He wrote to you, the year before he died.  The year before you were born. \nThe Lord Chamberlain walks to a far, sheltered end of the terrace. \nTenzin Gyatso slowly turns the telescope to see the prison yard. \nView through the telescope;  the yard is full of prisoners, listening to the shooting.  One man sees the telescope aimed at the prison and prostrates.  Then another, and another. \nTenzin Gyatso steps away from the telescope and turns to follow his Lord Chamberlain. \nEXT.  OTHER SIDE OF TERRACE  DAY \nThe Lord Chamberlain opens a yellowing letter and begins to read.  Tenzin Gyatso sits down beside him. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN \"It may happen, that here in Tibet, religion and government will be attacked both from without and within. Unless we guard our own country...\" \nCLOSE on the Lord Chamberlain.  Today, he appears tired; the whites of his eyes appear enormous.  His voice is quite beautiful. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN \"...it will now happen that the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, the Father and the Son, and all the revered holders of the faith, will disappear and become nameless.\" \nTenzin Gyatso unwinds the rosary from his wrist and begins thumbing the brown beads. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN \"Monks and their monasteries will be destroyed. The rule of law will be weakened. The lands and properties will be seized.  They themselves will be forced to serve their enemies or wander the country like beggars.\" \n\"All beings will be sunk in great hardship and overwhelming fear; the days and nights will drag on slowly in suffering.\" \nHe is finished. \nTENZIN GYATSO What can I do?  I am only a boy. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN You are the man who wrote this letter.  You are the man who has come back to lead us.   You will soon have great responsibilities.  You must know what to do. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, ADJACENT ROOM,  DAY \nThe Regent and the Lord Chamberlain are present. \nAlso present is the KASHAG - a council of four men:  one monk, three laymen.  They are the Dalai Lama's advisory cabinet. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM  DAY \nThe boy rises from his desk.  Norbu says: \nNORBU THUNDRUP You remember who you are. You called for them. \nTenzin Gyatso enters the adjacent room. \nINT.  ADJACENT ROOM  DAY \nThe boy climbs onto a cushion and sits - a head above his officials.  He is tentative, unsure of form and procedure. \nThere is an awkward, formal silence.  Then: \nTENZIN GYATSO Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life. \nTAKTRA RINPOCHE It is possible, Holiness. \nTENZIN GYATSO You are unharmed? \nAtop a low building on the Yellow Wall, stands an elaborate enclosure - draped in yellow silk. \nThe Dalai Lama sits inside it. \nINT.  ENCLOSURE  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso is alone in this little room;  his arms rest on a window ledge as he stares down at the festival taking place below him. \nEXT.  GARDENS  DAY \nA bit more of the dancers and the people enjoying themselves - all from the isolated point of view of the Dalai Lama. \nWe recognize a few characters:  Keustang Rinpoche.  His Holiness's Mother with her younger children, the favorite sweeper, Norbu Thundrup - dressed in a fine hat. \nBut a distant figure becomes apparent - he is a MESSENGER - he is running, through the crowds, toward the Yellow Wall. \nWe stay on this desperate little figure as he draws closer. \nINT.  ENCLOSURE  DAY \nThe boy is watching the Messenger. \nEXT.  GARDENS  DAY \nBack to that messenger as he works his way, ever closer to the building which holds the Dalai Lama aloft, and then we lose sight of him. \nINT.  ENCLOSURE  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso leans back in his seat.  The yellow silk curtain that his elbows have held open now fall closed and we hear the heavy footsteps of the runner. \nA knock. \nTAKTRA RINPOCHE (OC) Enter. \nThe Regent is next door. \nThe boy climbs up on a chest and peeks through a tiny window in the wall which separates this enclosure from the Regent's. \nTaktra Rinpoche reads a telegram.  His aging face becomes quite grave. \nThe Regent leaves his side of the enclosure. \nREGENT (OC) Summon the Lord Chamberlain and the Kashag. \nAnd then, there is a knock on the Dalai Lama's door. \nTENZIN GYATSO Enter. \nIt is the Regent. \nREGENT TAKTRA Holiness. \nTENZIN GYATSO Yes. \nREGENT TAKTRA The Chinese have invaded. \nEXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY \nBack to a new group of performers - satirists, dressed as high lamas and monks - even as the Nechung Oracle - lampooning the rulers.  The crowd roars with laughter. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA  DUSK \nThe Lord Chamberlain stands with the teenage Dalai Lama. The room is a violent red in the sunset. \nTenzin Gyatso has cleared off his table, he is creating a three-dimensional battlefield as his Lord Chamberlain explains the situation.  Tenzin Gyatso uses papers, books, little statues to bring a physical life to the words we hear. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN They crossed the river, Holiness. They have invaded in six locations, Chando Province, Kham, eastern Tibet. \nTENZIN GYATSO What is the size of our army, now? \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India.  We have several hundred in the area. \nLittle statues are placed facing what stands-in for the river. \nThe Lord Chamberlain helps the boy to create this panorama. \nTENZIN GYATSO Has anyone died? \nLORD CHMBERLAIN The radio contact said one officer had died.  Then he said, \"The Chinese soldiers - they are coming.\" And then, the radio went dead. \nTenzin Gyatso lifts one statue, a small, golden Buddha, from the display.  He cradles the Buddha in his hands. \nTENZIN GYATSO One man.  A man has died. One man is too many. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA  DAY \nIn beautiful sunlight, the painted cabinets of this room glisten.  Rainbows of color play on the glass windows.  The Dalai Lama sits at a low table, a pack of colored pencils, or pastels, spread out around him.  He is teaching his little brother to draw. \nA monk - an abbot, in fact - sits beside Tenzin Gyatso. \nIt is Takster Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama's oldest brother. \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE I was never alone.  Two Chinese were with me every minute of the day. \nTenzin Gyatso plays with a box of those special sweets which comes from his mother. \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE Their talk is always of liberation and helpfulness.  They put their words like honey on a knife, but if you lick the honey, you will bleed. \nTakster Rinpoche begins to say something, but holds back. \nTENZIN GYATSO Tell me. \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you. \nTENZIN GYATSO You, kill me? \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE Eliminate you. \nThe tension is great, the idea profound. \nTARSTER RINPOCHE I can be Governor of Lhasa, they say. \nThe brothers try to resist, but cannot.  They laugh like crazy. \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick. \nTENZIN GYATSO Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me? \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE I do. \nTENZIN GYATSO I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now. \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE The Chinese have one goal.  The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. \nOur only hope is to fight. \nTENZIN GYATSO We cannot. \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet. \nTENZIN GYATSO Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy.  We have compassion for all people. \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts. \nSilence. \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee. \nTENZIN GYATSO How could I ever leave? \nTAKSTER RINPOCHE It may not be your decision to make. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA  DAY \nIn the adjacent room, the four members of the Kashag and the Lord Chamberlain are waiting. \nThe Dalai Lama enters the room. \nThe boy goes to a small table where a document is unrolled before him. \nTenzin Gyatso lifts the gold seal of power and affixes it to the document. \nTENZIN GYATSO I accept it. \nHe makes his mark on a small piece of parchment that is attached to the document. \nHe has accepted the request to be enthroned. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  HOUR BEFORE DAWN \nThe Master of the Robe is helping Tenzin Gyatso to dress. He ties a piece of green cloth around his waist and helps him on with his maroon robes. \nNorbu is there, watching. \nINT.  HALLS OF THE POTALA  PRE-DAWN \nTenzin Gyatso walks down this dark hall.  The three attendants are with him. \nINT.  TEMPLE  DAWN \nIt is very dark green.  Butter lamps highlight certain faces - members of the Kashag, noblemen, the tutors, an Englishman, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Tibetan Muslims - but the darkness conceals the great number of people present. \nWe hear the unmistakable Tibetan horns and cymbals. We hear the chanting of monks. \nThe boy is handed a Golden Wheel, symbolizing the assumption of temporal power. \nThe small group walks down a rocky path.  A grey horse is waiting. \nTenzin Gyatso is helped onto the horse.  Norbu sees that he is comfortable, and then, the flashlight goes out.  Norbu fiddles with it.  Tenzin Gyatso takes the torch and tries get it working again.  The Guard mounts his horse.  It is time to go.  The horses snort, their breath consolidating the cold night air. \nTenzin Gyatso cannot speak.  He tries, but he cannot.  Norbu takes the flashlight. \nNORBU THUNDRUP I will send it to you. It will work. \nThe horse is turned and the Dalai Lama is led away to join the soldiers at the foot of the path. \nTenzin Gyatso turns once, to see his friend.  The night is dark.  Norbu has become invisible. \nEXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT \nA cold and moonless night, lit only by the millions of stars that shine over Tibet.  The caravan - made up of noblemen, monks, family mambers and over two hundred soldiers (armed with rifles, machine guns and field artillery) - journeys out of Lhasa. \nCLOSE on the Dalai Lama:  riding the shepherd's path. \nEXT.  YELLOW WALL, NORBULINKA  NIGHT \nTenzin Gyatso rides his grey horse through a gate in the yellow wall. \nEXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE  NIGHT \nThe boy climbs the stairs to his summer residence. \nINT.  ALTAR ROOM  NIGHT \nThe shrine of Mahakala.  Butter lamps cast their eerie glow on the black walls as the boy presents a white, silk scarf, a kata - a traditional token of leaving and return. \nINT  ENTRANCE WAY, NORBULINKA  NIGHT \nTenzin Gyatso is about to leave the residence when he stops, and looks at the small cabinet in the corner.  He goes to it. \nThe door is still locked. \nCLOSE on the boy.  Suddenly, he knows. \nHe reaches a hand behind the cabinet.  The hand comes back to him with a key. \nTenzin Gyatso opens the cabinet doors.  Several drawers are revealed. \nThe boy opens one.  Empty.  Another.  Empty. \nA Bodyguard says, from the stairs: \nBODYGUARD We must go, Holiness. \nTENZIN GYATSO A moment. \nAnother drawer.  Empty.  And then, success. \nIn a small drawer, there is something, wrapped in red velvet. \nThe boy opens it, with shaking hands.  Teeth.  False teeth. \nTenzin Gyatso releases a sharp laugh, he has been holding his breath.   He wraps up the teeth and puts them back, but behind the teeth is something more. \nA rolled, white silk scarf, a kata. \nTenzin Gyatso takes the scarf.  He unrolls it.  Something falls on the floor. \nA tiny, lead soldier. \nTenzin Gyatso lifts the soldier.  It is a Ghurka.  An Indian soldier. \nBODYGUARD Please, come, Holiness. \nTENZIN GYATSO Yes.  I am ready. \nThe boy places the scarf around his own shoulders. \nTENZIN GYATSO Safe journey.  Safe return. \nI am him. \nCLOSE on the golden statue of Mahakala, wearing his white scarf. \nWe hear the roar of the Kyichu river. \nEXT.  KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT \nCoracles - skin boats - are loaded with bundles and people and pushed off the banks and into the water. \nHorses, donkeys and yaks must swim across. \nTenzin Gyatso is helped into a boat.  The rowers, wrapped in heavy wool and sheepskin, their arms bare, push off. \nMUSLIM MAN No, no son of mine will sit and read books and eat up the poor people's butter while my people have to butcher the cows and sheep because these holy men can't kill an animal.  They can eat it, can't they? \nThe boy laughs again. \nEXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - LATER  DAY \nStill walking, with two companions.  A Tibetan peasant WOMAN, and his own mother. \nTENZIN GYATSO Did you love your husband, before you married? \nTIBETAN WOMAN I did not know him before I married him.  I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too.  He is dead now. \nTENZIN GYATSO Hmm. \nTIBETAN WOMAN The land has stayed in the family. We work together.  The nobleman is not too bad. \nTENZIN GYATSO Does he treat you fairly? \nA laugh from her. \nTIBETAN WOMAN Not too bad.  Rich is rich, poor is poor.  We are different. Are you married? \nTenzin Gyatso laughs. \nThe Attendants walk behind the boy, eavesdropping.  Tenzin Gyatso's Mother plays along. \nTENZIN GYATSO No. \nTIBETAN WOMAN Too young? \nTENZIN GYATSO Much too young. \nTIBETAN WOMAN Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woinan who keeps her hands busy.  Look for a kind heart. \nTENZIN GYATSO Like my mother. \nTIBETAN WOMAN I see that. \nEXT.  COUNTRYSIDE, STILL LATER  DAY \nThe Dalai Lama walks beside two boys: his older brother, Lobsang, and a YOUNG NOBLE BOY. \nTENZIN GYATSO This little brother was terribly sweet.  When he died, my mother was so sad.  A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin.  He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born. \nNOBLE BOY Does he have the spot? \nTENZIN GYATSO He does, a little spot where the butter had been. \nNOBLE BOY Is that a true story, or pretend? \nTENZIN GYATSO What do you think? \nNOBLE BOY True. \nTENZIN GYATSO You decide. \nThey walk. \nNOBLE BOY What does the butter spot feel like? \nTENZIN GYATSO Soft.  Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.  He has a very poor beard, with a little spot on his chin where no hair grows.  It feels like that. \nEXT.  EST. SHOT,  DUNGKHAR MONASTERY - ON A HILL, OVERLOOKING DROMO VALLEY  DAY \nIt is raining as we see the Dalai Lama on horseback, climbing the dirt path leading to this beautiful, small monastery.  The caravan has arrived at its destination. \nWe hear the chanting of monks. \nINT.  THE DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, DUNGKAAR MONASTERY DAY \nA home has been made:   books on the shelf, screwdrivers all in a row, European shoes under the bed.  An old Bush radio receiver, running off a six-volt battery, sits on the floor. The telescope stands on the terrace. \nTwo members of the Kashag can be seen in the adjacent room. The rooms are stark white. \nKASHAG MEMBER Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away. \nTENZIN GYATSO (OC) All? \nINT.  ADJACENT ROOM  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso, dressed informally, looking peaceful, sits with his advisors on the floor.  The Lord Chamberlain is with them. \nKASHAG MEMBER Britain, Nepal, America, India. All of those governments have refused to meet with our representatives. \nSilence. \nTENZIN GYATSO And the United Nations?  Surely? \nTenzin Gyatso is stunned.  Frozen. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN (OC) It means we have lost our status as an independent nation. \nINT.  PARLOR, DUNGKHAR MONASTERY  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso, the two members of the Kashag and the Lord Chamberlain stand around a clicking telegraph machine.  A long message curls along the floor. \nKASHAG MEMBER Ngabo did not have the state seal.  He could not sign. \nTENZIN GYATSO Yes, but they say he did. \nA Kashag Member is reading along as the message comes in. \nKASHAG MEMBER Holiness? \nTENZIN GYATSO Yes. \nKASHAG MEMBER General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you. \nTENZIN GYATSO Then, we shall meet. \nEXT.  TERRACE, MONASTERY  DAY \nView through the telescope:  the Chinese are coming. \nA group of officials are headed in the direction of the monastery.  Within the group of Tibetan noblemen - dressed in their traditional red and gold silk robes - are three men, wearing drab, grey suits. \nThe Chinese men closer and we see that one of them is smoking a cigarette. \nCLOSE on Tenzin Gyatso's face. \nINT.  PARLOR, MONASTERY  DAY \nThe Chinese Delegation, led by GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU, stands waiting in a dimly-lit, yellow room. \nA table holds tea and refreshments. \nThe Dalai Lama and his cabinet members are in the room. Chairs are provided. \nGENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU Dalai Lama. \nTENZIN GYATSO General Chiang. \nGENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU We bring greetings from Chairman Mao. \nTENZIN GYATSO Thank you.  Please sit. \nThe General does.  So does the Dalai Lama. The other two Chinese remain standing. \nTenzin Gyatso is quiet, reserved.  Awkward. \nGENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement? \nTENZIN GYATSO I have. \nGENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU I have a copy for you. \nA document is produced.  We notice that the General is wearing a gold rolex watch.  The Dalai Lama notices, too. A member of the Kashag takes the document. \nGENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU We come in genuine friendship. \nCLOSE on the Dalai Lama. \nHe makes no response. \nGENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU I am certain you wish to return to Lhasa. \nTenzin Gyatso remains silent. \nGENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama? \nTENZIN GYATSO Soon. \nGENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU Good.  Our first request is that you allow us to build a road.  You have no roads in Tibet.  We can discuss the plans in Lhasa.  When you return. \nNo response. \nGENERAL CHIANG-WU Thank you.  We leave now. \nThe General rises as the boy remains seated.  With a moment of awkward silence, the Chinese depart. \nTENZIN GYATSO Let me see the agreement. \nIt is handed to him.  He opens to the last page and looks at the impression made by the state seal. \nTENZIN GYATSO Counterfeit. \nDREAM SEQUENCE ENDS \nTenzin Gyatso eyes burst open.  He is awake.  He is older. Twenty.  But, there is something ageless about him, now. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S ROOM, THE POTALA  PRE-DAWN \nThe boy begins this day. \nHe is in his old room at the Potala, in Lhasa.  The green mural of the Fifth Dalai Lama is behind him.  He has risen. from the red-curtained bed. \nThe Masters of the Kitchen and the Robe arrive and begin their preparations for the day. \nA NEW SWEEPER works in the adjacent room. \nThe sun rises. \nEXT.  THE POTALA  DAY \nLike a painting, the beautiful monastery fills the screen with its white walls and red roof. \nShouting is heard. \nGENERAL CHIANG (OC) I hate meeting here, this tribute to the past!  I demand a less formal meeting place. \nCLOSE on the red, bulging face of General Chiang. \nINT.  GREAT HALL, THE POTALA  DAY \nBehind the General hang fantastic thangkas of the Fifth Dalai Lama. \nGENERAL CHIANG I am not a foreigner! I refuse to be treated like one. \nThe Dalai Lama is shaken by this violent behavior. He adjusts his new eye glasses. \nTENZIN GYATSO You see here thangkas of the Fifth Dalai Lama, the founder of our government.  It is tradition at formal meetings for these thangkas to be hung. \nGENERAL CHIANG Superstitions.  Tibet is part of a modern nation. \nThe General sits. \nGENERAL CHIANG I want the songs stopped. \nTENZIN GYATSO Songs?  What songs? \nA slight smile. \nPRIME MINISTER LUKHANGWA Street songs about the General. Reference to his gold watch. He is right, they are quite insulting. \nTENZIN GYATSO I have no authority to ban singing in my country. \nGENERAL CHIANG You must also do something about the public meetings.  I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances. \nLUKHANGWA You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend. \nGENERAL CHIANG We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement. \nLUKHANGWA Are you, General? \nGENERAL CHIANG We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed. \nLUKHANGWA Impossible!  You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp. \nGENERAL CHIANG The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging. \nLUKHANGWA So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist.  You will have to re- evaluate your needs. \nThe men glare at one another. \nGENERAL CHIANG How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister? \nLUKHANGWA It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian. \nThe General leaps to his feet and is about to strike the Prime Minister. \nThe Dalai Lama runs between then.  He holds the General back. \nLUKHANGWA Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa? \nGENERAL CHIANG To protect.  To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now. \nLUKHANGWA Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet. \nThe General backs away and brings himself under control. \nGENERAL CHIANG Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized. \nLUKHANGWA I will not approve it. \nMao Tse Tung's presence is charismatic.  His delivery is powerful - simple, yet firm.  He is spellbinding. \nMAO TSE TUNG The mission of China is to bring progress to Tibet.  Develop its natural resources.  Help its people develop democracy. We welcome you, Tibet, back to the Motherland! \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S ROOM, CHINESE GUEST HOUSE  NIGHT \nTenzin Gyatso snoops around this room.  He opens drawers, cabinets, just as a child would.  He finds odd little pieces of ceramics, pens, paper. \nHe moves to the bathroom, runs a bath.  Hot water. Electricity.  This is the modern world. \nINT.  MAO'S OFFICE  DAY \nThe Dalai Lama sits beside Chairman Mao as a horde of photographers flash bulbs in their faces.  Mao offers His Holiness a plate of Chinese delicacies. \nWe notice that Mao's clothes are shabby and old. (His suit is always a shade lighter than everyone else's grey-drab). His cuffs are frayed, his collar is worn.  But, his shoes, are beautifully polished. \nHe has exquisite, delicate hands and his skin is shinny. \nLater, Chairman Mao and the Dalai Lama sit across from one another. \nTenzin Gyatso takes notes as Mao speaks. \nMAO TSE TUNG I am so glad that Tibet has come back to the Motherland. \nTenzin Gyatso quietly sips his tea. \nMAO TSE TUNG You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature. \nTENZIN GYATSO I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation. \nMAO TSE TUNG It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement.  We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet.  The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary. \nMao speaks and moves very slowly.  He pants and wheezes.  He appears to be sick.  Tenzin Gyatso takes notes. \nTENZIN GYATSO I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao.  I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay. \nMAO TSE TUNG Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country.  A a wonderful history.  Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you.  In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China. \nTenzin Gyatso writes in his notebook. \nMAO TSE TUNG You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha.  He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption.  Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix. \nTENZIN GYATSO For me, I think such a mix is crucial. \nMAO TSE TUNG Have a sweet. Made in my home province.  The kind my mother used to make. \nThe Dalai Lama accepts. \nEXT.  GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso does physical exercise with a few Chinese Bodyguards. \nEXT.  GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso studies with Ling Rinpoche. The Lord Chamberlain sits with them. \nTENZIN GYATSO \"If moral discipline is learned from the beginning, one possesses the root for achieving higher rebirth.  A staircase for achieving liberation.  An antidote eliminating misery and sorrow.  Without discipline there is no method.\" \nPause. \nTENZIN GYATSO I am thinking of becoming a Communist Party Member. I like what I see of Marxism.  It is based on equality and justice for all. I believe Chairman Mao wishes the best for our people.  Our path must be non-violence.  Co-operation. \nThe Lord Chamberlain simply looks at the young man.  He has nothing to say. \nINT.  MAO'S OFFICE  NIGHT \nThere is a knock and Tenzin Gyatso is led into the room. \nMao is at his desk, working late, smoking heavily. \nMAO TSE TUNG Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late. \nTENZIN GYATSO I leave tomorrow. \nMAO TSE TUNG Yes, I am aware.  How has your time in China been? \nTenzin Gyatso sits. He takes out his book and pen, ready to take notes. \nTENZIN GYATSO I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments.  Industrial progress.  Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous. \nMAO TSE TUNG You have a lot to learn about organization.  How to draw out people's opinions.  How to make key decisions.  Train your young Tibetans.  When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan. \nDALAI LAMA Always. \nTenzin Gyatso records Mao's words. \nMAO TSE TUNG Your attitude is good, you know. I understand you well. But you need to learn this: religion is poison. It undermines the race and it retards the progress of the people.  Tibet has been poisoned by religion. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession.  I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight. \nThe Dalai Lama rubs his face with his hands. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Land reform is underway in Amdo.  The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished. \nTENZIN GYATSO A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese. \nThe men are silent.  We hear the constant sound of trucks and cars. \nThe Lord Chamberlain is notably pausing. \nTENZIN GYATSO I have always asked for plain information.  Just the truth. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham.  It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes. \nAgain, silence. \nTENZIN GYATSO The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible.  Resistance, when it is not. \nEXT.  TERRACE  DAY \nHis Holiness walks to the terrace.  He aims the telescope. \nBelow him he sees a new Lhasa - a Lhasa full of trucks and Chinese soldiers.  A traffic island stands in the center of an intersection.  The town walls are white-washed.  The political posters are gone. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE NORBULINKA DAY \nA small group sits waiting on red velvet chairs: the Dalai Lama, the Lord Chamberlain and the Kashag. \nGeneral Chiang enters the room. He finds a chair and pours himself a cup of tea.  We cannot help but notice - he is armed. \nGENERAL CHIANG We have decided that no drastic changes will take place in Tibet for six years. This should make you happy. \nSilence. \nGENERAL CHIANG It seems a revolt has broken out in the east. We have decided that the Tibetan army must be used against the Khamba guerrillas. \nThe General sips. \nThe Dalai Lama answers. \nTENZIN GYATSO I will not approve it. \nThe General looks up, surprised.  It took a great deal of courage for the young man to answer back, so determinedly. \nTENZIN GYATSO You have bombed on peaceful people. \nGENERAL CHIANG We must deal with these reactionaries! \nTENZIN GYATSO No.  We are peace loving people. I am afraid we cannot trust you. \nThe General sputters: \nGENERAL CHIANG We are here to heal the people of Tibet.  You need reform. You have no sense of what is good for your people. We are here to liberate you! \nNow, the boy finds his voice. \nTENZIN GYATSO I burn here, but I am not suppose to let the smoke show.  Yes, we need reform.  The monasteries. Communications.  Schools.  But we want change for Tibet, as Tibet needs it, not for China. \nThe General starts to speak but Tenzin Gyatso keeps talking. \nTENZIN GYATSO Buddha is our physician, General, he will heal us.  Comapssion and enlightnement will set us free. You can not liberate me I can only liberate myself. \nThe General leaves the room. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN They will take Lhasa next. \nTENZIN GYATSO The people will not allow it. \nINT.  PRAYER ROOM, NORBULINKA  NIGHT \nThe Nechung Oracle is in full swing.  It is an especially vivid and violent spin he is in.  The headdress whips this way and that, and finally he says: \nNECHUNG ORACLE Where there is no crossing a big river, no fords, no shallows, where the only hope is a boat, and there is no boat... I will put a boat, Kundun. \nThe wish-Fulfilling Jewel will shine from the West. \nIt is a strange and confusing prophecy. \nEXT./ INT.  NORBULINKA  DAY \nA few random views of the Norbulinka: \nThe wandering deer and peacocks.  The fish pond and its inhabitants. \nCLOSE on the little cabinet in the corner of the entrance hall. \nTenzin Gyatso's hands open the doors. \nThe young man pulls open the drawer which contains the false teeth. \nTenzin Gyatso pulls a rolled kata from his coat.  He tucks the lead soldier of an Indian Ghurka into the center of the scarf.  He places the bundle in the drawer. \nThen, he adds something.  A sweet.  The kind his Mother makes. \nHe closes the drawer, and locks it. \nHe hides the key, again, behind the small, unobtrusive cabinet. \nEXT.  RESIDENCE, STAIRS  NIGHT \nWith a soldier on either side of him, the Dalai Lama descends the staircase. \nThe Soldiers start to lead him away, but he pauses. \nTENZIN GYATSO Wait. \nThe young man leaves them. \nEXT.  RESIDENCE  NIGHT \nHe walks to the far side of this white building. \nTENZIN GYATSO I see a safe journey. \nThe boy returns to the front steps. \nTENZIN GYATSO I see a safe return. \nThe soldiers wait. \nTENZIN GYATSO Now.  I am ready. \nTenzin Gyatso places the scroll over one shoulder.  A soldier lays a rifle over the other one. \nEXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  NIGHT \nThe three men walk quietly through the empty gardens.  We hear the sounds of the crowd grow louder. \nEXT.  WALL  NIGHT \nThe soldiers pause, look to His Holiness.  Tenzin Gyatso removes his glasses, puts them in his bag, then nods - and the soldiers open the gate. \nSOLDIER Move aside, tour of inspection, move aside. \nOf course, we see only a fraction of the crowd - angry men and women. \nA man steps beside His Holiness. \nTenzin Gyatso looks up - face to face. \nIt is the Khamba bodyguard, the monk who guarded him so many times.  The man with the horrible face. \nKHAMBA BODYGUARD Move aside, let us through. Move aside! \nThe Dalai Lama is between the soldiers, shouldering his own gun.  The Bodyguard falls in behind. \nThe little group makes its way through the crowd. \nEXT.  TRIBUTARY OF ThE KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT \nIn the same place where the little Tenzin Gyatso tentatively tested one rock, the escape party crosses on the slippery, stepping stones. \nEXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT \nThe small party makes its way across a bit of countryside. \nPeople are camped here - Khambas, farmers, nomads.  The Dalai Lama crosses to safety - unnoticed. \nEXT.  KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT \nCoracles await. \nThe Dalai Lama climbs in, the Lord Chmaberlian sits beside him.  The soldiers push off. The Khamba Bodyguard stands on the bank, alone. \nEvery splash of the oars sounds like it could wake the dead. \nTenzin Gyatso looks back.  He puts on his glasses. \nHe sees camp fires and the glow of torches.  He hears echoed voices. \nHe looks up.  He sees the stars and the moon and that incomparable Tibetan sky. \n", "test1_input": "NORBU THUNDRUP I am braver. \nNorbu Thundrup plays like a child.  It is a fight to the finish. \nTENZIN GYATSO I have more men. \nNORBU ThUNDRUP I have smarter men. \nTenzin Gyatso has lost;  he dissolves into tears. \nNORBU THUNDRUP Today you lose.  Tomorrow you may win. \nNorbu snaps his fingers. \nNORBU THUNDRUP Things change, Kundun. \nTENZIN GYATSO Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this. \nTenzin touches the soft, bald, chin of Norbu. \nTENZIN GYATSO Soft. \nAnd then, Tenzin Gyatso tries to snap his fingers.  He cannot. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DUSK \nTenzin Gyatso stands at the window, watching, listening. His hands knead the colored dough into balls, ready to create the next army, the future battleground, as he recites, softly: \nTENZIN GYATSO \"As long as all living draw breaths, there Buddha is.\" \nNorbu Thundrup smiles as he polishes the floor, clearing it of tsampa dough. \nINT.  GREAT HALL, THE POTALA  DAY \nThe Great Hall in the Potala is the seat of Tibetan Government. \nThese palace walls are hung with beautiful, old thangkas (silk embroideries or paintings),  depicting the life of Buddha. \nInside the hall sits the acting government:  the YIGSTANG and the TSITANG - four monks, four laymen - all dressed in their appropriate simplicity and elaborateness.  These men sit in two rows, facing one another.  The senior monk and the senior layman sit a bit forward. They are the speakers. \nThe senior LAYMAN is on his knees, speaking. \nLAYMAN I believe that the Regent is asking for too high a reward for his part in finding the Dalai Lama.  Too much money, too much land. \nINT.  HALLWAY  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso peeks through a door at the great assembly. \nThe Lord Chamberlian stands behind him. \nINT. GREAT HALL  DAY \nThe Layman continues. \nLAYMAN Our treasuries are empty.  Our army is depleted.  He would have us pull the hair from our noses. \nINT.  HALLWAY  DAY \nThe Dalai Lama is confused, but continues listening. \nINT.  GREAT HALL  DAY \nThe Layman returns to his cross-legged position. \nThe senior MONK speaks. \nMONK We note this.  Now, the Chinese. \nThere is audible expression of tension. \nMONK The Allies wish to build a supply- road from India, crossing Tibet, as part of their war effort.  The road would lead directly to China. \nThe Layman gets to his knees. \nLAYMAN We cannot allow it. Right now, we have a only a small Chinese mission in Lhasa, the first since the Thirteenth Dalai Lama threw them out in 1912. The road would increase the size of that mission. The Chinese would try to control our trade, as they did once before, control our contact with the outside world. \nINT.  HALLWAY  DAY \nThe Lord Chamberlain touches the boy's shoulder and Tenzin Gyatso leaves his hiding place, as the speaker's voice fades away. \nAs the two walk down the hallway, Tenzin Gyatso spots an unusual wooden door.  He lets the Lord Chamberlain get a little bit ahead of him, and then the boy tries the door. It is heavy.  It almost opens. \nINT.  HALLWAY  LATER, DUSK \nTenzin Gyatso and his brother Lobsang are pulling at the heavy door.  Behind them, in the distance, we hear: \nMONKS (OC) Kundun!  Kundun! \n", "test1_true": "INT.  STORAGE ROOM  DUSK \nA treasure awaits them. \nIt looks like Aladdin's cave - full of odd, European items. \nThere are glittering music boxes, a porcelain sink, a gilded mirror, a lacquered rocking horse.  There are hats, umbrellas and even a pair of lace-up, cordovan shoes. Tenzin Gyatso lifts a reel of film.  There are piles of magazines and books.  There is a stack of tires in the back corner.  The boys uncover a train set and a good collection of lead soldiers.  The Dalai Lama pockets a gold watch. \nJust as the monks find their young charges and we hear them at the door, Tenzin sees something truly spectacular.  It is a telescope. \nThe monks enter the room as the young Dalai Lama reaches for this miracle. \nTENZIN GYATSO What is it? \nTHE ATTENDANTS Ah, it is a telescope, Holiness. With this you can see a long way. \nTENZIN GYATSO And, is it mine? \nATTENDANT These are all gifts sent to your predecessors. \nLOBSANG SAMTEN Yes!  Then it is yours! \nTENZIN GYATSO I need it. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT \nWe are in the adjacent room, listening, as Norbu Thundrup tells a bedtime story. \nGolden butter lamps burn before a statue of Buddha. \nNORBU THUNDRUP (OC) One night, not too long ago, an old monk saw a woman in that very same hallway where you ran away. \nINT.  BEDROOM  NIGHT \nThe boy is in bed.  The Sweeper finishes-off his story as the boy wiggles deeper under the covers. \nNORBU THUNDRUP She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had.  Heads.  Human heads. Only the heads. \nTENZIN GYATSO Is that true or pretend? \nNORBU THUNDRUP It is a story, you decide. \nTENZIN GYATSO Pretend. \nNORBU THUNDRUP As you say. \nThe Sweeper tucks the boy in as the Master of the Robe finishes his nightly preparations and with a pat and a smile, the two men leave the room. \nA mouse steals a bit of tsampa from the offerings placed on the altar before the Buddha. \nTenzin Gyatso peeks out from under his covers and looks to see if those curly-toed shoes are visible under the partition.  They are.  The Master of the Kitchen is still near. \nTenzin Gyatso pulls the golden pocket watch from under the covers.  He pries and digs at the back of the watch until he succeeds in popping it open, revealing its miraculous insides. \nFinally, Tenzin Gyatso's eyelids grow heavy.  The camera passes over his face, as his eyes close. \nThe boy begins to speak, mumble, as he falls asleep: \nTENZIN GYATSO \"I be an island for those who seek one, a lamp for light.\" \nWe find two scrolls;  the first is PENDEN LHAMO, the special protectress of the Dalai Lama. \nShe rides her wild mule through a sea of blood - between rows of jagged mountains.  Pointed fingers and spreading toes, her hair gone crazy, her fangs revealed - the details are incredible.  A garland of freshly severed heads hangs around her body, snakes hold up her skirt, five skulls form ber crown. \nTENZIN GYATSO (VO) \"May I be a bed for all who wish to rest, and a slave for all who want a slave.\" \nBeside her, on the second scroll is MAHAKALA.  He is the fierce representation of the Buddha of Compassion.  Crows fly in the clouds to the left of the terrifying, black, six- armed figure. \nA skull rosary is held in the upper right arm, a Trident is held in the left hand.  The deity wears a crown of five skulls.  He has three eyes.  He tramples an elephant. \nWe might have been in a dream, as the camera finally moves back to find the peaceful1 protected face of the young Dalai Lama.  Asleep. \nThe camera moves across the mural devoted to the story of the Fifth Dalai Lama.  It is a fantasy of green, with mountains and lakes and deities and monsters. \nWe find the statue of Seventh Dalai Lama, sitting on his golden cushion, and we look, deep into the eyes of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama.  Fantastic.  Deeper.  Deeper. \nTENZIN GYATSO \"May I be wishing jewel, a magic vase... \nVIEW THROUGH AN EYEPIECE \nWe see the Dalai Lama place his young eye at the viewfinder. \nEXT.  TERRACE, POTALA  DAY \nNorbu Thundrup holds the boy steady. \nAnd, a wondorous view of Lhasa is presented. \n", "test2_input": "EXT.  NORBULINKA  DAY \nThe young Tenzin Gyatso bursts through the gate in the Yellow Wall and runs across the beautiful garden to his parents's home. \nINT.  PARENTS'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY \nA family gathering meets the boy's eye when he enters. \nThere is his Mother, his oldest sister, Tsering Dolma, Lobsang Samten, a younger sister, Pema, baby brother Tendzin Chuta, and his oldest brother, Takster. \nWe don't recognize these faces, of course, but the gathering is obviously familial. \nOnly the boy's Father is missing. \nTenzin Gyatso goes to his Mother and lays his head in her lap. \nOn an altar behind her, is a silver frame.  In the frame is a picture of her husband. \nDREAM SEQUENCE \nEXT.  HILLTOP  DAWN \nThe body of the Dalai Lama's Father lays on a flat boulder. \nIncense smoke curls into the air.  Prayer wheels are turned, hand drums are played - the burial men stand off to one side, their hatchets and knives in view. \nTenzin Gyatso is present.  He is the boy we know, but beside him stands the four year-old boy, Lhamo, from the beginning of the movie, and on the other side of him stands the boy who will play the Dalai Lama in the next section of the film -  a boy about fifteen or sixteen. \nTenzin Gyatso wraps his brown rosary around his left wrist. The beads catch the brilliant afternoon light.  The sixteen year-old Dalai Lama wears the same colored rosary around his left wrist. \nThe cutters move in to the corpse, and as we hear them begin the work of dismembering the body, the view pans up to reveal the vultures circling overhead. \nThe last person leaving the hilltop with is the Dalai Lama as an older man - not a character from this movie - but a man of about fifty years, wearing glasses, wearing the same robes, the same rosary.  Little Lhamo walks beside him. \nEND DREAM SEQUENCE \nEXT.  SKY OVER TIBET  NIGHT \nWe hear a loud explosion, and then another and another and another.  The sound begins to fade, but the blue-black, peaceful, star-filled sky is shattered by bright bursts of red and yellow and pink light. \nIt is a frightening sight. \nEXT.  GARDEN, NORBULINKA  DAWN (1950) \nThe still waters of the fish pond begin to move.  The fish swim in nervous circles;  the water laps over its stone banks. \nEXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE  DAWN \nThe whole building shakes.  Earthquake. \nOne monk runs down the stairs, another monk runs up, both staring at a second floor window - a black-rimmed, glass window. \nA red cloth is pulled back and the window is opened. \nThe fifteen year-old Tenzin Gyatso looks out. \nThere is a terrible rumbling:  the rumbling that accompanies an earthquake.  Finally, slowly, the sound, and the movement subsides. \nCLOSE on Tenzin Gyatso.  He lets the curtain fall. \nINT.  GREAT HALL, THE POTALA  DAY \nThe General Assembly is in session. \nOnce again, the Yigstang and the Tsitang - four monks and four laymen - sit facing one another.  But the room is crowded today - this is a full session.  The Lord chamberlain sits in.  Regent Taktra is there. \nThe senior Layman is on his knees. \nLAYMAN The Communist have control of China. \nIn the back of the room we notice an open door. \nINT.  HALLWAY  DAY \nThe Dalai Lama is listening.  He stands taller than the first time we caught him eavesdropping.  He still is not a part of this assembly, but he doesn't seem to care if he is spotted. \nINT.  GREAT HALL  DAY \nThe Layman continues. \nLAYMAN Now, as his great army, stands idle on our borders, Chairman Mao has presented Tibet with three demands: \nOne, Tibet must accept that it is part of China. \nA murmuring in the room. \nINT.  HALLWAY  DAY \n", "test2_true": "LAYMAN (OC) Two, Tibet's defenses must be handled by China. Three, all political and trade matters concerning foreign countries must be conducted through China. \nA voice shouts out: \nVOICE IN BACK OF ROOM (OC) Give the Dalai Lama his majority! \nINT.  GREAT HALL  DAY \nThe senior Monk is on his knees. \nMONK We can concede that Tibet is a part of China if we can guarantee that the Dalai Lama's name and authority will remain... \nLAYMAN And do you believe that the Tibetan government will be allowed to continue to function as it is? Do you believe that our religion will be protected? \nVOICES Give the Dalai Lama his majority! \nMONK We have dealt with this Chinese obsession for hundreds of years. We can deal with it now. \nLAYMAN These are not the Chinese we know. These are Communists. \nVOICES Make him Dalai Lama now! \nWe see the Lord Chamberlain look toward the open door. \nINT.  HALLWAY  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso looks at his advisor, and then, he closes the door as the demand for his enthronement continues. \nHe walks down the hall, past the door leading to the treasure room, alone now - an adult.  He is wearing those European, lace-up shoes found in the treasure room so long ago.  They are still too big for him. \nEXT.  TRIBUTARY OF THE KYICHU RIVER, NORBULINKA  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso and Taktra Rinpoche walk side by side along the waterway. \nTENZIN GYATSO If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost. \nTAKTRA RINPOCHE What would you do, Holiness? \nThe boy looks out over the water. \nShepherds are leading their flock of sheep back toward town on the far side of the tributary. \nThe two men stand side by side, one so young, one seeming so old. \nTENZIN GYATSO What should I do about my doubt, Teacher? \nTAKTRA RINPOCHE It is a difficult situation. \nTENZIN GYATSO I mean, my doubt.  Why me? Am I Him? \nTAKTRA RINPOCHE Doubt is an affliction.  Reliquish it.  Accept. \nPause. \nTENZIN GYATSO I believe we must make no concesions to the Chinese.  But, I am one voice. The Dalai Lama has always trusted in the forces of Buddha.  Let us consult the protective deities. \nTaktra Rinpoche bows and leaves him. \nTenzin Gyatso stands alone by the river.  The boy watches the herders, and before the young shepherds disappear from sight, the Dalai Lama turns and waves a hand behind him. \nTwo Bodyguards approach.  We can not hear, but as the Dalai Lama walks away from us, down the river, one Bodyguard runs up river, shouting: \nBODYGUARD (shouting) We will buy them!  We will buy them! \nINT.  ALTAR ROOM, NORBULINKA  DAY \nIn this black room, under the protective view of the statue of Mahakala, a divine lottery is performed. \nTenzin Gyatso, the Regent Taktra Rinpoche, The Lord chamberlain, the Kashag, the Yigstang and the Tsitang are all present. \nTsampa-dough balls are made, three of them, each containing a strip of parchment, bearing writing.  The dough is shaped and weighed to see that each ball is equal. \nThen, the three balls are placed in a silver bowl and the bowl is spun.  The balls whirl, race, and finally one leaps from the bowl. \nThis ball is taken to the Dalai Lama and he makes a mark on it.  The ball is returned to the bowl, the procedure is repeated, and a ball leaps again, almost immediately.  This ball is presented and the Dalai Lama places his mark - next to the mark he just made.  It is the same ball. \nTenzin Gyatso makes the twelfth mark on the same ball, and the spinning begins again and then the thirteenth mark, and then the ball is broken open and the strip of parchment handed to the Regent. \nTAKTRA RINPOCHE We should not accept any conditions from the Chinese. \nEXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY \nIn a paved area, adjacent to the Yellow Wall which marks the Dalai Lama's private grounds, the Opera Festival has begun. \nThis festival involves performances by Tibetan singers, dancers and actors.  It looks to be a joyous occasion; officials and their wives are dressed in their finest and sit before beautifully laid picnics.  Children run here and there, amidst the monks and nomads, the swashbuckling Khambas from eastern Tibet (large people, with heavy braids wrapped in red cloth on top of their heads).  There are westerners, Nepalese and Sikimese. \nDancers - dressed in wild, colorful outfits - spin and leap in time to the eerie, Tibetan music. \n", "test3_input": "WOMEN (OC) Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! \nEXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE, NORBULINKA  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso steps outside.  The shouting grows louder: \nWOMEN AND MEN (OC) Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! \nThe young man looks around at the peaceful premises.  People we know - uembers of the Kashag, attendants, tutors, the Dalai Lama's Mother, sweepers - appear in the garden, one by one, all listening to the sounds of a uob gathering outside the walls of the Norbulinka. \nWOMEN AND HEN (OC) Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA  DAY \nA meeting is in progress. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home. \nTENZIN GYATSO I will not go. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN I will alert the Chinese delegation. \nYou know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun. \nINT.  PARENTS'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY \nThe Dalai Lama enters his Mother's home. \nIt is very guiet here.  The young man looks at the family photographs on the blue walls, the needlework on the table, the seven copper bowls in front of the statue of Buddha. \nMOTHER (OC) Did you come to tell me we are leaving Lhasa? \nThe boy fills the seven bowls with water.  His Mother lights the butter lamps. \nTENZIN GYATSO Do you think I must? \nMOTHER You decide. \nHe says, softly: \nTENZIN GYATSO Tibet has never been part of China.  We are different races. We are different cultures. We need change, we know that. But we could do it alone. We were just about to do it alone. \nThe young man fills the last bowl with water. \nTENZIN GYATSO I am afraid I will go. Far, far away. \nEXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DUSK \nThe Lord Chamberlain approaches the Dalai Lama as he leaves his Mother's house. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN We are now accused of aiding the rebels.  The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt. \nTENZIN GYATSO Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders. \nThe Lord Chamberlain hurries away. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DUSK \nA last meeting in session. \nThe Kashag is present, as are fifty leaders of the opposition - rough, tired men. \nTENZIN GYATSO I fear that there will be great bloodshed if you cannot convince the people to disperse and go home. I am safe. \nFIRST LEADER Holiness, the Chinese tried to entice you to their garrison with out protection of bodyguard. Even now, they urge you to come to them for safety. They are bringing more troops and guns and artillery into Lhasa. There are three airplanes waiting outside Lhasa. What do they wait for?  They are planning to kill the Dalai Lama.  Don't you see? \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT \nThe Dalai Lama consults the Nechung Oracle.  Alone. \nThe Oracle whispers: \nNECHUNG ORACLE Stay. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT \nIt is late at night.  The boy is alone.  He sits in front of his altar - meditating. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT \nThe Nechung Oracle is brought in.  The monk quiets himself and readies himself for the trance. \nThe Dalai Lama waits.  Again, alone. \nSlowly, the trance comes on, the heavy headdress is placed on the monk's head, the attendants leave the room and then, the Oracle speaks. \nNECHUNG ORACLE Stay.  I tell you to stay. \n", "test3_true": "The Lord Chamberlain hurries up the stairs. \nTenzin Gyatso steps forward, out of the shadows. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN The Chinese are planning to attack the crowd and shell the Norbulinka. You are asked to indicate on a map where you will be so that the artillery men will not mistakenly aim at you. \nThe Dalai Lama walks down the outdoor stairs. \nTENZIN GYATSO Tell them I will be here. With my people. Right here. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DAY \nThe young man is studying with Ling Rinpoche. Books of scripture are stacked in front of him. \nSuddenly, there is a tremendous, loud explosion, and then, another. \nTenzin Gyatso gets up and runs to the window he looked out of the day of the earthquake. \nEXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY \nThere is shouting and chaos.  The Chinese have begun shelling the Norbulinka.  The north wall and the grounds directly in front of it are on fire. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S ROOM  DAY \nThis time the Oracle is in the room first.  He is surrounded by his attendants and the members of the Kashag, the Lord Chamberlain, Ling Rinpoche and various tutors and lamas. \nThe tension is thick.  Finally, the Dalai Lama enters. \nTenzin Gyatso sits.  He waits.  The trance begins, the headdress is set upon the medium's head and the Oracle begins to dance, and then, he begins to shout: \nORACLE Go!  Go!  Tonight! \nThe Oracle staggers forward, snatches up some paper and a pen and begins to draw a map, a route, out of Lhasa.  He keeps repeating: \nORACLE Go!  Tonight!  Go! \nCLOSE on the map - drawn with a shaking, sweating hand. \nWe see mountains, and a pass, and the names of towns along the way. \nTenzin Gyatso rises and goes to the Oracle.  He looks down at the map.  The Oracle hands the Dalai Lama the map and faints as his frightened attendants rush to loosen the strap of the headdress before the poor man chokes. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DUSK \nThe boy sits at the table, writing.  We can hear the crowd, shouting, outside the Norbulinka walls.  We see just a few words of the letter: \nPlease do not resist. \nTake refuge on the far side of the river. \nAttendants pack, quietly and quickly. \nINT.  ALTAR ROOM  NIGHT \nThe chapel of Mahakala. \nWe are reminded of secret, sacred moments, from long ago. \nTenzin Gyatso opens the heavy, creaking door.  The Dalai Lama is in disguise.  He is wearing the clothes of a Khamba guerrilla - dark, woolen chuba and tall black boots. \nMonks sit on the floor, chanting.  One monk stands by a large urn, ladling out butter for the lamps. \nTenzin Gyatso goes to the front of the room. \nA monk begins to play the cymbals. Another puts the Tibetan horn to his lips and blows a long, mournful note. \nThe Dalai Lama lays a white silk scarf - a kata - over the shoulders of this imposing statue. \nThen, he sits for a moment. \nIn the weak light, in the black room, Tenzin Gyatso is lost among the other praying monks. \nEXT.  HALLWAY OF RESIDENCE  NIGHT \nThe Dalai Lama walks down the hall.  He says to a sweeper: \nTENZIN GYATSO Dim the lights. \nand then he bow bends down, to pat a dog. \nINT.

{"test1_input": "Lhamo makes a dive for the tent's door. \nEXT. TENT  NIGHT \nStanding outside the tent is a BODYGUARD - a huge, burly man, wearing monk's robes.  He turns to the boy.  In one hand he holds a big stick.  His face is distorted and deformed by a large tumor under one eye.  It is a frightening sight.  He looks like a monster to the child. \nLhamo jumps back inside the tent.  The Bodyguard closes the appliqued flap. \nINT.  DRELJAM  DAY \nLhamo has had a haircut.  His Mother walks beside the carriage, holding his hand. \nLHAMO Who am I? \nMOTHER We do not know. \nEXT. PLAINS OF TIBET  NIGHT \nBy candlelight, Lhamo is transferred from the rugged, simple carriage, to one of exquisite, yellow silk. \nINT. PALANQUIN  JUST BEFORE DAWN \nLhamo peeks out of the silk curtain as he hears the arrival of many horses, many men.  SOLDIERS - hundreds of Tibetan soldiers - surround the palanquin. \nEXT.  PLAINS, OUTSIDE LHASA  DAWN \nThe yellow palanquin is carried across a human border of Tibetan noblemen.  These fantastic-looking men and women part, and drop to the ground in prostration, as the palanquin moves through their welcoming committee. \nINT. PEACOCK TENT  DAWN \nLhamo walks along a long, patterned carpet, looking up, at this lofty tent's stunning, blue silk, ceiling. \nHe is led to a tall, wooden throne, and he is lifted, and then he climbs to the top.  Lhamo settles in a cross-legged position on the brocade cushion. \nHe looks down. \nHundred of monks, abbots, noblemen, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Chinese, even a red-headed Englishman - they all bow to Lhamo. \nReting Rinpoche, the young Regent of Tibet, the man who saw this boy's face in his vision, stands below the throne.  He addresses the crowd: \nRETING RINPOCHE Chenrezi, the Buddha of compassion. The Wish Fulfilling Jewel. The Fourteenth Dalai Lama. \nAnd the Regent turns, hikes up his gorgeous robes, and prostrates before the child. \nRETING RINPOCHE Long life. \nIn the crowd stand Lhamo's Mother and Father and Lobsang Samten. \nOn their faces, we must see that they did not realize who their son, their brother, was believed to be. \nFirst the Mother, and then the Father, bow in front of their youngest child. \nMOTHER Long life. \nFATHER Long life. \nFinally, Lobsang. \nLOBSANG Long life, Lhamo. \nWe hear the sound of a great, Tibetan horn. \nWe hear peels of childish laughter. \nINT.  THE POTALA  DAY \nLobsang and Lhamo skid, slide, skate down the endless, slippery hallways of this huge, labyrinthine monastery. \nThree Monks scurry behind the boys, trying to keep up, trying to keep the young incarnate from slipping out of their sight. \nThey shout, in loud stage whispers: \nMONKS Kundun!  Kundun! \nThe monks are no match for the little boys, who are quickly out of sight. \nINT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  THE POTALA  DAY \nReting Rinpoche sits cross-legged on the floor of this brightly-painted, red room. \nAcross from him sits Lhamo, dressed in fine, yellow silk. \nThese are simple rooms, decorated with statues, deity scrolls and mandalas, an altar to Buddha.  Behind a glass case are toys, mixed in with the Buddhist artifacts:  dolls, puppets, balls, blocks, trains. \nReting Rinpoche is speaking. \nRETING RINPOCHE Centuries ago, a young boy was born.  His name was Gedundrub. The night of his birth, robbers came to his home and his family fled hiding the baby in a cattle pen. When they returned the next day, the baby was safe. They found him guarded by a pair of black crows. \n", "test1_true": "The Living Buddha of Compassion. \nNow, you have chosen to come back to this life once again. \nReting blows his nose. \nRETING RINPOCHE We name you Tenzin Gyatso. \nCLOSE on Lhamo - Tenzin Gyatso. \nRETING RINPOCHE Your job is simple. You are to love all living things. Just love them.  Care for them. Have compassion for them. \n\"As long as any living thing draws breath, wherever he shall be, there in compassion, shall the Buddha appear, incarnate.\" \nAt the curtain behind Lhamo, we notice the curly-toed shoes of a monk, a man who must be standing in the next room. \nINT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DAY \nIn the room immediately adjacent to this bedroom, we now see the three Monks who chased the young boy down the slippery halls. \nThey are the Dalai Lama's personal attendants - the MASTER OF THE RITUAL, the MASTER OF ThE KITCHEN, and the MASTER OF THE ROBE.  (It is the Master of the Kitchen who stands directly behind the curtain.) \nThe LORD CHAMBERLAIN is also there.  He is a monk.  A tall, angular man, with almost nordic features:  large, round eyes, a yellowish mustache, sharp nose. \nAll of these men will become quite familiar to us, as will the man standing, listening, behind the attendants. \nHe is a sweeper, a man named NORBU THUNDRUP, age thirty.  He is tall, and gangly, with a wispy beard and a pock-marked face. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM  DAY \nRETING RINPOCHE You will be the leader of the Tibetan people when you come of age.  Until that time, I will be your teacher, and as your Regent, I will rule in your name. \nI will tell your Lord Chamberlain you are ready to see him. \nINT.  ADJACENT ROOM  DAY \nThe Regent walks through this room on his way out. A passing look from Norbu lets us know that Reting Rinpoche is not well-liked. \nRETING RINPOCHE He will see you now. \nThe Lord Chamberlain goes to meet with the Dalai Lama. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM  DAY \nThe Lord Chamberlain bows to the boy and then unpacks his parcel. \nHe has a rolled, parchment document. He has a beautiful, carved, wooden box. \nThe Lord Chamberlain points to the mural on the wall behind the boy.  It is an elaborate, story-painting. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Fifth Dalai Lama. \nThe boy looks. \nThe Lord Chamberlain points to a golden statue of a round man in a peaked hat. \nLORD CHAMBBERLAIN Seventh Dalai Lama. \nTenzin Gyatso nods. \nThe Lord Chamberlain lifts a framed photograph of a bald, charismatic man, with razor sharp eyebrows, pictured sitting on a throne. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Thirteenth Dalai Lama. \nThe boy looks at the photo. \nThe Lord Chamberlain places the state seal in the young boy's hands and indicates that the boy should bring the heavy instrument down hard on the parchment. \nThe boy does.  The Lord Chamberlain scribbles a little something on a tab of attached paper, then bows to the boy. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Fourteenth Dalai Lama. \nVIEW FROM A HIGH WINDOW \nOutside, up a country path, young herders lead their cattle in from the grazing fields.  We can hear the boys singing - a Tibetan street song. \nTENZIN GYATSO (OC) I am the good one. You be bad. The bad man. \nINT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM  DUSK \nThe view comes in the window and reveals the young Dalai Lama, sitting on the floor with Norbu Thundrup, the sweeper. Tenzin Gyatso has arranged a battlefield of soldiers - little men, made of colored-dough. \nNORBU THUNDRUP My name is Norbu, Holiness.  I will be good, you be bad. \nTenzin Gyatso is ferocious in his strategy, taking Norbu's men. \nTENZIN GYATSO I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men. And after the game, we're going to trade.  You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land.  I take it. I am stronger. \n", "test1_id": 945, "test2_input": "NORBU THUNDRUP I am braver. \nNorbu Thundrup plays like a child.  It is a fight to the finish. \nTENZIN GYATSO I have more men. \nNORBU ThUNDRUP I have smarter men. \nTenzin Gyatso has lost;  he dissolves into tears. \nNORBU THUNDRUP Today you lose.  Tomorrow you may win. \nNorbu snaps his fingers. \nNORBU THUNDRUP Things change, Kundun. \nTENZIN GYATSO Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this. \nTenzin touches the soft, bald, chin of Norbu. \nTENZIN GYATSO Soft. \nAnd then, Tenzin Gyatso tries to snap his fingers.  He cannot. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DUSK \nTenzin Gyatso stands at the window, watching, listening. His hands knead the colored dough into balls, ready to create the next army, the future battleground, as he recites, softly: \nTENZIN GYATSO \"As long as all living draw breaths, there Buddha is.\" \nNorbu Thundrup smiles as he polishes the floor, clearing it of tsampa dough. \nINT.  GREAT HALL, THE POTALA  DAY \nThe Great Hall in the Potala is the seat of Tibetan Government. \nThese palace walls are hung with beautiful, old thangkas (silk embroideries or paintings),  depicting the life of Buddha. \nInside the hall sits the acting government:  the YIGSTANG and the TSITANG - four monks, four laymen - all dressed in their appropriate simplicity and elaborateness.  These men sit in two rows, facing one another.  The senior monk and the senior layman sit a bit forward. They are the speakers. \nThe senior LAYMAN is on his knees, speaking. \nLAYMAN I believe that the Regent is asking for too high a reward for his part in finding the Dalai Lama.  Too much money, too much land. \nINT.  HALLWAY  DAY \nTenzin Gyatso peeks through a door at the great assembly. \nThe Lord Chamberlian stands behind him. \nINT. GREAT HALL  DAY \nThe Layman continues. \nLAYMAN Our treasuries are empty.  Our army is depleted.  He would have us pull the hair from our noses. \nINT.  HALLWAY  DAY \nThe Dalai Lama is confused, but continues listening. \nINT.  GREAT HALL  DAY \nThe Layman returns to his cross-legged position. \nThe senior MONK speaks. \nMONK We note this.  Now, the Chinese. \nThere is audible expression of tension. \nMONK The Allies wish to build a supply- road from India, crossing Tibet, as part of their war effort.  The road would lead directly to China. \nThe Layman gets to his knees. \nLAYMAN We cannot allow it. Right now, we have a only a small Chinese mission in Lhasa, the first since the Thirteenth Dalai Lama threw them out in 1912. The road would increase the size of that mission. The Chinese would try to control our trade, as they did once before, control our contact with the outside world. \nINT.  HALLWAY  DAY \nThe Lord Chamberlain touches the boy's shoulder and Tenzin Gyatso leaves his hiding place, as the speaker's voice fades away. \nAs the two walk down the hallway, Tenzin Gyatso spots an unusual wooden door.  He lets the Lord Chamberlain get a little bit ahead of him, and then the boy tries the door. It is heavy.  It almost opens. \nINT.  HALLWAY  LATER, DUSK \nTenzin Gyatso and his brother Lobsang are pulling at the heavy door.  Behind them, in the distance, we hear: \nMONKS (OC) Kundun!  Kundun! \n", "test2_true": "INT.  STORAGE ROOM  DUSK \nA treasure awaits them. \nIt looks like Aladdin's cave - full of odd, European items. \nThere are glittering music boxes, a porcelain sink, a gilded mirror, a lacquered rocking horse.  There are hats, umbrellas and even a pair of lace-up, cordovan shoes. Tenzin Gyatso lifts a reel of film.  There are piles of magazines and books.  There is a stack of tires in the back corner.  The boys uncover a train set and a good collection of lead soldiers.  The Dalai Lama pockets a gold watch. \nJust as the monks find their young charges and we hear them at the door, Tenzin sees something truly spectacular.  It is a telescope. \nThe monks enter the room as the young Dalai Lama reaches for this miracle. \nTENZIN GYATSO What is it? \nTHE ATTENDANTS Ah, it is a telescope, Holiness. With this you can see a long way. \nTENZIN GYATSO And, is it mine? \nATTENDANT These are all gifts sent to your predecessors. \nLOBSANG SAMTEN Yes!  Then it is yours! \nTENZIN GYATSO I need it. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT \nWe are in the adjacent room, listening, as Norbu Thundrup tells a bedtime story. \nGolden butter lamps burn before a statue of Buddha. \nNORBU THUNDRUP (OC) One night, not too long ago, an old monk saw a woman in that very same hallway where you ran away. \nINT.  BEDROOM  NIGHT \nThe boy is in bed.  The Sweeper finishes-off his story as the boy wiggles deeper under the covers. \nNORBU THUNDRUP She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had.  Heads.  Human heads. Only the heads. \nTENZIN GYATSO Is that true or pretend? \nNORBU THUNDRUP It is a story, you decide. \nTENZIN GYATSO Pretend. \nNORBU THUNDRUP As you say. \nThe Sweeper tucks the boy in as the Master of the Robe finishes his nightly preparations and with a pat and a smile, the two men leave the room. \nA mouse steals a bit of tsampa from the offerings placed on the altar before the Buddha. \nTenzin Gyatso peeks out from under his covers and looks to see if those curly-toed shoes are visible under the partition.  They are.  The Master of the Kitchen is still near. \nTenzin Gyatso pulls the golden pocket watch from under the covers.  He pries and digs at the back of the watch until he succeeds in popping it open, revealing its miraculous insides. \nFinally, Tenzin Gyatso's eyelids grow heavy.  The camera passes over his face, as his eyes close. \nThe boy begins to speak, mumble, as he falls asleep: \nTENZIN GYATSO \"I be an island for those who seek one, a lamp for light.\" \nWe find two scrolls;  the first is PENDEN LHAMO, the special protectress of the Dalai Lama. \nShe rides her wild mule through a sea of blood - between rows of jagged mountains.  Pointed fingers and spreading toes, her hair gone crazy, her fangs revealed - the details are incredible.  A garland of freshly severed heads hangs around her body, snakes hold up her skirt, five skulls form ber crown. \nTENZIN GYATSO (VO) \"May I be a bed for all who wish to rest, and a slave for all who want a slave.\" \nBeside her, on the second scroll is MAHAKALA.  He is the fierce representation of the Buddha of Compassion.  Crows fly in the clouds to the left of the terrifying, black, six- armed figure. \nA skull rosary is held in the upper right arm, a Trident is held in the left hand.  The deity wears a crown of five skulls.  He has three eyes.  He tramples an elephant. \nWe might have been in a dream, as the camera finally moves back to find the peaceful1 protected face of the young Dalai Lama.  Asleep. \nThe camera moves across the mural devoted to the story of the Fifth Dalai Lama.  It is a fantasy of green, with mountains and lakes and deities and monsters. \nWe find the statue of Seventh Dalai Lama, sitting on his golden cushion, and we look, deep into the eyes of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama.  Fantastic.  Deeper.  Deeper. \nTENZIN GYATSO \"May I be wishing jewel, a magic vase... \nVIEW THROUGH AN EYEPIECE \nWe see the Dalai Lama place his young eye at the viewfinder. \nEXT.  TERRACE, POTALA  DAY \nNorbu Thundrup holds the boy steady. \nAnd, a wondorous view of Lhasa is presented. \n", "test2_id": 946, "test3_input": "LORD CHAMBERLAIN The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession.  I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight. \nThe Dalai Lama rubs his face with his hands. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Land reform is underway in Amdo.  The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished. \nTENZIN GYATSO A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese. \nThe men are silent.  We hear the constant sound of trucks and cars. \nThe Lord Chamberlain is notably pausing. \nTENZIN GYATSO I have always asked for plain information.  Just the truth. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham.  It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes. \nAgain, silence. \nTENZIN GYATSO The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible.  Resistance, when it is not. \nEXT.  TERRACE  DAY \nHis Holiness walks to the terrace.  He aims the telescope. \nBelow him he sees a new Lhasa - a Lhasa full of trucks and Chinese soldiers.  A traffic island stands in the center of an intersection.  The town walls are white-washed.  The political posters are gone. \nINT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE NORBULINKA DAY \nA small group sits waiting on red velvet chairs: the Dalai Lama, the Lord Chamberlain and the Kashag. \nGeneral Chiang enters the room. He finds a chair and pours himself a cup of tea.  We cannot help but notice - he is armed. \nGENERAL CHIANG We have decided that no drastic changes will take place in Tibet for six years. This should make you happy. \nSilence. \nGENERAL CHIANG It seems a revolt has broken out in the east. We have decided that the Tibetan army must be used against the Khamba guerrillas. \nThe General sips. \nThe Dalai Lama answers. \nTENZIN GYATSO I will not approve it. \nThe General looks up, surprised.  It took a great deal of courage for the young man to answer back, so determinedly. \nTENZIN GYATSO You have bombed on peaceful people. \nGENERAL CHIANG We must deal with these reactionaries! \nTENZIN GYATSO No.  We are peace loving people. I am afraid we cannot trust you. \nThe General sputters: \nGENERAL CHIANG We are here to heal the people of Tibet.  You need reform. You have no sense of what is good for your people. We are here to liberate you! \nNow, the boy finds his voice. \nTENZIN GYATSO I burn here, but I am not suppose to let the smoke show.  Yes, we need reform.  The monasteries. Communications.  Schools.  But we want change for Tibet, as Tibet needs it, not for China. \nThe General starts to speak but Tenzin Gyatso keeps talking. \nTENZIN GYATSO Buddha is our physician, General, he will heal us.  Comapssion and enlightnement will set us free. You can not liberate me I can only liberate myself. \nThe General leaves the room. \nLORD CHAMBERLAIN They will take Lhasa next. \nTENZIN GYATSO The people will not allow it. \nINT.  PRAYER ROOM, NORBULINKA  NIGHT \nThe Nechung Oracle is in full swing.  It is an especially vivid and violent spin he is in.  The headdress whips this way and that, and finally he says: \nNECHUNG ORACLE Where there is no crossing a big river, no fords, no shallows, where the only hope is a boat, and there is no boat... I will put a boat, Kundun. \nThe wish-Fulfilling Jewel will shine from the West. \nIt is a strange and confusing prophecy. \nEXT./ INT.  NORBULINKA  DAY \nA few random views of the Norbulinka: \nThe wandering deer and peacocks.  The fish pond and its inhabitants. \n", "test3_true": "TENZIN GYATSO (OC) \"I rejoice in the Awakening of the Buddhas, and also in the spiritual levels of their Sons.\" \nThe projection room.  The full sheep pen.

The Dalai Lama's red room. \nTENZIN GYATSO (OC) \"As well as in the deeds that bring them benefit. \nAnd now, we hear the voices of a great many people, reciting: \nTENZIN GYATSO AND OTHERS (OC) \"With folded hands I beseech the Buddhas of all directions. To shine the lamp of Dharma For all bewildered in the gloom of misery.\" \nEXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY \nIn the midst of war, there is beauty. \nThe Dalai Lama performs the Kalachakra ceremony. \nIt is a beautiful, ornate, colorful ceremony.  A prayer for world peace. \nTenzin Gyatso sits on a platform of cushions, above the heads of the abbots and lamas and tutors, above the heads of the Tibetan noblemen, and nomads and Khambas and pesants from all corners of the land who attend the ceremony. \nTENZIN GYATSO AND OTHERS \"With folded hands I beseech the Conquerors who wish to pass away, to please remain for countless aeons And not to leave the world in darkness.\" \nThe Dalai Lama proceeds with the ceremony.  He handles and blesses sacred objects, he lifts his bell and dorge. \nRice is passed among the people.  Rice is thrown. \nA Tibetan chant is sung. \nBeside His Holiness is a large, yellow silk pagoda. \nThe view moves inside the pagoda as the chanting continues. \nINT.  PAGODA  DAY \nWe see a mandala - a beautiful, intricate, sand-painting. \nThe home of Kalachakra. \nTENZIN GYATSO (OC) \"Thus by the virtue collected Through all that I have done, May the pain of every living creature be completely cleared away.\" \nThe whole screen becomes this mandala as the chanting an cymbals and deep resonating sounds of the song continue and then, a hand comes into the mandala and begins to sweep it up. \nPull back to see that the hand belongs to Tenzin Gyatso. \nTenzin Gyatso collects the ground particles of Tibetan quartz and rock.  He destroys the painstakingly lovely sand painting. \nThe chanting becomes louder and louder and it mixes with the sound of the river. \nEXT.  KYICHU RIVER  DUSK \nTenzin Gyatso pours the sand into the river. \nWe watch the river take color and the mandala floats away. \nThis view is overlapped by one of extreme horror. \nDREAM SEQUENCE \nThe lovely Norbulinka garden, the park where opera pageants and Kalachakra ceremonies take place, is now, a killing field. \nHundreds of dead, slaughtered monks, lie on the blood- drenched ground, under the peach and pear trees.  Chinese soldiers move amongst the monks, turning over the dead bodies, searching those silent faces.  The Solder we see is carrying a photo of His Holiness.  They are searching for the Dalai Lama. \nIt is a nightmare. \nWe hear crying. \nDREAM SEQUENCE ENDS. \nTenzin Gyatso wakes up.  Shaking, crying, he is alone, in the dark.  He can barely catch his breath. \nThe screen goes black. \nCLOSE on an invitation: \nHis Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet, is invited to attend a Dance Recital at the newly erected, Great Hall of the Liberation Army. \n10 March, 1959. \nEXT.

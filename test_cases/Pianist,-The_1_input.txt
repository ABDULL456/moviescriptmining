Two rooms on the third floor: a living room and a kitchen. The Szpilmans are unpacking their belongings in silence. Father pauses for a moment to take stock. 
FATHER To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse. 
SZPILMAN How will we sleep? 
MOTHER I'll sleep with the girls in the kitchen. You, Henrykc and Papa in here. 
HALINA (at a window) Look! Come and look! 
They all go to the window and look out. 
Their POV - the street. 
Further along, men are building a wall across the street. 
EXT. GHETTO WALL - DAY 
A SERIES OF SHOTS: 
THE WALL. THE WALL. THE WALL. 
EXT. MARKET AREA, GHETTO - DAY 
Winter. Cold, freezing day. Slush underfoot. Great activity. People selling shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, food. A woman offers cakes under a barbed-wire cover. Noise, bustle, restless wing and froing. 
Among the traders, Henryk, slightly shabbier now, and at his feet a basket with books. He holds a couple of volumes in his hands, trying to interest passers-by. 
Szpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers-by, and reaches Henryk. 
Henryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle one side of the basket, Szpilman the other. They set off. 
As they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing beggars and children asking for food: 
SZPILMAN You sell anything? 
HENRYK Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys. 
SZPILMAN That's better than yesterday. 
HENRYK Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions. 
SZPILMAN I know. 
HENRYK You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn. 
Suddenly, a WOMAN appears in front of them, barring their way. She's brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows, dressed in an old green velvet curtain with an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. 
THE FEATHER WOMAN Excuse me, but have you by any chance seen my husband Izaak Szerman? 
SZPILMAN I'm afraid not. 
THE FEATHER WOMAN A tall handsome man with a little grey beard? 
They shake their heads. 
THE FEATHER WOMAN No? (she is near to tears, then smiles artificially.) Oh, do forgive me. (as she goes) Goodbye, sleep well, if you see him, please do write, Izaak Szerman's his name... 
She wanders on. Szpilman and Henryk, too, continue on their way. And as they go: 
HENRYK Sometimes I wish I could go mad. 
EXT. CHLODNA STREET - DAY 
A stream of cars and trams. Jewish policemen and German soldiers much in evidence. 
Szpilman and Henryk join a large crowd of Jews waiting at a barrier to cross the intersection. The crowd is agitated, impatient for a policeman to stop the traffic and let them through. 
A MAN next to Szpilman and Henryk is becoming more and more distraught, shifting his weight from foot to foot, taking off and putting on his hat. 
THE NERVOUS MAN This is totally insane; why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area? Can't they go around? 
HENRYK Don't worry about it, they're about to build a bridge, haven't you heard? 
THE NERVOUS MAN A bridge, a schmidge, and the Germans claim to be intelligent. You know what I think?  I think they're totally stupid. I've got a family to feed and I spend half my time here waiting for them to let us through. 
Meanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz. Jewish policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space, shoving Jews out of the way, including Szpilman, Henryk and the nervous man. Other soldiers are clearing a space.

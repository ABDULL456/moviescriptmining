Ippolito pulls out his walkie talkie. 
IPPOLITO D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in. 
D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO) (a string of curses followed by...) Where the hell are you? 
IPPOLITO I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight. 
D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO) It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge. 
A long moment as the men look at each other. 
WATERS Did he say monster? 
IPPOLITO Panic attack. 
INT. MUSEUM STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
D'Agosta's group has reached a lower floor.  Here this stairwell ends. Ahead stretches the hall of the Asian peoples. 
IPPOLITO (OS) D'Agosta, put on the Mayor. 
D'Agosta passes the walkie talkie to the Mayor. 
MAYOR Mayor Jordan here. 
IPPOLITO (ON RADIO) This is Ippolito, head of museum security.  Relieve D'Agosta and take command. 
MAYOR Don't tell me what to do you chicken shit bastard.  I saw you cut and run! Lieutenant D'Agosta stayed with us. He is in charge.  There is a monster. I saw it.  Cut through those doors and get us out of here, now! 
The Mayor shuts off the walkie talkie and they round another corner and disappear from sight. 
INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 
Ippolito finds Waters and the others staring at him.  Humiliated, he swallows hard. 
IPPOLITO All right.  The steel doors are designed to retard cutting.  We can go through them, but it would take hours. 
WATERS The quickest way in would be to go through the roof, sir.  Cell two goes up to the fifth floor.  There are sky lights up there. 
IPPOLITO Co-ordinate with the fire department and SWAT teams.  Move. 
INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT 
It's very dark.  The huge shape of MBWUN can barely be seen sliding out of the stairwell and into the Hall of the Asian Peoples.  Then DIM RED HALL LIGHTS come on in the corners of the ceiling.  The monster utters a low growl.  The emergency generators are beginning to come on.  The animal lopes to the spot where we last saw D'Agosta and his group, sniffs the ground.  It looks up and, with a curiously human gesture, cocks its massive head. 
The silence is broken by VOICES!  They're in the distance and muffled, but definitely there.  The monster crouches eagerly, lopes forward with great stealth.  The voices are getting louder.  We follow as it goes through the hall and down... 
A STAIRWELL... At the bottom, Mbwun quickly turns a corner... The voices have stopped.  Mbwun creeps forward, enters... 
INT. HALL OF MARINE ANIMALS - NIGHT 
A huge room several stories high.  A WHALE hangs suspended from the ceiling.  Dioramas of fish line all the walls.  Mbwun pauses next to a diorama of the gentle, vegetarian sea cow, THE MANATEE.  The two make a startling contrast. 
A pause and then the voices are heard again, much louder now.  The source is right around the edge of the Manatee display.  Mbwun LEAPS FORWARD, claws lashing out.  He turns the corner and crashes through a wall of GLASS as he grabs at the source of the voices... 
A display of small, extraordinarily life-like TALKING HOLOGRAMS! They've been re-activated with the emergency power system.  Each little talking figure is no more then five inches high.  They move around a small three dimensional display of marine animals, explaining the lung systems of fish. 
MBWUN... stands in the pile of broken glass, stares at the holograms, mesmerized.  He makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a CHUCKLE! Then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch one of the holograms.  But the shadowy creatures can't be caught.  The beast seems to realize this, SNORTS and moves off.  As he goes he passes behind a 
LARGE GLASS ELEVATOR.  It stands in middle the open room.  The elevator is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story exhibit.  In the dim light, with his poor vision, the monster doesn't see D'Agosta, the Mayor, Kawakita, and their entire group SANDWICHED INSIDE.  The monster exits the exhibit and quietly D'Agosta slides the doors open.  Everyone, all thirty-five people in evening clothes, quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell at the far side of the hall. 
INT. SECURE STORAGE AREA 1012 - NIGHT 
Margo, Frock and Pendergast wait in the darkness.  Pendergast, for the first time, seems fazed. 
PENDERGAST I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that. 
MARGO It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam. 
PENDERGAST But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense! 
FROCK (lame) We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate. 
PENDERGAST I don't believe it. 
MARGO None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.

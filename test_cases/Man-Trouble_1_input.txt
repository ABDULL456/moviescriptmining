HARRY Sure you can, it's just a matter of degree. 
JOAN Well darn it, I give up... Dropping her head into her hands. (CONTINUED)

JOAN I'm sorry but this is really getting to me. 
He sits down next to her: HARRY Tell you what. Let me take you out of here, buy you a drink, and               * see if we can't get your mind off these kind of things. JOAN That's very sweet of you, Harry. I'd like to do that.

37   INT. YAMASHIRO INN/PAVILION - LATE DAY                     37 (Japanese "MOOD MUSIC" over), featuring a morbid, nearly suicidal saxophone solo:) John and Harry seated at a table. She is well past the loosening effects of a second glass of wine, is not unaware that Harry is looking at her: 
He lights a cigarette. As she reaches to her glass, his eyes follow the motion of her hands. She looks in front the window: JOAN How long have you been divorced? HARRY Oh, I'd say seven or eight years, around there. 
JOAN And so you  like, well, assuming you live a  single existence, I                       * mean most  men don't seem to enjoy that, I've  read. She lifts her glass, takes a sip, then sets it back down: HARRY I have to  tell you the truth... (he  pauses) I've been  observing your hands, and I have to  use the word exquisite. JOAN Really?   Well... (CONTINUED)

HARRY You're probably quite a singer too. (looking back to her) I'd like to come down and catch you sometime. 
JOAN Yes, anytime. Do you like Classical music? 
HARRY Very much. Even to the degree that when it's playing on the radio, I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off. Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit, she laughs. HARRY (CONT'D) I just mean it starts to get to me too much. I can't swallow my saliva. JOAN I'm sorry.     I shouldn't have laughed. 
HARRY Yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things like that. All those type of things really get to me. JOAN (looking intensely at him) Uhm hmm. 
A JAPANESE HOSTESS appears at the table, bowing reveren-           * tially and gesturing that their table is ready.                    *

37A   CONTINUED:                                                   37A She is flushed from the wine and exhilarated by her response to Harry: 
JOAN You're full of surprises, Harry, you know that? That you've actually read Dante's Divine Comedy I mean... HARRY Well, it was a while back there that I did, yeah... JOAN You know that part? 'Yet as a wheel moves smoothly, free from jars, My will and my desire were turned by love, The love that moves the sun and other stars.' He nods, while Joan, hoping to disguise the extent of her emotions, looks down and begins moving her wine in circles: 
JOAN (CONT'D) For some reason, the sublimity of that always touches me.

37B   EXT. YAMASHIRO INN/FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT                  37B Joan and Harry come down the steps of the Inn. The sun has gone down and the lights of the city have come on. Under the following they cross the driveway to a low fence railing off an Oriental garden. JOAN You know, it's very sad. I look at my sister and all her marriages and affairs, not to mention the mess my own life is in, and I think it's very sad and very bleak that men and women can't manage to be friends. HARRY It depends on the man and woman you're talking about. They arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one of her hands on the railings: JOAN What a tragedy that sex is often such a barrier to friendship between men and women. HARRY There I disagree with you. 
He places his hand over hers. She remains silent a moment, restraining her response to the gesture. Then: JOAN You know Dante and Beatrice never slept together. HARRY Is that right? (catching himself) Oh yeah, I forgot that part. 
JOAN Well, anyway... I shouldn't have had so much wine... because I prefer to go a little slow here.

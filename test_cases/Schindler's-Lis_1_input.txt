Max admits it with a shrug. 
MAX REDLICHT I've done some things... but I won't do this. 
Silence. The Einsatz NCO glances away to the others, amused. 
EINSATZ NCO What does this mean? Of all of you, there's only one who has the guts to say no? One? And he doesn't even believe? (no one, of course answer him) I come in here, I ask you to do something no one should ever ask. And you do it? (pause) What won't you do? 
Nobody answers. He turns to Max. 
EINSATZ NCO You, sir, I respect. 
He pulls out a revolver and shoots the old gangster in the head. He's dead before he hits the floor. 
EINSATZ NCO The rest of you... ...are beneath his contempt. 
He turns and walks away. The other Einsatz Boys pull rifles and revolvers from their coats and open fire. 
EXT. CRACOW - DAY 
In BLACK AND WHITE and absolute silence, a suitcase thrown 
from a second story window arcs slowly through the air. As it hits the pavement, spilling open -- SOUND ON -- and, returning to COLOR -- 
Thousands of families pushing barrows through the streets of Kazimierz, dragging mattresses over the bridge at Podgorze, carrying kettles and fur coats and children on a mass forced exodus into the ghetto. 
Crowds of Poles line the sidewalks like spectators on a parade route. Some wave. Some take it more soberly, as if sensing they may be next. 
POLISH GIRL Goodbye, Jews. 
EXT. GHETTO GATE - DAY 
The little folding tables have been dragged out and set up again, and at them sit the clerks. 
Goldberg, of all people, has somehow managed to elevate himself to a station of some authority. Armed with something more frightening than a gun -- a clipboard -- he abets the Gestapo in their task of deciding who passes through the ghetto gate and who detours to the train station. 
PFEFFERBERG What's this? 
Pfefferberg, with his wife Mila, at the head of a line that seems to stretch back forever, flicks at Goldberg's OD armband with disgust. 
GOLDBERG Ghetto Police. I'm a policeman now, can you believe it? 
PFEFFERBERG Yeah, I can. 
They consider each other for a long moment before Pfefferberg leads his wife past Goldberg and into the ghetto. 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, GHETTO - NIGHT 
Dismayed by each others' close proximity, Orthodox and liberal Jews wait to use the floor's single bathroom. 
INT. GHETTO APARTMENT - NIGHT 
From the next apartment comes the liturgical solo of a cantor. In this apartment, looking like they can't bear much more of it, sit some non-Orthodox businessmen, Stern and Schindler. 
SCHINDLER For each thousand you invest, you take from the loading dock five hundred kilos of product a month -- to begin in July and to continue for one year -- after which time, we're even. (he shrugs) That's it. 
He lets them think about it, pours a shot of cognac from his flask, offers it to Stern, who brought this group together and now sits at Schindler's side. The accountant declines. 
INVESTOR 1 Not good enough. 
SCHINDLER Not good enough? Look where you're living. Look where you've been put. "Not good enough." (he almost laughs at the squalor) A couple of months ago, you'd be right. Not anymore. 
INVESTOR 1 Money's still money. 
SCHINDLER No, it isn't, that's why we're here. 
Schindler lights a cigarette and waits for their answer. It doesn't come. Just a silence. Which irritates him. 
SCHINDLER Did I call this meeting? You told Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me. I'm here. Now you want to negotiate? The offer's withdrawn. 
He caps his flask, pockets it, reaches for his top coat. 
INVESTOR 2 How do we know you'll do what you say? 
SCHINDLER Because I said I would. What do you want, a contract? To be filed where? (he slips into his coat) I said what I'll do, that's our contract. 
The investors study him. This is not a manageable German. 
Whether he's honest or not is impossible to say. Their glances to Stern don't help them; he doesn't know either. 
The silence in the room is filled by the muffled singing next door. One of the men eventually nods, He's in. Then another. And another. 
INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY 
A red power button is pushed, starting the motor of a huge metal press. The machine whirs, louder, louder. 
INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICE - SAME TIME - DAY 
Schindler, at a wall of a windows, is peering down at the lone technician making adjustments to the machine. 
STERN The standard SS rate for Jewish skilled labor is seven Marks a day, five for unskilled and women. This is what you pay the Economic Office, the laborers themselves receive nothing. Poles you pay wages. Generally, they get a little more. Are you listening? 
Schindler turns from the wall of glass to face his new accountant.

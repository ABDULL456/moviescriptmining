DIFFERENT ANGLE. 
There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen while David confronts his "father." George straightens up. 
GEORGE (solemn) Yes Bud. 
DAVID (beat) Don't you miss her? 
CLOSE UP. GEORGE. 
He looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody listens. George just stares at him like he got shot. 
DAVID I mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it ... 
George swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as he glances toward the back of the room. 
DAVID (CONT) (softer whisper) Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too. (shrugs) You might even call it "love." 
BIG BOB (BANGING the gavel loudly) Okay, that's IT!!! 
DAVID (motioning toward the back) Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her? 
Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of COLOR behind it. 
DAVID (CONT) Don't you wish you could tell her that? 
He nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well. 
BOB (POUNDING the gavel) YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER! 
DAVID Why am I out of order? 
BOB BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS! 
DAVID Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either. 
David motions behind him to the black and white section. There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces. 
BOB THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE. 
DAVID But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you. 
BOB (tightly) It's not in ME. 
DAVID Oh sure it is. 
BOB No it isn't. 
He crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans over the bench and gets right up in his face. 
DAVID (smug whisper) What do you want to do to me right now? 
Big Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves closer. 
DAVID (CONT) C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ... 
BIG BOB That's not going to happen! 
DAVID But it could happen. 
BIG BOB No it couldn't! 
Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely RED IN THE FACE. 
WIDER. 
A gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and just smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big Bob turns and catches his reflection in the window. 
CLOSE UP. BIG BOB. 
He sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down at his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and flees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom. 
ANGLE. DOORWAY. 
As Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town Square GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep green. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd moves outside. 
EXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!) 
All the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars, Green hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his creation. The whole town is washed in joy. 
WIDER. 
Margaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of conduct). Several people around them actually clap, like spectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and looks at her brother making out. 
JENNIFER Uch ... I am like gonna hurl ... 
David turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David throws his arms around his sister as more and more people stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY. 
David and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She clutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control. 
DAVID Are you sure? 
JENNIFER I told you. I'm like positive. 
DAVID This thing works. We could go home right now. 
JENNIFER I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while. 
WIDER. 
They stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge). 
A large sign says: "Springfield 12 Miles" and for the first time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning. Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit of style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the distance. 
JENNIFER Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there? 
DAVID (thinks ...) Honestly ... no.

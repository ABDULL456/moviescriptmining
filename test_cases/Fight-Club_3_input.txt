MARLA Do you want to wait to hear me describe death? 
Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the hook, walks out the back door. 
MARLA'S VOICE Do you want to listen and see if my spirit can use the telephone? 
Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious. 
INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES, LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT. Sheets RIP.  Bodies hit the FLOOR.  Insane GRUNTING and LAUGHING.  A flash of MARLA'S FACE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE 
Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room. 
INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING 
Jack steps out of his room.  The neighboring door is closed. 
JACK (V.O.) Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been living here two months, and Tyler's door was never closed. 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME 
Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest. He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. 
JACK You're not going to believe what I dreamt last night. 
Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's been raped by a hurricane.  Jack's jaw drops. 
MARLA I can hardly believe anything about last night. 
Marla goes to pour coffee.  She takes a swig, GARGLES and SPITS it in the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile. 
JACK What are you doing here? 
MARLA What... ? 
JACK What the hell are you doing here? 
Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink. 
MARLA Fuck you. 
Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out. Jack gets up, watches her stomp away. 
Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack, then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering, slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises. 
TYLER She's a piece of work.  Get this -- I come in here last night, the phone's off the hook... 
Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler.  TYLER'S VOICE FADES... 
JACK (V.O.) I already knew the story before he told it to me. 
INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK) 
Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens. 
MARLA'S VOICE (from handset) I'll tell you when I'm floating out of my body. 
Tyler smiles. 
JACK (V.O.) How could Tyler, off all people, think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die? 
INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK) 
Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars, looking at the rotting walls.  He reaches the top of the stairs and heads for Marla's room.  Before he can knock, Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him... 
INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK) 
Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged eyes look him over. 
MARLA You got here fast. 
She staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along with the blanket and sheets, to the floor. 
MARLA The mattresses are all sealed in slippery plastic. 
She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler. 
MARLA Did I call you? 
Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO lying atop a dresser.  Marla follows his gaze. 
MARLA Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you. 
SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS. 
MARLA Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops... 
She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door. 
INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK) 
Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE. COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits. Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass. 
COP 8-G!  Where's 8-G? 
MARLA (pointing) End of the hall. 
The rescuers keep running. 
MARLA (calling after) The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl, but she's lost faith in herself... 
COP Miss Singer, let us help you!  You have every reason to live! 
Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs. 
MARLA She's a monster!  Infectious human waste!  Good luck trying to save her! 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

BAIL ORGANA: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates. 
161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADMEÂ’SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN 
PADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the bedroom. 
C-3PO: My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda. 
PADME turns and rushes to the bedroom. 
162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN 
THREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN's ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps. 
THREEPIO: Hush! Not so loud! 
PADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace. 
PADME: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here. 
ANAKIN: I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe. 
PADME: Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening? 
C-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER. 
C-3PO: What is going on? 
ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS. 
C-3PO: (continuing) You can't be anymore confused than I am. 
ANAKIN: The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . . 
PADME: I can't believe that! 
ANAKIN: I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself. 
C-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO. 
C-3PO: Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids. 
ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips. 
C-3PO: (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud. 
ARTOO BEEPS quietly. 
C-3PO: (continuing) Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know. 
PADME: Anakin, what are you going to do? 
ANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme. 
ANAKIN: I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you. 
ANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme. 
PADME: What about Obi-Wan? 
ANAKIN: I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor. 
PADME: How could this have happened? 
ANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate. 
PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly. 
PADME: What are you saying? 
ANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over. 
PADME: What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect? 
ANAKIN: That won't happen. I won't let it. 
PADME: Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid. 
ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms. 
ANAKIN: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise. 
They kiss. 
ANAKIN: (continuing) Please, wait for me. 
PADME: I will. 
ANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away. 
C-3PO: (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo. 
ARTOO beeps. 
C-3PO: (continuing) Take care, my little friend. 
ARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.

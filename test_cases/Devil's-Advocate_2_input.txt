KEVIN What are you doing, Mr. Moyez? 
Moyez stands aside, wiping his hands on his trousers.        A huge beef tongue sits on the bench. The nails are scattered around it. 
MOYEZ You can go now. You will have all the help I can give you. 
Moyez now with a hammer. And the nail. Driving it into the tongue. Kevin backing away, as we --

Hand-held footage of a police raid. We're running -- through a building -- New York cops -- an animal control officer -- through a door -- voices yelling -- down some steps -- into a back yard -- people standing -- 
Here -- a scuffle starting -- voices rising -- the camera shaking -- we see Bhalla -- and the Woman -- and -- 
There -- in the middle, is a goat -- on its knees -- its throat has just been cut -- blood pouring into a pan and Moyez holding its head with one hand -- a knife in the other and this positively orgiastic expression on his face, and on that image, we freeze frame.

with the remote control.   Pam there with him.   A long, sour silence. 
PAM What do you think? 
KEVIN It's a health code case. And it's a loser. So what's the point? (watching her) It's a test, right? 
PAM Isn't everything? 
KEVIN The smart thing to do is make a deal. Plea him out and suppress the tape. 
PAM I'm sure the D.A.'s waiting for your call. 
KEVIN Yeah, well, let him wait. (beat) And you can tell Milton too. (beat) I didn't come to New York to plea bargain.

Bench trial. No jury. JUDGE THEO SKLAR and staff. A.D.A. MERTO at his seat. Pam sits with Moyez. Other than that, it's empty. 
A rump roast slaps down onto a table. 
KEVIN (O.S.) That's a veal roast, Your Honor. U.S.D.A. approved and stamped. Eight days ago, in Kansas City, two men pushed a calf into a steel frame as a third man fired a high- voltage staple-gun into the animal's skull. Men kill animals and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez killed a goat. He killed a goat. And he did it at home, in a manner consistent with his religious beliefs. Now some people may find it bizarre. (MORE)

KEVIN (O.S.CONT'D) It's certainly not a religious practice performed by everyone. It's not as common as, say, circumcision. It's certainly not as common as the belief that wine is transformed into blood. It's not even as common as the handling of poisonous snakes to prove one's faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn't two thousand miles away in a stockyard. He doesn't use electricity to kill. And worst of all... (holding up the roast) Phillipe Moyez is not shrink- wrapped. 
Merto begins to cough.    Quietly at first, but... 
KEVIN Your Honor, the city timed this police action to catch my client exercising his constitutionally- protected right to religious freedom. 
Merto's coughing getting worse as he tries to stop... 
JUDGE SKLAR This is a law protecting Kosher butchering. 
KEVIN Exactly, Your Honor. And I'd like to move at this time for an immediate directed verdict for dismissal. 
Moyez staring a hole in Merto, and the man cannot stop coughing... 
JUDGE SKLAR I happen to know a little bit about Kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.

KEVIN I'm aware of that, Your Honor, which is why I feel confident in requesting a dismissal. 
JUDGE SKLAR Mr. Merto?

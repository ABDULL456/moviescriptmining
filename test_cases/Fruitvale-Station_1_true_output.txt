Everyone is finishing up their cake, it's about half gone now. Oscar sits on the couch between Wanda and Sophina. 
Ceephus and Daryl now sit in plush chairs with metal frames pulled up next to the coffee table. Grandma Bonnie sits in a recliner at the foot of the coffee table. 
GRANDMA BONNIE If somebody told me say twenty years ago, that I would live to see it happen, I'd have laughed in their face. 
OSCAR If somebody would have told me that two years ago I would have laughed in their face. 
DARYL And here we are. 2008 and its happened.

CEEPHUS But I think it's a sign of the times. The country is in bad enough shape for them to hand it over to a black guy. Look, if Bush hadn't have messed the country up so bad. Would he have even had a shot? 
DARYL I think he still would have had a shot. 
CEEPHUS But would he have won though? 
WANDA Well, I'm happy the did win. If the country really is as messed up as you say, I think he's our best chance of fixing it.

SOPHINA I keep thinking about how much it means for T. 
OSCAR When I was coming up, Teachers used to love to tell me, "You can be the President of the United States." 
WANDA You'd make a great politician. You can talk your way out of anything. 
Sophina and Oscar share a look. 
OSCAR But I'll never forget, in my fourth grade classroom we had this poster. It had all 40 some odd presidents on that thang. And I looked at all they faces. And it was all white dudes. At that point, I realized my teachers was lying to me. (beat) A part of me aint believed what no teacher has said to me since. 
DARYL Now there will be a black face on those posters.

GRANDMA BONNIE Well let's let him get in there first. 
WANDA I know, I still feel like it's just too good to be true. 
CEEPHUS What's so good about it? 
DARYL A black man, one of us has been elected president, fair and square. 
Ceephus shakes his head at this. 
CEEPHUS But he's not one of us. He wasn't affected by slavery. 
Wanda has had enough of this. She stands up and starts to grab everyone's plates. She heads into the kitchen to wash. Oscar watches her for a beat, then follows after her. Goldenrod (7/19/2012)                                     55. 
39     INT. GRANDMA BONNIE'S HOUSE- KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER       39 
Wanda stands over the sink washing the dishes. Oscar stands next to her, drying them. 
WANDA (O.S.) Thanks for your help tonight. 
OSCAR Oh, Come'on Ma, don't mention it. You shouldn't even be doing this. 
WANDA I enjoy washing dishes. It's relaxing. 
(CONTINUED) Goldenrod (7/19/2012)                                     56. 39      CONTINUED:                                               39 
Oscar rolls his eyes at this. She hands him another dish. 
WANDA (CONT'D) I really enjoyed having you here. (beat) You think it's safe for me to get used to having you around? 
OSCAR I told you. I aint missin no more parties. 
She looks at Oscar for a long beat, searching for the truth in his eyes. She finds it. 
WANDA You guys got plans for tonight? 
OSCAR Yeah, nothing major. Gonna meet up with Cato, Jack, Jason and couple other cats. Head out to the City. 
WANDA You guys gonna go OUT OUT?

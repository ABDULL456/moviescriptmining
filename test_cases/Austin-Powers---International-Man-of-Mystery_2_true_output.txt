AUSTIN Circus folk. (shudders) Nomads, you know.  They smell like cabbage. 
BASIL EXPOSITION (suffering him) Indeed...If we could get back to the business at hand.  It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it. 
AUSTIN Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle. (hands him the photos) I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan.  It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development. 
VANESSA When did you find that out, Austin? 
BASIL EXPOSITION Austin did some reconnaissance work at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last night. 
VANESSA Oh. 
BASIL EXPOSITON Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon.  Any ideas? 
VANESSA Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their facilities every hour.  I suggest we pose as tourists and do site-level reconnaissance. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Top drawer, Kensington.  Oh, Austin, I want you to meet somebody. 
Basil waves to an extremely frail ELDERLY BRITISH LADY. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Austin, this is my mother, Mrs. Exposition.  She's in from Tunbridge Wells 
in Kent.  Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old? 
Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face. 
BASIL EXPOSITION My God, Austin, what have you done? 
AUSTIN That's not your mother, that's a man! 
Austin begins tugging on her hair. 
MRS. EXPOSITION Owww...my hair! 
BASIL EXPOSITION Get away from my mother! 
VANESSA Austin, have you gone mad? 
The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot. 
MRS. EXPOSITION (through pain) Who is that man?  Why did he hit me? 
BASIL EXPOSIION Don't worry, mother.  Lie down. Austin, you have a lot of explaining to do. 
AUSTIN I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Damn it, man!  You're talking about my mother! 
AUSTIN You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick. 
VANESSA Really, Austin! 
AUSTIN Look at her hands, baby!  Those are carpenter's hands. 
BASIL EXPOSITION All right, Austin, I think you should go. 
AUSTIN I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag. 
BASIL EXPOSITION I'm leaving! (pause) Oh, and Austin? 
AUSTIN Yes, Basil? 
BASIL EXPOSITION Be careful. 
AUSTIN Thanks. 
Basil escorts his mother out. 
VANESSA Austin, may I have a word with you? 
AUSTIN Of course, luv.

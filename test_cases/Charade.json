{"train": "CHARADE \nWritten by \nPeter Stone \nBased on a story by \nPeter Stone and Marc Behm \nOctober 1st, 1962 \nFADE IN (BEFORE TITLES) \nEXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK \nSilence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking. \nCAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and louder until the sound of a train can be recognized. \nCAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is upon us, flashing by with a roar. \nThen, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the thick underbrush alongside the tracks. \nCLOSE SHOT -- BODY \nIt lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the train fades off until there is silence once more. \nTITLE MUSIC begins with a crash. \n(MAIN TITLES) \nDELETED \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MEGEVE -- DAY \nA handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck -- tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers. \nOne of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl. \nShe is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite activity -- eating. \nThen -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, black and ugly in the sunlight. \nREGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat. \nThe finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight into REGGIE's face. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nIncluding JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks at him sternly. \nJEAN-LOUIS (in for trouble) Oh, la. \nREGGIE Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded. (calling) Sylvie! \nWIDER ANGLE \nSYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS. \nREGGIE Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche? \nSYLVIE (to JEAN-LOUIS) Va jouer, mon ange. \nJEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee. \nSYLVIE When you start to eat like this something is the matter. \nNo answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as REGGIE continues eating. \nREGGIE Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce. \nSYLVIE \u00c7a alors! From Charles? \nREGGIE He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but -- \nSYLVIE But what? \nREGGIE I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable. \nREGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards the devastated table before following. \nSYLVIE It is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat! \nINT. SWIMMING POOL -- DAY \nA magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow- covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their conversation continuing. \nSYLVIE But why do you want a divorce? \nREGGIE Because I don't love him. \nSYLVIE But that is no reason to get a divorce! \nEXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY \nAn open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun- worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear, their conversation continuing. \nSYLVIE With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends. \nREGGIE (sitting) I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial, \nbut that doesn't mean I'm ready for French Traditional. I loathe the idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if only Charles had been honest with me -- that's all I ask of anybody -- the simple truth. But with him, everything is secrecy and lies. He's hiding something -- something frightening -- something terrible -- and evil. \nShe stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over her. She wheels, terrified. \nCLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASK \nA strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this particular mask stare down at REGGIE. \nMAN Does this belong to you? \nCAMERA PANS down to include JEAN-LOUIS, his hand held firmly by the man in the mask. \nWIDER ANGLE \nIncluding REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE is too terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA, takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face. \nJEAN-LOUIS Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter -- \nREGGIE -- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay? \nJEAN-LOUIS Okay. \nREGGIE walks toward the house with the driver, who carries her cases.  She presses the button that electrically opens the front door. \nDELETED \nINT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY \nAs the elevator rises REGGIE gets out, followed by the driver. He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door. \nREGGIE (handing him a tip) Merci. \nThe driver leaves. She goes to the door and presses the minuterie, the button that turns on the time-light, and the lights come on. Then she rings the doorbell. There is no answer. She rings again. Still nothing. Sighing, she digs out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock. At this moment the minuterie expires, plunging the scene into darkness. \nREGGIE'S VOICE Wonderful. \nShe finds the button and the light goes on again. She inserts the key and turns it. \nINT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- ENTRANCE HALL -- DAY \nCLOSE SHOT -- DOOR as it opens and REGGIE steps into the CLOSE SHOT. \nShe stops, her expression changing. \nREVERSE SHOT \nFrom REGGIE's p.o.v. as CAMERA PANS the entrance hall. It is bare -- no furniture, no rug, no pictures, no nothing. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE \nShe stares for a moment, then goes back out into the landing. \nINT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY \nAs REGGIE steps back outside. She looks at the nameplate beside the door. \nINSERT NAMEPLATE \nIt reads \"MR. AND MRS. CHARLES LAMPERT.\" \nINT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY \nREGGIE looks at the plate in disbelief, then turns and hurries back into the apartment. \nINT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DAY \nAs REGGIE hurries into the entrance hall. \nREGGIE Honorine -- ! \nNo answer. \nNow, CAMERA FOLLOWING, she goes into the Salon. It is also empty -- stripped bare. There are squares of the wall's original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still in the wall. \nShe rushes now, going into the bedroom, CAMERA FOLLOWING crazily, lurching and careening behind her. The bedroom, too, is empty. She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and throws open all the doors. Only some hangers remain. \nShe pulls open the drawers -- nothing! \nREGGIE Charles -- ! \nShe turns, and running now, goes through another door to the library, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The rows of shelves are as empty as the rest of the apartment. She begins to turn in a circle, looking for something, anything. In a panic she turns and runs out, colliding suddenly with a MAN whom she (and we) have not noticed until the moment of impact. \nREGGIE screams. \nCLOSE SHOT -- INSPECTOR GRANDPIERRE \nA heavy-set man of no particular age with tobacco-colored hair, and thick glasses. \nGRANDPIERRE Madame Charles Lampert? \nWIDER ANGLE \nIncluding REGGIE, in a state of near-shock. \nREGGIE Yes. \nGRANDPIERRE I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please? \nINT. MORGUE -- DAY \nWe see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too- familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin. \nANOTHER ANGLE -- OVERHEAD \nLooking straight down at the tops of REGGIE's, GRANDPIERRE's and an ATTENDANT's head and smack into the open drawer. \nGRANDPIERRE lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe. \nHe stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then moves to the other end to uncover the head.  As the sheet starts to lift: \nREVERSE SHOT \nREGGIE as she looks down into the CAMERA. She closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again. \nGRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.) Well, Madame -- ? \nShe nods. \nGRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.) You are positive? \nShe nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the SHOT. \nGRANDPIERRE You loved him? \nREGGIE I'm very cold. \nGRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT. \nCAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall. BLACKNESS comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies. \nINT. GRANDPIERRE'S OFFICE -- DAY \nCLOSE SHOT -- DESK DRAWER (FROM ABOVE) as it is pulled open. \nA photograph of Charles Lampert lies face up in the drawer. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE \nGRANDPIERRE Have you nothing to say, Madame? \nREGGIE looks down at the four passports, then back to GRANDPIERRE. \nREGGIE (hopefully) It's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now. \nINT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DUSK \nThe house is empty as before. Now it is silent, the late afternoon light coming from outside. REGGIE stands by a window. A canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby. \nSuddenly there is the noise of a DOOR OPENING. \nCLOSER SHOT -- REGGIE \nAs her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise. There is a moment of silence, then FOOTSTEPS are heard, coming closer. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs PETER enters. \nREGGIE (surprised) What are you doing here? \nPETER I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do. \nREGGIE How did you find out? \nPETER It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry. \nREGGIE Thank you. \nA silence. \nPETER I rang the bell but I don't think it's working. \nREGGIE Yes it is -- I heard it this morning. \nHe looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and flicks it on -- nothing happens. He flicks it a few more times. \nREGGIE They must have turned off the electricity. \nShe shakes her head. PETER looks around. \nPETER Where did everything go? \nREGGIE Charles sold it all -- at auction. \nPETER Do you know what you're going to do? \nREGGIE Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose. \nPETER Doing what? \nREGGIE I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him. \nPETER Instant divorce you mean? \nREGGIE Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail. \nPETER (Taking her hand) Come on. You can't stay here. \nREGGIE I don't know where to go. \nPETER We'll find you a hotel. \nREGGIE Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore. \nPETER Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay? \nShe nods. He picks up the airlines bag and they start out. \nREGGIE stops at the door and looks back. \nREGGIE I loved this room -- but Charles never saw it -- only what was in it. All those exquisite things -- (looking around) I think I prefer it like this. \nINT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY \nCLOSE SHOT of a phonograph. A hand appears, starts the record on it spinning, then places the arm at the beginning. \nAn instant later ORGAN MUSIC starts with a roar. \nINT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY \nCLOSE SHOT of the coffin. It rests on a low platform, with a bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open. \nInside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie the remnants of Charles Lampert. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE \nThe INSPECTOR sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his hands in a prayer-like attitude. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large, dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row, REGGIE and SYLVIE are discovered. Besides GRANDPIERRE, they are the only ones present. REGGIE turns around to look at the empty room. They speak in whispers. \nREGGIE It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out. \nSYLVIE Didn't Charles have any friends? \nREGGIE Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow. (indicating GRANDPIERRE) If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him. \nSYLVIE At least he knows how to behave at funerals. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE \nHis eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands -- he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper. \nTWO SHOT -- SYLVIE AND REGGIE \nSYLVIE Have you no idea who could have done it? \nREGGIE Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that. \nThe front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of daylight streams in. The WOMEN turn. \nMED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR \nThe short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE \nAs he watches GIDEON. \nEXT. THE AMERICAN EMBASSY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY \nThe fine old building in the Rue Gabriel. \nDELETED \nINT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY \nAs REGGIE leaves the elevator two young DIPLOMATIC TYPES step in, immersed in conversation. \n1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE I bluffed the Old Man out of the last pot -- with a pair of deuces. \n2ND DIPLOMATIC TYPE What's so depressing about that? \n1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE If I can do it, what are the Russians doing to him? \nThe elevator door closes on them. REGGIE reacts to this and starts down the hall, finally stopping at the door. \nMED. SHOT -- DOOR \nIt is marked \"307-A  H. BARTHOLOMEW.\" REGGIE checks the letter, then opens the door. \nINT. BARTHOLOMEW'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY \nThe office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk is covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for somebody, notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar. \nREGGIE (tentatively) Hello -- ? (there is no answer) Hello? \nBARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.) (from the private office) Is there anything wrong, Miss Tompkins? \nREGGIE Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here. \nBARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion. \nBARTHOLOMEW I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ? \nREGGIE Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert. \nBARTHOLOMEW (looking at his watch) Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late. \nHe motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do so. \nINT. BARTHOLOMEW'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY \nA small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three kids on the desk. BARTHOLOMEW indicates a chair, then goes behind his desk and sits. A can of lighter fluid stands open on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it. \nBARTHOLOMEW Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert -- it's a stubborn little devil. \nHe works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and hankie. \nBARTHOLOMEW Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow. \nREGGIE Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am? \nBARTHOLOMEW (looking up) Charles Lampert's widow -- yes? (going back to the tie) Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back. \nHe looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his tie. \nBARTHOLOMEW Voil\u00e0! As they say. \nHe puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket. \nHe opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches wrapped in waxpaper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of mustard, a bottle of red wine and two Dixie cups. \nBARTHOLOMEW Have some, please. I've got... (checking) ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst. \nREGGIE No thanks. \nHe uncorks the wine, fills a cup and begins eating. \nBARTHOLOMEW Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert? \nREGGIE I don't suppose it's an airline, is it? \nBARTHOLOMEW Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A. \nREGGIE You mean spies and things like that? \nBARTHOLOMEW Only we call them agents. \nREGGIE We? You mean you're --? \nBARTHOLOMEW Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert -- \nREGGIE I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit -- \nBARTHOLOMEW I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs -- \nREGGIE Agent. \nBARTHOLOMEW Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business. \nREGGIE What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew? \nBARTHOLOMEW (his mouth full) Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government. \nREGGIE May I have a sandwich, please? \nHe hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her. \nBARTHOLOMEW To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency. \nREGGIE (eating) So that was it. \nBARTHOLOMEW Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name. \nREGGIE (almost choking) His -- real -- ? \nBARTHOLOMEW Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss -- (taking a photo from his desk) -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you? (indicating the kids on the desk) Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr. \nREGGIE Very sweet. \nBARTHOLOMEW Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and -- \nREGGIE Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license. \nBARTHOLOMEW Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look. \nHe reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which he gives her. \nEXT. ESPLANADE DES CHAMPS-ELY\u00c9ES -- DAY \nMED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL. \nOne of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde. At the moment, Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard. \nVARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN \nSitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. Their attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE \nSitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin. \nAfter a moment, PETER comes up behind her and, stepping over the benches, sits beside her. She doesn't seem to notice. \n[Throughout the following scene the CHILDREN and the ACTORS can be heard in the b.g.] \nPETER Reggie -- ? \nShe turns and looks at him for a moment. \nREGGIE (vaguely) Hallo, Peter. \nPETER You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you. \nREGGIE I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing. \nA ROAR from the CHILDREN. REGGIE and PETER turn toward the stage. \nMED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL \nPUNCH and JUDY are arguing loudly. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER \nPETER What's going on? \nREGGIE Don't you understand French? \nPETER I'm still having trouble with English. \nREGGIE The man and the woman are married -- \nCLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE \nPUNCH and JUDY are batting each other on the head. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) Yes, I can see that -- they're batting each other over the head with clubs. \nFinally, JUDY knocks Punch out of sight and a PUPPET wearing a three-cornered hat appears. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) Who's that with the hat? \nMED SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE \nWearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching. \nREGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) That's the policeman -- he wants to arrest Judy for killing Punch. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE \nJUDY and the POLICEMAN are batting one another. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) What's she saying now? \nREGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) That she's innocent -- she didn't do it. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) She did it, all right -- take it from me. \nREGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) I believe her. \nPUNCH's head appears on the other side of the stage, says something, then ducks out. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) Who was that? \nREGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) Punch, of course. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER \nPETER Of course? I thought he was dead. \nREGGIE He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only -- (her face clouding) only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do? \nCharles was mixed up in something terrible. \nPETER I wish you'd let me help you. Whatever it is, it doesn't sound like the sort of thing that a woman can handle all by herself. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE \nJUDY has gotten the upper hand is now batting the POLICEMAN's brains out. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE as he winces. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER \nPETER Have you got a mirror? (she nods) Give it to me. \nShe hands it to him and he holds it in front of her face. \nPETER Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up? \nREGGIE (jumping at the suggesting) Starting tonight? \nINT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT \nMED. SHOT -- EMCEE. \nHe stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece Latin dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional smile as he speaks into a mike. \nEMCEE Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good evening ladies and gentlemen, guten Abend, meine Damen und Herren -- ce soir, comme tous les soirs, l'attraction ici, au Black Sheep Club, c'est vous! Venez, mesdames et messieurs, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, kommen Sie her, meine Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e signori -- avanti! \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER \nAt their table. REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress. \nPETER What was all that? \nREGGIE Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow. \nThe WAITER nods and goes. \nREGGIE (anxiously) Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground -- \nBARTHOLOMEW Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money. \nREGGIE Steal it how? \nBARTHOLOMEW By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked. \nREGGIE (fascinated) May I have a cigarette, please? \nBARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip. He winces. \nREGGIE I hate these things -- it's like drinking coffee through a veil. \nShe puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches and lights it. \nBARTHOLOMEW Everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried -- then, before they could get out, they were ambushed by a German patrol. A machine gun separated Scobie from his right hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full in the stomach. \nREGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth. \nBARTHOLOMEW What's wrong with that one? \nHe points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically brand-new in the ashtray. \nREGGIE Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened then? \nShe hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first cigarette. \nBARTHOLOMEW Have you any idea what these things cost over here? \nREGGIE Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then? \nBARTHOLOMEW Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they -- \nThe WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup. \nWAITER La soupe, c'est pour qui? \nREGGIE Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew. \nThe WAITER puts down the cup and bowl and leaves. \nBARTHOLOMEW Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again. \nREGGIE But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them? \nBARTHOLOMEW We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof. \nREGGIE But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.? \nBARTHOLOMEW C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back. \nREGGIE I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight. \nBARTHOLOMEW I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you. \nREGGIE Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country. \nBARTHOLOMEW That's the spirit. \nREGGIE Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do? \nBARTHOLOMEW We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle. \nREGGIE Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive. \nBARTHOLOMEW No, Mrs. Lampert. \nREGGIE But no one actually saw him die. \nBARTHOLOMEW No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington. \nREGGIE Oh. Then who's this one? \nBARTHOLOMEW I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you? \nREGGIE Me? Why me? \nBARTHOLOMEW You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you. (grinning) Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies. \nREGGIE (resigned) Agents. \nEXT. HOTEL (PLACE ST. ANDR\u00c9 DES ARTS) -- LATE AFTERNOON \nDYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. As she watches DYLE, a SANDWICH-MAN advertising a driving school passes the hotel. REGGIE falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding her from view. \nEXT. PLACE ST. ANDR\u00c9 DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON \nFirst comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. The SANDWICH-MAN turns off, leaving REGGIE out in the open. A moment later, DYLE passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged TOURIST. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST \nThe TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and she stares back. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it. \nHe smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her. \nREGGIE turns to look at DYLE. \nMED. SHOT -- DYLE \nHe has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST \nThe TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he opens his mouth to make a sound, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some money on the table and starts after her. \nEXT. PLACE ST. ANDR\u00c9 DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON \nREGGIE following DYLE. As she passes the GIRL painting, she cannot resist turning to see the work. \nCLOSE SHOT -- PAINTING \nAn abstract jumble, nothing recognizable. \nCLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE \nAs she looks from the painting to reality. \nREGGIE Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are. \nDYLE But you know my name -- it's Dyle. \nREGGIE Carson Dyle is dead. \nDYLE Yes, he is. He was my brother. \nREGGIE Your -- \nDYLE The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that. \nREGGIE How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it? (pause) Aren't you going to tell me? (pause) Hello -- ? \nShe opens the door of the cabin and starts out. \nMED. SHOT -- PHONE CABINS \nAs REGGIE steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the others. They are all occupied except one and she looks inside it. \nCLOSE SHOT -- EMPTY CABIN \nThe receiver hangs by its cord, swinging back and forth. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE \nAs she looks at it, confused. \nINT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- DAY \nDYLE and SCOBIE stand together, waiting for the elevator, SCOBIE clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat. \nSCOBIE (quietly) If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay? \nDYLE You'll wreck your raincoat. \nThe self-service elevator doors open, one or two PASSENGERS come out and DYLE and SCOBIE enter. A young GIRL starts in after them. \nSCOBIE Next car, please. \nHe reaches out and presses the top button with his metal hand. The doors close. \nDELETED \nINT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON \nAs SCOBIE follows DYLE out of the elevator. SCOBIE looks around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall. He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door, which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs, leading up to a second floor. \nSCOBIE Okay -- turn around. \nDYLE turns to find SCOBIE's gun out of the pocket and pointing at him. SCOBIE now transfers it to his metal hand and goes to DYLE, where he proceeds to frisk him. \nFinding the gun DYLE carries in his inside coat pocket, SCOBIE removes it. During the following conversation he will shake open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to DYLE. Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand. \nSCOBIE Sit down. \nShrugging, DYLE sits on the third step. \nDYLE What now? \nSCOBIE We wait -- with our mouths shut. \nINT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- NIGHT \nThe last EMPLOYEES leave the building as the WATCHMAN locks the front door after them. \nINT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT \nIn the semi-darkness, DYLE is still sitting on the third step, SCOBIE still facing him with a gun. \nDYLE How long do you intend -- ? \nSCOBIE I said with the mouth shut. \nDYLE yawns wide. \nDYLE Sorry about that. \nSCOBIE Okay -- up there. \nDYLE gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by SCOBIE. DYLE stops at the door. \nDYLE Do I knock or something? \nSCOBIE Open it. \nDYLE opens the door. The stairs continue up. \nSCOBIE Keep going. \nDYLE The view had better be worth it. \nEXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- ROOFTOP -- NIGHT \nA spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely separated oval-shaped dormer windows. \nBelow these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven stories. \nDYLE Very pretty. Now what? \nSCOBIE I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money? \nDYLE Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that. \nSCOBIE And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it? \nDYLE Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over? \nSCOBIE You're out, Dyle -- right now! \nSCOBIE aims the gun and starts advancing toward DYLE. \nSCOBIE Step back. \nDYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street. \nDYLE Back where? \nSCOBIE That's the idea. \nREGGIE Sure. \nDYLE Okay, I'll drive you around there some day. (his back stinging) Ouch! \nREGGIE Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days. \nDYLE Alexander. \nREGGIE Is there a Mrs. Dyle? \nDYLE Yes, but we're divorced. \nREGGIE I thought that was Peter Joshua. \nDYLE (smiling) I'm no easier to live with than he was. \nREGGIE (finishing the bandage) There -- you're a new man. \nAs they continue talking, he rises from the bed and goes into his own room. REGGIE remains on the bed, watching him through the open door as he puts on a fresh T-shirt and shirt. \nDYLE I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this. \nREGGIE Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not? \nDYLE You can't. \nREGGIE There must be some way. \nDYLE There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he? \nREGGIE Why couldn't you just look at his feet? \nDYLE Because he's wearing moccasins. \nREGGIE Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course. \nDYLE Why not a lying Blackfoot? \nREGGIE (confused) Which one are you? \nDYLE (entering, smiling) Whitefoot, of course. \nREGGIE Come here. \nHe goes to the bed. \nREGGIE Sit down. \nHe sits. \nREGGIE I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee. \nDYLE Reggie -- listen to me -- \nREGGIE Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. \nDYLE So was Juliet -- at fifteen. \nREGGIE I'm not fifteen. \nDYLE Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me. \nREGGIE Why can't you be serious? \nDYLE There, you said it. \nREGGIE Said what? \nDYLE Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be. \nREGGIE Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that? \nShe starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek. \nDYLE Now please, Reggie -- cut it out. \nREGGIE (pulling back) Okay. \nDYLE What are you doing? \nREGGIE Cutting it out. \nDYLE Who told you to do that? \nREGGIE You did. \nDYLE But I'm not through complaining yet. \nREGGIE Oh. (She starts kissing him again) \nDYLE Now please, Reggie -- cut it out. \nREGGIE I think I love you, Alex -- \nShe kisses him on the mouth. The phone rings. He tries to talk as she continues kissing him. \nDYLE (mumbling) The phone's ringing -- \nREGGIE Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I. \nThe phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him. \nFinally, REGGIE reaches out to the bedstand and takes the phone off the hook. She brings the receiver up to their mouths and mumbles into it. \nREGGIE (on phone) Sorry -- I was just -- uh -- nibbling on something. \nINT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nTEX speaks into the phone. \nTEX Miz Lampert, my buddies 'n me, we'd oblige it mighty highly if you could mosey on across the hall 'n chew the fat with us for a spell. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nDYLE is watching her. \nREGGIE (on the phone) Can you give me one good reason why I should? \nINT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nTEX Mine's in the door. Ariva durchy, y'all. \nThe THREE MEN file out. DYLE and REGGIE exchange looks. \nDYLE Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote? \nREGGIE Scobie -- he's the one that objected. \nDYLE (handing her the boy) He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside. \nREGGIE Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt. \nJEAN-LOUIS (joining them) Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize? \nREGGIE (to DYLE) What should we give him? \nDYLE How about $25,000? Or do you think it would spoil him? \nShe smiles, takes JEAN-LOUIS' hand and leaves. DYLE turns to survey TEX's room. \nHe goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and the bed, looking in it and under it. Then he goes to the desk and opens the drawers -- also empty. The bureau is next -- he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are completely empty. Frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens it -- shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare. \nThen, CAMERA PANNING DOWN, he sees the only thing he's found so far in the room -- a pair of fine cowboy boots. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT -- AIRLINES BAG. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include GIDEON, staring down at it as it lies on the table in the center of the room. \nGIDEON (eyes on the bag) Tex? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nIncluding TEX, busy going through the bureau. He looks up, then joins GIDEON. \nTEX What's that? \nGIDEON empties the contents of the bag on the table, then starts examining the various items. He opens the wallet. \nINSERT - WALLET \nInside, the initials \"C.L.\" are printed in gold. \nTEX'S VOICE (O.S.) Charlie's stuff? \nGIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.) Looks like it. \nMED. SHOT -- TEX & GIDEON \nTEX Mebbe we'd better call Herman. \nGIDEON has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter, removing it from the envelope and reading it. \nGIDEON What for? If it's not here, why bother him? \nTEX And if it is? \nGIDEON (a pause) Why bother him? \nA broad grin from TEX. They continue going through the items from the bag. \nTEX You sure nuthin's missin'? \nGIDEON No. The police have kindly provided us with a list. \nTEX takes the list, examines it, then folds it and puts it in his pocket. They finish with the items from the bag. \nTEX There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million. \nGIDEON Not unless we're blind. \nTEX (staring at GIDEON) You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream? \nGIDEON Meaning what? \nTEX You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all. \nGIDEON (very sincerely) You know I'd tell you if I had it. \nTEX Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you. \nGIDEON Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too. \nTEX & GIDEON (together) Nachurly! \nThe TWO MEN look at one another, then smile -- then laugh. \nDELETED \nINT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE on the phone, JEAN-LOUIS standing by. \nREGGIE -- He's all right, Sylvie, honestly. Just hurry up and get here. \nShe hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS. \nREGGIE Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it? \nJEAN-LOUIS I know. I would bury it in the garden. \nREGGIE Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden. \nJEAN-LOUIS Oh. (Afterthought) Neither do I. (Seeing something) Voil\u00e0! \nREGGIE Voil\u00e0 what? \nJEAN-LOUIS (pointing) Up there! I would put it up there! \nREGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top of the high armoire. \nREGGIE You know something, cookie? Why not? \nTaking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything, by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand over the top and grope around blindly. \nREGGIE I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy. \nJEAN-LOUIS (jumping up and down) I found it! I found it! \nREGGIE If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy. \nGRANDPIERRE No! No! No! No! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include, REGGIE, DYLE, TEX and GIDEON, all sitting silently in the INSPECTOR's office. \nGRANDPIERRE A man drowned in his bed -- impossible! And in his pajamas -- the second one in his pajamas -- c'est trop b\u00eate! Stop lying to me -- (Tapping the side of his nose) this nose tells me when you are lying -- it is never mistaken, not in twenty- three years -- this nose will make me commissaire of police. (Tapping his fingers on his desk) Mr. Dyle or Mr. Joshua -- which is it? \nDYLE Dyle. \nGRANDPIERRE And yet you registered in Megeve as Mr. Joshua. Do you know it is against the law to register under an assumed name? \nDYLE No, I didn't. \nREGGIE It's done in America all the time. \nGRANDPIERRE raps for silence on his desk. During the pause, he looks into each face in turn. \nGRANDPIERRE None of you will be permitted to leave Paris -- until this matter is cleared up. Only I warn you -- I will be watching. We use the guillotine in this country -- I have always suspected that the blade coming down causes no more than a slight tickling sensation on the back of the neck. It is only a guess, of course -- I hope none of you ever finds out for certain. \nDELETED \nEXT. QUAI MONTEBELLO -- LATE AFTERNOON (TRAVELING) \nREGGIE and DYLE walking along the quai, next to the Seine, CAMERA LEADING. \nREGGIE Who do you think did it -- Gideon? \nDYLE Maybe. \nREGGIE Or Tex? \nDYLE Maybe. \nREGGIE You're a big help. Can I have one of those? \nThey have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the Pont au Double. DYLE shrugs. \nREGGIE (to the VENDOR) Vanille-chocolat. \nDuring the following, the VENDOR makes a double-decker cone and hands it to REGGIE. DYLE pays and they resume their walk -- all with no break in the dialogue. \nREGGIE I think Tex did it. \nDYLE Why? \nREGGIE Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect. \nDYLE Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it? \nREGGIE What's so illogical about that? \nDYLE A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon. \nREGGIE Oh. I guess they just can't help it. \nDYLE Who? \nREGGIE Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie. (a pause) Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that? \nDYLE What -- like Scobie? \nREGGIE No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some? \nShe offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough force to dislodge the ice-cream. It lands right next to his lapel, over his outside breast pocket. \nDYLE (frowning) I'd love some, thanks. \nREGGIE I'm sorry. \nHe pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks inside, then shakes his head sadly at what he sees. REGGIE still holds the empty cone, not knowing what to do with it. \nSeeing this, he takes it and sticks it into his pocket. \nDYLE No sense messing up the streets. \nREGGIE Alex -- \nDYLE Hm? \nREGGIE I'm scared. \nDYLE Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you. \nREGGIE No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed. \nThey resume walking. \nDYLE Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many -- \nREGGIE What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too. \nDYLE Yes, I know. \nREGGIE First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that? \nDYLE (surprised) What? Assassinate somebody? \nREGGIE No -- \nANOTHER ANGLE \nIncluding the Cathedral of NOTRE DAME in the background. \nREGGIE -- swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love -- like Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'? \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON \nAs REGGIE and DYLE step from the elevator. \nREGGIE Hurry up and change -- I'm starved. \nDYLE Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches. \nHe goes into his room and she goes into hers. \nDELETED \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON \nShe enters, fixes her hair in the mirror, then goes to the door connecting her room with DYLE's. She unlocks it, tries to open it, but finds it locked. Disappointed, she knocks. \nBARTHOLOMEW (on the phone) I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON \nCLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE on the phone, looking like the rug has been pulled out from under her. \nREGGIE (pause, quietly) Are you sure there's no mistake? \nINT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON \nBARTHOLOMEW (on the phone) None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON \nREGGIE slowly lowers the phone to its cradle, a worried expression on her face. Then the bathroom door opens and DYLE appears dressed in a large bath towel. Her back is to him. \nDYLE I left all my drip-dry dripping -- is it all right? \nShe doesn't answer. \nDYLE Reggie -- is something wrong? \nShe shakes her head. \nDYLE You're probably weak from hunger. You've only had five meals today. Hurry up and we'll go out. \nShe turns and looks at him. \nREGGIE Do you mind if we go someplace crowded? I -- I feel like lots of people tonight. \nEXT. SEINE - B\u00c2TEAU MOUCHE -- DUSK \nThe large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze with lights. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND DYLE (PROCESS) \nAt a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in the b.g. \nDYLE Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes. \nREGGIE I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me? \nDYLE Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that. \nREGGIE How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it. \nDYLE No -- not yet. \nREGGIE But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so? \nDYLE Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie? \nShe doesn't answer. \nDYLE What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim? \nREGGIE It's a start, anyway. \nDYLE I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder. \nREGGIE Carson Dyle didn't have a brother. \nWIDER ANGLE \nShe rises from the table and walks away. DYLE hesitates a moment, then follows. \nDYLE I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen? \nREGGIE (looking at the river) I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings. \nDYLE Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list. \nREGGIE Fiction or non-fiction? \nDYLE Why don't you shut up! \nREGGIE Well! \nDYLE Are you going to listen? \nREGGIE Go on. \nDYLE After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible. \nREGGIE I suppose all this is leading somewhere? \nDYLE It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support. \nREGGIE What do you mean? \nDYLE When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss. \nREGGIE (astonished) You mean, you're a thief? \nDYLE Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing. \nREGGIE I don't believe it. \nDYLE Well, I can't really blame you -- not now. \nREGGIE But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua. \nDYLE Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield. \nREGGIE Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more. \nDYLE (now called ADAM) The man's the same, even if the name isn't. \nREGGIE No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face -- \nADAM Oh, come on! \nREGGIE -- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is. \nADAM It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time. \nREGGIE Is there a Mrs. Canfield? \nADAM Yes, but -- \nThe elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He presses the call button and the motor starts. \nAn instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. He is now doubly apoplectic. \nGRANDPIERRE Three of them -- all in their pajamas! C'est ridicule! What is it, some new American fad? \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal REGGIE and ADAM, in their bathrobes. \nGRANDPIERRE And now your friend -- the one from Texas -- he has disappeared -- checked out -- pouf! into thin air! Where is he? \nADAM I don't know. \nGRANDPIERRE Madame? \nREGGIE shrugs. \nGRANDPIERRE Tell me, Mr. Dyle -- where were you at three-thirty? \nADAM In my room, asleep. \nGRANDPIERRE And you, Mrs. Lampert? \nREGGIE I was, too. \nGRANDPIERRE In Mr. Dyle's room? \nREGGIE (bitterly) No -- in my room. \nGRANDPIERRE (pause, lighting cigar) It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story? \nREGGIE and ADAM exchange looks. \nGRANDPIERRE And if I were you, I would not stay in my pajamas. Good night. \nGRANDPIERRE turns and leaves. REGGIE and ADAM start down the hall toward their own rooms. \nADAM That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him. \nREGGIE You're going to look for him -- now? \nADAM If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they? \nREGGIE Adam -- \nADAM There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning. \nADAM disappears into his own room. \nINT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nAs ADAM enters, going to the closet to remove his suit. \nThe phone rings. He answers it. \nADAM Yes? \nINT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT -- TEX. As he speaks on the phone. \nTEX Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day. \nINT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nADAM (on the phone) Where are you, ol' buddy? \nINT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nTEX (on the phone) (laughs) I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. (hangs up) \nINT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nADAM, before hanging up, reflects on TEX's words, then looks behind him. Smiling softly, he hangs up the phone and starts for REGGIE's door. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting door. \nREGGIE What is it? \nADAM Open up. \nShe undoes the bolt and opens the door. ADAM enters. \nADAM I think we were wrong about Tex having the money. \nREGGIE Why? \nADAM I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it. \nREGGIE I've looked, Adam -- you know I have -- \nADAM Where's that airlines bag? \nREGGIE Lord, you're stubborn. \nADAM I sure am. Get it. \nShe goes to the closet and gets the bag. \nADAM Charles must have had the money with him on the train, and Tex missed it. \nHe takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents. \nREGGIE But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it. \nADAM Let's look anyway. \nREGGIE Lord, you're stubborn. \nADAM I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now. \nCLOSE SHOT -- BED WITH CHARLES' BELONGINGS \nADAM'S VOICE (O.S.) Something on that bed is worth a quarter of a million dollars. \nThe FRENCH DELEGATE is speaking. \nFRENCH DELEGATE Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, Messieurs les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s -- mon distingu\u00e9 coll\u00e8gue de la Grande Bretagne -- le probl\u00e8me vu par mon Gouvernement n'est pas aussi simple que nos amis les Anglais voudraient nous le faire croire. Mais leur pays n'est pas, apr\u00e8s tout, un pays agricole, n'est-ce pas? La position fran\u00e7aise, ainsi que nous l'avons soulign\u00e9e dans le rapport num\u00e9ro trente-neuf bar oblique cinquante-deux de la Conf\u00e9rence de l'h\u00e9misph\u00e8re occidental qui a eu lieu le 22 mars -- \nINT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY \nREGGIE is busy translating. \nREGGIE as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March (she stops) no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- \u00c9lys\u00e9es! Adam -- that was it! The garden! \nADAM It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on! \nMED. SHOT -- CONFERENCE TABLE \nFrom REGGIE'S and ADAM'S ANGLE. All the DELEGATES and their AIDES suddenly turn, surprised, and look at CAMERA. \nREVERSE SHOT -- WINDOW \nFrom the DELEGATE'S ANGLE. Inside the booth, REGGIE and ADAM can be seen heading for the door in a hurry. \nMED. SHOT -- CONFERENCE TABLE \nAs the DELEGATES look at one another, confused. \nEXT. GUIGNOL -- LATE AFTERNOON \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM \nBy the locked gate. \nREGGIE Now what? \nADAM Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here. \nREGGIE But Charles' appointment was last week, not -- \nADAM I know, but this is all we've got left. \nREGGIE Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job. \nADAM Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there. \nVARIOUS SHOTS -- WHAT THEY SEE \nA quick succession of shots showing: \n1. Children's Merry-go-round 2. Rond Point de Champs-Elys\u00e9es with fountains playing 3. Children's swings 4. Restaurant Laurent 5. Balloon salesman \nEXT. FOUNTAIN -- LATE AFTERNOON \nADAM stands by the large fountain, staring off at something as REGGIE joins him. \nREGGIE It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for. \nADAM It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either. \nREGGIE Tex? You mean he's here, too? \nADAM Look. \nMED. SHOT -- TEX \nHe stands near the merry-go-round, looking at something in his hand: Charles' agenda. Now he closes it and moves off, disappearing behind a hedge. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM \nADAM I'd better see what he's up to. Stay here -- I won't be long. \nADAM starts off. \nREGGIE (concerned) Be careful, Adam -- please. He's already killed three men. \nDELETED \nEXT. RUE GABRIEL -- LATE AFTERNOON \nBetween the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden booths have been set up. They have collected quite a CROWD. Into this area comes TEX, followed at a safe distance by ADAM. Suddenly TEX stops. \nDELETED \nCLOSE SHOT -- TEX \nAs he stares wide-eyed at something. \nCLOSE SHOT -- STAMPS \nNeatly displayed on a counter of one of the booths. \nCLOSE SHOT -- TEX \nAs he wheels to look at another booth. \nCLOSE SHOT -- MORE STAMPS \nIn another arrangement. \nCLOSE SHOT -- TEX \nHe turns crazily to look at another booth, then another. \nCLOSE SHOT -- EVEN MORE STAMPS \nVarious FLASH SHOTS of stamps of all sizes, shapes and colors. \nMED. SHOT -- TEX \nAs he understands. He turns to rush off and bumps smack into ADAM. TEX is startled. \nTEX Sorry, fella -- \nHe rushes off past ADAM, who watches him for a moment, confused, then turns toward the booth, not yet having seen the stamps. \nMED. SHOT -- BOOTH \nFrom ADAM's angle. There are one or two persons standing at the booth. CAMERA ZOOMS in on the display of stamps. \nCLOSE SHOT -- ADAM \nADAM (amazed) The letter. \nShe rushes to him, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER. JEAN-LOUIS stands looking at some stamps. SYLVIE grabs him. \nSYLVIE Jean-Louis -- les timbr\u00e9s -- o\u00f9 sont- ils? \nSmiling, JEAN-LOUIS holds up an enormous sack of assorted stamps -- hundreds of them. \nSYLVIE Oh, zut! (calling) Reggie -- Reggie -- ! \nREGGIE runs up and joins them. \nREGGIE Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- ! (spotting the sack of stamps) What's that? \nJEAN-LOUIS A man traded with me -- all those for only four. \nREGGIE Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where? \nJEAN-LOUIS looks in one direction, then in the other, trying to remember. \nSYLVIE Vite, mon ange -- vite! \nJEAN-LOUIS L\u00e0 bas -- Monsieur F\u00e9lix. \nThey all run off down the line of booths. JEAN-LOUIS stops and points off. \nJEAN-LOUIS Il est l\u00e0! \nMED. SHOT -- STAMP BOOTH \nClosed, deserted, empty. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS \nJEAN-LOUIS But he is gone. \nREGGIE I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur F\u00e9lix lives? \nJEAN-LOUIS No -- but I will ask. \nHe goes to the closest booth and shakes the coat sleeve of the proprietor. \nJEAN-LOUIS Monsieur Th\u00e9ophile -- \nTH\u00c9OPHILE Oui, jeune homme? \nJEAN-LOUIS Monsieur F\u00e9lix, o\u00f9 habite-il? \nTH\u00c9OPHILE A Montmartre -- demande \u00e0 Monsieur August au Bar des Artistes -- Place Blanche. \nJEAN-LOUIS Merci, Monsieur Th\u00e9ophile. (returning to REGGIE and SYLVIE) He says to ask Monsieur August at the -- \nBefore he can finish, SYLVIE, who has heard TH\u00c9OPHILE, has JEAN-LOUIS by the hand, dragging him off at full speed, REGGIE right alongside. \nDELETED \nINT. F\u00c9LIX'S ROOM -- DUSK \nA bare, unkempt little room. F\u00c9LIX, a man in his sixties, sits at a table, smoking a pipe. There are stamps and albums everywhere. He holds a magnifying glass in his hand, busy studying something on the table. There is a KNOCK. He looks up. Another KNOCK. \nF\u00c9LIX Entrez. \nThe door opens and REGGIE, followed by SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS, enters. \nREGGIE Monsieur F\u00e9lix -- ? \nF\u00c9LIX (without looking up) I was expecting you. You are American too, of course. \nREGGIE (looking at SYLVIE) Yes. \nF\u00c9LIX The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come. \nHe gestures for REGGIE to come closer. Together with SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS, she goes to the table and looks at the stamps. \nF\u00c9LIX Look at them, Madame. \nINSERT -- STAMPS \nFour of them -- a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still attached to the portion of the torn envelope. \nF\u00c9LIX (O.S.) Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful? \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE, F\u00c9LIX, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS \nREGGIE I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps. \nF\u00c9LIX I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854. \nREGGIE How much is it worth? \nF\u00c9LIX The money is unimportant. \nREGGIE I'm afraid it is important. \nF\u00c9LIX (shrugging) In your money, perhaps $65,000. \nREGGIE Do you mind if I sit down? (she sits) What about the blue one? \nF\u00c9LIX It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it. \nREGGIE What's its value today? \nF\u00c9LIX In human life? In greed? In suffering? \nREGGIE In money. \nF\u00c9LIX Forty-five thousand. \nREGGIE (to SYLVIE) Do you have anything to eat? (to F\u00c9LIX) And the orange one -- what about the orange one? \nF\u00c9LIX A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps. \nREGGIE And the last one? \nF\u00c9LIX The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer. (looking at it through the glass) Today it has a value of $100,000. (a pause) Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them. \nREGGIE (hesitating) You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur F\u00e9lix -- are they for sale now? \nF\u00c9LIX (looking at the large bag) Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty. \nREGGIE (fishing money from her purse) Here's ten. \nEXT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT \nA taxi stands by the curb. REGGIE leaves the hotel and runs to it. \nREGGIE (indicating the direction) Palais Royal -- vite! \nCalmly, the DRIVER points to the little printed sign on his windshield reading \"ITALIE.\" \nDRIVER (pointing the other way) Porte d'Italie, moi. \nREGGIE Mais c'est tr\u00e8s vite! On veut me teur! \nDRIVER (shaking his head) Italie. \nShe looks around and sees ADAM come out of the hotel and straight toward her. She turns and runs off toward the Place St. Michel. \nEXT. PLACE ST. MICHEL -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE comes to the corner. She stops, sees the M\u00e9tro station (\"St. Michel\") and rushes to it, scampering down the stairs. ADAM is behind her. \nINT. ST. MICHEL M\u00c9TRO STATION -- NIGHT \nREGGIE comes flying down the stairs and runs past the ticket booth, fishing in her bag for her carnet (booklet of tickets), casting a quick look behind her. CAMERA PANS QUICKLY TO ADAM just coming off the stairs, who runs after her. \nDELETED \nINT. M\u00c9TRO TICKET GATE -- NIGHT \nREGGIE gets to the gate ahead of ADAM and manages to crowd in front of some OTHERS about to pass through. Barely stopping, she holds out her ticket to the GUARD to be punched, then heads down the platform, still running. ADAM gets to the gate but the GUARD stops him as he tries to pass through. \nGUARD Billet, Monsieur. \nADAM (breathless) I don't want to go anywhere -- I'm only trying -- \nGUARD (pointing off) Billet, Monsieur. \nADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT \nCAMERA LEADING REGGIE as she runs -- the passageway is nearly empty. Her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls. \nCLOSE SHOT -- PASSAGEWAY WALL (TRAVELING) \nThe jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly, forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT \nREGGIE stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating two different directions, an arrow for each. \n\"DIRECTION: Pte D'ORL\u00c9ANS Pte DE CLIGNANCOURT-------\" \nChoosing \"Clignancourt,\" she runs off. CAMERA PANS SHARPLY, 180 degrees, to pick up ADAM rounding the corner in hot pursuit. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every few steps.  Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM.  He has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway. \nThey stare at each other for a moment.  Then the bell rings, announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back through the exit behind him. Not knowing what to do, REGGIE looks into the darkness of the tunnel. The approaching train can be heard. \nREGGIE (to herself) Come on -- please -- \nShe turns to look at the gate -- slowly, the pneumatic door starts to close. As it does, the train roars into the station. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT \nThe gate can be seen slowly closing. ADAM runs to it, tries to force it back but cannot. Finally, he jumps up and, commando style, vaults over it. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE is just entering the red center car (the two on either side are dark green). ADAM runs for the red car and just manages to make it as the doors shut in unison, the latches falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing to inform the motor-man to depart. The train starts to move. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO CAR -- NIGHT \nThe entire length of the car separates ADAM and REGGIE. \nFor a moment, their eyes meet, then ADAM starts to weave his way past the other PASSENGERS, on his way to her. \nSuddenly, he is stopped. ADAM turns to see a TRAIN GUARD. \nTRAIN GUARD Billet, Monsieur. \nADAM shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him, but again the TRAIN GUARD stops him. \nTRAIN GUARD Vous \u00eates dans le premier classe, Monsieur. \nADAM What? \nTRAIN GUARD (heavy accent) This car is for first class only -- you have a second-class ticket. \nADAM But that's what they gave me. \nHe tries to pull away from the TRAIN GUARD and finds himself staring into the serious face of a GENDARME. \nGENDARME Monsieur -- ? \nADAM looks at the GENDARME, then at REGGIE. \nINT. \"PALAIS-ROYAL\" M\u00c9TRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT \nAs the TRAIN pulls in and comes to a stop. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO CAR -- NIGHT \nThe GENDARME opens the door for ADAM and escorts him out. \nADAM turns once more to look at REGGIE as he goes. She remains in the car. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT \nThe GENDARME gestures for ADAM to enter the green, second- class car behind the red, first-class one. Reluctantly, ADAM does. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO CAR -- NIGHT \nAs ADAM enters and goes to the door through which he can see REGGIE in the car ahead. She is gone. Moving quickly, he returns to the exit door and looks at the platform. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT \nFrom ADAM'S P.O.V. She is hurrying toward an exit marked \"SORTIE.\" \nADAM Reggie -- please believe me! \nREGGIE No! \nAs REGGIE wearily gains the top, ADAM lunges for her. He manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand. \nREGGIE shrieks, then regaining her balance, continues running, limping in her one shoe. ADAM scrambles to his feet and starts after her again. \nINT. M\u00c9TRO TICKET BOOTH AREA -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE, still hobbling, runs through and toward the stairs, leading to the street. CAMERA PANS TO ADAM, as he, too, runs through. He is again several yards behind her. \nEXT. PLACE PALAIS ROYAL -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE comes up the stairs from the M\u00e9tro. She stops long enough to kick off her other shoe, then runs across the street, ignoring the traffic, toward the Rue de Valois (which forms one side of the Palais Royal). ADAM is gaining on her again. \nEXT. PALAIS ROYAL COURTYARD -- COLONNADE -- NIGHT \nThe smaller court at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise end of the Palais gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each -- in all, eighty columns. The only person in sight is the man we have known as BARTHOLOMEW, waiting at the far end of the columns, looking at his watch impatiently. \nThen, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs into the court. She spots \"BARTHOLOMEW\" and fishes in her bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving them. \nREGGIE Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me! \nADAM has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the near end of the colonnade as he spots \"BARTHOLOMEW.\" REGGIE, still running, is halfway between the two men. \"BARTHOLOMEW\" draws his gun but can't get a shot at ADAM, who has ducked in among the columns. \nADAM Reggie -- stop! That's Carson Dyle! \nThis news hits REGGIE hard and she stops, in alarm. \nREGGIE (breathless) Carson -- ? \nShe looks at \"BARTHOLOMEW,\" then back at ADAM, who has drawn his own gun. \n(NOTE: Both \"BARTHOLOMEW\" and ADAM are in among the stone columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of each other's sight. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to). \n\"BARTHOLOMEW\" (calmly) We all know Carson Dyle is dead, Mrs. Lampert. \nADAM It's Carson Dyle, I tell you! \n\"BARTHOLOMEW\" You're not going to believe him, Mrs. Lampert -- it's too fantastic. He's trying to trick you again. \nREGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do. \nADAM Tex recognized him -- that's why he said Dyle. If you give him those stamps, he'll kill you too! \nREGGIE takes a step toward ADAM. \n\"BARTHOLOMEW\" Mrs. Lampert -- if I'm who he said, what's preventing me from killing you right now? \nREGGIE stops, turns back to \"BARTHOLOMEW.\" \nADAM Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps -- he knows he'd never make it. \n\"BARTHOLOMEW\" What's the matter with you, Mrs. Lampert? Are you going to believe every lie he tells you? He wants the money for himself -- that's all he's ever wanted. \nREGGIE (to ADAM, explaining) He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy. \nADAM Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle! \n\"BARTHOLOMEW\" That's right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm a dead man -- look at me. \nREGGIE I don't know who anybody is any more! \nADAM Reggie -- listen to me! \nREGGIE You lied to me so many times -- \nADAM (gently) Reggie -- trust me once more -- please. \nREGGIE Can I really believe you this time, Adam? \nADAM (a pause) There's not a reason on earth why you should. \nShe looks toward ADAM for a moment, then back to \"BARTHOLOMEW\", then slowly starts toward ADAM. \nREGGIE All right, Adam. \n\"BARTHOLOMEW\" Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or I'll kill you. \nREGGIE stops in alarm. \nADAM It won't get you the stamps, Dyle -- You'll have to come out to get them, and I'm not likely to miss at this range. \n\"BARTHOLOMEW\" (now called CARSON) Maybe not -- but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me. They left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach -- they knew I was still alive but they left me. I spent ten months in a German camp -- with nothing to stop the pain and no food -- they were willing to take all these chances for the money, but not for me. They deserved to die! \nMED. SHOT -- ADAM \nDuring the following, he looks around, looking for some way out. \nREGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) But I didn't have anything to do with -- \nCARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) You've got the money. It belongs to me now! Please believe me, Mrs. Lampert -- I'll kill you -- a little more blood won't matter. \nDuring this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally, behind the second. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND CARSON \nCARSON I'll give you five to make up your mind, Mrs. Lampert. \nShe has seen ADAM's move from her angle, but doesn't know quite what to do. \nREGGIE Wait, please! I need some time to think! \nCARSON One -- \nMED. SHOT -- ADAM \nAs he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade, his gun ready, trying to get an angle on CARSON. \nCARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) -- two -- \nSuddenly ADAM stops -- he has caught sight of CARSON through the columns. But he will have a difficult shot. \nCARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) -- three -- \nCLOSE SHOT -- CARSON \nCARSON -- four -- \nCARSON Did you hear me, Mrs. Lampert -- ? \nINT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT \nREGGIE huddled inside. \nINT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT \nADAM is listening carefully, trying to figure out where CARSON is standing, watching the ceiling. \nCLOSE SHOT -- TRAP \nIt is marked C-4. \nCARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) I won't wait much longer, Mrs. Lampert \nMED. SHOT -- ADAM \nAs he turns to the levers and reaches for the one marked C- 4. He is about to pull it. \nINT. COM\u00c9DIE FRAN\u00c7AISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT \nCARSON takes a few more steps forward. \nINT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT \nADAM stops himself from pulling the lever just in time. He lets his held breath escape. He looks back at the ceiling. \nCLOSE SHOT -- TRAP \nThe one marked C-4. As CARSON's voice is heard, CAMERA MOVES to the next trap, marked D-4. \nCARSON'S VOICE (O.S.) I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert -- \nMED. SHOT -- ADAM \nHe looks at the lever marked D-4. He is perspiring heavily. \nNow he slowly reaches for the lever. \nINT. COM\u00c9DIE FRAN\u00c7AISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT \nCARSON is about to move closer to the prompter's box when suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through out of sight. At the same time we hear a shot. \nCLOSE SHOT -- PROMPTER'S BOX \nAs REGGIE slowly peers out. \nREGGIE'S P.O.V. \nThe empty stage, without being able to see the open trap from this low angle. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE \nAs she climbs out of the booth and, seeing the open trap now, runs to it, looking down through it. \nMED. SHOT -- OPEN TRAP \nFROM ABOVE, over REGGIE's head. She can see CARSON sprawled on the floor below, face down and dead. ADAM stands beside the body, looking up at REGGIE and smiling. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs GRANDPIERRE and his TWO ASSISTANTS, guns drawn, walk onto the stage from the wings. They go to the open trap and look down at ADAM. \nGRANDPIERRE Mr. Dyle -- you are under arrest for the murders of Charles Lampert, Herman Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold Gideon, and whoever that is down there. \nADAM is surprised, then shakes his head. \nADAM Reggie -- you'd better tell him. He wouldn't dare hit a girl. \nEXT. RUE DE RIVOLI -- NIGHT \nAs a TAXI rolls by the arcades, CAMERA PANNING with it. \nINT. TAXI -- NIGHT (PROCESS) \nREGGIE and ADAM in the rear of the cab. REGGIE has one of her feet in her hand, shoe off, rubbing it. \nREGGIE You didn't have to chase me so hard -- \nADAM Here, give it to me. \nHe starts to take the foot but she pulls it back and offers him the other one. \nREGGIE That one's done -- start on this one. \nHe takes the foot and begins rubbing it. \nREGGIE I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are? \nADAM And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide. \nREGGIE The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps? \nADAM What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that? \nREGGIE All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps. \nADAM says nothing. \nREGGIE I said, tell me to go to the -- \nADAM I heard you, I heard you. \nREGGIE Then say it. \nADAM Reggie -- listen to me -- \nREGGIE Never mind -- I'll go by myself. \nADAM What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer -- \nEXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY -- MAIN ENTRANCE -- DAY \nAs REGGIE and ADAM approach the MARINE in full-dress uniform always on guard at the Embassy. \nREGGIE (to ADAM) Who's a taxpayer? Crooks don't pay taxes.  Excuse me, soldier -- \nMARINE Marine, ma'am. \n", "test1_input": "REGGIE (into 'phone) Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie Lampert -- listen Mr. Bartholomew: I've seen one of the (she stops) Mr. Bartholomew? Can you hear me? \nShe realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice. \nREGGIE Hello -- Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Regina Lam... \nSuddenly the door of the booth opens and REGGIE wheels to look, slamming the receiver down as she does. \nREVERSE SHOT -- 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nTEX PENTHOLLOW, the second man from the funeral (and photo), the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in his mouth. He has put one foot up against the side of the door so she can't leave. REGGIE stares at him, terrified. \nTEX Howdy, Miz Lampert. \nREGGIE Wha -- what do you want? \nTEX takes a book of matches from his pocket. \nTEX You know what I want, Miz Lampert... \nREGGIE No -- no, I'm don't. \nTEX Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob! \nHe strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the burning match in his hand afterward. \nREGGIE I don't know what -- \nTEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically. \nREGGIE What are you doing? \nTEX lights another match and throws it into her lap. She beats this one out too. \nREGGIE Stop that! \nTEX Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert -- \nHe lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with it. She shrinks back. \nTEX It could get a whole lot worse. \nThen he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE is too busy beating them out to do anything else. \nTEX It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert? \nREGGIE Please stop -- please! \nTEX You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear? \nCLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE \nAs she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her work. \nREGGIE You're insane, absolutely insane! \nShe looks up, then blinks her eyes. \nINT. 'PHONE BOOTH OVER REGGIE'S SHOULDER \nThere is no one there. REGGIE rises and steps out of the booth. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE looks around. There is no one there. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH \nAs REGGIE returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into the slot. She notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her eyes. \nSuddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks -- but this time it is PETER. \nPETER What are you doing in here? \nREGGIE (a sigh of relief) Having a nervous breakdown. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT \nREGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby. \nPETER You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there? \nREGGIE I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not. \nPETER I don't think I follow you. \nREGGIE He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me. \nPETER Who said? \nREGGIE That's what I'm not supposed to say. \nPETER Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it. \nREGGIE Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me. \nPETER I wasn't -- \nREGGIE Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime. \nShe goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT CLERK greets them sleepily. \nNIGHT CLERK Bonsoir. \nREGGIE Bonsoir. Quarante-deux, s'il vous plait. \nThe NIGHT CLERK gets the key off a hook and hands it to REGGIE. \nNIGHT CLERK Bonne nuit. \nREGGIE (to PETER) Would you mind seeing me to the door? \nPETER Of course not. \nThey go to the elevator where he opens the door for her. \nINT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage. It is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together. \n", "test1_true": "He presses the button and the elevator starts to rise. \nPETER You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something. \nREGGIE (busy examining the cleft in his chin) How do you shave in there? \nPETER What was it? \nREGGIE What was what? \nPETER What your husband was mixed up in. \nREGGIE Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a -- \nPETER Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor? \nThe elevator stops. \nPETER We're here. \nREGGIE Where? \nPETER On the street where you live. \nREGGIE How about once more around the park? \nHe reaches across her and opens the door. \nPETER Out. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE leaves the elevator, followed by PETER. They walk to her door. There is a moment of silence as she looks at him. \nREGGIE (imitating PETER) Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.' \nPETER How would you like a spanking? \nREGGIE How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child. \nPETER Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed. \nREGGIE Do you know what's wrong with you? \nPETER What? \nREGGIE Nothing. Good night. \nPETER Good night. \nHe turns and leaves. She smiles slightly, then turns and puts the key into the door and opens it. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nFeaturing the door. REGGIE enters, then stops abruptly, the doorknob still in her hand. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe room has been torn apart. And standing in the center is HERMAN SCOBIE, the large man in the battered raincoat. \nHe starts slowly advancing toward REGGIE. \nSCOBIE Where is it, lady -- where've you got it? \nCLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE \nREGGIE (terrified) I don't know -- I don't know! I don't -- \nShe stops as she sees something. \nCLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND \nInstead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one. \nWIDER ANGLE \nSCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike. \nSCOBIE I want it -- give it to me -- it's mine! \nThe hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly, turns and flies out. \nREGGIE (screaming) Peter -- ! Peter -- ! \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding claw. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs PETER comes running up to her. He sees the metal hand. \nREGGIE A man -- he tried to kill me! \nPulling her aside, PETER takes hold of the key (still in the outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly. Then, using all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, making sure to hold it that way as he steps in. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nInside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free. \nHe then rushes to the open window and climbs out. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT \nREGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly looks into the room. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE (entering cautiously) Peter -- ? (alarmed) Peter! Where are you? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nShowing the disarranged room, empty of people. Then, slowly PETER's hand appears from behind the bed, shaking groggily. \nREGGIE rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed. \nREGGIE Peter -- are you all right? \nPETER I think I sprained my pride. (He looks around) Where'd he go? \n", "test1_id": 3138, "test2_input": "REGGIE Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him. \nPETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks out. He then turns back. \nPETER Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute. \nREGGIE Be careful, Peter. \nPETER (one leg over the sill) You took the words right out of my mouth. \nHe climbs out. \nEXT. HOTEL WINDOW THIRD FLOOR -- NIGHT \nOutside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony, consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears and looks down over the railing. \nEXT. HOTEL SIDEWALK (FROM ABOVE) -- NIGHT \nSHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it is too far to jump. \nMED. SHOT -- PETER -- BALCONY \nHe now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on one side, but there are two or three on the other. \nPETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony. \nCLOSE SHOT -- PETER'S HAND \nAs it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short of touching it. \nMED. SHOT -- PETER \nAs he straightens up and prepares to jump. \nEXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT \nFrom the GROUND. PETER, high above, jumps to the next balcony. \nMED. SHOT -- PETER \nAs he climbs over the railing of the second balcony. He sees a light coming through the window and looks in. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Oh! \nPETER leaves the window quickly, climbing over the railing on his way to the next balcony. As he does, the following exchange is heard (in British English). \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) What is it now, Pamela? \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) It happened again, Henry -- another strange man peered in the window at me and then went away. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Bad luck, Pamela. \nEXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT \nFrom the GROUND as PETER jumps to the next balcony. \nMED. SHOT -- PETER \nAs he climbs over the rail to the third balcony. There is a light coming from this window, too. PETER looks in. \nMED. SHOT -- WINDOW -- OVER PETER'S SHOULDER \nInside the room are GIDEON, TEX, and SCOBIE in the midst of a heated discussion. \nGIDEON That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move. \nTEX And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy -- \nINT. GIDEON'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT \nTEX -- but sneakin' in there on your own that-a-way, why, man, you was bound to get yore tokus kicked. I mean, what'd you think he'd do -- walk up 'n' shake you by that hand o' yores? \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) That's right, Herman -- you didn't leave me much choice. \nThey all turn toward the window. \nWIDER ANGLE \nAs PETER climbs in through the window and joins them. \nPETER (to SCOBIE) I didn't hurt you, did I? \nSCOBIE shakes his head and turns away. \nGIDEON (eagerly) Never mind that -- did you get the money? \nPETER How could I with the three Marx Brothers breathing down my neck? You said you'd let me handle it alone -- ! The girl trusts me. If she's got it, I'll find out about it. But you've got to leave me alone. \nSCOBIE (to GIDEON and TEX) We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him! \nTEX Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor. \nSCOBIE Yeah? What's that? \nTEX He took care of Charlie for us. \nGIDEON (to PETER) We appreciate it, really we do. \nSCOBIE But who asked him? Three shares are enough -- I'd say he's out! \nPETER A third of nothing is nothing, Herman. Make up your minds -- she's waiting for me. \nGIDEON (thoughtfully) I don't see how another twenty-four hours could hurt. \nTEX Shoot no, not after all these years. \nSCOBIE Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine! \nSCOBIE turns and storms out of the door, slamming it. \nGIDEON begins sneezing, takes a bottle of pills from his pocket and swallows two white tablets. \nGIDEON I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success. \nTEX (chuckling) That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly. \nPETER Who's got the room next to hers? \nTEX Me. How come? \n", "test2_true": "PETER starts for the door. \nTEX If you do find the money -- you won't forget t' tell us about it, will you, fella? \nPETER (turning at the door) Don't worry. \nTEX Oh, I ain't worryin' -- but see this pudgy little fella here? (indicating GIDEON) He worries -- an' he's even meaner'n I am. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nAs she waits anxiously, smoking a cigarette. There is a KNOCK at the door. \nREGGIE Who is it? \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) It's me. Peter. \nREGGIE unlocks the door and opens it. PETER enters and she closes the door again -- \nPETER There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about. \nREGGIE There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them. \nPETER What? \nREGGIE A quarter of a million dollars. \nPETER is silent for a moment. \nPETER Go on. \nREGGIE That's all. \nPETER No, it isn't -- where's the money? \nREGGIE I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train. \nPETER So they think he left it with you. \nREGGIE But he didn't! I've looked everywhere -- (tears welling) And if I don't find it -- (wailing) Those men going to kill me. \nShe falls in his arms to be comforted. \nPETER No, they won't -- I won't let them. \nREGGIE (sobbing) Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust. \nPETER Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now -- \nHe takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes. \nREGGIE I'm so hungry I could faint. (trying to smile) I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet. \nPETER That's all right -- it's a drip-dry. \nREGGIE Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies? \nPETER Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them. \nREGGIE Do you tell lies? \nA pause. The phone rings. REGGIE answers it. \nREGGIE (into the phone) Hello? \nINT. OUTDOOR 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nSCOBIE holds the receiver in his metal hand. \nSCOBIE Mrs. Lampert? -- it's me -- the man who was in your room a few minutes ago -- \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE (on the phone) What do you want? \nPETER (whispering) Who is it? \nREGGIE (covering the receiver) The man you had the fight with. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nSCOBIE (on the phone) Is Dyle with you? \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE \nREGGIE Who? \nINT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nSCOBIE (on the phone) The man who hit me, lady -- Dyle -- that's his name. What's wrong -- is he still there? \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE's back is turned to PETER so he can't see her face. \nHe watches her. \nREGGIE (on the phone) Yes -- that's right. \nPETER What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying? \nShe shakes her head. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nSCOBIE (on the phone) Don't trust him -- don't tell him anything. He's after the money. \nHe hangs up. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nSlowly, REGGIE lowers the 'phone from her ear and hangs it up.  She hesitates a moment. \nPETER What'd he say? \nREGGIE He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me. \nPETER I wouldn't take that too seriously. \n", "test2_id": 3139, "test3_input": "REGGIE I believe what he said. \nPETER They're only trying to scare you, that's all. \nREGGIE How do you know what they're doing? \nPETER I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it -- \nREGGIE What are you talking about? \nPETER You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words. \nREGGIE (softly) Words can hurt very much. \nPETER (a pause) Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning. \nREGGIE Don't put yourself out. \nPETER Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that. \nREGGIE Yes, I'll remember. Good night. \nPETER Good night. \nHe starts out, pausing by the door and examining the hole SCOBIE made in it. \nPETER But if you'll take my advice -- (smiling) You'll undress in the closet. Oh, and if you need me, just bang on the wall. I'll be next door. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT \nAs PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it underneath. \nINT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nAs DYLE enters, the thread in his hand. He goes to a nearby table where he attaches the thread to the heavy room key, which he then balances on the extreme edge of the table. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE is on the phone. \nREGGIE (excited) -- But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew -- what I called to tell you was there's someone else -- someone who wasn't in that photograph you showed me. He says his name is Peter Joshua -- but it isn't -- it's Dyle. (a pause) Mr. Bartholomew? -- are you still there? \nINT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nBARTHOLOMEW on the phone. He is silent for a moment, his face troubled. \nBARTHOLOMEW I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE (on the phone) You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me! \nDELETED \nINT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nBARTHOLOMEW (on the phone) Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles? \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE (on the phone) Yes, where? (a pause) -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there. \nDELETED \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE hangs up the phone, picks up her bag, checks her hair in the mirror, then starts for the door. She stops as she notices the connecting door leading to the room next door, DYLE's room. She goes to it, silently slips out the key and bends to peer through the keyhole. \nINT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT (THROUGH KEYHOLE) \nDYLE is removing his coat. Before he lays it over a chair, he takes a gun from the inside pocket, checks it, and tucks it into his belt. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE reacts in surprise and fright, jumps quickly away from the door. She hurries to the door leading to the hall and reaches for the knob. \nINT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT -- ROOM KEY. The thread attached to it is pulled (by the action of REGGIE's door opening) and the key falls to the floor with a clatter. \nWIDE ANGLE \nIncluding DYLE as he reacts, his head wheeling to look at the key. Snatching his coat, he runs for the door. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE sneaks past DYLE's door. When she has passed, the door opens and DYLE appears. REGGIE takes off on the run, turning the corner and starting down the stairs. \nDYLE Reggie -- ! \nHe starts after her. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT \nIt is deserted, except for the sleeping NIGHT PORTER, as REGGIE comes running down the stairs. \nDYLE'S VOICE (O.S.) Reggie... ! \nShe turns, looking back towards the sound of his voice, but does not slacken her speed. She runs out the front door. \nEXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE runs out. She looks up the street, sees a TAXI and hails it. \nREGGIE Taxi -- ! \nIt pulls over to the curb. Looking once more over her shoulder she takes a bill out of her pocket, opens the cab door, slams it loudly without getting in and hands the bill to the driver. \nREGGIE N'importe o\u00f9 -- vite! Allez-y! \nShe jumps back into the shadows of a nearby doorway as the TAXI pulls away. At the same time DYLE runs out of the hotel. Another TAXI is coming down the street. DYLE hails it frantically. \nDYLE Taxi -- ! Taxi -- ! \nIt pulls up and DYLE opens the door. \nDYLE (pointing) Follow that taxi. \nDRIVER Comment? \n", "test3_true": "DRIVER Je ne comprends rien. \nDesperately, DYLE reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a small dictionary and begins flipping through the pages. \nCLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE \nIn the shadows. She lifts her eyes in annoyance. \nMED. SHOT -- TAXI \nDYLE (finding the word) Suivre -- el taxi! \nDRIVER Ah! Oui, Monsieur. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nREGGIE comes out of the shadows, looks after DYLE's taxi, then hails another one which pulls up. \nREGGIE (to DRIVER) Aux Halles -- vite! \nDELETED \nEXT. LES HALLES -- NIGHT \nREGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW walking. The Central Market is teeming with activity -- trucks creeping around other trucks, cases of fruit and vegetables stacked on every inch of sidewalk, WORKERS of all types milling around, unloading trucks and stacking crates, little electric carts scooting in and out -- and nearby, one of the huge, high-roofed sheds where the butchers work. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW \nCAMERA LEADING them as they walk. \nBARTHOLOMEW (looking around) Incredible, isn't it? Zola called it 'le ventre de Paris' -- the womb of Paris, the belly. \nShe takes a banana from a nearby stall. \nREGGIE (peeling it) What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew? \nBARTHOLOMEW (leaves a coin on the crate) Were you followed? \nREGGIE Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies. \nBARTHOLOMEW Agents. \nREGGIE He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it. \nBARTHOLOMEW Who? \nREGGIE Dyle, or whatever his name is. \nBARTHOLOMEW What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert? \nREGGIE He's hardly my Mr. Dyle. \nBARTHOLOMEW Describe him. \nREGGIE Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really. \nBARTHOLOMEW (shaking his head) No. \nREGGIE No, what? \nBARTHOLOMEW That's not Carson Dyle. \nREGGIE (stopping) Carson? \nBARTHOLOMEW There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson. \nREGGIE You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me? \nBARTHOLOMEW looks at her for a moment, then glances around; his attention is drawn inside the doorway. \nBARTHOLOMEW It's enough to make you a vegetarian, isn't it? \nINT. LES HALLES BUTCHERS' SHED -- NIGHT \nAlmost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides, hung on hooks. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW (TRAVELING) \nAs REGGIE looks at the hanging beef. \nREGGIE It's just lucky that I'm not hanging next to one of those things right now. \nShe shudders, throws away her banana and turns back to BARTHOLOMEW. \nREGGIE Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle? \nBARTHOLOMEW I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead. \nREGGIE Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about. \nDELETED \nINT. LES HALLES BISTRO -- NIGHT \nLined up at a zinc bar are several BUTCHERS, their white smocks stained with blood. REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW sit at the table. \nBARTHOLOMEW I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two? \nREGGIE Barely, yes. \nBARTHOLOMEW In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men -- \nA WAITER arrives. \nWAITER Vous d\u00e9sirez? \nREGGIE (smiling) They always do that. \nBARTHOLOMEW (to the WAITER) Caf\u00e9. \nREGGIE Gratin\u00e9e, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge. \nBARTHOLOMEW Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here. \nREGGIE Can I at least keep the onion soup? \nBARTHOLOMEW shrugs. \nREGGIE (to the WAITER) La soupe tout simplement. \n", "test3_id": 3140}

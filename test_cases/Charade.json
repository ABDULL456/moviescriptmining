{"test1_input": "CHARADE \nWritten by \nPeter Stone \nBased on a story by \nPeter Stone and Marc Behm \nOctober 1st, 1962 \nFADE IN (BEFORE TITLES) \nEXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK \nSilence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking. \nCAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and louder until the sound of a train can be recognized. \nCAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is upon us, flashing by with a roar. \nThen, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the thick underbrush alongside the tracks. \nCLOSE SHOT -- BODY \nIt lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the train fades off until there is silence once more. \nTITLE MUSIC begins with a crash. \n(MAIN TITLES) \nDELETED \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MEGEVE -- DAY \nA handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck -- tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers. \nOne of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl. \nShe is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite activity -- eating. \nThen -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, black and ugly in the sunlight. \nREGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat. \nThe finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight into REGGIE's face. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nIncluding JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks at him sternly. \nJEAN-LOUIS (in for trouble) Oh, la. \nREGGIE Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded. (calling) Sylvie! \nWIDER ANGLE \nSYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS. \nREGGIE Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche? \nSYLVIE (to JEAN-LOUIS) Va jouer, mon ange. \nJEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee. \nSYLVIE When you start to eat like this something is the matter. \nNo answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as REGGIE continues eating. \nREGGIE Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce. \nSYLVIE \u00c7a alors! From Charles? \nREGGIE He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but -- \nSYLVIE But what? \nREGGIE I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable. \nREGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards the devastated table before following. \nSYLVIE It is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat! \nINT. SWIMMING POOL -- DAY \nA magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow- covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their conversation continuing. \nSYLVIE But why do you want a divorce? \nREGGIE Because I don't love him. \nSYLVIE But that is no reason to get a divorce! \nEXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY \nAn open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun- worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear, their conversation continuing. \nSYLVIE With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends. \nREGGIE (sitting) I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial, \nbut that doesn't mean I'm ready for French Traditional. I loathe the idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if only Charles had been honest with me -- that's all I ask of anybody -- the simple truth. But with him, everything is secrecy and lies. He's hiding something -- something frightening -- something terrible -- and evil. \nShe stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over her. She wheels, terrified. \nCLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASK \nA strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this particular mask stare down at REGGIE. \nMAN Does this belong to you? \nCAMERA PANS down to include JEAN-LOUIS, his hand held firmly by the man in the mask. \nWIDER ANGLE \nIncluding REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE is too terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA, takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face. \n", "test1_true": "REGGIE (indicating SYLVIE) It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank? \nPETER He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild. (a pause) We don't know each other, do we? \nREGGIE Why, do you think we're going to? \nPETER I don't know -- how would I know? \nREGGIE I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else. \nPETER (smiling) Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list (he starts off) \nREGGIE Quitter. \nPETER (turning) How's that? \nREGGIE You give up awfully easy, don't you? \nEyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation and rises. \nSYLVIE Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a walk. I have never seen a Rothschild before. \nSYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS start off, but not before the boy squirts PETER with his pistol. \nPETER (drying) Clever fellow -- almost missed me. \nREGGIE I'm afraid you're blocking my view. \nPETER (moving) Sorry. Which view would you like? \nREGGIE The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name? \nPETER Peter Joshua. \nREGGIE I'm Regina Lampert. \nPETER Is there a Mr. Lampert? \nREGGIE Yes. \nPETER Good for you. \nREGGIE No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce. \nPETER Please, not on my account. \nREGGIE No, you see, I don't really love him. \nPETER Well, you're honest, anyway. \nREGGIE Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore. \nPETER I'm not sure I -- \nREGGIE Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is. \nPETER Oh. I guess. \nREGGIE Is there a Mrs. Joshua? \nPETER Yes, but we're divorced. \nREGGIE That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious. \nPETER Is your husband with you? \nREGGIE Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete? \nPETER Mr. Joshua. (turning to go) Well, I've enjoyed talking with you. \nREGGIE Now you're angry. \nPETER No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today. \nREGGIE Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: \"When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again\"? \nPETER Shakespeare never said that. \nREGGIE How do you know? \nPETER It's terrible -- you just made it up. \nREGGIE Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me? \nPETER Are you in the book? \nREGGIE Charles is. \nPETER Is there only one Charles Lampert? \nDELETED \nCLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE \nHer face clouding. \nREGGIE Lord, I hope so. \nEXT. AVENUE FOCH -- LAMPERT APARTMENT HOUSE -- DAY \nThe Arc de Triomphe at the far end of the Avenue. CAMERA PANS to pick up a TAXI as it pulls up before the handsome building. Inside are REGGIE, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. \nMED. SHOT -- TAXI -- LAMPERT APARTMENT HOUSE \nAs REGGIE climbs out and the DRIVER begins unloading her suitcases. \nREGGIE Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks. (She turns toward the house) \nJEAN-LOUIS sticks his head out of the taxi window. \nJEAN-LOUIS When you get your divorce will you be going back to America? \nMED. SHOT -- THE TAXI \nREGGIE looks at SYLVIE, surprised. \nSYLVIE He knows everything. \nREGGIE (to JEAN-LOUIS) Don't you want me to stay? \n", "test1_id": 3138, "test2_input": "EXT. ESPLANADE DES CHAMPS-ELY\u00c9ES -- DAY \nMED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL. \nOne of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde. At the moment, Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard. \nVARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN \nSitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. Their attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE \nSitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin. \nAfter a moment, PETER comes up behind her and, stepping over the benches, sits beside her. She doesn't seem to notice. \n[Throughout the following scene the CHILDREN and the ACTORS can be heard in the b.g.] \nPETER Reggie -- ? \nShe turns and looks at him for a moment. \nREGGIE (vaguely) Hallo, Peter. \nPETER You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you. \nREGGIE I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing. \nA ROAR from the CHILDREN. REGGIE and PETER turn toward the stage. \nMED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL \nPUNCH and JUDY are arguing loudly. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER \nPETER What's going on? \nREGGIE Don't you understand French? \nPETER I'm still having trouble with English. \nREGGIE The man and the woman are married -- \nCLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE \nPUNCH and JUDY are batting each other on the head. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) Yes, I can see that -- they're batting each other over the head with clubs. \nFinally, JUDY knocks Punch out of sight and a PUPPET wearing a three-cornered hat appears. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) Who's that with the hat? \nMED SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE \nWearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching. \nREGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) That's the policeman -- he wants to arrest Judy for killing Punch. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE \nJUDY and the POLICEMAN are batting one another. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) What's she saying now? \nREGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) That she's innocent -- she didn't do it. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) She did it, all right -- take it from me. \nREGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) I believe her. \nPUNCH's head appears on the other side of the stage, says something, then ducks out. \nPETER'S VOICE (O.S.) Who was that? \nREGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.) Punch, of course. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER \nPETER Of course? I thought he was dead. \nREGGIE He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only -- (her face clouding) only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do? \nCharles was mixed up in something terrible. \nPETER I wish you'd let me help you. Whatever it is, it doesn't sound like the sort of thing that a woman can handle all by herself. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE \nJUDY has gotten the upper hand is now batting the POLICEMAN's brains out. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE as he winces. \nTWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER \nPETER Have you got a mirror? (she nods) Give it to me. \nShe hands it to him and he holds it in front of her face. \nPETER Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up? \nREGGIE (jumping at the suggesting) Starting tonight? \nINT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT \nMED. SHOT -- EMCEE. \nHe stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece Latin dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional smile as he speaks into a mike. \nEMCEE Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good evening ladies and gentlemen, guten Abend, meine Damen und Herren -- ce soir, comme tous les soirs, l'attraction ici, au Black Sheep Club, c'est vous! Venez, mesdames et messieurs, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, kommen Sie her, meine Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e signori -- avanti! \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER \nAt their table. REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress. \nPETER What was all that? \nREGGIE Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow. \n", "test2_true": "REGGIE No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti! \nShe rises and pulls him along. \nWIDE ANGLE \nIncluding the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it, laughing self-consciously and looking around. \nEMCEE \u00c9coutez bien -- les r\u00e8gles sont tres simples -- the rules are very easy -- deux \u00e9quipes -- two teams -- each with one orange -- une orange -- eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia -- held under the chin, like so -- (does it) comme \u00e7a -- and passed to the player behind you -- sans vous servir de vos mains -- using nothing but the chin -- no hands -- and keeping the orange at all costs from touching the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et Messieurs -- begin, ladies and gentlemen -- signore e signori, comminciate! \nThe EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line. \nThen the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using their hands. \n(This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co- ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be a torment for total strangers and/or the English). \nVARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME \nSome of the couples in various states of confusion, entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, hilarious. \nTWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL \nIt is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber the game but increase his worldly experience. \nThe contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after it. \nCLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE \nShe is enjoying it thoroughly. \nTWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL \nBending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, PETER makes a last valiant effort and voil\u00e0, grips the orange under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations from members of his TEAM. \nNow he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment. \nPETER En garde. \nREGGIE Lay on, MacDuff. \nThey go at it, working their bodies together to make it all possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they are too good despite themselves and the transfer is accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM. \nREGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON, the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in BARTHOLOMEW's photo. \nREGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly. \nPutting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly in REGGIE's ear. \nCLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON \nHer eyes show her fright as he whispers: \nGIDEON Mrs. Lampert -- \nREGGIE What do you want? \nGIDEON Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert? \nREGGIE Tell me what? \nGIDEON It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you? \nREGGIE I don't know anything. \nGIDEON Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead. \nREGGIE Leave me alone -- ! \nGIDEON Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert -- \nREGGIE (SHOUTING) Stop it! \nCLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE'S AND GIDEON'S FEET \nAs REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON \nHe stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he merely closes his eyes. \nWIDER ANGLE \nIncluding REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward. \nPETER Reggie -- what's the trouble? \nREGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance. \nShe steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him for a moment. \nREGGIE He -- he was stepping on my foot. \nCLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON \nSlowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange. \nGIDEON Forgive me -- it was quite unintentional, I'm sure. \nWIDER ANGLE \nGIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes. \nREGGIE (starting off) Wait for me -- I won't be long. \nShe goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a flight of stairs. \nCLOSE SHOT -- PETER \nWatching her go, a concerned look on his face. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT \nA small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's- women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door. \nThe music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light and closing the door after her. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nREGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers. \n", "test2_id": 3139, "test3_input": "REGGIE Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are. \nDYLE But you know my name -- it's Dyle. \nREGGIE Carson Dyle is dead. \nDYLE Yes, he is. He was my brother. \nREGGIE Your -- \nDYLE The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that. \nREGGIE How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it? (pause) Aren't you going to tell me? (pause) Hello -- ? \nShe opens the door of the cabin and starts out. \nMED. SHOT -- PHONE CABINS \nAs REGGIE steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the others. They are all occupied except one and she looks inside it. \nCLOSE SHOT -- EMPTY CABIN \nThe receiver hangs by its cord, swinging back and forth. \nMED. SHOT -- REGGIE \nAs she looks at it, confused. \nINT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- DAY \nDYLE and SCOBIE stand together, waiting for the elevator, SCOBIE clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat. \nSCOBIE (quietly) If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay? \nDYLE You'll wreck your raincoat. \nThe self-service elevator doors open, one or two PASSENGERS come out and DYLE and SCOBIE enter. A young GIRL starts in after them. \nSCOBIE Next car, please. \nHe reaches out and presses the top button with his metal hand. The doors close. \nDELETED \nINT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON \nAs SCOBIE follows DYLE out of the elevator. SCOBIE looks around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall. He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door, which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs, leading up to a second floor. \nSCOBIE Okay -- turn around. \nDYLE turns to find SCOBIE's gun out of the pocket and pointing at him. SCOBIE now transfers it to his metal hand and goes to DYLE, where he proceeds to frisk him. \nFinding the gun DYLE carries in his inside coat pocket, SCOBIE removes it. During the following conversation he will shake open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to DYLE. Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand. \nSCOBIE Sit down. \nShrugging, DYLE sits on the third step. \nDYLE What now? \nSCOBIE We wait -- with our mouths shut. \nINT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- NIGHT \nThe last EMPLOYEES leave the building as the WATCHMAN locks the front door after them. \nINT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT \nIn the semi-darkness, DYLE is still sitting on the third step, SCOBIE still facing him with a gun. \nDYLE How long do you intend -- ? \nSCOBIE I said with the mouth shut. \nDYLE yawns wide. \nDYLE Sorry about that. \nSCOBIE Okay -- up there. \nDYLE gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by SCOBIE. DYLE stops at the door. \nDYLE Do I knock or something? \nSCOBIE Open it. \nDYLE opens the door. The stairs continue up. \nSCOBIE Keep going. \nDYLE The view had better be worth it. \nEXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- ROOFTOP -- NIGHT \nA spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely separated oval-shaped dormer windows. \nBelow these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven stories. \nDYLE Very pretty. Now what? \nSCOBIE I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money? \nDYLE Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that. \nSCOBIE And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it? \nDYLE Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over? \nSCOBIE You're out, Dyle -- right now! \nSCOBIE aims the gun and starts advancing toward DYLE. \nSCOBIE Step back. \nDYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street. \nDYLE Back where? \nSCOBIE That's the idea. \n", "test3_true": "Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears. \nThen, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and, unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder. \nBoth men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple with one another, each trying to break free and reach for the gun. \nCLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS \nTwo hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun. \nMED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIE \nThe battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, continues to inch forward toward the gun. \nSuddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip. \nCLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAW \nAs it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching sound and causing sparks to fly. \nMED. SHOT -- SCOBIE \nAs he slides over the edge and disappears. \nCLOSE SHOT -- DYLE \nAs he watches, hypnotized. \nCLOSE SHOT -- ROOF EDGE \nThere appears to be no sign of SCOBIE. Then CAMERA ZOOMS IN FOR A TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF SCOBIE'S metal hand, gripping the rain gutter at the very edge. \nMED. SHOT -- DYLE \nHaving seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of the level part of the roof. \nDYLE Herman? \nMED. SHOT -- SCOBIE \nAs he hangs, seven stories over the street, by his metal hand. \nSCOBIE Yeah? \nMED. SHOT -- DYLE \nHe finds it hard to believe. \nDYLE How are you doing? \nSCOBIE'S VOICE (O.S.) How do you think? \nDYLE If you get bored, try writing 'Love thy neighbor' a hundred times on the side of the building. \nDYLE turns and leaves going down the stairs. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT \nThe HOTEL MANAGER is busy taping a piece of cardboard over the hole ripped in REGGIE's door by SCOBIE's metal hand the night before. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own door. The MANAGER eyes him coldly. DYLE \"takes\" the look. \nDYLE I didn't do it. \nMANAGER The next time madame forgets her key, there is another one at the desk. \nDYLE smiles, then enters his room. \nINT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nHe closes the door and starts to remove his torn coat, wincing. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nREGGIE, smoking on the bed, sits up when she hears DYLE moving about in his room. She goes to the connecting door, unlocks her side, tries the knob, finds it still bolted from his side and knocks. \nREGGIE Is that you? \nINT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nDYLE goes to the door, throws back the bolt and opens the door. REGGIE enters. \nREGGIE Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to -- (seeing his injured back) What happened? \nDYLE I met a man with sharp nails. \nREGGIE Scobie? \nDYLE I left him hanging around the American Express. \nREGGIE Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy. \nShe leads him into her room. \nINT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nAs REGGIE and DYLE enter from his room. She leads him to the bed. \nREGGIE Take off your shirt and lie down. \nAs REGGIE goes to the bathroom, DYLE takes off his torn shirt, revealing a torn and bloody T-shirt. He lies face downwards on the bed. REGGIE returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape, scissors, and disinfectant. She sits next to him and lifts up his T-shirt to examine the wound. \nDYLE (wincing) Listen -- all I really want is an estimate. \nREGGIE It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you? \nShe wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning the wound. He winces. \nREGGIE Does it hurt? \nDYLE Haven't you got a bullet I can bite? \nShe continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging it while they talk. \nREGGIE Are you really Carson Dyle's brother? \nDYLE Would you like to see my passport? \nREGGIE Your passport! What kind of a proof is that? \nDYLE Would you like to see where I was tattooed? \n", "test3_id": 3140}

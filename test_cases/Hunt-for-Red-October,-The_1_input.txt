THOMPSON What's the status of Red October? 
BEAUMONT Dead in the water. 
THOMPSON They can't maneuver with the goddam DSRV stuck to them. 
(WHISPERING) Come on, Mancuso, move it. Get the hell out of there. 
ON RED OCTOBER BEDLAM in the Conn. Tba'lisi and Jones are on their way to sonar. Ramius SHOUTS at Melekhin: 
RAMIUS Get back to engineering and give me some power! 
(TO MANCUSO 
RE: DSRV) Get that damn thing off my boat. Mancuso's halfway up the ladder. He spots Steiner peeking down at 
HIM: 
STEINER I think somebody just shot a torpedo at us! 
MANCUSO No shit, buckwheat. Get the hell. out of here! 
STEINER 
(STUNNED) Where am I supposed -- Mancuso SLAMS the HATCH. Scrambling down the ladder, Mancuso hears Ramius bel]Dwing at Borodin who is manning the helm: 
RAMIUS No, Vasily. I need you in fire control. We must track whoever's out there. Borodin heads for fre control. Ramius tosses Ryan into the chair behind the helm : 
RAMIUS (CONT'D) You sit here! 
RYAN 
BUTICAN'T -- 
RAMIUS Do exactly as I tell you! Stunned, Ryan grabs the helm. Jones and Tbilisi, must have made it to sonar. Speakers CRACKLE: 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) DSRV is away. There's a Russian Akula about eight thousand yards starboard. 
TBILISI (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) It's the Konovalov. 
RAMIUS 
(TO RYAN) All ahead flank! 
RYAN 
(PANIC)DNG) I told you I'm just an analyst. I write books. 
RAMIUS - 
(LEANING FORWARD) Turn that knob all the way to the right. Ryan: does. AIL around him the world is going stark raving mad. Again, SPEAKERS CRACKLE: 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo in the water. High speed screws. Beaming zero-two-zero. I estimate range at about eight thousand yards. 
RAMIUS 
(TO RYAN) Turn the helm to the heft. Steer course zero-two-zero. 
MANCUSO 
(TO RAMIUS) Wait a minute! That's heading into the t o rpedo. You should turn away from it. 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Steady bearing to the weapon. Still zero-two-zero. Range about seven thousand yards. 
RAMIUS 
(TO RYAN) Turn that helm to the left until the dial says course zero-two-zero. 
MANCUSO No! That's wrong. Ryan, don't turn that goddam wheel! Ryan stares at Mancuso then at Ramius. Deciding, he turns the helm left, coming to course zero-two-zero.

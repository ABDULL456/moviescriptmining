FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the doorway.  Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  Screams. 
RANDY (cont'd) That ain't mine! 
Fred grabs Randy's shoulder. 
FRED C'mon, Randy. 
Randy squirms.  Turns.  Looks right into Will's eyes.  Gone is the bluster.  Gone is the attitude.  Randy Stetz, lost kid.  Tears streaming down his face. 
RANDY I swear to God.  I didn't kill her.  I swear to God... 
EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY 
Will stands outside the garage apartment.  Wind whipping his coat.  Watches as a Nightmute PD SQUAD CAR pulls off with Randy Stetz in the back. 
Fred sees him, heads over. 
FRED You look like shit, cowboy. 
Will shifts his eyes to him. 
WILL That's an understatement. 
Fred half-smiles.  Watches the receding squad car. 
FRED Looks like we can wrap this one up. 
Will barely nods.  Fred pulls his baseball cap on. 
FRED (cont'd) We're getting together for a couple of beers later on.  Might not be the Seattle thing to do.  But you're welcome to come. 
Fred puts out his hand to shake.  Truce.  Will looks at him. Takes it. 
INT. SHANTY BAR - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON a tray of dark beer.  Five glasses, foam sloshing. 
FARRELL (O.S.) I can't believe it.  Randy Stetz. 
PULL BACK to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting at a small, round table.  Fred's passing out the beers.  Dive bar.  MUSIC blaring.  3 a.m. Happy Hour! banner on the wall. Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN. 
Rich takes a glass from Fred. 
RICH What do you mean, you can't believe it? 
FRANCIS He was an asshole. 
FARRELL That doesn't mean anything. 
Fred sits.  Takes a sip of his beer.  To Farrell. 
FRED Didn't you grow up with him? 
Farrell shifts in his seat. 
FARRELL Our dads were on the same boat. (to Will) We used to wait for them together. 
Will nods.  Jostled by the crowd.  Reaches for his beer. 
FRANCIS He used to pick fights at the gas station. 
RICH And remember when he did all those donut holes that one summer? 
He and Francis GUFFAW. 
FRED Just a bad seed. 
Farrell looks over at Will. 
FARRELL How do you like our beer? 
Will slams down his empty glass.  Squeezes his eyes open and shut.  Loud music.  Cigarette smoke. 
WILL I like it fine. 
Fred pats Will's shoulder. 
FRED What Detective Dormer needs is a little shut-eye. 
RICH The white nights been hard on you? 
WILL They haven't been easy. 
Francis grabs a handful of peanuts. 
FRANCIS They don't have titanium shades over at the Pioneer. 
RICH Well no wonder. 
FRANCIS You lose all sense of time. 
FARRELL Better than Fred's home town. 
Will turns to Fred.  Wiping the foam from his moustache. 
FRED My people are from Barrow.  Way up north. 
RICH In the winter there's no sunlight for five straight months. 
FRED Like being swallowed up in a black hole. 
JUST THEN.

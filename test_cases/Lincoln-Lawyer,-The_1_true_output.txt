CORLISS Yes. Since I got arrested. 
TED For burglary and drug possession? 
CORLISS That's right. 
TED Now. Do you know the defendant? 
CORLISS Yes. I met him in lock-up. We was bussed over from jail, and then we was together in the tank when we came for first appearance. 
TED And did you talk at that time? 
CORLISS Yes... we talked about how bad we needed cigarettes. 
TED Anything else? 
CORLISS You know, "what are you in for?" Like that. 
TED Did he say what he was "in for?" 
CORLISS He said, "For giving a bitch exactly what she deserved." Those were his words. Reaction Louis, stirs like a caged animal. Mick steadies... 
TED I have only one more question. Have I, or has anyone, made you promises to get you to testify? 
CORLISS No. It's the right thing to do. Ted sits. Judge turns to Mick-- who's just staring, angrily. Then rises. Like he doesn't know what to do. Louis, the others, watch anxiously. Mick crosses to the front, steals a glance at the rear, SEES KURLEN standing against the wall, LANKFORD AND SOBEL seated in front of him. Then... 
MICK How many times have you been arrested, Mr. Corliss? 
CORLISS About seven in L.A. Couple of times in Phoenix if you count those. 
MICK So you know how the system works? 
CORLISS I try to survive... 
MICK And sometimes that means ratting out fellow inmates, is that it? 
TED Objection, your honor... 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Take a seat, Mr. Minton. I gave you leeway bringing this witness in. 
MICK Thank you, your honor. But I'll rephrase: How many times have you snitched on an inmate? Testified against a fellow inmate for the prosecution? 
CORLISS This makes my fourth. 
MICK 
(LOOKING SURPRISED) Four times? People just come up and tell you they committed crimes so you can testify against them-- 
CORLISS People talk to me. I'm a friendly guy. Mick, walks toward Louis, indicates him-- 
MICK So you and my client were friends-- 
CORLISS That's right, we was friendly-- 
MICK And he just said what you said he said, about what the woman "deserved," and then you went back to talking about cigarettes? 
CORLISS Not exactly. He was like, bragging. He told me he did it before... Mick freezes... Like he's in a mine field and can't move... 
CORLISS (CONT'D) He said the other time he killed the bitch... He got away with it then and he would get away with it now. 
MICK (staring at Corliss) You... Wait... All eyes on Mick. The Judge prompts... 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Haller? 
MICK No more questions, your honor. 
TED Re-direct, your honor. Fullbright nods permission. While Louis leans over to Mick... 
LOUIS What the hell is this? 
MICK You tell me! What did you say to this guy? 
LOUIS (through gritted teeth) Nothing! This is a set-up! You're doing this! 
MICK How? How am I doing this? But Louis has no answer. Meanwhile Ted's taken the floor...

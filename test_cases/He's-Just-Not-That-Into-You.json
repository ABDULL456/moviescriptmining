{"train": "HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU \nWritten by \nAbby Kohn & Marc Silverstein \nJuly 20, 2007 \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nWe float down through a serene, leafy park to the children's play area. There, in the sandbox, a BEAUTIFUL FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL plays among a group of kids. \nGIGI (V.O.) I have a theory about how this all started... \nA SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches. He watches the little girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle. \nAnd then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THE \nLITTLE GIRL DOWN. \nLITTLE GIRL Why did you do that? \nLITTLE BOY Because you smell like dog poo. \nSome of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one- liner. Our little girl's face turns red. \nLITTLE BOY (CONT'D) You're so stupid just like dog poo! You're made of poo! \nAnd then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE, smashing it. Finally, our little girl starts to CRY. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nOur beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her MOM. She can only get out one syllable between big, wet sobs. \nLITTLE GIRL Made. (SOB)   Of. (SOB)   Dog. (SOB)   Poo. \nMOM Honey, do you know why that little boy did those things? And said those things? \nThe little girl shakes her head no. \nMOM (CONT'D) Because he LIKES YOU. \nFREEZE FRAME ON OUR LITTLE GIRL'S FACE - TRYING TO \nPROCESS THIS. \nGIGI (V.O.) Uh - excuse me -- but what - the - HELL? Where did that rumor start? Because moms have been spreading it for years. \nBACK TO THE SCENE - THE MOM CONTINUES... \nMOM That little boy is doing those terrible things because he HAS A CRUSH ON YOU. \nWe see our little girl take this in, like she is just now beginning to understand the ways of the world. \nGIGI (V.O.) Do you understand what this means? We are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk -- that means he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that might serve us as five year olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nA CUTE COLLEGE GIRL sits CRYING in front of her ANSWERING MACHINE, as her ROOMMATE looks on. \nGIGI (V.O.) Then, as we get older, we carry on this tradition of misreading the signals men send by encouraging our friends to do the same... \nThe machine evilly flashes 0 in the NEW MESSAGES window. \nROOMMATE #1 That Phi Delt so obviously liked you. I'm sure he just lost your number. \nINT. HIGH RISE OFFICE - DAY \nA HOT EXECUTIVE WOMAN stands in the office hallway, watching a SEXY MALE COLLEAGUE walk by. He does not give her a second glance. Her FEMALE SECRETARY looks on. \nSECRETARY He's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success and emotional maturity. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nA BUNCH OF TWENTY-SOMETHINGS sipping cocktails. One of them is CRYING - smeared mascara, puffy eyes, etc. \nCUTE TWENTYSOMETHING #1 Here's the problem. He likes you TOO much. You're TOO pretty and awesome.        He can't handle it. \nINT. BURGER KING - DAY \nTWO FEMALE CASHIERS WORK SIDE BY SIDE. \nCASHIER #1 Trust me. It's because he's just getting out of a serious relationship. \nINT. GYM - DAY \nTWO MIDDLE AGED WOMEN work out on ellipticals. \nMIDDLE AGED WOMAN #1 Trust me. It's because he's never had a serious relationship. \nINT. JAPANESE DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nTWO HIPSTER JAPANESE GIRLS making their way through a crowded Tokyo department store. \nNeil walks into a vast space. Nice art, a cozy yet architectural look - a cool place to live. \nNEIL Hey, babe.    You here? \nWe PAN over to a couch - where BETH is wrapped in a throw blanket, watching TV. She's got her hair in a messy bun. \nBETH Hey honey. \nHe joins her on the couch.        And sees that the TV is off. \nNEIL Everything OK? \nBETH Yeah.   Just got off the phone. \nNeil gets up again. \nNEIL You want some tea or something? \nBETH It was my baby sister.        She's getting married. \nNEIL That's great. I've always liked that Devon guy. That's really great. \nBeth looks at him.    She doesn't look that happy. \nBETH Do you think it's great? \nNEIL Yeah. \nBETH So, you think it's great that they're getting married, but you never feel like we're going against nature or something by not getting married? \nNEIL No, babe. \nHe sits back down, puts his arms around her. \nNEIL (CONT'D) Going against nature is like that cat who started nursing that monkey. We're just two people who aren't married. \nBeth manages a weak smile. \nBETH Right. \nNEIL I actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married. Look at my parents - all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking. \nBETH Yeah, I know. I get that. \nNEIL Like I've always told you - I love you - and we don't need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship. \nBETH Yeah. \nNEIL Lemme get you some tea. \nHe exits. Beth starts to CRY, but quickly dries her tears, and forces herself to pull it together. \nEXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - MORNING \nA brick row house in an up and coming neighborhood - clearly under massive renovation. \nINT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - SAME \nWe make our way through rooms with plastic covering the doorways - until we find JANINE stepping into the hallway. She checks herself in a vintage mirror, straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find GIGI, on her cell phone. Gigi slams it closed. \nJANINE OK, so clearly he hasn't called. \nGigi shakes her head. \nJANINE (CONT'D) Maybe he's away on business. \nGIGI He sells real estate. In Baltimore. Staying in town is his business. \nJANINE Right. \nJanine ponders this. \nJANINE (CONT'D) Look, let me tell you - after the first time I went out with Ben, he didn't call me for eleven days. ELEVEN DAYS. And now he's like the world's best husband. That happens all the time. \nGIGI Really? \nJANINE Yes, really. \nGigi manages a small smile. \nGIGI This is all your fault. \nJANINE What?    Why? \nGIGI You set me up with him. \nJANINE No - you asked if I knew any guys and I gave Conor your number. That's not a set up. When I do a set up - I weigh pros and cons. I do my due diligence. All I know about Conor is he sold us this house. \nGigi peers out the window. \nGIGI He sold you a house in the ghetto. \nJANINE It's a neighborhood \"in transition.\" \nINT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT \nIt's late. The bar is nearly empty. Alex is totaling receipts - and Gigi is still nursing a drink. \nALEX Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm just gonna be honest - Conor is never going to call you. \nGIGI Oh really? How do you know? \nALEX Because I'm a guy.   It's how we do it. \nGIGI \n(HOPEFUL) He said it was nice meeting me. \nALEX I don't care if he said you were his favorite female since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham. Over a week went by - and he didn't call. \nGIGI But maybe he called me and I didn't get the message. Or maybe he lost my number, or was out of town, or was hit by a cab, or his grandma died. \nALEX Or maybe he just didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again. \nGIGI Yeah but my friend Terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off - then like a year later she ran into him -- \nALEX Your friend Terri's an idiot.   And she's the exception. \nGIGI OK.   But what if I'm the exception? \nALEX You're not. You're the rule. And the rule is - if a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't want to call you. \nGIGI Really?     Always? \nALEX Yeah. Always. I know what blowing off a woman looks like. I do it early and I do it often. Trust me - if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit - - he doesn't. No exceptions. \nGigi thinks this over. \nGIGI Why are you telling me all of this? Aren't these man-secrets - like why men need to watch televised golf? \nAlex LAUGHS. \nALEX I don't know. You looked like you could really use the help. \nGIGI Thank you. You've given me a lot to think about. \nGigi smiles at him. \nINT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORP. HQ - DAY \nGigi comes in - carrying a MESSY HANDFUL OF PAPERS, with crazy hair and wearing the last outfit we saw her in. \nJANINE Everything OK? \nGIGI I was up all night. \nJANINE Please say you were working on the newsletter. \nGIGI Sure. It's basically done.   But this is important. \nJANINE What's happening with your hair? \nBeth comes out of her office and looks at Gigi. \nBETH Please come in my office before the others see that you have mini muffin stuck in your hair. \nINT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORP. HQ - BETH'S OFFICE - DAY \nGigi paces in front of Beth's desk. \nGIGI I think I figured it out. Remember when I went out with that notary public? And he cheated on me? And then Anastasia from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning - but then he totally changed and they're married and crazy in love. \nBETH I thought that guy was a process server. \nGIGI No, notary. Anyway, the point is - Anastasia is the exception. Not the rule. We have to stop listening to these stories - because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front don't really care about you very much. \nBETH Okay... \nGigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper. \nGIGI Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived in his storage space. He only used me for rides, yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998. Then there was Don, who broke up with me every Friday so he could have his weekends free. I was so delusional about our relationship that I referred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist. \n(MORE) \nGIGI (CONT'D) And all my friends would tell me stories about how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like mine, and that girl ended up getting married and living happily ever after. But that's the exception. And we're not the exception - we're the rule. \nGigi sits down, spent.   But Beth has been listening. \nBETH OK. So let me see if I understand. What you're saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years, and then he finally married her -- that's the exception. And the rule is that guys - like Neil - who are with girls - like me - for seven years without getting married - are never getting married. \nBeth is serious.   Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack. \nGIGI No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. This has absolutely nothing to do with you. I was just talking, you know, about me. Specifically. \nOff Beth, knowing it's about her, too. \nINT. SASSY NAILS - EVENING \nBETH Why are you hanging that? \nNEIL I told you I'd do it weeks ago.   You don't like it there? \nBETH I love it there. But just - stop. \nNEIL It's the image, isn't it? I didn't see it before, but - you're right - it totally looks like a sagging boob. \nBeth is silent. \nNEIL (CONT'D) You want me to take it down? \nBETH No.     I want you stop doing anything nice. \nNEIL Is this a trick? \nBETH No. I need you to stop being nice to me - unless you're gonna marry me after. \nNeil laughs. \nBETH (CONT'D) Is that funny? \nNEIL No.     It was just - I was just-- \nBETH See, you can't keep being nice to me and I can't keep pretending like this is something that it's not. We've been together over seven years. You know me. You either want to marry me or you don't. \nNEIL Or there is the possibility that I just don't really believe in the concept of - \nBETH BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! Bullshit for every woman who's been told by some guy that he doesn't believe in marriage just to see him turn around eight months later and marry some twenty four year old girl he met at the gym. Bullshit. \nBeth tries to hold back her tears. Neil looks stunned. He hops down off the couch and goes to her. \nNEIL Honey, where is all this coming from? \nBETH From the place that I have been hiding from you for the last five years because I didn't want to seem demanding, or clingy or psycho or whatever. So I never ask. But now I'm going to --- \nNeil looks at her.    She looks at him. \nBETH (CONT'D) Are you ever going to marry me? \nBeth looks at Neil.    There is a long, painful SILENCE. \nBETH (CONT'D) I can't do this anymore. \nShe walks out of the room. \nFADE TO CHAPTER CARD:    ... IF HE'S NOT MARRYING YOU \nAMY sits with a sleeping baby in her arms. \nAMY I was with Damon for six years. He asked me to marry him on the phone, because he's just so different and cool like that. Said he'd eventually get me a ring, which he didn't, but he did buy himself a ring because isn't that so hilarious and cool that the guy is wearing the ring? Then, my favorite part is, I stayed with him even after he took back his proposal, and introduced the idea of a \"relation vacation.\" Isn't that a cute name? Let me explain the concept: it involves dating a girl from the time she's thirty two to the time she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her of the ability to bear children, and then, after all that, wanting to take a year off. And giving it a fun name that you can put on t-shirts. (looks at the baby, smiles) I left him. \nINT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY \nBen, our married guy from the grocery store, sits on the floor in a barely furnished room, and dials his cell. \nBEN Hey, Anna. This is Ben. Look, I know it's been a little while since you called. I just - it took me by surprise. But I offered to help you with your career, and I don't see why I can't do that, right? So, give me a call. Maybe you can come by the office this week or something. Okay, take care. Bye. \nBen hangs up. And STARES INTO SPACE until THE DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL: JANINE. Gigi's co-worker. And Ben's WIFE. \nJANINE Hey, how -- \nBen is CLEARLY STARTLED. \nBEN Shit - you scared me. \nJanine looks at him. \nJANINE Is everything OK? \nBEN Yeah.   Everything's fine.   Why? \nShe sits down next to him, looks at him intently. \nJANINE Are you smoking again? \nBEN No, sweetie.    Why? \nJANINE Well - you get jumpy when you smoke. \nBen puts his arm around Janine, and pulls her close. \nBEN I'm not smoking. So, why don't we worry about what color we're gonna paint this room, instead of worrying about things that aren't happening? \nJanine contentedly curls up to Ben. \nJANINE I don't know - I was thinking maybe - pink? \nBEN Pink?   Seriously? \nJANINE Well, I mean, at some point. \nJanine gives Ben a knowing look.   He gets it. \nShe gets to her desk and is descended upon by - BRUCE, NATHAN, and JOSHUA. All mid-20's. All gay. \nBRUCE So? \nMary looks at them, smiling, enjoying their impatience. \nMARY He asked me out. \nNATHAN Oh my god!    He called? \nMARY Well - \nJOSHUA He emailed? \nMARY Umm - \nBRUCE What? Did he travel by carriage and leave his calling card with your lady in waiting? \nMARY He MySpaced me. \nThe guys all look skeptical. \nNATHAN Ouch. \nJOSHUA I don't know. My slutty sister says MySpace is the new booty call. \nMARY Well, what am I supposed to do? Things have changed. People don't just meet organically anymore. If I want to make myself more attractive to the opposite sex, I don't go get a new haircut - I update my profile. That's just how it is. \nThe guys look at her, starting to understand.   Mary's \nPHONE RINGS. \nMARY (CONT'D) Back to work. \nShe smiles at the guys - they disperse as she picks up. \nMARY (CONT'D) Ad sales - this is Mary. \nINTERCUT WITH EXT. LIGHT ST. - DAY \nConor sits on a bench, NEWSPAPER folded open on his lap. \nCONOR Hey, it's Conor. Anna's - uh - friend. Or whatever. \nMARY Hey.   So, did you see it? \nCONOR I'm not sure about this. \nMARY You gotta trust me. It's a burgeoning market. You're gonna make a fortune. \nConor looks at the paper. \nCONOR Yeah. I hope so. But, like - did you have to put me on the page with the massage ads? \nMARY It was either that or on the page with the personals. I made a call. \nCONOR OK. You're right.      Hey, have you talked to Anna lately? \nConor leaves the paper and gets up. He walks away, still on the phone, we STAY WITH THE NEWSPAPER AND WE PUSH IN. \nUNDER VARIOUS 1 INCH ADS FOR MASSEUSES, S&M and LEATHER \nTYPE SERVICES - THERE'S A HALF PAGE AD UNDER THE TITLE: \nTHE HOME FOR YOUR LIFESTYLE - CONOR BARRY - REAL ESTATE Under which is a picture of Conor, standing in front of a brick Tudor, a SOLD SIGN proudly displayed. In the background - TWO MEN look lovingly at their new home. \nINT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY \nPAIGE, blonde and angelic, looks on as LAURA, CATHERINE, and Beth pull on matching coral dresses. \nCATHERINE I do not understand how you got mom to sew all of these in two weeks. \nPAIGE She wanted to do it. \nLAURA Mom told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweatshop. \nPAIGE No, she didn't. \nBETH Why again do you need to get married so fast? \nCATHERINE You're so pregnant. \nPAIGE I'm not pregnant. \nCATHERINE Chug a beer, then. I want to see you chug a beer. \nPAIGE We're in love, you assholes. That's what people do when they're in love - they get married. \nEveryone FREEZES.    And looks at BETH.   Big silence. \nPAIGE (CONT'D) Bethie, you know I didn't mean -- \nBETH It's OK.    Neil and I are actually - done - anyway. \nThere are cans of paint, bags of cement, some tarps. Janine grabs a TARP, when she sees, on a window ledge, next to a folding chair - AN ALUMINUM FOIL ASHTRAY. \nCIGARETTE BUTTS. AN EMPTY PACK OF AMERICAN SPIRITS. \nShe stares at them for a moment, then heads back inside. \nINT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCLOSE ON: A TORN BUSINESS CARD, TAPED BACK TOGETHER. The name on the card is JARRAD MONTROSE. Gigi sits, staring at the card. She reaches for the phone, and then thinks the better of it. And again. \nFinally, she grabs the receiver, picks it up, and dials. \nGIGI Hi, this is Gigi. \nINTERCUT WITH:   INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - DAY \nAlex sits in his office.    He talks into his CELL. \nALEX Gigi? \nGIGI Gigi Phillips. I had the - umm - dentist pen. \nALEX Right. \nGIGI I'm really sorry to bug you. I just - I thought you had some really good insights the other night and -- I had a question. \nALEX Okay, maybe I need to be harsh -- Conor is never going to be interested in you. \nGIGI No, I know. This is about - (she looks at the card) - Jarrad. You have a sec? \nALEX Okay... \nGIGI So I meet him at happy hour and he was completely charming -- \nALEX Lemme guess - he said the only thing happy about this hour is you. \nGIGI He may have used some derivative of that. So, he says he's going to call, but then gave me his card and -- \nALEX He's not interested. \nGIGI You don't even know if he called -- \nALEX Did he? \nGIGI No. But the thing is, I honestly think he's expecting my call. \n(MORE) \nGIGI (CONT'D) He said \"Look forward to hearing from you\" and not \"Look forward to talking to you.\" I mean, do you hear the connotations? \nALEX He.   Is.   Not. Interested. \nTyrone appears in Alex's doorway. \nTYRONE Alex - this is jacked. The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a white shirt -- this shirt is WHITE! \nTyrone points to a VERY SMALL WHITE INSIGNIA on an otherwise BLACK SHIRT. Alex shuts the door on him. \nTYRONE    (O.S.) (CONT'D) This shit is white. \nALEX If a guy gives you his phone number, instead of taking yours, he's not interested. \nGIGI He took mine first, but then he -- \nALEX And, if a guy wants to see you, he will see you. I once called 55 Lauren Bell's until I got the right one. \nGIGI That's cute.    What happened? \nALEX As it turned out, her ass looked really huge in daylight. \nGIGI Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women? \nALEX Don't call him. He doesn't like you. \nGIGI Again with the sensitivity. \nALEX Just trying to help. \nGIGI I know.   Thanks. \nGigi hangs up, re-tears up Jarrad's card. \nEXT. DUNDALK HOME - BACKYARD - DAY \nCLOSE ON:   HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM written across a CAKE. \nAs the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: Anna and Conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny backyard, across from MAYA - Anna's mom. \nAs Maya refills her glass from a BOTTLE OF WINE, Anna grabs a GIFT from her bag - hands it to her mom. \nMAYA Oh sweetie - you didn't have to get me anything. \nANNA Mom - you always say that and I always get you something. \nTRENT, early 30s, talks to the camera as he drives his Ford Explorer. He's cute - but trying a smidge too hard - - goatee, leather cord necklace he bought in Cancun, etc. \nTRENT If a girl is into you, she's sleeping with you. And if after a month - two months at the very outside - she's not sleeping with you, she does not like you. I guess the trick is, how to spot this girl early - so you don't waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out that it's never gonna happen. So, I've got some signs about how to spot this girl - gleaned from my own experience, of course. A girl will never sleep with you if: she calls you cuddly or dependable, she pops a zit in front of you, her name is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates 1-3. I know it's not scientific - but I'm just saying - you were warned. \nINT. NATIONAL BREWERY LOFTS - NIGHT \nAlex knocks and opens the door in one motion. \nALEX Hey dude - you here? \nCONOR (O.S.) Yep. \nAlex heads to the fridge, opens it and looks in. \nALEX Wanna beer? \nHe pulls TWO BEERS out, shuts the fridge and turns to find Conor standing there. He's wearing a REALLY TIGHT, SHINY SHIRT and EVEN TIGHTER, VERY BLUE JEANS. \nALEX (CONT'D) Or an apple martini? \nCONOR Funny. \nConor grabs the beer and opens it. \nALEX Need I ask? \nCONOR It's for work. I'm trying to expand my client base. \nALEX By pretending you're gay? \nCONOR No.   By being more gay friendly. \nALEX Or, in real estate terms, by becoming \"gay adjacent\". \nCONOR Nice.    I may have to use that. \nConor heads back toward his room. \nCONOR (CONT'D) I'm gonna try something else. This may be too much. \nALEX I don't know. You dress like that - and you're already seeing a girl who won't sleep with you - I think maybe you can pull it off. \nCONOR (O.S.) It's not that she won't sleep with me douchebag...I have slept with her. It's just, you know, she...um... \nALEX Won't sleep with you anymore. \nConor reappears, now wearing A FRENCH CONNECTION TYPE \nTIGHT T-SHIRT AND BLACK JEANS. \nCONOR Pretty much, yeah. (re: his new outfit) So, what do you think? \nAlex gives him the once over. \nALEX I think you're gonna have to beat 'em away with a stick - you hot, sexy man. \nConor rolls his eyes and heads back into his room.    Alex laughs to himself and takes another sip of beer. \nINT. FELL'S POINT CONDO - NIGHT \nLeather couch, framed Orioles jersey - typical bachelor pad. Gigi is making out with GREGORY, 30s. \nGIGI Who would have thought that a random girl from Pilates would fix me up with such a good kisser? \nGREGORY Back at you sister. \nGigi beams.   They make out some more. \nGIGI I can't wait to kiss you again. \nGREGORY Umm.   We're kissing right now. \nGIGI I know. But next time. The second date kiss is way more intimate. \nAs they start kissing again - \nGREGORY Well, I'm going out of town tomorrow - so I'll be out of touch for a bit. \nGregory starts pulling off Gigi's top.    Gigi pulls away deftly. \nGIGI Would you excuse me a quick second?    Too many diet cokes... \nGigi makes a beeline down the hall. \nINT. FELLS POINT CONDO - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nGigi dials her CELL as she goes through Gregory's bathroom cabinets. \nINTERCUT WITH:   INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAlex is also mid-makeout on his leather couch with a HOT WOMAN. The PHONE RINGS. Alex grabs it. \nALEX Yup. \nANNA So, friends, right? \nBEN Totally. \nAnd with that, Anna pulls off her top. And then her sweats. And, totally naked, slides into the pool. \nANNA You wanna come in? \nBEN I'm sorry.   I don't trust myself. \nANNA OK.   You can just watch. \nHe does. \nBEN You may be the best friend I've ever had. \nAnna LAUGHS, and then dunks her head under the water. \nINT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nBen comes in the front door, drops his gym bag. Janine sits on the couch flipping through a magazine. He leans in to kiss her on the cheek. She does not look happy. \nJANINE Honey - you smell different. \nBen pulls back smoothly. \nBEN Different how? \nJANINE I don't know. \nBEN Well that's an odd thing to say. \nShe looks at him.    He tries to coolly meet her gaze. \nJANINE Maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes I found. In the side yard. What part of \"my dad died of lung cancer\" is hard for you to wrap your brain around? \nBEN What? \nJANINE Do not lie to me, Ben.      Please. \nBEN Are you serious? We have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily. You find cigarettes, and you automatically assume they're mine? \nJANINE Well, yes. \nBEN Honey, I'm not lying. And you are really freaking out. I think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on. Just please - relax. \nBen walks away.    Off Janine, wanting to believe him. \nEXT. BALTIMORE YACHT CLUB - DOCK - DAY \nBen walks to a boat at the end of the dock. He stands, unsure, before deciding to KNOCK on the side of the boat. NEIL emerges - unshaven, possibly unshowered. \nNEIL Ah.     My first visitor. \nBEN This boat is sick. How come you never invited me out before? \nNEIL Well, this was supposed to be just for Beth and I - for our retirement. Leave our jobs. Sell the house. Take off. \nNeil is clearly having a tough time. Ben doesn't know what to say. They're silent for a second. \nNEIL (CONT'D) Sorry. Where are my manners? Permission to board granted. I'll show you around. \nBen smiles, steps on to the boat. \nEXT. INNER HARBOR - DAY \nCLOSE ON: A cigarette being lit. WIDEN to reveal Neil smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out into the bay.   Ben stands across from him, looking on. \nNEIL (re: cigarette) Sorry. \nBEN It's OK. \nNeil switches to his left hand, away from Ben. \nNEIL So Janine sent you to check on me? \nBEN Yeah.    Pretty much. \nNEIL Any message from Beth? \nBen shakes his head no.    Neil seems disappointed. \nBEN I think she's been busy getting ready for her sister's funeral though, so... \nNEIL Her sister's what? \nBEN Wedding.    Her sister's wedding.   What did I say? \nNeil is now LAUGHING HARD. \nNEIL You said funeral. \nBEN No, I didn't. Shit, did I? \nGIGI Awesome. I'm stuck here with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl - (motions to GIRL at the bar) - she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak. \nThe GIRL is standing between TWO GUYS. \nALEX Nope. \nGIGI How do you know? \nALEX See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise thing. She's interested. He's not. \nGIGI You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not interested. \nALEX Actually, I can. I manage a restaurant. I see this stuff go down every night. Watch -- \nAs if on cue, Tom Cruise Guy BANGS his elbow into the GIRL, hard, causing her to spill her drink. Tom Cruise Guy sees, but doesn't acknowledge. Alex looks smug. \nGIGI Man, you have a gift. \nALEX And check out droopy dawg on her other side. He can buy her drinks all night, and she'll insist there's no \"spark.\" \nGIGI Maybe there isn't.   You need a spark. \nALEX The \"spark\" thing is bullshit. \nGIGI Really?    Enlighten me. \nALEX Guys invented the \"spark\" so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing, and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a \"spark.\" And you all buy it. You love it. You all thrive on it because you all love drama. \nGIGI I don't. \nALEX Really? So you don't wait until the last minute on deadlines, or on phone bills, because you love the drama of not knowing whether you'll make it? \nShe's busted. \nGIGI Maybe. \nALEX And let me guess - when you were stalking Conor that night - were you obsessing about him calling for days, even though the date was just kind of mediocre? \nGIGI OK.   Yeah. \nALEX See, you thrive on drama. You gotta be more like me - if a girl likes me great, if not, there are plenty more like her - probably with smaller pores and bigger implants. \nGIGI That's beautiful. \nALEX Thanks. \nThey continue drinking and observing the scene. \nGIGI Why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again? \nALEX I dunno.    I like you. \nGIGI You do? \nALEX Don't start doodling my name on your binder. I just mean, I like you, like I like basset hounds. They're kinda pathetic - so you want to cheer them up. \nGIGI Again with the sensitivity. \nAlex smiles at her.   Gigi can't help but smile back. \nINT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - MORNING \nJanine walks down the hallway, with JAVIER (40, stocky), her contractor. She's inspecting the crown molding. \nJANINE It looks good. \nJAVIER Yes. \nJANINE He does good work. \nJAVIER He's very good. \nJanine stops and looks at Javier.   He looks back at her. \nJANINE Javier. \nJAVIER Yes. \nJANINE Javier, if I asked you an honest question, do you think you could give me an honest answer? \nJAVIER I think so. \nJANINE Good. Because I think some of your guys have been - smoking. \nJanine looks at Javier.    It's awkwardly silent. \nJANINE (CONT'D) Javier? \nJAVIER Is that the question? \nJANINE Yes. \nJAVIER Oh.    It seemed like a statement. \nSkip look at Larry again.   Larry meets his gaze. \nLARRY One, two - (he looks away) No. Thanks for playing.    Move along. \nSKIP It's that simple. \nCONOR You're right. That's no help at all. \nLARRY But listen - I can tell you this. Gay or straight, you're not going to get anywhere by being inactive. She clearly likes you - maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something. So the next time you're in the position - don't take no for an answer. \nSkip looks at Larry, concerned. \nSKIP That sounds like felonious advice. \nLARRY You're right. Let me rephrase.    Don't take maybe for an answer. \nConor takes this in - that's not a bad idea. \nINT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCute studio apartment. And Ben is in the bed. Anna walks in from the bathroom, in a robe. Ben watches her. \nBEN Wait.   Stop. \nANNA What? \nBEN Shit.   This is bad. \nANNA What? \nBEN I am so into you. \nAnna BEAMS.   She joins him in bed. \nBEN (CONT'D) I'm lying here watching you and I seriously have never felt this way before. I have to forcibly make my brain stop thinking about you. I mean, all the time. \nANNA Why stop? \nShe looks at Ben.    He's not smiling. \nBEN Because I don't do stuff like this. \nANNA Stuff like what? \nBEN Like having sex with women who are not my wife. \nANNA First of all, I'm not women.   I'm just one. \nHe waits. \nBEN What's second of all? \nANNA I didn't have a second of all. \nBEN I thought second of all was going to make me feel better. \nAnna thinks. \nANNA Second of all - I can't stop thinking about you, either. \nThey look at each other for a LONG MOMENT. \nBEN I have to tell her. \nANNA What? \nBEN I have to tell her. \nAnna's eyes light up, but she tries to cover. \nANNA I don't want to push you to -- \nBEN I want to be with you. And I can't do that if I'm lying to her. \nANNA You know what's best. \nAs Ben pulls her to him, she lets a smile take hold. \nFADE TO CHAPTER CARD:   ...IF HE'S MARRIED \nLOUIS, 60's, with a kind but very wise face, talks to the camera in his FORMAL DOORMAN attire, standing in front of a posh Upper East Side building. \nLOUIS Here's the thing - my daughter is happily married with kids and running a tanning salon on Staten Island. But if she wasn't, I'd tell her the same thing I'd like to tell a lot of the girls that come in and out of this building on the arm of a married guy. \n(MORE) \nLOUIS (CONT'D) And here is that advice --- get stocks, cash, annuities, a deed in your name. Don't settle for flowers and a shopping spree at Bendel's. Think to the future. We all know that none of these guys is gonna leave his society wife and let her keep half the money and the classic eight on Park Avenue. So, I wanna tell these young ladies, as long as you only have the guy for a finite period of time -- get something that can last. Because I guarantee you - he won't. And that's the best fatherly advice I can give. \nINT. RITE AID - DAY \nMary and Anna, in sweats and Ugg boots and dirty hair, both load their carts with cheap beauty products. \nANNA I'm not picking out china patterns or anything - but I've never felt anything like this before. \nINT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nGigi blows in, dumps her things and turns to Janine: \nGIGI He's into me. \nJANINE Awesome. I knew it. (she hugs Gigi) Who's this now? \nGIGI Alex. It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts. \nJANINE What? \nGIGI From Some Kind of Wonderful. \nJANINE Wait, isn't Mary Stuart Masterson Watts? \nGIGI Yes. \nJANINE So, why aren't you Watts? \nGIGI I'm Eric Stoltz. \nJANINE What? \nGIGI Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones, but really she's in love with Eric Stoltz herself. \nJANINE Wait - so who's Amanda Jones? \nGIGI I guess Conor at first. Now men in general. But that's not the point.    The point is -- he's into me. \nJANINE You know, I knew there had to be a reason he was spending all that time with you. \nGIGI I know! It's so obvious now -- there are so many signs. \nJANINE Oooh, gimme the signs.   I love to hear about the signs. \nJanine rolls her chair closer to Gigi's desk. \nGIGI At first they were small - like when I first called he said \"Good to hear from you\" - \nJANINE Totally good sign. \nGIGI Right? And then the next time I called he was with a woman - but he still took the call. And talked to me for a while. \nJANINE You know it was a woman? \nGIGI He called her \"babe.\" \nJANINE A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to another woman - unless there's something going on. \nGIGI I know! And it gets more obvious. I mean, please - there was no guy he was going to fix me up with. The fix up was him. \nJANINE Wait - really? \nGIGI He shows up - without this fictitious Bill character - and the two of us basically have a date. And then he calls me to invite me to a party at his place. \nJANINE You're right. He so likes you. \nJanine rolls her chair up to Gigi's computer screen. \nJANINE (CONT'D) Let's look up places for your destination wedding. Would you guys wanna do Napa Valley - I've always wanted to go there. \nGigi laughs but doesn't fight as Janine starts searching. \nINT. BALTIMORE BLADE OFFICES - DAY \nMary sits at her desk, surrounded by her gays.    They are all looking at her computer screen. \nCLOSE ON:   A MYSPACE PAGE. NAME:\"YOUR SOUL-UTION\" \nSEX: MALE   AGE: 29 FROM: FUNKYTOWN FRIENDS : 1282 \nMARY There's no way he's already called - we only met for coffee last night. I mean we video iChatted. While holding coffee. Kinda like having coffee. \nNathan hands her the phone. \nNATHAN Just call your voice mail. \nMARY And he told me he had a gig last night, so he probably got in real late. Did I tell you he was singer? \nBRUCE Just call. \nMary cradles the receiver with her shoulder and dials. \nJOSHUA On speaker. \nMary hits the SPEAKERPHONE button. \nYOUR SOUL-UTION (O.S.) (SINGING, in a sexy voice) Maaaary. Mary, Mary, Mary, Maaaary.   Oh my Maaary. \nMary is clearly charmed.    The gays all SWOON. \nNATHAN I just got hard. \nJanine just STARES AT HIM, FUMING. \nBEN (CONT'D) Look, I talked to Neil, and he said I could stay on his boat for a while if -- \nNow Janine's eyes go wide with disbelief. \nJANINE EXCUSE ME? And now you want to move out? You're like - what - leaving me? \nBen looks confused, but is trying to roll with it. \nBEN No. NO. I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to -- \nJANINE We're not going to deal with this? We're not going to figure out a way to work through this? \nBEN I just assumed that once I told you, you would want me -- out. \nJANINE Is that what you want? \nBEN (almost a whisper) No. \nJANINE \nOK. \nShe heads down the aisle with the cart. Ben follows, confused - that didn't go how he thought it would. \nEXT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY \nThe lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn-of-the- century mansion. The procession of a wedding has just begun. TWO ADORABLE FLOWER GIRLS start things off. \nThen Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with her husband, STEVEN. Beth's sister Catherine and her husband GEORGE are next. Big smiles all around. \nThen Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort - BUDDY, a 12 year old CHOCOLATE LAB, wearing a coral bow tie. Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy - who stops to piss on a chair leg. Beth is not happy. \nINT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY \nA lavish reception. Beth takes her seat next to DAN, 40s. Dan looks over at Beth's place card. \nDAN You must be Beth. \nBETH Yep. \nDAN I've heard a lot about you from Paige. I'd been lobbying for weeks to be seated next to her single sister. \nBETH Oh, yeah? So you are - (looks at his placecard) Dan. \nDAN Uh, sort of. \nBETH Hmmm? \nDAN Well, I'm actually a wiccan.    So I have a magickal name. \nBETH Really? \nDAN It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse. But I didn't know if that would fit on a card. \nBeth slaps on a fake smile, and grabs for the wine. \nINT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA PARTY is in full swing. Typical affair for someone in their late 20's - mediocre food but decent alcohol. \nGigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the Chex Mix. She tries smiling at a TALL GIRL, who ignores her. So Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls of Chex Mix into her mouth. \nNATHAN It makes your breath stink. \nGIGI Pardon? \nGigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday night gay mode - standing next to her. \nNATHAN Chex Mix. I learned the hard way. I made out with a guy after eating like a bag of the stuff. He said my breath smelled like trout. \nGigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back. \nGIGI Thanks for the tip. \nNATHAN I'm sorry. That was rude. And that guy I made out with was a total asshole. \nBRUCE You want me to smell you?   I'm sure you don't smell like trout. \nGigi LAUGHS. \nGIGI Thanks.   I'm good. \nShe cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath. \nNATHAN I'm Nathan.   This is Bruce. \nGIGI Gigi.   How do you guys know Alex? \nBRUCE We don't. Our friend Mary heard about it from some guy named Conor. \nGigi smiles in recognition. \nShe CATCHES ALEX'S EYE across the room, he's talking to friends. She smiles and gives a THUMBS UP. He gives an awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation. \nINT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER \nGigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some DIP. She chats with a couple of PARTY-GOERS, very much at home. \nPARTY-GOER #1 Really great party. \nGIGI Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have a party, I was like \"Let's do it.\" \nPARTY-GOER #2 Thanks so much for having us. \nGIGI No problem.   Anytime. \nAn attractive TALL GIRL enters the kitchen, and starts LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS. Gigi watches with interest. \nGIGI (CONT'D) Can I help you find something? \nThe Tall Girl finds a BOWL in the cabinet, and grabs it. \nTALL GIRL No, that's OK. I got it. \nShe brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl. Gigi is THROWN. \nTALL GIRL (CONT'D) Thanks for mixing that up. \nGIGI What? \nTALL GIRL Alex asked me to get the dip together. Thanks for getting it started. \nGigi's face grows red.   The Tall Girl tastes the dip. \nTALL GIRL (CONT'D) Hmmm - could use a little more dill. \nThen the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and heads back out to the party. Gigi looks to the confused party-goers, not pleased. \nINT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - LATER \nBruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave. People are getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning. \nGigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline. \nGIGI When someone's underwear ends up in your toaster oven - it's been a good party. \nAlex looks at the toaster oven and laughs. \nALEX I guess people had fun. \nThen, the TALL GIRL emerges. \nTALL GIRL Alex, you want me to start cleaning up? \nGigi STARES DAGGERS AT HER. \nGIGI That's sweet of you. But I thought I'd stick around, so I'll take care of it. \nTALL GIRL No.   I got it. \nThe tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a trash bag. Gigi grabs one, too. Alex looks mystified. \nALEX Knock yourselves out. \nINT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - STILL LATER \nIt is really late. Everyone's gone - except the TALL GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on the XBOX. Gigi enters from the kitchen. \nGIGI I think I've rounded up the last of the beer bottles. \nThe tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game. Gigi stands there awkwardly. \nGIGI (CONT'D) So, umm - what game is this? \nThey ignore her.   She looks around.    It's awkward. \nGIGI (CONT'D) Well, maybe I should just -- you know -- I mean it's past three and -- \nTALL GIRL YES!!    Suck it! \nAlex tosses down his controller. \nALEX You are sensational. \nThe tall girl beams.   Gigi flinches. \nTALL GIRL Did you say it's past three?     Man, I gotta go. \nGigi suppresses a SMILE. The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug, and heads out. Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next to him on the couch. They're silent for a moment. \nALEX Thanks for staying and helping clean up - but I really gotta get to bed. \nGIGI Is that an invitation? \nALEX What? \nJANINE I don't know. I just thought - maybe we could, you know, relight the fire. \nBEN Honey, did you hear what I just said? I gotta get this offering statement out. \nBen picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up. \nJANINE Look, I am trying here. Do you want to save our marriage or don't you? \nJanine looks at Ben.   Ben is SILENT. \nINT. BEN'S OFFICE - CLOSET - SAME \nAnna sits, holding back tears, as she listens closely. \nBEN (O.S.) Of course I do. \nJANINE (O.S.) Then you'll let me do this. \nThen a ZIPPER OPENING, a chair CREAKING - \nJANINE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Yeah, just like that, yeah... \nWe HOLD ON Anna as she sits there, stonefaced. \nINT. RED MAPLE - BAR - EARLY EVENING \nAlex has the staff (of about 10) assembled for the pre- shift meeting. He consults a clipboard as he talks. \nALEX OK - Tyrone you bus 4 through 6 - and pitch in with the servers when you - \nTYRONE No...I'm on 8 thru 10. I'm always on 8 through 10. Been working here 18 months doing 8 through 10. \nALEX Right.   Luis you take 4 through 6. \nThe staff looks at each other - perplexed. \nTYRONE Dude.    Luis quit like 10 months ago. \nAlex rifles through his papers, not sure what he's looking for. He slams his clipboard on the bar. \nALEX Do we even need to have this meeting? Seriously? Does this serve any purpose? \nThe group voice their opinions - a resounding \"NO\". \nALEX (CONT'D) Good.   Great. Get to work. \nThe group disperses, Alex heads around the bar.   He sees Kelli Ann walking away and calls after her. \nALEX (CONT'D) Hey, Kelli Ann - any calls for me? \nKELLI ANN Since you asked me 11 minutes ago?   No, not a lot of phone traffic. \nKelli Ann starts to turn away as she sees Alex grab his cell phone, look at it, then put it down. He grabs a beer, takes a swig - then grabs his cell phone again - staring at it, willing it to ring. He puts it down again. A HUGE SMILE grows on Kelli Ann's face. \nKELLI ANN (CONT'D) Oh my god. \nALEX What? \nKELLI ANN It's happened to you. \nALEX What has happened to me? \nKELLI ANN What's her name? \nALEX Who? \nKELLI ANN The girl, Alex. \nALEX There's no girl. \nAlex takes his beer and heads down the bar. \nKELLI ANN You can't hide it man. I know strung out and you are strung - out. \nALEX Please - \nKELLI ANN This is amazing. Can't focus, right? Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your email 100 times a day. Wishing you could write songs. Feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations... \nAlex stops at the office door. \nKELLI ANN (CONT'D) It's always the same. And it has happened to you, my friend. Trust me. \nAlex looks at Kelli Ann, her words settling in. \nALEX Shit. \nKelli Ann smiles, and as she walks away - \nKELLI ANN Welcome to my world asshole. \nAlex takes this in, KNOWING SHE'S RIGHT. \nINT. BEN'S OFFICE - EVENING \nMAYA (CONT'D) Well, your father and I had a glorious life together. \nANNA Are you kidding? All you talk about are the things you didn't do, the people you wish you could have been with, the Tim Buckleys - anything but the life you actually had. \nMaya looks at her daughter. \nMAYA Those are just dreams Anna. \nAnna tries to process this. \nMAYA (CONT'D) Now true - I did not like your father at all when we met. \n(MORE) \nMAYA (CONT'D) Or after we got married for that matter. But let me tell you this - life with him was a hell of a lot better than life is without him. \nMaya stands, walks slowly toward the kitchen. \nMAYA (CONT'D) There are worse things in life than settling. \nANNA Like what? \nMAYA Like wishing you had. \nAnna considers this. \nINT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAnna lays on her bed, staring at the ceiling. \nThe doorbell RINGS, Anna gets up to answer it. Almost as soon as she turns the knob, Conor is standing in the middle of her studio apartment. He is all amped up. \nANNA Hey, sweetie. \nShe reaches up to give him a hug, he doesn't go for it. \nCONOR See, why did you call me sweetie? \nAnna looks confused. \nANNA Because we always call each other that. \nCONOR Why? \nAnna doesn't have an answer for that. \nCONOR (CONT'D) I want to say something, OK? I mean, we call each other sweetie, and we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours and I washed your hair for you after you had that shoulder surgery and everything - it's like we're together. \nANNA I know that I - \nCONOR Let me finish. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I haven't been clear about what I want. So let me be clear. I love hanging out, but I am so attracted to you, and I just - I want both. I want to make love to you. I know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of my mouth - I just freaked myself out, too - but it's true. And I'm not sure what happened, or why we stopped - but I don't really care. I just -- \nANNA \nOK. \nConor is STUNNED. \nCONOR What? \nANNA \nOK. \nCONOR I'm talking about really doing this. Like a full-on relationship. \nANNA Right. \nCONOR With me. \nShe LAUGHS. \nANNA Yes. \nCONOR Did a bunch of gay people put you up to this? \nANNA Please stop talking. \nHe does.   They KISS. \nINT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER \nConor sleeps peacefully with his limbs wrapped around Anna. Anna lays on her back, eyes wide open, STARING AT THE CEILING. She's clearly not at peace. \nINT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DEN - DAY \nAll of Beth's sister's spouses - Steven, Devon and George - sit on the couch watching basketball. \nDEVON Shit!    Take him out.   He's done. \nGEORGE Jesus.   This isn't some exhibition game. \nBeth comes downstairs, with another set of dirty dishes, and walks past them to the kitchen. The guys are annoyed that she blocks their view. \nNeil ushers her in, shuts the door.    Beth looks around. \nBETH (CONT'D) I wanted to thank you. For coming by my folks' house. \nNEIL Of course. I really care about your dad. And I really love you. Even if I can't give you what you want. \nBETH You're what I want. \nNeil looks at her - unsure of her meaning. \nBETH (CONT'D) Our life together is what I want. Your love is what I want. Did you see those guys my sisters are married to? You are a better husband to me - without being married - than any of those real husbands will ever be. And that's enough for me. \nNEIL And you'd really be OK if we take the marriage thing off the table? \nBETH If you promise to love me and be committed to me - \nNEIL I always have - \nBETH Wait, I'm not done. And snake the shower drain when my hair clogs it, and let me eat Wheat Thins in bed. \nNEIL I do. \nBeth smiles.   They KISS. \nNEIL (CONT'D) So, I get to move back in? \nBETH I guess.   But, you cannot bring those. \nShe points to his pants - a RAGGEDY pair of CARGO PANTS. \nNEIL What? You're just mad at me, and you're taking it out on the pants. \nBETH Look, I gotta win something. I let you win the big battle, so throw me a bone. \nNEIL OK. We're not getting married, but I'm chucking the pants. \nBETH Great.   We both win. \nThey kiss AGAIN. \nINT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON \nGigi sits on her bed, head flung upside down, blow drying her hair. The phone RINGS but Gigi doesn't hear it. \nINT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - SAME \nAlex, in his office, paces as he talks into the phone. \nALEX Hey, Gigi. It's Alex. I was just wondering how you were doing. It's been a little while since we've talked -- and I was wondering how you were doing. \nAlex looks up. Tyrone is watching him, shaking his head. Alex motions for Tyrone to leave. He doesn't. \nALEX (CONT'D) Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you. Obviously. But you're out. So, call me. Sometime. Or tonight. I'm around. OK. That's enough now. It's Alex. \nHe hangs up.   Tyrone is unimpressed. \nTYRONE Dude. \nALEX I know.   I know. \nINT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - SAME \nGigi flips her head back - oblivious to the phone call - and checks her hair. She heads out of the bedroom. \nEXT. ROWHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nConor and Anna climb the stairs of a three story row house. A \"FOR SALE\" sign is outside. \nANNA You seriously get a ton of people bidding on this? \nCONOR I know it's crazy. But it's a neighborhood \"in transition.\" \nANNA So that means what - that hip gay people want to live out here? \nCONOR Yeah. Hip gay people, young couples, young families. \nConor smiles as Anna heads into the house. \nINT. ROWHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nANNA Weird - it totally reminds me of the house I grew up in. I bet there is a - \nAnna goes into a little nook off of the kitchen.   And pulls down a BUILT IN IRONING BOARD. \nANNA (CONT'D) We totally had this same thing. My mom would use this as her 'desk'. Isn't that bizarre? It was always covered with her little coupons and stuff. \nAnna looks up to Conor, who is just watching her. \nANNA (CONT'D) So, when do all the fabulous homosexual couples start arriving? \nCONOR Well, the open house is tomorrow. But I have this one buyer. I mean, I want to see if his girlfriend likes it first - \nANNA His girlfriend? \nGIGI Really?     What did you forget? \nALEX This. \nAlex reaches into his pocket and pulls out a PEN. THE \nSAME PEN THAT GIGI PRETENDED TO BE RETURNING TO CONOR. Gigi tries, without success, to suppress a SMILE. \nFADE OUT. \nINT. THE OWL BAR - NIGHT \nA speakeasy from the 1900s that hasn't changed much. A PIANO starts to play on a tiny stage - empty. And then - a terrified but determined Anna takes her place in front of the mic. And begins to SING. \nIt's a \"THE LAST GOODBYE\" by JEFF BUCKLEY - barely recognizable - more of a torch song. As she sings, she begins to gain confidence. We hear the song over: \nINT. WESTSIDE LOFT - DAY \nBeth and Neil's place. Neil comes in holding a few MESSILY PACKED BOXES. He is clearly moving back in. \nNEIL How did all this stuff fit in here fine before? \nBeth comes in after him, holding some of his clothes. \nBETH I don't know. It expanded. \nNeil collapses on the couch. Beth sits next to him, a pile of clothes on her lap. She looks down and laughs. \nBETH (CONT'D) No you are not trying to bring these back in here - \nBeth holds the CARGO PANTS that she protested before. \nNEIL What?    I have no idea what you're - \nBETH We had a deal. These are not staying. \nNEIL That's really gonna free up a lot of space. \nBETH They're going. I have a bag I'm taking to the Goodwill. \nNeil watches her, smiling, as she walks across the room. \nNEIL Okay, okay. You win. Just check to make sure there's nothing in the pockets before we give them away. \nBeth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets. And then she FEELS SOMETHING. Her face registers curiosity as she pulls out - A BLACK VELVET RING BOX. Beth looks at it, and when she looks up - Neil's down ON ONE KNEE. \nNEIL (CONT'D) I love you so much. So much. I want to make you happy. I need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy, too. \nTears stream down Beth's face.      Neil pops open the box, revealing an ENGAGEMENT RING. \nNEIL (CONT'D) Will you marry me? \nNeil gets up and KISSES HER. They kiss, passionately, for a long moment. And then: \nBETH Yes.    Of course, yes. \nINT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nGigi and Alex stand in her entry.     She holds the PEN. \nGIGI You came all the way here - at 11 at night - to give me back a promotional pen? \nALEX I thought I better come up with some excuse to get over here. Isn't that how it's done? \nGIGI Sometimes. \nAlex looks at Gigi for a long moment.    He looks nervous. \nALEX Look, I can't stop thinking about you. I drive by your place. I call and hang up. I'm turning into - \nGIGI Me. \nHe LAUGHS. \nALEX Yeah. \nGIGI Well, a wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl, he will make it happen. No matter what. \nALEX True. \nGIGI Hmmm. Because when I was hurling my body onto yours - you did not seem to want to \"make it happen.\" \nALEX Here's the thing about that. You were right. I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from these women, having the power - that I didn't know what it felt like when I actually - fell - for one of them. \nGigi considers this. \nGIGI Look, I've just been out with your friend Bill. And it just might be exactly what I need. No drama. He calls. He does what he says. \nALEX I could do that stuff too. \nGIGI But you didn't. And that same wise person told me that I am the rule. That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change - stop thinking that I will be the -- \nBut before she can finish her sentence, Alex KISSES HER. \n", "test1_input": "CONOR Hey, it's me...I just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you. \nINT. EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK GROCERY - SAME \nANNA, hot in an earthy sort of way, heads down the aisle. She holds her cell phone in one hand - a BOTTLED WATER and a BAG OF SOY NUTS in the other. \nANNA Conor, that's so nice.     Thank you. \nAs Anna gets to the checkout, there's one person ahead of her. He looks back to see her - he's BEN, good looking and supremely likeable. They share a smile. \nBEN Do you want to go ahead? \nANNA Hmm? \nBEN Go ahead?   You've only got two things. \nANNA (into phone) Hold on. \nShe looks at what he's got - a SIX PACK OF SIERRA NEVADA. \nANNA (CONT'D) You've only got one thing. \nBEN Well, technically it's six. And I'm still mulling over a gum purchase. So... \nHe steps aside to let her go.   She smiles. \nANNA (into phone) Hey, let me call you right back. \nShe hangs up the phone and moves past Ben, hands her things to the EMOTIONLESS CASHIER. As he rings them up - she looks back at Ben - they SHARE ANOTHER LOOK. \nShe hands the cashier her ATM card - he swipes it. \nEMOTIONLESS CASHIER Oh my word. \nANNA Come on. Seriously. I just deposited money today. There's no way - \nEMOTIONLESS CASHIER It's not that. Let me check something. \nHe turns and rifles through a stack of papers, finally finding what he was looking for. \nEMOTIONLESS CASHIER \n(CONT'D) Congratulations. You won. \nANNA What? \nEMOTIONLESS CASHIER Our \"Sizzlin' Summer\" promotion.     You're our 1000th customer in June. \nThe cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an IGLOO COOLER and hands it to Anna. She BEAMS. \nANNA Are you kidding? \nEMOTIONLESS CASHIER Do I have that kind of manner? A joking manner? \nAnna looks to Ben.   She looks like she's about to burst. \nANNA I swear to god, this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me. \nBen can't tell if she's kidding. \nBEN Really? \nANNA Is that sad? \nBEN No, it's - charming.     Congratulations. \nAnna smiles wide, admiring her cooler.    Then - \nANNA Wait, no. I can't accept this. You were here first. I didn't win at all. \nBEN Yes, you did. Trust me - it's fate.      You were meant to have that cooler. \nAnna throws her arms around him and hugs him. \nANNA Thank you SO MUCH. \nBen can't help but laugh. \nINT. NATIONAL BREWERY LOFTS - NIGHT \nConor enters his apartment.     ALEX sits on the couch watching TV. \nALEX Hey.    How was the date? \nCONOR Fine.   You know. \nConor heads for the kitchen, and turns back. \nCONOR (CONT'D) Why are you here? \nALEX My cable's out. \nConor returns from the kitchen with a beer. \n", "test1_true": "ALEX Nope. \nCONOR Shit. Anna gave me the \"I'll call you right back.\" \nALEX How long ago? \nCONOR 22 minutes. \nAlex winces. \nALEX Sorry, dude. \nCONOR Do I call back? \nAlex shrugs. \nCONOR (CONT'D) I know. I'll call back and say that I'm going to bed. \nALEX At 9:30 PM?    Genius. \nCONOR It is genius. Because then I can say: \"In case you were going to call me back - don't - 'cause I'll be sleeping.\" \nALEX Sounds foolproof. \nConor pulls off his jacket and tosses it next to a box - which contains about 50 FRISBEES. On each frisbee: \nA LARGE PICTURE OF CONOR, WITH HIS PHONE NUMBER AND THE \nTITLE: CONOR BARRY REAL ESTATE AGENT \nConor dials his cell phone as he heads back to his room. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON:   A CELL PHONE.    IT READS \"CONOR CALLING\" \nEXT. EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK - SAME \nWe TILT up to find Anna and Ben. Anna looks at her phone, presses IGNORE and stashes it in her purse. \nANNA Sorry.   What was I saying? \nBEN I think you were telling me how you don't want to be like your mom and wake up and realize you didn't pursue your dreams. \nBen opens his GUM and offers Anna a piece.     She takes one and laughs, a bit embarrassed. \nANNA Was I? Little intense for grocery store chatter. Sorry. \nBEN It's OK. I might even be able to help you out. There's a guy at my firm who has exclusively music clients. \nANNA That would be - amazing.      What are you - like my savior? \nAnna digs through her purse to find a piece of paper. She writes down her number, and holds it out to him. He looks at it, contemplating. He doesn't take it. \nBEN OK. Look.      I'm married.   I don't do this. \nANNA Don't do what? Help struggling singers? \nBEN Help hot Pilates instructing singers who happen to be very charming. \nAnna takes the slip of paper and puts it away. \nANNA Do you want to give me your card? That's legit. I bet you're allowed to do that. \nBen considers this. \nBEN Right.   OK.   I guess that would be OK. \nFROM INSIDE A CAR PARKED AT THE STORE: \nWe see Anna and Ben talking.     They shake hands awkwardly and Ben HEADS TOWARDS US. \nINT. CAR - CONTINUOUS \nBen gets in the car, bag in hand, and joins NEIL, 40, arty and kind looking, who's behind the wheel. \nNEIL So, who was that? \nBEN A prospective client. \nNEIL Yeah right. \nBEN I can talk to a woman Neil.        It doesn't have to be like that. \nNeil looks at him, smirk growing. \nBEN (CONT'D) Just drive. \nNeil starts the car and they pull away. \nINT. WESTSIDE LOFT - NIGHT \n", "test2_input": "Gigi nods - it's all under control. \nGIGI (reading off her paper) Hey, Conor. It's Gigi. I just thought, I hadn't heard from you and, I mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guy's call anyway, right? \nGigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she seems confused. She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing - \"What does this say?\". Janine looks - she's no help. \nGIGI (CONT'D) (clearly ad-libbing) I mean, we're all equal, right? More than equal -- more women are accepted into law school now than men, and we do better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot innocent people - (rifles through the pages) - I mean I don't know if you saw that Dateline - but women practically have penises now, right? (looks to Janine, helpless) Well, call me. This is Gigi. Call me. \nGigi hangs up, unsure.   She looks to Janine. \nJANINE Don't worry.    He's totally gonna call. \nINT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATER \nGigi stares at the PHONE. Then she feigns disinterest in the phone. It still doesn't ring. Finally, she picks up the receiver to listen for a dial tone. And PANICS. \nGIGI WHAT?   How can there be no dial tone? \nShe frantically jiggles the cord, then hears something. \nGIGI (CONT'D) Mom? Is that you? I can't talk now. I'll call you back. \nShe hangs up, stares at the phone again. A look of DETERMINATION crosses her face. She dials. \nGIGI (CONT'D) Janine. It's me. Conor never called, so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at Red Maple. Pick up if you want to stop me. (beat, then really fast) \nALRIGHT-I'M-INTERPRETING-YOUR-SILENCE-AS tacit-compliance-bye. \nGigi hurriedly hangs up, and heads out the door. \nINT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT \nA CROWDED, SCENEY restaurant/bar - with a giant red Japanese maple growing behind the bar (thus the name). \nWe follow a THIN, BLACK CLAD HOSTESS as we wind through the throng of stylish twentysomethings at the bar to: \nINT. RED MAPLE - KITCHEN - SAME \nA busy kitchen.   Off the kitchen a door leads to: \nINT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - SAME \nALEX sits at a small, cluttered desk, rifling through some papers. Then, from the doorway: \nKELLI ANN Knock knock. \nAlex looks up to see KELLI ANN - Red Maple's hot hostess, standing in the doorway. She makes her way in. \nALEX Hey. \nKELLI ANN So.    Here we are. Same shift again. \nALEX I know.    I make the schedule. \nKELLI ANN \n(FLIRTING) I figured it was no coincidence. \nShe leans against the desk.     Alex keeps working. \nKELLI ANN (CONT'D) I had fun the other night. \nALEX Yeah. It's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you. \nKelli Ann laughs, then thinks - wait, was that nice? \nKELLI ANN Anyway - I was thinking, maybe tonight after work...we could, you know... \nAlex stops what he's doing, looks up at her. \nALEX Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between us the other night was - fun. But we're way understaffed tonight - I even have to man the bar - and that's why I scheduled you. To work. So... \nHe goes back to work. Kelli Ann stands there, frozen. Alex can feel her eyes on him. \nALEX (CONT'D) Are we good here? \nKelli Ann's face goes flush. She tries to hide it.    She backs up, puts on a smile. \nKELLI ANN No.    We're good. \nShe leaves.   Alex exhales, goes back to work. \nINT. RED MAPLE - LATER \nIn the back doorway leading to the alley, Alex stands chatting with TYRONE, 18, a busboy, who smokes a cigarette he holds just outside the doorway. \nKelli Ann approaches, trying to squeeze through, and \nACCIDENTALLY (ON PURPOSE) SHOULDER BLOCKS ALEX. HARD. He has to take a step to catch his balance. \nHe turns around to see what happened, but Kelli Ann keeps walking eyes front. He and Tyrone share a look. \nTYRONE Dude. \n", "test2_true": "Tyrone laughs as Alex shakes his head, not happy. \nINT. RED MAPLE - HOSTESS STAND \nGigi enters slowly, looking around, searching for Conor. \nShe tries to move toward the bar as she's met by Kelli Ann, who grabs a few menus and slaps on a smile. \nKELLI ANN Are you joining us for dinner or - \nGIGI I'm meeting someone.       A guy. \nKELLI ANN Ugh.    Why? \nGIGI Hmmmm? \nKELLI ANN Nothing.   Sorry. For dinner? \nGigi continues to scan the place, not paying attention. \nGIGI I'm meeting someone. \nKELLI ANN I believe you mentioned that. \nGigi finishes her visual tour of the room - no Conor. \nGIGI I'm gonna wait at the bar. \nKELLI ANN That's a great idea. \nGigi walks off.    Kelli Ann takes her place behind the hostess stand. \nAT THE BAR \nGigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door.     Alex, now behind the bar, approaches. \nALEX What can I get you? \nGIGI Oh, that's OK. I'm meeting someone. \nAlex takes her in.       She's clearly nervous. \nALEX Oh, yeah?    Got a hot date? \nGIGI I don't know if you'd call it hot -- I mean this guy Conor and I have only been out the one time so -- \nALEX Wait - Conor Barry? \nGigi is busted. \nGIGI Oh, uhh, yeah -- \nALEX Conor's not coming in tonight. Did he forget he was supposed to meet you? \nGIGI See when I said \"meeting someone\" I guess that was kind of a broad term, kind of a wide interpretation of the word \"meeting\"- \nALEX Because I could just call him -- \nAlex reaches for the phone. \nGIGI NO! I mean, totally unnecessary. I mean, I actually was just - in the area - so I figured I'd just swing by and see if he was around - because - uhhh --- \nAlex waits, looking at Gigi, amused.    She is panicking. \nGIGI (CONT'D) I uhh, had to return his -- \nGigi frantically searches her coat pockets - searching for something, anything - and finally fishes out A PEN. She looks at it - and decides to go with it. \nGIGI (CONT'D) Pen. I had to return this - pen. He left this. So, I thought I should really return it before he - you know - (conspiratorially to Alex) -- freaks out. \nAlex looks at her skeptically.   And then takes the PEN, and inspects it. \nALEX Dr. Frankel - Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry. \nGIGI Look, I'm not gonna judge about what may or may not be important to someone. \nALEX That's not even his dentist. \nGIGI Oh, really?   Then who's his dentist? \nALEX My dad. \nGigi looks at Alex for a long moment, and finally folds. \nGIGI I'm Gigi. Conor and I went out last week. And I just...I thought if I ran into him...I don't know. I'm gonna go. \nGigi struggles to get out quickly. Alex looks at her - holding her pen, looking quite frazzled - and softens. \nALEX Hey. Just - hang out for a second. Lemme buy you a drink. \nGigi SMILES and sits back down. \n", "test3_input": "Beth hauls the dishes downstairs and through the den where Steven, Laura's husband, is on the couch, intently watching the golf channel. \nSTEVEN Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer if you're going that way? \nBeth rolls her eyes. \nSTEVEN (CONT'D) And a little plate of cold cuts if there are any left? \nBeth just keeps on walking. \nINT. POTOMAC HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME \nBeth walks by Paige, on the couch, and DEVON, Paige's new husband, on the floor, surrounded by a mess of VINYL RECORDS. He has an old BOBBY DARIN tune BLARING. \nBETH You might wanna kill the volume just a smidge. My mom is finally taking a nap. \nDEVON You think your dad really wants to hang on to all this vinyl? My collection could use a bunch of these. \nBETH Turn it the fuck down. \nBoth Devon and Paige look at her, stunned. \nINT. POTOMAC HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME \nThe kitchen is a total MESS. Beth sets the dishes down in a precarious pile of other dishes, and sees her sisters Laura and Catherine at the kitchen table. \nBETH I finally got mom to lay down in the spare room. All we have left to eat is some old jelly and ramen noodles, so after I tackle some of these dishes, maybe we can go to the store. Our new brother is trying to co-opt dad's property before he's even dead. \n(MORE) \nBETH (CONT'D) And Laura, your husband would really like a beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf channel. \nBeth looks up. Laura is pointing to Catherine, who has her head in her hands. She's CRYING SOFTLY. \nBETH (CONT'D) It's OK.     It's all gonna be OK. \nCATHERINE What am I gonna do without dad? \nBETH First of all, he's upstairs watching 'Oprah After The Show'. \nLAURA And second of all - you have us. \nCATHERINE But he's always been - the one who's there for me. \nBETH What about your husband?    Where the hell is he? \nCATHERINE Playing ultimate frisbee.    His team may make the quarterfinals. \nBeth rolls her eyes.    The DISHES crash in the sink. \nINT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nJanine sits at Beth's desk, across from Gigi, who stares at her in disbelief. Janine fiddles with a TILE SAMPLE. \nGIGI Do you know who it is? \nJANINE (shaking her head \"no\") It doesn't matter. \nGIGI So are you going to - leave - him? \nJANINE Gigi, he's my husband. He's not just some guy that didn't call me back. And he did admit it to me. He didn't wait to get caught. That takes courage. \nGigi is clearly STUNG. \nJANINE (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.     I know Alex was not just some guy. \nGIGI It's OK. \nJANINE It's my fault, you know. \nGIGI What? \nJANINE I'm willing to accept my responsibility in this. I forced him into getting married. He wasn't ready. \nGIGI Janine - this is not your fault. \nJANINE It is.  I've - changed. I used to be fun. I was fun when we met. \nGIGI You're still fun. \nA BEAT.   Janine looks at Gigi, the tears come. \nJANINE We never have sex anymore. \nGIGI Lots of couples got through lulls. \nJANINE No. We never have sex. Realistically, what did I expect him to do? \nGIGI I don't think that's really -- \nShe looks down at the TILE in her hand. \nJANINE This is too small. I gotta tell Javier. \n", "test3_true": "JANINE This tile. I gotta go.    Tell Beth I took a personal day. \nJanine grabs her purse, heads out as Gigi looks on. \nFADE TO CARD: ...IF HE'S SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE ELSE \nMARIEL (50's, highly manicured, upper class type) sits on a yacht in what looks to be the French Riviera. \nMARIEL My first husband was unimpressive. I found him in bed with his big breasted secretary when I came home early from the Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel sorry for him. My second husband was a pinch more creative. Cheated on me with my sister - but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious. At last - some intrigue, some mind games - though my sister's two year old eventually gave them up. But my last husband -- he was a gem. A veritable master at covering his tracks. I poured over his phone records, intercepted his credit card bills, had him followed on countless occasions - and never found a single shred of evidence. It wasn't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress. But the real master, I have to say -- is me. Three husbands -- countless boyfriends, and I haven't been caught yet. \nINT. LAW OFFICES - HALLWAY -   EVENING \nAnna SQUEEZES Ben's hand as they stride down the hallway to his office. Anna is trying to suppress a smile. \nANNA Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god... \nBen smoothly EXTRICATES his hand from Anna's.   He nods to COWORKERS as they pass. \nBEN It was all you, babe. \nANNA Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. \nBen smiles at Anna, as they round the corner of the corridor to his office. He goes in, and she follows. \nINT. BEN'S OFFICE - EVENING \nBen deftly shuts and locks the door behind them. \nANNA \nOH.    MY.   GOD. \nBEN This is really good news. \nANNA I cannot believe this. He liked my demo. Did you hear what he said? When he said it was hauntingly beautiful? Did you hear that part? \nBEN Yep.    I was sitting right there. \nBen smiles, and pulls Anna to him. \nANNA Thank you.     Thank you so much. \nWith that, they start to KISS. It gets heated. CLOTHES START TO COME OFF. MOSTLY ANNA'S. They make their way over to the LEATHER SOFA. \nBEN How is it that every time I see your body, I'm shocked at how beautiful it is? \nAnna smiles at the compliment. She starts to work on his shirt when: SOMEONE TRIES TO OPEN THE LOCKED DOOR. \nBEN (CONT'D) Dana, I need to go over the offering statement. Can I get a few minutes? \nBen continues to remove his shirt as he talks. \nJANINE (O.S.) It's not Dana. \nBEN FREEZES.    Literally freezes on top of Anna. \nANNA Is - \nBen FRANTICALLY puts his hands over Anna's mouth. Then, working with speed and precision, he GATHERS ALL OF ANNA'S THINGS and shoves her - NAKED - into the CLOSET. There isn't enough room to stand, so she has to sit. She looks up at Ben, he closes the closet door. \nHe goes to the door of the office. \nBEN Shit. I told Dana to get this lock fixed. One sec. \nJANINE Why do you even lock it? \nBen re-buttons his shirt, gives the office a once over. \nBEN I'd never get anything done if I didn't. \nFinally, Ben opens the door, and Janine is standing there, smiling. \nJANINE Can I come in? \nBEN Of course. \nShe makes a show of CLOSING AND LOCKING THE DOOR. \nBEN (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nJANINE Sit down. \nBen goes to sit behind his desk, confused. \nBEN \nOK. \nJanine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at his desk chair. Her skirt is way too long to do this, so she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt. Ben glances over at the closet. \nBEN (CONT'D) Janine, what are you doing? \n"}

{"test1_input": "HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU \nWritten by \nAbby Kohn & Marc Silverstein \nJuly 20, 2007 \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nWe float down through a serene, leafy park to the children's play area. There, in the sandbox, a BEAUTIFUL FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL plays among a group of kids. \nGIGI (V.O.) I have a theory about how this all started... \nA SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches. He watches the little girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle. \nAnd then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THE \nLITTLE GIRL DOWN. \nLITTLE GIRL Why did you do that? \nLITTLE BOY Because you smell like dog poo. \nSome of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one- liner. Our little girl's face turns red. \nLITTLE BOY (CONT'D) You're so stupid just like dog poo! You're made of poo! \nAnd then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE, smashing it. Finally, our little girl starts to CRY. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nOur beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her MOM. She can only get out one syllable between big, wet sobs. \nLITTLE GIRL Made. (SOB)   Of. (SOB)   Dog. (SOB)   Poo. \nMOM Honey, do you know why that little boy did those things? And said those things? \nThe little girl shakes her head no. \nMOM (CONT'D) Because he LIKES YOU. \nFREEZE FRAME ON OUR LITTLE GIRL'S FACE - TRYING TO \nPROCESS THIS. \nGIGI (V.O.) Uh - excuse me -- but what - the - HELL? Where did that rumor start? Because moms have been spreading it for years. \nBACK TO THE SCENE - THE MOM CONTINUES... \nMOM That little boy is doing those terrible things because he HAS A CRUSH ON YOU. \nWe see our little girl take this in, like she is just now beginning to understand the ways of the world. \nGIGI (V.O.) Do you understand what this means? We are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk -- that means he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that might serve us as five year olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood. \nINT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nA CUTE COLLEGE GIRL sits CRYING in front of her ANSWERING MACHINE, as her ROOMMATE looks on. \nGIGI (V.O.) Then, as we get older, we carry on this tradition of misreading the signals men send by encouraging our friends to do the same... \nThe machine evilly flashes 0 in the NEW MESSAGES window. \nROOMMATE #1 That Phi Delt so obviously liked you. I'm sure he just lost your number. \nINT. HIGH RISE OFFICE - DAY \nA HOT EXECUTIVE WOMAN stands in the office hallway, watching a SEXY MALE COLLEAGUE walk by. He does not give her a second glance. Her FEMALE SECRETARY looks on. \nSECRETARY He's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success and emotional maturity. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nA BUNCH OF TWENTY-SOMETHINGS sipping cocktails. One of them is CRYING - smeared mascara, puffy eyes, etc. \nCUTE TWENTYSOMETHING #1 Here's the problem. He likes you TOO much. You're TOO pretty and awesome.        He can't handle it. \nINT. BURGER KING - DAY \nTWO FEMALE CASHIERS WORK SIDE BY SIDE. \nCASHIER #1 Trust me. It's because he's just getting out of a serious relationship. \nINT. GYM - DAY \nTWO MIDDLE AGED WOMEN work out on ellipticals. \nMIDDLE AGED WOMAN #1 Trust me. It's because he's never had a serious relationship. \nINT. JAPANESE DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nTWO HIPSTER JAPANESE GIRLS making their way through a crowded Tokyo department store. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. FRENCH POLYNESIA - DAY \nA PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN weaves BANANA LEAVES with a FRIEND. \nFRIEND (SUBTITLE) I'm sure he forgot your hut number.    Or didn't get enough approval from his father. Or was eaten by a giraffe. \nThis last part seems to cheer up the pretty woman. \nGIGI (V.O.) Why do we say this stuff to each other? Why do we tell each other these lies? \n(MORE) \nGIGI (V.O.) (CONT'D) Is it possible that it's because we're too scared, and it's too hard, to say the one obvious truth that's staring everyone in the face? \nTHE SCREEN GOES BLACK.    AND THEN THE TITLE FADES UP: \nHE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU... \nINT. BREWER'S ART - NIGHT \nGIGI, pretty and approachable, sits in a booth at a hip Mt. Vernon date spot with CONOR, cute but holding onto his frat boy roots. They sip their near empty cocktails. \nGIGI So, Janine told me you're a real estate agent. \nCONOR Yeah. But don't worry - not one of the cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus benches and grocery carts. \nGIGI So just like on frisbees and notepads? \nConor laughs.    Gigi smiles -- she's doing well. \nCONOR You got it. \nGIGI Much classier. \nCONOR My thoughts exactly. \nGigi sips her drink, and looks at Conor. \nGIGI I wonder why Janine never thought of introducing us before? \nCONOR Yeah, I don't know, I ummm - \nTheir WAITRESS appears, cutting him off. \nWAITRESS You guys ready for another round? \nConor looks to Gigi. \nCONOR You want one more? \nGIGI Only if you do. But I mean, if you have to get going I totally ... \nGigi trails off. Conor considers this for a LONG MOMENT. We can see on Gigi's face that she knows that the outcome of this date hangs in the balance. It's an eternity. \nCONOR Umm.    OK.   Sure. One more. \nGigi breathes a SIGH of relief. \nCONOR (CONT'D) You had Ketel and soda, right? \nGigi NODS and SMILES, clearly flattered that Conor remembered her order. She scoots a little closer to him. \nEXT. BREWER'S ART - NIGHT \nGigi and Conor HUG outside the restaurant. \nGIGI Well, Conor, I had a really nice time. \nCONOR Yeah.    It was really nice meeting you. \nGIGI B-bye. \nGigi waves flirtatiously and walks away, smiling. \nShe turns around to look, and sees Conor TAKE HIS CELL \nPHONE OUT OF HIS POCKET. \nGigi TAKES HER CELL OUT OF HER PURSE and dials. \nGIGI (CONT'D) Hey, it's me. He's cute. I think it went well. \nShe sneaks another look over her shoulder to see Conor. \nGIGI (CONT'D) And I think he might me leaving me a message at home as - we - speak. \nWe FREEZE FRAME ON GIGI, mid-step.    Then, THE IMAGE \nSLIDES OVER TO FIND: \nCONOR - also in FREEZE FRAME. The image UNFREEZES and we continue with Conor as he DIALS HIS CELL PHONE. \n", "test1_id": 1758, "test2_input": "Neil walks into a vast space. Nice art, a cozy yet architectural look - a cool place to live. \nNEIL Hey, babe.    You here? \nWe PAN over to a couch - where BETH is wrapped in a throw blanket, watching TV. She's got her hair in a messy bun. \nBETH Hey honey. \nHe joins her on the couch.        And sees that the TV is off. \nNEIL Everything OK? \nBETH Yeah.   Just got off the phone. \nNeil gets up again. \nNEIL You want some tea or something? \nBETH It was my baby sister.        She's getting married. \nNEIL That's great. I've always liked that Devon guy. That's really great. \nBeth looks at him.    She doesn't look that happy. \nBETH Do you think it's great? \nNEIL Yeah. \nBETH So, you think it's great that they're getting married, but you never feel like we're going against nature or something by not getting married? \nNEIL No, babe. \nHe sits back down, puts his arms around her. \nNEIL (CONT'D) Going against nature is like that cat who started nursing that monkey. We're just two people who aren't married. \nBeth manages a weak smile. \nBETH Right. \nNEIL I actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married. Look at my parents - all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking. \nBETH Yeah, I know. I get that. \nNEIL Like I've always told you - I love you - and we don't need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship. \nBETH Yeah. \nNEIL Lemme get you some tea. \nHe exits. Beth starts to CRY, but quickly dries her tears, and forces herself to pull it together. \nEXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - MORNING \nA brick row house in an up and coming neighborhood - clearly under massive renovation. \nINT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - SAME \nWe make our way through rooms with plastic covering the doorways - until we find JANINE stepping into the hallway. She checks herself in a vintage mirror, straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find GIGI, on her cell phone. Gigi slams it closed. \nJANINE OK, so clearly he hasn't called. \nGigi shakes her head. \nJANINE (CONT'D) Maybe he's away on business. \nGIGI He sells real estate. In Baltimore. Staying in town is his business. \nJANINE Right. \nJanine ponders this. \nJANINE (CONT'D) Look, let me tell you - after the first time I went out with Ben, he didn't call me for eleven days. ELEVEN DAYS. And now he's like the world's best husband. That happens all the time. \nGIGI Really? \nJANINE Yes, really. \nGigi manages a small smile. \nGIGI This is all your fault. \nJANINE What?    Why? \nGIGI You set me up with him. \nJANINE No - you asked if I knew any guys and I gave Conor your number. That's not a set up. When I do a set up - I weigh pros and cons. I do my due diligence. All I know about Conor is he sold us this house. \nGigi peers out the window. \nGIGI He sold you a house in the ghetto. \nJANINE It's a neighborhood \"in transition.\" \n", "test2_true": "JANINE (CONT'D) Seriously, stop. \nGIGI He said he always hangs at Red Maple after work. Maybe I should do a little drive-by? \nJANINE Please, don't. He'll call. \nOff Gigi - panic seeping in. \nFADE TO CHAPTER CARD:   ...IF HE'S NOT CALLING YOU \nAMBER, pretty if a little thick in the middle, sits in the courtyard of an office park in her work clothes. \nAMBER Caller ID was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. Total invasion of my personal freedom. When a guy doesn't call me, it is my right - my duty even - to call him and hang up several thousand times. Or at least until his mother shouts at me in Albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone. I mean, calling and hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many wine coolers - and who is AT& f'ing T to take that away from me? \n(MORE) \nAMBER (CONT'D) Next thing you know, someone is going to ban me from sitting in my car in front of a guy's house, blaring \"Where Is Your Heart\" by Kelly Clarkson until his new stupid girlfriend comes outside and threatens to scratch my eyes out with her acrylics. I mean, a girl deserves freedom of expression, right? \nINT. GYM - DAY \nPilates class. We pan down the row of mats, STUDENTS obediently doing The Mermaid. We finally land on Gigi's mat: Gigi manages to twist herself into a passable Mermaid - as her CELL PHONE lies in full view on her mat. \nINT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nShower is on, curtain pulled. A CELL PHONE RINGS. An ARM SHOOTS out of the shower and grabs it from the sink. \nGIGI Mom, I gotta call you back. \nINT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGigi lays in bed, her CELL PHONE right next to her head. One eye POPS OPEN, checks the phone, and closes again. \nINT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nA typical, corporate style office. Walled off cubicles for the junior execs, outer offices for management. \nGigi is in her cubicle. Janine, her friend and, we now learn, co-worker, sits on Gigi's desk. \nJANINE So, this was at the end of the date, or at the beginning? \nGIGI End.   Why - does it matter? \nJANINE Yeah. \"Nice meeting you\" at the beginning of the date is normal. \"Nice meeting you\" at the end could be a blow off. \nGIGI Maybe it was at the beginning. \nJANINE Then that's fine. He's gonna call. \nGIGI Or maybe it was at the end.   Or maybe it was nice to meet me. \nJANINE Wait - was it \"nice meeting you\" or \"nice to meet you\"? \nGIGI Shit.   I can't remember. \nJANINE \"Nice to meet you\" is OK. \"Nice meeting you\" is like \"Do you want your receipt in the bag?\" \nThe girls look up to find BETH standing there, listening. \nBETH Remember the days when you guys at least pretended to be working when I came in? \nBeth heads to her office.   Janine and Gigi follow. \nBETH (CONT'D) Janine, how's the press release? \nJanine, clearly organized, flips open her notebook: \nJANINE Beckon the baking to begin! McCormick, the flavor expert, introduces five fun filled flavors that will definitely delight dessert divas! \nGigi stifles a laugh. \nBETH Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration - but otherwise good. (to Gigi) Where are we with the company newsletter? \nGIGI I am so almost done with that. It's just been a little hard to focus on my article about the two sets of twins in market research, when the guy - who may or may not be the guy of my dreams - refuses to call me. \nBeth looks at Gigi, more sympathetic friend than boss. \nBETH Look, after my first date with Neil, I called him. There are no rules anymore. Why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass? \nINT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nGigi sits at her desk, Janine standing by her side. She's got a few sheets of paper on her desk. \nGigi takes a deep breath, picks up the office phone and dials. Janine gives her a thumbs up. \nGIGI It's ringing. \nJANINE Pretty standard. \nGIGI (listening to receiver) Yes!   Voicemail. \nJANINE Your notes. \n", "test2_id": 1759, "test3_input": "Skip look at Larry again.   Larry meets his gaze. \nLARRY One, two - (he looks away) No. Thanks for playing.    Move along. \nSKIP It's that simple. \nCONOR You're right. That's no help at all. \nLARRY But listen - I can tell you this. Gay or straight, you're not going to get anywhere by being inactive. She clearly likes you - maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something. So the next time you're in the position - don't take no for an answer. \nSkip looks at Larry, concerned. \nSKIP That sounds like felonious advice. \nLARRY You're right. Let me rephrase.    Don't take maybe for an answer. \nConor takes this in - that's not a bad idea. \nINT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCute studio apartment. And Ben is in the bed. Anna walks in from the bathroom, in a robe. Ben watches her. \nBEN Wait.   Stop. \nANNA What? \nBEN Shit.   This is bad. \nANNA What? \nBEN I am so into you. \nAnna BEAMS.   She joins him in bed. \nBEN (CONT'D) I'm lying here watching you and I seriously have never felt this way before. I have to forcibly make my brain stop thinking about you. I mean, all the time. \nANNA Why stop? \nShe looks at Ben.    He's not smiling. \nBEN Because I don't do stuff like this. \nANNA Stuff like what? \nBEN Like having sex with women who are not my wife. \nANNA First of all, I'm not women.   I'm just one. \nHe waits. \nBEN What's second of all? \nANNA I didn't have a second of all. \nBEN I thought second of all was going to make me feel better. \nAnna thinks. \nANNA Second of all - I can't stop thinking about you, either. \nThey look at each other for a LONG MOMENT. \nBEN I have to tell her. \nANNA What? \nBEN I have to tell her. \nAnna's eyes light up, but she tries to cover. \nANNA I don't want to push you to -- \nBEN I want to be with you. And I can't do that if I'm lying to her. \nANNA You know what's best. \nAs Ben pulls her to him, she lets a smile take hold. \nFADE TO CHAPTER CARD:   ...IF HE'S MARRIED \nLOUIS, 60's, with a kind but very wise face, talks to the camera in his FORMAL DOORMAN attire, standing in front of a posh Upper East Side building. \nLOUIS Here's the thing - my daughter is happily married with kids and running a tanning salon on Staten Island. But if she wasn't, I'd tell her the same thing I'd like to tell a lot of the girls that come in and out of this building on the arm of a married guy. \n(MORE) \nLOUIS (CONT'D) And here is that advice --- get stocks, cash, annuities, a deed in your name. Don't settle for flowers and a shopping spree at Bendel's. Think to the future. We all know that none of these guys is gonna leave his society wife and let her keep half the money and the classic eight on Park Avenue. So, I wanna tell these young ladies, as long as you only have the guy for a finite period of time -- get something that can last. Because I guarantee you - he won't. And that's the best fatherly advice I can give. \nINT. RITE AID - DAY \nMary and Anna, in sweats and Ugg boots and dirty hair, both load their carts with cheap beauty products. \nANNA I'm not picking out china patterns or anything - but I've never felt anything like this before. \n", "test3_true": "ANNA No, he's not leaving his wife for me. He's just - he's a good guy. And he can't really explore what we could be if he's lying to her. \nMary looks at her. \nANNA (CONT'D) He's kind of leaving his wife for me. Is this crazy? This is totally crazy. We barely know each other. \nMARY I don't know.   Remember Becca, my sister's friend. Some guy waits on her at Bennigan's - by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one. \nANNA You're totally right.   It can happen. \nMARY Not for me. \nANNA Well, what about texter? \nMARY Texter has yet to make any verbal contact. I mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box, breathing through a stoma, and I'd never know because I never actually hear his voice. \nANNA I doubt he has a stoma - \nMARY That's not the point. The point is - I can't text. I'm not charming via text. My sarcasm doesn't come through, I can't type fast enough on the little phone keyboard -- \nANNA So don't text. \nMARY It's not just texting. It's email and voicemail and snail mail - \nANNA That's just mail - \nMARY Whatever. None of it's working. I've had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work, and then I call him back at home, and he emails me to my Blackberry, and then I text him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone -- and it just totally gets out of hand. I miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn't. That's it. Now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies. It's exhausting. \nAnna, who is trying a different shade of nail polish on each finger, calmly looks up at Mary. \nANNA So what about the singer guy? \nMARY Jude.    Yeah, I like him. \nANNA That's great. \nMARY Totally.     I felt like we connected. \nINT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nGigi sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, eating graham crackers and watching SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL on TV. The phone RINGS. \nGIGI Hello. \nINTERCUT WITH: INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - NIGHT \nEven in the office we can hear the din of the bar scene. \nALEX Oh, hey.     You're home. \nGIGI Where am I supposed to be? \nALEX Out.    It's Saturday night. \nGIGI You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me. It's kind of limiting. \nALEX I was just calling to let you know - I'm having a party at my place next weekend. You should come. \nGigi considers this. \nGIGI I don't know. Won't Conor be there? Might be kinda awkward. \nALEX He's in DC for the weekend at some real estate conference. But there's gonna be a bunch of single guys. \nGIGI So I will have plenty of chances to be awkward. Thank god. \nALEX Don't worry. I'll be there.      I'll talk you through it. \nGigi smiles. \nGIGI So, the party - is it like a big party, more of a mellow hang or -- \nA CRASH outside Alex's office. \nALEX Yeah, OK. Gotta go - I think someone just dropped 84 wine glasses. \nGigi hangs up, and goes back to watching her movie. \nCLOSE ON: The TV screen as Mary Stuart Masterson (as WATTS) and Eric Stoltz (as KEITH) hang out in a garage. \nWATTS Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who'll be swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips. \nKEITH I think I can handle it. \nWATTS It's cool. I was just gonna work on it with you but - if you're comfortable...great. \nKEITH Wait.   How do you work on it? \nWATTS Pretend I'm a girl, OK?    I mean, pretend I'm her...Amanda. \nGigi sits up. A light bulb has gone off. As she watches Keith and Watts kiss on screen, a smile crosses her face. \n", "test3_id": 1760}

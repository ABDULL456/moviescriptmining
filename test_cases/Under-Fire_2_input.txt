Oates emerges and meets Price on the torn up runway amidst the rubble. They look around at the devastation. 
OATES Well, I guess we know where the Guvmint is. 
PRICE (cynically) You can walk to work from here. 
OATES Convenient, ain't it? 
Oates starts to walk away, then stops and speaks earnestly, as if trying to connect to a real world that doesn't exist. 
OATES My brother just got married. 
PRICE I don't know your brother. 
Suddenly, the distant roar of a jet. All the soldiers on the field scan the horizon; Price looks up. The air raid siren goes off. 
A JET DIVES OUT OF THE SKY TOWARD THE AIRFIELD OATES AND THE SOLDIERS DIVE TO COVER 
JET STREAKS OVERHEAD and, instead of rockets and bombs, it drops something else: 
THE SKY IS FILLED WITH A MILLION PIECES OF PAPER The jet pulls out and disappears. All is quiet again as the million papers flutter in the sky above the airfield. 
Out of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots at the paper. 
Price grabs a piece of paper out of the air. It is: 
A PICTURE OF A SWIMMING POOL IN FRONT OF A CALIFORNIA HOUSE 
HE STARES AT THE IMAGE and turns it over. There is writing on the backside in Spanish and Russian. He looks around. 
OATES WANDERS OVER with a handful of the leaflets. 
PRICE What's this? 
OATES Great shit, eh? 
Price tries to read the writing on the back as Oates looks at a leaflet familiarly. 
OATES U.S. Gummint offers this house to any Cuban pilot flying Migs for the Rebels who chooses to defect to America with a Russian jet. We know they ain't gonna run off with no planes -- but the Rebs don't -- They're scared. They start thinking about that swimming pool. Damn near smell that chlorine. Starts workin' on 'em, and pretty soon they don't let the Cubies near a Mig. Use their own spook pilots and destroy their own air force in a week. Guaran-fuckin- teed. 
PRICE C.I.A.? 
OATES (proudly) Smartest guys in the world. (afterthought) Hey, you gotta scoop here, eh? You'll be famous. 
OATES shakes hands with Price who looks at the picture. 
PRICE (dispassionately) Maybe. 
OATES (looking around) I gotta run... have a good one. 
Oates heads off across the runway as papers continue blowing down out of the sky; Price looks up and speaks to himself. 
PRICE I love Africa. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOMS AT THE NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL - NIGHT 
CLAIRE STRYDER, 40, reads a report over the telephone as she times the call with a stopwatch. A photograph of Claire's high-school-aged daughter sits on her dresser. 
ALEX GRAZIER, 50, struggles with his tie and a drink at a dresser in the adjoining room. Their connected rooms are littered with hand washed laundry and the paraphernalia of their trade -- typewriters, tape decks, books, notes, pictures. 
Their love affairs of three years is ending. 
CLAIRE (on the phone) "...and so this strange war that features two provincial governments, three rival liberation fronts, and at least twenty-five tribal associations, grinds into its seventh year..." 
Alex picks up a Melodica, a novelty wind instrument, and tries to court her with "Caravan" as she files her story. Though mildly put off, she maintains her cool throughout the call. He thinks he's Paul Desmond. 
CLAIRE "...The Battle for the Airfield at Abou Deia is just another chapter in this endless story. From Ndjamena, Chad, this is Claire Stryder." (beat) No -- you didn't hear any music -- must be the connection. Okay? So long. 
She hangs up and rises more irritated than angered. 
CLAIRE Alex, don't play that God damn thing when I'm filing. (beat) We're late. 
Quickly expressed, her anger passes. 
ALEX It's my party -- we'll be late. You called it a "strange war" and an "endless story." If you filed that story for me, I'd say you were editorialishing. 
CLAIRE I like to editorialize. You drunk? 
Alex loves to be melo-dramatic and is quite conscious of his ability to charm. He's also aware that it's worn off with her. 
ALEX Drunk? Only with the memories of making love with you on the plains of Fianga as the first Army of Liberation marched in and opened fire. 
CLAIRE And freed the Proletariat. 
Alex raises a drink. 
ALEX Right.

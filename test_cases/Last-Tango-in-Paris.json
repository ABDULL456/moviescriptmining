I'll make them shut up. \nPaul gets up and TURNS OFF THE MASTER LIGHT SWITCH. Rosa's mother STANDS, SCARED. \nROSA'S MOTHER What are you doing, Paul? I'm afraid! \nPaul STALKS TOWARD her in the DARK. \nPAUL What's the matter, Mother? Are you upset? Don't be. There's nothing to be upset about. It takes so little to make them afraid. I'll tell you what they're afraid of. \nHe leads her by the ARM to the stairs. \nPAUL (CONT'D) They're afraid of the dark. Imagine that! Come on, Mother. Meet my friends. \nROSA'S MOTHER Put the light on! \nThey look up the stairs to all the GUESTS that are out of their rooms. \nPAUL You should meet a few clients of the hotel. Hey, folks. I'd like you to say hello to Mom. Mom, this is Mr Juicehead Junky here. And... Mr Saxophone, he's... He's our connection, Mom. He gives us some hard stuff once in a while. And right here is the beautiful Miss Blowjob of 1933. She still makes a few points when she takes her teeth out. \nROSA'S MOTHER The light, Paul. \nPAUL Say hello, Mom! This is Mom! Oh! You afraid of the dark, Mom? She's afraid of the dark. Oh, poor thing. All right, sweetheart. I'll take care of you. I'll give you a little light. I'll give you a little light. Don't you worry about a thing. \nPaul turns the lights back on. The GUESTS who are gathered on the stairs, scurry back to their rooms. \nHOTEL ENTRANCE \nRosa's Mother stares on as the COMMOTION CLEARS. A GUEST comes in the front door carrying NEWSPAPERS. This is MARCEL, (60's) Rosa's LOVER. He takes off his hat for her. \nMARCEL Good evening, madame. \nROSA'S MOTHER Good evening. \nPaul saunters into the room. He surveys the IRONIC SCENE. \nPAUL Good evening, Marcel. \nMarcel picks up on the awkward energy. He heads up the stairs to his room. Paul hands him a key on the way up. \nMARCEL Goodnight, Paul. \nROSA'S MOTHER Who's that? \nPAUL Do you like him? He was Rosa's lover. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - BATHROOM - MORNING \nJeanne, NAKED, roots through Paul's coat pockets. She finds his RAZOR, but scoots to the sink when she HEARS HIM COMING. She starts applying makeup and SINGING. \nPaul enters the bathroom. He takes his SHAVING ACCOUTREMENTS (razor, strop, brush, etc.) out of his coat pockets. Jeanne watches him intently in the MIRROR. \nHe joins her at the LARGE BASIN SINK. She pretends to have been putting on her make-up all along. She RESUMES HER SONG. \nJEANNE What am I doing in this apartment with you? Love? \nPaul starts putting his SHAVING CREAM on with a shaving brush. \nPAUL Well... Let's say we're just taking a flying... a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut. JEANNE So you think I'm a wore. \nHe MOCKS her obvious mispronunciation of \"whore\". \nPAUL I think you're a what? A what? A wore? \nJEANNE A wore. \nPAUL You mean whore. \nJEANNE Yes, a whore. Whore. \nPAUL No, you're just a good old fashioned girl... trying to get along. \nJEANNE I prefer to be a whore. \nShe applies more makeup. \n", "test1_true": "JEANNE To find out OOH you are. \nHe MOCKS her mispronunciation of \"who\" this time. \nPAUL To find out OOH you are. \nJEANNE Yes. \nPAUL Well, if you look real close, you'll see me hiding behind my zipper. \nJEANNE Well, we know that he buys clothes in some big store. That's not much. But it's a beginning. PAUL That's not a beginning, that's a finish. \nJEANNE Well, OK. Let's forget it. How old are you? \nPAUL I'll be 93 this weekend. \nJEANNE Oh, you don't look it. \nPAUL Thank you. \nShe LAUGHS. \nJEANNE Have you been in college? \nPAUL Oh yeah. Yeah. I went to... the University of Congo. Studied whale- fucking. \nJEANNE Wow! \nHe SHARPENS his razor on the STROP. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Barbers don't usually go to university. \nPAUL Are you telling me that I look like a barber? \nJEANNE No, but that's a razor's barber. \nHe CORRECTS her again. \nPAUL That's a barber's razor. \nJEANNE Barber's razors, yes. \nPAUL Or a madmans. He starts SHAVING his neck with the STRAIGHT RAZOR. \nJEANNE So you want to cut me up? \nPAUL No. That would be like writing my name on your face. \nJEANNE Like they do to slaves? \nPAUL Slaves are branded on the ass and I want you free. \nJEANNE Free?! I'm not free! You want to know why... (MORE) JEANNE (CONT'D) why you don't want to know anything about me? Because you hate women. \nPAUL Oh, really? \nJEANNE What the hell have they ever done to you? \nPAUL Well,... either they always pretend to know who I am or they pretend I don't know who they are and that's very boring. \nJEANNE I'm not afraid to say who I am. I am 20 years old... \nPaul EXPLODES. \nPAUL NO! I... Jesus Christ! Where is your brain? State zitta. Halt's Maul, Schweinehund. Shut up. Get it? \nShe stands, POUTING. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I know it's tough but you're gonna have to bear it. \nShe hits the sink and TURNS to us, we see her AMPLE BUSH. She crosses her arms and continues to POUT like a child. \nPAUL (CONT'D) You know, these sinks are really beautiful. They're very rare, you don't find them any more. I think it's these sinks that let you stay together. \nHe has finished SHAVING. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Hmm? Don't you think? \nHe FINALLY NOTICES her pouting. \n", "test1_id": 939, "test2_input": "JEANNE No and no! No! \nPAUL Repeat it. Say, \"Holy family.\" Come on, say it. \nHe grabs her arms, stopping her from STRUGGLING as he SODOMIZES HER. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Go on. Holy family. Church of good citizens. \nShe is WEEPING. \nJEANNE Church... \nPAUL Good citizens. \nJEANNE Good citizens... \nShe CRIES OUT in pain as he enters her. \nHe smacks her savagely on the back of her head. \nPAUL Say it. Say it! The children are tortured until they tell their first lie. \nJEANNE The children... are tortured... \nHer MUFFLED CRIES. \nPAUL Where the will is broken by repression. \nJEANNE Where the will... broken... repression. \nTEARS STREAM DOWN her face. \nPAUL Where freedom... JEANNE Free... Freedom! \nPAUL ..is assassinated. Freedom is assassinated by egotism. Family... \nJEANNE Family... \nHe DRIVES IT HOME TILL HE COMES... \nPAUL You... You... You... You f... You... fucking... fucking... family. You fucking... family! Oh, God... Jesus. Oh, you... Oh... \nHe COLLAPSES on her, SPENT as she continues to WEEP. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - MOMENTS LATER \nAnother couple of TRAINS go by. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - LIVING ROOM - LATER \nPaul SLEEPS more. On his STOMACH now, with his foot on a piece of FURNITURE. \nJeanne puts a record on the RECORD PLAYER she brought with her. She goes to plug it into the FLOOR PLUG but gets an ELECTRICAL SHOCK. JEANNE Shit! \nShe looks at him sleeping. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Hey, you! \nHe looks at her UPSIDE DOWN. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Yes, you! \nPAUL Huh? \n", "test2_true": "PAUL What? \nHe looks at himself in a SMALL MIRROR. \nJEANNE I've got a surprise for you! \nPAUL That's good. I like surprises. \nHe FLIPS HIMSELF over backwards onto his feet. He walks over to her and the RECORD PLAYER. He stares down at her. \nPAUL (CONT'D) What is it? \nJEANNE Music. But I don't know how to work it. \nHe sits on the FLOOR next to her. He plugs in the RECORD PLAYER. He JUMPS as he gets an ELECTRICAL SHOCK. Jeanne is secretly amused. \nPAUL Do you enjoy that? \nHe gets the RECORD PLAYING. It's some 70's HIPPY MUSIC. Jeanne sways to it while Paul reads the JACKET COVER. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PASSY VIADUCT PARK - DAY \nHIPPIE MUSIC CONTINUES \nTom and Jeanne sit, ROMANTICALLY ENTWINED on a SEA WALL while his FILM CREW films in the b.g. \nThey sit FACE TO FACE, he holds her shoulders and stares into her eyes. \nTOM Do you know why I sent the others away? \nJEANNE Because you're angry, or you want to be alone with me? \nTOM And why do I want to be alone with you? \nJEANNE You have something really serious to tell me. \nHe plays with her hair. \nTOM I have something really very serious to tell you. \nJEANNE Is it happy or sad? \nTOM It's a secret. \nJEANNE So it's happy. What sort of secret? \nTOM A secret... \nAs his FILM CREW dolly around them in the b.g., his SOUND PERSON yells at them. \nSOUND PERSON Speak up! I can't hear anything. \nTOM ...between a man and a woman. JEANNE Is it dirty or is it about love? \nTOM About love. But that's not all. \nJEANNE A secret about love, but which isn't love. What is it?! \nHe puts a LIFE PRESERVER over her. \nTOM Voila. That in a week I'm marrying you. \nJEANNE What? \nTOM I'm marrying you. \nJEANNE What?! \nTOM I'm marrying you! \nJEANNE You're marrying me? \nTOM Yes! \nJEANNE We're getting married? \nTOM Yes we're getting married. \n", "test2_id": 940, "test3_input": "DIALOGUE IS ENGLISH \nPAUL It's me again. \nShe stops and stares at him, DISGUSTED by his GALL and over him. \nJEANNE It's over. It's over. \nHe doesn't get the hint. He doesn't care what she says. He presses on PLAYFULLY. \nPAUL It's over, then it begins again. \nJEANNE What begins again? I don't understand anything any more. \nPAUL There's nothing to understand. We left the apartment. Now we begin again with love and all the rest of it. \nJEANNE The rest? \nPAUL Yeah, listen. \nHe puts his arm around her as THEY STROLL. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I'm 45. I'm a widower. I've got a little hotel, a kind of a dump. But it's not completely a flophouse. And... I used to live on my luck, and I got married. My wife killed herself. \nAND WE... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALLE WAGRAM SALON - DAY \nAs Paul WAXES ON, we watch a TANGO CONTEST in progress. He wanders RUDELY between the DANCERS on the DANCE FLOOR, invading their space and lighting a cigarette. \nPAUL'S VOICE But you know, what the hell. I'm... no prize. I picked up a nail when I was in Cuba in and now I got a prostate like an Idaho potato. But I'm still a good stick man, even if I can't have any children. Let's see. I don't have any stomping grounds. I don't have any friends. I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd probably settle for a hard chair and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a long, dull story even duller, I come from a time when a guy like me would drop into a joint like this and pick up a young chick like you and... and call her a bimbo. \nHe reaches the other side of the dance floor where Jeanne waits for him. She is able to SMILE now at his SHENANIGANS. \nHe has a real JOIE DE VIVRE about him now that he LACKED PREVIOUSLY. \nShe sits down at a GUEST TABLE on the outskirts of the DANCE FLOOR. \nHe approaches her table and FEIGNS a GENTLEMAN PERSONA. \nPAUL I'm awfully sorry to intrude but I was so struck with your beauty that I thought I could offer you a glass of champagne. Is this seat taken? \nJEANNE No. \nPAUL May I? \nJEANNE If you'd like to. \nHe sits down with her. He CLAPS his hands. \nPAUL Garcon! \nA WAITER comes over. \nPAUL (CONT'D) You know, the tango is a, is a rite. Do you understand \"rite\"? And you must watch the legs of the dancers. \nThe waiter comes over, he turns to chat with him. \nDANCE FLOOR \nWe watch one of the DANCE COUPLES DANCE THE TANGO. We focus on their LEGS and FEET. \nWe make it back to Paul and Jeanne and Champagne. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Oh, no! You haven't drunk your champagne because it was warm. And then I ordered you a Scotch and you haven't drunk your Scotch. \nDANCE FLOOR \nWe watch a DIFFERENT COUPLE DANCE. \nPaul tries to BUTTER UP (pardon the pun) Jeanne. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Come on. Just a sip for Daddy. \nShe takes a sip from the glass he offers her. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Now, if you love me, you'll drink all of it. \n", "test3_true": "She SLAMS IT BACK. \nPAUL Bravo! \nJEANNE Tell me about your wife. \nPAUL Let's talk about us. \nJEANNE OK. But this place is so pitiful. \nPAUL Yes, but I'm here, aren't I? \nHe kisses her on the cheek. \nJEANNE Monsieur Maitre d'H\u00f4tel. \nPAUL That's rather nasty. Anyway, you dummy, I love you. And I want to live with you. \nJEANNE In your flophouse? \nPAUL In my flophouse. What the hell does that mean? What the hell difference does it make if I have a flophouse or a hotel or a castle? I love you. What the fuck difference does it make?! \nShe PEEKS OUT A SMILE. He may just be WINNING HER BACK OVER. \nDANCE FLOOR \nWe watch a COUPLE as the MUSIC STOPS. All the PATRONS CLAP as the DANCE floor clears. \nThe PRESIDENT OF THE TANGO CONTEST speaks at a microphone. \nPRESIDENT The jury has chosen the following ten best couples: Number 3! 7! 8,9 ...11, 12...13, 14 ... 15 and 19! (MORE) PRESIDENT (CONT'D) And now, ladies and gentlemen, good luck for the last tango! \nMore CLAPPING PATRONS. \nWe get back to Paul and Jeanne. She sits 2 tables over, POUTING, while he struggles to light his CIG. She holds up her glass to him. \nJEANNE Give me some more whisky. \nPAUL Oh, I thought you weren't drinking. \nJEANNE But I'm thirsty now and I want some more drink. \nPAUL All right. I think that's a good idea. \nHe starts to bring the bottle to her then stops, gets his drink and brings it too. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Wait a minute. Because you're really beautiful. Wait a minute. I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to spill my drink. \nHe POURS HER SOME. She holds her glass up. \nJEANNE Let's have a toast to our life in the hotel. \nPAUL No! Fuck all that! Come on. No. Hey, listen. Let's drink a toast to our life in the country. Huh? \nJEANNE You're a nature lover? You didn't tell me that. \nPAUL Oh, for Chr... I'm a nature boy. Can't you see me with the cows and the chicken shit all over me? \nJEANNE Oh, yeah. To the house of the cows. \nShe holds her glass up again. \nPAUL Cows. \nJEANNE I will be your cow, too. \nPAUL And listen... I get to milk you twice a day. How about that? \nShe lays her head on the table. \nJEANNE I hate the country. \nPAUL What do you mean you hate the country? \nJEANNE I hate it! I prefer to go to the hotel. Come on, let's go... \nPAUL No. Let's dance. Come on. Don't you wanna dance? We can start again. \nHe crouches down. She CLIMBS ON HIS BACK for a ride. He pulls her on her back onto the DANCE FLOOR, through the TANGO contest. \n", "test3_id": 941}

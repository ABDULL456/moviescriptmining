{"train": "ULTIMO TANGO A PARIGI \n[LAST TANGO IN PARIS] \nWritten by \nBernardo Bertolucci & Franco Arcalli \nFINAL SHOOTING TRANSCRIPT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. PARIS FRANCE - PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY \nPAUL (50's) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN BRIDGE. He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE a train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD. \nHe BELLOWS TO THE HEAVENS. \nPAUL (ENGLISH) FUCKING GOD!!!! \nAs the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a private WORLD OF PAIN. \nBehind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's). \nAs she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a HINT of EMPATHY on her face. \nHe is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter. \nShe walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw. \nWe see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING. \nPaul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as he also notices the building. He REGARDS it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. APT. BUILDING - PASSEY - DAY \nJeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at 1 RUE JULES VERNE. She reads a FOR RENT sign on the door frame. She HESITATES but then RINGS THE BELL. She checks her watch. \nShe SMILES to herself then descends the nearby stairs. \nShe goes into a BAR. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KENNEDY EIFFEL BAR - DAY \nJeanne comes in and speaks to the BARTENDER. \nDIALOGUE IS IN FRENCH \nJEANNE A phone token, please. \nBARTENDER No tokens. At the end, on the left. \nJEANNE Thank you. \nJeanne goes to the TELEPHONE/WASHROOM. \nThe telephone booth is OCCUPIED. \nAs she waits, she watches in disgust as an OLD LADY cleans her DENTURES with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her mouth. \nJeanne STUDIES her own face in the MIRROR, puffing her cheeks up in judgement. As she does, Paul exits the phone booth, still LOST IN ANGUISH. \nAfter watching him leave, Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE. She speaks to her MOM. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Mama? Yes, it's Jeanne. I've found a flat to rent in Passy. I'm going to see it. \nShe puts her foot up on the seat. We see her LONG BOOTS as her SHORT SKIRT hikes up. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Then I've got to go to the station to met Tom. I promised him. OK, see you later. Bye! \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DESK \nJeanne talks to THE CRAZY CONCIERGE through a SMALL WINDOW who is SMOKING and has ROLLERS in her hair. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) An armchair by the fireplace would look good. \nPAUL The armchair should go in front of the window. \nJEANNE Are you American? You've got an American accent. \nHe gets off the radiator and WANDERS into the next room for SOLITUDE. \nLIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS But she has followed him. She OPENS THOSE WINDOWS also. He is forced into ANOTHER ROOM. \nDINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAs he studies a WICKER CHAISE LOUNGE, she calls from the other room. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Are you going to take it? Are you? \nPAUL I don't know. \nShe continues to LOOK AROUND. Her CURIOSITY of Paul gets the best of her. She peeks around the corner and watches him SIT IN THE CORNER. \nJEANNE What are you doing? \nShe thinks he is VERY ODD as he PLAYS WITH a lamp shade. Nature calls. She heads to the -- \nBATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAs the PHONE RINGS, she pulls up her skirt and sits on the toilet for a PEE. She looks around. \nShe finishes and FLUSHES THE TOILET as the PHONE RINGS ON incessantly. \nLIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe PHONE RINGS on... \nJEANNE (CONT'D) (PERTURBED) Oh la la. Should I answer It or not? Oh... \nDINING ROOM \nThey pick up the phone at the SAME TIME. Paul EAVES DROPS \nJEANNE'S VOICE Hello? Hello -- \nPAUL (to the caller) Hello -- Hello. There's no-one here. There's no-one. I don't know. He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her end, UNAWARE. \nPaul SNEAKS AROUND THE CORNER. \nLIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJeanne is STARTLED. She hangs up the phone. \nJEANNE So you're going to take it? You've decided? \nPAUL I had already decided. But I'm not sure now. Do you like it? \nShe's SPEECHLESS. \nJEANNE I don't know. I shall have to think about it. \nPAUL Think fast. \nHe WALKS OFF. \nJeanne picks her hat off the floor, lost in CONFUSION. \nThe front door SLAMS. \nShe walks toward the door... \nBut Paul didn't really leave. He walks slowly TOWARD HER. \nJEANNE I thought you'd left. \nHe STUDIES HER for a moment. He takes her hat and DROPS IT on the ground. He PICKS HER UP in his arms and CARRIES to the window. He puts her down on the window sill. They start MAKING OUT ferociously. \nHe RIPS her panty hose, UNDOES HIS ZIPPER and PENETRATES HER. They are lost in ANIMALISTIC SEX as she WRAPS HER legs around him. \nPAUL Ah... Oh, God. \nThey KISS SAVAGELY and HIT the floor as THEY CLIMAX TOGETHER. \nCATHERINE I'd have finished by now, but the police wouldn't let me touch anything. They didn't believe it was suicide. \nShe WIPES A MIRROR. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) There was so much blood everywhere. They had fun making me do a reconstruction. \"She went there.\" \nShe wipes another GLASS SURFACE. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) \"She came through here.\" \nShe opens the curtain to the SHOWER/TUB. It's INUNDATED with BLOOD. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) \"She opened the curtain.\" \nShe STARES at the blood... It's so much. She uses the SHOWER HEAD to rinse the blood off the tub. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) I copied all her actions. The guests were awake all night! The hotel was crawling with cops! They enjoy playing around with blood. She rinses the blood FROM HER HANDS AND ARMS. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) They were all spies! Asking if she was sad, if she was happy, if you fought, how long you'd been married, why you didn't have any children. Pigs! \nDisgusted and exhausted, she sits on the edge of the tub. We switch to PAUL'S SIDE of the PRIVACY SCREEN. We see he is DEEPLY DISTURBED by this situation. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) They got familiar right away! They said, \"Your boss is a bit unstable.\" \"Do you know that he was a boxer?\" So? (MORE) CATHERINE (CONT'D) \"It didn't work out, so he became an actor.\" \"Bongo player, revolutionary in South America, journalist in Japan.\" \nShe begins to clean blood from THE STRAIGHT RAZOR Paul's wife used to KILL HERSELF WITH. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) One day, he lands in Tahiti, hangs around, Learns French.\" \"Then he comes to Paris. There... he meets a woman with money, marries her and... \"Since then what has your boss done?\" \"Nothing.\" \nPaul pulls the curtains aside from the window. He looks out. He SPIES a BLACK COUPLE, one a SAX PLAYER, in an adjacent building. She is attempting ORAL SEX on him. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) I say, \"Can I clean up now?\" \"No! Don't touch anything!\" \"Do you really think she killed herself?\" He pushed me into a corner and tried to paw me... \nWhen the couple are spotted, they stop. He starts PLAYING HIS SAX. \nPaul has had enough of the running water and her cleaning. \nPAUL Turn the tap off now. CATHERINE They'll be doing the autopsy right now. \nPaul walks to her side. \nPAUL Why won't you turn the tap off? \nCATHERINE They told me to give you your razor back. \nShe hands him the STRAIGHT RAZOR. He STUDIES IT. \nPAUL It's not mine. \nCATHERINE They said they don't need it any more. The investigation is over. \nHe grabs her hands VIOLENTLY and studies them. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) Yes, she had cuts there... \nHe tilts her head back FORCEFULLY. \nCATHERINE (CONT'D) ... and on the neck, too... \nHe PULLS HER OUT OF THE WAY and turns off the water. He pulls the SHOWER CURTAIN closed. \nHe storms out of the bathroom, leaving Catherine there. \nWhen he is gone, she opens the curtain and turns the water back on OUT OF SPITE. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY \nFormerly known as the Passy Viaduct. We see a great shot of the DOUBLE-DECKER ROAD-AND-RAIL BRIDGE and PAUL'S NEW APARTMENT BUILDING. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - DAY The front door opens and Jeanne's hand comes in, holding the KEY. \nThe rest of her peeks in. She SPIES A CAT. She decides to make CRAZY NOISES at the animal, CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR, making it RUN FOR THE HILLS. \nJust then, MOVERS pop in carrying furniture catching Jeanne off guard. \nMOVER Excuse me, where shall I put this? \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Look, sir! I've got to go! \nBEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nShe walks across the mattresses with her BOOTS ON. Paul leans against the wall STUDYING THE ROOM. \nPAUL The bed is too big for the room. \nJEANNE I don't know what to call you. \nPAUL I don't have a name. \nJEANNE Do you want to know mine? \nPAUL No, no! I don't. I don't want to know your name. \nHe COVERS HER MOUTH and backs her up agianst a WALL. \nPAUL (CONT'D) You don't have a name and I don't have a name either. Not one name. She THROWS HIS HAND off and puts some space between them. \nJEANNE You're crazy! \nShe leans against the adjacent wall. \nPAUL Maybe I am, but I don't want to know anything about you. I don't wanna know where you live or where you come from. I wanna know nothing, nothing, nothing... \nJEANNE You scare me. \nBack to the OTHER WALL. \nPAUL You and I are gonna meet here without knowing anything that goes on outside here. \nHe indicates OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. \nPAUL (CONT'D) OK? \nJEANNE But why? \nPAUL Because... Because we don't need names here. Don't you see? We're gonna forget... everything that we knew. Every... All the people,... all that we do,... wherever we live. We're going to forget that, everything, everything. \nJEANNE But I can't. Can you? \nPAUL I don't know. Are you scared? \nJEANNE No. \nShe walks to the bed, inviting him with her eyes. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Come? CUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL - PAUL AND ROSA'S ROOM - DAY \nROSA'S MOTHER roots through Paul and Rosa's belongings. Searching for answers... and maybe some tokens of her DECEASED DAUGHTER. \nPaul WAITS, listening in the HALLWAY. He loathes the upcoming reunion. \nANNOYED by all the RATTLING while she searches, he bites the bullet and GOES IN. \nHe CATCHES her in the ARMOIRE... \nShe stops her ROOTING. \nROSA'S MOTHER I thought you'd be here. \nPAUL I expected you later. \nROSA'S MOTHER I took the first train. \nWe notice the IRONY of the SIGN ON THE DOOR, it reads \"PRIVY\" (PRIVATE). \nROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D) Oh, Paul! How awful! How awful, Paul! \nShe walks TIMIDLY up to Paul. After a moment, they EMBRACE each other in a GRIEF STRICKEN HUG. \nMOMENTS LATER \nPaul grows BORED of the reunion, he TAPS HIS FINGERS on the closet he LEANS AGAINST, studying the accessories of the DECOR and her silly hat. \nShe sits, SPILLING HER GRIEF on Paul as if it is a THERAPY SESSION. \nROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D) I already had some announcement cards. I've seen a lot of death. I think of everything. I'll prepare her a beautiful room with flowers. \nPAUL The cards, clothes, relatives, flowers. You've got everything in that suitcase. You didn't forget anything. But I don't want any priests here. \nROSA'S MOTHER But... \nPAUL No priests. \nROSA'S MOTHER But Paul... \nPAUL Understand? \nROSA'S MOTHER We have to. Funerals must be religious. \nPaul EXPLODES -- She jumps a foot back. \nPAUL No!!! \nHe DARES HER with his eyes, ENRAGED. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Rosa didn't believe! Nobody believes in the fucking God here! \nHe throws her suitcase AGAINST THE WALL. ROSA'S MOTHER Paul, don't shout. Don't talk like that. \nHe SNATCHES THE PAPER from her hands. \nPAUL The priest doesn't want any suicides. The Church doesn't want any suicides, do they? \nROSA'S MOTHER They'll give her absolution. \nHe RAISES HIS HAND threatening to HIT HER. \nPAUL Heh!? \nScared, she pushes on. \nROSA'S MOTHER Absolution and a nice mass. That's all I ask, Paul. Rosa... Rosa is my little girl, do you understand? Rosa... Why did she kill herself? \nShe starts WEEPING. \nPAUL Why? Why did she commit suicide? Why? \nHe PUMMELS THE DOOR with his fists ... ENRAGED... \nPAUL (CONT'D) You don't know? You don't know. \nHe closes her DOOR. \nHALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nSome of the OTHER GUESTS pop their heads out to see what the COMMOTION IS. He gently CLOSES THEIR DOORS in a \"mind your own business\" sort of way. \nThere is always the \"Miss know it all, busybody type\" though. \nShe sheepishly REOPENS HER DOOR. \nPaul walks calmly back to it and SLAMS IT in her face --- IRATE. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - DAY \nJeanne enters the ALREADY OPEN DOOR. She looks around the still sparsely furnished living room. \nLIVING ROOM - \nPaul has decided his BED FITS BETTER in here. The BOTTOM MATTRESS is on the floor in the MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. He LEANS AGAINST THE WALL and top mattress, WAITING FOR JEANNE. He knew she'd be there. \nShe TAKES A SEAT on the bottom mattress and takes off her boots. \nHe watches her and does the same with his shoes. KICKING THEM OFF and CATCHING THEM in the air PLAYFULLY. \nLATER \nPaul and Jeanne sit NUDE, entwined, WRAPPED AROUND EACH OTHERS BODY'S. \nDIALOGUE IS ENGLISH \nPAUL OOh... Now... Let's... Let's just look at each other. \nOLYMPIA'S VOICE Dogs are worth more than people. Much more. \nJeanne smiles, FAMILIAR. \nJEANNE Meet Olympia, my nanny. \nOLYMPIA Mustapha could always tell the poor from the rich. (MORE) OLYMPIA (CONT'D) If someone well-dressed came in, he never stirred. But if someone scruffy came in, you should have seen him! What a dog! The colonel trained him to recognise Arabs by their scent. \nJEANNE Olympia, open the front door. \nOLYMPIA Give me a kiss. \nJeanne stands and KISSES HER on the cheek through the gate. \nJEANNE Go and open it. (TO TOM) Olympia is a compendium of domestic virtues. Faithful, admiring, and racist. \nWe watch Olympia walk to the MANOR HOUSE as Jeanne WAXES NOSTALGIC. Slowly, the rest of the property is revealed to us. \nJEANNE'S VOICE After Papa died, we moved back to the family home for a while. My childhood was made up of smells. Musty smells, the smell of walls and rooms. \nA GROUP OF KIDS runs into the yard. Children used to come and play in my jungle, all day long. Growing old is a crime. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEANNE'S FAMILY COUNTRY MANOR \nJeanne holds up a PICTURE. She points to people as she describes them. \nJEANNE That's me there. And that's Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher. She was very strict... and very religious. \nOlympia CHIMES IN AGAIN from behind the CAMERA CREW. \nOLYMPIA She was too good. She spoilt you. \nThe Camera Crew turns the camera on her. Jeanne has a DIFFERENT PICTURE, pointing again. \nJEANNE That's Christine... \nThey turn back to Jeanne. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) ...my best friend. She married the pharmacist and has two children. It's like a village here. We all know each other. \nOlympia chimes in again from behind, in an open door. \nOLYMPIA I couldn't live in Paris. \nThe camera turns on her, then back to Jeanne. \nJEANNE We're safe here. It's odd looking at the past. \nTOM Cut! \nHe walks to her. \nTOM (CONT'D) Why is it odd? It's you! It's fantastic, it's your childhood. It's everything I was looking for. \nHe turns on his camera crew who is UNDER HIS HEELS, shewing them out. \nTOM (CONT'D) What are you up to? Move it! Move it! (to the lead crewman) Who are these zombies who are always following you around? (to all of them) Scoot! Go on! The door, the door... \nHe starts opening all the doors in the MANOR. \nTOM (CONT'D) I'm opening the door. I'm opening all the doors. \nJEANNE What are you doing? \nTOM Setting up my shot. There it is! That's it! I've found it. Reverse gear! \nOlympia is loitering in one of the rooms he comes in. Imagine her nerve, in her own house! \nTom is the typical RUDE FRENCH DIVA DIRECTOR. \nTOM (CONT'D) What are you doing there? Beat it! \nHe turns his attention back to Jeanne, the subject of his OBSESSION. \nTOM (CONT'D) That's it. Into reverse. Yes! Do you see? Like a car, you go into reverse gear. That's it. Close your eyes. \nShe closes her eyes. He guides her BACKWARDS by the shoulders through the MANOR. \nJEANNE Aren't my trees beautiful? They were my jungle. \nThey come upon the CROWD OF KIDS again. One KID is squatting behind some thatch, doing his business. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nKID 1 Having a shit. \nThe boy pooping stops and PULLS UP HIS PANTS. \nKID 2 No, we're doing a poo. \nJeanne SCOLDS THEM. \nJEANNE Shame on you, doing it in my jungle! \nKID 1 Watch out! \nKID 2 Run for it! \nThey SCATTER towards the STONE WALL with Olympia and Crew CHASING AFTER THEM. \nOLYMPIA Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go and shit in your own country! \nThe kids CLIMB THE WALL for escape from the CRAZY ADULTS. \nTOM Keep filming. Keep filming! Don't stop, whatever you do! \nTom wanders back over to Jeanne while Olympia and the Crew continue to SCARE OFF THE KIDS in the b.g.. \nJEANNE Did you get it? \nTOM Everything. \nJEANNE Olympia was great. It'll give a good idea of race relations in the suburbs of Paris. \nTOM It's a real jungle here. So, tell me about your father. \nJEANNE I thought we'd finished. \nTOM Five minutes. \nJEANNE I'm meeting someone for work. \nTOM But the colonel... the colonel! But Jeanne is OFF. \nAND WE CUT TO-- \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWe are back at Paul's new place. Jeanne WANDERS THE ROOM TOPLESS but covering her breasts with a PILLOW. \nShe continues to WAX NOSTALGIC about her father. \nJEANNE The colonel had green eyes and shiny boots. I worshipped him. He was so handsome in his uniform. \nPAUL'S VOICE What a steaming pile of horseshit. \nJEANNE What? \nPissed, she THROWS THE PILLOW she was covering her AMPLE BREAST with at Paul. \nWe now see Paul is LOUNGING ON HIS MATTRESS, pant legs rolled up past his knees, TOYING WITH A HARMONICA and drinking from a WOODEN CUP. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) What? Don't... \nPAUL All uniforms are bullshit. Everything outside this place is bullshit. Besides, I don't want to hear about your stories, about your past, and all that. \nJEANNE He died in Algeria in 58... \nPAUL Or 68 or 28 or 98... \nJEANNE 58, and don't joke about things like that. \nPAUL Listen, why don't you stop talking about things that don't matter here? What the hell's the difference? \nDIALOGUE SWITCHES TO ENGLISH \nJEANNE Peanuts? \nJeanne SMILES ON as Paul reels off a list of FOREIGN NAMES for the MALE GENITALIA. \nPAUL Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte. Prick! Joint! \nJeanne gets a kick out of this... Sort of. \nJEANNE It's funny. It's like playing grown- ups when you're little. I feel like a child again here. \nPAUL Did you have fun as a kid? \nJEANNE It's the most beautiful thing. \nPAUL It's beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy. \nJEANNE I wasn't like that. \nPAUL No? \nJEANNE I was writing poems. I was drawing castles,... big castles with tower. A lot of tower. \nPAUL Did you ever think about sex? \nJEANNE No. No sex. \nPaul MOCKS HER. \nPAUL \"No. No sex.\" \nJEANNE Tower. \nHe gives her a LOVE SMACK on the head. \nPAUL You were probably in love with your teacher. \nJEANNE My teacher was a woman. \nPAUL And she was a lesbian. \nJEANNE How did you know? \nPAUL That's classical... Anyway... \nJEANNE My first love was my cousin Paul. \nPaul explodes. \nPAUL No! I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid if you keep telling me names. No names. I don't mind if you tell the truth, but don't give me the names. \nJEANNE Sorry. Sorry. \nPAUL Well, go on. Tell the truth. What else? \nJEANNE I was ... He was dark, very thin. I can see him. Big nose! A big romance. I fell in love with him when I heard him playing piano. \nPAUL You mean when he first got into your knickers. \nJEANNE He was a child prodigy. He was playing with both hands. \nPAUL I'll bet he was... Probably getting his kicks. \nJEANNE We were dying of heat. \nPAUL Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else? \nJEANNE In the afternoon, when the grown- ups were napping... \nPAUL You started grabbing his joint. \nJEANNE You're crazy! \nPAUL Well, he touched you. \nJEANNE I never let him! Never! \nPAUL Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire, nose as long as a telephone wire. \nJEANNE No, I'm not. \nPAUL (CONT'D) What's that? What's all this? \nPAUL (CONT'D) Mad? \nHe throws her over his shoulder. He SPINS HER AROUND. She screams but goes with it. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Mad? Mad? Mad? \nShe LOVES IT. He puts her down on the sink. She is LAUGHING. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I think I'm happy with you. \nHe leaves the bathroom. She slaps the sink top, CHILDLIKE. \nJEANNE Again! Do it again! Again! \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DOOR - A LITTLE LATER \nPaul is all dressed. He is ready to leave. We hear Jeanne from the BATHROOM. \nDIALOGUE IS FRENCH \nJEANNE'S VOICE I'm coming! I'm ready. \nShe comes around the corner... \nJEANNE Shall we leave together? \n... Just in time for Paul to SLAM THE DOOR IN HER FACE. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Bastard! He's a git! Not even goodbye! \nShe THROWS HER PURSE at the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM - DAY \nA train enters the station. Tom gets off. He searches for Jeanne. \nWhen the Train leaves, we see her sitting on a bench on the adjacent track. \nShe notices him first. \nJEANNE Tom! \nTOM Jeanne! What are you doing there? I'm coming! I'll fly! \nHe starts RUNNING TO THE EXIT. \nJEANNE Wait! I've got to talk to you. \nTOM Why didn't you speak on the phone? What's up? \nJEANNE You must find someone else. \nTOM For what? \nJEANNE For your film. \nTOM Why. \nHe FRAMES HER with his fingers. JEANNE Because you're taking advantage of me! Because you make me do things I've never done! Because you're taking up my time! You make me do whatever you want! The film is over! \nA train ROARS into the station between them. Jeanne is ANNOYED. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) I'm tired of being raped! \nThe train is gone, but there is no one there... Tom is GONE. \nJeanne walks toward the EXIT. Tom appears on HER SIDE of the platform. \nThey STALK EACH other like ANIMALS. He SLAPS HER HARD in the head. She SLAPS him back. \nThey FIGHT until she collapses from exhaustion in his arms. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL Our room is painted white. Rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel. \nMarcel takes some LIPS SALVE from his bathrobe pocket. \nPAUL (CONT'D) To make it look like... a more normal home. But... it had to be changed here, too. I think she started with the wall. \nPaul takes notice of the LIP SALVE operation. \nMARCEL A cold sore. I don't know. Shit. \nPaul regards him for a second. \nPAUL You're lucky huh? You were... You must have been very handsome 20 years ago. \nMARCEL Not as much as you. \nPAUL You've still got all your hair. \nMARCEL My hair... I have to have it trimmed often. And wash it. I wash it nearly every day. \nPAUL Don't you have massages? \nHe massages his own temples. MARCEL Yes, I do. \nPAUL You're in good shape. \nHe paws at Marcel's stomach. \nPAUL (CONT'D) What do you do for... your stomach? That's my problem. \nMARCEL For that... \nHe gazes across the room. \nMARCEL (CONT'D) I have a secret. \nHe gets up and heads across the room. \nPAUL Tell me! \nHe takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on the top of a DOOR FRAME. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Ah... \nMARCEL Are you leaving us? I saw your suitcase was packed. Ah... America. Why was she unfaithful to you? \nPAUL You can't believe that Rosa... killed herself. It's hard for me to... believe, too. \nWhile Paul has a moment of REFLECTION, Marcel shows him his PULL-UP LEG KICK combo on his PULL-UP bar. \nMARCEL This is my secret! Thirty times every morning. \nPaul leaves, DISGUSTED. \nPAUL (ENGLISH) Really, Marcello, I wonder what she ever saw in you. CUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - DAY \nJeanne comes in carrying her FUR COLLARED COAT, purse and a BAG. \nJEANNE Are you in? \nShe looks around the place. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Is anyone here? \nShe kicks the door shut with her foot. She wanders to the... \nDINING ROOM \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Hi, monster. \nShe throws her coat and purse on the table. She puts a PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER in the BASSINET. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Is something wrong? \nFrom the other room we hear Paul... \nPAUL'S VOICE There's butter in the kitchen. \nJEANNE No. \nTOM Yes. \nJEANNE No! \nTOM Yes. \nJEANNE Yes? TOM Yes. \nJEANNE No. \nTOM Yes. \nJEANNE Yes? \nTOM No. Are we getting married or not? \nJEANNE I don't know. \nTOM So, yes, then? \nJEANNE Yes! \nTOM No! \nJEANNE Yes! \nTOM Yes. \nJEANNE No. \nTOM Yes or no? \nShe take the life preserver off and THROWS IT IN THE WATER. Together, they WATCH IT SINK. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JEANNE'S MOTHERS APT. - PORCH - DAY \nJEANNE'S MOTHER beats the dirt off her LATE HUSBANDS MILITARY JACKET. \nJEANNE'S MOTHER Of course, I'll send everything to the country. What do you think, Jeanne? \nINT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nJeanne tries on another of her FATHERS MILITARY UNIFORMS complete with HAT. \nJEANNE Olympia will be happy. I went there yesterday with Tom. \nHer mother joins her inside. She carries the FATHERS BOOTS. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) She's preparing a family museum. \nJEANNE'S MOTHER Of course, I'm not sending the boots. I'm keeping them with me. I get strange shivers when I touch them. \nJeanne goes into an ADJOINING ROOM while her mom continues reflecting, IRONING the JACKET. \nJEANNE'S MOTHER (CONT'D) All these military things never age. \nShe looks up just in time to see that Jeanne has found her fathers gun and is pointing it in her direction. \nJEANNE When I was little, it seemed really heavy when Papa taught me how to shoot. \nJEANNE'S MOTHER I'm keeping that here. In a respectable household, it's useful to have a weapon. \nJEANNE You don't even know how to use it. \nJEANNE'S MOTHER The important thing is to have one. It makes an impression. \nJEANNE You really kept everything of Papa's. \nShe shows her mom a picture she has scrounged up from her FATHERS WALLET of a TOPLESS NEGRO FEMALE. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Who's that? His orderly? \nJEANNE'S MOTHER A fine example of a Berber. \nJEANNE Oh. \nTOM What are they selling? Cars. Tinned meat. Cigarettes. \nJEANNE No. They're all about young couples. Before marriage, no children. Then the same couple, married with children. In short, marriage. The perfect, ideal, successful marriage. It's no longer the preserve of the Church. The husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged. Now, weddings in advertising smile! \nTOM They smile. On posters. \nJEANNE On posters, of course. But why t take poster marriage seriously? Marriage... Pop marriage! \nTom comes out from under a DRESS. \nTOM Pop? That's the formula. For pop youth, pop marriage! But... what if the pop marriage doesn't work? \nJEANNE Then you have to fix it like you would a car. The spouses are two workers in overalls bending over an engine to fix it. \nTOM And in case of adultery what happens to the pop marriage? \nJEANNE In that case, there are three or four workers. \nTOM What about love? Is love pop? \nJEANNE No. That's not. Love isn't pop. \nTOM Love isn't pop. So what is it? \nJEANNE The workers retire to a secret flat, take off their overalls and become men and women again and make love. \nThe fussing on the dress is finished. Jeanne slowly, PUTS ON HER GLOVES, relishing them. \nShe STRUTS slowly for all to stare and LAVISH her in her dress. \nTom is CAPTIVATED. \nTOM You're wonderful. \nJEANNE It's the dress that makes the bride. \nTOM You're better than Rita Hayworth. \nHe wanders out into the street. It is RAINING HEAVILY. \nBetter than Joan Crawford! Better than Kim Novak! Better than Lauren Bacall! Better than Ava Gardner when she was Mickey Rooney's lover! \nHes FILM CREW scatters for cover. \nTOM (CONT'D) What are you doing? Stop! Stop, but keep filming! Why aren't you filming in the rain? \nCREW 1 You're crazy! \nThey huddle underneath the DOOR of the FILM TRUCK. \nTom has lost Jeanne in all the HUBUB. He is disgusted with his CREW. \nTOM You're all fired! \nHe goes back to the SHOP. \nTOM (CONT'D) Where's Jeanne? \nDRESSER 1 She must have run off. \nTOM When? ln the rain? \nHe runs down the street in the rain looking for her. \nJEANNE Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY \nPaul comes POINDING in from the rain. He STOMPS the water off his shoes. He breaks into an IMPROMPTU SOFT SHOE. \nHe opens the gate to the ELEVATOR and gets on. He pushes the button. The elevator STARTS UP. JEANNE'S VOICE Please forgive me! \nPaul stops the elevator. He SENDS IT BACK DOWN. \nWe see Jeanne has been waiting on the ADJACENT STAIRS for Paul. She is still in her WEDDING DRESS. \nShe implores Paul from outside the elevator. \nHe really leaves this time. \nPAUL'S VOICE Rat's asshole with mayonnaise! \nHe LAUGHS at himself. \nJeanne is a BASKET CASE. She sits on her HAUNCHES, muttering. \nJEANNE I want to get out of here. I want to go. I can't stand it here any more. Yes. I'm going. \nShe gets up, gets her purse and goes to the door. We see her ASS through the SHEER FABRIC of her wedding dress. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) I'm not coming back... ever. \nShe gets to the... \nFRONT DOOR Paul is there, WAITING, NONCHALANT. \nPAUL Quo vadis, baby? \nJEANNE I forgot to tell you something. I fell in love with somebody. \nPAUL Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know, you're going to have to get out of these wet duds. \nHe PATS HER ASS. \nJEANNE I'm going to make love with him! \nShe opens the door but he closes it. She STOMPS into the HALL. \nPAUL Well, first you have to take a hot bath. Cos if you don't... \nHe walks toward her. \nPAUL (CONT'D) ...you're gonna get pneumonia, right? Huh? \nShe STOMPS a few more steps toward the BATHROOM. \nPAUL (CONT'D) And then you know what happens? You get pneumonia, then you know what happens? You die. And then, you know what happens when you die? I get to fuck the dead rat! \nHe THROWS HER OVER his shoulder and carries her KICKING AND SCREAMING into the... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM \nJeanne is in the BATHTUB. Paul sits on the BIDET behind her with a WASHCLOTH. \nPAUL Give me the soap. She does. \nJEANNE I'm in love. \nPAUL You're in love? \nHe shoves her head UNDER THE WATER. \nPAUL (CONT'D) How delightful. \nShe comes up ANGRY. \nJEANNE I'm in love!

I'm in love! \nHe HITS HER on the head with her own shoe. She just gets more ANGRY. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) You know, you're old! You're getting fat. \nPAUL Fat, is it? How unkind. \nJEANNE Half of your hair is out and the other half is almost white. \nHe smacks her in the mouth with the wash cloth, she smiles. \nJEANNE Where did they take the furniture too? It's empty. Where do you send his mail? Give me his address. \nCONCIERGE I don't have it. I don't know these people. \nJEANNE Not even his name? \nCONCIERGE Nothing! \nJeanne STORMS OUT. \nCONCIERGE (CONT'D) Ma'zelle! \nCUT TO: \nINT. PAYPHONE BOOTH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nJeanne is on the payphone in the bar from before. She speaks to Tom. Still DESPONDENT, tears stream down her face. \nJEANNE I've found a flat for us. 1 rue Jules Verne. Yes. In Passy. Come quickly! You'll come now? Do you know where it is? I'll wait for you. Come over. \nShe struggles to HANG UP THE PHONE through her grief. She BREAKS DOWN, closing the door for privacy. \nWe can SEE HER through the door as she leans on it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe front DOORBELL RINGS. \nJEANNE Come in, it's open. \nTom comes in. Jeanne stares out the window. She is BATHED in sunlight. \nTom LOOKS AROUND in b.g. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Do you like our flat? It's very light. There's a tiny room, too. It's too small for a double bed. It would be fine for a child. Fidel. That's a nice name for a boy. Fidel, as in Castro. \nTOM But I'd like a girl, too. Rosa. As in Rosa Luxemburg. Less famous, but I like it. You know, I wanted to film you every day. In the morning, when you wake up, in the evening, when you sleep. When you first smile, and I didn't film any of that. Here. He hands her FLOWERS. She REGARDS them. \nHe circles to her front. \nTOM (CONT'D) Today is the last day of shooting. The film is finished. I don't like things that finish, things that end. You have to start something else right away. \nThey EMBRACE and KISS. \nTHAT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nTom looks around the place. \nTOM (CONT'D) This flat is huge! \nJeanne has made her way to the DINING ROOM. \nTOM (CONT'D) Where are you? \nJEANNE I'm here! \nThey continue shouting across the apt. \nTOM It's too big! We'll get lost! \nJEANNE Stop it! Don't start! \nTOM How did you find this flat? \nJEANNE By chance. \nTOM We'll change everything! \nJeanne holds her ARMS OUT like a bird. \nJEANNE Everything! We'll change chance to destiny. \nTOM Go on, Jeanne. Take off! \nMUSIC RISES as Jeanne pretends to FLY AROUND the apt. from ROOM TO ROOM making AIRPLANE NOISES as Tom DIRECTS HER. \nTOM (CONT'D) Fly away, you're in heaven! You're soaring, you're in heaven! Come down, take a nose dive, come down! Make three turns, come down. Jeanne, what's happening? There's an air pocket. \nDIALOGUE IS ENGLISH \nPAUL It's me again. \nShe stops and stares at him, DISGUSTED by his GALL and over him. \nJEANNE It's over. It's over. \nHe doesn't get the hint. He doesn't care what she says. He presses on PLAYFULLY. \nPAUL It's over, then it begins again. \nJEANNE What begins again? I don't understand anything any more. \nPAUL There's nothing to understand. We left the apartment. Now we begin again with love and all the rest of it. \nJEANNE The rest? \nPAUL Yeah, listen. \nHe puts his arm around her as THEY STROLL. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I'm 45. I'm a widower. I've got a little hotel, a kind of a dump. But it's not completely a flophouse. And... I used to live on my luck, and I got married. My wife killed herself. \nAND WE... \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALLE WAGRAM SALON - DAY \nAs Paul WAXES ON, we watch a TANGO CONTEST in progress. He wanders RUDELY between the DANCERS on the DANCE FLOOR, invading their space and lighting a cigarette. \nPAUL'S VOICE But you know, what the hell. I'm... no prize. I picked up a nail when I was in Cuba in and now I got a prostate like an Idaho potato. But I'm still a good stick man, even if I can't have any children. Let's see. I don't have any stomping grounds. I don't have any friends. I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd probably settle for a hard chair and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a long, dull story even duller, I come from a time when a guy like me would drop into a joint like this and pick up a young chick like you and... and call her a bimbo. \nHe reaches the other side of the dance floor where Jeanne waits for him. She is able to SMILE now at his SHENANIGANS. \nHe has a real JOIE DE VIVRE about him now that he LACKED PREVIOUSLY. \nShe sits down at a GUEST TABLE on the outskirts of the DANCE FLOOR. \nHe approaches her table and FEIGNS a GENTLEMAN PERSONA. \nPAUL I'm awfully sorry to intrude but I was so struck with your beauty that I thought I could offer you a glass of champagne. Is this seat taken? \nJEANNE No. \nPAUL May I? \nJEANNE If you'd like to. \nHe sits down with her. He CLAPS his hands. \nPAUL Garcon! \nA WAITER comes over. \nPAUL (CONT'D) You know, the tango is a, is a rite. Do you understand \"rite\"? And you must watch the legs of the dancers. \nThe waiter comes over, he turns to chat with him. \nDANCE FLOOR \nWe watch one of the DANCE COUPLES DANCE THE TANGO. We focus on their LEGS and FEET. \nWe make it back to Paul and Jeanne and Champagne. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Oh, no! You haven't drunk your champagne because it was warm. And then I ordered you a Scotch and you haven't drunk your Scotch. \nDANCE FLOOR \nWe watch a DIFFERENT COUPLE DANCE. \nPaul tries to BUTTER UP (pardon the pun) Jeanne. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Come on. Just a sip for Daddy. \nShe takes a sip from the glass he offers her. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Now, if you love me, you'll drink all of it. \nThe JURY IS in an UPROAR. The tango President FREAKS OUT. \nPRESIDENT That's the limit! What are you doing? \nThey LIE ON THE FLOOR... They get back up and FEIGN some TANGO. \nThe President comes out on the floor now to them. She GRABS Paul who had DIPPED Jeanne over the JURY TABLE. \nPRESIDENT (CONT'D) You'll have to leave, sir. \nShe starts scurrying them off the dance floor. \nPAUL Madame! 'Tis ever love. \nShe continues to SHEW THEM AWAY. And she can hold her own against Paul's SMART ASS MOUTH. \nPRESIDENT Go to the circus if you want to see love! Go on! Get out of here! You'll have to leave. \nPaul now GRABS HER and starts spinning and DANCING WITH HER. \nHe SWEEPS HER UP into his arms. \nShe struggles and Paul puts her down. She continues to SHEW THEM AWAY. PAUL CONTINUES TO MOCK HER. \nPAUL Oh my god, I've never... \nHe pulls his pants down and MOONS HER. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Kiss me, sweetheart! \nShe is APPALLED and slaps him on the arm as he scoots to the door, Jeanne FOLLOWING. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Farewell, you sweet peach blossom. \nAs they get to the door he spins one last time. \nPAUL (CONT'D) I could dance for ever. Oh, my hemorrhoid! \nHe LOSES HIS BALANCE and slips. Jeanne has to catch him. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Beauty of mine, sit before me. Let me peruse you and remember you always like this. \nThey sit in some tables in a closed, darkened section. Jeanne puts her head down on the table in EXHAUSTION. \nHe CLAPS LOUDLY till she wakes up. He puts on his ENGLISH ACCENT AGAIN. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Garcon! Champagne! If music be the food of love, play on. \nJeanne looks OVER IT ALL. \nPAUL (CONT'D) What's the matter with you? \nJEANNE It's finished. \nShe COLLAPSES on the table again. He kisses her head. \nPAUL What's the matter with you? \nJEANNE It's finished! \nHe's OBLIVIOUS to her seriousness, AGAIN. \nPAUL What's finished? \nJEANNE We're never going to see each other again. Never! \nPAUL That's ridiculous. \nShe shakes her head NO. \nPAUL (CONT'D) That's ridiculous! \nJEANNE It's not a joke. \nPAUL Oh, you dirty rat! \nJEANNE It's finished. \nPAUL Look, when something's finished, it begins again. \nHe keeps his distance on the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET but still doesn't get that SHE IS SERIOUS. She tries to explain it to him. \nJEANNE I'll call the police! \nHe BLOWS IT OFF. \nPAUL Aha! I smell the henhouse. \nShe needs to GO WHERE HE IS. She starts toward him TIMIDLY. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Well, shit, I'm not in your way. \nHe feigns a GRAND GESTURE ushering her free travel. \nPAUL (CONT'D) After you, mademoiselle! \nShe TENTATIVELY walks on as he PRETENDS TO ALSO. \nPAUL (CONT'D) So long, sister. Besides, you're a crummy-looking broad. I don't give a damn if I never see you again. Shit. \nShe MAKES A BEE - LINE to her MOTHERS APARTMENT BUILDING. \nHe TAKES OFF after her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEANNE'S MOTHERS APT. - LOBBY \nHe gets himself BUZZED IN somehow. \nShe is SHOCKED, she backs up to the ELEVATOR. \nJEANNE It's over!

Help! \nOne FLOOR AFTER ANOTHER... \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Please, help! \nHe trips and STUMBLES up the STAIRS after her. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Help! Help! \nFinally at the top, he has to REST against the wall. \nPAUL Oh, man! She MAKES A DASH FOR her moms apartment. \nBut HE FOLLOWS. He grabs her as she tries to UNLOCK THE DOOR. \nShe runs across to the NEIGHBORS DOOR and BANGS ON IT. \nJEANNE Help! Help me! Help! \nHe tries to REASON with her. \nPAUL This is getting ridiculous. \nShe sees her chance to get back in her moms. She dashes over and UNLOCKS THE DOOR and flies inside trying to slam the door shut. It's no use, he FORCES HIS WAY IN. \n", "test1_input": "ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D) You're crazy! I'm starting to understand. \nPAUL Do you want me to make them shut up? OK. I'll make them shut up. \nPaul gets up and TURNS OFF THE MASTER LIGHT SWITCH. Rosa's mother STANDS, SCARED. \nROSA'S MOTHER What are you doing, Paul? I'm afraid! \nPaul STALKS TOWARD her in the DARK. \nPAUL What's the matter, Mother? Are you upset? Don't be. There's nothing to be upset about. It takes so little to make them afraid. I'll tell you what they're afraid of. \nHe leads her by the ARM to the stairs. \nPAUL (CONT'D) They're afraid of the dark. Imagine that! Come on, Mother. Meet my friends. \nROSA'S MOTHER Put the light on! \nThey look up the stairs to all the GUESTS that are out of their rooms. \nPAUL You should meet a few clients of the hotel. Hey, folks. I'd like you to say hello to Mom. Mom, this is Mr Juicehead Junky here. And... Mr Saxophone, he's... He's our connection, Mom. He gives us some hard stuff once in a while. And right here is the beautiful Miss Blowjob of 1933. She still makes a few points when she takes her teeth out. \nROSA'S MOTHER The light, Paul. \nPAUL Say hello, Mom! This is Mom! Oh! You afraid of the dark, Mom? She's afraid of the dark. Oh, poor thing. All right, sweetheart. I'll take care of you. I'll give you a little light. I'll give you a little light. Don't you worry about a thing. \nPaul turns the lights back on. The GUESTS who are gathered on the stairs, scurry back to their rooms. \nHOTEL ENTRANCE \nRosa's Mother stares on as the COMMOTION CLEARS. A GUEST comes in the front door carrying NEWSPAPERS. This is MARCEL, (60's) Rosa's LOVER. He takes off his hat for her. \nMARCEL Good evening, madame. \nROSA'S MOTHER Good evening. \nPaul saunters into the room. He surveys the IRONIC SCENE. \nPAUL Good evening, Marcel. \nMarcel picks up on the awkward energy. He heads up the stairs to his room.

Jeanne watches him intently in the MIRROR. \nHe joins her at the LARGE BASIN SINK. She pretends to have been putting on her make-up all along. She RESUMES HER SONG. \nJEANNE What am I doing in this apartment with you? Love? \nPaul starts putting his SHAVING CREAM on with a shaving brush. \nPAUL Well... Let's say we're just taking a flying... a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut. JEANNE So you think I'm a wore. \nHe MOCKS her obvious mispronunciation of \"whore\". \nPAUL I think you're a what?

I went to... the University of Congo. Studied whale- fucking. \nJEANNE Wow! \nHe SHARPENS his razor on the STROP. \nJEANNE (CONT'D) Barbers don't usually go to university. \nPAUL Are you telling me that I look like a barber? \nJEANNE No, but that's a razor's barber. \nHe CORRECTS her again. \nPAUL That's a barber's razor. \nJEANNE Barber's razors, yes. \nPAUL Or a madmans. He starts SHAVING his neck with the STRAIGHT RAZOR. \nJEANNE So you want to cut me up? \nPAUL No. That would be like writing my name on your face. \nJEANNE Like they do to slaves? \nPAUL Slaves are branded on the ass and I want you free. \nJEANNE Free?! I'm not free! You want to know why... (MORE) JEANNE (CONT'D) why you don't want to know anything about me?

Paul comes in and pulls up a chair next to ROSA. He turns on the LIGHT. \nPAUL You look ridiculous in that make- up. Like the caricature of a whore. A little touch of Mommy in the night. Fake Ophelia drowned in the bathtub. I wish you could see yourself. You'd really laugh. You're your mother's masterpiece. \nHe pulls the chair closer to her. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Oh Christ! There are too many fucking flowers in this place. I can't breathe. You know on the top of the closet? (MORE) PAUL (CONT'D) The cardboard box, I found all your... I found all your little goodies. Pens, keychains, foreign money, French ticklers, the whole shot. Even a clergyman's collar. I didn't know you collected all those little knick-knacks left behind. Even if the husband lives fucking years, he's never going to be able to discover his wife's real nature. I mean, I... I might be able to comprehend the universe, but... 'll never discover the truth bout you. Never. I mean, who the hell were you? Remember that day, the first day I was there? I knew that I couldn't get into your pants unless I said... What did I say? Oh, yeah. \"May I have my bill, please? I have to leave.\" Remember? Last night... I ripped off the lights on your mother. And the whole joint went bananas. All your... guests... as you used to call them... Well, I guess that includes me, doesn't it? It does include me, doesn't it? For five years, I was more a guest in this fucking flophouse than a husband. With privileges, of course. And then, to help me understand you, you let me inherit Marcel. The husband's double, whose room was the double of ours. And you know what? I didn't even have the guts to ask him. Didn't have the guts to ask him if the same numbers you and I did were the same numbers you did with him. Our marriage was nothing more than a foxhole for you. And all it took for you to get out was a -cent razor and a tub full of water. You cheap, goddamn, fucking, godforsaken whore. I hope you rot in hell. You're worse than the dirtiest street pig anybody could find, and you know why? You know why? Because you lied. You lied to me and I trusted you. You lied. You knew you were lying!

Open up! \nPAUL It's four in the morning. \nPROSTITUTE I need room four for a while. (TO JOHN) Half an hour? (TO PAUL) Yes, that'll do. Yes, half an hour. \nPAUL We're full. \nShe knocks on the door, INCESANTLY. \nPROSTITUTE That's not true. When you're full, you put a sign outside. I know the hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on the street. Call the owner. What are you waiting for? The owner has never made a fuss. Rosa and I are old friends. Open up. Paul opens up. \nPROSTITUTE (CONT'D) Don't make any trouble or I'll tell your boss. (TO JOHN) Come in, it's all sorted... \nBut the man has LEFT. \nPROSTITUTE (CONT'D) You've won. He's taken off. \n", "test3_true": "PROSTITUTE Hurry up! He can't be far away. \nShe PUSHES him out to the street. \nPROSTITUTE (CONT'D) Make him come back. Tell him he can't just walk off. \nShe SHOVES HIM out the door and DOWN THE STREET. \nPaul CHASES the man on foot for BLOCKS and BLOCKS. \nHe finally CATCHES UP to him in a --- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARIS STREET - ALLEY - MORNING \nThe JOHN figures he has gotten away. He reverses his TRENCH COAT to the appropriate side. \nPaul comes around the corner. The John doesn't see any HOSTILITY coming. But it DOES. \nJOHN Oh,... please don't tell her you found me. I don't fancy it any more. Did you see her face? Once, my wife satisfied me. But now she's got a skin disease. It's like snakeskin. Put yourself in my place. \nPaul grabs him by the tie and drags him. \nPAUL Come. Come with me. \nThe man FIGHTS BACK. \nJOHN But... Let go of me! \nPaul doesn't like that. He ROUGHS HIM UP, throwing him from WALL TO WALL. \nJOHN (CONT'D) You're crazy! Let go of me! Let go! \nHe ends up on the ground MINUS HIS COAT. Paul KICKS HIM IN THE ASS like a dog. \nPAUL Get the fuck out of here! \nThe man RUNS OFF. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Faggot! \nPaul heads back up the ALLEY as the man CONTINUES OFF in the f.g. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL - PAUL AND ROSA'S ROOM - DAY \nPaul lays down on his TWIN BED with his ROBE on over his clothes. \nWe see that his BAGS ARE PACKED. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - BEDROOM - DAY \nWe see that the mattress is gone. Only a pile of sheets and pillows remain in the room. \nJeanne is on the floor, on her knees, doubled over in SICK GRIEF. PAUL HAS MOVED OUT. \nJEANNE No! \nShe WANDERS through the apt., GRIEF STRICKEN, from room to room. We see only a FEW BELONGINGS left around. Shoes, the CAT (where was it for the \"rat problem\"?) and phone. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJeanne RIPS THE SHEET OFF the piece of furniture that has been COVERED UP all along. We all wondered what was underneath that was so precious. \nIt's nothing special. She COLLAPSES in grief again, the furniture falling on her, she KICKS IT OFF. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DESK - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nJeanne talks to the CRAZY Concierge from BEFORE. Her head STUCK through the LITTLE WINDOW while the crazy woman PUFFS a cig. \nJEANNE Try and remember! The man from the fourth floor. He moved in a few days ago. \nCONCIERGE I told you, I don't know anyone. They come and go. The man on the fourth, the woman on the first. What do I know? \nShe gives a CRAZY CACKLE. \n", "test3_id": 941}

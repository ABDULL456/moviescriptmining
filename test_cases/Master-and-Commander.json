{"train": "MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD \nWritten by \nJohn Collee & Peter Weir \n1. THE OCEAN - DUSK \nFrom blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering, abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided valleys of water. \nFinally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the ocean and an adjacent coastline. \nIn a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel. \n2. THE SHIP - DUSK \n[   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her great guns projecting from every gun-port. \nAs the ship glides past and away from us, her name is visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise. \n3. ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK \nThe ship in silhouette - RUN CAPTION: \nHMS Surprise Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls. Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806 Mission: Intercept and destroy French Privateer, Acheron \n5.   THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK \nCAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the table, studying charts. \nHis servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow. \nJACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops below the great casement windows. \nKILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and retires. JACK (Absently) Thankee Killick \n4. THE CHARTS: \na beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline. \nJack's hands place a second chart on top of the first, bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view. Then another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one. \nOn the final chart we can read navigational symbols and detailed information in fine copperplate script: \n6 fa. Shoals suddenly to half fa. Rocks (exact position unknown). Hidden reef. \n6. BELOW DECKS - NIGHT \nAnother lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant TOM PULLINGS, his pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running from brow to chin. \nHe is making a final tour of inspection before lights out. \n7. THE DOCTOR'S CABIN - NIGHT \nDr STEPHEN MATURIN, a keen naturalist, sits at his desk surrounded by specimen jars, books and scientific instruments. \nTOM PULLINGS glances in as he moves past the cabin door, but the doctor, placing weights on some finely-balanced structure, is too engrossed to notice him. \n8. MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - NIGHT \nIn the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from an early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles. \nPETER CALAMY (16) and LORD BLAKENEY (13) are arguing about whether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth mates BOYLE (15) and WILLIAMSON (14) wait for the game to resume. \nBLAKENEY In CALAMY Out. \nBLAKENEY In. It was here. The line is in. \nCALAMY It was there. It was out. Out \nBLAKENEY In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say. \nThe lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much older than the rest. This is HOLLOM, aged 24. He's a sensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing up briefly as TOM PULLINGS passes. \n9. GUN-DECK - NIGHT \nBy the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few of the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog. \nFaster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down greedily \nOne man, BECKETT, sits shirtless while another, AWKWARD DAVIES, brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first link of what will be a great chain round BECKETT's waist. \nJOE PLAICE, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in the middle of a story as PULLINGS passes, everyone knuckling their foreheads in deference to the officer. \n10.    BETWEEN TWO GUNS - NIGHT \nBoys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of 'jacks' with some sheep bones. ADDISON, RYE and SWIFT are the powder-monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns during action. \nA hint of daylight to the east. The mist beginning to shift as an offshore breeze picks up. LEAD-MAN 90 fathoms, white shelly sand. \nCALAMY Four knots, Sir. \nBONDEN is still at the wheel. \nBONDEN Oi reckon as she's liftin' Sir, if you feels like putting your \u00e9ad down. \nJACK takes his advice and goes below again. \n19. - THE SHIP (TIMELAPSE) \nThe sky a shade paler. A wind coming up. \n20.    ON THE STARBOARD GANGWAY - DAWN \nThe lookout, VINCENT, peers into the mist. \nVINCENT Starboard gangway ahoy. \nHOLLOM, the oldest of the midshipmen, whose watch it now is, appears at his shoulder. \nHOLLOM What is it, Vincent? \nVINCENT I heard something. A bell. \nHOLLOM peers out into the fog, then turns. \nHOLLOM Native fisherman perhaps. (shouts) Mr. Calamy! \nMidshipman CALAMY comes running forward. \nHOLLOM (CONT'D) The lead, if you please. \nYoung CALAMY takes the lead, scrambles into the chains at the bow of the ship and throws out the lead line. \nHOLLOM takes up a telescope and searches through the eddies of fog. Over HOLLOM's P.O.V. we can hear CALAMY sounding the depth. \nCALAMY (O.S.) Sixty fathoms, white sand! \nHollom folds his telescope \nHOLLOM Well. It can't have been a reef marker. \nCALAMY, unconvinced, checks through his own telescope \nHOLLOM (CONT'D) False alarm Mr CALAMY \nCALAMY ignores him, still scanning \n21.   TELESCOPE POV \nThe telescope pans. A dark shape in the distance. The mist parts a little. A ship. Coming straight toward them. \nClose on CALAMY as he turns to camera, screaming - \nCALAMY Enemy on the larboard bow! Beat to quarters! \n22. JACK'S SLEEP CABIN \nJACK instantly awake, piling out of his bed, still dressed. \n23.     BERTH-DECK - DAWN \nA drum blazes as the off-duty watch tumble out of their hammocks and run to their battle stations. \n24. COCKPIT, ORLOP DECK \nRows of wicked-looking instruments are hastily thrown on the operating table by PADEEN, MATURIN's servant - saws, retractors and knives glistening in the lamp-light. \nDR. MATURIN hurries in blinking sleep out of his eyes as he ties on his black apron - behind him, HIGGINS, the assistant surgeon. \n25.   POWDER MAGAZINE \nLittle ADDISON and his team of powder-monkeys run with their boxes of gunpowder to the... \n26. GUN-DECK \nAs LAMB, NAGEL and the other carpenters bash down cabin partitions, transforming the entire gun-deck into a single continuous space, from the bows to the Captain's Great Cabin in the stern. \nAs the crews swarm about their guns, grotesque shadows are thrown on the walls and ceiling by the numerous battle- lanterns arriving to illuminate the scene. \n27. WEATHER-DECK \nJACK and PULLINGS stride the length of the deck toward the bow [ ] . They pass crews manning the carronades while others swing the ship's small boats out and over the side to be towed behind the ship. \n28. FORECASTLE \nPULLINGS Fire on the uproll. \nThe little drummer's huge eyes are fixed on PULLINGS' face. The ship rolls. \nPULLINGS (CONT'D) Fire! \nThe drum-roll is all but drowned by the blast of the guns. \nThe smoke clears, the gunners look on baffled as their balls bounce harmlessly off the side of the enemy ship. \nOLD SPONGE (In Greek) Witchcraft! \nDOUDLE Never seen the like of it \nPULLINGS Damn and blast you! See to your guns! Fire high! Fire for the masts and rigging! \nAs the enemy's murderous long guns run out again. \n41.   WIDE ON THE ENEMY SHIP \nHer French ensign clearly visible as she swings broadside on to the approaching Surprise - again her side lights up in a series of red flashes. \n42.   IN THE COCKPIT \nBy the dim light of a battle-lantern STEPHEN struggles to hold a wounded man on the table, his feet slipping in pools of blood on the deck. \nSTEPHEN More sand on the floor, Mr. Higgins! \nThe slightly hung-over HIGGINS reaches for the sand bucket and is thrown over by the awful jarring shock as the Acheron's third broadside hits home. \n43.   IN THE GREAT CABIN - \nThe Captain's crockery smashes to the deck. KILLICK, cursing freely, stows what he can. 44.   IN THE ORLOP \nShards of timber implode, followed by a great spout of water knocking the massive AWKWARD DAVIES sideways as he runs for the ladder carrying two cannon-balls. \nA second explosion, a second jet of water and DAVIES, finding his feet, starts yelling for the carpenter. \nDAVIES Wood and Lead! Mr Nagel! Mr Lamb!! \n45. STAIRS \nFollow DAVIES as he runs up to the gun-deck with the shot under his arms past the powder-monkeys ADDISON and SWIFT, canisters of gun-powder slung over their shoulders, then he sees MR. LAMB, the carpenter. \nDAVIES Orlop! We're holed! \nAs LAMB dives for the ladder. \n46.   ON THE GUN-DECK \nDAVIES arrives to find a gaping hole opposite where his own gun once stood. Its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or dead. \nThe dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around dangerously. HOLLOM, the sole survivor, is backed against the bulkhead, cradling an injured arm. \nCALAMY emerges from the smoke, meets DAVIES's horror-struck gaze and takes command. \nCALAMY Davies! Get those bodies overboard! (to HOLLOM) Mr. Hollom sir! \nHOLLOM sits immobilized by fear. CALAMY grabs the poulterer, JEMMY DUCKS, who has been rescuing the ship's goat, Aspasia. \nCALAMY (CONT'D) Jemmy - leave the damned goat and take Mr. Hollom below. \nJEMMY DUCKS Aye, sir! \nThe ship heels as she turns. \nMidshipman BLAKENEY, Calamy's rival in the game of marbles, turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free. He throws a hammock net under it, stopping its roll before it crushes CALAMY against the bulkhead. \nCALAMY shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft. BLAKENEY carries on shouting to the powder-monkeys - \nBLAKENEY More shot! More cartridge! \n47.   HULL OF THE SURPRISE \nIn the great jagged hole on the gun-deck where the gun was destroyed, JACK stands framed, a wrathful soot-stained figure. He glances back at his men, hunched and ready, itching to fire. \nJACK (bellows) Steady... Wait for it! \n48. WIDE ON THE BATTLE \nto see the two ships about to pass abreast, the Surprise heading south as it were, the enemy ship, north. \nThe French vessel is clearly the bigger ship, and from both come the sounds of shouted orders and the thunder of drums. They will pass broadside to broadside, 500 yards apart. \n49.   GUN-DECK, SURPRISE \nJACK watching the enemy, judging the moment. \n61.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE \nSudden feverish activity, running and shouting as men scramble down into the boats. DAVIES settles himself beside NAGEL in the cutter, turning to look at the approaching Acheron. \nHis P.O.V.: puffs of smoke from its bow-chasers. \nPULLINGS Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what sail you can! \nJACK Stern-chasers to fire when she's in range! \n62.   STERN OF SURPRISE \nGouts of water from the enemy gunfire rise not fifty yards from them, acting as little needed encouragement for the boats to get clear of the stern and pull around towards the bows as.... \n64.   MAINMAST/FOREMAST \nMen scramble up the ratlines, and through the shattered rigging. \n65.   THE GREAT CABIN \nTwo long brass nine-pounders set up through the open windows of the Captain's day cabin, open fire on the approaching Acheron. \nMOWETT Fire! \n65A. MAINMAST \nWARLEY, captain of the maintop, directs his men about the mare's nest of rigging, getting a tattered top-sail to fill with what little breeze there is. \nWARLEY Sharp now with that fancy-line! To the clew line from the reef points, Cully, double up and run her back again! \n66. QUARTERDECK \nThrough PULLINGS' telescope: the enemy ship coming straight at them, her guns now getting the range of the Surprise. \nPULLINGS She's gaining on us. \nJACK Start the water, carronades over the side. \n67.   ANGLE ON THE QUARTERDECK \nCrewmen furiously at work cutting the ropes securing the guns on the quarterdeck. \n68.   ANGLE ON THE STERN \nWater spouts from the pumps, while at the same time the quarterdeck guns tumble into the ocean. (NOTE: they only abandon guns on the quarterdeck, not their main armament on the gun-deck.) \n69. FORECASTLE \nJACK races to the bows. Towlines strain as the three small boats pull the great ship toward the curtain of fog and cloud. He yells to the straining oarsmen - \nJACK Pull! Pull for your lives. \n70.   ANGLE FROM THE BOATS \nThe men heave on their oars, faces bathed in sweat, the towlines taut behind them, dragging the Surprise toward the safety of the fog-bank. \n71. WIDE \nto see the Surprise slipping into the cover of fog and low cloud, only her top masts visible, before they too disappear. \n72. QUARTERDECK \nJACK joins his officers looking back into the white-out, in the direction of the enemy. \nJACK Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr. ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to head due east. \nALLEN hurries toward the bows, as behind them the fog is momentarily illuminated by flashes of gunfire from their pursuer. \n73.   THE LEADING JOLLY BOAT \nCALAMY, in the prow of the jolly-boat, sees ALLEN on the ship, signalling the turn to eastward. \nCALAMY signals to BONDEN in the stern of the jolly-boat. \nBONDEN (urgent whisper) Starboard haul. And stroke! Stroke! \nOne side stops rowing and the boat turns. 74.   THE SURPRISE \nA low angle, the ship coming slowly toward us. \nBeyond, the rowers strain at their oars, the great ship rearing out of the mist above them, as though carried on their backs. \n75.   QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE \nSomewhere astern and to the left JACK can hear shouting on the Acheron. Flashes of cannon fire, directed away from them. \nPULLINGS He's beating inshore. \nALLEN ...Call her a frigate? Ha! You ask me she's no more a frigate than a painted Dutchman. More like a ship of the line, a two-decker more'n a frigate. \nMOWETT is trying to staunch a persistent nosebleed. \nMOWETT One does wonder what manner of hull she has. Our balls seemed to bounce right off her. \nJack enters, his head newly bandaged. He walks past the seated officers and stands looking out through the stern windows. The officers continue their conversation, though their words are intended for Jack \nPULLINGS She had the weather-gauge and long eighteens which could hit us beyond our effective range. That's the sum of it \nALLEN And   40 guns to our 28, I counted the muzzle flashes. \nPULLINGS It was an unfair match, no dishonor in defeat no dishonor at all. \nJack still has his back to them. He puts his hand in his pocket and finds something there - the shattered fragments of his gold pocket watch. \nALLEN (sighs) Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen the foresail is too far gone so we'll bend our spare. \nPULLINGS Sir. \nJack finally turns. \nPULLINGS (CONT'D) Mr. Allen is confident, with basic repairs, we can get home as we are... allowing for a stop in Jamaica. \nALLEN At Port Royal we can haul her into dry- dock, and hopefully get her home without... \nJACK We're not going home. \nAn expectant hush. KILLICK is all ears, as he picks up the coffee cups and places them carefully on a silver tray. \nJACK (CONT'D) What is our purpose here gentlemen? Why were we sent? To punish a blackguard privateer who has decimated our Atlantic whaling fleet and now threatens to do the same in the pacific. Are we to leave those ships to his mercy and slink back into Portsmouth - another defeat to add to the list. Is that what we draw our wages for? I say we pursue her and pay her back with interest \nALLEN With respect, Captain, she could be half- way to Cape Horn by the time we're repaired and underway. \nJACK (sternly) Then there's not a moment to lose. \n83.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN \nKILLICK exits the cabin with the tray of coffee cups. As he passes them to his mate, BLACK BILL - \nKILLICK (a whisper) We're for the Horn. \n84.     THROUGHOUT THE SHIP - DAWN \nWord passes like lightning from the wounded in the orlop, to the beak of the ship \nMUTTERED VOICES AD LIB -   The Horn you say? -   Never! In this condition? -   Eh? What news mates -   Heading for where?! \n85.     FORECASTLE - DAWN \nA few of the old 'Surprises' have gathered for a smoke, all of them men who've sailed with JACK before: Jittery alcoholic Higgins, loyal Nehemiah Slade, sharp-faced tobacco-chewing Faster Doudle, and the big Welshman Awkward Davies, still shaken by the loss of his gun-crew. \nhiggins We're for hell in a hand-barrow if you ask my opinion \nslade I'm game. If the captain says we can take her we can take her. \nDAVIES Can we catch her is the question. And if we do what's different? She'll just hold us off with them long eighteens til she sends us all to the bottom. All for what? \nDOUDLE I'll tell you for what, matey. She's a privateer, loaded with all the gems of Araby. Think of the gold. Think of the prize-money. \nHOLLAR Hoi there! You men jump to it! \n86.     WAIST OF THE SHIP - NOON \nThe gratings are hauled aside and light floods down into the gun-deck. \n87.     GUN-DECK - DAY \nPart of a huge tree-trunk - spare timber for repairs - is manhandled by a dozen crewmen. \nHOLLAR Heave. And heave. Handsomely now. One long pull. Belay! \n88.     QUARTERDECK - DAY \nCrewmen labour at the capstan. \nHOLLAR (O.S.) Two six heave! Two six heave! \nThe huge log rises from below and hangs suspended from its gantry. JACK shouts down from the quarterdeck - \nJACK Have her placed along the gunwale for now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to that side also. \n89.   ABOVE JACK'S HEAD \nMen are hanging in the rigging throwing down damaged sections of rope. \nFASTER DOUDLE All clear below! \nA rippling broadside, the crews sweating over their guns. \nJACK And pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging we want! \nMOWETT timing the gap between each broadside. \nMOWETT Three minutes ten, Sir. \nJACK Not good enough! We must fire three broadsides to her two. Again! \nTurning to BLAKENEY, who though much recovered, still looks pale and a little unsure of himself. \nJACK (CONT'D) Mr. Blakeney? Think you can supervise a gun? BLAKENEY As you will. Sir. \nJACK 'Spitfire', hop to it. \nBLAKENEY takes command of the gun. To one side CALAMY is in charge of 'Beelzebub', on the other side HOLLOM is now directing 'Sudden Death'. \nOnce again the orders are given, and the crews, now competing with each other, go through the sequence: 'Out Tompions', 'Cast loose your guns', 'Cartridge. Ball. Prime. Run out your gun. Prime. Aim. Stand clear... Fire!!' \n121.        AND AGAIN - DUSK \nAs another broadside shakes the deck, STEPHEN hauls his collecting net on board and empties out a glistening array of sea creatures - shrimps, squid and minnows, glinting like opals in the pink light. \nMOWETT (O.S.) Two minutes five, Sir. \nPULLINGS Again! \n122.        AND AGAIN - NIGHT \nIt's a race. JACK's orders are just a formality, the sequence having become so automatic now. \nJACK Out Tompions... Run out your guns... Prime. \nSeconds ticking away on MOWETT's stopwatch, barrels float on the sea a hundred yards out. \nJACK (CONT.) (CONT'D) As she bears, from forward aft. Point your guns... Fire!! \n123.   THE OCEAN AT NIGHT \nThe black ship spouting tongues of flame, the water around the target barrels erupting in great spouts. \nMOWETT (O.S.) Two minutes dead. \n124.   THE GUNPOWDER ROOM \nBoom! Another splendidly coordinated broadside resounds through the ship as the powder-monkeys come racing down through the dreadnought screens to the magazine and back with more cartridge. \nFor them too it's a race, little ADDISON just ahead of SWIFT, RYE hot on his heels. \n125.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT \nThe sound of the guns is faint down here, at least when heard from STEPHEN's perspective - his ears are stuffed with wax. \nHe is surrounded by his specimen bottles, and he looks from his microscope to his ledger where he is documenting the array of aquatic life-forms. He removes his ear-plugs, but the noise of the guns is deafening and he hastily replaces them. \n126.        ON THE GUN-DECK - NIGHT \nMOWETT watches the second hand of his stopwatch, glancing up as he notes - \nThe concentrated fury of the men swabbing, ramming, heaving in, heaving out, firing at a raft this time. \nAnd he stops the watch as the first gun fires. \nMOWETT One minute forty-nine, Sir! \nHis voice is drowned by the firing of the other guns in close succession entirely demolishing the raft, the sound mixing with cheering and the frenzied hammering of Nagel and his mates as the gun-deck partitions are cheerfully re-erected. \n127.        IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT \nThe table is dragged back into place and settings laid for dinner. \nJACK enters, his face flushed with victory. \nJACK Killick? Killick there. KILLICK appears. \nJACK (CONT'D) What do you have for us tonight? \nKILLICK Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face. \nJACK Aah! My favorite. \n128.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nThe sky a great canopy of stars, the ship racing onwards through the warm night. \nCrew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck. Now they sit around in groups, supping their grog. Someone produces a jaw-harp, someone else a drum. \n131. QUARTERDECK \nThe officers have appeared on deck with their coffee and Stephen raises a hand in acknowledgment. \n132.   IN THE RIGGING - NIGHT \nMidshipmen CALAMY RYE and BOYLE are eating from a bag of broken biscuits ('ships nuts') as they sit perched up in the rigging. \nOn seeing JACK, they break into their own song. \nMIDSHIPMEN Our captain was very good to us. He dipped his prick in phosphorus. It shed a light all through the night. And steered us through the Bosphorus. \n133. QUARTERDECK \nJACK pretends not to have heard, but he can't hide his smile. Beside him in a chair sits BLAKENEY, his empty jacket sleeve pinned to his front 'Nelson' style, laughing incredulously at the older boys cheek. \nFrom somewhere on the forecastle, WARLEY and his top-men start singing. \nTOP-MEN Farewell and adieu you fine Spanish ladies Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain... \nThe older midshipman, HOLLOM joins in, his fine voice soaring effortlessly over the others, hijacking their roistering ballad and converting it to something much more poignant. \nHOLLOM For we've received orders to sail for Old England. Perhaps we shall never more see you again His singing is appreciated by STEPHEN on the quarterdeck. \nSTEPHEN What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom does possess. \n134.        IN THE WAIST - NIGHT \nKILLICK and NAGEL are less than impressed with HOLLOM and sing over him, led by ORRAGE the cook. \nORRAGE Come all you thoughtless young men, A warning take by me, And never leave your happy homes to sail the raging sea. \n135.        OCEAN - NIGHT \nThe Surprise sailing away from us, the chorus drifting across the darkness. \n135a.   OCEAN. DAY \nThe colours are changing, from the rich hues of the tropics to the cold muted colours of colder, more southerly climes. \nStill the surprise sails on \n136.        THE GREAT CABIN - DAY \nFingers trace a course down the east coast of South America. Another, more detailed chart is placed on top of the first. \nALLEN This one's by Colnett, Sir. He travelled with Captain Cook and carried a pair of Arnott's chronometers. \nJACK finds their position and marks it with pencil. A knock on the door. Officers and crew are now dressed according to the change in climate \nKILLICK Couple of the men to see you, Sir. \nJACK (without looking up) Show them in. The door opens to reveal NAGEL and WARLEY carrying something. \nJACK (CONT'D) What's this? \nA scale model of a ship, 15 inches long, perfect in every detail. Jack takes it, delighted, the name picked out in gold on the stern - Acheron. \nNAGEL It were Warley's idea, Sir. \nWARLEY I thought she were familiar like, then I remembered where I'd seen her - in Boston, during the Peace. \nJACK [   ] In Boston? \nWARLEY (nods) Yes, Sir. She's Yankee built. I seen them working on her, something right strange about her scantlings. Then I seen them balls bounce off her an' I got to thinking. \nNAGEL If you look here, Sir. One side opens up. \nHe pulls a side off the model, exposing its construction. \nWARLEY Mister Nagel here done it just like I seen her - a third layer 'tween the outer and inner ribbing - diagonal bracing, see? \nJACK Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12 pounders couldn't penetrate except at close range. \nHe passes the model to ALLEN. \nJACK (CONT'D) Killick. Killick, there. \nKILLICK enters. JACK (CONT'D) An extra ration of rum for these men, from my private store. \nKILLICK (shaking his head) Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir. \nJACK Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst we're alive! \nKILLICK goes to get the bottles \nJACK hunkers down to bring his gaze level with the ship, as though studying its tiny occupants. \nJACK Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin to join us, he loves a good chase. \nBLAKENEY goes below. Above, the topmen release more sail which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables. \nThose not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale, like the crew of an ocean racing yacht, to counterbalance the pull of the sails. \n145.        WEATHER-DECK - DAY \nTheir speed is so great green seas are now sweeping the forecastle. A man falls and rolls into the scuppers. \nMOWETT Lifelines fore and aft! \nJACK Speed, Mr. Calamy? \nCALAMY heaves the lead and reads the log line, then shouts back to JACK - \nCALAMY Twelve knots, Sir! \n146.        THE SURPRISE - DAY \nHeeled over under a great press of sail, her copper showing as she clefts the waves. \n147.        FORECASTLE - DAY \nLined up along the starboard rails, the crew look back at their captain riding the ship like a charioteer, one eye aloft on the creaking topmost spar. \nJEMMY DUCKS We're cracking on, eh? \nFASTER DOUDLE We'll be cracking off presently if he doesn't watch it. \nSLADE No, he knows this ship. He knows what she can take. \nHe touches wood, just the same and looks at Joe Plaice who gives a meaningful roll of his eyes. \nAhead, the bank of storm clouds loom gunmetal grey. \n148.        GREAT CABIN - DAY \nPULLINGS knocks and enters, with an anxious looking MR. LAMB, with whom he has been arguing a point. \nPULLINGS We can just see her topsails. She's made her turn westwards. \nLAMB I can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not round Cape Horn. JACK I'll not lose her now. Set a course westwards. \nBoth men accept this and leave. \n149.        QUARTERDECK (TIMELAPSE) - DAY \nThe wind has increased considerably, the deck sloping like the roof of a house, the masts bending like coach-whips. \nPULLINGS and LAMB are looking up at the mizzenmast which is making ominous creaks and groans. \nJACK Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps and light hawsers to the mastheads. \nJACK stares ahead to the darkening sky as they move across a switchback landscape of massive rolling waves. \nJACK (CONT'D) Better get below, Mr. Pullings! \nPULLINGS What, Sir? \nJACK (GRINNING) Better get some food in you. Before it turns nasty. \n150.        OCEAN - DAY \nWide to see the two ships. The Surprise and the Acheron with a mile of sea between them. It's like some great ocean race, with neither prepared to take in canvas despite the appalling conditions. \n151.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY \nThey are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying motion. \nThe forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge, rising each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from her scuppers. \nKILLICK comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket. JACK drinks from the spout, peering ahead into the murk. A wild unruly part of him is loving this. \nAbove him, more top-men struggle up the rigging, with the mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky. \n152.   BELOW DECKS \nThe dog watch are wolfing their food, mugs and dinner plates sliding over the table. Crewmen walk up hill to the grog barrel, down their ration and head up top again. \nHIGGINS You reckon Captain will keep chasing him 'round the Horn with every stitch of canvas flying? \nDAVIES I reckon he'd chase him to the gates of hell if he has to. \nPLAICE And that's where we're all going if he doesn't take in sail. \nSince his injury, Joe Plaice's startlingly random pronouncements have acquired the quality of an oracle. \nKILLICK and BLACK BILL. \nKILLICK He's been at it again. \nBLACK BILL Who's that then? \nKILLICK The Jonah. \nBLACK BILL What Jonah? \n160.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT \nJACK sits at his desk. The model of the Acheron that WARLEY helped make sits accusingly in front of him. \nSTEPHEN pours him a glass on wine, and one for himself. \nSTEPHEN The deaths in actual battle are the easiest. (beat) For my own part - those who die under the knife or from some consequent infection: I have to remind myself that it is the enemy who killed them, and not me. (beat) Warley was a casualty of war, as surely as if a French ball had taken him. \nJACK nods. Obviously the death still weighs on his conscience. [ ] \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) (offering the wine) At the same time.... \nHe breaks off \nJack At the same time, what? \nStephen hesitates, aware that he has to proceed carefully \nSTEPHEN You know that I wear two hats on every voyage. I am the captains particular friend and supporter, but also I am the ships doctor in which later capacity I am party to.... \nHe catches a steely glint in Jacks eye and breaks off. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) \nYou don't want me to continue. \nJACK (stiffly) On the contrary. I insist on it. \nSTEPHEN There is talk below decks of turning back. Or rather that we should have turned back some weeks ago. Of course the men would follow \"Lucky Jack\" anywhere, and usually in the confident expectation of victory. But that of course is the problem. \nJACK What is the problem? \nSTEPHEN That you are not accustomed to defeat Jack. That you have taken it too personally. That chasing this larger, faster ship, with its long guns, is beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth before destruction'? \nJACK It's not pride nor anything like it, it's a question of duty. \nSTEPHEN 'Duty', ah yes. The naval signal for end of discussion. \nJACK You can be as 'satiric' as you like, Stephen, but I have my orders. She is attacking our whalers. For why? Without whales we have no boot polish, nor any soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil our sabres and muskets. Destroying our whalers could win the war for Napoleon. Which is why we must catch this Acheron. As a man of learning surely you can see that. \nSTEPHEN At whatever the cost? \nJACK Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I will calculate that myself, Stephen without reference to your friends in the ward room. \n160A MIZZEN-TOP \nAn icy wind whips at the men working on the temporary mizzen mast. \nHollom, half way up the rigging is relaying instructions between the men in the rigging and the men on deck \nHOLLOM Cast off. \nThe new yard flails around on its pulley, bashing dangerously against the mast. Almost claiming Nagel \nHOLLOM (CONT'D) Belay. Sorry. Sorry. 161    QUARTERDECK \nPULLING craning upwards. The topmen's shouted commands are whipped away by the gale. \nJACK joins him, still smarting from the conversation with Stephen \nJACK We'll have to go further south, get around this bloody west wind. \nPULLINGS How far south? \nJACK As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The sixtieth parallel if need be. \n162.        THE SHIP - DAY \nTacking southwards. The sun, a pale anaemic disc, gradually disappearing behind layers of cloud. \nThe wind is a constant shrill whistle through the rigging, a sound like some infernal drill which rises and falls but never ceases. \nDISSOLVE TO - \n163.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN \nThe sun rising in a clear sky which turns a sapphire blue. White ice-islands lie all around them, some a pure, rosy pink. Others bright ultramarine. \nHOLLOM sees them looking at him. \n170.        THE SCUTTLEBUTT, SHIP'S WAIST - DAY \nA marine sentry, TROLLOPE, stands guard by the ship's water- barrel - the level is very low. STEPHEN ladles some water into a phial. TROLLOPE One glass per man, sir, Captain's orders. \nSTEPHEN straightening, irritated by the challenge. \nSTEPHEN A mere thimbleful, Corporal, for scientific purposes only. \n171.         STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAY \nIn the gloom of his cabin, STEPHEN angles the mirror of his brass microscope toward the window, and places a slide containing a droplet of water under the lens. \n172.         MAINMAST-TOP - DAY \nJACK climbs into the top. He adjusts his telescope, studies the horizon. \n173.   JACK'S TELESCOPE P.O.V. \nHe pans across the empty sea. \n174.   STEPHEN'S MICROSCOPE P.O.V. \nAn assortment of mobile, transparent micro-organisms rotating wildly. \nSTEPHEN (O.S.) My God, Padeen, a veritable zoo. \nPADEEN takes a look, amazed then greatly amused. \n175.         THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT \nCharts are spread all over the table, STEPHEN poring over them when Jack comes in \nSTEPHEN Show me where these Doldrums lie? \nJACK joins him. \nJACK Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of you? The doldrums is a condition, not a region. But you tend to strike 'em here... (pointing) ...between the trades, and the sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is having it as bad as we are. \nSTEPHEN considers their current position on the chart, the tiny Galapagos Islands to the north and the vast emptiness to the west of them. \nSTEPHEN Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos, and not some other point in all this vastness? \nJACK Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted to go there. It is said to be a natural paradise \nSTEPHEN In truth I'd be delighted with the merest guano stained rock provided it didn't sway beneath my feet \nJACK Well, we'll take on food and water once we're there, and as compensation for not having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that during that time, several days at least, you can wander at will, catching bugs and beetles to your heart's delight. You will be the first naturalist to set foot on the islands. That is my solemn promise \nSTEPHEN I accept, provided the men have not mutinied and thrown us all overboard before we get there. \nJACK Mutiny? No. They are already counting their share of the prize money. \nSTEPHEN Another week of this and they shall gladly give it up for a glass of clean water. \nJACK Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your bellyacheing. We shall have rain presently, and if not we shall damned well tow ourselves out of this. \n176.        JOLLY BOAT - DAY \nDisgruntled, under-slept men, in boats towing the ship. \nNAGEL and DAVIES look back darkly at HOLLOM who sits in the stern. \nHOLLOM Stroke. Stroke... \nDAVIES (whispers) I heard he were on the Fair Marion as foundered off Tresco. And he were on the Zephyrus what exploded at Trafalgar. \nHOLLOM has heard this, as DAVIES intended, but he looks away choosing to ignore them. \n177.        FIGHTING TOP - DAY \nA view from above of men towing the ship. Over this an unpleasant scraping sound - chalk on slate. \nBONDEN M-a-s-t... mast \nSTEPHEN is writing words on a slate then offering them to BONDEN whom he is teaching to read. \nBONDEN (CONT'D) S-u-n... sun \nSTEPHEN nods and scratches another word on the board. As BONDEN struggles to decipher it there's the sound of a musket shot and a seabird falls out of the sky. \nHOWARD, the captain of marines, reloads his smoking musket laughing aloud. \nSTEPHEN Is that man completely mad? (shouts down) Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating! \nHOWARD looks up towards them, a broad smile on his red moon of a face. \nHOLLOM (smiling weakly) Twenty-five next Friday. \nJACK You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice. You can't spend the rest of your life as a midshipman. \nHOLLOM I'll try harder, Sir. \nKILLICK helps JACK on with his full-dress uniform. \nJACK Well, it's an unfortunate business, Hollom. Damned unfortunate. \nKILLICK seems to endorse this by placing the captain's hat emphatically on JACK's head. \nJack turns and strides out of the cabin, HOLLOM following slowly after him. \n182.        QUARTERDECK, DOLDRUMS - DAY \nThe entire crew has been mustered. The uniformed officers line the quarterdeck as JACK reads from the Articles of War. \nJACK 'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not capital, committed by any person or persons in the fleet... shall be punished according to the laws, and customs, of the sea.' (then, to NAGEL) Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man and yet you failed to salute an officer. You knew what you were doing. Have you anything to say in your defence? \nNAGEL looks at the deck. \nNAGEL No, Sir. \nJACK Have his officers anything to say for him? \nDAVIES and KILLICK scowl across the deck at HOLLOM, who looks wretched but says nothing. \nJACK (CONT'D) Seize him up. \nNAGEL is spread-eagled to the grating, his hands tied. \nHOLLAR Seized up, Sir. \nJACK One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty. \nThe mate takes the leather cat-o-nine tails out of its red bag. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP ON - \n183.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK \nJACK stands alone, tuning his fiddle. No matter how much he turns the peg the top string always sounds flat. He tunes some more and breaks it. \nJACK Red hell... \n184.        QUARTERDECK - DUSK \nJACK (O.S.) ...and bloody death! \nEvery word is plainly audible to the men on watch, who pretend to hear nothing. \n185.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK \nJACK is fitting a new string. Widen to reveal STEPHEN sitting opposite with his cello. \nSTEPHEN I was merely remarking that you have always prided yourself on not being a flogging captain and this... JACK I am not a \"flogging captain\". I have not once rigged the grating on this voyage, not once in twelve thousand miles. Besides, I wager you will find a deal more brutality on land. \nTightening the new string. The note escalating as he turns. \nSTEPHEN I'm not a party to it on land. \nJACK Well you are party to it on my ship. Men must be governed. Often not wisely I grant you, but there are hierarchies even in nature, as you've often said yourself. \nSTEPHEN Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte. \nJACK (trying to call a halt) Yes. Fine words I'm sure \nSTEPHEN (continues regardless) ...We are not animals and I for one am opposed to authority, that egg of misery and oppression.. \nJACK Very fine words Stephen, but In these current circumstances, hard-work and firm discipline is what keeps our little wooden world together. \nSTEPHEN And grog I suppose. \nJACK Of course. What of it? Of course they have their grog! \nSTEPHEN (sits) (CONT'D) You know Nagel was drunk when he insulted Hollom. And Higgins is never sober. Even the midshipmen... \nJACK The men will have their grog Stephen. It is part of the immemorial tradition of the service \nSTEPHEN Well a shameful tradition it is too. To have them pressed from their homes, kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation. \nJACK Stephen... \nSTEPHEN ...confined for months in a wooden prison, Never more than a few hours sleep and flogged when drunken idleness drives them to.... \nJACK (untypically cutting) The enemy cannot come on us without a wind, Mr. Mowett. \nHe looks about at the terrified faces of the crew. The wailing sound now rises to a shriek, as STEPHEN joins the group. \nJACK (CONT'D) What do you make of it, Doctor? \nSTEPHEN I'm sure I've never heard the like. \nThe crew overhear this and pass it among themselves as another anguished howl fills the night. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) Perhaps it's the mother of the creature Mr. Howard shot. \nJACK [    ] Creature? \nSTEPHEN [ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly. Though I have never known one with a cry like this. \nA glance along at HOWARD on the gangway, as terrified as anyone. \nJACK Bosun. Fire off some flares. \n195.        WIDE ON THE SHIP - NIGHT \nThree flares soar and burst with a ghostly glow, making a pool of blue light around the ship, the sound continuing to echo and re-echo from somewhere beyond. \n196.        QUARTERDECK - NIGHT \nThe light illuminates the half-hour glass, its top-half empty of sand. Like everyone else, the duty sergeant stands frozen to the spot. Jack rounds on him. \nJACK Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking of? Turn the glass and strike the bell. \nRoused, the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes its flow. \nTwo bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear. And when the sound comes once more they all freeze. \nJACK joins MOWETT at the taffrail. The thing is somewhere out there, whatever it is. \nMOWETT Perhaps some poor shipwreck? \nHe shouts, a slight nervous catch to his voice. \nMOWETT (CONT'D) Ahoy! Is anyone there? \nPart of him knows it's crazy and of course there's no reply. The sound constantly shifting position, now in the water, now in the sky. \nJACK turns to see a white face, frighteningly close to his own. It's PADEEN, mouth agape, face unnaturally white, staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror lies out there. JACK Padeen. What are you doing on the quarterdeck? \nHe looks down at the press of men who have gathered at the bottom of the ladder, some with weapons. \nJACK (CONT'D) Below! All of you men below! (to MOWETT) Tell the bosun those off-duty may sleep with their lamps on. \n197.        LOWER DECK - NIGHT \nSeveral crewmen huddle close together their faces lit by a battle-lantern. Joe Plaice grim. Doudle wide-eyed. Higgins with his alcoholic tremor more pronounced than ever. \nBLACK BILL Duppies make that noise. \nKILLICK (indicating BILL) See. They know all about this in Africa. \nDOUDLE What's a duppie? \nBLACK BILL That Warley. Swallow by a fish. Spirit can't get out. Him duppie now. \nSLADE Captain don't even know what that noise be. \nGeneral nods of agreement. \nDOUDLE Doctor neither, and he knows everything. \nKILLICK Joe here's got the most experience in these matters, and new brains to boot, let's hear it from Joe. \nAll eyes on JOE PLAICE. He speaks from the shadows. \nPLAICE It's the Jonah causing it. That howling thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship. He's calling it up, don't you see? Every time he's on watch the ship appears. You wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear any time tonight, and take us all straight to the hot-place. \nAnother shriek, closer now, seems to confirm JOE's bizarre theory. \n198.        MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH - NIGHT \nThe boys sit together. None of them look at HOLLOM, who sits pale and wretched in a corner of the room, clutching his stomach. \n199.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT \nAs the howling continues, STEPHEN looks through a number of books on sea-creatures searching for a reference to what they're experiencing. \nAs JACK looks over his shoulder, his eye is caught by a picture in one of STEPHEN's books. \nHe picks it up. \n230.        INTERIOR STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAWN \nEarly morning light on the interior of the cabin. PADEEN is asleep, holding a Bible, in the doctor's chair. \nSTEPHEN himself lies motionless with his eyes closed and his mouth open, no colour in his face. \nThe sea is relatively calm. From outside the sound of the bosun's orders, over rattling blocks and pulleys. HOLLAR (O.S.) ...Clap on now! Every rope an end... Jolly-boat away... Slowly, Jenks! You grass-combing lubber! \nMOWETT comes in, sees STEPHEN, and takes him for dead. \nMOWETT (shouts outside) Davies! Slade! \nTwo big men come in behind him. PADEEN wakes, confused and pushes them away, moving protectively to the doctor's side. \nThe commotion disturbs STEPHEN. His eyes open. Like a dead man just come back to life. \nMOWETT (CONT'D) Doctor. You're still with us. Can we move you onto a stretcher? \nSTEPHEN swallows uncomfortably and tries to make sense of things. \n231.        A GALAPAGOS ISLAND - DAY \nA giant iguana watches as a small procession trudges up the stony beach. \nAt its head, STEPHEN is carried in a litter up to where a tent has been set up above the high-water mark. \nHis P.O.V. as JACK appears in the blue sky above him. \nSTEPHEN Tell me this wasn't on my account? \nJACK (dead pan) No. It was because of Higgins. (beat) Can't have him poking around in your belly without a solid platform to work on. \nHe ducks as they enter - \n232.        THE HOSPITAL TENT - DAY \nIn the creamy light, they lay STEPHEN down on a recently- constructed wooden operating table. \nHIGGINS squats on the ground, rummaging through various large sharp surgical instruments which he has emptied onto a piece of Hessian. \nJACK All set, Higgins? \nSTEPHEN grabs JACK's sleeve. \nSTEPHEN Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand. \nJack frowns, unsure what he means by this. \nEXT. THE TENT - NIGHT \nPADEEN stands, arms crossed at the closed tent-flap, keeping at bay a crowd of well-wishers, and the merely curious. \nINT. THE TENT - NIGHT \nSTEPHEN sits pale and sweaty, propped up on a series of chests, his back against a coil of rope. In front of him, suspended by pulleys, LAMB and NAGEL have set up a large gilt-framed mirror. \nBeside him, on a white tablecloth, some small scissors and scalpels. \nSTEPHEN (To Jack) [ ] You are sure you have a head and a stomach for this kind of thing? \nJACK (smiles) My dear Doctor, I have seen blood and wounds since I was a little boy. \nSTEPHEN Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when I give the word. \nSTEPHEN begins first with the knife, then the probe - the grind of metal on living bone. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) You will have to raise the rib, Higgins. Take a good grip with the square retractor. Up. Harder, harder. (to himself) Snip the cartilage. \nThe metallic clash of instruments, perpetual swabbing. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) Now, Jack, a steady downward pressure. Good. Keep it so. Give me the davier. Swab, Higgins. Press, Jack, press. \nJACK closes his eyes. STEPHEN draws in his breath, arches his back, and it's done. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) There she is. \nHe pulls out the bullet, and with it, a fragment of his shirt. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) Is that all of it? \nThe bloody piece of shirt is handed to HIGGINS who matches it to the hole in STEPHEN's old shirt. \nHIGGINS Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir. \nSTEPHEN Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain, while I swab. \nHIGGINS helps JACK into a chair, pressing his head down between his knees. After a moment, and a few deep breaths, JACK looks up. STEPHEN smiles at him. A hint of surly triumph. \n240.        LAVA BEDS - DAY \nSTEPHEN with his telescope taking notes on bird-life. \n241.        LOW SCRUB - DAY \nThe huge, strangely balletic figure of PADEEN chasing after a butterfly in evening light. \n242.        A HEADLAND - DAY \nWide to see another aspect of the countryside - a hint of distant sea, a rocky headland rising from the plain. \nThe group is widely scattered. STEPHEN at the base of the headland, BLAKENEY half a mile further inland. PADEEN coming up slowly behind, laden with the fruits of their expedition. \n243.        BASE OF THE HEADLAND - DAY \nSTEPHEN rests a moment. Some stones rattle down from the hillside. He looks up to see a flash of black feathers near the crest - the cormorant. \nOn his shirt a red smudge has appeared. His wound has begun to bleed again. \nIgnoring this, Stephen pushes on after his quarry. \n244.   THE ROCKY SLOPE \nNear the top, STEPHEN pauses to catch his breath and glances above him. \nAgain the bird, moving higher, as if leading him on. \nSTEPHEN gets down on all fours, crawling cautiously to the crest just above him. 245.   TOP OF THE HEADLAND \nA clearing. There is movement in the bushes. \nSTEPHEN slowly rises, climbs the few paces to the hilltop and enters a clearing. \nHe searches amongst the bushes. Nothing. \nHe turns and looks back down the hillside to see BLAKENEY and PADEEN far below, then sits to get his breath back again. \nSTEPHEN'S P.O.V: on the ground between his feet, a beetle. He picks it up. \nClose, on his hand. It is the same type of beetle BLAKENEY gave him aboard the Surprise. \nSmiling at the coincidence STEPHEN raises the tiny creature to eye level. \nHis P.O.V.: the beetle, the creature in sharp focus, behind it the sea, and on the sea, a black shape. \nThe focus shifts to the background - a ship at anchor in a bay. \nThe beetle flies away as STEPHEN stares out at the ship. It's the Acheron, and they are weighing anchor. \n246.         COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK \nBLAKENEY urging STEPHEN to hurry as they make their way through the darkening landscape. All kinds of creatures are appearing around them, and every few yards STEPHEN pauses to examine something. \nBLAKENEY Sir, you must hurry! \nSTEPHEN A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any ship's captain. \nHe's breathing hard, exhausted. \nBLAKENEY You must carry him, Padeen! \nPADEEN looks at the collection of baskets he carries. BLAKENEY (CONT'D) Leave them! We must get back to the ship. \nSTEPHEN raises his hand in protest, but BLAKENEY is already divesting PADEEN of his load. \n247.        COUNTRYSIDE - LAST LIGHT \nPADEEN carrying STEPHEN 'piggy-back', BLAKENEY out ahead urging them on. \n247a   THE DISCARDED COLLECTING BOXES \nA variety of small bugs and animals crawling free \n248      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT \nSTEPHEN gingerly lowers himself into his 'elbow-chair', gripping the table and BLAKENEY's good arm for support. Sighing, he begins emptying his pockets of various small items collected during the day - some leaves, rocks and insects - and places them in ordered piles around his microscope. \nAll about them can be heard the urgent sounds of departure - the anchor rattling up, shouted orders and the drumming of bare feet on the deck above. \nHe holds up a stick in a specimen-jar, and is examining it with his magnifying glass when JACK enters. \nJACK I forgot to ask you - did you see your bird? \nSTEPHEN's eye grossly enlarged through the lens. \nSTEPHEN I did not. My greatest discovery was your phantom. \nA bemused STEPHEN looks about him as he approaches JACK. \nSTEPHEN I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's clothing \nJACK A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave me the idea. \nSTEPHEN I'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator. \nJACK No? Well this one is. \n253.        BERTH DECK - DAWN HOWARD and his marines change out of their smart uniforms, into the oldest most ragged clothes on board the ship, much to the amusement of the passing sailors. \nCREW MEN AD LIB Very fancy. Blue to match your eyes. Is there a skirt comes with it? \n254.        GUN-DECK - DAWN \nMen are checking the breechings of the great guns and chipping cannonballs to make them more perfectly spherical, more deadly. \nThe armourer is at his grindstone sending out showers of sparks, a group of seamen round him relaying one another at the crank, stacking newly honed cutlasses and boarding axes at their feet. \nAnother team check and load pistols by the score. \n254.        MIDSHIPMEN'S QUARTERS - DAWN \nAlone, BLAKENEY awkwardly draws his dirk, left-handed from its scabbard. It glints momentarily in the lamp-light. \nCALAMY enters, face aglow, abruptly trying to cover his joy when he sees BLAKENEY. \nBLAKENEY [ ] It's all right. Permission to boast. You're to lead the boarders from the forecastle. Congratulations. \nCALAMY Thank you. \nBLAKENEY You'll make lieutenant out of this. \nThe others come in. \nBOYLE He already has. 'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant Peter Calamy. \nOohs and aahs from all. \nBLAKENEY Then I'll see you at the forecastle, 'Lieutenant'. \nCALAMY That's not your station. \nBLAKENEY looks from CALAMY to the others, who avoid his eye. \nBLAKENEY But naturally I'll board with you? \nCALAMY I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders. \nBLAKENEY is devastated. \nRye bursts in, in a state of high excitement. \nRYE She's seen us! \n256.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN \nJACK raises his glass, focuses on the Acheron, plainly visible in the distance, with a line of signal flags running up her backstay. \nMOWETT She's asking us to heave to. Shall I give the order? \nJACK No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but panicky and disorganized, like a whaler might do. \nAllen smiles at this unintended slight \nJACK (CONT'D) No offence, Mr. Hogg. \n257.        WIDE ON THE SHIPS - DAY \nA show of chaos on deck as the Surprise veers upwind, away from the Acheron. As she presents her stern we see her new name: Malacca. \n258.        QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - DAY \nThrough his telescope, JACK looks back at the Acheron in pursuit, a dark figure on her foredeck. JACK (to Mowett) Run up Portuguese colours. (then down to the gun-deck) Load, Mr. Pullings. Triple shot 'em. \nBLAKENEY comes onto the quarterdeck and salutes, looking flushed and angry. \nBLAKENEY May I speak with you, Sir. \nJACK No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers here. \nBLAKENEY Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding party, I wanted to say - \nJACK (interrupts) I know what you want to say and my answer is no. I promised your mother I would return you in one piece and I have already failed her on that score. You will command a gun and then retire to defend the quarterdeck here with Dr. Maturin. \nBLAKENEY But sir - \n....and spins the wheel hard to starboard. \n266.   THE SURPRISE \nWide, to see her swinging broadside on, across the path of the oncoming Acheron. \n267.   POV ACHERON DAY \nConfused shouts from the enemy's deck, chaos on her forecastle, somewhere a drum beating. \n268 + 269.    DELETED \n270.   THE SURPRISE QUARTERDECK - DAY \nJACK hands the wheel to BONDEN. \nJACK Run us down her larboard side then cut across her wake! (shouts down to the gun deck) Hold fire Mr Pullings! Hold till we're broadside on! \n271. - THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON \nWide, to see the Surprise turning downwind, back towards the Acheron, so they will pass broadside to broadside [   ] no more than thirty yards apart. \n272. QUARTERDECK/ GUN-DECK, SURPRISE \nThrough a furious exchange of musket fire JACK runs down the ladder to the gun-deck- \nJACK Fire as she bears! Every gun to concentrate on her mainmast! \nThrough the gunports the Acheron's great hull becomes visible. Some of the Acheron's guns have run out, but the crews are unprepared and disorganized. PULLINGS On the uproll! Fire for the mainmast as you sight her! \nAs the Surprise rolls and the upper deck of the Acheron becomes visible. \n273. THE SURPRISE GUNS \nBarking, leaping back one by one, great tongues of flame spitting from their barrels, dense clouds of smoke rising. \n274.    VIEW OF THE ACHERON \nWith an almighty splitting sound their mainmast falls, dragging yards and rigging with it, the whole mass falling over their side, obscuring many of their gun-ports. \n275. GUNDECK/QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - \nCheers from the crew. Jack yelling up the companionway \nJACK Now Mr Bonden! Hard a'starboard! \n276.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON \nThe Acheron wallows, bought to a standstill by the enormous dragging weight of their mainmast. \nBONDEN wheels the ship across the enemy's wake, past the exposed, vulnerable stern. \n277.    DELETED \n277A.   GUNDECK, SURPRISE \nJACK Fire at will! \n278.    GUN-DECK, SURPRISE \nIn random sequence the Surprise's gunners pound it into the Acheron's stern. Casement windows vanish in a cloud of wood and glass, exposing the Acheron's terrified gun-crews, now open to devastating fire as the Surprise glides past. \n279.    QUARTERDECK \nJACK climbs up on the gunwales, shouting to BONDEN - JACK Lay me alongside! \n280.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON \nThe bow of the Surprise lurches into the Acheron mid-ships, spars interlocking, the Surprise guns firing into her at point-blank range. \nThe crew throw grappling hooks. \n281..   QUARTERDECK \nJACK Boarders away! \nAnd he leaps to the enemy deck, a great tide of men following after him. \n282.    FORECASTLE \nCALAMY leads his own children's crusade from the bows and forecastle: youthful but terrifying, screaming and swinging their blades. \n283.    QUARTERDECK \nAn agonized BLAKENEY watches from where he stands beside STEPHEN. JOE PLAICE is close by with some of the older men, ready to ferry the wounded below. \n284.    ON THE ACHERON \nThey have been looting their own ship's valuables, two of them are too drunk to be scared. \nJACK Where is your captain? Ou est votre capitaine? \nOne man leaps out through the shattered windows. A couple of others raise their hands and start jabbering in French and Spanish. \n298.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON \nIt's all over for the Acherons as a French officer hauls down their colours. \nA cheer from the Surprises - a few last shots fired. CALAMY and BLAKENEY cheering, BLAKENEY holding aloft the captured flag. \nA dying Frenchman suddenly lunges at CALAMY with a sabre. BLAKENEY steps in front of him and takes the blow. \n299.   IN THE SICK-BERTH, ACHERON \nA doctor is working here, a callow-faced man in a bloody apron, red-eyed from fatigue. \nJACK enters, a fearsome sight, with his singed yellow hair and blood-stained cutlass. \nJACK Le Capitaine? Where is he? \nThe doctor points at a body on the operating table. \nJACK approaches, looks down at the dead man. He's [ ] somewhere about JACK's age, fine-featured, with his black coat draped over his body. DOCTOR Il m\u00e1vait prie de vous donner ceci. \nPassing JACK the captain's sword. \n300.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON \nJACK picks his way through the dead and wounded to where CALAMY sits nursing BLAKENEY. \nCALAMY He's dead, sir. \nGently, JACK picks up the lifeless body and walks slowly back down the quarterdeck, the boy draped across his arms. \nFriend and foe part silently in front of him as he crosses the gangway to... \n301.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE \n...then with CALAMY following, he goes below. \n302.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY \nJACK in wide shot, sitting alone on the bench running under the stern windows. His hunched posture and red tear-stained eyes give a glimpse of his familiar post-battle mood - a mix of grief and depression, the old question, \"Was it worth the price?\". \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP ON - \n303.         ACHERON AND SURPRISE - DAWN \nThe two ships anchored close together on the ocean. \n304.         QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAWN \nAs eight bells are rung for the change of watch we see a row of canvas hammocks each containing the body of a fallen crewman. \nDAVIES and PLAICE stitch the bodies into their hammocks, BLAKENEY the last body in the line. As the men approach - \nCALAMY I'll do it. JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him alone. \nAs CALAMY sews up the hammock, HOLLAR's voice is heard distinctly from below. \nHOLLAR (O.S.) Rise and shine, show a leg there. Tumble up! Tumble up! \nIn close-up: the peaceful face of BLAKENEY \nHOLLAR (O.S.) (CONT'D) Sleepers awake! \n...as CALAMY's hands stitch the canvas closed. \n305.        WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - DAWN \nThe small figures of the crew assembled on the quarterdeck. JACK's voice drifting across the water. \nJACK John Henry ALLEN... Joseph NAGEL... William Horner... Stephen Winston Boyle... and Lieutenant William Blakeney \nWe therefore commit their bodies to the deep, looking for the resurrection of the body, when the sea shall give up her dead... Amen. \nALL Amen. \nThe bodies in their weighted hammocks slide into the sea. \n306.        BOW OF THE SURPRISE - DAY \nWide on STEPHEN and BLAKENEY as they sit watching two dolphins surfing the bow-wave, STEPHEN pointing out various features of these magnificent creatures, doing his best to take the boy's mind off the loss of his friend. \n", "test1_input": "101.        THE COCKPIT - NIGHT \nBLAKENEY is lowered onto the table, delirious. CALAMY holds his head and PADEEN, MATURIN's giant manservant, his legs, which are lashed together. \nBLAKENEY No. Mamma. Mamma. \nSTEPHEN It is the laudanum speaking. You will be a regular Nelson. \nHe tests the edge of his knife with his thumb. \nCALAMY places the leather gag between BLAKENEY's teeth. Padeen mumbles a Gaelic prayer. STEPHEN turns and grips BLAKENEY shattered arm. \nA sharp, grating noise as STEPHEN works out of shot, cutting off the arm. \nClose on STEPHEN, lips compressed, utterly focussed. \nHe puts down the bloody knife and reaches for the spatula in the pail of hot tar. \nBLAKENEY has not uttered a sound, though he is shaking uncontrollably and his face is wet with tears. CALAMY has tears in his eyes also. \nSTEPHEN finishes his work, breathing hard, a gentle smile to BLAKENEY. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) There. I have never seen a braver patient. \n102.        SICK-BERTH - NIGHT \nAn exhausted CALAMY keeps vigil by BLAKENEY's cot. The boy wakes, and looks for CALAMY in the darkness. \nBLAKENEY Peter? Is that you? I dreamed they cut my arm off. \nThen he realizes, with sudden horror, that it wasn't a dream \nCALAMY You would have died else. \nBlakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away \nCALAMY (CONT'D) Come. You can still sup your grog with your left. And I shall take your turn at marbles. \n103.        MIZZEN TOPGALLANT - DAY \nMOWETT stands in the cross-trees, making a final check on the lashings round the new mizzen top. Below him the great work is nearing completion, men swarming like ants over every part of the hull. \nMOWETT climbs down past FASTER DOUDLE who has one leg looped through the shrouds and is splicing a rope with both hands and his teeth. \nFarther down, a patched sail is being furled up tight in its gaskets. \nBeyond that, at the base of the main-mast a fascinated group of men have gathered to watch the Doctor trepanning JOE PLAICE. \n104.        BASE OF THE MAINMAST - DAY \nSTEPHEN's drill carves out a neat disc of bone to reveal a purplish mass which he starts spooning from the cavity. \nA small crowd of crewmen pause in their work, watching the doctor with morbid fascination as he drops the purple stuff in a dish. \nSLADE (shouts) Is them his brains, Doctor? \nSTEPHEN No, that is just blood. These are his brains. \nExposing them to view. Several of the crew move in for a closer look. The armourer hands STEPHEN a flattened coin, which he begins to screw in place over the cavity as the old hands whisper his praises to the men who have never seen Stephen at work. \nSLADE Physician he is, not one of your common surgeons. \nFASTER DOUDLE Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and the strong fives, wouldn't look at you for under ten guineas on land. \nDAVIES [   ] Knows his birds and beasts too boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell you what it's thinking. 105.           THE SURPRISE - DAY \nA wind causes the ship to turn on its moorings, stirring impatiently, like a racehorse ready to be off as... \n106.           QUARTERDECK - DAY \n...JACK jumps down from the mizzen ratlines. \nJACK Let us be off, Mr. Allen! \nALLEN Weigh anchor! All hands to make sail. Mr Hollom! \n107. ON DECK \nBarefoot men are suddenly running to their stations, racing above and below, running out along the bowsprit, up the ratlines, along the yards. \nA small group, supposed to be assisting Hollom, are contrasting slow off the mark \nHOLLOM Bear a hand there you fellows! \nThe men he is addressing, shoot him a look of distaste which unsettles Hollom slightly, then they assist him pulling on a rope \n108.       QUARTERDECK - DAY \n", "test1_true": "109.           WAIST OF THE SHIP - DAY \nMen strain on the capstan bars. \n110.           BOWS - DAY \nThe anchor bursting up out of the sea. \n111.           MASTS OF THE SURPRISE - DAY \nThe shrouds darken with climbing figures, framed against the sun. HOLLAR (O.S.) Trice up. Lay out. Sheet home! Hoist away! \n112.        QUARTERDECK - DAY \nHOLLAR staring up as the sails unfurl and fill with wind. \nHOLLAR Cheerly there in the foretop, our William! T'garnsl sheets! Hands to the braces! \nMen slide down ropes from high amongst the shrouds, then swing out and drop down to the deck like monkeys, pulling ropes and sails tight with the weight of their bodies. \n113.        WIDE SHOT - DAY \nThe ship spreading its wings. A sudden cracking of canvas as she turns and runs directly downwind. \n114.        QUARTERDECK - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe sun has sunk lower. BONDEN, solid as the rock of Gibraltar is back at the helm, the wind stronger and directly behind. \nJACK Speed, Mr. Boyle \nBOYLE heaves the log clear of the ship's side. The log line races out on its reel. BOYLE checks the run, pulls the pin. \nBOYLE Ten and a half knots, Sir. \nJACK makes no comment but the news seems to please him. \n115.        CLOSE TO THE WATER - DUSK \nThe great hull powers past us. \n116.   DELETED \n117.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT \nKILLICK prepares toasted cheese in his small serving-area. From inside the cabin, the sound of a violin and a cello tuning up. KILLICK glances irritably at the door and elbows his mate, BLACK BILL. \nKILLICK Here we go again: scrape, scrape, screech, screech and never a tune you could dance to, not if you were drunk as Davey's sow. \n118.    INSIDE THE GREAT CABIN \nJACK and STEPHEN are both keen amateur musicians - JACK, violin, STEPHEN cello. \nAs Stephen completes his tuning, Jack experiments with a refrain. \nSTEPHEN Is that one I know, or are we breaking new ground? \nJACK I am trying to remember that air they played all those years ago at the Governors house in Port Mahon. You remember When we first met. Corelli if I'm not mistaken. \nHe plays another riff \nSTEPHEN If that is your \"A\" you are very much so. This is A. \nJack corrects his A string, plays another few bars \nJACK Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pom \nSTEPHEN All I remember is you being unable to sit in your seat the entire performance. \nJACK Aye and you practising apon that poor bishop with your \"puddings athwart the starboard Gumbrils\" or some such arrant nonsense. \nSTEPHEN (laughs) No. That was off Toulon, during the blockade. At our first meeting they played this: \nHe plays a short refrain \nJACK No. No. Entirely off the mark.   pom-pom- POM I have now \nHe plays another variation \nSTEPHEN (enjoying the game) Or was it something like this.... \nCello answers violin, as they hand it back and forth, improvising freely now with an infinity of variations, sometimes playing together, sometimes separately, suddenly hitting it, the music soaring and continuing over \n119.        A HIGH POINT OF VIEW, TIME LAPSE - DAY \nThe tiny ship on the vastness of the ocean. From its side, cotton-wool puffs of smoke. \n120.        GUN-DECK - SAME TIME \n", "test1_id": 471, "test2_input": "LOOKOUT (O.S.) Land-ho! \n207.        GANGWAY - DAY \nBLAKENEY runs along the gangway, past STEPHEN, en route to the quarterdeck. \nBLAKENEY Give you joy, sir! We have raised the Galapagos! \n208.     MONTAGE oF TELESCOPE VIEWS, GALAPAGOS - DAY \nThere's a primeval quality to the landscape, a feeling of a world just born. The wild creatures that inhabit the lava flows and coral beaches confirm this - the giant tortoises, iguanas, sea-lions and penguins, a teeming profusion of exotic animals and plants. 209.        QUARTERDECK/FORECASTLE/TOPS - DAY \nThe ship fairly bristles with telescopes. \n210.   FORECASTLE \nA small group of familiar faces share a pocket telescope. \nHIGGINS (looking) Can't see any wimmun. Just lots of ducks and lizards. \nDOUDLE takes the telescope. \nDOUDLE Wot? There must be wimmun. T'ain't natural. \n211.   QUARTERDECK \nSTEPHEN and BLAKENEY side by side. From both their faces we sense their wonder at seeing these remarkable creatures for the first time. \nSTEPHEN How extraordinary. \nBLAKENEY What, sir? \nSTEPHEN Those birds! \nHe's looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds waddling about on a rock, flapping short, stumpy wings. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) A species of cormorant. But apparently flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe that is unknown to science. \nBLAKENEY dwells briefly on the strange rock-climbing birds then drifts back to the iguanas. \nBLAKENEY The dragons don't seem to bother 'em. \nSTEPHEN They are a type of iguana I should think, and therefore vegetarian. His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is wholly absorbed in the iguanas. \nBLAKENEY Will you catch one? \nSTEPHEN Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some eggs. \nBLAKENEY I mean the great lizards. \nSTEPHEN Oh! \nRecognizing how superficially dull the birds are to BLAKENEY's untutored eye, by contrast with giant lizards. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) I should think a pair of them. Then you can present one of their offspring to the king. \nBONDEN Ha! There's one going for a swim. \nSTEPHEN No. Iguanas are land animals. \nBONDEN Not these ones. \nThe prehistoric-looking creatures, as if suddenly awakened, begin diving into the water. \nSTEPHEN (O.S.) By Jove Bonden you are right! Two new species in as many minutes. \nHe breaks off, suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between the lookout and the quarterdeck. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) What is all that confounded bellowing? \nJACK All hands about ship! \nBLAKENEY dashes off and STEPHEN is elbowed out of the way by hands rushing to get at the sails. \nNEHEMIAH SLADE By your leave sir, by your leave. \nHOLLAR (distant) Helms a'lee - off tacks and sheets - mainsail haul! \nAs the ship turns a distant whaleboat appears with six men aboard, pulling out from one of the neighboring islands. \n212.        IN THE LEE OF THE SHIP'S HULL (TIME-LAPSE) - DAY \nThe whaleboat has come alongside. \nMen swarm down the boarding nets and the whalers are helped aboard, hoarse and exhausted from rowing and shouting. \nHOGG God bless you. Thank you, shipmates. \n", "test2_true": "HOGG, the senior whaler, sits with his mates, relating his story to JACK and the officers. \nHOGG We was coming back for fresh lines, hid in that inlet, yonder. Black-three master. Bit beamy and raised in the stern. \nMeaningful looks among Jack and his men. Its definitely the Acheron he's describing [   ] \nHogg meanwhile takes a pint mug of water, gulps it down, and passes it back to BLAKENEY for a refill. \nHOGG (CONT'D) Hundred thousand pound of good whale oil they stole. Then the bastards... \nALLEN (cuffs him) No swearing on the quarterdeck. \nJACK (waves ALLEN away) Go on. HOGG ...Then they burnt our bloody ship and headed off, bunch of fugging pirates. \nLooking pointedly at Allen \nJACK And her course? \nHOGG Maybe a point south of west. Following the rest of the whaling fleet. \nJACK (rising) Mr. Mowett, these men to be entered on the ship's books. Mr. Allen, lay a course west sou'west. \nAs ALLEN hurries away shouting orders - \nPULLINGS Should we not take on fresh supplies, Sir? Those tortoises... \nJACK (overlapping, impatient) There's not a moment to lose, Mr. Pullings. \nHe leaves the quarterdeck and goes below, STEPHEN following. \n214.   IN THE GREAT CABIN \nJACK has taken his jacket off and is already unfurling his charts. STEPHEN hurries in. \nSTEPHEN Have you forgotten your promise? \nJACK (not looking up) Subject to the requirements of the service, Stephen. I could not in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguano or a... giant peccary - interesting no doubt, but of no immediate application. \nSTEPHEN (overlap) How can you dismiss, out of hand, the bounty of nature? Knowledge that... that will help to progress... \nJACK (overlap) I can see nothing on shore that will progress our mission. \nSTEPHEN (overlap) But how can we possibly know what lies [ ] on these islands, perhaps some knowledge that may save life, that... \nJACK (overlap) I will tell you how to save lives Stephen. Inform me how to guide this ship, undetected, under the nose of a 40 gun frigate. That is the job in hand sir. \nSTEPHEN swallows his indignation and tries for a compromise. \nSTEPHEN Well perhaps there's an opportunity to serve both our objectives. As I understand it you mean to go round the end of this long island, then start your voyage. I could walk across it, be on the other side long before... \nJACK shakes his head. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) I would walk briskly, pausing only for important measurements and almost certainly making valuable discoveries... \nJACK (interrupts) If wind and tide had been against us I should have said yes. They are not and I am obliged to say no. (with finality) No. \nSTEPHEN is livid. Betrayed. \nSTEPHEN I see. So after all this time in your service I must simply be content to form part of this belligerent expedition, hurry past inestimable wonders, bent solely on destruction... JACK ...you forget yourself, sir. \nSTEPHEN No Jack, You have forgotten your self. You once believed in the rights of each individual man no matter how useless or lowly. But it seems to me now that the long exercise of power has brought you to the point where even a solemn promise... \nJACK The promise was conditional. \nSTEPHEN ...a promise to a friend of ten years standing who has stood by you and supported you.... \nJACK (overlapping) I command a King's ship, not a private yacht... \nSTEPHEN ...across half the worlds oceans often at risk to his own life \nJACK ...and we have no time for your damned hobbies, sir! \n\"Hobbies\". So that is JACK's honest view of STEPHEN's lifetime of work in science. He bows slightly, then leaves. \n215         QUARTERDECK - DUSK \nSTEPHEN stands alone at the taffrail watching as the islands recede in the distance. \nNews of the violent argument has spread and there is many a sympathetic glance, which further humiliates STEPHEN. \nBLAKENEY approaches him carrying something carefully in the palm of his hand. \nBLAKENEY Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on the deck. \nHe opens his hand - close, on a very plain little brown beetle. \nBLAKENEY (CONT'D) I think it's a Galapagos Beetle, sir. \n", "test2_id": 472, "test3_input": "STEPHEN I'm sure of it. \nBLAKENEY Were you to have walked all day on the island, you might never have come across it. \nSTEPHEN That is more than likely, sure. \nBLAKENEY passes it to STEPHEN. \nBLAKENEY You can have it. \nSTEPHEN Thank you, Mr. Blakeney. \nBLAKENEY hovers for a moment, unsure of further conversation, then retreats. \n216       IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT \nJACK sits alone at the table. KILLICK enters with toasted cheese for two. \nKILLICK No music? That's a shame \nHe sets down the toasted cheese. \nKILLICK (CONT'D) I'll just leave the one plate then, if himself won't be joining. \nJACK Yes, Killick. Just the one. \nJACK cuts himself a portion, scowling at STEPHEN's cello which seems to watch him reproachfully as he eats. \n217.      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT \nSTEPHEN takes a dropper, carefully measures twenty drops of laudanum to a glass of water, and drinks. 218.        LOOKOUT - DAY \nThe lookout leaning out from the cross-trees. \nDOUDLE (shouting) On deck there. Object fine on the starboard bow. \n219.        THE SHIP LYING STATIONARY - DAY \nA barrel is being lifted aboard from the skiff and passed up the side of the ship. \n220.   IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP \nJACK comes down, accompanied by ALLEN, the acknowledged expert in these matters. \nOthers gather round, including HOGG the whaler, inspecting the stencilled markings. \nALLEN Martha's vineyard. \nHOGG No, this here's from Boston. I was married there once. \nALLEN Any road, it's a Yankee barrel. \nHOGG What they call a Bedford Hog in New England. \nMOWETT (to JACK) The Acheron touched at Boston. \nHOGG And it's not been in the water more than a week. \nALLEN One can't say with any accuracy but... \nHOGG Yes you can. There's no sea chummer on it, and the dowels is sound. \n221.        ON THE QUARTERDECK - DAY JACK returns to his post. \nJACK Continue due west, Mr. Bonden. \nTOM PULLINGS watches him. There has been a change amongst the officers and crew toward JACK. His relentless driving after the Acheron has reached the point of obsession, an obsession not shared by his exhausted men. \nHe is a lonely, haunted figure as he now steps up on the gunwale, one hand on the ratlines, scanning the empty sea, sensing his enemy is out there, just beyond the curve of the earth. \nDISSOLVE TO - \n222.        LADDER (TIME LAPSE) - DAY \nA wild wind humming through the rigging as STEPHEN goes topside. \n223.        FORECASTLE - DAY \nHe finds various hands making the boats secure. \nPLAICE Have you seen the bird, doctor? \nSTEPHEN I have not - no bird these many days. What kind of a bird? \nPLAICE A sort of albatross I believe, or perhaps a prodigious great mew. He has been following the ship since... there he is, crossing our wake! \n224.        ON THE GANGWAY - DAY \n", "test3_true": "Their eyes meet. The quarterdeck is JACK's domain now, and STEPHEN avoids it. \nThen, behind JACK, the great bird suddenly appears. \nIt's huge, with at least a fourteen foot wing-span, and flying very close to the ship, drifting and soaring on the gusting wind, appearing and disappearing between the sails. \nSTEPHEN is mesmerized by it. He lets go of the rail, leaning forward to get a better view. \nAt the same time across from STEPHEN on the opposite gangway, HOWARD and two or three marines open fire on the bird. The bird drops low, flying right by STEPHEN. \nAgain a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently uninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the water. \nSTEPHEN sags to the deck. A shout. People running. Blood spreading across the white of his shirt. HOWARD there by his side. \nHOWARD My God, man! I'm so sorry. The bird dropped low. I didn't see you there! \nJACK is there, shouting - \nJACK Calamy! Get Higgins! (then turning to BONDEN) Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below. \nSTEPHEN gets slowly up, hands reaching to help him, HOWARD in the background distraught, explaining to anyone who'll listen what happened. \nSTEPHEN It's all right, I am quite capable of walking. \nHe tries to stand, crumples. \n225.        STEPHEN's CABIN - DAY \nHIGGINS presses clumsily around the wound as STEPHEN lies on the bed, his abdomen rigid, his breathing laboured. JACK watches from the door. \nSTEPHEN You will just make it worse... by prodding, Mr. Higgins, it cannot be got at... except by opening me up. \nA violent pitching of the ship makes it obvious how impossible this will be under sail. \nAs STEPHEN lapses into unconsciousness, HIGGINS looking alarmed, approaches JACK. \nHIGGINS (a whisper) The bullet took a piece of shirt in with it. Unless it is removed it will suppurate and fester. \nJACK Are you equal to the task? \nHIGGINS I'll need to read up on the Doctor's books, like. Study some pictures he has, get my bearings. Be better on land, but I'll manage somehow. \nJACK looks away from the alcoholic HIGGINS back to STEPHEN. \n226.   OUTSIDE THE CABIN \nJACK passes an anxious crowd of the ship's company: BLAKENEY, JOE PLAICE, KILLICK and HOWARD. \nJACK You men get about your business. \nThere are dark looks in JACK's direction as he retreats to his cabin. \n227.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY \nJACK throws a chart on the table. \nWith his protractor he marches out great strides west into the Pacific from the Galapagos Islands and marks the ship's position - they are maybe a hundred miles from the Galapagos, ahead, open sea until the Marquesas. \n228.       INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN - DUSK \nLying on his bed, in some pain, STEPHEN hears thudding feet, shouted orders. \nIn his weakened state, the sounds tend to merge. His pitching cabin keeps swimming out of focus. \nThere's a knock on the door and JEMMY DUCKS appears with a mug of soup and some biscuit. JEMMY DUCKS ...sail on the horizon, sir. Hull down, running west. It may be a couple of days before we can catch her. \nSTEPHEN nods, all he wants is quiet. \nJEMMY DUCKS retreats, as STEPHEN swigs from a little bottle of laudanum, which for a moment brings peace, effectively blocking out the noise from above. \nA smile to PADEEN, like a farewell, and he closes his eyes. \n229.        FORECASTLE - DUSK \nJACK, telescope to his eye, studies the distant ship as PULLINGS jumps down from the ratlines to the deck. \nPULLINGS It might be the Acheron. If we put on more sail we'd come up with her before nightfall. \nJACK lowers the telescope, turns his back on PULLINGS, strangely abstracted. \nPULLINGS (CONT'D) (to his back) Do you wish me to set the topgallants? (no reply) Sir? \nA long silence. Then JACK walks away. \nPULLINGS stares perplexed from JACK's retreating figure to the distant chase. \nDISSOLVE TO - \n", "test3_id": 473}

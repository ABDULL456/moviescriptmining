CALAMY holds his head and PADEEN, MATURIN's giant manservant, his legs, which are lashed together. \nBLAKENEY No. Mamma. Mamma. \nSTEPHEN It is the laudanum speaking. You will be a regular Nelson. \nHe tests the edge of his knife with his thumb. \nCALAMY places the leather gag between BLAKENEY's teeth. Padeen mumbles a Gaelic prayer. STEPHEN turns and grips BLAKENEY shattered arm. \nA sharp, grating noise as STEPHEN works out of shot, cutting off the arm. \nClose on STEPHEN, lips compressed, utterly focussed. \nHe puts down the bloody knife and reaches for the spatula in the pail of hot tar. \nBLAKENEY has not uttered a sound, though he is shaking uncontrollably and his face is wet with tears. CALAMY has tears in his eyes also. \nSTEPHEN finishes his work, breathing hard, a gentle smile to BLAKENEY. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) There. I have never seen a braver patient. \n102.        SICK-BERTH - NIGHT \nAn exhausted CALAMY keeps vigil by BLAKENEY's cot. The boy wakes, and looks for CALAMY in the darkness. \nBLAKENEY Peter? Is that you? I dreamed they cut my arm off. \nThen he realizes, with sudden horror, that it wasn't a dream \nCALAMY You would have died else. \nBlakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away \nCALAMY (CONT'D) Come. You can still sup your grog with your left. And I shall take your turn at marbles. \n103.        MIZZEN TOPGALLANT - DAY \nMOWETT stands in the cross-trees, making a final check on the lashings round the new mizzen top. Below him the great work is nearing completion, men swarming like ants over every part of the hull. \nMOWETT climbs down past FASTER DOUDLE who has one leg looped through the shrouds and is splicing a rope with both hands and his teeth. \nFarther down, a patched sail is being furled up tight in its gaskets. \nBeyond that, at the base of the main-mast a fascinated group of men have gathered to watch the Doctor trepanning JOE PLAICE. \n104.        BASE OF THE MAINMAST - DAY \nSTEPHEN's drill carves out a neat disc of bone to reveal a purplish mass which he starts spooning from the cavity. \nA small crowd of crewmen pause in their work, watching the doctor with morbid fascination as he drops the purple stuff in a dish. \nSLADE (shouts) Is them his brains, Doctor? \nSTEPHEN No, that is just blood. These are his brains. \nExposing them to view. Several of the crew move in for a closer look. The armourer hands STEPHEN a flattened coin, which he begins to screw in place over the cavity as the old hands whisper his praises to the men who have never seen Stephen at work. \nSLADE Physician he is, not one of your common surgeons. \nFASTER DOUDLE Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and the strong fives, wouldn't look at you for under ten guineas on land. \nDAVIES [   ] Knows his birds and beasts too boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell you what it's thinking. 105.           THE SURPRISE - DAY \nA wind causes the ship to turn on its moorings, stirring impatiently, like a racehorse ready to be off as... \n106.           QUARTERDECK - DAY \n...JACK jumps down from the mizzen ratlines. \nJACK Let us be off, Mr. Allen! \nALLEN Weigh anchor! All hands to make sail. Mr Hollom! \n107. ON DECK \nBarefoot men are suddenly running to their stations, racing above and below, running out along the bowsprit, up the ratlines, along the yards. \nA small group, supposed to be assisting Hollom, are contrasting slow off the mark \nHOLLOM Bear a hand there you fellows! \nThe men he is addressing, shoot him a look of distaste which unsettles Hollom slightly, then they assist him pulling on a rope \n108.

MASTS OF THE SURPRISE - DAY \nThe shrouds darken with climbing figures, framed against the sun. HOLLAR (O.S.) Trice up. Lay out. Sheet home! Hoist away! \n112.        QUARTERDECK - DAY \nHOLLAR staring up as the sails unfurl and fill with wind. \nHOLLAR Cheerly there in the foretop, our William! T'garnsl sheets! Hands to the braces! \nMen slide down ropes from high amongst the shrouds, then swing out and drop down to the deck like monkeys, pulling ropes and sails tight with the weight of their bodies. \n113.        WIDE SHOT - DAY \nThe ship spreading its wings. A sudden cracking of canvas as she turns and runs directly downwind. \n114.        QUARTERDECK - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe sun has sunk lower. BONDEN, solid as the rock of Gibraltar is back at the helm, the wind stronger and directly behind. \nJACK Speed, Mr. Boyle \nBOYLE heaves the log clear of the ship's side. The log line races out on its reel. BOYLE checks the run, pulls the pin. \nBOYLE Ten and a half knots, Sir. \nJACK makes no comment but the news seems to please him. \n115.        CLOSE TO THE WATER - DUSK \nThe great hull powers past us. \n116.   DELETED \n117.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT \nKILLICK prepares toasted cheese in his small serving-area. From inside the cabin, the sound of a violin and a cello tuning up. KILLICK glances irritably at the door and elbows his mate, BLACK BILL. \nKILLICK Here we go again: scrape, scrape, screech, screech and never a tune you could dance to, not if you were drunk as Davey's sow. \n118.    INSIDE THE GREAT CABIN \nJACK and STEPHEN are both keen amateur musicians - JACK, violin, STEPHEN cello. \nAs Stephen completes his tuning, Jack experiments with a refrain. \nSTEPHEN Is that one I know, or are we breaking new ground? \nJACK I am trying to remember that air they played all those years ago at the Governors house in Port Mahon. You remember When we first met. Corelli if I'm not mistaken. \nHe plays another riff \nSTEPHEN If that is your \"A\" you are very much so. This is A. \nJack corrects his A string, plays another few bars \nJACK Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pom \nSTEPHEN All I remember is you being unable to sit in your seat the entire performance. \nJACK Aye and you practising apon that poor bishop with your \"puddings athwart the starboard Gumbrils\" or some such arrant nonsense. \nSTEPHEN (laughs) No. That was off Toulon, during the blockade. At our first meeting they played this: \nHe plays a short refrain \nJACK No. No. Entirely off the mark.   pom-pom- POM I have now \nHe plays another variation \nSTEPHEN (enjoying the game) Or was it something like this.... \nCello answers violin, as they hand it back and forth, improvising freely now with an infinity of variations, sometimes playing together, sometimes separately, suddenly hitting it, the music soaring and continuing over \n119.        A HIGH POINT OF VIEW, TIME LAPSE - DAY \nThe tiny ship on the vastness of the ocean. From its side, cotton-wool puffs of smoke. \n120.        GUN-DECK - SAME TIME \n", "test1_id": 471, "test2_input": "HOLLOM (smiling weakly) Twenty-five next Friday. \nJACK You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice. You can't spend the rest of your life as a midshipman. \nHOLLOM I'll try harder, Sir. \nKILLICK helps JACK on with his full-dress uniform. \nJACK Well, it's an unfortunate business, Hollom. Damned unfortunate. \nKILLICK seems to endorse this by placing the captain's hat emphatically on JACK's head. \nJack turns and strides out of the cabin, HOLLOM following slowly after him. \n182.        QUARTERDECK, DOLDRUMS - DAY \nThe entire crew has been mustered. The uniformed officers line the quarterdeck as JACK reads from the Articles of War. \nJACK 'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not capital, committed by any person or persons in the fleet... shall be punished according to the laws, and customs, of the sea.' (then, to NAGEL) Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man and yet you failed to salute an officer. You knew what you were doing. Have you anything to say in your defence? \nNAGEL looks at the deck. \nNAGEL No, Sir. \nJACK Have his officers anything to say for him? \nDAVIES and KILLICK scowl across the deck at HOLLOM, who looks wretched but says nothing. \nJACK (CONT'D) Seize him up. \nNAGEL is spread-eagled to the grating, his hands tied. \nHOLLAR Seized up, Sir. \nJACK One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty. \nThe mate takes the leather cat-o-nine tails out of its red bag. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP ON - \n183.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK \nJACK stands alone, tuning his fiddle. No matter how much he turns the peg the top string always sounds flat. He tunes some more and breaks it. \nJACK Red hell... \n184.        QUARTERDECK - DUSK \nJACK (O.S.) ...and bloody death! \nEvery word is plainly audible to the men on watch, who pretend to hear nothing. \n185.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK \nJACK is fitting a new string. Widen to reveal STEPHEN sitting opposite with his cello. \nSTEPHEN I was merely remarking that you have always prided yourself on not being a flogging captain and this... JACK I am not a \"flogging captain\". I have not once rigged the grating on this voyage, not once in twelve thousand miles. Besides, I wager you will find a deal more brutality on land. \nTightening the new string. The note escalating as he turns. \nSTEPHEN I'm not a party to it on land. \nJACK Well you are party to it on my ship. Men must be governed. Often not wisely I grant you, but there are hierarchies even in nature, as you've often said yourself. \nSTEPHEN Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte. \nJACK (trying to call a halt) Yes. Fine words I'm sure \nSTEPHEN (continues regardless) ...We are not animals and I for one am opposed to authority, that egg of misery and oppression.. \nJACK Very fine words Stephen, but In these current circumstances, hard-work and firm discipline is what keeps our little wooden world together. \nSTEPHEN And grog I suppose. \nJACK Of course. What of it? Of course they have their grog! \nSTEPHEN (sits) (CONT'D) You know Nagel was drunk when he insulted Hollom. And Higgins is never sober. Even the midshipmen... \nJACK The men will have their grog Stephen. It is part of the immemorial tradition of the service \nSTEPHEN Well a shameful tradition it is too. To have them pressed from their homes, kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation. \nJACK Stephen... \nSTEPHEN ...confined for months in a wooden prison, Never more than a few hours sleep and flogged when drunken idleness drives them to.... \n", "test2_true": "STEPHEN I am stating plain facts \nJACK (finally explodes) Well I will not hear them! From you or anyone. You understand! Things are as they are for good or bad whether or not they have a place in your damned papist philosophy. If you are here to make music then sit down and play. If not be gone, for you have come to the wrong shop for anarchy! \nIn stony silence Stephen puts down his cello bow and leaves past Killick, who is lurking as always by the door. \n186.        SCUTTLEBUTT - DUSK \nSomething disturbs the dark surface of the water as HOLLOM dips the ladle and fills his cup. \nA sense of someone moving up behind him. HOLLOM turns abruptly. It's the marine sentry, moving in the shadows. He stares at HOLLOM as he backs away toward the ladder and hurries below. \n187.        BERTH DECK - DUSK To reach his quarters he is obliged to walk the length of the berth deck, past HOWARD obsessively cleaning his pistol, another man whittling with a knife, DAVIES adding another link in the tattooed chain about BECKETT's middle. \nNo-one speaks as HOLLOM runs the gauntlet of their stares, acutely aware of his own breathing. It now seems universally to be held that he is the author of all the ship's misfortune. \nNagle pointedly turns his back, the scars from the flogging gleaming wetly in the lamplight \nHollom's breath quickens. He stumbles on someone's dunnage, almost trips but is caught before he falls. It's one of NAGEL's mates. \nNAGEL's MATE Careful, sir. \n188.        MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - DUSK \nHOLLOM comes in, wild-eyed and goes to his berth, breathing hard. CALAMY, BLAKENEY & BOYLE look up from a tense game of cards. \nBLAKENEY Are you all right, Hollom? \nHOLLOM shakes his head miserably, hyperventilating. \nCALAMY He's not sick. He's useless. He's just dodging work. \nBLAKENEY (angrily) Oh shut up Calamay. What do you know about anything? \nCALAMY glares at BLAKENEY. \n189.   INT STEPHEN'S ROOM - DUSK \nA shot from the deck above. \nSTEPHEN looks up from his book \"Di Consolazione Philosophae\". Then the sound of bare feet approaching, followed by a knock at the door. \nIts Joe Plaice, looking agitated. PLAICE Beg your pardon, your honour, but Mr. Howard just shot a sea-monster! \n190.        GANGWAY - DUSK \nSTEPHEN and PLAICE stride along to where the marine captain, HOWARD, peers down into the water with one of his men. \nHOWARD Doctor! The very man. \nSTEPHEN moves to the rail, looks out. \nHOWARD (CONT'D) [   ] I wished you'd seen it for yourself, Doctor. The crew never seen anything like it. \nOn the glassy sea, a smudge of blood and some ripples \nHOWARD (CONT'D) It was prodigious like a human, though bigger, might have been a sea-elephant, it had a calf with it - I didn't mean to hit the calf, I missed my mark. \nSTEPHEN Mr. Howard, let me beg you, if the men can't eat it or I can't dissect it, please do not shoot every creature you see. \nSTEPHEN stares back down at the ripples spreading over the glassy sea. \n191.        THE SURPRISE - NIGHT \nWide, on the troubled ship, small yellow patches of light visible from the gun-ports. \n192.        BELOW DECKS - NIGHT \nThe men are lying in their hammocks when, from somewhere outside, there comes an ungodly howling. It stops, then comes again, exactly human in its pitch. \nThe crew look at one another. This is like no sound they've ever heard. The howling stops then comes again, from another direction. \n193.          THE GREAT CABIN, EXTERIOR - NIGHT \nKILLICK and BLACK BILLY listening. \nKILLICK What did I tell you? The ship's accursed. \n194.          QUARTERDECK - NIGHT \nJACK comes up from below. \nJACK What is that abominable noise, for God's sake? \nPULLINGS I have no idea, Sir. \nMOWETT You don't think it's the Acheron, Sir? \n", "test2_id": 472, "test3_input": "They have been looting their own ship's valuables, two of them are too drunk to be scared. \nJACK Where is your captain? Ou est votre capitaine? \nOne man leaps out through the shattered windows. A couple of others raise their hands and start jabbering in French and Spanish. \n298.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON \nIt's all over for the Acherons as a French officer hauls down their colours. \nA cheer from the Surprises - a few last shots fired. CALAMY and BLAKENEY cheering, BLAKENEY holding aloft the captured flag. \nA dying Frenchman suddenly lunges at CALAMY with a sabre. BLAKENEY steps in front of him and takes the blow. \n299.   IN THE SICK-BERTH, ACHERON \nA doctor is working here, a callow-faced man in a bloody apron, red-eyed from fatigue. \nJACK enters, a fearsome sight, with his singed yellow hair and blood-stained cutlass. \nJACK Le Capitaine? Where is he? \nThe doctor points at a body on the operating table. \nJACK approaches, looks down at the dead man. He's [ ] somewhere about JACK's age, fine-featured, with his black coat draped over his body. DOCTOR Il m\u00e1vait prie de vous donner ceci. \nPassing JACK the captain's sword. \n300.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON \nJACK picks his way through the dead and wounded to where CALAMY sits nursing BLAKENEY. \nCALAMY He's dead, sir. \nGently, JACK picks up the lifeless body and walks slowly back down the quarterdeck, the boy draped across his arms. \nFriend and foe part silently in front of him as he crosses the gangway to... \n301.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE \n...then with CALAMY following, he goes below. \n302.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY \nJACK in wide shot, sitting alone on the bench running under the stern windows. His hunched posture and red tear-stained eyes give a glimpse of his familiar post-battle mood - a mix of grief and depression, the old question, \"Was it worth the price?\". \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP ON - \n303.         ACHERON AND SURPRISE - DAWN \nThe two ships anchored close together on the ocean. \n304.         QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAWN \nAs eight bells are rung for the change of watch we see a row of canvas hammocks each containing the body of a fallen crewman. \nDAVIES and PLAICE stitch the bodies into their hammocks, BLAKENEY the last body in the line. As the men approach - \nCALAMY I'll do it. JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him alone. \nAs CALAMY sews up the hammock, HOLLAR's voice is heard distinctly from below. \nHOLLAR (O.S.) Rise and shine, show a leg there. Tumble up! Tumble up! \nIn close-up: the peaceful face of BLAKENEY \nHOLLAR (O.S.) (CONT'D) Sleepers awake! \n...as CALAMY's hands stitch the canvas closed. \n305.        WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - DAWN \nThe small figures of the crew assembled on the quarterdeck. JACK's voice drifting across the water. \nJACK John Henry ALLEN... Joseph NAGEL... William Horner... Stephen Winston Boyle... and Lieutenant William Blakeney \nWe therefore commit their bodies to the deep, looking for the resurrection of the body, when the sea shall give up her dead... Amen. \nALL Amen. \nThe bodies in their weighted hammocks slide into the sea. \n306.        BOW OF THE SURPRISE - DAY \nWide on STEPHEN and BLAKENEY as they sit watching two dolphins surfing the bow-wave, STEPHEN pointing out various features of these magnificent creatures, doing his best to take the boy's mind off the loss of his friend. \n", "test3_true": "The two ships sail abreast - the Acheron, her shattered masts jury-rigged. \n308.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAY \nJACK stands with LIEUTENANT MOWETT and the signals midshipman, WILLIAMSON. They look across at the Acheron. \nJACK Signal... 'Parole prisoners Valparaiso'... \nWILLIAMSON You mean Lieutenant Pullings, Sir? \nJACK No. Captain Pullings. \nWILLIAMSON hurries to the signals locker, the signal book and JACK's message in his hand. \n309.   TELESCOPE POV   DAY \nThe line of colored signal-flags run up to the mast-head of the Surprise. \n309A   QUARTERDECK ACHERON \nMidshipman Rye is reading the signal for Pullings \nRYE ....then 'Rendezvous Portsmouth. God- speed, Captain Pullings.' \nA contented smile on Pullings face as his promotion is confirmed. He waves across to JACK as the Acheron makes a sharp turn away from the Surprise. \n310.   DELETED \n311.   ABOUT THE SHIP - DUSK \nSlowly the crew come back to life as old familiar habits and routines reassert themselves. \n\u00b7 Acting First Lieutenant MOWETT walks the quarterdeck composing a poem in memory of the battle. \n\u00b7 JOE PLAICE tells a story of witchcraft and haunted ships to a small attentive audience. \n\u00b7 While AWKWARD DAVIES works further on the tattoo about BECKETT's waist. The chain begun off BRAZIL now winds its way around most of his torso. \n\u00b7 BLAKENEY and JEMMY DUCKS are feeding the assorted creatures collected at the Galapagos, as... \n\u00b7 BONDEN reads his first book, 'Diseases of Seamen' by Stephen Maturin, his brow furrowed, his lips moving silently. \n\u00b7 While the powder-monkeys skylark in the rigging \n313.   INTERIOR, GREAT CABIN - NIGHT \nSTEPHEN plays a note on his cello [      ] \nSTEPHEN Shall we begin? \nJACK pauses, gazing into space. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) Jack, brother, you're gathering wool. \nJACK (smiles) Thinking about their captain. A great seaman, whatever you may say of him. The doctor said he was killed by our first broadside. I'd have liked to talk to him, face to face. \nSTEPHEN Maybe you did. \nJACK What? \nSTEPHEN While I was tending the prisoners they told me their doctor died of fever, two weeks ago. There was no doctor on that ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you will find one there now. \nJACK goes very still. A silence broken only by the sound of water flowing gently past the hull. \nHe looks down at the captain's sword on the table, the thought of a possible final deception flooding through him. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) Shall we? He starts to play, the deep booming sound of the cello carrying through to .... \n312.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT \nKILLICK, wearing an ostentatious bandage about his head, is preparing toasted cheese with BLACK BILL. \nKILLICK That's the last of the cheese and like as not they'll leave it seizing to their plates with their tweedly tweedly tweedly. \nJACK (O.S.) Killick? KILLICK THERE! \nKILLICK (projecting) Which it will be ready when it's ready! \nIn the cabin, the violin joins with the cello. Rolling, undeniable music, the music of the waves, resonating through the great ship and filling the night. Stephens mind is far away. Jack breaks off abruptly: \nJACK \nYou're still missing your cormorant... flightless eh...well then. It will still be there when we come back \nAnd he breaks into a merry jig \n313.

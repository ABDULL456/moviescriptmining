THE CADETS Sir, yes, sir! 
WEST Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident - Give me a sir, yes, sir! THE CADETS Sir, yes, sir! WEST In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand - Give me a sir, yes, sir! THE CADETS Sir, yes, sir! WEST So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military - you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand! He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row.   PIKE. WEST My power here is absolute, isn't that right, nigger? PIKE Sir, yes, sir! West hauls off and SLAPS Pike across the face! WEST I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where we string greasy coon necks up from tree branches when the mood strikes us you have a problem with that? PIKE Sir, no, sir! West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM. The others Cadets GASP. Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so great. He reaches up automatically to try and save himself... 
WEST What the fuck is this? You lay a hand on me while I'm trying to do my duty and rid the world of you? He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him. Pike goes fetal on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming. WEST Get the fuck up, you're still in formation, get the fuck up! Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes. WEST What the fuck have you done to that uniform, take it off, take it off, take it off! Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough.    West slaps him again and tears the man's shirt off. WEST Get those fucking pants off, I want you buck ass naked, you don't deserve to wear these beautiful United States Army issue clothes! Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED. West turns and spies Dunbar in the line. WEST Cadet, what's your name! DUNBAR Sir, Dunbar, sir! WEST You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar? DUNBAR Sir, yes, sir! West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him. WEST Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear? DUNBAR Sir, yes, sir! 
WEST The rest of you, fallout for physicals! The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike. One with a gun, the other naked. DUNBAR (V.O.) Fifteen guys quit that day.    But not Pike. EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD. DUNBAR (V.O.) Time went on and the Sarge started singling people out. One of the Cadets, a small man named ANDERSON, falls from the log. Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol. EXT. TARMAC -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- AFTERNOON Anderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO PAINT CANS perpendicular to his body as West berates him. DUNBAR He'd zero in on a fella and ride him till he quit. EXT. MAIN GATE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT Anderson, now in civilian clothes, gets into a TAXI.   Quit. EXT. FIRING RANGE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING West, screaming at a weasely looking cadet named CHILDS. DUNBAR (V.O.) Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in what he called Section Eight. INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT A horribly dilapidated quarters. Four cadets, Dunbar, Pike, Childs, and MUELLER sleep in rickety bunks. DUNBAR (V.O.) Washout rejects, guys he said were , "dumbfucks too stupid to know they were dead". He separated us from the rest. We slept alone... 
INT. MESS HALL -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING The same four Cadets, eating ON THE FLOOR as the other members of the Cadet Corps chow at tables. DUNBAR (V.O.) . . .ate alone.. . EXT. REGULAR BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- EVENING The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet Corps files into their barracks for sleep. DUNBAR ( V. O . ) ...and trained long after the other guys got to turn in. EXT. PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING The Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the "dead one"), whose t-shirt has a spot on it. DUNBAR (V.O.) Fellas lived in daily fear of being Sectioned and with good reason, too. West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters. DUNBAR They figured we were the boys who'd meet with a "training accident" . Nunez takes a place among them.   Looking absolutely terrified. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY Osborne leans forward. OSBORNE Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you? DUNBAR No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class. HARDY That's not exactly true... (off their looks) I'm living proof. How did you get Sectioned, Ray? 
Dunbar gives a look that almost resembles a smile. DUNBAR That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300. OSBORNE Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out. DUNBAR There were six of us... EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE.-- ONE WEEK AGO -- EVENING The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw. DUNBAR (V.O.) Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good ol' boy type. One of those "his Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun" . He idolized West. Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace. Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild. DUNBAR (V.O.) And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big fella from New Mexico. After he got Sectioned he just followed Mueller around like a lap dog. He wasn't mean like Mueller, though, didn't have it in him. Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes. DUNBAR (V.O.) But Childs did. Didn't talk to anyone, but you got this feeling something was wrong with him, like real wrong. Type of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near. Behind Childs runs Pike. DUNBAR (V.O.) Pike I told you about. He took the brunt of it from Mueller and West. Once they found it out he was a convict they were merciless. (MORE) 
DUNBAR (V.O.) (CONT'D) He'd been busted for Auto Theft, judge gave him the option of jailor the Army. He made the wrong choice. Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.   Kendall is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing. DUNBAR Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was a smart guy, we got along okay. Pike and I tried to help him, but... Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet. DUNBAR (V.O.) He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy? OSBORNE (V.O.) Epilepsy. DUNBAR (V.O.) Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY HARDY And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you? DUN BAR Yeah.   And that's all I'm saying. Hardy leans back in his chair. HARDY You smoke, Ray? DUNBAR This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more. HARDY No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some. Dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of Dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table. HARDY My brand.   Must be my lucky day. 
He takes one and lights it.      Dunbar does the same. HARDY Let me ask you one thing. You seem like a good guy, Ray. You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup. So what I don't get is what you did to make Nunez want to kill you? Dunbar just looks at the ground. A KNOCK at the door.    Hardy and Osborne turn to see an M.P. stick his head in. M. P. Sirs? INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- MORNING Hardy and Osborne emerge to find Styles waiting for them. HARDY He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him- STYLES He can wait.     Kendall's out of surgery. EXT. ARMY JEEP (MOVING) -- MORNING Hardy and Osborne sit in the back of the open car as it rumbles across the grounds, headed towards the Base Hospital. They sit in silence until: HARDY Why'd you join the army? Osborne looks at him, annoyed. OSBORNE You really want to make banal chit- Chat like that now? HARDY You're right. We should sit in silence. OSBORNE We're in the middle of a murder case- HARDY Best time for banal chit-chat. He slips something into his pocket. OSBORNE What is that?

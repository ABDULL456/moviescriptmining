Abe looks at Kelly.

Kelly nods. Eve wakes up.

KELLY You were expecting some one else? 
HOSPITAL CORRIDOR 
Kelly and Eve get snacks from the vending machine. 
KELLY He looks good. 
Eve looks at Kelly, her face full of love and sadness. 
EVE He looks just like you. 
Kelly nods slowly, taking this in. And it is finally too much. 
He breaks down and cries. For the fear and the misplaced rage, the fights and the stubbornness. 
But finally, relief. 
They walk back down the hall together. Eve reaches out and puts her hand on Kelly's neck.

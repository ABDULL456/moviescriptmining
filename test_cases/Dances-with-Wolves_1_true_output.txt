The men ride through the carnage in a sad daze. 
Now they reach the center of the cathedral and here they find a few crude leantos, hewn from freshly cut wood. The people who stayed here had bigger plans for all the felled wood, but lost ambition and settled for these ugly hovels. 
A great pile of wild turkeys, perhaps twenty birds in all, sit to one side. They haven't even been plucked. Just shot and left to rot. 
Dances With Wolves notices half a dozen liquor bottles in a heap of trash. 
He cannot bring himself to look at Kicking Bird. Any man would be repulsed at these sights, but in Dances With Wolves' case there is a feeling of shame as well. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES We must wait for these people... 
Kicking Bird says nothing for a long time. 
KICKING BIRD No, they've been gone a week maybe more... we will water the horses and go home. 
He turns his pony away. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are alone on a great sea of prairie. 
There's a little fire going. A sage hen is being roasted, but for some time we hear nothing but the light crackle of the fire. Each man is preoccupied with his own thoughts, thoughts of the broken forest. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES You have asked me many times about the white people... you always ask how many more are coming. 
Dances With Wolves looks at his friend and mentor. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES There will be a lot my friend... more than can be counted. 
KICKING BIRD Help me to know how many. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES Like the stars. 
This is what Kicking Bird wanted to know. And it hits him like a rock. 
Kicking Bird bows his head in thought while Dances With Wolves raises his. He never wanted to say this, he wishes it wasn't true. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES It makes me afraid for all the Sioux. 
INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY 
The old man puffs away at his trusty pipe. Now he lays it down. Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are waiting patiently. 
TEN BEARS It's hard to know what to do. 
The old man gets up, walks to his bedside, reaches up into the sacred rigging above an takes down a melon-sized rawhide bundle. He brings this back to the fire and unwraps it slowly. Inside is a rusted hunk of metal, the helmet of a Spanish conquistador. 
TEN BEARS The men who wore this came in the time of my grandfather's grandfather. Eventually, we drove them out. Then the Mexicans came. In my own time the whites came... the Texans. They have been like all the others who find something they want in our country. They take it without asking. I have always been a peaceful man, happy to be in my own country and wanting nothing from the white people. Nothing at all. But I think you are right. I think they will keep coming. When I think of that, I look at this bundle. Our country is all that we want. We will fight to keep it. 
He picks up his pipe and puffs deeply. 
TEN BEARS Tomorrow morning we will strike the village and go to the winter camp. 
EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY 
The whole camp is being struck. There is activity everywhere. 
INT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY 
Stands With A Fist is packing and so is Dances With Wolves. He is putting away the shield that Stone Calf once worked on. She pauses to stroke her husband's leg tenderly. 
STANDS WITH A FIST You have everything from the soldier fort? 
DANCES WITH WOLVES No, there is nothing for me there. 
Stands with A Fist laughs as she starts out of the lodge. 
STANDS WITH A FIST That's good. 
But as he tightens the leather thongs on the shield case, Dances With Wolves' face begins to cloud. 
EXT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY 
Dances With Wolves bolts out of the lodge and snatches up Cisco's reins. He calls urgently to Stands with A Fist. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES Stands With A Fist... wait... 
EXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY 
The village is about ready to move, just a few last minute flurries of activity. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES The words in the book are like a trail for people to follow. It tells everything about my life here. I must get it. 
KICKING BIRD We cannot wait for you. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES I will catch up. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
Dances With Wolves and Cisco are cantering quickly over the open prairie. 
EXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY 
Old Fort Sedgewick is just beyond the next rise. Dances With Wolves eases Cisco into a full run. 
They fly so quickly over the rise that Dances With Wolves has no time to react. 
There must be forty or fifty of them; talking, walking, working and playing. Old Fort Sedgewick is crawling with them. Blue-coated soldiers. 
Just in front of him is a deep-bedded wagon carrying a cargo of SOLDIERS. They've been out cutting wood. But now the men in the wagon are scrambling for their rifles and screaming out the alarm... "Indians!" 
Dances With Wolves puts everything he has into pulling Cisco up.

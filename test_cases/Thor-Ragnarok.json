SMOLDERING, BEGINNING TO TURN ORANGE IN THE    A3 HEAT AS WE TILT UP TO SEE- \n-FIRE.    NOTHING BUT FIRE. \n2    INT. TIGHT SPACE - INDETERMINATE TIME                           2 \nDark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps through iron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains. \nIt's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That rough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road. \nHe awakens with a JOLT.   Looks around. \nTHOR Now I know what you're thinking. Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen? (then:) Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody. It's a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn't find any. That's when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you. \nReveal that he's talking to a weird alien skeleton in chains. \nTHOR (CONT'D) How much longer do you think we'll be here? \nNOISE.    Sounds of metal gears TURNING. \nSuddenly the bottom DROPS OUT! Thor PLUMMETS until - SHLINK! Chains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent. Thor dangles six feet off the ground. Pull back to reveal we are in- BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    2. \n3   INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS                                  3 \nA cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings are molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it. Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton. \nSURTUR (O.S.) Thor, Son of Odin. \nThor's chain turns to reveal- \n-SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull. \nTHOR Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're still alive! I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago. \nSURTUR I cannot die. Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home. \nTHOR You know, it's funny you should mention that because I've been having these terrible dreams of late. Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them. \nSURTUR Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard. The great prophecy-- \nTHOR (O.S.) Hang on.   Hang on. \nReveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY. \nTHOR (CONT'D) I'll be back around shortly. I really feel like we were connecting there. \nAfter a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16           3. \nSURTUR My time has come. When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame, I shall be restored to my full might. I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgard's-- \nTHOR Oh, hang on. Give it a second. \nOnce again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY. \nTHOR (CONT'D) I swear I'm not even moving, it's just doing this on its own. I'm really sorry. (then:) Okay, let me get this straight. You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house-- \nSURTUR A mountain! \nTHOR The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard? \nSurtur grins, evil. \nSURTUR Odin is not on Asgard. And your absence has left the throne defenseless. \nThat elicits a concerned look from Thor. \nTHOR Okay, so where is it? This crown? \nSURTUR This is my Crown, the source of my power. \nSurtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head.. \nTHOR Oh, that's a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow. \nSURTUR It's a crown. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   4. \nTHOR Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head. \nSurtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword. \nSURTUR But Ragnarok has   already begun. You cannot stop it.    I am Asgard's doom, and so are   you. All will suffer, all will   burn. \nSurtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor's feet, holding it so he and Thor are face to face. \nTHOR That's intense. To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle. But it looks like I'm going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard's vault. \nSURTUR You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it? \nBehind his back, Thor opens his hand.    Sending out the SOS. \nTHOR Because that's what heroes do. \nSKURGE You girls are in for a treat. \nAngle on Heimdall's sword, which has been sloppily cast aside in another pile of \"stuff.\" Skurge hastily runs and grabs it. \n10   EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS                                    10 \nThor is FLYING at top speed, but that dragon is right on his heels! The fire demons LAUNCH flaming projectiles from below! \nThor looks back, genuinely nervous. The dragon is OPENING its jaws to swallow Thor whole when- \n-Suddenly Bi-Frost OPENS! The portal surrounds Thor and engulfs the dragon's head! In an instant, they're gone. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 8. \nMAIN TITLE \n11   INT. THE OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER                           11 \nSkurge has plunged Heimdall's sword into Bi-Frost. \nBOOM! Thor EXPLODES out of the portal along with the severed head of the dragon! SPLAT! Blood and guts RAIN DOWN on Skurge and the two women, DRENCHING them with purple gore. \nThe dragon's head SLIDES slowly across the floor, coming to rest right in front of the women who are frozen in shock. \nThe women SHRIEK and rush out of the Observatory. Thor meanwhile is clean and staggering back to his feet. He looks up to Skurge, who is wiping dragon guts off of himself. \nSKURGE Girls! (beat) Well well, look who decided to pop in. Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains. \nTHOR Who are you? \nSKURGE Don't you remember? I'm Skurge. (Thor doesn't) We fought together on Vanaheim. \nTHOR Right.   Where's Heimdall? \nSKURGE That traitor. No one knows, he's a fugitive of the throne. \nTHOR Traitor? \nSKURGE Yeah, you see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty, but he disappeared before the trial. Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe. \nThor starts to say something, but then gives up. Instead he starts towards the exit... but Skurge stands in his way. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  9. \nTHOR Sure. \nSKURGE Hold on. I'm supposed to announce your arrival. \nThor SPINS UP Mjolnir and takes off in a blur.   Skurge starts the loooong run down the Rainbow Bridge. \n12    OMITTED                                                          12 \nA13   EXT. THEATER ENTRANCE - DAY                                      A13 \nTHOR arrives with Surtur's skull. \nThere's a small crowd making its way through a threshold over which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched in the `savior' pose. \nConfused, Thor turns to a theater patron. \nTHOR What the hell is that? \n13    EXT. ASGARD - ROYAL TERRACE - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER              13 \nLOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it's not Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we're watching a STAGE PLAY. \nIn the background, a single musician plays the haunting score from THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute. \nSuddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki. \nACTOR LOKI Oh, brother. This is it.    I take my leave. \nACTOR THOR You fool, you didn't listen! \nACTOR LOKI I'm sorry. \nACTOR THOR Lady Sif!     Get help! \n\"Sif\" awkwardly runs off. The \"Warriors Three\" watch sadly. A small choir JOINS IN as the music builds to a CRESCENDO. \nACTOR SIF Somebody help! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                10. \nIn the middle of the audience we reveal ODIN, sitting upon a chaise lounge, sipping wine and thoroughly enjoying the show. Unseen, Thor arrives behind the audience and watches. \nACTOR LOKI Sorry for all I've done. \nACTOR THOR It's all right.   Hold on. \nACTOR LOKI I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth. \nACTOR THOR They'd be lucky to have you. \nACTOR LOKI I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract. I just couldn't help myself. \nACTOR THOR I know. \nACTOR LOKI I'm a trickster. \nACTOR THOR So mischievous. \nACTOR LOKI Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog. \nACTOR THOR It was a wonderful joke. \nODIN (to no-one in particular) Twas indeed hilarious. \nACTOR THOR You are the savior of Asgard. \nLOKI Alright, I yield! \nThor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir. Loki looks to Thor, hands up defensively. Skurge arrives on the scene, a little late to warn Loki. \nSKURGE Behold!   Thor..Odinson. \nLOKI You had one job!    Just the one. \nTHOR Where's Odin? \nLOKI You just couldn't stay away, could you? Everything was fine without you. Asgard was prospering (gestures to the crowd) You've ruined everything. Ask them. \nThose who aren't freaked out are becoming gradually angrier. \nThor advances on Loki, who backs up onto the chaise lounge. \nTHOR Where's father?    Did you kill him? \nLOKI You had what you wanted, you had the independence you asked for! \nThor PRESSES Mjolnir onto Loki's chest. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 15. \nLOKI (CONT'D) Ow-ow-ow! Alright! I know exactly where he is. \n14   OMITTED                                                        14 \n15   OMITTED                                                        15 \n16   OMITTED                                                        16 \n17   EXT. SHADY ACRES NURSING HOME - MANHATTAN - DAY                17 \nA NURSING HOME sign on a brick wall. Suddenly the wall crumbles out of shot, revealing a demolition site. \nReveal Thor and Loki wearing street clothes. Thor carries an umbrella, Loki is dressed in a weird avant-garde suit. \nLOKI I swear, I left him right here. \nTHOR Right here on the sidewalk? Or right there, where the building that's being demolished? Great planning. \nLOKI How was I supposed to know? Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch. \nTHOR Then why do you dress like one? \nLOKI Hey. \nTHOR I can't believe you're alive. I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you. \nLOKI I'm honored. \nCOLLEGE GIRL 2 Ask him. \nCOLLEGE GIRL 1 Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16             16. \nTHOR Sure. (to Loki:) Start figuring out where he is. \nCOLLEGE GIRL 1 Oh, my god. \nCOLLEGE GIRL 2 Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you. \nTHOR She didn't dump me, you know.       I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping. \nThor notices something going on around Loki. \nTHOR (CONT'D) What's this, what are you doing!? \nLoki looks down to see that the sidewalk has started to GLOW BENEATH HIM! A circle of ancient symbols. \nLOKI This... isn't me. \nWHOOMPF! Loki DROPS out of sight, vanishing through solid concrete! Thor sees a CARD on the sidewalk where Loki was. \nThor pokes the business card. \nTHOR Loki? \nHe picks up the card.    It reads: \n177A Bleecker Street \nThor picks up the card and - WHOOSH! \n18   EXT. SANCTUM SANTORUM - DAY                                    18 \nThor approaches 177A Bleecker Street. \nHe knocks ONCE, TWICE, and then WHOOSH! \n19   INT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM UPSTAIRS PARLOR - CONTINUOUS            19 \nThor is suddenly inside Doctor Strange's lair! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  17. \nSTRANGE (O.S.) Thor Odinson. \nFrom a dark corner we glimpse a shape - DOCTOR STRANGE. Levitating, he drifts towards Thor. \nSTRANGE (CONT'D) God of Thunder. \nThor holds up the ratty umbrella, ready to defend himself. \nSTRANGE (CONT'D) You can put down the umbrella. \nThor gives Strange a sideways look but then sets his umbrella down. When he looks back up, the environment is furnished. \nDR. STRANGE (to Thor:) You can handle him from here. \nTHOR Yeah of course. (they shake hands) Thank you very much for your help. \nSTRANGE Good luck. \nLOKI Handle me?     Who are you? \nTHOR Loki. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   21. \nLoki DRAWS a dagger, ready to attack Strange. \nLOKI ..you think you're some kind of sorcerer? Don't think for one minute, you second-rate... \nDR. STRANGE Bye-bye. \nStrange GESTURES with both hands and- \n-WHOOSH!   PULLS the magic portal over them. \nJust like that, Thor and Loki are gone. \n20   OMITTED                                                            20 \n21   EXT. CLIFFS - DAY                                                  21 \nBeautiful, undisturbed nature.       We hear the ocean nearby. \nLOKI lands on the ground, portal closes behind them. \nTHOR Father? \nA lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at the cliff's edge, waves CRASHING below. \nIt is ODIN. He's dressed plainly in humble human clothes. The boys approach him quickly. \nODIN Look at this place. It's beautiful. \nTHOR Father, it's us. \nODIN My sons.   I've been waiting for you. \nLoki is surprised to hear Odin call him his son. \nTHOR I know.    We've come to take you home. \nODIN Home, yes. Your mother, she calls me. Do you hear it? \nThor fires a look at Loki, who holds up his hands in defense. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   22. \nTHOR Loki, lift your magic. \nOdin turns to Loki, who stiffens.    But Odin smiles. \nODIN Took me quite a while to break free from your spell. Frigga would have been proud. \nLoki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Thor staring at him, anger building. \nOdin puts a hand on Thor's shoulder, calming him. \nODIN (CONT'D) Come and sit with me. I don't have much time. \nOdin sits, out of breath, weak.    His sons sit beside him. \nTHOR I know that we failed you, but we can make this right. \nODIN I failed you. (beat) It is upon us...Ragnarok. \nTHOR No, I've stopped Ragnarok.    I put an end to Surtur. \nODIN No. It has already begun. She's coming. My life was all that held her back, but my time has come. I cannot keep her away any longer. \nTHOR Father, who are you talking about? \nODIN The Goddess of Death.     Hela.   My first born. (faces Thor) Your sister. \nThat hits Thor hard. Loki can't believe what he's hearing. \nTHOR ...what? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  23. \nODIN Her violent appetites grew beyond my control. I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away. She draws her strength from Asgard...and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless. \nTHOR Whatever she is, we can stop her. We can face her together. \nODIN (takes Thor's hand) No we won't. I'm on a different path now. This you must face alone. \nOdin looks into Thor's eyes, struggling to breathe. \nODIN (CONT'D) I love you my sons. \nFor the briefest of instances, father and sons share a quiet moment together. Tears well in Thor's eyes. \nODIN (CONT'D) Look at that. \nEthereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean. \nODIN (CONT'D) Remember this place. Home. \nA warm glow washes over Thor's face and he turns to see that- \n-ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST.   THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED. \nA moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin. \nHELA You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts. How would you like a job? \nHela looks out upon Asgard as Skurge rises behind her. \n24   EXT. ASGARD - THE MOUNTAINS - SAME                              24 \nA mysterious HOODED FIGURE watches Hela's arrival at the Observatory and begins a steady descent towards the city. \n25   EXT. SAKAAR - THE WASTELAND SHORE - DAY                         25 \nSUPER WIDE: A sky full of WORMHOLES. Thor, only a spec at this distance, SHOOTS out of one of these wormholes. He HITS the surface, causing a CLOUD of dust. \nFind Thor on his back surrounded by strange colorful space wreckage. Looking up, Thor sees a large metal object falling from a different wormhole! He rolls out of the way. THUD! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    27. \nThor runs up a dune to get away from the shower of debris. \nThor reaches the top of the dune and finds himself looking down on A BEACH in a strange WASTELAND. Camera scans a filthy dune littered with SPACE JUNK. \nOut across the OCEAN he notices A NIGHTMARE WORMHOLE - a giant open cylinder of whirling smoke and lightning storms. \nA loud noise draws Thor's attention to a HUGE RECTANGULAR \"SCRAPPER\" SHIP hauling a crashed SPACE VESSEL out of the water. Beneath the ship are various SCRAPPERS, masked humanoids. The ship is BLASTING WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC. \nA Scrapper notices Thor, then signals to his crew. \nLEAD SCRAPPER Are you a fighter or are you food? \nTHOR I'm just passing through. \nLEAD SCRAPPER It is food. On your knees. \nThor reaches out to summon Mjolnir.    A reflex.   Nothing. \nThe LEAD SCRAPPER levels a MAGNO-RIFLE at Thor and WHAP! A solid metal projectile KNOCKS Thor flat on his back. More Scrappers attack, throwing nets and firing more projectiles. Thor tries to swat them away but they keep coming. The rest of the scrappers move in with iron bats and clubs. \nWHOOSH! A second ship arrives, landing nearby. It's cool, sleek, and dangerous, deserving of its name: WARSONG. It is also BLASTING DIFFERENT WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC. \nThe FRONT of Warsong FLIPS OPEN and a GANGPLANK extends down to the ground. The scrappers stop and stare as we TRACK IN to a HERO REVEAL of SCRAPPER #142 (S142 for short) - a beautiful and ruthless asskicker. \nS142 lifts a half-empty bottle to her lips and CHUGS it. She finishes the bottle and smashes it on the side of her ship. \nSCRAPPER #142 He's MINE. \nShe walks down the gangplank... before veering off course and FALLING straight off into a pile of TRASH. She's PLASTERED. \nThe Scrappers shrug and start hauling Thor away. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 28. \nSCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D) Wait! \nS142 staggers to her feet, takes a deep breath. She holds on to a piece of junk as support - some dead beast. Thor continues to struggle with his captors, tangled in nets. \nSCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D) Wait! He's mine. So if you want him, you go through me. \nThe Scrappers start brandishing their weapons. \nSCRAPPER But we've already got him. \nS142 CLANGS her metal gauntlets together which activate. \nSCRAPPER #142 Alright then I guess I go through you. \nLEAD SCRAPPER More food. \nShe holds out her fists as if she's operating machinery... \n...Warsong WHIRS to life. S142 clenches her fists and we hear a horrible SCREECHING NOISE as Warsong OPENS FIRE. \nShe sweeps her arms out in an arc, the spray of gunfire lasting THREE SECONDS. She bangs her fists again, sending the ship into IDLE MODE. The Scrappers are now little more than tiny pieces of litter covering the beach. \nThor is fixated on this beautiful murderer approaching. One final HUGE Scrapper comes at her with a bat. S142 casually GRABS this Scrapper and HURLS him up into the air behind her. \nTHOR Thank you. \nFrom her belt S142 FLICKS a small glowing disc which LODGES into Thor's NECK. Far in the background, the Scrapper she threw finally HITS the ground with a loud THUD. \nShe holds up a fob device and presses the button - the disc blinks and Thor is filled with the pain of a thousand screaming squirrels. He hits the ground, stunned. \nS142 DRAGS Thor towards her ship. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   29. \n30   INT. WARSONG SHIP - DAY                                          30 \nThor's face SMUSHED up against glass.   His eyes are open. \nThor's POV - THE CAPITAL - an eclectic city composed of salvaged items from all over the universe. \nThor is lying in a sort of small GLASS HOLDING CELL beneath Warsong's COCKPIT. He looks up to see S142 piloting the ship. \nThor's eyes lock in on her belt, specifically the fob device she used to activate the Obedience Disk/debilitate him. \nSCRAPPER #142 This is Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss. I've got something special. \nTHOR Hey!   Where are you taking me? \nS142 ignores him, takes a swig from the bottle, and then nonchalantly UNCLIPS the fob from her belt. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard. \nSCRAPPER #142 Many apologies, your majesty. \nS142 ZAPS him and guides her ship towards a COLOSSAL TOWER. \n26   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ASGARD - DAY                                   26 \nCLOSE ON: Hela, headdress retracted, hair down, her beautiful face fully visible. We do not see who she is talking to. \nSuddenly Thor is somewhere else, surrounded weirdos and insanely dressed palace guards. \nHis scream dies down self-consciously. \nA musical beat PLAYS in the background. \nTHE GRANDMASTER, a tall mysterious man in golden robes. He is looking right at us. He doesn't know what to make of us. He's curious, thrilled, revolted, and titillated. \nPulling back we see TOPAZ, his trusty guard, at his side. Two GOLDEN LADIES loiter off to the side. Other strange guests can be seen in the background. Grandmaster just stares. \nS142 stands beside Grandmaster.    Finally: \nGRANDMASTER He's wonderful. (then:) It is a he? \nReveal S142 standing beside Thor. \nSCRAPPER #142 It's a he. \nGRANDMASTER Yeah. I love when you come to visit 142, you bring me the best stuff. (to Topaz:) Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142...what do I always say? \"She is the...\" and it starts with a B. \nTOPAZ Trash. \nGRANDMASTER No, not trash. Were you waiting just to call her that? It doesn't start with a \"B.\" \nTOPAZ Booze hag. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  34. \nGRANDMASTER I'm so sorry. No, \"best.\" I was thinking about \"best.\" (to S142:) Because I always say you're the best. She brought me my precious beloved Champion, you know. \nTOPAZ You say that every time she's here. \nGRANDMASTER What have you brought today?    Tell me. \nSCRAPPER #142 A contender. \nTHOR A what? \nGRANDMASTER I need to go closer. I want a closer look at this. Can you take us closer? Thank you. \nGrandmaster advances on Thor.    Examining him closely and strangely. Then: \nGRANDMASTER (CONT'D) Pay this lady. \nTHOR Just wait a damn minute.    I'm not for sale. \nUsing all his might, Thor breaks out of his shackles, but- \n-S142 ZAPS him again.    Paralyzed by superheated veins. \nGRANDMASTER Man.   He is a fighter. \nSCRAPPER #142 I'd take 10 million. \nTOPAZ Tell her she's dreaming. \nGRANDMASTER For heaven's sake, transfer the units. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   35. \nTopaz transfers S142 the units. Without sympathy or ceremony, S142 exits. \nTHOR You'll pay for this! \nSCRAPPER #142 No, I got paid for this. \nThor claws at the obedience disk, trying to RIP IT OUT. \nHe gets some separation from his skin, but the disk is causing him even more pain. Thor eventually has to let go. Grandmaster holds up HIS OWN fob device and uses it like a wand to guide Thor's HOVER CHAIR, which follows Grandmaster around as he speaks. \nGRANDMASTER Here's what I wanna know.    Who are you? \nTHOR I am the God of THUNDER!!! \nThor THRUSTS his arms into the air but only a tiny bit of static electricity POPS within Thor's hands. \nGRANDMASTER Wow. I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your fingers, was that like...sparkles? \nTOPAZ We located your cousin. \nGRANDMASTER Oh good! (to Thor:) Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna like this. \nGrandmaster moves Thor's chair to another section where- \n-COUSIN CARLO is waiting. He's strapped to a chair like Thor, and he is terrified. \nGRANDMASTER (CONT'D) There he is. Hey, cuz. We almost couldn't find you. What, have you been hiding? \nCousin Carlo looks at Thor, cowering in fear. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   36. \nTHOR Hi. \nCarlo only further weeps. \nGRANDMASTER So... \nCOUSIN CARLO Please.   I'm sorry. \nGRANDMASTER Carlo... I pardon you. \nCOUSIN CARLO Thank you.     Thank you. \nGRANDMASTER You're officially pardoned...from life. \nGrandmaster casually takes Topaz's Sakaarian Guard staff and JABS it into his cousin's mid-section- \n-CAUSING ALL OF HIS FLESH TO MELT OFF HIS SKELETON! \nTHOR Fine. Then point me in the direction of whoever's ass I have to kick. \nGRANDMASTER That's what I call, contender! Direction would be this way, Lord. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                40. \nTHOR Loki! \nGuards arrive.    They haul Thor up and escort him out. \n33   OMITTED                                                         33 \n34   INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - NIGHT                        34 \nThor is shoved into a spacious cell where other alien prisoners are lurking in the back. \nThe thick cell door SLAMS SHUT behind Thor. Thor gets up and immediately begins THROWING his shoulder into the door. The door doesn't budge, not even a little. \nBehind him, KORG, a hulking Kronan rock alien, speaks up. \nKORG Hey! Take it easy man! (Thor looks back) Over here. The pile of rocks waving at you. Yeah I'm actually a thing, I'm a being. Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here. I'm made of rocks, as you can see, but don't let that intimidate you. You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors. (GIGGLES to himself) Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you. This is my very good friend over here, Miek. He's an insect and has knives for hands. \nMIEK, a slug alien inside a robot exoskeleton, says hello by doing some karate moves. \nTHOR You're a Kronan, aren't you? \nKORG That I am. \nTHOR How'd you end up in here? \nKORG Well, I tried to start a revolution but didn't print enough pamphlets, so hardly anyone turned up. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                41. \nKORG (CONT'D) Except for my mom and her boyfriiend, who I hate. As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator. Bit of a promotional disaster. (secretive) But I'm actually organizing another revolution. I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that. Do you reckon you'd be interested? \nThor tries to run ahead down the circle and loops back around behind Korg. \nTHOR How did you... \nKORG Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle. But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle. \nTHOR This doesn't make any sense. \nKORG No, nothing makes sense here. The only thing that does make sense, is that nothing makes sense. \nTHOR Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's Champion? \nKORG Doug has. Doug! (realizes) Oh, right, Doug's dead. That's right. Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes. \nTHOR What about you? You're made of rocks. \nKORG Perishable rocks. (a pebble FALLS OFF) There you go. Another one gone. Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights, warm up the crowd and whatnot. Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  42. \nTHOR Yes I am. Fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place. \nKORG That's exactly what Doug used to say. See you later, new Doug. \nKorg walks away and approaches Miek. \nA35   EXT. ASGARD - STREETS - SUNSET                                    A35 \nThe streets of Asgard are cold and silent, save for the occasional distant sounds and screams of a city under siege. \n35    OMITTED                                                           35 \nA36   INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     A36 \nMoving down the throne room corridor we see- \n-SEVERAL DEAD EINHERJAR GUARDS. \nOne guy is still alive, desperately trying to crawl away. \nSHLNK!    A black blade finishes him off. \nReveal HELA and SKURGE looking down at the carnage. \nHela directs her attention to FRESCOS ON THE CEILING. Like the Sistine Chapel, except these depict Asgard's shining influence on the Nine Realms. Bountiful harvests, shepherds with full flocks, common folk throwing parades for Asgard's army, etc. \nHELA Does no one remember me? (awaiting an answer) Has no one been taught our history? Look at these lies. Goblets and garden parties? Peace treaties? \nHela leads them towards the throne. \nHELA (CONT'D) Odin... proud to have it... ashamed of how he got it. \nHela FIRES SPIKES into the ceiling, RIPPING DOWN plaster. \nBeneath the surface are older Frescos.      These ones are far more dark and sinister. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16              43. \nSoldiers in battle. Blood. A giant war wolf.     Young Odin and young Hela. Slaves building the palace. \nSkurge is at least somewhat disturbed by this. \nHELA (CONT'D) We were unstoppable. I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard's empire. One by one, the realms became ours. \nHela turns from the murals to address Skurge. \nHELA (CONT'D) But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his...he banished me, caged me, locked me away like an animal. Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored, their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very place. \nHela beckons Skurge to follow her. \nB36   INT. ODIN'S VAULT - CONTINUOUS                                  B36 \nHela enters the vault and descends the stairs towards the magical items. \nSKURGE Odin's treasures. \nNow out of stones, Thor looks around the floor for more. \nLOKI (CONT'D) Say something! \nThor finally looks right at Loki, speaks fast and curt: \nTHOR What would you like me to say? You faked your own death, you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranded him on Earth... (on Loki:) -to die, releasing the Goddess of Death. (back to Thor:) (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 47. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Have I said enough, or do you do you want me to go further back than the past two days? \nLoki's eyes burn.   Thor stares coldly at him.   Loki tries to compose himself. \nLOKI You know, I haven't seen this Beloved Champion he talks of, but I've heard he's astonishingly savage. I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow. Don't let me down. \nLoki SHIMMERS, and his illusion vanishes.   Korg runs in to try to kick him. \nKORG Piss off, ghost! (then:) He's freaking gone. \n40   INT. THE ARENA - RECEIVING AREA                                  40 \nThor, Korg, and a gaggle of other prisoners/fighters have been led from their cells to a PRE-FIGHT HOLDING AREA. \nKorg and Thor are by the weapons rack. \nKORG Yuck! There's Still someone's hair and blood all over this. Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight? Disgusting slobs. (then:) Thor...wanna use a big wooden fork? \nTHOR No. \nKORG Yeah, not really useful unless you're fighting off three vampires that were huddled together. \nTHOR I really wish I had my hammer. \nKORG Hammer? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                48. \nTHOR Quite unique. It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star. And when I spun it really, really fast it gave me the ability to fly. \nKORG You rode a hammer? \nTHOR No, I didn't ride the hammer. \nKORG The hammer rode you on your back? \nTHOR No. I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the... \nKORG Oh my God.     The hammer pulled you off? \nTHOR The ground. It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly. Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me. \nKORG Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship wiht this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one. \nTHOR That's a nice way of putting it. \nThor spots S142 dealing at the bar.    He's once again eyeing the fob device clipped to her belt.    Scowls. \nSCRAPPER #142 I said they're mine. \nTHOR See her, the one that put me in here. \nKORG Yeah, Scrapper 142. She's strong. And she drinks a lot. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16             49. \nKORG (CONT'D) Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man. They are hard to perish. \nTHOR Asgardian? \nThor breaks away from the line and runs to S142. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Hey!   Hey! \nS142 holds up the fob. \nTHOR (CONT'D) Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk. Asgard is in danger. \nThor then notices a series of PATTERNED SCARS, or BRANDS, on her forearms. It's a moment of recognition and disbelief. \nTHOR (CONT'D) My God, you're a Valkyrie. I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger...until I found out that you were all women. There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women. Sometimes a little too much. Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation. I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors. It's about time. \nSCRAPPER #142 Are you done? \nWARDEN (O.S.) Lord of Thunder, you're up. \nTHOR Please, help me.     I need your help. \nSCRAPPER #142 Bye. \nTHOR Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward because the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne. \nS142 finally turns her attention to Thor, intense. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 50. \nSCRAPPER #142 Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard. And I'm a scrapper, not a Valkyrie. \nGuards swarm Thor, dragging him back \nWARDEN (O.S.) Bring him in for processing! \nVALKYRIE And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway. \nDespite her denial, Thor has clearly hit a nerve. And from now on we will refer to Scrapper #142 as VALKYRIE. \nValkyrie takes her booze and walks away. Thor is dragged away, passing Korg and the other prisoners. \n40A   INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY                                        40A \nThor is strapped to a chair. Reveal a weird alien BARBER (Stan Lee cameo) holding up some rusty shears. \nTHOR Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low. \nHulk takes off his helmet.   Scowling.   Teeth GRINDING. \nTHOR (CONT'D) That's it. The sun's going down. I won't hurt you anymore. No one will. \nWHOOSH! Thor is suddenly dragged out of frame. Hulk has Thor by the leg and is WHIPPING him against the arena floor. Over and over and over again. \nIN THE VIP BOX: Loki's whole mood shifts. The joy returns to his face, like \"everything will be alright!\" Loki LAUGHS. \nLOKI Yes! That's how it feels! (to Grandmaster:) I'm just a huge fan of the sport. \nThor is SMASHED into the floor face first. \nHulk ROARS and RUSHES Thor with his axe. \nTHOR All right. Screw it. \nCLANG! The giant weapons CLASH! Now Thor and Hulk are fighting warhammer versus battleaxe... \n...and Thor is winning! He's getting the better of these exchanges, using Hulk's aggression against him. Thor continually KNOCKS and/or TRIPS Hulk off his feet while evading all of Hulk's best attacks. \nTHOR (CONT'D) I know you're in there, Banner. I'll get you out! \nOne particular vicious blow DISARMS Hulk, and Thor BREAKS Hulk's axe with the warhammer. Thor then BASHES Hulk in the chest, KNOCKING him to the ground. \nTHOR (CONT'D) What's the matter with you? You're embarrassing me! I told them we were friends! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   55. \nGROWLING, Hulk stands up and HITS Thor with a straight jab that sends Thor TUMBLING across the arena. Hulk immediately LEAPS after him and LANDS ON Thor! \nHulk is now on top of Thor as they slide across the arena, just PUMMELING him with punches. Left-right-left-right. Thor's head snaps back and forth. \nIn the carnage, Thor sees VISIONS OF ODIN.   Then- \n-his eyes GLOW WHITE WITH ELECTRICITY. Like an instinctual defense mechanism, Thor suddenly KNOCKS HULK BACK WITH A BURST OF LIGHTNING! \nSeething with electricity, Thor springs to his feet and then BLASTS HULK WITH A MASSIVE LIGHTNING PUNCH! Hulk is LAUNCHED BACKWARDS and Thor hits the ground HARD. \nCROWD Thunder! Thunder! Thunder! \nKORG Thunder! Thunder! Thunder! \nThe crowd gets hushed.   They've never seen this before. \nIN THE VIP BOX: Grandmaster is pissed.   Loki is amazed. \nHulk and Thor stagger to their feet. Thor looks at himself, a little surprised. There are still small charges of lightning CRACKLING through his veins. \nMeanwhile, Hulk RUMBLES towards Thor and they're at it again, close-quarters boxing. Thor is winning the exchanges, landing BRUTAL PUNCHES to Hulk's body. And then suddenly- \n-BZZZ! The Grandmaster ZAPS him with the Obedience Disk fob! Thor drops, totally caught off guard! \nHulk plants his feet and JUMPS! He ZOOMS UP, rocketing out of the arena, up-up-up into the sky! At the apex of his jump Hulk clenches his fist and begins a missile-like descent. \nVal sees this from her ship and decides to take off, like \"This fight is over, time to beat traffic.\" \nKORG (CONT'D) Another day, another Doug. \nDown below, Thor groggily turns over. He does so just in time to see Hulk coming at him like an atom bomb! \nNo time to avoid it. KA-BOOM!!! Right before impact Thor's eyes go lightning white. Hulk HITS Thor like a meteor. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  56. \nThe impact knocks Thor unconscious and we CUT TO BLACK. Linger on darkness for a few beats...and then: \n36   INT. THRONE ROOM - SUNSET                                       36 \nHela sits on the throne trying to get comfortable, headdress & cowl off. Skurge stands at the foot of the throne. \nHELA What is that noise? \nSKURGE The common folk aren't exactly falling in line. There's a resistance trying to knock down the front gates. \nHela sends her BUTCHER TROOPS to deal with it. \nHELA Tell me about yourself, Skurge. \nSKURGE Well, me dad was a stonemason, me mum was- \nHELA (interrupts) I'll just stop you there. What I meant was what is your ambition? \nSKURGE I just want a chance to prove myself. \nHELA Recognition. (then:) When I was young every great King had an executioner. Not just to execute people, but also to execute their vision. But mainly to execute people. Still a great honor. (beat) I was Odin's executioner. \nHela holds out her hand and uses her powers to FORM A DOUBLE- SIDED OBSIDIAN AXE, which she offers to Skurge. \nHELA (CONT'D) And you will be my executioner. Let's begin our conquest.

I'm getting us out of here. This is a terrible, awful place. You're gonna love Asgard. It's big. It's golden. Shiny. \nHulk sits on his bed, eating a pumpkin. \nHULK Hulk stay. \nTHOR No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard. We must prevent Ragnarok. \nHULK Rag-na-ruh? \nTHOR The prophesied death of my home world, the end of days, it's the end of- (Hulk's blank stare) If you help me get back to Asgard, I can help you get back to Earth. \nHULK Earth hate Hulk. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16     61. \nTHOR Earth loves Hulk. They love you. You're of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends. This is what friends do. They support each other. \nHULK You're Banner's friend. \nTHOR I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you. \nHULK Banner's friend. \nTHOR I don't even like Banner. (bad impersonation) \"I'm into numbers and science and stuff.\" \nHULK Thor go. Hulk Stay. \nTHOR Fine. Stay here. Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way. The red, the white. Just pick a color. \nThor heads for the exit, a wide open door. \nHULK Smash you. \nTHOR You didn't smash anything. I won that fight \nHULK I smashed you. \nTHOR Yeah, sure, sure. \nHULK Baby Arms. \nTHOR What? \nHULK Baby. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                       62. \nTHOR Moron!   You big child. \nThor heads to the open entrance.      Hulk smiles, anticipating. \nHULK Thor go! \nTHOR I am going. \nZAP! Thor's jolted back by the obedience disk.       There are perimeter sensors in the doorway. \nHulk CHUCKLES at Thor as he hits the floor.      Points. \nHULK Thor go again! (then:) Thor home. \nTIME CUT: \nThor slumps against the wall, head sagging. \nHulk grabs his giant battleaxe.       He's armored up. \nHULK (CONT'D) Hulk trains. \nTHOR That's great. Have fun. \nHulk exits. Thor watches him go. Then, at the end of the hallway Hulk meets up with Valkyrie! They begin play- fighting, a clearly friendly rapport. \nThor can't believe it. He runs to the entrance, but by the time he reaches the perimeter sensors they are gone. \nThor sighs. Walks over to the window. Looks up through a wormhole, stars twinkling on the other end of it. \nTHOR (CONT'D) A57               Heimdall, I know you can see me.

STREETS OF ASGARD - SAME                                    AA57 \nThor suddenly finds himself in Asgard. Disoriented at first, Thor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows. \nHeimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get up against the wall. Thor complies. Sees the refugees. \nAfter a beat a roving patrol of Hela's Butchers creep by through the street. They don't spot our heroes. Pause. \nHeimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers. \nHEIMDALL I see you. But you are far away. \nTHOR What's going on here? \nHEIMDALL Come see for yourself. \nWithout warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alley and DASHES down the street. Thor follows... \nQUINJET (V.O.) Access denied. \nTHOR Damn you, Stark. (rolls his eyes) Point Break. \nQUINJET (V.O.) Welcome, Point Break. \nCAH-RUNCH! Hulk BARGES IN through the Quinjet door! \nThe Hulk approaches, scowling. Any metal that stands in his way PEELS BACK. Frantic, Thor turns to the Quinjet's console. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16              73. \nHULK Friend stay! \nTHOR No, no, no! \nAs Hulk enters, he DESTROYS the hull of the Quinjet. \nHULK Stay! \nTHOR Stop! Stop breaking everything! \nHULK Don't go! \nThor triggers a message on the flight console. \nNATASHA (V.O.) Nice work, big guy. We don't know where Ultron's headed, but you're going very high, very fast. \nHulk stops short.    His whole demeanor changes. \nThor steps out of the way so that Hulk can see a recorded message from NATASHA ROMANOFF on the console. \nNATASHA (V.O.) ...So, I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode... \nHulk is now right up against the console screen. \nNATASHA (V.O.) ...So I need you to help me out. Okay? I need you to... \nHULK No!     No, Banner! \nHulk CONVULSES. Drops to his hands and knees. His whole body warping. Hulk ROARS and GRABS at his face, SHAKING his head, trying to fight this back. But he can't help it... \n...HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER! The transition is rough and chaotic, it's as if Banner is fighting to get out of the Hulk. Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES back and forth, further WRECKING the Quinjet. \nAnd then, calm. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 74. \nThor rushes to Banner's side to help ease the transition. \nTHOR Banner. Hey, hey, hey. You all right, Banner? Sun's going down. Sun's going down. That's it, breathe. I won't hurt you. Sun's going down. \nBANNER ...Thor? \nTHOR Yeah. \nBanner is groggy, disoriented. Thoughts, memories, and observations begin to flood his brain randomly. \nBANNER What happened to your hair? \nTHOR Some creepy old man cut it off. \nBANNER It looks good. \nTHOR Thanks. \nBANNER Where are we? How's Nat? \nTHOR Nat is good, I'm sure. \nBANNER And what about Sokovia? \nTHOR Sokovia? \nBANNER The city, Sokovia.   Did we save it? \nTHOR Banner, listen. \nBANNER What? \nTHOR Sokovia. Ultron.     That was two years ago. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                75. \nBANNER What are you saying? I've been Hulk for two years? \nTHOR I'm afraid so. \nBanner's eyes BULGE.    Trying to process this information. \nBANNER What the hell happened? \nBanner rushes to his feet.      Thor follows. \nTHOR Banner, there's something you should know... \nBanner goes to the flight console. \nQUINJET (V.O.) Voice Activation required. \nBANNER Banner. \nQUINJET (V.O.) Welccome, Strongest Avenger. \nTHOR (puzzled) What? \nBANNER Ship's log... \nTHE SHIP'S LOG POPS UP ON SCREEN. \nTHOR He's a friend. \nBANNER Who?    Me?

Sakaaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day. \nTHOR I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was going to kill you. \nVALKYRIE I don't plan to stop drinking, but I don't want to forget. I can't turn away anymore. So, if I'm donna to die, well... it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag. \nTHOR Good. \nThey arrive at a door.     Before they enter: \nVALKYRIE Yeah. So I'm saying that I wanna be on the team. Has it got a name? \nTHOR Yeah, it's called the Revengers. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               87. \nVALKYRIE Revengers? \nTHOR Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge. (to Banner:) Do you want revenge? \nBANNER I'm undecided. \nTHOR Okay. \nVALKYRIE Also, I've got a peace offering. \n73   INT. VALKYRIE'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 73 \nValkyrie opens the front door, revealing- \n-Loki! He is as restrained as anyone could be, sitting in the middle of the apartment with a dozen chains around him. \nLOKIE Surprise. \nThor TOSSES a bottle.    It BOUNCES off of Loki's head. \nLOKI OW! \nTHOR Just had to be sure. \nLOKI Hello, Bruce. \nBANNER So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody. Where are you at these days? \nLOKI It varies from moment to moment. \nVal's apartment is a shithole. Bottles everywhere, blood- spattered clothes in the corner, a knife in the wall, etc. \nBanner gives Thor a look like \"she might be crazy.\"   Thor responds with a \"No, she's cool\" gesture. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                88. \nVal lays something on the bed. Unwraps it to reveal AN OLD ASGARDIAN SWORD. Thor's eyes go wide as she sharpens it. \nTHOR Is that... a Dragonfang? \nVALKYRIE It is. \nTHOR My God. This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie. \nVALKYRIE Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems. Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits. \nA nice clean wormhole outside the city. \nVALKYRIE (CONT'D) Refuel on Xandar and be back in Asgard in around 18 months. \nTHOR Nope. We're going through that one. \nThor points at the nightmare tornado wormhole over the ocean. \nVALKYRIE The Devil's Anus? \nBANNER Wait, whose anus are we going through? \nTHOR For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it. \nBANNER That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein- Rosen Bridge. \nVALKYRIE We need another ship.   That would tear mine to pieces. \nTHOR She's right. We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity.

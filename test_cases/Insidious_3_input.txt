She can see him. 
ELISE (SOFTLY) Now you are free. (BEAT) Keep your guide, and a steady stride...and into The Further you go. 
She turns back to the Josh in the chair. The room seems to have darkened even more somehow. 
Josh turns and glares into the darkness of his hallway as it yawns outwards, eventually swallowed by complete blackness. 
He is not in another world. He is in his own house. 
NOTE - The following scenes are not going to be "movie quiet". They will be inhumanly quiet. There will no score. Only sound scape. This is another world and should feel so. 
Josh moves forward, gliding down the hall slowly. He looks down and sees that his feet are slighty raised off the ground. 
He is floating. 
He moves into the darkness of the hall...past the bedroom doors and closet doors. 
As he floats past, he scans every darkened corner for the slightest trace of movement. 
He reaches the front door. He moves towards it and as he does it OPENS. 
EXT. THE FURTHER - NOT NIGHT OR DAY, BUT DARK 
His street beckons beyond the door. 
Josh floats across his lawn. 
There are no people or cars on the street...it is as desolate as a post-apocalyptic wasteland. A TOTAL ABSENCE OF LIFE. 
Some lights flicker from within the houses, but no movement or signs of human forms. Only mist. 
Josh floats an inch above the road, moving down the street. 
One thing to notice is that there is a total lack of horizon or city scape here...Josh's immediate surroundings are visible for about one hundred yards or so...anything beyond that, in any direction, fades into blackness. As if someone were shining a giant spotlight down on him. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD 
Renai watches Josh. He is completely still...in a trance. 
His eyelids flutter as his eyeballs probe in all directions underneath. 
ELISE He's in... 
EXT. THE FURTHER - NIGHT 
Josh keeps moving, his fear registering, even in this world. 
He looks down at his feet. 
He is frustrated that he can't move any faster. He concentrates with fierce intensity-- 
--and then watches as his feet touch the ground. 
He is walking. 
He starts to move faster, gaining control of his movement. 
JOSH Dalton? 
The sound of his voice is strangely dead - as if he were inside a soundproof recording studio. There are no walls or angles for it to bounce off. 
JOSH (CONT'D) Dalton? Where are you? 
For a long time, there is nothing... 
...then he sees it. 
A figure...shrouded in shadow. Standing on the street corner with his back to Josh. 
Josh moves towards the figure. 
Closer. Closer. 
The man abruptly turns the corner without looking back. 
Josh glances around the corner. There is nobody there. 
He continues down the street. He sees a little girl. Far in the distance, but close enough to focus on. She stands and stares... 
...then turns and walks away. Gone...like an apparition. 
He looks to his right and sees-- 
--A SHADOW. 
Behind a curtain in one of the windows, back lit by candle light. As with the others, the shadow turns away and disappears.

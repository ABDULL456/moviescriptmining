{"test1_input": "INT. KITCHEN - MORNING. \nAs Denver runs into the kitchen, we hear: \nSETHE (OS) Won't you stay a little while? Can't nobody catch up on eighteen years in a day. \nDenver appears expectantly, down the white staircase that leads from the second floor. She looks at Paul wide eyed. They turn to her with gentle smiles; \nSETHE Baby, this here's Paul D. Garner...Paul, this is my Denver...Paul's the last of the Sweet Home men. \nDenver's heart sinks. \nPAUL Good morning Miss Denver. It's a pleasure. \nDENVER Good morning, Mr. D. \nPAUL Garner, baby. Paul D. Garner. \nDENVER Yes sir. \nPAUL Glad to get a look at you. Last time I saw your mama, you were pushing out the front of her dress. She's a fine looking young lady, Sethe. Fine looking. Got her daddy's sweet face. \nDENVER You knew my father? \nPAUL Knew him. Knew him well. \nSETHE Of course he did. I told you, he's from Sweet Home. Paul may stay with us a while. Won't that be nice, having an old friend stay a spell? \nBut Denver reacts with surprise and dismay. Paul is not her friend. Paul, right now, is more of an intruder. \nPAUL If that's all right with you, that is? \nDENVER We have a ghost here, you know. \nPAUL We met. But sad, your mama said. Not evil. \nDENVER No sir, not evil. But not sad either. \nPAUL What then? \nDENVER Lonely. \nSETHE I don't see how it could be lonely spending every minute with us like it does. \nDENVER It's my sister. She was just a baby when she died in this house. \nPAUL Reminds me of that headless bride back behind Sweet Home. Remember that Sethe? Used to roam them woods regular. \nDENVER (annoyed, resentful) Mama doesn't like talk about Sweet Home. Says it was never sweet and it sure wasn't home. \nSETHE Girl, mind yourself! \nPAUL Now, now, she got it right there, Sethe. \nSETHE But it's where we were. All together. It's where I met your father. And it comes back on us whether we want it to or not.... \nDENVER Then why don't you ever tell me about it? \nSethe pauses - unnerved and irritated by Denver's challenge. \nSETHE Denver, start up the stove. Paul must be hungry. \nPAUL Don't go to no trouble on my account. \nSETHE Bread's no trouble. The rest I brought back from where I work. Least I can do, cooking dawn to noon, is bring dinner home. You got any objections to pike? \nPAUL If he don't object to me I don't object to him. \nHe addresses his humor to Denver who offers no response. She crosses to the stove and works on lighting it. She's mad. \nDENVER Where's he going to sleep? Baby Sugg's room got no sheets or nothing. \nSETHE We'll figure it out. \nDENVER Maybe you should stay with mama, Mr. Garner. Then you two can talk about Sweet Home all night long. \nSETHE (explodes) What's the matter with you! I never knew you to behave like this! \nPAUL Leave her be, Sethe. I'm a stranger to her. \nSETHE That's just it. She got no cause to act up with a stranger. \nDenver collapses where she stands, sobbing out loud. Sethe moves to her. \nSETHE Baby, what is it? Did something happen? \nDenver moves away. Sethe registers this rejection. \nDENVER I can't no more! I can't no more! \nSETHE Can't what? What can't you? \nDENVER I can't live here! I don't know where to go or what to do but I can't live here. Nobody speaks to us. Nobody comes by. Nobody even knows I'm alive. \nPAUL What she talking about 'nobody speaks to you'? \nSETHE It's the house. People don't... \nDENVER It's not! It's not the house! It's us! It's you! SETHE Denver! \nPAUL Leave off, Sethe. It's hard for a young girl living in a haunted place. That can't be easy. \nSETHE (growing irritated) It's easier than some other things. Come here, baby.. \nDenver allows herself to be held. \nPAUL I'm a grown man with nothing new left to see or do and I'm telling you it' ain't easy. Maybe you oughta move. \nSETHE No! \nPAUL Sethe! \nSETHE No. No moving. No leaving. It's all right the way it is. \nPAUL You going to tell me it's all right with this child half out of her mind. \n", "test1_true": "Sethe's sudden outburst startles Paul. He watches as Sethe ushers Denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to quiet her down. \nAlone, Paul is disturbed by Sethe's words. He fishes out a pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it, searching for smoking papers he knows he doesn't have...waiting for Sethe to return. \nWhen she does, she heads straight for the stove. She spits on her finger and touches it to check it's heat. She then begins to make bread from flour, soda and salt - keeping her back to Paul throughout - as the scene continues; \nPAUL What tree, Sethe? \nSETHE Huh? \nPAUL What tree on your back? I don't see nothing growing on your back. \nSETHE It's there all the same. \nPAUL Who told you that? \nSETHE White girl. That's what she called it. I never seen it and never will. But she said that's what it looked like. A chokecherry tree. Leaves, branches. That was 18 years ago. Could have cherries by now for all I know... \nPAUL I don't follow. \nSethe pauses. Something in her decides to tell Paul D, although she keeps working on the bread to stay in control; \nSETHE I had milk, see. I was pregnant with Denver but I had milk for my baby girl that I sent ahead with the boys. I hadn't stopped nursing her when I sent her and the boys ahead of me. Anybody could smell me long before they saw me. Nothing I could do about it. All I knew is I had to get my milk to my little girl. Nobody was going to nurse her like me. Nobody was going to get it to her fast enough or take it away when she had enough..nobody knew she couldn't pass her air if you held her up on your shoulder, only if she was lying on your knee..Nobody knew that but me... \nPaul listens, half dreading where he thinks this story's going. \nPAUL We was talking about a tree, Sethe. \nSethe works faster. It is the work, taking an action - any action - that allows her tell the story numbly, without the pain of reliving it...without the images attacking \nSETHE Schoolteacher's boys drag me into the barn and took my milk... \n....yet, the images come anyway. \nINTERCUT: FLASHES OF MEMORY attack as SETHE TELLS HER STORY... \nJUMP CUT TO: \nINT. BARN - A NIGHT REMEMBERED. \n- Sethe being raped, beaten, held down by SCHOOLTEACHER'S BOYS in a barn with a loft... \nSETHE (IN KITCHEN) ..Held me down in that barn and took it. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nSethe screams and is smacked across the face. \nSETHE (IN KITCHEN) They were like boulders on me. Their hands over my mouth and on my shoulders and my legs. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nOne of the boys holds her face and mouth and head as the two others hold down her body and ravage her.... \nSETHE (IN KITCHEN) I couldn't move. Alls I could see was the loft above their heads. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nHer mouth covered, her head immobile - she stares up at the loft. \nEND OF MEMORY IMAGES. \nPAUL The loft? \nINT. KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY. \nSethe squeezes her eyes to erase the image and works harder on the biscuit dough...The flashes of IMAGES STOP... \nSETHE I told Mrs. Garner on them. She had that lump on her neck and couldn't speak but her eyes rolled out tears, I remember. Them boys found out I told on 'em and Schoolteacher made one open up my back, and when it closed it made a tree. \nPAUL They used cowhide on you? \nSETHE And they took my milk. \nPAUL They beat you and you was pregnant? \nSETHE And they took my milk! \nSethe has separated the dough into biscuits which she slips into the stove. As she rises, Paul steps gently behind her. He slowly caresses her breasts from behind, pressing his cheek against her back.. He rubs his cheek against it, feeling the scars beneath the dress. Raising his fingers to the hooks, as Sethe cries silently, he undoes her dress which slips down to her hips, exposing the sculpture her back has become. \nPAUL Aw Lord, girl. \nGrateful to have her body be someone else's responsibility for the moment, Sethe closes her eyes as Paul touches every ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth. The tenderness is almost unbearable. \nSuddenly, PAUL'S LEGS BEGIN TREMBLING. He pauses and looks down...He realizes it is not his legs that tremble, but rather; \nTHE FLOORBOARDS THEMSELVES ARE PITCHING, GRINDING, SHOVING the house from side to side. \nSethe slides to the floor, struggling with her dress. \nOn all fours, Denver crawls in from the keeping room as if trying to keep the house together. \nPaul, falling, reaching for an anchor, begins to shout; \nPAUL GOD DAMN IT! HUSH UP! Leave this place alone! Get the hell outta here! \nA table rushes at him but Paul grabs it's leg. Managing to stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch, he holds the table by two legs and bashes it about, wrecking everything, screaming at the house; \nPAUL YOU WANT TO FIGHT, COME ON! GOD DAMN IT! SHE GOT ENOUGH WITHOUT YOU! SHE GOT ENOUGH! \nThe quaking slows to an occasional lurch but Paul does not stop whipping the table around until everything it is absolutely still. He leans against the wall, panting. \nSethe is crouched by the stove. A mixed expression of relief and guilt - the expression of a mother whose disobedient child has been sent away. But a child she loves nonetheless. \nDenver looks frightened. More alone than ever, now that her one companion is gone. \nAll three are breathing together as if to the same beat, like one tired person. \nLAP DISSOLVE: \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY.. \nDenver walks through the broken furniture and dishes. At the stove, she ashes over the fire and pulls the pan of biscuits from the oven, \n", "test1_id": 384, "test2_input": "As Denver continues, Beloved steps towards her and begins to touch her face - examining her lips, her nose, her skin as if it were a rose to admire. Denver drinks in the attention, her heart expanding with love with every touch from this strange creature. \nDENVER ..and....and Bulgar...At night, we used to..crawl into bed together..I'd lay down on Bul's lap and Howard would tell us die- witch stories. He said they would protect us...And if I learned them, they would protect me if ever they were gone... \nEXT. PORCH - EARLY EVENING. \nEveryone is sitting on the porch after dinner. \nBeloved, looking strong and fit, eats a cane stick - gnawing at it to the flax, keeping the strings in her mouth long after the syrup had been sucked off. It makes Denver laugh, as she licks her cane stick. It makes Sethe smile, to see them both happy. \nIt makes Paul disgusted. \nINT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT. \nPaul confronts Sethe as she sews. \nPAUL You gonna just feed her, from now on? \nSETHE Denver likes her. She's no real trouble. \nPAUL But don't she have a home? Some place to go? \nSETHE Didn't mention one. I thought we'd wait until her breathing got better. She still sounds a little lumbar. \nPAUL She breathe like she can eat, she could blow this whole house down. And all those sweets. \nSETHE Sometimes the body needs that sugar for strength when it's trying to recover after an illness. \nPAUL But that's just it. She don't seem sick. Something funny about her. \nSETHE Funny? How? \nPAUL Acts sick, sounds sick but she don't look sick. Good skin, bright hands and strong as a bull. \nSETHE She can hardly walk without holding onto something. \nPAUL That's what I mean. Can't walk but I passed by Baby Sugg's room this morning and saw her lifting the rocker with one hand. \nSETHE You didn't? \nPAUL Don't tell me. Ask Denver. She was right there. \nAt that moment, Denver passes by on her way to the kitchen. \nSETHE Denver. Come in here a minute. \nDenver enters the keeping room. \nSETHE Paul says you saw Beloved pick up the rocking chair in Baby Suggs room with one hand. That so? \nDenver looks at Paul with a hard gaze; \nDENVER I didn't see no such thing. \nFrom Paul's expression we can tell Denver is lying...and whatever fragile connection they were building, is swiftly destroyed. \nINT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. \nSethe is getting ready for bed. Denver sticks her head in: \nDENVER Have you seen her? I can't find her. \nSETHE Who? \nDENVER Beloved. \nSethe shakes her head. Denver exits anxiously. The mentions of Beloved's name stir a MEMORY in Sethe: \nMEMORY: \nEXT. GRAVESTONE YARD - A DAY REMEMBERED. \nSethe talks to the HEADSTONE ENGRAVER as he works in the hot sun. His YOUNG SON helps him. \nSETHE She need a marker. Somethin' to tell me where she is. But I ain't got no money. \nThe Engraver eyes her body. \nENGRAVER What you got then? \nSethe is embarrassed by his lascivious tone, especially in front of the young boy. \nThe Engraver rises, takes a step toward Sethe and touches her hip, curling his hand around to her back. \nENGRAVER What you want it to say? \nSETHE I was thinking what the preacher say at the funeral. Dearly Beloved. \nENGRAVER (touching her) For ten minutes I give you one word for free. \nHis hand glides down to her buttocks. Sethe can't help but see the Young Boy watching the scene. \nEND of MEMORY. \nINT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. \nAs the memory starts to fade form her mind, Sethe suddenly feels someone else's presence. She looks up to find: \nBeloved standing by the door - watching her. \nSETHE Oh!...I didn't know you were there. \nBELOVED Can I help? \nSETHE Help what, honey? \nBeloved kneels before her on the floor and finishes buttoning up Sethe's night dress. \nBELOVED Where you go in the morning? \nSETHE Work. I work in a restaurant. \nBELOVED What time you go? \nSETHE Little after the sun come up. I like to make a loaf of bread before I go. How you feelin'? \n", "test2_true": "SETHE You remember your mother at all? \nBELOVED (scratching back of her head) I remember a woman who was mine and I remember bein snatched away from her. \nSethe, nods, understanding such things. She cautiously reaches out to stroke Beloved's face. Beloved responds like a puppy, pressing her cheek against Sethe's hand. Sethe is moved. \nINT. KITCHEN - PRE DAWN. \nSethe enters the kitchen to make bread before she leaves for work. She finds Beloved waiting for her, placing out her cooking things on the table. Beloved looks up and smiles. \nBELOVED I'm helpin make your bread. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE - EARLY EVENING. \nBeloved waits anxiously at the window for the sight of Sethe coming home from work.... \nWhen she sees her, she runs through the house, out the door to meet her. \nDenver appears at the door, upset by Beloved's loss of attention in her. \nEXT. PORCH - EVENING. \nC.U. - SETHE, as she leans her tired head against the porch, sitting on the step. She closes her eyes and is about to drift off, when; \nBELOVED'S HAND gently touches her shoulder, settling there. \nSethe looks up and smiles, patting her hand. Beloved stands above her as Denver takes a seat on the step. \nBeloved searches Sethe's eyes and asks; \nBELOVED Where your diamonds? \nThe question surprises Sethe...and startles Denver. \nSETHE Diamonds? What would I be doing with diamonds? \nBELOVED On your ears. \nSETHE Wish I did. (beat) Hmm..come to think of it, I had some crystal once. A present from Mrs. Garner - woman I worked for at Sweet Home. \nDENVER I never saw you with no earrings. \nSETHE Gone. Long gone. \nBELOVED Tell me...Tell me about your diamonds... \nSethe hesitates. Beloved kneels at her feet. \nDENVER (to Beloved) Ma'am don't talk about Sweet Home. \nBELOVED (ignoring her) Tell me...Tell me about your diamonds. \nDenver awaits her mother's reaction with great interest. Sethe looks at Beloved sweet, innocent expression and something in her resistance, eases: \nSETHE Well..this lady I worked for in Kentucky gave them to me when I got married.. \nDenver is both interested and slightly hurt at her mother's willingness to tell Beloved what she'd never tell her: \nSETHE ..What they called married back then. I remember going up to her in the kitchen to tell her. I'd help her make ink for Mr. Garner in the kitchen. I was fool enough to think I was going have some kind of ceremony...maybe even a new dress.. (CONTINUES AS WE CUT TO;) \nSethe's continues telling Beloved, an attentive audience... \nDenver, more attuned to Beloved's interest than the story, is disturbed at her mother's telling of it. \nINT. KITCHEN - ANOTHER EVENING. \nCamera moves up from the mended legs of the table Paul broke to; \nA suspicious Paul glares at Beloved as they eat dinner. \nBeloved is ever ready to pass Sethe a bowl or napkin or whatever she needs. She is \"shining\" - for Sethe, and for Sethe alone. \nDenver notices it as well. \nIt is raining outside. Both Denver and Beloved are wet from the rain. Denver's hair is all tangled. \nSETHE Best unbraid that hair. \nDENVER Tomorrow. \nSETHE Today's always here. Tomorrow never. \nDENVER It hurts. \nSETHE Comb it everyday, it won't.. \nBELOVED Your woman never fixed up your hair? \nAll three look to Beloved, puzzled by her question, which is clearly intended for Sethe. Paul's getting more annoyed. \nPAUL What? \nSETHE My woman?..You mean my mother? \nBeloved nods. Paul and Denver exchange a curious look. \nSETHE If she did I don't remember. I don't think I saw her but a few times. \nBELOVED Tell me 'bout her. \nPaul and Denver look to Sethe, waiting to see if she'll answer. \nSETHE ..I remember once, she picked me up and carried me behind the smokehouse... The only thing I do remember in fact... \nPaul is disturbed by Sethe's carefree storytelling - how it contradicts her words to him that first day and worried it will lead to no good... \nOnce again, Denver is surprised to hear what she's never heard before. She looks to Paul and knows what he is thinking. Paul looks back and knows Denver realizes it. But Denver returns his glance with a defensive dismissal of the eyes. \nSETHE ...She opened up her dress and right on her rib, right here, was a circle and a cross burnt right into the skin.... \nPAUL (interrupts her) Sethe. \nSETHE What? \n", "test2_id": 385, "test3_input": "PAUL Sethe, don't do this.. \nSETHE What a relief to just stop it all right there, huh?!! Close it shut! Squeeze that butter...But I had three children on their way to Ohio and nothing would have changed that! And you tell me he didn't leave me!! \nSethe exits O.S. Paul is left alone on the porch until Beloved runs out of the house giggling with Denver in pursuit. As Denver passes, Paul sarcastically remarks; \nPAUL Guess she's feeling better, huh? \nDenver gives him a quick, disdainful look, then continues after Beloved. \nThe two girls run towards the woods. \nEXT. BOXWOOD BUSH ROOM - NIGHT. \nBeloved is dancing beneath a bright moon. Denver is an attentive, grateful audience. \nDENVER Where'd you learn to dance? \nBELOVED Nowhere. Look at me do this! \nShe puts her fists on her hips and skips. \nBELOVED Now you! Come on! Come on! \nShe takes Denver's hand and places another on her shoulder. As they dance, Denver laughs harder and harder - a giddiness from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for Beloved's attention. \nThey spin and fall to the ground, like two lovers nestled. Beloved catches her breath as Denver asks; \nDENVER Why you call yourself Beloved? \nBELOVED In the dark my name is Beloved. \nDENVER What's it like where you were before? \nBELOVED (a thoughtful expression) Dark. I'm small in that place. I'm like this here. \nDENVER Were you cold? \nBELOVED Hot. Nothing to breathe there. No room to move. \nDENVER How did you get here? \nBELOVED I wait; then I got on the bridge. I stay there in the dark, in the daytime, in the dark in the daytime. Long time. \nDENVER All this time you were on the bridge? \nBELOVED No. After. When I got out. \nDENVER Why'd you come here? \nBELOVED To see her face. \nDENVER Ma'am's? Sethe's? \nBELOVED Yes. Sethe. \nAnd with that, Denver takes a breath of courage to ask the question she's been longing to ask: \nDENVER You my sister, ain't you? You really are. \nBeloved looks at her and smiles. They are so close she leans in curiously and - touching Denver's face - kisses her on the lips. \nDENVER You won't leave us, will you? \nBELOVED No. Never. This is where I am. \nDENVER I knew it. I knew. First time I saw you and you said your name. And when you touched me - real gentle. And familiar. Like I'd felt that touch before. \nSmiling, Beloved moves to touch Denver's cheek when suddenly, Denver sits up cross legged and urges Beloved; \nDENVER Don't tell mama. You musn't tell her who you really are. I don't know what she'd do! Please, you hear? \nSuddenly, Beloved's face turns to rage as she rises up as well; \nBELOVED Don't tell me what to do? Don't never tell me what to do!? \nDENVER But..but I'm on your side. I want to protect you... \nBELOVED (stands above Denver) She's the one! She's the one I need! You can go but she's the one I have to have! \nBeloved abruptly drops to her knees and crawls out the boxwood bush room as Denver's pleads; \nDENVER No. Beloved please! Don't go! I didn't do nothing! We were dancing! Don't go!.... \nINT. DENVER'S & BELOVED'S ROOM - DAWN THE FOLLOWING DAY. \nThe room is still dark from the night but the sun is rising outside. \nSuddenly, Beloved awakens with a start. She senses something. She rises and looks out the window to see; \nPOV; \nSETHE WALKING ACROSS THE FIELD. \nBeloved quickly grabs her clothes and exits to follow her, as Denver awakens just in time to see her go. \nEXT. WOODS EARLY MORNING. \nSethe is dressed as if for church as she makes her way through the woods with a specific destination in mind. \nSoon, she comes upon; \nEXT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - EARLY MORNING. \nSethe steps out of the woods and into an open clearing. A LARGE ROCK sits in the clearing like a pulpit above the pew's of grass and weeds. \nSethe remembers the place as it was... She hears the VOICES OF A CROWD...a gathering of people though the clearing remains empty. She crosses to the rock and sits. Camera moves up to reveal - \nMEMORY: \nBABY SUGGS, vital and strong, standing on the rock, preaching: \nBABY SUGGS I'm not here to tell you all to clean up your lives and sin no more....I'm not here to tell you we're the blessed meek and are glorybound!...I'm here to tell you that the only grace we can have, is the grace we can imagine...And if you cannot see it, then you shall not have it... \nEND OF MEMORY. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME. \nBeloved has found her and watches from a hidden place... \nCamera moves beyond her to find; \nDenver, having followed Beloved, watches her from a distance. \nEXT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - EARLY MORNING. \nSethe remembers Baby Suggs advice: \nBABY SUGGS (V.O.) ..God lead you home... So now, lay'em down, child. Sword and shield..Don't study war no more. Lay all that mess down. Sword and shield... \nSETHE Lay'em down...sword and shield. \nSethe weeps...She slides to the ground and holds her head to weep. She covers her head from God and cries AS SHE LETS THE MEMORIES COME..memories she can no longer fight from coming; \nCUT TO: \nSETHE'S MEMORIES; \nEXT. SWEET HOME - A NIGHT REMEMBERED. \nSETHE IS IN THE SAME BENT OVER POSITION only here, her back is exposed and she is being beaten by the Schoolteacher's boys. The BOY BEATING SETHE never stops with the whip for a second as he rants; \nBOY BEATING SETHE NIGGER TRASH..OPENING YOUR MOUTH... \nSECOND BOY YOU GONNA KILL HER! YOU BETTER STOP! \nBOY BEATING SETHE I'LL KILL HER ALL RIGHT...NEVER OPEN HER MOUTH 'BOUT ME AGIN.... \nThey beat her mercilessly. \nEXT. FIELD - NIGHT. \nSethe, tear stained, bloody and very pregnant fights her way through a corn field as she makes her escape.. \nHer dress hangs torn at the back - her wounds open and bleeding. Her feet already swollen and blistered. She is in agonizing pain. She moves like a figure in a nightmare. \nCUT TO: \nA SERIES OF IMAGES IN WHICH WE SEE SETHE STRUGGLING THROUGH DAYS AND NIGHTS OF WALKING AND HIDING, IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS AS SHE MAKES HER WAY ACROSS THE STATE. \nTHE FINAL IMAGE IS: \nEXT. ONION FIELD - DAY. \nSethe falls to the ground unable to move - her contractions have started and the pain is unbearable. \nHer breasts are leaking on her sweat stained body. Her legs are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs and rock. On her back, the tree is starting to form. \nShe lays there waiting for death. Until a VOICE ASKS: \nAMY (OS) WHO THAT BACK THERE! \nSethe can not answer as she hears TWO FEET moving through the field. She clutches her pregnant stomach as if somehow she might hide it from whoever might be coming to harm her. \nA RAGGEDLY LOOKING WHITE GIRL with arms like cane stalks and enough hair for five heads steps through into view. \nAMY Look there. A nigger. If that don't beat all... \nSethe can not speak for fear. \nAMY Man, you 'bout the scariest looking something I ever seen. What you doing back up here? \nSethe manages to control her breath and push out the word; \nSETHE Running. \nAmy looks at Sethe's swollen, bloody flesh at the end of her legs. \nAMY Them the feet you running on? My Jesus my... \nSETHE (semi-delerious) Am I in Ohio? \nAMY Ohio! Fool girl - you in Kentucky. You 'bout a thousand miles from Ohio. \nSETHE (murmurs to herself) I'm still in Kentucky. \nAMY You got anything on you, gal, pass for food? \nSETHE No, ma'am. \nAMY I like to die I'm so hungry. Thought there might be huckleberries. That's why I come up here. You having a baby? \nSETHE I expect this baby ma'am is gonna die in these wild onions. \nAmy doesn't know what to do with that information. So.. \nAMY Well, I got to eat something. \nAny stands and looks as if she's about to leave when Sethe, feeling the girl is safe, stops her with a question. \nSETHE Where you on your way to, miss? \nAMY (eager to tell) Boston. Get me some velvet. It's a store called Wilson. I seen pictures and they have the prettiest velvet. \nSETHE Boston - is that far? \nAMY Farther than Ohio. \nSETHE Must be velvet closer by. \nAMY Not like in Boston. Be so pretty on me. You ever touch velvet? Or even seen it? \nSETHE If I did, I didn't know it. What's it like? \nSethe desperately wants her to stay - to not be alone. Amy kneels back down to her, curious now; \nAMY What they call you? \nSETHE (lies) Lu. \n", "test3_id": 386}

{"train": "BELOVED \nWritten by \nRichard LaGravenese \nBased on the Novel by \nToni Morrison \nOctober 11, 1996 \nFADE IN... \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN. \nIt is winter in Ohio. A house sits isolated beside a barren field. The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant woods stops it. Around the back of the house stands a rundown STORAGE SHED, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. A porch with a single door serves as the only entrance. \nCamera begins a slow move toward the house as we; \nSUPER - OHIO, 1865 \nWE HEAR SOUNDS from inside the house - BUMPS, A CHAIR FALLING OVER...and FEET RUNNING on wooden floor boards. \nCUT TO: \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN. \nC.U. - THE HANDS OF TWO BROTHERS HOLDING EACH OTHER AS THEY RUN DOWN THE STAIRS.. \nBULGAR (13 yrs. old) and HOWARD (14 yrs. old) run down the steps from the second floor. They are fully dressed, carrying a small bag of belongings. \nHOWARD We gonna need food. Wait here. \nBulgar reluctantly lets go of Howard's hand as the latter runs into the kitchen. Alone, he edges towards the front door, when suddenly; \nTHE DOOR SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN on it's own. Scared, he steps away slowly. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAWN. \nHoward is trying to toss some food into a bag. He spots A CAKE sitting on top the wooden table, with some pieces already eaten. He finds a knife and approaches the table. \nHe is about to cut into the cake when he sees TWO TINY HAND PRINTS appear on the cake's surface. Howard stops cold - dropping the knife. \nINT. FRONT ENTRANCE - DAWN. \nHoward exits the kitchen and takes Bulgar's hand; \nHOWARD Come on! \nDENVER (OS) Bul? \nThe boys look up the stairs and see their baby sister, nine year old DENVER. \nDENVER Where you goin? \nThe brothers are brokenhearted at the sight of her. They love their sister. But there are stronger forces here. \nA MIRROR on a wall beside Howard cracks down the middle. \nHOWARD We gotta go! \nBulgar looks up to Denver. They exchange a look of deep affection and pained longing. He wants to take her. \nHOWARD Bye, Denver. You take care. \nDENVER Bye? Bul? \nBulgar is starting to cry. He rushes up the steps and hugs his sister. He kisses her hard then breaks away. Denver's outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs mid-air. \nDENVER No..Bul... \nBulgar flies down the steps and disappears out of the house holding Howard's hand once more. \nDenver sits alone at the top of the stairs.  She sadly looks up and weeps, as if to the house itself: \nDENVER Now what you go and do that for? \nEXT. ROAD TO THE TRAIN - DAWN. \nTHE VOICE OF SETHE HUMMING A MELODY carries over the images of: \nThe two boys running for their lives towards the train, holding hands all the way.  Howard is the first to reach it. As it passes by, he throws his bag upon it and jumps in. Bulgar races beside it as Howard reaches for him. \nC.U. - HOWARD'S HAND reaching for BULGAR's...They connect. \nWIDE SHOT - The boys are on the train as it leaves town. \nOn it's route, the train passes a ramshackle GRAVEYARD. \nCAMERA MOVES SLOWLY INTO THE GRAVEYARD until it reaches A HEADSTONE, made with flecked pink stone. Upon the headstone is only one word: \nBELOVED. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS. \nCamera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124, into a Close-Up of a WOMAN looking out of a second floor bedroom window. It is SETHE, mother of the two boys and Denver. She hums her melody, softly, sadly, with a resigned understanding of why her boys are running away...and a deep pain that is too constant to notice. \nFADE OUT; \nFADE IN: \nINT. 124 - BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY. \nBABY SUGGS, grandmother and mother-in-law to Sethe, sits in her bed fondling colored fabric of BRIGHT GREEN..It is the only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding. Suggs is bed-ridden, exhausted to her bones - her face a mosaic of suffering and sacrifice and tested faith. \nBABY SUGGS Ya know what I'd love to see? I loved to see me some lavender. You got any lavender? Or even pink - pink'll do. \nSethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser. She stops and checks her pockets for rags or swatches...She looks around the room.. \nSETHE No. Sorry. \nBABY SUGGS Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color. \nSuggs goes back to contemplating her green until; \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING. \nAs Denver runs into the kitchen, we hear: \nSETHE (OS) Won't you stay a little while? Can't nobody catch up on eighteen years in a day. \nDenver appears expectantly, down the white staircase that leads from the second floor. She looks at Paul wide eyed. They turn to her with gentle smiles; \nSETHE Baby, this here's Paul D. Garner...Paul, this is my Denver...Paul's the last of the Sweet Home men. \nDenver's heart sinks. \nPAUL Good morning Miss Denver. It's a pleasure. \nDENVER Good morning, Mr. D. \nPAUL Garner, baby. Paul D. Garner. \nDENVER Yes sir. \nPAUL Glad to get a look at you. Last time I saw your mama, you were pushing out the front of her dress. She's a fine looking young lady, Sethe. Fine looking. Got her daddy's sweet face. \nDENVER You knew my father? \nPAUL Knew him. Knew him well. \nSETHE Of course he did. I told you, he's from Sweet Home. Paul may stay with us a while. Won't that be nice, having an old friend stay a spell? \nBut Denver reacts with surprise and dismay. Paul is not her friend. Paul, right now, is more of an intruder. \nPAUL If that's all right with you, that is? \nDENVER We have a ghost here, you know. \nPAUL We met. But sad, your mama said. Not evil. \nDENVER No sir, not evil. But not sad either. \nPAUL What then? \nDENVER Lonely. \nSETHE I don't see how it could be lonely spending every minute with us like it does. \nDENVER It's my sister. She was just a baby when she died in this house. \nPAUL Reminds me of that headless bride back behind Sweet Home. Remember that Sethe? Used to roam them woods regular. \nDENVER (annoyed, resentful) Mama doesn't like talk about Sweet Home. Says it was never sweet and it sure wasn't home. \nSETHE Girl, mind yourself! \nPAUL Now, now, she got it right there, Sethe. \nSETHE But it's where we were. All together. It's where I met your father. And it comes back on us whether we want it to or not.... \nDENVER Then why don't you ever tell me about it? \nSethe pauses - unnerved and irritated by Denver's challenge. \nSETHE Denver, start up the stove. Paul must be hungry. \nPAUL Don't go to no trouble on my account. \nSETHE Bread's no trouble. The rest I brought back from where I work. Least I can do, cooking dawn to noon, is bring dinner home. You got any objections to pike? \nPAUL If he don't object to me I don't object to him. \nHe addresses his humor to Denver who offers no response. She crosses to the stove and works on lighting it. She's mad. \nDENVER Where's he going to sleep? Baby Sugg's room got no sheets or nothing. \nSETHE We'll figure it out. \nDENVER Maybe you should stay with mama, Mr. Garner. Then you two can talk about Sweet Home all night long. \nSETHE (explodes) What's the matter with you! I never knew you to behave like this! \nPAUL Leave her be, Sethe. I'm a stranger to her. \nSETHE That's just it. She got no cause to act up with a stranger. \nDenver collapses where she stands, sobbing out loud. Sethe moves to her. \nSETHE Baby, what is it? Did something happen? \nDenver moves away. Sethe registers this rejection. \nDENVER I can't no more! I can't no more! \nSETHE Can't what? What can't you? \nDENVER I can't live here! I don't know where to go or what to do but I can't live here. Nobody speaks to us. Nobody comes by. Nobody even knows I'm alive. \nPAUL What she talking about 'nobody speaks to you'? \nSETHE It's the house. People don't... \nDENVER It's not! It's not the house! It's us! It's you! SETHE Denver! \nPAUL Leave off, Sethe. It's hard for a young girl living in a haunted place. That can't be easy. \nSETHE (growing irritated) It's easier than some other things. Come here, baby.. \nDenver allows herself to be held. \nPAUL I'm a grown man with nothing new left to see or do and I'm telling you it' ain't easy. Maybe you oughta move. \nSETHE No! \nPAUL Sethe! \nSETHE No. No moving. No leaving. It's all right the way it is. \nPAUL You going to tell me it's all right with this child half out of her mind. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS. \nA shirtless Paul D. is by the water pump washing himself. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS. \nDenver lifts the fallen jelly cupboard, it's contents laying in a heap in the corner of the bottom shelf. She takes out a jar. She looks for a plate and finds half of one by the broken table. She picks it up as she hears Paul enter through the front door. \nINT. BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS. \nSethe prepares a bed for Paul. Baby Suggs quilt is on the bed. She hesitates whether or not to leave it there. \nPaul stands by the door with his shoes in his bands, his shirt hanging open down the front. \nSethe is surprised to see him there - she feels awkward. \nSETHE Why don't you...take a rest..I'll call you when we're ready. \nPAUL Sure you don't want me to help clean up? \nSETHE No..you'd just get in my way. Denver and me'll do it. \nThey stand in silence, looking at each other for a moment. The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny. Paul starts smiling. Sethe covers her mouth to conceal it. \nAnd then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and the fear they feel takes it's place. \nPaul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the floor. Sethe watches him. Paul crosses to her. He moves in to kiss her. They approach each other's lips like two burn victims, trying desperately not to hurt the other with their touch. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS. \nDenver sits on the porch steps, alone once again. Miserably eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate. \nINT. BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER. \nSethe and Paul lay in bed, after lovemaking. They are still fully clothed. The lovemaking was fast and finished quickly. Now, there is an awkwardness that is without humor or excitement - but sits like a chasm between them. \nAs Sethe lays there, SHE REMEMBERS: \nMEMORY: \nEXT. THE CORN FIELDS OF SWEET HOME - A DAY REMEMBERED. \nA brilliant bright yellow and green corn stalks in a tiny corn field. \nSethe and a slightly older HALLE - handsome, strong - run through the field until Halle stops them at an isolated spot. \nHALLE How's this? \nSETHE Here?! out in the open?! \nHALLE Look around - can you see anybody? \nSethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks. She shakes her head no. \nHALLE Then nothing can see us neither. \nHe takes off his shirt. Seethe giggles as she gets on the ground, keeping her ankles crossed. \nHalle lays her back and gently separates her legs. She giggles. Halle pauses before laying on top of her. \nHALLE You are a beautiful sight. \nSETHE Don't talk stupid. \nHALLE You're my wife now! I can talk as stupid as I like about you! (she giggles) I ain't never loved nothing like you before, Sethe. (Sethe is moved) And after I get mama out...then I get us out too. And you'll see, baby girl... (smiles) we're gonna have us a liiife.. \nHe sings the word \"life\", so that Sethe laughs. Then, Halle lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love. As camera pans up to a HILL above the field, we hear Sethe ask; \nSETHE (O.S.) You sure nobody can see? \nWe hear Halle grunt \"uh-huh\" as we arrive on the hill where a GREAT TREE sits. \nEXT. GREAT TREE ON THE HILL - DAY. \nBeneath the tree, PAUL D, SIXO and Paul's brothers Paul A. and Paul P. are pouring water over heads and watching; \nPOV; Unbeknownst to Halle and Sethe, their lovemaking is in clear view to anyone on the hill... \nPAUL A Damn. I don't get why she picked him. \nPAUL D Halle's got that way about him. That way a woman feels he's doing it all for her, not for himself at all. \nPAUL A I can't see nothing so special about Halle. \nPAUL F What about what he's doing for his mama? \nPAUL A Fool thing, if you ask me. By the time he buys it, freedom won't mean a thing to somebody that old and worn. \nSIXO Freedom mean something anytime it come. \nThe men watch the corn stalks swaying to the lovemaking. \nA YOUNG PAUL D., in particular, watches with tender yearning. \nINT. KITCHEN AT SWEET HOME - EARLY EVENING. \nMR. GARNER, the man who owns and runs Sweet Home. He offers cooked corn to the men. \nMR. GARNER Raccoon must've got into my corn. Damaged a few so, no use throwing them out... \nThe men looks to each other, suppressing a laugh. \nMR. GARNER Sethe, get the butter there. \nEveryone looks at each other as they thank No. Garner and begin to smear butter on their corn and eat. \nA NEIGHBORING FARMER visiting the Garner's cautions him; \nNEIGHBORING FARMER You spoil these nigger boys. \nGARNER Maybe you got boys on your farm. My nigger's are men. Not a boy among'em. Bought 'em thataway, raised'em thataway. \nNEIGHBORING FARMER Beg to differ Garner. Ain't no nigger men. \nGARNER Not if you scared. But if you a man yourself, you'll want your niggers to be men too. \nDENVER I do. Baby Suggs told me baby ghost would never hurt me. She was my sister. When I was little, after the boys left, I used to think that she and me both were waiting for daddy to come. And once he did, she wouldn't be mad no more. (Sethe listens sadly) \nThey hear Paul singing out on the porch. Denver grimaces. \nDENVER Wish he'd shut-up...He's ruined everything. \nSETHE No, he hasn't. He won't. (hesitates) He..he wants to takes us to the carnival next Thursday... \nDenver's eyes light up with excitement then caution. \nDENVER You mean, go out where they'll be other people? \nSETHE Dress up a little bit. Wear our hats. What do you think? \nDENVER (downplaying her excitement) Maybe.... \nSETHE Maybe...All right...all right. (difficult for her to say) Can I ask you something? (Denver nods, her back to Sethe) I was wondrin'..What you think about us...maybe... maybe thinking we could start...if we got an idea to, thinking we could start.. countin' on... (she stops) \nDENVER On what mama? Countin' on what? \nSethe can barely bring herself to say. To hope. To imagine. Paul? But, for Denver, she forces herself and whispers; SETHE Something. \nEXT. CARNIVAL - DAY. \nPaul and Sethe and Denver walk among the hundreds of black townspeople gathered for the carnival. \nA sign reads COLORED THURSDAY...TWO PENNIES ENTRANCE FEE. \nPaul is in high spirits. Saying hello to anyone whose eye he catches. Willing, eager to get anything for Denver she wants. Feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life. \nDenver is excited but worried. She doesn't want to like Paul but can't help the thrill she's feeling. And when one or two passersby shout out; \nVARIOUS PASSERS- BY Hey Denver!...Hi there Denver! \nDenver heart almost weeps with joy. \nSethe walks cautiously. Overdressed for the occasion, it is her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years. \nShe catches the eyes of some of the women she knows...ELLA and LADY JONES..good Christian women who nod in their acknowledgement yet are holding back something. A judgement? A repulsion? \nPaul doesn't notice them and for this Sethe is glad. \nMONTAGE of SCENES...the various carnival acts, all performed by a WHITE TROUPE; magic, clowning, fire swallowing, spitting ribbons, acrobats forming pyramids... \nOur trio take it all in like water to the thirsty. \nAt one point, A WHITE CARNIVAL BARKER shouts to the children; \nCARNIVAL BARKER All Pickaninnies free!! \nThe phrase stabs Sethe and Paul a bit. But Paul whispers; \nPAUL Two pennies and an insult well spent in my opinion to see the spectacle of whitefolks making a spectacle of themselves. \nSethe can't help but let out a small laugh - and with that laugh, a sudden sensation of relief... \nPaul buys Denver some licorice, peppermint and lemonade. Holding the lemonade for her, Paul asks; \nPAUL Mind if I take a sip? \nDenver agrees. Paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back to her. Denver, in spite of herself, is starting to like him. \nEND MONTAGE. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY. \nOur trio are leaving the carnival, walking three astride with distance in between each. The sunlight casts strong shadows. \nSethe's eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees; \nTHEIR THREE SHADOWS ARE HOLDING HANDS.....as they walk home. \nFADE OUT; \nFADE- IN. \nEXT. A STREAM AND THE BANK BESIDE IT - DAY. \nWIDE ANGLE of a BEAUTIFUL, WIDE STREAM (more like a small river) with a MULBERRY TREE standing tall on the bank before it. There is not a soul in sight as the stream moves gracefully beneath the sun. \nSUDDENLY; \nA FULLY DRESSED YOUNG BLACK WOMAN EMERGES FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM LIKE A GODDESS ARISING OUT OF SPIRITUAL WATERS... SHE WEARS A STRAW HATT A WHITE DRESS WITH BUTTONS, A LACE COLLAR AND NEW SHOES. SHE WALKS OUT OF THE WATER TO THE BANK. \nExhausted, sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from asthma, she sits, leaning against the mulberry tree. She seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck. Yet her skin is like new lineless and smooth. Glowing. \nAlthough racked with pain, SHE IS SMILING. Smiling the way travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long and arduous journey. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY. \nThe Young Black Woman makes her way through the woods. She passes by Denver's BOXWOOD BUSH secret place. Then continues forward, as if with a specific direction in mind. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON. \nSethe, Paul and Denver approach 124. Denver is the first to see. \nDENVER Look. What is that? \nAll three look to see; \nTHE YOUNG BLACK WOMAN sitting on a stump not far from the steps of 124. \nAs the three approach, the Young Woman lifts her head and stares directly at Sethe. \nThe two women exchange a moment in their eyes - Sethe, curious yet warm...The Young Woman, happy yet there is a hunger in her stare. \nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER. \nThe Young Woman seated on a chair as Denver refills a tin cup of water. The Young Woman drinks greedily, cup after cup. \nSETHE You from around here? \nThe Young Woman shakes her head NO. She reaches down and takes off her shoes, which Sethe notices as new. Sethe bends down to pick them up. The Young Woman never lets her eyes leave Sethe. \nPAUL Those shoes look brand new. \nAs Denver continues, Beloved steps towards her and begins to touch her face - examining her lips, her nose, her skin as if it were a rose to admire. Denver drinks in the attention, her heart expanding with love with every touch from this strange creature. \nDENVER ..and....and Bulgar...At night, we used to..crawl into bed together..I'd lay down on Bul's lap and Howard would tell us die- witch stories. He said they would protect us...And if I learned them, they would protect me if ever they were gone... \nEXT. PORCH - EARLY EVENING. \nEveryone is sitting on the porch after dinner. \nBeloved, looking strong and fit, eats a cane stick - gnawing at it to the flax, keeping the strings in her mouth long after the syrup had been sucked off. It makes Denver laugh, as she licks her cane stick. It makes Sethe smile, to see them both happy. \nIt makes Paul disgusted. \nINT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT. \nPaul confronts Sethe as she sews. \nPAUL You gonna just feed her, from now on? \nSETHE Denver likes her. She's no real trouble. \nPAUL But don't she have a home? Some place to go? \nSETHE Didn't mention one. I thought we'd wait until her breathing got better. She still sounds a little lumbar. \nPAUL She breathe like she can eat, she could blow this whole house down. And all those sweets. \nSETHE Sometimes the body needs that sugar for strength when it's trying to recover after an illness. \nPAUL But that's just it. She don't seem sick. Something funny about her. \nSETHE Funny? How? \nPAUL Acts sick, sounds sick but she don't look sick. Good skin, bright hands and strong as a bull. \nSETHE She can hardly walk without holding onto something. \nPAUL That's what I mean. Can't walk but I passed by Baby Sugg's room this morning and saw her lifting the rocker with one hand. \nSETHE You didn't? \nPAUL Don't tell me. Ask Denver. She was right there. \nAt that moment, Denver passes by on her way to the kitchen. \nSETHE Denver. Come in here a minute. \nDenver enters the keeping room. \nSETHE Paul says you saw Beloved pick up the rocking chair in Baby Suggs room with one hand. That so? \nDenver looks at Paul with a hard gaze; \nDENVER I didn't see no such thing. \nFrom Paul's expression we can tell Denver is lying...and whatever fragile connection they were building, is swiftly destroyed. \nINT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. \nSethe is getting ready for bed. Denver sticks her head in: \nDENVER Have you seen her? I can't find her. \nSETHE Who? \nDENVER Beloved. \nSethe shakes her head. Denver exits anxiously. The mentions of Beloved's name stir a MEMORY in Sethe: \nMEMORY: \nEXT. GRAVESTONE YARD - A DAY REMEMBERED. \nSethe talks to the HEADSTONE ENGRAVER as he works in the hot sun. His YOUNG SON helps him. \nSETHE She need a marker. Somethin' to tell me where she is. But I ain't got no money. \nThe Engraver eyes her body. \nENGRAVER What you got then? \nSethe is embarrassed by his lascivious tone, especially in front of the young boy. \nThe Engraver rises, takes a step toward Sethe and touches her hip, curling his hand around to her back. \nENGRAVER What you want it to say? \nSETHE I was thinking what the preacher say at the funeral. Dearly Beloved. \nENGRAVER (touching her) For ten minutes I give you one word for free. \nHis hand glides down to her buttocks. Sethe can't help but see the Young Boy watching the scene. \nEND of MEMORY. \nINT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. \nAs the memory starts to fade form her mind, Sethe suddenly feels someone else's presence. She looks up to find: \nBeloved standing by the door - watching her. \nSETHE Oh!...I didn't know you were there. \nBELOVED Can I help? \nSETHE Help what, honey? \nBeloved kneels before her on the floor and finishes buttoning up Sethe's night dress. \nBELOVED Where you go in the morning? \nSETHE Work. I work in a restaurant. \nBELOVED What time you go? \nSETHE Little after the sun come up. I like to make a loaf of bread before I go. How you feelin'? \nPaul doesn't want her to continue but doesn't want to say so. \nPAUL Any more beans? \nSethe rises to get him more food and she continues: \nSETHE ...anyway, she points to this mark and says to me \"This is your ma'am. I am the only one whose got this mark now. The rest all dead. If something happens to me and you can't tell me by my face, you can know me by this mark\"..Scared me so... I couldn't think of anything to say so I said \"Yes Ma'am..but how will you know us? Mark me too. Mark the mark on me too.\" \nDENVER Did she? \nSETHE No. She slapped my face. I didn't understand it then. Not until I had a mark of my own... \nPaul is disturbed. He can see Sethe getting upset. He is mad at Beloved for her damn questions.. \nBELOVED What happened to her? \nSomething inside of Sethe stops, a wall erected. Something unwanted is coming into her consciousness. Paul notices it. She rises; \nSETHE Don't know. Everybody done? \nSethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as Paul asks: \nPAUL Well, as long as we're all asking questions, getting to know each other.. (to Beloved) Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself? \nCamera follows Sethe as she arrives at the sink, placing the dish inside. We hear the others O.S.: \nDENVER (O.S.) (defensively) She don't remember nothing. \nPAUL (O.S.) You be surprised what you start remembering once you start talking. \nBELOVED (O.S.) Can I have some more pudding? \nCamera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the kitchen table. She is staring out the window above the sink as if watching the MEMORY BEING RELIVED IN HER YARD; \nPOV - OUT THE WINDOW; \nMEMORY: \nEXT. A LARGE TREE IN A FIELD - A DAY REMEMBERED. \nA CROWD of people surround a tree. SEVERAL WHITE MEN are preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in line, awaiting their turn. \nAmong the crowd is A CHILD (SETHE) holding the hand of an OLDER BLACK SLAVE WOMAN (NAN). Nan is pointing to a WOMAN (SETHE'S MOTHER), who is one of the people waiting in line to be hanged. Nan whispers to Sethe: \nNAN That's your mama - right there. \nLittle Sethe looks up and sees her mother - her face a mask of courage and rage and tears. She looks straight ahead - not at anyone in particular, especially not her daughter. \nNAN ..I'm telling you, small girl Sethe...Me and your Mama was taken by the men many times..She threw them other babies away..the others from the whites, without names, she threw them away..But you she gave the name of the black man. She had her arms around him, child. The others, she did not put her arms around. Never...Never... \nThe child Sethe listens, watching her mother move further down the line. \nEND of MEMORY as WE CUT BACK TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - \nSethe, the memory passing, hears the voices in her kitchen: \nPAUL (O.S.) Ain't you got no brothers or sisters? \nBELOVED (O.S.) I don't have nobody. \nShe finds Paul interrogating Beloved who eats a second pudding. Denver tries to interfere. \nDENVER She has us now! \nPAUL You been here five weeks, we still don't know nothing bout you.. \nSETHE Paul, Stop it. Denver bring those dishes. \nPAUL What was you looking for when you came here? \nBELOVED This place. I was looking for this place I could be in. \nPAUL Somebody tell you about this place? \nAt the sink, both Sethe and Denver pause, obviously interested. \nBELOVED She told me. When I was at the bridge, she told me. \nPaul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs; \nSETHE Must be somebody from the old days. \nPAUL How'd you come? Who brought you? \nBELOVED I walked here. A long, long, long, long way. Nobody bring me. \nPAUL You had new shoes. If you walked so long why don't your shoes show it? \nSETHE Paul D. stop picking on her. \nPAUL I want to know! Where'd you get them shoes and that dress you had on? \nBELOVED I take the shoes! (coughs) I take the dress! (coughs) The shoe strings don't fit! I... \nSuddenly, she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding and falls backward, off the chair. \nDenver and Sethe rush towards her. Beloved thrashes around until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin. \nShe breathes in Sethe's arms as Denver wipes up the mess, glaring at Paul. \nSETHE You all right? \nBELOVED (whispers) I want to go to sleep now. \nDENVER Come to my room. I can watch out for you up there. \nSethe gets Beloved to her feet. Denver takes her up the staircase to her room - glaring at Paul. \nWhen the girls have gone, Sethe turns on Paul as she cleans up. \nSETHE What's the matter with you? \nPAUL I don't understand what the hold is. It's clear why she holds onto you, but I just can't see why you holding on to her. \nPAUL Sethe, don't do this.. \nSETHE What a relief to just stop it all right there, huh?!! Close it shut! Squeeze that butter...But I had three children on their way to Ohio and nothing would have changed that! And you tell me he didn't leave me!! \nSethe exits O.S. Paul is left alone on the porch until Beloved runs out of the house giggling with Denver in pursuit. As Denver passes, Paul sarcastically remarks; \nPAUL Guess she's feeling better, huh? \nDenver gives him a quick, disdainful look, then continues after Beloved. \nThe two girls run towards the woods. \nEXT. BOXWOOD BUSH ROOM - NIGHT. \nBeloved is dancing beneath a bright moon. Denver is an attentive, grateful audience. \nDENVER Where'd you learn to dance? \nBELOVED Nowhere. Look at me do this! \nShe puts her fists on her hips and skips. \nBELOVED Now you! Come on! Come on! \nShe takes Denver's hand and places another on her shoulder. As they dance, Denver laughs harder and harder - a giddiness from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for Beloved's attention. \nThey spin and fall to the ground, like two lovers nestled. Beloved catches her breath as Denver asks; \nDENVER Why you call yourself Beloved? \nBELOVED In the dark my name is Beloved. \nDENVER What's it like where you were before? \nBELOVED (a thoughtful expression) Dark. I'm small in that place. I'm like this here. \nDENVER Were you cold? \nBELOVED Hot. Nothing to breathe there. No room to move. \nDENVER How did you get here? \nBELOVED I wait; then I got on the bridge. I stay there in the dark, in the daytime, in the dark in the daytime. Long time. \nDENVER All this time you were on the bridge? \nBELOVED No. After. When I got out. \nDENVER Why'd you come here? \nBELOVED To see her face. \nDENVER Ma'am's? Sethe's? \nBELOVED Yes. Sethe. \nAnd with that, Denver takes a breath of courage to ask the question she's been longing to ask: \nDENVER You my sister, ain't you? You really are. \nBeloved looks at her and smiles. They are so close she leans in curiously and - touching Denver's face - kisses her on the lips. \nDENVER You won't leave us, will you? \nBELOVED No. Never. This is where I am. \nDENVER I knew it. I knew. First time I saw you and you said your name. And when you touched me - real gentle. And familiar. Like I'd felt that touch before. \nSmiling, Beloved moves to touch Denver's cheek when suddenly, Denver sits up cross legged and urges Beloved; \nDENVER Don't tell mama. You musn't tell her who you really are. I don't know what she'd do! Please, you hear? \nSuddenly, Beloved's face turns to rage as she rises up as well; \nBELOVED Don't tell me what to do? Don't never tell me what to do!? \nDENVER But..but I'm on your side. I want to protect you... \nBELOVED (stands above Denver) She's the one! She's the one I need! You can go but she's the one I have to have! \nBeloved abruptly drops to her knees and crawls out the boxwood bush room as Denver's pleads; \nDENVER No. Beloved please! Don't go! I didn't do nothing! We were dancing! Don't go!.... \nINT. DENVER'S & BELOVED'S ROOM - DAWN THE FOLLOWING DAY. \nThe room is still dark from the night but the sun is rising outside. \nSuddenly, Beloved awakens with a start. She senses something. She rises and looks out the window to see; \nPOV; \nSETHE WALKING ACROSS THE FIELD. \nBeloved quickly grabs her clothes and exits to follow her, as Denver awakens just in time to see her go. \nEXT. WOODS EARLY MORNING. \nSethe is dressed as if for church as she makes her way through the woods with a specific destination in mind. \nSoon, she comes upon; \nEXT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - EARLY MORNING. \nSethe steps out of the woods and into an open clearing. A LARGE ROCK sits in the clearing like a pulpit above the pew's of grass and weeds. \nSethe remembers the place as it was... She hears the VOICES OF A CROWD...a gathering of people though the clearing remains empty. She crosses to the rock and sits. Camera moves up to reveal - \nMEMORY: \nBABY SUGGS, vital and strong, standing on the rock, preaching: \nBABY SUGGS I'm not here to tell you all to clean up your lives and sin no more....I'm not here to tell you we're the blessed meek and are glorybound!...I'm here to tell you that the only grace we can have, is the grace we can imagine...And if you cannot see it, then you shall not have it... \nEND OF MEMORY. \nAMY What you gonna do, just lay there and foal? \nSETHE I can't get up. \nAMY What? \nSETHE I can't get up. \nAmy wipes her nose and looks up beyond Sethe. \nAMY There's a house back yonder. Well, not a house with people in it - more like a lean-to near the river. \nSETHE How far? \nAMY Make a difference, does it? You stay here, snake might get you. \nSETHE Well, he may come but I can't stand up, let alone walk...and God help me, I can't crawl. \nAMY Sure you can Lu..come on.. \nAmy helps Sethe turn over onto all fours. \nEXT. ONION FIELD - DAY...MINUTES LATER. \nAmy walks beside Sethe as the latter painfully crawls, taking moments to stop and let the pain go through her. \nAMY Come on Lu! You got to move faster than that. You won't get to Ohio til you ninety years old, you keep moving that ways. \nINT. LEAN-TO - EARLY EVENING. \nAmy makes a pile of leaves for Sethe to lay on and some rocks for her to put up her feet. She talks non-stop as she works. \nAMY Never know it to look at me but I used to be a good size. Nice arms, everything. That was before they put me in the root cellar... \nShe eases Sethe onto the leaves then lifts her feet onto the rocks. \nAMY ...Mama worked for these people here to pay for her passage but then she had me and died right after so I had to work for'em.. I was fishing off the Beaver once and a nigger floated right by me. I don't like drowned people, do you? Your feet remind me of him. All swole like. \nAmy props Sethe up from behind when she notices \nAMY You all bloody back here. Gal you a mess. Undo your dress - let me see. \nSethe makes a tremendous effort just to turn to her side as Amy undoes her dress; \nAMY Lord, I ain't never seen a poorer excuse for a- \nAmy sees Sethe's back and, for a moment, is speechless. Then: \nAMY Jesus...It's a tree Lu..A chokecherry tree. I had me some whippings but I don't remember nothing like this. Glad I ain't you.. what God have in mind I wonder. ...You thank your Maker I come along. Spiderwebs all I can do for you. What's in here ain't enough. I'll look outside...Maybe I ought to break them blossoms open and let the pus run.. (rises) (smiles) That you ain't dead yet Lu's a miracle. Make you a bet..You make it through the night, you make it all the way... \nINT. LEAN-TO - NIGHT. \nTo Sethe's amazement, Amy begins to massage her feet and legs the pain of which causes Sethe to cry. \nAMY It's gonna hurt now..Anything dead coming back to life hurts. Stop wiggling, girl. (sings) \"WHEN THE BUSY DAY IS DONE AND MY WEARY LITTLE ONE ROCKETH TO AND FRO; WHEN THE NIGHT WINDS SOFTLY BLOW AND CRICKETS CHIRP AGAIN; WHERE'PON THE HAUNTED GREEN FAIRIES DANCE AROUND THEIR QUEEN THEN FROM YONDER MISTY SKIES COMETH LADY BUTTON EYES...\" (talks) Don't up and die on me in the night, you hear me Lu? I don't want to see your ugly face hankering over me. If you do die, just go on off somewhere where I can't see you, hear? \nSETHE I'll do what I can, miss. \nAmy continues singing..... \nEXT. PATH LEADING TO RIVER - DAY. \nSethe is trying to walk, holding on to Amy at first, then a tree. \nAMY Cause of me, you up and walking. See, Jesus - Lu made it through..I'm good at sick things, ain't I? \nSETHE Yeah, you good... \nAMY What's that all over your dress? \nSETHE Milk..Got to get my milk to my baby girl. \nAMY You got another baby waiting for you? \nSETHE (stops and touches belly) I think this one is dead. \nAmy doesn't know what to say, so she says: \nAMY You hungry? \nSethe keeps trying to walk; \nSETHE I ain't nothing but in a hurry, miss. Got to meet someone...help bring me and my milk to my baby girl... \nAMY You want shoes? \nSETHE Say what? \nAMY I figured how... \nCUT TO: \nAmy cutting two pieces form Sethe shawl then filling them with leaves and tying them over her feet - \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIVERBANK - DAY. \nSethe and Amy walk towards the river when then see: \nA SMALL, ABANDONED ROWBOAT with oars. \nAMY Jesus looking at you, girl! \nSethe can't believe her eyes. She walks right into the water when suddenly, her own water breaks and her labor begins... She doubles up in pain; \nAMY What you doing that for!? Ain't you got a brain in your head? Stop that right now! I said stop it, Lu. You the dumbest thing on this here earth, LU!..LU! \nSethe, on her knees, crawls into the boat and props her feet up. Water leaks in wherever it can, rising up as high as her waist. Amy takes her position to assist. \nAMY Oh Jesus, I'm awful sorry 'bout the braggin...I need you here now..Come on Jesus...don't be getting lost on me now. \nSethe screams in agony as the child pushes through. Amy curses; \nAMY Damn daddies never around 'cept for the fun part. Biggest joke God made on woman was giving men the planters 'stead of the soil...!! PUSH! \nWHITE GUARD (OS) YOU HUNGRY NIGGER? \nPaul awakens. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAWN. \nSethe enters to find Paul asleep in the rocker by the stove. She stirs him. \nSETHE Paul?..Paul? \nPAUL (waking up) Mmmm. What?... \nSETHE I called you two or three times but I gave up round midnight. I thought maybe you went out somewhere. \nPAUL Damn. I'm sorry honey... \nSETHE I'll make some breakfast - you get yourself washed up. \nSethe begins to make breakfast as Beloved enters the kitchen and sees Paul has slept in the rocker. She looks at him with a smile, as if she knows more than she's letting on. Paul registers the look. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT. \nPaul is asleep in the rocker...He is restless...HE DREAMS: \nEXT. A ROAD IN VIRGINIA - DAY. \nPaul is chained by the ankles to forty-five other men. He hands are shackled. In his mouth, an iron bit... \nThe men are being led by WHITE GUARDS with rifles. \nCamera follows them under a burning sun as they approach; \nA TRENCH. One thousand feet long. Five feet deep. Five feet wide. \nCamera tilts down to reveal, within the trench; \nWOODEN BOXES, with scrap limber roofs and a door of bars fitted on them like a cage that opens up to a wall of red dirt stretching two feet above the top of the bars themselves. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT. \nPaul awakens...his face and body drenched in sweat. \nEXT. FIELD BETWEEN 124 AND THE STOREROOM - NIGHT. \nPaul D. walks across the field with a thin blanket over his nightclothes - walking toward the storeroom. \nIn the window of her bedroom, Sethe watches him - sensing he is moving further and further away from her. \nIn the window of Denver's room, Beloved watches Paul as well - with a pleased expression. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S MEMORIES; \nEXT. A FIELD IN GEORGIA - DAY. \nA RIFLE SHOT. A WHITE GUARD SHOUTS; \nWHITE GUARD Hiiiiiii! \nEXT. TRENCH - DAY. \nThree white Men walk along the trench unlocking the cage doors one by one... \nOne by one, the Black men emerge and stand in a line in the trench. \nWhen all are assembled, A SECOND RIFLE SHOT signals them to climb out of the trench to the ground above. \nWaiting for them above the trench, is one thousand feet of chain. Each Black Man bends over and waits as the First Man on line threads the chain through his leg iron, passing it to the second and so on... \nAs they connect each other to the chain, Camera Pans down the line of men and while not a word is spoken, WE HEAR THEIR THOUGHTS...thoughts to themselves, or, if possible, through their eyes to the man beside them: \nBLACK MAN ONE (VO) I'm a make it.. \nBLACK MAN TWO (VO) New man. New man... \nBLACK MAN THREE (VO) Steady now, steady. \nBLACK MAN FOUR (VO) Help me... this mornin's bad. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE BLACK MEN ARE CHAINED AND KNEELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE. \nThe White Guards walk passed them. one White Guard stops in front of the man beside Paul D. He turns to him. \nWHITE GUARD Breakfast? Want some breakfast nigger? \nBLACK MAN ONE Yes sir. \nWHITE GUARD Hungry nigger? \nBLACK MAN ONE Yes sir. \nWHITE GUARD Here you go. \nThe White Guard unzips his fly and undoes his pants and moves a step closer to the Black Man's mouth. \nPaul D. looks ahead, trembling...He vomits...The Guard steps away as another Guard steps in and hits Paul on the shoulder with a rifle.. \nEXT. FIELD - DAY. \nThe Black Men work...sledge hammers in hand... \nAs they work, miraculously, THEY SING..\"They sing about the women they knew, the children they had been...they sing of bosses and masters and misses...of mules and dogs and the shamelessness of life...They sing of sisters long gone. They sing love songs to Death.\" \nINT. TRENCH - NIGHT. \nA torrential downpour. The men in the wooden cages watch the rain filling the trench, corroding the red dirt wall around them. \nBugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet. Mud covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof. \nSome finds rest. other's minds are long gone. \nCamera finds Paul...HE IS SCREAMING. But there is no sound coming from his mouth. Tears flow down his face, but when he touches them, he realizes; \nShe notices Mrs. Garner's light is on in her bedroom window. \nSethe, blind with rage, decides there's one thing she must do before she takes her children to the meeting place. \nINT. MRS. GARNER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. \nMrs. Garner lies ailing through a sleepless night when her bedroom door opens. Sethe enters - her appearance tells all. \nMRS. GARNER My God Sethe..what happened to you? \nEXT. SWEET HOME - NIGHT. \nSethe carried her baby girl in one arm, her two boys by the hand with the other...They move as fast as they can. \nEXT. CORN FIELD - NIGHT. \nThey arrive at the meeting place where A WOMAN crouching in the field is waiting. \nWOMAN Hurry up. You're late. \nSETHE (hands her the children) Here! \nHOWARD But ma'am... \nSETHE Just go with her! Do what I tell ya! \nSethe carefully hands her baby girl to the woman. \nSETHE Put sugar water on that cloth for her to suck so she won't forget me til I come. \nWOMAN Where you going? \nSETHE Halle wasn't there. I gotta go back. \nWOMAN You crazy.. \nSETHE Take em out. Now! I'll get there myself. I got her milk...I'll get there...Don't worry. \nShe kisses her baby girl, a little too hard perhaps, waking her...along with the boys... \nSETHE Go..Go! Now! \nSethe disappears back into the corn field leaving the Woman holding the baby girl... as Bulgar cries out. \nBULGAR Mama? \nEXT. CORN FIELD CLOSER TO SWEET HOME HOUSE - NIGHT. \nSethe exits the corn field and heads for her living quarters when suddenly; \nTHE FOUR BOYS appears from out of nowhere..two restraining her, one holding a horsewhip.... \nBOY WITH HORSEWHIP You nigger bastard.. \nSethe struggles and is about to scream out when she is slapped and muffled and dragged into the corn field to be beaten..... \nEND OF MEMORY; \nINT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. \nSethe awakens, sweating from having fallen asleep and reliving her past nightmare. She sits up and realizes where she is. She looks beside her and sees Paul asleep. She lays down, pressing her body against his so that there is no space between - enfolding her arms around him. \nEXT. PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY. \nPigs are crying in the chute as Paul, Stamp Paid and twenty other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse. \nAlthough steeped in pig shit on a wintry day - his hands numb from the cold - Paul D. is in high spirits. HE SINGS as he works much to the amusement of his fellow co-workers. \nCO-WORKER 1 Hey - you like this work so much maybe you best get in the chute with the others. You ain't got much more sense than they do. \nThe men laugh. Paul smiles and brushes it off. \nPAUL Ain't just a job reason to sing. Other things a man's got to look forward to that a job just a way to spend your day til the good times arrive. \nCO-WORKER 2 Good times? Ain't no such day. \nSTAMP PAID Now, now...it's all a state a mind, right Paul D. If you can think it, it can happen. \nPAUL More than that. When a man can make plans then a man can make good times happen. \nCO-WORKER 1 Oh the man's got plans! You saving up for a gold mine, boy. (more laughter) \nPAUL Better then gold, my friend. Me and my woman's planning on starting a family. \nStamp Paid's face registers sudden concern. \nPAUL New life. Born free, hear! Now if that don't define a good tine, I don't know what does. \nCO-WORKER 2 Nothing born free ever again. \nPAUL What you talkin? Nobody owns us no more. Nobody gonna own my children neither. \nCO-WORKER 2 Children inherit what come before'em. Just cause you can't see no chains, don't mean they not there. We're not free men. We're somewhere between freedom and chains. And as long as the world is white, that's where we're stayin. \nThe truth of this causes the men to be silent as they continue working. Stamp Paid looks at Paul, confused by what he should do. \nEXT. PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - LATER THAT DAY. \nThe men are on break. Paul sits alone enjoying a lunch packed by Sethe...Stamp Paid approaches and sits beside him. \nSTAMP PAID May I? \nPAUL Free country. No matter what anybody says. \nSTAMP PAID I like the way you think, boy. Good. Good to think that way. Friend of mine, Baby Suggs was her name...sort of became a preacher in these parts..that was her way of thinking too. When she was at her best, that is. \nPAUL You knew Baby Suggs? \nSTAMP PAID Oh yes...You're not one of her Sweet Home men, now are you? \nPAUL Yes sir...Me and my brothers and her son. \nSTAMP PAID Oh, I see now. \nPAUL Sethe told me she died soft as cream. \nEXT. CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY. \nAs folks gather to hear Baby Suggs preach, she introduces a smiling, shy Sethe to each one. \nSETHE (VO) ...And when everyone would gather to hear Baby Suggs, I saw something I ain't never seen before in my whole life... \nAlone for a moment, Sethe looks around at the crowd of faces; \nSethe's Melody stops as Baby Suggs stands on her rock and calls to the crowd: \nBABY SUGGS Let the children come! \nFROM OUT OF THE WOODS, CHILDREN RUN INTO THE CLEARING. \nCamera follows the joyous exodus to reveal: \nTHE CLEARING IS FILLED WITH ADULTS the entire black community of the days when Sethe first arrived. The children run to their respective families; \nBABY SUGGS (with joy) Let your mother's hear you laugh!! \nThe children, loving the game, laugh hard. The adults get a kick out of it. \nSethe watches her boys and hides her laughter. \nBABY SUGGS Let the grown men come!! \nOUT OF THE WOODS, A GROUP OF GROWN MEN COME INTO THE CLEARING. \nBABY SUGGS LET YOUR WIVES AND YOUR CHILDREN SEE YOU DANCE! \nThe men form a circle and dance as the crowd supports them with a clapping rhythm. A SONG arises from the women to accompany to dance.... \nBABY SUGGS Now...you women...I want you to cry. For the living. For the dead....Just cry. \nCamera follows those women who are not singing as one by one, they remember and weep... \nSethe watches...and weeps. \nSETHE ....Something in me knew Halle was never gonna knock on our door. He was never gonna see what I saw that day. I saw what men look like...and I saw mothers, for the first time. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. \nStamp Paid walks up to the porch carrying a TWO BIG BASKETS OF BLACKBERRIES ... his body dirty, scratched and bleeding. \nSETHE (VO) I think it was Stamp Paid who started it. He walked six miles to the riverbank, slid into a ravine, reached through blood drawing thorns, suffered mosquitoes, wasps and the meanest lady spiders in the State just to bring us those berries. \nHe places the baskets on the porch in front of Baby Suggs, Sethe who is holding Denver..and the Little Girl (Beloved). \nBABY SUGGS (laughs) What a sight you are, Stamp. \nSTAMP PAID Worth it though. Just one bite of these berries and you feel down right anointed. \nHe puts one into Denver's mouth. \nSETHE She's too little for that, Stamp. Her bowels be soup. \nBABY SUGGS It'll sickify her stomach..Now go wash up round back...crazy fool.. \nStamp exits. \nSETHE It was real nice of him. \nBABY SUGGS He's a good one, no doubt of that. I can get three, maybe four pies out of this. Seems a shame just for us though. I'm gonna invite Ella and John over... \nSETHE How 'bout if I make a couple of chickens to back it up? \nSETHE (VO) And that's how it began... \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY. \nSethe and Baby Suggs and Ella and several other women cook. \nSETHE (VO) ...Three pies became twelve...two hens became five turkeys... \nEXT.THE FIELD/124 BLUESTONE RD. - EVENING. \nVarious images of people gathered enjoying food and drink...laughing and singing... \nSETHE (VO) ...and Ella and John turned into almost ninety others... \n- Women serving up the food... \n- Older men sitting and talking as they eat... \n- Younger men playing with the children. Chasing them with sheets on their backs, scaring them into laughter.. \n- A Man with a guitar playing a blues song and singing. \nWhile Sethe enjoys her free life and, most of all, her children - the boys running around her..Denver in her arms..Her Little Girl (Beloved) by her side.. Baby Sugg's visits with various guests, serving up the food... \nSETHE (VO) ... Everybody ate so well and laughed so much... \nINTERCUT; Images of whispers exchanged between some of the women: \nSETHE (VO) ...it made them angry... \nWomen head to head with a remark or an eye of disapproval towards Baby Suggs as she continues cooking and feeding.... \nSETHE (VO) The pies, the turkeys...the bread pudding and shortbread..the one whole block of ice brought all the way from Cincinnati - it made 'em mad...Loaves and fishes were Jesus's powers...they did not belong to an ex-slave who never had a white boy beat her, who had her freedom bought, who rented a house from white folks that hated slavery worse than they hated slaves...It made'em furious - her thoughtless generosity and un-called for pride...She had over stepped...offended them by giving too much...and they left their disapproval there so's you could smell in the air the whole next day... \nEXT. THE FIELD/ 124 BLUESTONE RD. - THE FOLLOWING DAY. \nBaby Suggs works the field, not far from Stamp Paid... \nSETHE (VO) Later on I wondered why no one warned us...why no one saw them coming and ran to 124 to tell us... \nShe chops at the soil over the roots of the pepper plants. She stops - sensing something is wrong. She looks up at a clear blue sky...She hears the birds and the stream way down beyond the woods.. \nShe looks around and sees Bulgar, Howard and the Little Girl (Beloved) playing with loud voices by the side of the house. \nShe sees Sethe squatted in the pole beans with Denver in a bushel basket beside her. \nThe clok, clok of wood being chopped causes her to look over to Stamp Paid, helping out with the axe... \nShe returns to her work...but something is deeply wrong. \nOutside, a throng of black faces have gathered who stop murmuring the second they see her. Among them are Ella and Lady Jones. They are shocked and pained. \nSethe is led past them to a waiting cart - in total silence. \nBaby Suggs, at the same time, is getting the boys up the porch into the house. When Denver cries in Stamp Paid's arms, she stops..lets the boys sit and runs towards the cart. \nSethe is seated in the cart beside the Sheriff. Baby Suggs takes the crying Denver from Stamp Paid..She tells the Sheriff. \nBABY SUGGS Excuse me..but the child needs nursin..needs the mother's milk.. \nSHERIFF Then she's best come too. \nBaby Suggs approaches Sethe who sees Denver crying and reaches for her without letting the baby go. Baby Suggs resists; \nBABY SUGGS One at a time!...And you gotta clean yourself up! \nBut Sethe only wants her living child. The two women struggle as Stamp Paid does what he can..Finally, Sethe wins and takes Denver with her free hand, undoes her dress and nurse's her with a bloody breast.. \nBaby Suggs breaks inside. Breaks right in two, although from outwards appearances, she looks merely numbed by shock. \nA WHITE BOY makes his way through the crowd with a pair of shoes and hands them to her.. \nWHITE BOY Mama says Wednesday. She says you got to have them fixed by Wednesday. \nBaby Suggs looks at him not understanding.. \nWHITE BOY You hear, Baby? She says Wednesday. \nBABY SUGGS (taking the shoes) I beg your pardon..Lord, I beg your pardon..I sure do.... \nCUT TO: \nPRESENT DAY (END OF MEMORY) : \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT. \nPaul D. sits at the kitchen table. The story told. Sethe looks out the window...and waits.. \nPAUL Your love is too thick, Sethe. \nSETHE Love is or it isn't. Thin love ain't love at all...I did stop him. I took and put my babies where they'd be safe... \nPAUL Didn't work though, did it? \nSETHE It worked. \nPAUL How? Your boys gone, you don't know where. One girl dead, the other can't go farther than the yard. How did it work? \nSETHE They ain't at Sweet Home! Schoolteacher ain't got'em! \nPAUL Maybe there's worse. \nSETHE It ain't my job to know what's worse. It's my job to know what is and keep them away from what I know is terrible. I did that. \nPAUL What you did was wrong, Sethe. \nSETHE I should have gone back there? Taken my babies back there? \nPAUL There could have been a way. Some other way. \nSETHE What way? \nPAUL You got two feet, Sethe. Not four! \nThat jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it. Sethe has no response...The distance between these two people in this small room is suddenly vast. \nPaul rises, playing with his hat...not knowing how to leave. But desperately needing to. He moves to the exit and stops.. \nPAUL You can set aside supper for me... Might be late getting back... \nUnable to look at her, he turns to exit. When Sethe speaks in a soft, forgiving tone, he stops to listen; \nSETHE After all I told you, Paul D. and after telling me how many feet I have, you think saying goodbye is gonna break me into pieces? \nPaul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through him... \nSETHE You're a sweet man. \nUnable to bear it, Paul turns and leaves... \nSethe stands still, fighting tears, and whispers... \nSETHE So long, Paul D. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY. \nSethe is scrubbing the floor, with Denver trailing by with dry rags. \nBeloved enters holding a pair of ice skates; \nBELOVED What do these do? \nSethe and Beloved look up. Sethe smiles; \nSETHE My Lord...where'd you dig up those? \nDENVER There for skating on the ice. We have another pair and half of another, I think. \nBELOVED Can we try them? \nSethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious lightness: \nSETHE Go ice skating? Ha... (beat) Why not? \nDENVER You sure mama? \nSETHE Strikes me that after your man leaves, it might just be the wrong time to be scrubbing floors... might just be the perfect time to go ice skating. \nDenver and Beloved register hopefulness in the light of Sethe's attitude. Sethe speaks to Denver; \nSETHE Go get the shawls..and find me an old shoe for that half a pair... \nThe girls get excited. Sethe tosses the scrub brush into the pail. \nEXT. A FROZEN CREEK - DAY. \nSTAMP PAID This Saturday - you coming to Call or what? \nBABY SUGGS If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them. \nSTAMP PAID Say the Word! \nTwo whitemen raking leaves look up at the sound of Stamp Paid's voice, which was too loud. So he whispers; \nSTAMP PAID The Word. What you was put here to speak. \nBABY SUGGS That's the last thing they took from me. \nSTAMP PAID But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there. \nBABY SUGGS What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world. \nSTAMP PAID What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here. \nBABY SUGGS Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither. \nSTAMP PAID You getting into bed to think about yellow? \nBABY SUGGS I likes yellow. \nSTAMP PAID Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what? \nBABY SUGGS Can't say. It's something can't be planned. \nSTAMP PAID You blaming God. That what you're doing? \nBABY SUGGS No, Stamp. I ain't. \nSTAMP PAID You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying? \nBABY SUGGS Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop. \nSTAMP PAID You saying nothing counts? \nBABY SUGGS I'm saying they came into my yard. \nSTAMP PAID You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood? \nBABY SUGGS I'm saying they came into my yard. \nSTAMP PAID You punishing Him, ain't you? \nBABY SUGGS Not like He punished me. \nSTAMP PAID You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right. \nBABY SUGGS Was a time I knew what was. \nSTAMP PAID You still know. \nBABY SUGGS What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes. \nSTAMP PAID Aw, Baby. \nHe stops her, before the Twin Chestnuts of the Tucker house. \nSTAMP PAID We have to be steady. \"These things too will pass\". What you looking for? A miracle? \nBABY SUGGS No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door. \nThey exchange a look of silence and finality. She turns and walks to the back door of the house and knocks. A moment later a White Woman appears, takes the carpetbag and keeps Baby waiting on the back steps while she goes in for a dime. Baby rests on the railing until the whitewoman returns. \nMEMORY END. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. \nNow, Stamp Paid feels the need to find out what's going on inside 124 since he caused Paul to leave. He approaches the porch, then the front door. He raises his hands to knock - but he can't bring himself to do it. \nHe turns to walk away then stops. He turns back and with a force of will, KNOCKS LOUDLY upon the door. No answer. He KNOCKS AGAIN. Still no answer. \nHe steps back, trying to sense if anyone's there. He turns to leave when he sees; \nTWO HEADS in the window. Denver and Beloved. Denver bolts away, but Beloved remains a moment longer - looking in Stamp Paid's eye, then disappearing into the house. \nStamp Paid is unnerved by her look. \nINT. SAWYER'S RESTAURANT - LATE MORNING. \nSethe enters late, putting on her apron as SAWYER yells; \nSAWYER What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late? \nSETHE Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning. \nSAWYER What? What? You talking back to me? \nSETHE I'm telling you don't say nothing to me. \nSethe begins organizing her counter to make pies. \nSAWYER You better get them pies made! \nSethe ignores him as she begins. Sawyer is at a loss. \nSAWYER Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it. \nSETHE Make it the way I always do. \nSAWYER Yeah. Too sweet. (he exits) \nINT. ELLA'S HOUSE - DAY. \nElla opens the front door for Stamp Paid. He looks disturbed. \nELLA Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside. \nSTAMP PAID Oh I been out. \nStamp takes off his hat and follows Ella, who is doing laundry in the kitchen. \nELLA Out where? \nEXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING. \nSethe is walking home to her daughters. There is a serene, introverted expression on her face...as if she were detached from the world around her, safe inside. We hear her thoughts: \nSETHE (VO) Beloved, she my daughter...She mine. She come back to me of her own free will and I don't have to explain a thing.. She had to be safe and I put her where I knew she would be. But my love was tough and she back now. She come back to me in the flesh...I won't never let her go. I'll explain to her, even though I don't have to. Why I did it. How if I hadn't killed her she would have died and that is something I couldn't let happen to her. When I explain she'll understand, cause she understands everything already..And she ain't even mad...When I put that headstone up I wanted to lay in there with you, put your head on my shoulder and keep you warm and I would have if Bulgar and Howard and Denver didn't need me, because my mind was homeless then. I couldn't lay down with you then. No matter how much I wanted to. I couldn't lay down nowhere in peace, back then. Now I can. I can sleep like the drowned, have mercy. She come back to me, my daughter, \nDENVER'S VOICE OVER FADES IN OVER SETHE'S.... \nSETHE (VO)              DENVER my Beloved and she        Beloved is my is mine....               sister... \nDENVER (VO) ..and she is mine... \nFADE TO; \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING. \nDenver is cleaning the kitchen, waiting for her mother. We hear her thoughts: \nDENVER (VO) ..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine... \nBELOVED'S VO FADES IN OVER DENVER'S... \nDENVER (VO)               BELOVED (VO) Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved \nBELOVED (VO) and she is mine... \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING. \nBeloved, waiting for Sethe to come home, sees her approaching. We hear her thoughts: \nBELOVED (VO) I am not separate from her. There is no place where I stop. Her face is my own and I want to be there in the place where her face is and to be looking at it too...a hot thing..In the beginning I could see her. I could not help her because the clouds were in the way. But I could see her. The shining in her ears. I look hard at her so she will know that the clouds are in the way..I cannot lose her again. I see her face which is mine. It is the face that was going to smile at me in the place where we crouched before I come up out of the blue water. Sethe's is the face that left me. Sethe's sees me in her and I see the smile. She is my face smiling at me. It is the face I lost. Now we can join..a hot thing. \nSethe comes to the waiting Beloved and smiles. She offers her hand and Beloved rises. Denver exits to them and smiles. She extends her hand to Beloved's free hand. The three women stand astride each other, arms around each other's waist as they walk toward the porch... \nThe dusk sunlight creates THREE SHADOWS - three figures holding each other the way Sethe saw the shadows at the carnival...Only they weren't Hers, Denver's and Paul's...They were Hers, Denver's and Beloved's.... \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING. \nThe girls rush into the house, and down the hall. \nSethe enters. Then turns back to the door. \nC.U. ; OF SETHE'S HAND LOCKING THE FRONT DOOR AS WE HEAR; \nSETHE (VO) \nI AM BELOVED AND SHE IS MINE..     DENVER (VO) SHE IS MINE... \nOVER THE FOLLOWING CHORUS OF DIALOGUE, A MONTAGE OF IMAGES DEPICTING SETHE, BELOVED AND DENVER CLOSING UP THE HOUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD - LOWERING SHADES, LOCKING WINDOWS, BARRING DOORS..... \nSETHE (VO) \nTELL ME THE TRUTH..              BELOVED (VO) CANNOT LOSE HER AGAIN. \nSETHE (VO) DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE. \nBELOVED (VO) YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE. \nSETHE (VO) YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME? \nBELOVED (VO) YES. \nSETHE (VO) YOU NEVER FORGOT ME? \nBELOVED (VO) YOUR FACE IS MINE. \nDENVER (VO) DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH. \nSETHE (VO) DO YOU FORGIVE ME? \nBELOVED (VO) YOU HURT ME. \nDENVER (VO) I WILL PROTECT YOU. \nSETHE (VO) WILL YOU STAY? \nBELOVED (VO) WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU? \nSETHE (VO) I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN. \nDENVER (VO) WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS. \nBELOVED (VO) WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN? \nDENVER (VO) THE WHITEFOLK? \nSETHE (VO) OUT THERE. WAY OFF. \nDENVER (VO) DADDY IS COMING FOR US. \nBELOVED (VO) CAN THEY GET IN HERE? \nSETHE (VO) NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK FROM THE FRONT DOOR, NOW LOCKED AGAINST THE WORLD, IN A SLOW MOVE....AS WE HEAR A BLEND OF THE THREE WOMEN'S VOICES - THE OVERLAPPING, HAUNTED THOUGHTS OF THE LIVING... \nTHREE WOMAN (VO) BELOVED..YOU ARE MY SISTER..YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER. YOU ARE MY FACE..YOU ARE ME..I HAVE FOUND YOU AGAIN..I WAITED FOR YOU..YOU ARE MY BELOVED. DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH...YOU MY BEST THING.. YOU ARE MINE..YOU ARE MINE..YOU ARE MINE... \nBY THE TIME THE CAMERA REACHES BLUESTONE ROAD, THE VOICES ARE MIXED, UNDECIPHERABLE YET AUDIBLE... \n...AUDIBLE TO STAMP PAID, WHO STANDS ON BLUESTONE RD. LISTENING TO THE HAUNTED VOICES OF 124.  HE IS FRIGHTENED. \nFADE -OUT. \nFADE- IN: \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY. \nA cold day. Paul D. sits against the church drinking from a bottle when a voice causes him to look up; \nSTAMP PAID Howdy. \nStamp has his hands in his pockets, moving about. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - MORNING. \nThe sun shines on a warm April day..a day abundant with growth and renewed hope. \nBut a shadow appears to be hovering over 124. It looks more worn than before...neglected, abused. \nA broken window...the front door off it's hinge...a front step splintered and dangerous. \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - MORNING. \nCamera opens on the front hall and moves through the house, revealing the same neglect inside; \nBroken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder... \nCamera enters; \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING. \nDirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains hanging askew... \nSethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall. She wears a dirty, torn dress that hangs on her body - which seems withered, frailer since we last saw her...In her lap lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing when she fell asleep from fatigue. \nA LOUD CRASH wakes her up. Followed by a LOUD FRUSTRATED YELL. Her face registers fear. She realizes where she is, what time it is...and begins organizing breakfast... \nShe places the dress neatly on the chair, then grabs a cloth and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper, placing them in the sink... \nShe opens a pantry cupboard to reveal BARE SHELVES except for a SINGLE EGG and a bowl of HOMINY GRAINS about 1/4 full. She searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening cabinets, doors - places that never stored food. She realizes there is none left. \nINT. DENVER'S ROOM - MORNING. \nDenver finished dressing. She has been able to maintain a semblance of order about her person and room.. \nBut as she steps out into the second floor hallway, we see the same disarray as downstairs... \nShe passes by Baby Sugg's old room and discovers; \nBELOVED, sprawled across the bed, half naked. Her belly is huge, her body unwashed. She looks, and behaves, like a wild animal... \nA broken lamp lies on the fall - pushed over by her leg as she shifted in bed. Her feet, overhanging the bed, are still touching the bedside table where the lamp sat. \nShe is awake now - making a small hole larger in Baby Sugg's old quilt. \nDENVER You shouldn't be in here? \nBeloved jolts her head up to Denver. She doesn't like being looked at unawares... \nBELOVED What do you know about it? I sleep where I want. \nDENVER You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt. \nBeloved looks at Denver, then at the quilt - then abruptly tears the hole apart with one strong pull. \nTriumphant, she gets out of bed and exits, passing Denver; \nBELOVED Breakfast ready? I'm hungry! \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING. \nSethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it on one plate which she sets on the table. She stands at the stove, with her back to us, picking crusted pieces of food off the bottom of the pan. \nBeloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and begins to eat, shovelling the food into her mouth. \nDenver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs, as she pretends to wash the dishes. \nSETHE Morning. \nDENVER Morning, ma'am. \nSethe turns, not realizing Denver was there as well. Their eyes meet. Sethe wonders if her daughter saw her eating the pan crumbs. She smiles; \nSETHE You hungry? \nKnowing there must be nothing left, Denver answers; \nDENVER No, ma'am. \nSethe looks relieved. \nDENVER I'll finish those. Why don't you sit down? \nDenver crosses to the dishes, taking the pan from her mother. Sethe nods and crosses to the table, to sit down. \nBut as she sinks into the chair, Beloved kicks it away; \nBELOVED You don't sit with me!! \nSETHE Baby, don't be like that. \nBELOVED You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me! \nSETHE Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you. \nBELOVED I had another dream last night. (as she eats) The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light.. \nSETHE Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams.. \nBELOVED You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind... \nSETHE Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing! \nBELOVED You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me.. \nSETHE That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever.. \nDENVER Ma'am... \nNo one pays attention to Denver. \nBELOVED LIAR! \nBeloved flings her plate at Sethe, hitting her hard across the eye..the plate breaking... \nDENVER MAMA! \nSETHE Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up. \nThe TWO BLACK MEN pass her, tipping their hats, saying; \nTWO BLACK MAN Morning...Morning.. \nAnd they walk by. Denver's eyes speak the gratitude she never got her mouth open in time to reply. Heartened by the encounter, she picks up speed. \nEXT. LADY JONES' HOUSE - DAY. \nLADY JONES - a light-skinned black woman with gray eyes and yellow woolly hair - opens the door to find Denver. \nLADY JONES Why Denver..Look at you. \nDenver manages to smile. \nLADY JONES It's been so long. It's so nice of you to come see me. What brings you? \nUnfortunately, Denver can't manage anything beyond the smile. \nLADY JONES Well, never mind - nobody needs a reason to visit. Let me make us some tea. Come on. \nLady Jones takes her by the hand and leads her inside. \nINT. LADY JONES' HOUSE - DAY. \nTea things sit on a table between them. Denver eats whatever she can. Lady Jones watches with care and concern. \nLADY JONES How's your family, honey? \nDenver swallows a bite of something with some tea, then; \nDENVER I want to work, Miss Lady. \nLADY JONES Work? Start learnin your letters again? \nDENVER No. I mean work work. \nLADY JONES Well, what can you do? \nDENVER I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra. \nLADY JONES Extra? \nDENVER Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings. \nLADY JONES Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry. \nDENVER No..No that won't do... \nLady Jones can sense something far more serious is going on. \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE RD./ KITCHEN - DAY. \nDenver brings four eggs, some rice and some tea onto the kitchen table. \nSethe's eyes well up. She looks at Denver as if for the first time. Her face an expression of gratitude. Suddenly; \nBELOVED (OS) RAAAIN!!! RAAAAIN! \nSethe and Denver rush out of the kitchen to see; \nbeloved running through the rooms, clawing at her throat, causing it to bleed... \nSETHE BABY! \nSethe and Denver rush towards into the keeping room. Sethe stumbles over a chair to get to Beloved, kneeling on the floor, ripping at her own neck... \nDenver gets her from behind and Sethe grabs her from the front, pinning her down - trying to stop her from hurting herself. Beloved screams and strikes out at Sethe, pulling her hair, clawing at her as well... \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. \nDenver exits the house because she sees something unusual in the yard; \nPOV - THE STUMP; \nOn the same stump that Beloved first appeared, sits A BASKET OF EGGS. Denver crosses to it, lifts it and a PAPER flutters to the ground. She reads it; \nM. LUCILLE WILLIAMS... \nEXT. M. LUCILLE WILLIAMS HOUSE - DAY. \nDenver returns the empty basket to M. Lucille Williams. \nDENVER Thank you. \nM. LUCILLE WILLIAMS Your welcome.. \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. \nBeloved eats ravenously from a bowl of white beans. Sethe sits in the corner, as if waiting to serve her... \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY \nUpon the stump, sits a plate of cold rabbit meat, which Denver brings inside. \nINT. GRACE'S HOUSE - DAY. \nDenver is returning a bowl to Grace, a friendly woman. \nGRACE No, darling. That's not my bowl. Mine's got a blue ring around it..Would you like to come in a spell? \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. \nBeloved sleeps curled up on the kitchen floor after eating - her mouth still dirty from the meal... \nSethe, unwashed, her hair uncombed, sits in her corner chair. She is trying to mend a torn dress. \nDenver eats a little from the latest neighborhood gift. She hears her mother mumbling to herself like a madwoman. \nSETHE Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right... \nDENVER Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something. \nSETHE She likes this dress... \nDENVER But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table. \nDENVER Mama?....Mama I'm going out.. (no response) Mama, I got a job. Working over at the Bodwins at night. Mr. Bodwin coming over now to pick me up on his way back from town. I'll be staying there nights and coming back here for the daytime. We'll have some money, mama..Mama? \nSethe continues her action as if hypnotized. Denver approaches her from behind and whispers softly; \nDENVER I'm going help you, mama. Don't you give up yet. \nDenver touches her gently, but Sethe acts as if she hears and feels nothing. Denver exits. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE THAT DAY. \nDenver is sitting on the stump waiting for Mr. Bodwin when she hears; \nTHIRTY WOMEN, gathered together, walking up Bluestone Rd. towards 124, SINGING A HOLY SONG; \nDenver is amazed by the sight as the women position themselves right in front of 124 - armed with bibles, crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they could find. \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE RD; THE KEEPING ROOM - DAY. \nSethe is rubbing a naked Beloved's forehead with a cool cloth filled with ice, when the two women hear the singing. \nBeloved rises first and moves to the window to see. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. \nThe women continue singing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FURTHER DOWN BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. \nMR. BODWIN, sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse, is riding toward 124 when he hears the singing as well. \nWE NOTICE THAT MR. BODWIN IS WEARING A HAT SIMILAR TO THE ONE SCHOOLTEACHER WORE on that fateful day. \nCUT BACK TO: \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. \nThe women continue singing as: \nSethe and Beloved, her belly as big as a pregnant woman's, exit the house. \nThe women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by the lack of fear between the women. \nSethe is holding Beloved's hand. Beloved is smiling brightly at the beautiful singing. \nDenver looks to her mother; \nTears run down Sethe's face but she is not crying. The sound of the women's voices wash over her like a baptism. She looks to all the women, faces she remembers, faces she has missed although up until this moment was not conscious of missing. \nThen, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees: \nMR. BODWIN APPROACHING IN HIS WAGON. SHE SEES MR. BODWIN WEARING A HAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SCHOOLTEACHERS. \nSethe's expression turns to fear, then rage. In her ravaged mind, she thinks it is Schoolteacher coming back... \nSETHE No...No, he's not coming into my yard. He not taking my best thing...No.. \nShe releases Beloved's hand and moves forward... \nSETHE No...no...no.. \nDENVER Mama? \nShe passes Denver, feeling for the ICE PICK IN HER APRON. \nSETHE No...NO..NO..NOOOOOOOOOOOO! \nAs Mr. Bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from 124. HIS EYES FOCUS IN WONDER ON THE NAKED BELOVED AS; \nSETHE RUNS TOWARDS HIM AND THE WOMEN, HER HAND EXTENDED HOLDING THE ICE PICK.. \nDENVER MAMA...NOOOOOOO! \nDENVER RUNS AFTER HER. SETHE REACHES THE WOMEN AND LUNGES FOR BODWIN BUT THE WOMEN SEIZE HER, CREATING A HILL OF BLACK PEOPLE. SETHE RISING TO THE TOP, HER HAND EXTENDED. DENVER REACHING HER FROM BEHIND, PULLING HER BACK AND PUNCHING HER OUT COLD AS THE BODIES FALL AROUND THEM.... \nBeloved watches from the house - watches Sethe attack and defend with the ice pick.  And something within her is resolved. For a moment, we see a calm spirit instead of a wild animal. And a tear upon her face.. \nThen, just as quickly, she sprints around the side of the house and disappears from view. \nThe Women try to help Sethe as Denver cries for her mother. Mr. Bodwin looks on stunned. \nWIDE ANGLE - OF A NAKED BLACK WOMAN WITH A FULL BELLY RUNNING THROUGH AN OPEN FIELD, REACHING THE WOODS THEN DISAPPEARING INTO THE TREES...... \nFADE OUT; \nFADE IN: \nEXT. RICHMOND ST. - DAY. WEEKS LATER. \nPaul D. is on his way to work when he sees; \nA poised, confident Denver walking in the opposite direction. She spots him and smiles; \nDENVER Good morning, Paul D. \nPaul is clearly impressed by the sight of her. \nPAUL Well, is it now? How you getting along? \nDENVER Don't pay to complain. \nPAUL You on your way home? \nDENVER No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama. \nPAUL They treating you right over at the Bodwins? \nDENVER More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me. \nPaul smiles - wanting to warn her but deciding not to spoil the possibilities that lay before her. \nPAUL Your mother all right? \nDENVER No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day. \n", "test1_input": "DENVER About what? \nSETHE Oh, about time. How some things go. Pass on. Some things just stay. \nDENVER What things? \nSETHE Like, the place I was at before here - Sweet Home. Even if that whole farm and every tree and blade of grass on it died - it'll still be there. Waiting. And if you go and stand in the place where it was, what happened there once, will happen again. \nDENVER If it's still there, waiting, that mean nothing ever dies? \nSETHE Nothing ever does. That's why I had to get my children out. No matter what. That's why you can never go there. \nDENVER You never tell me all what happened. Just that they whipped you and you run off pregnant with me. \nSETHE You don't need to know nothing else. \nDENVER (nods) I saw a white dress kneeling next to you when you was praying. \nSETHE White? Maybe it was my bedding dress. Describe it to me. \nDENVER Had a high neck. Whole mess of buttons coming down the back. \nSETHE Buttons. Well, that's not my bedding dress. I never had a button on nothing. What else? \nDENVER A bunch at the back. On the sit down part. \nSETHE A bustle? \nDENVER I don't know what it's called. \nSETHE You say it was holding on to me. How? \nDENVER Kneeling next to you while you were praying. I mean, talking. It looked just like you. \nSETHE Well, I'll be. \nDENVER I think it was a sign. I think maybe baby's got plans. \nSETHE What plans? \nDENVER I don't know, but that dress holding onto you got to mean something. \nSETHE Maybe. Maybe it does. \nSethe smiles sympathetically for her lonely child. They hear a sound in the house - floor boards creaking. \nDENVER She's crawling again. \nSethe nods and holds her daughter's hand as they listen. \nFADE OUT; \nSUPER: 1873. \nFADE IN; \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY. \nC.U. - PAUL D. GARNER. \nPaul stands on the road, gazing up at the house. Grateful he's arrived, cautious about what he'll find, he steps towards the porch. His clothes are ragged. His feet sore and blistering in his shoes. \nEXT. THE PUMP - DAY. \nOff to the side of the house, Sethe washes her feet and legs at the pump. She looks up and sees Paul's figure walking towards the house. The sun blazes in her eyes. She can't make out who it is, or whether or not he's even real. As he reaches the porch, Paul disappears from view. \nSethe walks towards the front of the house. When she is little more than forty feet away, she stops - still not certain Paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past. \nSETHE Paul? Paul D.? Is that you? \nPAUL (smiles) What's left. (He rises) How you been girl, besides barefoot? \nSethe jams her balled up stockings into her pocket. She smiles like a little girl, not able to believe her eyes. \nSETHE You looking good. \nPAUL Devil's confusion. He lets me look good long as I feel bad. \nSETHE How long has it been? \nPAUL 'Bout eighteen years, I figure. \nSETHE Eighteen years. \nPAUL And I swear I been walking every one of them. Mind if I join you? \nHe begins taking off his shoes. \nSETHE You want to soak them? Let me get you some water. \nPAUL No, uh, uh. Can't baby feet. A whole more tramping they got to do yet. \nSETHE You're not leaving right away, are you? You stay awhile. \nPAUL Well, long enough to see Baby Suggs, you..Where is she? \nSETHE Dead. \nPAUL Aw no. When? \nSETHE Eight years now. Almost nine. \nPAUL Was it hard? I hope she didn't die hard. \nSETHE Soft as cream. Being alive was the hard part. Sorry you missed her though. Is that what you came by for? \nPAUL That's some of what I came for. The rest is you. \nSethe doesn't know what to do with her eyes when he says this..she looks away instinctively. Paul realizes that may have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs: \nPAUL The truth be known, I go anywhere these days. Anywhere they let me sit down. \nSETHE Come on inside. \nPAUL Porch is fine. Cool out here. Sit with me. \n", "test1_true": "PAUL So Baby Suggs is gone. Somehow never thought death would find her. \nSETHE It finds everyone. \nPAUL We managed well enough without meeting it. \nSETHE I suppose. \nAwkward pause. Sethe tries to find the words to a difficult question - but one that is foremost in her mind; \nSETHE I wouldn't have to ask about him, would I?...You'd tell me if there was anything to tell, wouldn't you? \nPaul knows instantly she is asking about Halle. \nPAUL You know I would. But I don't know any more about what happened to Halle now than I did then. \nSomething about Paul's expression might suggest he's keeping something from her. He turns his gaze outward as he says; \nPAUL You must think he's still alive. \nSETHE No. I think he's dead. It's just not being sure that keeps him alive. \nPAUL What did Baby Suggs think? \nSETHE Same. Ha, listen to her, all her children dead and she felt each one go the very day and hour it happened. \nPAUL When she say Halle went? \nSETHE 1855. Same day my baby was born. \nPAUL You had that baby, did you? Damn, never thought you'd make it. Running off pregnant. \nSETHE Had to. Couldn't be no waiting. \nPAUL All by yourself too. \nSETHE Almost. A white girl helped me. \nPAUL Then she helped herself, God bless her. \nAwkward silence. \nSETHE We got spare rooms. You could stay the night, if you had a mind to. \nPAUL You don't sound too steady in the offer. \nSETHE Oh it's..it's truly meant. I just hope you'll pardon my house. \nPaul smiles a warm, touched smile that after all that they've survived, Sethe is worried about what he'll think of her home. \nPAUL My house. I like the sound of that. \nSethe smiles, then rises to escort him in. \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY. \nSethe opens the front door and enters, with Paul behind her, hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder. As he follows her in; \nA POOL OF RED, UNDULATING LIGHT forms around him. It worries him. \nPAUL You got company? \nSETHE On and off. \nThe light undulates faster and faster, extending all the way to the kitchen at the end of the hall. Frightened, Paul steps back out the door. \nPAUL Good God! What kind of evil you got in there? \nSETHE It's not evil..It's just..just sad. Come on. Just step through. \nSethe reaches out her hand. Paul tentatively takes it and is lead through the red light of the hallway, through to the kitchen where it ends. \nAs he walks through, we can see Paul affected by the light. It is sad. A sadness that touches him, welling up inside until tears are brimming in his eyes. He reaches the normal light of the kitchen and steps out of it. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY. \nPaul turns back to find the red light in the hall is gone. \nPAUL I thought you said she died soft as cream. \nSETHE (busying herself in kitchen) Oh that's not Baby Suggs. That's my daughter. The one I sent ahead with the boys before I run off. \nPAUL She didn't live? \nSETHE No. \nPAUL The boys too? \nSETHE No, they alive - they run off before Baby Suggs died. The one I was carrying when I left Sweet Home is all I got left. \nStill affected by the light, Paul eases himself down at the table, finding something to say. \nPAUL Well, probably best..If a Negro boy got legs he ought to use them. Sit down too long, somebody figure out a way to tie them up....... (the image disturbs Sethe) You by yourself then? \nSETHE Me and Denver... my daughter. \nPAUL No man? (Sethe shakes head \"no\") And that's all right by you? \nSETHE It's all right by me...I cook at a restaurant in town. Sew a little on the sly.... \nShe places a bottle and a glass on the table before him. The light jarred him. He snatches the bottle to drink and calm himself down. She jokes. \nSETHE You look more done in by a walk through my front hall than all those eighteen years of walking put together. \nPAUL Got that right. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR OF 124 - MORNING. \nDenver, all of eighteen years old now, and beautiful, is buttoning up her dress when she hears the voice of a man down in the kitchen. She stops. Her face lights up. \nDENVER Daddy? \nShe runs down the white staircase. \n", "test2_input": "Baby Suggs welcomes Sethe into the house, kissing her hard on the lips....Sethe can't believe she's in her arms. \nBABY SUGGS Where's Halle? \nSethe looks at her with confusion and exhaustion. \nSETHE He wasn't there. \nA flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism. \nBABY SUGGS Well, he be along presently, I'm sure. \nSETHE Where are the children? \nBABY SUGGS Not now. You too ugly looking to wake 'em up in the night. First we get you well.. \nINT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT. \nBaby Suggs bathes Sethe - first her face, her body...hands, arms, legs... \nWhen she gets to her unrecognizable feet, she touches them. \nBABY SUGGS You feel this? \nSETHE Feel what? \nBABY SUGGS Nothing.. \nBaby Suggs notices roses of blood on Sethe's back...She looks and covers her mouth when she sees the remnants of the whipping. \nBABY SUGGS Girl... \nINT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY. \nBaby Suggs with two other grown women attend to Sethe's back - greasing it and pinning double thicknesses of cloth to the inside of a newly stitched dress... \nINT. KEEPING ROOM - STILL LATER THAT DAY. \nSethe, sitting in bed with her new dress and her wounds dressed waits for her children. \nBaby Suggs opens the door and the boys are ushered in. Sethe welcomes them to her arms...They run to her, jumping on the bed. The startle causes some pain but Sethe doesn't care. \nThe Little Girl (Beloved) is crawling and ushered toward her mama. \nBABY SUGGS Already crawling - ain't that somethin? ..Come on, baby girl..right this way..Mama's waiting.. \nSethe picks her up and the tears flow. She can't stop kissing them - their necks, their heads, their hands...The Boys inspect her strange looking feet and ask; \nHOWARD Pappie come? \nSETHE Soon. \nBaby Suggs seems doubtful but appreciates the lie for the children. \nBABY SUGGS All right boys - mama's home now, you be seeing her all the time..Go downstairs and get your supper...Go on... \nSethe hugs and kisses them as if for the last time - as if she still doesn't believe she can just get out of bed, walk downstairs and be with them. The Boys leave as Sethe cradles the Little Girl. \nSethe anxiously undoes her dress and carefully guides her breast to the Little Girl. She winces with pain and smiles - she got her milk to her baby girl. \nBaby Suggs gathers the rags Sethe wore when she first arrived. \nBABY SUGGS Nothing worth saving here. \nSETHE Oh wait..Look and see if there's something knotted up in the petticoat. Wedding present. From Mrs. Garner. \nBaby Suggs finds TWO CRYSTAL EARRINGS. \nBABY SUGGS Be nice if there was a groom to go with it. What do you think happened to him? \nSETHE I don't know. He wasn't where he said to meet him at. I had to get out. I had to. He'll make it. if I made it, Halle sure can. \nBABY SUGGS (skeptical) Well put these on - maybe they'll light his way. \nAs Sethe takes the earrings, the Little Baby Girl reaches for them. \nThrough her eyes, we see them sparkle and shine - like diamonds. \nBaby Suggs hands gently massage Sethe's neck as she says; \nBABY SUGGS Whatever happens now...God lead you home. So now lay'em down Sethe...Sword and shield..Don't study war no more. Lay all that mess down. Sword and shield... \nSethe surrenders herself to Baby Suggs firm, safe hands - letting go of the \"diamonds\", one of which lands in the hands of the Little Girl...who plays with them in fascination... \nEND OF MEMORY. \nCUT BACK TO: \nPRESENT DAY; \nEXT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY \nSethe is remembering these last images, she eases her own hand up to her neck - rubbing herself the way Baby Suggs did. She realizes how much she misses her...and wonder who can touch her now and help her \"lay it all down\". And then, quite suddenly; \nAN IMAGE FLASHES ACROSS HER MIND; \n- PAUL GENTLY EASING HIS HANDS AROUND SETHE FROM BEHIND...TENDERLY KISSING SETHE'S BACK \nPaul...There is Paul. Sethe realizes, as IMAGES FLASH ACROSS HER MIND'S EYE: \n- PAUL SITTING ON THE PORCH THE FIRST DAY HE ARRIVED. \n- PAUL BATTLING THE BABY GHOST. \n- PAUL SINGING AS HE FIXES THE KITCHEN TABLE. \n- SETHE WRAPPED IN PAUL'S BIG ARMS AS THEY LAY IN BED. \nSethe rises from the ground, as if with a new realization. She begins to walk out of the clearing and into the woods, her pace increasing with each image.... \nEXT. WOODS - DAY. \nSethe walks through the woods, passing Beloved unawares - who has fallen asleep by a tree. Beloved is awakened as Sethe walks by, and gets to her feet to follow. \nFurther on, Sethe passes a sleeping Denver, who also awakens upon hearing the footsteps of her mother, followed by Beloved. Sethe walks on, unaware of them following her. \n", "test2_true": "Wide angle of Sethe walking well ahead of Beloved and Denver. \nSethe is walking with great purpose and energy. \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY. \nSethe enters and runs through the house to the kitchen; \nSETHE Paul? Paul, you home?... \nPaul sits in a tub under the white staircase. He smiles. \nSethe is relieved...grateful to find him there, for her. \nPAUL Where else would I be on a Sunday off? \nSethe smiles, almost in tears. \nPAUL Why don't you come on in here? \nSETHE Paul D. What if the girls came in? \nPAUL I don't hear nobody. \nSETHE I have to cook. \nPaul D. stands up in the tub and holds Sethe against his wet, naked body. \nPAUL What you gonna cook? \nSETHE (loving his body and his attention) I thought I'd make some snap beans. \nPAUL Oh yeah. \nSETHE Fry up a little corn? \nPAUL Yeah. \nHe kisses her - and that's exactly what she wanted. \nSETHE Oh Paul... \nPAUL I'm right here baby. \nSETHE Thank you Lord. \nCamera slowly moves out of the kitchen as Sethe and Paul begin to make love, revealing; \nBeloved watching from the doorway, unknown to Sethe or Paul. She is disgusted, envious...and runs out.. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY. \nBeloved runs out of the house and heads back for the woods. She passes Denver as if she weren't there. \nEXT. STREAM IN THE WOODS - DAY. \nBeloved reaches the stream and steps in. She begins to violently hit the water around her, then begins hitting her own face and head, clawing at it as if to escape from the boundaries of flesh. Suddenly she submerges herself underwater and holds herself there, as if to drown herself... \nShe bursts out of the water, gasping for air...Slowly, her rage subsides, replaced with a calm, ruthless understanding \nEXT. THE FIELD OF 124 BLUESTONE RD.- DAY. \nBeloved is walking back toward the house. She stops. \nShe looks back at the house to the kitchen window - knowing Paul and Sethe are in there. She approaches the kitchen window and looks in. \nPOV - Sethe is drying off Paul's body and rebuttoning her dress. \nCamera moves slowly into a C.U. of Beloved, this time her focus is on Paul. \nINT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - EVENING. \nThe inhabitants eat dinner in silence. \nDenver awaits a look from Beloved. As Beloved passes her a bowl of peas with a smile, Denver is satisfied. \nBeloved then turns to Paul, offering him the bowl. \nBELOVED You have brothers or sisters? \nCaught off guard, Paul looks to Sethe - whose expression asks him to be nice. \nPAUL We don't talk about that. \nBeat. \nBELOVED Sethe told us you been walking for eighteen years. Where you been all that time? \nPaul is about to get mad when he looks to Sethe again, reels it back in and answers curtly, but politely; \nPAUL Lots of places. I don't remember them all. Don't remember much about anything. \nBELOVED You be surprised what you start remembering once you start talking. \nHearing his own words echoed back to him, annoys him. \nPAUL Well not me. What's gone is gone. No good come from bringing it back. \nPause. Paul focuses on his dinner, suddenly ill at ease. He can't help looking, covertly, at Beloved and finds Beloved staring right back at him...It makes him shiver. \nINT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. \nSethe is asleep. \nPaul is restless - tossing and turning as we Intercut; \nDream Images flashing across his mind... \n- RAIN POURING DOWN A TRENCH. A MUDDY POOL FORMING AROUND A BLACK MAN'S FEET. \n- IRON CHAINS FED INTO METAL ANKLE CUFFS. \n- PAUL D. ON HIS KNEES BEFORE A WHITE GUARD crotch. \n", "test3_input": "SETHE Well say it, Paul D...whether I like it or not. \nPaul knows what she's expecting. And when he sees her diminished expectation, the melancholy without blame in her eyes....he can't tell her about Beloved. He is filled with respect and admiration for her in that moment. Something pops into his head and out of his mouth that wasn't planned; \nPAUL I want you pregnant, Sethe. Would you do that for me? \nSethe breaks up with laughter. Paul joins in. \nSETHE You came by here to ask me that!? You are one crazy-headed man. You right; I don't like it!...Don't you think I'm a little too old to start that all over again? \nShe slips her fingers into his. \nPAUL Think about it. \nPaul lifts them, putting the tips of her fingers on his cheek. He smiles broadly; \nShe laughs, shaking her head. A burden transformed into a gift, so suddenly. They begin walking. \nSethe and Paul catch and snatch each other's fingers, stealing quick pats on the behind, joyfully. Paul throws his arm around Sethe and squeezes. She lets her head touch his chest. They stop and stay that way for a moment - not breathing. Sethe closes her eyes. Paul looks up to the trees lining the roadside like defending arms against attack. Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow. Sethe opens her eyes: \nSETHE Mercy. \nEXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING. \nOn the road towards 124, Paul and Sethe run hand in hand. Snow falling all around them. \nSETHE I been on my feet all day, Paul D. \nPAUL Where I been? Sitting down!? \nSETHE Stop! I don't have the legs for this! \nThey slow to a walk. \nPAUL Then give'em to me. \nBefore she can stop him, Paul hoists Sethe up over his shoulders. \nSETHE You need some babies..somebody to play with in the snow. \nPAUL I sure would like to give it a try. Need a willing partner though. \nSETHE I'll say..Very, very willing. \nThey continue laughing and moving down Bluestone Road when they are jolted by the appearance of; \nBeloved. Waiting in her usual place for Sethe. Her hands wrapped in a long shawl, waiting to be given to Sethe. Her eyes only on Sethe, not even acknowledging Paul's presence. \nSethe gets herself down from Paul. \nSETHE Crazy girl. You out here with nothing on. \nShe takes the shawl from Beloved's hands and wraps it around her shoulders. \nSETHE You got to learn more sense than that. \nShe walks on ahead with Beloved. Paul, suddenly icy cold and filled with anger, walks behind. \nEXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT. \nDenver waits on the porch. Sethe and Beloved walk by her. \nSETHE Evening, girl. \nSethe and Beloved enter the house. As Paul approaches, he stops before Denver. Their eyes meet. Paul stares at her, as if to ask - \"Who's ally are you?\"...Denver, unnerved by his look, runs into the house. Paul waits on the porch until, a moment later, Sethe re-appears. \nSETHE Now I know you not sleeping out there tonight, are you Paul D.? (Paul doesn't reply) You come upstairs tonight. Where you belong...and stay there. \nAs if healed by her strength, Paul's face melts into relief. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT. \nDenver is cleaning the dishes. Beloved sits like an angry, upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth. \nBELOVED She likes him here... (to Denver) Make him go away. \nDENVER She'd be mad if he leaves. \nBeloved didn't consider that. Her fingers move violently in her mouth as if something were bothering her...until, finally, she pulls out a back tooth...her lips slightly bloody. \nDENVER OOoo..didn't that hurt you? \nBELOVED It's like my dreams...I get two dreams, see..One, I exploding...BUUOOGGG...The other I being swallowed. Sometimes it's hard to keep my head on my neck, or these legs connected to my hips...One day I think I might wake up and I'll be in pieces.. (Looks at tooth) Maybe it's starting. \nDENVER (cleans Beloved's mouth) Oh stop. It's just a tooth. Probably wisdom. Does it hurt? \nBELOVED Yes. \nDENVER Then why don't you cry? \nBELOVED What? \nDENVER If it hurts, why don't you cry? \nBeloved, eases herself into Denver's arms, and cries... \nEXT. WINDOW OF 124 - NIGHT. \nWe see Sethe and Paul united as the snow begins to pile up. \nINT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT. \nSethe lies with Paul, in the dark, her face looking up to the ceiling. Paul is asleep. \nOn her face are reservations. She rises, crossing to the window to look out. \nAt the same time, Beloved appears silently at the doorway of the room, looking at Sethe - hurt and sad. She walks by without Sethe noticing her. \nSethe takes a breath at the window, watching the snow fall. Then, as she moves back to the bed,... \nCamera moves ahead of her to: \nA DIFFERENT BED IN WHICH HALLE IS TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP. A YOUNGER SETHE CRAWLS IN BESIDE HIM. \nWE ARE IN MEMORY; \n", "test3_true": "Sethe, Halle and the baby girl (Beloved) sleep together by the wall. The boys sleep together under a window.  Halle is trying to sleep but Sethe is awake... \nSETHE What you think about Schoolteacher? \nHALLE He white, ain't he? \nSETHE I mean, is he different like Mr. Garner was? \nHALLE How was he different? \nSETHE Well, he and Mrs. Garner - they ain't like other whites I seen before. Mr. Garner always spoke soft, for one. Mrs. Garner too. \nHALLE Don't matter. Loud or soft, what they say is the same. \nSETHE Mr. Garner let you buy out your mother. Found that house for her to live in from those friends of his in Ohio... \nHALLE Yep. He did. \nSETHE Well? \nHALLE If he hadn't, she would have dropped in his cooking stove. \nSETHE Still, he did it. Let you work off her fee, lending yourself out on Sundays. He could of said no. He didn't tell you no. \nHALLE No, he didn't tell me no. She worked here ten years. If she worked another ten, ya think she would have made it? I pay him for her last years and in return he got you, me and three more coming.. \nSETHE He always treated you fair. Called you all men - said he never wanted niggers on his farm. \nHALLE That's just it. We was men because he said so. We was men because we was on his land. You think he be calling us men if we ever walked off his land? \nSETHE When we walk, don't matter what they call you. You'll be free. \nHALLE Sethe..baby girl, that ain't gonna happen. Not by walking, anyway. \nSETHE What you mean? \nHALLE Schoolteacher in there told me to quit lending myself out. \nThat phrase \"..while the boys is small\"..causes Sethe to look at her sleeping boys.. \nSETHE But..then..how you gonna buy yourself out? Or them? (points to the children) Or me? \nHalle raises himself up to face her, to give her the final blow. \nHALLE Ain't gonna be no buying us out, like I did with mama. Or them. As far as Schoolteacher concerned, ain't no other life ahead for any of us but this one. \nSethe understands, looks to her sleeping children and is frightened. \nSETHE Halle....what we going to do? \nHALLE (whispers) Sixo, ya know he creeps out at night..he says the way they took my ma'am..he says freedom is that way. He and Paul A. got a plan.  They heard of this man, what they call an underground agent...if we do what he says, don't need no buy out. \nSETHE You mean...? But what if we caught? What'd they do to us? To the children? \nHALLE Same thing they're doing now, honey - only quicker. \nEXT. SWEET HOME - A DAY REMEMBERED. \nSethe carries a big basket of berries as young Howard and Bulgar run ahead of her. She turns in the opposite direction and walks along the side of the house to the back entrance of the kitchen. \nShe passes the open window of the classroom and hears; \nSCHOOLTEACHER (OS) Which one are you doing? \nBOY (OS) Sethe? \nHearing her name, Sethe stops and peeks through the window. \nSchoolteacher is standing over the student, who has been writing in a notebook. Schoolteacher licks his finger and thumbs a couple of pages before saying; \nSCHOOLTEACHER No, no. That's not the way. I told you to put her human characteristics on the left; her animal ones on the right. And don't forget to line them up. \nAlthough Sethe doesn't entirely understand, something about the words disturb her. She looks to her children. \nINT. MRS. GARNER'S BEDROOM - A DAY REMEMBERED. \nMrs. Garner is sick in bed with a goiter. Sethe enters with some soup. \nMRS. GARNER I don't think I can swallow that. Too thick. I'm sure it's too thick. \nSETHE Want me to loosen it up with a little water? \nMRS. GARNER No. Take it away. Bring me some cool water, that's all. \nSETHE Yes ma'am... \nSethe helps her drink a glass of cold water. \nMRS. GARNER Yes, you can have quite a few. (drinks) Mmmm. Thank you Sethe. Now tell me, I know Halle's no trouble but the others, the Pauls and Sixo - how's my brother-in- law handling them? All right? \nSETHE Yes Ma'am. Look like it. \nMRS. GARNER They do what he tells them? \nSETHE They don't need telling. \nMRS. GARNER Good. That's a mercy. I know he's no Mr. Garner. But after he died, I had no else to turn to. I would've had to sell one. It wasn't even enough selling Paul F. And in my condition. I needed help. People said I shouldn't be alone here with nothing but Negroes. And he is a learned man being a schoolteacher... \nAs Sethe fills Mrs. Garner's basin with fresh water, she looks out the window and sees: \nSCHOOLTEACHER outside with his students, we notice HE WEARS A VERY DISTINCTIVE HAT as Mrs. Garners description continues; \nMRS. GARNER ...I know his ways might be a little more strict but as long as the men do as they're told I'm sure it'll be fine. All right, I'm through.. Talking makes me tired. \nSETHE Yes ma'am. \nINT. BARN - A NIGHT REMEMBERED. \nSethe lies beaten and raped, her clothes torn, her body aching and sweaty. She struggles to get to her feet and exit the barn. \nINT. HALLE AND SETHE'S LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT. \nSethe opens the door to find her children asleep. She is about to wake them when; \n"}

BOB (To Waiter) So what's a useful phrase? 
KUWAIT WAITER La termi, ana sahafi. Bob repeats this. 
BOB What's that mean? 
KUWAIT WAITER Don't shoot, I'm a reporter. He walks off. Bob sighs, continues DOODLING in his notebook. We see he has covered the page in stylized drawings of EYES. He notices a A MAN IN A BASEBALL CAP sitting at the next table. 
BOB 
(SHYLY) Hey. 
MAN (without looking up) Hey. Bob reads the logo on the baseball cap. 
BOB DeWitt Resources. Arkansas. 
MAN 
(BEAT) Right. We make trash cans. 
BOB You over here for the conference? Looking for a contract right?

MAN I guess. 
BOB What's your pitch? The man considers this. He looks up and we see his face for the first time - handsome, older than Bob, tanned, a moustache, a slightly haunted expression. This is LYN 
CASSADY. 
MAN Well...we're real cheap. Bob waits for more, but that's it. He holds out his hand. 
BOB Bob Wilton. 
LYN CASSADY 
(SHAKING) Skip. 
BOB Could I bum a smoke, Skip? Lyn shoves the packet across the table. Bob sits down across from him, pats himself down for a lighter, glances over to where the two embedded Journalists are joking with some Marines. Bob watches them jealously. 
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) I sat there watching those reporters and realized I didn't want to be me anymore. I wanted to be them. I wanted to face peril and stand witness to the fall and rise of nations. Suddenly the TERRACE LIGHT above them flickers and goes out. Lyn and Bob sit in the dark. 
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) Everyone gets everything he wants. Like the man said. I wanted a mission. 
BOB (CONT'D) (patting his pockets in the dark) Oh crap, can't find my... A LIGHTER ignites in Lyn's hand, eerily lighting the lower half of his face, his eyes hidden by the brim of the cap. Bob leans forward to light his cigarette and finds himself staring at the CONFERENCE I.D Lyn has pinned to his shirt. The name on the badge reads LYN S. 
CASSADY. 
(CONTINUED) 
15   CONTINUED: (2)                                           15 
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) And for my sins, Fate brought me one. He stares at the name as he puffs on the cigarette, vaguely troubled by a memory. 
BOB (CONT'D) 
(SUDDENLY) Lyn Cassady...? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
16   EXT. GUS LACEY'S HOUSE- MICHIGAN - DAY - THE PAST        16 
Bob pulls up in a car outside. SUPERED TITLES READ: Monroe, Michigan, 1997 
GUS LACEY (O.S.) This is the home learning course we're putting out, which is very popular. 
17   INT. GUS LACEY'S HOUSE - DAY                             17 
Bob is interviewing Gus Lacey at Lacey's dining room table. Gus has a sun-bed tan and odd hair. His nervous looking MOTHER sits beside them. Gus is holding up a VIDEO CASE for Bob to see - the cover, illustrated with a picture of Gus, reads "Free To Roam - Learn E.S.P from the master!" 
GUS LACEY Then there's the seminars. When I'm not teaching I spend a lotta time, right here, remote viewing.

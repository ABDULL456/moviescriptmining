{"test1_input": "HENRI I need to tell you something. In case I die. (off Isabelle's look) Your grandmother is the Wolf. Isabelle recoils in disbelief. She shakes her head. \nISABELLE The Wolf is a man. It told me. \nHENRI You believe it? Isabelle hesitates. He has a point. Henri peers out. The Soldiers are closing in on them... \nHENRI They're coming. \nISABELLE Follow me. She takes his hand and leads him away. \nEXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT \nIsabelle knocks at the door. Roxanne answers. She gives Isabelle a stunned look. \nISABELLE We need to come inside. Quickly. \nINT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT \nIsabelle and Henri enter. Roxanne shuts the door. Marguerite gasps when she sees Isabelle. \nMARGUERITE Have you lost your mind? If they find her here, they'll kill us, too! \nROXANNE Then shut up so they don't find her. \nHENRI We have to get out of town. \nROXANNE You'll never make it. You can hide here until morning. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nISABELLE They're searching everywhere. We have to keep moving. \nROXANNE You might make it to the church. Even the king cannot violate the protection of sanctuary. \nHENRI And the Wolf cannot cross onto holy ground. The three exchange a look. Sounds like a plan. \nISABELLE Can we go out your back window? Roxanne nods. They hurry toward the window, but then: \nROXANNE Wait! I have an idea. \nEXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT \nA group of Villagers walks by. As they do, the Reeve hears something coming from behind the cottage... \nHENRI (O.S.) Come on! The Reeve follows the voice and sees two figures that look like Henri and Isabelle climb out the back window. \nREEVE They're here! Over here! The two figures run and the Villagers chase after them. \nEXT. VILLAGE - FIELD - NIGHT \nHenri and Isabelle hide behind a shed, just as the Villagers appear and spread out, trying to find them. Henri turns to Isabelle... only it's not Isabelle. It's Roxanne wearing Isabelle's clothes. \nHENRI Can you keep going? \nROXANNE I can if you can. They run off, chased by the Villagers. \nEXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT \nIsabelle climbs out the back window undetected, dressed in Roxanne's clothes. The coast is clear. She runs off. \nEXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT \nIsabelle can see the church steeple over the rooftops and races toward it. But then she hears a low GROWL ahead of her. Dark eyes peer from an open barn door. She turns and runs down an alley. The Wolf chases after her. As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly appears in front of her, blocking her path. She races back the way she came, then darts into a gap between two outbuildings, barely big enough for her to pass through, too narrow for the Wolf to follow. But as she runs, she hears a LOUD CLAMORING above her. The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the buildings. It's right over her. It shoves its head through the narrow space above her, SNAPPING its jaws, but can't quite reach her. Then suddenly -- -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the narrow space. But Isabelle slips through, emerges from between the buildings, and is startled by a VOICE: \nCAPTAIN (O.S.) There! The Captain is pointing at her. He has another Soldier with him. Isabelle runs. They chase after her... ... just as the Wolf frees itself. From the rooftop, it sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle. It races after them, running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage. Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall. There's firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle quickly scrabbles up it, but at the last second -- -- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle. She grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go. Then she jumps down to the other side. The other Soldier starts to climb after her, but is suddenly lifted right off his feet. The Captain looks up. The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has picked the Soldier up in its jaws. It glares down at the Captain. It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a dirty sock. The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a moment too long and then the Wolf is on him. \nEXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "SOLOMON At least you won't die alone now. Your friends will all hang with you. Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father Solomon turns. Isabelle cranes her neck and sees... the Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of. Solomon picks up his sword and stands to face it. \nSOLOMON If you come for her, you come through me. The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises his sword. Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the square, followed by a group of Villagers. \nSOLOMON Stay back! Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch, breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another. Solomon's sword starts to tremble. Sweat breaks out on his brow. The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer. Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges. The Wolf leaps at him. Solomon raises his sword... ... and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist. Solomon screams. The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy -- -- biting off Solomon's hand. The hand falls into the snow, still clutching the silver sword. Solomon cries out in agony. The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS. \nTHE WOLF There is your mighty werewolf hunter. Who will save you now? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Isabelle trembles. The Wolf slowly steps toward her, menacing... and is struck in the head with a rock. The Wolf stops, surprised to find Henri standing in its way. Henri picks up another rock and throws it. \nHENRI You bastard! You killed my father! \nISABELLE Henri, what are you doing? \nHENRI I'm not letting it take you. He throws another rock and another. One hits the Wolf in the eye, tearing a gash in its face. The Wolf GROWLS. \nHENRI Look! It bleeds! We can kill it if we stand together! The Villagers waver. Henri beseeches them: \nHENRI Father Solomon was one man. His soldiers were mercenaries. But we are a village! The Wolf SNARLS at him, but comes no closer. \nISABELLE He's right. It's a coward at heart. Look at it. Why doesn't it attack? The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it. \nMERCHANT You killed my daughter! Then another Villager joins them. The Wolf looks around. Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it. It's surrounded. And not by a dozen soldiers, but by a solid wall of angry, determined men and women. The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and farm implements. It snaps and SNARLS at its attackers, but there are too many of them. Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in agony. It lurches around, biting at the spear, but can't reach it. Then Henri sees something in the snow... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) Solomon's sword. He pries it out of Solomon's severed hand and turns to face the Wolf, the angry Villagers gathered behind them. The Wolf trembles, blood dripping from its many wounds... then it turns to Isabelle. \nTHE WOLF I will come for you again. And with that, it turns and flees into the night. The Villagers CHEER. The Reeve chases after it and the rest of the angry mob follows him. Henri turns to Isabelle. \nHENRI Are you all right? Isabelle nods, shaky. Then... \nSOLOMON (O.S.) This isn't over. They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump. \nSOLOMON I am bitten. Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri walks over to Solomon, sword in hand. Solomon crosses himself and closes his eyes, unafraid. Roxanne turns away. Isabelle doesn't. Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as Solomon's head hits the snow. Henri throws the sword aside. Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder. \nINT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY \nIsabelle awakens in her bed. She looks around. She's still dressed in Roxanne's clothes from the night before. \nINT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY \nIsabelle enters to find Suzette putting food in a basket. Suzette stops when she sees Isabelle and gives her a hug. \nISABELLE It's past noon. \nSUZETTE I know. I didn't want to wake you. Isabelle smiles up at her. The wounds on Suzette's face are still bad, but healing. She's scarred for life. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nISABELLE Where's Father? \nSUZETTE He'll be home soon. They have no reason to hold him any longer. \nISABELLE Did they catch the Wolf? \nSUZETTE No. They lost it in the forest. This gives Isabelle pause. A beat. Then: \nISABELLE What about Grandmother? Suzette hesitates. Isabelle is suddenly concerned. \nSUZETTE Roxanne came by. She said your grandmother has fallen ill. I was hoping you could look in on her. Off Isabelle's troubled look... \nEXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY \nIsabelle walks through the village wearing Lucie's red riding hood and carrying a basket of food. People lower their eyes as she passes. She spots Prudence gossiping with Lucrece. Prudence sees her, then looks away. The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog. It playfully follows Isabelle along the path, but stops as she enters the dark, fog-shrouded forest... \n", "test1_id": 285, "test2_input": "EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAY \nIsabelle walks through the snow. A thick fog gives the forest a strange, dream-like feeling. A cold wind blows. Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her. She stops and turns. Slowly, a figure appears. It's Peter. \nPETER Thank God you're all right. He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away. A beat. \nISABELLE I'm fine. You sent Henri to help me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPETER What did he tell you? Isabelle gives him a hurt look. \nISABELLE Those people back there. I know they mean well, but they're just people. I didn't expect anything from them. I expected something from you. \nPETER I just need to talk to you. \nISABELLE I'm going to see my Grandmother. She's sick. Please don't follow me. Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there, watching her go. When she looks back, he's gone. She sighs, wiping tears from her eyes. She continues on... Then: FOOTSTEPS behind her again. She stops and looks back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows her in the fog. She walks faster. She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision. She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main path, she throws the branch aside... ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks ominous. She gives it a wary look, then starts walking. \nEXT. GULLY - DAY \nIsabelle reaches the rope bridge. More of the rotten boards have fallen out during the winter. Isabelle looks down. It's a long drop to the river below. She edges out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards, holding onto the rope with both hands... Suddenly -- CRACK! A board SNAPS under her weight. At the last instant, she regains her balance. The broken board SPLASHES into the water. She takes a moment to catch her breath before continuing... \nEXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK \nIsabelle crosses the little bridge and knocks on the front door. The fog still hangs over everything. She doesn't notice the dark stain under her feet... \nISABELLE Grandmother? Are you awake? She listens at the door. A long beat. Then: \nTHE FIGURE (O.S.) Pull the bobbin. The latch will open. We recognize the thin, raspy voice. Isabelle hesitates, then pulls the bobbin and opens the door... \nINT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - DUSK \nThe Reeve and a GUARD examine something O.S. \nREEVE You're certain nobody has seen him since last night? \nGUARD The Wolf must have taken him. What else could have done that? They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up. The metal door has been ripped off its hinges... \nINT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK \nIsabelle closes the door. A pot is cooking over the fire. The cat lounges in its heat, grooming itself. It looks up at Isabelle as she enters. Isabelle stops. The veil that has always been closed is now open. Beyond it, we see Grandmother propped up in bed. The light is too dim to see her very well, just a candle by her bed. She's wearing a nightgown and cap. She doesn't move. \nTHE FIGURE I've been expecting you. Isabelle starts toward the bedroom with the basket... \nISABELLE Mother sent some food. There are cakes and a pot of butter -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHE FIGURE Don't come in here. Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in darkness. Isabelle gives her a questioning look. \nTHE FIGURE I'm not hungry right now. \nISABELLE Are you sure? You sound so weak. \nTHE FIGURE I just made myself a stew. I left it over the fire for you. Isabelle glances back at the pot BUBBLING over the fire. \nISABELLE I came here to take care of you. Not the other way around. \nTHE FIGURE Don't be silly, my dear. You've been through so much. Sit down. Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's knitting needles sticking out of it. \nTHE FIGURE There's no burden so heavy that it doesn't seem a little lighter on a full stomach. \nISABELLE \n(SMILES) You always say that. She ladles some soup into a bowl and sits down. The cat looks up from its grooming, watching her... \n", "test2_true": "ISABELLE I've been worried about you. When you didn't come back yesterday, I was afraid... \n(BEAT) You were wrong about Henri. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTHE FIGURE Was I now? \nISABELLE Yes. He saved my life. Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses. She puts the bowl down and loosens her collar... \nISABELLE I feel hot all of a sudden. \nTHE FIGURE It's just the stew warming you. Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a closer look at the cat. There's blood on its paw. That's what it has been licking this whole time. Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint. She breaks out in a sweat. She looks at the soup. A thick broth with chunks of white meat... \nISABELLE What is this...? \nTHE FIGURE If you don't like it, there's wine on the table to wash it down. Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and pours herself a cup. She takes a sip... and freezes. It's not wine. It's blood. She gags and drops the cup, spilling blood everywhere. The cat jumps away. She looks at the bottle, turns it over. More blood pours out. Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the pot and spilling the soup. The Figure laughs. \nTHE FIGURE Oh, what pretty red lips. Come and give your Granny a kiss, my dear. \nISABELLE I don't think I want to. \nTHE FIGURE Then I will come to you. And with that -- Grandmother slowly starts to move. She groans. She's hurt. She stands up. She's much taller now than she was. As Isabelle watches in mute dread, the Figure pulls off Grandmother's nightgown and cap, hobbles into the firelight, revealing its face... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) It's Cesaire. Isabelle quickly stands, startled. \nISABELLE What is this? Where's Grandmother? \nCESAIRE I'm afraid I ate most of her. \n(BEAT) You ate the rest. Isabelle gives the spilled stew on the floor a horrified look. For a moment, she looks like she may pass out. \nCESAIRE I didn't want to kill her. But she finally realized what I was. \nEXT. CREEK - DAWN (FLASHBACK) \nCesaire bathes in a cold stream... \nCESAIRE (V.O.) The hardest thing to hide has always been the smell. The werewolf musk is strong, especially close to the full moon. \nEXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nThe night of the wolf hunt. Henri crouches in the woods, clutching his hammer... then freezes with terror. He sees the Wolf slink by in the dark, dragging Adrien along by his throat. It happened just as Henri said it did. \nCESAIRE (V.O.) Henri smelled it the night he saw me. And he recognized the smell later. \nEXT. STABLE - DUSK (FLASHBACK) \nGrandmother's confrontation with Henri. She stumbles outside and practically runs right into Cesaire... \nCESAIRE (V.O.) He thought it was your Grandmother. He didn't know he was smelling me. But she did. She'd lived with the smell her whole life, she just had no way of knowing what it was. \nINT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nGrandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets. \nCESAIRE (V.O.) Once she realized what it was, of course, she knew the truth. She tried to sneak a message to Father Auguste last night. \nEXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nCesaire carries the blankets back to the cart. He quickly looks inside them and finds a note: '\u009cMEUS FILIUS EST LUPUS.'\u009d Subtitle: '\u009cMy son is the wolf.'\u009d \nCESAIRE (V.O.) Luckily, she'd taught me how to read. \nBACK TO SCENE Isabelle shakes her head, tears streaming down her face. \n", "test2_id": 286, "test3_input": "CESAIRE (V.O.) You were so beautiful. So kind. And I knew you were mine. That's why you could understand me when no one else could. You were mine. \nINT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT \nCesaire takes Isabelle's hand and won't let it go. She backs into the wall. He looms over her... \nCESAIRE Do you see now? This is your heritage. This is what you are. Everything I have done has been to insure the future of our bloodline. We will run together \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCESAIRE (CONT'D) like my father and I once did. You are the next generation. You have had your first taste of human flesh. Now one bite from me is all that is needed to change you. It will only hurt for a moment. And then you will be as I am. \nISABELLE There must indeed be a God. For you are surely the Devil... \nCESAIRE I will give you a choice. Come with me now. Or refuse me and let your friends suffer in your place. I will kill them one by one. Your mother. Roxanne. Peter. Isabelle shudders. She slowly pulls away and he releases her. She walks over to the table, her back to him. She eyes the ball of yarn with Grandmother's knitting needles in it. A long beat. Isabelle chokes back tears. \nISABELLE Father...? He approaches her. Stands behind her and places his hand on her shoulder. Her skin crawls. \nCESAIRE Yes, my dear? \nISABELLE You gave me two choices. She turns to face him. Looks up at him. \nISABELLE But I have thought of a third. Suddenly -- CRUNCH! Isabelle drives something hard into Cesaire's jaw. He gasps, choking. He puts his had to his throat. Blood spills out through his fingers. CAMERA FINDS Grandmother's ball of yarn on the table. The knitting needles aren't sticking out of it anymore... They're sticking out of Cesaire's neck. He falls to his knees, gagging. Then he flops over dead. Eyes open. Isabelle gazes down at him. She looks like she might have just lost her mind. Then she sits on the floor, staring at his body... and screams. An eruption of rage, betrayal, and heartbreak. She screams. \nEXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT \nThe cottage is dark and quiet. \nINT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT \nIt's pitch black in here. There's a KNOCK at the door. \nPETER (O.S.) Hello? No response. The door CREAKS open. It's Peter. As he opens the door, moonlight spills inside to reveal Isabelle huddled and trembling in the corner. She's screamed and cried herself out. All that's left is anger and a grim resolve. She did what she had to do. \nINT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER) \nIsabelle and Peter sit at the table. A dim candle provides the only light. A long beat. \nISABELLE People should know what he was. \nPETER We can't tell anyone. If they don't believe you, they'll hang you for this. And if they do believe you, they'll hang you for being the daughter of the Wolf. \nISABELLE Then I'll run away. I was ready to run away last night. \n(BEAT) Why didn't you come for me? Peter gives her a long look. But instead of speaking, he rolls up his sleeve. Isabelle's eyes go wide. There's a huge scar on his arm. In the shape of a bite mark. \nPETER I was bitten at the festival. I spent last night in the woods because I was afraid of what might happen... \n(A BEAT) I changed. I'm like him now. \nISABELLE No, you're not. You could never be like him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Isabelle's tears fall, the full implications of what he's saying starting to sink in. He takes her hand. \nPETER I can't stay here. \nISABELLE Yes, you can. We can still be together. My father lived here. My grandfather lived here. \nPETER Your father and your grandfather killed people. They couldn't help themselves. If I stay here, I won't be able to control myself. (off her look) I have to be alone. Isabelle rests her head on his and they just sit like that, leaning against one another in the candlelight... \nINT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER) \nIsabelle and Peter crouch next to Cesaire's body. The candle is on the floor, casting weird shadows. \n", "test3_true": "ISABELLE I don't want him ever found. \nPETER We'll weight him with rocks. \nISABELLE No. We'll put the rocks inside him. (off his look) Cut him open. I will sew the rocks inside him. Peter is taken aback. She's serious. \nINT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER) \nPeter and Isabelle have placed several heavy rocks next to Cesaire's body. Peter opens Cesaire's shirt and takes out a hunting knife. Isabelle gives Peter a nod. Peter somewhat reluctantly lowers the knife, his shoulder moving up and down as he goes about his unseen task... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Moments later, Isabelle threads a needle and coldly stitches begins stitching. We don't see what she's doing, but there's blood on her needle and thread. There's a spot of blood on her cheek, too. \nEXT. RIVER - FERRY DOCK - NIGHT \nLow mist hugs the ground. There's a wooden A-frame pontoon raft tied to a ferry dock. A guy-rope runs through the A-frame to a pier on the opposite shore. Isabelle and Peter nervously approach. He pushes a wheelbarrow onto the raft, its contents wrapped in burlap. Peter unties the moorings and is about to shove off, but Isabelle stops him: \nISABELLE Wait. She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body. His belly is lumpy and misshapen, an ugly red line in his torso stitched together with black thread. The knitting needles still jut out of his jaw. Isabelle yanks them out, then pulls the burlap back over Cesaire's body. Peter gives her a questioning look. \nISABELLE These belonged to my grandmother. The knitting needles are covered in blood. Peter takes out a rag and wipes the blood off for her. And as he does... something begins to shine through in the moonlight. Peter gives Isabelle a stunned look. \nPETER They're silver. \nEXT. RIVER - NIGHT \nPeter uses a long pole to push the raft across the water. Isabelle gazes out at the moonlit mist. They stop the in the middle of the river. They exchange a look... ... then each take a side of the wheelbarrow and dump the body into the water. It sinks instantly and is gone. \nPETER Death was too good for him. \nISABELLE I can live with it. \nEXT. RIVER - OPPOSITE BANK - NIGHT \nIsabelle and Peter stand on the shore. He kisses her and she holds his face in her hands, wanting the kiss to last forever. When they part, she gives him an aching look. \nISABELLE Where will you go? \nPETER I don't know. I need to understand what I've become. Maybe I can learn to control it. (off her look) I'll take my own life before I take another's. \nISABELLE I know. \nPETER I'm not coming back. I don't want you to wait for me. This is the last time you'll ever see me. \nISABELLE No, it isn't. You'll be in my dreams until the day I die. Peter turns and starts to walk away. But then he pauses. \nPETER You know, Henri is a good man. \nISABELLE Yes, he is. Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog. CAMERA PUSHES IN on Isabelle as she watches him go... \nOLD WOMAN (V.O.) I never saw him again. \nEXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY \nSPRINGTIME. The leaves have returned to the forest with explosions of green. Crops grow in the fields. Flowers bloom. The village is vibrant with life and beauty. \nOLD WOMAN (V.O.) Life in my village was changed forever. There were many questions and few answers. In the \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOLD WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) end, the Wolf did not return.

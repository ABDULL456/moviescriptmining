Joe should leave -- Ratso obviously has nothing tangible to offer -- but Joe hesitates, lighting a cigarette as Ratso pulls on his loafers. 
RATSO How do you like that O'Daniel, flipping out like that? I wanted to get in touch with you when I heard, but I been laid up with this cold... 
Ratso touches his chest, forcing a cough which continues itself beyond his intention. 
JOE You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night. 
RATSO Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel? 
INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY 
The black and white suitcase lies open on the bed. 
INT. NEDICK'S - DAY 
Joe turns abruptly and walks away. 
JOE Shee-it. I got better things to do than talk to you. 
EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY 
Joe strides north, pretending he doesn't hear... 
RATSO'S VOICE Hey, wait up, for crissake! 
... Ratso hop-skipping to overtake Joe at the traffic light. 
JOE Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed! 
RATSO I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit. 
JOE You inviting shee-it. 
EXT. TENEMENT STREET - DAY 
A contractor's sign announces LUXURY APARTMENTS AVAILABLE in high-rise co-op, under construction beyond a raw of tenements with X's taped on the windows. Ratso's voice continues over the click-clack-click of Joe's boots and the flip-flap-squeak of Ratso's loafers as camera moves toward a condemned building. 
RATSO'S VOICE The X on the window means the landlord can't collect rent -- which is a convenience, hey? -- on account of it's condemned. 
INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY 
Footsteps climb past rubbish piled outside empty flats. 
RATSO'S VOICE The electric's off. Another convenience. I don't mess with Con Edison, hey? What the hell, I got candles, right? 
INT. X FLAT - DAY 
Light from the X window shines on a Florida tourist poster as Ratso leads Joe into an abandoned tub-in-kitchen flat, barely furnished with a table and chair, a rumple of blankets on a burnt-out mattress. 
RATSO I got no heat, but by that time, you know, cold weather, hey, I'll be in Florida. Stretch out. Make yourself comfortable. You hungry? I'll put up some water for coffee. 
Ratso fills a saucepan from the tub-sink, sets it on a Sterno stove. Joe sits himself on the mattress-bed, pretending to test it, weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him suddenly, his only immediate problem being the effort to restrain a large, comfortable yawn. 
JOE Comfortable, kee-rist, I slept on subways softer than this. 
Joe stretches himself, yawning, his eyelids drooping heavily. The sounds of the city recede. Joe's love theme plays softly on a distant radio. Joe's eyes close momentarily in spite of him elf. 
INT. REMEMBERED CAR - ANOTHER TIME 
A vintage dashboard, radio dial glowing, Anastasia's face. 
ANASTASIA Love me, Joe?

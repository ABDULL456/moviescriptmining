BOYS Hello. How do you do? 
NEIL Hello. 
GLORIA Hi. Hi. 
CHARLIE Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's Friday night. Let's get on with the meeting. 
The boys move aside to let the girls in. 
BOYS Sorry. Excuse- Excuse me. 
CHARLIE Guys, I have an announcement to make. In keeping with the spirit of passionate experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From now on, call me Nuwanda. 
PITTS (laughing) Nuwanda? 
NEIL Nuwanda? 
Tina takes out a tube of red lipstick. Charlie takes it from her and puts red marks on each of his cheeks. 
INT. CHET'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Knox enters the house and looks anxiously about. 
KNOX Hello? Hello, Chris? 
Knox stops and combs his hair in the hallway mirror. Chris comes running out from one of the rooms. 
CHRIS Knox! 
KNOX Hi. 
CHRIS You made it. Great! Bring anybody? 
KNOX No. 
Chris grabs Knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walks toward the stairs. 
CHRIS No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have to go find Chet. Why don't you go downstairs where everybody is? 
Chris runs up the stairs as Knox stares after her. 
CHRIS Make yourself at home. 
KNOX But I-- 
INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
Knox stares at a couple kissing passionately. Across the room he sees Chet and Chris dancing. He walks away. 
INT. CHET'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Knox enters the kitchen, walking between several football players to fill up a mug of beer from a keg. 
STEVE Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba, this guy look like Mutt Sanders to you or what? 
Bubba spits ice cubes into the sink. 
BUBBA You're his brother? 
KNOX No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, guys. 
BUBBA (obviously drunk) Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders' brother, we don't even offer him a drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal. 
Bubba hands Knox a glass and fills it up. 
STEVE Yeah. 
KNOX Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- 
BUBBA To Mutt. 
STEVE To Mutt. 
The two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly joins them. 
KNOX To Mutt. 
They each take a big drink. Knox rolls his eyes and gasps, loosening his tie to try and breathe.

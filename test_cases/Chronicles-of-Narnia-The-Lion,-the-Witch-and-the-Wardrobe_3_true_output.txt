MR BEAVER Well you never know what meal is gonna be your last, especially with your cooking. 
SUSAN if mum knew what we were doing... 
PETER Mum's not here!!! 
LUCY (sees wolves) Oh no! 
PETER Run!!!!! 
Wolves leap infront of them, growling & sneering... 
MAUGRIM Put that down boy, someone might get hurt. 
MR. BEAVER (pinned down) Don't worry about me! Slit his throat! 
MAUGRIM Leave now while you can, and you're brother leaves with you. 
SUSAN Stop Peter, maybe we should listen to him! 
MAUGRIM Smart girl. 
MR. BEAVER Don't listen to him. Kill him. Kill him now! 
SUSAN Look, just because some man in a red suit hands you a sword doesn't make you a hero! So just drop it! 
BEAVER No Peter! Narnia need ya! 
MAUGRIM What's it gonna be Son of Adam? We're not going to wait for ever. And neither is the river. 
LUCY PETER!!!! 
PETER Hold onto me! 
Stabs sword into the ice, and they float away... 
They get to shore. Peter has Lucy's coat in hand, but no Lucy. 
SUSAN What have you done?!

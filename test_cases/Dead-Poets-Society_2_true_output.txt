STEVE Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh? 
KNOX I don't really know Mutt. 
BUBBA To Mighty Mutt. 
GUY 1 To Mighty Mutt. 
KNOX To Mighty Mutt. 
They raise their glasses again for a toast and down the rest of their glasses. 
BUBBA Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say hello to Mutt for me, okay? 
KNOX Will do. 
Bubba puts on a horned football helmet and walks away. 
STEVE Yeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt. 
INT. CAVE - NIGHT 
CHARLIE We gonna have a meeting or what? 
GLORIA Yeah. If you guys don't have a meeting, how do we know if we wanna join? 
NEIL Join? 
Charlie leans over to Tina. 
CHARLIE "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate." 
TINA That's so sweet. 
CHARLIE I made that up just for you. 
TINA You did? 
The boys laugh and Cameron shakes his head. Charlie moves over to sit next to Gloria. 
CHARLIE I'll write one for you too, Gloria. She walks in beauty like the night. She walks in beauty like the night. Of cloudless climes and starry skies. All that's best, dark and bright, Meet in her aspect and her eyes. 
GLORIA That's beautiful. 
CHARLIE There's plenty more where that came from. 
INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
The room is whirling as Knox belches and staggers across the room. He passes Chet and several of his friends. He steps over several couples kissing on the floor and slump down on the couch, only to be crowded in by another couple who seem oblivious to him. He is about to get up again when he notices Chris sleeping next to him on the couch. 
KNOX God help me. 
Knox looks about and then looks back down at Chris. 
KNOX Carpe diem. 
Knox takes a last swig of his drink  and then begins to softly run his fingers over Chris' hair. He then leans over and kisses her forehead. Across the room, Bubba looks over and sees what's going on. 
BUBBA Chet! Chet! Look! 
CHET What? 
BUBBA It's Mutt Sanders' brother. 
CHET Huh? 
Chris rises up from the couch and looks at Knox in surprise. 
CHRIS Knox, what-- 
BUBBA And he's feeling up your girl! 
CHRIS What are you doing? 
Chet gets up from his chair. 
CHET What the hell are you doing? 
CHRIS Chet! Chet, don't.

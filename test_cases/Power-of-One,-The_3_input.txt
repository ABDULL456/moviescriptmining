DOC Again it begins. The stupidity. Do not be frightened. 
Doc puts na arm around PK's shoulder, drawing him close, comforting him. One of the soldiers pulls a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket as he advances. 
CUT TO: 
51   EXT. BARBERTON PRISON                                      51 
A car pulls up. Doc, in shackles, is escorted from the car. PK exits after him. Two guards lead Doc toward the doorway to the prison, a square in the looming gates. Doc walks, his head held high. PK walks alongside holding his hand. 
BRITISH OFFICER (V.O.) Karl von Vollensteen, for the failure to register as an alien during times of war in accordance with His Majesty's government orders to do so, you are hereby sentenced to be confined at Barberton prison for the duration of the war with Germany. 
At the door a guard touches PK's   shoulder, holding him back. The door opens. Doc goes     through. Just before the door closes he looks back at   PK one last time. The door slams shut. PK, with tears    streaming down his cheeks, is left outside. 
CUT TO: 
52   INT. PK'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     52 
Morrie lies in bed, asleep.   PK sits up at his desk, writing. PK (V.O.) And again I was alone with nothing to depend on to see me through except the power of one. 
PK puts down his pen and sits, regarding the pages. He raises his eyes to a photo on the desk of a boy on a rock. 
PK smiles at hidden memories, caps his fountain pen, turns off the light. The room is pitched into darkness. 
CUT TO: 
53   EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY - AFTERNOON                            53 
The seedy side of town. PK carrying a gym bag and Morrie looking a bit out of place in their school blazers come striding up the alley. 
MORRIE Look, even if the scholarship doesn't come through, my old man said he'd lend you the money. 
PK Morrie. 
MORRIE All right. All right. We'll call it the 'Levy Carpet Emporium Scholarship for Poor but Proud Christian Gentlemen.' How's that? 
PK Tell your father I appreciate the offer. MORRIE God, I hate people who can't be bought. 
PK Why is that? 
MORRIE I don't know.    Personality disorder. 
PK nods in agreement. 
PK Undoubtedly. 
The boys come to their destination marked by a rickety, faded sign: "GOLDMAN'S GYM." Excitement shines in PK's eyes. He bounds up the narrow flight of stairs. 
CUT TO: 
54   INT. STAIRCASE                                            54 
Morrie and PK rush up the stairs, stop at the landing, and collect themselves before opening the door to the gym. They take a breath and enter. 
CUT TO: 
55   INT. GYM                                                  55 
A down and dirty boxing gym, humming with the rhythm of 
men training. Sweat and smoke fill the air along with the faint scent of blood. Fighters, both black and white, train with each other. Morrie is amazed. 
MORRIE How do they get away with this? 
But PK has his mind on other things. His eyes fix on an OLD MAN across the room standing by ringside. 
PK There he is. 
MORRIE Christ, he's old. 
PK And he's the best.    C'mon. PK leads Morrie across the gym. PK passes an African fighter. He stops training when he sees PK. He turns to another African fighter, glancing at PK. One by one the blacks in the gym stop training to look at PK. PK and Morrie approach the rheumy Old Man yelling at the two fighters in the ring above him in a thick Polish- Jewish accent. 
SOLLY (OLD MAN) No, no. God gave you two hands so you can knock a man out from either side. Left-right. 
He moves his creaky body back and forth to demonstrate. PK Mr. Goldman? Solly turns to the boys. A look of bemusement comes over his face when he sees their blazers. 
SOLLY What?    You boys lost? 
PK I'm the one who called you yesterday. From the Prince of Wales School? 
SOLLY Oh yeah, yeah.     The champeen. Right? PK (smiling) Right. 
SOLLY And who are you? 
MORRIE The champeen's manager. 
Solly rolls his eyes to heaven. 
SOLLY Oy gevalt. (beat) You know you train here it's not like those nice school fights you're used to. Three knockdowns you win. 
Just then, as if to underscore his point, one of the fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the jaw. He hits the canvas inches from where they are standing. Solly, PK and Morrie all look at him, and then at each other. 
MORRIE What does it cost for you to train him?

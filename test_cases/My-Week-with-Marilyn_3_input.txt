SYBIL THORNDIKE It's so easily done, isn't it? I'm sure I went wrong somewhere there too. Shall we have another go, Larry? 
CUT TO: 
61 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 61 
The clapperboard snaps. Take Five. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) "Oh yes, my dear, of course I remember you well." 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) 
(HALTING) "Oh, I'm quite sure you don't, your royal..., oh, I mean, your, uh, Imperial... your uh... serene majesty." It is not clear whether Marilyn's hesitance is acted or not but the others press on gamely. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 40. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) "What does she say?" 
OLIVIER (AS REGENT) "She says she is deeply flattered and compliments you on your wonderful memory." MARILYN jumps in, shouting her line over the top of him. 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue." There is a pause. SYBIL THORNDIKE hesitates. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE Didn't I have a line somewhere there, dear? 
OLIVIER Cut. 
CUT TO: 
62 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 62 
The clapperboard snaps shut again. Take twelve. 
ORTON Action! 
SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) "Thank you, my dear. (Pause) Sweetly pretty. She should use more mascara. When one is young one should use a lot of mascara, and when one is old one should use much more. What do you do, my dear?" 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue". 
SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) 
(TO OLIVIER) "Dear?" 
OLIVIER (AS REGENT) "She says she is an actress." MARILYN looks at him, hesitant but just about in character. OLIVIER glances at ORTON who nods. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) Cut it there. 
ORTON Check the gate. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 41. 
FOCUS PULLER (After a second) Gate's good. 
OLIVIER Print. There is a near-audible sigh of relief around the set. SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE That was perfect, Marilyn. You're Elsie to the life! MARILYN smiles awkwardly, not really believing her but SYBIL carries on with complete conviction. SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd) Perhaps we could practise our lines together later? You'd be doing me such a kindness. At my great age it's just so hard to make them stick! Why don't you come for tea tomorrow? In fact Sybil is word perfect every time, and everyone knows it. But it is a kind and tactful gesture. MARILYN's face lights up. 
MARILYN Can I? 
62A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 62A 
OLIVIER looks at COLIN in dismay. 
OLIVIER She's impossible. I should have cast Vivien. 
COLIN If anyone can make her great, it's you. You're a genius. 
OLIVIER Oh, yes. The world's greatest living actor, so they say. OLIVIER looks at him, wanting to be reassured. He fumbles for a cigarette with shaking fingers and COLIN hurries to light it. He smiles wryly. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) Let's hope I'm as brilliant as you think I am. (Pause) Now be a good boy and keep an eye on her. 
CUT TO: 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 42. 
63 INT. PINEWOOD. DRESSING ROOMS/CORRIDOR. DAY. 63 
MARILYN and PAULA are heading for the dressing room. MARILYN looks tired and disconnected. COLIN is just behind them on another errand. He can't help overhearing Paula's insistent, honeyed tones as she responds to Marilyn's uncertainty. 
MARILYN I just can't figure this movie out. 
PAULA You were wonderful. You are the most gifted actress I have ever known. You were superb, Marilyn. You were divine. 
MARILYN He was angry with me, I could tell. 
PAULA You were great. You are a great, great actress. All my life I have prayed for a great actress I could help and guide. She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the corridor in front of Marilyn. COLIN stops awkwardly, his path blocked. 
PAULA (CONT'D) Like this. I prayed to God on my knees. And he has given me you. You are that great actress, Marilyn.

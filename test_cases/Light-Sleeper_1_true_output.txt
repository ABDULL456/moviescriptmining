Ann's apartment. Eight p.m. She opens the door for LETOUR, kisses him, goes back to the phone. Mantra muzak plays as JOHN locks door, heads toward bedroom. Inside bedroom, MTV glows silently as ROBERT, wearing a black turtleneck, works at a desk amid tools of the trade: digital scale, "hot box," Deering grinder, block of manite, pure cocaine, pills, felt pen. ROBERT scissors glossy magazine paper (Elle) into neat quarters, folds each into gram-size "bindels" -- envelopes. Red satin drapes the ceiling. 
ROBERT Jack. 
JOHN kisses him atop the head. 
ROBERT You pick up from Jealous? 
LETOUR (passes bag) Yeah, nineteen grams after four times last night. We're certainly not his favorite people. 
ROBERT We don't make the laws. Nineteen is carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him be stupid. 
LETOUR He took my hundreds. 
ROBERT (stands) Take over for a while. I'm getting contact high. 
LETOUR (sits) Who's Her Majesty talking to? 
ROBERT flips through cable channels as JOHN grinds cocaine. 
ROBERT The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona. She's trying to get them to come here -- or, better, Europe. 
LETOUR That's where the money is. 
ROBERT All mark-up -- the "Big One." 
LETOUR (laughs) Don't dress. (beat) You really think she means it? 
ROBERT That's what she says. New Year's Eve and out -- no Acid House, no product, no deliveries. 
LETOUR That's just her mouth talking. 
ROBERT Next year -- strictly Akasha. 
LETOUR "Akasha"? 
ROBERT Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling the company now -- 
LETOUR (interjects) -- this week. I don't get it -- marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd anyone pay to put weeds on their face? 
ROBERT Why'd anyone pay to put them up their nose? I like cosmetics. I need cosmetics. You should come in with us. 
LETOUR You forget: she hasn't asked me. 
ANN hangs up, calls: 
ANN (out of shot) Johnny! Robert! Come here! 
They return to the living area. 
ANN (open arms) Plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen hundred Ex at thirty each and the delivery's here. 
They simultaneously kiss her cheeks. 
ANN (to LETOUR) Whatja think?

Skip look at Larry again.   Larry meets his gaze. 
LARRY One, two - (he looks away) No. Thanks for playing.    Move along. 
SKIP It's that simple. 
CONOR You're right. That's no help at all. 
LARRY But listen - I can tell you this. Gay or straight, you're not going to get anywhere by being inactive. She clearly likes you - maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something. So the next time you're in the position - don't take no for an answer. 
Skip looks at Larry, concerned. 
SKIP That sounds like felonious advice. 
LARRY You're right. Let me rephrase.    Don't take maybe for an answer. 
Conor takes this in - that's not a bad idea. 
INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Cute studio apartment. And Ben is in the bed. Anna walks in from the bathroom, in a robe. Ben watches her. 
BEN Wait.   Stop. 
ANNA What? 
BEN Shit.   This is bad. 
ANNA What? 
BEN I am so into you. 
Anna BEAMS.   She joins him in bed. 
BEN (CONT'D) I'm lying here watching you and I seriously have never felt this way before. I have to forcibly make my brain stop thinking about you. I mean, all the time. 
ANNA Why stop? 
She looks at Ben.    He's not smiling. 
BEN Because I don't do stuff like this. 
ANNA Stuff like what? 
BEN Like having sex with women who are not my wife. 
ANNA First of all, I'm not women.   I'm just one. 
He waits. 
BEN What's second of all? 
ANNA I didn't have a second of all. 
BEN I thought second of all was going to make me feel better. 
Anna thinks. 
ANNA Second of all - I can't stop thinking about you, either. 
They look at each other for a LONG MOMENT. 
BEN I have to tell her. 
ANNA What? 
BEN I have to tell her. 
Anna's eyes light up, but she tries to cover. 
ANNA I don't want to push you to -- 
BEN I want to be with you. And I can't do that if I'm lying to her. 
ANNA You know what's best. 
As Ben pulls her to him, she lets a smile take hold. 
FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:   ...IF HE'S MARRIED 
LOUIS, 60's, with a kind but very wise face, talks to the camera in his FORMAL DOORMAN attire, standing in front of a posh Upper East Side building. 
LOUIS Here's the thing - my daughter is happily married with kids and running a tanning salon on Staten Island. But if she wasn't, I'd tell her the same thing I'd like to tell a lot of the girls that come in and out of this building on the arm of a married guy. 
(MORE) 
LOUIS (CONT'D) And here is that advice --- get stocks, cash, annuities, a deed in your name. Don't settle for flowers and a shopping spree at Bendel's. Think to the future. We all know that none of these guys is gonna leave his society wife and let her keep half the money and the classic eight on Park Avenue. So, I wanna tell these young ladies, as long as you only have the guy for a finite period of time -- get something that can last. Because I guarantee you - he won't. And that's the best fatherly advice I can give. 
INT. RITE AID - DAY 
Mary and Anna, in sweats and Ugg boots and dirty hair, both load their carts with cheap beauty products. 
ANNA I'm not picking out china patterns or anything - but I've never felt anything like this before.

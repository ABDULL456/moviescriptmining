NEW ANGLE 
The light REVEALS Wilder's feet swinging back and forth above their heads.  His body is suspended in the manner of a trail cache.  Viking Bob lets out a startled grunt.  He and Mitchell shine their lights on Wilder's face. MITCHELL It's Sam Wilder! VIKING BOB Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this. MITCHELL Where's the kid? (CONTINUED) 129  CONTINUED: LEMALLE Who gives a husky fuck?  Where's Ben? 
The trappers look glumly at one another. 
130  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE 
Anne Marie jams herself behind a pile of her photo equipment.  She stops as she hears the trappers' boots (OS) CRUNCH in the snow past her and go inside the Turtle. 
131  INT.  THE TURTLE 
The trappers peel off their overcoats.  They look around at the comfortable surroundings. MITCHELL I should get me a job with an oil company. 
He sits on the couch and lays his scrimshaw and engraving tools out on the coffee table.  LeMalle helps himself in the well-stocked larder. LEMALLE I say we eat, torch this fuckin' thing, and move on. 
LeMalle digs through the cupboards and comes up with a fresh bottle of Scotch. VIKING BOB Go easy. LEMALLE Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted. CUT TO: 
132  EXT.  THE TURTLE - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Flashlight in hand, gloriously drunk, LeMalle stumbles outside.  He crosses to the jeep to grab a box of Twinkies and, as long as he's at it, take a leak in a snowbank. Bleary-eyed, he notices the damage to the utility compartment inflicted by the bear. 
He walks to it, stepping over the bear scat.  He marvels at the size and depth of the clawmarks. (CONTINUED) 132  CONTINUED: LEMALLE Big mother musta wanted something real bad in here... 
LeMalle tries the door, but it's jammed shut.  He tucks his flashlight under his arm and gives another tug.  This time the door cracks open. 
CLOSER - HIS POV 
He peers through the opening and shines his flashlight in. A pair of eyes stare back at him. 
WIDER 
LeMalle jumps back, startled, and pulls out his knife.   He tries the door again.  It WRENCHES open... 
...He's looking at his own face in one of Anne Marie's mirrored photo reflector boards. 
Letting his breath out, LeMalle pokes around the equipment in the compartment.  Ever larcenous, he pulls a few items out, examines them, and, disinterested, leaves them in the snow.  Doing so, he comes close to uncovering Anne Marie, who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the compartment. 
Nothing in the compartment catches LeMalle's fancy.  Leaving the door hanging open, he wanders away. 
133  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE 
After he's gone, Anne Marie reaches over and closes the door.  She can hear the trappers' (OS) CONVERSATION inside: VIKING BOB (OS) I know in my gut he was here. First light, we try to get scent of his trail. 
Sighing, Anne Marie stuffs her hands inside her parka and tries to get comfortable.  It's going to be a long night. FADE TO: 
134  EXT.  ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - DAWN 
Eric and Corbett wearily trudge through the woods.  Corbett has the tarp wrapped around him for extra warmth.  As he walks, he sniffs at one of Eric's Eskimo potato roots and takes a tentative nibble. (CONTINUED) 134  CONTINUED: CORBETT Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome. ERIC Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there. CORBETT Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat. (off Eric's look) That was fine money. ERIC Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things. CORBETT You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.

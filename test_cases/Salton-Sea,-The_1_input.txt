ON THE BLACK AND WHITE SURVEILLANCE MONITOR NEXT DOOR. 
TRAHN You alone? 
Danny nods. 
TRAHN (cont'd) Any word from Pooh-Bear? 
Danny shakes his head. 
TRAHN (cont'd) You okay, hoss? 
BACK INSIDE THE ROOM 
Trahn walks over to Danny, who sits there with his head down, his face obscured by a baseball cap. Slowly, he looks up. 
IT IS JIMMY. 
TRAHN (cont'd) What the hell? 
JIMMY Danny told me to tell you that he was sorry. (beat) He said he had to take care of this himself. 
EXT. BLUFF - NIGHT 
Tanner scanning with the night vision glasses. 
TANNER Here he comes. 
REVEAL that the car is on a bluff above POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND. 
Danny pulls up in a rental car. 
INT. DANNY'S CAR - SAME 
Danny's hand is shaking uncontrollably. 
DANNY Easy, boy. 
He looks at his hand again. It continues to shake.  He takes a deep breath. 
TANNER'S P.O.V. 
As Danny gets out of the car and goes to the trunk. 
Tanner watching. 
TANNER Where's Bubba? 
GARCETTI Maybe he isn't showing. 
Danny takes a gym bag out of the trunk and approaches Pooh-Bear's house. 
TANNER Looks like Flynne's handling the cash. Let's get into position. 
They get out of the car and trek down the bluff towards the house. 
INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Big Bill lets Danny in, then pats him down for weapons.  Satisfied, he leads Danny to the kitchen. 
IN THE KITCHEN - Danny enters and stops.  A worried look. 
Pooh-Bear along with THREE OTHER MEN.  The men eye Danny silently. They look like ex-cons. 
DANNY What the hell is this? 
POOH-BEAR Just some buddies. 
DANNY This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here. 
POOH-BEAR What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead? 
The other guys snicker, one of them almost spitting his beer out. 
Danny smiles good-naturedly.  Shoots a look over at ... 
... one of the guys sitting where he taped his gun earlier. 
DANNY Come on, man, let's deal. 
He throws the bag on the table, knocking a beer into the guys lap.  The guy springs up, pissed off. 
POOH-BEAR Cool it. We got business. 
DANNY Yeah, dickhead. 
Danny moves over and plops down in the guys seat. 
UNDER THE TABLE - Danny fumbling with the gun, trying to untape it without being too obvious. 
Pooh-Bear unzips the bag. Inside, a lot of cash. 
POOH-BEAR Oh my, oh my. (beat) Big Bill, come take a look at this. 
Big Bill is behind Danny, over by the sink.  He pulls his FLINTLOCK and walks over. 
Danny continues trying to get the gun loose.  Something catches his eye 
... the MICROWAVE OVEN DOOR is open, casting a reflection of the room behind him.  Big Bill approaches Danny, pointing the gun at Danny's head.

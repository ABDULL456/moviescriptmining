Clay prunes the roses on the front lawn.  Hanna appears, frowning. 
CLAY Something I can do for you? 
HANNA The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask. 
CLAY Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then. 
HANNA Expect nothing fancy. 
Hanna goes inside.  Clay rolls the mower down the path. 
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Clay knocks on the bottom of the Dutch door as he lifts the latch and walks in.  He is wearing a fresh madras shirt. 
HANNA The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea. 
CLAY Tea is fine. 
He sits at the kitchen table. 
HANNA No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room. 
CLAY That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it? 
She eyes him suspiciously, shrugs, pours a glass of tea. Clay notices a Bible on the counter. 
CLAY How long you worked for Mr. Whale? 
HANNA Long enough.  Fifteen years. 
CLAY I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars? 
HANNA No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone? 
CLAY You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri. 
HANNA Your wife? 
CLAY I'm not married. 
HANNA Why? 
CLAY Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me? 
HANNA A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman. 
CLAY You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you? 
Hanna twists her head around with such an indignant look that Clay bursts out laughing.  She realizes that she is being teased. 
HANNA Men.  Always pulling legs. Everything is comedy. (mimics an English accent) "How very amusing.  How marvelously droll." 
Hanna stares at Clay until his smile fades.  She resumes her chopping in silence. 
CLAY You ever been married, Hanna? 
HANNA Of course.  I am married still. 
CLAY Yeah?  What's your husband do? 
HANNA He is dead now, twenty years. 
CLAY Then you're as single as I am. 
HANNA No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much. (sighs) Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad. 
CLAY You're sure of that? 
HANNA This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven. 
CLAY Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those. 
HANNA No.  His is the worse. (worse) The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame? 
She loses patience with Clay's blank look. 
HANNA What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other. 
CLAY A homo? 
HANNA Yes!  You know?

WYATT (V.0.) Nothing. I'm just saying, this club                         - who knows who anybody is, right? 
JONATHAN Yeah, yeah, yeah but - sometimes you just have to go with what you feel, don't you? 
WYATT (V.0.) True enough. Hold on a sec. Muffled sounds of Wyatt talking to someone else. 
WYATT (V.0.) It's non stop back-to-back bullshit here. Listen, I'll call you later. And hey - congratulations! Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan smiles. And then reads the note again - grinning. 
INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - BUILDING LOBBY - DAY 
The morning crush of executives filing toward elevators. Among them we spot Jonathan, just slightly out of step, a sleepy smile lingering on his face. 
INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE DAY 
Jonathan is working on his laptop, clearly distracted. He looks at his cell phone, hoping it will ring, but it doesn't. He calls up the list of "Recent Calls: Incoming," scrolls up to the top number. It reads: "Number Unavailable." Jonathan looks worried, wondering how he can get a hold of her - when his cell phone rings. He immediately picks up. 
JONATHAN Hello? 
WOMAN (O.S.) (unfamiliar voice) Are you free tonight? 
JONATHAN 
(DEFLATED) I think you have the wrong number. 
EXT. STREET -- NIGHT 
Jonathan arrives at the subway station. He's a little anxious now, still hasn't heard from her. He lingers at the top of the stairs, not wanting to descend. Below him he can hear the lonely roar of a train pulling in below. only when the train quiets down does Jonathan realize his cell phone is ringing. He picks up. 
JONATHAN Hello? Intermittent static on the other end. And then what sounds like a WOMAN GASPING; it's unclear if it's a sound of pleasure or pain. 
JONATHAN .Hello? The Gasping comes faster; Jonathan debates hanging up - when the gasps halt,--replaced by the faintest whisp__of_ a female voice: "No... No please..." There's no mistaking the tone now it's fear - then. suddenly a shrill, terrified SCREAM... - and the line goes dead. Jonathan stares breathlessly at the phone in his hand, like he's just witnessed something awful. He quickly checks the display: "Number Unavailable." Jonathan looks panicked with the possibility that it was "S"- - when the phone rings again. He hesitates, then picks up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
"S"                                                             (V.O. FROM PHONE) 
(COYLY) Are you free tonight? Jonathan exhales in relief on hearing her voice. 
EXT. CHINATOWN - CANAL STREET - NIGHT 
Jonathan stands on a corner, looking out of place amidst the glistening neon and bustle of Asian faces. He peers anxiously down the.street, checks his watch, all anticipation             - - when something is wrapped around his eyes. He's startled, tugs it off and spins to find "S" smiling back at him. if S I'll I bought you a present. She drapes the scarf around his neck. It's all striped, bright colors                                                   - all the more funky against his dark suit. I knew it. You look smashing. 
JONATHAN Sure you don't mean "clashing?" She laughs                                                      - then notices how tense he seems. 
,/Sâ Are you all right? 
JONATHAN. I guess. I got a call-before yours                              - I'm not sure if it was real, or if it was even meant for me - but there was a woman who sounded like she was being - I don't know, hurt. Maybe worse. "S" seems instantly on edge. Something about this scares her. If SIP You don't know who she was? 
JONATHAN (shakes his head) It could've been a prank. (notices). Now you're the one who looks scared. 
..Sâ No, it's just                                                   - it sounds creepy, that's all. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She shakes it off, mustering a smile as she takes his arm. 
âSâ Come on. 
EXT. CHINATOWN -- AN ALLEY -- NIGHT 
A makeshift street market, everything from fish and meat to cheap electronics for sale in cramped stands. Jonathan and "S" walk arm in arm through the packed crowd, like a couple. Jonathan looks like we've never seen him before: a fascination with everything around him, especially her. They pause at a stall selling cheap trinkets, including a small metallic wind-up toy of a duck riding a bicycle. 
Â«S" He's so cute! What's his name? 
VENDOR 
(DEADPAN) Duck On Bike. "S" beams like it's the greatest name ever.

Ted takes a hit from the bong. 
TED (CONT'D) (COUGHS) Jesus, this is weak. It's not even gettin' me high. I gotta have a talk with my weed guy. 
JOHN I-- It's workin' for me. 
TED I think it sucks, I'm gonna have a talk with him. 
JOHN Yeah, I don't know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints. 
TED No, I know this guy a long time. I've known him since 9/11. Remember, I was like, "Aw, shit. 9/11. I gotta get high." JOHN (looks at his watch) Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty? Shit, I gotta get to work. 
John gets up, and hurries into the other room to get dressed. 
TED Hey, you mind pickin' up a bird feeder on the way home? I wanna start enjoying the beauty of birds. 
JOHN (O.S.) Jesus, I don't know if I can drive. 
TED I'll drive you, I feel fine. 
EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
We see two shots of John's car driving through the city: We see John in the passenger's seat putting Visine into his eyes, with only Ted's ears and eyes showing as he drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an overhead pull-back shot as we move away from the car to reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge. 
EXT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - MORNING 
John's car pulls up the street and into the parking lot, scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of the rental cars. 
JOHN/TED Aw, Jesus. / Fuck. 
ANGLE ON Ted's feet. There are wooden blocks attached to the pedals so that his feet can reach them. He slams on the brakes. ANGLE OUTSIDE THE CAR. John gets out, and looks at the damage. 
JOHN Aw, man. 
TED Is it bad? 
JOHN It's not good. 
ANGLE ON THE RENT-A-CAR OFFICE - THOMAS, the branch manager, an intense, middle-aged man, is standing in the doorway. THOMAS John! May I speak with you, please? 
JOHN Shit. 
TED It's okay, go, go, I'll pull outta here. (WAVING) Hi, Thomas! How are ya? 
Thomas dryly waves back. Ted pulls forward, scraping the car again. He abruptly pulls out into traffic, and another car swerves a bit to get around him, honking. 
OTHER DRIVER Asshole! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED (OVERLAPPING) Easy, Jersey license! 
Ted drives away. 
INT. THOMAS' OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER 
Thomas sits at his desk facing John. 
THOMAS John, it's almost ten o'clock. 
JOHN I know, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. THOMAS What do you mean? 
JOHN (BEAT) I guess I... wasn't really prepared for a follow-up question. 
THOMAS John, all you have to do is not fuck up, and you get my job when I go to corporate next month. You will be the new branch manager. All you have to do is not fuck up, and all you're doing is fucking up. Not that I don't think you're too fucked up to handle not fucking up my job, but you happen to be the least fucked-up person in the whole office. The next least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been here three fucking years longer than him. But I'm telling you, I will promote the fuck out of him if you fuck up one more time. That is all. Fuck. 
JOHN Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me. 
THOMAS Good. I like hearing that. Because in a month my life now could be your life: a cushy $38,000-a-year branch manager who's personal friends with Tom Skerritt. It's not a bad life, is it? 
JOHN N--no. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
THOMAS Did you know I'm friends with Tom Skerritt? 
JOHN No. 
THOMAS I'll show you something I don't show too many people, because I don't want anyone treating me differently. 
Thomas takes out a framed picture of himself with Tom Skerritt. 
THOMAS (CONT'D) That's me and Tom Skerritt. JOHN (SLIGHTLY OVERDONE) Wowwww. 
THOMAS Goddamn right, wow. Now get outta here. I'm gonna dock you for being late, and for the scratch on that car. Try and be a little more responsible tomorrow.

{"train": "V FOR VENDETTA \nWritten by \nLarry and Andy Wachowski \nBased on the graphic novel by Alan Moore \nFADE IN: \nIn the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice.  Her name is Evey. \nEVEY (V.O.) \"Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot.  I know of now reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.\" \nHer voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a deep centered peace that we can feel. \nEVEY (V.O.) Those were almost the very first words he spoke to me and, in a way, that is where this story began, four hundred years ago, in a cellar beneath the Houses of Parliament. \nIn the darkness, we find a lantern.  Guy Fawkes, a dangerous man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow stacked with barrels of gunpowder. \nEVEY (V.O.) In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. \nThe wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the cellar floor.  From the dark depths, we hear the sound of dogs. \nEVEY (V.O.) He was caught in the cellars with enough gunpowder to level most of London. \nGuy sees lanterns coming from both sides.  He tries to run as the dogs reach him first.  He grabs for his sword as dozens of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall. \nEVEY (V.O.) Sometimes I wonder where we would be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder if it would have mattered. \nIn the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows. \nEVEY (V.O.) I suppose the answer is in the rhyme.  More than the man, what we must remember is the plot itself. \nThe coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat.  He looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face, staring up at him. \nEVEY (V.O.) For in the plot we find more than just a man, we find the idea of that man, the spirit of that man, and that is what we must never forget. \nThe lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling down her face. \nEVEY (V.O.) This, then, is the story of that idea, of that spirit that began with an anarchist's plot four hundred years ago. \nGuy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red morning sun. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nINT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE \nA young Evey sits on her father's lap, combing her Barbie's hair. \nEVEY (V.O.) I was born near the end of the millennium, the year 1997.  My father used to say that people were so afraid that the world was going to end that they were willing it to happen. \nHer father sits beside her mother on the living room couch, watching the news.  From the look on their faces, the news is bad. \nEVEY (V.O.) I don't remember much of the century's turn.  I don't remember the market crash or the plague or any of the Trafalgar riots. \nThe television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers fighting in a shelled city. \nEVEY (V.O.) I've read about them since but I don't recall how any of them impacted my life except for the fear.  They would hide it from me, like a secret between them. \nLittle Evey sees her father staring at her mother.  They take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight. \nEVEY (V.O.) But I could feel it. \nEXT.  CITY STREET \nIt is a new day.  People are gathered along the street as if they were waiting for a parade. \nEVEY (V.O.) Of the chaos that seemed to swallow the beginning of the 21st century, there is one thing I do remember. \nEvey holds her father's hand.  Unable to see what is coming, she can hear it. \nEVEY (V.O.) Very clearly, I can remember that sound. \nWe hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers. \nEVEY (V.O.) And I remember those boots, black leather that gleamed bright in the morning sun.  I had never seen such boots.  All moving in perfect unison. \nLittle Evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with military precision. \nEXT.  CITY STREET \nIn the midst of a political rally for the emerging new party calling itself Norsefire, we find little Evey now on her father's shoulders. \nDascombe, a young man, paces the podium, inciting the crowd. \nDASCOMBE The time has come, London, to return to a bygone age, an age of tradition, an age of values that have been disparaged and all but forgotten.  What this country needs is a leader!  A true leader to remind us of that age.  A righteous leader with the strength of his moral convictions to do what must be done.  I give you that man!  I give you our leader!  Adam Susan! \nAdam Susan rises and the crowd cheers.  Evey's father looks at her mother and again they clasp hands. \nEVEY (V.O.) It must have seemed so easy to them.  They offered such a simple deal; give up control and we will restore order. \nINT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE \nLittle Evey is asleep in her bedroom. \nEVEY (V.O.) At first, the arrests were political.  Dissidents.  Radicals. Liberals. \nA loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up. \nEVEY (V.O.) When my parents were younger, they had been activists.  They had marched with Labor in the great train strike. \nThe sound of heavy boots swarms through the house. \nLITTLE EVEY Mommy? \nHer bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier scoops her up. \nShe is carried through the dark house which is filled with soldiers.  On the floor of the living room, she sees her parents being bound with plastic zip-ties. \nThis is V. \nFATE (V.O.) And this is the voice of Fate signing off and bidding you a pleasant evening. \nEXT.  CITY STREET \nClose on Evey's high heels, stumbling and awkward as she walks down a dark cobblestoned street. \nEXT.  CITY STREET \nClose on V's boots walking in the opposite direction so that it seems they are walking towards each other. \nEVEY (V.O.) I don't know what brought us together that night.  I had never been to that part of Westminster but ever since I've known him, I've stopped believing in coincidence. \nEXT.  CITY STREET \nEvey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow. \nEVEY Excuse me?  Uh... excuse me, Mister? \nThe man turns around.  It is not V. \nEVEY Would you like... uh, would you like to sleep with me? \nHe smiles. \nEVEY I mean, for money. \nMAN That is the clumsiest bit of propositioning I've ever heard. \nEVEY Oh god, I'm sorry. \nMAN Is this your first time, darling? \nEVEY Yes, no, I mean for money.  But I know what you want and I'll do it. \nShe presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and her woman's mouth. \nEVEY Anything you want, mister.  Please, I need the money.  I know I'm young but I promise I know what I'm doing. \nMAN No.  You don't know what you're doing. \nHe pulls out his wallet and shows her a badge.  The sight of it knocks the breath out of her. \nEVEY Christ, you're a Fingerman. \nFINGERMAN 1 Give the little lady a prize. \nFINGERMAN 2 I've got something to give her. \nEvey turns and there are more Fingermen behind her. \nFINGERMAN 1 Prostitution is a class H offense. Know what that means?  It means that we get to exercise our own judicial discretion -- \nFINGERMAN 2 And you get to swallow it. \nThe Fingermen laugh. \nEVEY Oh god, please.  It's my first time.  Please don't hurt me. \nFINGERMAN 1 Gosh, fellas, look at those big innocent eyes.  What do you think? \nFINGERMAN 3 Spare the rod, spoil the child. \nFingerman 2 laughs hard as he drops his pants. \nEVEY Oh no! \nHe shoves her face first against a brick wall, lifting her dress to expose her bottom. \nEVEY Please, don't! \nFINGERMAN 3 You heard the man, sweetie.  This rod's for your own good. \nSuddenly, they are no longer alone. \nV \"The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him.\" \nFINGERMAN 3 What the hell -- \nV \"And fortune, on his damned quarrel, smiling, showed like a rebel's whore.\" \nFINGERMAN 1 We're police officers, pal. \nFINGERMAN 4 We're with the Finger. \nFINGERMAN 3 So bugger off! \nV \"Disdaining fortune with his brandished steel, which smoked with bloody execution.\" \nIn the clenched fist of black leather, we see a flash of steel. \nFINGERMAN 1 He's got a knife! \nV attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being. A single blow sends the largest of the Fingermen flying backwards. \nBut more than his strength, it is his speed. \nA gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is buried in the Fingerman's chest and -- \nBefore the body falls, the knife is gone. \nIt takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the ground.  V turns to the last Fingerman who is struggling to pull his pants up. \nFINGERMAN 3 Jesus Christ!  Don't hurt me! \nV steps forward and he screams, bolting while holding his pants up. \nV Good evening. \nEVEY Who -- Who are you? \nDozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city, most of them are of the damage caused by V. \nLEADER Gentlemen, I will hear your reports now.  Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye. \nConrad Heyer appears on one of the screens.  He is at his desk inside the command center for the Eye, the governmental organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems. \nCONRAD We have less than two minutes of usable footage, Leader.  It took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the Finger's vice patrol. \nOn an insert screen, we see grainy footage of V rescuing Evey from one of the pole-mounted cameras. \nCONRAD As you can see, the suspect's reflex speed is extraordinary.  As is his strength. \nAs the last body falls, V seems to pause and looks back over his shoulder straight into the camera. \nLEADER Freeze it! \nThe Leader stares at the smiling face. \nCONRAD I'm afraid the mask makes retinal identification impossible. \nLEADER Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear! \nBunny Etheridge appears on another screen.  Behind him, huge spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly. \nETHERIDGE We were able to triangulate the origin of the fireworks.  We also are currently monitoring a lot of phone surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosions.  All suspect or significant transcripts are being forwarded to Mr. Almond. \nLEADER Very good.  Mr. Finch, speak for the Nose. \nFinch, no longer the same young man, stands at the site of the fireworks launch. \nFINCH Thanks to Etheridge, we found the launch for the fireworks.  These appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that, despite a level of sophistication, these devices are all home-made with over the counter chemicals, making them impossible to trace.  Whoever he is, Leader, he's good. \nLEADER Thank you for that professional annotation. \nAn intercom opens. \nLIEUTENANT (V.O.) Leader, Mr. Almond has arrived. \nLEADER Very good.  Gentlemen, keep me informed of any further developments.  England prevails. \nThey answer in unison as Almond enters the office.  His face is harder but he has the same violent gleam in his eye. \nThe Leader turns in his chair. \nLEADER Mr. Almond, do you know what this is behind me? \nALMOND Uh... the Fate computer system, sir? \nLEADER No.  No sir.  It's more than that. This, this computer is a symbol, Mr. Almond.  A symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind. Do you know what that goal is, Mr. Almond? \nAlmond does not.  The Leader leaps from his chair while pounding the desk. \nLEADER Control, Mr. Almond!  Control!  The world around us is a changing, directionless, amoral morass and it is up to man and man alone to set things right! \nHe moves around the desk at Almond. \nLEADER Without control, man is nothing more than any other stinking, sweating, brute animal.  Control, Mr. Almond.  The control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years.  Now, do you understand what happened last night? \nALMOND We... lost control. \nLEADER Yes, Mr. Almond.  Last night someone did the unthinkable. Someone hurt us.  It is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely. I want that man found, Mr. Almond. I want his head or, by god, I'll have yours. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nEvey is wearing a blindfold and V leads her by her fingertips, guiding her almost as if they were dancing... \nHis fingers slip free of her and she reaches out. \nEVEY Wait.  I've lost you. \nV No, you haven't. \nHe is behind her and he removes the blindfold, revealing his house to her. \nEVEY Oh... \nIt is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and rooms. \nThe gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing collection of human culture.  There is art that spans from the renaissance to the painted covers of Eerie comics, literature that ranges from Shakespeare to Spillane, philosophy from Plato to Bukowski, and a vast collection of nonfiction. \nThere are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is lined with videocassettes. \nA jukebox stands in front of an enormous vinyl and CD collection of music. \nEVEY A jukebox?  Where did you get it? \nV I saved it.  Like everything here. \nShe punches a button and Billie Holiday begins to sing. \nEVEY Oh, it's beautiful.  I've never heard anything like it. \nV Of course not.  You grew up in their world.  Art is created by individuals and there are no individuals in a world where you are told what to think. \nEVEY This place is amazing. \nV You're welcome to stay. \nShe stops suddenly and looks at him.  The offer is terribly exciting but it is so unlike anything she has ever done that it's almost impossible to imagine. \nEVEY Stay here... with you? \nV Yes.  If you like. \nEVEY I... I don't even know your name. \nV I don't have a name.  But you can call me V. \nEVEY V?  V... I like that. \nAnd she returns his smile. \nINT.  CONDUCTOR'S CAB \nThe conductor hears something on the roof.  He peers up just as V swings down, smashing feet first into the cab. \nINT.  TRAIN CAR \nThe brakes suddenly lock, throwing Bodyguard 2 into Prothero. \nPROTHERO Get off of me! \nA moment later, the lights are cut off and the entire train is plunged into complete darkness. \nBODYGUARD 2 What the fuck is going on? \nBODYGUARD 1 Lock the car doors. \nPROTHERO I have a lighter... somewhere... \nBODYGUARD 2 I can't find the lock -- wait.  Hey wha-- \nThere is a muffled shriek followed by a sharp snap. \nBODYGUARD 1 What's happening -- \nThere is another sound, like the leather slap of a boxer pounding a heavy bag, followed by the sound of the heavy bag collapsing onto the floor. \nPROTHERO I found it! \nHe flicks on the lighter and, in the dim light of its flame, he sees the smiling face. \nPROTHERO Oh god. \nV sits casually, arms folded, across from Prothero.  The bodyguards lay dead on the floor. \nPROTHERO Who are you?  What do you want? Money?  Is that it? \nV just smiles. \nPROTHERO Wait, wait.  You're, you're the one that blew the Bailey. \nV nods and Prothero's eyes go wide. \nPROTHERO You're making a mistake.  I'm nobody -- \nOn the floor, he sees the bodyguard's gun.  He kills the lighter and dives for it. \nIn the darkness, we hear the struggle.  It ends quickly. When the lighter flicks back on, V is holding it and the gun. \nPROTHERO Oh god, what do you want? \nV I've come to offer you a choice. Commander Prothero. \nPROTHERO What -- What did you call me? \nV Commander Prothero. \nProthero's heart begins to pound. \nV That was your title at Larkhill. You remember Larkhill, don't you, Commander? \nEXT.  LARKHILL RESETTLEMENT CAMP - FLASHBACK \nA sign reads, \"Larkhill Resettlement Camp.\" \nV (V.O.) Where they sent the undesirables. \nA caged truck packed with minorities rolls into the gates which are topped with spools of razor wire. \nINT.  TRAIN CAR \nProthero is sweating. \nPROTHERO I don't know what you're talking about. \nV Maybe I can help your memory. Let's see.  Larkhill opened in the summer of 2009.  You were appointed it commander.  You wore a uniform in those days.  You looked very good in it. \nINT.  LARKHILL - PROTHERO'S OFFICE - FLASHBACK \nProthero admires his uniform in the mirror. \nV (V.O.) You were a man of many responsibilities.  You made sure Larkhill made all its quotas, especially the oven quotas even though they required an excessive amount of maintenance. \nEXT.  LARKHILL OVENS - FLASHBACK \nWe see a detail of black and Indian men, shoveling mounds of black ash from a series of furnace like ovens. \nAs the shovels lift, we see blackened bones and burnt skulls. \nEXT.  LARKHILL MAIN YARD - FLASHBACK \nProthero saunters through the lines of camp prisoners. \nV (V.O.) But there was one task you took to with exceptional relish.  Remember the medical block, Commander?  I believe you called it the funny farm.  You were the one that selected the prisoners.  You hand picked each one. \nProthero steps in front of a woman who remains beautiful despite the suffering she has endured.  Prothero smiles. \nPROTHERO Her. \nAs the guards grab her, we become aware of a man that is staring at Prothero.  He is one of the prisoners but we do not see his face. \nProthero notices the man.  He doesn't like the way the man is staring at him. \nPROTHERO You. \nINT.  TRAIN CAR \nProthero is terrified. \nPROTHERO You!  You're him, aren't you? \nV nods. \nFinch looks at the ground. \nLEADER It is also because I know you, Finch.  I know what you are. You're a man like me.  A man who understands when they are given a job what must be done.  I understand you, Finch, and that is why I can trust you. \nHe moves in close to Finch. \nLEADER This terrorist knows us, Finch. These attacks are perfectly calculated and they are divisive. He knows what he's doing, Finch. He knows us all too well. \nFINCH You think he's an insider? \nLEADER What I think is that this man must be stopped.  Stopped at all costs and no one, I repeat, no one is to be placed above suspicion.  Do I make myself clear? \nFINCH Perfectly. \nLEADER England prevails, Mr. Finch. \nFINCH England prevails. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nEvey, alone in the Shadow Gallery, stares up at the inscription above the crooked staircase. \nEVEY V, v, v, v, v. \nV I hear your summons, my lady.  And obey. \nShe jumps, V suddenly appearing behind her. \nEVEY Oh, V, you scared me. \nShe turns back to the carving. \nEVEY I was reading the inscription. What is it? \nV A Latin quotation.  A motto.  \"Vi veri veniversum vivus vici.\"  \"By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe.\" \nShe nods. \nEVEY Yes, I suppose you have.  This place is the only universe I have right now. \nV Does that bother you? \nEVEY I don't know.  I'm so grateful to you -- I just feel I should help you, you know, the way you're helping me.  I mean, that's the deal, isn't it? \nV drifts over to the big old Wurlitzer, fingers scanning the song list. \nV No deals, Evey.  Not unless you want them. \nShe looks up at the inscription as an old blues song begins to play. \nEVEY I think I do.  Part of me wants to stay here forever and never have to face what's going on outside.  But that's not right.  Is it?  That's not taking responsibility.  Not conquering my universe. \nShe turns to him. \nEVEY I want to help you, V.  I want to do something.  Can we make a deal? \nV Yes.  I think we can make a deal if you like.  I think I know a way you could help me very soon indeed. \nEvey smiles nervously. \nEVEY Good.  That's that, then. \nThe blues song curls in the air around them like a heavy incense. \nEVEY V, you said that Latin thing was a quote.  Who said it? \nV Nobody you'd have heard of.  A German gentleman named Dr. John Faust. \nHe spins her. \nV He made a deal too. \nEXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY \nThe church doors have opened with the flow of parishioners as the final mass of the day has ended. \nThe tide slowly pours out onto the sidewalk, separating around the clumps of people that conglomerate to network and gossip. \nChurch bells toll in the orange dusk above them. \nHelen Heyer, a woman whose spite and guile are hidden behind her looks and clothes she drapes them with, charges into the gossipers, her trophy husband in tow, a timid looking man that we recognize as Conrad Heyer. \nCONRAD Hello, Rosemary.  Derek, how -- \nHelen's head snaps over at the mention of the name. \nHELEN Derek! \nShe pushes past Conrad, giving Derek Almond an exuberant kiss on both cheeks. \nHELEN Darling, how are you?  Hello, Rosemary. \nAlways behind her husband, Rosemary Almond smiles nervously as she straightens her drab church dress. \nROSEMARY Hello. \nDEREK It's so good to see you.  Since this bloody terrorist business, the old man has me literally chained to the office. \nHelen pouts at him. \nHELEN Oh, you poor dear. \nDerek taps the bottom of his cigarette box, drawing one with his lips. \nDEREK It comes with the job.  How are things in the Eye, Conrad? \nCONRAD Well, we've been working some bugs out of the new Mark IX fiber optic network, actually -- \nHELEN Oh, Conrad, don't be such a bloody bore.  Do tell us about the terrorist, Derek.  Is it true he blew up Big Ben and the old Bailey? \nDEREK I'm afraid so.  We're dealing with a pathological psychotic in the most extreme case.  We'll catch him though.  I promise. \nThe guards look out into the night, fear suddenly gripping their faces. \nV emerges demonically through the parting veils of fog, the white smiling mask bobbing eerily up and down as he rushes them. \nA cigarette drops from the first guard's mouth, red embers exploding when it hits the wet cement. \nClose as the two guards claw for their arms and the white hot flash of V's knives -- \nThat slice like talons. \nThe two men crumple to the ground, clutching their gaping, gurgling wounds.  A whisper.  V sprints into the courtyard. \nINT.  BISHOP'S BEDROOM \nEvey grabs a metal table lamp and swings it down on the Bishop's head.  There is a shuddering clank and he collapses to the floor. \nLILLIMAN You -- You filthy whore! \nHis blood speckles the white bearskin throw rug as the Bishop slowly rises after the retreating Evey. \nLILLIMAN I'll kill you, you fucking sow. \nHe charges after her but freezes dead in his tracks as V swings around the corner in front of him. \nLILLIMAN What's this?  Who -- \nV Please allow me to introduce myself... \nV bows. \nV I'm a man of wealth and taste. \nLILLIMAN Dennis? \nInstantly, the point of one of V's knives is against the Bishop's throat.  V presses a finger to his frozen smile. \nV Shh.  It isn't polite to disturb the dead on their journey. \nEvey watches from around the corner. \nV A courtesy I'll most respectfully extend to his grace. \nEVEY V? \nLilliman swallows audibly. \nEVEY V, what are you doing? \nV Vi veri veniversum vivus vici, Evey. \nEvey looks down at the knives on his belt, dripping blood. \nEVEY Oh no. \nShe begins backing to the door. \nEVEY You can't kill him! \nV Death has followed his grace the whole of his career.  Is it any coincidence it has finally followed him here? \nEVEY Oh god, V.  I can't -- I can't -- \nV turns back to Lilliman as Evey runs. \nV Let us pray. \nEXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT \nEvey sprints past the dead guards at the man gate and into the fog. \nINT.  THE EAR \nA cramped control room that looks like something between a radio and television switching room, though it does not broadcast.  It receives. \nTwo operators sit at the main substation as the sounds of lovemaking come over the speakers.  The moans are stifled and low, however, as if they were afraid someone was listening. \nOPERATOR 1 Bloody hell.  Doesn't anybody fuck with feeling anymore? \nOperator 2 does not look at him, scrolling through an intricate city map on his computer. \nOPERATOR 2 Hey, it's Sunday.  Children's hour over at the Abbey. \nOPERATOR 1 Let's see what that filthy old pervert is up to. \nOperator 1 punches in some coordinates and the sound over the speakers changes to a garbled fart of noise.  Two voices drown beneath a cacophony of classical music. \nOPERATOR 1 What the -- \nHe tries to dial out the background and suddenly the voices rise clearly above the din. \nVOICE 1 ... And I saw a black shape against the flames.  Oh god.  It's you. The man from room five.  You've come -- \nVOICE 2 To collect what's mine. \nVOICE 1 I beg you!  I don't want to die! Please have mercy! \nThe two men look at each other, Operator 1 lunging for a red phone. \nOPERATOR 1 Get me the Finger.  This is an emergency! \nEXT.  BISHOP'S QUARTERS - NIGHT \nClose on a stain of white vomit and blood on the thick pile of a Persian rug.  It is encircled in police chalk. \nPull back to reveal the chalk outline where the body of Bishop Lilliman was found.  The circled bloodstain floats above the head like the last word balloon of a crude comic strip character. \nThe Bishop's quarters is slowly being picked over by a forensic team from the Nose.  A photographer's flash bursts against a painted \"V\" on the wall near the body outline. \nAt the window, Finch chews on his pipe, staring at a plastic evidence bag that contains a single violet carson rose. \nDOMINIC No prints yet, sir.  Just like Prothero. \nDOMINIC In special case studies, medical research groups used roman numerals to identify test inmates. \nFINCH Five is the letter V.  Brilliant, Dominic. \nFinch slides in front of his computer. \nFINCH All we need is Larkhill's employment records. \nINT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM \nThe covers pulled protectively up around her, Delia rests in a light, uneasy sleep. \nSuddenly, an eye pops open as she awakens, catching a familiar scent.  She slowly sits up and inhales. \nDELIA Roses. \nShe closes her eyes. \nDELIA It's you, isn't it?  You've come to kill me. \nFrom the shadows, V answers. \nV Yes. \nTears begin to streak her face. \nDELIA Oh thank god.  Thank god. \nINT.  FINCH'S OFFICE - THE NOSE \nDominic hangs over Finch's shoulder as Larkhill's employment record comes up. \nFinch's mouth falls open. \nFINCH Oh my god. \nRow after row of names scroll by at the end of each bio are the words: deceased, file closed. \nFINCH Oh bloody hell. \nThe data banks unfurl like a mass grave. \nDOMINIC He's killed them all?  It's not possible. \nFinch stops, staring at the one name whose file is not closed -- \nFINCH Oh no. \nDr. Delia Surridge. \nINT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM \nV floats on the edge of the room's shadows, a dark angel. \nV Are you afraid? \nDELIA No, no.  I thought I would be, but I'm not.  I'm -- \nShe looks at the hovering, smiling mask. \nDELIA Relieved. \nShe starts to cry again. \nDELIA Oh god, all these years.  All this waiting.  And somehow I always knew you'd come back. \nDelia thinks back. \nDELIA When I saw you that night -- the night you escaped, you were standing against the flames and you looked straight at me. \nThe mask almost nods. \nDELIA I knew then that one day you'd come looking for me, that you'd find me. \nHer voice drops to an almost confessional whisper. \nDELIA What -- what happened at Larkhill. What we did -- What I did.  That terrible knowledge, it's been with me so long.  That I could do things like that. \nDelia rubs the salty tears from her eyes. \nDELIA For years, I blamed it on the government, on the authority I could never stand up to.  But living so long with the knowledge of what I did has made me understand otherwise.  I alone was accountable. \nV watches her. \nDELIA There is something wrong with us. With all of mankind.  With me. Something evil that made me enjoy what I did.  Some hideous flaw. \nHer voice almost trails off. \nDELIA We deserve to be culled.  We deserve it. \nINT.  ALMOND BEDROOM \nLight sweeps across Rosemary from the opening bedroom door as she sobs softly in bed.  Derek enters, holding a bottle of whiskey and his clean gun. \nShe sits up as Derek looms over her. \nROSEMARY Derek?  What? \nHe lifts the gun into her bruised face.  Her eyebrows cringe as he slowly pulls the trigger. \nDEREK Bang. \nClick.  It is empty. \nDEREK Don't worry, Rose.  I didn't load it. \nThe phone rings. \nDEREK Not tonight. \nHe grins evilly at her and answers the bedside phone. \nHe smiles. \nDEREK Bang. \nClick.  He never loaded it. \nThere is an awkward moment of silence, then V moves -- \nCloak opening, filling the hall like a black tidal wave that envelopes Derek.  He chokes a scream as V embraces him, slipping a knife above his floating rib. \nDerek Almond sputters as he claws at V's mask. \nDEREK Who -- Who are you? \nV Yes, look.  Look and tell me what you see. \nHe rips V's mask off as V thrusts the knife in deeper. \nDerek's eyes widen in horror as his life pours out the knife wound. \nDEREK Horrible!  God, it's horrible! \nV jerks his blade free, letting Derek slip to the ground. \nEXT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME \nFinch's car bucks up onto the sidewalk. \nFinch and Dominic tear out of the car and barrel into the house. \nINT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME \nAt the top of the stairs, they find the dead Derek.  Finch rushes past him for the bedroom. \nFINCH Delia? \nInside, he finds her.  Her eyes fixed, cold, and dead, a single violet carson in her lap. \nFINCH Get an ambulance. \nEXT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME \nEvey rushes around a corner to see a crime scene bathed in siren light.  She pushes up to the police barricade as the M.E.'s load a draped body into their van. \nEVEY Oh no... V? \nShe tries to angle around to get a better look when a man in a brown overcoat grabs her from behind and drags her into the alley. \nINT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM \nFrom the corner of the room, Finch sits, watching as the M.E.'s wheel out Delia's body. \nDominic squeezes past the gurney and crosses toward Finch. \nDOMINIC I'm sorry, sir.  You knew the doctor pretty well? \nFinch nods. \nDOMINIC We found this on her bureau, sir. It's Dr. Surridge's journal.  It covers her years at Larkhill.  It might contain the whole story. \nDominic searches for something more to say when Finch does not answer. \nAfter a moment, Finch looks at the book in Dominic's hand, then takes it, leafing through the pages.  They flip by, a breathy sigh, rising to a cold wind. \nDELIA (V.O.) May 23rd... \nINT.  LARKHILL MEDICAL RESEARCH BLOCK - DAY - FLASHBACK \nA younger Dr. Surridge, one by one, administers a series of injections to her research stock. \nDELIA (V.O.) Prothero has hand picked my subjects.  Four dozen of them, none of which will be any use to me if I don't get to work soon. \nShe finishes an injection, Prothero encouraging the next subject.  We recognize her as the woman Prothero pointed at. \nDELIA (V.O.) They're so weak and pathetic I find myself hating them. \nDelia prepares the next dose, a sour look on her face. \nDELIA (V.O.) They don't fight or struggle.  Just stare at you with weak eyes. \nPROTHERO Next. \nINT.  LARKHILL OVENS - DAY - FLASHBACK \nTwo inmate orderlies are hefting sacked cadavers from a cart into an incinerator. \nDELIA (V.O.) June 9th: Of the original four dozen, over 75% are now deceased. Strangely, no clear patterns have emerged as of yet. \nAnother body thuds onto the pile. \nDELIA (V.O.) Batch 5 seems to have no common discernible effect on any specific group though the men seem slightly more resilient than the women. \nWhen it is full, they move to the next door until the cart is empty. \nDELIA (V.O.) I'm hoping the survivors will provide more answers or my time here will have gone to waste. \nRed heat suddenly glows from the oven vents as the orderly throws a series of switches. \nINT.  LARKHILL MEDICAL RESEARCH BLOCK - DAY - FLASHBACK \nDr. Surridge moves down the drab aseptic hallway accompanied by an armed guard.  Roman numerals on the doors to each cell ascend to five. \nDELIA (V.O.) June 18: And only five left now. Two men and three women.  Which tends to contradict my entry on the 9th. \nShe pauses at room five. \nDELIA (V.O.) The man in room five is a fascinating case. \nShe looks through the small chicken wire glass window in the door. \nDELIA (V.O.) Physically, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with him.  No cellular anomalies, nothing. \nEVEY You... \nHer mouth hangs open. \nEVEY You did this... to me. \nEvey's rail thin figure begins to shake. \nEVEY You did this to me! \nShe stumbles against the wall, unable to support herself. \nEVEY You -- You hit me and -- and cut my hair.  It was you.  It was just you all this time. \nShe doubles over, covering her face as she bursts into tears. \nEVEY You tortured me.  You tortured me -- \nEvey looks up at him, body shivering as he quietly glides toward her. \nEVEY Oh god, why? \nV Because I love you, Evey.  Because I wanted to set you free. \nEVEY Love? \nA look of horror twists her starved face. \nEVEY Set me free?  Don't you realize? \nSlender fingers ball into fists. \nEVEY Don't you realize what you did to me?  You nearly drove me mad! \nDisgust and anger light up her eyes. \nEVEY I hate you. \nHer little, wiry body coils tight as she circles him. \nEVEY I hate you!  Set me free?  You put me in a prison to set me free?! \nV You were already in a prison. You've been in a prison all your life. \nEVEY Shut up!  I don't want to hear it. I wasn't in a prison.  I was happy! I was happy here -- \nV Happiness is the most insidious prison of all, Evey. \nEVEY That's warped!  That's evil and it's wrong!  What gives you the right to judge?  Who are you to say what's not good enough?! \nV You were born in a prison, Evey.  I didn't put you there.  I just showed you the bars.  You've been in a prison so long, you no longer believe there's an outside world. \nShe wheels away from him, covering her ears, trying to get away from his voice. \nEVEY Shut up!  You're mad!  I don't want to hear it! \nV That's because you're afraid, Evey. You're afraid because you can feel freedom closing in on you.  You're afraid because freedom is terrifying. \nEvey falls, stumbling through the labyrinth of the Shadow Gallery. \nEVEY I can't feel anything!  There's nothing left to feel!  Don't you understand? \nV Don't back away from it, Evey. Part of you understands the truth even as part pretends not to. \nShe collapses, head pounding. \nV Woman, this is the most important moment in your life.  Don't run from it. \nEVEY I don't know what -- Oh god -- I can't breathe -- \nV couches next to her. \nV Good.  You're almost there.  Go closer.  Feel the shape of it. \nEVEY What are you doing to me?  I can't breathe -- \nV You were in a cell.  They offered you a choice between the death of your principles and the death of your body. \nHe cradles her as she hyperventilates, tears streaming down her face. \nEVEY I feel -- I feel like I'm going to burst. \nV You said you'd rather die.  You faced the fear of your own death and you were calm.  Try to feel now what you felt then. \nEVEY Oh god -- I felt -- \nThe mask hovers over her. \nEVEY Like an angel -- \nHe squeezes her shuddering body. \nEVEY Oh god, V, I'm so scared.  What's happening to me? \nV The door of the cage is open, Evey. All that you feel is the wind from outside.  Don't be afraid. \nGently, he lifts her. \nV Try to walk.  The lift will take us to the roof. \nEVEY The roof?  Outside? \nHe helps her to an open elevator. \nEVEY I -- I don't want to be blindfolded. \nV No, Evey.  No more blindfolds. \nThe cage in the elevator rattles shut. \nEXT.  ROOF - NIGHT \nDASCOMBE For god's sake, Adam, it's a stupid variety show. \nLEADER Mr. Creedy, I want the producers, writers, and actors of that \"stupid variety show\" arrested and charged with sedition. \nCREEDY Yes, sir. \nDASCOMBE You can't be serious -- \nLEADER Push me, Roger, push me and you'll find out how serious I am. \nHe stares each of them to silence. \nLEADER This, this V is still out there.  I can feel him like a sickness worming its way into the hearts and minds of the public.  Something must be done, and done quickly, to exorcise this demon for the very soul of this country is at stake. \nHe pauses. \nLEADER That is why I am compelled to give each and every one of you notice that if by the fifth of November you are still giving me nothing more than excuses, I will have to revoke your party status and terminate your positions. \nEveryone is stunned. \nLEADER Mr. Creedy, I will speak with you in private.  The rest of you are dismissed.  England prevails. \nINT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS \nThe Leader stands at the window. \nLEADER Mr. Creedy, as the new head of the Finger, you are the most important member of my cabinet. \nCREEDY I, uh, appreciate your faith in me. \nLEADER Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a good man, a man who understood what strength in unity meant, a man who, above all, loved his country.  I need to know if you are such a man. \nHis eyes bore into him. \nLEADER Do you love your country, Mr. Creedy? \nEXT.  ALLEYWAY \nA police car is parked in a dark alley.  It is raining and the windows of the car are completely steamed. \nCREEDY Oh god, yes! \nHe is sweating, his knuckles white as he squeezes the steering wheel, panting. \nWe hear a noise like a very wet kiss and then a woman's voice. \nHELEN \"The most important member of my cabinet.\"  Yes it is, isn't it, dear? \nHelen lifts her head out of his lap.  Her lipstick is smeared about her mouth. \nCREEDY Oh, don't stop. \nHELEN I stop when you stop.  What did he say next? \nCREEDY I can't -- \nShe whispers in his ear while playing with his lap. \nHELEN Come on, Peter, what are you afraid of?  Almond used to tell me everything and you're twice the man he was. \nCREEDY He asked me... if I loved my country. \nHELEN Oh yes, I can tell you do love your country, almost as much as you love this... \nShe lowers her head into this lap. \nCREEDY Oh god... \nHELEN Go on. \nCREEDY Then he asked me to do something... oh, oh... \nHELEN What? \nCREEDY Helen, I can't.  I can't tell you. \nHelen lifts her head. \nHELEN He told you to frame someone as the terrorist. \nCREEDY My god?!  How did you know that? \nHELEN I know Adam Susan.  Now who was it? \nCREEDY No way.  I can't tell you that. \nHELEN Yes you can, honey.  You can and you will.  You have to trust me, love.  We're going to help each other. \nCREEDY Helen, please. \nHELEN Look at that face.  You see? You're just bursting to tell me. \nHer head drops back down.  Creedy moans. \nHELEN Now who was it? \nCREEDY It was... Fi... Fi... FINCH! \nThe name seems to orgasm from his mouth. \nINT.  FINCH'S APARTMENT \nFinch sits alone in his modest apartment, reading a book. The book is Koesterler's, \"The Roots of Coincidence.\" \nAn old CD player is playing music, a Bach piano concerto. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nV is playing the exact same concerto on his piano, his gloved fingers gracefully flitting across the keys. \nEvey enters the gallery.  Her hair has grown out but is still short.  She projects a kind of strength that comes from a deep inner peace. \nV I just thought I might ask them to turn it on for me. \nINT.  LEADER'S OFFICE \nThe Leader sits bathed in the flickering images of the Fate computer. \nLEADER Yes, Mr. Creedy? \nCREEDY Everything's set, sir.  No worries. \nLEADER When? \nCREEDY Tonight. \nOn one of the screens, a television program has just begun. \nANNOUNCER Tonight on Tales from the Bible, a story of treachery and betrayal from the Book of Daniel. \nWe cut from that screen to another screen -- \nINT.  JORDAN TOWER - CONTROL BOOTH \nThe television studio where Roger Dascombe surveys a large bank of monitors filled with the images of typically vapid television entertainment. \nDASCOMBE All of London's waiting.  Ready, two.  And here we go -- \nA player locks on as a recorded program begins.  We move in as the logo slashes across the screen: Storm Saxon. \nANNOUNCER Tonight, England's greatest hero repels the forces of darkness in a brand new episode. \nWe pull back from the show's opening teaser and find ourselves looking at a small television. \nINT.  JORDAN TOWER \nIn the delivery bay at the back of Jordan tower, five security guards are riveted to the heroic actions of Storm Saxon. \nHEIDI Oh, Storm.  Save me!  Save me! \nSTORM You mongrel trash, if you harm her! \nMONGREL TRASH Look out, de white debil has a laser lugar! \nBehind them, a shadowy figure in a cloak and tall hat enters the loading bay. \nGUARD Hey, what the -- ? \nThey all turn and find a smiling V. \nThey go for their weapons.  V goes for them.  It is brutal and quick, knives slicing in bloody arcs, bodies kicked and thrown with superhuman power. \nThe TV crashes to the ground and we move in at it as Storm Saxon stands triumphant beside his buxom lass. \nHEIDI Oh Storm, hold me.  Hold me tight. \nWe pull back on another television screen inside -- \nINT.  FINCH'S OFFICE \nDominic is chewing on a hamburger, engrossed in Storm Saxon. Across the room, Finch is reading the \"Roots of Coincidence.\" \nFINCH I don't know how you stand that tripe. \nDominic answers with a mouthful of cheeseburger. \nDOMINIC Es gooh. \nFinch shakes his head, reaching for his pipe.  He realizes he is out of tobacco.  He slides open the bottom desk drawer and his eyes almost pop out of his head. \nHe stares into the drawer like someone staring at his own tombstone. \nDOMINIC Finch?  Finch, what's wrong? \nSlowly, he lifts something from the drawer.  On his desk, he lays out several knives, a cloak, a hat, and a smiling mask. \nDOMINIC What the hell? \nFinch lifts the mask and almost has to laugh. \nFINCH Don't you see, Dominic? \nHe puts the mask to his face. \nFINCH I'm V. \nINT.  JORDAN TOWER \nV emerges from an elevator and immediately attacks several more guards.  A surveillance camera watches as V steps over their slumped, broken bodies. \nINT.  CONTROL CENTER \nThe security guard sees V on the monitor coming directly down the hall. \nGUARD Bloody hell! \nHe grabs the machine gun, aiming it just as V kicks open the door. \nGUARD Freeze! \nV stops.  At least five guards have trained their weapons on him.  He is surrounded. \nSlowly, he lifts his arms as though surrendering.  His cloak opens, revealing enough TNT to level the entire building.  In his hand is the plunger detonator. \nGUARD Fuck all. \nV nods. \nINT.  FINCH'S OFFICE \nThe door bursts open as Creedy and a group of heavily armed Fingermen muscle in. \nDOMINIC Creedy?  What the hell's going on? \nCAPTAIN Yes, sir. \nINT.  FINCH'S CAR \nFinch can see the forces gathering outside Jordan tower. \nV (V.O.) But, you ask, who am I to make such promises?  A fair question but hardly necessary as you know me already.  To know me any more you need only look to a mirror. \nFinch catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror. \nINT.  CONTROL BOOTH \nVTV fills every screen. \nV Truth be told, this wasn't even my idea, was it?  If you think back, you'll remember that night, whispering in your lover's arms.  I became a part of your plan just as you have now become part of mine. Give me the line of the queen and I'll give you your secret dream. \nINT.  JORDAN TOWER - HALLWAY \nA heavy battering ram is rushed down the hall, carried by four soldiers. \nV (V.O.) On the twelfth stroke of the fifth day of the eleventh month, I hope we shall all meet again. \nEXT.  TELEVISION STORE \nThe crowd is much larger. \nV Until then, I bid you goodnight. \nEvery screen suddenly goes black.  The crowd turns to each other, unsure of what to do. \nINT.  CONTROL BOOTH \nThe door explodes open.  V is standing alone, almost as if waiting for them. \nBefore he can even move, they shoot.  Machine gun fire lights up the room.  V's body dances and jerks backward, smashing through an observation window -- \nFalling to the television stage below. \nINT.  HALL \nA path is cleared for the Leader.  As he heads into the television studio, an armed soldier is heading in the opposite direction. \nIt is impossible to tell because of the dark face plate but it looks like the soldier is smiling. \nThe Leader shoves his way onto the main stage.  A group of soldiers is gathered around the body. \nLEADER Who was it?  Who was he? \nThe mask is pried off, revealing the lifeless face of Roger Dascombe.  To the Leader, it is an obvious revelation. \nLEADER Roger Dascombe!  Of course.  Of course!  It makes such perfect sense. \nCAPTAIN Sir, I think there has been a mistake. \nLEADER No!  There is no mistake! \nCAPTAIN But sir, there are people that say they saw both the terrorist and Dascombe together -- \nLEADER Who?  Who are these people?  They must be detained immediately. Whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and the terrorist is dead! \nFINCH But I thought I was the terrorist. \nFinch's voice stops the Leader cold. \nLEADER Finch, what are you doing here? \nFINCH Since I'm not in jail and since you have another, even more convenient suspect.  I'm guessing the charges have been dropped. \nLEADER Be careful, Finch. \nFINCH I am careful, sir.  Always.  That is why I suggest that a search of this building begin immediately. \nLEADER The terrorist is dead! \nFINCH With all due respect, I disagree and I believe that he is presently trying to get out of this building disguised as one of us. \nLEADER Are you challenging my authority? \nFINCH No sir, I'm trying to run an investigation -- \nLEADER I am trying to run a country!  When I tell you, Mr. Finch, the terrorist is dead, then the terrorist is dead!  If you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but to have you arrested on charges of sedition. Do I make myself clear? \nHe eyes the room.  Everyone is silent. \nLEADER Now, it is imperative for the people of London to know that they are safe, that the terrorist is dead and everything is under control. \nThe Leader storms past Finch who looks at Dascombe and bites down on his pipe. \nEXT.  CITY STREET \nOne of the Ear's black vans has been modified with large speakers wired to the roof.  As the van rolls down the street, the speakers drone with a looped message. \nSPEAKERS The terrorist is dead.  No further threat exists.  Everything is under control. \nOut of the back, soldiers hurl leaflets that swirl and flutter in the van's wake. \nThe little girl on the bicycle that we saw earlier stops and picks up one of the leaflets. \nIt has a picture with the body of Roger Dascombe beneath the headline, \"The terrorist is dead!  London is safe once again!\" \nLITTLE GIRL Bollocks. \nShe crumbles the leaflet and throws it. \nLITTLE GIRL Bollocks! \nShe gets off her bike and takes something out of the backpack. \nLITTLE GIRL He's not dead!  It's all bollocks! \nTurning to a nearby wall, she spray paints a large circle around a \"V\". \nEXT.  TELEVISION STORE - NIGHT \nNo one is watching. \nLEADER What we have endured this long year was no accident, no mere coincidence.  This was not a simple act of terror conducted by a singular madman.  No, this was a test. \nINT.  KITTY KAT KELLER \nA drunk struggles up onto his bar stool blocking the TV. \nLEADER It was not me, nor the Party, nor the government that was threatened this year.  It was our beliefs. Our faith.  I believe that God himself bore witness to our struggle and like Job I believe that we have been vindicated. \nThe drunk raises his glass. \nDRUNK Remember fifth of November! \nThe bar cheers. \nINT.  LEADER'S OFFICE \nThe Leader reaches for his Bible. \nLEADER How do I know this?  Let me read to you where I found the answer, where I so often find the answer.  In the Scripture.  Revelations. \nEXT.  STREET CORNER - NIGHT \nThe megaphones blast the Leader's voice. \nLEADER (V.O.) \"If any man have an ear, let him hear.\" \nINT.  FINCH'S OFFICE \nThere are stacks of printout everywhere. \nLEADER (V.O.) \"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword shall be killed with the sword.  Here is the patience and faith of the Saints.\" \nFinch stops reading, listening to the radio. \nLEADER (V.O.) \"And I beheld another beast coming out of the Earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon.\" \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nAnother radio crackles with the Leader's voice. \nLEADER (V.O.) \"And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from Heaven on the Earth in the sight of men.\" \nV nods, almost laughing as Evey enters the gallery. \nLEADER (V.O.) \"And he deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those miracles which he had the power to do --\" \nEVEY Oh, V, turn it off, please. \nV Of course, my dear. \nHe reaches over and changes the frequency.  We hear voices, hushed and secret but we recognize them. \nCREEDY (V.O.) But how does he know? \nHELEN (V.O.) I don't know.  All I know is he does... And I know what he wants. \nThe voices are labored, punctuated by gasps and moans. \nEVEY What is that, V? \nV That, Evey, is what I have been waiting for. \nCREEDY (V.O.) Do you know what I want?  I want you just like this... Bent over that black leather chair... \nWe are pulled by the radio into -- \nINT.  CREEDY'S BEDROOM \nWhere we see a tiny microphone hidden in the ceiling light above the bed. \nHelen moans as we drift down, glimpsing Helen, her arms reaching for the edges of the bed, her back arching up towards Creedy, behind her, smiling. \nCREEDY What about Conrad? \nHELEN I told you, I'll handle Conrad and V will take care of Susan.  The mob will take care of the guard and then... You can use the Finger to take over. \nCREEDY Use the Finger?  You mean like this? \nHe inserts a finger into her. \nHELEN Oh... oh... that is vulgar... \nCREEDY But you like it? \nHELEN Yes, oh yes, oh you're a pig, Peter... \nCREEDY That I am, misses.  But I'm the pig that's gonna be running this country. \nThat sends a shiver through Helen's body. \nHELEN Yes and I'm... I'm going to be Eva... Oh Eva... \nHer eyes close and her fists knot the sheets. \nHELEN \"Don't cry for me Argen... oh Argen... Argen... tina! \nThe word is almost lost in her orgasm. \nEXT.  LONDON \nThe sun rises over London.  It is the morning of the fourth. \nINT.  FINCH'S OFFICE \nFinch looks through the blinds at the morning sun.  He has been up all night.  He checks his watch: 6:00am. \nFINCH Eighteen hours. \nHELEN The terrorist. \nLEADER The terrorist is dead. \nHELEN Oh, how I wanted to believe it, Leader, but I know it's not true. \nLEADER How? \nHELEN Because I know who the terrorist is. \nINT.  LEADER'S OFFICE \nConrad is alone with Fate.  He glances about nervously, moving closer and closer.  His fingers reach out and graze the main keyboard.  Taking a deep breath, he turns and begins to type. \nINT.  PRIVATE QUARTERS \nThe Leader takes hold of Helen by her shoulders. \nLEADER Who?  Who is it, woman? \nHELEN It's Conrad, Leader.  Conrad.  My husband is the terrorist. \nLEADER What?! \nINT.  LEADER'S OFFICE \nConrad accesses the department of water and power.  He finds the correct file and begins rerouting power to a once dead system. \nINT.  V'S TRAIN STATION \nA hanging light suddenly sizzles to life.  V looks up, smiling. \nINT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS \nThe Leader stares hard at Helen. \nLEADER How do you know? \nHELEN I saw him, Leader.  In the middle of the night.  I heard something. I went to the landing and that's when I saw it. \nShe clutches him. \nHELEN That mask.  That hideous smiling mask. \nLEADER But how did you know it was Heyer? \nHELEN I know, Leader.  I know the way a woman knows. \nLEADER But you have no proof? \nHELEN Proof? \nLEADER Yes, proof?  This is an extremely delicate situation, Mrs. Heyer.  It has been reported that the terrorist is dead.  It would be a catastrophe to arrest a man now without concrete, conclusive proof. Do you have any evidence at all? \nTears well up in Helen's eyes as she shakes her head. \nLEADER But if you're right, if Heyer is indeed the terrorist... \nHis eyes fly wide and he spins away from her, throwing open the door. \nHELEN Leader!  Wait! \nINT.  LEADER'S OFFICE \nConrad sits calmly across the room. \nCONRAD Is everything all right?  Helen? \nLEADER Yes, Mr. Heyer, your wife has done her duty to her country. \nHe turns to Helen. \nLEADER Don't worry, Mrs. Heyer.  You will be taken care of.  I will launch an immediate investigation and I promise, you will be the first to know when an arrest will be made. \nCONRAD Investigation of what? \nLEADER Subversion, Mr. Heyer.  Your wife was privy to the dialogue of subversives.  That's all you need to know at this time.  Lieutenant! \nThe Lieutenant appears almost instantly. \nLEADER The Heyers are leaving.  I need to see Mr. Creedy at once. \nHelen looks up at the Leader, a smile hidden near the corners of her perfect red lips. \nHELEN Thank you, sir. \nThe Leader nods. \nINT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING \nHelen and Conrad get out of the elevator, standing beneath the rows of new party flags that line the lobby. \nHELEN I want you to go straight to your office and wait for me to call. When I do, I want you to come immediately home.  Understood? \nCONRAD Yes, Helen. \nShe embraces him, pressing her body against his. \nHELEN Oh, Conrad, I'm so proud of you. \nCONRAD I did it, Helen.  I did it, didn't I? \nHELEN Tonight, Conrad. \nCONRAD Tonight. \nHELEN I promise you will never forget tonight. \nShe almost kisses him. \nHELEN Goodbye, Conrad. \nGUARD But if Mr. Finch is right -- \nLEADER I am sick to death of this terrorist being everywhere and nowhere!  I will judge whether Mr. Finch is right and I will judge it with my own eyes!  Do I make myself clear, Captain? \nCAPTAIN Sir, yes, sir! \nFinch is suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling that is common to chess players.  It is the disturbing sense that you have just done exactly what your opponent wanted. \nLEADER Is there a problem, Mr. Finch? \nFINCH No... no sir. \nLEADER Good.  Captain, mobilize your men. \nCAPTAIN Sir, yes, sir. \nLEADER We'll find this bloody bastard and we will finish him. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nEvey sits in the gallery, reading Pynchon's \"V\" just as V had done.  She suddenly feels V watching her. \nEVEY V? \nV Yes. \nEvey smiles as V steps out of the shadows. \nEVEY V, what's going to happen? \nV Change, Evey.  That's all.  Just change. \nEVEY Is it going to be violent? \nV Yes, I suppose it will. \nINT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE \nCreedy empties a bottom drawer, making room to hide the costume.  As he does, the closet door behind him slowly creeps open. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nV stands at the jukebox. \nEVEY But why?  Why must is be violent? \nV Because, Evey, that is the nature of change.  She is a temperamental creature that appears in earnest rarely but, when she does, she will wear one of two faces.  The first face is the destroyer.  It is lamentable but all true change begins with death. \nINT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE \nA dark figure stands over Creedy.  The hammer raises, a slash of silver against the velvety darkness. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nV punches a button on the jukebox just as -- \nINT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE \nThe hammer falls with a sickening soft crunch. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nThe song begins to play; a melancholy song that says goodbye to love. \nINT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE \nBlood pours down Creedy's snarling face, he snatches one of V's knives as another hammer blow cracks through his collar bone. \nHe screams, lunging at Conrad. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nV listens to the song, the smiling eyes somehow knowing. \nINT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE \nThe hammer falls again and again until the metal head is slick with blood and meat. \nConrad stumbles back, dropping the hammer.  He looks down at the hilt of the knife protruding from his stomach.  He yanks it out and holds V's knife which is bright red with his own blood. \nHe collapses to the floor. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nThe song continues. \nEVEY What is the other face, V? \nV The other face?  She is the true face of change.  The face of the creator.  She is the one that remakes the world.  Evey? \nEVEY Yes, V? \nV May I ask you for a favor? \nEVEY Of course. \nV It is a small thing but it would mean a great deal to me. \nEVEY Tell me. \nV I've never danced before.  I've thought about it many times, here in this room, listening to the music.  But I've always been alone. \nEvey smiles and crosses to him. \nEVEY It would be my pleasure. \nHe opens his arms and she steps into them.  They dance, standing very close, his gloved hand holding tightly to hers, her smile against his. \nEXT.  CITY STREET \nDozens of military vehicles swarm around the entrance to Victoria Station while heavily armed men pour through the gates of the underground. \nLEADER Captain!  Captain, where are your men? \nThe station fills with the sound of boots running wildly away. \nLEADER Goddammit, I will not tolerate this insubordination!  I want those deserters shot, Captain. \nFinch slowly draws back away from the Leader. \nLEADER Shot on sight! \nThe few men on the platform are soon the only men left. \nCAPTAIN You!  You!  Point position.  We're getting out of here!  Now! \nA knife sings through the air and buries itself in the Captain's chest.  With a tiny rasp, he falls to the ground. \nThe remaining men bolt. \nLEADER Traitors!  You cowards! \nHe grabs for the Captain's machine gun. \nLEADER I know who you are!  I'll see you hang!  Every last one of you! \n\"You\" echoes down the dark empty throat of the tunnel. \nThe Leader looks around, his flashlight sweeping in big arcs as he realizes that he is alone. \nLEADER Finch?  Finch!  Finch, goddammit, you can't leave me!  Don't leave me! \nV You are going to die as you ruled -- \nThe Leader screams, whipping around towards the voice. \nV Alone. \nThe smile is as cold and as sharp as the knife that flicks from his hand. \nThe Leader raises his gun just when the knife sinks into his shoulder. \nHowling in pain, he drops the gun. \nLEADER Damn you!  Damn you! \nV smiles into the spot of his flashlight. \nLEADER Conrad?  Is that you?  You're working with Finch, aren't you? And Creedy!  You're all in this together! \nV closes in. \nLEADER Who are you? \nV You, most of all, should know, Leader.  You created me.  Without you, I would never be.  More than life, Leader, you gave me purpose. \nV draws his final blade. \nV \"He that killeth with the sword, shall be killed with the sword.\" \nV raises the knife. \nLEADER Noooo! \nFINCH Don't move! \nV and the Leader turn to find Finch aiming a machine gun at V. \nLEADER Mr. Finch!  Oh god, Mr. Finch! \nFINCH Drop the knife. \nV does and Susan begins an almost hysterical laugh. \nLEADER Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch.  I knew you wouldn't desert me.  You're a good man, Finch.  A damn good man. \nFINCH No, Mr. Susan.  No, I'm not.  I'm a man who does his job and does what he's told.  For twenty seven years, that's all I've been. \nHe steps toward V, staring into his smiling black eyes. \nLEADER Careful, Mr. Finch.  He's quick as the devil. \nFinch ignores the Leader. \nFINCH I've read Delia's diary over and over all year.  It sickens me but I am unable to judge her.  I am as guilty as she. \nLEADER Mr. Finch, what are you doing? Shoot him.  Kill the bastard, Finch. \nFINCH I have no excuse.  I did what I was told to do. \nLEADER Finch, I order you to shoot him! Finch! \nFINCH My job was to find you and catch you.  I've done my job.  I've done it for the last time.  I'm tired of it.  I'm tired of it all. \nHe tosses the gun to the Leader. \nFINCH Kill him yourself if you can. \nThe Leader seethes, his eyes boring into Finch. \nFINCH Thank you, V.  And goodbye. \nV Goodbye, Mr. Finch. \nThe machine gun burst shatters the quiet concrete silence. Finch falls dead at V's feet. \nLEADER I warned you, Finch, the penalty for treason is death. \nHe aims the gun at V. \nLEADER Are you ready to die? \nV The real question is, are you? \nEVEY You need a doctor. \nV It's too late for that... \nEVEY No, don't say that! \nV Evey, listen to me.  I've not long and there are things that must be said. \nHis voice strains beneath the mask. \nV I have done that which I came to do.  Now, it is time for me to rest and with me the past will, at last, find peace. \nTrembling, Evey holds him. \nV But the world, the world is not saved... Do not think that, when the fires die and the smoke clears, there is no miracle... there is only a path... upon which they must learn to rule themselves. \nEVEY Yes, they need you, V. \nV Not me, Evey, not me.  I told you I am the villain.  The destroyer... But yes, they will need help... \nHe reaches up and wipes a tear from her cheek. \nV I kept my promise to you, Evey... Now you must promise me. \nEVEY What? \nV Promise me... you will discover the face under this mask... but you will never look beneath it. \nEVEY I don't understand. \nV Promise me.  Please... \nEVEY I promise. \nV Sweet Eve.  Wherever I shall go, I shall always love you. \nEVEY V, you are not going anywhere! \nV Midnight... Midnight.  Eve... Make them remember... \nEVEY You're not going to die, V! \nV Let me be there, Evey, when it begins... Please, let me hear the music, one last time... my music... \nEVEY I won't let you die! \nV I know you won't... I know... \nEVEY V! \nV My love... Ave Atque vale... \nHolding him as tight as she can, she feels his life drain away, slipping through her arms in the way the last grains of sand pour through the neck of the hourglass. \nShe buries her face beside his and weeps. \nEXT.  CITY STREET \nAn enormous crowd has begun to gather in the streets surrounding the New Government Building.  With the crowd, a restlessness swells against each barricade erected by the military. \nA sergeant stands on an armored car, speaking through a megaphone. \nSERGEANT Return to your homes!  There is nothing to see!  The terrorist is dead! \nRABBLE ROUSER 1 He ain't dead! \nRABBLE ROUSER 2 He'll be here, just like he said! \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nEvey huddles against the stair railing, her face tear stained, staring at the lifeless body of V. \nEVEY (V.O.) I remember... I remember staring at the mask, at that smile. \nShe touches the mask, her fingers finding its edge. \nEVEY (V.O.) Part of me couldn't believe he was dead and maybe that was why.  The smile was still the same. It made me want to tear it off so I could see the face, so I could see that he was dead. \nHer fingers stop. \nEVEY (V.O.) But I had promised. \nV (V.O.) You will discover the face under this mask but you will never look beneath it. \nEVEY (V.O.) I began to try to imagine his face. Of course, I had long pictured my father behind that smile but I knew in my heart that V was not my father. \nEvey stares into the eyes, the dark, empty eyes. \nEVEY (V.O.) Yet every time I pictured another face, any face, something was lost, something important was somehow diminished.  V was more than a face.  V was V. \nHer expression changes. \nEVEY (V.O.) And then, quite suddenly, quite naturally, I realized whose face must be beneath that mask.  It was the only face that mattered. \nEVEY I won't let you die. \nV (V.O.) I know you won't... I know. \nA small smile creeps across her face. \nEXT.  CITY STREET \nMidnight approaches and the crowd feels it.  Spilling everywhere, they fill the streets like a flood. \nINT.  TRAIN CAR \nEvey sets a final violet carson on the chest of V.  He is lying on a bed made of gelignite, covered in roses. \nTouching his mask, she bends over him. \nEVEY Goodbye, my love. \n", "test1_input": "Finch starts it again and this time the tape is very fuzzy. \nFINCH What is it? \nDOMINIC 23rd Psalm. \nWe recognize some of the words though muted and crackly. \nTAPE (V.O.) Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... \nDOMINIC It goes on like that for a while. Fairly incoherent except we could make out a few words in this part. Transubstantiation. \nFinch nods, understanding. \nDOMINIC That miracle business when the wafer transform into the body of Christ. \nFINCH He made him eat a host. \nDOMINIC Yes, listen to this part. \nThe tape becomes somewhat clearer as the music rests. \nTAPE (V.O.) ... And at the moment this enters your mouth it becomes the flesh of the savior?  Yes... please... And whatever it is made of now it will become the body of Christ?  Yes... yes... \nThey eye each other. \nTAPE (V.O.) I want you to swallow it. \nDOMINIC There's a couple of funny human noises... \nFINCH And then just Beethoven's fifth. \nHe shuts off the tape. \nFINCH We have got the initial path report back.  The host was full of cyanide. \nFinch picks up the bag with the violet carson. \nFINCH And do you know what? \nHe rises, sliding into his jacket. \nFINCH When it reached his abdomen, it was still cyanide. \nINT.  MORGUE \nClose on the heavy stitching of a \"Y\" incision sewn into the chest of a corpse.  It is one of the Bishop's guards. \nDELIA Do you have a motive? \nFinch is standing next to the cadaver gurney with the coroner, Delia Surridge.  She is a serious woman, hair wound tight behind her head in a severe bun. \nDELIA I mean, was anything taken? \nShe fills the dead man's head with cotton and replaces the top of his skull. \nFINCH Just lives. \nPulling at the man's scalp, she stretches it over the replaced skull piece. \nFINCH I know it's too early for your profile but do you have any initial impressions? \nDELIA Well... \nShe points at a jagged puncture wound at the base of the man's sternum with a ball point pen. \nDELIA He's incredibly powerful.  This man's sternum was split like dry wood from the base all the way up to the manubrium. \nFinch peers into the hole. \nDELIA And he's resourceful.  On that table behind you is a breakdown of all the chemicals found in Prothero's blood stream. \nFinch hefts the pile of computer paper. \nFINCH Bloody hell. \nDELIA There were hundreds of different chemicals in him.  From trinitrotoluene to estrogen to motor oil. \nHe flips through the document, biting into the wooden end of his pipe. \nFINCH Perhaps Fate will make something more of all this.  I certainly can't. \nDELIA The Leader finally authorized an uplink for you?  He must be getting nervous. \nFINCH Quite.  Government directed terrorism never sews healthy ideas into the public.  Oh, that reminds me. \nFinch pulls the evidence bag from his pocket. \nFINCH Can you tell us anything about this? \nDelia's eyes lock onto the violet carson. \nFINCH We found one in the carriage with Prothero and this one in the Bishop's quarters.  A violet carson. \nHe hands it to her. \nFINCH I heard that strain had died off. Thought a botanist might shed some light on it.  Delia? \nDelia, riveted to the rose, suddenly looks up to him. \nDELIA Yes -- Yes, of course. \nFINCH Magic.  I'll drop by tomorrow then. \nHe turns, leaving her with the rose. \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nV relaxes with a book in an overstuffed reading chair, a violet carson rose resting on a table next to him.

It is Evey, a frightened look on her face. \nINT.  KITTY KAT KELLER \nA woman in combat boots, fishnets, and a tight fitting soldier's uniform is in the middle of a cheeky number on stage in this smoky burlesque bar.  It is a popular place with locals and Fingermen. \nPeter Creedy squeezes through the crowd, angling for the back of the bar where a number of loud Fingermen are drinking. \nCREEDY What's all this, then, Harper?  I get a radio that a man's down and in need of assistance? \nHARPER I ain't gone down yet but I sure do need some assistance. \nCreedy leans in. \nCREEDY Are you flat broke already? \nThey break up in laughter, led by Creedy who sits next to Harper, pouring himself a drink. \nLOUT How'd you sneak away, Creedy? Almond off buggering that blonde chippy? \nHARPER The one with the tits? \nThey all begin to hoot and whistle. \nCREEDY What I wouldn't give for a piece of that. \nLOUT She could serve a tray of drinks on those thingies. \nHARPER I bet you get your chance with her sooner than later, Creedy, with the way Almond's crackin' up. \nLOUT Bloody bugger's losing his marbles. \nHARPER Terrorist or no, if that bastard gives me another double shift, I'll stomp his fucking head. \nCreedy raises his drink. \nCREEDY Aye.  This nonsense has put a serious strain on my drinking.  I think I was actually sober today. \nLOUT I'll drink to that. \nHARPER We need to get a real man of the people in that director's position. Like Creedy here. \nEveryone cheers in agreement. \nCREEDY Well, it's good to know when the shit hits the fan who your real friends are. \nThey salute and drink. \nINT.  ALMOND HOME \nDerek Almond sits hunched under a desk lamp, pumping the cylinders of his revolver with a wire brush. \nRosemary shuffles up to him, her frumpy gown gathered around her. \nROSEMARY Derek -- \nHe blows down one of the cylinders, not looking up. \nDEREK I don't want to hear it, Rosemary. \nROSEMARY Derek, please!  We can't carry on like this. \nDerek stares at the gun, rage building. \nROSEMARY You don't talk to me.  You don't eat with me.  You don't have sex -- \nDerek leaps up, slugging her. \nRosemary clatters to the ground in tears.  Derek glowering over her. \nDEREK I don't have to take any crap from you!  I have that fat bastard riding me all day.  I don't want to listen to you, so shut your fat gob! \nHe leans into her face. \nDEREK And me not wanting to fuck you is obvious.  Take a look at yourself. \nHe sits back in front of the gun, wiping it down. \nDEREK Get out of my sight.  I'm cleaning my gun. \nINT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME \nDr. Surridge sits somberly in the dark, street light filtering in from the open curtains. \nHer eyes fixed on the violet carson as she slowly turns it over in her hands, fingers tracing the soft petals. \nAfter a moment, she stands, letting it fall from her lap. \nINT.

Prothero's and Lilliman's employment records show they both help positions there at similar times. \nFINCH What about codename V? \nDOMINIC Most of Larkhill's records were destroyed for security reasons but I did uncover an old standard procedures and operations manual. \nDominic smiles. \n", "test1_id": 2472, "test2_input": "FINCH What if he's planning something else? \nThe lighter slips back into his pocket. \nFINCH You see, the diary we found was in full view.  We didn't have to search for it.  He left it there. He wanted us to find it.  He wanted us to know the story.  Or... \nFinch returns to his chair, letting out a huge cloud. \nFINCH For all we know, the diary could be a complete and utter fake. Codename V could have written it himself. \nFinch leans forward. \nFINCH He's playing games with us.  He might never have been at Larkhill at all.  Do you see?  It could all be another smoke screen, a false trail, another cover story -- \nLEADER Enough! \nSusan punches the desk. \nLEADER Mr. Finch, would you please explain to me the nature of this meeting?! Because I was under the impression that you had some information about the terrorist, codename V! \nAnd punches it again until his fist hurts. \nLEADER No more questions, understand!  I want answers!  I am not interested in where he grew up, what kind of flowers he likes or his favorite color! \nSusan's collar chokes his face to an unnatural crimson. \nLEADER Do I make myself clear? \nFINCH Yes, Leader. \nAfter a moment, Finch stands, Susan hanging on his last word. \nLEADER Dismissed.

Still sluggish from the chloroform, Evey looks down at the coarse slipover she's now wearing. \nOne of the men, Rossiter, crosses toward Evey, swinging a pair of shackles.  He grabs Evey, slamming her face down into the hard cot, driving a knee between her shoulder blades. \nEvey screams. \nGUARD 1 Tsk.  This pathetic whore is the famous Miss Hammond? \nThe shackles bite down on her wrists as they laugh in the hall. \nEVEY You've made a mistake. \nRossiter stands her up, shoving her into the wall. \nROSSITER Shut up. \nEVEY Please.  I haven't done anything -- \nHe slides a thick hood over her head. \nROSSITER I said shut your hole! \nINT.  INTERROGATION ROOM \nThe hood is lifted from her head.  Evey squints hard, awash in a blinding, burning light. \nA man sits, unmoving, at a desk across from her, a guard at his side, both backlit by a harsh white kliegs. \nEvey's eyes start to water as she blinks. \nINTERROGATOR Do you know why you're here.  Evey Hammond? \nEVEY No, please, I didn't do anything. \nINTERROGATOR Allow me to be more precise.

From the snowy static, an image begins to form. \nA girl is talking to a man.  She is shoving her hips at him, propositioning him.

We have over 120 minutes of audio and videotape and 75 pages of testimonials from eye witness that identify you as an accomplice to the terrorist, codename V. \nThe monitor blinks off. \nINTERROGATOR Do you want to know why you're here?  You are formally being brought up on charges of murder on fourteen counts and sedition against your Leader and country which brings an automatic sentence of death. \nEVEY Please.  I didn't do anything. \nINTERROGATOR Process the prisoner and return her to her cell until she is more cooperative. \nRossiter slips the hood back over Evey's head. \nINT.

Her husband's face is contorted in disgust. \nVALERIE (V.O.) A week later I moved to London to go to college and study drama.  My mother said I broke her heart. \nEXT.  PARK - DAY - FLASHBACK \nTwo young women cuddle on a park bench under a London summer sky, feeding the pigeons. \nVALERIE (V.O.) But it was my integrity that was important.  Is that so selfish?

You could be out inside three years.  Perhaps they'd find you a job with the Finger. \nEvey closes her eyes. \nEVEY Thank you but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds. \nHer last words hang in the air. \nROSSITER Then there's nothing left to threaten you with, is there?  You are free. \nHe turns and leaves. \nEVEY What? \nShe listens as his footsteps fade down the hall, the door hanging weirdly open. \nEvey takes a few tentative steps toward the door and sticks her head out into the empty hall, peering down both ways. \nSlowly, she emerges from her cell, retracing her path down the hall that her blindfold never allowed her to see. \nQuietly inching along the wall, Evey peeks around a corner, gasping at the rigid guard standing off to the side.  There is something about the man's frozen stare that keeps her from running. \nEvey straightens and crosses to the guard. \nIt is a mannequin. \nShe touches him, the wheeled platform he is mounted on rolling back against the wall. \nINT.  INTERROGATION ROOM \nThe door creaks open as Evey enters the room where for so long she was questioned and tortured. \nShe crosses to the frozen Interrogator sitting at his desk. \nHer finger brushes lightly against the plastic hand, then Evey raps a knuckle on his hollow wooden head.  Around his neck a small speaker hangs from a cord. \nEvey drifts uneasily into a back room where a discarded prison guard's uniform hangs on a rack.  On a table next to a wig and pair of gloves, the rat looks up at her through the bars of its tiny cage. \nShe moves through another door, the wind suddenly knocked from her chest as she finally sees where her prison was built -- \nINT.  SHADOW GALLERY \nV steps from the shadows. \nV Welcome home, Evey. \n", "test3_id": 2474}

What we did -- What I did.  That terrible knowledge, it's been with me so long.  That I could do things like that. \nDelia rubs the salty tears from her eyes. \nDELIA For years, I blamed it on the government, on the authority I could never stand up to.  But living so long with the knowledge of what I did has made me understand otherwise.  I alone was accountable. \nV watches her. \nDELIA There is something wrong with us. With all of mankind.

Didn't know we'd rumbled you? \nHe squints. \nDEREK It's all finished, chummy.  All of it.  The old man told me it was my head or yours and what do you know.

Still sluggish from the chloroform, Evey looks down at the coarse slipover she's now wearing. \nOne of the men, Rossiter, crosses toward Evey, swinging a pair of shackles.  He grabs Evey, slamming her face down into the hard cot, driving a knee between her shoulder blades. \nEvey screams. \nGUARD 1 Tsk.  This pathetic whore is the famous Miss Hammond? \nThe shackles bite down on her wrists as they laugh in the hall. \nEVEY You've made a mistake. \nRossiter stands her up, shoving her into the wall. \nROSSITER Shut up. \nEVEY Please.  I haven't done anything -- \nHe slides a thick hood over her head. \nROSSITER I said shut your hole! \nINT.  INTERROGATION ROOM \nThe hood is lifted from her head.  Evey squints hard, awash in a blinding, burning light. \nA man sits, unmoving, at a desk across from her, a guard at his side, both backlit by a harsh white kliegs. \nEvey's eyes start to water as she blinks. \nINTERROGATOR Do you know why you're here.  Evey Hammond? \nEVEY No, please, I didn't do anything. \nINTERROGATOR Allow me to be more precise.

From the snowy static, an image begins to form. \nA girl is talking to a man.  She is shoving her hips at him, propositioning him.

CELL \nEvey is curled up on the cot like a dry fetus, now gaunt arms wrapped around her legs.  She blinks when she hears something moving in the rat hole. \nEvey raises her head as something is pushed through the crevice. \nTentative fingers search the hole, pulling out a length of toilet paper.  Over every inch of it is a delicately scrawled message. \nWe move into the rathole, its edges slowly filling the frame until black. \nEXT.

Over and over... \nOn the table in front of her, there is a large wash basin of water.  Rossiter dunks her head into it. \nEVEY (V.O.) Her name was Valerie. \nINT.  CLASSROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK \nA teacher reads from her lesson plan in front of rows and rows of uniformed pubescences in this all girl private school.  Her voice drones on and on like Muzak. \nVALERIE (V.O.) I was born in a rainy burg in Nottingham in 1975.  I passed my eleven plus and went to girl's grammar. \nA blonde tomboy sneaks a smile to her curly haired friend next to her. \nVALERIE (V.O.) I met my first girlfriend at school.  Her name was Sara.  Her wrists.  Her wrists were beautiful. \nHer hand slides across the desk, fingers tickling the young flesh of Sara's wrist. \nThe teacher's voice slows, dropping octaves, becoming -- \nINT.  BIOLOGY LAB - DAY - FLASHBACK \nA man's voice. \nVALERIE (V.O.) I sat in biology class staring at the pickled rabbit fetus while Mr. Herd said it was an adolescent phase that people outgrew. \nValerie looks at Sara across the room, her head down in shame. \nVALERIE (V.O.) Sara did.  I didn't. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK \nTwo teenage girls stand in front of a middle aged couple. They are holding hands. \nVALERIE (V.O.) In 1994, I stopped pretending and took a girl called Christine home to meet my parents. \nThe greying woman repeats the sign of the cross over and over, sobbing into a handkerchief.  Her husband's face is contorted in disgust. \nVALERIE (V.O.) A week later I moved to London to go to college and study drama.  My mother said I broke her heart. \nEXT.  PARK - DAY - FLASHBACK \nTwo young women cuddle on a park bench under a London summer sky, feeding the pigeons. \nVALERIE (V.O.) But it was my integrity that was important.  Is that so selfish?  It sells for so little but it's all we have left in this place... \nThe black haired girl nibbles on the blonde's ear. \nVALERIE (V.O.) It is the very last inch of us... \nINT.

As he heads into the television studio, an armed soldier is heading in the opposite direction. \nIt is impossible to tell because of the dark face plate but it looks like the soldier is smiling. \nThe Leader shoves his way onto the main stage.  A group of soldiers is gathered around the body. \nLEADER Who was it?  Who was he? \nThe mask is pried off, revealing the lifeless face of Roger Dascombe.  To the Leader, it is an obvious revelation. \nLEADER Roger Dascombe!  Of course.  Of course!  It makes such perfect sense. \nCAPTAIN Sir, I think there has been a mistake. \nLEADER No!  There is no mistake! \nCAPTAIN But sir, there are people that say they saw both the terrorist and Dascombe together -- \nLEADER Who?  Who are these people?  They must be detained immediately. Whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and the terrorist is dead! \nFINCH But I thought I was the terrorist. \nFinch's voice stops the Leader cold. \nLEADER Finch, what are you doing here? \nFINCH Since I'm not in jail and since you have another, even more convenient suspect.  I'm guessing the charges have been dropped. \nLEADER Be careful, Finch. \nFINCH I am careful, sir.  Always.  That is why I suggest that a search of this building begin immediately. \nLEADER The terrorist is dead! \nFINCH With all due respect, I disagree and I believe that he is presently trying to get out of this building disguised as one of us. \nLEADER Are you challenging my authority? \nFINCH No sir, I'm trying to run an investigation -- \nLEADER I am trying to run a country!  When I tell you, Mr. Finch, the terrorist is dead, then the terrorist is dead!  If you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but to have you arrested on charges of sedition.

As the van rolls down the street, the speakers drone with a looped message. \nSPEAKERS The terrorist is dead.  No further threat exists.  Everything is under control. \nOut of the back, soldiers hurl leaflets that swirl and flutter in the van's wake. \nThe little girl on the bicycle that we saw earlier stops and picks up one of the leaflets. \nIt has a picture with the body of Roger Dascombe beneath the headline, \"The terrorist is dead!  London is safe once again!\" \nLITTLE GIRL Bollocks. \nShe crumbles the leaflet and throws it. \nLITTLE GIRL Bollocks! \nShe gets off her bike and takes something out of the backpack. \nLITTLE GIRL He's not dead!

Here you can have a chocolate. Open up.  Open! \nShe shoves the candy in his mouth. \nHELEN Good boy.  As for the rest of the box, perhaps when you're Leader. \nShe smiles. \nHELEN Right now I need something else Conrad.  I need you to use that pretty little brain for me.

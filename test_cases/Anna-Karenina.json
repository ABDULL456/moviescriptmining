{"train": "ANNA KARENINA \nWritten by \nTom Stoppard \nBased on the novel by Leo Tolstoy. \nINT. POKROVSKOE--NIGHT \nCLOSE--Expert fingers--female, unlovely, capable--shape a small lump of dough which, with some shreds of cabbage, becomes a filled bun called a pirozhok . . . which is now placed on a baking tray to join rows of pirozhoki ready for the oven. \nCLOSE-- One hand opens the oven, and, mittened by an apron, removes a tray of perfectly baked pirozhoki, which the other hand replaces with the fresh tray . . . slightly burning itself on a knuckle. \nTITLE OVER: FEBRUARY 1872 POKROVSKOE, KONSTANTIN LEVIN'S ESTATE 300 MILES SOUTH OF MOSCOW: \nINT. KITCHEN, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nAgafia sucks her knuckle and checks what's cooking on the stove-top. She is the cook-housekeeper. \nAGAFIA He needs to come in if he's to wash himself. \nA Kitchen Maid at the sink obediently dries her hands on her apron. A dozing dog, Laska, pricks up her ears. \nEXT. YARD, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nIt's snowing. The Kitchen Maid, shawled, with a lantern, makes her way across the yard towards the cowshed, a short distance, and pushes open the frozen door. Laska is at her heels, but is made to stay outside. \nINT. COWSHED, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nThe herd stirs at the lantern light. The bull, Berkut, with a ring through his nose, snorts as the girl goes by. At the back of the shed a cow is calving. \nLevin is midwifing, sleeves pulled back, blood and slime up to his elbows. He is 34. His steward, Vasili, holds up a lantern. Levin pulls carefully at the emerging forefeet. \nLEVIN Good girl . . . good girl, Pava. \nThe calf's head emerges. \nKITCHEN MAID (ARRIVING) Agafia Mishaylovna says dinner's like to spoil. \nThe calf enters the world like a diver. Levin is feeling great pride and pleasure. \nLEVIN . . . her father's colour. \nVASILI Worth coming home for, Konstantin Dmitrich! \nLEVIN I stayed too long in Moscow. \nThe cow nuzzles and licks her calf. \nINT. DINING ROOM, POKROVSKOE--NIGHT \nCleaned up, in a smock shirt, Levin bites hungrily into a pirozhok, talking. He has a book on a book-rest. Agafia ladles soup for him. Three generations of family portraits look down on him. \nLEVIN . . . She's a beauty. That's twelve cows sired by Berkut! \nAGAFIA So one of you is doing what the good Lord made you for. \nLevin evades, ducks into spooning up soup, finding his place in his book. Agafia goes out. Alone, Levin closes the book and stares into himself. \nINT. (MOSCOW)-- DAY \nCLOSE--Expert fingers scrape a cut-throat razor across a lathered cheek . . . and again, skirting luxuriant facial hair on pampered skin. \nTITLE OVER: PRINCE OBLONSKY'S HOUSE, MOSCOW \nINT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY \nThere is a door to the landing and a door to the bedroom. \nPrince Stepan Oblonsky-- Stiva to his friends--is 34 and liked by every- body. A barber comes in every morning to shave him. His valet, Matvey, is older and almost a friend. He holds up an enormous pear. \nMATVEY What should I do with this? \nOblonsky puts the barber on hold to have a look. \nOBLONSKY Where did you find it? \nMATVEY In your hat. Your Excellency. \nOblonsky thinks about it, lets the barber finish. He stands and removes his dressing gown. \nOBLONSKY Yes . . . I picked it up somewhere for Daria Alexandrovna and the children. \nMatvey is ready with Oblonsky's shirt, which he puts over his master's head like a horse's collar. \nINT. \"DAY NURSERY,\" OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nThere is a sloping lineup of five children, aged eight, five, four, three and two, dressed and brushed for presentation to their mother, Princess Daria Oblonsky, known as Dolly . . . who we now see is heavily pregnant. Stand- ing by is a French governess, Mlle. Roland, and a Nurse. Mlle. Roland is buxom. \nDolly picks up the youngest, Vasya, to kiss him and hands him to the Nurse, and kisses the others in ascending order. \nDOLLY Bonjour, Lili; bonjour, Masha; bonjour, Grisha; bonjour, Tanya. \nWho's coming to see Grandmama? \nINT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, SAME TIME-- DAY \nOblonsky, dressed now and holding a cup of coffee, checks from the window. \nOBLONSKY'S POV-- \nINT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--DAY \nOblonsky has been bunking down on his couch. He moans and groans. He gets up and tries the door to the bedroom. It's locked. He knocks timidly. \nOBLONSKY (PITEOUSLY) Dolly . . . please think of the children . . . \nHe listens hopefully. The other door, leading to the upper landing, is opened violently by Dolly. \nDOLLY You think of the children! Their lives are ruined now! \nShe slams the door behind her. \nINT. BEDROOM LEVEL, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nOblonsky comes out of his dressing room to see the main bedroom door slammed. He attempts to go in but the door is locked. \nOBLONSKY Oh, Dolly . . . I beg you . . . \nMatvey come to the top of the stairs with a telegram. \nMATVEY Telegram. Should I send up the barber? \nOBLONSKY No, just the razor. \nOblonsky tears open the telegram. \nMATVEY Don't worry, sir, things will shape them- selves, you'll see. \nOBLONSKY (RELIEVED) My sister Anna's coming tomorrow. We're saved. \nINT. OBLONSKY'S OFFICE, MOSCOW--DAY \nInner doors open and Oblonsky comes out of his private office. He is his genial self. Everyone in the general office-- minor officials, clerks-- stands up for him and bows. Oblonsky is wearing government uniform--green coat with gold embroidery on the collar--instead of his own coat. Oblonsky is helped out of one coat into the other. \nDOORKEEPER Some man came without an appointment, Your Excellency . . . waiting outside. \nOblonsky opens the door to look. Levin is sitting waiting on a bench, wear- ing a sheepskin coat, cap and scuffed boots. \nOBLONSKY Levin! Where did you disappear? \nHe seizes Levin and kisses him. \nLEVIN (NERVOUS) I'm very anxious to see you. I need your advice. \nOBLONSKY Well, then, come into my room. \nOblonsky leads Levin back through the general office, where everyone stands up again. Levin's sheepskin and boots attract curious glances. \nOBLONSKY (CONT'D) This is my oldest friend, Konstantin Dmit- rich Levin! Someone send word I'll be a few minutes late. \nINT. OBLONSKY'S PRIVATE OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAY \nOblonsky leads Levin inside and closes the door. \nOBLONSKY I've been hard at it. Sit down. \nLevin undoes his coat and sits down. \nLEVIN Hard at what exactly? \nOBLONSKY Why, we're overwhelmed with work! \nLEVIN Oh--paperwork. \nOBLONSKY Paperwork is the soul of Russia. Farming is only the stomach. When am I going to come and shoot some snipe? \nSeeing the clothes Levin is wearing, he laughs. \nOBLONSKY (CONT'D) Oh, but look at you, in Western clothes you told me you'd never wear again. Some- thing's up. \nLEVIN Yes. I'm in love. I've come back to propose. Have you guessed who she is? \nOBLONSKY (rolls his eyes comically) I have a suspicion. Why didn't you propose when you were here? \nLEVIN I decided it was impossible. Kitty is of the heavens, an angel, and I am of the earth-- but then I thought and thought, and . . . there's no life for me without her! . . . Do I have a chance? \nOBLONSKY Of course you do. The Shcherbatskys are giving a soiree this evening. Get there early before the crowd. If I may suggest . . . \nLEVIN Anything! What? \nOBLONSKY New boots. \nLEVIN Right. Anything else? \nOBLONSKY (HESITATES) We'd better have dinner together. \nCome on, we'll meet later at l'Angleterre. Or do you prefer the Hermitage? \nOblonsky ushers Levin back into the general office. \nINT. GENERAL OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAY \n. . . Everyone stands up as before. The Doorkeeper produces Oblonsky's top- coat and helps him into it. \nOBLONSKY No--five-thirty at l'Angleterre--I owe them more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be fair to withdraw my custom. (taking his hat) Boots, and a coat. And a proper hat. \nHe ushers Levin out. \nEXT. L'ANGLETERRE RESTAURANT, MOSCOW--DAY \nFirstly, a Moscow street scene, busy with people going about their business, on foot and in conveyances. \nAnna, found out, smiles tentatively. \nANNA Was it love? \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY Always. My sons are ashamed of me. But I'd rather end up wishing I hadn't than end up wishing I had--wouldn't you? \nANNA I . . . I don't know . . . \nAnna looks at the snow on the window. She is unsettled by the conversation. \nEXT. SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE. MOSCOW--NIGHT \nA sleigh (i.e., a cab) brings Levin. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nThe Hall Porter lets Levin into the house. A Footman takes Levin's hat and coat. Levin is uneasy--he seems to be first to arrive. He decides he has come too early. He pulls his coat back from the Footman. \nLEVIN I'll come back. \nUP ABOVE \nPrincess Ekaterina (Kitty) Shcherbatsky is eighteen. Eager to see who has arrived, she hurries from the direction of the reception room and looks down into the entrance hall in time to see Levin snatch his hat back from the Footman. \nKITTY Konstantin! \nLEVIN I'm too early. \nKITTY (PLEASED) No! Come up! \nDOWN BELOW \nKitty runs off out of Levin's view. He flings his hat and coat at the Foot- man and runs up the stairs. \nINT. RECEPTION ROOM, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nLevin hurries in and finds Kitty seated prettily in a \"receiving\" pose. She is alone. \nKITTY Look at me! I'm receiving for Papa and Maman who are late to dress. It's my first reception. \nLevin plays along, kissing her hand elaborately. \nLEVIN Princess Ekaterina! Delighted, delighted! \nKITTY ( FORMAL) I'm so pleased you were able to be with us, Konstantin Dmitrich! \nLEVIN (DROPPING IT) Kitty . . . you look . . . you look-- \nKITTY Stiva told us you were back. How long are you staying? \nLEVIN I don't know. It depends on you. \nKITTY On me? \nHe has got ahead of himself. Doors are flung open and the hosts, Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky, and a crowd of guests who have arrived together, are greeting each other. Levin has to make a quick decision, and he makes the wrong one--to go on. \nLEVIN What I mean to say--I came with only one purpose--I want to--will you be my wife? \nKitty panics. A wave of Guests is almost upon her. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) I'm sorry--sorry--wrong moment--but will you? \nKITTY I can't. I'm sorry. \nKitty flees. Levin seems stunned, surrounded now by greetings, laughter, and servants with trays of drinks. \nLEVIN Yes. It was impossible. \nPrince and Princess Shcherbatsky receive a young married member of Kitty's set, Countess Nordston . . . and introduce Levin, who hears and sees noth- ing. He turns away, leaving the Countess hung out to dry. \nLevin finds himself face to face with Burisov, a silky Officer in sky blue uniform, who introduces himself. \nBURISOV Burisov. Are you the brother of Nikolai Levin? \nLEVIN Yes. \nBURISOV He's in Moscow, he's staying at the Unicorn in Khitrovka. \nLEVIN How do you know? \nBURISOV (SMILES) It's the sort of thing I know. \nHe bows to Levin and turns away to greet someone. \nLevin reacts, decides to leave. He makes for the door. He nearly collides with someone, gives and receives an apology, and suddenly understands who this man in Guards uniform must be. Levin turns. \nLEVIN Count Vronsky? \nVRONSKY Yes. \nLevin pauses awkwardly. Vronsky hesitates, bows and continues on. Levin witnesses Kitty seeing Vronsky approaching, and sees her face light up. Vronsky kisses her hand. \nVRONSKY (CONT'D) (BANTERING) Princess Kitty . . . It's been so long, and yet it seems like yesterday. \nHis banter is lost on her. She laughs happily. \nKITTY It was yesterday! \nLevin turns away and leaves. \nEXT. SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE--NIGHT \nVRONSKY Hello, what's this? \nGUARDS OFFICER Austrian royalty on their honeymoon. I've got them for four days. \nVRONSKY Bad luck. What do they like? Art? \nGUARDS OFFICER Food. \nVRONSKY Here's the train. \nEXT. PLATFORM, THE ARRIVING TRAIN, SAME TIME--DAY \nVronsky moves closer to the slowing train, scanning the windows going by. \nEXT. PLATFORM ENTRANCE GATE, SAME TIME--DAY \nThe Guards Officer and the Stationmaster are disconcerted to see the obvious \"private coach\" stop seriously short (or long) behind luggage wagons, etc. \nSTATIONMASTER I'll see to it. \nHe hurries away towards the engine. \nOblonsky hurries through, relieved not to be late. \nEXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY \nVronsky is saluted by his mother's Major Domo, a tall man in livery with a cockade. \nMAJOR DOMO Second carriage, Your Excellency. I'll see to the Countess's luggage and bring it on to the house. \nVronsky nods, and makes his way towards the second coach, against the flow of disembarked passengers. \nEXT. TRAIN (ENGINE), SAME TIME \nThe Stationmaster speaks to the Engine Driver. \nEXT. EXIT/ENTRANCE GATE, SAME TIME--DAY \nThe Guards Officer with the bouquet stands uncertainly while arriving passengers go past him. \nEXT. \"PRIVATE COACH,\" SAME TIME--DAY \nThe Royal Austrian Honeymooners peer anxiously through the window. \nINT. TRAIN, SAME TIME-- DAY \nCountess Vronsky remains sitting. Annushka packs away Anna's blanket and pillow. Anna looks out of the window. \nANNA I'll come back. \nAnna moves to the door opening on to the \"porch.\" Vronsky is on the point of entering. He steps back to allow her by. They barely exchange a glance as she passes him, but, simultaneously, each of them looks back. Anna looks away quickly. His look lingers before he turns away to enter the carriage. \nINT./EXT. PORCH--DAY \nAnna, from her vantage point spots Oblonsky, calls to him. Annushka, with her bag, comes onto the porch and descends to follow her mistress. \nEXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY \nAnna steps down to the platform and embraces Oblonsky. They are delighted to see each other. \nANNA (ACCUSINGLY) You don't look ashamed. \nOBLONSKY (CONTRITE) I am, I really am. \nINT. TRAIN, SAME TIME-- DAY \nCountess Vronsky remains in her seat. Vronsky bends at the window, look- ing at Oblonsky and Anna. \nVRONSKY Yes, of course. Oblonsky's sister . . . Karenina. \nCOUNTESS Charmante, don't you think? (to her Maid) Wait for me in the carriage. I'll take Tosca. \nShe takes the dog. The Maid leaves with her bag. \nVRONSKY . . . You stayed longer in St. Petersburg. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY Long enough for you to start a little love affair, I hear. \nVRONSKY I can't think what you're referring to, Maman. \nHe glances back to the window, where Anna turns back to enter the train. \nEXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY \nAs Anna turns back, a Railwayman with a hammer for tapping wheels is in her way. He steps back for her with a bow and a \"Madame!\" Anna glances at him and moves past him. The man taps a wheel, making a ring- ing sound which means the wheel is okay. \nAs Anna mounts the steps, a Train Guard looks up and down the plat- form, holding a green flag. \nINT. TRAIN, SAME TIME-- DAY \nAnna enters from the porch. \nANNA There, Countess, you have found your son and I have found my brother. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY Madame Karenin has a son, too. It's the first time they have been apart, so she frets about him. \nVRONSKY Excuse me for not recognizing you before. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY We passed the time telling each other about our sons. \nANNA Yes, I've been hearing all about you. \nINT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--DAY \nAnna, Kitty, Tanya and Grisha are at a handsome card table where board games, dominoes, cards, etc., are kept. There is a spill of alphabet bricks, each with a letter printed in it. They are spelling out their names in alphabet bricks. Grisha is on Anna's lap pulling at her hair. The spelling business, including misspellings by Grisha, creates a noise of laughter and mock-rebuke. Tanya at the same time is trying to pull a ring from Anna's finger. \nKitty is not at all frightened of Anna now; enraptured by her, laughing. \nANNA Grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it all in a tangle--and look for another G for GRIGORI-- (She takes off her ring for Tanya) --here, darling, you can wear it till you go TO BED-- \nDolly sits apart, embroidering. She looks up at the sound of voices down- stairs, Oblonsky coming home. The children hear their father and abandon the card table, running out to greet him. Dolly stands up to leave by a dif- ferent door, giving Anna a collusive glance. \nAnna pushes aside the alphabet bricks. \nANNA (CONT'D) Well, that's the end of that. \nKITTY Will you stay for the Bobrishchev's ball, Anna? \nANNA Oh . . . I always feel dull at a ball. \nKITTY How can you ever be dull? \nOblonsky arrives in the doorway with Tanya and Grisha hanging on him. \nKITTY (CONT'D) Stiva! Tell Anna she must come to the ball. \nOBLONSKY Of course she must. \nHe cocks an eye at Anna: how did it go with Dolly? Anna moves her head: upstairs. \nANNA . . . and God go with you. \nKitty catches the moment. \nOBLONSKY (LEAVING) You can introduce me to your new governess. \nTANYA She's old! She's a hundred! \nWhich leaves Anna and Kitty alone. \nANNA I know why you want me to come. You want everyone to be there because you're sure it's going to be your night. \nKITTY How did you know? \nAnna's smile is her acting out a mock-mysteriousness. \nANNA I know everything. \nShe has moved alphabet letters around to spell out VRONSKY. She laughs at Kitty's tearful, joyful nodding, genuinely happy for Kitty. \nANNA (CONT'D) Oh, to be your age again . . . surrounded by that blue mist, like mist on the mountains \nthat clears slowly to reveal the terrifying, beautiful valley you must enter to become grown-up . . . I was eighteen too, when I got married . . . \nA quiet note of regret hangs in the air between them for a moment before Anna dispels it. \nINT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--NIGHT \nWith only a lamp or two lit, and the door open, Anna sits alone at the card table, with a neglected book, one hand playing idly with the alpha- bet bricks. Their pleasant clicks are the only sound as she remains lost in thought. She closes her book, marking the place. She is going to go up to bed. She hears the sound of the doorbell. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nVronsky has been let in spattered with snow. \nSERVANT . . . no, Your Excellency . . . He's just gone up. . . . The Princess retired early . . . Is there a message? \nVronsky glances up and sees Anna looking down. Their eyes meet. A second passes. Vronsky is about to speak. Anna turns away and moves out of his view, towards further stairs, with her book. \nVRONSKY No. \nEXT. NEAR POKROVSKOE--DAY \nLevin is coming home in a sleigh, driven by his one-eyed coachman, Ignat. He is huddled under a bearskin blanket. The house is in sight. \nThe sleigh overtakes a Peasant Woman, Serafina, walking to the house car- rying a big bundle of willow wands strapped to her back: a strong young woman with a handsome face. She stops and bows her head. Levin looks at her. She then looks him in the face. \nLaska, barking joyfully, races from the house. \nINT. BATHHOUSE, POKROVSKOE-- DAY \nThe bathhouse has a stove which heats water. There is a brazier to create instant steam, but not now. Levin, almost naked, lies on a plank deck, thoughtful, staring at something . . . no, at someone: Serafina, who is put- ting on her clothes. Postcoitum. She has no angst. Dressed, she crosses herself. \nLEVIN Will you go to confession? \nSerafina nods indifferently. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) God will forgive you. \nSERAFINA And you also, master. He is watching. \nLEVIN God forgive us then, for committing the act of love. \nShe nods without irony. \nSERAFINA He is merciful. \nLEVIN \"Not according to my deserts, O Lord, but according to thy mercy\"--that's a fine prayer. But I'm full of doubt. Sometimes I even doubt that God exists. \nSERAFINA How can there be anything if God didn't make it? \nLEVIN I don't know. One day science will tell us. \nSERAFINA That's sinful talk if the priest heard you. \nKitty looks for Vronsky, can't see him, then is taken aback to see him with Anna. Kitty watches Anna dancing. Anna says something which makes Vronsky laugh. Anna laughs. Anna blossoms in front of Kitty's eyes. Vron- sky twirls Anna around and she comes smiling into his arms. \nIt goes on like that. Kitty watches them from within the arms of young men, old men, from the wall. Anna and Vronsky dance slow, they dance fast, gaily, solemnly, gazes locked. \nOthers are noticing too: Countess Nordston, Princess Shcherbatsky, and eagle-eyed matrons. Anna, oblivious, has found a release in herself. \nCountess Nordston finds Kitty sitting alone. Korsunsky announces the Mazurka. \nCOUNTESS NORDSTON You're not dancing the mazurka? I won't have it. \nShe pulls Kitty to her feet. \ncountess nordston (cont'd) I'm engaged by General Glub--I give him to you. \nTHE MAZURKA . . . \nKorsunsky supervises a large circle of couples who change partners as they go round, with one couple dancing in the middle of the circle. \nKORSUNSKY . . . the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman . . . ! \nThe lady in the middle beckons to Anna and the man who, changing part- ners, happens to be dancing with her. They enter the middle where they have their solo turn as a couple, while the original couple reenter the circum- ference. Anna is flushed with pleasure. Among the surrounding dancers, Vronsky has no eyes for his partner, only for Anna. Kitty, dancing, watches Vronsky incredulous. \nKORSUNSKY (CONT'D) (ADDRESSING ANNA) . . . and the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman . . . ! \nAnna looks smilingly around the dancing circle and sees Kitty staring at her. Anna \"wakes up.\" Everything which made her drunk makes her sober in the instant. She waits until the change of partners brings Kitty and Vronsky together. She beckons them into the middle. Her own partner expects to re-join the circumference with Anna, but she makes an apology and escapes through the circle, running towards the door. \nWith a howl and clatter, the St. Petersburg express seems to crash through the ballroom. \nMONTAGE \nAn abstract, nightmarish, discordant noise of clattering and howling accompanies unexplained flame--light on wood, glass, iron . . . blackness opens like a door on a blizzard of light, and slams shut. \nAnna's face, eyes closed, floats ghostlike. \nINT. TRAIN, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nAnna comes to consciousness in the dimly lit carriage, making sense of what seems like a hallucination. Wind and snow batter on the window. The Carriage Stoker, in long coat and cap, deals with the stove, clears frost off a thermometer on the wall. He leaves, opening the door to snow and wind and slamming it behind him. \nEXT. RUSSIA--NIGHT \nThe train \"speeds\" (35 m.p.h.) through a blizzard. \nINT. THE TRAIN \nAnna has a reading lamp hooked over her armrest, and a novel. She cuts a page with a paper-knife. But the book cannot hold her. She is reading without taking it in. She turns back a page and tries again, but almost at once she turns to the window where the dark reflection of her face looks back at her. Kitty's face staring as she stared at Anna, betrayed. \nAnna turns away from the window. The Guard comes through the door, letting in wind and snow, and shuts it. He walks through the carriage. \nGUARD Bologoye! Fifteen minutes. \nThe train is slowing. \nEXT. BOLOGOYE--NIGHT \nThe train clanks to a halt at a small station. Anna (and a few others) get down from the train. She wears a heavy cloak. The wind blows a few snowflakes through the station but the roof keeps off the snow. She is glad of the fresh air. Here and there, men are walking, smoking, laughing together. She feels better. \nA tall outline of a man in a greatcoat and military cap emerges from the flickering gloom. She catches her breath. He salutes her. \nVRONSKY Can I be of service to you? \nANNA I didn't know you were . . . Why are you leaving? \nVRONSKY You know why. I have to be where you are. I can't not. \nANNA This is wrong. If you're a good man, forget everything that happened, as I will. \nVRONSKY I'll never forget a single thing about you, not a word, not a gesture-- \nANNA That's enough! \nShe climbs the steps on to the porch. At the door to the carriage she pauses. The encounter has left her feeling elated and frightened. \nEXT. STATION, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY \nThe train arrives. Vronsky gets down from the train and starts to walk towards Anna's carriage. His German valet, Franz, runs up to him (from second class). \nVRONSKY Take the luggage home. \nFranz runs back the other way. Vronsky walks on, then stops when he sees Karenin waiting on the platform, smiling and going forward to hand Anna down the steps. Kapitonich enters the carriage. Vronsky hesitates. \nANNA (ANXIOUS) Is Serozha all right? \nKARENIN Oh, is that all I get? Yes, he's quite well. \nVronsky steps forward. Anna knows he's there. She angles herself to avoid looking at him. \nVRONSKY Did you have a good night? \nHe bows to Karenin. \nANNA Yes, quite comfortable. Count Vronsky. \nKarenin extends a hand indifferently then dismisses Vronsky, drawing Anna with him. \nKARENIN I have to get back to the Committee . . . \nHe walks Anna away. \nKARENIN (CONT'D) Well--were you a success? \nANNA I? Oh--Dolly and Stiva . . . yes, I think so . . . \nREVERSE \nHer self-possessed face, lit by fireworks, falls apart in misery. \nThe firework display continues for a short minute and is applauded. Betsy acknowledges the congratulations and sycophancy which are her due. Foot- men come through the room with trays of ices. \nAnna is still at the window, unaware that there is only darkness outside. In the room, Betsy notes the oddity: Anna alone with her back to the room. \nREVERSE ON ANNA \nAnna opens her eyes. She is lost for a moment, perplexed. \nvronsky (O.C.) May I have the honour of bringing you an ice? \nAnna turns, understanding nothing. \nVRONSKY (CONT'D) Ices are being served. \nANNA I would prefer to try a cigarette. \nShe sits down. Vronsky takes out a cigarette case. He lights her cigarette. She tries it and coughs. \nVRONSKY (IN FRENCH) Courage! \nAnna smiles. Puffs delicately once. \nANNA Thank you. \nShe gives the cigarette to him. \nANNA (CONT'D) I'll try another one sometime. \nVRONSKY When? \nShe looks at him in surprise. He dunks the cigarette in an abandoned dish of ice cream. \nVRONSKY (CONT'D) Where? \nANNA Just as I was thinking your manners have improved since Moscow. You behaved badly, very badly. \nVRONSKY And who was responsible for that? \nAnna gets up and walks over to Betsy's chair. \nANNA Give me a cup of tea. \nBetsy obediently gets up to fill a cup from the samovar. Vronsky follows Anna. This is watched by more than one guest. Betsy hands the cup to Anna. \nBETSY How nice--Alexei Aleksandrevich has arrived. \nKarenin enters smiling. Lisa Merkalova and Anna's Friend share a delicious-malicious moment. \nLISA MERKALOVA I'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment. \nAs Betsy and Karenin move smilingly to greet each other, Karenin's radar picks up the two women's intimate laughter. \nKarenin remains at apparent ease, as though unaware of people's glances at Vronsky and Anna, and he kisses Betsy's hand. Princess Myagkaya has meanwhile gone over to Anna. Anna likes her and is glad of the diversion. \nPRINCESS MYAGKAYA So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner. The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou- bles, and it was ghastly. We had to ask them back. I gave them a sauce that cost eighty- five kopeks and it was a triumph. \nAnna and Vronsky laugh. Princess Myagkaya moves on. \nVRONSKY Were you glad to see me or not? \nANNA This must stop. You make me feel as if I were guilty of something. \nVRONSKY What do you want me to do? \nANNA I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you. \nVRONSKY No, that's not what you want. Moscow? I can do better than that. Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent. I can change my mind, and you'll never see me again. \nANNA If you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace. \nVRONSKY I have no peace to give. There can be no peace for us--only misery or the greatest happiness. You are my whole life now. \nShe looks at him and nods slowly, as if in thought. \nBetsy diplomatically leads Karenin to Anna. \nBETSY Your husband is impossible!-- his opinions are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he wins every argument. \nAnna looks up at her, hearing nothing. \nANNA What? \nShe notices Karenin, who kisses her hand. Vronsky acknowledges Karenin. \nKARENIN I called to take you home. \nANNA No, I'm staying. Send the carriage back for me. \nKARENIN Of course. \nHe bows to Betsy. Ignoring Vronsky, he turns away. \nLATER \nVronsky is with one group of guests, Anna with another. She is animated, excited, at a small table, involved in a game of cards-- which she wins, to local applause. She speaks a \"must go\" to Betsy, and swiftly goes to the door. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, TVERSKOY HOUSE--NIGHT \nVronsky opens his door to Anna. They don't speak. He takes her hand and brings her in. \nSEX AS BEFORE \nINT. VRONSKY'S APARTMENT, SAME TIME--DAY \nVronsky leads Anna through the apartment to the bedroom. \nSEX AS BEFORE \nINT. VRONSKY'S BEDROOM, SAME TIME--DAY \nVronsky takes off Anna's outer clothes, slowly and carefully, starting with her hat and veil. \nSEX AS BEFORE \nINT. VRONSKY'S BEDROOM, SAME TIME--DAY \nAnna, in underclothes, unbuttons Vronsky's shirt. \nSEX AS BEFORE \nINT. VRONSKY'S BEDROOM, SAME TIME--DAY \nAnna and Vronsky are standing kissing passionately. He has no shirt. \nSEX AS BEFORE \nINT. VRONSKY'S BEDROOM, SAME TIME--DAY \nAnna ends up half off the edge of Vronsky's bed, climaxing upside down and falling to the floor. Vronsky, also half off the bed, looks down at her. He reaches down for her. She grasps hold of his hand, huddled, hugs it to her, distressed to tears. \nANNA Oh God forgive me. It's the end of everything--I've got nothing left now, only you. Remember that. \nVRONSKY Anna . . . Anna . . . how can I not remem- ber? You're my happiness. \nHe draws her back on to the bed, kisses her face, her shoulder . . . \nANNA Happiness! You murdered my happiness. \nShe tries to leave but he attacks her as a lover, and she gives way, responding. \nANNA (CONT'D) Murderer. Murderer. Go on. Go on. Go on. \nShe starts hitting him. \nANNA (CONT'D) Yes. Go on. Go on. Go on. \nEXT. SPRING MELT (POKROVSKOE)--DAY \nIn sunshine, a large chunk of ice loses its purchase on winter and goes floating along a stream of tiny ice floes between grassy banks almost free of snow, with early aconites showing. \nEXT. POKROVSKOE--DAY \nThe icy stream flows under a footbridge which has a broken handrail. Vasili, the steward, is on the bridge with a Carpenter. Levin, on horseback, is displeased. \nLEVIN I thought that had been done. \nVASILI I gave the order. What can you do with these people? \nLevin rides on, into an expanded prospect of fields and woods, snow on the ground. \nLATER \nWhen Levin gets in view of the house, he is puzzled by the distant sight of a three-horse sledge arriving. \nINT. DINING ROOM, POKROVSKOE--DAY \nThe new arrival is Oblonsky, enjoying his food. \nOBLONSKY Ah--potage aux choux a la Russe! \nAgafia comes in with the roast fowl. \nOBLONSKY (CONT'D) Agafia!--if you opened up in Moscow, l'Angleterre would go out of business. \nDo you want news of Moscow? \nLEVIN Of Babylon? No. \nOBLONSKY You're right, what do you care? You love the country--you've got it. You love agricultur- ing, and, Lord knows, you've got it. You love shooting--you've got it. You've got every- thing you want! \nAgafia, leaving, throws Levin a look (no wife). \nLEVIN All right, go on, then. Have you stopped stealing bread rolls? \nOBLONSKY Ballet girl, oriental type. How can I help it? \nLEVIN So, nothing new to tell me. How is--how are the Shcherbatskys? \nOBLONSKY You mean Kitty. \nLEVIN I . . . Is she engaged now? \nOBLONSKY No. Vronsky went back to St. Petersburg. \nHe waits for this to sink in. \nOBLONSKY (CONT'D) Kitty will be at Ergoshovo visiting Dolly in the summer. You could . . . \nLEVIN Oh yes, as if I had time in the summer! And I've got extra land this year at Kashin for the haymaking. \nANNA And you love me? \nVRONSKY Yes. \nANNA How much? \nVRONSKY This much. \nAnna drags the front of her skirts out of her way. \nANNA This much? \nVRONSKY Yes. \nANNA This much? \nVRONSKY Yes. \nANNA This much? \nVRONSKY Yes. \nANNA This much? And this much? And this much? \nVRONSKY Yes. \nANNA ( FIERCELY) And . . . this . . . much . . . ? \nShe falls on him. He strokes her hair. \nHer hand comes into view, the index finger bloody. She carefully paints his lips with it. She kisses his lips clean, and rolls off him onto her back. \nANNA (CONT'D) So this is love. This. \nINT. KARENIN'S STUDY, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY \nSUMMER \nKorney brings Countess Lydia. Karenin comes from behind his desk to invite her to a chair. \nKARENIN Countess . . . I thought you would be at Peterhof now. \nLYDIA I've come from there. I'm distressed that you haven't taken your usual house this year. \nKARENIN Anna wanted a change. She is spending the summer at Tsarskoe. \nLYDIA Near Princess Betsy. And . . . \nKarenin waits. \nLYDIA (CONT'D) The Guards are in summer camp at Tsarskoe. \nKarenin waits. \nLYDIA (CONT'D) Alexei Alexandrovich, forgive me but you are too tolerant! Your wife . . . \nKarenin affects surprise. \nKARENIN Oh, is this about my wife? \nHe smiles at her. \nKARENIN (CONT'D) My wife is beyond reproach. She is, after all, my wife. \nCountess Lydia gets the message. She rises to go. Karenin kisses her hand and accompanies her to the door. She leaves him, and his social mask gives way to his disturbance. \nINT. DEMIN'S HOUSE, TSARSKOE--NIGHT \nThe Commanding Officer is throwing a party for his officers: serious drink- ing, Soldier Servants, a crowded table on the large verandah, Soldier Sing- ers in white linen tunics performing operetta and folk songs. Vronsky, in party spirit, is with Petritsky and another friend, Yashvin, singing along. \nAn officer we don't know is, surprisingly, hailed as \"Vronsky!\"--he's Vronsky's elder brother, Alexander. He gestures \"Later!\" and goes to Vron- sky. The brothers embrace. \nALEXANDER Alyosha . . . a message from Maman. Her friend Princess Sorokina has a house here, and a virgin daughter, that's not part of the \nmessage, but they'll all be at the races and you're expected to supper afterwards. \nThe song ends and Demin, half drunk, climbs on the table, shouts for silence and a toast. \nDEMIN Gentlemen--I give you--the regiment! \nGeneral uproar. \"The regiment.\" \nEXT. DEMIN'S GARDEN, TSARSKOE--NIGHT \nOn a garden bench where the noise of the party is quieter, Vronsky and Alexander talk. \nALEXANDER I heard you turned down a promotion. \nVRONSKY That was Maman interfering. \nALEXANDER Yes. And now she's come up with a princess for you. (SERIOUSLY) Alexei--we're brothers, so don't take offence. Getting married puts the pack on your back--it leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder. Getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms. \nVRONSKY So they talk about me. I'm leaving, Sasha. \nALEXANDER An assignation? \nVRONSKY Come on, I'll introduce you. \nEXT. STABLES, TSARSKOE--NIGHT \nVronsky with Alexander beside him clucks his tongue at the black opening of a stable and calls softly for Frou-Frou. There's a stir within and the mare's head appears. Vronsky opens the door. \nEXT. THE LADIES' STAND, THE RACES, SAME TIME-- DAY \nAnna and Betsy are here, and, not far away, so are Countess Vronsky and the Princesses Sorokina: the mother is a fading fortyish; the daughter is eighteen, blonde and pretty. \nBelow the ladies section is a planked standing area for gentlemen, who also may stand to watch the races from the stepped aisle of the seated section. Soldiers, Horse People and Locals watch from the turf. \nA race is flowing towards the winning post, with accompanying crowd reac- tion, but it is clear from Anna's detachment, exchanging chat with Betsy, that this is not Vronsky's race. \nKARENIN \n--looks up to the ladies' stand. Betsy smiles at him in greeting, but Anna seems unaware. \nCountess Vronsky appraises the young princess. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY Exquisite creature . . . you really ought to be the spoil of victory today . . . \nThe young princess smiles at her. Countess Vronsky turns her glasses towards the Starting Post. \nEXT. NEAR THE STARTING POST, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAY \n. . . Vronsky mounts Frou-Frou. The Riders move to the starting line. \nKARENIN \n. . . watches Anna who is looking through her glasses towards the Starting Post while the current race finishes to cheers. \nKARENIN, SMILING AROUND, WATCHES AS:-- \nAnna's anxious attention turns to a horse and rider who fell further down the course-- and to the ambulance wagon (with a red cross sewn on it) . . . \nKarenin mounts the steps of the aisle, raising his hat to ladies he knows. Anna ignores him. \nOn the wooden boards below, where gentlemen are watching, Oblonsky calls up to Betsy. \nOBLONSKY Princess! A bet! What do you fancy in the next? \nBETSY Kusolev. \nOBLONSKY I'm on Vronsky. A pair of gloves? \nBETSY Done! (TO ANNA) Alexander Vronsky . . . \nIn the aisle at the top of the stand, Karenin watches as:-- \nVronsky's brother Alexander, escorting his wife, Varya, bows to Anna and Betsy, but significantly Varya succeeds in not noticing them. \nEXT. STARTING POST, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAY \nThe riders line up . . . and they're off. \nVRONSKY'S POV \nThe stands and spectators are distant, the first fence coming at him, horses on either side. His neighbour falls at the fence but Frou-Frou is clear, with Gladiator half a length in front. The next fence is coming up. Gladiator and Frou-Frou jump cleanly but a following horse falls badly. \nEXT. LADIES' STAND, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAY \nSpectators on either side of Anna and those behind and in front collectively react. \nKARENIN SEES THAT: \nAnna reacts not at all. Her gaze through her glasses stays unwavering on Vronsky. Karenin notes this, and from then on his attention is fixed on Anna. When the horses come opposite the stand, she lowers her glasses and follows Frou-Frou taking the lead from Gladiator. \nVRONSKY \n-- eases Frou-Frou past Gladiator. The horses take the next jump. \nLADIES' STAND \nWith one hand Anna grips her folded fan. \nKarenin's face is a mask as he watches Anna unconsciously half-destroying it. She raises her glasses. \nANNA'S POV THROUGH GLASSES \nFrou-Frou approaches the last fence with Gladiator half a length behind, on the near side to Anna. \nVRONSKY \n-- working the reins, rising and falling in rhythm with the horse, looks ahead to the winning post, and before knowing it he makes an error, losing the rhythm, dropping back into the saddle and raising the horse's head, just as Frou-Frou takes off. \nANNA'S POV (THROUGH GLASSES) \nFrou-Frou rises, Gladiator rises. Frou-Frou disappears. Gladiator clears the fence in Anna's foreground. Simultaneously, there are shrieks and exclamations all around her-- OFF CAMERA-- and the view through the glasses zigzags in search of Frou-Frou, impeded by horses jumping the fence. \nShe lowers the glasses and sees Frou-Frou on the ground, rolling over, and Vronsky on the ground. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY \n-- sees this, too, her mouth set tight with contempt. \nKARENIN \n--looks shocked. Almost in the same moment he hears Anna's anguished cry, conspicuous in the hubbub that follows the crowd's exclamation. \nANNA Alexei . . . ! \nKARENIN I'm here. \nThis is adroit. He comes down several steps and pushes through to offer his arm, but Anna has lost control, trying to escape like a bird beating against its cage. \nKARENIN (CONT'D) Would you like to leave? \nVRONSKY What's happened? \nANNA I told him I'm your mistress. \nVronsky lifts her face, strokes her cheek. He waits. \nANNA (CONT'D) He thinks I can give you up and go on living. \nHe embraces her for that, relieved, grateful, loving--understanding that she is not going to give him up. \nVRONSKY No, you cannot. \nINT. (ST. PETERSBURG)--NIGHT \nImperial hands (the Tsar's for all we know) place over Karenin's head a broad red ribbon from which hangs a heavy medal. Karenin bows low. \nINT. IMPERIAL SALON, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT \nAt an ornate doorway a Major-Domo announces. \nMAJOR DOMO Their Excellencies Minister Karenin and Madame Karenin! \nKarenin, wearing his medal, and Anna smile their way into a party, to a patter of polite applause. Further grandees are being announced, but are not applauded . . . Prince and Princess Berghatskoy . . . Ambassador Chamber- lain . . . Baron and Baroness Verdlov . . . Prince and Princess Tverskoy . . . \nBETSY Alexei Aleksandrevich . . . congratulations. You're the only man my husband would do this for. \nANNA (To Prince Tverskoy) Tell me your latest find for your library. \nPRINCE TVERSKOY Not in front of the Princess. \nBetsy draws Anna away for a moment. \nBETSY I can tell you're happy. You've put on a little weight. \nANNA Both true. \nINT. SEROZHA'S BEDROOM, KARENIN'S HOUSE-- NIGHT \nAnna, in the same dress, kisses Serozha tenderly so as not to wake him, and leaves the room. \nINT. BEDROOM LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nAnna enters the suite where Karenin, in his dressing gown, puts down his book. He is elated by his evening. \nKARENIN Time for bed! \nINT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG-- NIGHT \nAnna is in bed. Karenin is getting ready for bed. Anna listens apprehen- sively to the little noises of Karenin's pre-coital preparations. \nKARENIN . . . not that I care for decorations but . . . \nANNA Alexei . . . I can't . . . I'm sorry . . . But I'm his wife now. (she turns to him) I am having his child. \nKarenin stares at her. He turns back to the open drawer and puts things back the way they were. He locks the drawer. He puts on his dressing gown and leaves the room. Anna waits a moment and follows him. \nINT. SITTING ROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- NIGHT \nIt's dark. Anna hears the crack of his knuckles and can see him faintly, sitting in the dark. \nKARENIN Tell me what I did to deserve this. \nEXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--DAY \nA prospect: next to a country road, a large expanse of meadow is being mown forty swathes at a time by forty mowers swinging their scythes almost in unison. \nCLOSER--Levin is suffering but keeping up, bathed in perspiration. His place is behind an old man, Theodore, who is scything as if without effort. Just in time for Levin, Theodore calls a halt and takes Levin's scythe to sharpen it with a whetstone. Levin attracts a few grins and comments. \nYOUNG PEASANT Konstantin Dmitrich, you'll know your rows when the field's all done! \nLevin's row has stalks of differing heights between the even swathes on either side. There is some laughter, but the men are uneasy. \nEXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)-- SUNDOWN \nIt's time to stop for the day. More tomorrow. The Mowers with their scythes walk back across the large meadow of cut swathes. From the other direc- tion, a crowd of Village Women are coming to meet them carrying food and drink. \nEXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--DUSK \nA fire has been lit. The Mowers eat their meal in the company of women. Serafina tends to a cooking pot in the firelight. Levin watches her discreetly. He has settled down at a discreet distance from the men. His attention is caught by a grown-up Boy and his young Wife who have chosen to sit slightly apart. He is charmed by them, watching the girl serve her husband. \nTheodore comes to Levin with a jug. Levin takes a swig. \nLEVIN How many mowers is it, Theodore? \nTHEODORE Forty-two, master. In your father's time it was work for two days for thirty men . . . (SLYLY) . . . though he never picked up a scythe himself. \nLEVIN The men don't like me for it. \nTHEODORE They like what they're used to. \nLEVIN It settles me. \nTHEODORE How is that, master? \nLEVIN When I'm mowing, I don't ask myself why I'm here. \nTHEODORE You're here to be master, Konstantin Dmi- trich, to be your father's son, and father to a son who will be master after you, as it has always been by the grace of God. \nLEVIN My father owned you, Theodore. My grand- father owned your father. Owned you like chattels, to be bought and sold. Was that by the grace of God? \nTHEODORE It was. Those were good times when your father had the keeping of us. That's my youngest you were looking at there. His young life is perilous now since the Free- dom came and work must be found. \nANNA Yes, and I'm only going to die having your baby. \nVRONSKY That's all nonsense! \nShe kisses him all over his face. \nANNA Tell me it is, tell me it is. You love me. Only me. \nVRONSKY Your note said your husband would be out. \nANNA He was late. Serves him right. And you. Why do you call him my husband? He isn't my husband--he's a clock, a wooden doll-- \nVRONSKY But it was awkward . . . a matter of your honour. You made an agreement. \nAnna flares up again. \nANNA Do you think of my honour when you're sharing whores with your Hindoo! \nVRONSKY Your demon again! \nANNA I'll be glad to die, before you start to hate me! \nVRONSKY Anna . . . \nAnna gives a gasp. She laughs. \nANNA Put your hand there. There! Did you feel him move! \nINT. COMMITTEE CHAMBER, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT \n\"The Committee\" is in session. Stremov has the floor. He is referring to a map of Russia on an easel, splotched with colours. Karenin is there but not listening, his thoughts far away. \nSTREMOV I must respectfully ask Minister Karenin whether his proposals for the regulation of these colourful Gypsy tribes, of these schol- arly God-fearing Jews, and of--but I'm afraid I have lost the Minister's attention . . . \nAll turn to look at Karenin, who sits staring at nothing, unaware even of the pause. He wakes. For a beat he hardly knows where he is. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE--NIGHT \nKapitonich lets Karenin in. Karenin is brisk. \nKARENIN Who is here? \nKAPITONICH Only Madame, Your Excellency. \nKarenin goes up the staircase. There is an urgency in him, a fury. \nINT. ANNA'S BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nKarenin walks in and goes to her bureau, empties out little drawers and receptacles, looking for the key to the main drawer. Anna comes in from the bedroom, alarmed, in her nightdress. \nANNA I wanted to see him because . . . \nKARENIN I do not wish to be told why a woman wants to see her lover. \nHe pulls furiously at the locked drawer, then looks around for an implement. \nANNA What are you . . . ? \nKARENIN I want his letters. \nKarenin finds an iron bootjack. Anna tries to stop him. He pushes her aside and smashes the wood around the lock, then, struggling against her, he takes from the open drawer a pretty cardboard box, a good guess. He confirms that it contains letters. \nKARENIN (CONT'D) I am going to Moscow tomorrow, and then to the provinces with a commission to investigate conditions among the Jews and Gypsies--whose conditions I infinitely prefer to my own. I will not return to this house until divorce has put you into the street. Meanwhile my son will be sent to live with my eldest sister. \nANNA (WAILS) Alexei . . . please . . . leave me Serozha . . . ! \nKarenin looks at her with contempt. \nKARENIN Do you think I would let you have my son? You are depraved, a woman without honour. I thank God the curse of love is lifted from me. \nHe walks out with the box of letters. \nEXT. STREET, MOSCOW--DAY \nWINTER AGAIN \nOblonsky arrives outside his office building in a cab. He enters. \nINT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING, MOSCOW--DAY \nSaluted by the Hall Porter, Oblonsky mounts a semi-grand staircase and arrives at the entrance to his department. He goes in. \nINT. OUTER ROOM, OBLONSKY'S OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAY \nLevin stands up in his almost new, hardly used coat, top hat and boots. \nOBLONSKY Levin! What . . . ? \nLevin smiles, hopefully, sheepish. \nLEVIN I need your advice . . . \nIt's a reprise. Oblonsky understands. He seizes Levin and kisses him. \nINT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--NIGHT \nA small group. Dolly is playing the piano. Kitty turns the pages for Dolly. The old Prince Shcherbatsky and the Princess are with Countess Nordston and Oblonsky. \nCOUNTESS NORDSTON Well, is he coming? \nKitty, keeping half an eye on the door, sees Levin enter and misses the page- turn. Oblonsky goes to greet Levin. \nLEVIN How can she? I mean, look at me! Suppose she's only marrying me to get married? Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky? \nShe's making a terrible mistake! I'll go to her and tell her she's free, that's what I must do . . . \nMATVEY Your coat, sir. \nLevin snatches the coat and puts it on, and dashes out of the room. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE-- DAY \nLevin, in disarray, is let into the house. The entrance hall is crowded, loud and chaotic with children, maids, governesses and Kitty's mother. Tanya, Masha and Lili are bridesmaids. Grisha is a page. Princess Shcherbatsky, trying to create order among last-minute bouquet distribution, hair- adjustments, shoe-changing, etc., sees Levin and explodes. \nPRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY Konstantin!--what-- ? \nLEVIN I have to talk to Kitty. \nPRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY You're not allowed to see her! \nLevin gallops up the stairs. \nINT. KITTY'S ROOM, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE--DAY \nKitty, dressed for the church, is whispering into the crack of the bedroom door. \nKITTY No. I don't understand at all! What's the matter with you? \nINT. OUTSIDE KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY \nLEVIN You can't love me. Think it over! Let people say what they like! \nKITTY ( FRIGHTENED) Are you mad? Have you changed your mind? \nLEVIN Yes. If you don't love me. \nKITTY But I do love you! \nLevin hesitates, desperate. \nLEVIN Do you? Well, I love you! \nKITTY Oh, Konstantin! \nThey link hands through the opening, each with a hand to kiss. \nOVER-- CHURCH ORGAN MUSIC \nINT. CHURCH--DAY \nA mere fragment of a long and ornate marriage ceremony . . . \nThe grizzled Priest lights two decorated candles, holding them askew in his left hand, and he uses his right hand to touch Levin and, more tenderly, Kitty. He gives the couple the candles, Kitty taking hers in her gloved hand. Levin looks blissfully at Kitty. \nMIX TO \nThe Priest lifts crowns from their heads, and invites them to kiss each other, relieving them of their candles. \nThe Choir bursts with pride. \nINT. NURSERY, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY \nThe baby girl, two months old, is being fed by a Wet Nurse. Replete, the baby is given over to the Nursemaid who lays the child in her crib. \nKarenin watches all this. The women ignore him: they are used to him now, and Karenin is harmless. Karenin stares fascinated at the baby, who stares back. \nINT. BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG-- DAY \nAnna stares at herself in the mirror. The act of raising a pair of scissors is an effort. She isolates a thick lock of her hair, and snips it off. \nINT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY \nAnna's hair is short all over. She sits up in bed, listening to Princess Betsy, who has brought the current gossip. \nBETSY . . . and there was her husband wearing her best ballgown, rouge all over his face . . . ma chere, le scandale! . . . But I'd better tell you some regimental news . . . \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY \nKarenin enters and sees a glamorous Footman standing in the entrance hall, holding a white fur cape. \nKARENIN Who is here? \nFOOTMAN Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya, Your Excellency. \nINT. BEDROOM LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY \nKarenin approaches the bedroom door. \nanna (O.C.) No--I don't want to see him. \nbetsy (O.C.) . . . but your husband surely wouldn't . . . \nINT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nAnna sees Karenin who is about to retreat. \nKARENIN Please excuse me. \nANNA No--stay. \nBETSY I am so glad to see you. Everyone asks after you. \nKarenin bows to her and kisses Anna's hand. \nA respectful cough at the door reveals an obsequious male Shopkeeper. Kar- enin is bewildered. \nKARENIN Madame Odette . . . ? \nSHOPKEEPER Excuse the liberty, Your Excellency . . . it's for a bonnet and some ribbons Her Excel- lency has overlooked. If you wish us to address ourselves to Her Excellency, please be so good as to tell us where we might . . . \nKarenin is stricken into immobility, his face hiding in one propped-up hand. A tear falls on the blotter. Slyudin rescues him, ushering the Shopkeeper out. \nCountess Lydia arrives in full fluttering cry. \nLYDIA I have forced my way in! I have heard! \nKARENIN Countess, every shopkeeper has heard. \nLYDIA My dear friend! Don't give way to sorrow. Our Lord Jesus Christ has you in his care. \nKARENIN No, I'm done for. I don't understand any- thing. All day long I'm being asked to make decisions about bills and servants, the kitchen, Serozha's clothes . . . \nLYDIA I understand. I understand everything. I am going to act. The household arrangements you can leave to me. I will come every day. I will be a second mother to Serozha. \nHe clasps both her hands and kisses them. Lydia falls to her knees. \nLYDIA (CONT'D) He that humbleth himself shall be exalted! You must not thank me. Thank Him whose love pours through me! \nEXT. SNOWY COUNTRYSIDE, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAY \nThe sleigh brings Levin and Kitty home through deep snow all around. The house comes into view. \nSLEIGH \nThey have been on honeymoon travels, attested by hotel labels on the lug- gage. Kitty, eager and anxious, looks at the approaching house. Not too bad. Levin takes her hand. She smiles at him, to calm him. \nEXT. THE HOUSE, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAY \nAgafia and Vasili come out on the porch. The house has been painted, the window frames smartened up, and paper flowers are tied to the posts of the porch. The sleigh pulls up. Levin carries Kitty through the snow to the porch. Agafia bobs. Vasili bows. \nLEVIN This is Agafia, and Vasili, the steward . . . My wife, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Levin. \nKITTY I am very pleased to meet you both. \nKuzma sidles by with a bow and goes to take the luggage from the sleigh. \nLEVIN And that was Kuzma. Come inside! \nVASILI Careful--door's still a bit . . . (to Levin's look) it's all right, it'll be dry tomorrow . . . \nINT. SITTING ROOM, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME-- DAY \nLevin shows Kitty in. He is immensely relieved. It never looked better. At the same time he realises that Agafia is agitated: a word in private. \nLEVIN Is it all right? \nKitty nods, smiles gamely--it's not like home. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) Sit down a minute. \nKITTY No--I want to see everything. \nAgafia panics. \nLEVIN A moment. \nLevin follows Agafia out. \nINT. STAIRS, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAY \nAgafia follows Levin up the stairs. She is outraged. \nAGAFIA . . . and now I'm doing kitchen maid's work because Nadya's parents won't let her set foot in this house, and who can blame them!--it's indecent! \nINT. GUEST BEDROOM, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME-- DAY \nLevin enters the small bedroom. Agafia waits outside. \nNikolai is in the bed-- wasted, near death. He lies in squalor. Masha is wiping his face. She stands up at Levin's approach. Levin bends over Niko- lai, presses his gaunt hand. Nikolai opens his eyes. \nLEVIN It's me, Konstantin. \nNIKOLAI Yes, good. The doctor here is useless--get me a doctor from Moscow. \nLEVIN Where did you go? I asked for you every- where, when I was getting married. \nNikolai sighs and closes his eyes. Levin retreats, looks to Masha. \nMASHA (WHISPERS) I'm sorry . . . I couldn't leave him. I know I've done wrong. \nLEVIN Yes. My wife . . . You can't stay now. \nLevin goes outside to Agafia and closes the door. \nINT. OUTSIDE GUEST BEDROOM, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME-- DAY \nAGAFIA I couldn't go against Nikolai Dmitrich's orders . . . \nLEVIN Yes--yes . . . She's going. \nAn unwelcome thought strikes Levin. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) Did the doctor see her? \nAgafia nods guiltily. \nLYDIA My friend . . . you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die . . . Let me write to her. \nEXT. TOY SHOP, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY \nAnna is looking into the display window of a toy shop. She is excited, glow- ing. She enters the shop. \nINT. VRONSKY'S FLAT, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY \nReturning from the toy shop with a wrapped parcel, Anna comes in. Luggage is stacked up in the hallway and Franz is unpacking stuff in the main room. \nShe sees that a hand-delivered letter is waiting for her. She opens it. Anna reads the letter. For a moment she is devastated by it--but then, furious, she tears it up. \nEXT. KARENIN HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY \nIt's very early morning. The street is not awake. A hired cab brings Anna to her former home. She is heavily veiled, and carries the wrapped parcel from the toy shop. The cab is to wait for her. She rings the doorbell. \nA sleepy Servant opens the big wooden door. \nANNA I'm here to see Sergei Alexeyich. \nThe young Servant doesn't know her. Anna steps past him, pushing money into his hand. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nKapitonich, pulling on his livery greatcoat, comes to the inner glass door and lets Anna in. He does not recognise her. \nANNA I have brought something for Sergei Alexeyich. \nKapitonich scrutinises her, prepared to forestall her. \nKAPITONICH He is not up yet. Would you wish to wait? Who shall I say . . . ? \nKapitonich peers at her and realises who she is. He steps back and bows. \nKAPITONICH (CONT'D) Please come in, Your Excellency. \nAnna goes quickly to the stairs. \nKAPITONICH (CONT'D) Allow me to announce you. The tutor may be there and not dressed. \nAnna shakes her head and is almost running away from him. Kapitonich gives chase. \nINT. STAIRS, KARENIN'S HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nKAPITONICH Please allow me! \nINT. UPPER LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY \nAnna dashes past two Housemaids who gape at her, and disappears round the corner. She's a little mad now. \nINT. UPPER STAIRS, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY \nAnna, wild-eyed, climbs the stairs and meets the tutor, Vasily Lukich, coming down, buttoning his waistcoat. Lukich is startled, not knowing her. \nANNA I've come to see Sergei Alexeyich. \nKapitonich reaches these stairs, calling, \"Your Excellency . . . !\" \nINT. TOP FLOOR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY \nAnna dashes for Serozha's door and flings herself through it. \nINT. \"SEROZHA'S ROOM,\" KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nIt's no longer Serozha's room. A large Woman sits up in bed. She's probably the Cook. She cries out. Anna reels back. She looks panicked. \nKapitonich catches up, out of breath. \nKAPITONICH He's been moved to the small sitting room. \nINT. UPPER STAIRS, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY \nAt the bottom of the Upper Stairs, Lukich, the Housemaids and a couple of half-dressed Footmen have their heads together. They move aside as Anna hurries by, seeing nothing. \nINT. UPPER LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAY \nKapitonich catches up with Anna at the door of the \"small sitting room.\" \nKAPITONICH I'll just look in. \nAnna shakes her head and walks past him, into the room. \nINT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nThe curtains are drawn closed. The room is dim. Anna sees Serozha sitting up, yawning, his eyes closed, and falling back on the pillow. She comes to the bed and whispers his name. Serozha raises himself on his elbow, opens his eyes and smiles dreamily and falls forward into her arms. \nSEROZHA Mama. \nANNA Oh, my dear little boy. \nSEROZHA I knew you would come. Today is my birthday. \nSerozha rubs his face on her neck, falls back on the pillow, only half awake and going back to sleep. Anna looks at him avidly, touching his forearms, his shoulders, the hair over his ears. She can't stop her own tears. He comes awake. \nSEROZHA (CONT'D) Are you crying? \nANNA I won't cry. It's time for you to get dressed. And I almost forgot your present, look . . . open it . . . \nSerozha takes off her hat. \nSEROZHA You don't want that . . . Let me see. \nVRONSKY I know how to make you sleep. \nLATER--IN BED \nVronsky makes love to Anna but it's not working for her. Her eyes stray around. By the bed is a carafe of water, an empty glass and a pharmacy bottle as dark as ink, with a handwritten label. \nEXT. MOSCOW--DAY \nHigh summer. Heat and dust. \nINT. TEA SHOP, MOSCOW--DAY \nAnna, with some dainty shopping by her, is taking tea in a genteel cafe. Her eye is caught by a mother and son at another table. The boy is a \"Serozha.\" Anna misses her son acutely in that moment. \nThen Dolly enters the tea shop. Anna's heart lifts for a moment and she is about to greet her, but then realises that Dolly is one of a trio of \"society ladies,\" and Anna lowers her head. When she sneaks a look, she catches one of the ladies whispering to the others. Anna realises that she has been recognised by a stranger, and is notorious. She \"hides\" in her purse, finding money to leave on the table so that she can escape. A sound makes her look up and she sees that Dolly has sat down opposite her. \nDOLLY Anna . . . I am very glad to see you. Are you well? How is your little one? \nAnna nods, words won't come. \nDOLLY (CONT'D) Stiva wanted to invite you and Count Vron- sky to the house but it's impossible . . . \nANNA I understand. \nDOLLY No, no--you don't. Kitty and her husband are with us. She's in Moscow to have the baby. \nANNA Kitty . . . ? Oh, tell her how pleased I am . . . ! \nDOLLY Perhaps I'll wait a year or two. (she gulps a laugh) Oh . . . love! \nANNA Yes . . . love! Don't you disapprove of me for what I've done? \nDOLLY No. I wish I'd done the same. But no one asked me! Well . . . I wouldn't have been brave enough. (she blinks tears) Stiva, you know . . . he doesn't change . . . like all men, I suppose. \nShe doesn't notice her tactlessness but it lands on Anna, who manages a smile. \nEXT. GRAND HOTEL, MOSCOW--NIGHT \nINT. HOTEL SUITE, MOSCOW--NIGHT \nAnna, in a nightdress, is awake in the night, staring out of the grand window of a grand hotel, smoking. \nINT. HOTEL BEDROOM, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nAnna comes back to bed. Vronsky is asleep. She unstops a pharmacy bottle (a different one) and pours a draught mixed with water. \nINT. BEDROOM, MOSCOW HOTEL--DAY \nAnna sleeps alone in the bed. Annushka, after a tap on the door, comes in cautiously, worried. \nANNUSHKA Madame . . . Madame . . . \nAnna sits up. \nANNUSHKA (CONT'D) Are you ill? \nANNA What time is it? Is Anya up? \nANNUSHKA It's afternoon, Madame. \nANNA I'm all right. It's all right. (PAUSE) Get them to bring up all our trunks and travel cases. We've been here long enough. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE, MOSCOW--DAY \nVronsky comes in, noting the empty trunks and cases stacked up. Anna comes from her room to greet him. She is making an effort to be pleasant, but she looks excited, febrile. \nANNA I had an inspiration. Why do we have to wait here? Why can't we wait in the coun- try? I don't want to hear any more about a divorce, or think about it. \nVRONSKY Good! I'm bored here. When should we go? \nANNA If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the country. \nVRONSKY I didn't say you bore me. Moscow bores me. When should we go? . . . Tomorrow? \nBut Anna's mood has turned. \nANNA I can't be ready by tomorrow. \nVRONSKY The day after, then. \nANNA If you like. \nVRONSKY No, wait. That's Sunday. I have to see Maman. \nANNA That's twenty minutes away in the train-- you could go to see her tomorrow--or was it that you wanted to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina? \nVRONSKY Please don't spoil everything. I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't have read the papers she has to sign. Oh, and then there's the bank . . . But we can leave on Tuesday. \nANNA In that case, let's not bother. I'll leave on Sunday or not at all. \nVRONSKY That's absurd! \nANNA It's absurd to you because you have no understanding for my life here. \nVRONSKY Anna . . . Anna . . . \nANNA You've stopped loving me. You've given up everything for me, and it's turned you against me. Why lie about it? \nVRONSKY Stop. I put off our departure for a day or two, and you tell me I don't love you. \nANNA Because I've been living off your love and there's none left, so this is over! Finished. \nANNA When Count Vronsky comes back, tell him . . . I don't want to be disturbed. \nINT. BEDROOM, HOTEL SUITE--NIGHT \nAnna is listening for Vronsky's return. She hears him come in. She hears him approach. Then she hears Annushka's voice, then Vronsky's voice. She waits in suspense, disappointed as Vronsky's steps retreat. \nINT. STUDY, HOTEL SUITE--NIGHT \nAnna, holding a candle-lamp, finds Vronsky asleep on the couch. She hesi- tates, but turns away. \nINT. BEDROOM, HOTEL SUITE--DAY \nAnna wakes. She re-collects herself. She looks at the bedside clock. In a sud- den hurry she leaves the bed and the bedroom. \nINT. OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM, HOTEL SUITE, SAME TIME--DAY \nAnna finds Annushka waiting. \nANNA Count Vronsky . . . ? \nANNUSHKA He went out early, to the stables, he said. \nAnna collapses on a chair and weeps. \nANNA Oh, Annushka . . . I should have died. Do you remember? \nANNUSHKA Don't take it to heart, Anna Arkadyeva . . . \nANNA I've made him hate me. \nINT. CLOSE (HOTEL)--DAY \nAnna's hand writes in a hurry: \"I'm to blame. Come home. I'm frightened.\" \nINT. HOTEL SUITE, SAME TIME--DAY \nAnna seals the note and gives it to Annushka. \nANNA Tell Michael to hurry. \nAnnushka runs out with the note. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE--DAY \nAnna is keeping watch at the window . . . and is rewarded by the return- ing coach. She hurries out. \nINT. STAIRS, HOTEL--DAY \nAnna looks down into the entrance hall. Michael, the Coachman, comes in and comes up the stairs to her. She sees that he is holding her note. \nMICHAEL Count Vronsky had already left, Your Excel- lency. He took a cab to the station . . . to the Countess. \nINT. LOCAL TRAIN--DAY \nAnna clutches her red bag to her, sitting among passengers. \nAnna looks about her. Across the carriage she sees through the window that her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line. \nShe looks at the windows of the other train \"going by\" . . . seeing the pas- sengers inside. \nUnexpectedly, she seems to see a Man who might be Vronsky sitting opposite a laughing Woman who might be Princess Sorokina. \nAnna's body jerks involuntarily. She half rises. The image, however, is brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating. The win- dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind-- \nAnd then she has the same illusion again-- a \"Vronsky\" and a \"Sorokina\" glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant. \nNow she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro- jected film-frames, and she sees \"Vronskys\" and \"Sorokinas\" flashing by at gathering speed. And then the train has gone and there's nothing going by but the view. \nAnna collapses into the nearest seat. \nEXT. LOCAL STATION, SAME TIME--DAY \nThe train arrives at a small station. \nAnna steps down from the train. The platform is well populated by people waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers. There is an energy about the people-- shouting, laughter, movement. Porters shout for custom. A couple of Young Men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her, but they pass by, ignoring her. \nAnna pauses, bewildered, lost, not knowing what to do next. \nShe sees the Sorokina Coachman on the platform, recognising his distinctive livery, a cockade in his hat. \nANNA Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina? \nCOACHMAN No, Your Excellency, both princesses are at the house of Countess Vronsky. I'm waiting FOR HIM-- \nAnna turns back, agitated, expecting Vronsky to appear, but what comes is a Footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a dress shop. \nAnna walks away, along the platform, impeded by people going by her, aware that some are staring at her as she passes. A Boy selling drinks grins at her. A little group of Ladies and Children meeting a bespectacled man off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her. She increases her pace. She hurries away towards the far end of the platform. Beyond her, a goods train is slowly approaching. Between her and the train, two Maidservants are walking towards her. They turn their heads to look at her, remarking on her dress. \nMAIDSERVANT Look at that lace on her . . . \nThere is a rough bench near the end of the platform. Anna reaches it and sits down. The two girls turn again to look back at her, and are struck by the sight of Anna sitting alone in profile. The goods train reaches her and the first wagon goes past her. The two girls stop and watch, vaguely puzzled by her. \nAs they watch, the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train, disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons. \nEXT. (POKROVSKOE)--DAY \nCLOSE--A SCYTHE CUTS A SWATHE THROUGH STANDING HAY. \nEXT. RAILS--THE RED HANDBAG \n--lying separate against a rail, is clipped by a rolling train-wheel and knocked aside, spilling its contents . . . \n", "test1_input": "He comes to bed in his nightshirt. \nKARENIN (CONT'D) Here it made quite a sensation. \nHe gets into bed. Anna waits dead-eyed. Karenin blows his candle out. \nINT. KITTY'S ROOM, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE, MOSCOW--DAY \nKitty, a hollow-eyed version of herself, in a demure nightdress, sits upright on a chaise longue with her legs stretched out. The Family Doctor deferen- tially removes one of her slippers as though it were an intimate garment. \nFAMILY DOCTOR Forgive me, Princess, but I must . . . \nWith a silver \"fork\" the Doctor tests the sole of her foot for a reflex. Kitty is miserably going along with a farce she despises. \nINT. OUTSIDE KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY \nThe Prince and Princess are hovering. The Princess flutters with anxiety, the Prince is in a temper. \nPRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Am I the only one who knows what's wrong with her? \nBut a Celebrity Doctor, as shiny as his own gold watch which he is check- ing, is bearing down on them, riding over a Footman's attempt to announce him. \nPRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY Oh, thank God, doctor--my friends say you're the only one who can save her! \nCELEBRITY DOCTOR Possibly, Princess, possibly! At your service, Your Excellencies. Where is the patient? \nINT. KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY \nKitty is sobbing with shame: the Celebrity Doctor has stripped her to the waist and is tapping her chest. The Family Doctor can't bear it and excuses himself. \nCELEBRITY DOCTOR Come, come, Princess, we are not backward people--I handle naked bodies every day. Deep breath now . . . \nINT. OUTSIDE KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY \nThe Family Doctor and the parents are in a huddle. The Prince is apoplectic. \nPRINCE SHCHERBATSKY By God. I'll challenge the scoundrel! \nFAMILY DOCTOR It's the modern way . . . \nPRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY (to the Prince) You're not a doctor! \nFAMILY DOCTOR Her symptoms . . . loss of appetite, fast PULSE-- \nPRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Well, whose pulse wouldn't be fast if some brute of a-- \nThe Celebrity Doctor comes briskly out of Kitty's room, checking his watch. \nCELEBRITY DOCTOR Nervous palpitations. We must treat the nerves. A tubercular cavity is suspected, too soon to tell. Soden water every two hours. I must see her again tomorrow. (HE BOWS) Prince! Princess! \nHe's gone. The Prince enters Kitty's room. \nINT. KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY \nKitty is humiliated and triple-wrapped against the violation of her bosom. \nPRINCE SHCHERBATSKY Don't you fret, my little Kate! You'll wake up one fine morning and say to yourself--\"I feel well and happy and I'll go out for a walk with Papa!\" \nThe Prince is mortified when Kitty's sobs redouble. \nINT. ART EXHIBITION, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY \nThe social set Anna now moves in is the brilliant circle with connections to the Court on one hand and to the demi-monde of artists on the other. A leading light of this set is Princess Betsy Tverskaya, a rich society beauty. Betsy's immediate circle includes Tuskevich, her \"admirer.\" \nAnna lifts her eyes to see Vronsky in front of her, talking to Betsy. Vronsky sees Anna and bows. She acknowledges him and kisses Betsy, and moves on, studying the next picture. Vronsky watches Anna move on. Betsy cocks an eye at him. \nINT. PIANO RECITAL, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY \nA few rows of chairs in someone's reception room, a mixed audience of guests, a flashy pianist . . . Betsy with a \"toy\" dog on her lap, Tuskevich on one side, Anna on the other. \nThe dog yaps and sneezes. Betsy hands the dog to Tuskevich, who goes to exit with the dog. As Tuskevich leaves, Vronsky comes in. Anna sees him. She turns back to the piano. Betsy glances at her. \nEXT. PARK, ST. PETERSBURG--DAY \nAnna and Betsy, on a bright snow-white day, are being driven through a park in Betsy's smart equipage . . . towards a horseman walking towards them: Vronsky salutes the little carriage as it trots by him. Anna keeps looking straight ahead. Betsy acknowledges Vronsky's salute. \nBETSY I want to give a small dinner before the opera. Is there anyone you would like me to ask? \nANNA Yes . . . Yes, the Metropolitan Bishop of St. Petersburg. \nBetsy laughs. \nINT. STAIRS AND ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE--NIGHT \nAnnushka puts Anna's opera cloak over her shoulders, while Korney stands ready with Karenin's cloak and opera hat. Karenin comes down the stairs to join Anna. Kapitonich stands ready to let them out. \nKARENIN Countess Lydia tells me you haven't been to one of her evenings since you returned. \nANNA The last one was to meet a missionary, the one before was for a lecture on the union of the Greek and Roman churches. (CLIMBS DOWN) I'm sorry--I know you're fond of her. Come on, or we'll be late. \nKapitonich opens the door to let them out. \nINT. \"FRENCH THEATRE,\" ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT \nThis is a small theatre with a \"promenade\" area where a group of Guards Officers of high and low rank mix together to enjoy the chanteuses, the comedians and the can-can girls. Vronsky is with his Commanding Officer, Colonel Demin. \nDEMIN Here's the thing, Vronsky. A posting has come up and there's a promotion in it for you. \nVRONSKY Thank you, sir. \nDEMIN The garrison in Tashkent. \n", "test1_true": "DEMIN I don't mind. But your mother . . . \nThe can-can music starts up, to many cheers. Demin claps enthusiastically. Vronsky is angry. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT \nAn attendant takes Vronsky's coat and gives him a token for it. There is a performance going on within, resolving into applause as he mounts the stairs. \nKarenin, an escapee looking at his pocket watch, comes down the stairs, goes down past Vronsky, looks back at him for a moment, and continues. \nINT. BETSY'S OPERA BOX--NIGHT \nVronsky enters the box as the performance prepares to resume. It is the Tverskoy box, occupied by Princess Betsy and her husband, who is likeable, overweight and, strangely enough, looking at an antiquarian book; wear- ing white gloves. Vronsky bows to them and sits down next to Betsy. He takes her opera glasses and looks through them at the Karenin box. \nBETSY You didn't come to my dinner. \nVRONSKY I had to see my Commanding Officer. \nBETSY \"She\" didn't come either. \nVronsky watches Anna through the glasses. Countess Lydia Ivanovna is next to her. Lydia is in her forties, sallow, no beauty, sincerely religious, and determined. \nINT. KARENIN OPERA BOX, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nLYDIA . . . work never ceases for great men. \nYour husband is a saint and we must all cherish him for Russia's sake. \nAnna winces a smile. \nLYDIA (CONT'D) I hope you can come on afterwards--Father Kristof's report on the Chinese mission will be with lantern slides. \nANNA I'm expected at the Tverskoys. \nLYDIA No doubt, but I'm sure Princess Betsy can wait for you, my dear. \nAnna glances at Betsy's box and sees Vronsky there. The opera resumes. \nANNA Yes. In fact, I think I won't go to Betsy's. \nINT. TVERSKOY OPERA BOX, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nVronsky looks through Betsy's glasses. \nBETSY You're caught. \nVRONSKY I'm afraid I am becoming ridiculous. \nINT. BETSY'S RECEPTION ROOMS, TVERSKOY HOUSE--DAY \nDiscreet Footmen move chairs to accommodate the guests who move to join one of the conversation circles that make a buzz in the room. Betsy sits by the samovar with her little court, including Tuskevich. The Guests include the Princess Myagkaya, stout, red-faced, outspoken, and two Society ladies, Lisa Merkalova and \"Anna's Friend.\" \nVronsky arrives. \nLISA MERKALOVA Now, there's a phenomenon, look-- Anna's shadow has arrived before Anna! \nANNA'S FRIEND I'm Anna's friend . . . but this making-up- one's-mind-to-it in public is not polite to a distinguished man like Karenin. \nPRINCESS MYAGKAYA In my opinion Karenin is a fool, and Anna is the best of us. \nLISA MERKALOVA And we all love you for your contrary opin- ions, Princess. \nVronsky looks around. He knows everybody in the room. \nBETSY Alexei . . . You look desperate. That's not attractive. \nVRONSKY I'm losing hope. \nBETSY Hope of what? Persuading a virtuous woman to break her marriage vows? \nVRONSKY And how is Tuskevich? \nBETSY That's not attractive either. Besides, I was never virtuous. \nVRONSKY No--you're right. She won't come. I'm going home. \nEXT. TVERSKOY HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT \nThe Karenin coach arrives. It's Anna arriving at Betsy's. She enters the house in almost unseemly haste. Several coaches are waiting. \nINT. CAB, ST. PETERSBURG, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nVronsky, in a state, lets himself be carried along. Then he changes his mind. He puts his head out of the window to shout to the Coachman. \nVRONSKY Turn round! \nINT. BETSY'S RECEPTION ROOMS, TVERSKOY HOUSE--NIGHT \nAnna enters. Faces turn to her. She glances around. She knows at once that Vronsky isn't there. Betsy beckons to her across the room. Anna, self- possessed, smiling, nodding to friends, pressing a hand held out to her, offering the other hand to be kissed, glides through a crowd of Betsy's guests. \nVOICES Wasn't Nilsson glorious? One sees that she has studied Kaulbach, of course . . . \nThere's something Louis Quinze about Tuskevich . . . as if he came with the furniture . . . \nBetsy is smoking elegantly. She kisses Anna. \nBETSY He's gone. But you're just in time for the surprise. \nThere is a series of minor explosions outside and the darkness out there turns into an illuminated garden lit by fountains of fire, sprays of light. The guests react with cries of pleasure and applause. \nAnna turns at once to the window near her, puts her face up against the glass, putting her hands to her temples as if to see the illuminations better. \n", "test1_id": 1206, "test2_input": "Dolly and Karenin sit knee-to-knee in a corner. \nDOLLY . . . but she will be nobody's wife, she'll be ruined. \nKARENIN I tried to save her. She chose ruin. \nDOLLY Alexei Aleksandrevich--look at me. You will have no peace of mind until you forgive her. It was Anna who taught me that. \nKARENIN I do not wish to forgive. I am not a cruel man. I have never hated anyone. But I hate her with all my soul for all the wrong she has done me. \nLevin and Kitty are at the card table, with a spillage of the alphabet pieces. \nOBLONSKY It's your turn to play us something, Countess. \nKITTY AND LEVIN \nLEVIN Since we last met, there is something I have often wanted to ask you. \nKITTY What is that? \nLevin sorts through the alphabet pieces as though he is putting off the moment, but he quickly puts four letters spaced out in a row: D N M N. \nLEVIN This. \nKitty tries. \nKITTY Do Not . . . \nLevin adds an I next to the D. \nKITTY (CONT'D) Did. Did Not. \nLevin shakes his head. He adds an E next to the second N. Kitty concentrates. \nKITTY (CONT'D) The last word is Never. \nLevin nods. Kitty puts letters in place. They read DID NO MEAN NEVER. \nLevin looks into her eyes. \nKitty finds letters and presents Levin with T I D N K. Levin adds NOW to the K. Kitty nods. Levin adds OT to the N. Kitty nods. \nLevin adds an O to the D. Kitty shakes her head. She puts an H after the T. \nLEVIN I know what it says. \nDolly, looking across the room, sees Kitty and Levin serious and smiling, rapt. \nLevin places extra letters: THEN I DID NOT KNOW. Kitty nods. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) Then. But now? \nKitty finds C Y F A F. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) Can You. \nKitty nods. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) Can you Forgive. And Forget. \nLevin puts down I L Y. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) I never stopped . . . \nHe looks up to see silent tears streaming down her face. His own eyes flood. \nEXT. STREET, MOSCOW--NIGHT \nKarenin walks away from the Oblonsky house. He lifts his face to meet the snowflakes. He looks tortured. Snow melts on his face like tears. He takes from his wallet a telegram. \nCLOSE UP TELEGRAM: I BEG YOU TO COME. I NEED YOUR FORGIVENESS. I AM DYING. \nKARENIN Die, then. \nHe stands in the snow, uncertain. \nINT. TRAIN (MOSCOW TO ST. PETERSBURG)--NIGHT \nKarenin sits like a statue. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY \nKarenin is let into the house by Kapitonich. \nKARENIN How is your mistress? \nKAPITONICH Safely delivered of a daughter, Your Excellency. \nKARENIN So . . . she is well? \nKAPITONICH The mistress is very poorly. The doctor . . . \nKarenin, going to the stairs, sees Vronsky's cloak and cap on the coat stand. \nINT. BEDROOM LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nKarenin comes up the staircase. When he reaches his dressing room he hears Anna shouting for \"Alexei\" in her delirium. He hesitates. Anna shouts the name again. Karenin enters Anna's boudoir. \nINT. ANNA'S BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nKarenin sees Vronsky sitting with his hands over his face. Vronsky jumps up in confusion. \n", "test2_true": "Karenin looks at him coldly and enters the bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY \nAnna is not seeing or hearing, struggling against the Doctor and the Mid- wife, while Annushka holds her hand. \nDOCTOR Thank God! She talks only of you. \nIn her delirium, Anna keeps up a bright prattle. \nANNA Why doesn't he come? He is kind. He will forgive me. \nMIDWIFE He's here--look--look--can't you see him? \nANNA I want Alexei! Why doesn't he come? Give me some water. No, I mustn't, it's not good for my little girl. Or let her have a nurse. Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her. \nANNUSHKA He's come, my dear--look there . . . \nAnnushka gives way to Karenin, who kneels by the bed, taking Anna's hand. \nDOCTOR (TO ANNUSHKA) More ice. \nAnnushka hurries out. \nANNA Oh, what nonsense. I must be asleep, that's what it is. You think he won't forgive me but you don't know him. No one knows him except me. I'm not afraid of him now. \nKarenin gazes at her. He looks at her as he's never looked at her. \nANNA (CONT'D) I'm afraid of death, though. \nKarenin tries to speak but cannot. He starts making shushing noises as to a baby. She quietens down. She seems to recognise him. \nANNA (CONT'D) Oh, my dear. Don't look at me like that. I am not the one you think. I'm afraid of her. She fell in love with another man. I'm the real one. But I'm dying now, then she'll be dead, too. Poor man! Let him come in. Alexis! Alexis! \nINT. BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nVronsky hears her calling. He comes into the bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nVronsky covers his face, unmanned. The Doctor nods to the Midwife-- \"Leave them alone.\" They leave. \nANNA Take your hands away from your face. Look at my husband. He's a saint! Take his hand. Alexei--take his hands away. \nKarenin pulls Vronsky's fingers, and holds on to Vronsky's hand. \nANNA (CONT'D) Forgive him, too. Thank God, thank God . . . \nDAWN \nAnna is asleep. Karenin is alone with her. The crisis seems to be over. She opens her eyes. \nANNA (CONT'D) So you came. \nKarenin puts his face down to her shoulder. She strokes him. \nANNA (CONT'D) If I had died as I wanted, you would be free of your troubles at last. \nKARENIN I am free of them. \nAnna closes her eyes and sleeps again. \nBOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nKarenin comes in. Vronsky is there. He looks up abjectly. \nVRONSKY Whatever you think of me, please believe me, I love her--I could not have done other- wise than what I . . . what I did. \nKarenin nods and sits next to him. \nKARENIN But you must leave now.

PETERSBURG \nVronsky arrives back at his flat . . . and finds his mother waiting for him in his sitting room. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY Look at you. You look like what you are. A laughingstock. I fancy you are to be asked to leave the regiment. \nVRONSKY I would like you to go, Maman. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY I will go when I'm ready to go. A little affair with a married woman puts a finish- ing touch to a young man's education--but this morbid, selfish obsession . . . ! You have publicly humiliated a man who has devoted his life to Russia, and it will not be forgot- ten. You'd better come back to Moscow with me. You're finished here. \nVRONSKY In Petersburg? (he taps his breastbone) I'm finished here. \nINT. BEDROOM, VRONSKY FLAT--DAY \nFor the first time, Vronsky is wearing civilian clothes . . . looking reflect- ingly at his uniform hanging in his wardrobe.

BEDROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE, MOSCOW-- DAY \nLevin is half-dressed in clothes to be married in, assisted by Matvey and watched over by Oblonsky, who is in wedding clothes. Levin is frantic.

I'll come in and choose a dress. \nAnnushka goes. \nVRONSKY Anna--I implore you--don't you know . . . ? \nANNA I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've done: are you ashamed for me? Why do you keep a room at the hotel? Aren't we together? Have you changed towards me? \nVRONSKY It's because I love you and care about you. \nANNA If that's the case, I don't know why you aren't coming with me. \nVRONSKY That would make it worse. \nANNA You're afraid. Well, I'm not. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT \nBefore the performance, the stairs, galleries and corridors, giving access to the stalls and boxes, are crowded with the town's highest society.

Awareness of her presence is like a contagion, and yet everyone manages not to catch her eye . . . so while all around her there are people impeding each other with greetings, Anna's path opens before her. \nShe knows what is happening. It shocks her but her eyes barely show it. The spell is broken by Princess Myagkaya (she of the 85 kopek sauce) who hails her. \nPRINCESS MYAGKAYA Anna . . . ! \nShe picks up on the surrounding effect of this, and rubs it in with mischief, taking Anna's arm. \nprincess myagkaya (cont'd) Something has done you good--you look wonderful. \nINT.

She turns away. \nANNA Stay put. \nPrincess Myagkaya has engaged the attention of Stremov in the neighbour- ing box. \nPRINCESS MYAGKAYA Minister! Congratulations. Come in for a moment. \nBut Stremov only bows coldly and turns away. Yashvin notes this and begins to chew his moustache anxiously. Anna's neighbour on the other side, a meek husband of a battle-axe, admires her openly. \nAnna sees that Vronsky has stopped to talk to Countess Vronsky and the Princesses Sorokina. The young Princess seems animated by Vronsky, who bows himself away. \nPrincess Myagkaya sees where Anna is looking. \nprincess myagkaya (cont'd) Princess Sorokina and her daughter, they're from Moscow, neighbours of Countess Vron- sky, quite well off, no sons, she's a widow. \nAnna gives her a smiling but wounded look. \nprincess myagkaya (cont'd) My dear, I'm a sales catalogue. \nINT.

Colonel, would you be so kind . . . ? \nYASHVIN Of course. \nAnna's neighbour, emboldened, offers her his programme. \nNEIGHBOUR Please . . .

{"test1_input": "EXT. THE LADIES' STAND, THE RACES, SAME TIME-- DAY \nAnna and Betsy are here, and, not far away, so are Countess Vronsky and the Princesses Sorokina: the mother is a fading fortyish; the daughter is eighteen, blonde and pretty. \nBelow the ladies section is a planked standing area for gentlemen, who also may stand to watch the races from the stepped aisle of the seated section. Soldiers, Horse People and Locals watch from the turf. \nA race is flowing towards the winning post, with accompanying crowd reac- tion, but it is clear from Anna's detachment, exchanging chat with Betsy, that this is not Vronsky's race. \nKARENIN \n--looks up to the ladies' stand. Betsy smiles at him in greeting, but Anna seems unaware. \nCountess Vronsky appraises the young princess. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY Exquisite creature . . . you really ought to be the spoil of victory today . . . \nThe young princess smiles at her. Countess Vronsky turns her glasses towards the Starting Post. \nEXT. NEAR THE STARTING POST, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAY \n. . . Vronsky mounts Frou-Frou. The Riders move to the starting line. \nKARENIN \n. . . watches Anna who is looking through her glasses towards the Starting Post while the current race finishes to cheers. \nKARENIN, SMILING AROUND, WATCHES AS:-- \nAnna's anxious attention turns to a horse and rider who fell further down the course-- and to the ambulance wagon (with a red cross sewn on it) . . . \nKarenin mounts the steps of the aisle, raising his hat to ladies he knows. Anna ignores him. \nOn the wooden boards below, where gentlemen are watching, Oblonsky calls up to Betsy. \nOBLONSKY Princess! A bet! What do you fancy in the next? \nBETSY Kusolev. \nOBLONSKY I'm on Vronsky. A pair of gloves? \nBETSY Done! (TO ANNA) Alexander Vronsky . . . \nIn the aisle at the top of the stand, Karenin watches as:-- \nVronsky's brother Alexander, escorting his wife, Varya, bows to Anna and Betsy, but significantly Varya succeeds in not noticing them. \nEXT. STARTING POST, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAY \nThe riders line up . . . and they're off. \nVRONSKY'S POV \nThe stands and spectators are distant, the first fence coming at him, horses on either side. His neighbour falls at the fence but Frou-Frou is clear, with Gladiator half a length in front. The next fence is coming up. Gladiator and Frou-Frou jump cleanly but a following horse falls badly. \nEXT. LADIES' STAND, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAY \nSpectators on either side of Anna and those behind and in front collectively react. \nKARENIN SEES THAT: \nAnna reacts not at all. Her gaze through her glasses stays unwavering on Vronsky. Karenin notes this, and from then on his attention is fixed on Anna. When the horses come opposite the stand, she lowers her glasses and follows Frou-Frou taking the lead from Gladiator. \nVRONSKY \n-- eases Frou-Frou past Gladiator. The horses take the next jump. \nLADIES' STAND \nWith one hand Anna grips her folded fan. \nKarenin's face is a mask as he watches Anna unconsciously half-destroying it. She raises her glasses. \nANNA'S POV THROUGH GLASSES \nFrou-Frou approaches the last fence with Gladiator half a length behind, on the near side to Anna. \nVRONSKY \n-- working the reins, rising and falling in rhythm with the horse, looks ahead to the winning post, and before knowing it he makes an error, losing the rhythm, dropping back into the saddle and raising the horse's head, just as Frou-Frou takes off. \nANNA'S POV (THROUGH GLASSES) \nFrou-Frou rises, Gladiator rises. Frou-Frou disappears. Gladiator clears the fence in Anna's foreground. Simultaneously, there are shrieks and exclamations all around her-- OFF CAMERA-- and the view through the glasses zigzags in search of Frou-Frou, impeded by horses jumping the fence. \nShe lowers the glasses and sees Frou-Frou on the ground, rolling over, and Vronsky on the ground. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY \n-- sees this, too, her mouth set tight with contempt. \nKARENIN \n--looks shocked. Almost in the same moment he hears Anna's anguished cry, conspicuous in the hubbub that follows the crowd's exclamation. \nANNA Alexei . . . ! \nKARENIN I'm here. \nThis is adroit. He comes down several steps and pushes through to offer his arm, but Anna has lost control, trying to escape like a bird beating against its cage. \nKARENIN (CONT'D) Would you like to leave? \n", "test1_true": "ON THE COURSE \nVronsky extricates himself from his broken horse and, in terrible recrimina- tion, tries to pull Frou-Frou to her feet by the reins. Frou-Frou struggles to get up but her back is broken. Officials, officers, and a doctor have come running. \nANNA \n. . . sees an Officer hurrying to the Imperial party to report. \nANNA Stiva! What are they saying? \nOBLONSKY Vronsky's unhurt--but the horse . . . \nAnna relapses into sobs, attempting to hide her face behind her destroyed fan. Betsy gives Anna her fan. \nVRONSKY \n--is restrained by an Officer. \nOFFICER Her back's broken! \nThe Officer takes a pistol from his holster. Vronsky, enraged and in grief, takes the pistol from him. \nKARENIN \n--persists with Anna. \nKARENIN I'm asking you . . . if you wish to go . . . \nHe touches Anna's arm. She jerks it away. \nANNA No, leave me alone. \nBETSY I'll bring her home, Alexei. \nKARENIN (SMILING POLITELY) Excuse me, Princess, but Anna is not well and I want her to come with me. \nA gunshot is heard from the course. Anna turns her tear-streaked face towards it. \nINT. MOVING COACH--DAY \nAnna's hysteria has solidified into a blank despair. Karenin seems to want to pretend that nothing important has happened. \nKARENIN You know . . . they say the Emperor dis- approves of the races . . . the danger of injury . . . but I . . . \nAnna looks at him contemptuously. \nANNA What? \nKARENIN I'm saying there is a value in manly sport, for the military-- \nANNA I don't understand. \nKARENIN In my opinion, it's not the sport itself that's wrong, it's the spectacle, it's making a cruel spectacle out of-- \nANNA What are you talking about? \nKarenin changes tack. \nKARENIN I have to tell you-- \nANNA Yes. \nKARENIN I have to tell you, you behaved improperly today. \nANNA And how was that? \nShe has raised her voice. He raises a warning finger, and reaches to close the communication window behind the coachman's box. \nKARENIN By making plain your feelings when one of the riders fell. Your conduct was improper. It must not occur again. I have said it before. \nAnna smiles faintly. He is misled by that. \nKARENIN (CONT'D) You are going to say my concern is unneces- sary and ridiculous. You are my wife. I am wrong to think that . . . yes--perhaps I was mistaken. \nAnna looks at him despairingly. \nANNA No, you were not mistaken. I love him. I am his mistress. I can't bear you, I'm afraid of you, I hate you. Do what you like to me. \nKarenin is literally winded--gasping for breath, slowly getting his breath- ing under control. Anna huddles away from him in her corner. Karenin recovers himself only to the point of sitting stock-still, looking at nothing, not moving. \nThe coach lurches, unbalancing him so that he is pushed against Anna. He recoils as if from a contamination. \nThe coach slows. The coach stops. A Servant comes to the coach door, opens the door. \nKARENIN Wait, please. Move away. \nThe Servant backs off. \nKARENIN (CONT'D) I will not have a scandal. Therefore . . . You will not see . . . this man again. You will behave in such a way that nothing is known against you, by society or by the servants. In return, you will keep the privileges of a \nwife--and the duties. Tomorrow you will return home. That is all. \nAnna gets out of the coach and runs into the maze. \nEXT. MAZE--NIGHT \nAnna comes to Vronsky. She is still shaken by the showdown with Karenin in his coach, but is now overtaken by concern for Vronsky after his fall. \nANNA Are you hurt? \nVronsky shakes his head. He is moved by the sight of her, full of love and desire, but in her embrace he detects something new, a nervous exaltation. \n", "test1_id": 1206, "test2_input": "VRONSKY What's happened? \nANNA I told him I'm your mistress. \nVronsky lifts her face, strokes her cheek. He waits. \nANNA (CONT'D) He thinks I can give you up and go on living. \nHe embraces her for that, relieved, grateful, loving--understanding that she is not going to give him up. \nVRONSKY No, you cannot. \nINT. (ST. PETERSBURG)--NIGHT \nImperial hands (the Tsar's for all we know) place over Karenin's head a broad red ribbon from which hangs a heavy medal. Karenin bows low. \nINT. IMPERIAL SALON, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT \nAt an ornate doorway a Major-Domo announces. \nMAJOR DOMO Their Excellencies Minister Karenin and Madame Karenin! \nKarenin, wearing his medal, and Anna smile their way into a party, to a patter of polite applause. Further grandees are being announced, but are not applauded . . . Prince and Princess Berghatskoy . . . Ambassador Chamber- lain . . . Baron and Baroness Verdlov . . . Prince and Princess Tverskoy . . . \nBETSY Alexei Aleksandrevich . . . congratulations. You're the only man my husband would do this for. \nANNA (To Prince Tverskoy) Tell me your latest find for your library. \nPRINCE TVERSKOY Not in front of the Princess. \nBetsy draws Anna away for a moment. \nBETSY I can tell you're happy. You've put on a little weight. \nANNA Both true. \nINT. SEROZHA'S BEDROOM, KARENIN'S HOUSE-- NIGHT \nAnna, in the same dress, kisses Serozha tenderly so as not to wake him, and leaves the room. \nINT. BEDROOM LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nAnna enters the suite where Karenin, in his dressing gown, puts down his book. He is elated by his evening. \nKARENIN Time for bed! \nINT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG-- NIGHT \nAnna is in bed. Karenin is getting ready for bed. Anna listens apprehen- sively to the little noises of Karenin's pre-coital preparations. \nKARENIN . . . not that I care for decorations but . . . \nANNA Alexei . . . I can't . . . I'm sorry . . . But I'm his wife now. (she turns to him) I am having his child. \nKarenin stares at her. He turns back to the open drawer and puts things back the way they were. He locks the drawer. He puts on his dressing gown and leaves the room. Anna waits a moment and follows him. \nINT. SITTING ROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME-- NIGHT \nIt's dark. Anna hears the crack of his knuckles and can see him faintly, sitting in the dark. \nKARENIN Tell me what I did to deserve this. \nEXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--DAY \nA prospect: next to a country road, a large expanse of meadow is being mown forty swathes at a time by forty mowers swinging their scythes almost in unison. \nCLOSER--Levin is suffering but keeping up, bathed in perspiration. His place is behind an old man, Theodore, who is scything as if without effort. Just in time for Levin, Theodore calls a halt and takes Levin's scythe to sharpen it with a whetstone. Levin attracts a few grins and comments. \nYOUNG PEASANT Konstantin Dmitrich, you'll know your rows when the field's all done! \nLevin's row has stalks of differing heights between the even swathes on either side. There is some laughter, but the men are uneasy. \nEXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)-- SUNDOWN \nIt's time to stop for the day. More tomorrow. The Mowers with their scythes walk back across the large meadow of cut swathes. From the other direc- tion, a crowd of Village Women are coming to meet them carrying food and drink. \nEXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--DUSK \nA fire has been lit. The Mowers eat their meal in the company of women. Serafina tends to a cooking pot in the firelight. Levin watches her discreetly. He has settled down at a discreet distance from the men. His attention is caught by a grown-up Boy and his young Wife who have chosen to sit slightly apart. He is charmed by them, watching the girl serve her husband. \nTheodore comes to Levin with a jug. Levin takes a swig. \nLEVIN How many mowers is it, Theodore? \nTHEODORE Forty-two, master. In your father's time it was work for two days for thirty men . . . (SLYLY) . . . though he never picked up a scythe himself. \nLEVIN The men don't like me for it. \nTHEODORE They like what they're used to. \nLEVIN It settles me. \nTHEODORE How is that, master? \nLEVIN When I'm mowing, I don't ask myself why I'm here. \nTHEODORE You're here to be master, Konstantin Dmi- trich, to be your father's son, and father to a son who will be master after you, as it has always been by the grace of God. \nLEVIN My father owned you, Theodore. My grand- father owned your father. Owned you like chattels, to be bought and sold. Was that by the grace of God? \nTHEODORE It was. Those were good times when your father had the keeping of us. That's my youngest you were looking at there. His young life is perilous now since the Free- dom came and work must be found. \n", "test2_true": "THEODORE (LAUGHS) At his wife too, I dare say. \nLevin is abashed, found out. \nLEVIN They look happier than I've ever been. Is it living simply that I'm looking for? \nEXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--NIGHT \nNight under the stars. Some of the men have gone, some have settled in for the night. The cooking fire is burning out. Levin remains where he was, watching, thinking: drawn to \"the simple life.\" \nEXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--DAWN \nLevin wakes . . . woken by hoofbeats and the jingle of harness. \nLevin sees a coach coming towards him. The coach comes nearer, leather boxes strapped to the roof. \nLevin sees that a young woman is looking out of the side window, holding on to the white ribbons of her bonnet. He sees that it is Kitty, on her way to Ergoshovo. (Princess Shcherbatsky is also inside, dozing.) \nThe coach passes on, leaving Levin lovelorn, the dawn light on him. The sight of Kitty has turned him round again. \nINT. STATION, ST PETERSBURG--DAY \nAUTUMN \nVronsky stands at the entrance to the platform holding a bouquet, waiting for a train. He looks pretty fed up. \nINT. \"FRENCH THEATRE,\" ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT \nAs before, the set-up is a small stage, a small auditorium, and an area for drinking, cruising, etc., a combination of music hall and a bar with a few tables. Vronsky is here as the escort of a Foreign Prince (an Indian), watch- ing a \"risqu\u00e9\" show with Can-Can Girls, much relished by the visitor. \nVronsky's glance casts about in the gloom. The champagne is flowing. Vron- sky spots a trio--Lisa Merkalova, Betsy, and Stremov, a politician and Karenin's rival. \nVronsky catches Betsy's eye. She beckons him. He excuses himself to the Foreign Prince, who doesn't notice, and goes over to the other table. Under the music, he is introduced to Stremov, and kisses the hands of the women. He takes the empty chair. \nVRONSKY He's some kind of prince at home. Exhaust- ing. Where is Tuskevitch this evening? \nBETSY Why ask me? \nAt which moment, Makhotin appears at the table. Vronsky relinquishes his chair. \nVRONSKY Captain Makhotin . . . \nVronsky bows to the women. \nVRONSKY (CONT'D) I must leave you. I'm on duty tonight. \nMAKHOTIN Lucky woman. Give her my respects, and to Karenin if you see him. \nVronsky freezes in anger. \nBETSY Don't. Would you compromise me? And Lisa? \nLisa and Stremov are enjoying it. Vronsky turns away. The Foreign Prince is applauding enthusiastically when Vronsky rejoins him. \nSTREMOV (SMIRKS) I only say that a man who can't govern his wife has perhaps gone as far as he can go in government. \nINT. BEDROOM, VRONSKY'S FLAT, ST. PETERSBURG-- DAY \nVronsky wakes. He has fallen asleep in his clothes. A note has been deliv- ered, propped up by the bed. He reaches for it. \nEXT. KARENIN HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHT \nA cab brings Vronsky. The Karenin coach is waiting outside. As Vronsky approaches the door, it opens and Kapitonich comes out with a folded rug. Kapitonich is wrong-footed by seeing him. Karenin comes out of the door, into the gaslight. When he sees Vronsky he hesitates for a fraction but con- tinues. Kapitonich is holding open the door of the coach. Vronsky bows, Karenin, expressionless, touches his hat and gets into the coach, taking the rug. Vronsky walks into the house as the coach moves off. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nKapitonich comes in, closing the door. Vronsky gives him his hat and coat. \nKAPITONICH Good evening, Your Excellency. \nKapitonich is uneasy. A Footman comes from a service door. He sees Vron- sky and looks to Kapitonich. \nVRONSKY I am expected. \nKapitonich nods to the Footman. \nINT. RECEPTION ROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHT \nAnna, six months pregnant, is seated almost formally. The Footman lets Vronsky in and retires closing the door. Anna runs to Vronsky. \nANNA No!--no. I will not live like this! \nHe holds her, calming her, hushing her. \nHe leads her into a Winter Garden conservatory off the Reception Room. \nANNA (CONT'D) Waiting hour after hour while you're drink- ing champagne with naked actresses-- don't think I don't know!--Lisa Merkalova still calls on me. \nVRONSKY It's punishment enough that I'm on escort duty, without . . . \nANNA Yes--I'm sorry--it's my demon, I can't help it. \nVRONSKY You wrote that you were ill. \nANNA Did I? Well, I am! (GAILY) But don't worry! It won't be for long, I'll soon be out of your way--soon! \nVRONSKY Stop. \nANNA No, it's true. I was told it in a dream. \nVRONSKY There, it was only a bad dream. \n", "test2_id": 1207, "test3_input": "Dolly and Karenin sit knee-to-knee in a corner. \nDOLLY . . . but she will be nobody's wife, she'll be ruined. \nKARENIN I tried to save her. She chose ruin. \nDOLLY Alexei Aleksandrevich--look at me. You will have no peace of mind until you forgive her. It was Anna who taught me that. \nKARENIN I do not wish to forgive. I am not a cruel man. I have never hated anyone. But I hate her with all my soul for all the wrong she has done me. \nLevin and Kitty are at the card table, with a spillage of the alphabet pieces. \nOBLONSKY It's your turn to play us something, Countess. \nKITTY AND LEVIN \nLEVIN Since we last met, there is something I have often wanted to ask you. \nKITTY What is that? \nLevin sorts through the alphabet pieces as though he is putting off the moment, but he quickly puts four letters spaced out in a row: D N M N. \nLEVIN This. \nKitty tries. \nKITTY Do Not . . . \nLevin adds an I next to the D. \nKITTY (CONT'D) Did. Did Not. \nLevin shakes his head. He adds an E next to the second N. Kitty concentrates. \nKITTY (CONT'D) The last word is Never. \nLevin nods. Kitty puts letters in place. They read DID NO MEAN NEVER. \nLevin looks into her eyes. \nKitty finds letters and presents Levin with T I D N K. Levin adds NOW to the K. Kitty nods. Levin adds OT to the N. Kitty nods. \nLevin adds an O to the D. Kitty shakes her head. She puts an H after the T. \nLEVIN I know what it says. \nDolly, looking across the room, sees Kitty and Levin serious and smiling, rapt. \nLevin places extra letters: THEN I DID NOT KNOW. Kitty nods. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) Then. But now? \nKitty finds C Y F A F. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) Can You. \nKitty nods. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) Can you Forgive. And Forget. \nLevin puts down I L Y. \nLEVIN (CONT'D) I never stopped . . . \nHe looks up to see silent tears streaming down her face. His own eyes flood. \nEXT. STREET, MOSCOW--NIGHT \nKarenin walks away from the Oblonsky house. He lifts his face to meet the snowflakes. He looks tortured. Snow melts on his face like tears. He takes from his wallet a telegram. \nCLOSE UP TELEGRAM: I BEG YOU TO COME. I NEED YOUR FORGIVENESS. I AM DYING. \nKARENIN Die, then. \nHe stands in the snow, uncertain. \nINT. TRAIN (MOSCOW TO ST. PETERSBURG)--NIGHT \nKarenin sits like a statue. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY \nKarenin is let into the house by Kapitonich. \nKARENIN How is your mistress? \nKAPITONICH Safely delivered of a daughter, Your Excellency. \nKARENIN So . . . she is well? \nKAPITONICH The mistress is very poorly. The doctor . . . \nKarenin, going to the stairs, sees Vronsky's cloak and cap on the coat stand. \nINT. BEDROOM LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nKarenin comes up the staircase. When he reaches his dressing room he hears Anna shouting for \"Alexei\" in her delirium. He hesitates. Anna shouts the name again. Karenin enters Anna's boudoir. \nINT. ANNA'S BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nKarenin sees Vronsky sitting with his hands over his face. Vronsky jumps up in confusion. \n", "test3_true": "Karenin looks at him coldly and enters the bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY \nAnna is not seeing or hearing, struggling against the Doctor and the Mid- wife, while Annushka holds her hand. \nDOCTOR Thank God! She talks only of you. \nIn her delirium, Anna keeps up a bright prattle. \nANNA Why doesn't he come? He is kind. He will forgive me. \nMIDWIFE He's here--look--look--can't you see him? \nANNA I want Alexei! Why doesn't he come? Give me some water. No, I mustn't, it's not good for my little girl. Or let her have a nurse. Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her. \nANNUSHKA He's come, my dear--look there . . . \nAnnushka gives way to Karenin, who kneels by the bed, taking Anna's hand. \nDOCTOR (TO ANNUSHKA) More ice. \nAnnushka hurries out. \nANNA Oh, what nonsense. I must be asleep, that's what it is. You think he won't forgive me but you don't know him. No one knows him except me. I'm not afraid of him now. \nKarenin gazes at her. He looks at her as he's never looked at her. \nANNA (CONT'D) I'm afraid of death, though. \nKarenin tries to speak but cannot. He starts making shushing noises as to a baby. She quietens down. She seems to recognise him. \nANNA (CONT'D) Oh, my dear. Don't look at me like that. I am not the one you think. I'm afraid of her. She fell in love with another man. I'm the real one. But I'm dying now, then she'll be dead, too. Poor man! Let him come in. Alexis! Alexis! \nINT. BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nVronsky hears her calling. He comes into the bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nVronsky covers his face, unmanned. The Doctor nods to the Midwife-- \"Leave them alone.\" They leave. \nANNA Take your hands away from your face. Look at my husband. He's a saint! Take his hand. Alexei--take his hands away. \nKarenin pulls Vronsky's fingers, and holds on to Vronsky's hand. \nANNA (CONT'D) Forgive him, too. Thank God, thank God . . . \nDAWN \nAnna is asleep. Karenin is alone with her. The crisis seems to be over. She opens her eyes. \nANNA (CONT'D) So you came. \nKarenin puts his face down to her shoulder. She strokes him. \nANNA (CONT'D) If I had died as I wanted, you would be free of your troubles at last. \nKARENIN I am free of them. \nAnna closes her eyes and sleeps again. \nBOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY \nKarenin comes in. Vronsky is there. He looks up abjectly. \nVRONSKY Whatever you think of me, please believe me, I love her--I could not have done other- wise than what I . . . what I did. \nKarenin nods and sits next to him. \nKARENIN But you must leave now. I promise to send for you if she asks for you. I don't know what happened. I forgive you. I forgive Anna. My soul is filled with joy. I will remain with her and look after her for ever. \nKarenin stands up and offers his hand. Vronsky grasps it and starts shaking. \nKARENIN (CONT'D) Come now, come now . . . \nKarenin embraces him, comforting him. \nINT. VRONSKY FLAT, ST. PETERSBURG \nVronsky arrives back at his flat . . . and finds his mother waiting for him in his sitting room. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY Look at you. You look like what you are. A laughingstock. I fancy you are to be asked to leave the regiment. \nVRONSKY I would like you to go, Maman. \nCOUNTESS VRONSKY I will go when I'm ready to go. A little affair with a married woman puts a finish- ing touch to a young man's education--but this morbid, selfish obsession . . . ! You have publicly humiliated a man who has devoted his life to Russia, and it will not be forgot- ten. You'd better come back to Moscow with me. You're finished here. \nVRONSKY In Petersburg? (he taps his breastbone) I'm finished here. \nINT. BEDROOM, VRONSKY FLAT--DAY \nFor the first time, Vronsky is wearing civilian clothes . . . looking reflect- ingly at his uniform hanging in his wardrobe. He places his cavalry cap carefully on a shelf and closes the wardrobe. \nINT. BEDROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE, MOSCOW-- DAY \nLevin is half-dressed in clothes to be married in, assisted by Matvey and watched over by Oblonsky, who is in wedding clothes. Levin is frantic. Oblonsky is perplexed. Matvey is unflappable, holding Levin's coat ready and following him around. \nLEVIN . . . no, I'll go to her and tell her it's not too late to stop this business! Better now than when we're married and she realises she doesn't love me! \nOBLONSKY But she does love you! \n", "test3_id": 1208}

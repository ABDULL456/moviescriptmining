Loretta picks up her glass and swallows a healthy dose. 
RONNY She was right to leave me. 
LORETTA You think so? 
RONNY Yes. 
LORETTA You really are stupid, you know that. 
Loretta pours herself another shot. 
RONNY You don't know nothing about it. 
LORETTA I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't. (she pours them both another drink) She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf! 
RONNY I'm a wolf? 
LORETTA The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away. (She grabs his wooden hand) So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free. (throws his hand down) Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again! 
RONNY What are you doing! 
LORETTA I'm telling you your life! 
RONNY Stop it! 
LORETTA No! 
RONNY Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool! 
LORETTA Because I have no Luck! 
RONNY (pounding on the table) He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head! 
LORETTA I am looking where I should to become a bride! 
RONNY A bride without a head! 
LORETTA A wolf without a foot! 
Ronny stiff-arms everything off the dining table and grabs Loretta. They kiss passionately. He pulls her up on the table and over the table to him. They are in each other's arms. They are on fire. Loretta pushes him away, gasping for air. 
LORETTA Wait a minute! Wait a minute! 
She changes her mind and lunges into another kiss. They stop again after a long moment. They really haven't breathed. 
They both suck in air and look at each other in wonder and fear and passion. 
RONNY It's like I'm falling! It's like I'm in the ocean! 
They kiss again. When they pull apart again, Loretta is crying. 
LORETTA I have no Luck! 
He picks her up in his arms. 
RONNY Son of a bitch! 
LORETTA Where are you taking me? 
RONNY To the bed. 
LORETTA Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed. 
He carries her away, into the bedroom. 
MUSIC: "O SOAVE FANCIULLA", from "La Boheme." The MUSIC CONTINUES THROUGH THE NEXT SCENE. 
INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM 
Ronny is laying her down in the bed. He is over her. They look into each other's eyes. 
RONNY I can't believe what is happening. 
LORETTA Me neither. 
RONNY I was dead. 
LORETTA I was dead, too.

54   OUTSIDE DOOR                                                54 
D'Artagnan slips closer, reaches for the handle, finds it unlocked. He opens the door a fraction, holds an ear close... 
55   BACK TO SCENE                                               55 Richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve, and hands it to Milady. 
RICHELIEU Carry this to the Duke of Buckingham. 
(CONTINUED) 
55   CONTINUED:                                                      55 MILADY (impressed) You did it. An alliance with Buckingham. RICHELIEU The King left me no choice. Now that he's come of age, the boy believes he should rule France. Instead of me. 
Rochefort knows what this portends.    He steps from the corner. ROCHEFORT You're going to go through with ... everything? RICHELIEU (silences him with a glance) Yes. Everything. (to Milady) You're to leave for Calais at once. A ship called the Persephone will carry you to England. It sails Tuesday, midnight. I want Buckingham's signature next to mine before the King's birthday. Friday. MILADY Consider it done. 
RICHELIEU And doing so, shall earn you the gratitude of... a King. 
Richelieu's not talking about Louis.    He's talking about himself. 
CUT TO: 
56   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                56 
D'Artagnan leaps back from the door as it opens, head down, shuffles to join the retinue of jailers as they RETURN TO VIEW. Milady, unrecognizable behind her cloak, steps into the corridor, the retinue escorts her forward. D'Artagnan falls into place, eyes down, eager for escape. Just then: a hand slams down upon his shoulder. D'Artagnan looks up into the face of Captain Rochefort. 
57   EXT. BASTILLE - MILADY'S COACH                               57 Exiting. CUT TO: 
58   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                        58 
D'Artagnan lands with a thud at Richelieu's feet. Rochefort hisses: ROCHEFORT On your knees. 
When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a mighty kick. D'Artagnan scrambles into the correct posture of supplication. Rochefort continues: 
ROCHEFORT This is the boy who killed Jussac. D'ARTAGNAN I can explain that -- ROCHEFORT Silence! Rochefort punches d'Artagnan in the head, knocking him to the floor. The Cardinal frowns. 
RICHELIEU Rochefort. Violence solves nothing. Leave him to me. D'Artagnan reacts to the Cardinal's reasonable tone. Rochefort makes a sullen exit. The Cardinal smiles. RICHELIEU Please.    Sit down. D'Artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his first movie star. He sits in a finely brocaded chair, looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red. The Cardinal speaks, his manner casual, friendly. RICHELIEU How much did you hear? 
D'ARTAGNAN (busted) Not a word, Your Eminence. I stepped from my cell for a breath of air, and became lost in the corridors, it's dark as you know, but then I saw a light up ahead, the light over your door, I... (CONTINUED) 
58   CONTINUED:                                                     58 Richelieu smiles, dismisses d'Artagnan's tale with a wave of his hand. 
RICHELIEU You may have many talents, my young friend. But guile is not one of them. Do you have a name? 
D'ARTAGNAN D'Artagnan. 
RICHELIEU I've heard that name before.   Are you a Gascon? 
D'ARTAGNAN Yes, Your Eminence. RICHELIEU Tell me. What brought you to Paris. And don't say 'a horse.' D'ARTAGNAN I came to join the King's Musketeers. RICHELIEU Bad timing. 
D'ARTAGNAN So I've heard. RICHELIEU D'Artagnan, I like you. I could use a capable young man like you in my Guards.

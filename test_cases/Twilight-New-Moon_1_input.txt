A ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either side of the Rogue's face. Compassion? 
EDWARD (V.O.) We don't make spectacles of ourselves, or kill conspicuously, unless we want to die. 
Aro then slowly, dispassionately, RIPS THE ROGUE'S HEAD OFF. Two Volturi Guards (FELIX and DEMETRI) appear on either side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the Rogue limb from limb. Carlisle has to look away... 
INT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
-- as Bella spins on Edward -- 
BELLA Don't even -- talk about that. You can't let anyone hurt you. The Volturi or anyone else. 
EDWARD (sees she's worried) Who else would hurt me? 
BELLA You said there were more dangerous things out there than you. And I know you have at least one enemy -- 
OFF BELLA'S FACE - FLASHPOPS: 
-- ON ALL THREE EVIL VAMPIRES, James, VICTORIA, the dread- locked LAURENT (from "Twilight") 
-- CLOSE ON VICTORIA - fire-red hair, burgundy red eyes, feral, vicious grin (from "Twilight") 
BELLA (O.S.) You said she'd come after you for killing her mate. 
BACK ON BELLA AND EDWARD 
EDWARD Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice will see her coming. And she won't win. 
Bella looks up at him, pained. 
BELLA I hate that I can't protect you. 
He laughs, amused.   She's decidedly not. 
BELLA That was me being serious. 
EDWARD (kissing her face) I know. But you do protect me... (kisses her nose) From boredom... (kisses her lips) And loneliness... (in between kisses) You give me a reason to stay... un- dead. But it's... my job; to protect you... 
-- but he stops, smiles, hearing something in his mind -- EDWARD ... from everyone but my sister. 
-- as the door bursts open and Alice dances in. 
ALICE It's time it's time it's time! 
INT. CULLEN HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT 
Alice tugs Bella and Edward to the top of the landing, then skips down the stairs. They look down into -- 
THE LIVING ROOM - Hundreds of pink candles and rose-filled crystal bowls. ROSALIE, ESME, EMMETT, Carlisle, Jasper and Alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful. 
Bella would love to disappear, but Edward leads her down to -- 
THE LIVING ROOM -- where Esme and Carlisle hug Bella warmly. CARLISLE Sorry about all this.   We tried to rein Alice in. 
ESME Like that's even possible.   Happy birthday, Bella. 
FLASH!   Alice has snapped a picture of Bella with them. 
ALICE (re: camera) Found it in your bag.   Mind? 
Emmett moves to Edward's side.   Nudges him. 
EMMETT Dating an older woman.    Hot. 
Bella caught that.    Edward elbows him sharply to shut up. 
EMMETT What? 
Rosalie steps up.    Shoves a silver package at Bella. 
ROSALIE It's a necklace. Alice picked it out. 
She walks away, bored. Bella has to smile.     She sees Jasper across the room. They wave to each other. ALICE (aims the camera) Show me the love! 
Edward pulls Bella into an embrace, they look deeply into one another's eyes. FLASH! 
ALICE For your scrapbook.    Now open your presents! 
Alice drags Bella over to a table piled with elaborately wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates. 
BELLA Alice, I'm the only one who even eats cake. That thing could feed fifty. 
ALICE Hope you're hungry.    Here, this one's from Emmett. The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find an empty car-radio box. 
BELLA Um... thanks? 
EMMETT Already installed it in your truck.

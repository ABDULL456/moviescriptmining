DOMINO (lowering the gun a bit) Thieves? 
MARIACHI (nodding) No way. They were well-dressed men. I checked into the cheapest hotel in town, no money, nothing of value, except this guitar and maybe this coat, which they could have taken when I left my room, but they didn't. They were only interested in killing me. 
DOMINO (lifting the gun back up) So why do you come here? You want to get me killed? 
MARIACHI I need a place to stay until I figure this out. They've got me mixed up with someone else. 
DOMINO And you've never seen them before? Not even in another town? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MARIACHI (long pause) Are you saying they followed me, a mariachi, here? What for? 
DOMINO Maybe they hate your music. 
Mariachi stares at her expressionless. She stares back at him. 
DOMINO (CONT'D) Maybe you were singing in another town, they hated your voice, and now they're trying to kill you. 
MARIACHI Are you serious? 
DOMINO (nodding) Yes. 
She laughes. 
MARIACHI Are you going to help me, or am I gonna have to die on your porch? 
DOMINO I have a room upstairs. My room. Don't touch anything. I'll be up after awhile and we can call a friend of mine. 
Mariachi shakes her hand. 
MARIACHI Thank you. I'll never forget this. 
He tries to kiss her hand. She slides it away and effortlessly slaps him. 
DOMINO This way. 
He follows her to a doorway revealing an unlit staircase. When he enters, the darkness swallows him as she shuts the door behind him.

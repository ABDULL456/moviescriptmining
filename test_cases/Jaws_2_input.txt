INT. HELICOPTER - AERIAL VIEW 
A breathtaking view. The copter spotter looks down with naked eye and binoculars. 
COPTER SPOTTER Nothing from up here, Daisy. Over. 
CLOSE - HENDRICKS 
HENDRICKS (into walkie-talkie) False alarm. Must be this glare. 
ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY 
He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the happy hordes. Meadows nods "hello." 
VOICES Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up to your knees, yeah -- So come with me -- I'll go again. 
MEADOWS Beautiful day, Chief! 
A group of youngsters playing with Michael Brody's dinghy. 
They are hauling it toward the surf. 
BRODY Hey Mikey -- ! 
Michael turns as Brody trots toward him. 
BRODY You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son? 
MICHAEL I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it. 
BRODY Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds. 
MICHAEL Dad, the ponds are for old ladies. 
BRODY Just a favor for your old man. 
MICHAEL (confused) Sure, Dad. 
TV CREW - NEAR WATER 
TV cameramen are packing up their gear. For them it's a wrap 
REPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN 
Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copter Spotter's voice overloads the speaker. 
COPTER SPOTTER Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four! 
BOAT #7 - HENDRICKS 
Guns are up, heads turning everywhere. 
HENDRICKS (into walkie-talkie) Where -- ? 
COPTER SPOTTER Went under your -- There! 
The Coast Guard sonar operator spots it and pales. A slick black dorsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming area. 
SONAR OPERATOR Jesus Christ -- Shark! 
BEACH - BRODY 
Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying to transmit. 
BRODY Everybody out! Out of the water, please -- leave the water, please -- 
A lifeguard in a loft behind him begins blowing on his whistle. 
CLOSE - BRODY 
shouting hysterically. 
BRODY No whistles! No whistles! 
THE BEACH 
Dozens of bathers halfway out of the water, turn to see. More whistles, and they start toward shore. We hear panicky voices ad-libbing; "Shark," "Look Out," etc. The loudhailers sounding more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one person after another. Entire groups of people begin pulling toward shore, some of them obviously trying to control a growing hysteria in others. 
BOATS #6 AND #7 
are converging, heading toward the repellent line as if tracking an underwater shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent cordons and heading into the crowds. 
HOOPER'S BOAT

JOHN (CONT'D) (suddenly serious) But, hey... Listen, though. You got a high-ball glass...? Put a couple-three ice cubes in it, pour it up to the brim. That's the way I like it. 
FRANK I think I can do that. 
Mr. Givings eats his sandwich, watching his son. 
MRS. GIVINGS Oh, this is the most wonderful egg salad, April. You must tell me how you fix it. 
Frank hands John his high-ball glass. 
JOHN You a lawyer Frank? 
FRANK No, I'm not. 
JOHN I could use a lawyer. 
MR. GIVINGS John, let's not get started again about the lawyer. 
JOHN Pop, couldn't you just sit there and eat your wonderful egg salad, and quit horning in? 
Mr. Givings gives his son a level, warning look. 
JOHN (CONT'D) See, I've got a good many questions to ask and I'm willing to pay for the answers... Now, I don't need to be told that a man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally; that's obvious. 
Frank and April exchange a look. 
MRS. GIVINGS John, come and have a look out this fabulous picture window. 
Mrs. Givings gets up and goes to the window. 
JOHN If he hits her with it and kills her, that's a criminal case. 
MRS. GIVINGS Oh, look, the sun's coming out! 
JOHN If all he does is break the coffee table and give her a certain amount of aggravation and she decides to go to court over it, that's a civil case. 
MRS. GIVINGS Maybe we'll see a rainbow!   John, come have a look. 
JOHN Ma, how about doing everybody a favor? How about shutting up! 
April's face.   She's not smiling now. 
MR. GIVINGS Steady down, now. 
With her back to the room, Mrs. Givings closes her eyes. 
FRANK I can look into it.   Maybe recommend someone. 
John stares at Frank for any sign of condescension. 
JOHN So, what do you do, Frank? 
FRANK I work for Knox Business Machines. 
JOHN You design the machines? 
FRANK Nope. 
JOHN Make `em, sell `em, repair `em? 
MRS. GIVINGS All these questions. 
FRANK I sort of help sell them, I guess. I work in the office. Actually, it's sort of a stupid job. I mean there's nothing Â­ you know, interesting about it or anything. 
MRS. GIVINGS Oh, Frank... 
JOHN Whaddya do it for then? 
MR. GIVINGS Maybe Frank doesn't want to be questioned like this, son.

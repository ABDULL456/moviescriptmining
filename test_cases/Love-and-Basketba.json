{"train": "QUINCY Alley-oop, Dad. \nNona intercepts his pass. \nNONA Boy... \nShe points him back to his card.  Quincy scowls, starts writing again.  Nona scoops some frosting on her finger, holds it up. \nNONA (cont'd) New neighbors. \nZeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting off. \nZEKE See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught me, with the old fake and bake.  Had me thinking I was getting a sister who could burn. \nNona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss.  Quincy suddenly throws down his pencil in frustration. \nQUINCY I can't do this shit. \nZeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock. \nZEKE Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word? \nQUINCY (sighs, then) \"Can't\" should never be in a man's vocabulary. \nZEKE Why not? \nQUINCY Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man. \nZEKE That's right. \nNONA Zeke. \nZEKE What? (then) Oh, and, uh, don't say \"shit.\" \nNona just shakes her head. \nNONA We should head over. \nZEKE Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting. \nNONA With who? \nZEKE Business folks. \nNONA You just got back from a four game road trip. \nZEKE Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us. \nZeke grabs his keys. \nZEKE (cont'd) Later, Quincy. \nQUINCY Later, Dad. \nZeke exits.  Nona leans against the counter, concerned. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Mom? \nNONA What? \nQUINCY We still have to go? \nNONA (beat) Yeah. \nINT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCamille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes.  Monica and Quincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at each other.  A large bandage covers Monica's cheek.  Monica holds her card, Camille holds the cake. \nNONA ...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then... \nCAMILLE Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door. \nNONA (nods) Okay? \nCamille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair.  Monica moves her head. \nCAMILLE Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you. \nNONA It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook. \nQuincy looks up at his Mom, surprised.  She quickly hugs his face into her stomach.  Camille lights up. \nCAMILLE Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta. \nNONA You're a caterer? \nCAMILLE Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do. (then) Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about. \nQuincy snickers.  Nona quickly changes the subject. \nNONA You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house. \nCAMILLE Really?  Well, come on, then. \nMonica punches her in the leg. \nLENA Ow! \nLena yanks Monica's head back as Camille enters, carrying a yellow dress on a hanger.  Monica sees it and her face falls. \nMONICA Ah, Mom. \nCAMILLE I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage. \nMonica sulks.  Lena cackles in her ear.  Camille has to laugh. \nCAMILLE (cont'd) Child, pick up your lip. \nMONICA I hate it. \nCAMILLE Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear? \nMONICA Pants. \nCamille rubs her temples, then hangs the dress on the door. \nCAMILLE (to Lena) When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth? \nLENA Are you okay? \nCAMILLE I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day. \nJust then, Nathan enters.  He holds up two dress shirts as if it were a matter of life and death. \nNATHAN Which one for tomorrow? \nCAMILLE The blue. \nNATHAN You sure? \nCamille nods.  Nathan looks at both of them, then: \nNATHAN (cont'd) Can you iron both tonight just in case? \nCAMILLE (beat) Okay. \nNATHAN Thanks, sweetheart. \nHe kisses her on the cheek, hands her the two shirts and crosses out.  Monica just watches.  Beat, then Camile turns back to her daughters. \nCAMILLE The boy next door is riding with you to school so you'll know somebody your first day. (to Lena) Hurry so she can go to sleep. \nMonica reacts, surprised.  Camille leaves.  Lena puts the comb back to Monica's hair.  Beat, then: \nMONICA Make it look nice, kay. \nINT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nBasketball posters, \"Clippers\" and USC memorabilia, a basketball globe light. \nQuincy lays tucked in bed, eyes wide open, listening to his parents MAKING LOVE.  The sounds bring a smile to his face. \nQuincy climbs out of bed, wearing underwear.  He moves to his window, sees Monica through her window directly across from his.  Her eyes are closed as Lena braids her hair.  Quincy kneels down, rests his arms on the window sill, and watches. EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - MORNING \nQuincy sits atop his BMX bike in front of Monica's house.  A basketball is tucked under his arm. \nMonica emerges, walking her banana-seater.  She is looking cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons.  A basketball sits in her back basket. \nQuincy is taken aback, stares at her. \nQUINCY You wanna be my girl? \nMonica blinks in surprise.  She thinks for a moment. \nMONICA What do I have to do? \nQUINCY I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers. \nMONICA I don't like flowers. \nQUINCY Oh. \nMONICA How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them. \nQUINCY Kay. \nMONICA Okay. \nAn awkward beat between the new couple.  Finally -- \nQUINCY I think we gotta kiss now. \nMONICA For how long? \nQUINCY Five seconds. \nThe two glance around, then climb off their bikes and walk to the secluded area between their two houses. \nREFEREE Taunting. \nMONICA Taunting?! \nCOACH HISERMAN Sub! \nMONICA Man, you suck! \nThe referee whips back around, whistle in mouth.  Coach Hiserman grabs her arm and pulls her off the court. \nCOACH HISERMAN Sit down and shut up. \nMonica slams down in a chair, sweat pouring, hands clenched. Her mom watches from the stands, completely embarrassed.  The brother in the doorway turns, leaves. \nMonica looks up at the clock.  SIX MINUTES LEFT IN THE THIRD QUARTER. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - LATE DAY \nMonica, still benched, sits slumped in her chair, her sweats on, her face dry.  She glances up at the clock.  TWENTY SECONDS LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.  Her team's up by SIX. \nHer teammates dribble out the clock.  The BUZZER SOUNDS and they dance across the floor.  Monica looks up in the stands. COACH SUMMIT IS GONE. \nINT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK \nCamille, now forty-three, stands at the stove stirring a pot of gumbo.  Lena, 21, and pretty, stands next to her, holding a handful of plates and silverware. \nCAMILLE ...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour. \nLENA But you use potato? \nCamille nods as they cross into: \nINT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAt the table, Monica is in mid-conversation with her dad. Camille and Lena start setting the table. \nMONICA Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me. \nNATHAN And what am I supposed to say to the man? \nMONICA The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench. \nNATHAN You lost your head. \nMONICA I was just showing emotion. \nCAMILLE So that means it's alright for you to act like that? \nLENA (to Monica) What'd you do? \nMONICA (dismissive) nothing. \nCAMILLE I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing. \nMONICA I won't.  I'm a lesbian. \nLena chokes on her drink, cracks up. \nCAMILLE That's not funny \nMONICA Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron... \nCAMILLE Watch your mouth. \nNathan quickly jumps in, tries to clean things up. \nNATHAN Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball. \nMONICA (taken aback) What? \nNATHAN You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality. \nMONICA The coach from USC is going to be at the championship. \nNATHAN I know.  But chances are... \nMONICA Chances are there's still a chance. \nNathan nods.  She can always soften her dad, but not her mom. \nCAMILLE If you'd just listen for once, you'd realize you have a lot more going for yourself.  You're smart, you'd be pretty if you put a comb to your head.  I mean, why walk around with your hair looking like \"whodunit\"...? \nAs her mom nags on, Monica looks out the window. \nOUTSIDE, QUINCY and a GIRL lean against a car parked at the curb, slobbing each other down. \nJust shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is a brother who drank his chocolate milk.  HE IS ALSO THE BROTHER WHO WAS WATCHING MONICA'S GAME FROM THE GYM DOORWAY. \nMonica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears... \nEXT. MCCALL HOUSE - SAME TIME \nZEKE I don't wanna hurt your feelings. \nQUINCY You don't wanna hurt your back. \nZEKE (smiles) Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late. \nQUINCY You work too hard, Pop. \nZEKE Let's hope I can say the same about you one day. \nQuincy watches his dad move toward the doors, stopping once to give an autograph.  Zeke passes Monica, entering. \nMONICA Hey, Mr. M. \nZEKE Hey, Miss Baller. \nHe exits.  Monica approaches Quincy. \nMONICA Way to hoop. \nQUINCY I know this.  What do you want? \nMONICA A ride home. \nQUINCY Your legs don't look broke. \nMONICA Look, big head, I'll be at your car. \nQUINCY Guess \"please\" would be a stretch. \nMONICA (dryly) Please. \nINT. QUINCY'S JEEP - NIGHT \nSilence as Quincy wheels his Jeep Wrangler toward home. Monica sits in the passenger seat, basketball in lap.  She pulls Shawnee's note from her pocket.  Quincy glances it over. \nQUINCY What's that? \nMONICA Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you. \nQUINCY (thinks) Big-ass titties? \nMonica shoots him a disgusted look.  Quincy reaches out. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Give it here. \nMonica leans away, reads aloud. \nMONICA \"Q.  I think you are so fine and I've been wanting to get with you.  Let me take you to the Spring Dance and I promise I'll leave you satisfied.\" \nMonica laughs in disbelief. \nMONICA (cont'd) What a ho. \nQUINCY Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me. \nMONICA She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail. \nQUINCY And? \nMONICA And?  She's not saying, \"I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better,\" she's saying, \"I wanna bone.\" \nQUINCY So she's honest. \nMONICA Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything. \nQUINCY Didn't know you cared so much. \nMONICA I don't. \nQUINCY So who you going to the dance with, Spalding? \nMONICA Who's Spalding? \nQuincy looks down at the SPALDING BASKETBALL in her lap and cracks up.  Monica glares. \nMONICA (cont'd) Fuck you, Quincy. \nQUINCY See, that's why you ain't getting recruited. \nMONICA Who said I'm not getting recruited? \nQUINCY Your hot-ass temper. \nMonica points to the scar on her cheek. \nMONICA I'm not the one who put this scar here. \nQUINCY God, here we go. \nMONICA When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose. \nQuincy turns, faces her. \nNONA I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him... \nZEKE I have. \nA beat. \nNONA You said you'd think about going back to get your degree. \nZEKE No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my \"bullshit\" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold. \nLivid, Nona pulls off her gold bracelet, throws it at him. \nNONA Fine, then how many nights home is that? \nZEKE Keep your voice down. \nShe grabs a pair of gold earrings from her jewelry box, nails him. \nNONA How about now?  I got a week yet? \nINT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nQuincy lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, as his parents continue to have it out. \nHe rolls out of bed, pulls on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt. He moves to his window, pulls it open and climbs out... \nEXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - CONTINUOUS \nQuincy crosses the grass to Monica's window, knocks quietly. \nLong beat, then Monica sleepily stumbles to her window, wearing boxers and a tank top.  She pushes it open and Quincy pulls himself through... \nINT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNow a routine, Monica tosses Quincy one of her pillows and blankets, then crawls back into bed. He lays out on the floor and closes his eyes.  Monica casts a long, sleepy glance at him, then drifts back to sleep. \nDISSOLVE TO: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - LATE DAY \nPosters of Magic line three walls.  A hand-made collage of \nfemale college and Olympic ball-players fills the fourth. The only real \"soft\" touch is the teddy bear laying on the pillow. \nMonica sits on the floor between Lena's legs, as Lena puts Monica's hair in cornrows. \nLENA That too tight? \nMONICA No. \nLENA Mom's going to hate it. \nMONICA Always on my ass, anyway. \nLENA Like you don't give her a hard time. \nMONICA Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you... \nLena yanks Monica's head back. \nMONICA (cont'd) Ow!!! \nLENA You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind. \nMONICA No one's forcing her. \nLENA Just try and chill a little bit, alright. \nMonica doesn't answer.  Lena yanks her head back again. \nMONICA Ow!!!  Okay! \nThey crack up. \nLENA So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet? \nMONICA (sarcastically) Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker. \nLENA I found you someone. \nMONICA Found?  I'm not some charity case. \nLENA I know... \nMONICA Mom tell you to do this? \nLENA No. \nMONICA Damn, Lena... (then) Who is he? \nLENA This brother from my college. \nMONICA He's in college? \nLENA And he's fine, girl. \nFourth quarter.  One minute left.  Cougars down three. \nMonica dribbles down court, bouncing with confidence as her opponent plays her tight. \nMonica zips a no-look pass to a teammate, who lays it up. Quincy punches one of his friends - \"Oh shit!\"  She is having the game of her life. \nOn the defensive end, Monica steals the ball.  She drives the length of the court, lays it up between two defenders.  The crowd is hyped. \nTwenty seconds left, up by one.  Monica hounds the opposing guard as she brings up the ball. Monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose.  As she goes for the ball, a WHISTLE. \nREFEREE Reaching in, number thirty-two.  One-and- one. \nBoos fill the gym.  Monica's eyes widen. \nMONICA No! \nAnger rushes through her as she starts for the ref. \nMONICA (cont'd) That's bullsh--! \nCOACH HISERMAN Monica! \nMonica catches herself, turns the word \"shit\" into a frustrated yell as she quickly moves away from the ref. \nMonica lines up for the free-throw, clenching her fists.  The girl hits the first one.  Then, she hits the second. \nWith ten seconds left, down by one, Monica drives down court and throws up a prayer.  EVERYONE IS ON THEIR FEET AS THE BALL SPINS AROUND THE RIM.  AND THEN...IT POPS OUT.  An opposing player grabs the rebound and Monica has no choice but to foul her. \nMonica has just fouled out.  She walks to her bench and drops down.  She buries her face in a towel and sobs. \nThe buzzer goes off.  Cougars lose. \nQuincy stares at Monica, feeling almost as bad as she does. \nDISSOLVE TO: INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMonica sits slumped on her bed in a bathrobe, as Lena stands \nin front of her, putting the finishing touches on Monica's \nmake-up. \nLENA \nMight help if you didn't look so evil. \nMONICA I don't even want to go. \nShe steps back, looks at her work. \nLENA Mom! \nBeat, then Camille enters. \nLENA (cont'd) Talk to me. \nCamille stares at her daughter, taken aback by how great she looks. \nCAMILLE Go in my top drawer and get my pearls. \nLena exits.  Monica still looks miserable. \nCAMILLE (cont'd) You okay? \nMonica shrugs. \nCAMILLE (cont'd) Well, can you promise me one thing? \nMONICA What? \nCAMILLE Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that? \nMonica takes this in as Lena returns with Camille's pearls. \nLENA Here. \nCamille puts them around Monica's neck.  Monica looks back at her. \nMONICA You really think I look beautiful? \nCamille smiles at her daughter, nods.  Monica touches the pearls. \nINT. CRENSHAW GYM - NIGHT \nAn R&B song jams through the speakers, filling the dance floor with high school kids in suits and dresses. \nIn the middle of the floor, Quincy gets his groove on with his date, Shawnee.  She dances so provocatively, there is no mistaking what she has in mind for later. \nOver at the doors, Monica enters with her college date, JASON, 21, and fine.  Heads turn in surprise.  Monica feels the stares, shifts nervously. \nJASON Can I take your coat? \nMONICA You're cold? \nJASON (cont'd) Just don't jet while I'm gone and leave a glass slipper behind. \nMonica's face lights up.  Jason smiles. \nJASON (cont'd) There we go. \nHe crosses away to the refreshment table.  Monica smiles wider, leans back in her chair with her legs splayed.  She catches herself and quickly crosses them. \nA couple of guys pass by and check her out.  Monica smiles wider.  Quincy steps up, holding two cups of punch. \nQUINCY Hey. \nMONICA Hey. \nQUINCY You having fun? \nMONICA Yeah. \nQUINCY Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. (beat) So who is this clown? \nMONICA He ain't Spalding. \nQUINCY Guess not. \nMONICA So you took Shawnee, huh? \nThe DJ puts on \"Make It Last Forever\" by Keith Sweat. Couples move to the dance floor. \nQUINCY (embarrassed) You know, it was late and she asked... \nJASON You want to dance? \nJason stands behind her chair.  Monica smiles shyly. \nMONICA Sure. \nJason puts down her cup of punch, takes her hand, leads her to the dance floor. \nQuincy just shakes his head, then crosses to his table, grabs Shawnee's hand. \nQUINCY C'mon. \nHe pulls Shawnee to the middle of the floor. \nANGLE ON \nMonica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax. \nJason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in closer.  Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands down his neck.  The heat from bodies grows. \nMonica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each other's eyes.  They start to look away but find they can't. Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel each other.  Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight. \nMonica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his hands lower down Shawnee's back.  The music continues... \nINT. JASON'S CAR - NIGHT \nJason and Monica are parked up on Mulholland Drive.  LL Cool J's \"I Need Love\" plays on the tape deck. \nJason has his arm around Monica, ready to make his move. \nMONICA (rattling) Freshman year, my free throw percentage was fifty-one percent, cause I was shooting it like a jump shot. \nJason leans in, kisses her bare shoulder. \nMONICA (cont'd) Um...but then sophomore year I was shooting seventy-five percent from the line. \nJason kisses her neck. \nMONICA (cont'd) ...uh, by keeping my feet set and really following through. \nJason goes in for the slam dunk.  Kisses Monica on the lips. It's the first time she's really been kissed.  Jason pulls away, smiles. \nJASON That was nice. \nMONICA Uh-huh. \nJASON Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself... \nJason leans in.  Monica closes her eyes, and they kiss some more.  Monica tries to follow his practiced lips. \nJason's tongue slides in and their bodies slide down.  His hand moves across her breast.  Monica's eyes pop open. \nMONICA Wait... \nJASON Shh.  It's okay. \nNaive and inexperienced, Monica shuts her eyes tight. \nDISSOLVE TO: E WRIGHT HOUSE -NIGHT \nJason's car pulls off, Monica slowly moves to her front door. \nShe looks in the living room window.  Her mom is asleep in a chair, trying to wait up. \nMONICA I know, right? \nBut they both want more.  They lean in, kiss deeply.  They fall back on the grass.  And kiss.  And kiss. \nSuddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up.  Quincy follows, instantly apologetic.  Monica stares at him, then to his surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with her finger. \nQuincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie.  He nervously unbuttons his shirt.  He fumbles with the last two buttons. \nMonica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self- conscious.  Quincy can't keep his eyes off her. \nHe pulls off his pants.  Monica glances down and her eyes widen.  She looks scared to death.  Quincy smiles softly, leans in and gently kisses her.  She relaxes.  They lay down. \nQuincy reaches into his pants for a condom.  His hands shake as he puts it on.  They stare at each other as he moves on top of her. \nQuincy pushes inside her.  She flinches back in pain.  Quincy immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes. \nQUINCY (softly) You want to stop? \nMonica shakes her head.  Quincy pushes inside again.  He looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her tears... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nFOOTAGE.  1988-89 NBA Finals.  Game SEVEN.  The Lakers against the Pistons.  With seconds left, up by three, Magic guards Isiah Thomas.  They collide, no foul is called and the Lakers win their second championship. FADE IN: \nTITLE CARD: \"THIRD QUARTER\" \nINT. USC - CAMPUS GYM - MORNING \nChampionship banners hang from the ceiling. \nTWELVE YOUNG WOMEN sit on the first two rows of bleachers. The eight upperclassmen kick back in the second row, comfortable, confident.  Monica and the three other freshmen sit in front of them, jiggling nervously. \nCOACH MILLER stands in front of the team. \nCOACH MILLER I don't know some of you very well yet, and you don't know me because I'm still being nice to you. \nLaughter from the upperclassmen. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) But my philosophy is simple. Hard work and sacrifice. There's a lot of basketball history and pride here at USC, but just putting on the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a great player.  Hard work and sacrifice makes you a great player.  What you were doesn't matter anymore.  For the first time in your life, you won't be the best. You'll be going up against women that are bigger and stronger and better than you ever imagined.  So the question is, how will you respond?  Well, your answer better be hard work and sacrifice because that's the only way you're gonna make it through.  Vince Lombardi preached it and I teach it, \"There is only one way to succeed at anything and that is to give everything.\" \nCoach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in. Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions. Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) A few simple rules.  Eleven o'clock curfew, no exceptions.  Always be on time, no exceptions.  Attend every class, no exceptions.  No drugs, no alcohol, no getting pregnant.  And finally, respect yourselves, respect your coaches and respect your teammates, right Sidra? \nSIDRA, senior point guard, nods from the second row. \nSIDRA That's right, Coach. \nCOACH MILLER By the end of this year some of you will hate me... \nThe upperclassmen crack up. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) Some of you will want to go home... \nUPPERCLASSMEN (cat-calling) Cree! \nCREE, junior forward, ducks her head sheepishly.  Coach Miller smiles. \nCOACH MILLER But I guarantee you, if you work hard and sacrifice, all of you will be better basketball players and better people. \nMonica nods, accepting the challenge. \nEXT. TRACK - EARLY MORNING \nIt's cold, it's dark.  It's six a.m. \nThe team pounds down the track, pushing through a two-mile run.  Monica and her freshman teammate/roommate SHAYLA, 18, breathe heavily from the back of the pack. \nFrom the sideline. \nCOACH MILLER Let's go, freshmen, you're getting spanked! \nMonica sucks it up, runs faster.  She reaches the middle of the pack, then runs out of gas.  She drops back to the rear. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) Monica, I'm putting you on my Wizard of Oz team.  No brains, no courage and no heart! \nINT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING \nDefensive drills.  One by one, players crouch low and move backwards down the sideline.  ZVETTE, a junior guard, hustles through the drill. \nCOACH MILLER Way to work, Zvette. \nMonica starts the drill. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) Get lower, Monica, move your feet. \nMonica grimaces as she squats lower. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) I said lower! \nCoach Miller stops her, squats down low beside her. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Hold up... \nMONICA All's fair in love and basketball. Strip. \nQuincy pulls off his shirt.  Monica moves back into position. Quincy drops down low.  Monica fakes, gets him to leave his feet.  She slips under him and scores.  She laughs. \nMONICA (cont'd) Too bad you got your mama's height, huh. \nQuincy pulls off his sweats, leaving him in just drawers. Monica takes in the view as she moves back into position. \nShe holds the ball out, taunting.  Quincy pretends to reach for it, but grabs her breast instead. \nQUINCY Oh, my bad. \nShe drives.  Quincy just steps out of the way and lets her score.  Monica snatches the ball off the floor. \nMONICA Yo, where's the \"D\"? \nQUINCY Right here. \nMonica turns, finds Quincy butt-naked.  He moves her against the wall and kisses her.  Monica drops the ball, wraps her arms around him.  She smiles. \nMONICA I won. \nQUINCY I wanted you to. \nGame over.  They hit it. INT.

UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT - GAMPEL PAVILION - NIGHT \nSidra crashes to the floor, immediately grabs at her ankle. Monica rises off the bench... \nCUT TO: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT \nTelevisions hang from every corner, broadcasting various games. \nZeke and Quincy sit at a bar.  Quincy is still hyped from his game. \nQUINCY ...up and under between two defenders, with the left hand.  That's gotta make SportsCenter. \nZeke just nods as the Bartender/Owner crosses over.  He is an ex-ballplayer named TERRY. \nQuincy glances at her half-hidden glass. \nQUINCY Last time I remember you drinking was when Marvin Gaye died. \nNo response from Nona. \nQUINCY (cont'd) This about Dad? \nNONA Guess he talked to you. \nQUINCY Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out. \nNONA (beat) Whose truth are you talking about? \nQUINCY Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family. \nShe doesn't respond.  Quincy studies her. \nQUINCY (cont'd) I mean, you believe him, right? \nNona sits silent, humiliated. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Mom? \nNONA Just...leave it alone. \nQUINCY This is just about money, you know that. \nNONA Quincy, please... \nQUINCY I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's? \nNONA Guess I should have been telling your father. \nQUINCY So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie. \nNona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him. \nConfused, Quincy opens it.  HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS: \nZeke outside a party.  IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a young woman.  IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS.  AND YET ANOTHER, they climb into his car. \nQUINCY (cont'd) What...what's this? \nNONA I hired somebody.  How pathetic is that? After all his late nights and \"meetings\" and I still needed proof. \nQuincy just stares at the photos. \nNONA (cont'd) I used to think I was lucky just to be married to Zeke McCall, but I'm too tired. \nQuincy looks stricken, but he moves to Nona, comforts her as she cries... EXT. TRACK - NIGHT \nMonica sits with a devastated Quincy, high up in the bleachers.  In the distance, the clock-tower glows 10:50. \nQUINCY Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something... \nMONICA I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you. \nQUINCY What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy. (then) And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense... \nMONICA She understands. \nQUINCY He even had me wanting to play for the \"Clippers.\"  Man, how stupid am I. \nMONICA You're not stupid. \nQUINCY I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this... \nMonica puts her arms around him.  They sit there, quiet. Monica glances up at the clock tower.  She reacts.  Quincy notices. \nQUINCY (cont'd) What? \nMONICA Nothing. (beat) Why don't we walk to my dorm? \nQUINCY I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright? \nMONICA I...can't. \nQUINCY Why not? \nMONICA Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up. \nQuincy looks at her, almost in shock. \nQUINCY Didn't realize you were watching the clock. \nMONICA I mean, I can stay a few more minutes. \nQUINCY Nah.  Don't sweat it. \nMONICA Quincy... \nQUINCY For real.  I should be alone, anyway. \nThe female players continue to celebrate as they undress. \nMAEYEN Shoot, you see that crowd?  We need to be playing in the Sports Arena. \nKELLI Hell yeah. \nThey give each other a pound. \nLisa looks at Monica, standing in her shorts and sports bra. \nLISA Oh damn, Mon. \nMONICA What? \nLISA I think ol' girl took out your chi-chis with that charge. \nThe women break into laughter.  Monica smiles. \nMONICA Kiss my ass. \nSANDRA Nah, I think she took that too. \nMONICA Sandra, please, last time you chest- bumped me, it took you three tries. \nMore laughter.  Monica looks over at Toni, sitting quietly at the bench. \nMONICA (cont'd) Yo, T, why you so quiet? \nTONI (beat) I don't want to go play overseas. \nDORA I thought you were hyped about going to Portugal next year. \nTONI It's never gonna be like this.  Playing in front of my family, hanging out with my girls.  Probably not even a McDonald's. \nSANDRA Nah, there's always a McDonald's. \nSIDRA Least you got an offer.  My agent's still looking. \nCREE (to Lisa) What about you? \nLISA (beat) Maybe it'd be worth it if I knew some day I could come back here and play.  But for right now, it's law school. \nCOACH MILLER (O.S.) Monica. \nMonica turns, sees Coach Miller standing in her office doorway.  She motions for her.  Monica heads over.  Sidra watches. \nINT. COACH MILLER'S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER \nTrophies, plaques and photos fill every empty space. \nCoach Miller sits behind her desk.  Monica stands before her. \nCOACH MILLER You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart. \nMONICA Thanks. \nCOACH MILLER We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again. \nMONICA (confused) I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game. \nCOACH MILLER You want the job or not? \nRealization finally hits. \nMONICA Yeah.  Yes. \nMonica looks at Coach Miller completely thrown. \nCOACH MILLER What? \nMONICA It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me. \nCOACH MILLER You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry. (then) Go get dressed. \nMonica nods, crosses out. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAs Monica walks back to her teammates, Coach Miller steps into the doorway. \nCOACH MILLER Sidra. \nSidra looks at Monica as she rises, crosses over.  Monica avoids her eyes as they pass.  Sidra enters the office and the door closes. \nSHAYLA Yo sis, what's going on? \nBeat, then Monica smiles. \nSMASH CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBlack folks pack the cramped houseparty, bumping to a phat \nhip hop joint. \nSIDRA (O.S.) Monica. \nMonica looks over, sees Sidra standing in the doorway.  There is no escaping this confrontation.  She glances at Quincy, then crosses over.  Quincy turns, sees her disappear back inside. \nINT. HOUSEPARTY - CONTINUOUS \nMONICA What's up? \nSIDRA Just wanted to say good game. \nMONICA But? \nSIDRA No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge. \nMONICA Thanks. \nSIDRA But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock. \nMonica shakes her head.  An awkward silence. \nSIDRA (cont'd) I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed. \nMONICA I know. \nSIDRA Just one word of advice for next season. \nMONICA What's that? \nSIDRA Never let a freshman take your spot. \nSidra turns and walks away. \nEXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS \nQuincy takes one long drink from his cup.  KERRY, 20, and spandexed, stands directly in front of him, flirtatiously. \nKERRY Excuse me. \nQUINCY Excuse me. \nHe steps aside as she tries to work the keg.  Nothing comes out.  She nods at his cup, smiles. \nKERRY If that's the last beer, you and I are sharing. \nShayla glances over as Quincy pumps the keg a couple of times.  Kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up. \nKERRY (cont'd) I like watching you play.  Number twenty- two. \nQUINCY Guess you didn't see the game. \nQuincy knows he should blow her off, but he's digging the attention.  He hands her back her cup. \nQUINCY (cont'd) What's your name? \nKERRY Kerry. \nQUINCY Q. \nKERRY I know. \nANGLE ON \nMonica looks over at Quincy and sees him talking to the hoochie.  The girl looks too damn comfortable.  Monica moves back outside. \nKERRY (cont'd) I'll see you.  Q-man. \nShe swishes past Monica.  Shayla \"accidentally\" bumps her. Kerry glares. \nMONICA Who was that? \nQUINCY Nobody. \nMONICA Who's nobody? \nQUINCY Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go? \nMONICA You want to go talk? \nQUINCY Not really. \nHe leans in, kisses her drunkenly.  She pulls away. \nMONICA We could finish what we were talking about last night. \nQuincy kisses her again. \nMONICA (cont'd) Q... (pushing him off) Quincy, quit.  You're drunk. \nThey fall silent. \nQUINCY You know what, I'm just gonna crash. \nMONICA (agitated) Fine...Maybe I'll come by later. \nAs Monica signs her autograph, a tall woman carrying a matching sports bag approaches.  She is LUISA, Spanish, 33. \nLUISA (thick Spanish accent) Monica.  What is up? \nMONICA Oye, Luisa. \nMonica hands the girls her autograph and they run off. \nLUISA Large game, no? \nMONICA Si.  Large game. \nThey duck into the arena. \nINT. ARENA - LOCKER ROOM - LATE DAY \nPaint peels off the walls.  Windows are broken overhead. \nMonica sits alone at her locker, taping her own ankles.  Her TEN TEAMMATES, all from Spain, sit on the surrounding benches, talking and joking among themselves in Spanish. Monica is clearly an outsider. \nCOACH PARRA, Spanish, late 40's, enters. \nCOACH PARRA Silenco! \nThe women immediately stop talking.  COACH PARRA gives an animated, impassioned speech in Spanish.  Monica doesn't understand a word, just continues taping her ankles. \nCoach Parra finishes and the women clap, pumped up. Monica turns to Luisa, seated next to her on the bench. \nMONICA What did he say? \nLUISA He say to give the ball to you. \nINT. ARENA - NIGHT \nThe arena is PACKED with a raucous European crowd, chanting and waving signs - the love their women's basketball. \nMonica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her shorts.  The uniforms are old-style - polyester and tight. Her club's name is stitched on the front, \"GODELLA\". \nAs she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her game face.  Standing opposite her, playing for the opposing Italian club is Sidra, HER RIVAL FROM USC. \nSIDRA Well, what do you know. \nMONICA What's up, Sidra. \nSIDRA I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house. \nMONICA How do you say \"you're dreaming\" in Italian? \nThey move into position.  The ball is tossed up.  Italy winds the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra. \nMonica hounds her as she brings up the ball.  Sidra shoves her off and to the floor, and scores.  No whistle.  Women's pro ball is at a whole other level.  Bigger, better, tougher. \nThe ball is passed in to Monica.  She drives down court, goes up for a lay up.  An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air, taking out her legs.  Monica crashes on the hardwood. \nA whistle.  Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word. Without emotion. \nINT. SPAIN - NIGHTCLUB - LATE NIGHT \nA huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music.  In the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of the party. \nIn a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching the festivities.  A large trophy sits on the table. \nSIDRA Can you take that damn thing off the table. \nMONICA You mean my championship trophy?  My bad. \nMonica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm around it.  Sidra shakes her head. \nSIDRA Still a cocky bitch. \nMonica laughs.  She downs her drink, motions to the waiter. \nMONICA Uno mas, por favor. \nThe waiter nods. \nMONICA (cont'd) Last I heard, you were playing in Sweden. \nSIDRA Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me. \nMONICA Just like that? \nSIDRA Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years. \nMONICA How's that been? \nSIDRA It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad \"The American\" was making more money. (smiles) I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball. \nMonica laughs as the waiter brings her drink.  She tries to pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away. \nSIDRA (cont'd) Most of us don't win championships our first year overseas. \nMONICA Please, I went through the same drama as everybody else.  I mean, the first four months, only person I could talk to was this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words of English from watching old \"Dif'rent Strokes\" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to tell her if she said, \"What you talking bout, Willis?\" one more time, I was gonna kick her ass. \nZEKE Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been? \nNONA Happy.  And he won't want to see you. \nNona walks over to a MAN standing nearby.  He puts an arm around her and they move down the hall.  Zeke watches for a beat, then pulls open Quincy's door, steps inside. \nINT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nQuincy lays in the bed.  His knee is bandaged and propped up by pillows.  He stares out the window. \nZEKE Hey, son. \nQuincy turns, sees his father.  He turns back to the window. \nZEKE (cont'd) Well, you made SportsCenter. \nQUINCY What do you want? \nZEKE Came by to check on you. \nQUINCY After five years. \nZEKE Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom. \nQUINCY Look, I'm busy. \nZEKE I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself. \nQUINCY I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget? \nZEKE No. \nQUINCY Good. \nZEKE Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me. \nQUINCY And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  \"I told you so?\" \nZEKE You want me to fuck off? \nQUINCY Yeah. \nZEKE Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something. \nSilence.  Then. \nZEKE (cont'd) You're a better ballplayer than I ever was.  But you got a lot of other things going for you.  You're smart.  I always felt...I always knew that you could do anything you wanted.  You want to be a ballplayer, be a ballplayer.  Just know you ain't like everybody else on that court.  You ain't like I was.  You got options.  That's all I ever tried to show you. \nQUINCY You're still trying to tell me what I should and shouldn't do.  How come you couldn't be the man you kept trying to make me? \nZeke stares at his son, wishing he could satisfy him with an answer. \nZEKE I just couldn't \nWith nothing left to say, Zeke pulls open the door and leaves.  Quincy stares at the door long after it closes. \nDISSOLVE TO: INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nA NURSE enters, carrying a bouquet of flowers.  She moves \npast the empty bed, puts them on a table already overflowing \nwith flowers.  She pulls open the blinds and light floods the room.  She crosses back out. \nA toilet flush.  Beat, then Quincy slowly hops out of the bathroom, scratching his bare ass through the opening of his gown. \nVOICE (O.S.) And I thought this was gonna be awkward. \nQuincy whips around and is shocked to see Monica standing there, laughing.  She has clearly made an effort with her appearance. \nQUINCY Monica? \nHe stumbles.  Monica quickly goes to him, catches his arm before he falls. \nMONICA I'm sorry. \nQuincy stares at her, completely thrown.  It's been five years.  An awkward beat. \nMONICA (cont'd) So, how you doing? \nQUINCY Alright.  I heard you were in Spain. \nMONICA I was. (smiling) I see your peach fuzz finally grew in. \nQuincy rubs his goatee self-consciously. \nQUINCY Just something I'm trying. \nMONICA No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool. \nQUINCY Thanks. \nQuincy tries to adjust his footing and flinches in pain. \nMONICA Fiance.  Wow.  Congratulations. \nKYRA Thank you. \nMONICA I didn't know.  Wow.  That's great. (then) Well...I should go. \nQUINCY It means a lot that you came by. \nKYRA Yes, we appreciate that. \nMONICA Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything. \nQUINCY Thanks. \nMonica forces one last smile, pulls open the door and leaves. \nINT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nMonica walks down the hall, shell-shocked. INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE DAY \nCamille moves between the counter and the stove, whipping up \na couple pecan pies.  Monica enters. \nMONICA \nHey. \nCAMILLE Hi. \nMONICA Need any help? \nCAMILLE I can manage. \nMonica nods and moves to the barstool. \nCAMILLE (cont'd) Your sister's bringing the baby over. You should try to be here. \nMONICA Yeah.  Can't wait to see him (she falls silent, then) I just saw Quincy. \nCAMILLE How is he? \nMONICA Engaged. \nCAMILLE To that stewardess? \nMONICA Yeah, you met her? \nCAMILLE His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me. \nMONICA Maybe she is. \nCamille looks up, studies Monica for a moment. \nCAMILLE I thought you were over him. \nMonica shrugs. \nMONICA So what do I do? \nCAMILLE Find out where they're registered and send them a gift. \nMONICA (disgusted) Whatever. \nCAMILLE You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask? \nMONICA I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy. \nCAMILLE Don't curse. \nMONICA There you go. \nCAMILLE What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too \"prissy\" for you, too bad. \nMonica stares at her mother.  There's no going back. \nMONICA So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a \"dumb\" jump shot? \nCAMILLE You're the one always turning your nose up at me. \nMONICA No I don't. \nCAMILLE Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say. \nMONICA I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume. \nCAMILLE What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you? \nMONICA Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not. \nCAMILLE So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume? \nMonica is busted.  It takes her a moment to come back. \nKyra sits on the toilet, taking a pee.  Quincy slams the curtain closed. \nQUINCY Damn, girl. \nKYRA What? \nQUINCY I don't wanna see that. \nKYRA Get used to it, babe. \nShe flushes.  Quincy steps out, grabs a towel.  A long scar runs across his knee cap. \nQUINCY Brother's gonna have to start locking doors. \nKyra laughs as she buttons up her flight attendant's uniform. They cross into: \nINT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nKyra packs up a suitcase. \nQUINCY So how long is this trip? \nKYRA Four days. \nQuincy nods. \nKYRA (cont'd) So are you going to be the kind of husband who won't let his wife work? \nQUINCY Nah. \nKYRA (playfully) Why not? \nQUINCY You might be the only one with a job. \nKYRA Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it. \nQUINCY Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what? \nKYRA To do what you love. \nQUINCY I don't know sometimes. \nKYRA You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse. \nQUINCY (beat) A horse? \nKYRA Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive. (then) You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on. \nShe smiles, gives him a kiss, moves back to her packing.  Off Quincy: \nINT. BANK - DAY \nMonica sits at her desk in a blouse and skirt, punching numbers into the computer.  A man sits down in the chair opposite her.  Monica glances up.  It's her father. \nNATHAN Hey, munchkin. \nMONICA Dad.  What are you doing here? \nNATHAN I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you. \nMONICA That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter. \nNATHAN So how's the job going? \nMonica forces a smile. \nMONICA You know. \nNathan looks at her, nods. \nNATHAN I think I know what the problem is. \nHe pulls a GARBAGE CAN HOOP from a plastic shopping bag. Monica smiles.  He attaches it to her garbage can. \nNATHAN (cont'd) There. \nHe shoots an ugly, imaginary shot.  She laughs. \nMONICA You shoot like a girl. \nNATHAN I'll take that as a compliment. \nHe gives her a smile, and exits.  Monica looks at the hoop, then crumples a piece of paper. \nMONICA (whispering) And she gets the steal.  Monica goes one- on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops... \nMonica shoots.  The paper drops through the net. \nMONICA (cont'd) (still whispering) It's good!  It's good! \nShe glances up, notices a few patrons watching her.  Monica quickly composes herself and goes back to her work. \nEXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - DUSK \nLENA (cont'd) Shut up. \nMonica gives her a small smile.  Camille looks down at L.P. \nCAMILLE You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold. \nLENA He's fine. \nCAMILLE (warning) Okay. \nLena sighs, rolls her eyes.  She picks up her son. \nLENA Come on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too cold. \nShe exits inside.  Camille makes a face. \nCAMILLE God.  \"Grandma.\" \nMonica smiles.  And then silence.  There is still so much distance between them, so many misunderstanding.  Camille stares at her daughter.  And then... \nCAMILLE (cont'd) You know, I'd probably be a lot more \"prissy\" in the situation than you'd like, but the thing I always admired that drove me crazy, was the fight you had in you. \nMONICA What are you talking about? \nCAMILLE When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you. \nMonica stares at her mom.  Camille stands and leaves. INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMonica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to \nsleep.  Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her \nchoices, her future... \nSuddenly, she climbs out of bed.  She wears a tank-top and pajama bottoms.  She crosses to her window, pulls it open and climbs out. \nEXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS \nMonica drops down.  She moves to Quincy's window and knocks quietly.  Beat, then Quincy appears.  Bare-chested and in a pair of shorts.  He looks at her, then pulls open the window. \nQUINCY (half-asleep) What's going on? \nMONICA We need to talk. \nQuincy just looks at her. \nMONICA (cont'd) Please. \nQUINCY Hold on. \nQuincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T- shirt.  He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground. \nQuincy looks at her. \nMONICA You asked me what was missing. \nQUINCY What? \nMONICA From basketball. \nQUINCY you woke me up to tell me that? \nMONICA It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing. \nQuincy stares at her. \nMONICA (cont'd) What I'm trying to say is -- \nQUINCY I heard enough. \nMONICA What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away. \nQUINCY We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this? \nMONICA I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago. \nQuincy doesn't even crack a smile.  In fact, he glares. \nQUINCY You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't. \nMONICA Then why are you so upset? \nQUINCY Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married. \nMONICA Better late than never, right? \nQUINCY Wrong. \nQuincy starts back toward the window. \nMONICA I'll play you. \nQUINCY What? \n", "test1_input": "LOVE AND BASKETBALL \nLOVE AND BASKETBALL \nBY \nGINA PRINCE-BYTHEWOOD \nOPENING TITLES \nSLOW MOTION.

MCCALL HOUSE - LATE MORNING \nAn upper middle-class neighborhood, known as the Black Beverly Hills.  Big houses, green grass and Caddies in every other driveway.  The street is quiet, until -- \nYOUNG VOICE (O.S.) You wanna be Kareem? \nCAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a basketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven.  He sports a fro, a \"Clippers\" jersey, and a serious swagger. \nQUINCY (CONT'D) All his big butt do is stand by the basket. \nJAMAL Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff. \nKELVIN I'm gonna be like Dr. J. \nQUINCY I'ma be like my Dad. \nJAMAL He ain't a star or nothing. \nQUINCY I don't see none of your sorry daddies in the NBA. \nKELVIN Hey, look, Q. \nQuincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse All-Stars approaching from next door.  Walking in the kicks is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap pulled low.  A moving van is parked in the driveway. \nKELVIN (cont'd) Thought only girls were moving in. \nQUINCY That's what my Moms said. \nKELVIN I hope he can ball. \nJAMAL Bet he's a scrub. \nThe Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway. \nKID Hey. \nQUINCY Hey. \nKID Can I play? \nQUINCY You nice? \nKID Yeah, I'm nice. \nQuincy looks the Kid up and down, then -- \nQUINCY You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal. \nQuincy tosses the Kid the ball.  The Kid pulls off the baseball cap.  Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown face and bright eyes.  She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years old. \nJAMAL Ah man, he is a girl. \nQUINCY Girls can't play no ball. \nMONICA Ball better than you. \nQuincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the driveway. \nQUINCY (whispering) What a dog. \nMonica shoots him a glare. \nJAMAL She heard you. \nQUINCY Nuh uh, they could only hear dog whistles. \nMonica starts to dribble.  Jamal whistles as he walks backwards, guarding her.  She throws up a shot.  IT'S AN AIRBALL.  Quincy and Jamal crack up.  Kelvin rolls his eyes. \n", "test1_true": "QUINCY (cont'd) One, zip. \nHe rolls the ball to Monica.  She starts dribbling and again, Jamal just backs up with her.  She passes to Kelvin.  Jamal and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the basket.  Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back. \nMonica catches the ball and throws up a shot.  It banks off the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET.  The boys look at her in shock.  Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy. \nMONICA One, up. \nQUINCY Lucky. \nQuincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball.  He throws the ball back to Monica. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Two, one. \nMonica dribbles.  Jamal plays her a little tighter.  Monica bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball. \nMONICA Two, up. \nQuincy can't believe it.  Kelvin cracks up. \nKELVIN Aaah, she dogged you. \nJAMAL Shut up. \nThe game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets for their teams.  Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is unable to stop her.  The score hits nine, nine. \nQuincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand. \nQUINCY Point. \nQuincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot. The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off. \nQuincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the ball.  Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off. \nQUINCY (cont'd) I got her. \nQuincy defends.  Monica smiles back at him. \nMONICA Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA. \nQUINCY I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader. \nMonica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket. Quincy stumbles, giving her a step.  Kelvin throws it back. \nQuincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up. In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving her off balance. \nTHE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND, FACE-FIRST.  SHE GRABS HER CHEEK.  BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER FINGERS. \nThe boys stand frozen.  Quincy stares down at her, his eyes wide with fear...and regret. \nINT. WRIGHT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE MORNING \nMonica leans over the sink as her mother, CAMILLE, 36, wipes the blood from her face with a washcloth. \nGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) Eeew. \nHer sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face. She is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and painted nails. \nHer father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box. \nNATHAN How are you feeling, munchkin? \nMonica nods.  He smiles. \nNATHAN (cont'd) Yeah, you're through. \nCAMILLE She needs to stop running around like a little boy. \nNATHAN She's alright. \nCAMILLE How is she alright looking the way she does? \nNATHAN Camille, she'll be fine. \nHe gives Monica a wink, crosses away.  Monica pulls the washcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood herself. \nCAMILLE I'll get some ice. \nShe exits.  Lena shakes her head, follows. \nMonica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the mirror.  TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK. Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left for this little girl to do.  She smiles. \nINT. MCCALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nQuincy sits at the kitchen table, writing \"I AM SORRY\" in block letters across a homemade card.  His face is tight with concentration as he tries to write in a straight line. \nAt the counter, his mom, NONA, moves a cake from its store box to a cake dish.  She is 30, beautiful, with effort.  She smooths the frosting with a spoon. \nZEKE, 32, with the height and ego of an NBA ballplayer, enters.  He laughs. \nZEKE Girl, who you trying to fool? \nQuincy looks up, smiles.  He quickly grabs a piece of crumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke. \n", "test2_input": "QUINCY It's okay, little baby. \nMONICA (struggling) Quit. \nQuincy grips her tighter, rocks her.  Students pass by, laugh. \nQUINCY Shhh.  Daddy's here. \nMonica finally cracks up. \nMONICA You're such a punk. \nHe gives her a kiss. \nQUINCY All these girls...you're the only one I know who's for real. \nMonica smiles, kisses him back. \nMONICA Always. \nINT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING \nA heated scrimmage between the women's \"A\" team (the starting five) and \"B\" team (five who want to be starting).  Monica runs point for the \"B\" team, playing opposite Sidra. \nSidra is all over Monica, slipping in cheap shots, but Monica starts to come on.  She does a quick cross-over and loses Sidra.  She dishes off to Shayla, who scores. \nCOACH MILLER Sidra!  You feel like playing any \"D\"? \nSidra scowls as she runs down court.  She gets a pass in the corner, tires to make a move but Monica slaps the ball loose. \nMonica grabs it, drives to the three-point line, puts up the shot.  SWISH!  Monica stays posed, with her arm up. \nSidra takes advantage, sprints back down court.  She get the long pass, lays it up.  Coach Miller blows her whistle. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) Monica!  Get over here. \nMonica jogs over, sheepish. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) While you're so busy posing, your man just scored! \nMonica drops her head. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) Show me again. \nMONICA What? \nCOACH MILLER You love to pose so much, let's see it again. \nBeat, then Monica holds up her arm like she just shot the ball.  Snickers from her teammates. \nCOACH MILLER (cont'd) I want you to stand like that for the rest of practice. \nMONICA Coach... \nCOACH MILLER I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me? (then) Dora, take her spot. \nDORA, freshman, jogs onto the court.  Coach Miller blows her whistle and the scrimmage resumes. \nMonica stands alone on the sideline, posing, and feeling like an asshole. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING \nMonica sits on the bench in front of her locker, dressing after the shower.  Shayla sits next to her. \nNearby, Lisa and Sandra apply make-up in the mirror.  Zvette passes by, already dressed.  Lisa turns. \nLISA Z, I know you're gonna shower first. \nZVETTE I don't smell bad. \nSANDRA And you wonder why your ass sits alone on the bus. \nCree glances over from another sink, as she snaps the chain on her CROSS NECKLACE. \nCREE You guys curse too much. \nSANDRA Since when is \"ass\" a curse? \nMAEYEN walks past. \nMAEYEN Whoa, it's as big as yours. \nThey crack up.  Cree just shakes her head.  Two TEAMMATES pass by Monica with their arms raised, mimicking her pose. Monica shakes her head. \nSidra glances at Monica from her spot on the bench. \nSIDRA That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman. \nMONICA I was just playing ball. \nSIDRA You were trying to make me look bad. \nMONICA Didn't have to try very hard. \n", "test2_true": "SIDRA Girl, don't you know you're just sloppy seconds? \nMonica rises. \nMONICA What? \nToni tries to step in. \nTONI Sidra, let it go. \nSIDRA Only reason you're here is cause Tonya Randall got pregnant and decided not to come.  They were done recruiting. \nKELLI, senior forward, shakes her head. \nKELLI That's cold, Sid. \nSIDRA Just thought the girl should know. \nMonica is stunned.  Sidra saunters to the showers.  Shayla nudges her with her shoulder. \nSHAYLA Don't even trip.  She's just mad cause she's bow-legged. \nINT. USC SUITES - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMonica and Quincy lay feet to face on Quincy's twin bed. \nMonica's hand holds an ice bag on Quincy's hip.  Quincy's arm rests across an ice bag on Monica's ankle. \nQUINCY Forget Tonya Randall. \nMONICA I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me. \nQUINCY Then prove her wrong. \nMONICA I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me. \nQUINCY So you're gonna act salty all night? \nQuincy's roommate/teammate REGGIE, 18, suddenly pops his head into the room. \nREGGIE Yo, dog, we're about to order some wings. \nQUINCY Nah, thanks. \nReggie shrugs, closes the door.  Quincy looks at Monica, still brooding. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Fine.  Don't worry about proving everybody wrong, okay?  You can't handle the pressure, I'll understand. \nMONICA That was so weak. \nQUINCY Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway. \nMonica shoves Quincy's ice bag down his sweat pants.  He leaps up. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Aaaah!  Damn, girl! \nMONICA That's what you get. \nHe smiles as he pulls the ice.  Then looks her up and down. \nQUINCY So how about a little one-on-one? \nMONICA What are we playing for? \nQUINCY Clothes. \nMONICA What? \nQuincy locks the door, sets up his indoor hoop. \nQUINCY I score, you strip.  You score, I drop something. \nMonica looks at him, then cracks up. \nMONICA Give me the ball. \nQUINCY My court, I go first. \nQuincy grips the ball.  Monica crouches low on defense. Quincy drives past her and slams down a vicious dunk. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Strip. \nMonica makes a face, then pulls off her sweatshirt.  Quincy skips back.  Monica drops low again.  Quincy fakes her out and slams down another vicious dunk.  He laughs. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Where's the \"D\"? \nMONICA Kiss my booty. \nQUINCY Plan to. \nMonica glares through her smile, then pulls off her T-shirt, leaving her in a bra and shorts. \nQuincy goes for another dunk, but this time, Monica reaches out, GRABS HIS DICK.  Quincy drops the ball.  Monica picks it up and lays it in. \n", "test3_input": "MONICA Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer. \nQUINCY The \"man\" again. \nMONICA (smiles) Woman... \nA knock at the front door.  Quincy exits. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMonica follows, then stops short.  Kerry, the spandexed girl from the party, stands in the doorway. \nQUINCY Hey, you. \nKERRY Hi. \nQuincy gives her a hug.  Monica stares at him in disbelief. Reggie and his teammate smack each other, \"Oh shit!\" \nQUINCY Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry. \nMONICA What the hell's going on? \nQUINCY We're going to get some food. \nMONICA Are you out of your mind? \nKERRY Maybe I should come back? \nMONICA No.  You stay, I'll leave. \nShe storms out. \nEXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DUSK \nBAM!  Monica slams her car door.  Her face is a mask of anger and confusion. \nCamille exits the house, car keys in hand.  She sees her. \nCAMILLE Monica.  What are you doing here? \nMONICA Didn't know I needed a reason to come home. \nCAMILLE Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you. \nMONICA Dad around? \nCAMILLE He's still at the bank. \nMonica glowers.  Camille looks at her. \nCAMILLE (cont'd) Everything okay? \nMONICA (clearly not) Yeah. \nCamille just nods, doesn't bother asking again. \nCAMILLE Well, I'm going to get dinner. \nShe pulls open her car door.  Beat, then... \nCAMILLE (cont'd) It's just a game. \nMONICA What? \nCAMILLE Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game. \nMonica rolls her eyes, as her mom leaves. \nEXT. DORMS - NIGHT \nQuincy sits on the wall outside of Monica's dorm, as Monica slowly makes her way up the walk.  She sees him, stops. \nQUINCY Can we talk? \nMONICA Talk to your new girlfriend. \nQUINCY I just took the ho to Burger King, alright. \nMONICA Cheap date. \nQUINCY Least she had time for me. \nMONICA So you fucked around to prove a point! \nQUINCY I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me. \nMONICA What, \"Q-man\", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else? \nQUINCY You forgot to be there. \nMONICA That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do? \nQUINCY Stay! \n", "test3_true": "QUINCY Least you got your priorities straight. \nMONICA I never asked you to choose. \nQUINCY Never had to. \nMONICA I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you. \nQUINCY Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale. \nMonica punches the shit out of Quincy, then pushes past him. Quincy grabs her arm, stopping her. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Hold up.  I'm sorry, alright. \nThey stand, silent.  Trying to come down from their anger. \nMONICA How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you. \nQUINCY I'm not asking for us to be together. \nMonica flinches in shock. \nMONICA What? \nQUINCY I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for. \nMONICA How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this. \nQUINCY I don't think so. \nMONICA You don't think so? \nQUINCY Look, I'm entering the draft. \nMONICA You're what? \nQUINCY I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know? \nMonica's heart is sinking fast. \nMONICA When did you decide all this? \nQUINCY Few days ago. \nMONICA So that's it, just forget about us? \nQUINCY Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me. \nMonica is crushed.  Beat as, Quincy struggles to stay cold. \nQUINCY (cont'd) But, you know, I'd still like us to be friends. \nMONICA Friends. \nShe fights back tears.  Quincy has to look away.  Monica can't respond. \nQUINCY So...I guess I'll see you around. \nMONICA Uh huh. \nBeat, then Quincy turns and walks away.  Monica tries to fight her tears but her pain, hurt and confusion are too much.  Finally, she gives in, and the tears fall. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFOOTAGE.  Press conference.

STREETS OF SPAIN - LATE DAY \nMonica jogs down the congested cobble-stone street, a sports bag over her shoulder.  She is TWENTY-THREE.  Half-assed braids frame her matured features. \nShe passes store fronts, street vendors, and dodges pedestrians, as she makes her way toward a large, older arena. \nEXT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS \nAn excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors. Above them, a huge banner reads \"Campeonato de Europeo\". (European Championships\".) \nAs Monica heads for the back entrance, a cheer goes up from a large contingent in the crowd.  Monica smiles, waves back. TWO LITTLE GIRLS break from line, run to her. \nLITTLE GIRLS Baloncesto!  Balencesto!  (Basketball! Basketball!) \nMONICA Oye. \nThey giggle, hold out a piece of paper and a pencil. \nLITTLE GIRLS Autografo. \n"}

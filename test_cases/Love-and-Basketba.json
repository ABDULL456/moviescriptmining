{"test1_input": "As Monica signs her autograph, a tall woman carrying a matching sports bag approaches.  She is LUISA, Spanish, 33. \nLUISA (thick Spanish accent) Monica.  What is up? \nMONICA Oye, Luisa. \nMonica hands the girls her autograph and they run off. \nLUISA Large game, no? \nMONICA Si.  Large game. \nThey duck into the arena. \nINT. ARENA - LOCKER ROOM - LATE DAY \nPaint peels off the walls.  Windows are broken overhead. \nMonica sits alone at her locker, taping her own ankles.  Her TEN TEAMMATES, all from Spain, sit on the surrounding benches, talking and joking among themselves in Spanish. Monica is clearly an outsider. \nCOACH PARRA, Spanish, late 40's, enters. \nCOACH PARRA Silenco! \nThe women immediately stop talking.  COACH PARRA gives an animated, impassioned speech in Spanish.  Monica doesn't understand a word, just continues taping her ankles. \nCoach Parra finishes and the women clap, pumped up. Monica turns to Luisa, seated next to her on the bench. \nMONICA What did he say? \nLUISA He say to give the ball to you. \nINT. ARENA - NIGHT \nThe arena is PACKED with a raucous European crowd, chanting and waving signs - the love their women's basketball. \nMonica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her shorts.  The uniforms are old-style - polyester and tight. Her club's name is stitched on the front, \"GODELLA\". \nAs she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her game face.  Standing opposite her, playing for the opposing Italian club is Sidra, HER RIVAL FROM USC. \nSIDRA Well, what do you know. \nMONICA What's up, Sidra. \nSIDRA I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house. \nMONICA How do you say \"you're dreaming\" in Italian? \nThey move into position.  The ball is tossed up.  Italy winds the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra. \nMonica hounds her as she brings up the ball.  Sidra shoves her off and to the floor, and scores.  No whistle.  Women's pro ball is at a whole other level.  Bigger, better, tougher. \nThe ball is passed in to Monica.  She drives down court, goes up for a lay up.  An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air, taking out her legs.  Monica crashes on the hardwood. \nA whistle.  Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word. Without emotion. \nINT. SPAIN - NIGHTCLUB - LATE NIGHT \nA huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music.  In the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of the party. \nIn a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching the festivities.  A large trophy sits on the table. \nSIDRA Can you take that damn thing off the table. \nMONICA You mean my championship trophy?  My bad. \nMonica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm around it.  Sidra shakes her head. \nSIDRA Still a cocky bitch. \nMonica laughs.  She downs her drink, motions to the waiter. \nMONICA Uno mas, por favor. \nThe waiter nods. \nMONICA (cont'd) Last I heard, you were playing in Sweden. \nSIDRA Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me. \nMONICA Just like that? \nSIDRA Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years. \nMONICA How's that been? \nSIDRA It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad \"The American\" was making more money. (smiles) I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball. \nMonica laughs as the waiter brings her drink.  She tries to pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away. \nSIDRA (cont'd) Most of us don't win championships our first year overseas. \nMONICA Please, I went through the same drama as everybody else.  I mean, the first four months, only person I could talk to was this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words of English from watching old \"Dif'rent Strokes\" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to tell her if she said, \"What you talking bout, Willis?\" one more time, I was gonna kick her ass. \n", "test1_true": "SIDRA So what are these Spanish guys like? \nMONICA I wouldn't know. \nSIDRA What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything? \nMONICA Just not my type, I guess. \nSIDRA Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me. \nMonica smiles. \nMONICA You ever think about going back? \nSIDRA Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni? (off Monica's nod) She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this. \nMonica takes this in.  Her eyes do not reflect someone on top of the world.  She takes a long drink. \nINT. SPAIN - MONICA'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nA small, sparse, one-bedroom.  Sam, Diane and the rest of the gang from \"Cheers\" fill the small TV screen that flickers in the darkness.  Their dialogue is dubbed in Spanish. \nMonica sits on the floor, braiding her hair. \nSHE WEARS BOXERS AND QUINCY'S OLD PRACTICE SHIRT.  AFTER FIVE YEARS, IT IS WELL-WORN. \nFeelings of loneliness threaten to swallow her whole.  She looks out her window and sees her billboard, looming in the distance.  She just stares. INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - NIGHT \nThe crowd erupts as a Laker player dunks the ball on a fast \nbreak. \nANGLE ON \nLaker announcers CHICK HEARN and STU LANTZ. \nCHICK HEARN \nStu, this game is in the refrigerator. The door is closed, the lights are out, the butter's hard and the Jell-Oooooo's jigglin'. \nSTU LANTZ And here come the subs. \nANGLE ON \nQuincy pulls off his sweats and jogs onto the court with the rest of the subs.  He is twenty-three, a man.  His goatee and tired eyes make him look older.  HE NOW WEARS NUMBER TWENTY- ONE. \nSTU LANTZ (cont'd) (V.O.) It's good to see these guys get a little playing time.  And the fans love it. \nQuincy immediately gets a pass in the corner.  He puts up a quick three and it banks hard off the rim. \nANGLE ON \nChick and Stu. \nCHICK HEARN Three-pointer is off for the kid from SC.  Came out after his freshman year, now in his fifth year with the league. \nSTU LANTZ The son of Zeke McCall, played twelve years with the Clippers. \nCHICK HEARN (nods) Pretty good player.  The kid's moved around quite a bit, but he's hoping to finally have a home with the Lakers. \nANGLE ON \nQuincy steals the ball, has nothing but open court ahead of him. \nCHICK HEARN (cont'd) (V.O.) Watch out, folks, it's showtime. \nQuincy takes off from the hash-mark and throws down a monster jam.  He swings high off the rim.  Too high.  His hand slips and he crashes to the floor.  His knee twists at a sickening angle. \nThe dwindling crowd gasps as Quincy clutches his left knee, writhing in pain. \nINT. DANIEL FREEMAN HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT \nZeke walks down the corridor, checking room numbers.  He is forty-five now.  His slight paunch as become a roll. \nHe sees Nona exiting a room, with an empty water pitcher in hand.  Her hair is in locks. \nZEKE Nona. \nNona looks over.  Her eyes narrow. \nZEKE (cont'd) How's he doing? \nNONA Not great. \nZEKE What's that, not great? \nNONA The doctor'll be back in a minute. \nZEKE Nona, please. \nNONA He tore his ACL. \nZeke's shoulders slump.  Then he looks back at her. \n", "test1_id": 2286, "test2_input": "Kyra sits on the toilet, taking a pee.  Quincy slams the curtain closed. \nQUINCY Damn, girl. \nKYRA What? \nQUINCY I don't wanna see that. \nKYRA Get used to it, babe. \nShe flushes.  Quincy steps out, grabs a towel.  A long scar runs across his knee cap. \nQUINCY Brother's gonna have to start locking doors. \nKyra laughs as she buttons up her flight attendant's uniform. They cross into: \nINT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nKyra packs up a suitcase. \nQUINCY So how long is this trip? \nKYRA Four days. \nQuincy nods. \nKYRA (cont'd) So are you going to be the kind of husband who won't let his wife work? \nQUINCY Nah. \nKYRA (playfully) Why not? \nQUINCY You might be the only one with a job. \nKYRA Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it. \nQUINCY Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what? \nKYRA To do what you love. \nQUINCY I don't know sometimes. \nKYRA You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse. \nQUINCY (beat) A horse? \nKYRA Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive. (then) You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on. \nShe smiles, gives him a kiss, moves back to her packing.  Off Quincy: \nINT. BANK - DAY \nMonica sits at her desk in a blouse and skirt, punching numbers into the computer.  A man sits down in the chair opposite her.  Monica glances up.  It's her father. \nNATHAN Hey, munchkin. \nMONICA Dad.  What are you doing here? \nNATHAN I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you. \nMONICA That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter. \nNATHAN So how's the job going? \nMonica forces a smile. \nMONICA You know. \nNathan looks at her, nods. \nNATHAN I think I know what the problem is. \nHe pulls a GARBAGE CAN HOOP from a plastic shopping bag. Monica smiles.  He attaches it to her garbage can. \nNATHAN (cont'd) There. \nHe shoots an ugly, imaginary shot.  She laughs. \nMONICA You shoot like a girl. \nNATHAN I'll take that as a compliment. \nHe gives her a smile, and exits.  Monica looks at the hoop, then crumples a piece of paper. \nMONICA (whispering) And she gets the steal.  Monica goes one- on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops... \nMonica shoots.  The paper drops through the net. \nMONICA (cont'd) (still whispering) It's good!  It's good! \nShe glances up, notices a few patrons watching her.  Monica quickly composes herself and goes back to her work. \nEXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - DUSK \n", "test2_true": "She looks up - Quincy sits on the grassy hill above her house. \nQUINCY I remember when your mom had to beat you into a dress. \nMonica smiles. \nMONICA You visiting? \nQUINCY (nods) Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company. \nMONICA Who's this guy I always see her around? \nQUINCY Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny. \nMONICA So...how's the knee? \nQUINCY Getting there. \nMONICA Strong enough to get you down the aisle? \nQUINCY Yeah.  Two weeks. (then) I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you... \nMONICA That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy. \nQuincy nods.  Awkward beat. \nQUINCY Can I ask you something? \nMonica looks at him. \nQUINCY (cont'd) You never told me why ball isn't fun anymore. \nMONICA It just isn't. \nQUINCY Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too. \nMONICA You had a rough couple years, that's all. \nQUINCY That a nice way of saying I rode the bench? \nMONICA And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough. \nQUINCY Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that... \nMONICA You're serious. \nQUINCY Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else. \nMONICA Like what? \nQUINCY Maybe go back to school. \nMONICA Wow. \nMonica stares at him, seeing a man in the boy she grew up with.  Quincy looks away, self-conscious. \nQUINCY I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet. (then) She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking. \nMONICA It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way. \nQUINCY So why'd you give up ball? \nMONICA Why do you keep asking me that? \nQUINCY Cause I don't get it. \nMONICA Something was just missing. \nQUINCY What? \nMonica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth. \nMONICA It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone. \nQUINCY Find. \nMonica turns, crosses to her house.  She stumbles on her heels, kicks them off in frustration, and exits inside. Quincy walks back to his curb. \nANGLE ON \nCamille watches from the kitchen window \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - PATIO - DUSK \nLena sits next to Camille.  Her one year old son, L.P., sits on the ground at her feet.  Monica sits quietly nearby, watching. \nCAMILLE So you're still breast-feeding? \nLENA The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat. \nShe quickly looks over at Monica. \n", "test2_id": 2287, "test3_input": "LENA (cont'd) Shut up. \nMonica gives her a small smile.  Camille looks down at L.P. \nCAMILLE You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold. \nLENA He's fine. \nCAMILLE (warning) Okay. \nLena sighs, rolls her eyes.  She picks up her son. \nLENA Come on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too cold. \nShe exits inside.  Camille makes a face. \nCAMILLE God.  \"Grandma.\" \nMonica smiles.  And then silence.  There is still so much distance between them, so many misunderstanding.  Camille stares at her daughter.  And then... \nCAMILLE (cont'd) You know, I'd probably be a lot more \"prissy\" in the situation than you'd like, but the thing I always admired that drove me crazy, was the fight you had in you. \nMONICA What are you talking about? \nCAMILLE When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you. \nMonica stares at her mom.  Camille stands and leaves. INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMonica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to \nsleep.  Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her \nchoices, her future... \nSuddenly, she climbs out of bed.  She wears a tank-top and pajama bottoms.  She crosses to her window, pulls it open and climbs out. \nEXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS \nMonica drops down.  She moves to Quincy's window and knocks quietly.  Beat, then Quincy appears.  Bare-chested and in a pair of shorts.  He looks at her, then pulls open the window. \nQUINCY (half-asleep) What's going on? \nMONICA We need to talk. \nQuincy just looks at her. \nMONICA (cont'd) Please. \nQUINCY Hold on. \nQuincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T- shirt.  He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground. \nQuincy looks at her. \nMONICA You asked me what was missing. \nQUINCY What? \nMONICA From basketball. \nQUINCY you woke me up to tell me that? \nMONICA It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing. \nQuincy stares at her. \nMONICA (cont'd) What I'm trying to say is -- \nQUINCY I heard enough. \nMONICA What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away. \nQUINCY We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this? \nMONICA I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago. \nQuincy doesn't even crack a smile.  In fact, he glares. \nQUINCY You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't. \nMONICA Then why are you so upset? \nQUINCY Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married. \nMONICA Better late than never, right? \nQUINCY Wrong. \nQuincy starts back toward the window. \nMONICA I'll play you. \nQUINCY What? \n", "test3_true": "QUINCY For what? \nMONICA Your heart. \nQuincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the absurdity. \nQUINCY You're out of your mind. \nMONICA So you're gonna bitch up? \nQUINCY What's that supposed to be, psychology? \nMONICA I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you. \nQUINCY Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on. \nMonica moves past him, reaches through his window.  She drops back down, holding his basketball. \nMONICA Prove it. \nShe throws him the ball. \nQUINCY What will this prove? \nMONICA You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to. \nQUINCY So? \nMONICA So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you. \nQUINCY And what happens when you lose? \nMONICA If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present. \nQuincy stares at her. EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SHORT TIME LATER \nMonica stands opposite Quincy.  Both are suited up in \nbasketball gear. \nThey stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses him the ball. \nMONICA Check. \nQuincy tosses the ball back.  Monica drives.  Quincy's knee is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up.  She scores easily. \nShe walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball. \nMONICA (cont'd) One, zip.  Check. \nQuincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back. \nThe game continues.  Monica owns the first five points easily by exploiting Quincy's injury. \nMonica drives for another lay-up.  Quincy suddenly lets go of his fear, leaps and swats her shot. \nHe grabs the rebound and lays it up.  He nods intensely, as he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key. \nQUINCY One, five.  Check. \nThe game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using his size and strength.  He scores seven straight points. \nThe score stays close.  It is a sexually-charged battle of wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt.  Their bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.  Monica yanks off her jersey in frustration.  Her ass bumps into his hips as she backs him in.  Her hands slide across his chest as she guards him... \nFinally, the score hits nine, nine.  Monica slowly walks to the top of the key. \nMONICA Nine, up.  Point. \nShe tosses Quincy the ball. \nMONICA (cont'd) Check. \nQuincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense.  Monica fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites.  Monica drives around him.  SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP.  SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT ROLLS OFF THE RIM.  Monica can't believe it. \nQuincy grabs the loose ball and clears it.  He stares at Monica as he dribbles in front of her.  She stares back. \nHe breaks for the basket.  Monica stays with him.  He goes up.  Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot. Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground.  He lets go of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also.  GAME OVER. \nSilence.  Quincy stares at her.  Monica looks back.  Then: \nQUINCY (pointed) All's fair in love and basketball, right? \nMonica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up. She slowly walks back toward her house.  And then: \nQUINCY (cont'd) Hey. \nMonica slowly stops, turns. \nQUINCY (cont'd) Double or nothing. \nMonica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.  Quincy limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her. \nMonica slowly walks back to him.  They stare at each other. No more egos, no more bullshit.  Just love. \n", "test3_id": 2288}

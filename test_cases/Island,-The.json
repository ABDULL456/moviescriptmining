{"train": "THE ISLAND \nWritten by \nCaspian Tredwell-Owen \nWe PULL BACK, in marked steps, to include neighboring apartments with identical frosted facades. Then more apartments, above and below, the tiers linked by ramps and crosswalks. It might be a prison cellblock but there are no guards apparent. Indeed, the residents move freely, all notably male, all clad in shearlings, polo shirts and slacks. It is just another day in Sector Four. \n3   INT. NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY \nSatie's Gymnopedie plays from overhead speakers. \nA glass wall looks out across a green mountain valley. The plaza, formed in curves of creamy ceramic tile, is divided into two service areas. \nMale residents in line on one side, females on the other. Both genders combine in the seating area. Lincoln reaches the head of the line. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner. A NUTRITION CLERK, a surly woman in uniform, eyes the readout on her screen- \nNUTRITION CLERK Lincoln Six-Echo... Options are dried fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran. \nLINCOLN What? No bacon? \nNUTRITION CLERK You got a sodium flag, pal - now what's it going to be? \nLINCOLN Whatever. \nHe shrugs, disgruntled. The clerk taps her screen. Turning to a row of chutes behind her, she collects a foil covered bowl and a drink can. Lincoln, less than appetized, loads his tray with the oatmeal and juice breakfast. Then he heads into the seating area. \nIn the seating area, male and female residents sit eating and chatting happily. Uniformed busboys intermix, clearing and wiping tables. A divide in this community now starts to become clear... \nThe busboys, like the nutrition clerk, like all the service, maintenance, and administrative staff we'll see, have distinct uniforms but no facial marking. They are known as \"outsiders\". \nThe \"residents\", like Lincoln, have crosshatched scars on their upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists. Mostly Caucasian, from mid-twenties to mid-sixties. There are no children here. \nWe isolate a blonde - mid-20's, fresh, bright eyes, a fragile beauty, a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal. Her name is ESTER TWO-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln, she smiles and waves- \nESTER Lincoln ! Over here! \nLincoln crosses, a little surprised to see her. Pleasantly so. \nLINCOLN Hello , stranger. \nESTER What? You don't recognize me? \nLINCOLN It's just an expression, that's all. \nESTER You and your expressions, Lincoln. Now sit down and ask me where I've been. \nLINCOLN (sits , a spreading smile) Okay, Ester. Where have you been? \nESTER At the medical center. Just for tests but they had me on liquid nutrition. (forks a mouthful of eggs) \nMmmmm. This is the first solid food I've had in a week. \nLINCOLN Exciting. \nESTER That's not the exciting part. I got my first trimester report: happy, healthy and contaminant-free... Both of us. \nLINCOLN Us? \nESTER My baby... It's in perfect condition. I just hope I can keep it that way. I still have six months to delivery. \nLINCOLN Then you leave all this behind, huh? \nESTER Why? Will you miss me? \nHer eyes betray a flicker of something. It unsettles Lincoln. \nLINCOLN I'll miss your coffee. C'mon, I already burned up my quota. \nESTER Okay. But this is the last time. \nIn a deliberate move, she drops her napkin on the floor. As she ducks down to retrieve it, Lincoln steals a gulp of her coffee. Rising again, Ester registers his souring look. \nESTER What is it? \nLincoln just nods across the plaza. Ambient conversation is now ebbing at an arrival. An outsider in a grey, vaguely clerical uniform - sanguine, settled, precise eyes. He might be a prison warden but for the generally warm reception. He is known as The Community Director. His name is MERRICK. \nHe crosses to a lectern, unlooping a chain from his neck with a three-forked pendant known as a \"tri-key\". He slots the tri-key into the lectern. The glass wall frosts over and pixellates i n t o a live feed of himself. Now amplified by the plaza speakers, Merrick begins his address- \nMERRICK Good morning. To everyone here and everyone watching on etherscreen, welcome to the community address. Today I'm coming to you from Sector Four. For those of you here with sugar quotas, let me recommend the french toast. I just tried some and it's excellent, really. But I know what everyone's hungry for s o let's move on to the lottery. As always the draw will be made from our host sector. So tell me, Sector Four - is everyone ready for The Daily Spin? \nApplause and whistles erupt, mostly from the younger residents, who take on the zeal of a game show audience. The older ones - including Lincoln - greet the prospect with labored tolerance. Merrick turns the tri-key i n the lectern. The glass wall switches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text; \n- - DAILY SPIN!... GET READY TO WIN!... DAILY SPIN!-- \nMERRICK Let The Spin begin. \nTo a burst of cheers, he turns the tri-key another notch. The glass wall becomes a spinning blur, like a tumbler on a slot machine. But instead of icons, it clicks through names, each separated by a blank line - from \"Adams One-Alpha\" to \"Zucker Three - Charlie\" - scrolling the entire population of Sector Four. \nAs the spin slows, a pent silence falls. Expectant eyes watch the names click through the P's, the Q's, the R's, the S's and . . . - - SPIN WIN!... STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA... SPIN-WIN!-- \nJONES C'mon, champ. A stim unit says you won't last three rounds. \n8   INT . BOXING RING - CENTERVILLE - EARLY EVENING \n- C R A C K - The same face recoils from a punch. Jones shakes it off, retreating, recovering. He resets his guard as Lincoln moves in. Lincoln jabs at Jones' defenses, his blowing hitting harder than we'd expect from his stature. Suddenly he breaks through with a left hook. Jones staggers back. A strange ripple distorts his face. Stranger still, his skin tone takes on a grainy pallor. \nAs the bout continues, we widen to see the boxing ring is indeed a ring rather than a square and beyond the ropes is an outer ring. With Lincoln in FG, we now see another figure in the outer ring, mirroring his moves, dressed identically but for the gloves which are like gauntlets. The gauntlets are rigged to two armatures which are, in turn, rigged to a gantry-like mechanism. It glides \nnoiselessly to and fro, shadowing the figure round the outer ring. RACK FOCUS reveals the figure is also Lincoln . The real Lincoln, in fact. The one in FG is a derivative hologram known as a \"proxy\". As Lincoln fakes and jabs, the counter-weighted armatures drag and recoil, duplicating the exertions of his proxy. Jones moves more sluggishly, his proxy now ghostly, transparent. Now being sent on a last offensive only to be roundhoused by another left hook. Jones' proxy topples and explodes into a pixellated mist. \nLINCOLN Whoooooo! \nLincoln proxy - and Lincoln - punch the air in victory. Jones unlatches his gauntlets, sweating, galled by the defeat- \nJONES Sure you input the right weight class? \nLINCOLN You're just too slow, Jonesy. \nJONES You're faster `cause you're lighter. Programmers... they always miss something. \nLINCOLN Hey, you put up, now pay up. \n9   INT . STIM BAR - CENTERVILLE - EVENING \nRainbow light and swirling electronic music. The clientele are all male residents. Round the walls, poster-sized etherscreens display various dancing women, beckoning, text supers flashing: \n- - NEW AT THE PLEASURE CENTER!... OR TRY A MYSTERY DATE!... At the bar, Lincoln and Jones, freshly showered, each swipe their ethercuffs over a scanner. A uniformed BARTENDER notes the readout- \nBARTENDER Jones Three-Bravo; you got five units. Your friend, he's got an alcohol flag. \nJONES So make it a beer and a Vita Cola. \nThe bartender serves the drinks and they settle at the end of the bar. Scoping for onlookers, Lincoln steals a gulp of Jones' beer. \nJONES You know, you're going to get yourself contaminated one of these days. \nLINCOLN Shut up, Jonesy. \nJONES So, you up for a rematch tomorrow? \nLINCOLN I can't. I got an interact. \nJONES With who? That blonde again? \nLINCOLN Hey, it's an authorized interaction. We're on the same meditation program. \nJONES You want to get flagged for proximity? \nLINCOLN No law against friendship, Jonesy. \nJONES Quick . . . Give me that beer back. \nTWO CENSUS OFFICERS (\"CENSORS\") enter the bar; in wireless head- sets and white uniforms, they seem at once clinical and military. CENSOR 1 carries a tablet known as an \"etherboard\". CENSOR 2, more imposing, carries a wide-muzzle rifle known as a \"stopgun\". Their foreboding appearance is greeted without alarm. As they move up the bar, the customers dutifully swipe their ethercuffs over the etherboard. Now reaching Jones, who swipes accordingly- \nJONES What's going on, officer? \nCENSOR 1 Census check. \nCensor1 checks the etherboard; a headshot of Jones spins in 3-D. He offers it to Lincoln who swipes his ethercuff emphatically- \nLINCOLN What happened? You lost count? \nCENSOR 1 I hope nobody's drinking off-quota. \nLINCOLN Vita Cola all the way, officer. \nLincoln sips his cola. As they move on, he grimaces at the taste. \n10   INT . SHUTTLE - IN TRANSIT - LATER \nLincoln stares out of the window. The red pulse of the lode poles catches a glazed look in his eyes. His pupils, a little dilated. His focus returns to the interior and an etherscreen banner: \n- - G E T READY FOR THE DAILY SPIN!... TOMORROW IT COULD BE YOU... \n11   INT. BEDROOM - LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY \nThe horizon. The morning sun streams over the green mountains. Lincoln lies sleeping, his head buried under the pillow. Off a beeping sound, he stirs and squints up at the mirrored ceiling: \n- - ETHER CALL PENDING ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK? \nLINCOLN Accept. \nThe etherscreen resolves Ester's face, fresh and bright. \nESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN) Lincoln? I missed you at breakfast. \nLINCOLN I guess I overslept. \nESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN) I just wanted to check we're still on for tonight. The interact. \nMCCORD Sorry, chief. I can't let you get any closer. We got live wires over there. \nLincoln's reply is muffled by the gasmask, lost in the noise. \nMCCORD What's that you said? \nLincoln repeats to no avail. Frustrated, he peels off his gasmask- \nLINCOLN I said I can't hear you. M c C o r d c h u c k l e s at the irony. \nMCCORD He y , you get yourself contaminated, don't come pointing the finger at me. LINCOLN How are you doing, Mac? \nMCCORD You know how it is. `Gets to the end of shift, `crew starts draggin t h e i r feet. \nLINCOLN We l l the guys upstairs are griping about the backlog. They want to know when you'll be ready for move in. MCCORD I guess if we bust our backs, we could be out of here by the end of the week. \nLINCOLN I'll tell them two weeks. \nMCCORD Thanks , chief. I appreciate that. \nLINCOLN So . . . got any stuff on you today? \n17   INT . AIRLOCK - SECTOR SIX \nA sign reads \"Warning! Contamination Risk!\". Lincoln stands by as McCord u n l o o p s a neckchain w i t h a single-forked pendant known as a \"uni-key\". He slots it into the top of three keyholes. A light starts flashing and the airlock gives a heavily pressurized hiss. \n18   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT \nA deep steady thrum. Giant extractor fans churn above and below, both directions seemingly limitless. The bleak concrete shaft is streaked with soot, threaded by ladders and catwalks. On one such, we isolate Lincoln and McCord. B o t h smoking cigarettes. \nLINCOLN I t ' s too bad. MCCORD What do you mean? \nLINCOLN T h a t your shift's almost over. \nMCCORD You mean, these things? Well, these things ain't good for you anyways. \nLINCOLN The y taste good. \nAn exchanged smile. A pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure. \nLINCOLN I like coming here. Talking. Most outsiders don't like to talk. \nMCCORD That's because we ain't supposed to. They got rules about fraternization. \nLincoln nods. Another pause as they drag on their cigarettes. \nLINCOLN What do you do when the shift's over? \nMCCORD M o r e of the same. They cycle us onto the disposal detail. Hump `n dump crew. \nLINCOLN H u m p `n dump crew? \nMCCORD D e b r i s clearance. We hump the heavy stuff to a site on the outside. LINCOLN Is it as bad as they say out there? \nM c C o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzled. Lincoln displays his gasmask. \nLINCOLN The air... the containments. \nMCCORD Right. \nLINCOLN But not everywhere. Not on The Island. \nMCCORD ( b e a t , stubs his cigarette) I don't know too much about that. Lincoln eyes him narrowly. McCord p a u s e s , then tucks his lighter into the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile. \nMCCORD He y , take it from me, you got a sweet deal right here. So why worry, huh? Lincoln shrugs, accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke. We tilt up to follow the smoke plume, dissipating into the fans. \n19   EXT . THE WORLD OUTSIDE - DAY A i r blasts up from a giant tunnel. \nW i d e n i n g , we see it is one of a huge ring, planted in the dust, backdropped b y mountainous red rocks. At the hub of the ring is a large cubic building. From its facets, giant appendages of ducting plunge into its surround. These are the inlets for the processed air that feeds the underground... \nThis is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above. \nF r o m the processing plant, we pull back and up, raking over a large industrial complex. More cubic buildings, cream colored, windowless, like stacks of giant playing bricks. Now we see the front of the complex. The planate f a c a d e , faceless but for the entrance, cubed in polarized glass, like a dark cyclopean eye. \nF r o m the entrance, we follow a walkway out to a dock where the ground drops away into a broad concrete trench; like the subway, lined with lode-poles and buffers, it is known as a \"lodeway\". From the dock, we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall; red rock slabs, twenty feet high, framing a giant gateway. The gates now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall- \nThe shimmering bleached wilderness of The Arizona Desert. O u t in the distance, where the lodeway tapers into the scrub, a vehicle emerges from the shimmer. A hybrid of bus and nautical craft, single hulled, known simply as a \"liner\". Now as the liner becomes clearer, a decal on its prow is revealed - a crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d \"The Sanger Institute\". 20   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY \nThe polarized glass shows the liner has docked and A TOUR GROUP is disembarking. The men are mostly over 40, bloated by luxury. The women, mostly under 30, wives and girlfriends, all jewels and haute couture. They filter into the entrance hall to be greeted by the courtesy staff. Pretty girls in short skirts and blazers with the crosshatch insignia, led by a pert redhead named LYDIA. \nLYDIA L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia and on behalf of our staff, I'd like t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute. \nLYDIA (cont'd) Before we start the tour, we'll be serv- i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center and circulating our standard discretion agreements. I should add that today you are all very lucky because our CEO and founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us and will be leading the tour personally. \n21   INT . INNER FOYER - LATER The crosshatch emblem spins on a wall-to-wall screen. Not a real screen but a projected flat known as a \"holoframe\". Here, Lydia assembles the tour group, nursing wine glasses and canapes. The holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins: A series of vignettes; an old man shuffling on a walking frame -- a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit, one breast flattened by a mastectomy -- a young woman in labor, her face knotted in pain. The group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles. Then- \nV O I C E (O.S.) I t ' s not a pretty sight, is it? E y e s turn to a figure behind them, dressed in a vestmental w h i t e labcoat - 70's, tall, slightly hunched by senility, eyes like quicksilver, glittering. He has the hauteur of a visionary stooping to the role of a salesman. His name is DR. HENRY SANGER. \nDR. SANGER (cont'd) M o r t a l i t y . We all know its face and yet w e look away, don't we? We deny that our l i v e s are ordained to suffering. That w e are all, inalterably, going to die. \nT H E WASP The commercial. The girl with the baby. What is that? A fix for infertility? \nDR. SANGER You mean the maternity plan? No. N o t endemic infertility at least. As I said, the law prohibits genetic alteration so a defect endemic in a sponsor will also be present in their agnate. No, what the maternity plan provides is a way round the risks and rigors of childbirth. Under this plan, an agnate becomes eligible for pregnancy shortly after foundation. A simple donation of sperm from the father, then the agnate is fertilized and brings your baby to term. \nTHE WASP An d then what? You get it in the mail? \nDR. SANGER F o r practical reasons, delivery is handled by your healthcare p r o v i d e r . \nT H E WASP An d \"the agnate\" - what happens to it? When it's, you know - delivered. \nDR. SANGER The same rule applies. You can continue your sponsorship. Or not. And in this case, there's a natural window for compliance as the agnate is routinely sedated after delivery. As to whether it wakes up from that sleep, like I said, the choice is yours... \nT H E WASP ( b e a t , a shrug) An y t h i n g to avoid stretch-marks, right? \nThe other tour members, some more guiltily than others, laugh. \n23   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT A i r blasts up from the same giant tunnel, swallowing the laughs. \n24   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT \nThe acoustic hollowing as we look up from the now empty catwalk. The blast of air fading into the deep, steady thrum of the fans. \n25   INT . CONTAINMENT \nThe thrum fading to silence. A flat, measured silence as we revisit the community in soundless montage. The residential block, the frosted facades. The nutrition plaza, the counters, the chutes. The subway, the moving walkways. Centerville, the buildings now emitting a trickle of agnates, ending their workday - unwitting participants in their own greater utility. \n26   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CENTERVILLE A glass wall looks down on the avenue. The furniture is trans- p a r e n t , ethereal. Merrick sits at a console desk studying an etherboard. O f f a buzz, he taps a button. The door opens and Lincoln enters, composing a deadpan. He doesn't like this man. \nLINCOLN You wanted to see me? \nMERRICK Yes . Please, take a seat. He taps     a button. The glass wall frosts over. It's unnerving but Lincoln      stays deadpan, moving the chair before taking a seat. Merrick      reviews the etherboard: Lincoln's headshot s p i n n i n g in 3D w i t h   a scroll of data. Then he looks up, forming a smile- \nMERRICK How ' s Lincoln Six-Echo today? \nLincoln shrugs, noncommittal. Merrick eyes him thoughtfully. \nMERRICK E v e r y t h i n g going okay? \nLINCOLN I guess not. \nMERRICK Why do you say that? LINCOLN I f I'm here. \nMERRICK I'm not sure I deserve such a negative association. My job's only to see that you're happy. That everything's okay. \nLINCOLN Right. MERRICK I t sounds like you don't believe me. \nLINCOLN Why wouldn't I? \nMERRICK ( s i t s back, smiling) I t ' s part of your makeup. To challenge things. To question what's around you. \nLINCOLN Ah. \nMERRICK P e r h a p s you can utilize that facility by helping me solve a little puzzle. Lincoln shifts, feeling uneasy. Merrick consults the etherboard- \nMERRICK You're doing well in most areas - pro- f i c i e n t a t work, exercising rigorously, your last medical puts you in excellent condition. But screening's picked up some deviations. Trace levels, changes in your sleep pattern... I see you've also been burning up your quotas... \nLINCOLN A r e you saying I'm contaminated? \nMERRICK No. LINCOLN The n what's the problem? \nMERRICK The r e are parameters, Lincoln. When someone starts straying from those parameters, we need to find out why. \nLINCOLN Why? \nMERRICK Because you - not just you, all of our residents - are special. Because people like me don't get to go to The Island. \nHe smiles. Lincoln stays deadpan, wondering where this is going. \nMERRICK S o tell me, have you noticed any changes in yourself? \nLINCOLN No. MERRICK What about your sleep pattern? You feel you've been sleeping properly? \nLincoln shrugs, refractory. \nMERRICK L e t me put it another way, when you wake up, do you feel... disrupted? \nLINCOLN Disrupted? \nMERRICK R e s t l e s s , disoriented, uneasy... LINCOLN I don't know. \nMERRICK They're all words in your vocabulary. I know you understand what they mean. Lincoln ' s jaw clenches, patronized. Merrick notes this, resumes- \nMERRICK Quotas . . . nutrition. Do you feel like you want more than you're given? LINCOLN I don't know. \nMERRICK Do you have any difficulty staying focused? At work, for instance? \nLincoln ' s jaw twitches. Merrick notes this, proceeds with care- \nMERRICK H a v e you been experiencing feelings, sensations you don't quite understand? \nLincoln looks out at the etherwall. The faces blink off to leave him staring at his reflection. Just one left, a pouting redhead, who licks her lips in anticipation as the lights dim. \nA holographic mist now rises. First resolving a proxy of Lincoln, naked, replicating his posture in the tank. Then the redhead is conjured, her buxom nudity glimpsed through the swirling mist. Lincoln proxy reaches out to stroke redhead proxy's breast. In the tank, Lincoln's fingers caress only the gel, his fingertips met by soft arcs of light - neurological charges, conducted by the gel, creating the sense of touch. They are known as \"impulse arcs\". Redhead proxy responds, dappling her lips across Lincoln proxy's neck. In the tank, impulse arcs flicker across Lincoln's throat, then down his chest, descending to more erogenous zones. Lincoln stiffens and closes his eyes, yielding to the sensation. \nThe sensation engulfing him, Lincoln's brow starts to furrow. Not with ecstasy. Something darker. His eyes open, his pupils fixed in a black dilated stare. Resisting the artificiality, his face forming a sneer, tightening until... he slams h i s palm into the touchpad. The tank shakes. The proxies blink out. Lincoln stands mirrored in the etherwall. His hand, pressed against the glass in a posture of defiance. His reflection, warped and shuddering. \n31   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT \nF r o m darkness grows a seed of light. Red light, pulsing to reveal the shaft, lined by lode-poles, here in triangulated relay. The polarity cradles a dark mass towards us. An elevator in descent. \n32   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE \nMerrick   is at his console, working late. Off a buzz, he taps a button.   The door opens and an outsider enters - 40's, square set, hollow,   remote eyes. His hair is damp and he wears post-decon scrubs.   A USMC ring is visible on his finger. His name is SCHEER. \nMERRICK K a r l . . . Welcome back. \nS c h e e r pauses, his face twitching. Then sneezes violently. \nSCHEER I forgot how much I hate the air here. \nMERRICK J u s t a histamine reflex. Your system's readjusting to the sterile environment. \nSCHEER I t ' s the smell I hate. Empty. \nMERRICK Yes , well I cut short your leave for a reason. I take it you've been briefed? \nSCHEER ( s i t s , sniffing) O n e of our lab rats is missing. W i t h a dour look, Merrick slots his etherboard i n t o a dock. A proxy resolves over the console, quarter scale, spinning in 3D; male, African American, bull neck. Data etches across thin air: \n- - P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER; FOUNDATION: II; GENERATION: DELTA; - - I N T E G R A T I O N DATE: 01/27/84 // CONTAINMENT REF: 102, SECTOR 4 \nMERRICK His name is Starkweather Two-Delta. He dropped off the ether two days ago. At first we thought it was a system error. Then we found this in a garbage chute. \nHe opens a drawer and pulls out an ethercuff. He hands it to Scheer who considers it remotely for a few seconds. Then- \nSCHEER D e l t a generation, huh? \nMERRICK That's right. \nSCHEER I t was a Delta the last time. \nMERRICK T h a t was entirely different. The product suffered a head injury. SCHEER What happened to this one? \nMERRICK We don't know. He just disappeared. SCHEER N o t easy to disappear. Unless he figured a way through the boundary. \nMERRICK He's a code two, Karl. A low functioner. SCHEER I f you ask me, it's a mistake giving them any functions at all. \nMERRICK The y don't function mentally, they don't function physically - you know that. \nSCHEER The n perhaps if you're going to breed lab rats, you should breed them tame. His look, albeit from a distance, throws a stone. Merrick hardens- \nMERRICK I f you bothered to read the clone laws, you'd realize we have no choice in the matter. The virtual humanity statutes accord them a set of freedoms. All we can do is prescribe the limits. And even those are subject to regulation. Scope of knowledge, range of activity, even their speech patterns. The law requires that what is of human origin be provided with human characteristics. \nSCHEER You mean, like fallibility? Merrick pauses. He's not going to take the bait. \nMERRICK The ether shows no attempts on the boundary. He's here, Karl. But for some reason, your men seem unable to find him. It's your job to contain the products. I'd like you to do it, okay? \nSCHEER A little sensitive, aren't we? \nMERRICK J u s t after Starkweather went missing, his sponsor placed an order. An order we can't fill. Damn right I'm sensitive. \nSCHEER A l r i g h t . How much time do I have? \nMerrick taps a button. A holoframe appears beside the proxy. Even in two dimensions, the face is identical. Just a different hairstyle and a gold earring. This is the face of The Sponsor. \nMERRICK J a m i l Starkweather . . . last week he sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in liver hemorrhage. In medical terms, we have maybe a few weeks. In legal terms, we're already o n borrowed time... ( a s Scheer rises to leave) An d Karl? \nMERRICK (cont'd) I don't want a godawful m e s s like the l a s t time. Minimal damage. Understood? \n33   INT . LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN \nThe horizon. The green mountains cast black by the predawn glower. Lincoln sits rigidly hunched on his bed, still in yesterday's clothes, sleepless. He is staring fixedly out of the window, hungrily, as if inviting the outer darkness to come in. \nHis gaze lowers onto his jacket, slung across the bed. He digs in the pocket. And pulls out the cigarette pack. For a moment he considers it. Then slowly, purposefully, he opens it. He slips a cigarette between his lips. And lights up. He leans back, taking a slow drag. Exhaling, he watches the smoke rise. His gaze rests on the etherscreen above, expectant. The cursor comes to life: \n- - S C R E E N I N G . . . CONTAMINANT DETECTED: ADVISING SANITATION CTRL \nR e f l e c t e d in the ceiling, Lincoln grins at his small victory. 34   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR \nQ u i e t , empty at this hour. Just the drum of footfalls as Lincoln marches up the walkway, puffing his cigarette. He stops at the ethergate, regarding it as if for the first time. Then he stubs out his cigarette. And swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. \n35   INT . THE ETHER GRID \nA blue dot blinks in space. We widen to establish its locus on a tomograph. Now building the boxes, the quadrants, the sectors. Revealing a vast, fully dimensional hologram of containment. It spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom. \n36   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM \nO v e r l o o k i n g the ether, like a studio control booth. Known as \"Ethercon\", it's also the title of the Censor at the console. Scheer stands over him, now in a white censor uniform with black chevrons on the sleeves, marking his seniority. He instructs- \nSCHEER R e v e r s e map. Crop to twelve hour segments. Then put up a sub-grid. \nThe footsteps are now coming back. Lincoln spins round. He finds a door. A lock panel. A moment of panic. Then he fumbles the tri- k e y f r o m his pocket, hurriedly slotting it into the lock panel. \n55   INT . THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - SECONDS LATER \nLincoln waits, ear to the door, listening as the footsteps pass and fade out of earshot. Lincoln releases his breath in relief, calming a little, then frowning as he registers another sound. \nVery faint, rhythmic. He turns and looks around. The room is in partial shadow. To one side is a row of seats, to the other, a row of windows, covered by blinds, light creasing through. The sound repeats. Muffled. But now unmistakably THE CRY OF A BABY. \n56   INT . HARVEST ROOM \nA grid of bio-readouts, each square alive with graphs and digits. The familiar baseline of a cardiograph. A lever-arm mounted with an IV r e s e r v o i r , dangling tubes and wires onto the OR table. \nWe see A DOCTOR and A MIDWIFE, in whose arms A NEWBORN BABY squirms and bawls. Lying on the table, we see THE MOTHER, her feet up in stirrups, deeply flushed and puffing from exertion. Marked by her crosshatch as an agnate, she has just given birth- \nTHE AGNATE MOTHER May I hold her? \nTHE DOCTOR We have to run a few tests on her first. In the meantime, I'm going to give you something to help you relax, okay? \nOff his smile, the agnate mother nods, anxiously watching the midwife wrap her baby in blanket. The doctor taps a button and watches the IV reservoir misting with a pale colored fluid. \nThe cardiograph marks the drop as the fast-acting sedative takes effect. The agnate mother watches drowsily as the midwife takes her baby from the room. Then the cry of the newborn is shut out. J u s t the cardiograph now, the beeps evening out, the scart o f peaks shallowing a s the agnate mother falls asleep. The doctor taps a button. On the grid, the face of a DESK NURSE appears. \nTHE DOCTOR I'm incubating the baby for 24 hours prior to transport. But go ahead and contact the sponsor. Tell her she has a beautiful baby girl. \nThe nurse nods. The grid square goes blank. A pause. Then the doctor taps another button. Text appears. Reading it, he cites- \nTHE DOCTOR Let the record show the sponsor has signed Clause 22 of The Basic Sponsor- s h i p Agreement. Initiate compliance. \nA light starts blinking. The doctor walks stiffly out of the room. The door hisses closed. The agnate mother is left alone. Sleeping peacefully, blind to the fluid now seeping into her IV. D e a f to the slowing beep of the cardiograph. The peaks of the baseline falling. Spacing, fading, slowing, slowing, until... The cardiograph flatlines. An d a sepulchral stillness falls. Our angle widens with the growing emptiness. The lifelessness. \n57   INT . OBSERVATION ROOM \nLincoln looks down from above, eyes frozen in the slatted light. His fingers are trembling, rattling the blinds against the glass. \n58   INT . CORRIDOR \nLincoln tumbles out of the door. He can't breathe, can't think, his mind is in overload. He stumbles around like a wounded animal. His focus suddenly and searingly r e t u r n s as he hears- \nDESK NURSE (O.S.) Starkweather ? Like the football player? \n59   INT . NURSES STATION - LEVEL THREE - CONTINUOUS \nA rotunda spoked by corridors. A console at its hub, manned by the desk nurse we saw earlier. The courier stands over her- \nTHE COURIER That's right. Starkweather. \nDESK NURSE Still showing in surgery. Sorry. \nTHE COURIER Honey, I got a bird on the pad and a storm moving in. How long's it gonna be? \n60   INT . ANOTHER OPERATING ROOM \nAnother grid of readouts. Another cardiograph beeps. A spotlamp illuminates the OR table and STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA - his face, slack with anesthesis, eyes rolling a little beneath the lids. The rest of him under a sheet, cut out over the belly, the flesh slit and parted by a clamp, framing a window into his innards. \nStanding over him, mid-operation, A SURGEON and SURGICAL TECH. Interrupted by a chime, the surgeon looks up at a screen, where a panel flashes: \"PAGING\". He cradles his bloody gloves and elbows a button. The face of the desk nurse resolves on screen- \nDESK NURSE (ON SCREEN) The courier's here for pickup. \nTHE SURGEON Well he's going to have to wait a while. It took forever to put this one under. \nSURGICAL TECH (O.S.) Doctor... \nDESK NURSE (ON SCREEN) He's asking for an ETA. Said something about some kind of storm moving in. \nTHE SURGEON For Christ's sake, is that my fault? Just find a way to stall him, okay? \nS U R G I C A L TECH (O.S.) Doctor. \nSURGEON What is it? \nSURGICAL TECH Subject's heart rate is spiking. \nSURGEON Not again. Boost the anaesthetic lev... \nSuddenly he's sprayed with blood a s the clamp springs loose from the stomach, clattering to the floor. He's frozen by shock as... \nStarkweather sits bolts upright. Dazed, he looks at the surgeon, the tech, then down at his wide-open stomach. Instinctively, he clutches it. Then, his mind assimilating the horror, he SCREAMS. Now launching off the operating table, the lever-arm swinging out, blindsiding t h e tech - tubes and wires snapping loose - instruments flying - Starkweather lunges for the doorway - the surgeon steps up to block him - only to be hurled aside... \n61   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE \nTHE BLARE OF AN ALARM. Starkweather, clumping down the corridor, clutching his open stomach, blood streaming down his legs. He's delirious, running nowhere, anywhere, running blind. Reaching the end of the corridor, he stops suddenly, seeing WHITE UNIFORMS. He doubles back up the corridor. Kicking at doors with bare feet, frantic for any means of escape. He spots a ventilator grid, slightly open. He jumps, reaching for it. Once, twice, then his feet slip from under him. He hits the floor with a damp splat. TWO CENSORS turn the corner, ready for action. But there is Starkweather, face-down in a starburst o f his own blood. \nCENSOR (INTO HEADSET) Yeah, no sweat, subject is secured. \n62   INT . DUCTING - MINUTES LATER \nPOVCEILING VENTILATOR GRID. Looking down through the slits onto Starkweather directly beneath. He now has a loose white hood over his head. His wrists and ankles are bound by plastic cuffs. A loop of intestine plumps out from his belly. His weight is such that the Censors have to drag him away, leaving a bloodsmear o n the floor. His guttural whimpers are the only sign of life. \nCLOSEUP: Lincoln's face in part shadow, looking down. The gleam of his eyes as Starkweather disappears from view. Listening now, to those feeble whimpers, growing fainter, ever fainter until they disappear from earshot. Silence again. Emptiness. All that remains of Starkweather is a wending bloodsmear o n the floor. \nLINCOLN LUNGES AT THE CENSOR - ramming him - toppling him across the seats - knocking the stopgun f r o m his grasp - recoiling as-- \nTHE CENSOR RETALIATES - driving a knee into his groin, doubling him over - then a knee to his head - THUDDING INTO HIS SKULL- \nESTER Don't hurt him! \nESTER RUNS UP grabbing at the white uniform, trying to restrain him - the censor swats her blindly - hitting her in the stomach-- LINCOLN SPINS ROUND at the sound of Ester's yelp - only to be roundhoused b y the censor - the blow sending him to the floor-- \nEster DOUBLED OVER - wincing at the pain - clutching her belly instinctively, protectively - an ominous scowl knotting her face- THE CENSOR PUNISHING LINCOLN - kicking him down the aisle - then suddenly hearing a noise from behind - turning to face it as -- \n- B O O M - A GUNBLAST R I P S THE AIR. The brief wail of a hookhead. \n- T H U D - THE CENSOR RECOILING - lurching as the hookhead b i t e s - starting to gag - blood jetting from his neck - a hookhead c l a w e d into his jugular - gurgling, collapsing to the floor-- \nEster STANDING FROZEN - holding the stopgun - seeing Lincoln now getting up - she drops the stopgun l i k e it's on fire, aghast- \nESTER Lincoln? \nL i k e she's asking him what she did... Silence - the rasp of the censor, blood foaming - another sound - FOOTFALLS. Lincoln goes to the door - an IMMINENT MASS OF WHITE UNIFORMS. He grabs Ester- \nLINCOLN RUN!!! \n67   INT . FOYER - THE COMMUNITY CENTER \nCENSORS BURSTING IN - led by Scheer, pushing through into the main hall - the statue of Dr. Sanger looking serenely down-- \n68   INT . MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - BEHIND THE COMMUNITY CENTER \nA HISS OF DEPRESSURIZATION - a pressure door swings open - Lincoln and Ester tumbling through - running up the maintenance corridor-- \n69   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - MOMENTS LATER \nCENSORS FANNING OUT - sweeping the hall, stopguns r e a d y - Scheer finds the fallen Censor - crouches to examine him, then- \nSCHEER Somebody get someone down here! \nA Censor splits off to join him, tapping his headset - Scheer rises again - in his eyes, detachment yields to cold intensity-- \n70   INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS - CONTAINMENT INFRASTRUCTURE \nTHE CENSORS: flooding through into the maintenance corridor, in their white uniforms, they seem like a swarm of antibodies-- \nLINCOLN AND ESTER: deeper in, at another pressure door, fumbling the trikey i n t o the lock. A tense second. The lock hisses open-- \nSCHEER : pushes through the opening gap of another pressure door, taking the lead, his Censors surging up in his wake -- \nLINCOLN AND ESTER: meeting an intersection, veering at random, running blind, running deeper into the faceless labyrinth-- \nSCHEER : catching up, hitting the intersection, pausing to split his squad in each direction - white uniforms dispersing-- \nLINCOLN AND ESTER: reaching another pressure door. Footsteps audible. Lincoln jams the tri-key i n t o the lock. And waits. The seconds pass. But the door doesn't open. Lincoln looks around for another exit. Ester looks at him in mounting panic then-- THE PRESSURE DOOR OPENS: not onto a corridor but an elevator car. Pulling Ester inside, Lincoln finds an array of buttons. His fingers hovers, uncertain which to press. So he punches all of them, stabbing madly, trying to prompt the door to close. SCHEER : turns a corner, seeing his quarry at the far end of the corridor, he gathers pace. The elevator is closing but he doesn't break stride. He deftly taps his headset, opening a channel to-- \nSCHEER (ON HEADSET) Ethercon! The elevator - override it! Do you read me? Bring it back down! \n71   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM \nEthercon is working the console keys like a madman. His gaze flitting to a subgrid o f the complex, spinning the angles, navigating the mesh of lines. His voice comes apologetically- \nETHERCON (INTO HEADSET) You're off the grid, sir. Give me a second. Can you tell me where you are? \nHe recoils at the blaring volume of the response. \n72   INT . CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE ELEVATOR \nScheer stands with his Censors, poised, watching the panel chart the elevator's descent. A light flashes and the doors open. They level their stopguns o n . . . nothing. The elevator is empty. \nSCHEER (INTO HEADSET) Foundation Levels - all of them. Lock them down. Access only on my command. \n73   INT . FOUNDATION LEVEL \nA dead acoustic. A corridor paved with sound proofing panels. It ends at a pressure door, where Lincoln and Ester now arrive. Lincoln looks back to the elevator at the other end. No going back. He slots the tri-key into the lock. The door hisses open. \n74   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBERS \nAmber light. The sound of slow bubbling. Lincoln and Ester pause to adjust to the gloom. They are in a hall of windows. Ester is the first to venture forth, as if drawn, to the nearest window. \nBehind the glass is a foundation tank. Bubbling with viscous fluid, laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro. The tubes connect to a form. A human form, an adult form but curled foetally. I t is known as a \"nascent\". In this tank is a female nascent, shifting slightly, causing Ester to gasp. The nascent registers the noise, turning its head. Its eyelids are closed but its eyeballs move, questioning. A slight furrow appears on its crosshatched brow. Ester recoils in sudden horror, perhaps remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from. \nLINCOLN Ester ! Come on! \nSpurred to action, Ester follows Lincoln onward up the hall. Still conscious of movement all around, of nascents stirring at the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare. \n75   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBER \nA STOPGUN n o s e s through the door. Followed by Scheer moving in silence, honed. How much time has passed is unclear. He signals his censors to split off. Tracking Scheer's advance, we INTERCUT: ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: Censors making their sweep. Strobes of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks. It angles to project a grid across each nascent's face, then fires a short laser burst, searing a crosshatch into the brow. ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: another contingent moves up another row of foundation tanks. The nascents within have cables plugged into their ears, filaments pulsing. The nascents a r e in a posture of rigor, sinews straining as they accept the data impression. \nRETURNING TO SCHEER as he reaches the end of the first chamber. No further access, just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks. He pauses, confused for a second. One of the censors comes up- \nCENSOR Nothing , sir. No sign. \n90   INT . WHISPER - MORNING \nThe pilot jockeys with the thermals. Scheer rides shotgun. Now in civvies, scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars. The flight console beeps. He taps a keypad. A holoframe resolves: \nCENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME) Ground team checking in. \nSCHEER Anything? \nCENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME) The storm pretty much covered their tracks. We're scanning for thermals b u t the hotter it gets, the harder it is to isolate a heat signature. I don't know, sir, it's a big desert out there. \n91   EXT . CHASM - THE RED ROCKS - DAY \nThe desert sun clefts the chasm into light and shadow. Lincoln trudges into view, Ester lagging behind. He stops to let her catch up, only to watch her slump onto a rock. He allows her a moment to rest and walks to where the chasm comes to an end. \nHe surveys the terrain. His eyes roam the carpet of scrub, now narrowing on an inconsistency. A faint strip where nothing seems to grow. Tracing its lineage, he walks a few feet out. Then drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust. \nHis fingers meet something hard. He sweeps off the dust to expose a layer of concrete. Continuing, revealing the ghost of a line. What we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him. Continuing, opening a window in the dust. Now his fingers snag o n something. He tugs it and it gives a little, dust crumbling to reveal a section of rusted chainlink. A corner of metal is visible. Lincoln exposes the rest. A sign, barely legible: \"US Government - Restricted Area\". He frowns, trying to assimilate. Ester comes up to join him. Off her anxious look, he decides- \nLINCOLN I think I've found a path. \n92   EXT . THE GREEN MOUNTAINS - DAY \nW h i t e rock blanketed by stands of fir and ponderosa pine. A whisper skims over the treecaps, circling in on a high shelf. Here, remotely nestled in a clearing, stands a glass villa. \n93   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - DAY \nThe flood of light, the majestic view lend an air of beatitude. The decor is minimalist with Native American accents, kokopelli spirits in carved silhouette. Dr. Sanger stands at a glass wall, looking out across the green mountain valley. On the sofa sits Merrick, now in civvies, still gaunt from worry. The air stirs as a maid ushers in A WOMAN - 30's, all business, sharp blue eyes, a severe, mannish coiffure. Her name is ELLEN CROWNE. \nCROWNE Good morning, gentlemen. \nSANGER Bernard, this is Ellen Crowne from our legal department. Ellen, this is Bernard Merrick, director of products. \nMERRICK Thank you for coming out here. \nCROWNE Well when Henry called me I got the sense it wasn't for a social visit. \nThey settle at a table. A jug of icewater a n d glasses laid out. \nCROWNE I understand there was an incident? \nMERRICK First, let me stress there's no way we could have anticipated what happened... \nCROWNE We're on the same team, Mr. Merrick. Just give me the facts down-and-dirty. \nMERRICK (uneasy, clears his throat) We'v e lost two of our products. They escaped containment last night. \nCrowne casts a troubled look at Sanger. Merrick quickly adds- \nMerrick (cont'd) However, we have all available resources dedicated to the search. \nCROWNE How exactly did this happen? \nMERRICK We'r e still piecing it together. \nCROWNE Do we expect more products to escape? \nDR. SANGER Don't be so alarmist, Ellen. \nCROWNE I'm sorry, Henry, but you asked me here to assess our liabilities. \nMERRICK To answer your question, we condition our products with a deterrent. A fear of contamination. And thereby of the outer environment. So to escape, they first have to escape their conditioning. \nCrowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette. \nCROWNE Containment is one of the terms of our state health license. The fact it was compromised could put us in violation. \nDR. SANGER Bureaucracy. \nCROWNE Henry , it was a bloody battle getting our license through in the first place. \nDR. SANGER They're not going to pull our license, Ellen. We have a lot of friends on the Commission. Not to mention the goodwill we earned in DC when we took over the facility; a bunker complex for a bio- chemical war that never happened... We relieved them of a costly embarrassment. \nCROWNE I'm not sure we can rely on that. \nDR. SANGER Alright . What do you suggest? \nCROWNE First, I need you to level with me. What are our chances of finding them? \nMERRICK Well, in our favor, they've never been outside containment. They'd have no coordinates, no sense of direction. \nCROWNE I don't see how that's in our favor. \nMERRICK They're in the middle of the desert. Food and water become an issue. \nCROWNE So they might return to the trough? \nMERRICK Possibly. \nCROWNE And if not? How long could they last? \n97   EXT . SCRAPYARD - DUSK \nThe porch light comes on, casting the scrapyard in grades of light and shadow. Ozzie steps out onto the porch, lighting a cigarette. His visitor hovering at the threshold, he offers the pack. Lincoln steps out and takes one. Ozzie lights it for him- \nOZZIE Yer girlfriend sure is pretty. \nHis visitor looks at him curiously. Ozzie misinterprets that he's said something out of turn. Time to change the subject- \nOZZIE So what's with them tattoos, huh? \nHe taps his forehead. Lincoln fingers his crosshatch, suddenly aware of it now and suspicious of the question. Ozzie palliates- \nOZZIE Hey , in the eye of the beholder, right? Now this place, this is beautiful to me. This is my place. I own it. `May not look like much but you'd be surprised. C'mon, lemme show you... \nOzzie moseys into the scrapyard, beckoning his visitor. Lincoln hesitates, then follows him, sensing it's better to play along. \nOZZIE M o s t a t h i s heavy stuff's industrial scrap. Comes in from all over. Easy way round the recyclin' l a w s . Me, I sell it on to the boondock b o y s for meltdown. Other stuff, I pick up at the scrap markets. Fix it up, `fetches a price. \nThe y reach a vehicle shell. A rust-pocked chassis, canted on its axle, we might recognize it as an automobile from our own era. \nOZZIE Fossil fuel transport. This piece o' junk's a collector's item. All that Age of the Wheel nostalgia, \"elegant era of transport\" bullshit. I find the parts, she's as good as solid gold. \nOzzie pats his investment and moves to another rusted metal pile. Steepled by rail tracks, we see elevator sheaves, tension cables. \nOZZIE Now this here's got a colorful history. Came in from this ol' g o v e r n m e n t bunker out in the valley. `Got shut down way back. Then this new outfit took over, stripped the place out. I guess they're doin' s o m e more remodelling cause I just had `em in again the other day... ( a tug of smoke, reflective) Hump`n dump crew. Nice fellas. \nLincoln frowns. The term is familiar. The taste of smoke, a hint. But his memory has been clouded by trauma. Ozzie reads his face- \nOZZIE You okay there? \nLincoln looks at him, something breaking the clouds. A sense of danger, indistinct. Suddenly cautious, he stubs his cigarette- \nLINCOLN I'm going to check on my friend. \n98   INT . FRONT ROOM - THE SHACK - DUSK \nA front room turned into a front office. Piles of paper teeter atop junk furniture. A bankers lap we might recognize from our own era glows over a desk where Ozzie is rummaging, looking for something. He stops to peer through and check on his visitors- \nThe woman still lies asleep on the sofa. The man is sitting beside her armchair, head bowed, seemingly plunged in thought. O z z i e resumes rummaging to find a crumpled delivery note. He reviews it for a moment. Then quickly clears away some more papers to uncover a keypad device. It is known as a \"holocom\". He taps a key and a holoframe resolves. Then taps in some digits from the delivery note. The holoframe snows with static. Then a crosshatch insignia appears, spinning in 3D: \nRECORDED VOICE (ON HOLOCOM) Welcome to The Sanger Institute. If you know your party's extension, press... \nLINCOLN (O.S.) What are you doing? \nOzzie jerks round to find his visitor suddenly standing there. He fumbles on the holocom keypad and the crosshatch blinks out. \nOZZIE Nuthin . I wasn't doin nuthin . \nLincoln frowns, the sense of danger becoming more distinct. Ozzie reads his visitor's troubled expression, realizing- \nOZZIE I knew it... them clothes... them weird tattoos... I mean, I heard stories from those guys but I never... \nO f f his visitor's frown, Ozzie bites his tongue. He's cornered in this cramped space with a freak of science. Time to backpedal- \nOZZIE N o t that I believe `em... buncha c r a z y stories... nuthin t o do with you... \nHe chuckles feebly. But his visitor just stares back at him, pupils dilated and dark, somehow inhuman. Time to wriggle out- \nOZZIE W h a d d y a s a y we just forget about it, huh? How about I go getcha a beer? \nHe makes a move past but his visitor doesn't budge. Lincoln senses danger in this old man, whose fear is now manifest- \nOZZIE What e v e r you want... Just take it... Whaddya w a n t . . . ? You want money...? \nHis visitor frowns. Ozzie quickly unlocks a cashbox. He grabs some colored plastic cards and offers them like meat to a lion. \nOZZIE I t ' s all I got... Take it... just please... just don't hurt me... \nHis visitor takes a blue card, inspecting it like a curiosity. Then steps closer. Ozzie shrinks back. An ominous moment, then- \nLINCOLN \" O u t of state\" - how do I get there? \nO f f Ozzie's cowering and confused look, we - C U T TO: \n99    EXT . SKY OVER THE DESERT - NIGHT \nF r o m darkness grows a seed of light. The whisper flies low and quiet, its spotlight roving the undulant desert. Now picking out metal glints as it banks over a scrapyard. Now training its beam on a figure in the dust whirl beneath. Ozzie, his hair flying wild, gesticulating madly. The whisper follows his directions, nosing onwards, its spotlight corrugating across the red rocks. \n100   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - NIGHT \nI n the middle of nowhere, a canopied platform. Not unlike the sub- w a y platform, it borders a deeply trenched lodeway. A wave of dust rolls in, swelled by the whisper, landed beyond. It seems to bring Scheer to the platform. He scans around for a clue, a footprint perhaps. But somehow he already knows. He looks up the lodeway, eyes honing. The deep black line stretches far into the night. \n101   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - NIGHT \nSilence. Still. Sanger sits nursing a cup of herb tea. Crowne sits smoking. Stubs in the ashtray speak of long hours waiting. The still is broken as Merrick emerges from an adjacent room. Sanger and Crowne look up, expectant. Merrick closes the door with slow care. Then he faces them, a grim tenor in his voice- \nMERRICK Bad news. \n102   EXT . PHOENIX - NIGHT \nH O F S T E T T E R T A K E S HIS CHANCE TO RUN - now scrambling against the stampede - Diggs disentangles himself and levels his weapon - the stampede parting - throwing themselves to the ground as-- \n- B O O M - DIGGS FIRES - the scattershot hits Hofstetter a s he flees up some steps - peppering his leg - sparks off metal as Diggs keeps firing - his weapon now earned the name of a \"rainmaker\". H O F S T E T T E R R E A C H E S A CATWALK - his leg dragging, numbing from t h e tranquilizer cores - the catwalk dead-ends - blind panic now - He ducks under the rail, reaching for the dome - finding a precarious handhold, he swings across - trying to climb -- \nD I G G S COMES UP BENEATH - looking up, grinning - the pathetic sight of Hofstetter - one leg useless - clinging to the dome like a fly trapped under glass - as Burdon goes to recover him - \nDIGGS Don't bother. He'll drop by himself. B u r d o n pulls out some handcuffs and stands waiting. Diggs returns to the booth. Pouring out two tequila shots, he grins at Scheer - \nDIGGS N o w . . . where were we? \n104   EXT . THE DESERT - MORNING \nS u n l i g h t blinks off a chain of carriages, travelling the trench of a lodeway. The overnight shuttle slits through the desert. \n105   INT . PASSENGER CAR - MORNING The sun is a muted orb behind polarized glass. Lincoln stares out of the window at the bleak new world blurring past. He's wearing Ozzie's ballcap o v e r his crosshatch, his former clothes discarded for some of the old man's ill-fitting denims. Perhaps a disguise or perhaps just to shed the memory. He glances across at Ester, dressed likewise, her hair teased to cover her crosshatch. She's dozing, head rested on the glass. A TICKET COLLECTOR comes up- \nTICKET COLLECTOR Tickets... Lincoln looks at the man in uniform, uncertain what he wants. The ticket collector shakes his head. These two look like deadbeats. \nT I C K E T COLLECTOR (CONT'D) A d u l t fare is forty five currency units. Do you have the money, sir? \nLincoln assimilates. Money. The word is familiar. He pulls out the blue plastic card. The man in uniform looks encouraged. He gives him the card, watching him slot it into a handheld device, which briefly flashes, then the card is returned. Lincoln sees a strip at the top is now transparent, like a depleted reservoir. He assimilates. Not so different from the transactions in the world below. Then he notices Ester is awake and is looking at him. Her bright eyes, dim and troubled, somehow accusatory. \nLINCOLN I t ' s going to be okay, Ester. \nESTER (faint) Is it? \nLINCOLN We just need to get out of state. \nEster , disconsolate, looks out of the window. In her gaze, the forlorn air of a hatchling fallen from the nest. Lincoln watches her, knowing her troubles and knowing that he cannot relieve them. \n106   EXT . PHOENIX - DAY \nThe skyline stands reprised in daylight. A glimmering citadel. \n107   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - PHOENIX - DAY \nP a s s e n g e r s climb the steps from an underground gloom. Lincoln and Ester with them, jostled by the more certain flow. They cross the portal onto the street and stop, dazzled by the sunlight. Only to be dazzled again by the sudden, stunning prospect of the city... \nF i r s t there's the quality of light, a burning white, perhaps from depleted ozone, depicting everything in a surreal shimmer. Then there's the towers, darkly crystalline, facets of polarized glass rising to domes and spires, like monolothic f i n g e r s reaching for the sky. The traffic flashing past, the chassis identifiable as trucks, taxis, compacts, sedans, streamlined in a nautical trim, hull runners in place of wheels. The sound of claxons, more like fog horns than car horns. Then there's the street itself, a six- l a n e lodeway, lanes marked with buoys, bobbing around on cables. \nThe graceful arcs of pedestrian bridges at the intersections. The citizens, strange hairstyles, fashions, all wearing sunglasses. Even to us it's a wondrous sight. The urbanism, the grandeur, as if here in the heart of southwest, Manhattan has met Venice. \nV O I C E (O.S.) He y , man, spare a little green? \nA w e interrupted, Lincoln and Ester look around. Slouched by the street exit is A HOBO with a mangy dog. He grins toothlessly- \nT H E HOBO A i n ' t eaten in two days, have we, boy? \nLincoln and Ester step back as the dog rises to greet them. Tail wagging, it noses forward, sniffing. Then, abruptly, drops its tail and backs off, whining. Lincoln and Ester likewise back off. Both sides have just discovered a new species. The hobo pets his whining canine, watching the strangers walk off with curiosity. \n108   EXT . STREET - DAY \nThe sunlight flares off passing vehicles, hypnotic. The faces of pedestrians flash past. Lincoln and Ester wander in thrall up the street. Everywhere new sights, new curiosities bombard them... \nThe storefronts, mysterious recesses behind polarized glass. The glass, alive with pixellated g r a p h i c s , marquees: \"Temps! Temps! New Tech Opportunities!\" - \"Beauty Therapy! Manicures, Dermals, Follicle Grafts!\" - \"Discount Legal Service! Class Actions Only!\" \nH o l o f r a m e b i l l b o a r d s loom over the street, huge shimmering panels like phantom jumbotrons, commercials playing on a loop: - - A businessman in a conference room, shrinking from a fierce negotiation; the scene replayed with the same businessman, now on his feet, stabbing his finger angrily in the air; a pill bottle in CU, a text super \"Combatrine! The Aggression Enhancer\" - - A teenager bemused by his homework: his parents escorting him into a clinic; the teenager hooded by an electronic dome; his parents clapping; the teenager smiling as he accepts a diploma; a text super \"Intellex: Data Impression For A New Generation\" \nLincoln suddenly looks round, realizing Ester is gone from his side. He scans the sea of faces. Then spots her stepping through a doorway. Over the threshold is a holoform: a pig with wings, circled by the legend \"Hog Heaven! Home Of The True Hamburger\". \n109   INT . HOG HEAVEN - DAY \nF a s t food outlets have evidently changed little. Promotional posters in 3D: \"Ham Slam\", \"Porker Forkers\", \"Bacon Blitz\". \nService counter, seating area. Ester is looking around like Alice In Wonderland. Lincoln comes up, out of breath, edgy- \nLINCOLN I told you to stay with me. \nESTER ( i n n o c e n t , plaintive) I'm hungry. \nLINCOLN O k a y . Okay... \nHe nods, realizing he is too. He plants Ester in a seat and looks around. People stand in line transacting, receiving food trays. Not unlike nutrition plaza. Lincoln ventures to the counter. He offers the blue card hopefully. THE SERVICE CLERK looks at him- \nT H E SERVICE CLERK A r e you gonna tell me what you want? \nLINCOLN ( b e a t , no other reference) What are my options? \nT H E SERVICE CLERK K n o c k yourself out, buddy. \nHe indicates a menu above. Lincoln assimilates, looking up at the menu. Understanding now, his face lifts to almost a smile. It's the first time he's been given an unrestricted choice. \n110   INT . SEATING AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nLincoln returns to Ester with a tray of food and drink. She's staring off again, distant. He puts a burger and drink cup in front of her. She seems not to notice. He tries to engage her- \nLINCOLN I asked the man how to get to the terminal. He said it's not far. \nBut Ester just keeps staring, her brow now furrowing as A LITTLE GIRL skips past, maybe 11, sipping a soda. Now Lincoln sees her too and is transfixed. Now the little girl notices the strangers, staring at her. She hurries onward, uncomfortable. Lincoln and Ester's eyes follow. It's the first time they've seen a child. \nD I G G S (ON RADIO) P i e c e of cake, Burdie. J a n e Doe's in the bag. Keep an eye out for John-Boy. \nEster looks around in panic. Faces turn but none of them are Lincoln's. Diggs confronts the spectators, flashing a badge - \nDIGGS Bond recovery... state license. \nHe marches his female quarry towards the exit. Now she starts to struggle and he jerks her back, slapping a cuff onto her wrist- \nDIGGS Play nice, little girl. Now you want to tell me where your boyfriend is? \nLINCOLN (O.S.) Behind you. \nDIGGS What? \n- T H U D - LINCOLN HAMMERS HIS FIST into the pale man as he turns - dropping him, flat-on-his-ass - pulling Ester away from him - D I G G S JERKS OUT THE RAINMAKER - quick to his feet - more insulted than hurt - targeting his quarry - who suddenly duck down as-- \n- B O O M - DIGGS FIRES - A WOMAN SCREAMS - the Mexican woman - her face, peppered with tranquilizer core - her baby starts crying-- Ester FROZEN - horrified by the screaming woman - the bloody, slack grimace - the baby bawling - Lincoln dragging her down- \n- B O O M - THE BLAST OF THE THUNDERBOLT - Burdon positioned behind them - narrowly missing his target - hitting the partition wall - - C R A S H - THE PARTITION WALL EXPLODES in a blinding electrical discharge - shattering into a sudden TEMPEST OF GLASS SHARDS - \nLINCOLN AND ESTER SPIN ROUND to see the pale man retargeting - the dark giant reloading - exit blocked, they lunge towards -- T H E PARTITION WALL - kicking through the hole in the glass - Ester's last glimpse of the screaming woman - the howling baby - \n130   EXT .

Who is he? \nPEDESTRIAN What planet `you been living on? That's the Juggernaut, brother. \nLINCOLN The juggernaut... \nPEDESTRIAN Jamil \"The Juggernaut\" Starkweather - highest rushing total in the league. `Least till that injury blew out his gut. Now the doctors are saying he'll be back on his feet next season. Those fuckers sure can work miracles, huh? \nLincoln doesn't respond. The pedestrian shrugs and heads on, writing him off. Lincoln lingers, staring up at the billboard. \n140   INT . CIN BOOTH - NIGHT \nThe flourish of music greets Lincoln as he enters. The cartoon rattlesnake appears and smiles his clownish, fanged smile: \nTHE SNAKE Hi there! I'm Tattletail! What e v e r you want to know, wherever you want to go, I got the answers! Let's look at the menu! \nThe set of text frames appears: \"Residential Listings\", \"Business Listings\", \"Transport Listings\", \"Hotel Listings\". \nTHE SNAKE N o w let's make a selection! \nA heavy pause. Lincoln's voice comes with a slight tremor. \nLINCOLN Residential... \nTHE SNAKE Please give me the name. \nLINCOLN Starkweather... \nTHE SNAKE Okay! Let me find that listing for you! I'll be with you in two shakes! \nThe snake rattles and coils. Then a headshot a p p e a r s with the face of Jamil Starkweather , scaled across with a red line. \nTHE SNAKE Starkweather , Jamil... I'm sorry! This listing is blocked from the directory! \nLincoln stands, darkly intent on the face. Now irrefutably the same face he saw in his life below. The snake shakes its rattle- \nTHE SNAKE You want me to find another listing? Lincoln looks at the snake, flicking its tongue, coiling. \nF A D E TO BLACK. \n141   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - MORNING \nA downtrodden neighborhood. The buildings look like remnants from our own era. A scruffy man slouches up to a gated storefront. He slots a key into a lock panel and the gate rolls up, squealing. We widen to a vehicle parked kerbside. A familiar grey cutter. \n142   INT . STORE - MORNING \nL i g h t s flicker on to disclose a gunshop. The array of firearms a s fathomless as their purpose. The scruffy gunshop o w n e r slouches inside. Diggs and Burdon enter on his heels. He yawns at them- \nG U N S H O P OWNER We ain't open for another hour. \nDIGGS Y e a h , well we ain't in the market. \nG U N S H O P OWNER E v e r y o n e ' s in the market, pal. One end of the barrel or the other... \nDIGGS We ' r e chasing up a currency record from last night. These two ring a bell? D i g g s displays two digital slides. The owner pauses, suspicious. \nG U N S H O P OWNER What are you? Cops? Lawyers? D i g g s answers by jerking out the rainmaker. The twin barrels aimed at his head, the gunshop o w n e r loses his cool a little- \nG U N S H O P OWNER H i m , I remember... Came in just before closing... wanted a shooter but didn't have no ID... settled for one of these. \nHe displays a HUNTING KNIFE, unsheathing it, showing the blade. \nDIGGS Did he give you a name? \nG U N S H O P OWNER No. \nDIGGS Did he say where he was going? G U N S H O P OWNER No. \nD i g g s cocks the hammer. The owner flinches. Then, off the knife- \nG U N S H O P OWNER The r e was one thing. Kinda w e i r d . He wanted to know how to use it... \n143   EXT . APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING \nAn apartment building towers overhead, vaguely ominous. Lincoln approaches the entrance with Ester. We now see he has a band-aid covering his crosshatch. He takes Ester briefly aside, teasing some tresses over hers. As she gently smooths down her hair, Ester catches his eye. A look flickers between them. Then- \nD O O R M A N (O.S.) Fancy dress, was it, sir? \nA DOORMAN is looking at them like they just rolled out of a club he wouldn't be seen dead in. Off their flustered looks, he gives an apologetic smile. Then opens the door and holds it for them. Lincoln reaches for Ester's hand. Then stiffly leads her inside. \n144   INT . CORRIDOR - AN UPPER FLOOR - DAY \nThe doors are set with small glowing orbs at peephole level. Like eyeballs, watching, as Lincoln and Ester proceed up the corridor. They stop at a door. Lincoln checks the number. Pauses heavily. Then looks for some type of doorbell. As his eyes cross the orb, it seems to blink. Then comes a sound of disengaging locks. Then the door swings open. Lincoln flinches, taken by surprise. Then frowns as he sees there is no one on the other side of the door. \n145   INT . APARTMENT - DAY \nLincoln enters, wary, scanning around. A living room. Framed pictures. A sofa, chairs. A coffee table, empty bottles, cigarette packs, a full ashtray. A bureau, some paperwork. Silence, stillness. No sign of life, no sense of danger. Lincoln moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the papers. Ester ventures in through the door, curious- \nESTER What are you looking for? \nLINCOLN You . . . you're the one who made me? \nTOM No. \nLINCOLN Who made me? \nTOM I signed a contract. I can show you. \nHe gestures to a mirror on the wall. Lincoln steps back but his eyes are unremitting. Tom rises, cautious, crossing to the wall. He opens the mirror to reveal a wall safe. His trembling fingers tap the keypad and the safe hisses open. He draws out a contract folder embossed with a crosshatch. Then offers it to his agnate- \nTOM It's all right there. Who, why... \nLincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages, reading. A pendulous silence falls. Tom stands watching, smoking nervously. Ester stands by the door, trying to take all this in. \nTOM Look you've got what you wanted. Now why don't you just get out of here? \nLINCOLN (pause, looks at him) There are men out there, looking for us. I want you to make them stop. \nTOM I can't... \nLincoln sets down the contract and brings up the knife again. \nTOM I can't. Look, I'm a lawyer, I know how it works. The contract, everything, it's all laced with confidentiality clauses. It means they don't want this to get out. It means whatever I do, they're not going to stop. You understand? \nLincoln pauses, assimilating. His double's expression indicates that he's telling the truth. Maybe try a more practical request- \nLINCOLN Do you have transport? \nTOM Transport , yes... yes, parked downstairs... Bay 53... Take it... \nLINCOLN And then you'll call security? \nLincoln steps closer, pointing the knife. Tom tries to stay dead- pan. The lawyer kicking in. Look them in the eye when you lie- \nTOM I'm not going to call security. I'm not going to call anybody, okay? \nLincoln looks at his double, reason now yielding to anger. Deep, roiling. Tom looks at his agnate, fear welling, deadpan cracking- \nTOM Look, maybe there's something... maybe there's a way to cancel the contract... \nLincoln presses the tip of the blade to his double's cheek. \nTOM For Christ's sake! It's not my fault! \nLincoln inches the blade deeper into the trembling face, drawing blood. The anger urging, hungry for more blood. Then suddenly- \nESTER Lincoln ! No! \nLincoln looks at her, the anger interrupted, the knife still in place. He pauses. Then returns to his double. The dreading eyes, the trickle of blood down the face. His e y e s . His f a c e . A long, foreboding moment. Then suddenly Lincoln lashes out. His fist sends his double flying, falling in a flurry of contract pages. Lincoln stands over him, looking down, like a dominant species. His double is unmoving, unconscious. Lincoln abruptly spins away. \n146   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING \nThe light panel flashes. Lincoln stands grimly, head lowered, trying to fathom the anger roiling within. Ester stares at him, wanly. Both held in the dark tableau. And the elevator descends. \n147   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY \nThe vehicle parked in bay 53 is a hybrid of sportscar a n d speed- b o a t , a two-seater known as a \"skiff\". Lincoln and Ester climb in. Lincoln reviews the drive console, the controls, all of it, meaningless. His eyes cross an orb set in the steering wheel. \nThe orb seems to blink and suddenly the drive console lights up. Lincoln reviews it. A screen in front of him is flashing: \"PILOTING: MANUAL/AUTO?\". He assimilates. Then ventures- \nLINCOLN Auto... \nThe interface processes, then asks: \"DESTINATION: NAME/ADDRESS?\" \nLINCOLN O u t of state... West... \nThe interface processes, then reports \"UNDOCKING\". Lincoln and Ester jolt as the skiff shunts forward. Lode-poles pulsing ahead of them, the skiff moves out, as if pulled by a phantom tugboat. \n148   EXT . STREET - DAY \nThe skiff buckets off the ramp into a street inlet. Then stops rocking a little. The interface reports: \"ESTABLISHING UPLINK\". On another screen, a road map appears. A red dot plants at their point of origin then bleeds into a red line, plotting a course. \nThe autopilot scans for traffic, then nudges forward on the throttle. The resistors drone, the steering wheel turns and the skiff noses onto the street. Finding its lane, it drops to cruise speed. Lincoln studies the interplay of steering wheel, throttle and brake. Then glances at Ester. She's plunged in thought, staring off. She turns to him with a haggard frown- \nESTER The man back there... who looked like you... does it mean I have someone too? \nLincoln looks at her blankly, unknowing. Ester stares off again, her brow knotting with unanswered questions. But Lincoln's gaze lingers. Her pale skin, her limpid eyes, her hair fluttering in the breeze. It's the first time he's really seen Ester's beauty. \n149   EXT . PHOENIX SKYLINE - DAY \nThe domes and spires glint in the sunlight. We isolate a glass steeple. A crosshatch insignia. A legend \"Sanger Industries\". \n150   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY \nA corner office with a panoramic view of the city. Crowne sits at a console desk, reviewing some data on a holoframe screen. A knock on the door and HER SECRETARY enters, looking unsettled- \nSECRETARY I just thought I should warn you. I have a sponsor holding. His name's Thomas Lincoln. He sounded... angry. \n151   EXT. STREET TUNNEL - DAY \nThe shaman's chanting suddenly stops. He is looking directly at Lincoln, pointing. His face, contorting with what might be anger or fear. He starts babbling in dialect, ardently. Lincoln frowns in confusion. Grey Dove quietly draws him away from the mound. \n162   INT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER \nEster stirs from slumber. On the ground beside her, she finds a bowl of food and a water gallon. Now through the gloom, she sees Lincoln, sitting on the stool like he never left, keeping vigil. Something seems different about him as he turns, registering her- \nLINCOLN A r e you alright? \nESTER I feel better after I sleep. \nLincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway. Ester moves closer, sensing something. He speaks as if from far away- \nLINCOLN The man out there... he said everything has a spirit... every living thing... but not... \nHis voice cuts off. Ester looks at him, recognizing his pain. She doesn't understand what it is or what caused it. It's pain and it evokes a response in her. A feeling, taking her over. Her hand reaches out and strokes his hair. Lincoln looks up at her, questioning. With supreme knowing, Ester leans down and kisses him. At the touch of her lips, Lincoln pauses. The first kiss for both of them but Ester takes it in her stride. The calm ballet of nature. Fluidly peeling off her shirt, breasts steeping with moonlight. Lincoln rising to face her, feeling her proximity, her radiant heat. His fingers touching her breasts. Ester trembling, her lips once more finding his. Lincoln closing his eyes, the rush of sensation, overwhelming. He yields to it, returning the kiss, with hunger, with passion... with spirit. \n163   EXT . THE INTERSTATE - DAWN \nThe sun rises in the east, depicting the traffic in silhouette. A vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where the skiff sits abandoned. The grey cutter pulls to a halt. \n164   EXT . HARD SHOULDER - DAWN \nD i g g s and Burdon move up on the skiff, cover positions, weapons levelled. Burdon spins in to the driver side, snapping aim with the thunderbolt. But the skiff is empty. The only sign of life is the interface, flashing red: \"REMOTE LOCATOR TRANSMITTING\". \nB u r d o n exchanges a look with Diggs. No dice. Diggs reaches in his pocket and pulls out what looks like an electronic telescope. He puts it to his eye and pans the salt flats. Burdon crouches at the roadside, looking for tracks. Then Diggs fixes on something- \nDIGGS I got thermals. \n165   EXT . PLATFORM MOUND - SUNRISE \nThe fire is now reduced to a heap of embers. The tribespeople a r e asleep around the mound, wrapped in ethnic blankets. Diggs and Burdon move up stealthily, weapons at the ready. The horses bristle and snort, betraying their approach. The tribespeople, stirred by the noise, awake. Diggs and Burdon swing aim around the ring as faces rise and stare at them. None of the faces have white skin. Diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the gathering- \nDIGGS I'm looking for two bond runners. They ditched near here last night. \nDIGGS (cont'd) One man, one woman. Tattoos on the forehead... (nothing, just silent stares) Anyone's seen them, I got fifty green. (still nothing, aggravated) What the fuck are you? Deaf and dumb? \nThe tribal faces just keep staring. Diggs scowls. Then suddenly swings aim with the rainmaker and fires. -BOOM- hitting one of the horses in the haunch. It rears up, whinnying, setting off the rest of the horses. Diggs turns back to the gathering- \nDIGGS Somebody start talking. \nHe scans around the ring. Then fixes on one of the women. She lifts a trembling finger to a man nearby. Grey Dove stiffens. \n166   EXT . SALT MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE \nThe sunrise depicts two silhouettes, moving across the ridge. Lincoln and Ester clamber over the calcified rocks. Ester now stops to catch her breath. She is wheezing again, fighting for air. As Lincoln looks on with concern, she musters a brave smile- \nESTER I can make it. \n167   EXT . SALT CANYON - EARLY MORNING \nA freight barge whooshes through the canyon, trailing a chain of low, arched containers, capacious in width rather than height. The conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider, deeper, known as a \"lode-canal\". At each end of the canyon, it intersects with other lode-canals, converging to use the same passage, a system of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic. High above, on the south rim of the canyon, we find Lincoln and Ester. Ester is no longer wheezing but rasping. She looks down at the passing vessel, daunted. Lincoln offers her small comfort- \nLINCOLN Don't worry. The one we want goes the other way. He said it goes slower. \nThey exchange a smile. The chain of containers tailing off, the barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon. \n168   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING \nLincoln and Ester descend the rocky slope toward the lode-canal. Ester stops, having to catch her breath every few steps. Lincoln tries to hide his concern, looking away towards the sunrise. The westbound vessel will be coming soon. \nThey just need to get out of state... Now he frowns, sensing something. Faint but growing. His jaw clenches. His face tightens. His pupils start to dilate. \n169   EXT . THE NORTH RIDGE - MORNING \nThe north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the grey cutter pulling up. Diggs and Burdon get out and look down into the canyon. Diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning. Burdon peels off his jacket. It's early but it's already getting hot. Diggs now pauses, handing him the scope for his opinion- \nDIGGS Up there in the rocks. Three o'clock. I'm not sure... it could be ambient. \n170   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING \nLincoln and Ester hide in the shadow of a rock. Ester is muffling her breaths as best she can. Lincoln now hazards a look over the top. Two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon, now pointing in their direction. He ducks back, assimilating. Hiding, no longer an option. Nor running, at least for Ester. His face sets in a grimace of conviction. His eyes glow darkly. \n171   EXT . THE NORTH FACE - MORNING \nDiggs and Burdon reach the foot of the rocks. Neither speaks, communicating in hand-signals. Diggs slips into the lode-canal. Burdon covers, sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face. \nDiggs emerges from the far side of the lode-canal. He stays low, moving up into the rocks. Then, from above, a rock dislodges, rattling down. Diggs reacts instantly, targeting, opening fire- \n- B O O M - B O O M - The shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock. The thunderbolt now adding to the barrage, Burdon firing from the far side - SHOTS, BOLTS, KICKING UP A STORM OF DUST -- SUDDENLY HOLDING FIRE, waiting for the dust to clear, reloading. No sign of movement. Just a slide of rubble. Fading echoes. \nD I G G S STEALS ONWARDS UP THE ROCKS - into the fog of dust - the sunlight and shadow playing tricks on his eyes - then suddenly- LINCOLN BURSTS OUT OF THE DUST - from the left - tackling the pale man - both of them toppling - tumbling down the slope -- \nTHUDDING TO A HALT at the lip of the lode-canal - the rainmaker lost in the fall - the impact throwing up a billow of dust -- THE DUSTCLOUD - Diggs and Lincoln struggling, clawing, punching - Lincoln, with surprise on his side, gaining with the upper hand-- \nDIGGS' CLAWING FINGERS discover Lincoln's knife - tugging it from his jacket - Lincoln grabbing his wrist, fighting for control - THE KNIFE MOVING BETWEEN THEM - Diggs with better leverage - the blade inching towards Lincoln's face - pressing into his cheek-- \nLINCOLN'S EYES - welling black, almost inhuman - the sense of danger screaming in his ears - he grabs the pale man's throat - DIGGS' EYES - bulging as he strains to push the knife home - oxygen draining - conscious ebbing - he slumps back - \nLINCOLN REGAINS THE KNIFE - the pale man seems to be out cold - but he's not sure - he pauses holding the blade over him, then-- - B O O M - THE KNIFE FLIES FROM HIS GRIP IN A BURST OF DISCHARGE - \nA slant of light falls across Ester, writhing in her sleep, rasping. Katherine and Lincoln peer in through the doorway, checking on her. Then Katherine quietly closes the door. \n181   INT . KATHERINE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLincoln paces around, feeling useless. Katherine considers him- \nKATHERINE What do I call you? \nLINCOLN Lincoln . My name's Lincoln. \nKATHERINE Lincoln , I think she needs professional help. I think she needs to see a doctor. \nLINCOLN N o . They'll find her. They'll take her. \nKATHERINE N o t if I don't want them to. \nLINCOLN You don't understand. They don't want people to know about her. Either of us. \nKATHERINE The doctor I'm thinking of, he's an old friend. He look after John in t h e final stages. I trust him. \nLINCOLN Why ? So you can take her baby? \nKATHERINE N o . No, that's not what I want. O f f Lincoln's blunt look, she sighs, lowering into a chair. \nKATHERINE M a y b e I didn't realize she'd      be so... ( c u t s off, a deep pause) M a y b e I just didn't want to.      Either way, I was wrong. I want you          to know that. I was wrong... And I'm          sorry. \nA heavy lull. Lincoln hangs his head, remembering. \nLINCOLN The y make you believe there's a place called The Island. Then they take you upstairs and put you to sleep. They cut you open. They take pieces of you. \nKatherine looks at him, intuiting. She allows a pause, then- \nKATHERINE E v e n if I had taken her baby, I swear to you, I'd never have... They give you a choice, you see, to extend the sponsorship after... after d e l i v e r y . \nLINCOLN N o . I saw a lot of us go to The Island. But I never saw anyone come back. \nKATHERINE You mean... Even if I had extended the sponsorship, they'd have... and kept taking the money? But that's inhuman. \nLINCOLN ( b e a t , a lost look) Is it? I wouldn't know. \n182   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - EVENING \nA sleek low vehicle known as a \"straker\" pulls down the ramp. \n183   INT . APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING \nThe orbs on the doors eyeball Scheer, moving up the corridor. He stops at a doorway. Rings the bell. Tom Lincoln opens the door- \nTOM Yes? \nSCHEER I'm from the Sanger Institute. \nTOM I've given you people enough of my time already. \nSCHEER I t ' s just a formality. I need to see your sponsorship contract. \nT o m pauses then lets Scheer inside. He crosses to the wall safe, taps the keys. Then pulls out the contract folder. He offers it. \nSCHEER Is this the only copy? \nTOM Why would I make copies? Do you think I want anyone else to know about this? \nS c h e e r accepts the folder. As Tom turns to close the safe, he sets it down. And grabs Tom from behind, by the scalp, pressing the syringe-gun into his jugular. A HISS. Tom clutches his throat like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers forward. Sweating, collapsing. Convulsing, belching steam. Then falling slack. His skin starts to smolder. Scheer pauses, then tosses t h e contract folder on top of him, leaving it to burn with him. \n184   EXT. NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - PHOENIX - NIGHT \nE s t a b l i s h i n g . A clean facade of white steel and glass. A hatch- b a c k vehicle known as a \"corsair\" pulls down the parking ramp. \n185   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nThe corsair pulls up at the ER entrance, Lincoln at the wheel. Katherine gets out of the passenger side. A doctor is waiting - 50's, caring face. His name is DR. ABRAMS. He looks curiously at the man at the wheel. Then greets Katherine with a hug - \nD R . ABRAMS Katherine . . . It's good to see you. I haven't seen you since John's funeral. \nKATHERINE We l l I've been keeping busy. Trying to. Thanks for coming down to meet me. \nD R . ABRAMS Your call was a little cryptic. What is it exactly that's wrong with you? \nKATHERINE I t ' s not me... Not exactly. \nShe opens the rear door of the corsair. Ester is lying on the back seat. Dr. Abrams frowns as he notices the resemblance. \n186   EXT . THE RANCH HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT \nThe straker p u l l s up into the port. \n187   INT . THE STUDIO / MAIN HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT \nThe shadow of Scheer moving outside the windows, looking for a point of entry. He inspects the studio door for alarms. Then elbows the glass. Reaching inside, turning the lock. He enters the studio, glancing at the sculptures. Moving through the home. \nSCHEER RECOVERING - seeing his quarry through the confusion - no time for subtlety - he leaps over the nurse's station - pursuing- LINCOLN pauses at the emergency exit - checking to see his enemy is following - then pushing on through the doors into-- \n194   INT . STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nLINCOLN HAMMERS DOWN THE STEPS - an alarm sounding - shouting from beyond - FOOTFALLS BEHIND HIM - deeper into the gloom- \nS C H E E R VAULTING THE RAIL - shortcutting t h e flights of steps - catching sight of his quarry as he pushes through a door into-- \n195   INT .

ENTRANCE - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT \nThe straker p u l l s up at the smashed gate arm. In the booth, a holoserve p a r k i n g attendant greets the arrival with a smile- \nP A R K I N G ATTENDANT We l c o m e to Holspar S t a d i u m , home of the Phoenix Admirals, parking is fifteen currency units... \nScheer gets out of the straker. He looks down at the crashsite b e l o w . The parking lot, like a marina, is filled to capacity. A game is in progress. A corona of light coming from the stadium. Hoots, music, the roaring crowd. Over which, sirens can now be heard. Scheer draws the syringe-gun and heads down the ramp. \n199   EXT . PARKING LOT - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER \nD u s t blooms from the crashsite. S c h e e r crouches, peering down at the wrecked corsair. The burst windshield, the dangling driver side door shows his quarry has escaped the wreckage. He rises and scans around. On the concrete, a trail of blood is visible. \n200   INT . STORAGE AREA - HOLSPAR STADIUM - MINUTES LATER \nThe blood trail leads down a gloomy stairwell. The game is just audible overhead. Lincoln stumbles down the steps, clutching his bleeding arm. Between pain and concussion, he loses his footing and falls. He tumbles down the remaining steps to the bottom. \nI n the gloom we   see groundskeeping e q u i p m e n t , supplies - edgers, aerators, spray    rigs, drums of insecticides, herbicides. For a moment, Lincoln    lies stunned. Then hears a noise and rolls over. He looks up the    stairwell. A shadow is descending towards him. \nW i t h painful effort, Lincoln starts crawling across the floor, eyes fixed on the shadow. Tensing as A HANDGUN noses out of the darkness. Then A STADIUM SECURITY GUARD steps into the light - \nS E C U R I T Y GUARD You , what are you doing down here? \nN o w he sees Lincoln more closely - injured, his arm bleeding. \nS E C U R I T Y GUARD O h , Jesus... Are you okay, son? \nLincoln eases a little as he sees the security guard lower his weapon. Then suddenly the guard is JERKED BACK BY THE SCALP. A HISS. Now suddenly the guard jettisons the handgun, clutching his throat like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers forward. Streaming with sweat. Toppling across a herbicide drum. Convulsing, belching steam. Then suddenly his body falls slack. S c h e e r is at the foot of the steps, discarding the spent ampule from the syringe-gun. Now screwing a fresh ampule into place. \nLincoln turns to him, realizing what he's just witnessed is a glimpse of his own fate. He pushes himself upright, bracing. S c h e e r looks at him. Clutching his bloody arm, barely able to stay upright, but still ready to fight for life. He half-smiles- \nSCHEER I'm jealous of you. You have a reason to live. I can't say I've ever had that... \nLincoln holds his gaze, looking deep in his eyes. Then, as if scared by what he sees there, starts inching away, glancing at-- \nD R . ABRAMS J u s t understand that I've put a lot on the line for you, Katherine. \nKATHERINE I know... But it felt good. It felt like something John would have done. \n205   INT . ROOFTOP FLIGHTPAD - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER \nC r o w n e escorts Sanger and Merrick to the waiting whisper. \nCROWNE We l l , I don't know about the two of you but I'd say we got off lightly. \nDR. SANGER Did we? \nCROWNE Don't start getting maudlin, Henry. It's a little too late in the game. \nShe shakes their hands as they climb into the whisper. Then watches it take off, ascending into the blinding sunlight. \nD I S S O L V E TO: 206   EXT . THE SANGER INSTITUTE - SOME WEEKS LATER \nA i r blasts up from the giant funnel. Widening, we re-establish the huge ring, the processing plant, the giant appendages of ducting, the immutable red rocks. The shot sequence, reprising. From the processing plant, over the main complex. From the front of the complex, to the dock. \nFollowing the lodeway out to the perimeter wall. The gateway now gliding open to disclose a view of the shimmering desert. Out in the distance, the institute liner emerging from the shimmer. The crosshatch insignia. \n207   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY \nT h r o u g h the polarized glass we see the liner has docked. A TOUR GROUP is disembarking. Another parade of plutocracy, aging bloated me and brittle young women. They filter inside to be greeted by the courtesy staff, led by the ever-perky LYDIA. \nLYDIA L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia and on behalf of our staff, I'd like t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute. Before we start the tour, we'll be serv- i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center and circulating our standard discretion agreements. I should add that today you are all very lucky because our CEO and founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us and will be leading the tour personally. \n208   INT . VISITOR CENTER - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY \nThe tour group pick and mingle at a buffet. We isolate a casually dressed man, lightly bearded, in a Phoenix Admirals cap, crossing to Lydia. She turns to greet him with a smile- \nLYDIA Yes . . . Mr. Thomas, isn't it? The man tilts up to reveal his face. We see he is LINCOLN... \nLINCOLN I can't find my sunglasses. I think I left them on the shuttle. \nLYDIA We l l we're about to start the tour. But I can have someone check for you. \nLINCOLN Don't worry. I'll catch up. \n209   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - DAY \nLincoln moves quickly along the wall towards the back of the complex. Hugging the shadows, scanning for onlookers. There is the processing plant and there, the ring of funnels. The sight brings a sudden rush of memories, painful memories, horrors. \nLincoln steels himself, then breaks from shadow and races for the nearest funnel. He makes a running lap. His fingers grab t h e lip of the funnel and he pulls himself up. Reaching the lip, he finds the funnel mouth has been gridded o v e r . Then he hears- \nA VOICE (O.S.) S i r , this is a restricted area... \nLincoln lowers back to the ground. He finds himself facing A TECHNICIAN in a hardhat. His uniform reads \"Air Processing\". \n210   INT . ELEVATOR - PROCESSING PLANT \nThe doors slide open and the technician enters, stiffly. Then suddenly topples forward, pistol whipped from behind. Lincoln enters the elevator, a familiar handgun clenched in his fist. \n211   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT \nL o o k i n g up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles, rippling downward as the elevator descends from the surface. \n212   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING \nLincoln is now wearing the technician's uniform. He watches the panel lights flashing down. \"Level 3: Harvest\" \"Level 5: Labor Decon\", \"Level 7: Labor Quarters\". His pupils are dilating but his face is set with determination. He knows what he must do. His gaze drifts down to \"Level Twenty: Agnate Containment\". \n213   INT . THE ETHER GRID \nThe holographic rendering of containment spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom. The ether blinks with blue dots in their hundreds as the agnates g o about their day. \n214   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM \nO v e r l o o k i n g the ether, Ethercon sits at his console. The hiss of an opening door as someone enters. Ethercon looks round. He greets the technician's arrival with an inquisitive look. Then the technician takes off his hardhat. A crosshatch on his brow. Ethercon reacts almost instantly, reaching for the console. Then instantly freezes as Lincoln presses the handgun to his skull. \n215   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN \nP a l e blue light. Ethercon leads the way down a silent corridor. Lincoln follows him, the handgun firmly levelled on his head. \n216   INT. CHAMBER - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN \nThe pale blue light sustains. The chamber is reminiscent of the foundation chambers. The walls lined with tanks. But instead of amber fluid, these contain blocks of ice. Beside each tank is a grid of bio-monitors. E t h e r c o n stumbles into frame, prodded by Lincoln. Then, with a trembling finger points to one of the tanks. Lincoln holds aim on him and considers the glass facet. He wipes the condensation off the glass. Suspended in the block of ice is a shadow. A human figure. A device is attached to his stomach. Lincoln looks at the bio-monitors. A screen reads: \n\" P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER/ FOUNDATION: II/ GENERATION: DELTA\". \nLincoln looks across the EKG, the cardiograph, indications that Starkweather is still alive. Then he fixes on the RFI m o n i t o r . A resonant image of the brain. The shifting aura showing a level of consciousness. What thoughts must be going through that mind? The fate of the agnates s p a r e d from expiration. To be kept on i c e for future harvest. With a haggard look, Lincoln rests his hand on the glass where Starkweather hangs frozen. Connecting. \n217   INT . SALES HALL - THE INSTITUTE - DAY \nAn embryo in mutated effigy hangs suspended in the amber fluid. Dr. Sanger stands at the wall of display tanks, mid-way through his sales pitch. He delivers it now with noticeably less gusto- \nDR. SANGER C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the beginning, the mapping of the human genome was declared a historic landmark- to break the curse of heredity, to correct congenital defect... genetic engineering became the brave new world of medical science. A bright future that led to a dark age and much of... ( a n abrupt pause, a frown) . . . l e g i s l a t i o n we know today. But while the clone laws may have narrowed the field, science marches on.

You hooked the wrong one! He crouches to examine Lincoln. Blood is blossoming from a wound on his shoulder, jutting from which is a projectile. The censor presses its base and it snaps loose of its unintended target. \nN o w we see the projectile more clearly. A fat metal pellet, snub- n o s e d , finned at the tail by four metal teeth. On impact, the nose recesses to release a springload a n d the teeth snap forward to bite into the target. This device is known as a \"hookhead\". \nCENSOR J u s t a flesh wound. `Hit his head pretty hard. Possible concussion. ( i n s p e c t i n g Lincoln's pupils) T h i n k you can walk, buddy? \nLincoln nods slightly. The censor unloops a tri-key f r o m his neck- \nCENSOR You see this? It'll get you past the lockdown. You're to report to The Medical Center. You understand? \nO f f Lincoln's blank stare, the censor presses the tri-key i n t o his palm. Then departs. Lincoln stays where he sits, still dazed from the concussion. Absently he watches the censors race off up the walkway, dissolving back into the purple haze as we- \nC U T TO: \n45   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM S T A R K W E A T H E R RUNNING. Meeting white uniforms at every turn, zig- z a g g i n g o v e r crosswalks, down ramps. The rat in the maze, dumb to its inevitable destination. Widening, we see we are watching the action on etherview, racking and dollying like a deific e y e . \nE T H E R C O N (INTO HEADSET) E a s t side team hold position. Subject headed for the second floor crossramp. \n46   INT . GROUND FLOOR - RESIDENTIAL BLOCK C l o a k e d in shadow, Scheer listens to the play-by-play on headset. With a tap, he changes the channel, whispering to his squad- \nS C H E E R (INTO HEADSET) G i v e him some space. I have him. A N O T H E R ANGLE: Starkweather hits the deck running, sprinting up the avenue. In BG, Scheer steps forth, stopgun l e v e l l e d , aiming-- \n-BOOM- The flash of the muzzle, the shrill wail of the hookhead. \n- T H U D - Starkweather jolts as the shot hits him square in the back, arching as the hookhead b i t e s ; but he keeps on running- \n- B O O M - B O O M - B O O M - Scheer unleashes his ordnance, filling the air. \n- T H U D - T H U D - T H U D - Starkweather jolts from one, two, three more hits; hookheads b i t i n g , spraying blood; but he keeps on running. S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET) A l l clear. Flood the area. \nA N O T H E R ANGLE; Floor level, as between the tiles, tiny red lights start blinking, rippling forward in a wave. Known as \"lode-pins\" their small magnetic pulses accumulate into a low level stream. \nThe hookheads c l a w e d in Starkweather's back also start blinking red. The invisible stream flowing beneath his feet, Starkweather feels its force. The duelling polarities stealing his traction. His run reducing to a slipsliding s t a g g e r . Then his feet leave the ground. He flails for a handhold. But there's nothing. The force lifts him a foot clear off the ground before balancing out to dangle him in mid-air, squirming about like a fish on a hook. \nA N O T H E R ANGLE; Scheer advances to reel in his catch. The stream bows before him, red lights blinking out. Until all that remains is the section where Starkweather hangs suspended. Scheer stops at its limit, looking up at him like some curious zoo exhibit. \nS C H E E R (INTO HEADSET) H o o d him, cuff him, patch the bleed. Then let's get him up to Level Three. A N O T H E R ANGLE: looking down from high above as the Censors move in on Starkweather. Scheer now walking away, tapping his headset- \nS C H E E R (INTO HEADSET) E t h e r c o n ? Send word to dispatch. Starkweather Two-Delta is secured. \nR E V E R S E ANGLE: Lincoln in CU, looking down. He has seen and heard all that has just passed. In his eyes, we see his daze clearing, consciousness coalescing, deepening. His pupils dilating into a deep and uncanny stare. What can only be described as a dawning. 47   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - LATER \nN o w full but unusually quiet. Residents sit in whispered, anxious discourse. The news of the incident is spreading. Off a series of chimes, eyes turn to the glass wall, now pixellating i n t o an outsider's face - calm, official. THE COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER begins- \nCOMMUNITY ANNOUNCER Good morning - this is a community bulletin... Following an incident in Sector Four earlier this morning, The Department of Sanitation is issuing an all-sector contamination warning... \nTRACKING the rapt concern of the residents, Ester among them. \nCOMMUNITY ANNOUNCER The incident involved a resident found to be infected with a pathogen. While the risk is assessed, residents are advised to be aware of the symptoms. Should you experience aberrant levels of anxiety or witness it in others, immediately contact The Medical Center. \n48   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE \nThe proxy of Starkweather spins over the desk. Merrick regards i t with a frown. Scheer sits turning the ethercuff i n his fingers with a demeanor of cool curiosity. Underneath, he's rattled. \nSCHEER You want to tell me what's going on? \nMERRICK There's nothing going on, Karl. \nSCHEER I'm jaded. Not stupid. \nMERRICK What's your point? \n", "test1_true": "MERRICK You're jumping to conclusions. \nSCHEER Once I can overlook. Twice I can call coincidence. Three times I start giving a shit. Because if these products are defective... \nMERRICK Q u a l i t y control is not your concern. \nSCHEER S o it is a quality control issue? \nMERRICK That's not what I said. \nSCHEER He was in the subway tunnels for two days. In the dark, no food, no water. His fingers were scraped to the bone. He was trying to dig his way out. Now you try to explain to me why that is. \nHis look says he smells a rat. Merrick weighs him a moment. Then sighs, a little depleted. He gets up and crosses to the glass wall. Looks down on the avenue, at the agnates m i l l i n g beneath. \nMERRICK It's not an exact science - biogenesis. There's a degree of trial and error. If the agnate doesn't come together on the first pass, we have to abort and start over. It's like breaking inertia. The bioreactor, the growth medium - we just keep upping the levels till we achieve integration. At which stage the agnate is deemed physically stable. We rely on foundation to provide mental stability - matching the templates to their capacity but walling it in with parameters. ( b e a t , considers the proxy) When signs of instability started to show up, it pointed to foundation. A hole in the wall, an oversight. But it was only happening in the later generat- ions . Which pointed back to biogenesis. \nSCHEER So there was a production defect. \nMERRICK Actually the opposite. We found out in the later generations, the levels were so high that when we broke inertia, the process kept going. Over-integrating. Specifically the neural system. It produced a condition called synesthesia. \nSCHEER Synesthesia... \nMERRICK A fusion of the senses, creating a component awareness. Sixth sense, s e c o n d sight, whatever you want to call it. Its emergence seems to be arbitrary. But it gives them experiences beyond their functional parameters. And ultimately... it destabilizes them. However, if we catch it early enough we can control it with re-conditioning. \nScheer absorbs this with a slow grin. Merrick looks puzzled. \nMERRICK You find this amusing? \nSCHEER Poetic. \nMERRICK Poetic? \nSCHEER This \"agnate\" took off just before his sponsor placed an order. Maybe he got the sense his days were numbered... \nMerrick ' s composure cracks a little. He hadn't thought of this. \nMERRICK This stays between you and me, Karl. I trust I can rely on your cooperation? \nSCHEER Don't you mean my complicity? \nMERRICK (hardening again) Remind me, why is it you were discharged from the military? \nSCHEER What's your point? \nMERRICK Learn to be a team player, Karl. Or you'll find yourself out of another job. \nScheer rises, discarding the ethercuff onto Merrick's desk. \nSCHEER Nobody else would take it. \n49   INT. EXTRACTOR SHAFT \nThe deep steady thrum of the extractor fans. We are TIGHT ON the frame of an airlock. Hissing, it indents and opens. Lincoln steps through, eyes black and uncanny. The tri-key g l i n t i n g , dangling from his fingers. Scanning around, he fixes on a section of wall. He wipes off some soot. Legible beneath is a number. Twenty. He assimilates this. Then turns his gaze up the extractor shaft. \n50   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT \nLooking up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles, rippling downward as an elevator descends from the surface. \n51   INT . OUTER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE \nA tiled chamber. Draped off cubicles. The elevator doors slide open. An outsider emerges, dressed in a flightsuit, emblazoned \"Medical Courier\". He announces himself, seemingly to no one- \nT H E COURIER Clearance code: NG-230-2DS. \nV O I C E ON SPEAKER New Gaza Healthcare. Okay, you're clear. Go ahead and get undressed. \n52   INT . DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER \nThe pressure door hisses, heaving open. The courier steps inside, naked, covering his genitals, some goggles slung around his neck. He takes position on two marked footpads and puts on the goggles- \nT H E COURIER I tell you, I hate this fucking r u n . I always leave this place with sunburn. \nV O I C E ON SPEAKER Try full-course decontamination. It's even more fun. Especially the colonics. \nThe lights blink out. A red glow rises. Twin planes of light scrape across the courier, infra-red, searing his epidermis. \n53   INT . INNER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE \nA chamber like the first. The inner pressure door hisses open. The courier emerges, dripping wet from a decon s h o w e r . He goes to a cubicle, grabbing a towel and dries himself off. Laid out within are some scrubs. Beside them is A STEEL COOLER, inset with a thermostat and embossed with the crosshatch insignia. \n54   INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE \nThe courier strolls up the corridor, now dressed in the scrubs and carrying the cooler. He turns a corner and his footsteps gradually fade out. A flat, sterile silence falls in his wake. \nA metal squeal. A ventilation grid levers down from the ceiling. A pause. Then a pair of feet drop through, legs, torso. Dropping to the floor, Lincoln stands revealed. Sweaty, smeared black with dust. For a moment he looks around to get his bearings. Suddenly he freezes, hearing- \nA VOICE (O.S.) C h e c k in at the nurse's station. Up the corridor, left, then first right. \n", "test2_input": "B U R D O N WATCHING from the sidewalk where Lincoln and Ester first dropped, scouring the trench for a sight of them. Now he spots them, climbing up onto the sidewalk the far side of the street. \nD i g g s now arrives at his side, sweating, out of breath. Now seeing their quarry take off up the far side of the street, he turns to his lumberous p a r t n e t , fury mixed with incredulity- \nDIGGS Why the fuck d i d n ' t you go after them?! \nB u r d o n just looks at him, displaying the metal brace on his fore- a r m . Diggs, out of sheer frustration, gives him a pounding shove- \nDIGGS Fuck! \n115   EXT . ALLEY - DAY The refuge of shadow. The alley is divided by a lodeway and the walls on each side are jutted with dumpsters. Lincoln and Ester run up the narrowed strip of sidewalk, forced into single file. \nA huge shape looms ahead. A garbage vehicle known as a \"scow\". Like a leviathan spreading its tentacles, the scow's tube-arrays dock with the dumpsters and start sucking the contents out. \nLincoln glances back to find Ester has stopped and is cringing away from the tentacled monster. He returns to her, his eyes flicking around, aware that their real predators are close- \nLINCOLN We have to keep going. \nHe takes Ester's hand, drawing her onward. But Ester recoils, shaking off his grip. Now he looks at her more closely. She's panting, shuddering, fraught with trauma. Her voice is haunted- \nESTER P l e a s e . . . Please, I want to go back... She shrinks into the shadows, shaking her head. The hatchling wanting to return to the nest. Lincoln meets her eye, deeply- \nLINCOLN T h o s e men - that's what they want too. Ester holds his gaze, chest heaving. Then looks back towards the alley mouth. Her fingers reach for her belly, clawing a little. Then her eyes lower, assimilating, reason reasserting its heavy grip. Lincoln senses her turmoil. His voice is soft but sturdy- \nLINCOLN We have to keep going, Ester. \nEster looks up at him again. The forlorn air seems to have faded. Her eyes, grimly set. Her face, a little haggard. Older somehow. She takes Lincoln's hand and together they head off up the alley. \n116   EXT . ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER \nThe alley mouth darkens as a vehicle turns off the street. The grey cutter moves through the shadows, prowling and shark-like. \n117   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING \nThe drone of resistors. The throbbing glow of the drive console, a panoply of instrumentation. Burdon steers in silence, Diggs beside him, edgy, intent, combing the shadows for their quarry. \nDIGGS S u n n a v a b i t c h ! What the fuck d o we do now, huh? They could be anywhere... \nBURDON We go back to the office and run `em. \nDIGGS A s what? John and Jane Doe? \nBURDON We ask the guy. \nDIGGS Y e a h , let's tell him we couldn't hack it in kindergarten. See how long him and his ten platinum stick around. \nHe fires a barbed look. Burdon absorbs this, unflinched, thinking- \nBURDON I t was blue, right? \nDIGGS What? \nBURDON The y were using a blue currency card. \n118   EXT . STREET - DAY \nLincoln and Ester walk up the street. Wary of attention, they go with the flow of figures, eyes peeled for predators. The sights of the city now seem hostile. Faces flash past, dead-eyed in sun- g l a s s e s . Traffic rushes like steel rapids. Storefronts construct a black wall. Holoframe b i l l b o a r d s loom, mocking, half-noticed: \n- - A woman in a bathroom, adjusting her sexy neglige; a crack in the door shows a man in bed, waiting; the woman closes the door and picks up what looks like a toothpaste tube; she arches her eyebrow; \"F.I.G. F e m i n i n e Impulse Gel... Because who needs him?\" - - A cemetery under a grim overcast sky; suddenly a frisbee flies across frame; an old woman, dressed like a teenager, catches it; she tosses it to an old man dressed likewise; a text super \"Death Sucks!\", a sting, \"New Gaza Healthcare: Your Life Is Our Life.\" Lincoln and Ester stop at the corner. They look around, blindly, no coordinates, no frame of reference. Urban canyons, identical, gordian a n d chasmic. P a s s i n g figures jostle. Then Lincoln spots something across the street. It looks like an over-sized phone booth. Its beacon flashes; \"C.I.N. - CITY INFORMATION NETWORK.\" \n119   INT . CIN BOOTH - DAY \nA flourish of music greets Lincoln and Ester as they enter. The fanfare conjures a holoform i n mid-air. A cartoon rattlesnake, benignly rendered, welcomes them with a clownish, fanged smile: \nTHE SNAKE H i there! I'm Tattletail! What e v e r you want to know, wherever you want to go, I got the answers! Let's look at the menu! \nA set of text frames appear: \"Residential Listings\", \"Business Listings\", \"Transport Listings\", \"Hotel Listings\". Lincoln assimilates. The terminologies are not unfamiliar. \nTHE SNAKE (CONT'D) N o w let's make a selection! \nLINCOLN ( b e a t , venturing) Transport... THE SNAKE O k a y ! Let me open that directory for you! I'll be with you in two shakes! \nThe snake rattles accordingly and coils in a holding pattern. Then a tomographic map of the city appears. A red dot plants itself under a text flag \"You Are Here!\". Then other red dots scatter across the map, each flagging with transportation icons. \n120   INT. CUTTER - STREETS - DRIVING - DAY \nB u r d o n steers calmly, scanning the streets. Diggs impatiently bashes the keys of a holocom on the drive console. A holoframe hovers, snowed with static. Then a secretary's face appears - sagging, older, primped and painted young. Her name is JANEEN- \nJ A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM) D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency. \nDIGGS J a n e e n , where the fuck have you been? \nJ A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM) B e a u t y therapy.

BUS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON \nA surging sound. A surface of water. A burst of spray. A dolphin leaps from the waves and hangs suspended. Text scrolls around: \"Get Out Of State & Out Of Mind - Ride the Grey Dolphin Line!\" This is the next incarnation of the greyhound. The blue facade, crested into waves. We make out Lincoln and Ester, now looking more like transients than tourists, dirty, worn and exhausted. \n122   INT. CONCOURSE - BUS STATION \nLow roof. Flat lighting. The faces here seem less threatening, the young and the low-income. Lincoln and Ester look around. Not unlike the train terminal. People standing in line, transacting. \n123   INT . TICKET WINDOW \nLincoln and Ester step up to the ticket window. A TICKET CLERK - male, immaculately groomed - greets them with a polished smile. \nT I C K E T CLERK We l c o m e to Grey Dolphin Bus Lines. What is your destination, please? \nLincoln squints at him. Then wafts his hand across the counter. The ticket clerk flinches at the impact. Then composes himself. A trace of camp as he smiles bashfully at the rugged customer- \nT I C K E T CLERK I t ' s okay. Really. I get that a lot. I'm sorry, now where were we again? \nLINCOLN I want to get out of state. Now. \nT I C K E T CLERK B e l i e v e me, I know how you feel. So where did you want to go exactly? \nLINCOLN O u t of state... T I C K E T CLERK J u s t wherever the wind takes you, huh? \nLINCOLN Where's that? \nT I C K E T CLERK We l l , if it was me, out to the west coast. It's perfect this time of year. \nLincoln nods, liking the sound of this. The ticket clerk smiles, enjoying the acceptance of his suggestion, he ventures hopefully- \nT I C K E T CLERK T r a v e l l i n g alone, are we? \nLINCOLN N o . With her. \nHe gestures, then realizes Ester is gone from his side again. \nHe scans the faces. The clerk, disappointed, taps some keys. \nT I C K E T COLLECTOR T w o adults, let me see... I'm afraid I can't get you seats till the morning. \n124   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - BUS STATION \nA grill bar. A rank of vending machines. Ester moves through the seating area as if drawn. Now over the ambient noise, we isolate the cry of a baby. Ester is following the sound to its source. She finds a Mexican woman shushing her infant. The woman looks up and smiles. Ester just stands there, awe-struck. Lincoln now comes up to reclaim her. He's about to ask why she wandered off when she turns to him. He sees her eyes are brimming with tears. Tears of joy and sorrow. It's the first time she's seen a baby. \n125   EXT . STREET - DUSK \nThe winged pig flutters over the doors of \"Hog Heaven\". The milling customers are suddenly parted by Diggs, bursting out through the doors. He leaps into the grey cutter, parked kerbside. I t peels out with a flash of its halogen eyes. \n126   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - DUSK \nB u r d o n steers, glancing inquisitively at his partner. Diggs taps the holocom, urgently, galvanized. The holoframe resolves snowed with static. Janeen's face appears. Less primped, disgruntled- \nJ A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM) D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency. \nDIGGS We got a positive on the serial number. Punch in and pull up the transactions. Start with the last hour and work back. \nJANEEN G r e a t . So I got to park my ass in front of a screen all night? \nDIGGS I t ' s a platinum bond, Janeen. We get this, I'll buy you a new ass, okay? \nHe grins at Burdon. The thrill of the chase glows in his eyes. \n127   INT . WAITING AREA - BUS STATION - NIGHT \nA blue glass partition wall looks out onto the depot. More like a marina with an embarcadero a n d a row of docks. \"Liners\" slot in and out, their nautical trim making them seem like ferries. \nLincoln and Ester sit waiting. Lincoln, rigid, watchful. Ester, gazing across at the Mexican woman, who as the infant cradled asleep. Ester glances wistfully at Lincoln. Then she frowns- \nESTER Lincoln , what is that? On your face? \nLincoln turns, touching his face. He feels stubble there. For the first time. His body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural to him. Ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek. Lincoln stiffens a little, unused to this type of contact. But her touch is gentle and the contact is warming. Their eyes slowly meet, flickering, something passing between them. Then Ester's face contorts slightly. She emits a shallow cough. \nLINCOLN A r e you alright? \nEster clears her throat. But another cough follows. \nESTER M y throat... it feels dry... \nLINCOLN O k a y . . . I'll get you some water. \n128   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - NIGHT \nE m p t y . The grill bar is closed. Only the vending machines are active. Lincoln considers them. Not unlike those he used to know. He finds one that offers water bottles. The sign reads \"Arctic Melt\". He pulls out his blue card and looks for the slot. Then pauses, picking up his reflection in the glass. He examines the shadowy growth on his face. Then he notices his eyes. They seem to be darkening. The pupils, welling open. Then he feels it. The sense of danger, surging up like a geyser. \n129   INT . DEPARTURE AREA \nEster sits waiting, anxious now, coughing persistently. Hearing footfalls, she looks round. But the face that greets her is not Lincoln. It's the pale man, the one who chased them. Before she can react, he forcefully pulls her upright, tapping his earpiece- \n", "test3_input": "KATHERINE O h , God... Oh, my God... \n175   EXT. PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON \nA whisper cuts across the glistening skyline towards The Sanger Industries Tower. It circles in to land on a rooftop helipad. \n176   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER \nSilence . Crowne sits at her desk. Merrick sits across from her. Waiting. The air stirs as the secretary ushers Dr. Sanger into the office. No greetings are exchanged. Sanger just lowers into a chair, a little unsettled to find Merrick has preceded him. \nCROWNE I take it you've heard the news. \nDR. SANGER The bond agents. Yes. Unfortunate. \nCROWNE Unfortunate? (pauses, lights a cigarette) We're way past unfortunate, Henry. \nDR. SANGER I thought we'd covered ourselves. \nCROWNE The police won't connect the bond agents to us. But that's not the problem. It's the sponsor. \nDR. SANGER What are you talking about? \nMERRICK The male agnate tracked him down. \nCROWNE His name's Thomas Lincoln. It seems they had a genetic reunion. Not a h a p p y one. It was all I could do to stop him going to the authorities. \nDR. SANGER I still don't see the problem. \nCROWNE He may not want a police involvement but he's already threatened to file suit. And he's one of the biggest litigation attorneys in the city. \nDR. SANGER That's why we have you, Ellen. \nCROWNE That's why I asked Bernard to come out here. To find out how it happened. \nMERRICK I told her, Henry. About synesthesia. \nS a n g e r casts a betrayed look at Merrick. Then returns to Crowne- \nDR. SANGER I t was a marginal problem. And it was under control - according to Bernard. \nCROWNE That's not the point. Whether or not it's a factor in this instance, it puts us in breach of the clone laws. \nDR. SANGER I t doesn't even touch their genetics. \nCROWNE I'm talking about self-awareness. The virtual humanity statutes require us t o give them consciousness to the l e v e l of functionality. But not beyond. \nThis gives Sanger pause. Crowne drags her cigarette acutely. \nCROWNE L e g a l l y , we are naked on every level. Federal legislature, state licensing, sponsorship contract... But even if we did manage to weather the legal storm, we'd never survive the public scrutiny. \nS a n g e r absorbs this, calmly shaking a pill from his pill bottle. \nDR. SANGER I've spent my entire career facing down naysayers, Ellen. Don't think for a second I'm afraid of facing them now. \nCROWNE You remember cryogenics? At the outset, people dismissed it as a rich man's folly. Eccentric millionaires freezing their brains, hoping to wake up in a new body. \nCROWNE (cont'd) E v e n when cloning showed signs of m a k i n g it feasible, it wasn't moral a f f r o n t that caused the backlash. It w a s the scope. The scope, Henry. When t h e size of the customer base was e x p o s e d , it screamed inequality - one m e d i c i n e for the rich and one for the p o o r . The pressure for accessible cryo- genics a s good as buried the industry. ( a pause for emphasis) O u r graves are being dug as we speak, g e n t l e m e n . Every passing second, they g e t deeper. If we're going to survive, w e have to act swiftly and decisively. \nDR. SANGER A l r i g h t . What do you suggest? \nS a n g e r dry swallows the pill. Ellen opens a contract folder. \nCROWNE O u r security chief - I've been looking at his file. Ex-marine, served in South China - do we think he still has it in him? \nDR. SANGER ( r e a l i z i n g , suddenly harsh) A r e you insane? \nThe i r eyes deadlock. Crowne gives Merrick a sideways glance. \nCROWNE ` You ever wondered why Henry takes those pills, Bernard? Why he doesn't avail himself of his own technology? \nDR. SANGER An agnate could give me a new heart but to get it to function mentally... \nCROWNE B u l l s h i t , Henry. Bullshit. You don't want to deal with reality. Only with concept. I may not have been there at the start but I heard the stories. You wanted in on every aspect of construction, from environmental design right down to the classical playlists. I t wasn't enough just to make it work, was it? No, you wanted your own little utopia. \nCROWNE (cont'd) Swanning a r o u n d in your mountain r e t r e a t like some self-appointed d e i t y . But when it comes to getting y o u r hands dirty... \nDR. SANGER A r e you quite finished? \nCROWNE E v e n God has blood on his hands, Henry. Are you going to watch it all go up in flames or are you going to deal with it? \nS a n g e r crosses to the window, looking down onto the city. \nDR. SANGER You see that street down there...? Running east from the stadium. My father used to take me to church on that street. An old Spanish church. \nCROWNE What's your point? \nDR. SANGER I didn't know they'd torn it down. \n177   INT . GUEST BEDROOM - KATHERINE'S HOUSE - EVENING \n", "test3_true": "178   INT . KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nThe kitchen is arrayed with modern technology but softened with paintings and craftwork. A r t marginally overwhelming science. Katherine starts making some herb tea in the traditional manner. \nLINCOLN What did you give her? \nKATHERINE J u s t something to help her sleep. I think she has a bronchial infection. But I'm not sure I should give her an antibiotic in case it effects the baby. \nLINCOLN S o you know about the baby... \nKatherine pauses, reality sinking its claws. She looks at him- \nKATHERINE Is n ' t that why you came here? \nLINCOLN I found your name in the listings. I wasn't sure. You don't look like her. \nKATHERINE The y have a plan... For women like me. \nLINCOLN S o you're the one who takes her baby. \nKatherine winces at him. It's uttered so matter-of-factly. She pauses, hanging her head, searching within herself. \nKATHERINE You know when you're young? How you run around thinking you're immortal? \nLincoln ' s look says he has no idea. She seems not to notice. \nKATHERINE The r e was a lodeway accident. I was... damaged. After that, I thought no man would ever want me. I was wrong. His name was John. He said he married me for my eyes. Ocean eyes, he called them. He always loved the ocean. Up there on the wall, that's John's boat. \nO f f her gesture, Lincoln glances at the wall. A watercolor of a yacht. Meaningless to him but Katherine gazes it at, fondly- \nKATHERINE But I think there was always an unspoken regret between us. When we heard about the technology, it was like... forgive- n e s s , like a second chance. A child of our own, part of both of us. Sailing trips, fishing trips, so many plans... ( a flat beat) J o h n got cancer a year ago. He died. \nHe r eyes mist, distant and bittersweet, talking to herself now. \nKATHERINE I r o n i c . That the same technology could have saved his life. And now the baby is the only part of him I have left. And the boat. I still have the boat. \nLincoln looks discomfited. There's more to this than he thought. \n179   INT. MOTEL ROOM - EVENING \nS c h e e r opens the door. Merrick stands at the threshold with an attache case. Scheer, seemingly unsurprised, brings him inside. \nSCHEER I told you we shouldn't have gone to outside personnel. They were cowboys. \nMERRICK We had no choice, Karl. We had to keep this away from The Institute. \nSCHEER An d now? \nMerrick lowers in a chair, grim and leaden. He opens his attache and pulls out a contract folder. He hands it to Scheer. \nSCHEER What's this? \nMERRICK Your resignation papers. Maybe `early retirement' would be more accurate... \nS c h e e r leans forward, frowning, curious. \nMERRICK T e n platinum bounty - if you sign the papers, their loss becomes your gain. \nSCHEER A parachute... So there's a jump? \nMERRICK You understand that whatever happens, The Institute must be able to deny it. \nS c h e e r says nothing. Merrick reaches in the attache and pulls out a case. Inside are a row of ampules and a pressure syringe-gun. \nMERRICK We use a chemical to dispose of waste product. It's called di-halcyonate. I t reacts on a molecular level to start a process of internal combustion. The subject is incinerated from the inside out. In post-mortem application it's done its job before rigor mortis. In a live subject, well... you can imagine. \nSCHEER You want to dispose of your products. \nMERRICK I t ' s a little more complicated than that. We have to be very... thorough. If you still have it in you, that is. \nS c h e e r gives him a sideways look. Then displays the USMC ring. \nSCHEER Why do you think I still wear this? \nMERRICK I don't know. \nSCHEER I was discharged from the marines for insubordination. If you asked anyone i n my unit, they'd call it heroism. I disobeyed an order to fall back. I took out a bunker complex single-handed. \nMERRICK S o you wear it is a badge of honor? \nSCHEER N o . It wasn't bravery. I wasn't afraid of dying. I just didn't care. You see, I suddenly realized I was just a sack of flesh with a heartbeat. Life, death, I just couldn't see the point anymore. \nMerrick allows a respectful pause, then- \nMERRICK You'll find a vehicle parked outside. It's unregistered, difficult to trace. I take it we have an agreement...? \n180   INT . KATHERINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n"}

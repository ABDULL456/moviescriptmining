{"test1_input": "MCCORD Sorry, chief. I can't let you get any closer. We got live wires over there. \nLincoln's reply is muffled by the gasmask, lost in the noise. \nMCCORD What's that you said? \nLincoln repeats to no avail. Frustrated, he peels off his gasmask- \nLINCOLN I said I can't hear you. M c C o r d c h u c k l e s at the irony. \nMCCORD He y , you get yourself contaminated, don't come pointing the finger at me. LINCOLN How are you doing, Mac? \nMCCORD You know how it is. `Gets to the end of shift, `crew starts draggin t h e i r feet. \nLINCOLN We l l the guys upstairs are griping about the backlog. They want to know when you'll be ready for move in. MCCORD I guess if we bust our backs, we could be out of here by the end of the week. \nLINCOLN I'll tell them two weeks. \nMCCORD Thanks , chief. I appreciate that. \nLINCOLN So . . . got any stuff on you today? \n17   INT . AIRLOCK - SECTOR SIX \nA sign reads \"Warning! Contamination Risk!\". Lincoln stands by as McCord u n l o o p s a neckchain w i t h a single-forked pendant known as a \"uni-key\". He slots it into the top of three keyholes. A light starts flashing and the airlock gives a heavily pressurized hiss. \n18   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT \nA deep steady thrum. Giant extractor fans churn above and below, both directions seemingly limitless. The bleak concrete shaft is streaked with soot, threaded by ladders and catwalks. On one such, we isolate Lincoln and McCord. B o t h smoking cigarettes. \nLINCOLN I t ' s too bad. MCCORD What do you mean? \nLINCOLN T h a t your shift's almost over. \nMCCORD You mean, these things? Well, these things ain't good for you anyways. \nLINCOLN The y taste good. \nAn exchanged smile. A pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure. \nLINCOLN I like coming here. Talking. Most outsiders don't like to talk. \nMCCORD That's because we ain't supposed to. They got rules about fraternization. \nLincoln nods. Another pause as they drag on their cigarettes. \nLINCOLN What do you do when the shift's over? \nMCCORD M o r e of the same. They cycle us onto the disposal detail. Hump `n dump crew. \nLINCOLN H u m p `n dump crew? \nMCCORD D e b r i s clearance. We hump the heavy stuff to a site on the outside. LINCOLN Is it as bad as they say out there? \nM c C o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzled. Lincoln displays his gasmask. \nLINCOLN The air... the containments. \nMCCORD Right. \nLINCOLN But not everywhere. Not on The Island. \nMCCORD ( b e a t , stubs his cigarette) I don't know too much about that. Lincoln eyes him narrowly. McCord p a u s e s , then tucks his lighter into the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile. \nMCCORD He y , take it from me, you got a sweet deal right here. So why worry, huh? Lincoln shrugs, accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke. We tilt up to follow the smoke plume, dissipating into the fans. \n19   EXT . THE WORLD OUTSIDE - DAY A i r blasts up from a giant tunnel. \nW i d e n i n g , we see it is one of a huge ring, planted in the dust, backdropped b y mountainous red rocks. At the hub of the ring is a large cubic building. From its facets, giant appendages of ducting plunge into its surround. These are the inlets for the processed air that feeds the underground... \nThis is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above. \nF r o m the processing plant, we pull back and up, raking over a large industrial complex. More cubic buildings, cream colored, windowless, like stacks of giant playing bricks. Now we see the front of the complex. The planate f a c a d e , faceless but for the entrance, cubed in polarized glass, like a dark cyclopean eye. \nF r o m the entrance, we follow a walkway out to a dock where the ground drops away into a broad concrete trench; like the subway, lined with lode-poles and buffers, it is known as a \"lodeway\". From the dock, we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall; red rock slabs, twenty feet high, framing a giant gateway. The gates now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall- \nThe shimmering bleached wilderness of The Arizona Desert. O u t in the distance, where the lodeway tapers into the scrub, a vehicle emerges from the shimmer. A hybrid of bus and nautical craft, single hulled, known simply as a \"liner\". Now as the liner becomes clearer, a decal on its prow is revealed - a crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d \"The Sanger Institute\". 20   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY \nThe polarized glass shows the liner has docked and A TOUR GROUP is disembarking. The men are mostly over 40, bloated by luxury. The women, mostly under 30, wives and girlfriends, all jewels and haute couture. They filter into the entrance hall to be greeted by the courtesy staff. Pretty girls in short skirts and blazers with the crosshatch insignia, led by a pert redhead named LYDIA. \nLYDIA L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia and on behalf of our staff, I'd like t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute. \nLYDIA (cont'd) Before we start the tour, we'll be serv- i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center and circulating our standard discretion agreements. I should add that today you are all very lucky because our CEO and founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us and will be leading the tour personally. \n21   INT . INNER FOYER - LATER The crosshatch emblem spins on a wall-to-wall screen. Not a real screen but a projected flat known as a \"holoframe\". Here, Lydia assembles the tour group, nursing wine glasses and canapes. The holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins: A series of vignettes; an old man shuffling on a walking frame -- a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit, one breast flattened by a mastectomy -- a young woman in labor, her face knotted in pain. The group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles. Then- \nV O I C E (O.S.) I t ' s not a pretty sight, is it? E y e s turn to a figure behind them, dressed in a vestmental w h i t e labcoat - 70's, tall, slightly hunched by senility, eyes like quicksilver, glittering. He has the hauteur of a visionary stooping to the role of a salesman. His name is DR. HENRY SANGER. \nDR. SANGER (cont'd) M o r t a l i t y . We all know its face and yet w e look away, don't we? We deny that our l i v e s are ordained to suffering. That w e are all, inalterably, going to die. \n", "test1_true": "DR. SANGER I t takes courage to confront mortality, my friends. And I see it in each of y o u . My name is Dr. Henry Sanger and I'm here to reward your courage. L y d i a applauds. The tour group dutifully follows suit. Sanger whispers a question in Lydia's ear. She broadcasts her response- \nLYDIA T o d a y ' s group is from New Gaza Health Care. They're with the platinum plan. \nDR. SANGER N e w Gaza. Yes, very good oncology unit. \nM u l l i n g this, he ambles through the holoframe which ripples at his passage. Rallied by Lydia the tour group follows him into-- \n22   INT. SALES HALL - DAY \nA hall of windows, each window framing a display case, each display case housing a different taxidermied a n i m a l . Not unlike a museum. On closer inspection, more like a chamber of horrors. I n one window is a pig with a horribly distended abdomen. Another, magnified, shows a mouse with a human ear grown on its back. In another, a chimpanzee stares out at us with glaringly human eyes. \nDR. SANGER I t doesn't get any prettier, does it? But this is not a freakshow, my friends. This is a war museum. A history of our battles with mortality... and defeats. Take the stem cell, for instance. A bid to cultivate human parts for transplant - in rodents, primates, barnyard animals. It's enough to make your skin crawl. In some cases literally, giving rise to a new range of cross-species viruses. But that's how we learn. From our mistakes. The y turn a corner. Another hall of windows, portals onto tanks of amber fluid that might be formaldehyde. Suspended within are embryos, fetuses and infants. All human. All grotesquely mutated. \nDR. SANGER C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the beginning, the mapping of the human genome was declared a historic landmark- t o break the curse of heredity, to correct congenital defect... genetic engineering became the brave new world of medical science. A bright future that led to a dark age and much of the legislation we know today. But while the clone laws may have narrowed the field, science marches on. Only to hit the same wall over and over again - the enigma of growth, the alchemy that takes us from embryo to adult. A clone barely reaches infancy before its growth enzymes misfire, resulting in the kind of monstrosities - which are only effigies - you see here. \nS o m e reassured sighs from the women. They turn another corner onto another hall. A hall of mirrors. Simple, full-length mirrors. \nDR. SANGER So what do we learn from our mistakes? That human parts cannot grow outside a human body. That human bodies cannot grow outside nature's grand design. \nA FAT MAN, supporting his bulk with a walking stick, grunts - \nT H E FAT MAN S o what the hell are we doing here? \nDR. SANGER L e t ' s say one day you go to your doctor for a checkup. He discovers you have imminent renal failure and require a kidney transplant. What would you do? \nT H E FAT MAN I wouldn't do nothing. My brother'd g i v e me one of his. Or else. \nDR. SANGER E v e n if your brother's kidney is with- o u t defect, there's still a 38% chance of rejection. Or less if he's your twin. \nT H E FAT MAN He's not. He's older. \nDR. SANGER But what if you did have a twin? \nO f f the fat man's confused look, Sanger smiles and gently coaxes him to face a mirror. Their reflections stare back at them. \nDR. SANGER What if you had a genetic double who'd give you not just one of his kidneys, but both? In fact, any organ or body part you ever had cause to need? \nT H E FAT MAN What ? You mean like a clone? I thought you said all that stuff was a bust. \nDR. SANGER I said the problem with a clone is it doesn't survive infancy. The solution is to find a different starting point. Why sow the seed when you can create the fruit? Or what we like to call... an \"agnate\". \nL y d i a starts clapping., then s t o p s , realizing this wasn't a cue. \nDR. SANGER An agnate is sequenced from a point on the cellular timeclock. I t is spawned post-maturate. It is `created' adult. \nDR. SANGER (cont'd) O f course, its brain is still vestigial s o for the first three years we keep it i n suspension. During which time we use d a t a impression to supply a template f o r functionality - a process we call \" f o u n d a t i o n \" . After foundation we t r a n s f e r the agnate into \"containment\" w h e r e it enters the conditioning p r o c e s s . An ongoing series of quality c o n t r o l s designed to test and maintain i t s functionality. After a minimum of t w o years conditioning, the agnate b e c o m e s eligible for harvest... ( t o the FAT MAN, smiling) An d you, my friend, get your new kidney. \nA hush falls among the group as they process what they've heard. It's a sign of the times that none of them seems to be horrified. \nT H E FAT MAN L e t me see if I got this straight. You can create this whatever... this walking spare parts holder... but I gotta w a i t five years to get hold of em? \nDR. SANGER The spare parts, as you put it, need to be tested for integrity. But as many of our clients leave it till late in life to take out the policy, we do offer the option for early harvest. Given the risks, however, a waiver is required. \nT H E FAT MAN S o five years or no warranty? For the premiums you're asking? \nDR. SANGER An d what if the organ you   needed was a heart? Ask yourself, each     of you. If you had to put a price on     your life, your very survival - what     would it be? \nA deep lull as the group considers this. Sanger picks his moment. \nDR. SANGER I t ' s a question your insurance company has already answered. For them, the agnate obviates costly and ineffective treatment programs. Should you decide t o take out our policy, not only will they lower your existing premiums but they'll also cover the production cost. \nThe incentive ripples across the faces. A troubled one speaks up- \nT O U R MEMBER This \"agnate\"... what happens to it? After our friend here gets his kidney. \nDR. SANGER That's entirely his decision. Our role is intermediary. We, as the insurance provider, guarantee the condition and availability of the agnate but all other rights are retained. In legal terms, the policy holder is defined as a \"sponsor\". The premiums, in effect, becoming sponsorship payments, maintaining the agnate until such time as harvest is required. At such time and where feasible, the sponsor has the option to extend sponsorship, retaining the agnate for secondary harvest or, shall we say, let the policy expire. \nT O U R MEMBER E x p i r e ? You mean... let it die? \nDR. SANGER N o . Not as you and I know it, at least. The associations of life and death are no more applicable to an agnate than to a cow in a field. It exists in a state of limited consciousness - aware not of life but of functionality. Imbued with the knowledge to maintain its function but without the capacity to question it. And yet, in many ways, the end if the most humane part of the process. The agnate goes to harvest without any fore- b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the sleep from whence it came. Eternal or otherwise. There is mortality for an agnate. Just utility and redundancy. \nT O U R MEMBER S o it doesn't know? It doesn't know its... its p u r p o s e in life? \nDR. SANGER W h o does know my friend? Who among us knows our true purpose in life? S a n g e r ambles on, plunged in thought. Lydia picks up the slack- \nLYDIA This month we're offering a special rate for new sponsors. Including a 10% discount on the his-and-hers plan. \nShe ushers the group round another corner. Another holoframe and another commercial, displaying the same characters as the first; The old man with the walking frame is now running in a park-- The woman with the mastectomy is now at a party, her cocktail dress broadcasting a full cleavage -- The young mother is now in a waiting room, smiling as a doctor hands her a newborn baby. \nLYDIA DR. SANGER? Would you like to close? \nDR. SANGER Yes . . . Now some of you may be thinking this commercial is staged. But these are not actors, these are past customers. Real p e o p l e enjoying the real f r u i t s of sponsorship. What we offer here at The Sanger Institute is not just health insurance but indemnity. What we offer is the chance of a new lease on life... \nThe tour group applauds, this time without prompting from Lydia. \nDR. SANGER N o w Lydia will walk you through the rest of the tour and explain the various limitations and exclusions. But I do have time for a few questions. H a n d s are raised. A waspish-looking woman butts ahead of them- \n", "test1_id": 450, "test2_input": "90   INT . WHISPER - MORNING \nThe pilot jockeys with the thermals. Scheer rides shotgun. Now in civvies, scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars. The flight console beeps. He taps a keypad. A holoframe resolves: \nCENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME) Ground team checking in. \nSCHEER Anything? \nCENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME) The storm pretty much covered their tracks. We're scanning for thermals b u t the hotter it gets, the harder it is to isolate a heat signature. I don't know, sir, it's a big desert out there. \n91   EXT . CHASM - THE RED ROCKS - DAY \nThe desert sun clefts the chasm into light and shadow. Lincoln trudges into view, Ester lagging behind. He stops to let her catch up, only to watch her slump onto a rock. He allows her a moment to rest and walks to where the chasm comes to an end. \nHe surveys the terrain. His eyes roam the carpet of scrub, now narrowing on an inconsistency. A faint strip where nothing seems to grow. Tracing its lineage, he walks a few feet out. Then drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust. \nHis fingers meet something hard. He sweeps off the dust to expose a layer of concrete. Continuing, revealing the ghost of a line. What we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him. Continuing, opening a window in the dust. Now his fingers snag o n something. He tugs it and it gives a little, dust crumbling to reveal a section of rusted chainlink. A corner of metal is visible. Lincoln exposes the rest. A sign, barely legible: \"US Government - Restricted Area\". He frowns, trying to assimilate. Ester comes up to join him. Off her anxious look, he decides- \nLINCOLN I think I've found a path. \n92   EXT . THE GREEN MOUNTAINS - DAY \nW h i t e rock blanketed by stands of fir and ponderosa pine. A whisper skims over the treecaps, circling in on a high shelf. Here, remotely nestled in a clearing, stands a glass villa. \n93   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - DAY \nThe flood of light, the majestic view lend an air of beatitude. The decor is minimalist with Native American accents, kokopelli spirits in carved silhouette. Dr. Sanger stands at a glass wall, looking out across the green mountain valley. On the sofa sits Merrick, now in civvies, still gaunt from worry. The air stirs as a maid ushers in A WOMAN - 30's, all business, sharp blue eyes, a severe, mannish coiffure. Her name is ELLEN CROWNE. \nCROWNE Good morning, gentlemen. \nSANGER Bernard, this is Ellen Crowne from our legal department. Ellen, this is Bernard Merrick, director of products. \nMERRICK Thank you for coming out here. \nCROWNE Well when Henry called me I got the sense it wasn't for a social visit. \nThey settle at a table. A jug of icewater a n d glasses laid out. \nCROWNE I understand there was an incident? \nMERRICK First, let me stress there's no way we could have anticipated what happened... \nCROWNE We're on the same team, Mr. Merrick. Just give me the facts down-and-dirty. \nMERRICK (uneasy, clears his throat) We'v e lost two of our products. They escaped containment last night. \nCrowne casts a troubled look at Sanger. Merrick quickly adds- \nMerrick (cont'd) However, we have all available resources dedicated to the search. \nCROWNE How exactly did this happen? \nMERRICK We'r e still piecing it together. \nCROWNE Do we expect more products to escape? \nDR. SANGER Don't be so alarmist, Ellen. \nCROWNE I'm sorry, Henry, but you asked me here to assess our liabilities. \nMERRICK To answer your question, we condition our products with a deterrent. A fear of contamination. And thereby of the outer environment. So to escape, they first have to escape their conditioning. \nCrowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette. \nCROWNE Containment is one of the terms of our state health license. The fact it was compromised could put us in violation. \nDR. SANGER Bureaucracy. \nCROWNE Henry , it was a bloody battle getting our license through in the first place. \nDR. SANGER They're not going to pull our license, Ellen. We have a lot of friends on the Commission. Not to mention the goodwill we earned in DC when we took over the facility; a bunker complex for a bio- chemical war that never happened... We relieved them of a costly embarrassment. \nCROWNE I'm not sure we can rely on that. \nDR. SANGER Alright . What do you suggest? \nCROWNE First, I need you to level with me. What are our chances of finding them? \nMERRICK Well, in our favor, they've never been outside containment. They'd have no coordinates, no sense of direction. \nCROWNE I don't see how that's in our favor. \nMERRICK They're in the middle of the desert. Food and water become an issue. \nCROWNE So they might return to the trough? \nMERRICK Possibly. \nCROWNE And if not? How long could they last? \n", "test2_true": "DR. SANGER That's a little drastic. Some immune systems are more adaptive than others. \nCROWNE Let's take the drastic case. What then? \nMERRICK Well . . . the male, we could cover. Fast- track another generation before the sponsor ever needed access. The female comes under the maternity plan. She's three months pregnant. Even if we fast- tracked another generation, we couldn't fast-track the pregnancy. We'd miss the delivery date, the sponsor would wonder why and there would be... difficulties. \nCrowne looks worried. Sanger pours a glass of icewater. \nDR. SANGER Even so, the worst may not happen. \nCROWNE We haven't even touched on the worst. If these products reach a populated area, there's the problem of scrutiny. DR. SANGER Ellen , we operate under State license on a lease from the Federal Government... \nCROWNE ( c u t s him off, harshly) We slipped through a loophole in the clone laws, Henry. And they only let u s through because they smelt money. And they gave us a government basement to cover their own a s s e s not ours. It's at the core of our license - why we screen potential sponsors, why we make them sign discretion agreements, why containment is such a critical factor - to limit the extent of public scrutiny. \nDR. SANGER E i t h e r way, it's unlikely they'd get that far. It's at least twenty miles to the next settlement. Right, Bernard? \nMerrick hesitates before nodding his assent. Crowne pounces on it- \nCROWNE Something to add, Mr. Merrick? \nMERRICK I just don't think we should under- estimate them. Especially the male. \nDR. SANGER And I don't think we should panic. \nHe cautions Merrick with a discreet look, then shakes a pill from a bottle. Crowne looks forward to both men. Very serious. \nCROWNE Gentlemen, whatever happens we need t o keep one thing clearly in mind. As far as the world at large goes, we are just another medical services company. Anything that alters that perception puts us at risk. And we cannot rely on the sanction of the law to protect us. Whenever and wherever and in whatever condition we recover these products, we have to stay beyond reproach. All it takes is one nudge to put us in the spotlight. Then you'll see how fast politicians can run for cover. \nMerrick shifts, uneasy. Sanger takes the pill with a bitter smile- \nDR. SANGER I n other words we need to find them o r else. That's very astute, Ellen. \n94   EXT . DESERT HIGHWAY - SUNSET \nThe dust swirls and puffs across a highway of yesteryear. A dirt track but for patches of exposed concrete and angles of buckled lampposts. The empty path reaches to a blood-red sunset. \n95   EXT . SCRAPYARD - SUNSET \nThe dust skims over mountains of rusted scrap. Nestled in the mountains is a shack. A sign creaks in the breeze \"Osmund D e e r , Licensed Salvage Merchant\". On the porch sits an old man in a greasy ballcap a n d dungarees. This is the eponymous owner, OZZIE. \nHe's sitting on a lounger, surveying his empire, enjoying a beer and a cigarette. Exhaling a drag of smoke, his eyes crease to a squint. He sees something through the smoke, silhouetted against the sunset. An approaching figure, wary, like a flighty animal. \nOZZIE Hello? \nThe silhouetted figure doesn't answer, just stares back at him. \nOZZIE Can I help you? \nThis seems to get a response. The figure ventures closer. We recognize Lincoln. Exhausted, dust-covered and dry-throated - \nLINCOLN My friend... she needs water. \n96   INT . BACK ROOM - THE SHACK - SUNSET \nA mass of technology and furniture from recent and distant past. Lincoln lowers Ester onto a threadbare sofa. Ozzie, excited to have visitors, bustles up with a water gallon, pouring a glass. Lincoln takes it and tips it to Ester's lips. She coughs it out at first. Then takes the glass and starts drinking with vigor. Ozzie sets down the water gallon in front of his visitors. Then settles in an armchair and cracks open a beer. It lends the mood, albeit strained, of a social visit. Lonely old Ozzie wanting to make it so. Despite which, both men have an eye on each other. \nOZZIE Got stuck in that supercell, didya? \nLincoln eyes him, wary of the question. Ozzie reads confusion- \nOZZIE Supercellstorm , that's what they call it on the news anyways. I n my day, we just called `em \"big ol' h o w l e r s \" . \nOzzie chuckles to himself. It seems to put his visitor at ease. \nOZZIE Yep, I heard it shut down some of the lodeways. Dust in the works, I guess. Where were you folks headed anyways? \nLincoln gulps down some water, deciding an answer. Then ventures- \nLINCOLN Away. \nOZZIE A w a y ? You mean, like outta s t a t e ? \nLINCOLN \" O u t of state\"... \nThe term is meaningless to Lincoln but he likes the sound of it. Ozzie grins. This is starting to feel like a real social visit. \nOZZIE N o w where's my manners gone? I'm Ozzie. Osmund r e a l l y . But folks call me Ozzie. \nAn awkward lull as Ozzie waits for his visitor to reciprocate. \nOZZIE S o m e t i m e s I like to make a joke of it, my last name bein' D e e r . . . \"O. Deer\". \nO z z i e chuckles but the pun seems lost on his visitor. He lets it drop. The awkward silence returns. Lincoln drinks the water, wondering if this strange old man is as harmless as he appears. \nOZZIE We l l now, looks like yer g i r l f r i e n d ' s made herself at home. \nLincoln looks at Ester, slumped over, asleep on the sofa. Ozzie puts a finger to his lips, beckoning his visitor out of the room. \n", "test2_id": 451, "test3_input": "The shaman's chanting suddenly stops. He is looking directly at Lincoln, pointing. His face, contorting with what might be anger or fear. He starts babbling in dialect, ardently. Lincoln frowns in confusion. Grey Dove quietly draws him away from the mound. \n162   INT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER \nEster stirs from slumber. On the ground beside her, she finds a bowl of food and a water gallon. Now through the gloom, she sees Lincoln, sitting on the stool like he never left, keeping vigil. Something seems different about him as he turns, registering her- \nLINCOLN A r e you alright? \nESTER I feel better after I sleep. \nLincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway. Ester moves closer, sensing something. He speaks as if from far away- \nLINCOLN The man out there... he said everything has a spirit... every living thing... but not... \nHis voice cuts off. Ester looks at him, recognizing his pain. She doesn't understand what it is or what caused it. It's pain and it evokes a response in her. A feeling, taking her over. Her hand reaches out and strokes his hair. Lincoln looks up at her, questioning. With supreme knowing, Ester leans down and kisses him. At the touch of her lips, Lincoln pauses. The first kiss for both of them but Ester takes it in her stride. The calm ballet of nature. Fluidly peeling off her shirt, breasts steeping with moonlight. Lincoln rising to face her, feeling her proximity, her radiant heat. His fingers touching her breasts. Ester trembling, her lips once more finding his. Lincoln closing his eyes, the rush of sensation, overwhelming. He yields to it, returning the kiss, with hunger, with passion... with spirit. \n163   EXT . THE INTERSTATE - DAWN \nThe sun rises in the east, depicting the traffic in silhouette. A vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where the skiff sits abandoned. The grey cutter pulls to a halt. \n164   EXT . HARD SHOULDER - DAWN \nD i g g s and Burdon move up on the skiff, cover positions, weapons levelled. Burdon spins in to the driver side, snapping aim with the thunderbolt. But the skiff is empty. The only sign of life is the interface, flashing red: \"REMOTE LOCATOR TRANSMITTING\". \nB u r d o n exchanges a look with Diggs. No dice. Diggs reaches in his pocket and pulls out what looks like an electronic telescope. He puts it to his eye and pans the salt flats. Burdon crouches at the roadside, looking for tracks. Then Diggs fixes on something- \nDIGGS I got thermals. \n165   EXT . PLATFORM MOUND - SUNRISE \nThe fire is now reduced to a heap of embers. The tribespeople a r e asleep around the mound, wrapped in ethnic blankets. Diggs and Burdon move up stealthily, weapons at the ready. The horses bristle and snort, betraying their approach. The tribespeople, stirred by the noise, awake. Diggs and Burdon swing aim around the ring as faces rise and stare at them. None of the faces have white skin. Diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the gathering- \nDIGGS I'm looking for two bond runners. They ditched near here last night. \nDIGGS (cont'd) One man, one woman. Tattoos on the forehead... (nothing, just silent stares) Anyone's seen them, I got fifty green. (still nothing, aggravated) What the fuck are you? Deaf and dumb? \nThe tribal faces just keep staring. Diggs scowls. Then suddenly swings aim with the rainmaker and fires. -BOOM- hitting one of the horses in the haunch. It rears up, whinnying, setting off the rest of the horses. Diggs turns back to the gathering- \nDIGGS Somebody start talking. \nHe scans around the ring. Then fixes on one of the women. She lifts a trembling finger to a man nearby. Grey Dove stiffens. \n166   EXT . SALT MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE \nThe sunrise depicts two silhouettes, moving across the ridge. Lincoln and Ester clamber over the calcified rocks. Ester now stops to catch her breath. She is wheezing again, fighting for air. As Lincoln looks on with concern, she musters a brave smile- \nESTER I can make it. \n167   EXT . SALT CANYON - EARLY MORNING \nA freight barge whooshes through the canyon, trailing a chain of low, arched containers, capacious in width rather than height. The conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider, deeper, known as a \"lode-canal\". At each end of the canyon, it intersects with other lode-canals, converging to use the same passage, a system of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic. High above, on the south rim of the canyon, we find Lincoln and Ester. Ester is no longer wheezing but rasping. She looks down at the passing vessel, daunted. Lincoln offers her small comfort- \nLINCOLN Don't worry. The one we want goes the other way. He said it goes slower. \nThey exchange a smile. The chain of containers tailing off, the barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon. \n168   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING \nLincoln and Ester descend the rocky slope toward the lode-canal. Ester stops, having to catch her breath every few steps. Lincoln tries to hide his concern, looking away towards the sunrise. The westbound vessel will be coming soon. \nThey just need to get out of state... Now he frowns, sensing something. Faint but growing. His jaw clenches. His face tightens. His pupils start to dilate. \n169   EXT . THE NORTH RIDGE - MORNING \nThe north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the grey cutter pulling up. Diggs and Burdon get out and look down into the canyon. Diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning. Burdon peels off his jacket. It's early but it's already getting hot. Diggs now pauses, handing him the scope for his opinion- \nDIGGS Up there in the rocks. Three o'clock. I'm not sure... it could be ambient. \n170   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING \nLincoln and Ester hide in the shadow of a rock. Ester is muffling her breaths as best she can. Lincoln now hazards a look over the top. Two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon, now pointing in their direction. He ducks back, assimilating. Hiding, no longer an option. Nor running, at least for Ester. His face sets in a grimace of conviction. His eyes glow darkly. \n171   EXT . THE NORTH FACE - MORNING \nDiggs and Burdon reach the foot of the rocks. Neither speaks, communicating in hand-signals. Diggs slips into the lode-canal. Burdon covers, sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face. \nDiggs emerges from the far side of the lode-canal. He stays low, moving up into the rocks. Then, from above, a rock dislodges, rattling down. Diggs reacts instantly, targeting, opening fire- \n- B O O M - B O O M - The shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock. The thunderbolt now adding to the barrage, Burdon firing from the far side - SHOTS, BOLTS, KICKING UP A STORM OF DUST -- SUDDENLY HOLDING FIRE, waiting for the dust to clear, reloading. No sign of movement. Just a slide of rubble. Fading echoes. \nD I G G S STEALS ONWARDS UP THE ROCKS - into the fog of dust - the sunlight and shadow playing tricks on his eyes - then suddenly- LINCOLN BURSTS OUT OF THE DUST - from the left - tackling the pale man - both of them toppling - tumbling down the slope -- \nTHUDDING TO A HALT at the lip of the lode-canal - the rainmaker lost in the fall - the impact throwing up a billow of dust -- THE DUSTCLOUD - Diggs and Lincoln struggling, clawing, punching - Lincoln, with surprise on his side, gaining with the upper hand-- \nDIGGS' CLAWING FINGERS discover Lincoln's knife - tugging it from his jacket - Lincoln grabbing his wrist, fighting for control - THE KNIFE MOVING BETWEEN THEM - Diggs with better leverage - the blade inching towards Lincoln's face - pressing into his cheek-- \nLINCOLN'S EYES - welling black, almost inhuman - the sense of danger screaming in his ears - he grabs the pale man's throat - DIGGS' EYES - bulging as he strains to push the knife home - oxygen draining - conscious ebbing - he slumps back - \nLINCOLN REGAINS THE KNIFE - the pale man seems to be out cold - but he's not sure - he pauses holding the blade over him, then-- - B O O M - THE KNIFE FLIES FROM HIS GRIP IN A BURST OF DISCHARGE - \n", "test3_true": "BURDON INCHES TOWARD THE EDGE - thunderbolt angling downward - into the trench - then suddenly he's GRABBED BY THE ANKLES - \nLINCOLN STRAINING to overbalance the giant - feet up against the wall - like trying to topple a tree - finally winning some give- \nBURDON TOPPLES INTO THE TRENCH - his ankles clamped by his quarry - both men meeting the concrete with a bone-shaking- \n- THUD - LINCOLN IS CRUSHED BENEATH THE MASSIVE WEIGHT - the giant already recovering from the fall - now dragging him upright-- \n- THUD - BURDON THROWS A PUNCH - mightily - hurling his quarry across the trench - moving in quickly, following up with a kick-- \n- THUD - LINCOLN CRUMPLES as the boot smacks into him - then another kick - then another - the world starts blurring -- \nBURDON TURNS AWAY - his quarry disabled for now - he recovers his thunderbolt - turns back to administer the coup de grace-- \nLINCOLN LOOKS UP - the giant looming - the muzzle of his weapon thrumming with energy - the rivets on his denims start rattling-- \nBURDON SPINS ROUND - the thunderbolt suddenly ripped from his grasp - there, in the distance - AN EASTBOUND BARGE IS COMING - \nLINCOLN SCRAMBLES UP THE WALL OF THE TRENCH - muscles straining, feet slipping on the concrete - escaping the imminent vessel -- \nDIGGS COMING TO - now seeing his quarry a short distance away - emerging from the lode-canal - he looks around for a weapon, then- \nBURDON (O.S.) Diggs! Get me outta here! \nBURDON STRUGGLING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE TRENCH - with one arm, it's almost impossible - fighting against his own weight-- DIGGS REACHING THE EDGE - seeing the eastbound barge coming - grabbing his partner's outreached hand - pulling him upward - \nBURDON'S PANIC - his other arm flinging away - HIS METAL BRACE SNARED BY THE LODE-STREAM - the force shuddering his entire body- DIGGS PULLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT - feet slipping - locked in a tug of war with the lodestream - THE BARGE IS CLOSING FAST-- \nBURDON'S HORROR - now suspended between the two forces - feet kicking - THE BARGE IS ALMOST UPON HIM - he screams agonized-- \nBURDON Help me! HELP MEEEEE! \nTHE SCREAM IS INSTANTLY LOST in the whoosh of the barge. Diggs, stunned, just looks at his hands, empty, spattered with blood. \nDIGGS Burdie...? \nTHE SHADOW OF THE ROCK - Lincoln rejoins Ester - casting a look back - the eastbound barge now plummeting into the distance-- D I G G S STOOPING AT THE EDGE OF THE TRENCH - looking down - all that remains of his partner is a smear of blood at the concrete-- \nLINCOLN AND ESTER REACHING THE FOOT OF THE ROCKS - seeing THE WESTBOUND BARGE against the sunrise - snaking into the passage-- DIGGS PULLING UPRIGHT - spotting his quarry - fire in his eyes - drawing out a boot-knife - slipping it between his teeth-- \nTHE WESTBOUND BARGE pulling through the canyon - lode-poles pulsing ahead of it - polarity thrumming in opposing flow-- LINCOLN AND ESTER start running as the barge comes towards them - Lincoln pulling Ester along - struggling to match the pace-- \nA SOUND LIKE A BEATING TYMPANY COMING TOWARDS THEM - they look round to see - A SHADOW RUNNING ALONG THE TOP OF THE BARGE-- D I G G S FLINGING HIMSELF OFF THE BARGE - the blade in his teeth - arms spread - for an instant, like a vulture against the sun-- \nLINCOLN IS SUDDENLY CRUSHED by the weight of his landing - ESTER IS HURLED SIDEWAYS - into a ditch - lost in a cloud of dust-- D I G G S PULLING HIMSELF UP, astride of Lincoln - snatching the knife from his clenched teeth - the sound, like a whetstone-- \nLINCOLN SPITTING DIRT - suddenly grabbed by the scalp and tugged sideways - twisted partways o n t o his back, forced to look up at-- A BLACK SPOT AGAINST THE SUN - Diggs' face set in a murderous sneer - he wants to see this fucker's e y e s - the torment-- \nLINCOLN DAZZLED BY THE SUNLIGHT - but suddenly knowing the face of death - now catching the brief glint of the knife as -- D I G G S PLUNGES THE BLADE DOWN - slicing into his quarry's hand as he throws it up in defense - his quarry YOWLING WITH PAIN-- \nLINCOLN FEELING THE STAB - his deepest instinct suddenly awoken - every impulse, every fiber brought into alignment - survival-- D I G G S IS HURLED INTO THE AIR as Lincoln surges upward - he tumbles backward into the dust - losing hold of the boot-knife-- \nLINCOLN PUSHES HIMSELF UPRIGHT - only makes it half-way - scrambling towards the pale man - all fours, like an animal-- D I G G S CLAWING AROUND IN THE DUST - fingers finding metal - the boot-knife - he brings it up - slashing at his imminent quarry-- \nLINCOLN RECOILING - the blade nicking his face - sudden rage - grabbing the pale man by the arm - swinging him round into-- - B O O M - THE MOVING WALL OF FREIGHT CONTAINERS - as the westbound barge passes - Diggs bounces off - stumbling to keep balance-- \nLINCOLN ON THE RETREAT - the pale man coming at him with the knife - another nick - seeing a gap now, shoving him backwards-- - B O O M - THE MOVING WALL RESOUNDS - Diggs howls - snagged by a bolt - hurt, his fury becomes incandescent - he strikes madly-- \nLINCOLN STUMBLING BACK - the pale man coming at him - the blade flashing to and fro - frenzied - like a threshing machine-- F O R C I N G HIM UP AGAINST THE ROCKS - the knife almost upon him - he grits his teeth and lunges forward - charging like a bull -- \nDIGGS CAREENS BACKWARD, still swiping the blade - digging into his quarry - headlong towards the moving wall - hitting with-- - W H U M P - no resonant boom - no bouncing back - Diggs has hit a gap between the containers and HIS HEAD HAS BEEN LOPPED OFF - \nLINCOLN STANDS HORRIFIED - as the headless body is spun by the moving wall - dropping into the trench as the barge tails off- The westbound barge gains speed, leaving the canyon. But there is Ester, running after it, vainly, coughing and sputtering. \nLINCOLN Ester! Stop! It's no use! \nESTER We have to... get to... The Island... \nLINCOLN It's going too fast! \nESTER We have to... get to... \nEster staggers a few more steps, then collapses to her knees, rasping for breath. As Lincoln reaches her, she slumps back into his arms. Her head lolling, eyes rolled back to white, a drool of blood spilling from her lips. Then the blast of a claxon c u t s the air as the westbound barge disappears into the distance. \nF A D E TO BLACK. \n172   EXT . SEDONA - LATE AFTERNOON \nA ranch home in the middle of nowhere. Long shadows. \n173   INT . STUDIO - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON \nLate golden sunlight through a mist of sawdust. Abstract wood sculptures are visible. Juniper wood, carved along the bias of the grain, polished to accentuate the curves of natural growth. AN OLDER WOMAN runs a sander over a work in progress - 60's, in coveralls, gray her tied back, her face shielded by goggles and a bandana. She pauses to review her work, shutting down the sander, slipping off her goggles and bandana. Her face is eerily familiar. Her name is KATHERINE. She now moves to the window, catching sight of something outside. Curiously, she watches a vehicle coming down the long driveway. A dusty, grey cutter. \n174   EXT . FRONT PORCH - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON \nKatherine opens the front door. The cutter is now docked in the port and a stranger is staggering towards her. In his arms, is an unconscious woman. Now Katherine can see the face - younger, but unmistakable even so. Her voice comes in a chilled whisper- \n", "test3_id": 452}

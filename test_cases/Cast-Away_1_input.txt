Chuck pulls some clothes out of his saddle bags. 
EXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER 
Chuck emerges from the restroom wearing a FedEx shirt and shorts. 
EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER 
A classic beach house.  Sand dunes, stilts.  Carrying the Angel Wing Box under his arm, Chuck checks the address in his hand.  Mounts the steps.  A light mist falls.  You can see the Gulf behind the house, gray and moody. 
A WOMAN, BETTINA, answers the door -- THE woman from the beginning.  She wears cut-off jeans and a blue work shirt covered with paint.  There's a tattoo on her ankle. 
CHUCK FedEx for Bettina Peterson. 
The woman stares in disbelief at the package she hasn't seen in years and never expected to see again. 
BETTINA Where did you get that? 
Chuck displays a FedEx badge. 
CHUCK Charles Noland.  FedEx Special Projects. 
Bettina notices Chuck's bicycle. 
BETTINA You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late. 
CHUCK There was an unavoidable delay. 
Bettina stares at the package, her own memories coming back. 
BETTINA Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up. 
CHUCK No. 
She holds the box and studies him for a long moment. Something -- the look on his face, the extraordinary reappearance of this long-lost package -- makes her curious. 
BETTINA You know what happened to this? 
CHUCK As much as anybody. 
BETTINA Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute. 
CHUCK Okay.  Sure. 
She lets Chuck in the door. 
INT.  HOUSE - DAY 
Ladders.  Scaffolds.  Huge paintings are everywhere. Paintings of wings and angels -- like the package.  Chuck stares at them.  Bettina watches Chuck stare. 
BETTINA I've got some coffee on.  Would you like some? 
INT.  KITCHEN - LATER 
Bettina pours some coffee.  The package sits in the counter. Some magazines are spread around, including a People Magazine with Chuck's photograph on the cover. 
CHUCK (takes a sip) It's good. 
They smile awkwardly at each other.  She starts to open it. 
BETTINA Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet. 
CHUCK Possible.  So you did those wings? 
BETTINA Yeah.  A long time ago. 
CHUCK They're harder to do than they look. 
BETTINA Oh?  You've tried? 
CHUCK Well, I do a little drawing -- 
She's opened the package.  She pulls out the bottles of salsa and the letter. 
CHUCK Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient. 
BETTINA He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him. 
There is a moment where neither knows what to say. 
BETTINA You look familiar. 
Her eyes start to register recognition.  She glances at the magazine with Chuck's picture on it.  She picks it up. 
BETTINA I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly. 
CHUCK Well, not really, I -- 
BETTINA You are.  Yes you are. (so many things she wants to say) What gave you the idea to paint on that cave? 
Chuck thinks about that.  After a moment, he grins. 
CHUCK To tell you the truth -- you did. 
BETTINA Do you...have any more packages to deliver? 
CHUCK No.  that was the last one. 
BETTINA Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch. 
Chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the ocean in the light rain.  He looks over at all the canvases, the easel, the palettes.  The wind rustles the palm trees around the house.  The surf crashes and rustles.  Familiar sounds.  Island sounds. 
He relaxes a little.  Maybe the package with the wings was a sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this.  Then there's a sound of a truck in the driveway.

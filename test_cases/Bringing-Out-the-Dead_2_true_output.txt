DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. 12TH STREET--EARLY MORNING 
Larry dropping Frank off at the corner of First and Sixteenth, driving on. 
It is as if the sun has risen on a different city, different from the one which Frank drove through the night before: a city of crumbling neighborhoods laid bare by sunlight; a city of day people, getting up, having breakfast, going to work. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT--DAY 
Frank's studio apartment betrays a minimal existence: single bed, table, fridge and stove, loveseat, bookshelf, television. The bookshelf contains a CD player, medical texts, old schoolbooks ("Romantic Poetry"), paperback novels and, incongruously, a picture book of women's fashion. 
A framed commendation from the New York Fire Department hangs beside and open closet of work clothes, corduroy jacket, two ties on a hook. Remnants of a fast food breakfast on the table. Aluminum foil covers the windows, blocking out the sunlight. 
Frank stands bareback at the single open window, smoking, drinking from a glass of whiskey, looking across the gray cityscape of high rises and water tanks: winding down from the night's work: 
FRANK (V.O.) Saving someone's life is like falling in love, the best drug in the world. For days, sometimes weeks afterwards, you walk the street making infinite whatever you see. Once, for weeks I couldn't feel the earth. Everything I touched became light. Horns played in my shoes; flowers fell from my pockets ... 
TIME DISSOLVES: Frank paces the room. Pours himself another drink. 
FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D) You wonder if you've become immortal, as if you saved your own life as well. What was once criminal and happenstance suddenly makes sense. God has passed through you, why deny it, that for a moment there, God was you. 
TIME DISSOLVE: window is closed. Frank tosses in his sleep. 
Nightstand alarm buzzes. Frank sits up, looks at the clock. Stretching his neck, he walks over to the sink, runs water on his hands and face. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. EMS GARAGE--NIGHT 
The maintenance garage and dispatch office adjacent to our Lady of Mercy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EMS GARAGE OFFICE--NIGHT 
Frank standing on one foot before the desk of CAPTAIN BARNEY, 50, ex-paramedic and lifetime civil servant. 
FRANK Good morning, Captain. 
Capt. Barney looks over to MISS WILLIAMS, his secretary, seated at a desk perpendicular to his: 
CAPT. BARNEY What am I going to to do with this guy? (to Frank) Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early. 
FRANK I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you. 
CAPT. BARNEY You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate. 
FRANK It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker. 
CAPT. BARNEY I've never fired anyone in my life. 
FRANK I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard. 
CAPT. BARNEY Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one. (looks at Miss Williams) Sorry. (back to Frank) I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself. 
FRANK You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong. 
CAPT. BARNEY I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row. 
FRANK You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.

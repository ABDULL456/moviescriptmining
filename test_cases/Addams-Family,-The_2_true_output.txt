12   INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOME - SAME TIME                           12 
JUDGE WOMACK, the Addams' CRUSTY PATRICIAN NEIGHBOR, is having his breakfast when Gomez's golf ball lands in his cornflakes, shattering the bowl, covering him with milk. Judge Womack hurries to his broken window, shaking his fist: 
JUDGE WOMACK 
Damn you, Addams!

FROM THEIR VANTAGE POINT -- 
it appears to Gomez and Morticia that Judge Womack is waving to them. Gomez waves back. 
GOMEZ 
(calls) Sorry about the window, Judge! Keep the ball! I have a whole bucketful. He holds up a bucket of golf balls. He tosses his golfclub to Thing, who DEPOSITS IT in the golfbag.

Gomez joins Morticia watching 
THE DEPARTING SCHOOL BUS. 
MORTICIA 
The little ones, off to school. Bless them. 
GOMEZ 
They grow up so fast, don't they? 
MORTICIA 
Too fast. 
THEIR POV 
Tires smoking, the school bus strains to chug down the road. Gleefully hanging from the rear bumper is Pugsley, dragging his heels.

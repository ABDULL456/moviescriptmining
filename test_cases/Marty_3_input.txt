MARTY So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher. 
CLARA There's nothing wrong with being a butcher. 
MARTY Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers. 
CLARA I don't. 
Marty looks quickly up at her, then back down. 
MARTY Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too. 
CLARA It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty. 
MARTY That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary? 
Clara looks down at her fingers, her face alive and sensitive. She carefully assembles her words in her mind. Then she looks at the squat butcher across the table from her. 
CLARA Marty, I know you for three hours, but I know you're a good butcher. You're an intelligent, sensitive, decent man. I have a feeling about you like sometimes a kid comes in to see me for one reason or another. And some of these kids, Marty, in my classes, they have so much warmth in them, so much capacity. And that's the feeling I get about you. 
Marty shuts his eyes, then opens them quickly, bows his head. 
CLARA If you were one of my students, I would say, "Go ahead and buy the butcher shop. You're a good butcher." 
Clara pauses. 
MARTY (not quite trusting the timbre of his voice) Well, there's a lotta things I could do with this shop. I could organize my own supermarket. Get a buncha neighborhood merchants together. That's what a lotta them are doing. 
He looks up at her now. 
MARTY Wadda you think? 
CLARA I think anything you want to do, you'll do well. 
Tears begin to flood his eyes again. He quickly looks away. He licks his lips. 
MARTY (still looking down) I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic? 
Clara looks down at her hands. 
CLARA (also in a low voice) Yes, I am. 
Marty looks up at her. 
MARTY I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere. 
CLARA I really should get home... 
She twists in her seat and looks toward the back of the luncheonette. 
MARTY It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there. 
CLARA I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...

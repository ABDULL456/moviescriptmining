Eve hears her name called over the speaker system. \nEVE If you want to discuss your list of problems, you can meet me in my office in twenty minutes. \nRON Twenty minutes?

A perfectly ordered desk.     Eve meticulously records numbers on a chart. \nRON (O.S.) Can you get me AZT? \nEve looks up as Ron walks in and sits down. \nRON Barrow Wilkem just released it for testing, right? This hospital is one of the sites. \nShe nods yes, surprised how well informed he is. \nRON Well can I buy some? \nEVE That isn't how it works. For about a year, a group of patients will either get the drug or a placebo, it's left up to chance, not even the doctors are allowed to know. \nRON You give dyin' people sugar pills? \nEVE It's the only way to know if a drug works. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 16 \nRON Can you get it for me? \nEVE Unfortunately no. But when it's proven to work and if you fit the profile, then yes. \nRON So, you're tellin' me I'm as good as a horse being sold for dog food? \nEve's look says it all.   Ron takes out a list. \nRON Okay, what about in Germany, this Dextran Sulfate, or in France they got DDC, or AL 721 in Israel... I read that one is proven to work and it ain't toxic. \nEVE None of those drugs have been approved by the FDA. \nRON Screw the FDA, I'm gonna be DOA. Do I have to sue this hospital to get me some medicine? \nEVE Mr. Woodroof, I assure you that would be a waste of precious time. \nRon takes a moment, eases up. \nRON Call me Ron, will ya? \nEve doesn't play his game.   She writes something down on a piece of paper. \nEVE There is a support group that meets every day at Draddy Auditorium, perhaps you could share your feelings and concerns... \nRon abruptly stands. \nRON I'm dying and you're tellin' me to go get a hug from a bunch of faggots? \nEve watches as Ron backs away.

Clint, where you hangin' your pants lately brother? \nClint drains his beer, slams it on the table. \nCLINT Get me another beer, will you sweetheart? \nThe guys burst out laughing. \nRON `Fuck you say? \nCLINT I said grab me a cold one, cupcake. \nRon looks at him incredulously. \nRON You askin' me to kick yer ass? \nCLINT Nah, wouldn't wanna get none of that faggot blood on me. \nRon takes a step towards Clint, T.J. gets up and stands between them. \nT.J. C'mon Ron, we don't want no trouble. \nRon puts a fake, friendly hand on T.J.'s shoulder who backs off immediately. Ron moves closer, plays with T.J. and the others.

I thought you're my friend. \nRon looks at him, grabs T.J.'S BEER from his hands and downs it, then fakes as if he's going to hit T.J. with it. T.J. flinches, then Ron SLAMS it on the table.

Ron wanders toward a table lined with LITERATURE. An EFFEMINATE MAN approaches him with a pamphlet. Ron stares at him blankly. The man opens his arms to give him a hug. \nEFFEMINATE MAN It's okay brother. We're all getting -- \nRON Tooth fairy, if we weren't in a public place right now, your teeth would be so far down your throat you'd be usin' your ass to chew food. \nThe Man's eyes go wide as he backs off.

EVE'S HOUSE - DALLAS - NIGHT - MARCH 1987                   62 \nEve pours herself a glass of red wine, cleans the stain left by the bottle on the counter and sits on the couch between paper works. CLOSE ON the TV NEWS ANCHOR. \nNEWS ANCHOR Barrow Wilkem announced today that AZT has been approved as the first drug to treat AIDS. At a cost of $10,000 per year per patient, AZT is the most expensive drug ever marketed. Barrow Wilkem stock jumped a whopping 12% today on the news. \nEve sits, staring at the TV. \n63   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RAYON'S OFFICE - DAY             63 \nThe small room has been turned into an office. In his version of a Nurse outfit, Rayon is taping photos of MARC BOLAN to the wall. We now understand where Rayon's look comes from. TEN MEN linger through the room and into the next one through a connecting door... \nRON'S OFFICE \nRon is behind a desk, atop which sits a gun, a bottle of Tequila and dozens of medical files. On the wall nearby are posters of SPORTS CARS and BIKINI MODELS as well as the Texas Wildflowers painting, news clippings regarding AIDS and a crude CHART listing Patients and their info: SYMPTOMS, DRUGS TAKEN, and ORIENTATION (Gay, Drug Addict, Hemophiliac).

They look at Ron's gun and hesitate to walk in. \nRON Ah shit, did I scare you? Sorry. Welcome to the Dallas Buyers Club. \nRon puts the gun away.   Ian and Michael sit down.   Ian is clearly very ill. \nMICHAEL Rayon said you can get us some medicine. \nRON He told you how it works?

Secondly, stay away from anything that'll cook your insides. Third, get healthy and if your brain's broke, I got something called Peptide T that'll fix it. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 44 \nMichael looks at Ian, not sure what to think.     Ron hands them each a questionnaire. \nRON Fill that there out and don't cheat on the drugs part. Can't help you if I don't know what you're doin'. \nRon puts a box of pills on the desk. \nRON I got more stuff comin' in about a week. Til then, watch what you eat and who you eat. \n64    INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - NURSE STATION - DAY                   64 \nEve paces, checks her watch as Nurse Frazin sits nearby reviewing files. \nEVE He didn't call, leave a message? \nNURSE FRAZIN Nothing.

He stops in his tracks when he sees Eve walking in. \nRON Never mind. I'll call back.   Thank you. Arigato. \nHe hangs up. \nEVE What are you doing here? \nRON I live here. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 45 \nEVE Where's Rayon?     You're roommates now? \nRON Not exactly.

SEVARD What are you talking about? \nRON You call yourself a doctor?   You are a murderer. \nThe patients in the hallway turn their heads towards the commotion. Eve walks out of a room and watches.

The guards back off.    Dr. Sevard watches slack-jawed as Ron continues to spit.   The guards grab him... \n... as Eve watches Sevard, emotionally charged. \nRON (O.C.) You see this? This is harassment. Get me my attorney or do I have to be my own lawyer too. Own doctor, own lawyer. \n125A EXT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - DAY                           125A \nRon slams the car door shut, walks towards the house watching the line of men snaking out the door. He takes them in. Most of them look very sick. His eyes stop on Freddy who's watching him. Freddy smiles as he waves cash at Ron who feigns a smile and walks in. \n125B INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY             125B \nRon enters as Denise finishes handing out information to three very sick MEN.

Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 83 \nRON Hook `em up. \nDENISE We're pretty cash poor. \nRon walks towards his office, stops, turns around and throws his car keys to Denise. \nRON Sell my car and make sure everyone gets what they need. \n125C INT.

She smashes the hammer down again, harder, and again, and again. Her POV: lots of holes in the wall, very far from the nail, and soon hidden by Ron's painting of the Texas Wildflowers. She walks away without straightening it, sits down and starts reading the \"Lancet Study\". \nRON (V.O.) I got three thousand people who need to get their hands on Peptide T. Now.

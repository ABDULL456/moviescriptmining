{"train": "DALLAS BUYERS CLUB \nWritten by \nCraig Borten & Melisa Wallack \nDecember 2, 2012 \n1   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - DALLAS - TEXAS - DAY                        1 \nAmbient sounds of the CROWD, RODEO, SEX, and a strange RINGING fade in along with IMAGES of... \nA COWBOY riding a BULL in an enclosed RODEO ring. \nRON WOODROOF, early 40's, handsome, long sandy hair, denim clad, worn snakeskin boots, dusty, cowboy hat, mirrored aviators, is engaged in wild SEX with a WOMAN. He watches the rodeo through open slats in a BULL STALL as the STEER throws the COWBOY violently thru the air; he lands hard on the dirt. Another WOMAN snorts cocaine and offers some to Ron as he switches over to having SEX with her. \nThe BULL STOMPS the Cowboy with its HOOFS. \nRon climaxes -- pleasure and pain seem to come out of him, but we can't hear him, only this strange RINGING. \nRODEO CLOWNS grab the Cowboy's limp body and drag him out of the ring. \nRon catches his breath; something is off. \nRON (V.O.) Did ya hear Rock Hudson was a cock sucker? \n2   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY                           2 \nA Dallas NEWSPAPER folded in half. July. 1985.      AIDS. New treatment. In Paris. ROCK HUDSON on the cover.      A HAND scribbles numbers over the photo. \nCLINT (V.O.) Where'd ya hear that? \nCLINT (32) a greasy hick who's spent the last five months under the hood of a CHEVY, hands RON a WAD of CASH. \nRON It's called a newspaper.     You heard of it? \nRon smiles, adjusts his cowboy hat as he records some bets. Nearby, BULL FIGHTERS are putting on their clown makeup. \nRON What a waste. All that fine Hollywood pussy on a guy who smokes his friends. \nA HAND comes down through the slats holding a ten dollar bill. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 2 \nRON C'mon Rog, this ain't the sandbox. Twenty's the minimum. \nROG slides another ten down; Ron snatches it. \nROG Who the hell's Rock Hudson? \nRon looks at Rog.   A beat, then he starts laughing, then coughing... \n3   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - BULL STALL - DAY                            3 \n...and coughing as we follow him into the stalls. Ron glad- hands as he goes; it seems everyone knows him but doesn't necessarily like him. He makes his way toward T.J., white trash, pale as winter, who wipes vomit from his chin. As he nervously looks down at the big angry BULL he's about to ride, Ron hands him a pint of tequila. \nRON Calm the nerves, brother.     You look great. \nT.J. takes a swig, gives him a look. \nRON It's your day, I can feel it. \nT.J. watches as Ron takes a bottle of NYQUIL out of his pocket and downs it... to stop his hacking cough. \nT.J. I don't know, Ron. \nRon fans the money out for T.J. to see. \nRON Eight seconds and you'll be gettin blown by a hundred dollar hooker before you can scrape the bullshit off your boots. \nRon winks and smiles. T.J. signals the BULLMAN that he's ready. And in five, four, three, two, one... \nTHE GATE is up, the BULL is out, the crowd is HOLLERING and T.J.'s back is bending in unnatural ways. \nBooks, newspapers, empty beer cans and liquor bottles; on the wall, we may notice a painting of some Texas Wildflowers. Ron stumbles in as the RINGING sound comes back. He stops, steadies himself on a piece of furniture, takes a few steps then collapses, unconscious. \n8   INT. RON'S TRAILER - MORNING                                     8 \nThe first shafts of sunlight fall over Ron, still asleep where he dropped. After a few beats, he stirs, pulls himself on to a chair. \"What the fuck?\". \n9   EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY                                             9 \nLunch time. Already a little drunk, Ron finishes off a pint of whiskey as Clint and a battered T.J. eat sandwiches nearby. Ron starts coughing again as he grabs a packet of cocaine out of his shirt pocket. He slides it across the table to Clint who hands him cash. \nRON That shit is purer than a preacher daughter's pussy. \nCLINT Not after you just coughed your lungs all over it. \nT.J. You think anymore 'bout Saudi Arabia? They need guys over there. \nRON What do you wanna go work for a buncha sand niggas for? \nT.J. They pay five times as much, that's why. \nRon raises his eyebrows, not bad. \nT.J. I'm signing up. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 6 \nRON They got hot ladies over there? \nT.J. It's a Muslim country.    You can't fuck the women. \nRON Now that takes me out right there. \nThe FOREMAN races over to them. \nFOREMAN Woodroof, there's been an accident on platform five. They need an electrician right away! \n10   EXT. DRILL PLATFORM - DAY - LATER                                10 \nA MEXICAN WORKER has his leg caught in the drill. It's severed and he's losing blood fast. Ron walks over. \nRON Dumb spic.     How'd you get your leg in there? \nThe guy's breath is coming in short fast spurts. \nRON Where's the ambulance? \nFOREMAN He's illegal. \nRon takes his OWN shirt off, rips it in half, kneels down next to the MEXICAN, wipes some sweat off his brow and ties a makeshift tourniquet around his leg. \nRon looks to the Foremen. \nRON Go call `em. (the FOREMEN doesn't move) Go FUCKING call `em. \nHe walks off to call.    Ron turns back to the Mexican. \nRON Alright we're going to get you outta there but you gotta stay still until I say get the fuck out and then you get the fuck out. Comprende? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 7 \nThe guy nods. Ron walks over to the electrician's box. He's a little DRUNK. He grabs a wire and is about to cut it. \nRON (CONT'D) Alright, on the count of three.   One, two... \nRon cuts the wire, an electrical spark shoots out and before he can move back the box blows up in his face. Everything goes black. \nRICK FERRIS (V.O.) Azidothymidine, or AZT -- was originally developed as a treatment for cancer. \n11   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY             11 \nBarrow Wilkem rep RICK FERRIS, slick, well-dressed, gold Rolex, 40s, stands before DR. NATHAN SEVARD, 50's, arrogant, DR. EVE SAKS, early 30s, sophisticated, and five other PHYSICIANS, 40s-60s, all members of the hospital board. \nRICK FERRIS With the onset of HIV, however, we at Barrow Wilkem began a trial in which we administered AZT to infected lab animals. Initial findings suggested increased CD4 counts, restored T-cell immunity and also evidence of inducing weight gain. \nSEVARD Isn't it also true that it had some concerning side effects in animal tests, significantly decreasing the animals red and white blood cells? \nDR. SEVARD Your T-cell count is down to nine, a healthy person has five hundred to fifteen hundred. \nRON What the fuck's a three-Cell?! \nDR. SEVARD T-cell.   Frankly we're surprised you're alive. \nRON Well surprise this: you've made a fuckin' mistake! \nRon looks back and forth from Dr. Saks to Sevard.    No mistake. \nRON You must've mixed my blood with some daisy puller or sumptin. \nEVE We ran the blood test several times. \nEve hands him some pamphlets and other paper work. \nEVE That's some information on HIV and AIDS you may find informative and your test results. \nRon flips through the papers. Becomes frustrated by terminology he doesn't understand. \nDR. SEVARD Mr. Woodroof, we're trying to impress upon you the gravity of your situation. (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 11 \nDR. SEVARD (CONT'D) Based on your condition, we estimate that you have about thirty days to get your affairs in order -- \nRON Thirty days? \nRon jumps off the examining table. \nRON What is this shit?! \nThey don't respond. \nRon laughs incredulously and walks towards the door. \nRON I got a news flash for all y'all, there ain't nothin' out there that can kill Ron Woodroof in thirty days. \nRon looks at the papers, tosses them up in the air and exits. \n14   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                       14 \nMusic BLARES as Ron and T.J. party with two hot girls, KELLY and CRYSTAL, 20s. T.J. cuts a line of coke on a mirror while Ron dances over to the girls with SHOTS of Jack Daniels. They both start kissing, then rubbing up against Ron. \n15   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                       15 \nT.J. is having sex with Kelly as Ron kisses Crystal; he leans down, snorts what is probably his fiftieth line of coke. He shakes it off, slams some Jack Daniels from the bottle as if it was Kool Aid. He's obliterated. \nAs Ron stares off at something, T.J. waves at Crystal to join him and Kelly; as she does, we see what Ron is staring at -- a CALENDAR. \nBut its days have no numbers. Except one, in blood RED -- 30. Ron snaps out of his hallucination. \n16   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                       16 \nT.J. sits down next to Ron, takes a rolled up dollar bill and does a line of coke. \nT.J. Damn doctors cut your balls off? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 12 \nRON Shit, you tell `em you got a cold and they'll give you two weeks off. You should try it. \nRon takes the dollar back as T.J. walks to the table to pour himself a drink. \nT.J. Well, you didn't miss nothin' at work. I'd take disability any day. \nRon does a line of coke.   Sees his reflection in the mirror. Pushes it away. \nRON I mean I got a stupid cough and they tell me I got some HIV virus. \nT.J. looks at Ron, hears him but doesn't hear him, maybe it doesn't even register he's so wasted. \nRON (mutters) Hell, like I got the AIDS. Damn hospital, mixed up my blood samples. \nT.J. Man, I went to them doctors once, they tell me I had chlamydia, I came back home I realized I had crabs. \nRon turns around. \nRON I don't want no nurse. I want a doctor. A goddamn doctor! Today! NOW! \nThe Orderly watches Ron and Eve. \nEVE Fine.   How can I help you? \nRON Are you fuckin' deaf, lady? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 15 \nEVE No.   I'm a fucking doctor! \nOh? Ron contemplates Eve, slowly breaking into a smile.    Eve hears her name called over the speaker system. \nEVE If you want to discuss your list of problems, you can meet me in my office in twenty minutes. \nRON Twenty minutes? (he takes a long look at her) I like your style, Doctor. \nRon watches her as she walks away. \n21   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - DR. EVE SAKS' OFFICE - DAY          21 \nDiplomas hang in neat rows. A perfectly ordered desk.     Eve meticulously records numbers on a chart. \nRON (O.S.) Can you get me AZT? \nEve looks up as Ron walks in and sits down. \nRON Barrow Wilkem just released it for testing, right? This hospital is one of the sites. \nShe nods yes, surprised how well informed he is. \nRON Well can I buy some? \nEVE That isn't how it works. For about a year, a group of patients will either get the drug or a placebo, it's left up to chance, not even the doctors are allowed to know. \nRON You give dyin' people sugar pills? \nEVE It's the only way to know if a drug works. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 16 \nRON Can you get it for me? \nEVE Unfortunately no. But when it's proven to work and if you fit the profile, then yes. \nRON So, you're tellin' me I'm as good as a horse being sold for dog food? \nEve's look says it all.   Ron takes out a list. \nRON Okay, what about in Germany, this Dextran Sulfate, or in France they got DDC, or AL 721 in Israel... I read that one is proven to work and it ain't toxic. \nEVE None of those drugs have been approved by the FDA. \nRON Screw the FDA, I'm gonna be DOA. Do I have to sue this hospital to get me some medicine? \nEVE Mr. Woodroof, I assure you that would be a waste of precious time. \nRon takes a moment, eases up. \nRON Call me Ron, will ya? \nEve doesn't play his game.   She writes something down on a piece of paper. \nEVE There is a support group that meets every day at Draddy Auditorium, perhaps you could share your feelings and concerns... \nRon abruptly stands. \nRON I'm dying and you're tellin' me to go get a hug from a bunch of faggots? \nEve watches as Ron backs away. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 17 \nRON Good night, good day, and good riddance. \nEFFEMINATE MAN Is it true you can get it in Mexico?! \nAUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.C.) What about dextran sulfate?! \nAs the chaos and shouting continues, Ron walks out in frustration and we're suddenly-- \n24   INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                                         24 \nCLOSE ON -- a line of flickering CANDLES. \nThat's Ron's POV as he grimaces, despair in his eyes. He doesn't look at the moving, out-of-focus SILHOUETTES in front of him. \nRON (mumbles to himself) I need to slow it down a second, catch my breath. I'm not ready to crawl into a corner. You hear that? I'm not fucking ready. Man, if you're up there you better be listening. (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 19A \nRON (CONT'D) And if there's a chance, if I got one fucking chance, send me a sign. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 20 \nRon downs a shooter and grimaces again. He slams the glass down on a table among empty glasses and looks up at the candles on a stage in front of a STRIPPER, lost in his thoughts. Then he looks up and sees something across the room, past the stripper. She tries to get his attention. \nSTRIPPER If you're not gonna look or buy a dance, you could at least tip me. \nRon stands and throws some bills on the stage. \nRON I'll take a dance, but not fer me. Just shake it, he'll see you. \nRon looks heavenward. \nRON Thanks. \nAnd he walks off towards a man at the end of the bar: the Hispanic Orderly from the hospital. \n25   EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - NIGHT                     25 \nCowboy boots nervously play with a McDonald's Bag on the ground next to a garbage dumpster. They stop when the Hispanic Orderly walks out of the hospital. He gets to the dumpster, throws a BROWN PAPER BAG in it, picks up the McDonald's bag, looks inside and leaves without a word. \n26   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                    26 \nRon sits at the table, removes a box of pills from the bag labeled AZT, FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 21 \nRon removes a pill, decides two is better, washes them down with a beer, and sniffs a line of coke. Looks at his reflection in the turned-off T.V. \n27    EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY                                             27 \nAs Ron pulls up to his jobs site in his battered '73 Lincoln, he spots T.J., Clint and a half dozen other WORKERS through the windshield, all staring at him menacingly. Before Ron gets out, the Foreman emerges through the crowd. Without a word, the guy just slowly shakes his head. Ron gives him the finger and drives off, popping a few more AZT pills. \nA27   EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - NIGHT                        A27 \nThe Hispanic Orderly throws a BROWN PAPER BAG in the dumpster, picks up a fast food bag, and leaves. \n28    EXT. RODEO STADIUM - BLEACHERS - DAY                             28 \nEmpty; closed for the day. Ron sits in the empty bleachers, sweaty and shivering; he looks horrible, maybe disoriented. He pops a pill of AZT and drinks from a bottle of Tequila. \n29    EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT                                        29 \nA labyrinth of identical trailers. Ron wanders, searching for his own. Confused, he changes direction and continues to make his way down the different rows. \nHe stops in front of one and stares at the door where two YOUNG BOYS are seated on the steps, staring back at him. \nRON The hell you doin' here? \nHe waves them aside. As he walks up the steps, his neighbor BUCKY and his WIFE stare at him blankly. \nRON Fuck you doin' in my house? \nRon doesn't realize that he's not at his place. \n30    INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - DR. EVE SAKS' OFFICE - DAY          30 \nSitting on an examining table, meet RAYON, a cross-dresser in his early 30s, in long eyelashes, earrings, painted nails with a pink scarf tied around a full brown curly wig. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 21A \nEVE (reviewing a chart) You missed your last trial appointment. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 22 \nRon I don't know what you're talking about. \nDr. Sevard shakes his head and walks out. \nEVE Get some rest. \nShe follows Sevard out of the room. \nRON Wait.   We were just gettin' somewhere. \nRAYON (O.C.) Honey, you don't have the slightest chance. \nRon turns and sees the hospital curtain being pulled by the PATIENT in the next bed -- it's Rayon. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 24 \nRAYON I'm Rayon. \nRayon gets up and goes over to Ron's bed. \nRON Congratulations, fuck you and go back to your bed. \nRAYON Relax, I don't bite. \nRayon looks Ron over. \nRAYON I guess you're handsome in a Texas hick, white trash, dumb, kinda way. \nRON Get the fuck outta here, whatever you are. \nRAYON Sticks and stones, cowboy. (beat) You wanna play cards? \nRON (perking up) You got cash? \n33   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - NIGHT                        33 \nRon sits cross-legged on his bed across from Rayon, who has a pile of cash before him. As they lay their cards down: \nRAYON Full house. Jacks over threes. \nRON I'da figured you for queens. \nCleaned out, Ron tosses his cards; Rayon scoops up the money. \nRAYON Sorry darlin'. \nAs Ron starts to unfold his legs, he suddenly SCREAMS in pain, grabbing his calf. Rayon grabs his leg, presses his fingers deep into the muscle and massages. Ron contorts in pain, grips the side of the bed. Rayon goes deeper. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 25 \nRAYON Breath.   Relax. \nRon breaths.    Finally the pain subsides and Ron is left limp. \nRAYON Here, drink some water. \nRayon HOLDS the cup so Ron can drink. \nRAYON You gotta stay hydrated or your muscles will cramp. \nRayon starts to massage Ron's other foot. \nRAYON You got nice feet. \nRON Jesus Christ, I'm straight, OK! \nRayon leaves Ron alone.    An awkward beat. \nRON Why the fuck you in here anyway? \nRAYON The AZT trial. My friend is paying me to split my dose with him. That way we'll both get some. \nRON How much is he paying you? \nRAYON Five grand. \n41   INT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY                       41 \nRon enters, blind-sided by the mayhem inside. Boxes of drugs and hospital supplies lie in various stages of unpacking. An INTERPRETER shouts above the din to his wealthy ASIAN CLIENT. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 28 \nDR. VASS (50's), fit but tired, shouts in Spanish to a MAN unloading boxes. He effortlessly switches to Japanese, continues to shout to another worker. \nDr. Vass sees Ron, quickly moves over to him. \nDR. VASS You have something for me to sign? \nRON I'm lookin' for Dr. Vass. \nDr. Vass steps over. \nDR. VASS Speak up. \nRON I'm lookin' for Vass, for some AZT. \nDR. VASS Looking to poison yourself? \nHe grabs an empty bottle of pills on the counter.   Throws it to Ron. \nDR. VASS That's from the chemical manufacturer who makes AZT, Sigma. \nRon looks at the bottle labeled with skull and crossbones: HIGHLY TOXIC, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. \nDR. VASS First thing I tell my patients: you won't find that shit here! \nRon looks confused. A nearby stack of boxes tumbles over. Dr. Vass shouts to no one in particular. \nVASS Who stacked those boxes there? (to Ron) Check in with a nurse. \nDr. Vass is off, ripping open boxes. \nRon starts to cough again.   Badly.   Vass notices, and shouts something in Spanish. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 29 \n42   INT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY                        42 \nFrail and weak, Ron lies on a cot, surrounded by a dozen other PATIENTS of varied nationalities. A NURSE records his vital signs in a chart, then hands it off to Dr. Vass, who peruses the information and begins reading aloud: \nDR. VASS Cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine, AZT. (to Ron) That's what I call a recipe for disaster. \nRON (looking around) Doc, this place is a shit-hole. \nDR. VASS Who said I was a Doctor? They revoked my license to practice three years ago, that's why I'm down in this shit-hole. \nRON Why?   What'd you do? \nDR. VASS I didn't play ball. \nRon smiles. \nDR. VASS These drugs you're doing, they're breaking down your immune system, making you susceptible to infections. \nRON So cocaine gave me pneumonia? \nDR. VASS Cocaine made you more susceptible. As did AZT. \nRON I thought AZT's supposed to help me. \nDR. VASS The only people AZT helps are the people who sell it. (beat) It kills every cell it comes in contact with, good and bad. \nRON So medically speakin', I kicked my own ass! Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 30 \nDR. VASS (nods as he writes) I'm prescribing a regimen of vitamins as well as the mineral zinc to build your immune system back up. You'll also be taking Aloe and essential fatty acids. \n43   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - DAY                          43 \nIn gloves and surgical masks, Eve looks on Nurse Frazin who is drawing blood from Rayon's arm, five other AIDS PATIENTS nearby. That done, the Nurse dispenses meds, giving each patient a paper pill cup marked with a different NUMBER. Rayon takes his pill, winces; Eve makes a mental note, then walks down the line of patients, touching each of them. She comes to Rayon, gives his shoulder a squeeze, then exits. BLACK. SUPER: \nSix months Later \nRon sits behind a table when a MAN in a suit walks in.   He takes off his jacket and sits. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 32A \nRICHARD BARKLEY I'm Richard Barkley from the Food and Drug Administration office. \nRon nods.   A beat. \nRICHARD BARKLEY You're a priest? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 33 \nRon smiles.   The customs agent doesn't. \nRICHARD BARKLEY You have over 2,000 pills here. You are only allowed to bring in a ninety day supply. \nRON Well as I told the gentlemen, I am a sick man. I have cancer. I take 22 pills a day and these here vials of Vitamin A, C, E and Zinc. That there is ninety days. \nThe man looks at Ron, not really buying it. He takes a bottle of Peptide T and looks at it. \nRICHARD BARKLEY Vitamins? (no answer from Ron) You do realize that importing unapproved drugs for sale is a very serious offense? \nRON Well, as I said, they're not for sale. And they ain't illegal, just \"unapproved.\" \nA long beat; they stare at each other. \nRICHARD BARKLEY If we find the slightest indication that you're selling these drugs for profit, you will be thrown in jail... Father. \nRON Then I promise to take each and every one of them pills myself. In fact this present detainment has already put me off schedule... Son. \n50A   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - RECEPTION DESK - DAY               50A \nRon talks to Nurse Frazin. \nRON I'm looking for Dr. Eve Saks. \nNURSE FRAZIN She's not here today. \nNurse Frazin leaves. Ron looks over the counter, sees something, looks around... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 33A \n51   INT. EVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DALLAS - NIGHT                51 \nPerfectly ordered and spotless except for files and reports piled on the floor. An exhausted Eve takes her lab coat off, picks up a study and aims for the kitchen when a KNOCK comes at the door. \nEVE It's open! \nRon comes in. \nEVE Mr. Woodroof... Ron, I thought you were... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 34 \nRON (cutting her off) Dead? Sorry for bargin' in. \nEVE What are you doing here?   You look great. \nRON Actually I look amazin'.   But you, you look like shit. \nEVE What happened to you? \nRON So you got any music?   Or crackers? \nEVE I'm sorry, but what is this? \nRON It's a celebration of how absolutely fuckin' wrong you were. \nRon holds up a bottle of sparkling wine. \nEVE Excuse me? \nRON Thirty days you said! Well here it is months later and I'm goin' like gangbusters. Now if that don't call for a little Cheez Whiz on a Ritz, I don't know what does! \nRon heads for the refrigerator. \nEVE No.   Don't... I don't really eat here. \nThe DOORBELL interrupts them. Ron watches as Eve crosses and opens the door, admitting Rayon, looking like shit and shaking badly in a full-length, pink fur coat. \nAs Nurse Frazin monitors an AIDS PATIENT receiving a blood transfusion, Eve reviews his chart. \nEVE This man also had a transfusion? \nNURSE FRAZIN The AZT. We can tell who's on it by the symptoms. Most of them need new blood. \nEVE (looking at chart) He's actually getting worse. \nEve looks at the sleeping Patient; she reaches for his hand. \nNURSE FRAZIN So why are they stopping the trial? \nEVE What do you mean? \nNURSE FRAZIN Barrow Wilkem, didn't you see the memo? They claim most people are feeling better and fewer people are dying. \nEVE Really? \n56   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY                     56 \nIn mid-conversation, Eve follows Dr. Sevard down the hall. \nEVE Transfusions always makes patients feel better. Give the placebo patients new blood and they'll feel better too. \nSevard stops to sign a form for a NURSE. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 38 \nEVE I have questions about the drug's safety. I've seen it drop white blood cells in a lot of my patients making them more susceptible to infection. \nDR. SEVARD It's Barrow Wilkem's call, Eve. So we can get the drug to the people who need it. \nEVE After six months? \nDR. SEVARD Their trial results are overwhelmingly positive. AZT is working. \nEVE But we have no idea what the long term effects are. It's irresponsible. \nDR. SEVARD These people die, Eve.     There are no long-term effects. \nEVE Can I see a copy of the study? \nDR. SEVARD It's still being written.    Here. \nHe produces a two page document and hands it to Eve. \nEVE A press release from the NIH? \nSevard crosses off.   Eve stands there, stunned. \nHer POV on the press release: \"HIV-positive patients are twice as likely to get AIDS if they don't take AZT.\" \n57   INT. RON'S CAR - DALLAS STREET - DAY                             57 \nRon is parked on a quiet street. He counts his cash and is startled when suddenly a WOMAN gets in the passenger seat. \nRON (pulls a 9mm pistol) Jesus Mother Mary Fuckin' Christ! \nShe's not a woman, it's... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 39 \nRAYON I was looking for you, Lonestar. \nRON I could of killed you! \nRAYON I feel better! I wanted to thank you. \nRON Good for you. Now get the fuck out! \nRAYON I need more of that cocktail shit you got! \nRON Listen Tinkerbell, unless you got cash or some new clients for me, I'm busy. Now get the f... \nRAYON (interrupting) Let's just do this quickly so I can get the fuck out! \nRAYON You gotta be kidding me?! \nRON No, perfect place. We gotta lay low. Don't wanna get busted. I got a plan. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 41 \n61   INT. DALLAS BUYER'S CLUB MOTEL - RON'S OFFICE - DAY                61 \nRon stacks boxes in the room among his personal stuff.   The place looks like what it is: a cheap sex motel. \nRAYON This place is disgusting.    We need to disinfect. \nRON Do not use the word \"we\". Now you wanna put your apron on and fly around on your broom, be my guest. \nJust then, a KNOCK on the open door.    Rayon and Ron look up to see attorney DAVID WAYNE, 40s. \nRON Howdy Counselor, welcome. \nRAYON Hi, I'm Rayon. \nWayne takes in Rayon. \nRON He's my partner.   Business partner. \nRon throws a key to Rayon. \nRON Your office's next door. \nRayon gets the message and exits.   Wayne looks around at all the boxes. \nDAVID WAYNE Jesus, how many truck loads you bring back from Mexico? All for your own personal use? (gives Ron a folder) Here's the paper work for your LLC. I don't even want to know what it's for. \nRON Don't worry, Counselor. I ain't selling drugs anymore. (off Wayne's look of surprise) I'm giving them away. For free. (showing the folder) By selling memberships. Four hundred a month in dues gets you all the meds you need. (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 42 \nRON (CONT'D) \nWayne looks at him, thinking it over. \nDAVID WAYNE You son of a bitch! \nRON Bitches. Plural. There's a bunch of faggots runnin' a hell of a club up in New York. That's where I got the idea. (beat) Welcome to the Dallas Buyers Club. \n62   INT. EVE'S HOUSE - DALLAS - NIGHT - MARCH 1987                   62 \nEve pours herself a glass of red wine, cleans the stain left by the bottle on the counter and sits on the couch between paper works. CLOSE ON the TV NEWS ANCHOR. \nNEWS ANCHOR Barrow Wilkem announced today that AZT has been approved as the first drug to treat AIDS. At a cost of $10,000 per year per patient, AZT is the most expensive drug ever marketed. Barrow Wilkem stock jumped a whopping 12% today on the news. \nEve sits, staring at the TV. \n63   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RAYON'S OFFICE - DAY             63 \nThe small room has been turned into an office. In his version of a Nurse outfit, Rayon is taping photos of MARC BOLAN to the wall. We now understand where Rayon's look comes from. TEN MEN linger through the room and into the next one through a connecting door... \nRON'S OFFICE \nRon is behind a desk, atop which sits a gun, a bottle of Tequila and dozens of medical files. On the wall nearby are posters of SPORTS CARS and BIKINI MODELS as well as the Texas Wildflowers painting, news clippings regarding AIDS and a crude CHART listing Patients and their info: SYMPTOMS, DRUGS TAKEN, and ORIENTATION (Gay, Drug Addict, Hemophiliac). Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 43 \nRAYON (as he enters) Roanie, we have two new customers. \nRon looks up from the chart he's filling out. \nRON Bring 'em in and if you call me Roanie again... (grabs his gun) ...I'ma use this gun to give you the sex change you been hopin' for. \nRayon shakes his head, walking off, as IAN and MICHAEL, a conservative gay couple in their 50s appear in the doorway. They look at Ron's gun and hesitate to walk in. \nRON Ah shit, did I scare you? Sorry. Welcome to the Dallas Buyers Club. \nRon puts the gun away.   Ian and Michael sit down.   Ian is clearly very ill. \nMICHAEL Rayon said you can get us some medicine. \nRON He told you how it works? Treatments and drugs are free, but the membership, 400$. \nRON This is the shit that'll rot your insides. What a surprise, FDA approved. What the fuck is potassium benzoate? \nRAYON Preservative. \nRayon throws a pack of bologna in the cart. \nRON You fuckin' kiddin' me? \nDefiant, Rayon puts his hand on his hips. \nRON Don't pollute me with that processed crap. I'm eatin' healthy. \nRon removes the bologna and throws it at Rayon who almost fumbles the catch. \nRAYON It's protein, it's good for you. \nRON Put it back. \nRayon tosses it back at Ron. \nRAYON You can't tell me what to do. \nRon throws the Bologna harder at Rayon, who catches it like a pro football player, much to Ron's surprise. Rayon enjoys the moment and disappears down the isle, proud, with his bologna under the arm. \nRon turns the corner of the next isle. T.J. is there putting a case of BEER in his shopping cart. An uncomfortable moment passes. \nT.J. Uh, hey Ron. \nRon nods at him. \nT.J. How're you doin'? \nRON Fine. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 47 \nRayon appears at the other end of the isle.      T.J. sees him and laughs. \nT.J. Jesus, faggots everywhere. \nT.J. looks at Ron for confirmation.   Rayon reaches them and throws a bag of chips in the cart. \nRAYON Hi. \nT.J. and Ron don't answer.    An awkward beat. \nRON This is Rayon. (off T.J.'s silence) He said hi to you. \nRayon sticks out his hand.    T.J. doesn't respond. \nRON Shake his hand, T.J. \nHe doesn't. \nRON Come on, buddy, what's your fuckin' problem? \nT.J. gives Ron the finger. Ron grabs T.J.'s hand and twists it behind his back. T.J. resists, tries to get out of Ron's grip but can't. He finally extends his hand. Rayon shakes it. \nRON Good. Now get the fuck outta here and go back to your miserable life. \nT.J. stares at Ron for a while, angry, humiliated, then leaves. Ron watches him go. Rayon stares at Ron, unsure of how to react to this. A subtle smile appears on his face. \nRON What? \nRayon's moved that Ron stuck up for him.   He starts to tear up. \nRon sees the bag of chips in the cart and throws it at Rayon. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 48 \n67   EXT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY                   67 \nTwo dozen MEN, all prospective buyers, snake down the long exterior hallway. A NEIGHBOR walks by, disgusted, hugging the wall as he makes it to his own door. \nThat is Ron's POV following at a distance as he arrives from the supermarket. \nDR. SEVARD Well the FDA confiscated over two thousand vials of alpha interferon... that he was about to sell to AIDS patients. Our patients! Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 54A \nEVE (testing the waters) Actually, I've been reading about Buyers Clubs. They say they found other drugs that are eliminating symptoms. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 55-57 \nDR. SEVARD Without controlled trials, we'll never be able to cure this thing because we'll have no legitimate data. Tell your patients to stay away from him. \nWith that, Sevard exits.   On Eve. \n83   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RAYON'S OFFICE - DAY             83 \nLots of activity, many EMPLOYEES on phones, SHIPMENTS coming in, new CLIENTS lined up through the connecting door into... \nRON'S OFFICE. Maps of the different locations around the country where buyers clubs have shown up, New-York, San- Francisco, Miami. \nRAYON (holding a phone) This guy says the Florida Buyers Club is cheaper. \nRON Then tell him to move to the fuckin' sunshine state! \nA phone cradled in his neck, Ron accepts a shipment of several dozen boxes from a guy we saw earlier in Mexico. \nRON (into phone) What do you mean you can't get it back?! It was authorized by a doctor! \nDAVID WAYNE (O.C.) The FDA said it was a Japanese doctor with no legal standing. What can I say, they make it up as they go. \nRON 84               Then check China, Amsterdam and Israel               84 cause that's where I'm fuckin' goin'! \n85   MONTAGE                                                          85 \nPLANES take off and LAND; we track Ron making his way through various airports and international cities; we see a series of Departure Boards - Tel Aviv; Amsterdam; Hong Kong. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 58 \n86   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RON'S OFFICE - DAY              86 \nNot yet open for business. As Rayon and his friend SUNNY hang photos on a freshly-painted nearby wall. Eve stands across from Ron with her arms crossed. \nRON I got first hand experience with all of 'em. And I'll tell you something else, if I don't know what somethin' is, or don't trust the white coat who's trying to sell it to me, I fed-ex it to my lab in Seattle and they test if for me. \nEve looks around at all the boxes and files. \nRON Then I test it all on myself before I give it to anyone else. (off her look) I'm my own lab rat. \nHe grabs a box of meds. \nRON Compound Q. You know what happens if I come off it? My hair falls out, I lose weight, I can't get my dick up and I start to die. I got three hundred other people with the same experience. (grabs another box) Peptitde T. Gets rid of dementia. Stop takin' it and you can't think straight, walk straight, or act straight. I got over two hundred people on that. You following me? (grabs another box) DDC and DDI, both toxic, but in small doses, helps kick opportunistic infections. \nEVE Ron, I respect that you're learning about your illness but some of these people should be in the hospital. \nRON All the hospital wants is to serve up AZT. \nEVE AZT helps eradicate the virus. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 58A \nRON Fuck the virus, once you got that, you're married to it. I'm more concerned about my symptoms and survival. I mean, I'm no scientist but... \nRAYON (mocking him) You're not? 'Cause you sound so... scientific. \nRayon and Sunny laugh like children. \nRON You fuckin' high again? \nRAYON (giggling) I dunno. \nRON Are you listenin' to what I'm sayin' here about usin' that shit? (then; noticing) And what the fuck did you do to my wall?! \nRAYON It's cranberry mocha.     For the holidays. \nRon looks back at Eve, exasperated.    He grabs a folder off his desk. \nRON People can live with this thing for longer than they're saying. Ninety-six- percent of people diagnosed with AIDS in the U S of A will be dead in under six months. \nEVE I know the statistics. \nRON Then use them. Why give people AZT when their immune system is broken? It's fuckin' toxic! \n101   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RON'S OFFICE - DAY              101 \nWith the line snaking out the door, Ron sits behind the desk dealing with a BUYER. \nRON That's four pills, three times a day with food. The vitamins too. \nAs Ron starts putting the meds in a paper bag, we hear a commotion coming from the other room. \nRAYON (O.C.) I'm not letting you in, you have a search warrant? \nRAYON'S OFFICE: \nRayon, still in his robe, stands blocking the doorway to Richard Barkley who signals to Tucker to take over. Tucker gestures to Rayon to move out of the way. He walks in with a FELLOW POLICE OFFICER and two DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (DEA) agents. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 67 \nRON The hell's all this? \nTUCKER Sorry, Ron. (to the Buyers) Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you all to leave the premises in an orderly fashion, please! \nSome GRUMBLING as the Buyers file out.   Barkley enters. \nRICHARD BARKLEY Mr. Woodroof, I have a court order permitting us to confiscate any and all non-FDA approved drugs or supplements. \nRON In other words, my entire inventory. \nRon looks over at one of the FDA Agents, who has begun opening boxes. As the Agent removes an unmarked bottle: \nRON Aloe vera! It's a plant. What do you give a shit if people eat plants? \nRICHARD BARKLEY It's improperly labeled. That's a violation of FDA regulations. \nRON It's a bullshit technicality and you know it! (to Rayon) Get my lawyer on the phone. \nRayon crosses off to make the call. \nRICHARD BARKLEY Our primary concern is preventing a market for illegal drugs. \nRON Illegal? Unapproved! These are vitamins and minerals, for Chrissake! \nRICHARD BARKLEY Vitamins and minerals that gave you a heart attack, remember? \nRON I'm not selling that stuff, you confiscated it, remember? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 68 \nThe agents confiscate lots of small blue boxes and put them in an evidence bag. \nRON (sarcastic) What's the matter, you got Alzheimer, Richard? (pointing at the blue boxes) 'Cause Peptide T works for Alzheimers too, ya know? \nTucker looks over at Ron. \nRON Come on, it's a protein! Effective with dementia which I have. Why don't you just look at my research? \nRICHARD BARKLEY Woodroof, I wouldn't want you to spend your last days in jail. If you have a product you'd like tested, fill out an application and go through the process. \nRON Don't threaten me! I'm unapproved motherfucker! The process? That's just FDA bullshit for pay up! 250 million worth! \nThe Agents exit carrying boxes and bags; Barkley gives Ron a big smile. \nRICHARD BARKLEY You'll be receiving your fine for non compliance and improper labelling soon. \nBarkley leaves followed by Tucker who looks sorry for Ron. Rayon comes back to the room. He takes a last peek through the window, and pulls boxes of Peptide T from underneath his robe, with the smile of a kid on his face, handing Ron the phone. \nRAYON Your lawyer. \nRON These fuckers are comin' at me from all angles! I wanna file a restraining order! \nDAVID WAYNE (O.C.) What?   Against who? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 69 \nRON The Government and their fuckin' FDA! \nHe slams down the phone. \nRON We gotta relocate! \nTucker opens the BLUE BOX and removes a Buyers Club bottle of Peptide T and a note. \nRON (V.O.) Tuck, sorry to hear about your dad's Alzheimer. This will help. Woodroof. \n107   INT. SMALL HOME - DALLAS - DAY                                   107 \nThe house hasn't seen new carpet since the 60's. The conservative gay couple we met earlier, Ian and Michael, show Ron around. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 72 \nRON This place is crap, I'll give you one fifty a month and fifty percent off your meds. \nIAN Mr. Woodroof -- \nRON Don't try to con me -- \nIAN We don't want money. \nRON What do you want? \nIAN The house is free.   We want to help. \nRon looks from Ian and Michael and back again. \nRON Oh.   Well that's good news. \nIan sticks his hand out, Ron shakes it. \n108   INT. DRADDY AUDITORIUM - DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT            108 \nThe same meeting from the beginning; packed with mostly gay MEN. A different group of people are here now, but the atmosphere is the same. \nRon stands at the back of the auditorium with Rayon at his side chewing gum like a baseball coach. Ron flips the lights off and on... \nRON Hello... Howdy... \nThe CROWD calms down, turns to look at Ron. \nRON I got what you got and I have traveled the world looking for alternative medications, stuff not available yet in America, thanks to the good folks down at the FDA. \nA murmur travels through the audience as people listen. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 73 \nRON Some of you may have heard of the Dallas Buyers Club, an organization I founded with my friend Rayon. Risk might be high, but what the hell, you're risking your life every time you go into one of them there hospitals. (beat) I don't know where most of the people are who were at these meetings a year and a half ago... maybe they lost interest... maybe they're dead... but I'm here. I'm walking, talking, breathing... and ain't no one gonna take that away from me. I gotta life to lead. \nA murmur travels through the audience as people listen. \nThe point of our club was to get alternative treatments and medications into the hands of those who need 'em. (beat) The cost of joining this club used to be $400 a month. Well I'm here tonight with a special offer. Anyone who's interested can come and sign up for the one-time only, rock bottom price of zero. (beat) That's right, I'm giving it away folks. \nMore murmurs through the crowd. \nRON HIV don't mean shit. You ain't sick, you ain't sick. Period. You tell a guy he's got a week to live? Shit, he's already dead. You tell a guy he can keep on goin'? He'll find a way. Remember, ya ain't dyin'. But if you think you are then you ain't got nothing to lose. \nRon does a double take at Rayon who is staring at him with tears in his eyes. Someone hesitantly applauds. A MAN gets up and walks to Ron, slowly OTHERS do too. \n109   INT. FIRST BANK - DALLAS - DAY                                 109 \nA financial institution. A MAN, 50s, walks over to the waiting area and coldly signals a younger man to follow him. This is Rayon, hair slicked back, devoid of makeup and jewelry, wearing Ron's business suit. He gets up. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 73A \n110   INT. MAN'S OFFICE - FIRST BANK - DALLAS - DAY                 110 \nRayon looks at the various family PHOTOS which decorate the bookshelves of the man's office who sits behind his desk. \nRAYON Guess I didn't make the cut. \nTHE MAN You made that choice yourself. \nRAYON It wasn't a choice, Dad. \nRayon's father looks at him with disdain. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 74 \nRAYON'S FATHER What do you want, Raymond? \nRAYON I'm fine, thanks.    And you?   Long time no see. \nEve doesn't respond. \nRON You know this rule that the FDA just passed was just bullshit. Ain't no doc from here to the north pole will write them. \nEVE I know and I can't either. I'm sorry. We can't write scripts for random people and random drugs. Plus what if something goes wrong with these drugs? We could get sued, lose our license. \nRON Okay!   Never hurts to ask. \nEve takes the hat off and hands it to Ron. \nRON Keep it, nurse Ratched! \nRon exits the room leaving Eve with the sombrero.

Rayon, extremely sick, holds a bottle of POPPERS, watches Sunny dance around the room amongst the stacked moving boxes. Rayon starts coughing into a scarf, pulls it away, it's covered with BLOOD. Sunny stops dancing. \nSUNNY You need to go to the hospital. \nRayon can't respond. \nSUNNY That's it.      I'm driving you, right now. \nSunny walks over and picks up Rayon, throws him over his shoulder. \nRAYON Okay, okay. I'll go. Put me down.

VASS Secretions that the caterpillar uses to protect itself during the incubation period... \nDr. Vass empties the contents of the syringe into a test-tube. \nDR. VASS ...act as a non-toxic anti-viral for humans. The answer to a question. \nDr. Vass sets the test-tube on a tray, crosses to a table lined with boxes, postmarks in different languages covering their surfaces. He rummages on the table, finds a report. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 78 \nDR. VASS (handing it to Ron) The Lancet medical journal published a study conducted in France. Proves AZT alone is too toxic for most to tolerate, and had no lasting effect on HIV blood levels. Of course, Barrow Wilkem and the NIH did not include the study in their press release. \nRon takes the study, looks it over. \nRON Doesn't surprise me at all. \nVass hands Ron some more paperwork. \nDR. VASS These are early trial results for Fluconazole. \nRON The anti-fungal, right?   I read about this. \nDR. VASS You want to take some home? \nRON As much I can carry. \nDR.

Mr. Woodroof, will you kindly tell us what you are doing? \nEveryone turns to look at Ron. \nRON I'm givin' people information... on this trial I'm in, right now. I want everyone here to know what's going on. \nRICHARD BARKLEY And what is going on? \nRON Why was Peptide T cut off? A non-toxic drug, that I have proof works and that according to the National Institute of Mental Health, is completely safe. \nRICHARD BARKLEY Mr. Woodroof, you are nothing but a common drug dealer-- \nRON I'm a drug dealer? You're the drug dealer. The pharmaceutical companies are the drug dealers. \nRon grabs a bag of jelly beans out of the hands of a person in the audience. Holds them up. \nRON The yellow number fives, red, green and purple dye you put in this here candy causes seven kinds a cancer. \nA SECURITY MAN approaches, Ron walks away from him. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 87 \nRON The aspartame in my diet coke, the steroids in my meat, the hormones in my milk, the antibiotics in the chicken. Now that's the shit the FDA knows will kill you.

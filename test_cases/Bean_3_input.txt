KEVIN That's one - way of looking at it.        You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'. 
DAVID Well, there is that ... 
KEVIN (TO BEAN ) I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers? 
BEAN Ahm.... 
CUT TO: 
INT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.   KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
KEVIN is playing an adventure game: `GOBLINS 2' [This game exists.] The GOBLINS chuckle and make stupid noises that BEAN can imitate. A catchy piece of music accompanies the game. 
The computer monitor shows the inside of the WIZARD's house. KEVIN moves the GOBLINS, and two little characters, FINGUS and WINKLE, around the room by clicking on areas in the room with his mouse. 
BEAN and KEVIN are both wearing pointed goblin hats made from newspaper. 
KEVIN It's so embarrassing. All the guys I know are on Goblins 3 and I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2. 
BEAN is interested in the computer because he likes the cute little GOBLINS. He gets his delighted face right up to the screen. He sings along with the catchy tune. KEVIN is getting frustrated. 
KEVIN Come on, winkle. 
KEVIN clicks on a cuckoo clock in the WIZARD's room.       The cuckoo pops out holding a key in its beak. 
KEVIN It's gotta be here.     Something to get the key away from the stupid cuckoo. 
BEAN scans the monitor screen: he spots a little frog at the bottom of the scene. His eyes light up. He takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly clicks on the frog. 
BEAN Click, click, click, click, click ... 
The frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone.       KEVIN gets excited. 
KEVIN How'd you do that!?     That was so obvious!!! 
BEAN grins and makes WINKLE pick up the stone. Then he clicks through to inside the wizard's house. He makes WINKLE throw the stone at the cuckoo which instantly drops the key from its beak. 
KEVIN Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool! 
KEVIN slaps BEAN on the back.      BEAN is delighted.   Close on monitor, showing The Goblin game- 
CUT TO: 
INT.   LIVING ROOM.    DAY 
Another game. JENNIFER'S Super Nintendo game on TV in the lounge area. It is a Gothic game where he-man types attack Vampires and bats with swords. 
DAVID is in the kitchen - setting out the roses in a vase.    The door opens - enter ALISON. Some tension. 
DAVID Hi, 
ALISON Hi..... (PAUSE ) Roses. 
DAVID Yes. And    I have a wine for dinner that will kill you. 
ALISON Great. ( SHE SETTLES A LITTLE ) You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you? 
DAVID Sort of half..... 
ALISON Meaning? 
DAVID I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake. 
ALISON Honestly David, you're so spineless. 
Pause. Jennifer looks around.   She can't help but hear.   Not a happy experience. 
DAVID Roses.     Wine. 
He is asking her for softness. Pause. At which moment BEAN enters wearing pointy hat. He helps himself to a melon from a bowl. He grins and exits. ALISON looks at DAVID sadly. 
ALISON But no real change. 
Almost instantly, BEAN is back. He rummages through a drawer and takes out some large elastic bands. And leaves. 
ALISON I really do need some time on my own. Away from here. 
DAVID Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak. And you can't leave. ( HE PICKS UP THE BAMBI ) I've got Bambi. You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk. 
ALISON Okay. ( GHOST OF A SMILE ) Put Bambi down, and we'll talk.

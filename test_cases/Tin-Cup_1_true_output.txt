Wright looks at the monitor where Tin Cup stands among some trees. 
BEN WRIGHT This is disaster for McAvoy. After losing three shots to par in the first four holes, he should have just taken iron off the tee to get the ball in play. Does he have any shot at all, Gary McCord? 
132   EXT. FIFTH HOLE - DAY                                      132 
Tin Cup's ball lies on dirt next to the trunk of a tree. He surveys his options. Behind him, wearing a headset, McCord analyzes the situation for the TV viewers. 
McCORD This is definite jail. This is life without parole. His only chance to stage a jail-break is go at the ball left-handed and hope he can somehow snake it back into the fairway, and save par from there. 
Tin Cup glares balefully back at McCord. Then he walks over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green from it. He walks back for his ball, turns to McCord... and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in Tin Cup's eyes. 
TIN CUP Fifty bucks says I knock it on... with a seven iron. 
And he selects the seven iron, addresses the ball right- handed, and: 
He swings -- the ball rockets low off his club, and... 
... it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and... 
... it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin. 
The gallery goes crazy as Tin Cup steps from the woods collecting his money from McCord while jabbing a taunting finger at Simms.

Nantz and Wright stare at the monitors. 
NANTZ That took balls... 
134   EXT. GOLF COURSE                                            134 
Simms ignores Tin Cup's taunt, and lines up his shot. 
SIMMS (to himself) That's just Roy being Roy. Just wait him out, Dave. Just make pars. Let him make the mistakes. 
And he hits his iron to the fat part of the green, and -- 
TIN CUP (O.S.) Beauty, Dave.    Par written all over it. 
135   EXT. LEADER BOARD                                           135

Tin Cup intently follows the flight of his iron shot, as: 
The ball lands near the front of the green, bounces, then rolls, following the contour of the green. It finally stops five feet from the pin. 
A SWELLING, DEAFENING ROAR from the GALLERY accompanies the unfolding shot, and --

Jacobsen looks toward the roar at the ninth green. 
JACOBSEN He's making his run.

Molly and Doreen watch Tin Cup drain a putt. 
MOLLY (still watching Tin Cup) So why'd you leave him? 
DOREEN You ever dated a guy who actually believes in soul mates? 
MOLLY Actually, no. 
DOREEN He thinks he's a tough guy, but he's a hopeless romantic. 
And as the gallery falls silent, she turns to watch Tin Cup.

Tin Cup's firmly-struck putt spins out of the hole.    The GALLERY GROANS, sharing his agony, and --

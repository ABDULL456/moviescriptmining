RIGGAN (Smiles.) Yeah, I-- This is nothing. Shaving. He cleans his hand against his trousers. 
LESLEY I just want to say I'm sorry. 
RIGGAN For what? 
LESLEY I knew what Mike was capable of, and I brought him in, anyway. 
RIGGAN You did good. 
Lesley nods. A beat. 
LESLEY Tomorrow's my first opening night on Broadway. 
RIGGAN Mine too. 
LESLEY And I want you to know that, whatever happens, I'll always be grateful to you for that. 
RIGGAN Me too. It's going to be great. Full house.

She looks at him with tender eyes. Then we follow her along the corridor until she passes by Mike's dressing room. Mike half-opens the door and sees Lesley walking by. He has a black eye. He waits for Lesley to be completely gone, and then he comes out of his dressing room and we follow him up the stairs to... 
38   EXT. ROOFTOP - THEATER - DUSK                                  38 ...the rooftop. He finds Sam standing on the cornice, looking at the street. 
MIKE For fuck's sake, just jump already. 
Sam stares out, a smile creeping over her face. SAM How did you know I'd be up here? 
MIKE I didn't. I was just hoping. 
Silence. Mike walks up next to her and stares out as well. 
SAM Where's Lesley? 
MIKE Moving on. 
SAM Smart girl... 
MIKE I appreciate that. A beat. 
SAM Ready for the last preview? (Noticing his black eye.) Who did that to you? 
Mike smiles. No answer. 
SAM (CONT'D) Could have been anybody, I guess. (After a beat.) I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley. He barely says no, smiling, and lights a cigarette. She understands. 
(CONTINUED) 
SAM (CONT'D) Oh, don't tell me... 
Silence. 
MIKE What's the worst thing he ever did to you? 
Sam is surprised by the question. She thinks for a moment. SAM He was never around, so... 
MIKE That was--? 
SAM No. That was-- Who gives a shit. It was the way he tried to make up for it by constantly trying to convince me I was special. (A beat.) What about you? 
MIKE My dad? 
SAM Yeah. 
MIKE He pretended I was his son. 
She stares him down. Silence. 
SAM So, what happens now? 
MIKE I have no idea... SAM Yeah... 
A beat.

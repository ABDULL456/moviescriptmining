(TOO MANCUSO) Sorry, Captain. I think -- 
MANCUSO 
(TO RAMIIUS) You're heading straight into that torpedo. 
RAMIUS I know. 
IN THE CIC aboard the frigate. Helms, Greer and Tyler lean over the display. Curry studies the blips: 
CURRY 
(EYES NARROWING) Red October is turning directly into the t orpedos path. 
GREER Mother of God. 
ON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, it's a deathwatch. Ryan thinks of Sally. Mancuso stares at Ramius. Goddamned if he's gonna be the one to whine. 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo steady bearing zero-two-zero. Range five thousand yards. 
RAMIUS 
(ON MIKE) Me]ekhin. Can you give me any more speed? 
MELEKHIN (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Negative. We're going as fast as we can. 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Estimate range approximately three thousand yards. Closing fast. 
ON THE DALLAS Thompson's still outside the sonar shack. The COB's at Fare control. As before, Beaumont works sonar. 
THOMPSON Why is he heading into the torpedo? Is he trying to kill himself? 
COB Mr. Thompson. We have a solution on the Soviet Akula. Shouldn't we shoot back? 
THOMPSON 
(ANGRY) She didn't shoot at us. Anyway, I can't attack a Soviet submarine. I have no goddam authorization! 
ON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, an. payers have turned to stone. 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo bearing steady at zero-two- zero. Best range nine hundred yards. Estimate impact in twenty seconds. 
RAMIUS 
(TO RYAN) What books? 
RYAN Pardon? 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Fifteen seconds. 
RAMIUS What books did you write? 
RYAN 
(HOARSELY) I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey, called, Fighting Sailor. It was about tam in combat -- 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Ten seconds. 
RAMIUS I know this book. I have read some parts of it. 
(RYAN BLINKS) Your conclusions were wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly. CRASH. The Conn ROCKS. Sound of TORPEDO BREAKING UP. Metal SCRAPES along the SHIP. Realizing what's going on: 
- MANCUSO I'll be dammed.

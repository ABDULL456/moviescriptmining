TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT 
Ted hangs up the phone.  Looks around.  Jimmy's gone. But his SHINY NEW BIKE is left behind. 
INT. CINCINNATI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
Not much of a place. A middle-aged TORCH SINGER croons "MY ROMANCE."  Ted and Julie find their way to corner table. Keeping an eye out for Principal Merkin. 
TED I don't know. This place seems pretty tame. 
JULIE You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood? 
TED At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue. 
JULIE Amen to that. 
Their heads are very close together. A conspiratorial tête-à tête. 
TED Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart. 
JULIE I'm trembling with excitement. 
TED That has more to do with your proximity to me. 
JULIE (playing along) My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh. 
TED I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that. 
JULIE I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy. 
TED Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing. 
JULIE Wearing them?  Or humping them? 
TED My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs. 
JULIE That's refreshingly deviant. 
TED What about you? 
JULIE I'm very aural. 
TED Tell me more. 
JULIE Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch. 
TED (feigning a deep voice) I see. 
JULIE I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me. 
TED (jealous) A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo." 
JULIE You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust. 
TED Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming. 
JULIE You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever. 
At that moment, the TORCH SINGER begins crooning "PEOPLE." 
TED Do you trust me, Julie? 
JULIE Not a chance. 
TED Come on. 
JULIE Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire. 
Ted leans even closer. Looking into her eyes. Using his voice. Being as aurally seductive as he can. 
TED I want you to trust me. 
JULIE Maybe someday. 
TED Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.

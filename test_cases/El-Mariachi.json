{"train": "El Mariachi \nby Robert Rodriguez \nFADE IN: \nEXT. A JAIL IN MEXICO - DAY \nIt's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder blocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE. He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food. \nINT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY \nThe Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his PARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and walks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so CRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping peacefully in their cell on Block A. The Officer rattles the tin cup between the entrance bar. \nINT. JAIL CELLS - DAY \nThe inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit up. The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and one bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the cell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while chatting on his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a small desk and a refridgerator. He hangs up the phone and continues writing. \nINT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY \nThe Officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his partner, who is now eating, and reads a magazine. \nINT. JAIL CELLS - DAY \nAzul picks up his phone and makes another call. He talks business. In the other cell, prisoners are getting up and looking around. Azul hangs up the phone and writes. \nEXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nA gorgeous, bikini-clad BABE struts slowly into a tighly framed glamour shot. She pauses, takes a deep breath, then dives a 'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat. She swims long, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera tracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and hydrodynamic build. She slides out of the water and walks up a cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated GENTLEMAN in a white suit. His face is unrevealed. As she enters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone. He lifts up the receiver and dials. \nINT. JAIL CELLS - DAY \nAzul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one has ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then back at the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around the cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him. Finally he answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El Moco. \nMOCO (V.O.) Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this is? \nAZUL (into phone) Moco... What the hell do you want after all these years? \nEXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nAzul looks out of the jail cell suspiciously. Peering down the hall, he sees the guys with the guns. He hides behind the wall, peering out to see what happens next. \nINT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY \nThe Tall Men walk right up to the guard, and hand him a huge wad of money. The Guard tosses the money to his partner (still eating), then turns to unlock the block entrance bars. \nINT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY \nAzul puts the receiver back up to his mouth. \nAZUL (into phone) There are two men here with guns. Did you send them? \nEXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nMoco, glancing at his watch, hangs up. \nINT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY \nAzul hangs up the phone and kicks his Bodyguard awake. The Bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a corner. \nINT. TALL MEN IN HALL - DAY \nThe Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. They enter Azul's block and scope out the cells. \nThe Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the sink. He stands ready to fight. \nThe Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat cautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them before they can react. The shot one stumbles back into his buddy's arms. Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them. The Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so they turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. The Tall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying his phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty cell, closing and locking the door. \nAzul presses the #-button on his phone. Moco's phone number is automatically redialed. \nMoco answers. \nAZUL (into phone) I'm still here, Moco. And so are your little friends. But not for long. They have something they want to scream to you. Listen close, because you're going to repeat it to me when I come to visit you. \nINT. TALL MEN IN CELL - DAY \nThe cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell. Moco hears the men screaming as they burn to death. Azul is holding the phone at arm's length into the cell. \nINT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY \nINT. HOTEL COAHUILA LOBBY - DAY \nMean Dude #5 enters the lobby where an OLD CLERK is sitting at the counter reading a yellowed newspaper. There is a pit bull on the floor beside him. \nMEAN DUDE #5 Da me telefono. \nVIEJO CLERK (without looking) Take it. \nMean Dude #5 grabs the phone and dials Moco's number. He glances down at the PIT BULL lying on the floor. \nMEAN DUDE #5 Pit bull? \nVIEJO CLERK Yeah, pit bull. \nThe line is picked up and Mean Dude talks into the phone. He pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it on the counter. He begins jotting down four names. He then slowly crosses their names out. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) Dead? \nThe Viejo Clerk glances up from his paper. The Pit Bull also glances up. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) All of them? How long ago? OK, What does this guy look like? \nClerk goes back to reading his paper. Pit Bull is still paying attention, though. \nEXT. HOTEL CAOHUILA - MARIACHI - DAY \nSame low-angle shot of the outdoor sign displaying the name Hotel Coahuila. Mariachi walks into frame, and pulls out his wallet. Mariachi pulls out a few measly bucks then seems to be considering what to do next. \nINT.

No one notices him. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) ... carries a guitar case... And what was he wearing?... all black... \nThe Pit Bull turns and looks out of the window. Seeing Mariachi, he gets up and walks to it. \nEXT. HOTEL COAHUILA - MARIACHI - DAY \nMariachi is putting his last few dollars back into his wallet.

Mariachi sits with them, asks for a refresco, He gets looks again. Domino serves him and he asks to see the owner. She says he's looking at the owner. He then asks her for work as a mariachi. She says she has no money to pay him. He looks arund the classy joint and knows she's lying (it turns out to be true, she has no money). When he asks how a girl can take care of herself in a town like this she stuffs a gun barrel in his mouth. He nurses his jaw, pays and leaves, as the others laugh. \nMARIACHI CHECKS IN TO HOTEL - DAY \nMariachi enters the run-down lobby of the motel. The Viejo Clerk at the counter is reading his yellowed newspaper. Mariachi sees the Pit Bull laying by the counter. \nMARIACHI Pit bull. \nVIEJO CLERK Yeah, pit bull. \nMARIACHI I need a cheap room for a week, and I'd prefer to pay you in a few days, after I've found some work. \nVIEJO CLERK S\u00ed, later... \nMARIACHI Thank you... \nThe Old Man hands Mariachi a key for the second floor. \nMARIACHI Thank you, friend. \nAs Mariachi walks away, the Clerk notices the guitar case and black clothes and he rereads the card Mean Dude left him. \nVIEJO CLERK (different tone of voice) Uh, excuse me se\u00f1or? I forgot, I need a small deposit... \nMariachi stops in his tracks. He turns back to the Clerk slowly... thinking. \nMARIACHI (walking back slowly) You can trust me. \nVIEJO CLERK I am very sorry, se\u00f1or. But... how much can you spare? \nThe dog is watching the event. \nMARIACHI (disappointed) I've only got a few pesos... I plan on finding work in town. \nVIEJO CLERK (grabbing money) Oh, that's enough for now, sir, thank you and... enjoy your stay. \nEXT.

The men stand back, and finally look down the steps at the Viejo Clerk who is waving his arms frantically. \nVIEJO CLERK 127!!! Cuarto 127, pendejos!!! \nThey run to the room numbered 127 and cautiously stalk towards it as they reload their guns. \nINT.

MARIACHI'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nCamera dollies into the guitar case on Mariachi's bed. \nEXT. DOWN THE BLOCK - DAY \nMariachi runs back in the direction of the hotel, but as he turns the corner he has to slow down for the Mean Dudes are everywhere. Each one has his gun out and is looking around for the man in black. Mariachi walks slowly, whistling and nodding to everyone as they pass. A few look suspiciously at him but continue searching. Mariachi ducks inside the hotel. \nINT. HOTEL COAHUILA LOBBY - DAY \nMariachi enters the lobby and winks at the old Clerk who is standing over his open register in shock. His eyes widen when he sees Mariachi. He runs out of the hotel. \nVIEJO CLERK (screaming, pointing inside) PENDEJOS!!! \nINT. MARIACHI'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nMariachi rushes in, grabs his jacket and puts it on. He grabs his guitar case and squeezes it tight, his eyes shut.

HOTEL COURTYARD - DAY \nMariachi rushes out the door, he looks down and sees the Mean Dudes entering the courtyard. He ducks his head back just as they look up to see him.

FRONT BALCONY - HOTEL COAHUILA - DAY \nMariachi nods an ashamed yes. \nDomino reaches for her gun under the counter. \nThe camera is on Mariachi when she brings it out and points at him. \nMARIACHI (exhausted) Wait a minute... what's your name? \nDOMINO Domino. \nMARIACHI Wait a minute, Domino! It was self-defense. \nShe cocks the pistol. \nMARIACHI (frantic) I'm new in town. I don't know everyone!!! I have no friends here... and no enemies. \nDOMINO (lowering the gun a bit) Thieves? \nMARIACHI (nodding) No way. They were well-dressed men. I checked into the cheapest hotel in town, no money, nothing of value, except this guitar and maybe this coat, which they could have taken when I left my room, but they didn't. They were only interested in killing me. \nDOMINO (lifting the gun back up) So why do you come here? You want to get me killed? \nMARIACHI I need a place to stay until I figure this out. They've got me mixed up with someone else. \nDOMINO And you've never seen them before? Not even in another town? \nMARIACHI (long pause) Are you saying they followed me, a mariachi, here? What for? \nDOMINO Maybe they hate your music. \nMariachi stares at her expressionless. She stares back at him. \nDOMINO Maybe you were singing in another town, they hated your voice, and now they're trying to kill you. \nMARIACHI Are you serious? \nDOMINO (nodding) Yes. \nShe laughes. \nDomino looks a little upset. She slides the phone towards him a bit. \nDOMINO Aren't you gonna call your boss? \nMEAN DUDE #5 (nodding) I have to tell Moco that he got away again... So, you better give me a drink first. \nDomino smiles and pours him half a beer mug with tequila. He laughs and drinks. As he's dialing, the camera is on Domino as she cleans up a few things, every once in a while glancing upstairs. \nMEAN DUDE #5 (into phone) Moco, he got away. Shot me in the arm. Killed La Palma. Pepino, Sunday. This guy is one slick maricon. Yeah. Also, I didn't get a look at him. So, unless he's still carrying that guitar around and hasn't changed clothes, I won't even spot him, and I don't think he'll be that obvious... \nMOCO (V.O.) Don't worry. If there's one thing I know, it's that he'll always wear black and he'll always carry that guitar with him. It's his signature. Besides, that's not a guitar he's carrying. It's a guitar case full of weapons. Find him. \nMean Dude hangs up and puts his head in his hands. \nDOMINO Que paso? \nMEAN DUDE #5 I screwed up. The guy left his guitar case in the hotel room. We chased him out, but he came back for the case. \nDOMINO Maybe he loves his guitar. It's probably an antique. \nMEAN DUDE #5 It wasn't a guitar. It was a guitar case full of weapons that he uses on his victims. Adios, I'm gonna take a nap. And thanks for the drink. \nMean Dude #5 stumbles as he tries to stand. \nMEAN DUDE #5 If you see this guy, call us. \nHe is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns back pointing at it. She waves her hand at him, as if granting him permission to take it. She cleans his glass, and when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the stairs. A few seconds later she comes back into the bar, grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant to watch the bar. He sees the gun and wonders what she's up to. She storms upstairs. \nINT. DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY \nDomino opens the door abruptly and finds Mariachi taking a bath. He bolts upright, pulls a towel up from the floor and sits frozen waiting for Domino's next move. She laughs and walks to the counter. \nDOMINO (friendly) I thought I told you not to touch anything. \nMARIACHI Sorry. I needed to relax. I can... \nDOMINO (smiling) No, it's alright, Finish up. Do you want shampoo? \nMARIACHI (laying back, closed eyes) Yes, please. \nMARIACHI I told you... I am a musician. \nSlow dolly into the case, which contains a white, well-kept classical guitar. Domino is seeing it, and for a moment she almost believes he is telling the truth. \nShe rushes to it, grabs the guitar and tosses it to Mariachi. He catches it, choking after she releases the blade. She is on the other side of the tub, now. She jams the knife down between Mariachi's legs. Mariachi's eyes bug. \nDOMINO Play it. \nMARIACHI (still choking) W...w...what? \nDomino shoves the knife in deeper and Mariachi grimaces horribly. \nDOMINO Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!! \nMariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red. He pauses for a long time before plucking an odd note. She squints as if she's caught him. But he eventually starts picking out a sweet little melody. \nDOMINO (growing impatient) SING! \nMariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words. He starts over, playing a \"Rancho Grande\" sounding song with his own made up words. \nMARIACHI (in a high sweet voice) What is this place? That treats me like a murderer? They've all got their heads up their butts... Even this beautiful girl, With a knife to my balls, Should I kiss her or hit her... Or both? \nHe finishes his song, bowing and thanking his imaginary audience. Domino is smiling. She pulls the knife slowly out of the water and wipes it off on her apron. \nDOMINO You're a mariachi, all right. And a good one. \nMariachi bows a solemn thank you. \nMARIACHI I think this is the best I've ever played. You... inspired me. \nCLOSEUP of the knife. \nShe laughs. \nMARIACHI Hire me. \nDomino looks at him with a silent \"what?\". \nMARIACHI I'm good. Hire me to play in your bar. I'll work mostly from tips. But, I need steady work. \nEXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nMoco is sitting in his pool. A swimming WAITER is bringing him drinks. \nMOCO (into phone) Amigo! I'm glad I've reached you! You've not answered all day. Killing ten of my men must have been very time consuming! \nAZUL (into phone) Six. \nMOCO (into phone) What? \nAZUL (into phone) I've only killed six! You were always bad at maths, Moco. I guess that's why you never paid me half of the money. You thought it all belonged to you. \nMOCO (into phone) I knew half was yours... I got greedy, my friend. It's my nature. But you!!! You are modest! You've killed ten of my men!! I know, because I'm having them buried in my yard right now. With my dogs and cats. \nAZUL (counting on his fingers, into phone) I killed six. But don't bother counting so soon. The number will triple by tomorrow. \nMOCO (into phone) I'm sorry things turned out this way. My friend. I got greedy. I should never have tried to kill you. It would have been cheaper for me to pay you. Now I've got to find ten new men. \nAZUL (into phone) Six. \nMOCO (into phone) Ten. \nAZUL (into phone) I tell you what. You give me my money, and I won't kill any more of your men... And I won't kill you. \nMOCO (takes a sip, into phone) No, it's too late for that. We're going to have to see this through. \nAZUL (into phone) Just like the Moco I used to know. Still wearing white? \nMOCO (looking down at his clothes, into phone) What do you think? \nAZUL (into phone) I think you should change clothes. I'd hate to ruin a white suit with your stupid blood. \nAzul hangs up. He gets dressed and leaves. The little Rats are about to follow, but one Rat walks over to get one look at the girls. The girls tease him, and when he tries to advance them, they pull guns and laugh as the Rat runs away. \nINT. AMADEUS - DAY \nDomino walks by with a trash can. Mariachi is sitting on a barstool. \nMARIACHI I need to get my money back from that hotel. I'll be right back. \nASSISTANT Can I get something to drink or eat? \nAZUL One beer. \nThe Assistant grabs a mug and starts to fill it at the tap. He fills it halfway when... \nAZUL In a bottle, wey. \nASSISTANT (laughs) Sorry. \nHe grabs a bottle and hands it to Azul, then lifts the mug, toasts and drinks it straight down. \nAzul drinks his straight down, too. \nAZUL (looking around) Isn't there a girl that works here? \nASSISTANT Yeah, she owns the place. \nAZUL (heading a few bills to the Assistant) She owns it, now? Then she is Moco's girl? \nASSISTANT (looking around) So-so. She's onto this new musician. \nAzul takes out a few more bills and hands them to the Assistant, and begins to stand up. \nAZUL Thank you. \nEXT.

SNAP! \nMEAN DUDE #5 ... then we'll spray paint this street with your brains. \nHe points the gun deep into Azul's face and cocks it. Azul closes his eyes. Mean Dude #5 lifts the lid. Azul hears a faint strumming sound, followed by the sound of the Mean Dude slamming the case shut. Azul opens his eyes. The Mean Dude resnaps the latches. SNAP... SNAP... SNAP-SNAP-SNAP!!! \nMEAN DUDE #5 (walking away) Sorry.... \nThey walk away leaving Azul wondering what happened. \nINT. AMADEUS - DAY \nDomino, Mariachi, and Assistant are standing at the bar. \nDOMINO Look, as long as you don't carry the case around, they'll leave you alone. It's that guy they're after. \nMARIACHI (putting on his coat) I better put this upstairs... \nHe grabs the case and begins to take it to the stairs, but he pauses for it feels different to him. He slowly looks down at it. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nAzul watches the Mean Dudes go and when tey turn the corner he puts the case on the ground to open it. \nEXT.

AROUND THE CORNER - DAY \nMean Dudes are watching Azul unsnap his case. \nMariachi pulls out the MAC-10 and blasts the first Mean Dude he sees. He grabs the case and runs out into the street, jumping onto a truck and blasting the other Mean Dude from up there. He sees Mean Dude #5 run away. \nMariachi comes off the truck and walks through the streets in slow motion. Peolple are staring at him as if he was Azul the killer. Mariachi walks straight to the bar. A BOY is bouncing a ball on one of the sidewalks. \nINT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY \nThe camera dollies past the vacant pool table, and over to a Rat sitting in a chair, drinking a beer. The other Rat is pacing back and forth in front of the sitting Rat. Azul enters the room. Throwing his guitar case onto the pool table as a grand entrance gesture. The sitting Rat stands beside the pacing Rat. \nRAT #1 I'm sorry we left... \nRAT #2 ... We didn't know what to do... \nRAT #1 ... We figured you could defend yourself!!! \nRat #2 nods in agreement. Azul unsnaps one of the latches. SNAP! \nAZUL You thought I could defend myself... \nSNAP! SNAP! \nAZUL ... against three armed men... \nSNAP! \nAZUL ... using this? \nHe opens the case and the guitar sparkles at them.

The dealer's name is Mauricio. But he's known as Moco. \nMARIACHI And Moco is sending these men to find Azul. So, why do they chase me? \nDOMINO They have never seen Azul... only Moco knows him. My friend says the description Moco gave his men was that he wears black, and carries a guitar case. Sounds like you, no? \nMARIACHI Couldn't you tell your friend that there are two people like that in his town? One is a killer, and one is a mariachi. \nDOMINO Only special people can talk to Moco. Besides, you've killed a few of his men, now. Your best option is to keep out of sight, stop wearing black, and to hide that stupid case until this is all over. \nEXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nMean Dude #5 comes in and approaches Moco. \nMEAN DUDE #5 He got away... but I got a good look at him. \nMoco takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. \nMEAN DUDE #5 Coca, Caca, Beto were killed. \nMoco takes out a match. \nMEAN DUDE #5 He won't get away again, Moco.

See, that's why you can't ever be as big as me. \nAzul slowly looks at Moco. \nMOCO (aiming gun) Because you have too much heart. \nMoco shoots Azul in the heart. Azul had his hands to his side, and now he falls to his knees. Moco shoots him again, and Azul dies next to Domino. \nMean Dude #5 is exchanging glances with the others. No one seems to be on Moco's side. \nEXT. NEAR SALOON - DAY \nMariachi is still in Loco's truck. \nMARIACHI Stop here. \nLoco stops the truck and Mariachi gets out. Loco drives back when Mariachi motions for him to leave. Mariachi watches him go then dashes around the corner to the saloon. \nINT. AMADEUS - DAY \nMariachi runs into the bar... \nMARIACHI Domino!!! We're leaving!!! Right now!!! \nThe Assistant rushes over to Mariachi. \nASSISTANT She's gone. \nMARIACHI Where is she? \nASSISTANT Looking for you. \n", "test1_input": "BARTENDER (cleaning a glass) Why? \nMARIACHI I'm a mariachi. A good one. I play beautiful ballads, old classic ballads, on an old-fashioned guitar. \nBARTENDER So what? \nMARIACHI I could add a little class to this place. I work for fairly cheap, I live mostly off tips. But I need steady work, and I can guarantee bringing in more customers. \nBARTENDER (nodding) Tell me, why would I need one little guitar player when I've already got a full band? \nMariachi gives him a silent \"what\" look. \nThe BARTENDER motions to a YOUNG MAN sitting near the small draped table. \nThe Young Man removes the drape revealing a keyboard. Puts on his mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and rubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big show). He hits a few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as... \n... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat. \nThe Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds like an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and waltzes the familiar riffs. He adds the string and horns accents by banging on the keys. He sounds awful. \nMariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender who seems to enjoy it. \nThe Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down. \nBARTENDER (nodding with satisfaction) There you see? Either I can pay one guy to sound like a full mariachi band... \nMariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his full drink. He looks disappointed. \nBARTENDER ... or I could spend the same money only get one little guitar player... Understand? \nMARIACHI (walking away) Thank you, sir. \nBARTENDER You want to earn a living? Get a real musical instrument. \nThe Bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop Mariachis left behind and offers it to the other men on the table. They say no, pay, and leave. The Bartender offers it to the MEAN DUDES at the table. \nThey all shake their heads no. \nThe Bartender shrugs and dumps it. \n", "test1_true": "Mariachi walks out and looks up and down the street. He decides to walk south. \nAs he walks down the sidewalk, the camera pans into a CLOSEUP of another guitar case that is moving towards the Corona Club. The camera falls back a little revealing the backside of Azul, dressed also in black. Azul walks into the bar. \nINT. CORONA CLUB - DAY \nAzul enters the bar, notices to his left the table with the four mean-looking Dudes, drinking and eating chips and salsa. \nThe oldest one, with his back to Azul, takes a sip from his mixed drink, then stands and excuses himself to the restroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - OLD MEAN DUDE - DAY \nThe Old Mean Dude walks into the first stall and sits down. \nINT. CORONA CLUB - AZUL - DAY \nThe three remaining Dudes notice Azul's guitar case. So does the Bartender. They all look at each other and laugh. \nBARTENDER (laughing and rolling his eyes) What the hell is this, mariachi day? There is no work for you here! \nAzul walks the mean Dude's table. Their laughing quiets down a bit as Azul stands before them. The Bartender stops smiling. \nAZUL Bartender... one beer. \nThe Bartender nods and grabs a frosty glass. He begins to fill up at the tap. \nAZUL (without looking at him) In a bottle, wey. \nBartender stops filling the beer, stares at the half-full glass for a moment, then drinks the beer. \nAzul is staring at the three Mean Dudes. They stare back. \nThe Bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter. \nBARTENDER Ready. \nAzul doesn't pay attention to him. \n", "test1_id": 522, "test2_input": "AZUL I'm looking for an old friend of mine. His name is... Moco. Do you know where I can find him. \nMAIN MEAN DUDE You can sometimes find him here. He owns this place. \nAZUL So you know him? \nMAIN MEAN DUDE We work for him. \nAZUL That's too bad. \nAzul turns to the mean Dude sitting to his left, and places the guitar in his hands. The Mean Dude is confused. \nAZUL Hold it please. \nAzul opens the case and pulls out the MAC-10. The other two Mean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols. \nThe Bartender ducks beneath the counter. \nAzul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the other is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode, causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly everywhere. The Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. He manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes die a slow, bloody death. The barrel of the MAC-10 is smoking. Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case. Azul aims his MAC-10 in the Dude's face. Still frozen holding the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's barrel. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nThe shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as the toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll across the floor. He now watches it roll as more shots ring out. He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door slowly. He is sweating profusely. He slowly picks up the toilet paper, plotting his next move. It grows silent... He takes a deep breath and rushes out the door. \nINT. CORONA CLUB MAIN ROOM - DAY \nThe Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper in his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face. \nThe Bartender rises up from behind the counter. \nThe camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes. Their blood-bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. The camera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding the guitar case. His face is a bloody pulp. The camera stops dollying to the old Dude's mixed drink. A hand is stirring it with a straw. The camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul, standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder. \nShot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and runs back inside the bathroom. \nAzul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another weapon. He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm like a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the bathroom. \nThe Bartenders glance at each other. One pours a shot glass full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. Shots ring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself. \nWithout warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks calmly to his case. He replaces the weapon, picks up the case and leaves. \n", "test2_true": "BARTENDER (into phone) Get me Moco!!! \nThe door bursts open as Azul reenters, storming to the bar. \nThe Bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the phone. \nAzul walks right up to the Bartender. \nThe Bartender shuts his eyes. The sound of the beer bottle popping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty guzzling. The Bartender opens his eyes to Azul. \nCLOSEUP of the empty bottle slamming to the counter. \nThe Bartender glances down at the bottle. \nCLOSEUP of Azul tossing a few coins near the bottle as payment. Azul leaves. \nA few seconds pass as the Bartender is standing there. You hear Moco yelling into the receiver asking what's going on. \nEXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY \nMoco is on the porch trying to get the Bartender to answer him. \nMOCO (into phone) WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE, ANSWER ME!!! \nINT. CORONA CLUB - BARTENDER - DAY \nYou hear Moco's voice through the phone. The camera dollies into the Bartender as he screams into the receiver. \nThe camera dollies in to the corpses... \nEXT. CORONA CLUB - AZUL - DAY \n... and finally a low outdoor frontal tracking shot of Azul walking away smiling as the image fades out. \nEXT. HOTEL COAHUILA - DAY \nLow angle of Hotel Coahuila sign. MEAN DUDE #5 enters the frame as his beeper goes off. He runs into the Hotel Coahuila. \n", "test2_id": 523, "test3_input": "DOMINO Anything else? \nAZUL (nodding) My guitar case. \nDOMINO Where's Mariachi? \nAZUL Where's my case? \nDOMINO Upstairs. \nAZUL Get it. \nDomino grabs another beer for him and runs to get the case. \n(In between this time, Mariachi escapes with Loco.) \nShe returns, slamming it to the floor. \nAZUL If you want your mariachi back, come with me. \nDOMINO Why will you help me? \nAZUL Because you know where Moco's ranch is... I don't. \nDomino calls her Assistant. \nAZUL You help me, I'll help you. \nDOMINO Let's go. \nThey leave. The Assistant tends to the bar. \nROAD TO MOCO'S \nThey drive out to Moco's ranch in Azul's truck. Little do they know, they passed Loco's truck with Mariachi crouched in the passenger seat. He gets up after the truck passes. Mariachi didn't know it was Domino in Azul's truck or he could have turned around and kept her from going to Moco's ranch. \nThey arrive at the gate and het out of the truck. \nDOMINO (over the gate) Mauricio!! \n", "test3_true": "AZUL Play along... \nHe kicks at the gate. \nAZUL Open the gate or she's dead! \nThe gate opens and we see Moco standing at a three-quarter stance, flanked with his men on both sides. Azul drags Domino in and faces her at Moco with a gun to her head. \nMOCO (to Domino) I'm sorry he used you to get to me, Domino. \nAzul cocks the pistol. \nMOCO Azul, let her go and you'll get your money. \nAZUL Moco, give me my money or I ruin your clothes with her blood. \nMoco signals his men to get the money. \nDOMINO What have you done with Mariachi? \nMOCO Who? \nDOMINO The musician your men confused with Azul. \nMOCO (staring at her) So that's why you were busy that night... \nAzul is glancing between Domino and Moco. \nMOCO ... you had that little monkey climbing all over you. \nAZUL Give me my money or I kill her NOW!!! \nMOCO After all I've done for you, this is how you treat me? \nDOMINO I never asked you for anything until now. Let Mariachi go. \nAzul is anxious now. \n", "test3_id": 524}

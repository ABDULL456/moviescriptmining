YOUNG HURON 
running toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running and whooping like a dog charging from his master's front yard. Why? 
CLOSER 
the Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a British trooper who falls dead. The single Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off again ... 
CORA 
horrified, holds Alice tighter. 
MUNRO 
has seen it too. And now he sees ... 
62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT 
fixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons and other Indians ... 
TROOPERS 
of the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition? Locks are cocked. There's the answer. 
MUNRO Steady! No one fires! 
EXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES 
are watching what happens. 
HEYWARD 
scanning them. 
HEYWARD (to Sergeant Major) Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major! 
SERGEANT MAJOR Yes sir! 
Drums beat the cadence. 
TROOPERS 
step over the fallen soldier. Heads turn, they're on edge ... 
END OF COLUMN - HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK 
watching. They exchange looks. This is not good. Chingachgook cocks both Killdeer and his own musket. 
HAWKEYE'S POV: FORESTED SLOPES 
Hold. We start to make out details in the shadow. Tree trunks. We become accustomed to the dimness. Now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest. 
CLOSER 
Many Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows. They're moving along parallel to the column, stalking it. Waiting ... 
ANOTHER BRAVE 
racing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd. 
TWO SOLDIERS 
look at their sergeant. He nods. They wait until he's within ten feet of the column. Both bayonet the Indian. He's dead. 
EXTERIOR HILLSIDES - HURON & OTTAWA 
saw what happened. But, they hold their ranks. 
MOHAWKS 
among the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously. Some are cocking flintlocks. 
MUNRO 
gallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of the last attack. We hear him from the distance ordering ... 
MUNRO Do not break ranks! I want these ranks to hold ...! 
Cora's frightened. 
HAWKEYE'S 
frustrated. He saw Munro leave Cora. He knows events have a momentum and it's accelerating. 
CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS 
move next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them curiously as ... 
WOMEN 
with children nervously search the threatening trees, hoping against hope these are isolated incidents. 
HEYWARD

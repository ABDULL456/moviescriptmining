Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command chair. 
SHINZON Open a channel. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING 
Picard is still entering commands in his chair console. 
DATA We are being hailed. 
PICARD Deanna, stand by. (to Data) Open a channel. 
SHINZON (V.O.) I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc. 
PICARD I am. 
SHINZON (V.O.) Don't you think it's time to surrender?  I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why should the rest of your crew have to die? 
Picard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of this as Picard buys some time: 
PICARD I never told you about my first Academy evaluation, did I?  I received very high marks for my studies.  But I was found lacking in certain other areas. Personality traits, you might say. In particular I was thought to be extremely... (he glares up at the prow of the Scimitar) ... over-confident. 
Picard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then: 
PICARD (quickly) Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me. 
GEORDI Aye, sir. 
PICARD Deanna, on my mark. 
GEORDI Ready, sir! 
Picard leans forward in his chair: 
PICARD (on comm) All hands, brace for impact! (to Deanna) ENGAGE. 
EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE 
The Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- ! 
INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING 
Shinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up -- 
SHINZON HARD TO PORT ! 
Too late. 
EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE 
A massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar -- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship -- 
The Scimitar REELS -- 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING 
Everyone goes FLYING! 
EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE 
The two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating in space. 
The forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked. 
INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING 
Shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his bridge crew are now dead. 
SHINZON Divert all power to engines.  Full reverse! 
EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE 
Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar is ripping free, wrenching itself loose. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING 
The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube. The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack. Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs -- 
Bright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack! He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall! 
Riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy, grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a long drop below them! 
Riker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a brutal struggle --

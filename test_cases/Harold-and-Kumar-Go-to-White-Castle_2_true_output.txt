KUMAR searches for some clue of where they are. 
KUMAR Dude, I have no idea where we are. All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead. 
KUMAR Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up? 
HAROLD And get chopped to bits?     Are you crazy? Kumar pulls over to the side of the road... 
KUMAR Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know how to get us back on the highway. 
HAROLD Fuck that! It's my car! We're not picking up a hitchhiker! The back door opens and Neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car. 
NEIL Yo, man, thanks for picking me up. HAROLD and KUMAR look at NEIL and then look at each other. THEY ARE IN COMPLETE SHOCK. Harold is no longer angry. 
HAROLD (to Neil) Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil Patrick Harris? 
NEIL Yep. 
KUMAR Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was my favorite TV show growing up! You were my idol! 
NEIL (curt) Hey, that's great. Do you think we could get going? I'm bored as shit back here. 
87   EXT. DIRT ROAD                                                87 We see Harold's Infiniti drive back onto the road...

KUMAR So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set? 
NEIL Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on that show. 
KUMAR Even the chick who played the hot nurse? 
NEIL No, I didn't go all the way with her. 
HAROLD Hey, you don't know how to get back on the highway, do you? 
NEIL I don't even know where the fuck I am right now. I was at this party earlier tonight, and this dude hooked me up with some killer X. Somehow I ended up getting thrown out of a moving car, and I've been tripping balls ever since. HAROLD and KUMAR both find this to be quite strange. 
KUMAR Well, our night's been pretty crazy too. We've been driving around for hours, trying to get to White Castle, but we keep getting sidetracked. 
NEIL Dude, forget White Castle.   What we need is some pussy. 
HAROLD Huh? 
NEIL It's a fucking sausage fest in here. Let's get us some poon-tang. Then we'll go to White Castle. 
KUMAR You don't understand, Neil. We've been craving these burgers all night. 
NEIL I've been craving burgers too.   Fur burgers, that is.

DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003       65. NEIL (cont'd) Let's pick up some trim at a strip club. The Doogie line always works on strippers. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other-- weirded out. 
KUMAR Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop and get directions. KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET leading up to a gas station in the distance... 
89   EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE - 1:50 AM                  89 HAROLD and KUMAR get out of the car.   NEIL is still in the backseat. The car is still running. 
HAROLD We'll be right back, Neil. NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start walking over to the CONVENIENCE STORE. 
HAROLD What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why's he so horny? 
KUMAR I don't know. But we can't let him interfere with our quest. Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them. They have to jump out of the way. Cole parks the jeep and exits with

COLE Late night math league meeting, homos?

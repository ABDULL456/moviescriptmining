ANIMAL Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one. 
Excitedly Animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big overcoat. 
AUDREY Animal, I can't. 
ANIMAL Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance. 
He starts going through his drawers, taking out battery packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets. 
AUDREY (misgivings) I don't know. I've already made such a mess of things... 
Animal walks up to the door, ready to exit. 
ANIMAL (smiling) Audrey, I'm going after them. You can come with me or not. 
Conflicted, Audrey is not sure what to do. Animal opens the bedroom window and begins to climb out. 
AUDREY What are you doing? 
ANIMAL Lucy'd kill me if she knew. 
CUT TO: 
134  INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - SUNSET                            134 
Nick marches out of a changing room dressed in a military uniform. As he moves into the room we SEE all of Raymond's men dressed similarly. 
As they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a stick of chewing gum. Nick gets in the passenger seat of one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the wheel. 
NICK What's with the chewing gum? 
RAYMOND Makes us look more American. 
Nick looks over at the faux Americans. It's a tough sell, gum or not. 
NICK Just let me do all the talking. 
With that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out into the rainy night. 
135  EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - ENTRANCE - RAIN - SUNSET             135 
An armed blockage seals the Jersey entrance to the Lincoln tunnel. We widen to reveal Audrey and Animal by a small side entrance. Animal works the lock. 
AUDREY What are you doing? 
ANIMAL It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it. 
Just then the lock TURNS and the door opens. They enter. 
136  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - JERSEY SIDE - SUNSET       136 
A line of military vehicles approaches and slowly passes through a guarded entrance, each vehicle checked. Nick and Raymond's Humvee nears. 
ANGLE - GUARDED BLOCKADE - CONTINUOUS 
Raymond's Humvee rolls up and a GUARD walks up to the window. 
GUARD (checking clipboard) Who you boys with? 
NICK Oh, we're with the three two. 
GUARD I didn't ask you, soldier. 
NICK Sergeant O'Neal just called down for us to join in. 
Now he's suspicious. The guard approaches Raymond, checks him out. 
GUARD You got a problem talkin'? 
RAYMOND (perfect southern accent) Why no sir, I'm fine. 
The Guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule. Finally he waves him through. 
GUARD All right, keep it moving. 
RAYMOND (ala Presley) Thank you very much. 
They drive off. Nick is stunned by the act. 
RAYMOND Elvis Presley movies. (by way of explanation) He was the King! 
137  INT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - MAINTENANCE DOOR - SAME - NIGHT      137 
The door creeps open. Animal leans out to find the tunnel deserted. He and Audrey step out and into the tunnel. We FOLLOW them as they are headed for the exit of the tunnel into Manhattan. 
138  INT. RAYMOND'S HUMVEE - NIGHT                              138 
Raymond and Nick drive through Central Park. We can SEE dozens of military people and vehicles in a large meadow. 
139  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LARGE MEADOW - NIGHT                   139 
The enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the center of the field as many others are planting land mines. Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area. 
The convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond and his men keep going straight. They drive slowly right past the trap sight and out of the park.

DUNCAN I'll see you later... sometime. I still want to buy you that drink. 
He steps into the hall. Tracy closes the front door and bolts it. She turns, leans against it and sighs. 
Outside the door, Duncan's footsteps move down the hall, pause, then come back to the door. A moment passes. Then there is a faint knocking on the door. Tracy doesn't move. The knocking comes again, a little louder this time. Tracy stands and waits, scarcely breathing. After another long moment, the footsteps finally move away.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
A car pulls into the parking lot behind the station. Clifford and Garber get out and walk into the building. 
INT. POLICE STATION 
Clifford and Garber walk down a hallway. Uniformed POLICEMEN walk to and fro around them. 
CLIFFORD Jesus, I don't recognize anybody. 
GARBER Three years is a long time in a place like this. 
CLIFFORD Three and a half. 
Garber stops at the WATCH COMMANDER'S desk and picks up some paperwork. The WC looks up briefly and sees Clifford. 
WC Hiya, Cliff. Howya doin'? 
The WC looks down again. Three and a half years mean nothing to him. 
CLIFFORD (taken aback) Hi... 
He can't remember the man's name. Garber smiles at him and they continue walking. 
GARBER How long will you be here? 
CLIFFORD Depends on how lucky I get. (beat) I'll only be coming around once, maybe twice a week. 
GARBER You want to use your old desk? Someplace to sit down? 
CLIFFORD (surprised) Is it vacant?

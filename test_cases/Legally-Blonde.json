{"test1_input": "LEGALLY BLONDE \nKaren McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith \nShooting Draft July 31, 2000 \nINT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - DAY                                      1 \n\"HEAD OVER HEELS\" by the Go-Go's plays as we wind through a flock of abstract, silky, golden strands -- PULLING BACK, to discover that the strands are hair on a BLONDE GIRL's head. But not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma, the blondest, most beautiful sorority at USC. \nWe PULL BACK further to see that she's signing a handmade card. She holds it up ~ OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts and glitter surrounding and \"Good Luck Tonight!\" and \"Elle and Warner forever!.\" \nShe carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across the hall, into the room of -- \nTHREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom routine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card Girl out and into the room of -- \nA BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a Stairmaster as \"General Hospital\" plays on a tiny TV. She signs the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to the room of-- \nA BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her neck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of -- \nA BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a glass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE GIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being signed, as the drinks go the other. \nOnce the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we follow her out of the room and down the hall until she reaches the very last and biggest door -- She puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides the card under the door. \nINT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                   2 \nThe CARD slides into the pink room, hitting the feet of UNDERDOG, a tiny chihuahua ~ who picks it up in his mouth and trots it over to a pair of perfectly pedicured feet in strappy sandals. \nAn equally perfectly manicured hand with a \"Sisters Forever\" charm bracelet dangling from the wrist, scoops up Underdog. \n(CONTINUED) \nAs he rises, we RISE WITH HIM, passing toned, waxed, tanned legs in pink Prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs encased in a spaghetti-strap top -- until we finally reveal a magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet, beautiful face. This is ELLE WOODS, 21, the Goddess Queen of Delta Gamma. She talks on a pink, fuzzy phone. \nELLE \n(into the phone) I love you, too! Behind her, a \"Go USC\" banner is pinned to the pink wall. A stack of \"Cosmopolitan\"s and \"Glamour\"s teeters on the dresser. The closet overflows with trendy, designer clothes in a predominance of pink. \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing; into phone) I'll see you tonight. She hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy, kissing Underdog's head and taking the card out of his mouth. She reads it, touched. \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) \"Elle and Warner forever\". Aww... Underdog yips. \n3   INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - SAME TIME \nA Delta Gamma/Sigma Chi barbecue in full swing. Beautiful college students drink beer and mingle, trying to figure out who they're going to sleep with next. The main wall of the living room has been designated as a \"Model Wall\" of Delta Gamma girls -- ELLE smiles at us from a Hawaiian Tropic ad and a Miss June USC calendar photo. A cover of an Italian Vogue shows a blonde sexpot MARGOT; a USC cheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde SERENA in a pom-pom pose. Serena walks up, fending off an admirer. \nSERENA \nJeremy, enough! I am not going to formal with you. Jeremy slinks off as Margot arrives, agitated. \nMARGOT \nCan someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis? \n(CONTINUED) \nELLE (O.S.) \nYou guys are so sweet! \nELLE, a vision of fluffy blondeness, runs down the stairs toward Serena and Margot, holding the card. \nELLE (CONT'D) \nBut I ' m not positive it's gonna happen to n i g h t -- \n. SERENA \nHelloo...he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got \"The Rock\". \nMARGOT \nWhy else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond. \nELLE \n(excited) You think? \nSERENA \nI can't believe you're getting engaged! \nThe three girls jump up and down, squealing and hugging. \nELLE \nC'mon \u00b7-- you have to help me pick out the perfect outfit. \nAs they head toward the door, Elle spots AMY, a shy girl in a Delta Gamma Pledge sweatshirt, standing alone. \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) Amy, what's wrong? \nAMY \nI don't really -- know anyone. \nELLE \n(teasing) That's because you spend too much time in the library. Come with me. (to Serena and Margot) I'll meet you outside. As they go, Elle leads Amy over to a group of jovial Sigma Chi brothers. \n(CONTINUED) \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) Bra ndon , Jason, Grant --this is Amy. Why don't you tell her about the time you guys went golfing naked? \nElle winks at Amy and.heads off as the guys launch into their story. \nBRANDON \nIt was classic.     Jason hit with wood all day. \nGRANT \nAnd we never ran out of balls -- Amy laughs. \nINT. SUNSET PLAZA BOUTIQUE - DAY \nSerena and Margot watch as Elle stands in front of a mirror, trying on a Herve Leger white mini-dress. Sexy and ultra- tight.                                               ; \nELLE \nToo demure? \nMARGOT \n", "test1_true": "ELLE \nWell, I don't want to look like I know what's coming. . . \nSERENA \nI don't understand why you're completely disregarding your signature color. She holds up a tiny pink slipdress. \nELLE \nHe's proposing! I can't look like I would on any date. This is the date. The night I'll always remember. I want to look special. Bridal . . . but not like I suspect anything. \nACROSS THE STORE \nA SALESWOMAN looks at her cohort. \n(CONTINUED) \nSALESWOMAN \n(sot.to) There ' s nothing I love more than a dumb blonde with daddy's plastic. She grabs a dress off the Clearance Sale rack, ripping off the \"HALF PRICE\" TAG. \nON ELLE AND THE GIRLS \n. SERENA \nI can't wait to see you wearing The Rock! \nElle looks at them, suddenly concerned. \nELLE \nWh at if -- you know -- it's not the night? \nMARGOT \nWhy else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you. \nSERENA \nElle, you've heard the man pass gas in his sleep. That practically means you're pre-engaged.                                                  '\" The Saleswoman approaches with the dress, kiss-assy smile on her face. \nSALESWOMAN \nDid you see this one? We just got it in yesterday. Elle fingers the dress, then the new price tag, looking back at the saleswoman, excited. \nELLE \nIs this a low-viscosity rayon? \nSALESWOMAN \nUh, yes -- of course. \nELLE \nWith half-loop top-stitching on the hem? \nSALESWOMAN \n(smiling a lie) Absolutely. It's one of a kind. \n(CONTINUED) \nCO NT I NU E D: ( 2 )        .         \u00b7                                 4 \n^       Elle hands the dress back to her, no longer pretending to be excited. \nELLE \nIt's impossible to use a half-loop topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get this in, because I remember it from the June Vogue a year ago, so if you're trying to sell it to me at full price, you picked the wrong girl. \nThe saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed. \nMARGOT \n(to the saleswoman) Nice try... \nElle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips on her Manolo Blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check, smoothing down her golden mane. \nELLE \n(dramatically) Girls, this is it. In a few hours, I'll be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington III. \n5    EXT, DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - NIGHT \nAn attractive male finger presses the doorbell. \n6    INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT - SAME TIME \nAmy peeks through the peephole and turns. \nAMY \n(whispering) He's here! \nElle, standing nearby with Margot and Serena and several other DG's, smooths down her dress and takes a deep breath, o pening the door to find -- \nWARNER HUNTINGTON, III, 21, tall, chiseled and outrageously handsome. He takes her in, a smile spreading across his face. \nWARNER \nYou're beautiful. \nELLE \nSo are you! \n(CONTINUED) \nShe looks up at him, blushing and completely smitten.    They kiss. After a moment,-Warner extracts himself. \nWARNER \n(nervous) You ready? \nHer face is awash with devotion. \nELLE \nI am so ready. \n7   EXT. THE IVY - NIGHT \nWarner and Elle are seated at a cozy table on the patio. Elle takes a sip from her freshly poured champagne flute. Nervous and excited. \nELLE \nHere' s to ~ us. Warner is slower to sip his. \n", "test1_id": 1125, "test2_input": "ENID \nWhy you? \nGERARD \n(to Enid) Have you ever been to a spa? \nENID \nAnd subscribe to the doctrine of self- hatred imposed upon my gender by male delusions of the way women are supposed to look? (beat)                                                   . Twice. \nDonovan motions toward Elle. Then looks at Emmett with a pointed \"Get the alibi\" look. \n(CONTINUED) \nDONOVAN \nGo with her. \n96   INT. EMMETT'S VOLVO - DAY                                        96 \nEmmett drives, Elle is shotgun. \nELLE \nExplain to me why you're so anti- Brooke. \nEMMETT \nUh, for starters, she won'-t give us an al i bi -- \nELLE \nAside from that. \nEMMETT \nShe's completely untrustworthy. \nELLE \nWhy? \nEMMETT \nShe married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network... \nELLE \nA) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network. \nEMMETT \nAnd D) Brooke is obviously hiding something. \nELLE \nBut maybe it's not what you think. \nEMMETT \nBu t maybe it is--         . \nThey're quiet for a moment.     She looks at him. \nELLE \nYou're kind of being a butt-head right now. \n(CONTINUED) \nEMMETT \n(amused) How do you figure? \nELLE \nBecause people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised. They're quiet again while he thinks about this.         He looks over at her. \nEMMETT \nI can't believe you called me a butt- head. No one's called me a butt-head since ninth grade. \nELLE \nMaybe not to your face... \nShe gives him a teasing smile.        He smiles back at her, shaking his head. \n97   INT. SPA - LOBBY - DAY                                               97 \nElle and Emmett are at the desk. \nELLE \nWe have two o'clock massages. Kerrigan and Woods. \nDESK CLERK \nGo on back.                              . \nElle starts to go, then stops. \nELLE \nOh, and my friend Katherine Windham Vandermark is here somewhere and I ' m supposed to meet her. for a Pilates class. Do you have her schedule? \nDESK CLERK \n(checking) She's in the mud room until four. \nElle smiles her thanks and walks off with Emmett. \nEMMETT \nDamn. We can't see her for an hour? \n(CONTINUED) \nELLE \nNo, she can't move for an hour. She grabs his arm and pulls him down the hall. \n98   INT. SPA - MUD ROOM - DAY                                           98 \nMRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK, late 40s, brunette, East Coast hoity- t o i t y -- lies on a table like a corpse, stiff with mud, cucumbers over her eyes. Elle and Emmett poke their heads in. \nELLE \nMrs. Windham Vandermark? \n", "test2_true": "We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan -- \nMRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK \nSo, you found me. \nEmmett looks at Elle. \nEMMETT \n(sotto) She's naked. \nMRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK \nI ' m covered in very expensive Egyptian mud \u00b7\u00b7-- hardly naked. \nELLE \n(to Emmett) I'll cover her -- parts. Elle settles on three washcloths, strategically placed. \nMRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK \nSo, I hear the tart from California shot    - Heyworth. \nEMMETT \nWell, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did? \nMRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK \nI never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun-- \nELLE \n(interrupting her) She's not! \n(CONTINUED) \nEMMETT \nDid your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship? \nMRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK \nAside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas . Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house. \nEMMETT \nI ' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney. (sotto) Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it. \nMRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK \nBut I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke. \nEMMETT \nWhy do you say that? \nMRS . WINDHAM VANDERMARK \nHaven't you seen the cabana boy? \nELLE \n(uneasy) Ys. . . . e \nMRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK \nLike I said, I've never met Brooke, but I have seen her from a distance. When I ' d come over to pick up the alimony check that Heyworth forgot to mail every month, she'd be out by the pool, with Mr. Hot Pants hovering over her with some pink drink. \nEMMETT \nHovering? \nMRS . WINDHAM VANDERMARK \nI didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I ' d bet my next check that that ' s where he was about to put it . \n99   INT. EMMETT 'S VOLVO - DAY                                           99 \nEmmett drives, raving. \n(CONTINUED) \nEMMETT \nHow can you still believe she's innocent? \nELLE \nYou're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing. \nEMMETT \nAnd you know this for a fact? \n' ELLE \nDid you see the icky black color of her hair? \nEMMETT \nSo? \nELLE \nI never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I ' m starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund. He looks at her and laughs. \nEMMETT \nThe what? \nELLE \nBlondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, \"Oh, the poor widow.\" \nEMMETT \nYou're serious? She's fired up now. \nELLE \nYou should see the way I ' m treated in class! I'm a complete source of mockery. This is why the Blonde Legal Defense Fund is needed. He goes along with it, won over by her enthusiasm. \nEMMETT \nOkay, how would it work? \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test2_id": 1126, "test3_input": "E LLE \nIt would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model. \nEMMETT \n-- I can't. \nELLE \nThat is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination! \nEMMETT \nWait -- Hilary Clinton. \nELLE \nIf she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it. Emmett frowns. \nEMM E T T \n.     In that case, maybe Heyworth got --- fellated --by a brunette and Brooke caught him. \nELLE \nExactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take? \u00b7. \nEMMETT \nThat's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should. Elle digs in her purse. \nELLE \nSpeaking of that \u00b7-- I bought you some seaweed cream while we were at the spa. She hands it to him.    He keeps his hands on the wheel, not taking it. \nEMMETT \nWhat the hell is that for? \n(CONTINUED) \nELLE \nThe bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself. \nEMMETT \nI don't -- (gesturing to the cream) Do that stuff. \nELLE \nWell, you should --. I f you look good,     you            \u00b7 feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world. \nEMMETT \nProjecting joy is not my job. \nELLE \n.         (sighing) Fine. Sorry I brought it up. \nShe puts the cream back in her purse.        They ride in silence fo r a moment. Then -- \nEMMETT \nYou really think I ' m attractive? \nELLE \nFor a butt-head? Yes. \nShe smiles at him.                             . \n100   EXT. HARVARD CAMPUS - NIGHT                                          100 \nElle walks down the sidewalk to her dorm, approaching Dorky David as he tries to ask out a FRESHMAN GIRL who thinks she's a lot cuter than she actually is. She stands with her freshman friends. \n-                     DORKY DAVID \nSo -- I called your room last night. \nFRESHMAN GIRL \n(cold)                   ' I heard.                                                        . \nDORKY DAVID \nI was thinking maybe we could go out sometime. \n(CONTINUED) \nFRESHMAN GIRL \nUh, n o . . . you're a dork. turns back to her FRIENDS who all laugh at him.    Elle winces as she passes. \nDORKY DAVID \n(hopeful) I ' m in law school -- \nThe Freshman Girl turns back to him. \nFRESHMAN GIRL \nLook -- I ' m not going out with you. I can't believe you'd even ask. Girls like me don't go out with losers like you. \nHer friends snicker. Elle stops at this and sighs, acknowledging to herself that she has to help this guy.   She turns and marches back, SLAPPING Dorky David across the   face. Dorky David is stunned, as is the Freshman Girl. \nELLE \n(upset) Why didn't you call me? \nDORKY DAVID \nWhat? \nELLE \nWe spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again? \nDORKY DAVID \nI -- uh -- \nElle signals with her eyes for him to go along with it. \nDORKY DAVID (CONT'D) \n(continuing) I'm sorry? \nELLE \n", "test3_true": "DORKY DAVID \nU h -- both? \nELLE \nForget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you. \n(CONTINUED) \nShe rushes off. Dorky David and the Freshman Girl and her friends watch Elle go. After a moment, the girl turns to David. \nFRESHMAN GIRL \nSo, urn, when did you wanna go out? \nANOTHER GIRL \nI ' m free on Friday. W al k in g away, Elle hears this and smiles. \n101   EXT.

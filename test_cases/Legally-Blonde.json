But not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma, the blondest, most beautiful sorority at USC. \nWe PULL BACK further to see that she's signing a handmade card. She holds it up ~ OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts and glitter surrounding and \"Good Luck Tonight!\" and \"Elle and Warner forever!.\" \nShe carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across the hall, into the room of -- \nTHREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom routine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card Girl out and into the room of -- \nA BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a Stairmaster as \"General Hospital\" plays on a tiny TV. She signs the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to the room of-- \nA BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her neck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of -- \nA BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a glass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE GIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being signed, as the drinks go the other. \nOnce the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we follow her out of the room and down the hall until she reaches the very last and biggest door -- She puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides the card under the door. \nINT.

This is ELLE WOODS, 21, the Goddess Queen of Delta Gamma. She talks on a pink, fuzzy phone. \nELLE \n(into the phone) I love you, too! Behind her, a \"Go USC\" banner is pinned to the pink wall. A stack of \"Cosmopolitan\"s and \"Glamour\"s teeters on the dresser. The closet overflows with trendy, designer clothes in a predominance of pink. \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing; into phone) I'll see you tonight. She hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy, kissing Underdog's head and taking the card out of his mouth. She reads it, touched. \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) \"Elle and Warner forever\". Aww... Underdog yips. \n3   INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - SAME TIME \nA Delta Gamma/Sigma Chi barbecue in full swing.

A cover of an Italian Vogue shows a blonde sexpot MARGOT; a USC cheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde SERENA in a pom-pom pose.

Elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard. \nWARNER \nI ' m sorry, Elle, I just -- \nELLE \nYou're breaking up with me?! (tearing up) I thought you were proposing. \nWARNER \nProposing?!

My brother is in the top three at Yale Law. He                \u00b7 just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for crissakes.

Warner pulls up alongside her in his convertible Saab. \nWARNER \nC'mon.   Let me take you home. \nELLE \nNo. \nWARNER \nElle -- it's twenty miles back to campus. Elle stops, thinks a minute, then gets in, still crying. Catching her poofy little purse in the door. She re-opens i t, yanking the purse back in. Warner pulls out. \n9   EXT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - USC - NIGHT                                 9 \nWarner pulls up in front. It's a starry, romantic night. Everything should be perfect. It's not. Elle sits, still in shock, as tears continue to eke out. \nWARNER \nElle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do. \n(CONTINUED) \nELLE \nHow can it be the right thing if we're not together? \nWARNER . \nI have to think about my future. And what people expect from me. \nELLE \nSo you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me? (through her tears) Everybody likes me! \nWe still love you.

Phew! As the girls go, they shut the door behind them. Elle gets up and grabs a FRAMED PHOTO of Warner, then lies down on her bed, clutching it to her heart. Underdog leaps up and gives her little doggy kisses. \n12     EXT.

Next to the pictures are thirty dried Ecuardorian long- stemmed pink roses, remnants of their one year anniversary. In the center sits Elle, wearing Warner's old oversized Sigma Chi t-shirt, clutching a Gund teddybear. Depressed and looking like hell, she speaks to an unseen confidante. \nELLE \nI just love him so much! I loved him the first moment I saw him. He's beautiful and smart and someone I totally respect. And I did everything I could to make him love me, but it wasn't enough. Now what am I supposed to do? I planned my whole future around him. My life was going to be all about Warner. Now what's it going to be about? She looks up -- waiting. Staring back at her is Underdog -- who sadly has no answers for her. \n15   INT.

Serena sits in front of her regular nail technician. \nSERENA \nIt was awful. We all thought she'd be the first to walk down the aisle and now she's totally adrift. \nThe nail technician shakes her head in shared girl-power- angst -- looking over at Elle, who sits in the waiting area, shell-shocked, but showered. \nElle picks up the only magazine left on the table -- \"Town & Country\". She wrinkles her nose. An OLD LADY next to her reads \"Seventeen\". Elle looks at her, begrudging the access to teen beauty tips, and flips through \"Town & Country\" n oisily until she freezes on-- the Engagement Section. She gasps. \nELLE \nOh, my God!                    . She looks at a PHOTO of a horse-faced YOUNG WOMAN standing next to a THREE-YEARS-OLDER VERSION OF WARNER. She turns to the old lady next to her. \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) Do you know who this is? \nThe old lady looks. \nOLD LADY \nNo. \nELLE \nIt's Warner's older brother! \nOLD LADY \nWho? \nElle continues, undaunted. \n(CONTINUED) \nEL LE \nHe just got engaged to this -- this very unfortunate-looking girl.

He smiles. \nEMMETT \nYou have Stromwell. \nELLE \n(hopeful) Did she do that to you, too? \nEMMETT \nNo, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers . \nELLE \n(stricken) Neat .             \u00b7    '   ,   ' \nEMMETT \nDon't worry.

I wish I ' d never even come to Harvard. \nPaulette dries Elle's hands and begins filing. \nPAULETTE \nAfter you went to all that trouble? \nELLE                                           : \nWell, what am I supposed to do?

Move out.\" \nELLE \n(horrified) What'd you do? \nPAULETTE \nCried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.

Elle looks down. \nELLE \n(embarrassed) I ' m not pretty -- I ' m genetically blessed.

Elle notices. \nPAULETTE \n(hating herself)                               . Could I be anymore goddamn spastic? (beat) So you're sure, this Warner guy is \"the one\"? \nELLE \nDefinitely! I love him! Paulette looks at her. \nPAULETTE \nIf a girl like you can't hold on to her man -- then there sure as hell isn't any hope for the rest of us. What're you waiting for?

We PULL BACK to reveal that she's sitting on the sidelines of a touch-football game that Warner is playing with a group of other 1-L's. Warner scores easily because the other male eyes are all on Elle. He shakes his head and smiles. \n47   INT.

Only mean people use that word. You must've heard it from Sarah.                     . She looks back at Warner's table and walks off. As she does., she's nearly mowed down by a gaggle of NERDS led by DORKY DAVID, who knock the muffins out of her hands. She stands there, even more depressed. \n51   INT.

Sarah and Claire turn around.      Elle's face falls when she sees that it's them. \nSARAH \nNo. \nCLAIRE \nYou must've heard us wrong. \nSARAH \nSorry. Looks like you'll be staying home ton ig ht.

You're supposed to be showing up Sarah. \nELLE \nI couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard- ass. Elle stops the car and turns off the ignition. \nELLE (CONT'D) \nYou ready? \nPAULETTE                         \u00b7 \nNo.                                                          ' \nELLE \nYes, you are.

I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model. \nEMMETT \n-- I can't. \nELLE \nThat is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination! \nEMMETT \nWait -- Hilary Clinton. \nELLE \nIf she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it. Emmett frowns. \nEMM E T T \n.

She turns and marches back, SLAPPING Dorky David across the   face. Dorky David is stunned, as is the Freshman Girl. \nELLE \n(upset) Why didn't you call me? \nDORKY DAVID \nWhat? \nELLE \nWe spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again? \nDORKY DAVID \nI -- uh -- \nElle signals with her eyes for him to go along with it. \nDORKY DAVID (CONT'D) \n(continuing) I'm sorry? \nELLE \nSarah enters. \nSARAH \n(re the depo) You done with that yet?

You can wear one of Elle's outfits. \nSARAH \nT ha t ' s okay -- \nMARGOT \n(to Elle) Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K-Mart. \nELLE \n(torn) I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I --      promise. I really want to do a good job. Margot and Serena stare at her, realizing she means it. \nSERENA \nOkay. . . Call us if you change your mind. They start to head out. Margot hands Sa-rah the bottle of champagne. \nMARGOT \nHere. \n(CONTINUED) \nShe spots The Rock on Sarah's finger and grabs her hand. \nMARGOT (CONT'D) \nBROOKE \nWhat's going on? \nELLE \nEnrique's gay. I ' m sure of it.' \n(CONTINUED) \nBROOKE \nHe did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once -- Donovan scoffs. \nDONOVAN \nWhile I appreciate your masterful legal theory, I have a murder trial to attend to. He grabs Emmett's arm and pulls him aside as they confer on more serious matters. Emmett looks at her as if to say \"Sorry\", before he looks back at Donovan. Brooke looks at Donovan, then back at Elle, rolling her eyes. Elle sits down, pissed. Warner is next to her. \nELLE \nThanks for the backup. \nWARNER \nHow was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on? She looks at him like he's a complete idiot, as the judge takes his seat. \n110   INT.

Women in the audience openly sigh.     Elle makes a puke gesture. Enid concurs. Donovan smiles a smug smile. \nDONOVAN \nIf that's all the proof that he has, your Honor, I think I'm done here. Emmett stands. \nEMMETT \nI have a couple of questions, Your Honor? \n(CONTINUED) \nDonovan glares at him. \nEMMETT (CONT'D) \n(continuing; sotto to Donovan) Give me two minutes. \nHe approaches Enrique and starts firing questions at rapid speed. \nEMMETT (CONT'D) \n(continuing) Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date? \nENRIQUE \nYes. \nEMMETT \nWhere? \nENRIQUE \nA restaurant in Oakland.      Where no one would recognize us. \nEMMETT \nAnd how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham? \n.                 ENRIQUE \nThree months. \nEMMETT \nAnd what is your boyfriend's name? \nENRIQUE \nChuck. The audience lets out a gasp.      Elle looks up, shocked, then delighted. \nEnrique begins to sweat. \nENRIQUE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) I ' m sorry, I misunderstood.   Chuck is just a friend. \nCHUCK, scrawny and angry, stands up in the audience. \nCHUCK \nIf I ' m just your friend, why have we been doing the slippy-slap every night for the past six months? \n(CONTINUED) \nThe courtroom ERUPTS and the judge bangs the gavel. \nElle smiles victoriously from her seat.

He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun! \nELLE \n(hugging Paulette) I ' m so happy for you! \nI ' m a man who knows what I want. Elle rises, stung.       She stares at him for a beat. \nELLE \nAnd I ' m a law student who's finally realized her professor is a pathetic asshole. \nShe walks out. \nDONOVAN \n(calling out) Too bad. I thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer. \nElle keeps walking. \n117   INT. AUSTEN, JARET, PLATT ETC. - ELEVATOR - MOMENT LATER      117 \nElle is in the elevator. Flushed and upset. As the doors start to close, Sarah sticks her arm in, blocking them. \nSARAH \nYou almost had me fooled. \nELLE \nWhat? \nSARAH \nMaybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case. Sarah steps back, letting the doors shut. \n118   INT.

He follows, catching up. \nEMMETT \nWhoa -- Why? \nELLE \nLaw school was a mistake.   Getting this internship was a mistake. \nEMMETT \nWhat're you talking about? You earned it- She snorts. \nELLE \nI didn't earn anything. I got this internship because Donovan liked the way I looked. Which he made clear .tonight when he tried to feel me up. Emmett looks pissed as he processes this. \n(CONTINUED) \nEMMETT \n(mind reeling) So now you're --? \n. ELLE \nGoing back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty-hose. No more trying to be something I ' m not. \nEMMETT \nWhat if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay. \nShe stops, giving him a sad smile. \nELLE \nThanks for not treating me the way everyone else here does. Call me if you're ever in California. \nShe walks out.   Emmett watches her go, hating it. \n119   EXT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT                                       119 \nElle's Boxster, packed with suitcases and the potted palm, pulls up. \n120   INT.

Not even bothering with a manicure. \nPAULETTE \n(upset) You can't go home! \nELLE \nWhat's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law s chool don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding mys elf -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nELLE (CONT'D) \nJust like everyone else. It turns out, I am a j oke. \nShe stands up. \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) The hell with law school. I just came to say goodbye. \nIN A NEARBY CHAIR \nProfessor Elspeth Stromwell spins around, nails drying, facing Elle. \nPROFESSOR STROMWELL \nIf you let one stupid prick ruin your life, you're not the girl I thought you were. \nElle looks at her, shocked, as Professor Stromwell stands and goes. \n121   INT.

Rule 3:03 of the Supreme Judicial Court states that a law                     \u00b7 student may appear on behalf of a defendant in criminal proceedings. \nDA JOYCE RAFFERTY \n(stoked) I have no problem with this. \nDONOVAN \nI do.   I'm not allowing it. \nELLE \n(pointedly) But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my \"career\"? \nThe implication lingers in the air, as Donovan glares at her. \nJUDGE \n(reading the casebook) The ruling also states that you need a licensed attorney to supervise you. Mr. Donovan? \nDONOVAN \nThat, I won't agree to. \nEmmett steps forward. \nEMMETT \nI ' m supervising, Your Honor. \nElle smiles at him. Donovan looks from Emmett to Elle, completely derailed. \nJUDGE \nWell, then, Ms. Woods.    Proceed. \nElle walks back to the table with a grin.       Warner looks shocked. \n(CONTINUED) \nIN THE AUDIENCE \nPaulette beams, the UPS Guy in the nose brace, next to her. \nSerena and Margot, now in attendance, STAND clapping and squealing in a completely inappropriate way. \nSERENA \nGo, Elle! Donovan takes a seat in the audience.    As he passes by Brooke: \nDONOVAN \nEnjoy prison. \nThe judge looks at Brooke. \nJUDGE \nMrs. Windham, you do realize what you're doing? \nBROOKE \nAbsolutely. As Donovan sits, Margot leans over. \nMARGOT \nDon't fuck with a Delta Gamma. \nAT THE DEFENSE TABLE \nSarah leans forward to Elle, who gathers her notes. \nSARAH \nKick some butt. \nElle looks at her, surprised. \nJUDGE \nMs. Woods, call your first witness. \nELLE \nI'd like to recall Chutney Windham as a defense witness. The crowd murmurs.     Donovan rolls his eyes. \n125   INT. COURTROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER                           125 \nChutney takes her hand off of the Bible and sits. \nJUDGE \nMs. Woods, begin your questioning. \n(CONTINUED) \n9/18/2000 Revision (Pink)                                108. \nELLE \nFirst, your Honor, I ' d like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case, but there's a complete lack of mens rea, which by definition tells us that there is no crime without a vicious will. The DA rolls her eyes, as do the lawyers present. \nJUDGE                                           \u00b7 \nI am aware of the meaning of mens rea. What I am unaware of is why you're giving me a vocabulary lesson instead of questioning your witness. Flustered, Elle turns to Chutney. \nELLE \nOkay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there? \nCHUTNEY \nNot that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.           '   , \nELLE \nAnd when you came downstairs, what happened? \nCHUTNEY \nI saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood. \nELLE \nBut Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun? \nCHUTNEY \nNo, she'd stashed it by then. Brooke rolls her eyes. \nBecause they got wet. \nELLE \nThat's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate? \nChutney pales. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHUTNEY \nYes -- Elle continues. \nELLE \nAnd wouldn't someone who's had -- thirty perms ? -- throughout her lifetime, be well aware of this rule? \nChutney doesn't answer.     She just glares at Brooke. \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) And if you, in fact, were not washing your hair, as I suspect you were not, since your curls are still intact, wouldn't you have heard the gunshot? \nChutney continues to glare. \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right? \nCHUTNEY \nShe's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you? \nELLE \nYou, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father? \nBrooke looks at Chutney in horror, realizing. \nCHUTNEY \nI didn't mean to shoot him --                                \u00b7 (to Brooke) I meant to shoot you! \nPandemonium erupts.     The gavel pounds. \nBROOKE                            .'..' \nI knew it! \n(CONTINUED) \nElle looks at Emmet t., elated at what's just happened. \nELLE \n(shocked) Oh, my God! \nEMMETT \n(even more shocked) Oh, my G^d.! ! \n126   INT.

Neubert, Swinney, who was also a private sperm donor, was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms with the hours set forth by the parents. So, if we're sticking to past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn't st al ki ng -- he was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation. \nPROFESSOR DONQVAN \nBut Swinney was a one-time sperm donor, and in our case, the defendant was a habitual sperm donor, who also happens to be harassing the parents in his quest for visitation. \n(CONTINUED) \nWARNER \nBut , without this man's sperm --the child in question would not exist. \nHe grins and looks around as the class murmurs their agreement. \nPROFESSOR DONOVAN \nNow you're thinking like a lawyer. \nEMMETT enters from the back, holding a file.

Elle grows annoyed. \nPROFESSOR DONOVAN \n(bemused) Why do you ask? \nElle's hesitancy is replaced by conviction. \nELLE \nWell, unless the defendant attempted to contact every single one-night- stand to determine if a child resulted in those unions -- then he has no parental claim whatsoever over this child. Why this s p e rm ? Why now?      ' \nEmmett's mouth twitches into a smile. \n(CONTINUED) \nELLE (CONT'D) \n(continuing) For that matter, all masturbatory emissions where his sperm was clearly not seeking an egg could be termed reckless abandonment. \nWarner's mouth hangs open.

SHOOTER Yes, I have. 
They walk along, The Shooter pursing his lips thoughtfully. 
KID Well, what happened? 
SHOOTER Nothing. Nothing at all. 
KID You lost. 
SHOOTER I didn't lose. I'm too good to lose when I set my mind to it. I play poker a certain way, Kid. I've had my Lancey Hodges. Only with me it was Whistling Sam Magee to New Orleans. 
KID (respectfully) I heard about him. 
SHOOTER Well then you know it all... about 20 years ago it was, maybe more. 
KID What happened? 
SHOOTER Why, I lost it. It dried me up on the inside for a long, a very long time. 
KID Yeah? 
SHOOTER I been where I'm going, know what I mean? 
The Kid nods as they come to where an old wooden pier extends into the river. Along the river bank can be seen a small portion of the mile-long Hooverville that stretches up and down the Mississippi. 
EXT. PIER 
They walk out on the pier and eventually stop, look out at the river, watching the working boats. They have their thoughts; The Shooter smoking his cigar. 
KID You think I'm ready? 
SHOOTER (after some time, several seconds of thoughtful puffing) Kid, I don't think you're ready. 
KID (quickly) Oh. 
SHOOTER But you're not going to take my word for it, are you? Are you now? 
KID No, I ain't. I can't. 
SHOOTER I know, I know. You got to find out for yourself. 
KID I don't figure to take him right away. But if I can hang in there long enough, I can outlast him. If I can outlast him, I got a chance. You admit that, don't you, that I got a chance? 
SHOOTER I already said I didn't think you were ready. 
KID Did you think you were ready when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee? 
SHOOTER Kid, I thought I was the best stud poker player in the world. I'm telling you now, I thought I was the best. 
KID Well, I don't think I'm just a cocky square with a fair hand with cards. I got something. 
SHOOTER No, you ain't no cocky square. And you probably got something. 
KID Okay. And I ain't saying that you was either when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee. 
SHOOTER If you got the stuff, being a little cocky don't hurt you none. 
KID Well, would you say if I got any chance at all? 
SHOOTER This much of a chance. If Lancey is not right. If he's got a cold, or his stomach ulcer is acting up, or something like that. 
KID But then everybody'd see he wasn't right and it wouldn't prove nothing. Listen, we got to have it understood. If he's not right, we call it off till he is. 
SHOOTER You're set on a real showdown, aren't you? Your mind's all made up. 
They start back off the pier. 
KID I got to. You said yourself I got to. I'm overdue. 
SHOOTER Yeah, you been around a long time -- I was a lot younger than you when I went up against Whistling Sam -- But you'd be kinda young too, to be The Man. 
KID I gotta find out. 
SHOOTER (after a pause) Want me to set it up? 
KID (gratefully) I wish you would, Shooter Man. 
SHOOTER All right. 
KID Hey, what if he turns me down?

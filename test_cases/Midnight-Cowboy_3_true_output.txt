TOWNY (CONT'D) ... never mind how you're dressed. They know me. I'll say you're with the rodeo. There's always a rodeo in New York, dammit. Besides, you look very elegant... 
EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT 
Joe hardly notices O'Daniel on a far cornet, his whining scarcely audible. "Ye are the salt of the earth, Jesus said, but if the salt hath lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted?" 
TOWNY But, dammit all, I just remembered, we'll have to eat in my room because I have this phone call coming at nine-thirty... 
INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
An ancient open cage lift. 
TOWNY What I like about you, you're such a wonderful conversationalist. So won't that be nice to have dinner sent up? 
INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
A threadbare, carpeted but spacious hallway. 
TOWNY Fifty years ago this was the only hotel in Manhattan. My mother always calls me at her bedtime, so I've got to be there. 
INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
The room has little to recommend it except its size and large French window, through which -- ignored by Joe -- the Mutual tower flashes MONY. Towny waves Joe toward the couch, quickly slipping several physical culture magazines from the coffee table onto a shelf beneath. 
TOWNY A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up... 
JOE Gin's okay. 
TOWNY It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered. 
INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY 
Joe carries Ratso down the stairs, wrapped in a blanket. 
INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
The coffee table is littered with empty cartons of Chinese food, soaked through with brown sauce. Joe finds the last egg roll and eats it as Towny's voice drones on. 
TOWNY Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing? 
JOE What? 
Towny's dialogue moves out of sync. Towny's eyes seem to look into camera -- from Joe's viewpoint -- but slightly past it. The quality of the scene grows increasingly disjointed as Joe glances around the room, looking for something to steal, losing personal contact with Towny, viewing him as an object to be used for a specific purpose. 
TOWNY Enough about me. I'm through talking for the evening. Now I want to hear about conditions in the West. The romance of the West holds a tremendous power over me. Mother was actually a pioneer woman, can you believe it? When she calls, I'll introduce you and she'll be so thrilled. 
EXT. TENEMENT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
Ratso sits an a stoop while Joe hails a cab. 
INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Towny's voice is only a shrill monotone from here, Joe searches with increasing desperation for something of value. An old electric razor is too bulky for Joe's pocket, probably worthless anyhow. Towny's array of medicines merely recalls Joe's purpose. 
TOWNY'S VOICE Mama, a coincidence. Guess who was being discussed. Discussed. Not disgusted. Discussed! Do you have that thing turned up? Why aren't you wearing it! This is impossible! 
EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY 
Joe lifts Ratso from the taxi and carries him inside. 
JOE'S VOICE Listen, Towny, did I mention I got a sick kid? 
INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

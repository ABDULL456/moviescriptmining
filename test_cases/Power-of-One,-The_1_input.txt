139   INT. SCHOOL GYM                                           139 
PK is working on a speed bag. Morrie comes running in with two open letters in hand. 
MORRIE We made it!   We made it! 
He thrusts one of the letters at PK. 
MORRIE Sorry. I couldn't bear the suspense after I read mine.   I had to open it. PK looks at his letter. 
MORRIE Three months and we're out of here. 
PK You're out of here. 
MORRIE What the hell are you talking about? 
He snatches PK's letter. MORRIE (reading) 'Dear sir. It is our pleasure to inform you that you have been accepted to matriculate at Trinity College, Oxford,' etc., etc., etc. PK It says nothing about the scholarship. 
MORRIE A technicality. 
Another BOY comes over. 
BOY St. John wants to see you two in his study. 
MORRIE Good news travels fast. 
PK I'll get showered and changed. 
BOY He said to come as you are. Immediately. 
The Boy runs off, leaving PK and Morrie wondering. 
CUT TO: 
140   INT. ST. JOHN'S STUDY                                       140 
PK and Morrie enter to a somber St. John. PK Wanted to see us, sir? 
ST. JOHN Yes.   Come in.     Close the door. 
As the door closes, BRIGADIER JOHANNES BRETYN, a quiet but formidable man, comes into their line of vision. Trouble is in the air. ST. JOHN This is Brigadier Bretyn from the police department. 
Bretyn just nods his head. 
ST. JOHN He has come to deliver, in person, an order to close the Saturday school. 
PK Why? 
BRETYN Because it is illegal. 
MORRIE We're only teaching them how to read and do sums. 
BRETYN You don't have certification to do that. 
PK Prince of Wales is a certified school. 
BRETYN Yes.   But not certified for that 
sort of thing. 
PK Can he do this, sir? 
BRETYN Of course I can do it. Would I be here if I couldn't? Come now meneer headmaster. Let's end this now. I have a full day ahead of me still. 
St. John meets Bretyn's steely eyes.   He cannot hold the man's gaze. 
ST. JOHN (resigned) The Saturday school is to be disbanded until further notice. 
BRETYN Thank you, meneer headmaster. Your cooperation in this matter is very appreciated. Good day. 
Bretyn goes to exit. 
PK You know it can't go on like this forever. 
St. John tenses. 
BRETYN What can't? 
PK What you're doing. 
BRETYN I'm just doing my job. And if you'll take some advice, you should just do yours. 
Bretyn exits. 
MORRIE Is that really the end of it, sir? 
ST. JOHN For the moment I'm afraid it is. PK If we let them get away with it on our own grounds, it will never 
change.   It'll just get worse. 
ST. JOHN History disputes you.

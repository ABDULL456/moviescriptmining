ANDREW (O.S.) That's right. 
PHARMACIST Okay, and the copay on that is...Seven hundred and fifteen dollars, eighty three cents. 
Silence. 
ANDREW (O.S.) I have to come back. PHARMACIST Okay, we'll hold it for you. 
INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM - LATER 
Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave. His stereo plays David Bowie. Once his dad's car is gone, Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the mirror, and leaves the room. 
Time passes, and Andrew reappears, now dragging a crate. He opens it, and pulls out his father's fireman's uniform. We do short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks at it, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproof inner lining is exposed. 
"Ziggy Stardust" comes on Andrew's stereo. 
Andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror, his back to the camera. He reaches down, and picks something up, looking at it, then pulls it over his head. 
It's a gas mask. 
He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless figure in the mirror. Looks right. Looks left. Adjusts the mask. 
Then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptly yanked across the room. 
EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SUNSET 
It's a run-down house in Andrew's neighborhood. The streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in yellow orange haze. 
Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt. They clearly haven't noticed Andrew, who's filming from out by the street. 
He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the house. It flies up and breaks a window. Costly, Howard and the thugs immediately mobilize, swearing and posturing as they rapidly surround Andrew. 
He doesn't react. 
HOWARD You are about to get fucking stomped, you know that right? You hear me son? Come to my house, it's late, I don't see any fucking police officers or some shit, I don't know what you you think you're doing throwing shit at my house- 
COSTLY No, wait, what the fuck. What the fuck are you dressed up like that for. Are you high? 
HOWARD Lil' Andrew's straight up tripping right now, I don't even know, I'ma give your ass a wake up call- 
Howard starts towards Andrew, who raises a hand out in front of the camera. He makes the "gun sign." 
HOWARD (CONT'D) Oh you got a gat? I got a gat too bitch- 
Howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants. 
ANDREW (O.S.) (firing the finger gun) Bang. 
Howard's body abruptly FOLDS BACKWARDS with a sickly loud chorus of cracks, and then is FLUNG ASIDE. The thugs, shocked, don't have a second to react before Andrew telekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS, sending him smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car. 
Costly and the remaining thug start running, and the remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him, breaking, bending and twisting like a rag doll, before he's propelled face first into the ground, WHAM. 
Andrew launches into the air, coming down just in front of Costly, who skids to a halt. 
COSTLY -no, no- 
Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as though under the weight of a giant thumb, leaving a glistening smear of clothes, blood and skin, before he falls across the curb. 
We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but other than that, the night is silent. 
Andrew raises a hand, and all of their wallets and loose money lift away from them, flying to him. There's a beat, and then Andrew launches into the air.

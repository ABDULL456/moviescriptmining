{"test1_input": "HICCUP I know. Be right back! \nON THE PLAIN BELOW The Nadders have cornered the house-full of sheep. They close in, ready to spring upon them. Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The surprised Nadders are caught. Stoick and his men rush in. A Nadder blasts a hole through its net. Stoick leaps onto it, clamping his thick arms around its head, forcing its jaws shut. \nSTOICK Mind yourselves! The devils still have some juice in them. \nON THE PLAIN ABOVE Hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and drops the handles to the ground. He cranks several levers, unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his contraption. He drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon on a gimbal head toward the dark sky. He listens, with his eye pressed to the scope, hand poised on the trigger. He hears the NIGHT FURY approaching... and turns his aim to the defense tower. It closes in for the final strike, completely camouflaged in the night. \nHICCUP \n(TO HIMSELF) Come on. Give me something to shoot at, give me something to shoot at. KABLAM! The tower topples. The blast of fire illuminates the dragon for a split second. Hiccup pulls the trigger. KERTHUNK! The flexed arms SNAP forward, springing the weapon off the ground. The bola disappears into the sky, followed by a WHACK and a SCREECH. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 11. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) (surprised, then elated) Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did anybody see that? Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Except for you. ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a familiar HOLLER and looks up to see... HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the NIGHTMARE fast on his heels. Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off. \nSTOICK (to his men, re: the \nNADDERS) DO NOT let them escape! \nIN THE PLAZA Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a near fatal blast. The Nightmare's sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up onto buildings, setting them alight. Hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier -- the only shelter available. The Nightmare blasts it, spraying fire all around him. Hiccup peers around the smoldering post. No sign of the Nightmare. He turns back to find it leering at him, blocking his escape. It takes a deep breath. Hiccup is finished. Suddenly, Stoick LEAPS between them, tackling the Nightmare to the ground. They tumble and wrestle, resuming their earlier fight. The Nightmare tries to toast him, but only coughs up smoke. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) You're all out. He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it away. It takes to the air and disappears. Winded, Stoick turns to Hiccup. \nHICCUP (V.O.) Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know... \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 12. The burnt brazier pole collapses, sending the massive iron basket crashing. It bounces down the hill, destroying as it goes and scattering the Vikings who were holding down the netted Nadders. The freed dragons escape... with several sheep in tow. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Sorry, dad. \nEXT. VILLAGE - UPPER PLAZA - CONTINUOUS \nThe escaped Nadders fly past with sheep in their clutches. The raid is over. The dragons have clearly won. The murmuring crowd eyes Stoick, awaiting his response. \nHICCUP \n(SHEEPISH) Okay, but I hit a Night Fury. Stoick grabs Hiccup by the back scruff of his collar and hauls him away, fuming with embarrassment. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) It's not like the last few times, Dad. I mean I really actually hit it. You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot. It went down, just off Raven Point. Let's get a search party out there, before it-- \nSTOICK --STOP! Just....stop. He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring expectantly. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Every time you step outside, disaster follows. Can you not see that I have bigger problems? Winter's almost here and I have an entire village to feed! Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him. \nHICCUP Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't ya think? A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 13. \nSTOICK This isn't a joke, Hiccup! \n(EXASPERATED) Why can't you follow the simplest orders? \nHICCUP I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just... kill it, you know? It's who I am, Dad. \nSTOICK You are many things, Hiccup. But a dragon killer is not one of them. Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement. \n", "test1_true": "(TO GOBBER) Make sure he gets there. I have his mess to clean up. Stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction. Gobber leads Hiccup through the walk of shame. They pass the teen fire brigade as they snicker. \nTUFFNUT Quite the performance. \nSNOTLOUT I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That helped! \nHICCUP Thank you, thank you. I was trying, so... Hiccup avoids Astrid's glare and heads up toward a large house, standing prominently on the hill above the others. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) I really did hit one. \nGOBBER Sure, Hiccup. \nHICCUP He never listens. \nGOBBER Well, it runs in the family. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 14. \nHICCUP And when he does, it's always with this... disappointed scowl. Like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich. \n(MIMICKING STOICK) Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring. I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on the side. This here. This is a talking fish bone. \nGOBBER You're thinking about this all wrong. It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand. Beat. \nHICCUP Thank you, for summing that up. They reach the doorway. \nGOBBER Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not. Hiccup SIGHS heavily. \nHICCUP I just want to be one of you guys. Gobber eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes through the front door. And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the woods, determined. \nINT. GREAT HALL - DAY \nA noisy din of PROTESTING VOICES leads to... STOICK, glowering in the firelight. Surrounded by his men. \nSTOICK Either we finish them or they'll finish us! It's the only way we'll be rid of them! If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave. They'll find another home. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 15. He sinks his blade into a... LARGE NAUTICAL MAP, spread out on the table... the blade pierces the middle of an uncharted corner, swirling with painted sea monsters and dragons. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) \n(DECIDEDLY) One more search. Before the ice sets in. \nVIKING Those ships never come back. \nSTOICK \n(MATTER-OF-FACT) We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard. Now who's with me? Stoick throws up his fist. No one follows. The crowds shifts in restless silence. Head scratches. Eyes averted. \nVIKING \n(FEEBLE) Today's not good for me. \nVIKING (CONT'D) \n(EQUALLY FEEBLE) I've gotta do my axe returns. \nSTOICK Alright. Those who stay will look after Hiccup. Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic murmurs of prep and packing fill the room. \n", "test1_id": 579, "test2_input": "VIKING #1 Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is so relieved. \nVIKING #2 Out with the old and in with the new, right?! \nVIKING #3 No one will miss that old nuisance! \nVIKING #4 The village is throwing a party to celebrate! Stoick is stunned, overwhelmed by the insensitivity. He turns to Gobber. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 52. \nSTOICK He's... gone? \nGOBBER Yeah...most afternoons. But who can blame him? I mean the life of a celebrity is very rough. He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans. Stoick is doubly confused. \nSTOICK Hiccup? \nGOBBER \n(BEAMING) Who would've thought, eh? He has this...way with the beasts. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SKY - AFTERNOON \nToothless and Hiccup soar through a perfect blue sky. Billowing clouds rise like mountains. The ground seems miles below them. \nHICCUP Okay there bud, we're gonna take this nice and slow. Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his harness. Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and their pedal position equivalents. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Here we go. Here we go...position three, no four. He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll off into an arcing bank, gloriously lit by the late afternoon sun. Hiccup tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new harness and vest are holding. The foot controls make the tail appendage quick and responsive. He watches Toothless' every fluctuation, trying to match it with the prosthetic. Hiccup sizes up a target -- a towering arch of stone, rising from the sea. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 53. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Alright, it's go time. It's go time. They dive toward it, lining up to pass through the arch. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Come on. Come on buddy. Come on buddy! They zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Yeah! Yes, it worked! The triumph is short-lived. They smack into one of several sea stacks as Hiccup tries to keep up with the turns. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Sorry. They hurtle into another rock pillar. Toothless grumbles. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) My fault. Toothless swats him with his 'ear' plate. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. (referring to the cheat \nSHEET) Position four, no three. They pierce the clouds. For the first time, Hiccup can see the whole of the island below them. It shrinks with every passing second. He SWALLOWS hard and tightens his grip on the handles. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is amazing! The wind in my... He spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(PANICKED) \n... CHEAT SHEET! STOP!! Hiccup grabs frantically for the airborne sheet... \nHICCUP (CONT'D) No! \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 54. ... and NABS IT before it's carried out of reach. Toothless, however, obeys the command and suddenly STOPS beating his wings. As they slow to a stop, Hiccup goes weightless. The rings of his vest float off of the harness hooks. Hiccup suddenly finds himself detached, free-falling. \n", "test2_true": "HICCUP (CONT'D) (trying to calm Toothless) Alright, okay. You just gotta kinda angle yourself. No, no...come back down towards me. Come back down-- Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much surface area as he can. He angles back towards Toothless as the tumbling dragon WHACKS Hiccup with his wing. After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD of the harness and manages to lock in -- just in time to pull Toothless out of his dive... barely shy of the tree tops. They careen past the wooded cliff and directly into a treacherous slalom course of jutting sea stacks. Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to check positions. It flaps violently in the turbulence, making it impossible. With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers Toothless' tail on instinct... with perfect intuition. Together, they manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split- second turns, making it to the open water, unscathed. Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death-defying obstacle course, now safely behind them. He beams, relieved. He sits back and throws his arms up in victory. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \nYEEAHHH! Toothless concurs with a happy SQUEAL and a fireball. Hiccup's glee turn to dread as they fly directly into it. \nON HICCUP'S FACE \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Ah, come on. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 55. \nEXT. BLACK SAND BEACH - SUNSET \nHiccup and Toothless lounge on a sprawling, deserted beach, snacking of freshly caught fish. As Hiccup cooks his over a fire, Toothless suddenly regurgitates a fish head. Hiccup smirks with forced politeness. \nHICCUP Uh..no thanks. (gesturing to his fish on \nA STICK) I'm good. Several Terrible Terrors land like seagulls, hissing and nipping at each other as they approach Toothless' pile of fish. One grabs the regurgitated fish head and drags it away. Another attempts to steal it from him. They face off and last fire balls at each other to settle the fight. Hiccup and Toothless watch, amused. That is until... Toothless spots one of his fish leaving the pile. A stealthy Terrible Terror is exposed as the thief. They tug on the fish, and it snaps back into Toothless' mouth. He swallows it back tauntingly. Irate, the little dragon paws at the ground and blast Toothless. He opens his mouth, the gas hiss comes, and Toothless fires a tiny flame straight into its mouth, causing the gas to backfire into the little dragon. It coughs up smoke and staggers away, looking ill. Hiccup laughs. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Not so fireproof on the inside, are you? Hiccup throws the hapless Terror his freshly cooked fish. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Here you go. The appreciative little dragon gulps down the meal and approaches Hiccup cautiously. He curls up next to him. Hiccup is amazed. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(PENSIVE) Everything we know about you guys is wrong. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 56. Hiccup carefully pets him... sending the Terror into an immediate, blissful sleep. \nINT. BLACKSMITH STALL - HICCUP'S CLOSET - NIGHT \nHICCUP is lost in thought, his head laid of a desk full of Toothless drawings. Burdened with the weight of the world. Suddenly, STOICK appears in the doorway. Hiccup jumps and quickly covers up his desk. \nHICCUP Dad! You're back! He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the prosthetic fin, and other drawings. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Gobber's not here, so... He strikes an awkwardly casual pose, trying to cover up as much as possible. \nSTOICK I know. I came looking for you. \nHICCUP \n(CAUGHT) You did? \nSTOICK \n(STERN) You've been keeping secrets. Hiccup's legs give out. He slides, dragging the table's contents with him. \nHICCUP I...have? \nSTOICK Just how long did you think you could hide it from me? \nHICCUP \n(IN VAIN) I don't know what you're... \nSTOICK Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it. \n", "test2_id": 580, "test3_input": "HICCUP Oh? \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 57. \nSTOICK So. \n(BEAT) Let's talk about that dragon. Blood drains from Hiccup's face. \nHICCUP Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was going to tell you. I just didn't know how to-- Stoick starts laughing. Big, booming. Hiccup stares, baffled. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) You're not...upset? \nSTOICK What?! I was hoping for this! \nHICCUP Uh...you were? \nSTOICK And believe me, it only gets better! Just wait til you spill a Nadder's guts for the first time. Hiccup's elated expression sinks. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) And mount your first Gronckle head on a spear. What a feeling! Stoick laughs and smacks Hiccup on the shoulder, sending him into the wall. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) You really had me going there, son. All those years of the worst Viking Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was rough. I almost gave up on you! Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of it all. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) And all the while, you were holding out on me! Thor almighty! Stoick grabs a stool and sits. His massive frame nearly fills the tiny room. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 58. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) \n(RELIEVED) Ahhhhh. With you doing so well in the ring, we finally have something to talk about. Pregnant pause. Hiccup averts his eyes nervously. Stoick adjusts, awkwardly clearing his throat. After a long, uncomfortable silence... \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Oh, I... brought you something. He presents a horned helmet. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) To keep you safe in the ring. \nHICCUP \n(SINCERE) Wow. Thanks. Hiccup accepts it, looking it over. \nSTOICK Your mother would've wanted you to have it. \n(HEARTFELT) It's half of her breast plate. Stoick taps his own helmet and smiles. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Matching set. Keeps her close, y'know? Hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets, grimacing. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Wear it proudly. You deserve it. You've held up your end of the deal. Stoick beams with pride. Hiccup squirms. He forces a YAWN. \nHICCUP I should really get to bed. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 59. \nSTOICK HICCUP (talking over each (talking over each \nOTHER) OTHER) Yes! Good! Okay. Good talk. See you back at the house. We should do this again. I'm Great. Thanks for stopping glad I stopped by, I hope you by. And for the... the uh, like the hat. breast hat. \nSTOICK Well..uh..good night. Stoick leaves the room awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more burdened than ever. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - AFTERNOON \n", "test3_true": "ASTRID Stay out of my way! I'm winning this thing. \nHICCUP Please, by all means. She darts off, CLOSING FAST on the dragon. The crowd above cheers her on. \nVIKING IN CROWD You got it Astrid! Hiccup stands and looks around. Amidst the crowd of onlookers, Stoick watches keenly, beaming with pride. He locks eyes with Hiccup, giving him a nod of encouragement. Hiccup adjusts his new helmet and forces a half-hearted smile. Unbeknownst to Hiccup, the Gronckle spots him and makes a bee- line toward him. \nBACK TO ASTRID ... as she catches her breath behind a barrier. She scowls, focused, determined. \nASTRID This time. This time for sure. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 60. With a FIERCE BATTLE-CRY she LEAPS from cover, axe cocked to throw. \nASTRID (CONT'D) Aaaaaaaaaa... And as she clears the barriers, she sees that Hiccup has already laid the Gronckle out. \nASTRID (CONT'D) ...aaaaaaauGGGGGHHHHHHHH! No! No! Hiccup shrugs, as unhappy with the situation as she is. \nASTRID (CONT'D) \nNO! NO! SON OF HALFTROLL RAT EATING \nMUNGE BUCKET! A loud CLACK ring out. From the crowd above, Gothi, the village elder, steps forward, tapping her staff. Everyone lights up excitedly. \nSTOICK Wait! Wait! \nHICCUP So, later. Gobber snags Hiccup as he attempts to leave. \nGOBBER Not so fast. \nHICCUP I'm kinda late for-- \nASTRID \n(LIVID) What? Late for what exactly? Stoick holds out his hands to silence the jabbering crowd. \nSTOICK Okay quiet down. The elder has decided. Thrilled, Gobber stands behind Hiccup and Astrid. He points to Astrid as the crowd waits in silent anticipation. Gothi shakes her head 'no.' The crowd 'Oooohs.' Gobber then points to Hiccup. The elder nods an affirmative 'yes.' The crowd erupts in cheers. Astrid turns a seething, deadly glare on Hiccup. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 61. \nGOBBER You've done it! You've done it, Hiccup! You get to kill the dragon! \nSTOICK Ha, ha! That's my boy! Hiccup is hoisted onto the recruits' shoulders and carried out to the cheering spectators... \nHICCUP \n(MASKING PANIC) Heh, heh. Oh yeah! Yes! I can't wait. I am so... \nEXT. HIDDEN COVE - DUSK \nHICCUP ... leaving. We're leaving. Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation, forever. Toothless is nowhere in sight. Hiccup sets down his basket and opens it up, his head clouded with troubles. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Oh..man... SHINK! Hiccup looks up to the sound of... ASTRID, sitting on the rock right in front of him, sharpening her axe. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(SHOCKED) Aggh! What the-- \n(RECOMPOSING) What are you doing here? She hops off the rock and back him down, spinning her axe threateningly. Hiccup's eyes dart around nervously, searching for Toothless. \n", "test3_id": 581}

{"train": "HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON \nWritten by \nDean DeBlois & Chris Sanders \nFinal Draft February 13, 2010 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. NORTH SEA/VILLAGE - NIGHT \nWe skim above a dark, wild ocean. The camera turns toward a lone island, Berk. It is a gigantic shard of rock jutting straight out of the water. \nHICCUP (V.O.) This, is Berk. It's twelve days North of hopeless, and a few degrees South of freezing to death. It's located solidly on the meridian of misery. The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts. \nHICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D) My village. In a word, sturdy. And it's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new. The camera drifts closer, circling. \nHICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D) We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitos. We have... Sheep graze peacefully on a hillside. Suddenly one is snatched. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nA door is pulled open... as a DRAGON swoops directly toward it, BLASTING FIRE. The door is SLAMMED. The fire shoots through the slats of wood, illuminating HICCUP, a gangly teenage Viking. \nHICCUP ...dragons. \nEXT. STOICK'S HOUSE \nHe reopens the sizzling door, as leaps off of the front porch. He weaves through the erupting mayhem as Vikings pour out of the buildings, ready for a fight. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 2. More dragons swarm in, setting rooftops alight and hauling off sheep. \nHICCUP (V.O.) Most people would leave. Not us. We're Vikings. We have stubbornness issues. Vikings sound the alarm. Viking men and women pour out into the streets, axes in hand. ON HICCUP darting through alleys, staying under eaves, making his way through the battle. \nHICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D) My name's Hiccup. Great name, I know. But it's not the worst. Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls. Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that. Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the Vikings who throw them. A burly warrior gets tossed in an explosion, knocking Hiccup to the ground. \nVIKING \n(FIERCE) Arggghhhhh! (cheery, insane) Mornin'! Hiccup gets to his feet and continues to rush past gigantic men and women. \nHICCUP (V.O.) Meet the neighbors. Hoark the Haggard... \nHOARK What are you doing out!? \nHICCUP ... Burnthair the Broad... \nBURNTHAIR Get inside! \nHICCUP ... Phlegma the Fierce... \nPHLEGMA THE FIERCE Get back inside! \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 3. \nHICCUP . Ack. He passes a silent ox of a viking, picking his ear. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(PLEADING) Ah, come on. Let me out, please. I need to make my mark. \nGOBBER Oh, you've made plenty of marks. All in the wrong places. \nHICCUP Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better. I might even get a date. \nGOBBER You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe... Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope). \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 6. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) ... you can't even throw one of these. A Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber's hand, hurling it at a dive-bombing Gronkle. The bola binds its legs, sending it into a heavy crash. \nHICCUP (ready with the answer) Okay fine, but... He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) ... this will throw it for me. Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up, equipped with twin bows. They prematurely launch a bola, narrowly missing Gobber... and taking out a Viking at the counter. \nVIKING Arggh! \nGOBBER See, now this right here is what I'm talking about. \nHICCUP Mild calibration issue. \nGOBBER Hiccup. If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons, you need to stop all... Gobber gestures in Hiccup's general direction. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) ... this. \nHICCUP \n(ASTONISHED) But... you just pointed to all of me. \nGOBBER Yes! That's it! Stop being all of you. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 7. \nHICCUP \n(THREATENING) Ohhhh... \nGOBBER \n(MIMICKING) Ohhhhh, yes. \nHICCUP You, sir, are playing a dangerous game. Keeping this much, raw...Vikingness contained. \n(BEAT) There will be consequences! Gobber tosses him a sword. \nGOBBER I'll take my chances. Sword. Sharpen. Now. Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding wheel. He stews... fantasizing... \nHICCUP (V.O.) One day I'll get out there. Because killing a dragon is everything around here. \nEXT. VILLAGE - LOWER PLAINS - CONTINUOUS \nNadders land, gathering like seagulls around a seemingly vacant house. \nHICCUP (V.O.) A Nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed. The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and walls apart. Sheep pour out and SCATTER. Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles pick drying racks clean of fish and fly off like loaded pelicans. \nHICCUP I know. Be right back! \nON THE PLAIN BELOW The Nadders have cornered the house-full of sheep. They close in, ready to spring upon them. Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The surprised Nadders are caught. Stoick and his men rush in. A Nadder blasts a hole through its net. Stoick leaps onto it, clamping his thick arms around its head, forcing its jaws shut. \nSTOICK Mind yourselves! The devils still have some juice in them. \nON THE PLAIN ABOVE Hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and drops the handles to the ground. He cranks several levers, unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his contraption. He drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon on a gimbal head toward the dark sky. He listens, with his eye pressed to the scope, hand poised on the trigger. He hears the NIGHT FURY approaching... and turns his aim to the defense tower. It closes in for the final strike, completely camouflaged in the night. \nHICCUP \n(TO HIMSELF) Come on. Give me something to shoot at, give me something to shoot at. KABLAM! The tower topples. The blast of fire illuminates the dragon for a split second. Hiccup pulls the trigger. KERTHUNK! The flexed arms SNAP forward, springing the weapon off the ground. The bola disappears into the sky, followed by a WHACK and a SCREECH. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 11. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) (surprised, then elated) Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did anybody see that? Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Except for you. ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a familiar HOLLER and looks up to see... HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the NIGHTMARE fast on his heels. Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off. \nSTOICK (to his men, re: the \nNADDERS) DO NOT let them escape! \nIN THE PLAZA Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a near fatal blast. The Nightmare's sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up onto buildings, setting them alight. Hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier -- the only shelter available. The Nightmare blasts it, spraying fire all around him. Hiccup peers around the smoldering post. No sign of the Nightmare. He turns back to find it leering at him, blocking his escape. It takes a deep breath. Hiccup is finished. Suddenly, Stoick LEAPS between them, tackling the Nightmare to the ground. They tumble and wrestle, resuming their earlier fight. The Nightmare tries to toast him, but only coughs up smoke. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) You're all out. He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it away. It takes to the air and disappears. Winded, Stoick turns to Hiccup. \nHICCUP (V.O.) Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know... \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 12. The burnt brazier pole collapses, sending the massive iron basket crashing. It bounces down the hill, destroying as it goes and scattering the Vikings who were holding down the netted Nadders. The freed dragons escape... with several sheep in tow. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Sorry, dad. \nEXT. VILLAGE - UPPER PLAZA - CONTINUOUS \nThe escaped Nadders fly past with sheep in their clutches. The raid is over. The dragons have clearly won. The murmuring crowd eyes Stoick, awaiting his response. \nHICCUP \n(SHEEPISH) Okay, but I hit a Night Fury. Stoick grabs Hiccup by the back scruff of his collar and hauls him away, fuming with embarrassment. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) It's not like the last few times, Dad. I mean I really actually hit it. You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot. It went down, just off Raven Point. Let's get a search party out there, before it-- \nSTOICK --STOP! Just....stop. He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring expectantly. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Every time you step outside, disaster follows. Can you not see that I have bigger problems? Winter's almost here and I have an entire village to feed! Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him. \nHICCUP Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't ya think? A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 13. \nSTOICK This isn't a joke, Hiccup! \n(EXASPERATED) Why can't you follow the simplest orders? \nHICCUP I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just... kill it, you know? It's who I am, Dad. \nSTOICK You are many things, Hiccup. But a dragon killer is not one of them. Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement. \nSTOICK Alright. You get your wish. Dragon training. You start in the morning. \nHICCUP \n(SCRAMBLING) Oh man, I should've gone first. Uh, 'cause I was thinking, you know we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough bread-making Vikings, or small home \nREPAIR VIKINGS-- \nSTOICK --You'll need this. Stoick hands Hiccup his axe. Hiccup avoids taking it. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 21. \nHICCUP I don't want to fight dragons. \nSTOICK Come on. Yes, you do. \nHICCUP Rephrase. Dad I can't kill dragons. \nSTOICK But you will kill dragons. \nHICCUP No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't. \nSTOICK It's time Hiccup. \nHICCUP Can you not hear me? \nSTOICK This is serious son! Stoick forces the axe into Hiccup's hands. Its weight drags him down. He looks up to see Stoick under-lit with firelight. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) When you carry this axe... you carry all of us with you. Which means you walk like us. You talk like us. You think like us. No more of... \n(GESTURING NON- specifically at Hiccup) ... this. \nHICCUP You just gestured to all of me. \nSTOICK Deal? \nHICCUP This conversation is feeling very one-sided. \nSTOICK \nDEAL?! Hiccup glances at the axe in his hands. It's a no-win argument. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 22. \nHICCUP \n(RESIGNED) Deal. Satisfied, Stoick grabs his helmet and duffel bag... and heads for the door. \nSTOICK Good. Train hard. I'll be back. Probably. \nHICCUP And I'll be here. Maybe. Stoick heads out the door, leaving Hiccup holding the axe. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY \nGobber raises a massive iron gate at the entrance of a vast stone arena. \nGOBBER Welcome to dragon training! The recruits file through the gate, and out onto the arena floor. They take it in like gladiators entering the colosseum. The walls are covered in scorched silhouettes of blasted Vikings. It's a grim yet awe-inspiring place. \nASTRID A shield. \nGOBBER Shields. Go. The recruits scramble for shields, finding them scattered around the ring. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 25. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) Your most important piece of equipment is your shield. If you must make a choice between a sword or a shield, take the shield. Hiccup STRUGGLES to lift his. Gobber helps him and sends him running. Ruff and Tuff stand amidst a dozen shields. But only one has a skull painted on it. They both grab it. \nTUFFNUT Get your hands off my shield! \nRUFFNUT There are like a million shields! \nTUFFNUT Take that one, it has a flower on it. Girls like flowers. Ruffnut uses the shield to BASH Tuffnut in the face. He doesn't let go. \nRUFFNUT Ooops, now this one has blood on it. The Gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins. Blam! The shield is blasted out of both of their hands. Tuff and Ruff SPIN like tops and go down. \nGOBBER Tuffnut, Ruffnut, you're out! \nTUFFNUT \n(DAZED) What?! \nRUFFNUT \n(CONFUSED) What?! The Gronckle scoops up a pile of rocks and SWALLOWS them back. The teens gather on the far side of the ring. \nGOBBER Those shields are good for another thing. Noise. Make lots of it to throw off a dragon's aim. The kids scoop up weapons and begin hammering on their shields. The Gronckle shakes its head at the clatter. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 26. GRONCKLE'S POV - the teens targets become blurry and scrambled. It's working. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) All dragons have a limited number of shots. How many does a Gronckle have? \nSNOTLOUT Five! \nFISHLEGS No, six. \nGOBBER Correct, six. That's one for each of you! \nFISHLEGS I really don't think my parents \nWOULD-- BAM! Fishlegs has his shield blasted away. \nGOBBER Fishlegs, out. Gobber spots Hiccup hiding from the Gronckle's molten slugs. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) Hiccup, get in there! ON ASTRID bouncing on her heels, ready to dodge a blast. Snotlout appears, trying to hit on her. \nSNOTLOUT So anyway I'm moving into my parents' basement. You should come by sometime to work out. You look like you work out-- She cartwheels out of the way, allowing a shot to shoot past her and hit Snotlout's shield. He's blasted onto his back. \nGOBBER Snotlout! You're done! Astrid ROLLS to a stop beside Hiccup, who stirs awkwardly, trying to look cool. \nHICCUP \n(VOICE BREAKING) So, I guess it's just you and me huh? \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 27. \nASTRID No. Just you. Astrid ROLLS away. A split-second later a lava slug knocks Hiccup's shield clear off of his arm. Hiccup is exposed. \nGOBBER Thank you, Astrid. Gobber stands. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) You need to live and breathe this stuff. Gobber lays a giant book in the center of the table. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) The dragon manual. Everything we know about every dragon we know of. A RUMBLE of thunder shakes the hall. Rain pours down outside. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) No attacks tonight. Study up. Gobber EXITS into the storm, leaving the teens staring at the book. \nTUFFNUT (you've got to be kidding) Wait, you mean read? \nRUFFNUT While we're still alive? \nSNOTLOUT Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about? \nFISHLEGS Oh! I've read it like, seven times. There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face. And there's this other one that buries itself for like a week... The teens stare as Fishlegs goes on too long. \nTUFFNUT Yeah, that sounds great. There was a chance I was going to read that... \nRUFFNUT ...but now... Snotlout gets up to go. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 31. \nSNOTLOUT You guys read, I'll go kill stuff. The others follow, with Fishlegs in tow. \nFISHLEGS Oh and there's this other one that has these spines that look like trees... Astrid is the last to go. \nHICCUP So I guess we'll share-- \nASTRID Read it. She pushes it toward him and leaves. \nHICCUP All mine then. Wow, so okay. I'll \nSEE YOU-- Slam. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Tomorrow. \nSIGH. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GREAT HALL - LATE NIGHT \nON HICCUP'S HAND OPENING the massive book. Thunder BOOMS outside. The hall is vacant and dark, but for the few candles he's pulled together. Hiccup pours through page after page of strange and frightening dragons. \nHICCUP (V.O.) Dragon classifications. Strike class. Fear class. Mystery class. Hiccup turns the page. \nHICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D) Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools. \n(MORE) \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 32. \nHICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D) When startled, the Thunderdrum produces a concussive sound that can kill a man at close range. Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight. Hiccup's eyes drift to a lurid illustration of decapitated Vikings. Another page, another dragon. \nHICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D) Timberjack. This gigantic creature has razor sharp wings that can slice through full grown trees...extremely dangerous. Kill on sight. The illustrations seem to take on a life of their own, shifting and squirming in the candlelight. \nHICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D) Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its victim. Extremely dangerous. The storm outside rages against the shuttered windows. Hiccup is startled, but presses on. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 42. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) ... and a whole smoked eel. Toothless nabs it, chews a few times, then spits it out. He shakes his head violently, snorts and scrubs his massive tongue on the sand. Hiccup takes note. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) No, no, no! It's okay. Yeah, I don't like eel much either. Toothless focuses on the remainder. With the dragon distracted, Hiccup unwraps his prosthetic fin and opens it like a fan. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Okay. That's it. That's it, just stick with good stuff. And don't you mind me. I'll just be back...here. Minding my own business. Hiccup cautiously approaches the injured tail, but every time he gets near it, Toothless sweeps it away like a cat. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) It's okay. Hiccup drops a knee on top of the tail. Toothless' head juts up, slows its chewing to a halt. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Okay...okay.. The dragon tenses, slowly spreading his wings. Hiccup straps the prosthetic fin in place. He cinches the straps. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(PLEASED) There. Not too bad. It works. Toothless BOLTS! He snaps his massive wings and takes to the air, carrying Hiccup with him. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Woah! No! No! No! Hiccup struggles to hold on to the tail. As the ground speeds away, Toothless immediately TIPS into a uncontrolled bank and dive. Hiccup sees the folded fin rattling uselessly in opposition to its flared counterpart. Flap as he may, Toothless can't correct his trajectory. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 43. Hiccup swallows his fear and crawls toward the folded prosthetic. He reaches it and YANKS it open. The flared, fan- like appendage catches the air, stabilizing the twisting tail. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) (excited, terrified) It's working! Toothless arcs just short of the water and climbs... high into the air. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Yes! Yes, I did it. He glances back at Hiccup, busily holding the tail open while trying to hold on. They're going to crash. Whoomp! Hiccup is suddenly thrown from the tail in the intense force of a turn. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \nAAAAAGGGGHHHHH! He bounces across the water's surface and takes a dive. Without Hiccup to operate the tail, Toothless does the same, plunging in a massive cannonball. Hiccup resurfaces, roughed up, but beaming. Toothless appears seconds later. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Yeah! \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - MORNING \nGOBBER (O.S.) Today is about teamwork. Work together and you might survive. ON A DOUBLE-WIDE DOOR. Gas seeps through the cracks. It BLASTS OPEN. A cloud of smoke engulfs the ring, swirling around the paired-up teens. Astrid with Ruffnut. Snotlout with Tuffnut. Fishlegs with Hiccup. All carry buckets of water, poised to throw them. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire. The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky. One head breathes gas, the other head lights it. Your job is to know which is which. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 44. The smoke encircles them, cutting them off from each other. The teens LISTEN and WATCH for any sign of the dragon. \nFISHLEGS (muttering to himself) Razor sharp, serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion. Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims in its... \nHICCUP \n(TENSE) Will you please stop that? \nON SNOTLOUT AND TUFFNUT Moving nervously through the fog, back to back. Snotlout is singing to himself to calm his nerves. \nSNOTLOUT If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna-- (spotting an approaching shape, terrified) --There! Snotlout and Tuffnut HURL their water into the fog. \nASTRID Hey! \nRUFFNUT It's us, idiots. Astrid and Ruffnut are soaked. \nTUFFNUT Your butts are getting bigger. We thought you were a dragon. \nSNOTLOUT \n(TO ASTRID) Not that there's anything wrong with a dragon-esque figure. Astrid ELBOWS Snotlout in the face. Ruffnut DROPS Tuffnut with a PUNCH to the throat. \nHiccup adjusts the harness and uses a metal clamp to affix himself to Toothless' saddle. \nEXT. SKY/FIELD - DAWN \nHiccup and Toothless zip through the air -- his rudimentary harness and tail controls are working, barely. They crash- land in an open field. Hiccup recovers to find Toothless still rolling around in the tall grass. Hiccup discovers that it's a patch of \u00e2\u0080\u0098dragon- nip.' Toothless writhes on his back, tongue wagging, in complete bliss. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - MORNING \nHiccup grabs the head as instructed, then discreetly pulls a fistful of \u00e2\u0080\u0098dragon-nip' and presses it up to the Gronkle's nose. It immediately stops struggling and goes weak in the knees. Hiccup drops the handful of dragon-nip to the ground. The Gronkle goes down with it, whimpering and blissful. From Gobber and the recruits' point of view, Hiccup is controlling the Gronkle with no more than a limp arm. \nEXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON \nThe recruits walk home together, surrounding Hiccup and \nBOMBARDING HIM WITH QUESTIONS. \nFISHLEGS Hey Hiccup, I've never seen a Gronkle to that before. \nTUFFNUT How'd you do that? \nRUFFNUT It was really cool. He squirms and invents an excuse. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 48. \nHICCUP I left my axe back in the ring. He turns and hurries back. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) You guys go on ahead and I'll catch up with you. Astrid watches, suspicious. \nEXT. COVE - LATER \nHiccup rubs Toothless behind the ear, causing him to relax and fall over. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - LATER \nAn angry Deadly Nadder approaches Hiccup. Just as Astrid moves in to strike, Hiccup performs his special rubbing technique, which sends the Nadder down. Astrid and the other kids look on from the sideline in amazement. \nINT. MEADE HALL - CONTINUOUS \nHiccup sits down at a table to eat. The other recruits notice him and move over to his table to talk to him -- leaving Astrid alone. \nFISHLEGS Hey Hiccup! \nSNOTLOUT What was that? Some kind of trick? What did you do? \nTUFFNUT Hiccup, you're totally going to come in first, there's no question. \nEXT. COVE - LATER \nHiccup is using a mirror-like object to create a patch of light on the ground. Toothless claws and chases the light patch like a cat chasing a laser pointer. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY \nA beam lifts from the door of another dragon pen. \nGOBBER Meet the Terrible Terror. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 49. A tiny, pint-sized dragon steps out and moves toward the recruits. \nVIKING #1 Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is so relieved. \nVIKING #2 Out with the old and in with the new, right?! \nVIKING #3 No one will miss that old nuisance! \nVIKING #4 The village is throwing a party to celebrate! Stoick is stunned, overwhelmed by the insensitivity. He turns to Gobber. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 52. \nSTOICK He's... gone? \nGOBBER Yeah...most afternoons. But who can blame him? I mean the life of a celebrity is very rough. He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans. Stoick is doubly confused. \nSTOICK Hiccup? \nGOBBER \n(BEAMING) Who would've thought, eh? He has this...way with the beasts. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SKY - AFTERNOON \nToothless and Hiccup soar through a perfect blue sky. Billowing clouds rise like mountains. The ground seems miles below them. \nHICCUP Okay there bud, we're gonna take this nice and slow. Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his harness. Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and their pedal position equivalents. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Here we go. Here we go...position three, no four. He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll off into an arcing bank, gloriously lit by the late afternoon sun. Hiccup tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new harness and vest are holding. The foot controls make the tail appendage quick and responsive. He watches Toothless' every fluctuation, trying to match it with the prosthetic. Hiccup sizes up a target -- a towering arch of stone, rising from the sea. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 53. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Alright, it's go time. It's go time. They dive toward it, lining up to pass through the arch. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Come on. Come on buddy. Come on buddy! They zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Yeah! Yes, it worked! The triumph is short-lived. They smack into one of several sea stacks as Hiccup tries to keep up with the turns. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Sorry. They hurtle into another rock pillar. Toothless grumbles. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) My fault. Toothless swats him with his 'ear' plate. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. (referring to the cheat \nSHEET) Position four, no three. They pierce the clouds. For the first time, Hiccup can see the whole of the island below them. It shrinks with every passing second. He SWALLOWS hard and tightens his grip on the handles. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is amazing! The wind in my... He spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(PANICKED) \n... CHEAT SHEET! STOP!! Hiccup grabs frantically for the airborne sheet... \nHICCUP (CONT'D) No! \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 54. ... and NABS IT before it's carried out of reach. Toothless, however, obeys the command and suddenly STOPS beating his wings. As they slow to a stop, Hiccup goes weightless. The rings of his vest float off of the harness hooks. Hiccup suddenly finds himself detached, free-falling. \nHICCUP Oh? \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 57. \nSTOICK So. \n(BEAT) Let's talk about that dragon. Blood drains from Hiccup's face. \nHICCUP Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was going to tell you. I just didn't know how to-- Stoick starts laughing. Big, booming. Hiccup stares, baffled. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) You're not...upset? \nSTOICK What?! I was hoping for this! \nHICCUP Uh...you were? \nSTOICK And believe me, it only gets better! Just wait til you spill a Nadder's guts for the first time. Hiccup's elated expression sinks. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) And mount your first Gronckle head on a spear. What a feeling! Stoick laughs and smacks Hiccup on the shoulder, sending him into the wall. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) You really had me going there, son. All those years of the worst Viking Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was rough. I almost gave up on you! Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of it all. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) And all the while, you were holding out on me! Thor almighty! Stoick grabs a stool and sits. His massive frame nearly fills the tiny room. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 58. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) \n(RELIEVED) Ahhhhh. With you doing so well in the ring, we finally have something to talk about. Pregnant pause. Hiccup averts his eyes nervously. Stoick adjusts, awkwardly clearing his throat. After a long, uncomfortable silence... \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Oh, I... brought you something. He presents a horned helmet. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) To keep you safe in the ring. \nHICCUP \n(SINCERE) Wow. Thanks. Hiccup accepts it, looking it over. \nSTOICK Your mother would've wanted you to have it. \n(HEARTFELT) It's half of her breast plate. Stoick taps his own helmet and smiles. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Matching set. Keeps her close, y'know? Hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets, grimacing. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Wear it proudly. You deserve it. You've held up your end of the deal. Stoick beams with pride. Hiccup squirms. He forces a YAWN. \nHICCUP I should really get to bed. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 59. \nSTOICK HICCUP (talking over each (talking over each \nOTHER) OTHER) Yes! Good! Okay. Good talk. See you back at the house. We should do this again. I'm Great. Thanks for stopping glad I stopped by, I hope you by. And for the... the uh, like the hat. breast hat. \nSTOICK Well..uh..good night. Stoick leaves the room awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more burdened than ever. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - AFTERNOON \nASTRID I want to know what's going on. No one just gets as good as you do. Especially you. Start talking! Are you training with someone? \nHICCUP Uh...training? She grabs him by his odd-looking harness. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 62. \nASTRID It better not involve... this. \nHICCUP I know this looks really bad, but you see...this is, uh... They hear a RUSTLE coming from the other side of the cove. Astrid DROPS Hiccup to the ground and sets off to investigate. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(PANICKED) You're right! You're right. I'm through with the lies. I've been making... outfits. So you got me. It's time everyone knew. Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go. He puts her hand back on his harness, getting her to 'drag him back.' Astrid BENDS Hiccups hand backwards, driving him down. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) AAAAUUGGGHHH! Why would you do that?! \nASTRID That's for the lies. Astrid pounces the hilt of her axe off of Hiccup's laid-out body. \nASTRID (CONT'D) And THAT'S for everything else. Hiccup's YELP is answered with A GROWL, coming from the other side of the cove. Astrid looks up to see... A NIGHT FURY. Toothless pounces toward them, snarling. \nHICCUP \n(FEEBLE) Oh man. She dives onto Hiccup. \nASTRID Get down! Run! Run! Astrid pulls her axe, ready to take on Toothless. \nHICCUP No! \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 63. Hiccup knocks Astrid's cocked axe to the ground, out of reach, then stops Toothless short of crushing her. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) No. It's okay! It's okay... Toothless pulls up short and lands hard, SPRAYING Astrid with sand. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(CALMING) She's a friend. Toothless snorts in disagreement. Astrid is frozen. Toothless looks from her to Hiccup and back to her, confused. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(TO ASTRID) You just scared him. \nASTRID I scared him!? Hiccup makes a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe quiet\u00e2\u0080\u009d motion. \nASTRID (CONT'D) \n(INTENSE WHISPER) Who is him? \nHICCUP. Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid. Astrid backs away, eyeing Hiccup and Toothless together with pure disgust. She turns and RUNS for the village. \nHICCUP We're dead. Satisfied with Astrid's departure, Toothless turns away. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(TO TOOTHLESS) Where do you think you're going? \nEXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER \nASTRID races through the trees. A large shadow overtakes her. She is suddenly SNATCHED into the air. Astrid SCREAMS. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 67. Other dragons, previously invisible in the thick clouds, appear all around them. HUNDREDS of them, all carrying fish and game in their talons. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERED) It looks like they're hauling in their kill. The Zippleback eyes them ravenously. \nASTRID What does that make us? The dragons BANK and dive in formation, plummeting through the thickening fog and weaving between towering, craggy sea stacks. They emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera, glowing with rivulets of lava. The flock of dragons fall into rank, funneling through a crack, and zipping through a winding tunnel. It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered with pocky shelves. Dragons of all breeds lay about, nested in hordes. The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into a central pit, glowing red and shrouded in mist. Hiccup is amazed. \nHICCUP What my dad wouldn't give to find this. Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small shadowy shelf to keep a low-profile. Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in the busy hive of sorts. They watch as the food continues to be dropped into the pit. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) It's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole. \nASTRID They're not eating any of it. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 68. Last to arrive is a dim-witted Gronckle. It hovers over the pit and regurgitates his paltry contribution -- a pathetic little fish. As it falls into the steamy pit, a terrible ROAR rings out. The Gronckle tries to flee, but before it can, a gargantuan dragon head juts from the steamy pit and SNAPS it out of the air. Swallowing it back whole. Hiccup and Astrid recoil, terrified. \nASTRID (CONT'D) What is that? The monstrous beast SNIFFS the air, seemingly aware of them. It nears the ledge where Toothless is hiding... and ROARS. Several dragons take flight in fear. \nHICCUP Alright buddy, we gotta get out of here. Now! Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster's snapping jaws. The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback out of the air instead. Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of dragons flee the caldera in fear. \nEXT. HIDDEN COVE - NIGHT - LATER \nToothless glides into the cove and touches down on the moonlit beach. \nASTRID (her mind reeling, talking Hiccup's ear off) No, no, it totally makes sense. It's like a giant beehive. They're the workers... and that's their queen. It controls them. She leaps off of Toothless and runs toward the village. \nASTRID (CONT'D) Let's find your dad. \nHICCUP No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill Toothless. \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 69. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Astrid, we have to think this through carefully. Astrid eyes him, incredulous. \nASTRID Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest...the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here. And you want to keep it a secret? To protect your pet dragon? Are you serious? Hiccup stands firm, resolute. \nHICCUP Yes. Astrid's taken aback. \nASTRID Okay. \n(BEAT) Then what do we do? \nHICCUP Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out. \nASTRID Okay. Astrid PUNCHES Hiccup in the arm. \nASTRID (CONT'D) That's for kidnapping me. Hiccup looks to Toothless for support. Toothless SNORTS, dismissive. Astrid grabs him. He braces for another hit. She KISSES Hiccup on the cheek. \nASTRID (CONT'D) That's for, everything else. In the awkward wake of the moment, Astrid hurries off... leaving Hiccup RUBBING his cheek, stunned. Toothless hobbles up, eyeing him. \nHICCUP What are you looking at? \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 70. \nSTOICK Stop the fight. \nHICCUP No. I need you all to see this. The crowd gets restless. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) They're not what we think they are. We don't have to kill them. \nSTOICK \nI SAID STOP THE FIGHT! \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 73. Stoick whacks his hammer against the iron enclosure, rattling the arena with a terrible reverberating clatter. Spooked, the Nightmare snaps at Hiccup's outstretched hand. Hiccup YELPS and springs backward. The spell is broken. The Nightmare reacts to Hiccup's sudden movements and blasts another stream of fire. Hiccup SCREAMS and barely dives out of reach. \nEXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS \nON TOOTHLESS His ear plates shoot up. Panic flares in his eyes. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS \nHiccup scrambles around the ring. The Nightmare pursues, snapping and springing from ground to wall. Stoick pushes through the crowd, rushing to the doorway. \nSTOICK Out of my way! \nASTRID Hiccup! Astrid wedges her axe under the arena gate and squeezes through. \nEXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS \nToothless bounds to the cove walls, clawing them in desperation. It seems he's as trapped as before, but with an incredible BURST of effort he HOOKS a claw over the upper lip of the stone wall. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS \nA narrow stream of fire narrowly avoids Hiccup as he continues to dash around the ring, evading the Monstrous Nightmare. Desperate, he goes to the weapon rack in an attempt to arm himself, but the Nightmare quickly destroys the rack and closes in on him. \nEXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS \nToothless tears through the woods, bounding like panther and taking to the air in short bursts. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 74. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS \nStoick wrenches the grated door to the arena and jumps through. The Monstrous Nightmare is only a few feet behind Hiccup. Astrid is now in the ring. \nASTRID Hiccup! She picks up a hammer and hurls it at the Monstrous Nightmare, hitting it in the head. It turns its attention to Astrid, and begins chasing her. Stoick raises the arena gate, waving her toward it. \nSTOICK This way! Astrid makes it through, but the Nightmare BLASTS the doorway, cutting Hiccup off. It pounces on him and prepares to finish him off. Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the din. \nGOBBER Night Fury! Get down! Toothless bounds over the crowd and BLASTS a hole through the chain enclosure. He flies through it and disappears in the boiling smoke. The Vikings rush to railings... in time to see a flurry of wings cutting through the dissipating smoke. Toothless and the Nightmare tumble into the clear, locked in a toothy, vicious fight. Toothless kicks the Nightmare off and plants himself between Hiccup and it. The Nightmare snarls, circling them. Toothless lunges and ROARS... causing the Nightmare to relent and back away. To everyone's shock and horror, Hiccup gets to his feet and grabs Toothless protectively. \nHICCUP \n(PANICKED) Alright, Toothless, go. Get out of here! The crowd is gob-smacked, growing livid. \nVIKINGS Night Fury! \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 75. Hiccup tries to shoo Toothless away in vain. Vikings begin pouring clambering through the enclosure and dropping into the ring. \nHICCUP Go! GO! \nSTOICK How did you find it?! \nHICCUP No... I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island. Stoick GLARES. A moment passes, then an idea takes form on his face. His eyes flare. Hiccup watches, realizing. Stoick stomps toward the doorway. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Oh no. No, Dad. No. Hiccup chases after him, panicked. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 78. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Dad. It's not what you think. You don't know what you're up against. It's like nothing you've ever seen. He grabs Stoick by the arm, tugging with all his might. He has no effect whatsoever. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Dad. Please. I promise you that you can't win this one. Nothing. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) No. Dad. No. For once in your life, \nWOULD YOU PLEASE JUST LISTEN TO \nME?! He throws Hiccup off of him, SWATTING him to the floor. Icy stillness. Hiccup stares back, stunned. \nSTOICK You've thrown your lot in with them. You're not a Viking. \n(BEAT) You're not my son. Stoick pushes through the door, leaving Hiccup alone, devastated. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) \n(CALLING OUT) Ready the ships! \nEXT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS \nStoick staggers on the steps, breaking inside. \nEXT. DOCKS/OPEN SEA - DAY \nBroken-down catapults and trebuchets are bundled up and lowered from the cliffs. Below on the docks, Vikings load the heavy artillery into the hulls of awaiting ships. Children and the elderly gather to on the walkways to wave apprehensive farewells to the departing warriors. Lastly, Toothless is loaded aboard Stoick's ship, chained down to a palette, muzzled, and restrained with a weighty neck ring. He looks exhausted, miserable. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 79. Stoick crosses to the bow as the ship pushes off and joins the amassed armada of ships adrift in the harbor. Stoick's brow is furrowed, all warmth drained away. He turns west and glares at the horizon with cold determination. \nSTOICK Set sail! We head for Helheim's Gate. He then notices HICCUP watching from his familiar cliff-side perch beyond the village. Their eyes meet, full of hurt and regret. Hiccup slowly shakes his head in warning. Stoick breaks the stare and turns to Toothless, fuming. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Lead us home, Devil. \nON HICCUP Watching. He's powerless to stop what is happening, but won't leave. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CLIFFS - LATER \nON HICCUP Still standing there. The ships have cleared the horizon. CRANE UP to reveal Astrid is standing behind him. She approaches cautiously and stands beside him in silence. \nASTRID It's a mess. Hiccup doesn't respond. \nASTRID (CONT'D) You must feel horrible. You've lost everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend. \nHICCUP Thank you for summing that up. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods. It would have been better for everyone. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 80. \nVIKING #2 One length to your stern. \nVIKING #3 On your starboard flank. \nVIKING #4 Three widths to port. \nVIKING #5 Ahead, at your bow. \nVIKING #6 Haven't a clue. ON STOICK straining into the fog as the calls continue. Massive, jagged sea stacks begin to emerge, threatening to rip the ships to shreds. Gobber approaches him, speaking under his breath. \nGOBBER Listen... Stoick... I was overhearing some of the men just now and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here -- not me of course, I know you're always the man with the plan -- but some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all, what it might be? \nSTOICK Find the nest and take it. \nGOBBER Ah. Of course. Send them running. The old Viking fall-back. Nice and simple. \nSTOICK Shhh. Stoick notices that Toothless' ear plates are at the alert, quietly reacting to inaudible sounds. Stoick crosses to the stern of the ship and grabs the tiller, moving the helmsman out of the way. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Step aside. Stoick pulls the ship into a turn, covertly following Toothless' head movements. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 83. The ship barely misses a jagged outcrop that suddenly appears out of the soupy fog. \nVIKING Bear to port. The order is called out from ship to ship. CRUNCH! The bow barely makes it past another sea stack. Stoick continues to follow Toothless' cues, undeterred. \nEXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY \nHiccup raises the bolt on the Monstrous Nightmare's pen. \nFISHLEGS (O.S.) If you're planning on getting eaten, I'd definitely go with the Gronckle. Hiccup turns to see his fellow recruits, watching him with folded arms. Tuffnut steps forward with a scowl. \nTUFFNUT You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon. \n(BEAT) It's me. \nHICCUP Uh... \nSNOTLOUT I love this plan. \nHICCUP I didn't... \nRUFFNUT You're crazy. \n(SULTRY) I like that. \nASTRID So? What is the plan? Hiccup smiles, glowing in the support of his friends. \nEXT. FOGGY SEA - DAY \nThe ships follow in line through the gauntlet of rocks as orders are whispered from ship to ship. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 84. A dragon head looms out of the fog. The men recoil... only to discover that it's a wrecked ship, impaled high on a gnarled sea stack. \nGOBBER Ah. I was wondering where that went. A clicking buzz becomes audible, growing louder. It fills the sky, converging in one general direction. Stoick sniffs the air. \nSTOICK Stay low and ready your weapons. Stoick's ship suddenly JERKS to a halt as the keel burrows into shallow black sand. Stoick hops overboard, landing on a sprawling beach. The BUZZING suddenly STOPS. Above him, a craggy volcano towers into the gloom. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) We're here. Behind him, several dragon-headed bows pierce the fog. \nSTOICK \n(GUILT-RIDDEN) I was a fool. The monster raises its head to the sky and BELLOWS. The sound SHAKES the beach, knocking Vikings off their feet. This island is his. Stoick stops a Viking General. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 88. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Lead the men to the far side of the island. \nSPITELOUT Right. (turns to the others) Everybody to the far side of the island! The Vikings scatter into the rocks like ants. Satisfied with the ships destruction, The Red Death turns its attention back to the Vikings. They seem to have vanished. It SNIFFS the air, searching for their scent. Gobber drops in beside Stoick, like two soldiers in a trench. Fire blasts over head, causing them to duck. \nSTOICK Gobber, go with the men. \nGOBBER I think I'll stay, just in case you're thinking of doing something crazy. Stoick grabs him. \nSTOICK \n(EMPHATIC) I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing someone to hunt. Gobber removes Stoick's hand. Clenches his forearm, determined. \nGOBBER Then I can double that time. Stoick grins. Friends to the bitter end. They BREAK COVER and dash into the open, SPLITTING UP. Stoick rips a sharpened post from the ground and hurls it into the monster's face. \nSTOICK \nHERE! \nGOBBER \nNO, HERE! It spots both of them. He fuels up to fire, glancing back and forth between the two men. He focuses on Stoick. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) Come on! Fight me! \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 89. \nSTOICK No, me! The Red Death remains focused on Stoick - this is it. It rears back and inhales. Gas begins to amass, when... KABLAM! A BLAST explodes against the back of The Red Death's head. It turns distracted, as... ... a Nadder punches through the flames, banking across the sky. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, a Zippleback, and a Gronckle. They roll in unison, revealing the recruits riding on their backs. Hiccup leads, with Astrid clinging to his waist. GOBBER AND STOICK, watch slack-jawed, in awe. \nHICCUP Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move Fishlegs! The monster shakes off the blast and snaps in their wake. Hiccup directs his squadron out of harm's way. They climb out of reach and circle each other. \nTUFFNUT Look at us, we're on a dragon! We're on dragons, all of us! \nHICCUP Up, let's move it! The dragons climb past the Red Death. \nON THE GROUND Gobber hobbles over to Stoick. \nGOBBER Every bit the boar-headed, stubborn Viking you ever were. Stoick is speechless. \nIN THE AIR The group circles over the dragon's head. \nHICCUP Fishlegs, break it down. \nFISHLEGS Okay. Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing. \n(MORE) \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 90. \nFISHLEGS (CONT'D) Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large nostrils. Relies on hearing and smell. \nHICCUP Okay. Lout, Legs, hang in its blind spot. Make some noise, keep it confused. Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit. Make it mad. \nSNOTLOUT Whoa! \nON THE GROUND The monster's tail sweeps across the burning ships, snapping masts like twigs. We follow one down as it crashes onto a deck, revealing... \nHICCUP Working at the chains. He can't budge them. Fire licks at his clothes. He looks up to see... \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 93. THE RED DEATH blasting at the teens, enraged. The monster's giant foot crashes through frame, smashing the bow under its impressive weight. Hiccup and Toothless are thrown into the water in a maelstrom of burning planks and rigging. \nUNDERWATER Hiccup swims toward Toothless. They're both caught in a mess of rigging, being dragged down. The heavy palette settles into the rocky bottom like an anchor. Toothless has stopped struggling. Hiccup takes one more hopeless tug at the chains - he's almost out of air. Suddenly, a meaty hand grabs Hiccup. STOICK explodes to the surface, pulling Hiccup to the shoreline through flaming debris. He lays him down, under the shelter of an overhanging rock. \nHICCUP \n(OVERWHELMED) Dad... Stoick dives back into the water between flaming flotsam. \nUNDERWATER ON TOOTHLESS, drowning. Stoick appears in front of him. Toothless freezes. Stoick tears the chains off of the yoke and lets it float free. Momentary stillness. They eye each other, through the churned up bubbles. Toothless lunges out of the bars -- grabbing Stoick. BOOM! In an explosion of sea water, Toothless lands on the shore, setting Stoick down and releasing him. Hiccup is awed. The ground rumbles underfoot. The monster screeches. Its massive claws stomp around in the smoke. Stoick gives way as Toothless mounts the rock and raises his wings. He turns to Hiccup and SNORTS - \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let's go.' \nHICCUP (CONT'D) You got it, bud. Hiccup climbs onto Toothless and buckles himself in. Stoick grabs his arm. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 94. \nSTOICK Hiccup. I'm sorry...for everything. \nHICCUP Yeah...me too. \nSTOICK You don't have to go up there. \nHICCUP We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard. They exchange smiles. \nSTOICK I'm proud to call you my son. Hiccup beams, taken aback. \nHICCUP Thanks dad. Stoick lets go of Hiccup's arm. Hiccup spurs Toothless on, charged with his father's belief in him. They rocket into the sky as Stoick watches. \nIN THE AIR Astrid sees Toothless streaking through the sky, gaining altitude. \nASTRID He's up! She turns to Ruffnut and Tuffnut, who are ARGUING and THROWING PUNCHES at each other. \nASTRID (CONT'D) Get Snotlout out of there! IN MID-PUNCH, the twins look over to see Snotlout stranded on the monster's head. They eye each other. \nTUFFNUT RUFFNUT I'm on it! I'm on it! \nTUFFNUT I'm on it first! I'm ahead of you. The twins spot Snotlout on the giant dragon and steer their Zippleback in his direction. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 95. \nRUFFNUT Hey! Let me drive! The twins peel off, ARGUING as they race each other to the monster. Snotlout sees the Zippleback diving toward him and DASHES down the Red Death's head. He runs up the end of its horn... As the twins sweep past, both missing him... but perfectly snatching him where the necks merge. Ruff and Tuff eye each other, surprised and impressed. \nTUFFNUT I can't believe that worked. The Red Death spots Astrid and INHALES, preparing to blast. She and her Nadder get caught in the suction, pulled toward the monster's gaping mouth. \nON THE GROUND The Vikings watch with dread. They hear the familiar whir of the... \nGOBBER Night Fury! Get down! \nIN THE AIR A massive BLAST jolts the Red Death's head sideways. Astrid is thrown clear of its mouth... AND her Nadder. She tumbles through the air. The ground races toward her, when... She's suddenly CAUGHT by the leg. She looks up to see Toothless. \nHICCUP Did you get her? Toothless grunts. \nON THE GROUND They fly over the crowd of Vikings and set Astrid down, mid- run. They circle back to reengage - a black speck against the clouds. \n", "test1_input": "PHLEGMA THE FIERCE To the ships! \nSPITELOUT I'm with you Stoick! \nSTOICK \n(DRY) That's more like it. The Vikings rush for the door, leaving Gobber and Stoick alone. Gobber gulps back the contents of his tankard attachment and scrapes back the bench. \nGOBBER I'll pack my undies. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 16. \nSTOICK No, I need you to stay and train some new recruits. \nGOBBER Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy, Hiccup can cover the stall. Molten steel, razor sharp blades, lots of time to himself...what could possibly go wrong? Stoick sinks onto the bench beside Gobber, his brow burdened. \nSTOICK What am I going to do with him Gobber? \nGOBBER Put him in training with the others. \nSTOICK No, I'm serious. \nGOBBER So am I. Stoick turns to him, glaring. \nSTOICK He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage. \nGOBBER Oh, you don't know that. \nSTOICK I do know that, actually. \nGOBBER No, you don't. \nSTOICK No, actually I do. \nGOBBER No you don't! \nSTOICK Listen! You know what he's like. From the time he could crawl he's been...different. He doesn't listen. \n(MORE) \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 17. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Has the attention span of a sparrow. I take him fishing and he goes hunting for... for trolls. \nGOBBER \n(DEFENSIVE) Trolls exist! They steal your socks. \n(DARKLY) But only the left ones. What's with that? \nSTOICK When I was a boy... \nGOBBER \n(GRUMBLING) Oh here we go. \nSTOICK My father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it. I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him. And you know what happened? \n", "test1_true": "STOICK That rock split in two. It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber. He could crush mountains, level forests, tame seas! Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become. \n(BEAT) Hiccup is not that boy. \nGOBBER You can't stop him, Stoick. You can only prepare him. \n(BEAT) Look, I know it seems hopeless. But the truth is you won't always be around to protect him. He's going to get out there again. He's probably out there now. ON STOICK, as Gobber's words hit their mark. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nON AN OPEN NOTEBOOK \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 18. A drawn map of the island, covered in X's. Hiccup looks up from it and peeks over a gorge, expectantly. Sees nothing. He adds another 'X' to the page, then scratches his pencil over the whole map in frustration. He snaps the book closed and pockets it. \nHICCUP Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people lose their knife or their mug. No, not me. I manage to lose an entire dragon. Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him, hitting him in the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree trunk. His eyes follow it to a long trench of up-turned earth. He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail tangled in a bola. It appears dead. Hiccup approaches, beaming. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(IN SHOCK) Oh wow. I did it. I did it. This fixes everything. \n(ELATED) Yes! He strikes a victory pose, planting his foot on the fallen Night Fury. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) I have brought down this mighty beast! It suddenly shifts. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Whoa! Hiccup springs back, terrified. He turns his blade on it. Rattled, Hiccup creeps along the length of the weak, wounded dragon, dagger poised to strike. As he reaches the head, Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring coldly at him. Hiccup tries to look away, but he's drawn back to its unnerving, unflinching stare. With the dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with his dagger, puffing himself up with false bravado. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 19. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) I'm going to kill you, Dragon. I'm gonna cut out your heart and take it to my father. I'm a Viking. \n(BEAT) I am a VIKING! Hiccup raises the dagger, determined to prove his Viking- ness. The dragon's labored breathing breaks Hiccup's clenched concentration. He opens an eye, uncertainty leaking through. The dragon holds the stare. Something profound is exchanged. Finally, the Night Fury closes its eye and lowers its head, resigned to its fate. Hiccup tries to go through with it, holding the dagger aloft... fighting himself... until finally lowering it with a frustrated sigh. He looks over the dragon's chaffed rope wounds. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) (muttered, ashamed) I did this. He turns to leave. Pauses. And glances back at the dragon, chest heaving. Hiccup GRUMBLES. He checks over his shoulder to ensure that no one is watching... then hurries back to cut the ropes. The Night Fury's eye shoots open. With the dragon watching his every move, Hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes. As the last rope falls free, the Night Fury suddenly POUNCES! In a blur, the dragon is upon him, pinning Hiccup down, grazing his neck. Looking like it's about to kill him. Hiccup is paralyzed. The dragon's breath ruffles his hair. Hiccup opens his eyes to find the Night Fury's wolf-like stare boring into him. The exchange is intense, profound. The dragon draws a deep breath, as though it's about to torch him, then lets out an ear-piercing scream instead. It turns and takes flight, flapping violently through the canopy of trees. It bashes against a nearby mountain side, recovers, and drops out of view some distance away. Winded, Hiccup struggles to his feet, staggers a few steps, collapses to his knees, and faints. \nINT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nHiccup enters to see... \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 20. STOICK, seated on a thick slice of tree-trunk. He is slouched over the fire-pit, stirring the coals with his axe. Embers waft around his beard. Hiccup tries to sneak past, up the stairs to his room. Stoick seems none the wiser, when... \nSTOICK Hiccup. \nHICCUP \n(CAUGHT) Dad. Uh... Stoick stands, takes a deep breath. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) I, uh... I have to talk to you, Dad. \nSTOICK I need to speak with you too, son. Hiccup and Stoick STRAIGHTEN at the same moment. \nHICCUP STOICK I've decided I don't want to I think it's time you learn fight dragons. to fight dragons. \n(BEAT) (BEAT) What? What? \nSTOICK (CONT'D) You go first. \nHICCUP No, you go first. \n", "test1_id": 579, "test2_input": "HICCUP Hey, so how would one sneak up on a Night Fury? \nGOBBER None one's ever met one and lived to tell the tale. Now get in there. \nHICCUP I know, I know, but hypothetically... \nASTRID \n(WHISPERED) Hiccup! She puts her finger to her lips and gestures for him to hide. A moment later, the Nadder leaps over the walls, surprising them by landing in front of her. Astrid somersaults into its blind spot, confusing it. She rears back to strike -- just as Snotlout LEAPS IN, protectively SWEEPING Astrid behind him. \nSNOTLOUT Watch out babe. I'll take care of this. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 36. \nASTRID Hey! Snotlout MISSES. Astrid glares at him. \nSNOTLOUT \n(DEFENSIVE) The sun was in my eyes, Astrid. What do you want me to do, block out the sun? I could do that, but I don't have time right now! The Nadder tears off after her, knocking down walls in pursuit. She leaps and dives like a highly trained gymnast. Hiccup wanders up to Gobber again. \nHICCUP They probably take the daytime off. You know, like a cat. Has anyone ever seen one napping? \nGOBBER Hiccup! \nASTRID --Hiccup! Hiccup spins around to see the maze walls collapsing like dominos toward him. Astrid comes flying through the dust and crash-lands on top of him, laying him out in a limb-tangled mess. \nTUFFNUT Oooh! Love on the battlefield! \nRUFFNUT She could do better. The Nadder closes in, emerging through the cloud of dust. \nHICCUP (struggling to untangle) Just... let me... why don't you... The Nadder spins around and races back toward them like a Raptor. Astrid untangles herself and tries to pull her axe from Hiccup's shield... which is attached to his limp, gangly arm. She PLANTS her foot on his torso and YANKS the axe free, still burrowed into the shield. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 37. She SPINS and SWINGS the axe and shield, scoring a DIRECT HIT on the oncoming Nadder's NOSE. It yelps and scurries off. \nGOBBER Well done, Astrid. Gobber hobbles off to wrestle the Nadder back into his cave. Hiccup gets to his feet -- all eyes are upon him. He turns to find Astrid glaring at him, winded. \nASTRID Is this some kind of a joke to you? Our parents' war is about to become ours. Figure out which side you're on. She grabs her axe and stomps off. Hiccup watches, stung. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COVE - MAGIC HOUR \nCLOSE ON A fish... being thrown into the cove. It hits the ground and slides. A moment later, Hiccup peeks through a gap in the rock, looking around cautiously. Nothing. Hiccup squeezes through and enters the cove. A BEAT, then Hiccup hears a SNORT from behind him. Hiccup turns to see the Night Fury, crouched on a rock like a stealthy panther. It descends, approaching him... ready to pounce. Hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish. Doing so reveals the dagger at his waist. The dragon sees it and hisses. Hiccup reaches for it, eliciting a growl. He pauses, carefully lifts it by the handle, and tosses it away. The dragon calms. As it approaches the fish, Hiccup notices that it's missing teeth. \nHICCUP Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn you had... A set of razor sharp teeth emerge from its gums to grab the fish. Toothless snatches and gnashes it up, swallowing it. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 38. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) ... teeth. The teeth retract again. Toothless presses closer with an expectant look. Hiccup retreats nervously. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Uh, no. No, I don't have any more. The Fury backs Hiccup against a rock, placing himself the same position as before. The dragon closes in over him, staring blankly. A tense moment passes... then Toothless regurgitates a chunk of fish onto Hiccup's lap. They exchange stares. Hiccup realizes what Toothless wants him to do. Hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up. The dragon waits expectantly. Hiccup gags and gnaws off a bite of the slimy fish. He forces a smile. Toothless mimics him. Amazed, Hiccup sits up and tries to touch him. Toothless HISSES and flaps off to a crash on the other side of the cove. He BLASTS the mossy ground to a red-hot temperature... and curls up on it like a giant dog. He turns to find Hiccup seated beside him. Toothless tolerates his persistent presence... until Hiccup tries to touch his damaged tail. Toothless SNAPS at him. Hiccup takes the hint and leaves. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. COVE - LATER \nIt's MAGIC HOUR. Toothless wakes, hanging upside down from a tree. He spots Hiccup sitting on the other side of the cove. Sketching in the sand. CLOSE ON a sketch of Toothless. Hiccup draws with a stick, minding his own business. Toothless appears behind him, watching carefully. Aware of his presence, Hiccup continues, trying not to scare him off. Toothless walks off. A moment later, he reappears with an entire sapling, drawing lines in the sand. He rushes here and there, making haphazard lines in every direction. Finally, Toothless drops the tree and inspects his work. He seems pleased. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT \nGobber and the recruits are seated at the top of an abandoned catapult tower, toasting campfire food around a roaring bonfire. \nGOBBER ...and with one twist he took my hand and swallowed it whole. And I saw the look on his face. (can't deny it) I was delicious. He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg. \nFISHLEGS Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon. Like if your mind was still in control of it you could have killed the dragon from the inside by crushing his heart or something. \nSNOTLOUT I swear I'm so angry right now. I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot. I'll chop off the legs of every dragon I fight, with my face. He postures to Astrid. She rolls her eyes. \nGOBBER (with a mouthful) Un-unh. It's the wings and the tails you really want. If it can't fly, it can't get away. A downed dragon is a dead dragon. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 40. ON HICCUP hiding his horrified look form the others. Gobber stands and stretches. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) Alright. I'm off to bed. You should be too. Tomorrow we get into the big boys. Slowly but surely making our way up to the Monstrous Nightmare. (playful, taunting) But who'll win the honor of killing it? He hobbles off. The teens reflect. \nTUFFNUT (very matter of fact) It's gonna be me. \n(BEAT) It's my destiny. See? Tuffnut rolls up his sleeve to reveal a red dragon on his arm. \nFISHLEGS \n(GASPS) Your mom let you get a tattoo? \nTUFFNUT It's not a tattoo. It's a birthmark. \nRUFFNUT Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth, and that was never there before. \nTUFFNUT Yes it was. You've just never seen me from the left side until now. \nSNOTLOUT It wasn't there yesterday. Is it a birthmark or a today-mark? Hiccup gets up and walks away from the group. Astrid watches him as he leaves the bonfire. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 41. \nINT. BLACKSMITH STALL - MOMENTS LATER \nHiccup enters a small room at the back of the stall. It's covered in drawings of weaponry and scale models. He lights a candle and lays his sketchbook out on the desk, opening it to the drawing of Toothless. With a look of determination. Hiccup picks up a charcoal stick and re-draws the missing tail. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BLACKSMITH STALL - LATER \nCLOSE ON ... a creaking leather bellows. The stone forge glows with every pump. Tongs pull intricate iron pieces from the coals. They're dropped onto the anvil, twisted, lightly hammered, and dunked in a barrel. The pieces are carried to Hiccup's workbench and laid out in place on a one-to-one schematic. It's a sketch of a mechanical fin. \nEXT. HIDDEN COVE - DAWN \nHiccup arrives, winded, straining under the weight of a full basket. He clicks the scale he found (like a jar top). Toothless approaches, sniffing him. \nHICCUP Hey Toothless. I brought breakfast. I hope you're hungry. Hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over. Fish spill out. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Okay, that's disgusting. Toothless approaches, settling in to devour the feast. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Uh..we've got some salmon... Toothless swallows it. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) ... some nice Icelandic cod... Swallows those too. \n", "test2_id": 580, "test3_input": "DISSOLVE TO: A whiteout of ash. And through it comes... \nSTOICK Hiccup? Hiccup!? Stoick appears, searching desperately. Everything is scorched. Even the ground is smoking from the terrible heat. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Hiccup!? Son!? Through the ash, Stoick the motionless silhouette of Toothless. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) \n(GRAVE) Hiccup. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 100. He hurries to the dragon's side. Toothless is roughed up, but conscious. His scorched saddle, however, is vacant. Stoick looks to the sky in despair. He buckles at the knees, overwhelmed by the loss. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Oh son...I did this... Astrid pushes through the crowd, her eyes welling up. Followed by Gobber. They flank Stoick as he kneels, slumped over. Behind them, a ring of Vikings form, keeping a respectful distance. As the dust and smoke clear, a ring of wild dragons can also be seen, gathering just behind and between the Vikings. Toothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward Stoick. Their eyes meet. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) I'm so sorry... Toothless unfolds his wings, revealing Hiccup, unconscious, clutched safely against his chest. Stoick's eyes widen. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Hiccup. He scoops Hiccup into his arms. Listens to his heart. Bursts into relieved laughter. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) He's alive! \n(TO TOOTHLESS) You brought him back alive! The crowd roars. Followed by the dragons. The Vikings look around to find themselves surrounded. Stoick leans close to Toothless, meeting him eye to eye. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) \n(PRIVATELY) Thank you... for saving my son. Gobber looks Hiccup up and down. \nGOBBER Well, you know... most of him. Stoick glances back at him. Gobber shrugs, redirecting his eyes toward... \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 101. \nINT. STOICK'S HOUSE - DAY \nCLOSE ON HICCUP, asleep, his head on a pillow. Healing scars on his face show that maybe a week or two have passed. Toothless hovers over him, WHINING and GRUMBLING impatiently. Hiccup stirs. Opens his eyes. \nHICCUP \n(GROGGY) Oh, hey Toothless. Toothless excitedly nuzzles and nudges Hiccup. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Okay, okay! I'm happy to see you too, bud. Now just-- Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT UPRIGHT with a YELP. He looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside the fire pit on the main floor of his house. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) I'm in my house. (re: Toothless, leaning over him, excited) You're in my house. Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far too big for the space. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Uh...does my dad know you're in here?! Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He eyes the rafters... and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with 'happy dog' energy. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(DISTRESSED) Okay, okay -- no Toothless! Aw, come on... Hiccup shifts to get out of bed... then pauses... sensing that something is wrong. He peels back the covers slowly. What he sees startles, horrifies, and overwhelms him -- all at once. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 102. \nON THE BARE FLOOR His booted foot touches down. Followed by a mechanical prosthetic in place of his second leg. It's an ingenious spring-loaded replacement, made of wood and iron. Toothless lands by the bed and approaches calmly, sniffing the new leg. He raises his eyes to meet Hiccup's, seemingly aware of what Hiccup is going through. Hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on it. He winces and stifles the pain... \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Okay...okay... ... but STUMBLES with the first step. Toothless catches Hiccup's fall with his head... and slowly lifts him up, stabilizing him. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Thanks bud. Hiccup leans on him like a crutch. They take a few steps together. Their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make their way toward the door. Hiccup pries it open (as he did in the opening scene), revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door. Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to Toothless, alarmed. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Toothless? Stay here, bud. Hiccup pauses... and cracks the door open again. He peeks outside, his eyes widening. He allows to door to swing open, revealing... ... the Monstrous Nightmare, carrying Snotlout on its back. \n", "test3_true": "\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 103. Vikings and dragons mill about by the dozen, basking on the rooftops, weaving along the plaza. No one seems upset, there isn't a sword in sight. Under the framework of a MASSIVE BARN, a Nadder BLASTS fire onto a metal brace. It steps back to let a Viking hammer it into shape. Nearby, a Gronkle lands, carrying a tree trunk in his mouth. He shows a Viking what he's found. The Viking pats his head. Another Viking backs a Zippleback into a stall to check it for size. Hiccup takes a step outside, finding Stoick waiting for him on the step. \nHICCUP I knew it. I'm dead. Stoick laughs. \nSTOICK No, but you gave it your best shot. He puts his arm around Hiccup, steadying him. He gestures to the transformed village. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) So? What do you think? Hiccup just shrugs, amazed. Below, the plaza, villagers take notice. \nVIKING #1 Hey look! It's Hiccup! They rush over, surrounding him with a hero's welcome. \nVIKING #2 Hiccup, how you doin' mate? \nVIKING #3 It's great to see you up and about. \nSTOICK \n(SWEETLY) Turns out all we needed was a little more of... \n(GESTURES NON-SPECIFICALLY \nAT HICCUP) ... this. \nHICCUP \n(PLAYING ALONG) You just gestured to all of me. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 104. \nGOBBER (O.S.) Well. Most of you. Gobber pushes through the crowd, beaming proudly. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) (re: the prosthetic leg) That bit's my handiwork. With a little Hiccup flare thrown in. Think it'll do? \nHICCUP (bittersweet, coming to \nTERMS) I might make a few tweaks. Astrid appears and jabs Hiccup in the arm. Hiccup recoils with a grumble. \nASTRID That's for scaring me. \nHICCUP \n(PROTESTING) What, is it always going to be this way? Cause I... She grabs him aggressively... then kisses him. Hoots and hollers follow. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) ... could get used to it. Gobber presents Hiccup with a rebuilt saddle, rigging, and tail. \nGOBBER Welcome home. Suddenly, Toothless pounces on the crowd, crushing several unsuspecting Vikings under his weight. \nVIKING Night Fury, get down! Toothless eyes the new tail excitedly, tongue wagging. Amidst the groans and grumbles, Hiccup and Astrid exchange a sheepish grin. \nCLOSE ON \nCLOSE ON Hiccup's prosthetic foot, snapping into the modified stirrup. \n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 105.

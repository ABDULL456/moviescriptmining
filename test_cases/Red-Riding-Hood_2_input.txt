EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAY 
Isabelle walks through the snow. A thick fog gives the forest a strange, dream-like feeling. A cold wind blows. Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her. She stops and turns. Slowly, a figure appears. It's Peter. 
PETER Thank God you're all right. He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away. A beat. 
ISABELLE I'm fine. You sent Henri to help me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETER What did he tell you? Isabelle gives him a hurt look. 
ISABELLE Those people back there. I know they mean well, but they're just people. I didn't expect anything from them. I expected something from you. 
PETER I just need to talk to you. 
ISABELLE I'm going to see my Grandmother. She's sick. Please don't follow me. Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there, watching her go. When she looks back, he's gone. She sighs, wiping tears from her eyes. She continues on... Then: FOOTSTEPS behind her again. She stops and looks back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows her in the fog. She walks faster. She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision. She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main path, she throws the branch aside... ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks ominous. She gives it a wary look, then starts walking. 
EXT. GULLY - DAY 
Isabelle reaches the rope bridge. More of the rotten boards have fallen out during the winter. Isabelle looks down. It's a long drop to the river below. She edges out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards, holding onto the rope with both hands... Suddenly -- CRACK! A board SNAPS under her weight. At the last instant, she regains her balance. The broken board SPLASHES into the water. She takes a moment to catch her breath before continuing... 
EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK 
Isabelle crosses the little bridge and knocks on the front door. The fog still hangs over everything. She doesn't notice the dark stain under her feet... 
ISABELLE Grandmother? Are you awake? She listens at the door. A long beat. Then: 
THE FIGURE (O.S.) Pull the bobbin. The latch will open. We recognize the thin, raspy voice. Isabelle hesitates, then pulls the bobbin and opens the door... 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - DUSK 
The Reeve and a GUARD examine something O.S. 
REEVE You're certain nobody has seen him since last night? 
GUARD The Wolf must have taken him. What else could have done that? They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up. The metal door has been ripped off its hinges... 
INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK 
Isabelle closes the door. A pot is cooking over the fire. The cat lounges in its heat, grooming itself. It looks up at Isabelle as she enters. Isabelle stops. The veil that has always been closed is now open. Beyond it, we see Grandmother propped up in bed. The light is too dim to see her very well, just a candle by her bed. She's wearing a nightgown and cap. She doesn't move. 
THE FIGURE I've been expecting you. Isabelle starts toward the bedroom with the basket... 
ISABELLE Mother sent some food. There are cakes and a pot of butter -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THE FIGURE Don't come in here. Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in darkness. Isabelle gives her a questioning look. 
THE FIGURE I'm not hungry right now. 
ISABELLE Are you sure? You sound so weak. 
THE FIGURE I just made myself a stew. I left it over the fire for you. Isabelle glances back at the pot BUBBLING over the fire. 
ISABELLE I came here to take care of you. Not the other way around. 
THE FIGURE Don't be silly, my dear. You've been through so much. Sit down. Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's knitting needles sticking out of it. 
THE FIGURE There's no burden so heavy that it doesn't seem a little lighter on a full stomach. 
ISABELLE 
(SMILES) You always say that. She ladles some soup into a bowl and sits down. The cat looks up from its grooming, watching her...

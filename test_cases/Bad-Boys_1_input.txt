BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                            79. B181   MASTER BEDROOM                                              B181 Where Theresa sits amongst boxes of new clothes.   Lowrey gives a polite rap on the door. LOWREY Hey, hey.   That's not cryin' I hear. THERESA (wipes tears) Oh, it's nothing... I just bought some clothes. It's been so long since I bought anything nice... I just wanted something to wear for Marcus when he got home. But nothing looks right... (starts crying again) He's slipping away from me, Mike. I can feel it. LOWREY (sits next to her) Theresa. Listen to me. Nobody's slipping away from you. Especially not Marcus. You can take my word on that... As for the clothes... Lowrey pulls a random item out of a box.   It's hideous. LOWREY Okay. Just a minor fashion faux paux. Those cappuccinos at lunch can do that to you... See what else we got here. 
181    INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                 181 Burnett is preparing the couch with a pillow and blanket when he sniffs at the air. Something foul. Burnett lowers his nose to the cushions. The smell gets worse. 
182    INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT                       182 Burnett crawls into the bed, fully clothed. This is awkward. Julie calls out from the bathroom. JULIE (O.S.) I'm really sorry about the dog pee. They must be traumatized by the new surroundings. I'll pay for new cushions. (CONTINUED) 
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                            80. 182   CONTINUED:                                                  182 BURNETT That's perfectly alright -- Julie suddenly flops on the bed, wearing a gorgeous nightgown. JULIE So, Mike.   Can I ask you something? BURNETT Sure. JULIE Do you always come to bed with your clothes on? Or just when there's a woman in it? BURNETT I'm on protective duty. And I want you to feel... protected. So I'm dressed and ready. It's okay. I've done it before. JULIE Really. You think Marcus would wear clothes to bed while on protective duty? BURNETT Sure he would. It's a cop thing. JULIE Oh, I definitely have a cop thing, too. BURNETT You do? JULIE Well Marcus. He's very   something ... sexy. And the way I   came in tonight, he was throwing  everybody this way and that and he  took control. BURNETT Well, I drove. JULIE I know.   You drove well. BURNETT I shot the gas tank on the car.

BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                            80A. 182   CONTINUED:   (2)                                         182 JULIE That's right, you did. And it was exciting... But Marcus... (bites her lip) Something about him... His wife. What's her name? BURNETT Theresa.   Why? JULIE I'll bet Theresa is takin' care of business right now. BURNETT What's that supposed to mean? JULIE You know, relieve his tension. A woman'll do anything to keep a man like that. You know what I mean? Tonight... made me a little bit horny, I guess. I think, maybe. It was the car chase. Or the guns and everything. I've never shot a gun before. Maybe it's the steel or something. I'm feeling a little... funny. BURNETT Funny? JULIE I don't know.    Do you feel a little funny? 
BURNETT Yeah... I feel a little funny. JULIE Not that kind of funny. BURNETT What kind of funny? JULIE You know... (rubs him) Funny. BURNETT I gotta call Marcus. Burnett's out of bed like a shot and headed for the living room.

A184   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                               A184 Lowrey is admiring his work. LOWREY That's right.    Turn around. Theresa turns, looking transformed in the outfit put together by Lowery. THERESA You think he'll like it? I mean, I want him to, you know, want to... 
The PHONE RINGS. Lowrey is talking and picking up the phone at the same time. LOWREY Want to? Baby. Someone I know's gonna burn you right to the ground. Get ready! (then, into phone) You're on the mic with Mike... Hello? 
184    INT. LOWREY'S LIVING ROOM                                 184 CAMERA is TIGHT ON Burnett's face. He's angry as he stares at the phone. His worst fears have been confirmed. He hangs up.

JULIE Usually the guy throws me out after he fucks me. BURNETT I'm different. I'm a cop.     And now I gotta kill a guy. 
186   INT. BURNETT HOUSE - NIGHT                                  186 From the top of the stairs we see and hear... 
KIDS G'night, Uncle Mike. THERESA Yeah.   Good night, Uncle Mike. LOWREY G'night, everybody. Lowrey's at the window. Parked just down the street is the same sedan. He goes for the phone and dials. Waits for an answer. LOWREY Hey, Sanchez. It's me Lowrey... Yeah? Same to you, pal. But listen. I got something you'll want a piece of. 
187   INT. PORSCHE (BURNETT'S NEIGHBORHOOD) - NIGHT               187 GRINDING GEARS, Burnett stops around the corner from his house. He turns OFF the IGNITION and turns to Julie. BURNETT I got some jewelry for you. Before Julie can respond, Burnett's cuffing her to the steering wheel. JULIE You prick! First you don't want me. Then you drag me out... (MORE) (CONTINUED)

MACREEDY (to Pete) Still expecting that convention? 
PETE (looking up) What...? 
MACREEDY If you're expecting any extra cowboys, my room is available. 
PETE You're checking out? 
MACREEDY (nodding) Is there a train through here tonight? 
PETE Nothing till tomorrow morning. The streamliner. 
MACREEDY I know that. How about freights? (Pete shakes his head) Milk train? 
PETE Tomorrow. After the streamliner. 
MACREEDY Busses? 
PETE Closest stop is Sand City -- thirty- two miles away. (a beat) You're in such a hurry, you should have never got off here. 
MACREEDY I'm inclined to agree with you. 
He turns, walks toward porch. Pete looks at Smith. Smith's eyes follow Macreedy.

WHAT SHE SEES - MACREEDY

EXT. LUBE PIT - LIZ 
She does not answer. Instead, she silently twists the crankcase petcock, stopping the flow of oil. She watches Macreedy closely. 
INT. GARAGE 
Macreedy again shifts his eyes to the jeep, then, with decision, he goes to a work bench, opening the drawers and rummaging among the contents. 
LIZ (o.s.) If you're looking for the jeep key... 
Macreedy turns as Liz comes toward him. She gestures toward the open drawers. 
LIZ ...it's not there... 
Macreedy waits for her to go on. She doesn't. She stands there, staring at him. 
MACREEDY (after a beat) In that case, where do you suggest I look? 
She turns, walks back toward the lube pit. 
LIZ (over her shoulders) The jeep's not for rent.

ON KIMBLE 
Climbing the stairs... suddenly stops. 
A small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks it up... a pearl. 
KIMBLE Helen? 
Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor. 
UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 
Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. Adrenal surge. 
Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry hall below. 
SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING. 
The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow. 
Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable face... 
The SIRENS are LOUDER... 
Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs. 
Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom... 
HELEN (O.S.) He's here... still in the house... 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Lying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one hand, her head with the other. 
911 (V.O.) Did I hear you right? Your attacker is still in the house? Ma'am? 
HELEN He's trying to kill me... 
Kimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him. 
911 (V.O.) Will you repeat that please? 
HELEN (to Kimble) Richard... He's trying to kill me... my head. 
EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly to the house. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Kimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she was held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her leg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick. 
KIMBLE Hang on, babe... going to be all right. 
Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on. 
HELEN My head. Richard my hold me. 
Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes she won't be all right. 
CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone. 
911 (V.O.) ... Hello. You said his name is Richard? Ma'am, can you talk to me? Ma'am? 
CUT TO: 
INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The Cops enter the house. See the .38 lying on the floor. Covering each other, they move quickly up the stairs - guns drawn. 
ANGLE 
Third floor. The First Cop, gun drawn, turns the corner of Kimble's bedroom and finds: 
Kimble holding his dead wife. Blood on his hands. 
COP #1 Move away from her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
Kimble, numbed by the event, washes the blood off his hands in the kitchen sink. A cop takes his blood-stained tux jacket, and another hands him a parka. 
EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious neighbors, television news vans, etc. 
Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear. 
DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.) Can you give us a little more to go on besides the fact that he had an artificial arm? What kind of gun was it, Doc? 
INT. 11TH STREET DISTRICT HOUSE - NIGHT 
CAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why" shock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives: KELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight, aggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down. 
KIMBLE It was .38... I think. I only saw it for a second. I knocked it out of his hand. 
As Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the murder scene being processed: 
FLASH - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Forensics technicians photograph the .38 at the base of the stairs. 
DETECTIVE ROSETTI (V.O.) Do you own a gun, Dr. Kimble? 
KIMBLE Yes. 
DETECTIVE ROSETTI (V.O.) What kind of gun? 
KIMBLE A .38 Smith.

DENVER Mama?....Mama I'm going out.. (no response) Mama, I got a job. Working over at the Bodwins at night. Mr. Bodwin coming over now to pick me up on his way back from town. I'll be staying there nights and coming back here for the daytime. We'll have some money, mama..Mama? 
Sethe continues her action as if hypnotized. Denver approaches her from behind and whispers softly; 
DENVER I'm going help you, mama. Don't you give up yet. 
Denver touches her gently, but Sethe acts as if she hears and feels nothing. Denver exits. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE THAT DAY. 
Denver is sitting on the stump waiting for Mr. Bodwin when she hears; 
THIRTY WOMEN, gathered together, walking up Bluestone Rd. towards 124, SINGING A HOLY SONG; 
Denver is amazed by the sight as the women position themselves right in front of 124 - armed with bibles, crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they could find. 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD; THE KEEPING ROOM - DAY. 
Sethe is rubbing a naked Beloved's forehead with a cool cloth filled with ice, when the two women hear the singing. 
Beloved rises first and moves to the window to see. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
The women continue singing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FURTHER DOWN BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
MR. BODWIN, sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse, is riding toward 124 when he hears the singing as well. 
WE NOTICE THAT MR. BODWIN IS WEARING A HAT SIMILAR TO THE ONE SCHOOLTEACHER WORE on that fateful day. 
CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
The women continue singing as: 
Sethe and Beloved, her belly as big as a pregnant woman's, exit the house. 
The women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by the lack of fear between the women. 
Sethe is holding Beloved's hand. Beloved is smiling brightly at the beautiful singing. 
Denver looks to her mother; 
Tears run down Sethe's face but she is not crying. The sound of the women's voices wash over her like a baptism. She looks to all the women, faces she remembers, faces she has missed although up until this moment was not conscious of missing. 
Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees: 
MR. BODWIN APPROACHING IN HIS WAGON. SHE SEES MR. BODWIN WEARING A HAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SCHOOLTEACHERS. 
Sethe's expression turns to fear, then rage. In her ravaged mind, she thinks it is Schoolteacher coming back... 
SETHE No...No, he's not coming into my yard. He not taking my best thing...No.. 
She releases Beloved's hand and moves forward... 
SETHE No...no...no.. 
DENVER Mama? 
She passes Denver, feeling for the ICE PICK IN HER APRON. 
SETHE No...NO..NO..NOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
As Mr. Bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from 124. HIS EYES FOCUS IN WONDER ON THE NAKED BELOVED AS; 
SETHE RUNS TOWARDS HIM AND THE WOMEN, HER HAND EXTENDED HOLDING THE ICE PICK.. 
DENVER MAMA...NOOOOOOO! 
DENVER RUNS AFTER HER. SETHE REACHES THE WOMEN AND LUNGES FOR BODWIN BUT THE WOMEN SEIZE HER, CREATING A HILL OF BLACK PEOPLE. SETHE RISING TO THE TOP, HER HAND EXTENDED. DENVER REACHING HER FROM BEHIND, PULLING HER BACK AND PUNCHING HER OUT COLD AS THE BODIES FALL AROUND THEM.... 
Beloved watches from the house - watches Sethe attack and defend with the ice pick.  And something within her is resolved. For a moment, we see a calm spirit instead of a wild animal. And a tear upon her face.. 
Then, just as quickly, she sprints around the side of the house and disappears from view. 
The Women try to help Sethe as Denver cries for her mother. Mr. Bodwin looks on stunned. 
WIDE ANGLE - OF A NAKED BLACK WOMAN WITH A FULL BELLY RUNNING THROUGH AN OPEN FIELD, REACHING THE WOODS THEN DISAPPEARING INTO THE TREES...... 
FADE OUT; 
FADE IN: 
EXT. RICHMOND ST. - DAY. WEEKS LATER. 
Paul D. is on his way to work when he sees; 
A poised, confident Denver walking in the opposite direction. She spots him and smiles; 
DENVER Good morning, Paul D. 
Paul is clearly impressed by the sight of her. 
PAUL Well, is it now? How you getting along? 
DENVER Don't pay to complain. 
PAUL You on your way home? 
DENVER No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama. 
PAUL They treating you right over at the Bodwins? 
DENVER More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me. 
Paul smiles - wanting to warn her but deciding not to spoil the possibilities that lay before her. 
PAUL Your mother all right? 
DENVER No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.

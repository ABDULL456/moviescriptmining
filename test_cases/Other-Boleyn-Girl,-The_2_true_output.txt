Instead, MARY's eyes meet ANNE's. 
ANNE's eyes stare back. The ultimate moment of revenge. 
barely perceptible smile of satisfaction, then ANNE turns and goes. 
The MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS stare at one another, visibly embarrassed by what they have just witnessed. 
The clearing of throats, averting of eyes. Then they get on with their work to the sound of the MARY's cries.. 
INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - NIGHT `Crash', SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst into the study, angrily slamming the door closed behind them. ANNE is inside. 
NORFOLK Damn you! Three years we've been working on this! Not a single detail was left to chance! And now, in the moment of our greatest glory.. 
NORFOLK stares at ANNE.. 
NORFOLK All I can say is you'd better have a plan. And it had better work. 
ANNE stares back defiantly.. 
ANNE Or what...Uncle? 
LADY ELIZABETH Stop it! Both of you. What shall we do about Mary? And the child? Or have we forgotten them already? 
ANNE Mary should go back to her husband. 
Not a flicker of emotion on her face. 
ANNE She has been inconvenienced long enough by this family. 
ADY ELIZABETH Fine. Then you can be the one to tell her. 
ADY ELIZABETH stares at ANNE..

LADY ELIZABETH I think you've earned that privilege. 
LADY ELIZABETH turns and walks out. ANNE's smile fades. 
INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY MARY lies in bed. She looks pale. Exhausted. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY ANNE stares into the room through a crack in the doorway. 
A flicker of doubt. What has she done? To her own sister? 
ANNE checks herself. Enough sentiment. She swallows it. 
nd enters. 
INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY MARY looks up as ANNE enters, and freezes.. 
MARY How can you show your face in here? 
ANNE I understand you're angry - but be assured. I did nothing, except remind him of you. 
MARY Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately. As revenge. (a beat) And now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has been done. 
ANNE Well, hasn't it? 
MARY Be careful, that's my advice. Learn from my experience. Because he'll only do to you what he has done to me. 
ANNE Never. I'll make sure he understands I'm a greater thing by far. That he can never have me until he makes me a far greater offer. 
(CONTINUED) 
O 
MARY You'll never get Henry Percy back, if that's what you mean. 
ANNE That's not what I mean. 
ANNE's eyes burn with anger.. 
ANNE And don't you ever mention his name to me again. I'll never forget how you betrayed me. 
MARY If that's what you think, fine. Tell yourself that. 
ANNE I did, sister. Every day for three years. 
ANNE turns, and walks out. 
EXT. COURTYARD - DAY MARY is leaving COURT. Pale. Weak. Her belongings have been packed into boxes. Ahead of her, the BABY is being carried by MIDWIVES, led by WILLIAM STAFFORD. 
MARY walks across a courtyard, then stops in her tracks. 
VER BY THE STABLES: the KING and ANNE are mounting horses to go riding together. HENRY lifts ANNE up into the saddle behind him, (how she has learned!). ANNE holds tight, her arms wrapped around his waist.. 
At that moment, ANNE looks over and sees MARY. Their eyes meet. They stare for a beat, then.. 
ANNE kicks HENRY's horse, `Hah!', and they ride out. Galloping into the distance. 
MARY's face: fighting to hold onto her dignity. WILLIAM STAFFORD watches her, his eyes burning with sympathy. 
REVERSE ANGLE: to reveal, this is all being watched by QUEEN KATHERINE, from a palace window above.. 
QUEEN KATHERINE turns, and coldly lets the curtain drop..

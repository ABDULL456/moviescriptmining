MARIANNE Mrs Jennings is not everyone. 
MARGARET I like her! She talks about things. We never talk about things. 
MRS DASHWOOD Hush, please, now that is enough, Margaret. If you cannot think of anything appropriate to say, you will please restrict your remarks to the weather. 
A heated pause. 
MARGARET I like Colonel Brandon too. He's been to places. 
EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - DAY 
In the background, SIR JOHN, ELINOR and MRS JENNINGS pack the remains of a picnic into a basket. MRS DASHWOOD and MARGARET examine a foxhole. In the foreground, MARIANNE is cutting bulrushes for basketwork. Her knife is blunt and she saws impatiently. 
COLONEL BRANDON materialises at her side and wordlessly offers her his hunting knife. Oddly nervous, MARIANNE takes it. She turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease. The COLONEL's gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet. 
INT. KEEPER'S LODGE - BARTON PARK - DAY 
SIR JOHN and BRANDON are cleaning their guns in companionable silence--a habit left over from army days. SIR JOHN eyes BRANDON roguishly. 
SIR JOHN You know what they're saying, of course... 
No answer. 
SIR JOHN The word is that you have developed a taste for--certain company. 
BRANDON stays resolutely silent. SIR JOHN is emboldened. 
SIR JOHN And why not, say I. A man like you-- in his prime--she'd be a most fortunate young lady-- 
BRANDON cuts across him. 
COLONEL BRANDON Marianne Dashwood would no more think of me than she would of you, John. 
SIR JOHN Brandon, my boy, do not think of yourself so meanly-- 
COLONEL BRANDON And all the better for her. 
SIR JOHN subsides. BRANDON is clearly as angry with himself as he is with SIR JOHN. 
EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - ANOTHER DAY 
BRANDON strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between its jaws. The bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then stops. He stands for a moment deep in thought. Then he takes his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively. 
EXT. BARTON PARK - GARDENS - DAY 
An outdoor luncheon is in progress. COLONEL BRANDON is talking to MRS DASHWOOD. Occasionally he looks over towards MARIANNE, who is playing bilboquet with SIR JOHN and MARGARET. MRS JENNINGS nudges ELINOR hard and gestures to BRANDON. 
MRS JENNINGS (stage whisper) Besotted! Excellent match, for he is rich and she is handsome. 
ELINOR How long have you known the Colonel? 
MRS JENNINGS Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever I have been here, and I came fifteen years back. His estate at Delaford is but four miles hence and he and John are very thick. He has no wife or children of his own, for-- 
MRS JENNINGS lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper. 
MRS JENNINGS --he has a tragic history. He loved a girl once--twenty years ago now--a ward to his family, but they were not permitted to marry... 
ELINOR is intrigued. 
ELINOR On what grounds? 
MRS JENNINGS Money. Eliza was poor. When the father discovered their amour, she was flung out of the house and he packed off into the army. I believe he would have done himself a harm if not for John... 
ELINOR What became of the lady? 
MRS JENNINGS Oh, she was passed from man to man-- disappeared from all good society. When Brandon got back from India he searched for heaven knows how long, only to find her dying in a poor house. You have seen how it has affected him. Once I thought my daughter Charlotte might have cheered him up, but she is much better off where she is. 
ELINOR is silent with amazement at this unexpected history. 
MRS JENNINGS Look at him now, though. So attentive. I shall try an experiment on him. 
ELINOR Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings, leave the poor Colonel alone. 
MRS JENNINGS No, no, it is just the thing--all suitors need a little help, my dear 
MRS JENNINGS winks at ELINOR and rubs her hands as though about to perform a magic trick. 
MRS JENNINGS (trillingly) Colonel Brandon! 
BRANDON looks up. 
MRS JENNINGS We have not heard you play for us of late! 
COLONEL BRANDON For the simple reason that you have a far superior musician here. 
He indicates MARIANNE, who smiles absently. 
MRS JENNINGS Perhaps you did not know, Miss Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares your passion for music and plays the piano forte very well. 
MARIANNE looks at BRANDON in some surprise. 
MRS JENNINGS Play us a duet!

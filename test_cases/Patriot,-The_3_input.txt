DALTON OUR LINE IS FALTERING... 
Marion takes a quick glance at the Continental line, seeing... 
Scott, Rev. Oliver, Abner and a dozen more of his men, in the middle of a confused battle, with a larger mass of Redcoats who are advancing through the broken Continental line... 
MARION IS TORN... 
He looks to Tarleton, seeing him distracted, vulnerable but too distant a target for the pistol... 
Then Marion looks to Rev. Oliver and the others... Dalton can't wait... he runs off... 
Marion wavers... 
Then he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to help the faltering Patriots... 
TARLETON sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees Marion himself, his back exposed... 
AT THE PATRIOT LINE... 
Marion, Dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen arrive at the same time, beating back the Redcoats... 
As blue-uniformed Continentals reform the line, FIRING AT THE FALTERING REDCOATS... 
TARLETON sees Marion and fights his way toward him... 
Marion is oblivious, concentrating on holding the American line... 
Tarleton mounts a terrified, riderless horses, draws his sword and gallops back toward the British lines, on a path that takes him directly past Marion... 
Tarleton gets closer... raises his sword... slashes... 
Marion catches the flash of the blade out of the corner of his eye... 
Diverts the blow, knocking Tarleton from the mount... 
Tarleton hits the ground... Marion draws his pistol, about to fire at Tarleton... 
Tarleton KICKS OUT, knocking the pistol from Marion's hand... 
Tarleton GRABS HIS SWORD, SLASHES AT MARION who dodges the blow... 
Tarleton advances... Marion scrambles back, then rises... 
Marion grabs a BROKEN CAVALRY LANCE and FENDS OFF REPEATED BLOWS from Tarleton's SWORD... 
Then Marion sees his pistol, loaded with a bullet from Thomas' lead soldiers, lying on the ground... 
Marion makes his way toward the weapon... still BLOCKING BLOWS from Tarleton's sword... 
Marion focuses on the pistol... leaving himself exposed... 
Tarleton sees the OPENING... MOVES ON MARION... TARLETON RAISES HIS SWORD, about to deliver the killing blow... 
Marion dives... GRABS HIS PISTOL... FIRES... KILLING TARLETON WITH A SHOT TO THE CHEST... 
Marion, stunned, exhausted and surprised to be alive, watches Tarleton fall... 
Marion stands over Tarleton's body and gives himself a moment of bitter triumph, then he turns back to the battle at hand... 
Marion picks up Tarleton's sword and runs to the AMERICAN LINE which stiffens as Dalton and Rev. Oliver are joined by Marion and a dozen other Patriots... 
The blue-uniformed Continentals reform their line... 
Marion looks back toward Tarleton but finds that his body, along with the place and the moment of his death, has disappeared into the smoke of the battle... 
Marion and his men fight on... then, Redcoats start fleeing the field... 
First one Redcoat at a time... then more and more... 
EXT.  YORKTOWN - DAWN 
The next day.  Silence.  The battlefield, as far as the eye can see, is covered with the debris of war, dead men and scattered weapons. 
The British have retreated back behind their defenses but have left many of their men on the field. 
The Patriots, regulars and militia, wait behind their barricades. 
Then, a single figure appears on one of the British parapets.  A DRUMMER BOY, no more than ten-years-old. Behind him, a single British officer. 
They boy begins to beat the drum.  The officer raises a white flag. 
In the American lines, the men see the flag.  Some call out, some cheer, some laugh, most, among them MARION, simply take a deep breath.  It's finally over. 
EXT.  YORKTOWN FIELD - DAY 
A massive ceremony, carefully orchestrated, laid out on the cleaned up battlefield. 
Thousands of men, everyone in his place, as if well- directed actors in a grand theatrical performance. 
The French and American armies, fifteen thousand men between them, stand in perfect formation on either side of the field, forming an avenue for the British army which marches out of it's fortification. 
At the head of the avenue, WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF stand waiting. 
A musical band of Continentals, thirty men strong, loudly plays a tune, "The World Turned Upside Down," a jaunty British air with a melancholy undercurrent. 
CORNWALLIS marches with his officers, eyes straight ahead, covering his agony as best he can. 
As he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the South Carolina militia. 
MARION, standing with Dalton, Rev. Oliver, Abner, Scott and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass... 
CORNWALLIS glances over, noting what unit they are by a tattered battle standard that flies over them.  It's only a glance and he DOESN'T PICK OUT MARION, who is just one man among the many... 
AT THE HEAD OF THE AVENUE 
Cornwallis reaches Washington.  They exchange unheard formal greetings.

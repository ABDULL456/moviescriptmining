INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - VERY EARLY MORNING 
MARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human- sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front of him. He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then other. Again and again. It looks almost as if he's dancing gently with it. 
Then, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy, grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it to the mat, landing on top. 
QUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy - first one way, then the other - first one hold, then another - SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM - over and over and over again.

I/E. BARABOO SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - LATE MORNING 
Mark pulls his beat-up car into a space in the parking lot of this nondescript, 1960s-era suburban brick-facade school. He's freshly showered, wears a short-sleeve dress shirt, clip- on tie, slacks. He reaches behind the front seat and pulls out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE.

INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY 
Mark waits alone in a chair he's much too big for, his brown vinyl briefcase on his lap. A portrait of President Reagan hangs on the painted cinder block wall. A clock ticks.

INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Mark's on stage. An audience of 4th, 5th and 6th graders. 
MARK Why do I do it? Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? Why do I do it? 
The students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to make of him. Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with these kids. This is just what's on his mind. All the time. 
MARK (CONT'D) In 13 months - if I train right, if I push myself - I'll be going to Seoul - that's a city in South Korea. Does anyone know why? Because that's where the Olympic games are. 
Mark reaches into the briefcase at his feet and pulls out a RIBBON with a MEDAL dangling from it. 
MARK (CONT'D) Does anyone know what this is? 
As a couple of kids start to raise their hands -- 
MARK (CONT'D) Olympic gold medal. I won it three years ago at the `84 Games in Los Angeles. My brother, Dave Schultz - my best friend, my older brother, my best friend - won one too, just 23 hours and 16 minutes before I did. That's unprecedented - two brothers winning at the same Olympics. (THEN) Would you like me to win another one? Would you like me to win another gold medal - for us, for America? Would you like to see me and my big brother - Dave Schultz - both win gold medals? Who here wants to see the two brothers win again? 
Silence. A couple of the kids tentatively raise their hands. The rest are completely frozen. 
MARK (CONT'D) Well we're going to give it absolutely everything we've got.

INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY 
A SCHOOL SECRETARY writes out a check as Mark stands in front of the desk, placing his medal back in his briefcase. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY Twenty... and... no one-hundreds... 
She tears off the check and hands it to Mark. He takes the check, holds out to her a SIGNED 8x10 PHOTO of himself with his arms raised, in a USA WRESTLING SINGLET just after winning his Olympic gold. 
MARK And this is for the trophy case. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY I'm sorry?... For what? 
MARK For the trophy case. (BEAT) With the trophies. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY It's an elementary school. 
As Mark holds out the photo, WE HEAR: 
FAST FOOD KID (V.O.) Can I take your order? 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARBY'S - DAY 
A long-haired, greasy KID with the very beginnings of a mustache takes Mark's order. Mark looks up at the menu sign. 
MARK I'll have a # 4.

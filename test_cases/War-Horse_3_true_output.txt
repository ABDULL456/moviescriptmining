But Nicholls intervenes from his car. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS Let him be, Perkins. ALBERT This isn't the end. This isn't the end, my brother... I, Albert Narracott, solemnly swear we will be together again. Wherever you are, I will find you. And I will bring you home! 
And then they are past him, leaving him behind. As Perkins leads Joey across a stone bridge, Albert watches from the bank of the stream. 
Joey balks one last time - 
SAM PERKINS Whoa. Steady, steady. Steady now, come on. Walk on! Walk on now, come on! 
- then Perkins leads him away, leaving Albert behind. 
The very last recruits leave the village - leaving the debris of this army's visit strewn on the square. Like the debris of a party you are already beginning to regret. 
INT. ARMY STABLES. THE SAME. 
Joey is handed off to a groom. Joey is amazed by the scale of the building. Each horse has a large stall and is being tended to assiduously. Joey looks around at the hundreds of men and horses around him and panics. GROOM Whoa whoa whoa. Easy easy... 
He bucks, throwing the groom to the ground, and gallops away. But Perkins cuts him off, grabs his halter, and jerks him back to attention. 
SAM PERKINS Whoa whoa whoa, Joey! Stop muckin' about, you hear? Yer in the army now, son. 
He pushes him into his stall, next to Major Stewart's horse, a magnificent black stallion, TOPTHORN. 
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D) Good boy, good boy. Steady steady... Easy. Relax. Easy easy, back up. Joey rears up in his stall. 
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D) Joey - meet Topthorn. Topthorn - this is Joey. Sort out who's in charge between the two of you, you hear? If you want to fight, you get it over with - `cause once we're over there, you're gonna need everything you've got for Fritz! 
This is the first time that Joey has had to deal with another horse since his mother - the beginning of one of the most important relationships in his life. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS Gently, Perkins. I don't want to sour him. 
Nicholls passes his gloves and crop to his bat boy who is there to assist him. 
SAM PERKINS There'll be nothing gentle about the war, sir. And there'll be nothing gentle about this one either! 
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D) I understand that, Sergeant, but I want him fit and shining. He's my horse. 
SAM PERKINS (CONT'D) Sir. 
Nicholls is joined by his friend LIEUTENANT CHARLIE WAVERLY. He is sweet and friendly - upper class but completely benign. CHARLIE WAVERLY Scares the living daylights out of me. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS Who? 
CHARLIE WAVERLY Perkins. Glad he's on our side. 
They're both joined by a tall, confident officer, MAJOR JAMIE STEWART. He sizes up Joey. 
MAJOR STEWART Not bad. Not bad at all. Still not a patch on my Topthorn. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS I wouldn't be so sure. I think he's got potential. He's certainly got the bit between his teeth. 
CHARLIE WAVERLY I actually think my Blenheim is faster than the pair of them. 
MAJOR STEWART Clear off! 
He suddenly turns from the joking into the efficient senior officer he is. 
MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D) All right, gentlemen, listen here. Everything tells us the same story, from Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge to the Battle of Mars La Tours - the first attack can and should be the decisive one. Perkins... 
SAM PERKINS Yes, sir! 
MAJOR STEWART No excuses, no mistakes - every horse groomed and fit for presentation! I want a full practice charge tomorrow. 
SAM PERKINS Sir. 
They leave. 
EXT. SALISBURY PLAIN. DAY. 
The whole regiment is gathered. Everybody is in their ceremonial uniform. It all has the feeling of the Changing of the Guard rather than anything related to a real battle. The day is hot, the plains are quiet and beautiful, the gathering is huge, there is a real sense of pride and anticipation.

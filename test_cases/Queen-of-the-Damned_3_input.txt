The Punk Vampire pulls down her collar. 
PUNK VAMPIRE #1 Don't see any marks. 
JESSE You haven't seen the rest of my body. 
PUNK VAMPIRE #2 Is that an invitation? 
Jesse finds herself surrounded by the three Vampires. She shakes her head, too frightened to get out a response. 
PUNK VAMPIRE #3 So, where's your host? 
JESSE My host... oh he's here somewhere. 
She peers into the darkness, starts moving towards the door... 
Finds herself blocked by Punk Vampire #2. 
PUNK VAMPIRE #2 Your host. What's his name? 
Jesse looks around, trying not to panic. Pale faces, pale eyes stare at her. A long, terrible pause... Suddenly -- 
JESSE Marius... 
72   HOODED FIGURE                                                   72 
leans forward, surprised, studies this strange mortal, fascinated. 
73   BACK TO SCENE                                                   73 
PUNK VAMPIRE #1 Sorry.   Don't know the guy. 
The Punk Vampires laugh.     Jesse desperately tries to cover her terror. 
(CONTINUED) 
73   CONTINUED:                                                 73 
JESSE Marius has the blood of the ancients flowing in his veins. 
PUNK VAMPIRE #2 There aren't any ancients left. They all turned to dust... 
JESSE That's a myth. Marius is around here somewhere... 
Jesse again heads for the door. But Punk Vampire #1 has appeared in front of her. She stares at him, terrified. 
JESSE You... you really should meet him. 
PUNK VAMPIRE #1 And why is that? 
Jesse watches the other Punk Vampires slowly begin to close in on her. As she speaks, she slowly edges to the door... 
JESSE Because... because... he's wise, a philosopher... he asks the big questions. Like how are you going to get through eternity? It's easier for us mortals. Life is brief, but for you... 
She inches toward the door, desperately stalling. Their white faces gleam menacingly as they close in. She struggles to get the words out... 
JESSE I mean... what can you really do with immortality besides just slip from one day to the next, trapped in a void of meaninglessness, relieved only by your next victim? How do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom, hopelessness? 
The Punk Vampires pause, staring at her, as her words sink in. The hooded figure leans forward revealing his face... 
It is Lestat. He stares at Jesse, amazed. Jesse glances desperately at the door. It's just a few feet away now. 
(CONTINUED) 
73   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             73 
JESSE You know, it's like they say -- the more things change, the more they stay the same. For you that's forever, right? 
All around her, vampires are turning to look. The Punk Vampires stare at her, eyes narrowing. Jesse is now inches from the door. She can barely breathe. Punk Vampire #1 gazes at her, his confusion suddenly turning to anger. 
PUNK VAMPIRE #1 You know, you're really a downer... 
He bares his fangs. Jesse bolts out the door... PAN ACROSS vampire faces staring after Jesse TO Lestat who gazes at her, absolutely entranced. He watches the Punk Vampires head after Jesse. 
CUT TO: 
74   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                            74 
Jesse hurries up the alley. Breaks into a run. But the three Punk Vampires from the bar have somehow gotten outside. They land in front of her, beside her, behind her. Heart racing, she shakes with fear. They close in, smiling. 
PUNK VAMPIRE #3 Now this isn't gonna hurt.    You might even enjoy it... 
He runs his hand up and down her body. Jesse starts to shake. She breaks out in a cold sweat. The others grin. He picks her up by the throat. Her legs flail in the air... 
Suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats. Jesse hits the flagstones hard with a grunt. She gasps for air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley by an invisible force. Jesse alone, turns, still woozy. Finds herself staring at... 
Lestat... 
Jesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned. 
He drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks, her pulsing jugular.

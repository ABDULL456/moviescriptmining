MENENIUS Not out of doors! 
VOLUMNIA She shall, she shall. 
VIRGILIA Indeed, no, by your patience. I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars. 
MENENIUS Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably. 
VIRGILIA I cannot go hither. 
MENENIUS 
(PLAYFULLY) You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. 
VIRGILIA No, good sir, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth. 
MENENIUS Go with me and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband. 
VIRGILIA 0, good sir, there can be none yet. 
MENENIUS There came news from him last night. Volumnia pounces, moving in: 
VOLUMNIA Indeed? 
MENENIUS Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Corioles. They nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars This is true, on mine honor; and so, I pray, go out with us. 
VIRGILIA 
(AGAIN DECLINING) Give me excuse, good sir. I will obey you in everything hereafter. 
VOLUMNIA 
(SNAPS) Let her alone. As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth. She takes Menenius arm and pulls him out, eager for more news of her son. Virgilia sits for a beat. Then she presses a button on the remote control. The TV goes on again. More news reports of the war. We see images of the Volscian town of Corioles. A "BREAKING NEWS" scroll runs across the bottom of the screen The Battle for Corioles Virgilia watches the war footage, her eyes haunted. Hard cut to-- 
EXT. CORIOLES - DAY 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! A series of explosions jolt us. Corioles is a small urban center. Smoke billows up from areas of the city. The steady crack and rattle of gunfire. The occasional thud of explosions. We see urban street-to-street fighting. The images are startling in their familiarity: this could be Basra or Belfast. The battle is photographed in a gritty exposure. Color is drained out -- blood is a darker red like oil. Soldiers are dark forms moving through shadows and smoke. Martius and Titus, leading a platoon of around twenty Roman SOLDIERS, run into view and take cover. Bullets zip and snap around them. The Roman soldiers wear modern battle fatigues and body armor, tricked out with all the latest tech gear. The Volscians, being a poor guerilla force, wear thrown together uniforms that look almost tribal. Martius calls over the incessant din of battle to Titus and 
THE SOLDIERS: 
MARTIUS They fear us not, but issue forth their city. Sniper bullets slam into a wall near him. He coughs away the smoke and debris. This only makes him more angry: 
MARTIUS They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts, Which makes me sweat with wrath! He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce, And he shall feel mine edge! Martius leaps up and races on. The others follow in military order. The Roman soldiers move along the street -- it is chaotic -- explosions, smoke and sniper fire -- they duck into doorways and behind abandoned cars -- returning fire as best they can-- Martius leads -- firing stead bursts from his machine gun-- It is slow and bloody going-- Finally the Romans turn a corner and are stopped by a roadblock: a burning bus that fills the entire street-- The Volsces use this roadblock to ambush the Roman soldiers-- We see glimpses of Volscian soldiers darting for position -- firing from rooftops and from inside shops-- 
BLISTERING CROSSFIRE-- 
INT. BLASTED HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Aufidius runs into a blasted hotel room. Some of his soldiers with him. He goes to the window. Scans the street below. Sees Martius and the others trapped at the bus. He gestures to an aide for

MAX Where the hell is my bomb? 
The Short Scientist points to a large flatbed pick-up. A HEAVY TARPED BOMB LIKE PACKAGE strapped to the back. 
SHORT SCIENTIST You do not get it till I get the money. 
MAX For a guy who's all about transcending materialism, you talk about money so much! 
SHORT SCIENTIST If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will cut your mouth out of your face. 
MAX Fine... 
INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY STORE -- NIGHT 
After business hours. A WINDOW SMASHES. Roque climbs inside. Goes to the front and unlocks it for the others, who carry a BLEEDING JENSEN in. They lay him on a table. 
POOCH She burned us, Clay. CLAY (PACING) I know... 
POOCH The whole op is compromised- 
CLAY I know. 
JENSEN Hey, fallen comrade here! Blood flowing out of his body... (SMALLER VOICE) Precious, precious blood... 
CLAY (RE: JENSEN) Cougar? Cougar nods. Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a WOODEN DOWEL. Comes over as Jensen looks at the last one. 
JENSEN What's that for? 
Cougar SHOVES IT BETWEEN JENSEN'S TEETH as an answer... 
POOCH So we split up again. Right? 
Clay doesn't respond... 
POOCH (CONT'D) Right? 
ROQUE Pooch... 
POOCH (IGNORING HIM) Goddammit, Clay, whatever she knows, Max knows! It's over! 
His words echo through the room. 
JENSEN SCREAMS through the dowel as Cougar sews him up... 
This is how low they've sunk. Clay finally looks up. 
CLAY (SLOWLY) Okay. We split up. Some of us should go international. I'll do that if nobody else wants to- 
ROQUE So we just run again? 
Clay turns to him. 
CLAY There's nothing else we can do... 
Silence. Then: 
ROQUE There's something we can do. 
A beat. CLAY Excuse me? 
ROQUE Three years is enough. If there's a drive at that port that we can use to get clear- 
CLAY What part of "he knows we're coming for it" do you not get? They're gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec is gonna waiting for us... 
ROQUE So figure out a way around them; you're good at that shit, Clay! 
He turns, addressing all of them: 
ROQUE (CONT'D) We run now, we're gonna be running forever. This is our one chance to get our lives back... (TO CLAY) To steal them back. And I'm prepared to do anything to any one to make that happen. 
He looks Clay dead in the eye. ROQUE (CONT'D) Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win. 
A long beat. Clay, not breaking his look with Roque: 
CLAY Pooch, what's the minimum time to scout the patrols, get an accurate head count on-site at the Port? 
POOCH 48 hours, but Aisha knows that- 
CLAY So we hit them in twelve. 
Roque smiles. Pooch blinks. POOCH Twelve hours from now? You mean-- you want us to go in blind?

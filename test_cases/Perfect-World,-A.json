Adler on the short wave and tacking up a map, Bobby Lee still in his corner, Red and Sally sitting across from one another at the \"kitchen table\". \nIn the rear section of the Airstream Red's chair and a mini office for the Chief have been put together. ADLER Got a spot on 'em. A store right outside of Benhur. About 20 miles from here. Adler sets down the mike, sticks a tack on the map and stands back. RED All right. Push the roadblock on 288 north by 50 miles. Kaiser calls in the instructions. (NOTE:   Kaiser's radio transmissions are not scripted but go on a lot of the time we're in the Airstream. In addition, his  and Adler's direc- tions and missives to Bradley in the truck are not all scripted.)

It's a high speed Sunday drive to them. ADLER Sunday drive. I like that. Never heard you use that one before, Red. Sally is watching Red and listening to all of this with a troubled look on her face. Red notices... \nRED Somethin' eatin' at you? SALLY It's... perhaps premature, but do you have an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up? Everyone stares.    No one ever questions Red. ADLER What makes you so sure they won't stay together? Sally hesitates.    Red notices... RED You got somethin' to say, spit it out. SALLY Their situation is one of accommodation. They won't be together long. Silence.   Sally continues. SALLY Haynes and Pugh are opposites. Haynes is a criminal's criminal -- armed robbery, mano y mano confrontation. Pugh, on the other hand, has a rap sheet littered with molestation and petty crime. They'll split sheets soon. ADLER (still on attack) What about the hostages? They gonna' flip a coin to see who gets to keep who? Red rises and walks to the sink.      He rinses a spoon.

(beat) That's why we should address it now. She looks to Red.   He refuses to return her gaze. RED We don't have a dilemma. And neither do they. They'll keep one hostage... and get rid of one, if they haven't already. SALLY Okay... which one? \nRED If there's a SNAFU, who's John Q. Public more likely to give a rat's ass about -- an innocent boy or a goddam bureaucrat. Red wipes the water off the spoon on his shirt and walks to his office in the back.

MOTOR HOME - BACK OFFICE                                59 Red sits in his office chair, pulls out the spoon and pours Geritol from a bottle into his coffee. He doesn't even look up when Sally enters, a stern look on her face. SALLY We need to talk, Chief Garnett. RED Call me Red. SALLY Red. (beat) Why are you so hell-bent on embarassing me? RED I'm hell-bent on one thing. You hang around long enough you'll find that out. Til' then a tough backside and a sense of humor will get you through a lot. SALLY I have a fine sense of humor, but the one thing I won't do is be your straight man so you can play hero to a bunch of morons who think you're some kind of hillbilly Sherlock Holmes.

Arthur Godfrey says it keeps ya' young, but I'm not sure it's worth it. SALLY I'd like an answer. RED This yer' first time out of an office? She refuses to answer. RED Thought so.   What'd ya' expect ya' signed on for? Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser all watch the discussion, smiles on their faces. Sally abruptly closes the door. SALLY You think I'm what? Some dumb schoolgirl who wandered into the boy's locker room? Well you're wrong. I don't mean to boast, but I happen to be one of the two most intelligent people involved in this fiasco. RED Didn't ask that.    Asked what you expected. SALLY I expected to be allowed to do the job assigned to me by the Governor. RED I happen to like the Governor, hunt quail together every year. But deep down he and I know that win, lose or draw this is my ship, not his. SALLY The Governor as chief executive officer of this state bears ultimate responsibility for... RED ... Bullshit. Responsibility lies with the one that loses sleep; the one with the most ulcers. This mess turns bloody -- and it might -- all it's gonna cost the Governor is a few votes! Me, I'm the one that's...

Sally softens her stance. SALLY You're the one that what? But Red side-steps. RED Tell ya' what. You think I'm makin' a wrong turn you speak up. Might not agree, but I'll listen. As far as stepped on toes and wounded pride, I'll buy everyone a drink when we head for home. Not until. I got more to worry about. (beat) That sound fair to you? SALLY Yes. RED Well okay then. Sally turns, about to leave. RED So who's the other one? SALLY Other one? RED If yer' one brain, who's the other? SALLY Haynes.    He was tested in prison. 60   INT.

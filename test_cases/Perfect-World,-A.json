{"train": "A PERFECT WORLD \nWritten by \nJOHN LEE HANCOCK \nDecember 1992 Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \n1   MUSIC UP. It's a tad eerie. If a Zydeco band died in a     1 bus crash this is the kind of music they'd play in heaven. FADE IN ON: WHITE SCREEN which transforms to a milky white and eventually into a bright high noon sun. A large black bird flies in circles overhead. As it wipes the sun a bright flare causes... CLOSEUP - PAIR OF EYES to squint, then adjust to the light and finally open.    They look tired, but content, maybe even relaxed. CLOSEUP - MAN \nthe owner of the eyes. Though we only see from his shoulders to the top of his head, we can tell he's lying in a field. His arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears to be resting comfortably. MUFFLED VOICES and WHISPERS fill the air but they seem to come from another place. The man doesn't notice them. His name is BUTCH. A gust of wind blows Butch's hair a bit and a piece of straw wipes across his forehead. Then, oddly enough, it is followed by a dollar bill, which rests against his cheek, then skitters across his face. It is followed by another and another, a five, a ten, a single. Butch pays no attention. He's in another world. DISSOLVE TO: 2   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MADISONVILLE, TX. - DUSK                 2 SUPERSCRIPT:    OCTOBER, 1963. A small country town. Normally quiet at this hour, the street is tonight alive with trick or treaters dressed as witches, goblins and superheroes making their annual door to door rounds. 3   EXT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                     3 GLADYS PERRY, 30 going on 45 due to single motherhood and having worked two fulltime minimum wage jobs the past ten years, looks out the window with disgust and pulls the curtains closed. 4   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                     4 Gladys retreats   from the sparsly decorated living room to the predictably drab   linoleum kitchen. At the table, hands on their laps, sit   her children, NAOMI and RUTH, twin girls aged 10, and PHILLIP,   a quiet boy of 8. (CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:                                                    4 Gladys sets a casserole on the table and goes to the frig for a container of milk. The children WHISPER to one another... NAOMI Judy Baumer is going as a twirler. RUTH But she's so fat.     I'd go as Cinderella... or Peter Pan. NAOMI Peter Pan's a boy. Tinker Bell's a girl. Phillip could go as Peter Pan... 'cept you gotta' fly. \n10    EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                          10 Superman lofts a BALLOON and grabs another as the first hits the door of the Perry house and SPLATTERS. SUPERMAN Bombs away! Dancing Skeleton does his best Warren Spahn and tosses a wet fastball at the door. SKELETON Here's your trick! At the window, Phillip, his nose pressed to the pane, stares expressionless at the onslaught. He barely flinches as a BALLOON SPLATS only inches away. Gladys arrives and pulls the curtains shut once more. 11A   EXT. PRISON - NIGHT                                         11A Butch kicks the top off a ventilator shaft and rolls onto the roof. Jerry follows as Butch shimmies to the wall. At the edge, Butch and Jerry survey the yard as a searchlight routinely bathes the walls in a circle of light. 11B   THEIR POV - GREEN IMPALA                                    11B parked almost directly below them, next to the Administration office of the prison. JERRY You'n'me must be livin' right, Butchie boy! BUTCH Let's get something straight. I don't like you. As soon as we're on our way, that's it. JERRY Who said I liked you? Butch slides down and hangs from the ledge before dropping on the roof of the building below. 12    INT. ADMIN OFFICE - NIGHT                                   12 A SOFT THUD causes a Guard to look up, but only momentarily as he spots Larry departing, files in hand, waving goodbye. GUARD Have a safe trip now, Larry. \n13    EXT. YARD - NIGHT                                          13 Just as Larry reaches the Impala, Butch and Jerry leap down and land on him. The spotlight showers them in a flash of light as it passes by. Butch cups his hand over Larry's mouth while Jerry reaches into his jacket -- Bingo -- a shiny .38. BUTCH (to Larry) Keep yer' mouth shut. JERRY (to Larry) Gawd I'd love to blow yer' head off. \n14    EXT. PRISON GATE - NIGHT                                        14 Larry, driving with his eyes straight ahead, stops at the gate and waves a palm at the Guard, who opens without hesitation. GUARD 'Night, Larry. 15    INT. CAR - FLOORBOARD - NIGHT                                   15 stuffed and hidden half on the floor and half under the mats are Jerry and Butch. JERRY 'Night, Larry. 16    OMITTED                                                         16 16A   INT. SMALL, WELL-LIT DINER - NIGHT                              16A A weathered finger drops a quarter in a jukebox. \nMAN (O.S.) B-5.   Haven't heard that one in awhile. The woman, MAE, 45, a dog-tired waitress, punches in the numbers and returns to her post behind the counter. A lonesome HANK WILLIAMS tune pours forth. MAE Not since last night.     How's the pie? RED GARNETT, 60, a grizzled but handsome Texas Ranger, sits at the counter slowly chewing. RED Kinda rubbery.   It was better yesterday. (CONTINUED) \n16A   CONTINUED:                                                     16A MAE Same pie as yesterday. Not much call for rhubarb. Sell one slice a day. In the background we hear a SIREN. Red turns and watches a police patrol car whiz past, lights on. MAE Yer off duty. Tell me, if I stopped bakin' 'em would you still come by every night? Red, preoccupied, takes another rubbery bite. RED I don't know. \nMae smiles and turns her back to Red as she cleans the grill. MAE Naw, Red Garnett, you don't come in here for the coffee and pie. You come in here for the company. To see me. Another patrol car races past.   Red's eyes follow it. \n16B   ANGLE ON MAE                                                   16B MAE Now that I've said that, I'll go   one better. What say I cook you dinner at my   place sometime? Steaks, baked taters,    cold beer, the works. Well?... I'm askin'    you out. She turns to face Red but he's gone. A coupla dollars lie next to the half-eaten pie. All she can do is sigh. \n16C   INT./EXT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT                                   16C Red pulls up in front of a small house in a residential section of town. Police cars are everywhere and several officers are behind their vehicles, guns pointed at the house. Red steps out of the car and is greeted by a POLICE SERGEANT, about the same age as Red. SERGEANT Long time, no see. What are you doin' here, Chief? RED Couldn't sleep.   Whattaya got? (CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:                                                     17 Jerry skims through a girly magazine, turning the pages with the gun. Butch, wearing Larry's plaid jacket, jimmies open the cash register. He looks to the floor then to... Jerry, who catches Butch's gaze, holds it, looks down at the floor, then, smiling, looks back to Butch. He returns to the skin mag. Butch holds his stare at Jerry then, in one move, grabs a wad of cash and hops over the counter and out of the store. Jerry notices Butch leaving, grabs a handful of assorted Brach's candies and hurries after. \nJERRY Hey, wait up! Jerry's feet scurry through a pool of blood and past a quivering hand. 18   INT. D.P.S. - TEXAS RANGERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT               18 It's very late, after midnight, and only a handful of people, half of whom are cleanup crews, shuffle through the offices. A light from an office at the end of the hall catches our eye. A MUFFLED  VOICE over the phone... RED (V.O.) I understan' your concern, Johnny. 19   INT. RED'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                      19 Red, behind a huge    ranchstyle desk covered with files and paper, sips coffee    with one hand, works a buffalo nickel through magician's    paces with the other and balances the phone receiver in    the crook of his neck. RED (on phone) Cons are creatures o' habit. Like old coyotes, they'll crawl back into familiar holes. Uh huh... Yeah... Sure yer' right. Listen you go back to bed and I'll call you in the A.M. with an update. I'll have the files by then. Say hullo to the Mrs.. Red sighs, puts the PHONE back in the hook and stares at it until it RINGS again. 20   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT (JUST BEFORE DAWN)                    20 The CLANGING wind up alarm CLOCK reads 5:30 and Gladys opens her eyes and gently quiets it with a touch. She groans and rises, not happy but used to the daily ritual required of her. \n21   INT. PERRY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                 21 As the kitchen light comes on we see that the couch has been opened up to a bed in which all three children sleep. The twins sleep soundly but Phillip tosses and turns away from the light. 22   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                      22 The Impala creeps through the previously seen neighborhood without its lights. 23   INT. IMPALA - NIGHT                                            23 Butch drives while Jerry scours the block. JERRY There's a Buick. BUTCH Don't want a Buick. Want a Ford. JERRY Ford's leak oil.     A car's a car. Butch puts on the brakes and brings the car to a stop. BUTCH Then take the Buick. JERRY Soon as we cross state line I'll do just that. (beat) I'm tired of riding around. I'll check down the block... for a Ford! Jerry gets out, slams the door, lights a cigarette and walks away. Butch waits a few seconds, quietly turns the key one notch and checks the gas ggauge. It reads almost empty. He taps it with his finger but it doesn't budge. He sighs, looks up and sees... JERRY as he checks one locked car, then feeling eyes on his back, turns, looks at Butch, grins and disappears around a corner. BUTCH discreetly exits the car himself, carefully closing the door without a sound. 24   INT. PERRY KITCHEN - NIGHT                               24 Gladys steps into a slip and snaps her bra while cracking eggs into a skillet. By rote she salts, stirs, and pops bread into the toaster. \n25    EXT. PERRY BACKYARD - SOMEONE'S POV - NIGHT                  25 FROM BEHIND a fence, THROUGH the opened, screened windows we see Gladys at work. Phillip enters, dressed in cotton briefs and a T-shirt, drags a chair from the kitchen table by the window and assists his mother by buttering the toast. POV MOVES CLOSER. GLADYS Thank you, Phillip. Go wake up your sisters. Phillip dutifully steps down and returns to the living room. Gladys works to adjust her slip, then grabs plates and silverware and takes them to the table. \nJERRY I take mine fried. 26    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         26 Gladys gasps at Jerry's face pressed against the screen, but controls herself when he brandishes the pistol. He motions for her to open the back door. She does. He slides into the room and sits down at the table. 27    EXT. ON STREET - NIGHT                                       27 A Ford sits in a driveway. In the far b.g. a back porch light glares. Butch ENTERS FRAME, looks at the light, turns to the Ford and starts to jimmie the lock. No luck. He rises and looks to the light. 28    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         28 Jerry stuffs a piece of toast in his mouth, grins at Gladys and makes a motion to the counter. JERRY A lil' on the bland side.   Gimme' that ketchup. She picks up a bottle of Heinz and inches toward him. When she gets close, he grabs her and forces her onto his lap. He holds the gun to her throat and whispers in her ear. JERRY Don't got a man around here, do ya'? 29A   INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                29A MR. CUMMINGS, 70, puts on his glasses and peers through the window. \n29B   HIS POV - PERRY KITCHEN                                        29B Gladys sits on Jerry's lap, thanks to .38 caliber coercion. The convict's hands move freely over the frightened woman's body. 30    INT. PERRY KITCHEN - NIGHT                               30 JERRY Feed me, sweet thing. Her shaking hands raise a forkful of eggs to his lips.    He licks them once then gobbles with gusto. Phillip enters the room and stops dead in his tracks. JERRY Well lookie here, you do got a man! Jerry smiles at Phillip while he kisses and licks Glady's neck. At once, Phillip darts across the room at Jerry, who backhands the boy with his gunhand, sending Phillip sprawling. Butch blasts through the door in an instant. With a swift kick to the head, Jerry is knocked senseless onto the floor against the cabinets. The gun slides across the floor and lands at Phillip's feet. JERRY (holding his ear) I'm bleedin'! You happy? Butch gives Jerry an icy stare and kneels down to eye level with Phillip. Butch looks at the gun and then at Phillip. BUTCH What's your name, boy? \nPHILLIP (scared shitless) Ph...   Phillip... BUTCH Well, okay Phillip. Reach down and pick up that pistola. JERRY Give it to me. BUTCH (to Jerry) Shut yer' mouth. (to Phillip) Pick it up and bring it over here. (CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                                    30 Phillip reaches down and slowly picks up the gun by the handle. He takes one step toward Butch, then another. Gladys, petrified, sobs. Phillip arrives armslength from Butch. CLOSEUPS - PHILLIP AND BUTCH BUTCH Now say 'stick 'em up.' PHILLIP (hesitant) Stick 'em up... \nRED Adler...    what is this? Adler searches the messy desk for something. ADLER Rings a bell, Red. Believ' they sent us something about her this mornin'... RED Who sent?... ADLER ... Guvner', Red. Adler finds the telex message sheet he's looking for and hands it to Red. (CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 34 ADLER ... Here it is. SALLY (introducing) Uh, I'm Sally Gerber. Criminologist with the State Prison System. Sally offers her hand. Red, perusing the telex, ignores but Adler shakes somewhat reluctantly, not sure if he's supposed to like her or not. ADLER Tom Adler.   Deputy. State Police... System. \nSALLY It's a relatively new procedure but I was assigned by Governor Connally... RED (reading from telex) ... 'to work with State law enforcement officials in all affairs where penal matters coincide with those of the State Police.' It don't say nuthin' about... SALLY ... It includes parole and work release programs as well as penal escape situations. The office PHONE BUZZES.    Adler picks it up. ADLER (into phone) On our way, Marge. \nAdler hangs up the phone. ADLER Gettin' antsy, Red. You scheduled it. Adler hangs up, grabs Red's tie and coat from a brass rung on the wall and hands them over. Red puts down the telex, stares at Sally and reluctantly attempts to make himself presentable. SALLY The idea is that an understanding of the particular behavioral case histories should, in parole situations, help the subject to avoid habitual traps and, in penal escape situations could, conversely, identify those self-same traps as an aide to apprehension. (CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:   (4)                                              34 Adler stares at Sally then turns to Red with a \"never heard the like\" look of amazement on his face. Red, roguishly handsome in his tan, western cut blazer, clip on tie and ten gallon hat, makes his way to the door. But, before he exits... RED In the first place, Miss Gerber. SALLY Sally, please. RED In the first place, Sally, it ain't a 'penal escape situation.' It's a manhunt. Fancy words in a circle don't help much. SALLY And what does? RED A nose like a Blue Tick, a medulla with an antenna and one helluva lot of coffee. And with that he's out the door. 35   INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY                                         35 A throng of photogs and news writers stuff the undersized room. The clamor settles when Red enters and steps behind the lectern. RED Listen up, I'll only say it once. At approximately ten o'clock last night two inmates over to Huntsville, Robert 'Butch' Haynes and Jerry David Pugh, escaped through an air shaft, grabbed a prison employee's car and got out through the main gate. At approximately 1 A.M. we believe they robbed a market outside of Cut-n-Shoot and killed the store's owner. REPORTER #1 Is the prison employee with them? RED Was when they left the prison. Sally and Adler enter the room and stand beside the lectern observing. Red notices them. (CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:                                                     35 REPORTER #2 What's the rap sheet on these guys like? RED Long as Christmas eve to a kid. Haynes was doin' 40 for armed robbery and Pugh was ridin' 20 hisself for manslaughter and assorted parole vios. REPORTER #3 Is there any indication of... RED ... Lemme' finish, Billy. This mornin' another hostage was taken... from a private home in Madisonville. A boy, age 8. Grabbed him out of bed. REPORTER #1 Any sex offenses on Haynes or Pugh? RED Yer' askin' if they're preverts.   Well, one is. REPORTER #4 You got inter-agency cooperation on this? RED Texas Rangers as the criminal investigation arm of the D.P.S. share responsibility with the F.B.I. due to the kid being taken. But I doubt they're out of bed yet. A few chuckles. \nREPORTER #3 Red, how do you plan to apprehend the escapees? RED Officially I can only say we have a full manhunt team on their trail and we'll proceed with due haste. REPORTER #3 And unofficially? Red hesitates a moment, something's bothering him, then blurts out... RED Unoffically? I'm gonna' hunt 'em like the rabid dogs they are. (CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                35 Every hand in the place shoots up and Ad Lib questions fly like bullets. RED That's all I've got but I'd like to introduce ya' to Miss Sally Gerber. She's straight from the Governor's office. Knows all about psychological profiles and the like. You probably have some questions for her. Red steps back and to one side. Sally is taken aback but then warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off a bit, but.... \n40   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                40 Adler moves through the door to the RV carrying Red's favorite desk chair. He's followed by BOBBY LEE, 20's, cocksure, wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots. ADLER (to Saunders) S'cuse me. (to Red) This here's Bobby Lee. He's a specialist with the Feds. They want him to tag along. Red stares hard at Bobby Lee, then nods.   Bobby Lee steps into the Airstream. SAUNDERS Please, Red, ya' gotta' believe me... Red spots Suttle, 35, bright-eyed, with a cowlick, sitting at the wheel of the Chevy truck. RED Who are you? SUTTLE Dick Suttle, the driver. RED Not anymore.   Bradley. BRADLEY, 35, glasses, moves to the truck and gets in. Suttle shrugs and steps out. Saunders stops Suttle and turns to Red. SAUNDERS This man stays with the vehicle wherever it goes, Red! RED (to Suttle) You know how to operate the gadgets? SUTTLE Yessir. RED (to Suttle) Grab a seat. Suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck. Sally emerges from the building, ticked off, carrying an armload of file boxes, and makes a beeline for Red. Saunders gently touches Red's shoulders; a final plea. (CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:   (3)                                               40 SAUNDERS Please Red, I'm beggin'. I mean, what am I suppose to tell the Governor? Sally arrives but before she can spit out a word... RED Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked me out on it. Red whistles and the ENGINE REVS. Red closes the door as the motor home pulls away. Saunders runs beside the passenger side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window. SAUNDERS Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle? Not a scratch! Saunders stops, breathing hard, next to Sally.   She's pissed and overloaded with files. AIRSTREAM about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop.    A second later the door opens and the steps pop out. Sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door... ... LAUGHTER filters out of the Airstream.   The Airstream moves another 20 feet then stops. Sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute. Again, when she gets close... \n...the Airstream moves. Sally, boiling mad as her coiffure wilts in the Texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box in anger. The Airstream stops. LAUGHTER from inside and a   few AD LIBS, i.e. -- \"Okay, Okay.\" More LAUGHTER. Red steps    out the door, turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and  comments stop on a dime. Smiling slightly he turns to Sally,   moves straight for the file box, picks it up and walks back to  the Airstream. When he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to  Sally, who stews and holds her ground. RED You comin' or not? She hesitates only a moment before walking straight to Red, grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him. \n41   OMITTED                                                          41 42   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                             42 Sally enters, balancing the   boxes, and glares at the faces surrounding her. A smiling    Red, a grinning Adler messily gorging on a cinnamon roll,   a nervous KAISER, the radio man, and, in the corner, a nasty   smirk from Bobby Lee. When the Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and drops one of the boxes. Adler and Suttle jump forward to help but she gives them the evil eye. SALLY I've got it. She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her.     She looks up to the men staring at... Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh. She calmly stands and looks to Adler, a piece of cinnamon roll dangling on his chin. SALLY You've got shit on your face. Red can't help but smile as Adler wipes at his face. 43   EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                            43 The IMPALA BLASTS along, kicking up dust and dispersing crows as it heads into a one light township. It slows, however, before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay phone booth. 44   INT./EXT. IMPALA - DAY                                           44 JERRY Why the hell we stoppin'? BUTCH You said you had a cousin near here. JERRY So? BUTCH So give him a call. See if we can shack there til' things cool down. Jerry thinks it over, leans forward and, in one quick swipe, grabs the keys from the ignition. Then he laughs and crawls out on his way to the phone booth. (CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED:                                                   44 In the b.g. we see Jerry strut to the phone booth and pore through a thin directory. Phillip steals a glance at Butch, who watches his rear view mirror and grits his teeth. PHILLIP Why'd he take the keys? BUTCH So I won't leave him. PHILLIP (a tad hopeful) Would you leave him? BUTCH Oh yeah. In the b.g. Jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and returns to the car, half pleased with himself. He tosses the keys to Butch, who starts the car and drives off. JERRY Musta' moved. Prolly' couldn't have heard 'em anyway. Goddam ear's still bleedin'. You ever try that shit again... BUTCH What? JERRY What? BUTCH You were in the middle of threatenin' me. JERRY (from the movies) Ain't a threat. It's a fact. Butch reaches over, takes Phillip's hand and places it on the steering wheel. BUTCH Here kid, take the wheel. Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight. Butch turns back over the seat to confront Jerry. BUTCH In two seconds I'm gonna' break your nose. That's a threat...

Blood spurts from Jerry's nose and the injured man cups his hands over the wound. Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip. BUTCH ... And that's a fact. Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the seat wearing a look of pure hatred. JERRY I'm gonna' kill you for that. \nBUTCH And that's a threat. Beginnin' to understand the difference? Somethin' catches Butch's eye and he turns and slows down and turns into... 45   EXT. RURAL STORE - DAY                                       45 The Impala brakes to a dusty stop near the front of the store, which is bordered by a giant hay field. 46   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                      46 BUTCH Okay, Phillip, listen up. I'm gonna' run in here and get some smokes. JERRY Get beer. \nButch hands Phillip the revolver. BUTCH Here, hold it like this.... And point it right between his eyes. JERRY What the hell?... BUTCH (to Phillip) If he so much as moves you pull the trigger ... right here... Put your finger on it. Jerry snickers and then laughs maniacally. Butch reaches over and cocks the pistol. Jerry's guffaws stop on a dime. JERRY Yer' a fuckin' crazy man. (CONTINUED) \nBUTCH Then go inside and lie down til' we're gone. The Old Man meekly does so. Butch goes to the car door, opens it and motions to a frozen stiff Phillip. BUTCH Well... Get in. 57   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                            57 The truck and Airstream barrel down the highway. 58   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                          58 The place is a functioning mobile headquarters now. Adler on the short wave and tacking up a map, Bobby Lee still in his corner, Red and Sally sitting across from one another at the \"kitchen table\". \nIn the rear section of the Airstream Red's chair and a mini office for the Chief have been put together. ADLER Got a spot on 'em. A store right outside of Benhur. About 20 miles from here. Adler sets down the mike, sticks a tack on the map and stands back. RED All right. Push the roadblock on 288 north by 50 miles. Kaiser calls in the instructions. (NOTE:   Kaiser's radio transmissions are not scripted but go on a lot of the time we're in the Airstream. In addition, his  and Adler's direc- tions and missives to Bradley in the truck are not all scripted.) (CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:                                                       58 ADLER Ya' figger' they're that far along? RED Hell, I dunno'and neither do they. They're jus' happy to be out. It's a high speed Sunday drive to them. ADLER Sunday drive. I like that. Never heard you use that one before, Red. Sally is watching Red and listening to all of this with a troubled look on her face. Red notices... \nRED Somethin' eatin' at you? SALLY It's... perhaps premature, but do you have an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up? Everyone stares.    No one ever questions Red. ADLER What makes you so sure they won't stay together? Sally hesitates.    Red notices... RED You got somethin' to say, spit it out. SALLY Their situation is one of accommodation. They won't be together long. Silence.   Sally continues. SALLY Haynes and Pugh are opposites. Haynes is a criminal's criminal -- armed robbery, mano y mano confrontation. Pugh, on the other hand, has a rap sheet littered with molestation and petty crime. They'll split sheets soon. ADLER (still on attack) What about the hostages? They gonna' flip a coin to see who gets to keep who? Red rises and walks to the sink.      He rinses a spoon. (CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             58 SALLY It's happened before. Either way it's a dilemma they'll address soon. (beat) That's why we should address it now. She looks to Red.   He refuses to return her gaze. RED We don't have a dilemma. And neither do they. They'll keep one hostage... and get rid of one, if they haven't already. SALLY Okay... which one? \nRED If there's a SNAFU, who's John Q. Public more likely to give a rat's ass about -- an innocent boy or a goddam bureaucrat. Red wipes the water off the spoon on his shirt and walks to his office in the back. Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser chuckle lightly at their boss's snubbing of the female upstart in their midst. Sally's face glows a bright red. 59   INT. MOTOR HOME - BACK OFFICE                                59 Red sits in his office chair, pulls out the spoon and pours Geritol from a bottle into his coffee. He doesn't even look up when Sally enters, a stern look on her face. SALLY We need to talk, Chief Garnett. RED Call me Red. SALLY Red. (beat) Why are you so hell-bent on embarassing me? RED I'm hell-bent on one thing. You hang around long enough you'll find that out. Til' then a tough backside and a sense of humor will get you through a lot. SALLY I have a fine sense of humor, but the one thing I won't do is be your straight man so you can play hero to a bunch of morons who think you're some kind of hillbilly Sherlock Holmes. (CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED:                                                     59 Red sips from the mug calmly then groans, his face contorted. RED Awful. Arthur Godfrey says it keeps ya' young, but I'm not sure it's worth it. SALLY I'd like an answer. RED This yer' first time out of an office? She refuses to answer. RED Thought so.   What'd ya' expect ya' signed on for? Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser all watch the discussion, smiles on their faces. Sally abruptly closes the door. SALLY You think I'm what? Some dumb schoolgirl who wandered into the boy's locker room? Well you're wrong. I don't mean to boast, but I happen to be one of the two most intelligent people involved in this fiasco. RED Didn't ask that.    Asked what you expected. SALLY I expected to be allowed to do the job assigned to me by the Governor. RED I happen to like the Governor, hunt quail together every year. But deep down he and I know that win, lose or draw this is my ship, not his. SALLY The Governor as chief executive officer of this state bears ultimate responsibility for... RED ... Bullshit. Responsibility lies with the one that loses sleep; the one with the most ulcers. This mess turns bloody -- and it might -- all it's gonna cost the Governor is a few votes! Me, I'm the one that's... (CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               59 Red catches himself about to get too personal. He takes another swig of his coffee/geritol. Sally softens her stance. SALLY You're the one that what? But Red side-steps. RED Tell ya' what. You think I'm makin' a wrong turn you speak up. Might not agree, but I'll listen. As far as stepped on toes and wounded pride, I'll buy everyone a drink when we head for home. Not until. I got more to worry about. (beat) That sound fair to you? SALLY Yes. RED Well okay then. Sally turns, about to leave. RED So who's the other one? SALLY Other one? RED If yer' one brain, who's the other? SALLY Haynes.    He was tested in prison. 60   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                        60 Butch drives and catches an occasional glance at Phillip who sits quietly, but who, too, steals looks at his captor between swigs of RC Cola. He finishes off the bottle. Butch reaches in the sack for another, pops the top on the dashboard and hands it to Phillip. PHILLIP Thankyew. (beat) Are you gonna' shoot me? BUTCH No.    Me'n you are friends. (CONTINUED) \nBUTCH See there! All you gotta' do is say your name and people are waiting on you hand and foot. Like a goddam king or somethin'. Phillip can't help but smile at the notion. 75   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                               75 Bradley and Suttle lean against the parked RV, chatting. BRADLEY You responsible for engine maintenance on this thing? SUTTLE Uh, yeah.     I'm the full time driver. (CONTINUED) \n75    CONTINUED:                                                     75 Bradley shakes his head.   \"Too bad\". SUTTLE What?   Why? BRADLEY You notice how it keeps    wanting to slip a bit goin' into second.     Feels to me like somebody's been a little    heavy-footed with the clutch. (beat) I'd take care of that if   I was you. PAN TO: an ambulance door opens and the Farmer, strapped in, is rolled toward it as his wife, sobbing, attends to him. \nSeveral local police scour the surrounding field, walking four feet apart, looking for what they hope they won't find. Red leans on the trunk of the Impala, chews and spits on the ground. He sniffs the air. Unsavory. Adler strides up from the field. ADLER No bodies this time, thank Gawd. RED You got the keys to this thing? ADLER Uh... naw... RED Get me a crowbar. (to Sally) You might wanna' wait in the boat. \nSALLY No thank you. 76A   INT. TRUNK - DAY                                               76A But it's black as night. A   CROWBAR CRANKS at the lock until the trunk blasts open like a  bottletop. A blast of light gives way to the silhouetted  faces of Red, Adler and Sally, who turns and walks away in  nauseous disgust. RED Well.... THEIR POV - OPEN TRUNK In it lies the crumpled, bent, bloody remains of Larry, the prison employee, the original hostage. RED ... there's our bureaucrat. \n76B   RED                                                            76B spits a chaw, turns and walks to the RV.    Near the entrance Sally is heaving. RED (to no one in particular) It's sure nice to know the boy's in good hands. Sally straightens herself, ready to bite back, but Red's face is soft. He offers a handkerchief. She takes it. RED Gallows humor, Sally.    Without it we'd all be heavin'. \n77    EXT. SMALL TOWN (NOODLE, TEXAS) - DAY                          77 The Ford slides down the Main Street and into a side alley next to a Department Store. 78    INT. FORD - DAY                                                78 BUTCH You ready to get out of those skivvies and into some britches? Phillip nods. BUTCH Well all right then. But first we gotta' come up with some A.K.A.'s, fake identities, ya' know. Names to call each other when we're around other folks. (beat) Go ahead and think one up. Whatever name you want. \nPhillip is amused by the sport of it all. PHILLIP Any name I want? 79    EXT. STORE FRONT - ESTABLISHING - DAY                          79 A small time Dry Goods store with a sign over the entrance proclaiming: \"FRIENDLY'S - The Friendliest Store in Texas!\" 80    INT. FRIENDLY'S - DAY                                          80 A small, well-organized country dry goods store with a dozen or so aisles carrying everything from DDT to used boots. (CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED:                                                       80 A long counter at the front of the store is backed by a small office with a large glass window that gives the Manager, MR. WILLITS, 45, bespectacled, anal-retentive, a clear view of the store. A nuclear family with two kids exits the store just as Butch and Phillip enter. Butch holds the door open and smiles at them. They say \"thanks\" but can't help but notice Phillip, cowering behind Butch, still clad in his underwear. He hides behind a nearby display which reads: Cast Your Vote For Friendly's Friendliest Clerk! A clerk, LUCY, 30, holding a handful of shoeboxes notices their entrance. She's schoolmarmish with a smile that looks like it's painted on. LUCY Well, hello there and welcome to Friendly's. Looks like the little fella' needs some pants. BUTCH As a matter of fact. Shoes and new skivvies, too. He'll tell you his size. Go with the lady, Buzz. Phillip, still in somewhat of a daze, doesn't recognize his own \"name\". BUTCH Buzz! Phillip snaps to, cracks a smile at Butch and follows the lady to the children's section of the store. LUCY Buzz, what a cute name.   Like a bee. BUTCH \nAdler takes the urgent message off the radio and turns to the group... ADLER They've got him penned down in Noodle, north of Abilene. 86   INT. FRIENDLY'S - AT COUNTER - DAY                              86 Paula bags the items, including the jeans. CLOSEUP - WILLITS staring straight at Butch. CLOSEUP - BUTCH shakes his head at Willits -- \"Don't even think about it\". (CONTINUED) \n86    CONTINUED:                                                   86 PHILLIP walks toward the front door but stops short when he sees, once again, the Halloween display. BUTCH pays Paula, then stuffs a $20 in her blouse. BUTCH You are truly the friendliest clerk I ever met. She blushes a \"thank you\" as Butch makes a hasty retreat to the door. PAULA (an afterthought) Thank you for shopping Friendly's! 87    EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY                                       87 Butch exits the store, spots the blackandwhites, and slides into the middle of a group of old-timers moving down the sidewalk at a leisurely pace. 88    INT. FRIENDLY'S - DAY                                        88 Phillip stands at the costume display, looks around, then grabs a Casper costume carton, stuffs it under his T-shirt and walks quickly to the door. 89    EXT. SIDE ALLEY - DAY                                        89 Butch slides away from the Old Timers and into the Ford. 90A   INT. FORD - DAY                                              90A \nButch checks the back seat. No Phillip, no Buzz.   He checks the rear view mirror and sees... 90B   IN REAR-VIEW MIRROR                                          90B Pete, his cherry top spinning, pulls in behind Butch, blocking his entrance to the main street. 91    EXT. SIDE ALLEY - DAY                                        91 Butch throws the Ford into reverse and steps on the gas. Pete not expecxting this kind of pace, at least not from the get-go, leaps into his back seat. The Ford rams into the black and white pushing it backward into a lightpole and a truck. The TRUCK'S OWNER, carrying mulch from the feed store, watches as his truck slides toward him. (CONTINUED) \n91   CONTINUED:                                                     91 TRUCK OWNER Dammit, Pete!!! 92   EXT. FRIENDLY'S - DAY                                          92 Phillip steps out the door.    He spots the crash and watches as... The Ford blasts back into the alley in a hail of dust. 93   INT. FORD - DAY                                                93 Butch, driving like a maniac, turns into the back alley and steps on it. All at once he mashes on the BRAKES and comes to a SQUEALING stop. HIS POV \nThe alley is a dead end. BACK TO SCENE Butch rips the CAR into reverse and SQUEALS all the way back to the original side alley. 94   EXT. FRIENDLY'S - DAY                                          94 Phillip stands frozen, scared, not knowing what to do but keeping a look out on the street for the Ford. 95   INT. FRIENDLY'S - DAY                                          95 Lucy and Paula peer from behind the counter at Phillip and the fracas taking place in the street. LUCY I knew something was wrong from the get-go. \nThey spot Phillip standing a few feet in front of the door. PAULA Look, he left his little boy. LUCY And look, the little rascal has... he's no better than... PAULA What?!... LUCY He's got that Casper costume.   He stole it! 96   EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY                                         96 The FORD emerges from the side alley once more and SQUEALS onto Main Street.

HIS POV - FORD is COMING STRAIGHT FOR him, hell bent on destruction and picking up speed. BACK TO SCENE Terrance sticks his black and white in rapid reverse and backs down the street at 40 mph. PETE (V.O.) (on radio) Get the hell outta' there. We can't lose both vehicles! TERRANCE'S POV - FORD is GAINING ON him -- he can actually SEE Butch's grimaced face -- when suddenly it goes into a dusty fishtail, does a 180, and barrels in the OPPOSITE direction. PHILLIP antsy as hell, stuck, wondering how this whole thing is going to play out. He's suddenly aware of the peering eyes behind him. Lucy bangs on the glass. LUCY (yells) Buzz! You little shit.   Shoplifting is a crime! BUTCH \nchecks his mirror, looks ahead, spots Phillip and blasts straight for the front door of the store. He SKIDS to a halt and stares right at Phillip. BUTCH Up to you, Buzz... PHILLIP He's frozen for a second, his knees knocking, teeth chattering, the works. Lucy appears behind him and the glass door... LUCY (to Phillip) You'll never get away with this, little mister! Phillip dashes to the Ford and makes a swimmer's starting dive into the open passenger window. (CONTINUED) \n102   EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                            102 The four Highway Patrol VEHICLES from before BLAST past at 90+, sending stray dogs and roadrunners scurrying for cover. CRANE    DOWN to reveal the Ford off the same roadside, but behind    a burm in a field. As soon as the patrol cars pass, Butch    STARTS up the ENGINE and humps it to the road and off in the    opposite direction. 103   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                             103 Sally, deep in her files.      She looks up from the file to... ANOTHER ANGLE Bobby Lee who sits by himself, whittling away at a stick and leering at her. Adler is at the map, holding the shortwave mike and wearing the earphones. Behind him, Red stares out the window. ADLER Haynes bought tape, rope, and some clothes for the boy. Red comes to and turns to Adler. Sally smiles almost to her- self. She was right -- Haynes is looking after the boy. Everyone knows it, but no one says anything. ADLER One puzzler though. They say the boy could have gotten away but didn't. SALLY Probably scared to death. ADLER That's not all. The kid stole a Halloween outfit. \nRED Holy Jeezus, they're a team. ADLER With the pit stop in Noodle looks like he's headed for the Panhandle. Red sighs and groans. Unpleasant news but somehow he knew it. He moves to the back room for another shot of Geritol. SALLY (to Red) What? ADLER There's more roads than people in the Panhandle. (CONTINUED) \n103   CONTINUED:                                                     103 SALLY How's that happen? KAISER (over his shoulder) Poor counties. They tend to half finish roads then start on another one. ADLER But if anybody knows them backroads it's Red. Sally lifts her head, watches Red reenter the room, then stares out the window. \nSALLY Okay, so... I'm Robert Haynes. Called Butch by everyone. I was born in Amarillo, but grew up in the French Quarter of New Orleans. ADLER (sotto voce) What's she doin', Red? SALLY I killed a man when I was eight. Silence. Nobody seems willing to play along.    Red turns from the window to Sally. RED How'd ya' kill him? SALLY Shot him with a pistol. There was always one around the dance hall. That's what they called it but it was a whorehouse. We lived there. Red moves away from the discussion and stands at the front of the Airstream, staring out the front window. ADLER What'd the authorities do? SALLY The victim was wanted by the locals so the whole thing got shoved under the carpet Cajun-style. ADLER They didn't even stick him in juvy? (CONTINUED) \n103   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 103 SALLY Put me in school.     Three years behind but I catch up. KAISER Sounds like things are goin' okay' now? SALLY They were.     For awhile.   When I'm twelve mom dies. ADLER What happened? SALLY Delilah Jane Haynes hung herself in the bathroom of the brothel. Could have saved herself the trouble. Post-mortem check uncovered last stage syphilis. KAISER Where's yer' father? Red's face tells us he's listening. SALLY Nobody knows where he is now. Ditched when I was six. He was a small-time felon. Popped up again after Mom died -- he'd just been paroled. Moved us back to Amarillo. A year later I'm in trouble again. ADLER Yeah?     Kill somebody else? SALLY Took a joyride in a Ford coupe that I just couldn't resist. KAISER Hell, that's no big deal. SALLY Judge gave me four years in Gatesville, toughest juvy farm in Texas. ADLER That's where the son-of-a-bitch learned to be a criminal. Seen that before, ain't we, Red? Red doesn't answer.     He seems in a faraway place.

SALLY Where I'm going isn't as important as 'Why am I going there?' BOBBY LEE (tired of the game) Shit. 'Caus' I'm runnin' and they're chasin' and I'd jus' as soon go north as south as east as west. It's a fun lil' parlor game, lady, but right now Butch Haynes don't have the slightest idea where he's headed! 104A INT.

Hold yer' pointin' finger along the line of the road. You got three lines on your finger, don'tcha'? Each one's an inch. So how many inches to Childress? Phillip holds one finger to the map, then another. PHILLIP One, two... six. BUTCH Yer' a helluva' navigator, Phillip. A lot smarter than Jerry. But I guess that's not sayin' a lot. Something catches Phillip's eye. PHILLIP Lookie there! 104B HIS POV - TRUCK AND AIRSTREAM                                  104B coming TOWARD them on the highway. 105   INT.

RED Don't tell 'em that. 112   INT. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE (AUSTIN, TEXAS) - DAY             112 A large group of very serious advisors sit and stand in a circle around the Governor's desk. Across from GOVERNOR CONNALLY sits a nervous, near tears GLADYS PERRY. An AIDE on the telephone, turns to the Governor. AIDE They say the boy looked A-okay. Governor Connally nods, sighs, and reaches hand across the desk and touches Gladys's shoulder. GOVERNOR He'll be fine, Mrs. Perry. This whole nightmare will be over and done with very soon and you'll be home with your boy. I promise. Gladys, distraught, nods. Governor Connally discreetly nods to a photographer in the group while keeping his hand on Gladys's shoulder. A CAMERA'S FLASH causes everyone to blink in reaction. The Governor shakes it off and continues... (CONTINUED) \n112   CONTINUED:                                                      112 GOVERNOR I want you to know that I personally okayed the use of a brand-new high-tech mobile home from which to conduct the manhunt. It's an amazingly futuristic piece of law enforcement equipment. Another FLASH. 113 OMITTED                                                           113 thru                                                                  thru 115A EXT. FIELD - DAY                                                 115A \nThe Airstream, the amazingly futuristic piece of law enforcement equipment sits beat to hell and leaning to one side in the dry pond bed. All the tires are flat and dents and bruises abound. The door tries to open but is stuck. Red applies a boot to it and the whole thing comes off its hinges and flies to the ground. Red exits. He groans and shakes his head when he spots... Bradley and Suttle limping toward him across the field. Red sighs and starts slowly walking in the direction Butch and Phillip headed. 115B INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                             115B Sally, her hair a bird's nest, does her best to collect her files before she sits down, takes a deep breath and glances out the window at Red in the distance. 115C EXT. FIELD - CLOSEUP - RED - DAY                                 115C \nStanding in the middle of the field, staring at the horizon. He sticks a chaw in his mouth without diverting or blinking his eyes. 116   EXT. ROAD - CLOSEUP - BUTCH - DAY                               116 Staring at the horizon. ANOTHER ANGLE Butch sits on the hood of the Ford, which is stopped on an asphalt road which, a few feet farther, turns into dirt and a few feet farther a dirt clod field. (CONTINUED) \n116   CONTINUED:                                                      116 BUTCH Started this road 20 years ago and it still ain't finished. (beat) Appears to me we got a decision to make. Phillip, aka Casper, exits the car and, imitating Butch, leans against the car. BUTCH It's up to you, Phillip. We can backtrack to the highway or we can try it on foot. PHILLIP Where we goin'? \nButch reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a folded postcard. He hands it over to Phillip. INSERT - CARD It's at least 20 years old, crumpled. It unfolds to reveal a beautiful green valley with a snow capped mountain behind it. BACK TO SCENE BUTCH It's Alaska, Phillip. Last of the wild frontier. PHILLIP It's pretty. BUTCH It's beautiful! \nPHILLIP You been there? BUTCH Naw. Just got the one postcard. But anyhoo, back to our present dilemma. You feel like a hike? PHILLIP How far? BUTCH Can't be more'n, oh, say, fifteen hundred miles. Phillip seems a tad apprehensive about the prospect. (CONTINUED) \nThe Airstream is fast becoming a pig sty. Coke bottles, coffee spills, overfull ashtrays, etc. are everywhere. Adler holds the mike and stares at the thumbtacked map. ADLER (into mike) Spur 208 northbound. And 83 at Aspermont coming and going. (to Red) That it? RED Yeah. Adler moves to set down the mike and topples a cup of coffee. It spills on the floor. Suttle grabs a towel to wipe it up but realizing the futility of keeping the Airstream clean, he simply throws it aside. \n127   INT. FORD - LATER - DAY                                        127 Butch drives while Phillip digs through the sack and comes up with a jar of mustard. BUTCH You sure there's no meat in there? Spam maybe, Vienna sausages, anything like that? PHILLIP Nawsir. BUTCH Well, I bet you can make us some mustard sandwiches, can't ya'? PHILLIP Yeahsir. BUTCH Well go to it. Phillip breaks out the loaf of bread and lays out four slices on the dashboard. PHILLIP How many? BUTCH Many as you want. Phillip   lays out six more slices. The dashboard is now covered   with bread. Phillip pulls out the mustard but has no knife.    Butch pulls out a stick of gum and hands it to Phillip   to spread with. As they drive  along they pass a large, happy family (Mom, Dad, girl 5, boy 7)  picnicking in the dip of a long hill alongside the highway.   From the look of their brand-new loaded down station wagon  they are on vacation. CLOSEUP - PHILLIP Mesmerized by the family. CLOSEUP - BUTCH Ditto.    He pulls his eyes back to the road, notices something. 128   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                128 Butch brings the car to a stop near the crest of the hill, sets the emergency brake, grabs the first completed mustard sandwich and gets out, leaving the Impala running. (CONTINUED) \n128   CONTINUED:                                                      128 BUTCH Be right back. Don't be stingy with that mustard now. Phillip nods and continues piling the yellow goop on each of the slices of bread. BUTCH walks ahead to the crest of the hill, the tallest hill in the county. He takes in the 360 degree view. His eyes settle on... LINE OF CARS \nIDLING as they wait their turn to pass a roadblock at the bottom of the hill. PHILLIP spreading even more mustard. Every so often he sneaks a peek back at the picnicing family. EMERGENCY BRAKE slips a little, then gives all at once. FORD starts to roll backwards. PHILLIP Whooaaa!   Butch!    Butch!!! BUTCH \nturns and sees the Ford rolling backwards, picking up steam back down the hill. BUTCH Step on the brake! Put your foot on the brake! The middle one!! PHILLIP panicked, slides over and grabs the wheel. Of course, he is too short to press on the brake and when he bends down... FORD swerves off the road and onto the shoulder. (CONTINUED) \n128   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                128 FAMILY headed by BOB, 35, their Ward Cleaverish father, looks up to see... FORD barrelling backwards toward them, swerving to and fro and followed by Butch shouting instructions. BOB (O.S.) Everybody, run!    Quick! BOB \nmakes a beeline for the station wagon. BOB'S WIFE Forget the car, Bob! BOB Are you crazy.    It's only got a 1000 miles on it! He jumps in the Driver's seat of the WAGON and frantically REVS it just as... PHILLIP gains control of the wheel and steers the rapidly reversing Ford around the Wagon. FORD continues backwards to the bottom of the hill, but it has enough steam built up to head backwards up the other incline of the previous hill. BUTCH comes to a heaving halt next to Bob, who is near heart attack himself. BUTCH Bad brakes. BOB That was close. Bob gets out of the station wagon and stands next to Butch. They watch for the Ford for a second, see that it's losing momentum and smile at each other. (CONTINUED) \n128   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                  128 BOB Bob Fielder. BUTCH Edgar Poe. PHILLIP breathes a sigh of relief as the Ford loses momentum and comes to a stop. But then, of course, ... FORD like any car on a roller coaster, starts to move downhill, slowly at first, but then picking up speed. \n137   CONTINUED:                                                     137 BOB'S WIFE (to herself) Damn that kid! The little girl is crying harder than ever now. Bob reaches back over the seat and tries to touch his daughter. BOB It's okay, sweetie. Daddy's not mad. BOB'S WIFE So much for the new car smell. The little girl muffles her tears. \nButch smiles sincerely then looks to the passing landscape. BUTCH This will do fine right here, Bob.   But I do have one more favor to ask. 138   EXT. ROAD - DAY (FIVE MINUTES LATER)                           138 The entire Family Bob is standing along the roadside, their luggage and belongings by their side. The looks on their faces say it all -- Stranded. Butch hands over the stuffed animal to Patsy, pats Bob Jr. on the head and sticks out his hand to Bob. BUTCH Just a loaner, Bob. Not to worry.    You'll get her back. Bob reluctantly shakes Butch's hand in an attempt to impress upon Butch his most important concern of all... \nBOB Please, it's new. Hold it under 45... at least for the next 500 miles. BUTCH You know I will, Bob. Butch gives a snappy salute and is off to the wagon. 139   INT. STATION WAGON - DAY                                       139 Butch STARTS the CAR and he and Phillip slowly pull away. BUTCH Wave, Phillip. Phillip does so.   Bob's kids wave back.   Phillip starts to giggle. (CONTINUED) \n139   CONTINUED:                                                     139 PHILLIP They look funny. BUTCH Maybe, but Bob did the right thing. What if he'd put up a fight? I mighta' had to shoot him, and where would that family be then? Naw, Bob's a fine family man and that's about the best thing a fella' can hope to be. Butch floors the wagon and the CAR SCREECHES rubber on the highway. BOB \ncringes as he watches his pride and joy rocket toward the horizon. 140   EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY (LATER)                                   140 The Highway Patrol continues to monitor cars one by one. One of the Officers sees something and nudges his partner to look at... FAMILY BOB cresting the hill carrying their hats in their hands along with their luggage and coolers. 141   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                           141 Adler drops his headphones and turns to Red. ADLER He got through!    At Aspermont. \nBRADLEY What? ADLER Coerced a motorist. Red sighs. RED Well goddam, shout at Amarillo. Tell 'em we got a notion he's headed their way. Adler gets right to it. (CONTINUED) \n141   CONTINUED:                                                       141 RED (almost to himself) Truth is I wish he'd cross the border so we could turn this over to the feds. Nobody in the room expected to hear this. RED I got work to do back home. Red rises and stretches, walks to the open door and stares out at the late afternoon light. RED I'm hungry.   This thing got any food? \nSUTTLE Well, uh... Adler jumps up and goes to the frig. ADLER Got T-bones in the frig, Red! SUTTLE Uh, uh, those were stocked for the Governor. I don't think that he would approve of... Adler finds a plastic bag in the freezer and inspects it. ADLER -- And look, Red!     Tater Tots!   Those kind you like! Red turns and looks. \nA SIRLOIN STEAK hits a grill beside a Tater Tot shiskabob and SIZZLES to beat the band. A homemade barbecue pit, built from nearby abundant rocks, sits square in the middle of the highway with red flares set up just in case a car did come by. Red smiles and shakes a liberal dose of Lea and Perrins onto the flesh. He's obviously a veteran of many back yard B-BQs and this is definitely one. We see Sally THROUGH the window. She's inside, still going over her files. She gets up and walks into the back room to look for something. (CONTINUED) \n146   CONTINUED:                                                      146 BOBBY LEE sitting outside, rises and slides into the Airstream while BACK TO SCENE Red continues to cook with Adler and Bradley looking on. 147   INT. AIRSTREAM - BACKROOM - DUSK                                147 Sally turns on a nightlight and looks at herself in the mirror. She splashes a little water on her face and is startled when ... Bobby Lee slides in behind her. \nBOBBY LEE Think yer' pretty smart now don'tcha'? She doesn't back down, instead looking him straight in the eye. SALLY Excuse me? BOBBY LEE Well yer' not smart but you are pretty. Sally stares right at Bobby Lee then moves for the door.    He shifts his position and blocks her. SALLY Excuse me. Bobby Lee smiles a crooked-tooth grin, refusing to move. BOBBY LEE Work and pleasure should naturally go together don't you think? Take me, I enjoy my work. SALLY I could give a shit. BOBBY LEE You got a mouth, don't ya? RED (O.S.) How you take your steak, Sally? Bobby Lee and Sally both look up to see Red standing in the doorway. (CONTINUED) \n147   CONTINUED:                                                   147 SALLY (relieved) Uh.. rare. RED A woman after my own heart. She takes this opportunity to slide between Red and Bobby Lee on her way into the main room. As she goes... RED I'll just wipe its ass, herd it through and you can cut off a hunk. How'd that be? SALLY Maybe medium-rare. Bobby Lee and Red are left standing face to face. RED I don't give a damn who you work for. You're here for one reason and one reason only. BOBBY LEE Anything else, Chief? RED Yeah.   Yer' in my office. The hot line PHONE RINGS... Bobby Lee flinches first and moves back into the main room. Red follows. ADLER That's the Governor's line, Red! Red calmly walks past Sally who smiles a \"thanks\". He gives her a one finger to the hat salute, walks to the phone, reaches down and yanks out the cord. The RINGING STOPS. RED Nuthin' as impolite as callin' at the dinner hour. 148   INT. DOTTIE'S    CAFE - NIGHT                                148 Phillip, at the booth, plays with the parsley on his empty plate, which sits across from Butch's barely touched one. The boy looks over his shoulder and sneaks a peek at Butch, who sits at a barstool watching Eileen work behind the counter. (CONTINUED) \n148   CONTINUED:                                                    148 AT COUNTER Butch leans over and whispers something sexy into Eileen's ear. She giggles and licks her lips. Butch feels eyes on his back and looks at Phillip, who immediately turns away from them. When Butch returns his attention to Eileen she's moved a few feet away and is refilling ketchup bottles. BUTCH Buzz, go ahead and chew on mine if you want. PHILLIP No thankyew. \nEileen slides back down toward Butch. She makes refilling condiment bottles the sexiest pasttime since the hula hoop. EILEEN Very polite. BUTCH I try hard but, ya' know, since his mama died... PHILLIP -- My mama's not dead! Butch, a tad annoyed, turns to Phillip and gives him a look. Once again, when he turns back, Eileen has moved. She's flirting with Butch, moving, bending, wiping her hands on her hips. His eyes are focused on her every squirm. BUTCH (over his shoulder) Okay now, Buzz, you go on out in the parking lot and chunk some rocks or something. BACK TO SCENE Phillip reluctantly slides down off the stool and slowly walks out the door. His eyes stay on Butch and Eileen, barely concealing confusion mixed with a hint of jealousy. EILEEN So is she dead or not? BUTCH (covering badly) Well his biological mother is alive. Gave him up for adoption to me and my wife. My dead wife, that is. She is, was Phil, er Buzz's stepmother, so she's his mom, was his mom, stepmom, but... she's dead. (CONTINUED) \n148   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                148 EILEEN I'm so sorry. But she's not.     In fact it seems to have turned her on even more. She puts her hand behind Butch's neck and slowly pulls him close for gentle kiss. 149   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                        149 Phillip tosses a rock then turns to the diner. They're gone. Phillip drops his handful of rocks and walks to the front window of the diner. \nPHILLIP'S POV - DINER It is empty. He sees that the kitchen swinging door is still swinging on its hinges. 150   INT. DINER - ADJUNCT OFFICE - NIGHT                             150 A one room addition office built onto    the kitchen. It has a desk against one wall, a few chairs, a    fan -- pretty sparse. Two large windows throw light from the    outside neon sign onto the room. A large lamp provides harsh     light. Eileen leads Butch by the hand into the room, closing the door behind them. At once they are all over each other. Butch lifts her up onto the desk and starts to kiss her face and neck. Then, in an instant, he flips her over, pulls the ribbon from her hair and unzips the back of her waitress outfit to the waist. He kisses her neck, her back and suddenly, passionately, he flips up her skirt and begins kissing her voluptuous backside. \nRed stops, faces Sally. RED I bought the judge a T-bone and told him to send the boy up. Told him it was the right thing to do. He went along right down the line. Red disappears. Sally just stares after him, her face once again soft. 160   INT. STATION WAGON - CLOSEUP - MEMO PAD - NIGHT                160 resting on Phillip's lap. BACK TO SCENE His fingers release it as he drifts to sleep. CLOSEUP - PHILLIP \nasleep, the way a child sleeps.    Soundly. CLOSEUP - BUTCH also asleep, but only his body -- his mind works over- time... DISSOLVE TO: 161   SERIES OF SHOTS - BUTCH'S DREAM                                161 (NOTE: the entire dream is a series of snapshots to a strong Coonass beat) A)   A baby snapshot of Butch. (CONTINUED) \n161   CONTINUED:                                                     161 B)   A Haynes family photo -- a grizzled father standing behind a mother seated holding a baby. They stand in front of a small, white framed house. C)   Extreme closeup -- The baby in the snapshot - Butch. D)   Snapshot of a young Butch, age 6, with his father and another adult male, who are both holding deer rifles with one hand and with the other the antlers and head of a dead deer. E)   Extreme closeup -- Butch's father from the same photo. F)   Snapshot of Butch, 8, with his mother but no father. \nG)   An establishing snapshot of a nightclub in New Orleans. The gaudy sign above the joint reads: CLUB - DANCE HALL. H)   A snapshot of Butch's mother dressed in a somewhat sleazy Latino outfit. She's surrounded by 3 or 4 lounge lizard types, whose hands are all placed on parts of her body. She has a drunken sneer on her face. I)   Snapshot of Butch, 8, being taught to dance in the club by his mother. He looks awkwardly into the camera. J)   Snapshot of Butch, 8, sitting on the bar of the club, surrounded by a motley group of sleazy \"dime dancers\". K)   Another snapshot of Butch being taught to dance by his drunken mother. (NOTE: A heavy MACHINE GROWL should START LOW and INCREASE IN VOLUME through the remainder of these fast-paced series of cuts.) \nL)   Snapshot of Mom dancing very closely, too closely, to a handsy patron of the club. M)   Snapshot of Mom kissing the same man.   We see a tattoo on his arm. N)   Extreme closeup -- the tattoo. It is of a naked girl. The words \"hell-bent\" in cursive frame the tattoo. O)   Snapshot of Mom sitting on the tattooed man's lap at the bar. His hand is resting on the inner portion of her thigh. P)   Snapshot of Butch at the bar with the club bartender. Q)   Same as (K) -- Butch being taught to dance. (CONTINUED) \n161   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 161 R)    Extreme closeup -- Butch in same photo. S)    Same as (J) -- Butch in bar with dime dancers. T)    Extreme closeup -- Butch in same photo. U)    Same as (O).   Mom with tattooed man. V)    Extreme closeup -- tattooed man from same photo. W)    Snapshot of crime scene in the bar. A man lies      on the floor in a pool of blood. Onlookers, including      some of the dime dancers and Butch's mom, express their     shock at the incident while police photographers and     newsmen look on. \nX)    Extreme closeups    -- Some of the onlookers faces. Y)    Extreme closeup    -- Butch's mom's face. As  opposed to the others, her    face is rather displaced.  You'd think she'd witnessed    a fender bender instead of a murder. Z)    Extreme closeup -- The face of the victim.      It's the tattooed man. AA)   Extreme closeup -- The tattoo. The ROAR of the MACHINE GROWL is now DEAFENING as the image of the tattoo... FADES INTO: 162   BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT                                             162 that FILLS the FRAME. INT./EXT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT (PRESENT) \nExcept it's brighter than the brightest day as a high power light shines directly at... EXTREME CLOSEUP - BUTCH who exits his dream and enters reality with a throttled shock. He squints and tries to discern the source of the light while groping for his gun under the seat. BUTCH'S POV - WHITE LIGHT It's bright as hell but getting clearer, less fuzzy. We can now see it's the headlights of a huge COMBINE which sits, ENGINE RUNNING, directly in front of the station wagon. (CONTINUED) \n184   CONTINUED:                                                    184 Phillip stands, stares, aware that something bad is happening. Butch finishes tying, sticks the knife in his pocket and walks over to the PHONOGRAPH. He turns it back ON. The SCRATCHY RECORD plays. He turns UP the VOLUME. BUTCH (to Phillip) You can go wait in the car or you can watch. Yer' old enough to think for yer'self. Phillip, unsure what to do, stands his ground. \nButch returns to his seat   on the coffee table and stares at the three hostages. He    appears as if he's about to cry, closes his eyes and rests   his chin on the barrel of the revolver while he recites   instructions... BUTCH Shut yer' eyes, Cleve. Mack, you and Lottie hold the boy tight. Shut yer' eyes, too. Phillip, awkwardly aware that he's going to witness an execution, starts to cry out, then squelches himself. Butch seems to be in another world now -- taken to another place and time. A slight smile finds its way to his face, then disappears. LOTTIE Please, mistah', ain't no use in it. MACK We'll give you ever'thing we got! But Butch doesn't even hear the words. He slowly opens his eyes, pulls his chin from the pistol barrel and points it at Mack. LOTTIE Our Father, which are in heaven, Hallo be thy name... BUTCH (to Lottie) Shhh... shhh... shhh... LOTTIE ... Thy Kingdom come, Lawd, thy will be done... here on Earth as it is in Heaven. (CONTINUED) \n184   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              184 BUTCH Shhh.. shhh... LOTTIE (to Mack/Cleve) Say it wif' me.... Butch looks to Phillip in a strange way, sets the gun on the floor between them, and crawls amongst the candy, gum and wrappers until he finds the electrician's tape. Phillip watches, not knowing what to do. The revolver -- cocked, resting on the floor. \nMACK, CLEVE & LOTTIE Giv' us this day our daily bread and forgiv' us, Lawd, our trespasses as we forgiv' those who tresspass agin' us... Butch rips tape from the roll and slaps a piece over each of their mouths, silencing their prayers one by one. Out of breath, he kneels down in front of them and stares at the three while he reaches his hand behind him for the .... pistol -- but it's not there... Butch looks up to see... Phillip -- teeth gritted, holding the pistol, pointing it directly at Butch. CLOSEUP - BUTCH His expression is blank -- then a slight smile. For a second it's as if none of this has happened, that Butch will grasp Phillip in his arms... A DEAFENING GUNBLAST turns his expression to blank. Phillip, knocked to the floor by the revolver's kick, recovers to his knees, shaking like a leaf. The MAMBO RECORD comes to an END, but SCRATCHES ON AD INFINITUM. Butch falls back to his knees, still staring at Phillip. He looks at his stomach, where a stain of brown-red gushes through his T-shirt, and back to the boy. BUTCH (as if he hasn't seen him in years) Phillip?.... (CONTINUED) \n184   CONTINUED:   (3)                                             184 Phillip, momentarily dazed, stares at the gun in his hand, at Butch, the blood pouring from Butch's side, and the shocked faces of Mack and his family. Then, in a flash, he runs, pell-mell, out of the house. 185   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                             185 Phillip blasts out the screen door and runs straight to the well. He drops the gun into the well, catches his breath and heads for the road. After a few yards he has a thought, runs back to the station wagon, grabs the keys and throws them as far into the adjacent field as he can. Then he resumes his race for the road. 186   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                             186 Butch gropes to his feet, still in shock. He stumbles toward the door, then stops, reaches in his pocket, extracts Mack's Barlow knife, holds it up and walks toward them, staring hard. Mack, Cleve, Lottie -- Afraid they'll be killed after all. Butch, surprisingly, meekly sets the knife down on the coffee table... BUTCH Thanks for yer' hospitality. And walks away. 187   EXT.

He drags himself to the station wagon and, with much effort, slides himself into the seat. No keys. He opens the door, crawls out, leaving a trail of blood, looks out to the road and starts to walk.

BUTCH (yelling) Phillip?!! I won't hurt ya', I swear! PHILLIP is running out of steam on the road ahead.   He stops for a blow and looks back. HIS POV \nA few hundred yards back, Butch struggles forward. BACK TO SCENE Phillip crawls through the ditch beside the road and squeezes through a barb wire fence. His costume hangs on a barb. He rips away from the fence leaving a foot-long strand behind. In the b.g. -- a pickup truck drives by. 188   INT.

As opposed to someone I don't know, I mean. All things considered, I feel pretty good, though. Could use a beer, though. PHILLIP What's beer taste like? BUTCH Oh, it's about the best thing there is. You'd better put that on the list. Phillip's eye catches something.     He stands up fearfully...

(notices Sally) Sorry, ma'am. SALLY No doubt an observation based on personal experience. Red can't help but smile. RED You got him spotted? HENDRICKS By the creek, half-mile down the road. I spaced officers in a circle around them 100 yards or so away. RED You got any problem with me handling this one? HENDRICKS What say we both handle it? Red sighs. RED Let's head on down there.

Take a look around and you'll see I'm shootin' ya' straight. BUTCH (yelling back) All this for me. I'm touched, but I'm afraid ya'll gonna' have to back it up a step or two. I'm headed to Mexico.

CREEKSIDE - DAY                                       202 BUTCH (to Phillip) Beer. What'd I tell ya'. (to Red) Appreciate the offer, Cap'n, but ya' know I can't do that. If you and yer' pals back outta' here, I'll drop the boy at the border. (beat) If you don't I'll shoot him in the head. I mean it! Phillip, betrayed beyond comprehension, stares at Butch. BUTCH (to Phillip) Don't look at me like that. I don't even have a gun. What did ya' do with the pistola' anyway? PHILLIP Threw it in the well. BUTCH Good thinkin'. \n203   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          203 ADLER Ya' think he means it? Red mulls it over, replaces his old chaw with a fresh one and looks to Sally. RED What do you think? SALLY Based on what's happened the past two days I don't think he would. RED One thing's for sure. If he gets outta' here with the boy, we're right back to where we started. BRADLEY If he kills the boy he'll get the chair. ADLER Shit, he'll get the chair anyway.   He's killed two in two days. SALLY We don't know that he pulled the trigger on either of the innocent victims. ADLER Well he wasn't at home in his Strat-O- Lounger. 'Sides, who killed Pugh? Casper? RED All right, both of you, that's enough! From the trail of blood I got a feelin' it ain't gonna' make any difference. Let's jus' concentrate on gettin' the boy out for now. Bobby Lee approaches with a leather case, bypasses Red and goes straight to Hendricks. BOBBY LEE Where ya' want me, sir? RED Can you shoot off a hood? Bobby Lee nods. In the b.g., a HELICOPTER circles, preparing to land. (CONTINUED) \n203   CONTINUED:                                                   203 ADLER That'd be the boy's mother.

There's yer' rocketship. PHILLIP Think I'll get to ride it? BUTCH Today's the day. RED (V.O.) (megaphoned) Butch, we got the boy's Mama here. She wants to say something. Phillip is visibly stunned by the news. He crawls up to the crest of the creekside and squints, looking for his mom. BUTCH What's wrong, Phillip? PHILLIP It's my mama. Phillip still cranes his neck to see. \nBUTCH Now that ya' got yerself a ghost suit, do ya' think she'll let ya' trick r' treat? PHILLIP (better than none) I got to do one house. Butch smiles.

Phillip shakes it, afraid. BUTCH 'Bye, Phillip.    It's been one helluva' ride. Butch nods and smiles. BUTCH (yells) All right, Cap'n. Make way for Casper the friendly ghost.

Phillip, despite his prior urgency, is having trouble coaxing relief. Butch slides into the Ford, pumps the gas pedal and turns the key. The ENGINE GRUMBLES and DIES.

Butch cranks again and again but the Ford is flooded. \nBUTCH Start, you sonofabitch! The Farmer runs faster, comes closer... FARMER Hey, that's my car! Hey!!!

I created a position for myself with the prison system. \nRED What's yer' husband think about all this? SALLY Don't own one. RED Yer' not careful you'll wind up jus' like me. Old, tired, with nobody around to love ya'. SALLY Maybe. RED It's crazy ain't it? SALLY What's that? \nRED Goin' without sleep chasin' after a three time loser and Casper the Friendly Ghost? SALLY Sleep?    That's what retirement's for. RED Bite your tongue. SALLY You wanna' know what's really crazy? Hayne's juvenile court record lists you as Amicus Curiae. Silence save the CRICKETS.

Evidence given by a non-party with the intention of swaying the judge one way or the other. They're usually in written form, but there's no copy attached. Red doesn't flinch. SALLY Okay, then at least tell me why Haynes got four years for a joyride? What about probation? The boy had a home, a father. RED What's your file say about him? SALLY That he was a petty thief who did a little time, got out and stayed pretty clean. RED There are murderers I'd trust with my mother and petty thieves I wouldn't turn my back on. Your precious files are wrong. SALLY I'm listening. RED Hayne's old man was a career criminal with a soft spot for whores. One way or the other he beat the hell outta' every person he ever crossed, screwed or fathered. Judge sends junior home with the old man and you can bet your last dollar that within a year he'll have a rap sheet as long as yer arm. (beat) I know kids who did Gatesville, made it through, shaped up. Hell, one's even a priest. Sally realizes she's opened an old wound. SALLY Still, I don't understand from the file why... RED -- This job ain't about files and books and second guessin'. Ya get one shot and ya call 'em like you see 'em.

RED In Texas the bottom line is who ya' know and what they owe ya. That's how I do my job and how you got yours. He turns to walk inside. SALLY (a bit ticked) What are you trying to say? \n", "test2_id": 355, "test3_input": "174   CONTINUED:                                                     174 PHILLIP Sure thing.

Cleve, still whispering and giggling with Phillip, isn't really listening. MACK Don't ya hear good, boy?!

Butch spots an old phonograph. BUTCH Say, lookie here. He gives it a spin with his finger and searches through a stack of 78s. \nLOTTIE Mr. Andrews give 'em to us when he got hisself a newfangled one. Butch finds a particular favorite. BUTCH Jeezus. Now this is music. You know how long it's been since I heard this. LOTTIE That's an oldie all right.

Butch and Lottie dance, swirling around the room. LOTTIE Mr. Poe, you sure can move. \nBUTCH Oughta be able to. Was raised in a dime a dance whorehouse. LOTTIE Yer' foolin' me? BUTCH No, ma'am.

He is believed to have a hostage with him, an eight-year-old boy. A finger turns OFF the RADIO. We FOLLOW the finger UP an arm TO Butch's concerned face.

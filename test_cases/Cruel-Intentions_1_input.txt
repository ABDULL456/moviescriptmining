She nods. He points to her book. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Great book. What's the guy's name, Florentino... 
ANNETTE Florentino Ariza. 
Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles around. 
SEBASTIAN My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino. 
ANNETTE Who's Monsieur Philipe? 
SEBASTIAN You don't know Monsieur Philipe? 
Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) (low voice) Bonjour mademoiselle. 
ANNETTE (laughs) Bonjour Monsieur Philipe. 
SEBASTIAN (Monsieur Philipe voice) You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you. 
The puppet kisses her on the cheek. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) (Monsieur Philipe voice) Oooo, that felt good. 
ANNETTE Thank you. 
He kisses her on the cheek. 
SEBASTIAN (Monsieur Philipe voice) That felt good too. I will kiss you all over. 
The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian tickles her back. 
They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she pushes him off her. 
Sebastian stands. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I'm sorry about that. 
ANNETTE I am too. 
He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger. 
SEBASTIAN You know what? I don't take it back. 
ANNETTE Why are you doing this? 
SEBASTIAN Because I'm in love with you. 
ANNETTE I thought you said we were going to be friends. 
SEBASTIAN I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me! 
ANNETTE I have feelings for you. 
SEBASTIAN Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus. 
ANNETTE That's not fair. 
SEBASTIAN Why can't we be together? 
Annette's eyes well up with tears. 
ANNETTE You really want to know? 
SEBASTIAN Yes. 
ANNETTE It's because I don't trust myself with you. (beat) I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please. 
She hurries off. 
61   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       61 
Sebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him. 
SEBASTIAN (frustrated) Shit. 
He hears the shower running from the bathroom. 
62   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY                   62 
Sebastian enters the room. Cecile sticks her head out from the shower curtain.

Clay opens the squeaking door and enters behind Hanna. Whale stands at a drafting table, sharpening a pencil. Hanna sets the tray down. 
WHALE Very good, Hanna.  Now goodbye. 
She goes toward the door, wrinkling her forehead at Clay. The screen door bangs shut. 
WHALE I'm sure you'd like something to wet your whistle while I work. 
Whale opens a bottle of beer, pours it into a glass, hands it to Clay.  He gestures to a chair. 
WHALE We'll go slowly today.  Since this is your first time as a model. 
Clay sits.  He pulls a "TV Guide" out of his back pocket. 
CLAY Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night. 
WHALE You don't say?  Which picture? 
CLAY "Bride of Frankenstein." 
WHALE Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin? 
Clay takes a swig of beer and sets the glass on the floor. 
CLAY Ready when you are. 
Whale stares at Clay. 
WHALE That shirt, Mr. Boone. 
CLAY It's new. 
WHALE I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off? 
CLAY I'm not wearing an undershirt. 
WHALE Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly. 
CLAY But it's just my face you want to draw. 
WHALE Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable... (sighs) Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear. 
He lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker, revealing a stack of "Physique" magazines.  Whale casually covers them with a newspaper. 
WHALE We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness? 
CLAY All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway. 
He unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off. 
WHALE Yes.  Much better. (steps forward) Here. 
Clay adjusts his belt buckle as Whale hangs the shirt on a wall peg.  He moves back to the easel again. 
WHALE I think we'll have you sit slightly sideways, so you can rest one arm on the back of the chair.  Yes. Just so. 
The arm with the tattoo faces the easel.  Clay smirks. 
CLAY Take a picture, it lasts longer. 
WHALE That's exactly what I intend to do. 
A clatter of pencils in the easel's tray, followed by a moment of silence.  Finally, a low, whistly scratch.  Clay concentrates on keeping still, focusing on an open window. 
WHALE You seem to have no idea how handsome you are, Mr. Boone.  It has to do with how snugly your face fits your skull. 
Clay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist. 
WHALE Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks. 
CLAY No.  I'm fine. 
WHALE It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you. 
Whale suddenly sniffs, as if smelling something.  He sniffs several times more but continues to draw. 
WHALE (to himself) Dripping? (to Clay) Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread. 
CLAY Sounds like something you feed the dog. 
WHALE It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar. 
CLAY Your family ate dripping?

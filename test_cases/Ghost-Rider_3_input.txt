NOMI (almost afraid to ask) What about the baby? Blaze just shakes his head. 
BLAZE It's funny. That kid was supposed to be my second chance. Rox and I used to talk about it -- how things'd be different after she was born. Nomi didn't expect his honest vulnerability. 
NOMI Maybe that's why we have them 
BLAZE What, kids? 
NOMI 
(NODDING) So we can make amends for all the royal fuck-ups we've perpetrated on the world. God knows I've had my share. (beat, pained) I just don't want her to have to pay for the things I've done. You know? Blaze nods. He knows all too well. He and Nomi drive on in silence for a beat, their thoughts turning inwards. 
NOMI (CONT'D) Can I ask you something? Honestly? (off Blaze's nod) What're you going to do when you find Starke? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
BLAZE Make him pay, somehow -- 
(UNCERTAIN) I don't know. How do you beat the Devil? Walk up and bitch-slap him? Pretend you're Schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka up his hind ass? I'm basically making this up as I go along. Nomi smiles. 
NOMI I'm sure you'll figure something out. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - NIGHT 
-- Rain looking out through the truck's moon roof, watching stars passing overhead. As the sky above slowly brightens in time-lapse, Rain's eyes grow lidded. She sleeps, clutching her skeleton toy and -- 
INT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - DAY 
-- waking sunlight floods the cabin. New shift. Odell drives. Rain rides shotgun. Carrigan and Landsdale are sacked out in back. The radio drones, laced with STATIC. Tedium. No one slept well. Carrigan stares out at the passing plains, expertly cutting a deck of cards one-handed. He SEES a scarecrow go by, standing ragged in the middle of nowhere. Then his cell phone RINGS. Carrigan flips it open -- 
CARRIGAN Yeah? Based on his facial expressions, the news isn't good. He sighs, disconnects the call. Landsdale cocks an eyebrow. 
CARRIGAN (CONT'D) Rodenburg's dead. Oswalt, Weingrod, all those other inbred losers too. (off Landsdale's look) Looks like my ex-bitch has hooked up with the fire guy -- In the rear-view mirror, Odell's eyes grow wide. 
ODELL No fucking way -- Carrigan ponders, nods to Landsdale. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CARRIGAN We're going to need reinforcements, some kind of escort to the meet. 
LANDSDALE I know a guy. Got some boys given over to wickedness and such. 
CARRIGAN (tosses him the phone) Make the call. 
RAIN (0.5.) He'll find me, you know. Her voice makes Odell jump. He thought she was asleep 
ODELL (fretful, pleading) 
BILLY-RAY -- 
CARRIGAN (to Rain, leans forwards) Hey, kiddo, you're worrying my boy here. So shut your goddamn mouth -- 
RAIN You can't tell me what to do. You're not my father. Wow. The truck collectively holds its breath. Carrigan settles back, but he's pissed. 
CARRIGAN You better believe that, sweetheart. I'm just the dumb-ass that financed your whole fucking life. You and your mother both. And what did I get for that selfless act of stupidity? She burned down the house and gave me something to remember her by. He's referring to the scar under his eye. Rain turns away. Huddles against the door. 
LANDSDALE Believe me, I could care less what Starke wants with you. Make you into a fucking hood ornament if he wants to. It's not like you came springing out of my loins. Only thing I care about now is getting what's mine, and that's -- 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LANDSDALE (CONT'D) (counting on his fingers) -- payment and retribution, got it? She's not listening. Her bound hands are secretly pushed down into the tight gap between the seat and the door.

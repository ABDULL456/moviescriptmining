MOM! The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicks 
INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING 
Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am. 
E 
OLLIE (O.S.) Mo-om! It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the hall and Phil to the bathroom. 
OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Mom! Mom! Mom! 
CLARA I'm coming, Ollie! 
INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 
As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack of PAPERS in his hand. 
CLARA Uh Phil? 
Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers. 
PHIL Yep? 
CLARA I need to switch. I've got an open house. Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but contains it. 
PHIL Really? 
CLARA Yeah. Really. As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands together. 
PHIL OK, so I say today we go for the slacker look - cool yet approachable. 
OLLIE Yeah, well Mom says that. Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair. 
PHIL Oh. Well... that's cool too! 
INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAME 
The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open. She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror. As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as well. 
CLARA Ech. Mine. She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of razor hairs and bits of toothpaste. Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper. 
Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT. As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad 
NT. KITCHEN Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits at the table. Phil finally notices. 
PHIL What? 
OLLIE Breakfast? 
PHIL 
(HOPPING UP) Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob today. What's it gonna be? Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign of his tom. 
OLLIE How about... some Captain Crunch? Phil gets an idea and writes zickly. 
PHIL 
(DISTRACTED) 
OL Captain Crunch?The cereal? 
PHIL Uh... yeah. Sure. Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed in a suit, comes into the room and spots it. 
CLARA Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a bowl yesterday. 
IE But Dad already said yeah sure. Clara glances at Phil. said it. I said it

{"test1_input": "SPANGLISH \nby \nJames L. Brooks \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \n1   INT. BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON      1 \nA shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular. LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words you would hear love confronted and considered in a very specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down -- and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for another trip down his upper body... MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30 minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring, goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says something in Spanish...important for us because it will establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular anger, \"you said you would never push me around again. If you do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own back as high as you want.\" (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.) For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue. Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy. This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of their marriage. \n2   INT./EXT. BEDROOM / DUSTY ROAD - OTHER ANGLE                  2 \nShowing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road. We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word, \n\"Cristina.\" When the man protests her stopping she indicates they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room..... \n3   EXT. DUSTY ROAD - THE BUS                                     3 \nAs CRISTINA, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to step down. She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly, digging into her little pack to pull out an English book which she displays with pride. Now she steps down from the bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see. \nNARRATOR \nTo Princeton University's Director of Admissions: In considering me for a scholarship you have asked for, and have every reason to expect, an essay from me about myself. And, as a clever high school graduate, I of course realize the subtext of this essay about who I am and why I want to enter Princeton, is actually to make clear to you why you should have me. I have gotten tips, from friends who have preceded me to college, that being a Latina, with my grades, list of activities and relative poverty, I am as good as in if I simply do the dance and work in a word like \"bipolarization\" every so often. And while I love dances -- this dance of self is one I am afraid to master. (young girl looks off and lights up) I prefer to write about my mother. \n4   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - SCHOOL GIRL'S POV - MOM                   4 \nA drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man getting out. He nods in another direction calling our attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so she does not see what is transpiring. \nNARRATOR \nFor my mother, that afternoon eleven years ago was a watershed not because of my father's \n(MORE) \nNARRATOR (cont'd) imprisonment but because it was my first day at school.... \n5   INT. KITCHEN / HUSBAND'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                5 \nThis room is directly across from the husband's room. The woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches. The man gives her husband some money..all the time the woman is chattering to distract the girl. Looking off --the woman grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises her voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles her daughter. \nNARRATOR \nThere was never any pretense that the gorgeous, vital, clever, temperamental animal that was my mother ever for a heartbeat considered having any life of her own. She ignored all her needs and was alive only for me. It was terrific. (a long beat) At the time. \nON MOM. \nAs she watches her daughter chew a cookie. Her daughter begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the action in the next room. Her husband makes a break for the window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is an impressive charade. \nFULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS. \nAnd just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing, she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned today..the daughter says she was taught a little English. Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband toward the front door where other police await. Her daughter starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something. \n6   INT. / EXT. KITCHEN - ON GIRL.                                6 \nStanding proudly, smoothing her skirt. \nCLOSE UP GIRL. \nAs she clears her throat and says directly into camera. \nGIRL \nHi. The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in Spanish. \nMOTHER \nUna l\u00e1grima...sola una sola...Haz la mejor possible. \nNARRATOR \n\"One tear..only one...so make it a good one.\" This was my mother's instruction to me. \nON CHILD. \nBaffled by the edict.. \nON MOTHER. \nHolding up one finger. That's it..one tear..she means it. \nON CHILD.. \nAs she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little head...the eyes clear. \n7   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     7 \nAs the mother, lying in bed with her daughter loses her own fight with tears..managing with difficulty to keep her convulsive sobs silent since her daughter and she are intertwined like pretzels. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n8   INT. GIRL'S ROOM - DAY                                            8 \nThe girl works on her lesson plan..She is a study in beauty. Her mother's daughter. Across the small hallway her mother greets and deals with friends and family in a: \n9    SERIES OF SHOTS                                                  9 \nAs the girl works..her dress changing as the days change while different visitors listen hard to her mother across the hall. \nNARRATOR \nMy mother dealt with our considerable problems of survival by talking..Always she discovered her own best thoughts by sifting through her own words. The mother stops talking in mid-sentence, realizing she has just solved something and makes a note. \n10   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - THE TWO OF THEM IN BED - NIGHT       10 \nNARRATOR \nEach night my mother promised me a wonderful life.. Each night I looked for a new expressive way to tell my mother how much I loved her. The child is ardent..clutching at her heart...kissing her mother.. Holding her mother's face, talking directly into her eyes. The mother, enormously pleased, is nonetheless thrown by the extremes of it. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) \nI just played and did my lessons and every time I looked up my mother was in the process of saving us. \n11   INT. / EXT. MONTAGE - VARIOUS SHOTS                          11 \nHer mother selling keepsakes..counting money..Friends and relatives bringing food, clothing - toys. \nNARRATOR \nDesperation in her hands was our weapon. \nON MOTHER.. \n", "test1_true": "NARRATOR (CONT'D) \nWith this weapon she had her marriage annulled - usually impossible for the poor - and somehow convinced an associate of my father's to transport two Mexicans North in style. \n12   INT. SMALL AIRPLANE - MAGIC HOUR                             12 \nThe mother and daughter seating themselves. The mother is enormously nervous with the prospect of flight. She sits, the daughter ignores an empty seat and goes on her lap, mother hugging daughter, daughter hugging the hug. \nAMERICAN PILOT \n(to girl) How you doing? \nGIRL \n(accented English) Hi. How are you? I am fine.. (she checks her book of English synonyms) ..happy, merry, joyful, glad, contented, frisky. As they taxi. \nAMERICAN PILOT \n(to mother) Are you her mother, sister..what? The mother says, \"solo espa\u00f1ol\"---\"only Spanish.\" The daughter starts to chatter excitedly about the imminent flight. Her mother quiets her firmly in order to pray for their safety.. As the plane continues to taxi...We HEAR the mother's prayer in Spanish. She then nudges her daughter..who, with this gentlest of prods, repeats the same prayer. \n13   EXT. AERIAL SHOT..                                           13 \nThe plane crossing the Rio Grande. \nNARRATOR \nMy mother's prayer for us, which she made me repeat exactly, represented a stunning look into our future. \"Please God, let only the bad things change.\" \n14   INT. SMALL PLANE - CLOSE ON THE TWO FEMALES..                14 \nUse this image if ever you want to strike a coin depicting the moment of no return. The child aglow with happy anticipation..the adult brave and enormously anxious. \nOTHER ANGLE. \nThe pilot taken with the mother's looks. \nAMERICAN PILOT \nHow can I reach you? Address? Telephone? Por favor. Por favor. \nHe glances over..this is not lechery, it is art appreciation..an errant but decent man awed by the creature he is drawn to.. \nNARRATOR \nMy mother had redefined her own passions. Blaming herself for the father she gave me, she would never again be lured by a man's rough edges..She had decided that goodness would be her catnip. \nON MOTHER.. \nAs she feels him looking at her and turns. With some affection and regret, she shakes her head, \"no.\" \nTHE PILOT. \nAs he mouths the word \"ouch.\" \n15   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT...                                        15 \nPlane landing on a dirt and grass strip... \n16   EXT. FIELD - LATER - NIGHT - ON MOTHER AND DAUGHTER..        16 \nStanding on the tarmac..Latin flavored music suddenly gives way to a Texas country harmonica riff..The child tries to comfort her apprehensive mother with the one wondrous fact she finds so thrilling. \nGIRL \n(exulting) Texas... The mother hurries her along in the direction of distant lights. \nGIRL (CONT'D) \n(more emphatically) Texas. \n17   EXT. ELEVATED HIGH SHOT...HIGHWAY                            17 \nThe two of them waiting, small figures. \nGIRL \nMam\u00e1, Texas.. She raises her fingers like pistols. Shoots, blows in them and reholsters them. \n18   EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK                                          18 \nBus traveling the highway. The child looks out sadly. \nGIRL \nAdios, Texas. \nTRANSITION TO: \n19   EXT. NORTH VALLEY STREET - EARLY EVENING                     19 \nAs they disembark...the mother studying a slip of paper...fearing she has made the mistake of a lifetime. The child fascinated by all. \nNARRATOR \nAt the time, I was oblivious to my mother's anguish. She loved and lived to talk. Now, as if by a witch's spell, words were no longer her bridge but her barrier. In a very real sense she feared she had left herself behind. \nON THE TWO FEMALES. \nThe mother sees something. Joy returns. \nHER POV. \nA street full of stores with SIGNS IN SPANISH..She begins walking the street asking passers-by for directions in Spanish and is answered..her step lightens..she beams with relief. So far so very, very good. \n20   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - DAY - FIVE MONTHS LATER..                20 \nAn iron gate in front..small courtyard ringed by a second floor horseshoe of apartments. \nNARRATOR \nWe moved into a place managed by my mother's aunt. My mother worked two jobs in two local stores paying a total of 450 dollars a week... \n21   INT. APT. - DAY                                              21 \nAs the mother enters. \nNARRATOR \n..just ever so barely enough. \n22   INT.

CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                       84 \nAs Deborah, Flor and Evelyn enter. They carry boxes of stuff. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nI don't care if it's a rental..this place is getting a fixing. She leads Flor to a small bedroom. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \n(to Flor with gestures) This will be yours.. Flor doesn't understand..certainly doesn't want to. \nEVELYN \nDid you ask her if she could live in? \nDEBORAH \nCome on...there's no buses from her to here. There's no question. Double come on... Deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like the law vs. the bible then with heavy sarcasm. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nThe Barrio - Carbon Beach..The Barrio - Carbon Beach. What to do? (to Flor) Don't worry. I'm putting nicer stuff in here too. When Flor gives no indication of anything - just standing, somewhat stupefied..Deborah takes her by the hand and leads her out. \n85   EXT. CLASKY - BEACH RENTAL - DAY                            85 \nAs they move through a little courtyard area toward the street. \nDEBORAH \nYou must learn English. Why won't she learn English? I'm going to have to learn, \"you must learn English,\" in Spanish. \nEVELYN \nI think Flor is perfect and we should do all we can to keep her from changing. \nDEBORAH \nGee, you took the words right out of my mouthay. \n86   EXT. PCH - DAY                                               86 \nAs she leads Flor along the highway side of Carbon Beach - passing houses until she sees a Hispanic man washing someone's car in a driveway. Evelyn is many steps back. \nDEBORAH \nOh, good. Do you speak English? \nHISPANIC MAN \nYes, I do. \nDEBORAH \nWould you translate for me? He looks at Flor..my God. \nHISPANIC MAN \nSure...forever. He speaks to her in Spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment. Flor, in full control, says, in Spanish..\"Would you please just find out what she wants.\" Evelyn joins them. \nDEBORAH \nWait till I say something before you start in.. (he looks at her) I rented a house here for the summer and now she must sleep at the house because of the bus schedule. He translates along with Deborah's speech. \nON FLOR. \nStricken. She turns to Deborah. \nFLOR \nNo.. Sorry. \nDEBORAH \nWhat? Why? Flor talks briefly in Spanish. \nHISPANIC MAN \nShe can't because of her daughter. \nDEBORAH \nYou have a daughter? You have a whole daughter you haven't mentioned..How old? \nFLOR \nTwelve. \nDEBORAH \n(to Evelyn) It's a little crazy that I don't know that. The man translates. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \n(to man) Don't translate asides. The man says in Spanish to Flor..\"You work for her?\"--Flor answers, \"just tell her that I can't live here.\" Deborah doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nHey! \nHISPANIC MAN \nShe can't live here. Her daughter. \nDEBORAH \nOkay.. (beat then big decision) Her daughter can also live with us for the summer.. The man tells Flor..she answers directly to Deborah.. \nFLOR \n(big decision) No, sorry. \nDEBORAH \n", "test2_true": "HISPANIC MAN \nI don't know. She just doesn't want to. \nDEBORAH \nWill you please just tell me what she said. \nHISPANIC MAN \nShe said, \"I just don't want to.\" \nEVELYN \nIf she didn't tell us about her child she has to have a deep sense of privacy. We can figure out how she can still live at home. Hell, I don't mind driving her at night. \nDEBORAH \nLet's spare the world you on the roads. (to Flor) Well, what do we do? The Hispanic man translates the last sentence. Deborah and Flor stare at each other..Deborah's next words are somber and have enough body language to transcend the need for translation...the jig is up. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \n(big decision) I'm sorry, my friend, this is what I need. It's just for the summer. I don't want to lose you. But .... Flor indicates there is no need to translate. A beat. \nFLOR \n(enormous decision) Yo vivo aqu\u00cc. \nHISPANIC MAN \nShe'll live here. The man says something in Spanish to Flor as she starts to walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to actually stumble as she looks back at him...then, before Deborah can admonish him. \nHISPANIC MAN (CONT'D) \nI said, \"God protect you from that boss.\" \n87   EXT. FLOR'S APT. COMPLEX - DAY                               87 \nAs Cristina, trying to suppress her grin, skips quickly down the stairs moving towards a truck from John's restaurant. Flor follows tight lipped - resolved. They each carry many clothes on wire hangers. A group of girls on the balcony literally cheer Cristina on. \nBALCONY GIRLS \n(accented) \nMAL-----I------BU! \nCristina grins hugely back at them. \n88   INT.

TRUCK - DAY.                                            89 \nAs the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and waves..Cristina taking it in, unaware that her mother's eyes never leave her. \nShe gasps frequently..MAJOR GIANT ORGANIC GASPS OF WONDER AND PLEASURE..This is awe as an active physical exercise. The MOVING SHOT dramatizes the crossroads of the mother-daughter relationship as the TWO SHOT finds Flor becoming first blurred then lost as we focus on Cristina exclaiming over each new sight. \nNARRATOR \n(over this incidental dialogue) The first time one sees natural beauty which is owned by others confounds the senses.. I had never imagined the word \"money\" could be associated with anything but the anxiety of not having enough. I didn't know God had a toy store for the rich. \n90   EXT. CLASKY BEACH HOUSE - STREET SIDE - DAY                 90 \nThe truck in the driveway..the women walking through a front door into a court yard. \n91   EXT.

The dog goes crazy with excitement -- then, droll for a nine year old, Georgie turns to his grandmother (who is sunning herself and reading) and addresses her in precisely the same way. Evelyn has a drink in hand.. \nGEORGIE (CONT'D) \n(to grandmother) Who wants to go swimming?..Huh.. \nEVELYN \nNot now..But I promise I'll go in the summer after next. John enters the scene.. \nJOHN \nYou want to go swimming? \nGEORGIE \nOh yeah, you're off. \nJOHN \nWhat do you think, wet suits? \nGEORGIE \nWet suits are for wimps.. \nJOHN \nYeah, you're right..let me get mine.. Georgie laughs.. \nGEORGIE \n(to Dad) You're good. \n92   INT./EXT. HALLWAY / PATIO - DAY                              92 \nBehind Flor and Cristina as they move toward the Claskys and their destiny....Flor behind her daughter. \nREVERSE - CLOSE ON CRISTINA. \nAs her eyes pop on seeing the Clasky beach house. \nVERY CLOSE ON DEBORAH \nAs her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year-old enter her home, haloed by the sun. Again, Flor less distinct in the background. Bernice, just outside the open patio door, is putting on a shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at Cristina and emits a small, prescient moan. \nDEBORAH \n(to Flor) Look at this child..Flor, you could make a fortune at surrogate pregnancy.... Flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what Deborah said.. \nFLOR \nQue? Cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother. \n", "test2_id": 169, "test3_input": "FLOR \n(an aside) No te puedo tener haciendo esto por mi. Ahora tengo que aprender ingl\u00c8s. \nCRISTINA AS FLOR \n(over her shoulder to John as they move) I can't have you doing this for me. I must learn English now. \nFLOR \nNo, dije eso por ti - no por John. That translates to \"No, I meant that for you, not John.\" But Cristina does not translate the line. Nor.. \nJOHN \nYou have a wonderful mother. \nFLOR \nQue? \nCRISTINA \nNada. \n120   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 120 \nA Spanish commercial for learning English in a hurry is on television..Flor on the phone ordering it.. \nNARRATOR \nLearning English would cost five hundred and ninety nine dollars down and 15 monthly payments of one hundred and ten dollars...which represents 48 percent interest..Mexicans marketing Mexicans. But not a penny was wasted. \n121   EXT. MAIL BOX - DAY                                        121 \nAs Flor takes a package from the box. \nNARRATOR \nMy mother showed an extraordinary facility for learning the language. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n122   INT.

As Flor silently mouths some English while listening to a tape,Chum nudges her with a ball and, without thinking, she takes it from his mouth and tosses it..Realizing, with alarm, a beat too late that she has broken the rule. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n123   EXT. BEACH - LATE AT NIGHT                                 123 \nFlor sitting on the sand...listening to her tapes..continually forced by Chum's obsessive persistence to throw him the ball. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n124   EXT.

BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                              125 \nAs John enters the house, clearly drunk.   There is the sound of skittering paws as CHUM approaches. \nJOHN \n(cheering) Hey, boy, I can use some up company. But Chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away. John follows, weaving a bit. \n126   INT. BEACH HOUSE - DEN - LATE NIGHT                        126 \nAs John enters the room to find CHUM proffering the ball to Flor who is watching one of video language tapes. She tosses the ball without a look or a thought..then starts when she sees John standing there. He cheers, seeing her predicament. \nWhen she speaks English, at this point, her words are halting. \nJOHN \nYou gotta do something about Chum..Your arm's going to go. She waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of his way. Chum complicates the task, proffering the ball. Flor wearily throws it. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nDon't you sleep anymore? \nFLOR \nNo..You get more if you keep at it. \nJOHN \nYou're doing fantastic. \nFLOR \nNow I am like a three year-old. Your wife go out. \nJOHN \nShe say where? \nFLOR \nNo. (on his reaction) Sorry. \nJOHN \nListen..I just forgot she was going out..don't be a smart ass. (jolted by his own remark) Uh-oh..well, you and I communicate mostly in apologies anyway..I'm sorry. I should be whipped. I should be stoned- it's been a while - I meant to say, I think, don't be smart, don't be kind, don't be sensitive, don't be beautiful. I meant to say, \"hi, Flor, good night Flor..that show you're watching is going to be a hit.\" He staggers out. Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and then urgently gestures Chum to join him. Chum is reluctant, but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master. Flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of John in the den. He is younger and smiling. She studies the picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and purposefully goes back to her lessons. \n127   EXT. P.C.H. - LA SALSA FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY.            127 \nCristina and Bernice waiting in line at the Mexican fast food place on P.C.H. with the towering signature Mexican male figure on its roof. Deborah is parked curbside in the SUV. \nBERNICE \nHow'd you get your mother to let you go with my mother? \nCRISTINA \nWell, your mother just said she could use my help on a few errands while you're in class... Bernice nods. Then unconsciously moans. \nCRISTINA (CONT'D) \nWhat? \nBERNICE \n", "test3_true": "CRISTINA \nWhy do you go then? \nBERNICE \n(looks at her) I'm not sure I can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class..in this case math...and the system kind of insists on the illusion that you've learned math -- so they make you go to summer school..It helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission. \nCRISTINA \nWhat do you mean they failed? \nBERNICE \nJoking. \nCRISTINA \nOh. I see. Forgive me, I don't have a real sense of humor. \nBERNICE \n(looking skyward) Thank you, God. (on Cristina's reaction) Joking... \nCRISTINA \nThe joke is? \nAs they get in the car..Bernice doing a little stutter step offering Cristina the front seat..Cristina demurs. \n128   INT. SUV - DAY.                                            128 \nAs they get in..Deborah privy to the conversation now. \nBERNICE \nThat you're better at everything than I am...and I was thanking God for there being this one thing where I might have my nose in front. Deborah can't think of what single thing Bernice could possibly feel superior about. She is genuinely puzzled. \nDEBORAH \nAnd that thing is??? Bernice deeply resents the question..She turns to her mother. \nBERNICE \nSexual experience.. Cristina laughs. \nBERNICE (CONT'D) \n(ruefully to self) That one even she knows is funny. Cristina gives Bernice an appreciative push from behind. Deborah, for some reason, feels she deserves credit for their connection. \nDEBORAH \nLook at you girls. \n129   INT. BEACH BEDROOM - DAY                                   129 \nDeb working an outfit..her mother eyeing her.. \nDEBORAH \nCristina's already read, on her own, everything on Bernice's summer reading list..And she's two grades behind..Imagine if she went to Bernice's school..And they'd kill to give her a scholarship. \nEVELYN \nTalk to Flor... \nDEBORAH \n(sarcastic) Yeah..she's so open to new things. \n130   EXT. GORGEOUS PRIVATE SCHOOL -DAY.                          130 \nDeborah and Cristina standing in a grass bordered parking lot...Deborah, feigning upset, tearing into her bag but her focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off. She is clearly stalling. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nCan't find my keys.. Another woman, ARLENE FOLSOM, calls to her.. \nARLENE \nDeborah... \nDEBORAH \n(acting surprised) Hi, Arlene.. (to Cristina) Come on. They walk to greet Arlene. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nHi. This is Cristina..the girl I'm always raving about..This is Arlene Folsom..the school director. \nARLENE \nHi.. \nCRISTINA \n(Barbara Boxer couldn't do it better) Hello..a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Folsom. I couldn't believe how beautiful the grounds were as we drove in. I just think the balance of the buildings to open ground is so wonderful and must have been very difficult to achieve. Deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression Cristina is making..all are grinning...the two adults suspiciously so...sharing their delight. \nARLENE \nWould you like a little tour? \nMOVING CAMERA.. \nFirst showing Cristina in foreground and her POV of this Drop Dead Gorgeous Rich Kids School in the background and then we MOVE CLOSER ON CRISTINA. We see lust in her reaction. \nNARRATOR \nThe experience was literally mind boggling. My mind did boggle. My cranial cells stunned. Even if I had enough sense of wonder to imagine such a school existed; my sense of fairness made it unthinkable that any school could offer this much more than my own.. \n131   INT. BEACH LIVING ROOM - DAY                             131 \nThis is the last day of the summer rental - many packed cartons on the floor. Deborah, Flor and Cristina engaged in a momentous conversation..(NOTE: Throughout the following, and quite beside the point, we see Flor periodically make the motion of throwing the ball. But we do not cut to Chum, rather we just hear his claws skittering after the ball as we maintain focus on the momentous conversation.) \nDEBORAH \nNuh-uh, Flor you are not pinning this one on me. I've got to finish packing up. \nFLOR \n(no longer sure of herself or anything) I just don't....Out of space this school wants her to go for free? \nDEBORAH \nWe ran into the school head. They want diversity...Cristina knocked her out...I had nothing to do with it. By the way, the scholarship is worth twenty thousand dollars. And early registration is tomorrow. \n", "test3_id": 170}

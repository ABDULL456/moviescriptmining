{"train": "SPANGLISH \nby \nJames L. Brooks \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \n1   INT. BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON      1 \nA shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular. LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words you would hear love confronted and considered in a very specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down -- and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for another trip down his upper body... MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30 minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring, goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says something in Spanish...important for us because it will establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular anger, \"you said you would never push me around again. If you do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own back as high as you want.\" (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.) For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue. Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy. This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of their marriage. \n2   INT./EXT. BEDROOM / DUSTY ROAD - OTHER ANGLE                  2 \nShowing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road. We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word, \n\"Cristina.\" When the man protests her stopping she indicates they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room..... \n3   EXT. DUSTY ROAD - THE BUS                                     3 \nAs CRISTINA, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to step down. She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly, digging into her little pack to pull out an English book which she displays with pride. Now she steps down from the bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see. \nNARRATOR \nTo Princeton University's Director of Admissions: In considering me for a scholarship you have asked for, and have every reason to expect, an essay from me about myself. And, as a clever high school graduate, I of course realize the subtext of this essay about who I am and why I want to enter Princeton, is actually to make clear to you why you should have me. I have gotten tips, from friends who have preceded me to college, that being a Latina, with my grades, list of activities and relative poverty, I am as good as in if I simply do the dance and work in a word like \"bipolarization\" every so often. And while I love dances -- this dance of self is one I am afraid to master. (young girl looks off and lights up) I prefer to write about my mother. \n4   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - SCHOOL GIRL'S POV - MOM                   4 \nA drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man getting out. He nods in another direction calling our attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so she does not see what is transpiring. \nNARRATOR \nFor my mother, that afternoon eleven years ago was a watershed not because of my father's \n(MORE) \nNARRATOR (cont'd) imprisonment but because it was my first day at school.... \n5   INT. KITCHEN / HUSBAND'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                5 \nThis room is directly across from the husband's room. The woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches. The man gives her husband some money..all the time the woman is chattering to distract the girl. Looking off --the woman grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises her voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles her daughter. \nNARRATOR \nThere was never any pretense that the gorgeous, vital, clever, temperamental animal that was my mother ever for a heartbeat considered having any life of her own. She ignored all her needs and was alive only for me. It was terrific. (a long beat) At the time. \nON MOM. \nAs she watches her daughter chew a cookie. Her daughter begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the action in the next room. Her husband makes a break for the window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is an impressive charade. \nFULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS. \nAnd just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing, she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned today..the daughter says she was taught a little English. Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband toward the front door where other police await. Her daughter starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something. \n6   INT. / EXT. KITCHEN - ON GIRL.                                6 \nStanding proudly, smoothing her skirt. \nCLOSE UP GIRL. \nAs she clears her throat and says directly into camera. \nGIRL \nHi. The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in Spanish. \nMOTHER \nUna l\u00e1grima...sola una sola...Haz la mejor possible. \nNARRATOR \n\"One tear..only one...so make it a good one.\" This was my mother's instruction to me. \nON CHILD. \nBaffled by the edict.. \nON MOTHER. \nHolding up one finger. That's it..one tear..she means it. \nON CHILD.. \nAs she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little head...the eyes clear. \n7   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     7 \nAs the mother, lying in bed with her daughter loses her own fight with tears..managing with difficulty to keep her convulsive sobs silent since her daughter and she are intertwined like pretzels. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n8   INT. GIRL'S ROOM - DAY                                            8 \nThe girl works on her lesson plan..She is a study in beauty. Her mother's daughter. Across the small hallway her mother greets and deals with friends and family in a: \n9    SERIES OF SHOTS                                                  9 \nAs the girl works..her dress changing as the days change while different visitors listen hard to her mother across the hall. \nNARRATOR \nMy mother dealt with our considerable problems of survival by talking..Always she discovered her own best thoughts by sifting through her own words. The mother stops talking in mid-sentence, realizing she has just solved something and makes a note. \n10   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - THE TWO OF THEM IN BED - NIGHT       10 \nNARRATOR \nEach night my mother promised me a wonderful life.. Each night I looked for a new expressive way to tell my mother how much I loved her. The child is ardent..clutching at her heart...kissing her mother.. Holding her mother's face, talking directly into her eyes. The mother, enormously pleased, is nonetheless thrown by the extremes of it. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) \nI just played and did my lessons and every time I looked up my mother was in the process of saving us. \n11   INT. / EXT. MONTAGE - VARIOUS SHOTS                          11 \nHer mother selling keepsakes..counting money..Friends and relatives bringing food, clothing - toys. \nNARRATOR \nDesperation in her hands was our weapon. \nON MOTHER.. \nCristina taking a snack from the refrigerator..smiling at the note her mother left...lighting a burner and melting cheese on a tortilla. \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) \nBut we were fine. We had it down. If only I could have stayed six. The CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY from the child to: \n23   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - ELEVATED SHOT - SIX YEARS LATER.       23 \nThe courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles..a wedding reception is in progress - \nEXTREME CLOSE UP - THE BRIDE. \nGorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep, explosive smile. BACK TO SCENE... music plays and we focus on Cristina, now nearing 12 years of age..dancing with her mother and some other smaller children.. The mother eyes the muscular back of a Great Looking Man...who turns, and quickly oozes quality sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish...him saying something hushed like, \"I have been afraid to talk to you. I need oxygen when I look at you.\" She indicates the six children she is dancing with and offers to include him in some ring around the rosey dance...He indicates the magic of just the two of them...She quickly leads her little flock away.. \nOTHER ANGLE.. \nA reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is staring at them...at first the mother thinks this is adorable...the child eyeing her as if he were a man..she indicates he should join the rest of the children for a dance.. \nMOVING WITH THE BOY.. \nAs he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is interested in... Before the mom can do anything about it, he asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts. \nON CRISTINA.. \nSatellite virginities falling with alarming speed..the first time held by a male, the first time held close, the first sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male eyes which utterly confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his hips into his dancing partner. \nON HER MOTHER. \nNot confused. It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about to be run down by a car..only this time the thing to do is scare the car. \nShe runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts him and throws him to the sidelines. Then pats him on the head maternally and goes back to Cristina. \nCRISTINA. \nSomewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene. \nNARRATOR \nThat quickly it was clear she could no longer work two jobs and leave me to my own at night. The following morning she did something about it. A boy I never saw again had changed our lives. \n24   INT. BUS - DAY                                               24 \nThe mother and her aunt, MONICA, take their seats..the bus is filled with domestics..the mother, nervous, looks over to see and greet... THE BRIDE from last night's wedding. \n25   INT. BUS - DAY - 90 MINUTES LATER.                           25 \nBRIDE \n(to mom) Este es Stone Canyon. \n26   EXT. STONE CANYON - DAY                                      26 \nMUSIC CHANGE..as they disembark and start walking, joining the busload of domestics into the canyon and up the hill....they walk past a perfect country club fairway. Grand trees from either side meet each other high over the road. \nON OUR GAL..AS THEY WALK \nShe sees the stuff...the dream that makes you migrate. She is not awed..she is jazzed. To her aunt she does the Latin version of OH.....MY...GOD!!!!!!!!...At regular intervals in the background, one black SUV after another has a mother taking kids home from school. \n27   EXT. ATTRACTIVE HOME SECURITY GATE - DAY                     27 \nMonica presses the security intercom. The gate swings open. \n28   EXT. HOUSE - DAY.                                            28 \nIn the foreground an expanse of turned up dirt...and huge rolls of sod ready to be laid down. A catering truck stands in the driveway. \n29   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - GREAT KITCHEN / POOL - DAY               29 \nThey enter..lots of glass French doors STAND OPEN to lawn, pool and pool house. They look off. \nTHEIR POV. \nDEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life. She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find. She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the \"don't hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific\" variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her grandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more rolls of sod wait to be laid. \nTHE TWO LATINAS. \nAs they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next. Then Deborah gestures that they should join her at the pool..as they start out.. \nTHEIR EXIT. \nBoink..three stooges retro..those French doors were not open after all. Monica hits first. The women at the pool react. Deborah and Bernice running. Evelyn momentarily attempts to join the rush.. she half rises and then thinks better of it..too late in the day for sudden movements. \nKITCHEN DOORWAY. \nBERNICE \nGee whiz in heaven...How are you? Please? \nDEBORAH \n(a bit hyper) Don't worry..I'm not mad...I was looking for decoration to put on the glass so people would stop walking into it and instead of taking what they had in stock, which was awful, I special ordered. I'll design something myself which I should have done in the fi... Our heroine, seeing the blood flow from her aunt's nose, gestures that Monica needs help not conversation. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \n..and what difference does that make when your nose is bleeding. Shut up, Deborah. \nBERNICE \nNow you got it, Mom. \nDeborah grabs at paper towels, gets an ice pack from the freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the kitchen..She has, moment to moment, the enormous desire to feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can experience. \nDEBORAH \nHere, take these. (second thought) Was that strange to give you money..I just felt badly that.. \nMONICA \nIt's okay. She pockets the cash. \n30   EXT. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY                                  30 \nMoments later. As the group arrives at the outdoor table. Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under her belt. In the background workers roll out sod, the yard becoming more beautiful even as we look. \nMONICA \nShe is my niece. She and her daughter live in the apartment I manage. Yolanda, who worked for you, lived there before she went back home. That's how I heard about the job. \nDEBORAH \nSo who am I interviewing? \nMONICA \nHer. \nFlor..what I walk on? \nMONICA AND EVELYN \nFlorrrrr. \nFLOR \nFlorrrrr. \nBERNICE \nIt means flower, right? \nMONICA \nYes. Flower. Florrrrr. \nEVELYN \nFlorrrrr. \nFLOR \nFlorrrrr. Deborah is beginning to feel criticized...she takes a beat..eyes everyone with some hostility. \nDEBORAH \n(directly to Flor) Is there some school of the ear I'm flunking out of right now? Flor says to Monica, in Spanish, a tip to pronounce her name. Monica warns Flor to leave it rest..since Deborah is becoming clearly and strangely pissed.. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nWhat did she say? \nCLOSE ON FLOR... \nShe feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance. She tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the first time, she is, through Monica, talking directly to Deborah. \nMONICA \n(translating) She says..If you curl your tongue and let it be loose you will have it..that it's hard for Americans.. She says it's great that you try so hard. Many people wouldn't bother. \nDEBORAH \n(an emotional pronouncement/her greatest accolade) She gets me.... She smiles at Flor, who returns the smile. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nYou want some lemonade? Take some lemonade. She pours some for Flor and Monica. Then she closes her eyes and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort: \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nFlorrrrr. It is perfect..Flor grins at Deborah's victory...claps her hands together. \nFLOR \n(a Spanish word) Sublime. Deborah feels relief..free for a moment from the dark corridors of self-criticism..She is lighter, prettier, innocent..Wholly and completely attractive. \nDEBORAH \nWhew, dense but stubborn, right? Thanks. (an important declaration) What you just did with me is just what kids need..patience and encouragement. Alright, money... Bernice rises like a shot to take off.. \nBERNICE \nGoodbye, really.. (to Flor) Look forward to seeing you. As she leaves. \nDEBORAH \n(absently to Bernie) Love you... (then with not a monoseconds break) ... the job is six days a week, seven to seven..the kids and all housekeeping, how much a week would you like? Monica translates..Flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness, ducks the question..saying in Spanish -- \"whatever you say..\" \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nNo.. This is an important question..if you ask for too little it means you don't value \nyourself..too much and you're taking advantage. (after Monica translates) So? Flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not without some native wit and style to maneuver around it. \nFLOR \n(extremely heavy accent) One thousand dollars. Deborah falls for it until Flor laughs..others join...Deborah now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her face and shaking her head. \nOTHER ANGLE.. \nAs Monica uses Deborah's reaction time to, in mid-laugh, flash four fingers to Flor.. \nON EVELYN. \nCatching the gesture and secretly indicating to Monica they should go for six. \nMONICA \n(firmly) Six hundred dollars. Flor shoots her a look of fear...a tense beat. \nDEBORAH \nWelcome to the family.. Deborah kisses her..sort of on the mouth. In the midst of Flor's delight she is thrown by Deborah's kiss...it is the first of many borders to be violated. \n31   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     31 \nAs Flor and Monica exit and can finally show their full joy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n32   EXT. STONE CANYON - EVENING.                                 32 \nJOHN CLASKY driving a smallish SUV. He is an upbeat, talented, successful man with an ego as balanced as a high- end watch; who loves his wife, kids and job. In other words, watch out, John. \n33   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 33 \nAs John pulls into the driveway next to a catering truck and exits his SUV carrying a large wrapped tray.. \n34   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 34 \nAs John moves quickly through the downstairs, he puts the tray on a counter where food servers are working. \nJOHN \nI brought some dessert. As he moves on, we see in the background the workers unwrap and react to a fantastic concoction. A caterer (who we may notice looks at him like royalty) falls in beside him and whispers to him. \nCATERER \nShe came down to check on the party and realized the gardeners hadn't finished rolling the sod. \n35   INT. / EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT                  35 \nJOHN'S POV - DEBORAH AND TWO FEMALE CATERERS. \n39   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY.                           39 \nBernice is making French Toast, doing something novel with the filling and the last cooking process. Some great idea which will have us making a mental note to try it at home. \n40   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS DAY - DAY                       40 \nJohn opens Georgie's door again. \nGEORGIE \nNow? \nJOHN \nYes..actual up.. Georgie gets up.. \nGEORGIE \nMorning, Dad. \nJOHN \nYeah, good morning. \nGEORGIE \nYou as mad at me as Mom 'cause of what happened? John pauses..aware his answer will have repercussions but integrity wins. \nJOHN \nNo, Georgie, I'm not. \nGEORGIE \nAre you mad at me? \nJOHN \nUh...okay, no.. \n41   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN DOORWAY - DAY                    41 \nAs Flor enters from outside. \nBERNICE \nMorning, good to see you. \nFLOR \nMorning. Good too. She notices the French Toast. \nBERNICE \nTry some. She demurs. Bernice holds out one slice on a spatula, indicating Flor should just tear a piece off which she does...One taste and she marvels -- her mouth dropping open at this kid's ability to make something mundane special..Bernice laughs. \nBERNICE (CONT'D) \nThanks. Her mother enters on her way upstairs. She is thoughtful, tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her current demon. She greets Flor and then shakes her head, making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to Flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker. \nDEBORAH \nTough day. Bernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b.g., a GOLDEN RETRIEVER named CHUM approaches Flor from behind with a ball in its mouth. Flor is checking out the kitchen... what's in each drawer, etc .....Deborah is impressed by the self-starter display and indicates same to Bernice. \nBERNICE \nI had an idea for a breakthrough in French toast so I made breakfast. I don't want to be teased about it.. No sarcasm. No tough love. Just try it and if by any chance you have a positive reaction... \nDEBORAH \nRight..mean ol' me. I can't play right now. I have to do something about your brother. \nBERNICE \nI had an idea for a recipe. When has that happened? I got up early to do this. At least taste it, for God's sakes! She does.. \nDEBORAH \nOh, it's good...oh God, it's rich -- Oh God, it's good. \nDEBORAH \n(sudden alarm) By the way, you could do without this. The approval rug pulled out from under her, Bernice looks at her mother. But Deborah is unaware of having hurt her daughter because her attention has been diverted so that Deborah AND THE CAMERA LOSE FOCUS ON BERNICE as the teenager, distraught, moves from the room. \nDEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D) \nNO..NO! FLOR!....Never do fetch. Chum is nudging Flor with the ball and Flor was about to accommodate him by taking it before Deborah's warning shout stopped her in mid-sentence. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nI mean it, NEVER! ON Flor's stunned reaction to the outburst. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nI'm not mad. I'm thinking of you. This is me being nice.. Then using her hands to demonstrate. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nJust no taking ball from dog. (broadly) Trust me on that one. CLOSE UP ON Chum going nuts with Deborah's hand passing in front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nYou and me. We are fine. Just a tip. (she gives her waist a little squeeze) Girlfriends. (Flor is totally confused) Could you make some coffee? Cafe? \nFLOR \nYes. Deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino machine Italian overpriced artists ever devised. \n42   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY        42 \nDeb in the shower...you have never seen so many shampoos, conditioners and bath balms...never seen so huge a sponge..such fluffy towels. \nSkylight over the shower allows a beam of God's warmth. There is a fireplace in the bathroom. The only significance of this being that these people have a fireplace in their bathroom. The woman who made it all happen is putting in a contact lens..She is upset. We see that she has one blue eye and one brown. \nJOHN \nThis isn't an argument, honey. \nDEBORAH \nYes. Yes it is. So stop being so maniacally calm. \nJOHN \n(emphatically) No..it's not. Because I understand your side. \nYou work here and you don't speak any English at all? The sound of feet on the stairs..Deborah and Georgie enter. \nDEBORAH \nAll she has to do is dial 9-1-1 and press two for Spanish. (even before she enters) Flor...John. (to John enunciating the name) This is Flor. \nJOHN \n(pronouncing it perfectly) Hi, Flor. Deborah reacts, grabs some coffee and pushes Georgie along. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \n(to Deborah) Look, I'll take Georgie to school. \nDEBORAH \nNo. I'm doing it..show Flor the ropes. Flor is trying to figure out what's expected of her then Deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and come with her. \n47   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           47 \nThe biggest, baddest, BLACKEST SUV..there is some subtle custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite fathom. Deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and shares a woman to woman moment with Flor. \nDEBORAH \nFuckin' hombres, huh? She sniffles. Flor nods uncertainly. A small voice from the back seat..Georgie.. \nGEORGIE \nI just didn't want to sing last night. \nDEBORAH'S VOICE \n(hurt) Yeah. Well you said you would..You said you wanted to. I asked you five times. Then when I have the whole party paying attention you refused. As she puts the car in gear...Georgie sings insanely well. But he's just two lines into an old blues standard: \nDEBORAH \nIt doesn't do any good now, Georgie. She presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid- song. Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a divider between parent and child. But Deborah is calling for her to pay attention to the car's navigation screen.. a Spanish voice says, \"route guidance system starting.\" \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nI've programmed it for Spanish.. Look, it will take you anywhere and then back home. If you figured out how to make coffee on that thing it's all downhill. The MALE SPANISH VOICE talks about imminent left turns. Flor is thrown by the amount of oddness..All the while Georgie is singing his little heart out in the back seat. Flor,amused by the boy, suppresses a smile...maybe the first time in her life she's had to suppress joy. But Deborah never misses anything. \nDEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D) \nThis is stop gap..You, kiddo, you're going to have to learn English. \n48   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                  48 \nJohn cooking...the theory that nobody's sexier than when they are seen doing what they do best applies here.. In the BACKGROUND John's number two, PETER, the Sous Chef, being bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and GWEN, who spends most nights trying not to show her enormous affection for John. At the moment, John's work is a strange mixture of art and cloddishness.....the hands blur with expertise...but he keeps dropping items.....each time a Latin kitchen worker, ALEX, 20, dives on the spillage..At one point they bump. \nJOHN \nSorry... \nPETER \n(sharply to Alex) Not the best place to stand, fella. \nJOHN \n(to Alex) No. It's me. You're the new helper, huh.. \nALEX \nI didn't mean to... \nJOHN \nNo..no..it's okay. It's me being bugged. Two people head for John almost simultaneously. PEG, an arty looking woman in her late 50's..wild, scraggly gray hair, enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d'. \nPEG \nYou are going to be so happy.. The Maitre D' enters. \nMAITRE D' \nI have something very important to tell you. John makes a no-brainer of a decision pointing to the woman who promised happiness. She hefts her ice chest up on the counter. \nPEG \nPerfect cod this is John -- John, perfect cod..Best one I've seen all season and he was swimming twenty minutes ago. The fish is that special, a sentence that kicks out for a writer, the right brush stroke for an artist. You get it.. \nJOHN \nKnockout. (to Alex) You want to learn something? You want to pack it away? The kid nods.. he picks up the fish. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nCradle it...Put it in the cooler but not on its side.. In the same position it swims. (important added thought) And check the ice pack..make sure it can drain away..if it can't the chlorine can hurt the flesh. Do all that and nobody can put a fish in the fridge better than you...and that's a solid start.. First day and you already did something perfect. \nKID \n(smiling) Yes, I understand. \nMAITRE D' \nPlease. Now? \nJOHN \nOh, sorry..I forgot. He whispers in John's ear.. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nDamn.. \"ohhhh damn.\" \nPETER \nWhat, buddy, what? \nJOHN \nVictor spotted a food critic.. \nPETER \nFrom? \nVICTOR \nThe New York Times..I'll bet they sent her out just for us. (hands John a slip) Here's what she ordered. \nPETER \nLook, if you're nervous take a walk.. \nI'm just drawing blanks. I'm embarrassed. It's my own fault I spent my time on math, which I'm lucky if I don't flunk anyway and.. \nJOHN \nThe guy we are looking for is not a ruse.. \nBERNICE \nWhat's ruse mean? \nJOHN \nPhony. So this president was not a ruse..He was the real thing. \nJOHN \n(she looks at him blankly) Ruse?? \nBERNICE \n(enjoying her father's absurdity) Rusevelt..If I'd ever heard of the word before - that would lock it in..It's so stupid it might work anyway... Deborah enters followed by Flor. They are carrying several boxes of clothes... \nDEBORAH \nSurprise new clothes.. Bernie gasps..As she looks at a sweater.. \nBERNICE \nWhat'd I do right? \nDEBORAH \nWarehouse sale.. Bernice tries on the sweater over her T-shirt..and mirth ends..The sweater is tight...Bernice picks up a blouse and then skirt and checks the size. \nON FLOR AND JOHN. \nAs they are COUPLED BY THE CAMERA ANGLE as each catches on and is dumbfounded. \nON BERNICE.. \nWhose style, wit and grace should not have to be used to deflect such trauma. But so be it, as, though mightily stung: \nBERNICE \nThanks, mom..I'm glad you didn't get here a little earlier or else I wouldn't be able to tell you that your gift is a ruse. Please, excuse me.. She exits to her bathroom. \n51   INT. STAIRWELL - EARLY EVENING                               51 \nFlor one step behind John and Deborah who are moving quickly down the stairs...John pissed..Deborah feeling the futility of anyone understanding her point even as she makes it. \nDEBORAH \nShe's right between the two sizes..I thought about it..what am I supposed to do encourage her...what is it? - DENIAL? Or motivate her to get herself in shape. Flor tries to slide by..Something surreptitious in her behavior..Deborah suddenly turns to Flor. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nFlor.. She holds out her hand in a \"we women understand\" gesture. Flor does not waver..just meets her eyes. \nFLOR \nMe puedo ir?..go..can go? \nDEBORAH \n(a bit nonplussed) Sure. Go. \nJOHN \nI'll drive you to the bus stop. And that fast they are gone. \n52   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           52 \nAs John gets in his seat..then sees Flor approaching the door and hops out to open her door...apologizing as he goes. \nJOHN \nSorry. I'm cracking. As he moves back to his side of the vehicle. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \n(a shout) Shiiiiiiit! Flor hears this from inside and nods in agreement. \n53   INT. JOHN'S CAR - EARLY EVENING..                            53 \nAs they drive down the canyon. He is wildly frustrated. Even if Flor were not there, he would be talking to himself anyway, in the manner of bag ladies and all of us. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nI am running out of excuses for the lady of the house. Flor doesn't understand his words...yet fully agrees. But then John takes rein of his emotions. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nBut you know, you gotta watch out for the times you think you're absolutely right..But, man, Bernice has finals tomorrow. She didn't need this one..And just that look on her face when she got the gifts-- (now his voice cracks; he grows wet-eyed) --like for a second she thought all her problems with her mother had been solved... Flor is flabbergasted..she peeks to see if he is actually crying. At first her heart is touched by John but then there is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the macho meter can read that low. He looks at her and she faces front quickly. \nNARRATOR \nMy mother did not understand her male boss. His heart was good and he was rare in not flirting with her. But they were starkly different. Privacy and dignity were the same word to my mother. Naturally, when she found herself sitting next to a man who cried over his child's hurt she had no idea how to process the event. Meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the canyon. Flor takes the opportunity to bolt. \nFLOR \nGracias. She opens the door and starts to get out though the car is still rolling a bit... \nJOHN \nWhat are you doing? Let me take you all the way. Reluctantly she re-enters the car..It rolls another ten feet to her bus stop and she gets out again. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nHow weird was this ride? Sorry. \nFLOR \nNo es nada. He doesn't quite know what that means...indicates same in a little helpless gesture.. \n54   EXT. BUS STOP - EARLY EVENING..                             54 \nAs Flor is dropped off...the goodbye awkward. \nNARRATOR \nThe job was taxing her. She had no template for confusion let alone frustration. While waiting for the bus, Flor suddenly turns and runs a few yards...and then back..and waves off the looks from her colleagues - many of whom are overweight..many of them adorable. All puzzled for the moment as they watch Flor unsuccessfully try to shake off her day. \n55   INT. FLOR'S APT. - EVENING                                  55 \nAs Flor enters -- kisses her daughter..distraught and distracted. She walks immediately to the refrigerator and takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk...she cuts a huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled daughter..in Spanish riding her on being too thin..the daughter gestures at her mother's own slim figure. \nCRISTINA \nWow...\"John Clasky es el mejor chef en Los Estados Unidos.. \nFLOR \n(easily) Ah, bravo... \n74   INT. CLASKY MASTER BEDROOM - DAY.                            74 \nThe Claskys are engaged in sex. John's brief sounds are exuberant..they shift position so that Deborah is on top BRINGING DEBORAH INTO A CLOSE SINGLE. Suddenly her smile fades - she hits the skids. \nDEBORAH \nOh, damn it --- what am I going to do? Everything seems so surely pointless... \nON JOHN. \nThis IS WEIRD. And then the small, distinctive sound of Deb's climax...then, in a relatively small voice. \nDEBORAH'S VOICE \nOkay here...okay there...good, good, good. She falls off him...an arm across her eyes, lying on her back down the bed from him... \nON JOHN. \nPuzzling over what just happened..a few false starts forming his thought...then finally..hesitantly... \nJOHN \nHey, Deb? \nDEBORAH \n(from the vortex of depression) Yeah? He scoots to her side. \nJOHN \nYou know, I guess I got used to you getting a little blue after intercourse...But DURING..?? \nDEBORAH \nSomething else I do wrong. She grabs something and starts walking toward the bedroom. \nJOHN \nYou've gotta stop walking away. \nDEBORAH \n(turning) If I stay, I will say awful things to you that I might not even mean..You pick. \nJOHN \nSee ya. She exits to the bathroom. \n75   INT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY.                                    75 \nVery upset as he drives. Then comes to the red light at the end of the street and sees Flor walking with others. An awkward beat as he waits for the light to change and they acknowledge each other..the light remains red..she confers with another woman. \nFLOR \n(to woman) Yo le\u00cc la cr\u00cctica buena. The woman tells Flor how to say it in English. \nFLOR (CONT'D) \n(parroting woman) I read your good review. He nods..still the light doesn't change. \nFLOR (CONT'D) \nIt's nice. The light changes. \nJOHN \nNot so far...How you doing? The light has changed - cars are beeping..she is about to let him go off but realizes he will wait for her answer. \nFLOR \nI do fine. He nods and drives off. \n76   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY                                     76 \nAs he enters....the phone is going off the hook..As he passes the maitre d's desk. Their conversation is strangely hushed and very, very quick. \nVICTOR \nShould I stop answering? We're booked for two months solid. \nJOHN \nNo, no, no, no, no....I want to keep some walk-in business..I want this to stay neighborhood. \nVICTOR \nImpossible. There would be riots..You should hear the desperation in their voices..Best day of my life. \nJOHN \nWe'll serve a full menu at the bar then. \nVICTOR \nThen where do I put the people waiting for a table? It won't work. \nJOHN \nDo this for me. \nVICTOR \nThere's no way. \nJOHN \nDo this for me or I'll set my hair on fire and start punching myself in the face. \nVICTOR \nHuh? \nJOHN \nYeah..you're right...that was an unusual way for me to make myself understood..But you'll do the bar thing? \nVICTOR \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nGorgeous, huh..Pretty, fabulous, beautiful. What word is the same in Spanish? \nFLOR \nFabuloso. \nDEBORAH \n(taking it as a compliment) Thanks. \n84   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                       84 \nAs Deborah, Flor and Evelyn enter. They carry boxes of stuff. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nI don't care if it's a rental..this place is getting a fixing. She leads Flor to a small bedroom. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \n(to Flor with gestures) This will be yours.. Flor doesn't understand..certainly doesn't want to. \nEVELYN \nDid you ask her if she could live in? \nDEBORAH \nCome on...there's no buses from her to here. There's no question. Double come on... Deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like the law vs. the bible then with heavy sarcasm. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nThe Barrio - Carbon Beach..The Barrio - Carbon Beach. What to do? (to Flor) Don't worry. I'm putting nicer stuff in here too. When Flor gives no indication of anything - just standing, somewhat stupefied..Deborah takes her by the hand and leads her out. \n85   EXT. CLASKY - BEACH RENTAL - DAY                            85 \nAs they move through a little courtyard area toward the street. \nDEBORAH \nYou must learn English. Why won't she learn English? I'm going to have to learn, \"you must learn English,\" in Spanish. \nEVELYN \nI think Flor is perfect and we should do all we can to keep her from changing. \nDEBORAH \nGee, you took the words right out of my mouthay. \n86   EXT. PCH - DAY                                               86 \nAs she leads Flor along the highway side of Carbon Beach - passing houses until she sees a Hispanic man washing someone's car in a driveway. Evelyn is many steps back. \nDEBORAH \nOh, good. Do you speak English? \nHISPANIC MAN \nYes, I do. \nDEBORAH \nWould you translate for me? He looks at Flor..my God. \nHISPANIC MAN \nSure...forever. He speaks to her in Spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment. Flor, in full control, says, in Spanish..\"Would you please just find out what she wants.\" Evelyn joins them. \nDEBORAH \nWait till I say something before you start in.. (he looks at her) I rented a house here for the summer and now she must sleep at the house because of the bus schedule. He translates along with Deborah's speech. \nON FLOR. \nStricken. She turns to Deborah. \nFLOR \nNo.. Sorry. \nDEBORAH \nWhat? Why? Flor talks briefly in Spanish. \nHISPANIC MAN \nShe can't because of her daughter. \nDEBORAH \nYou have a daughter? You have a whole daughter you haven't mentioned..How old? \nFLOR \nTwelve. \nDEBORAH \n(to Evelyn) It's a little crazy that I don't know that. The man translates. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \n(to man) Don't translate asides. The man says in Spanish to Flor..\"You work for her?\"--Flor answers, \"just tell her that I can't live here.\" Deborah doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nHey! \nHISPANIC MAN \nShe can't live here. Her daughter. \nDEBORAH \nOkay.. (beat then big decision) Her daughter can also live with us for the summer.. The man tells Flor..she answers directly to Deborah.. \nFLOR \n(big decision) No, sorry. \nDEBORAH \nHis kind eyes. \nFULL SHOT.. \nThis is real eye contact..two vaguely humiliated people finding real company for an instant. Without thought, she duplicates his gesture and pats his back. \nFLOR \nSimp\u00e1tico, yes. And when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she is out of her chair..(This is as intimate as John has been with another woman since he was married..) He calls out to stop her. \nJOHN \nUn momento, huh? She stops and turns to him. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nI'm really sorry this is happening. I just want you to know that. I am real sorry. He taps his heart as an indication of sincerity -- then a flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nI didn't mean.. He makes a gesture of ardent love.. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nI meant.. Makes a person to person innocent gesture..She finds herself smiling. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nWell, the good thing about being an idiot is that every once in a while you cheer people up..Got to get to work. \nCAMERA STAYS WITH FLOR \nAs he exits...thinks about John's demeanor, smiles again, shakes it off as her mind fills with concern for Cristina. \n101   EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - SUNSET.                    101 \nDeborah's SUV loaded at the curb..She and Cristina begin to carry things in...(NOTE: Cristina's hair has been restyled.) \n102   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY                        102 \nEvelyn, Bernie and Flor are gathered in the living room. All staring at her. \nDEBORAH \nWhat? Something bad happen? \nON CRISTINA.. \nEnormously anxious on reading her mother's mood. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nCristina, tell your mother I just played around with your hair..she can put it back..no hurt feelings. \nCRISTINA \nNot right now. Flor puts an arm around her shoulder, leading her off and speaking to her forcefully in Spanish. \nDEBORAH \nWhat? -- \nEVELYN \nYou can't just take someone else's..... \nDEBORAH \nNuh-uh, Mom..don't go there..or I'll go there and you know where \"there\" is. Evelyn stops on a dime. She leaves. Deborah crosses to Bernice, who is highly concerned about Flor, and puts an arm around her. A pleasant surprise.. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nCan you believe what Flor is making this into..Shoot me if I ever get that hard to deal with. Bernice, unseen by Mom, does a long, muted, mock scream. \n103   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - EVENING                                  103 \nMUSIC IN: Action, purpose, energy.. Flor is dictating in Spanish as Cristina writes it down in English on a pad. Cristina enormously uncomfortable. \nINSERT - THE PAD. \nThe pad, in effect, lends subtitles to Flor's words. Cristina winces with the words she records even while punctuating perfectly. \nPAD WRITING \nYou cannot take my child without my permission..And, if you had asked me I would not have given permission. Is this why you did not ask? Because you knew this. You have no rights over my private life. \nON FLOR.. \nReaching a decisive conclusion. \nPAD \nIf you have any disagreement with this, I no longer wish to work here. \nON CRISTINA'S LOOK \nThis is awful news. \nON FLOR. \nFor a decisive nod of affirmation. She adjusts her daughter's hair to the way it was, takes the note and exits. \n104   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY          104 \nFlor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter out to Deborah, who hates being cornered in this manner. She actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note. \nDEBORAH \nWhat's this? Flor shakes the letter at her. \nOTHER ANGLE.. \nShowing Cristina hidden but looking on... like a stage prompter in the wings. \nFLOR \nFor you. \nDEBORAH \nFrom? Flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own chest. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nYou are not yourself...This was written in anger. You sleep on it and then if you still want me to have it -- fine..I don't think you will once calm and rational thought returns. Just sleep on it. Deborah exits to a bathroom and closes the door...leaving Flor in the hall with the letter..Cristina reveals herself and explains the situation to her mother. The last word we hear before scene's end is \"ma\u00f1ana.\" \nJOHN \nOh my God, you found a blue..Nobody finds a blue..You know how a blue happens? I mean, before the ocean blasts it for 30-40 years. Somebody had to throw away an old Milk of Magnesia bottle. You know what Milk of Magnesia is? \nCRISTINA \nUnfortunately. He smiles broadly. The kid's a trip. He likes her. \nJOHN \nSo how much for the whole deal? \nCRISTINA \n(unable to look at him) Eleven hundred and one dollar. He reacts..then.. \nJOHN \nOkay. We'll finish dealing with it when I get home from work. She gasps.. \n114   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - ONE A.M.                                114 \nFlor asleep -- Cristina awake, alert..footsteps. She hears John enter. She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor. \n115   INT. HALLWAY - ONE A.M.                                    115 \nAs she enters from the back room and sees that John is walking into the kitchen. Her eye goes to the hall table on which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it. \n116   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - ONE A.M.                             116 \nJohn enters the bedroom to find a note from Deb that she will be late. He is disappointed. \n117   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT - ON CRISTINA                     117 \nNot aware of being observed..opens the envelope and takes out a thick wad of cash..almost swoons..as she goes about hiding it..she is jolted by her mother's whispered incredulity... \nFLOR \nCristina.. She turns...the wad of money in her hand.. \n118   INT. POCKET KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT                           118 \nThe best chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a salve to his spirits. It's a little like Dagwood Bumstead as a culinary genius..This is a snack we will remember and copy...John is approaching a perfect moment...and this is a guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest... \n119   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                            119 \nHe carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just about to take his first bite when he hears emotional Spanish voices approaching. He looks up. \nANGLE ON FLOR AND CRISTINA \nAs they enter. Cristina translating her mother's words. \nCRISTINA \nMy mother wishes me to represent exactly what she says, nothing else. \nAnd so, for the remainder of the scene, Flor will speak in Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. It is not only a translation but a reenactment. \nCRISTINA AS FLOR \nMay I talk to you? \nJOHN \nYou mean your mother.... Cristina nods...not comfortable breaking the rule of only speaking for her mother...She faces him, her back to Flor. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \n(looking at Flor) Sure you can talk to me.. Cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in Spanish.. \nCRISTINA AS FLOR \nI don't have to sleep first? \nJOHN \nWhat's wrong? Flor waves the money..Cristina waves an empty hand as she speaks for her mother. \nCRISTINA AS FLOR \nDid you give this money to my daughter? \nJOHN \nI made this little deal..with all the kids to... \nCRISTINA AS FLOR \n(interrupting) Please.. Flor advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now translates from the background. \nCRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D) \nYou don't tell or ask the mother when you give a child a fortune for looking on the beach for stones..what is the word for this.. \nJOHN \nSea glass? On hearing the translation of \"sea glass\" an exasperated Flor turns so that her back is to John as Cristina admonishes him. \nCRISTINA AS FLOR \nNo..not a name for the stones..a name for the act..what you did.. \nON FLOR.. \nAs she spits out the word to her daughter. \nFLOR \nEngre\u00ccdo. \nON JOHN.. \nAs his eyes shift to Cristina fearing the word he will hear. \nJOHN \nOh, no..engre\u00ccdo's going to be rough. \nON CRISTINA.. \nReluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to deliver the word. \nCRISTINA \n(briefly being herself) It's hard to translate. She takes half a beat..finds the word and now spits it out. \nFLOR \nIt is too far from our home. \nDEBORAH \nYou could move in with us in town. \nFLOR \nNever, thank you... \nDEBORAH \nOkay, then don't..By the way..the phrase is \"NO, thank you.\" \n132   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 132 \nFlor has her earphones on listening to her English tapes..but she is enormously upset as she watches her daughter passionately pray in English..soon taking off the ear phones. \nCRISTINA \nPlease, dear God..Enter my mother's heart and make her understand what this school would mean. \nFLOR \nAlright. I look. \nCRISTINA \nAmen. \n133   EXT. L.A. PUBLIC SCHOOL - FLOR AT CRISTINA'S SCHOOL - DAY 133 \nSummer session - L.A. public school..ninety percent Hispanic. Through Flor's POV, the place is seen not as crowded and worn but as vibrant with community. \n134   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL - FLOR AT BERNICE'S SCHOOL - DAY     134 \nHighly anxious and out of place, she sees the upper-scale students..five percent Latino...No brochure can do it justice. Overwhelmed by the implications, Flor's eyes tear. \n135   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT                            135 \nCristina sleeps. Flor sits on her bed - no thought of sleep. \n136   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                            136 \nJohn enters, home from work ... as he passes Flor's door it opens and she steps out. Before she can continue on, she sees Evelyn at the foot of the stairs, carrying a glass of port. \nEVELYN \nHi, Flor, want some port? \nFLOR \nNo, thank you, Evelyn. \nEVELYN \n(going up stairs) Thanks for never judging me..Love you. Love everybody. That's what's killing me.. Sleep well. \nEVELYN'S POV. \nShe sees Flor approach John. Evelyn looks thoughtful. \n137   INT. DEN - LATE NIGHT                                    137 \nJohn is about to pour himself a stiff drink. Flor startles him. \nFLOR \nMay I talk with you? \nJOHN \nMe? (she nods) Deborah will be home soon. I just talked to her. \nFLOR \nI need real talk..Is it okay? John does not answer immediately. The brief pause is noted. \nFLOR (CONT'D) \nNo? \nJOHN \nSure. \nFLOR \nOutside? Private? \nJOHN \nSure..... (as they exit to beach with a nervous laugh) You have me a little worried... He glances back, hoping to have his fears assuaged, they are not. \n138   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                       138 \nHe sits..she stands, gorgeous..The wind gusts periodically blowing her dress against her body. He tries not to notice. \nFLOR \nYou know about Cristina and your great school? \nJOHN \nOh, it's happened. Is it driving you nuts? \nFLOR \nYes, nuts. I have no idea what to do. Such an important thing. \nJOHN \nYeah. \nFLOR \nIt's a good school? \nJOHN \nTops. It's tops. \nFLOR \nThrough the unusual center window we see Flor and Cristina. Flor, at this moment, is assimilating against every fiber in her body. Cristina is excited, certain her life is taking an incandescent turn. Quite a contrast. \n140   EXT. STONE CANYON AND SUNSET - MORNING                    140 \nAs the bus stops...Bernice is across the street, along with some other kids and Deborah, who is wearing her running clothes..Flor and Cristina exit the bus... \nBERNICE \n(calling) You just made it...I was getting worried.. Deborah has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to Cristina.. \nDEBORAH \nI picked up your books yesterday.. (by way of explanation to Flor) This is one of Bernie's old..ancient backpacks. Cristina taking it... \nCRISTINA \nOh, thank you.. As she shoulders it and almost falls over.. \nCRISTINA (CONT'D) \n(impressed with the heft) This is a great school. \nDEBORAH \n(to Cristina) I got you a little first-day-at-a- new-school present... A school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain deadline pressure on the transaction. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nIt's from me and....Bernice. (to Flor) Okay? It is a big day. Flor's uncertain reaction is taken as a yes. \nBERNICE \n(dry) What did we get her? Deborah hands Cristina a locket..then, noting Flor's expression. \nDEBORAH \n(to Cristina) It's from ALL of us. Your mother too. \nFLOR \n(to Cristina) It's not from me... \nDeborah does a good-natured \"TAKE\" accepting Flor's reaction as if it where an eccentricity..As Cristina and Bernice board the bus, Cristina generally says goodbye to both women, thereby depriving Flor of her own moment of passage with her daughter. \nDEBORAH \nHave a great year, girls.. (for Flor) This is so great. It fills your heart, doesn't it? Deborah turns and sees Flor has already started doggedly up the hill.. \n141   EXT. STREET - HILL - ANGLE ON FLOR...                       141 \nWalking up the hill, blinking in disbelief at her own fury..Deborah in the background feeling a bit abandoned..Flor keeps walking toward the camera.. \nNARRATOR \nThere is a terrible crisis which comes when your own personality is not equal to the challenge you face. When being who you are no longer works. Deborah has started to jog. As she approaches Flor, she calls for a clear path well in advance. \nDEBORAH \nLeft...left. Flor does not alter course though she does start to walk faster... \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nLeft...left... Deborah is close behind now. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nLEFT! \nSuddenly, Flor breaks into a run..She is lithe and quick. \nON DEBORAH... \nA blink of confusion...then something resembling innate satisfaction as she quickens her gait and...the Race is on. \nANGLE AS DEBORAH DRAWS ABREAST OF FLOR. \nStrangely, she is interpreting this as closeness. She is genuinely warm. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \n(to Flor) Why am I not surprised you're competitive? Deborah looks up the street at a delivery truck. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nOh, they're delivering my table. Flor stays on task ..forces her stride. She just needs to win so very much..that's all..to her current surprise, that's everything... \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nYou are fast.. Better pace yourself though.. Flor, even more upset and provoked by the words now lets it all out... \nON DEBORAH.. \nRealizing she may not be a certain winner...she is concerned as she goes after the rabbit. \nOTHER ANGLE. \nShowing the delivery truck as finish line in the distance... \nVARIOUS SHOTS.. \nFlor fueled by desperation. Deborah, relentlessly gaining, exhilarated. \nTHE FINISH.. \nDecidedly anti-climactic..Deborah draws even -- passes her-- arrives at the house with a large margin of victory. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \n(calling back) I love you for trying. \n142   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                  142 \nShe exits into her home. \nON FLOR.. \nBent over, hands on knees, sweaty, gasping for breath. Flor finally straightens up and, there being no other course, continues her walk up the hill, to work. \nNARRATOR \nWhen people exist under one roof, a tiny society forms..the stuff of \n(MORE) \nNARRATOR (cont'd) novelas: masters and servants unconsciously dancing in lock step so that, when things go wrong, traumas converge. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) \nJohn, better wait a minute. But John hears Deb's crying from upstairs.. \nJOHN \n(concerned) What the hell's wrong? \nEVELYN \nNothing. In all futility, can I urge you not to go up there. But he is already moving quickly up the stairs..As he turns at the top of the stairs WE SEE THE DOOR CLOSE TO BERNICE'S \nROOM. \nON EVELYN.. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) \n(to herself) Denouement. \n152   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT...                           152 \nJohn enters the room on the double...passes Deborah without knowing it..(she is partially obscured by the drape or some such). As he passes....camera HOLDS ON DEBORAH..she is a mess...goopy tear stains..seeing him and his concern brings her grief to a higher ground...a sinner humbled by goodness..a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability... \nJOHN \nDeb..Deb?..where are you? He is about to leave the room...she is about to let him but an instinct leads her astray once more. \nDEBORAH \nHere I am. \nJOHN \nBaby, what? \nDEBORAH \n\"Baby?\" Stay there, John...Sit down..I suddenly get what I have to do...I just have to get the guts. \nJOHN \nIs it absolutely necessary to make it this...this scary..can you just say it? \nDEBORAH \nNot so easy. \nJOHN \n(tender/ready for the big healing) Yeah..come on..it's me. We can talk. \nDEBORAH \nDo I ever hope so...I've been seeing another man for the last eleven weeks and it was nothing and I ended it tonight..At first it was just keeping an eye on the real estate market..Then it was...what? Me being insecure and looking for some ridiculous vali... \nON JOHN... \nA shock victim..he holds up a hand to stop her.. \nJOHN \nGo -- hold on...hold on...I'm missing what you're saying..You can't just keep talking and expect me to follow it when you start the way you did....... \nDEBORAH \nJust what did you hear? \nJOHN \nWell there was the crack in the planet. That was noisy... She looks at him...a solid beat... \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nThere's an actual noise in my head.....no kidding.. Briefly he does the noise... \nDEBORAH \n(slowly) I met him about... John holds up a hand to stop her...he needs to gather himself to hear this..She waits...and waits...as he waits he grows flushed and stunned with dread. Finally a word.. \nJOHN \nYou.. She takes that as a cue to start.. \nDEBORAH \nI met him.. He puts up his hand.. \nJOHN \nIf you talk that fast...I'll never hear you..there's a lot going through my mind....Have you said yet whether you slept with him? \nDEBORAH \nSo far I've just been talking about a flirtation because the really important thing for you to know... \nJOHN \nHave you said yet whether you've had sex with someone else? Because I really am missing most of your words. So help me out here.. \nDEBORAH \nI've been trying to explain that for the first ten weeks there was almost nothing to ... \nJOHN \n(sincerely checking but wild) You still haven't said, right? \nDEBORAH \nIs this your way of... \nJOHN \nThis is my way of...this is my way of asking you whether.. He stops... staggering on the threshold of a diminished future. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nOh man, once I ask it...give me a second. (several beats then some conversational good manners for keeping her waiting) I'm just trying to figure out whether there's any way to avoid knowing..no, damn (quickly closing this argument with himself) There's not... (to her) Okay, you're on..real short answer, huh? Have you had sex with another.. \nDEBORAH \nI know you're very angry? \nJOHN \nIf you truly don't know why I say \"no\" let me at last say the reason. At least that will be a relief. Have you no idea that I.... \nBefore she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dog's snout..Flor loses her thought and tosses the ball. \nOTHER ANGLE. \nAs Chum, now the only happy creature in the house, fetches it and returns. \nJOHN \nLook I have to get out of here right now.. \nFLOR \nGo.. John exits to driveway...Flor makes one last toss..these tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration. \nFLOR (CONT'D) \nGoodbye, Chum. Another toss and Flor follows John out the door. \nON CHUM. \nNo longer happy. He has lost his only easy mark. He stares at the closed door..the ball drops from his mouth to the floor. \n158   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT...                             158 \nJohn is at the car but Flor heads for the gate. \nJOHN \n(as decisive as we've seen him) I'm taking you. \nFLOR \n(with anger) Why?!? \nJOHN \nBecause if I don't -- I'll worry about you and I can't handle that right now, okay? Flor emits a crooning sound. \nFLOR \nAhhhhh. (stunned and worried) I never made that sound over a man before.. \nFlor shudders at her own sappiness as John opens the passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while he is clearly fucked up...She is impatient with his solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..The frustration roiling in her. \nFLOR (CONT'D) \nPlease!?! Mandil\u00f3n. \nOTHER ANGLE.. \nDeborah watching them... \nHER POV. \nHer cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous, soon-to-be ex-housekeeper. \nCLOSE ON DEBORAH.. \nShe trembles under the force of imminent justice. \n159   INT. JOHN'S CAR - LATE NIGHT                                159 \nTwo pissed-off people..jaws set...breathing labored..As the car starts and Flor looks back, she lets out a guttural and explosive shout... \nFLOR \n(a quick and mighty vent) Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii! For John, the first clear thing he has heard in a while.. \nJOHN \nYes! Exactly! Well put! Teach me that word sometime. I can really use it. She nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the anger fires an immediate need..She leans across the seat to deliver an urgent message to him. The words come out exponentially too forcefully. \nFLOR \nI quit this job! His spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her.. \nJOHN \nI quit this job!!!!! As he turns onto Sunset. \nFLOR \nThat's the bus stop. \nJOHN \nI'll take you home. \nFLOR \nNo. Drop me at a bus. \nJOHN \nOh, shut up and stop telling me what to do. \nFLOR \nOkay...then let's do something besides driving me home where my daughter isn't. \nJOHN \nOkay..we'll do something. \nFLOR \nAnd I'm supposed to figure out what because I'm a housekeeper and you don't have to think. \nJOHN \nOh, don't do the class thing, man..You don't know where I come from. \nFLOR \nAlright, I know. But I can't be responsible no more for making sure nothing happens. That's another terrible job I quit. \nJOHN \nWhat are you talking about? I take responsibility for anything within a block. You have nothing to worry about. That's my job. \nFLOR \nExcellent. So you're going to figure out what we do, right? \n167   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT...                          167 \nHe is cooking..He is talking to himself. \nJOHN \nNothing to be nervous about. You are not on a date... (calls out) Hey, Flor? \nFLOR'S VOICE (O.S.) \nYes, John. \nJOHN \nWhat are you doing? She enters the room...dancing a bit.. \nFLOR \nJust lighting candles and picking music. (notices his cooking) Oooh. She gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet dangling...sings along a bit in Spanish. He is uncomfortable anew. The nervousness mounting. \nJOHN \nYou want a drink? She considers the question totally..He is busy cooking..not realizing how weighty she considers his question...finally aware she has not answered and looks at her.. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nHuh? She regards him levelly..then makes her decision. \nFLOR \nNo. He gets out a bottle of vodka. \nFLOR (CONT'D) \nI, uh...don't think you should either. \nJOHN \nThen excuse me, because if I had the equipment I'd inject the vodka. He starts to pour. \nFLOR \nWait! (he stops) I think it is so important that we are each clear-headed. He looks at her..a beat...he puts the vodka away. Flor beams..we have not seen her smile like this for quite some time. \nFLOR (CONT'D) \nIt is very good that you did not ask, \"why?\" \nJOHN \n(quietly) Keep things real, right? \nFLOR \n(impressed) I wouldn't have put it so well. \n168   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - HALF HOUR LATER - NIGHT           168 \nThey sit at a small table in the kitchen..finishing the greatest late-night meal in the history of Western man. \nFLOR \nI will remember every taste..forever. \nJOHN \nTell you the truth..I wanted a shot at cooking for you. (shy/his heart) I'm very glad you liked it. \nFLOR \nIt's something watching you. He looks up at her...she has not been seen like this for a very long time, if ever.. lit up by a man. \nJOHN \nWell, if it's anything at your end imagine over here...scratch that..the last thing you want to hear is somebody going off on your looks. \nFLOR \nDon't be crazy. Tell me every detail. \nJOHN \nOkay, Flor, yes I will...They should name a gender after you..Looking at you doesn't do it..Staring is the only thing that makes sense..and trying not to blink so you don't miss anything. She squeals with laughter..He laughs a little himself and in so doing loses his courage..He looks down at his hands..shyness again belting him a good one..Still looking down. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nLook..forgive me..I'm.....It's just that you are drop-dead, crazy- gorgeous..so much so that I am really considering looking at you again before we finish up here. \nFLOR \nSoon, please. And now he looks at her. \nCLOSE ON FLOR.. \nUtterly open...utterly optimistic...the half second before being swept away. \nFLOR (CONT'D) \nRight now....immediately..we have to dance or kiss. He stands. She stands..He kids just a bit, clowning at weighing the two options and then: \nHIS POV.. \nHer face.. \nJOHN \nNo contest. They kiss. \nFLOR \nYou sure you're not Mexican. \nJOHN \n(smiling/he likes this) What do you mean? \nFLOR \nI meant you talk like a Spanish song. \nJOHN \nYou kiss like a Spanish fly.. (on her confusion) Joking around. I don't know what I'm talking about... \nFLOR \nFLOR \nYes you do. Be honest. \nJOHN \nI'm being honest. (indicates their bodies) Look at us - I think I call it honesty. \nFLOR \nWhat are we going to do -- go home, let our hearts go back in our bodies, see each other a few more times. Make a tragedy out of us.. She kisses him again...starts to cry....looks at him..emits a small cooing sound. \nFLOR (CONT'D) \nAhhhhhhh. (sudden energy) There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have kids...Please, are you ready to go? \nJOHN \n(urgently) No. I'm not. No. (then) Stay put for a second. Stay here. Once our feet touch that floor, I'm going to get too many brain cells back. So don't be in such a hurry. That floor, Flor, is going to eat us alive. (she settles back/he is energized) So you think it was a mistake up to now. (she nods \"yes\") That's rough. She nods again..trying to gut things out...but as her foot touches the floor, she must say one last thing to him. \nFLOR \nThe mistake....I love it. \n173   INT. CLASKY HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT.          173 \nDeborah's face is bleached from crying...the tear ducts of her now brown eyes are parched dry..Evelyn sits eyeing her as she looks through the window at the pre-dawn emptiness of Stone Canyon. In her current shape she would give pause to a staff worker at Promises..a shock victim walking through the rubble after the bomb has dropped. Deborah's voice is scratchy when she speaks. \nDEBORAH \nTell me again why I can't call him on the cell. \nEVELYN \nBesides that he turned it off? \nDEBORAH \nYes. \nEVELYN \nForty messages start to look needy. \nDEBORAH \nMother, you're enjoying this. \nEVELYN \nNo..Definitely not in the way you think. \nDEBORAH \n(staggered) You are enjoying it?!? \nEVELYN \n(rising/honest) I am enjoying actually being of use to my daughter. I am enjoying the fact that I really know how to advise you and the miracle that you are so deeply disoriented that you are gobbling up everything I say. Deborah nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a somewhat new way..as if Evelyn were an actual person instead of an upsetting extension of herself. \nDEBORAH \n(vulnerable) There's one thing I'd like to say to you about you and me. \nEVELYN \nYou don't have to. \nDEBORAH \nI want to. \nEVELYN \nOkay. \nDEBORAH \n(quite vulnerable and appealing) You were an alcoholic and wildly promiscuous woman during my formative years so that I am in this fix because of you. It is your fault. I just needed.. (gestures heart to heart) ..that moment for us. \nEVELYN \nYou have a solid point, dear. But right now the lessons of my life are coming in handy for you. \nDEBORAH \nThere's a car coming.... Evelyn moves to her. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nIt's him...he's got to tell me everything.. Evelyn shakes her head \"no.\" \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \n(wild-eyed) Yes! \nEVELYN \nDo you know that right now you are your own worst enemy..that you can't trust one thought in your brain? \nDEBORAH \nDuh. \nEVELYN \nThen trust me and only allow yourself to say one thing to him..One thing...\"I'm so glad you're back.\" \nDEBORAH \nHuh? \nEVELYN \nYes. \nDEBORAH \n(babbling) But I've got to know whether he touched her - where he touched her - how he touched her - if they broke a sweat --- what they said - who made the first move - how they left it -- if anyone loves anyone or has an intention of making contact in the future - what she wore - how he felt afterwards - whether anyone mentioned me.. (a wail) ..whether they held hands when they left.. The distinct sound of a door opening and closing from downstairs. \nEVELYN \nJust those words I said. If you want a prayer of coming out of this. \nDEBORAH \nLike? \nBERNICE \n(a big grin) Surviving. \nJOHN \nYou're fantastic, Bernie...I love you. \nBERNICE \nIt's a slant... (pause then) Hey..I know there's a lot you went through but I knew all along that Grandma was right about you coming back..I mean totally knew it so I wasn't that worried. But still I... (some emotion out of hiding) I really appreciate it, Dad. Thanks....Stop staring at me..what? You don't know what to say? \nJOHN \nRight. I don't know what to say. \nBERNICE \nJust what you taught me..You're welcome. \nJOHN \nYou're welcome. They kiss. \n178   EXT. STONE CANYON -     MORNING.                           178 \nFlor purposefully walking up the hill.. \n179   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                   179 \nAs Flor enters...walks through a few empty rooms..then once in the kitchen she sees the children and Evelyn are swimming in the pool...she opens the glass door Monica bumped into on interview day. \n180   EXT. CLASKY POOL - DAY.                                    180 \nEvelyn, Bernice and Georgie are in the pool..Cristina, wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading... \nCRISTINA \nHey, mom...Is it okay if we don't leave right away? The others call greetings..save Evelyn who studies the situation and gets out of the pool..Flor is awkward..no idea how to handle this...so she goes direct. \nFLOR \nNo... (as Cristina begins to protest) No..and we must say \"goodbye.\" I don't work here anymore. She then talks Spanish to Cristina..admonishing her not to embarrass them..something about Flor being prepared to go nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but it is said with total calm. \nGEORGIE \nDo I have to get out? \nFLOR \nNo, Georgie..Stay. I think you are a wonderful boy..be good..like you are. There are no monsters. \nGEORGIE \nThanks..thanks. Okay. Bernice climbs out of the pool. Meanwhile, a flabbergasted Cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three word proddings in Spanish. \nBERNICE \n(severely to Georgie) I can't believe you didn't get out. \nGEORGIE \nFlor said. \nBERNICE \n(to Flor) I don't want to get you wet. \nFLOR \nGet me wet. \nBERNICE \n(rushing to hug her) Thanks. Bernice hugs her. Evelyn hugs Cristina.. \nEVELYN \nYou...are...a...trip. \nFLOR \n(to Bernice) You're a beauty. Amazing girl. \nDespite herself, Bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over the display...Now, in the background, we hear a subliminal human voice. Incrementally it will grow louder and be recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom window..Bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as Flor ignores it...Bernice goes to embrace Cristina. \nBERNICE \nMy last chance to have some of you rub off on me.. (Cristina doesn't understand) I'm sorry you're so sad but this could have been so much worse. \nCRISTINA \n(from her depths) How? And now Deborah calling \"Flor\" is getting hard to ignore but Flor manages.. \nEVELYN \n(to Cristina) Why don't you run upstairs and say goodbye to Deborah? Flor flashes a look of thanks. \nFLOR \nI'll be in front. Upset, Cristina runs off. She kisses Bernice..and walks toward the house. As she passes under the bedroom.. \nDEBORAH \nPlease come see me. And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck. Flor glances up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly hears the beginning of their exchange \nDEBORAH'S VOICE \nIt's okay, honey..we'll see each other at school..I'm going to keep an eye on you..I will. Flor enters the house... \n181   INT. KITCHEN - DAY.                                         181 \nShe stands waiting..walks to the hallway and cranes her head to see into rooms, wondering if John is there. Finally, as she passes the stairwell, she sees Cristina on an upper landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina should get her things and meet her out front. Cristina, agitated, moves off to comply...then Deborah appears in the same spot. \nDEBORAH \nPlease stick your head in here for a minute. Flor nods and starts up the stairs... \n182   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                                   182 \nDeborah holds open the door while Flor walks inside..then closes it. \nDEBORAH \n", "test1_input": "BERNICE \nOkay. I'll show you.. She steps behind a closet door to try the clothes on, muttering pessimistically before she does so. CAMERA STAYS ON \nFLOR.. \nBERNICE (O.C.) (CONT'D) \nLovely way to start the day. World's most trim Mexican learns her first sentence and uses it to watch me grrrrunt my way into... And then....silence...Bernie, open mouthed, steps out wearing the clothes which fit like a glove. Flor beams..then laughs at Bernie's reaction as she keeps checking the waist and looks into the mirror. \nINTO MIRROR. \nTo see Bernie in the foreground as Flor looks on..nods approval and leaves. \nON BERNIE.. \nThe fit of the clothes is as mystifying as it is nice..she picks up another shirt..checks the size tag and then studies it a bit. \nCLOSE UP SHIRT.. \nAs Bernie's fingers find the barely visible holes where the buttons have previously been. \n63   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                            63 \nFlor at work..Chum, ball in mouth, comes to her and nudges her. \nFLOR \n(to dog) Lo siento. No. Chum, momentarily depressed, walks away..Bernie enters. She is a bit overwhelmed -- her voice breaking a bit even with one word. \nBERNICE \nHey.. Flor turns..Bernie moves to embrace her. \n64   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER              64 \nAs John comes down the stairs..He looks apprehensive..From the den comes the sound of singing..it stops him from going out the front door as he turns to check it out. \n65   INT. DEN - DAY..                                             65 \nJohn finds Evelyn and Georgie in their night clothes. They are singing an old song...something like \"LUSH LIFE\" - something preposterous for a nine year-old boy..but you can't knock the quality of the voices..world class. They see him and stop. \nEVELYN \nEvery time he has a nightmare, I teach him one of my old songs. That way the nightmares have a purpose. \nGEORGIE \nBut I don't have to sing it for anyone. \nJOHN \nRight. You're clear on that.. \nGEORGIE \nHow many did you sell of this song? \nEVELYN \n(embarrassed in front of John) He likes to know that stuff. \nJOHN \n(to Georgie) She was huge. \nEVELYN \nSeventy-six thousand..which is great for a jazz album. They resume harmonizing. As John leaves, the song lyric making some comment on: \n66    EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                      66 \nAs John, growing tense, walks toward the front gate..Chum proffers a ball and accepts defeat as he bends down to pick up the New York Times. John's body chemistry launches a surprise attack...anxiety and dread...He takes his newspaper to a wire bench in the front driveway..He finds the section..opens to the page..and just like that his life changes forevermore. \n67    INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     67 \nJohn enters..Georgie is going up the stairs..Flor putting out breakfast food. \nEVELYN \nYou okay? \nJOHN \n(strangely) I am okay. (to Flor) Deborah around? \nFLOR \nShe run. John nods and heads upstairs. \n67A \n67A   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY \nHe looks in Bernie's room. She is loading her backpack for school.. \nJOHN \nHey, honey. \nBERNICE \nWhat's wrong? \nJOHN \nNo..nothing...just that.. Georgie enters the scene.. \nGEORGIE \nA kid offered me a trade..Let me show you. \nJOHN \nYeah.. \nHe starts to follow him to his room. \nBERNICE \nDad!!! He can wait. \nJOHN \nNo..It's okay.. \n", "test1_true": "Let him wait..Yours is obviously important. \nGEORGIE \nYou don't even know how important the trade is.. \nJOHN \nLet me just do Georgie.... Here. He hands her the newspaper... \n68   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - GEORGIE'S ROOM                          68 \nWe MOVE with John and Georgie to Georgie's room where he goes to his collectibles..He holds up a card.. \nGEORGIE \nHe says he'll give me any three silvers for him. \nJOHN \nI don't know...This is the one you started with..You really want to give up your first card? Note: this is an involved discussion on both their parts..NOTHING in John thinks it is trivial. \nGEORGIE \nI know..that's why I needed you. \nJOHN \n..this is your favorite.. \nGEORGIE \nI think he'd go higher. \nJOHN \nBut it's not numbers..it's..... They are interrupted by a never quite heard before sound of exultation.. \n69   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                          69 \nFlor and Evelyn jolted..they exit to follow the sound.. \n70   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY                                  70 \nAs they enter holding the paper. She has been smacked in the heart by gleeful and prideful emotions...It is disorienting for her to experience the rush of pleasure. \nJOHN \nFor God's sake..why did you... \nBERNICE \nWHY?!!? CRAZY FATHER, WHY?!? Why aren't YOU screaming?.. \nJOHN \nI'm getting there..just the stunned thing has to get dealt with... \nBERNICE \n(reading from newspaper) John Clasky, who at 25 made his mark on the New York restaurant scene when JAMMED lived up to and survived its silly name, has re- emerged as a young and confident veteran taking chances with his combinations in so subtle a manner..\" \nGEORGIE \nIf he gave me six... \nJOHN \n(catching her excitement) Wait a minute, your sister's talking. Evelyn indicates to Flor that the good news is about John..and so she studies him a bit.. \nBERNICE \n\"...beginning with the succession of appetizers, each one with its own stunning and fully realized agenda, is constantly yet casually daring.\" (emotional and earnest aside) Ah, Dad...this is so great... (to others) Now here's the thing... She tears up...Evelyn rubs Bernie's back..looks at Flor and taps her heart...Flor indicates she should leave and does. Bernice continues reading with a lovely sense of mission and moment. John is taken with his daughter's delivery. \nBERNICE (CONT'D) \n\"Eating at this perfect smaller, passionate restaurant inspires one's own abandonment of caution. To wit: John Clasky is the best chef in the United States.\" \nJOHN \n(genuinely enthusiastic) Look how great you read it. \nBERNICE \n(massive irony) Perfect, Dad. Evelyn and Bernice hug him.. \nEVELYN \nJohn..John...Oh, my God you even look different to me.... \nJOHN \nWhat are you talking about? \nBERNICE \nI wonder what mom will do? \n71   INT.

She rips at her own clothes and then exclaims in passion. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nOooohhch! \n72   EXT.

I'm a fan of your mother's. \nCRISTINA \nI'm Cristina. As all acknowledge each other Deborah tugs at Bernie's top which is half tucked in. \nBERNICE \n(kidding around but right on) No comparisons, please, no comparisons. Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self- deprecation..Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish. \nCRISTINA \nMy mother says it's best if we get out of the way and put our things away. \nJOHN \nHave you ever been to the beach here? \nCRISTINA \nI've never been anyplace but Mexico and Texas.....before today. John goes to a big toy box and opens it up..it is filled with beach paddles, Frisbees and boogie boards. \nJOHN \nHere's the most important place in the house..grab this stuff whenever you want. \nCRISTINA \n(delighted) Thank you..thank you so much. \nDEBORAH \nVery little accent? \nFLOR \n(suspiciously) Que? \nCRISTINA \n(to Flor) Sin acento. \nHer mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with, nods. \nCRISTINA (CONT'D) \n(to Deborah) Thank you..there's an A.P. total fluency class where they work you pretty hard at sounding American. Flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended conversation with Deborah of which she doesn't understand a word. \nFLOR \nCristina.. \nDEBORAH \nRight. Settle in.. \nCRISTINA \nThank you. I am thrilled to be here. \n93   INT.

Cristina looks around -- then up.. \nCRISTINA \nOh, hi..so beautiful..I was just excited. \nDEBORAH \nI know..Would you believe I had to talk my husband into this?

She picks it up. \nINSERT..THE NOTE \nDear Flor, \nI decided to steal your daughter for a bit. \nLOVE, \nDEBORAH \nWith great energy born of bottled fury, Flor begins to go through her daughter's things...finding her backpack and extracting a Spanish/English dictionary. \nINSERT DICTIONARY. \nAs her finger points to: \"Steal...robar\" And then she flips some pages feverishly..Her finger indicating: \"daughter .... hija\" \n98   EXT.

She sits in a chair..He sits not far from her. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nHey, Flor.. Embarrassed, she says, in Spanish, to please leave her alone..she turns from him..He walks to the wet bar and gets a bottle of water...pours some..Her crying soft in the \nbackground...He walks to her, sits near her and offers her the glass of water which she takes. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nDeborah made a mistake.

I must learn English now. \nFLOR \nNo, dije eso por ti - no por John. That translates to \"No, I meant that for you, not John.\" But Cristina does not translate the line. Nor.. \nJOHN \nYou have a wonderful mother. \nFLOR \nQue? \nCRISTINA \nNada. \n120   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 120 \nA Spanish commercial for learning English in a hurry is on television..Flor on the phone ordering it.. \nNARRATOR \nLearning English would cost five hundred and ninety nine dollars down and 15 monthly payments of one hundred and ten dollars...which represents 48 percent interest..Mexicans marketing Mexicans. But not a penny was wasted. \n121   EXT. MAIL BOX - DAY                                        121 \nAs Flor takes a package from the box. \nNARRATOR \nMy mother showed an extraordinary facility for learning the language. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n122   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY                      122 \nFlor listening to the tapes as she does laundry. \nNARRATOR \n..as well as a totally committed, obsessive work ethic, which blocked out all else..She was her daughter's mother. As Flor silently mouths some English while listening to a tape,Chum nudges her with a ball and, without thinking, she takes it from his mouth and tosses it..Realizing, with alarm, a beat too late that she has broken the rule. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n123   EXT. BEACH - LATE AT NIGHT                                 123 \nFlor sitting on the sand...listening to her tapes..continually forced by Chum's obsessive persistence to throw him the ball. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n124   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                              124 \nAs John arrives...He bumps the walls on entering. \n125   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                              125 \nAs John enters the house, clearly drunk.   There is the sound of skittering paws as CHUM approaches. \nJOHN \n(cheering) Hey, boy, I can use some up company. But Chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away. John follows, weaving a bit. \n126   INT. BEACH HOUSE - DEN - LATE NIGHT                        126 \nAs John enters the room to find CHUM proffering the ball to Flor who is watching one of video language tapes. She tosses the ball without a look or a thought..then starts when she sees John standing there. He cheers, seeing her predicament. \nWhen she speaks English, at this point, her words are halting. \nJOHN \nYou gotta do something about Chum..Your arm's going to go. She waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of his way. Chum complicates the task, proffering the ball. Flor wearily throws it. \nJOHN (CONT'D) \nDon't you sleep anymore? \nFLOR \nNo..You get more if you keep at it. \nJOHN \nYou're doing fantastic. \nFLOR \nNow I am like a three year-old. Your wife go out. \nJOHN \nShe say where? \nFLOR \nNo. (on his reaction) Sorry. \nJOHN \nListen..I just forgot she was going out..don't be a smart ass. (jolted by his own remark) Uh-oh..well, you and I communicate mostly in apologies anyway..I'm sorry. I should be whipped. I should be stoned- it's been a while - I meant to say, I think, don't be smart, don't be kind, don't be sensitive, don't be beautiful. I meant to say, \"hi, Flor, good night Flor..that show you're watching is going to be a hit.\" He staggers out. Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and then urgently gestures Chum to join him. Chum is reluctant, but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master. Flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of John in the den. He is younger and smiling. She studies the picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and purposefully goes back to her lessons. \n127   EXT. P.C.H. - LA SALSA FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY.            127 \nCristina and Bernice waiting in line at the Mexican fast food place on P.C.H. with the towering signature Mexican male figure on its roof. Deborah is parked curbside in the SUV. \nBERNICE \nHow'd you get your mother to let you go with my mother? \nCRISTINA \nWell, your mother just said she could use my help on a few errands while you're in class... Bernice nods. Then unconsciously moans. \nCRISTINA (CONT'D) \nWhat? \nBERNICE \n", "test3_true": "CRISTINA \nWhy do you go then? \nBERNICE \n(looks at her) I'm not sure I can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class..in this case math...and the system kind of insists on the illusion that you've learned math -- so they make you go to summer school..It helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission. \nCRISTINA \nWhat do you mean they failed? \nBERNICE \nJoking. \nCRISTINA \nOh. I see. Forgive me, I don't have a real sense of humor. \nBERNICE \n(looking skyward) Thank you, God. (on Cristina's reaction) Joking... \nCRISTINA \nThe joke is? \nAs they get in the car..Bernice doing a little stutter step offering Cristina the front seat..Cristina demurs. \n128   INT. SUV - DAY.                                            128 \nAs they get in..Deborah privy to the conversation now. \nBERNICE \nThat you're better at everything than I am...and I was thanking God for there being this one thing where I might have my nose in front. Deborah can't think of what single thing Bernice could possibly feel superior about. She is genuinely puzzled. \nDEBORAH \nAnd that thing is??? Bernice deeply resents the question..She turns to her mother. \nBERNICE \nSexual experience.. Cristina laughs. \nBERNICE (CONT'D) \n(ruefully to self) That one even she knows is funny. Cristina gives Bernice an appreciative push from behind. Deborah, for some reason, feels she deserves credit for their connection. \nDEBORAH \nLook at you girls. \n129   INT. BEACH BEDROOM - DAY                                   129 \nDeb working an outfit..her mother eyeing her.. \nDEBORAH \nCristina's already read, on her own, everything on Bernice's summer reading list..And she's two grades behind..Imagine if she went to Bernice's school..And they'd kill to give her a scholarship. \nEVELYN \nTalk to Flor... \nDEBORAH \n(sarcastic) Yeah..she's so open to new things. \n130   EXT. GORGEOUS PRIVATE SCHOOL -DAY.                          130 \nDeborah and Cristina standing in a grass bordered parking lot...Deborah, feigning upset, tearing into her bag but her focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off. She is clearly stalling. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nCan't find my keys.. Another woman, ARLENE FOLSOM, calls to her.. \nARLENE \nDeborah... \nDEBORAH \n(acting surprised) Hi, Arlene.. (to Cristina) Come on. They walk to greet Arlene. \nDEBORAH (CONT'D) \nHi. This is Cristina..the girl I'm always raving about..This is Arlene Folsom..the school director. \nARLENE \nHi.. \nCRISTINA \n(Barbara Boxer couldn't do it better) Hello..a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Folsom. I couldn't believe how beautiful the grounds were as we drove in. I just think the balance of the buildings to open ground is so wonderful and must have been very difficult to achieve. Deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression Cristina is making..all are grinning...the two adults suspiciously so...sharing their delight. \nARLENE \nWould you like a little tour? \nMOVING CAMERA.. \nFirst showing Cristina in foreground and her POV of this Drop Dead Gorgeous Rich Kids School in the background and then we MOVE CLOSER ON CRISTINA. We see lust in her reaction. \nNARRATOR \nThe experience was literally mind boggling. My mind did boggle. My cranial cells stunned. Even if I had enough sense of wonder to imagine such a school existed; my sense of fairness made it unthinkable that any school could offer this much more than my own.. \n131   INT. BEACH LIVING ROOM - DAY                             131 \nThis is the last day of the summer rental - many packed cartons on the floor. Deborah, Flor and Cristina engaged in a momentous conversation..(NOTE: Throughout the following, and quite beside the point, we see Flor periodically make the motion of throwing the ball. But we do not cut to Chum, rather we just hear his claws skittering after the ball as we maintain focus on the momentous conversation.) \nDEBORAH \nNuh-uh, Flor you are not pinning this one on me. I've got to finish packing up. \nFLOR \n(no longer sure of herself or anything) I just don't....Out of space this school wants her to go for free? \nDEBORAH \nWe ran into the school head. They want diversity...Cristina knocked her out...I had nothing to do with it. By the way, the scholarship is worth twenty thousand dollars. And early registration is tomorrow. \n", "test3_id": 170}

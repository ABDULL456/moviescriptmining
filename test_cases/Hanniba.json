HE OPENS THE DOOR, AND THE OLD MEN OF THE STUDIOLO EXIT, CHATTERING HAPPILY ABOUT THE LECTURE.  FELL COMES OUT, THE LAST OF THE SALON. \nFELL (cont'd) Would you say that I've preserved my job, Commendatore? \nPAZZI I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they... \nFELL Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...? \nPAZZI I require... \nFELL ...yes, yes, yes... \nHE FOLLOWS FELL BACK INTO THE ROOM, WHERE FELL BEGINS PUTTING AWAY HIS MATERIAL IN THE D1RTY SALON. \nFELL (cont'd) ...the effects of my predecessor. \nPAZZI I'd like to walk home with you, and... \nFELL Yes, of course, and we'll collect them. I won't be a minute... \nANGLE ON PAZZI AS HE WALKS UP TOWARD FELL. \nHE PUTS HIS HAND IN THE JACKET POCKET. \nANGLE INS \nTHE HAND, SEEN THROUGH THE CLOTH, GRIPPING THE AUTOMATIC PISTOL. \nANGLE \nON FELL, AS HE BEGINS TO PACK UP THE SLIDE PROJECTOR, AND THEN HESITATES. \nFELL (cont'd) Ah, no.  I should have shown them this one.. (HE TAKES OUT A SLIDE AND PUTS IT IN THE PROJECTOR) This one will interest you:  let me see if I can improve the focus... \nWE SEE THE IMAGE OF A HANGED MAN APPEAR ON THE DROPCLOTH. THERE IS A PLAQUE DRAPED AROUND THE NECK OF THE HANGED MAN. \nFELL (CONT'D) Can you make it out, can you make out the name on the plaque? \nFELL WALKS UP TO THE IMAGE DISPLAYED ON THE DROPCLOTH, PAZZI WALKS BEHIND HIM. \nFELL (cont'd) (LOOKING AT THE IMAGE) It says Pazzi.  Pazzi.  And a rude, a very rude poem, this is your ancestor. Francesco, hanging outside the Palazzio Vecchio.  Outside These Very Windows. \nHE TURNS AND FIXES PAZZI WITH HIS GAZE. \nANGLE, FELL, HIS FACE SEEN IN THE DARK, IN THE BEAM OF THE SLIDE PROJECTOR. \nHOLD. \nFELL (cont'd) On a related subject Signor Pazzi, I must confess to you:  I'm giving serious thought to eating your wife. \n", "test3_id": 251}

A SUPERVISOR COMES IN. 
SUPERVISOR I'm sorry, I believe It'll take us four or five hours to... you know, f'you want, I'll be glad, transfer your load... 
BELLA ...thank you, but we got that thing palletted in there, pretty good, and... I, uh, I don't want to change it, I'd rather wait. 
SUPERVISOR No problem, just thought I'd make the offer... 
HE WITHDRAWS.    PAUSE. 
BELLA I figure, we can't be any safer than in here.

FRAN Is he going to be alright? 
BELLA Well, you know, he's gonna have a headache. (PAUSE) Or is that what you're asking? (PAUSE) In which case, we're way past that. Don't you think? (PAUSE) Because lemme run this down to you: And you tell me the error in my logic. One: an old man. On the run. Might as well have his face on a Postage Stamp. N'he's looking for his money. Two: You and me. For example: (HE LOOKS ACROSS AT THE TRUCK) And the prize in the Crackerjack. (PAUSE) And a wet afternoon to kill. Talking about it.

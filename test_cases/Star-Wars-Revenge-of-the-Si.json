{"train": "STAR WARS EPISODE 3: REVENGE OF THE SITH SCRIPT \nGeorge Lucas \n1 EXT. SPACE \nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. \nA vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity. \nWar! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere. \nIn a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate. \nAs the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . . \nPAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet. \n2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE \nOBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently. \n3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE \nANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER. \nANAKIN: There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . . \nOBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . . \n4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE \nThe TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame. \n5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE \nOBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship. \nOBI-WAN: We've got to split them up. \nANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower. \nOBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow. \nOBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait? \nANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you. \nOBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire. \nOBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me! \nANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . . \nARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES. \nANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo! \nANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning. \nANAKIN: I copy, Artoo. \nOBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck. \nANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver. \nOBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN. \nANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on! \nARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER. \nOBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don't like this! \nOBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch! \nR-4 BEEPS a blue streak. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down. \nANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him . . . \nANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight. \nANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo. \nOBI-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ... \nR-4 BEEPS a blue streak. \nANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. \nARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit. \nANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids. \n6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE \nARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, \"WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.\" \nANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo. \nANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH. \nANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through. \nOBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION. A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space. Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS. \nODD BALL: There are too many of them. \nCLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . . \nANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out! \nOBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship! \nAnother CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them. \nANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up! \nANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot. \nOBI-WAN: They overshot us . . . \nThe second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan\u0092s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them. \nANAKIN: They're coming around! \nOBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy. \nANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters. \nANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide. \nANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo! \nTwo missiles continue to track Obi-Wan. \nOBI-WAN: Flying is for droids. \nSuddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin? \nANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids. \nThe BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR. \nOBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . . \nARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away. \nOBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls. \nANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them. \nOBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here. \nANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan\u0092s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ... \nANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . . \nOBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here. \nANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . . \nOBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin. \nANAKIN: Move to the right. \nOBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do. \nANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master. \nANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view. \nANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID. \nOBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone. \nANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out! \nOBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye. \nARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship. \nANAKIN: Yeah, you got him! \nOBI-WAN: Great, Artoo. \nANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar. \nOBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up? \nANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master. \nCOUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level. \nPALPATINE: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord. \nOBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty. \nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers. \nCOUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor. \nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU. \nOBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku. \nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues. \nCOUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this. \nANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count. \nCOUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall. \nDOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . . \nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better. \nAs the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force. ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking. ANAKIN hits the archway. DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight. \nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don\u0092t use them. \nAnakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense. Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness. \n39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nAnakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat. \nPALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now! \nANAKIN: I shouldn't . . . \nPALPATINE: Do it!! \nANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything. \nANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself. \nPALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive. \nANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE. \nANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. \nANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose. \nANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way. \nPALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists. \nPALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive. \nThe ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators. \nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late. \nANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right. \nPALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it. \nANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours. \nANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators. \n40 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare for attack. \nPILOT: All batteries fire! Fire! \n41 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER \nClone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying. \n42 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him. \nANAKIN: The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . . \nARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN. \nANAKIN: (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224. \nSuddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft. \nANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in! \n43 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nWindows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space. \nANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on. \nOBI-WAN: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod. \nANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes. \n58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nOBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them. \n59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath. \nANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close. \nThey laugh. \n60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nBODYGUARD: General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Activate ray shields. \n61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nThey run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway. \nANAKIN: Ray shields! \nOBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment. \nOBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this. \nANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted. \nOBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault. \nANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero. \nOBI-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here. \nPALPATINE: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release. \nThe Jedi look at each other in disbelief. \nANAKIN: I say . . . patience. \nOBI-WAN: Patience! That's your plan, is it? \nANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . . \nARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself. \nANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem. \nSuddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over. \nSUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this. \nOBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B? \n62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue. \nA BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S lightsabers. \nOBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah! \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older. \nANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . . \nOBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection. \nOBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won't escape. \nANAKIN: Artoo. \nARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around. OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer! \nANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand. \nThe DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's TWO BODYGUARDS. \nCHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations. \nOBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge. OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away. ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor. OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces. ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. \nA large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing. \nOBI-WAN: Another happy landing. \n69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON \nThe small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle. \nANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master? \nOBI-WAN: Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy. \nANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time. \nOBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . . \nANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness. \nOBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians. \nANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . . \nOBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing. \nANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN. The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE. \nMACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right? \nPALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again. \nMACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward. \nPALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive. \nMACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority. \nBAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway. \nBAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough. \nANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway. \nANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of. \nARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd. \nC-3PO: It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. \nARTOO beeps. \nC-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself. \n70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON \nANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them. \nBAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures. \nANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that. \nBehind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure. \nBAIL ORGANA: I'll do everything I can with the Senate. \nANAKIN: Excuse me. \nBAIL ORGANA: Certainly. \nANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss. \nPADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back. \nANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so. \nPADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread. \nANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges. \nANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back. \nPADME: Wait, not here . . . \nHe grabs her again. \nANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married. \nPADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . . \nANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you. \nPADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later. \nANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her. \nANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on? \nPADME: I'm just excited to see you. \nANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it? \nPADME: Anakin?? \nShe gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him. \n76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT \nANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught. PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her. \nPADME: What's bothering you? \nANAKIN: Nothing . . . \nANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy. \nANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you. \nPADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other? \nANAKIN: It was a dream. \nPADME: Bad? \nANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died. \nPADME: And? \nANAKIN: It was about you. \nThey look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them. \nPADME: Tell me. \nANAKIN: It was only a dream. \nPADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath. \nANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . . \nPADME: And the baby? \nANAKIN: I don't know. \nPADME: It was only a dream. \nANAKIN takes PADME in his arms. \nANAKIN: . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme. \nThey embrace, then part. \nPADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order. \nANAKIN: I know \u0085. \nPADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us? \nANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything? \nPADME: No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something. \nANAKIN: He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything! \nPADME: I won't, Anakin. \nANAKIN: I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem. \n77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY \nYODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda 's room, deep in thought. \nYODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . . \nANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . . \nYODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know? \nANAKIN: Someone . . . \nYODA: . . . close to you? \nANAKIN: Yes. \nYODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side. \nANAKIN: I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda. \nYODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is. \nANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda? \nYODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose. \n78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY \nANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting. \n79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY \nANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps. \nANAKIN: How are you feeling? \nPADME: He keeps kicking. \nANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it's a boy? \nPADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition. \nShe puts his hand on her belly. \nANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl. \nThey laugh. \nPADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you. \nANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master. \nPADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills. \nANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem. \nPADME: Anakin . . . \nANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic. \nPADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? \nANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean? \nPADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy? \nANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist! \nPADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume. \nANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy! \nPADME: What is it? \nANAKIN: Nothing. \nPADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you. \nANAKIN: You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you. \nThey look in each other's eyes. \nANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me. \nPADME is startled at this. \nPADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me. \nPADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed. \nPADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war. \n88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT \nANAKIN lands his speeder and exits. ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House. ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing \"Squid Lake.\" \nANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor. \nPALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system. \nANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war. \nPALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far \u0085 but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing. \nANAKIN: They try. \nPALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us. \nANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him. \nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will. \nANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand. \nPALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me. \nANAKIN: I don't think . . . \nPALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you? \nANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . . \nPALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter. \nANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken. \nPALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? \nANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down. \nPALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they? \nANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say. \n91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY \nYODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform. \nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: The droids have started up their main power generators. \nYODA: Then now the time is, Commander. \nCLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, sir. \nThe battle begins. \n92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY \nA WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle. \n93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING \nPadme's apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant. \n94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING \nPADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches. \nOBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you? \nPADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council. \nOBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted. \nThey laugh. \nPADME: You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it? \nOBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme. \nPADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings. \nOBI-WAN: It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you. \nPADME: Why would he talk to me about his work? \nOBI-WAN studies her. \nOBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either. \nPADME: Don't give me that look. \nOBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you. \nPADME: (nervous) What did he say? \nOBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn't have to. \nPADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony. \nPADME: I don't know what you're talking about. \nOBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him. \nPADME looks down and doesn't answer. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . . \nThey stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . . \nPADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan. \nOBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him. \n95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY \nPADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme's living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests. \nPADME: We cannot let this turn into another war. \nBAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want. \nMON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all. \nPADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult. \nBANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous. \nMON MOTHMA: We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this. \nPADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust. \nGiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky. \nPADME: The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . . \nCHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator. \nFANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor. \nBANA BREEMU: When you present the \"petition of the two thousand\" to the Chancellor, things may change. \nPALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator. \nANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!? \nPALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator. \nANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know. \nPALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see. \nANAKIN becomes worried. \nPALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine. \n102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM \nPADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her. \nOBI-WAN: Save your energy. \nPADME: I can't! \nOBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . . \n103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY \nANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him. \nANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he? \nPADME: He came by this morning. \nANAKIN: What did he want? \nPADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense. \nPADME: He's worried about you. \nANAKIN: You told him about us, didn't you? \nShe continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows. \nPADME: He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress. \nANAKIN: And he's not? \nPADME: You have been moody lately. \nANAKIN: I'm not moody . . . \nPADME: Anakin! Don't do this again. \nANAKIN: I don't know ... I feel . . . lost. \nPADME: Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand. \nANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me. \nPADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son. \nANAKIN: Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't. \nPADME: You expect too much of yourself. \nThey stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly. \nANAKIN: I have found a way to save you. \nPADME: Save me? \nANAKIN: From my nightmares. \nPADME: Is that what's bothering you? \nANAKIN: I won't lose you, Padme. \nPADME: I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you. \nANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying. \nPADME looks ANAKIN in the eye. \nPADME: You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are. \nThey embrace and kiss. \n104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE \nOBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes. \n105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY \nOBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON. \nTlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary? \nOBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war. \nTlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you've brought it with you. \nOBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku! \nOBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies. \nOBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed. \nOBI-WAN: I don't think so. \nTWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him. \n113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY \nMore CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS. The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on. \n114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY \nThe chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga. \n115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET \nThe sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red. \n116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET \nPALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE. \nPALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate. \nPADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution? \nPALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . . \nPADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then. \nPALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here. \nFANGZAR: But surely . . . \nThe Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR. \nPALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee. \nPADME: On behalf of the \"delegation of two thousand,\" I thank you, Chancellor. \nPALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator. \nPADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN. \nPALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us. \nANAKIN: What do you mean? \nPALPATINE: They are not to be trusted. \nANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . . \nPALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes. \nANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken. \nPALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things. \nANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala. \nPALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look. \nPALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin. \n117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING \nKI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack. \nMACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions. \nANAKIN: Yes, Master. \nANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears. \nMACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor. \nKl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office. \nMACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . . \nKl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption. \nYODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take. \n118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING \nANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE. \nANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous. \nPALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge. \n124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING \nMACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR's office. ANAKIN enters the hangar. \nANAKIN: Master Windu, I must talk to you. \nMACE WiNDU: What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate. \nANAKIN: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord. \nMACE WINDU: A Sith Lord? \nANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for. \nMACE WiNDU: How do you know this? \nANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side. \nMACE WiNDU: Are you sure? \nANAKIN: Absolutely. \nMACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive. \nANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him. \nMACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment. \nANAKIN: I must go, Master. \nMACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here. \nANAKIN: Yes, Master. \nMACE WiNDU: Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return. \nANAKIN: Yes, Master. \nANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship. \n125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING \n(INTERCUT) \nPADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME. \nPALPATINE: (V.O.) You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost. \nPADME: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know. \nC-3PO: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right? \nANAKIN: I can't do this ... I can't let her die. \nANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off. \n126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING \nThe sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform. FOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across. \n127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING \nThe FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor's aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor's office. \n128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR\u0092S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING \nMACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE. \nPALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected. \nMACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor. \nMACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers. \nPALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi? \nMACE: The Senate will decide your fate. \nPALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate! \nMACE: Not yet! \nPALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI. \nPALPATINE: It's treason, then. \nA close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight. \nJedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down. \nANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor's office. \nIn the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor's desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting. \nThey stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other. \nMACE WINDU: You are under arrest, My Lord. \nPALPATINE: Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over. \nPALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme. \nANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy? \nPALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace. \n131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT \nANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers. \n132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY \nThe battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY. \nOBI-WAN: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Very good, sir. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this. \nHe hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up. \nOBI-WAN: Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Yes, sir! \nOBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole. The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform. \nDARTH SlDIOUS: Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: It will be done, My Lord. \nThe HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Blast him! \nThe battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him. OBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole. \n133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN \nThe sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows. \nDARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . . \nCLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir. \nDARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six. \nCLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord. \nDARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He's killed before he can defend himself. \n134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY \nA column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush. \nAAYLA: Steady. . . . steady . . . \nThey all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi. \nAAYLA: (continuing) Bly, do you think they're Droids? \nBLY: No. \nBLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground. \nAnother Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi away. \n135 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY \nYODA drops his gimer stick, clutches his chest, and rests against a wall. \n136 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY \nThe battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react. \nThe Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES. The cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge EXPLOSION. \n137 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-COCKPIT CLONE FIGHTER-DAY \nThe CLONE PILOT watches a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS. \nDARTH SIDIOUS: Execute Order Sixty-Six. \nCLONE PILOT: It will be done, My Lord. \n138 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-JEDI STARFIGHTER-DAY \nPLO KOON heads his ship toward a battle on a landing platform. \nPLO KOON: There they are. Land on the nearest platform. \n139 EXT. CATO XEIMOIDIA-JEDI STARFIGHTER-DAY \nThe FOUR CLONE PILOTS with PLO KOON drop back and blast him out of the sky. \n140 EXT. SALEUCAMI-FOREST \nAT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there! \nA CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions. \nCREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh) \nCLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something? \nCREATURE: It's nothing, nothing. (laughs) \nCLONE SERGEANT: It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east. \nCLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir. \nSuddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS. \nCREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be. \nTARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda. \nYODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me. \nYODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on. \nYODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . . \nYODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST.

We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command. \nBAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe. \n157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY \nOBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS. \nCLONE CAPTAIN: Did you find Kenobi? \nCLONE TROOPER: No one could have survived that fall. \nHe watches them pass. \nCLONE CAPTAIN: Start loading your men on the ship. \nCLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir. \nOBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs. \n158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY \nOBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous's secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky. \n159 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE \nOBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous's tiny Starfighter. \n160 INT.

Repeat. \nThe FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA. \nBAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi?? \nC-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do? \nPADME: No thank you, Threepio. \nG-3PO: A snack, perhaps? \nPADME: No. \nTHREEPIO starts to move off. \nC-3PO: I feel so helpless. \n163 EXT.

Good to see you. it is. \nOBI-WAN: You were attacked by your Clones, also? \nYODA: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did. \nOBI-WAN: How many other Jedi managed to survive? \nYODA: Heard from no one, have we. \nBAIL ORGANA: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda. \nOBI-WAN: Have we had any contact from the Temple? \nYODA: Received a coded retreat message, we have. \nBAIL ORGANA: It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . . \nOBI-WAN: Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed. \nBAIL ORGANA: It's too dangerous to return. \nYODA: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you? \nOBI-WAN: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened. \nYODA: I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way. \n165 EXT.

OBI-WAN, BAIL, YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit. \nPILOT: We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir. \nBAIL ORGANA: Send it through. \nPILOT: Yes, sir. \nThe PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen. \nMAS AMEDDA: Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress. \nBAIL ORGANA: Tell the Chancellor I will be there. \nMAS AMEDDA: Very well. He will be expecting you. \nMAS AMEDDA's image disappears from the screen. \nBAIL ORGANA: It could be a trap. \nOBI-WAN: No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact. \nYODA: If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be. \n168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY \nOBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out. \nGUARD: Welcome back, Senator.

We will take custody of the Jedi. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree. \nPADME: I'll be all right, Captain. \nHe goes to the speeder and gets in. \nPADME: (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me. \nC-3PO: Oh, dear. \nTYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off. \n192 INT. NABOO SKIFF \nTHREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in. \nC-3PO: Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business. \nOBI-WAN stows away on Padme's ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes. \n193 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-SUNSET \nA HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office at the bottom of the Senate Arena. \nDARTH VADER: The Separatists are taken care of, My Master. \nDARTH SlDIOUS: It is finished, then.

What are you doing out here? \nPADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things. \nANAKIN: What things? \nPADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings. \nANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me. \nPADME: He cares about us. \nANAKIN: Us??! \nPADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you. \nANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough. \nPADME: Anakin, all I want is your love. \nANAKIN: Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that. \nPADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this. \nANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you. \nPADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can. \nANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be. \nPADME: I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed. \nANAKIN: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me. \nPADME: I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can't follow. \nANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan? \nPADME: Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you. \nANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar! \nPADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser. \nPADME: No! \nANAKIN: You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me! \nPADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ... \nView screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room. \nANAKIN: Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side. \nOBI-WAN: I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you. \nANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKIN\u0092s lightsaber as he falls.

The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord's lightning bolts. \nThe energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed. \nYODA: Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy. \nYODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another. \nYODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment. \nYODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium.

He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava. \nANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control panel. ALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN. \n205 EXT.

They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant. \n207 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING CHUTE-NIGHT \nYODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He talks on his comlink. \nYODA: Hurry.

Right away, sir. \nPALPATINE: (to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff. \nMAS AMEDDA: Yes, Master. \nPALPATINE: I sense Lord Vader is in danger. \nPALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway.

At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover. Support for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river. \nIt bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava. \n210 EXT.

Right away. \nSeveral of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN's forehead. \n222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT \nOn the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates. \nYODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ... \nQUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith. \nYODA: Eternal consciousness. \nQUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed. \nYODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is. \nQUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self. \nYODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become. \nYODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation. \nBAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact. \n223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY \nThe CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule.

For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her. \nOBI-WAN: She's dying? \nMEDICAL DROID: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies. \nBAIL ORGANA: Babies??!! \nMEDICAL DROID: She's carrying twins. \nYODA: Save them, we must.

The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY. \nMEDICAL DROID: It's a boy. \nPADME: Luke . . . \nPADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead. \nMEDICAL DROID: ... and a girl. \nPADME: . . . Leia. \nR2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space. \n229 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY \nVADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly.

ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nANAKIN: What was that all about? \nOBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . . \nANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can. \nOBI-WAN: Did I say anything? \nANAKIN: He's trying! \nOBI-WAN: I didn't say anything! \n37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away. \n38 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nThe elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters. At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR. As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face. \nOBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor. \nANAKIN: Are you all right? \nPALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku. \nPALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi. \nOBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together. \nANAKIN: I was about to say that. \n", "test2_input": "MON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic. \nBAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy. \nPADME: I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen. \nGlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate. \nMON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it. \nBAIL ORGANA: We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . . \nPADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid. \nBAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing. \nMON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told. \nThey ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment. \nPADME: Agreed. \n82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY \nANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens. \n83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY \nANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI. \nMACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative. \nANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order. \nYODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine. \nANAKIN: I understand. \nMACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master. \nAnakin reacts with anger. \nANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master? \nMACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker. \nANAKIN: Forgive me, Master. \nANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks. \nKl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous. \nYODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep. \nOBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare. \nMACE: We cannot take ships from the front line. \nOBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup. \nYODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait. \nKl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees? \nMACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately! \nOBI-WAN: He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant. \nANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet. \nMACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous. \nYODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have. \nMACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all. \nANAKIN is disappointed. \n84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON \nANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious. \nANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting! \nOBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs. \nANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . . \nOBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off. \nANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this. \nOBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation. \nANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties. \nOBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it. \nANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve. \n", "test2_true": "ANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie. \nOBI-WAN: I hope so . . . \nANAKIN: I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying. \nOBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you. \nANAKIN: And? \nOBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation. \nANAKIN: What situation? \nOBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to. \nANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason! \nOBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not. \nANAKIN: Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session? \nOBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally. \nANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here. \nOBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired. \nANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer. \nOBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place. \nANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me? \nOBI-WAN: The Council is asking you. \n85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY \nA JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform. \n86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY \nYODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting. \nOBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm. \nYODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers. \nMACE: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him. \nOBI-WAN: He'll be all right. I trust him with my life. \nMACE:I wish I did. \nOBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force? \nMACE: So the prophecy says. \nYODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been. \nOBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has. \nYODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you. \nThe GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP. \n87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET \nPadme's Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO. \nPADME: Thank you, Captain. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby. \nPADME: I'll be up in a while. \nMOTEE: Yes, my lady. \nC-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit. \nC-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady? \nPADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio. \nThe golden droid turns and exits. \nPADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something. \nANAKIN: Beautiful, isn't it? \nPADME jumps and turns around. \nPADME: You startled me. \nHe sits next to her on the bench. \n", "test3_input": "PALPATINE: The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. \nThere is a long period of APPLAUSE. \nPADME: Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy. \nPALPATINE: In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. \nThere is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded. \nPALPATINE: (continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . . \nThe Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated. PADME begins to cry. \nPALPATINE: (continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . . \nThe Senate APPLAUDS. \nPADME: So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . . \nBAIL ORGANA: We cannot let this happen. \nHe starts to stand up. PADME stops him. \nPADME: Not now! There will be a time. \n182 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY \nAfter everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances. \nRUNE HAAKO: Stop! Enough, this is not right! \nRUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them. \n183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY \nNUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove. \nNUTE GUNRAY: The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want . . . \nNUTE GUNRAY is cut down in midsentence. \n184 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT \nOBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center. \nOBI-WAN: I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away. \nYODA: Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry. \n185 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT \nOBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area. \nOBI-WAN: Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . . \nYODA: If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find. \nOBI-WAN: I must know the truth, Master. \nOBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) It can't be . . . It can't be . . . \nAs ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him. \nANAKIN: The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious. \nDARTH SlDIOUS: Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing? \nANAKIN: Yes, My Master. \nDARTH SlDIOUS: Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire. \nOBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes. \nOBI-WAN: I can't watch any more. \nOBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments. \nYODA: Destroy the Sith, we must. \nOBI-WAN: Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin. \nYODA: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not. \nOBI-WAN: He is like my brother ... I cannot do it. \nYODA: Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader. \nOBI-WAN: How could it have come to this? \nYODA: To question, no time there is. \nOBI-WAN: I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look. \nYODA: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you. \nOBI-WAN: May the Force be with you, Master Yoda. \n", "test3_true": "A DC0052 Intergalactic Speeder pulls up to the veranda landing of Padme's apartment. \n187 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-AFTERNOON \nThe cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE. \nC-3PO: Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly. \nThe security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding. \nOBI-WAN: Has Anakin been here . . . ? \nC-3PO: Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple. \nPADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves. \nPADME: Master Kenobi . . . \nShe embraces Obi-Wan. \nPADME: (continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive. \nOBI-WAN: The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . . \nPADME: I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone. \nOBI-WAN: I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making. \nPADME: The Senate is still intact, there is some hope. \nOBI-WAN: No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic. \nPADME: The Sith!?! \nOBI-WAN: I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him? \nPADME: Yesterday. \nOBI-WAN: And do you know where he is now? \nPADME: (looks down) No. \nOBI-WAN: Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger. \nPADME: From the Sith? \nOBI-WAN: From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side. \nPADME: You're wrong! How could you even say that? \nOBI-WAN: I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings. \nPADME: Not Anakin! He couldn't! \nOBI-WAN: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice. \nPADME: I don't believe you ... I can't. \nOBI-WAN: Padme, I must find him. \nPADME: You're going to kill him, aren't you? \nOBI-WAN: He has become a very great threat. \nAs PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy. \nPADME: I can't . . . \nOBI-WAN: Anakin is the father, isn't he? \nPADME looks away. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm so sorry. \nOBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing what to do. She is worried and tormented. OBI-WAN takes off in the Speeder. She studies the japor snippet that is hanging around her neck. \n188 INT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY \nR2-D2 waits forlornly for his Master in front of the Jedi Starfighter. \n189 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY \nANAKIN surveys the slaughter with a crazed look in his eyes. \n190 INT. MUSTAFAR-CONTROL CENTER-BALCONY-DAY \nANAKIN stares out at Mustafar, standing on the control room balcony. \n191 EXT. CORUSCANT-LANDING PLATFORM-SUNSET \nA small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-3PO. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO: My Lady, let me come with you. \nPADME: There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal. \nTYPHO bows. \n"}

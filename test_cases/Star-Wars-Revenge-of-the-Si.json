We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor. \nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU. \nOBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku. \nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues. \nCOUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this. \nANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count. \nCOUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall. \nDOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . . \nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better. \nAs the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force. ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking. ANAKIN hits the archway. DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight. \nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don\u0092t use them. \nAnakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense. Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness. \n39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nAnakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat. \nPALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now! \nANAKIN: I shouldn't . . . \nPALPATINE: Do it!! \nANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything. \nANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself. \nPALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive. \nANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE. \nANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. \nANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose. \nANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way. \nPALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists. \nPALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive. \nThe ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators. \nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late. \nANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right. \nPALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it. \nANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours. \nANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators. \n40 INT.

ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him. \nANAKIN: The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . . \nARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN. \nANAKIN: (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224. \nSuddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft. \nANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in! \n43 INT.

ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nAs the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway. ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him. \n46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror. \n47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nPILOT: Magnetize! Magnetize! \n48 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him.

ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder. \nANAKIN: We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast. \nPALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other. \n51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Fire the emergency booster engines. \nPILOT: Leveling out, sir. \n52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft. \n53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around. \nANAKIN: Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation. \nOBI-WAN: Did I miss something? \nOBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them. \nANAKINN: Hold on. \nOBI-WAN: What is that? \nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops. \nANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator! \nOBI-WAN: Too late! Jump! \nThey fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by. \n54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land. \nOBI-WAN: Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nAs the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris. \n56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay. \n57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER \nIt is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay. \nOBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere. \nANAKIN: I agree. \nPALPATINE: What are we going to do? \nANAKIN: I don't know. \nOBI-WAN: Don't look at me. I don't know. \nANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled.

KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY \nA WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle. \n93 EXT.

CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING \nPADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches. \nOBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you? \nPADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council. \nOBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted. \nThey laugh. \nPADME: You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it? \nOBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme. \nPADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings. \nOBI-WAN: It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you. \nPADME: Why would he talk to me about his work? \nOBI-WAN studies her. \nOBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either. \nPADME: Don't give me that look. \nOBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you. \nPADME: (nervous) What did he say? \nOBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn't have to. \nPADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony. \nPADME: I don't know what you're talking about. \nOBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him. \nPADME looks down and doesn't answer. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . . \nThey stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . . \nPADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan. \nOBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him. \n95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY \nPADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme's living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests. \nPADME: We cannot let this turn into another war. \nBAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want. \nMON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all. \nPADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult. \nBANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous. \nMON MOTHMA: We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this. \nPADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust. \nGiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky. \nPADME: The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . . \nCHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator. \nFANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor. \nBANA BREEMU: When you present the \"petition of the two thousand\" to the Chancellor, things may change. \n", "test2_true": "PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment. \n96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY \nANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP. \nANAKIN: You're going to need me on this one, Master. \nOBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase. \nOBI-WAN starts to turn and leave. \nANAKIN: Master! \nOBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him. \nANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me. \nOBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master. \nOBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back. \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help. \nANAKIN: Well, there's always a first time. \nOBI-WAN laughs. \nThey talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart. \nANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you. \nOBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you. \nOBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser. \n97 EXT.

REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE \nCLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side. \nOBI-WAN: I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down? \nThey laugh. \nOBI-WAN: (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters. \nOBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe. \nOBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there. \nCLONE COMMANDER CODY: I'm counting on you. \n99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE \nOBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau. \n100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY \nThe Chancellor's Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him. \nPALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off? \nANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous's head. \nPALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake. \nANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision. \nThey exit the landing platform. \n101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY \nThey enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo. \nJAR JAR: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . . \nThe Gungan waves to Anakin. \nANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar. \nJAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir. \nAnakin turns back to the Chancellor. \nPALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment. \nANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that? \n", "test2_id": 49, "test3_input": "PALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator. \nANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!? \nPALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator. \nANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know. \nPALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see. \nANAKIN becomes worried. \nPALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine. \n102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM \nPADME calls out in pain.

ANAKIN seems tense. \nPADME: He's worried about you. \nANAKIN: You told him about us, didn't you? \nShe continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows. \nPADME: He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress. \nANAKIN: And he's not? \nPADME: You have been moody lately. \nANAKIN: I'm not moody . . . \nPADME: Anakin! Don't do this again. \nANAKIN: I don't know ... I feel . . . lost. \nPADME: Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand. \nANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me. \nPADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son. \nANAKIN: Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't. \nPADME: You expect too much of yourself. \nThey stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly. \nANAKIN: I have found a way to save you. \nPADME: Save me? \nANAKIN: From my nightmares. \nPADME: Is that what's bothering you? \nANAKIN: I won't lose you, Padme. \nPADME: I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you. \nANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying. \nPADME looks ANAKIN in the eye. \nPADME: You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are. \nThey embrace and kiss. \n104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE \nOBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes. \n105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY \nOBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON. \nTlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary? \nOBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war. \nTlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you've brought it with you. \n", "test3_true": "A GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan\u0092s Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly. \nTlON MEDON: He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us. \nOBI-WAN: I understand. \nTlON MEDON: The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . . \nOBI-WAN: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time. \nOBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him: \nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact. \nThe little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply. \n106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY \nOn a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower. \nTlON MEDON: I told you, all he wanted was fuel. \nBODYGUARD: What was his name? \nTlON MEDON: He didn't say. \nThey watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off. \n107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY \nOBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city. \n108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY \nOBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It's hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on. \n109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY \nOBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates. He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around. OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements. \nOBI-WAN: I need transportation. \nWRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation. \nOBI-WAN: Get it for me. \nWRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you. \nOne of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck. \nOBI-WAN: This one. \nThe WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him. \nWRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga. \nOBI-WAN: Good girl, Boga. \nOBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole. \n110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY \nThe LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement. \n111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there. \nNUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting. \nOBI-WAN is deep in thought. \n112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY \nThe JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL. \nOBI-WAN: Hello, there! \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him! \nAbout a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stare at each other for a moment. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this. \nThe BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury. OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself. \nOBI-WAN: Your move. \nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi. \nHis arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship. \n", "test3_id": 50}

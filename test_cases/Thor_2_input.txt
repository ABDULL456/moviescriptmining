108 EXT. MAIN STREET 108 
On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link, turns to Cale. 
AGENT GARRETT They want an update. 
AGENT CALE Tell them he's eating eggs. 
AGENT GARRETT Scrambled or fried? Cale glares at him. 
AGENT CALE 
(INTO COMM-LINK) Target is eating eggs, sir. We'll keep you posted. 
108AA INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 108AA 
As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his hand, gets an idea. 
THOR 
(RE: MUG) May I have this? 
DARCY Sure. 
THOR Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves. 
108A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 108A 
In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day. (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch. She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him suspiciously. He offers her a MUG. 
THOR To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A. She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him. 
ISABEL Okay. Thank you. 
THOR If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your "coffee."¬ù 
ISABEL Any time. He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and shrugs. 
ISABEL (CONT'D) She could do worse. 
109 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109 
Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's controls. He glares at them accusingly. 
VOLSTAGG Good Heimdall, less us explain-- 
HEIMDALL You would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? The four exchange nervous glances. 
SIF Yes, but-- 
HEIMDALL Good. The group looks puzzled. What did he just say? 
VOLSTAGG So you'll help us? 
HEIMDALL I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the Bifrost to you. With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory. The others exchange puzzled looks. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B. 
FANDRAL Complicated fellow, isn't he? 
VOLSTAGG Now what do we do? Sif glances at the control panel, notices something. 
SIF Look! The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally. Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up. 
110 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM - DAY 110 
Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor. 
COULSON What the hell was that? 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87. 
TECHIE I don't know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest. 
COULSON Let's go take a look. 
111 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111 
Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes cover the desert sand around them. 
VOLSTAGG He must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints.

{"train": "\"THE SIEGE\" \nScreenplay by \nLawrence Wright, Menno Meyjes & Edward Zwick \nStory by \nLawrence Wright \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. TYRE, LEBANON - DAY \nA coast road. Date palms. Burnt-out hulks that once were Russian T-54 TANKS have long ago been left to rust in the sun. A 4-door MERCEDES hurtles down the ancient road. \nDEVEREAUX (V.O.) We're online for exactly two minutes. \nA SATELLITE VIEW \nOf the same scene. A grainy IMAGE of the car, and some distance away, a moving cluster of animals. They are: \nHERD OF SHEEP \nAs seen at ground level. Two SHEPHERDS goad them forward. In the distance, the MERCEDES approaches. \nFLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK) \nU.S. Army medics and rescue workers frantically sift through the rubble of a collapsed barracks. \nCNN REPORTS (V.O.) \"...the single worst casualty in the history of American military --\" \nBACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD \nThe Mercedes barrels down the road, doing at least 80 mph. \nTHE SATELLITE VIEW \nShows that the car is fast approaching the point where the herd of sheep are about to cross the road. \nFLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK) \nAmidst the rubble, the dead are zipped into body bags. \nCNN REPORTS (V.O.) \"-- the truck, carrying high explosives is believed to have hit the barracks -- \nBACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD \nThe driver of the Mercedes hits his horn but doesn't slow down. In addition to the driver and a bodyguard, an OLD MAN WITH A HENNAED BEARD, a turban, and sunglasses sits in back. \nTHE SATELLITE VIEW \nAs the Mercedes closes with the sheep: \nDEVEREAUX (V.O.) Slow down. \nBACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD \nAs if on command, the Mercedes finally slows as the sheep move lazily across the road. \nFLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK) \nPresident Clinton addresses reporters in the White House. \nPRESIDENT CLINTON \"To any lengths, anywhere in the world, to bring these people to justice.\" \nBACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD \nInside the Mercedes, they watch as the Shepherd urinates and the sheep mill about in the middle of the road. The driver rolls down his window to scream in Arabic at: \nTHE POOR SHEPHERD \nWho hurries to button his fly. It is only as we look closer that we see the silenced muzzle of: \nCOLT COMMANDO RIFLE \nProtruding from the sleeve of his jhallabah. And then: \nTHE HERD OF SHEEP \nFill the frame, blocking our view of the Mercedes, and for a moment, all we can HEAR is their gentle bleating. But as they clear frame, we can see that: \nTHE MERCEDES \nHas been turned into an abattoir, its windshield shattered and bloody. The driver slumps over the steering wheel, the bodyguard is half out of the window. And in the distance: \nWITH A MAGICIAN'S ALACRITY \nOne Shepherd pulls a BLACK HOOD over the Sheik's head while the other injects him with a HYPODERMIC. The first Shepherd activates a SATCHEL CHARGE and swings it into the Mercedes while the second straps the Sheik into a HARNESS... A BALLOON self-inflates and hurtles aloft, pulling a cable attached to the Sheik's harness. \nAN MC-130 COMBAT TALON AIRCRAFT \nBACK TO -- THE 99 BUS \nThe doors hang off their hinges. As the PASSENGERS tumble off, we SEE they are covered in BLUE PAINT. \nBACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR \nHUB -- What?! \nFRANK -- That's what they're telling me. \nHUB -- And nobody's hurt? \nFrank nods. Hubs closes his eyes in gratitude. \nHUB Thank God. \nCUT TO: \nTHE JOINT FBI/NYPD TERRORISM TASK FORCE - FEDERAL BLDG \nThey're listening to a tape-recording, altered by a VO-CORDER: \nTAPED VOICE -- our first and last warning. \nAs the MESSAGE continues, we PAN the faces: MIKE JOHANNSON, squad supervisor, and DANNY SUSSMAN, representing NYPD. \nTAPED VOICE We expect our demand to be met. There will be no negotiation. That is all. \nTINA Demand for what? You hear any demand? \nMIKE You sure this is all they got? \nSUSSMAN That's it. \nFRANK Maybe it's performance art. \nSussman shoots him a look. Clearly Haddad enjoys pushing his buttons. Finally, Hub stands up. \nHUB -- Okay. Blue paint. Voice-altering technology -- \nFRANK -- available from The Sharper Image catalogue. \nSUSSMAN Last I looked they weren't offering exploding paint bombs. \nHUB Still, the rhetoric sounds political. Militia? \nTINA Not their style. \nHUB Frank --? \nFRANK Jihad isn't known for their sense of humor, and Hamas is raising so much money here, why queer their deal? \nTINA Anyway, isn't Green the color of Islam, not blue? \nFRANK -- And, excuse me, but why do we immediately assume they're Arabs? \nHUB I want a composite of the suspects in circulation by the end of business today. Tina, you cross-check it against the mainframe. Mike, have you got the lab analysis on the paint? \nMIKE Not yet... \nHUB -- See if any was sold in quantity the last month. Danny -- \nTina's phone buzzes. She picks it up as Hub keeps going: \nHUB -- find out what stop these guys got on the bus, maybe there's a witness. \nFRANK Hub... I think we're all eager to give up our weekends on this. It just occurs to me, has anybody even committed a crime here? I mean, assault with a deadly color? \nHub deals with Haddad's irreverence by ignoring it. \nHUB Here's what I don't like. They know explosives. They know our response time. They put in a call and walk. \nA young agent, FRED DARIUS, hands Hub a piece of paper: \nFRED Excuse me, sir. I think you should see this. Came in on the Fax. \nOnly two words are written: \"RELEASE HIM.\" \nHUB Release him? Him who? Who are we holding? \nTINA Marv Albert? \nSUSSMAN McVeigh? Sheik what's-his-name from the Trade Center. \nFRANK -- Omar Abdel Rahman... asshole. \nFRED The Hamas guy got released in April. \nFRANK Under protest. \nHUB (looks at the fax) Why be coy about it? \nSUSSMAN You think it's phony? \nNearby, Mike and Danny observe them. \nDANNY -- He doing her? \nMIKE Some detective you are. They stopped. \nFRED Really? I wonder if she likes white guys. \nDANNY I wonder if she likes bald guys. \nHub, meanwhile, congratulates Frank's wife, NAJIBA. \nHUB You must be so proud... \nNAJIBA Small children, small worries. Big children -- \nFRANK -- big orthodontia bills. Someday, you'll understand. \nAnd then Frank notices Hub's DRIVER standing in the doorway. \nFRANK Where we going? \nHUB You're staying with your family. I'm back in the morning. \nCUT TO: \nSequence omitted from original script. \nSequence omitted from original script. (ALREADY SHOT) \nINT. HUB'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING \nHub is looking at surveillance photos of Elise. Frank enters. \nFRANK You sleep here? (Hub smiles, but doesn't look up) Immigration called. \nA SMALL GREEN ROOM -- AS SEEN THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR \nHub and Frank watch a dark-skinned MAN being questioned by a uniformed OFFICIAL. An INS Supervisor shows them a false- bottomed suitcase stuffed with money. \nINS OFFICIAL -- all in small bills. So we figure, smurf, right? Then I think, considering the gentleman's nationality, plus where he's been recently, we better call Frank. \nFRANK -- who's trying to score points with his boss, bigtime. \nHUB Has he broken any laws? \nINS OFFICIAL No, sir. He's twenty bucks under the $10,000 limit. \nFRANK (pulls out a $20 bill) Not anymore. \nIN THE ROOM \nThe official hopes volume breaks the language barrier. \nUNIFORMED OFFICIAL ...so, Kahlil, you're saying this is an INHERITANCE? Somebody DIED and you're bringing them the MONEY? \nThe dark-skinned man is trying to keep up: \nKAHLIL No, no... dhouri. \nBEHIND THE MIRROR \nFRANK ...He means, \"dowry.\" \nHUB Check out his neck. \nSmall puckered SCARS. The INS guy looks confused. \nFRANK The tabac. (mimics putting out a cigarette on his arm) Sssssss... The territories. \nHUB (thinks a moment) Put him in play. \nCUT TO: \nTHE VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY \nHub and Frank in a rental CONTOUR, tail Khalil, in a cab: \nHUB (on the phone) -- on the Van Wyck... No, not yet. (to Frank) -- What are we in? \nFRANK A '97 Contour. On my Visa. (watches Khalil) Back home, the security services'd be up this guy's ass with a poker, but what do we do, we let him go. \nHUB (still on the phone) ...Six teams on the ground, at least... well, pull 'em off the UN... (to Haddad) Stay back... \nFRANK Not my first date, Hub. (the TAXI changes lanes) He's taking the BQE. Looks like it's Brooklyn. \nHUB (still on the phone) I want husbands and wives, I want baby carriages, and no Brooks Brothers. \nFRANK You're micro-managing. \nHUB (still on the phone) -- And find me a judge I can work with. We want sound on this guy... damn'... I'm losing you... (raises his voice) And bring us a radio. \nFRANK I get reimbursed for this, right? \nHUB Go, Floyd. \nAs he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face. \nCUT TO: \nAN ORDINARY HOUSE \nIn an ordinary neighborhood. Hub sits in an UNMARKED CAR. Agent Rose climbs into the front seat. \nAGENT ROSE I've got two in the Plymouth, at least three inside, and see that guy walking his dog...? He did his business about an hour ago and they're still walking. \nIN ANOTHER CAR -- \nDANNY I had a dog like that once. \nFRANK It's not his dog, numbnuts. They're spies. \nDANNY The dog works for the CIA? \nTheir radio CRACKLES to life. It's Hub. \nHUB (V.O.) (over the radio) All units report in turn. \nWe HEAR \"Unit 1 is good to go,\" \"Unit 2, we're ready to rock.\" \nHUB Let's roll. \nTHE MAN WALKING THE DOG \nIs suddenly double-teamed by TWO AGENTS. \nAGENT - MIKE Federal Agents. Hands behind your back -- \nA third AGENT throws his jacket over the dog. \nTWO UNMARKED CARS \nFishtail across the quiet street, boxing in the Plymouth as an AGENT from the sidewalk thrusts a 12-gauge Remington Pump in through the driver's window. \nAGENT - FRED -- Keep 'em where we can see 'em, thank you very much. \nTHE DOOR TO THE HOUSE \nIs BLOWN-IN by a specially-designed SHOTGUN. Two MEN, eating take-out are surprised by Frank and Tina, their guns drawn. \nFRANK Hi, guys, I expect you know the drill. \nHub continues warily from one empty room to the next. A stairway leads downstairs. As Hub starts cautiously down, muted VOICES can be heard. Reaching the bottom, he sees: \nKHALIL \nSitting in a chair. Behind him stands one of FREELANCERS from the warehouse. And opposite him, in a barca-lounger: \nELISE KRAFT -- Somehow amidst the normalcy of the furnished basement is a palpable feeling of menace. \nAs Hub shows himself, one of the Freelancers points a Glock .9 at his head. Hub just stares him down. \nELISE Ralph, spare us. \nThe freelancer lowers the gun. Hub looks at Khalil, whose face is badly bruised. \nELISE I never touched him. \nHUB Really? I'm taking him into custody just the same. \nELISE What are you going to charge him with? Jaywalking? (Hub stares at her) I don't suppose we could just have a little chat with him here first? \nHUB Not in this lifetime. \nELISE You know, Hub... may I call you Hub? If you guys hadn't blown the surveillance, we'd have been able to follow the money. What do you think, Khalil, you would have led us right to your friends, wouldn't you? \nKhalil averts his eyes from any contact with her. \nHUB What friends --? What have you got for me, Elise?... Enlighten me. (she stonewalls) Tell me now or tell me downtown. \nStill nothing. Hub calls out to his agents. \nHUB Get this guy out of here and book him. \nAs the other agents approach Khalil: \nELISE One phone call and he's mine again. You know the number. I have -- \nHUB You have \"the right to remain silent,\" you have \"the right to an attorney. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law -- \nELISE (overlapping him) Oh, come on... Do you have any idea what you're starting here, the kind of shitstorm you're about to -- \nHUB (overiding her) -- Kidnapping. Obstruction of Justice. Assault. \nAs he heads out of the room, he says to a waiting Agent. \nHUB Cuff her. \nTINA You don't smoke. \nHub pockets the pack of cigarettes and walks into: \nTHE CELL \nFrank hangs back in the doorway. Hub pulls up a chair, turns it backwards, and sits down very close to Khalil. \nHUB Ten thousand dollars. \nFrank translates. Khalil pretends not to understand. \nHUB Khalil. I want to talk about the money. \nAgain Frank translates. And again, Khalil looks blank. \nHUB Okay... \nHub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack of cigarettes. Khalil's eyes widen. Hub smiles at him. At the SOUND of the match lighting, SWEAT begins to bead on Khalil's forehead. Hub takes his time LIGHTING the cigarette -- drawing deep so the tip turns bright red. Khalil unconsciously RECOILS in his chair. \nHUB (to Frank, re: Khalil) Doesn't like second hand smoke. \nHub turns back to Khalil, casually gesturing with his cigarette. Khalil almost jumps out of his skin. \nHUB You ready to talk about money? \nFrank hasn't even begun to translate before Khalil begins SPEED-RAPPING in Arabic. \nFRANK (translating) ...He says he loves America and only wanted to get away from the security services at home. \nTears stream down Khalil's face. He kneels at Hub's feet. \nFRANK (still translating) ...He says he's sorry but he didn't know he was doing something bad. His cousin introduced him to a man who promised him two hundred dollars for his dowry if he'd bring the suitcase to an address in Brooklyn. (to Hub) He's a cut-out. \nOUTSIDE THE ROOM -- LATER \nHub hands Tina back the pack of cigarettes. \nHUB Nasty habit. (to Danny) 3830 Flatbush Avenue. \nFLASH CUT -- A SWAT TEAM \nBursts into an empty apartment. On the floor, a fax machine continuously sending the message: \"RELEASE HIM.\" \nBACK TO -- HUB \nHUB We want every rental agreement from every landlord in Brooklyn. Hotels, motels, flophouses... (to the other agents) It's cash, guys. They're the only ones in America using cash. \nTWO HOURS LATER -- \nThe room is dark. A TECHNICIAN operates an overhead PROJECTOR. \nTECHNICIAN This is a spectograph of the semtex used in the bomb. Look at the benzene spike. This is the genuine article. (another slide) Now... this one's from the barracks in Dhahran. As you can see, the signature is identical. \nTWO HOURS LATER -- \nA COMPUTER TECHIE (WHITNEY) is cross-referencing data. DIGITAL PICTURES of suspected terrorists scroll past. A surveillance PHOTO of Ahmed bin Talal. The ruined army barracks. \nHUB -- ask it if they've ever hit buses? \nThe techie types in a few commands: IMAGES of destroyed BUSES file past. Tel Aviv. Jerusalem. Beirut. None a match. \nWHITNEY -- not according to the mainframe. \nTWO HOURS LATER -- \nThe BOMB SCENE now resembles an archeological dig. Floodlights on stanchions. Forensic EXPERTS, on their hands and knees, use BLACK LIGHT and brushes to search for latent prints. Different color STRING divides the site into a grid. \nHUB -- with a Q-tip. Bone shards, hair, fingernails -- \nNearby, Danny and Mike observe Hub's intensity. \nDANNY -- He's way over his head. \nFRANK Shut the fuck up and go give somebody a parking ticket. \nTWO HOURS LATER -- \nIn THE LAB. A FINGERPRINT EXPERT sifts through a plastic bag of fingertips and teeth. Scans each into a computer. \nFINGERPRINT EXPERT Not yet. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nTWO HOURS LATER -- \nHub is STARING AT THE TV SETS which are all REPLAYING the terrible incident, over and over again. \nTV SOUND BITE \"-- Today; Tel Aviv has come to Brooklyn. The question... is why.\" \nFinally, he turns away so no one will see. His eyes are hot with the emotion. \nWHITNEY You okay? \nHUB You hungry? \nELISE We ordering in --? \nCUT TO: \nSequence omitted from original script. \nIN A DOWNTOWN DELI \nHub and Elise sit, eating corned beef sandwiches. \nELISE -- The funeral shroud is the final step in the ritual of self- purification. First a fast, then -- \nHUB -- the washing of the body, then the shroud. I saw it on Sixty Minutes. Tell me something I don't know. \nShe pauses, always gauging how much to reveal. And when. \nELISE ...Last March in Iraq, we identified the man we believe responsible for bombing the army barracks last year. In August, he went to Lebanon. Where he was... extracted. \nHUB Extracted? Extracted by whom? (she just looks at him) I see. \nELISE His name is Sheik Ahmed bin Talal. He's Iraqi. And something of a religious leader. \nHUB With something of a devoted following? (she nods) ...Okay, I can understand why we might not want to publicize the fact that our government's in the kidnapping business, but why not tell us? \nELISE He's still being... debriefed. They're not ready to go public with charges. \nHUB What else you got on his followers. \nELISE Clearly, they're committed. \nHUB Meaning? \nELISE In this game, the most committed wins. \nHUB So they'll just keep coming until we release him. \nELISE Unless we match their commitment with our own. \nHUB What about talking to this sheik? \nELISE You don't think they've got guys talking to the sheik? Except the sheik isn't talking. \nHUB So who's giving the orders? How do they coordinate, pick their targets? \nELISE Believe me, we've put every resource we've got onto that very question. (puts down her fork) Otherwise... we wait. \nHUB We wait. \nShe looks at him. For one brief moment the mask drops away. \nELISE If there's anybody on earth who knows how you feel, it's me. But you've got to let it go. Those people were dead the minute they got on the bus. \nFrank Haddad appears, making his way toward their table. \nFRANK Sorry, boss. Hello, Elise. Mmmm, is that pastrami? (tastes it; then with his mouth full) Oh, yeah, we made the guy in the picture. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nCUT TO: \nA CAFE \nWhere Students sit inside and SMOKE, then SMOKE some more. \nFRANK (V.O.) My people. The last of the unambivalent smokers. (shakes his head) Monsters. The toughest motherfucker in Bed-Stuy is a muffin compared to some of these guys. \nThey watch as SAMIR gets his bill from the waiter. \nFRANK His name's Samir Nazhde. Teaches Arab Studies at Brooklyn College. He sponsored Ail Waziri's student visa. And dig this -- his brother blew up a movie theatre in Tel Aviv. \nELISE You might consider leaving him alone. \nHUB Why would I consider doing that --? \nIn the cafe, Samir counts cash to leave on the table. \nELISE Play him like a cop and haul him in now and get your arrest, or tag him and let him lead you to the really big fish. \nFRANK (an arabic curse) You're fishing and he's getting visas for bombers. \nELISE You ever heard of catch and release? \nFRANK Yes, and he's on the next plane for Tunis. \nHub looks at Elise. Samir is leaving -- it's now or never. \nHUB Take him down. \nFRANK (keys his radio) Go. \nTHREE AGENTS brace Samir politely but firmly, and lead him to their car. Samir slides into the back seat next to Elise. In the REARVIEW MIRROR, Hub watches as a look seems to pass between them. Then again, it may not have happened. \nHUB Daily reports. We tap his phone. \nELISE And I get to see the transcripts. \nHUB Fair enough. \nELISE And I run him. \nHUB We share him. \nELISE He can't know we're talking. \nHUB Then don't tell him. \nELISE Done. \nHUB (to Frank) Let him fly. (back to her) But we better start seeing product. \nShe nods. A deal. For now. \nHUB Any more surprises for me? \nELISE Not tonight. \nHUB Then I'm going home to get some things. \nFRANK I'll have somebody drive you. \nHUB I'll grab a cab. \nAnd he's gone. Frank turns to Elise: \nFRANK Elise. I'm really high strung, too. \nShe just smiles and walks away. \nOUTSIDE THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER \nNot many people around. Hub stands on the corner. A TAXI cruises up. On duty. Available. He slows long enough to see that Hub is black and passes right by. \nAT A RED LIGHT \nThe taxi driver stops just long enough for Hub to slam his SHIELD on the windshield. \nIN THE TAXI \nHub sits in back, hurtling into the night. The driver's ID identifies him as ABDUL HASSAM. Hub shakes his head. \nIN THE SHOWER \nAs the hot SPRAY hits him, he runs his hands through his hair and feels the BITS OF SHATTERED GLASS. Dried blood runs off in rivulets from his hands. Not his own. He leans against the shower wall, closes his eyes. \nCUT TO: \nELISE -- BRUTALLY SLAPPED ACROSS THE FACE \nWe are in her apartment. Samir looms over her. \nSAMIR You let him HIT ME --!! You cannot care about me and let such things happen! \nELISE Next time don't be such a smart ass -- \nSAMIR Sometimes I hate you just because you are so American. It makes me want to hurt you. I think about fucking you and hurting you. \nElise can taste the blood in her mouth -- but it's the price she's come to accept. In a heartbeat, it's all business. \nELISE -- You want to fuck me? Then work with me. \nSAMIR Don't tell me what I have to do. \nELISE No? Do we really want to have this conversation again? Do we --? \nSomething quietly ominous in her tone. He lowers his eyes. And like a sailboat, Elise changes tack. Strokes his arm. \nELISE I need you to help me. I need you to be strong. As you have always been strong. For both of us. -- Samir? Look at me... \nBACK TO HUB -- WHO AWAKENS IN THE DARKNESS \nHe's fallen asleep in a chair. In his lap is a pile of visa applications. His BEEPER goes off. He rouses himself. \nBACK TO ELISE -- ROUGHLY TURNED OVER IN BED BY SAMIR \nSex without any shred of tenderness. As Samir kisses the back of her neck, we SEE in her eyes the thousand-yard stare. \nBACK TO HUB -- ON THE STREET \nIn the doorway of an apartment building, Frank hands Hub a styrofoam cup of coffee. It's a ritual between them. \nBACK TO ELISE -- LYING IN BED AS SAMIR SMOKES \nSAMIR -- Some people just cannot live in the camps. For my brother, it was already like dying. The only thing he lives for is movies. \nHe sits up in bed, reaching for another cigarette. \nDEVEREAUX Sounds like I should get out of your way. We're there if you need us. (at the door; to Elise) Your father well, Elise? \nELISE As can be expected. How's Maggie? \nDEVEREAUX Top of her game. (heads out) Well, go get 'em. \nAnd he's gone. Elise turns to Hub. \nELISE Making new friends. \nHUB How's your lip --? \nShe looks at Hub -- and now she knows that he knows. She brazens it out: \nELISE So... you like to watch --? \nHUB No. Just learning about commitment. \nELISE It's a full contact sport. \nCUT TO: \nJUDGE'S CHAMBERS -- DOWNTOWN \nJudge Frankel, 60, puts down his sandwich and wipes his hands. \nJUDGE FRANKEL -- You're telling me that just because some Brooklyn landlord tips you off that he's been paid in cash, you have the right to call in the cavalry -- ! Hub, as far as I know, paying cash is not yet a crime in this country. \nHUB You're not hearing me. This Khalil was carrying cash for -- \nJUDGE FRANKEL -- You've observed him giving cash to -- \nHUB ... No, but -- \nJUDGE FRANKEL -- But you have hard evidence linking this apartment to the people that blew up bus 87 --? \nElise sits quietly beside Frank, observing Hub's trials. \nHUB I know we'll turn up trace elements of semtex, chemicals... something. \nJUDGE FRANKEL And when you do, you'll get your warrant. \nHUB What about as a feasibility study? \nJUDGE FRANKEL Meaning? \nHUB We enter first, take a look, then fill out the warrant. \nJUDGE FRANKEL Tell me the difference between that and breaking-and-entering? \nHUB We're the good guys. \nJUDGE FRANKEL Not good enough. \nHUB What is good enough, Judge? Another bus? A school, maybe. These things come in waves. \nJUDGE FRANKEL Waves mean nothing to me; there's been a wave of violent crime committed by black people in this city for the past twenty years, but if you came to me with a plan to put all black people behind bars as a preventative measure I'd send you packing. There's a price to be paid for living in a free society -- \nHUB -- and not in cash I guarantee it. \nHub catches Elise's eye -- \"we're out of here.\" \nTHE STAIRCASE OF A TENEMENT \nElise and Hub climb seemingly endless FLIGHTS OF STAIRS. \nELISE -- Not two Judges from now, not two HOURS from now, not two MINUTES from now. These guys could split any SECOND and you've lost your best shot at -- \nHUB Frank's working another warrant -- \nELISE You don't understand, they're pros! From the age of twelve they've been dodging people like you, people better than you. \nHUB You mean people like you? \nELISE -- no matter how sparkling your record is, no matter how terrified you are to fail -- \nFinally he stops, turns on her: \nHUB It's... against... the... law. \nELISE -- Just because you went to night school, or filled out the back of a matchbook or whatever you did to get a law degree doesn't make you Sir Thomas More. \nHUB Just because you talk the talk doesn't make you an expert. And just because you read my file doesn't make you an expert on me. \nELISE You're gonna lose them and they're gonna do another horrible -- \nHUB -- You think I want to lose them. Where do you get off talking that shit. (controls himself...) If I don't take 'em down properly they'll be on the street two hours from now. I could find dynamite, semtex, plutonium and a book of matches in there and unless I've got the right warrant it's all inadmissible \nELISE They've also got a warrant. A warrant from God. They're ready to die! And your quaint laws don't mean shit to these people. \nHUB My quaint laws? Last I checked you were an American citizen. And these happen to be the only laws we got. (turns on her) Look, I'm just a cop, okay, and I'm real sorry the cold war's over, and you Masters of the Universe got nothing going on over there in Afghanistan or Iraq or wherever -- but you're just not in the Middle East anymore... \nELISE Oh, really...? \nFRANK Anybody like anchovies --? \nThen from across the room, Hub kneels beside an ominous- looking DEVICE. A claymore mine. \nHUB Goddamn it. GODDAMN IT. \nFRANK What --? \nHUB It didn't fire. They had it rigged to the door and it didn't fire. \nFrank stares at the lethal booby-trap. Hub shakes his head. \nHUB We're too old to be lucky, Frank. \nCUT TO: \nA DOWNTOWN BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT \nWhere Mike and Tina are dancing their asses off. Around them, other AGENTS from the takedown laugh and drink. \nAT A NEARBY TABLE \nHub and Elise sit, watch them cut loose. \nELISE (sips her drink) My first boyfriend was Palestinian. My father liked to say, they seduce you with their suffering. \nA WAITRESS brings her another drink. \nELISE You ever been over there --? (he shakes his head, no) ...The courtesy with which they welcome you into their homes. And the people, these incredibly... warm people in this... austere land. \nHUB But you work against them. \nELISE Only the crazies. I tend to be suspicious of all true believers. (looks at him) Present company included. \nHUB So I'm a fanatic. \nELISE Let's just say you don't seem the ambivalent type. \nHUB Is that right? \nELISE So why're are you a fed? \nHUB That's what my nephew keeps asking me. \"Why you with The Man, Unc?\" \nELISE ...Well? What'd you tell him? \nHUB You read my file. You tell me. \nELISE Let's see... Catholic school. Captain of this, president of that. Hard work, fair play, make a difference, change the system from within. Rah. Rah. Rah. \nHUB That was in my file? \nELISE ...Tell me I'm wrong. \nHe studies her for a moment. \nELISE ...What --? \nHUB You believe in anything, Elise --? \nELISE Like what, for instance? \nHUB How about right and wrong? \nELISE It's easy to choose between right and wrong. What's hard is choosing the wrong that's more right. I just want to make it all... a little... better. (finishes her drink) Ignore me. I'm shitfaced. \nFrank appears to lean over their table. \nFRANK So am I --! Hey, Elise... tell us about being a spook? Ever meet Aldrich Ames? Weren't you at the Bay of Pigs? \nELISE You were in charge of Waco, right -- ? Or was that Ruby Ridge? \nFRANK The Shah of Iran, Noriega, I love the way you guys predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union. \nELISE Yeah, yeah, yeah... And J. Edgar Hoover wore a dress. \nShe laughs and stands up to dance: \nELISE What do you say, Hub...? Peace? \nBut as he grudgingly stands up, a BALLAD comes on. They stand there awkwardly. Finally, he takes her into his arms. \nELISE This feels like high school. \nHUB -- only my prom date wasn't packing a gun. \nELISE Mine's a 9 mm. How big is yours? \nHUB Two inches. From the ground. (laughing, they dance closer) So what's the latest from Samir. I want a list of every visa he sponsored. \nELISE Not sure he'll do it. \nHUB I once knew this undercover guy, started to care so much about his source -- \nCONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.) Sounds great, General, except why can't we find out who's behind it -- \nIN THE ROTUNDA LIBRARY \nA strategy session chaired by General Devereaux. Sleeves rolled up, silver coffee service. Staff members abound. \nFBI DIRECTOR These sects are organized so you need a kill to your credit to get inside. It makes undercover operations impossible. What that leaves us is... we're working on it. \nSENATOR WRIGHT How about who's behind who's behind this? \nCIA DIRECTOR Libya. Iraq. Iran. Possibly Syria. \nCHIEF OF STAFF Ask a question. Get an atlas. \nSENATOR WRIGHT All I know is that we must respond. \nCHIEF OF STAFF Respond, sure. But how? \nSENATOR WRIGHT Find out who it is and bomb the shit out of them. \nCHIEF OF STAFF And if we can't find out --? \nThe question hangs in the air. \nCONGRESSMAN MARSHALL Look it keeps escalating. First a bus, then the theatre. What's next? \nSENATOR WRIGHT Anything but leadership. \nDEVEREAUX With all respect, Senator, why don't we just stipulate that the President is a dumb son of a bitch so we can all get down to business. \nAn icebreaker. Everyone laughs. \nCONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.) What about sending in the Guard? \nATTORNEY GENERAL (V.O.) The National Guard are trained for riot control not counter-terrorism. \nSENATOR WRIGHT The Army then. I've seen the contingency plans. \nATTORNEY GENERAL It's settled legal doctrine, posse comitatus, that the Army not be turned against our own people. \nSENATOR WRIGHT Even if that's what our own people are asking for, three to one? \nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE If the President is willing to declare a State of Emergency -- \nSENATOR WRIGHT President Lincoln declared martial law in 1862. He suspended -- \nATTORNEY GENERAL -- which the Supreme Court later found un-constitutional. Ex parte Milligan. \nCONGRESSMAN MARSHALL And I've got an election in November. Ex-United States Congressman. \nCHIEF OF STAFF Guys, guys, the President lost a lot of friends last night -- \nCONGRESSMAN MARSHALL Not to mention six points in the polls. \nCHIEF OF STAFF -- And his plane lands in two hours. We owe it to him to have a consensus. \nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE You don't fight a junkyard dog with ASPCA rules. What you do is take the leash off your own, bigger, meaner dog. \nCHIEF OF STAFF ...General? \nDEVEREAUX The Army is a broadsword not a scalpel. You do not want us in an American city. \nCHIEF OF STAFF But hypothetically... how long would it take you to -- \nDEVEREAUX We only go if the President invokes the War Powers Act. \nCHIEF OF STAFF I understand that, General. Let us imagine, though, for a moment, that the order has been given. \nCLOSE on Devereaux. As he weighs his remarks, we FLASHCUT, almost imperceptibly to: \nAN ANONYMOUS ROOM \nAs WATER is poured over anonymous hands in a ritualized manner. O.S. we HEAR the SOUND of chanting. \nBACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM -- SAME TIME \nDEVEREAUX ...Twelve hours after the President gives the word we can be on the ground. One light infantry division of ten thousand seven hundred men. Elements of the Rapid Deployment Force combined with Special Forces -- Delta. APC's, tanks, helicopters. And of course, the ubiquitous M-16A1 assault rifle, a humble weapon until you see a man carrying one outside your local bowling alley or Seven- Eleven. It will be noisy, it will be scary and it will not be mistaken for a VFW parade. \nBACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS ROOM \nWhere the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud. We watch in SLOW-MOTION as it drifts down a shoulder. \nBACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM \nDEVEREAUX That means civilian casualties. At a minimum it's a drunk private joyriding in a Hummer who runs down an old lady in Greenpoint. At a maximum... (sighs) Make no mistake. We will hunt the enemy. We will find the enemy. And we will kill the enemy. \nBACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS HANDS \nTurning the key in an ignition. An engine rumbles to life. \nBACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM \nDEVEREAUX (looks at them) And no card-carrying member of the ACLU is more deadset against it... than I am. Which is why I urge you... no, I implore you not to consider this option. \nHUB Did you call the State Department? \nFRANK They told me to call INS. \nHUB -- And? \nFRANK They told me to call State. \nHUB Don't you just love government? \nTHE EXPLOSION \nIs only the BUS backfiring. PEDESTRIANS who have thrown themselves to the ground, screaming, now pick themselves up, Laughing. Only Hub and Frank are not laughing. \nNEWS ANCHOR DESK \nNEWSCASTER \"As many fled, there were others who stayed behind to pay the price... \nVIDEO CLIPS \nJammed freeways; A LOOTED corner deli, its Arab owners, bloodied: POLICE checking backpacks at an elementary school. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) Today, as hundreds of law enforcement officials gathered in a Broadway theatre, outside people wanted answers. \nVIDEO CLIPS \nAngry people, scared people. Hub, being interviewed about the coordinated efforts of law enforcement. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) Already there is talk of a protest march by a coalition of -- \nINSIDE THE THEATRE (A VIDEO CLIP TURNS BACK TO FILM) \nHub and a few others sit on the stage. Two hundred law enforcement officials fill the orchestra seats. \nMAYORAL AA (V.O.) THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY HAVE A RIGHT -- \nDANNY (V.O.) -- THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING --! \nMAYORAL AA -- IS TO MAKE THIS CITY SAFE...! And your department -- \nDANNY My department WHAT, ASSHOLE...? \nSharon stands at the back, meets Hub's eye, and waves. \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY Guys... GUYS... \nEVERYBODY'S talking at once. In frustration, Hub covers a microphone with his hand. The FEEDBACK silences the room. \nHUB Sorry. From now on, we will raise our hands and wait to be called on -- \nAn appreciative chuckle. Hub points to A MAN IN A SUIT. \nINS OFFICIAL Howard Kaplan. INS. So we've pulled every ethnic visa in the city and traced them to source. Who wants em? \nHUB Danny --? \nDANNY We bring 'me in, have a talk. \nUNIFORM COP (V.O.) What about translators --? \nDISTRICT ATTORNEY (V.O.) How many people we talking about here? \nINS OFFICIAL Sixteen hundred, maybe more. \nDANNY Where the hell we gonna put sixteen hundred people? \nEveryone again begins speaking at once. Hub takes control. \nMAN IN SUIT What about a military presence at JFK and LaGuardia --? \nHUB I don't think we're there yet. It's also not going to stop these people. \nMAYORAL AA What about protecting the Arab population? There's a lot of anger -- \nARAB SPOKESMAN (V.O.) I represent the American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Committee. Whatever injustices my people may be suffering at this difficult moment, we will continue to show our patriotism and our commitment to this country. \nHUB Thank you, sir. And to everyone else for their patience today. These are extremely difficult times -- London, Paris, we're not the first city to have to deal with this. \nHe pauses a moment, searching for the words. \nHUB In Tel Aviv, the day after they blew up the market, the market was full. (looks out at them) This is New York. We can take it. \nAnd then two hundred BEEPERS all go off at once. Everyone looks at one another. Dear God, what now... \nA GRAINY BLACK & WHITE VIDEO IMAGE \nKids, huddled in a corner, crying. A dead mom. The legs of what we imagine is the terrorist. We are in: \nAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- AN UPSTAIRS HALLWAY \nHub huddles with other agents behind a makeshift blast- barricade of desks and tables. Sharon kneels beside them. \nDANNY -- one of the moms was carrying a piece, wounds the guy as he's planting the device. He kills her and locks them all in. (points at video) Up there in the corner... by the clock. \nELISE I wanted to -- I... just didn't feel like... being alone... tonight. \nHUB Where's Samir? \nELISE I could call him. Maybe he'd join us. \nHUB You'd like that. \nELISE I might. Or I could call Tina. \nHUB \nThey stare at each other. \nELISE Look, I thought Samir'd be an easy recruit. He wasn't. It was crazy but I did what I had to do. (looks at him) You know as well as I do, running an agent can be very... complicated. \nHUB How about running an FBI agent? \nELISE You think I'm trying to run you? \nHUB (looks at her) ...Why else are you here? \nELISE (staring right back) ...You know why I'm here. \nIt's a charged moment. They're two sad and lonely people. \nELISE Tell me to leave. \nHUB Leave. \nELISE No. \nWhen they embrace, their ferocity and desperation is something more than comfort and less than love. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nCUT TO: \nTHE CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nThe Chief of Staff is working late in a cardigan sweater. Devereaux, in his impeccable suit, stands opposite him. Even at ease he is smartly erect. \nCHIEF OF STAFF The FBI received another fax. \nDEVEREAUX Ahmed Bin Talal. They're still under the impression that we have him. \nCHIEF OF STAFF Do we? Have him? \nDEVEREAUX To refresh your memory, as I told you last time, it was the Libyans who -- \nCHIEF OF STAFF I remember perfectly well what you said last time. (looks at him) Do we? \nDevereaux frosts him with a look. \nDEVEREAUX Let me give you some free advice, son. Don't get between me and the President. You might break a nail. \nCHIEF OF STAFF I am speaking for the President. \nHe and Devereaux look at each other. It is the moment of plausible deniability. \nDEVEREAUX As far as the President is concerned... No, we do not. \nThe Chief of Staff accepts the answer because it serves him, for now. And because he has a more pressing agenda. \nCHIEF OF STAFF General, do you know that after yesterday's attack, half the parents in this country kept their children out of school --? (Devereaux nods) ...They're attacking our way of life. It's got to stop. And the President cannot afford to be weak. \nDEVEREAUX (reading the subtext) Are you saying the President is prepared to take the necessary steps...? \nCHIEF OF STAFF I'm saying, the President is prepared to be... Presidential. \nCUT TO: \nHUB'S APARTMENT - DAWN \nA ringing phone. Hub wakes up in a tangle of sheets. He looks around and realizes he is alone. Did last night even happen? \nHUB (on the phone) Hubbard... What --? ...Slow down, slow down -- \nHe reaches for the remote control, turns on the TV. \nCUT TO: \nA GRINDING OF TREADS ON ASPHALT -- DAWN \nas THE FIRST APC enters Brooklyn. Followed by another. And another. And in a sound bite: General Devereaux, IN FATIGUES FOR THE FIRST TIME, and looking like grim death. \nDEVEREAUX Today, with the invocation of the War Powers Act by the President, I am declaring a state of martial law in this city. \nTHE BATTLE OF BROOKLYN HAS BEGUN \nRoad blocks set up at select intersections. Random stop-and- frisk. Patrols of young soldiers in the streets. GANG KIDS, same age, same color, eye them warily. \nDEVEREAUX To the best of our knowledge, we are opposed by no more than twenty of the enemy. He is hiding among a population of roughly two million. \nA FAT JOINT from an ashtray and hurries into the bathroom. \nHUB (to Sharon) Does he understand the difference between the FBI and the DEA? \nELISE Samir... It's fine, he's cool. \nOUTSIDE, the sound of gunfire. Samir reappears, wild-eyed. \nSAMIR Listen to that --! Are you listening? They're killing Arabs out there! \nHUB You can stop it all right now. \nSAMIR What are you talking about --? The army is here. They're setting up interrogation centers right now. They're torturing people in cellars. \nHUB Let's just calm down for a second... \nSAMIR -- I've got to get out of here. You have to help me -- \nHe goes over and peers out the drawn curtains. \nHUB (gentling a horse) We'll take care of you... don't worry. You just have to calm down -- \nSAMIR Money... I must have more money... \nHUB -- You got a student visa for Ali Waziri. Because... somebody asked you to -- Didn't they --? \nSAMIR I... got it myself. \nSharon CRACKS him across the face. \nELISE Liar --! \nNow it's Samir's turn to taste the blood in his mouth. \nELISE You... tell him... what he wants to know. \nHUB (to Sharon) Hey, that's enough. \nELISE He knows. He fucking knows. \nSAMIR She's crazy. They're ghosts. Jinn. They'd never trust someone like me. \nELISE Stop simpering. \nSAMIR Please... \nELISE I've got a picture of the two of us, do you remember that picture, Samir? (the mask coming off:) I'm going to post that picture in every mosque in Brooklyn. And then I'm gonna send copies to some friends of mine on the West Bank. You've got family there, don't you --? \nHub jumps up, takes Sharon by the arm. \nELISE Let go of me -- \nHe gives her the BUM'S RUSH out of the apartment, shuts the door, then turns back to Samir, who sits, ashen-faced. \nHUB Now... Nobody's going to burn you, nobody's going to call anybody -- (sits beside him) -- Who asked you to get that visa? \nSamir is trembling. Tears roll down his cheeks. \nHUB Don't be afraid. I can protect you. There's nothing to be afraid of. \nSAMIR I'm afraid of going to hell. \nHub just sits there. He knows he's got him. Finally: \nSAMIR His name is Tariq Husseini. He runs an auto shop. (Hub waits for more --) ...on Commerce Street in Red Hook. \nHUB (hands him a card) My beeper number. Anybody messes with you, I'm there in twenty minutes. \nHe gets up and walks into: \nTHE HALLWAY \nWhere Sharon waits. As they head for the stairs we HEAR: \nELISE (V.O.) You're good. \nHUB (V.O.) You're not so bad yourself. \nBut we are HEARING IT along with: \nCOL. HARDWICK \nIn a nearby SURVEILLANCE VEHICLE -- where, through the newest microwave technology (the kind the FBI don't yet have), he has OVERHEARD the entire conversation. \nON A NOTEPAD \nIn his lap, the name, \"Tariq Husseini.\" \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE SAMIR'S APARTMENT \nThey are in a housing project. Hub dials his cell phone. \nHUB Damn. Do you think you could give him a message? \nTARIQ Of course. \nHUB Tell him the FBI is after him. \nTARIQ You're joking. \nHUB Very... slowly... put your hands on top of the table. \nTariq notices that Hub's hands are out of sight beneath the table. Hub draws back the slide of his the weapon with an audible CLICK. Tariq mutters a CURSE in Arabic. \nHUB That wouldn't be a racist epithet, now would it? Stand up. \nAs Tariq stands, Hub crosses behind him, kicks out his legs, pats him down, and cuffs him. \nMEANWHILE -- IN THE WAREHOUSE \nThe two winos have revealed themselves as shotgun-wielding FBI agents and are now ROUSTING the garage workers. \nHUB Where are the others? \nTARIQ What others? \nBut before Hub can answer, an AMPLIFIED VOICE is heard. \nPSY-OPS (V.O.) Tariq Husseini, this is the United States Army. You are surrounded. \nHub is as surprised as Tariq. \nPSY-OPS You have thirty seconds to throw out any weapons and exit the premises with your hands on top of your head. \nOne of the agents with the shotgun calls out. \nSHOTGUN AGENT -- Sir? \nHUB Do as he says. \nAs Hub hustles Tariq to his feet, the other agents start to hustle the workers out of door, when: \nTHE YOUNG MECHANIC \nReaches into his overalls. \nSHOTGUN AGENT FREEZE--! \nBut when the Mechanic pulls his hand out from his overalls, all he is holding is the pin to a GRENADE. \nTHE EXPLOSION \nKills both the FBI agents and their prisoners. Hub throws Tariq to the ground. \nFROM AN UPPER WINDOW \nAn AUTOMATIC WEAPON opens fire on the Army presence. \nHIGH ABOVE -- IN A CHOPPER \nDevereaux responds with a dispassionate intensity. \nDEVEREAUX Code blue. \nHis order unleashes an overwhelming display of FIREPOWER. \nINSIDE THE WAREHOUSE \nHub and Tariq crawl for cover as windows EXPLODE, walls are SHREDDED, and incendiary TRACER rounds mix with solvents and gasoline to start a conflagration. With the vaguely hallucinatory quality of the S.L.A. shootout, WHITE NOISE bleeds in and ALL SOUND FADES OUT: \nAN M-60 TANK (SILENT) \nRaces in from around the corner, only to be hit by A ROCKET- PROPELLED GRENADE fired through the second floor window. \nINT. CHOPPER \nDEVEREAUX Code Red. \nTWO APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTERS (SILENT) \nAppear from their hiding place behind a nearby building. As they dive into their attack trajectory -- \nHUB (SILENT) \nCrawls, dragging Tariq toward the doors as: \nTHE CHAIN GUN (SILENT) \nOf the Attack helicopter fires 2,000 rounds a minute -- virtually UNZIPPING the warehouse -- softening it for THE TWO HYDRA ROCKETS that reduce it instantly to a huge FIREBALL. \nIN THE CHOPPER -- DEVEREAUX \nWatches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment. \nINSIDE THE WAREHOUSE -- TWO SHADOWY FIGURES \nHUB I want to see him. \nDevereaux just looks at him as we CUT TO: \nTHE TILED SHOWER ROOM \nTariq is strapped, NAKED, into a folding metal chair. His head lolls on his chest, his eyes are dulled. On a nearby table, an empty syringe. Two MP'S stand guard. \nSharon is speaking softly to him in Arabic. Suddenly, Tarak SPITS in her face. She wipes it off as if it is nothing. \nDEVEREAUX How long have you been at it? \nELISE Not long enough, apparently. \nDEVEREAUX How much longer, do you think, before he gives up the other cells -- \nHUB He can't give up the other cells if he doesn't know about them. \nDEVEREAUX He knows. \nHUB (gestures to Sharon) What about her briefing? The strategy session -- she said the cells don't know about each other, that they -- \nDevereaux ignores him. Turns to Sharon. \nDEVEREAUX How long before he breaks? \nELISE At this rate. Too long. The theatre was hit nine hours after we took down the first cell. \nDEVEREAUX So -- what other models do we have -- \nNo one wants to be the first to step into uncharted terrain. \nDEVEREAUX Shaking. \nNobody answers. \nDEVEREAUX What about it, Sharon? \nELISE -- Won't work. \nDEVEREAUX Works for the Israelis. \nELISE Only in conjunction with sleep deprivation. Needs at least thirty- six hours. \nHub stares at Sharon -- as the dark side of her professional life is revealed. \nDEVEREAUX We don't have thirty-six hours. \nAnother silence. They're teetering on the edge of the abyss. \nDEVEREAUX Electric shock? \nELISE The neurotransmitters just shut down. \nDEVEREAUX Water? \nCOL. HARDWICK Palestinian authority is producing good intel using water. \nHub finally can't take another second. Even in theory. \nHUB Are you people insane --? \nDEVEREAUX The time has come for one man to suffer in order to save the lives of hundreds \nHUB How about two men? How about three? How about public executions, that might work. \nDEVEREAUX You're welcome to wait outside. \nHUB General... you've lost men, I've lost men... but what you're doing... It doesn't work in Belfast. It doesn't work in Gaza. And it won't work here. (it comes slowly at first, then in a rush:) -- What if... they don't want their leader back at all? You said yourself, we don't even have him. Maybe what they really want -- is that we herd our children into stadiums. Put soldiers into our streets. Radicalize people who want to think of themselves as Americans. Bend the law, shred the constitution. (searches for the kind of words that come so hard to him:) Because if we torture him -- and let's call it what it is... You... and I... then the country men like us have sworn to defend. And bled to defend. And died to defend... is gone. (a deep breath) And they've won. \nGen. Devereaux stares hard at Hub. And then: \nDEVEREAUX (to Col. Hardwick) I think we have to soundproof the room before we begin. \nHub looks at Sharon, who looks away. \nDEVEREAUX Escort him out. \nThe two MPs lead Hub out of the room. \nDEVEREAUX Let's get this over with. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nTIME CUT TO: \nOUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM -- HOURS LATER \nSharon emerges from the shower room. She is shattered. The blood drained from her face. As if carrying with her all the sin that was committed in the next room. \nFROM INSIDE THE SHOWER ROOM \nThe sound of a GUNSHOT. The door opens and Devereaux emerges, in the torment of a man of honor who is living a lie. \nShe doesn't want to reveal herself this way. Doesn't want to be vulnerable. Doesn't want to cling to him. For a moment He puts his arms around her, but it's like holding a beautiful, dangerous predator. \nHUB -- But first, you helped them. \nShe senses the hardness in his tone. Looks up at him, and through tears, puts her game face back on. \nELISE What do you mean --? \nHUB They were being slaughtered. They needed to get out. But they were on the watch list. So you got them visas. You and Samir. \nELISE I promised we would take care of them. They were working... for us. \nHUB Doing what, exactly? \nELISE I don't know what you mean. \nHUB You said you trained them. Tradecraft. Subversion. That's what you said, right? (she nods) Only you left something out, didn't you... Didn't you, Sharon? (she can't bring herself to look at him) You taught them how to make bombs. \nThe tears are streaming down her face now. Finally, she nods. \nHUB -- And now they're here, doing what you taught 'em. \nThe streetlight catches Sharon's face. Her eyes are haunted. \nELISE And I'm going to have to live with the hell of that for the rest of my life. \nCUT TO: \nTHE BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- (TO ESTABLISH) -- NEXT MORNING \nTALK RADIO (V.O.) -- the people of Brooklyn will not be held hostage! This afternoon, join community and religious leaders in a march to protest the mass arrests -- \nSequence omitted from original script. \nCUT TO: \nSequence omitted from original script. \nBOROUGH HALL PARK -- LATER THAT DAY \nMARCH ORGANIZER (handing out leaflets) March on city hall. Today. No fear. \nHub and Frank are standing outside Hub's car, each on opposite sides, blocking any opportunity to suveil what is happening within. \nSharon sits inside with Samir. She uses a SCALPEL to make the slightest INCISION under Samir's arm. The RADIO plays. \nSAMIR Ahhhhhh... \nELISE In case you decide to go on walkabout. \nInto the incision she inserts a tiny plastic TRANSMITTER. \nELISE How did you make contact? \nSAMIR He is Afghani. Ahhhh. He got word to my uncle at the bath-house. You never met him. \nELISE But you're sure he'll show up. \nSAMIR (trembling) Sharon, they are all dead but the last cell and they are crazy with fear. Just tell me the message and I will pass it on. \nELISE I need to deliver it in person. Believe me, they'll want to hear what I have to say. \nShe turns off the radio. \nOUTSIDE THE CAR \nHub and Frank glance inconspicuously around. \nHUB You watch the game? \nOn a piece of paper he has scribbled, \"Hit Hardwick. Safe House. 11:00.\" \nFRANK (nods yes, then:) Kannell was really on. \nHub then writes. \"Bath-house. 12:00.\" \nFRANK (nods again) Think they'll make the play-offs? \nHub looks at him. There's been little time for sentiment. \nHUB How's your boy? \nFRANK He's alright. Thanks for getting him out. \nSharon steps out of the car. In her hands is a device resembling a PORTABLE OSCILLOSCOPE. A green dot appears. \nELISE That's Samir. \nHUB (looks in at Samir) Green is about right. \nHe slips Sharon the scribbled notes. As she looks at them: \nELISE He's terrified. Then again, so am I. \nTHE APARTMENT \nSharon goes to a closet and takes out some old clothes. She TURNS OFF THE TV. Then: \nELISE Here. Put this on. We don't want our friends sweating too much while they wait. \nIN THE VAN \nHardwick speaks into a handset. \nCOL. HARDWICK They're getting ready to move. Units 1 and 2, on my signal -- \nSUDDENLY -- THREE UNMARKED FBI CARS \nSeem to materialize out of nowhere -- boxing them in. \nIN THE VAN \nCOL. HARDWICK What the -- \nON THE STREET \nUndercover FEDERAL AGENTS roust Army CID agents. An FBI agent with a deep drawl, spread-eagles one against a building: \nSOUTHERN FBI AGENT Hi, there, I'm new in town. Can you direct me to Carnegie Hall, or should I just go fuck myself -- \nThe NYPD under the command of Danny Sussman -- roll up the rest of the sound garden -- examine the parabolic microphones. \nAGENTS WIELDING SHOTGUNS \nBlow off the rear door of the surveillance van. Frank enters and looks around at all the high-tech, microwave technology. \nFRANK Ah, microwave. \nTWO WOMEN \nIn chadors, faces VEILED, descend a back staircase. Only as their faces emerge from the shadows and are caught by a dim bulb do we recognize Sharon and Samir. \nSharon unlocks a metal door to reveal THE HIDDEN COURTYARD of a neighboring building. She and Samir hurry through a back alley and out into an adjacent street. \nBOROUGH HALL (WAS SHOT AS 194) \nWhere several APC's suddenly roar up and BLOCK off the square. Devereaux stands nearby, watching as: \nLIEUTENANT #2 (though a bullhorn) This is an unlawful gathering. You must disperse. I repeat -- \nSoldiers in full RIOT GEAR emerge to form a battle line: images of Selma, 1963; Chicago, 1968; Los Angeles, 1993. \nPROTEST SPEAKER Join together! Join hands! \nTHE MARCHERS LINK ARMS \nArab clerics and Hassidic rabbis, Black civic leaders and Hispanic gang members -- all continue to CHANT, \"No fear!\" \nTHE YOUNG SOLDIERS Nervously look at one another as the marchers begin to move. \nLIEUTENANT #2 (through a bullhorn) These soldiers carry live ammunition. This is your final warning. \n\"No Fear... No Fear...\" Devereaux watches in dread as the marchers close the gap on the battle-line of anxious soldiers is this why he became a soldier? \nA YOUNG GIRL unselfconsciously approaches a young soldier. Looks into his eyes. Smiles. And walks past. Another marcher walks right past a soldier, who does nothing to stop her. Soon, they are all surging past the riot-line. \nDEVEREAUX watches, as something is revealed to him, something about America that, until this moment, he had forgotten. \nIN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN \nFrank is fiddling with the new technology like a kid at Christmas. But something is wrong. Where once there were TWO GHOSTLY IMAGES of Samir and Sharon in the apartment -- now there is NOTHING. \nON HUB'S OSCILLOSCOPE \nThe RADIO-SIGNAL of Samir's transmitter still registers as an unmoving, steadily blinking light. Hub is watching the building. Frank steps out the van, his face pale. \nFRANK We've got a problem. \nHUB AND FRANK \nPound up the stairs of the building. \nTHE DOOR TO THE CLEAN APARTMENT \nBursts open. Hub comes in low and fast. Frank comes in hard on his heels. \nIn the center of the otherwise empty room, the white sheet, SMEARED IN BLOOD, is draped over a chair. \nFRANK What the -- \nHub stares in dread fascination. \nHUB It's a shroud. \nAnd he's out the door in a heartbeat. \nSequence omitted from original script. \n", "test1_input": "Has been hastily improvised behind a SWAT van. \nFRANK The driver's name is Larry Kaiser. He says they've got explosives strapped to their chests, they got automatic weapons, and they're speaking Arabic. \nHUB Where the hell's the negotiator? \nFRANK Tunnel's got twenty minute delays and they're working on both bridges. \nHUB (to the cop) What else did he say about the device? Did he describe it at all? Anything about a button, or a cord, or... \nTHE FIRST ENG TRUCK \nPulls up and raises its satellite dish. \nELISE (almost involuntary) Oh, God. \nFrank turns to look at her. She is suddenly pale. \nELISE (as it dawns on her) ...They're not here to negotiate. \nFRANK Meaning? \nELISE They were waiting for the cameras. \nHub is deep in conversation with the cops. Frank interrupts. \nFRANK -- Hub... \nHub looks up. Frank nods for Elise to repeat what she said. \nELISE They're want the newsies here. They want everybody watching. \nHub and Frank look at each other. Can this be true? \nELISE You've got the shooters in place? \nFRANK -- So? \nELISE Use 'em. \nHUB What? \nELISE Kill 'em now. \nThey just look at her. \nELISE It's lose-lose any way you play it... Do you want to lose little or lose big? \nThe NYPD officer has been listening: \nNYPD OFFICER I got the marksmen on the com -- They're looking for a clean shot. \nAs the Policeman waits for a response on his radio, two more NEWS VANS pull up. The MEDIA CIRCUS has come to town: reporters breathlessly offer their live, on-the-scene reports. Hub and Elise stare at one another. \nNYPD OFFICER Shooter says they've got the passengers all standing in the aisles. He says, no go. \nHub can see the dread in Elise's eyes. As the seconds tick away, TWO NEWS HELICOPTER jockey for position above. \nHUB (to the cops) We have rules of engagement we're gonna follow here, folks, so put the safeties back on your weapons. (looks at Elise) Nobody's killing anybody until we see what's what. \nHe grabs the phone. \nHUB (on the phone) Larry, this is Agent Hubbard of the FBI, I'll be negotiating our way out of this. Let me talk to one of them... I know... I know. You just hang in there, Larry... No, don't worry, I've got somebody here who can translate. \nHe looks over at Frank, who's listening on another cell. \nHUB (on the phone) Sir, -- My name is Anthony Hubbard. I don't have any authority to make deals, or respond to demands. I just want to find out if you need anything in there? If any of the passengers are in need of medical attention? \nHe waits as Frank translates. Hub covers the mouthpiece. \nHUB -- Frank? \nFRANK I don't know if they understand. \nHUB (on the phone) Sir, is there anything you want to say to me? That I can tell my people here? \nFRANK The guy's just breathing into the phone, maybe they're not even Arabs. \nHUB (on the phone) I get the feeling you don't want to talk, but will you listen --? ...Whatever grievance you have, whatever quarrel -- surely it doesn't involve these children -- \nStill no response. \nHUB (on the phone) So I'm gonna ask you to... please... let... the... children go. \nNo response -- then suddenly, the bus doors HISS OPEN \nAnd six bewildered, ashen-faced CHILDREN step out before the doors HISS closed behind them. As Hub and a couple of the cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the children cross the NO-MAN'S LAND to safety, a smattering of APPLAUSE breaks out among the cops. Elise tries to hold back tears. \nFRANK Okay, here we go... \nHUB (on the phone) Thank you, sir. I appreciate that gesture, I really do. The best way to get what you want in these situations is to show yourself to be reasonable. As you've just done. (Haddad translates) Now we've got some more to talk about... \nElise watches as the news cameras zoom in. \n", "test1_true": "Frank shakes his head, don't do this. Hub's look says translate it. Frank does it. They all wait. \nHUB (on the phone) I'm gonna take your silence to mean you're considering my offer -- \nElise looks at Frank, she can't help but admire his bravery. \nHUB How about we just start with a few of the elderly people you got on there. It's got to be hard for the older folks to be standing all this time. \nHub looks back at Frank. Still no response. \nAND THEN THE BUS DOORS HISS OPEN AGAIN. A few elderly PASSENGERS start down the steps. \nHUB (on the phone) Thank you, sir. Now let's just let these -- \nTHE EXPLOSION OF THE BUS \nHurls Hub backwards as: \nALL SOUND FADES OUT \nTo be replaced by a high-end, almost electronic WHITE NOISE. \nSHRAPNEL \nImbeds itself into car doors, bus benches, doorways as every WINDOW in a three-block radius is SHATTERED... \nRED BLOOD \nReplaces blue paint in a horrific shower. \nHUB \nFights for consciousness. \nAGENTS \nRush to his side to see if he is alright -- but WE CANNOT HEAR them. Though their mouths move it is only the WHITE NOISE that overwhelms us -- as we realize that Hub has been momentarily DEAFENED by the blast. \nWhen at last Hub manages to speak, his words are MUFFLED and INDISTINCT -- as if the playback heads of a tape recorder needed to be cleaned. \nHUB I'm... alright. I'm -- \nFrank Haddad bends down close and we can lip-read him saying, \"Just hang in there, buddy. . .\" \nHUB -- okay... Just let me -- \nAnd then he leans over to VOMIT in the street. \nTHE SOUND OF SIRENS \nSlowly bleeds in through the white noise -- mercifully for us, and for Hub, who wipes his mouth and looks up, realizing that his HEARING is coming back. He reaches for Frank's outstretched hand and stands, albeit woozily. \nHUB Is anybody -- \nBut the look in Frank's eyes says it all. \nTHE DEVASTATION \nIs numbing. IMAGES we associate with other countries. And then he sees Elise. Her face is cut and bleeding, but as their eyes meet, her look is one of absolute compassion. \nHARD CUT TO: \nMORE THAN A HUNDRED AGENTS \nCrowded into the now-overflowing BULLPEN. In absolute denial of his physical condition, Hub paces like a caged animal. \nHUB -- every trap, every hole. I want to rumble every mosque, every community center, every student organization that's ever said an unkind word. I want the heat turned up under all our assets, all our informers, every snitch gets twisted inside out. And put some money out on the street -- Arab community hates these people as much as we do. They'll help. (turns to Mike) Have you got positive ID on -- \nMIKE Hub, we don't have positive ID on anybody. \nHUB We need more hands. Fred -- \nFRED I'm on it. \nHe picks up a phone and begins requesting Agent transfers. \nHUB I want to talk to Khalil. \nTINA He's down the hall. \nNow she picks up a phone and adds to the cacophony. \nHUB -- Conferences with DC at 9:00, 12:00, 4:00 and 9:00. Call your families, find a sleeping bag, nobody leaves this office until we have a strand to pull. Oklahoma City, people. The first twenty-four hours are the only twenty-four hours.. And I don't want to see anybody walking. \nTEN MINUTES LATER - OUTSIDE A HOLDING CELL \nHub and Frank watch Khalil through a VIDEO MONITOR. The bruises on Khalil's face have deepened. \nHUB Doctor seen him? \nTINA He's on his way up. \nHUB Got a cigarette --? \n", "test2_input": "A JEEP pulls up and Elise/Sharon gets out. \nHUB Sharon. \nTheir silence speaks volumes. With Sharon is an OFFICER. \nELISE This is Colonel Hardwick. Army Intelligence. \nHUB (shaking hands) Anthony Hubbard. Average intelligence. (clocking him) But 'til I hear otherwise this is still my show. \nCOL. HARDWICK I'm here as an advisor only. I intend to keep a low profile. \nHUB I appreciate that, Colonel. \nCOL. HARDWICK I don't mean to be insensitive, but what, exactly, are your capabilities at this point? Your... infrastructure -- \nHUB You're standing on our infrastructure. Excuse me. \nHub walks back toward the rubble. Sharon watches him go. \nCUT TO: \nHUB'S APARTMENT -- THAT NIGHT \nSofas have been pushed against the wall. Hub's apartment now serves as a temporary command post. Agents huddle together -- poring over the charred or soggy remnants of files. \nFLOYD -- They managed to get a partial VIN# off the van. DMV says it was reported stolen the day before in -- \nHUB -- Brooklyn. \nDANNY Fiber thinks they've come up with a piece of the shroud. Egyptian cotton. \nFrank joins them. \nFRANK (grim) We just got a confirmation on Mike. He was with Fred in the lobby. \nHUB How many does that make it --? \nA KNOCK on the door. They look at one another. One of the agents answers it. Elise/Sharon. She walks over to them. \nELISE I'm... very sorry... about your friends. \nHUB (giving her nothing) Frank. This is Sharon. (to her) -- I didn't catch the last name. \nELISE ...Bridger. How ya doin' Frank? \nFRANK Been better. \nShe nods. Takes from her purse a folder, labeled in Hebrew. \nELISE The agency has come up with another list of probables. \nShe takes out photos. Neither Hub nor Frank react. She puts them on the coffee table. No one reaches for them. \nELISE I think we should circulate them. (they stonewall her:) Hey, this stuff may be good. \nHUB Why was there no warning from Samir? \nELISE Because he didn't know anything. \nFRANK Says Samir. \nELISE Says me. \nHUB Maybe I'll ask him. \nELISE Over my dead body. \nHUB Over six hundred dead bodies. \nThey stare at one another. Both are tired and raw. \nELISE Look, he's one of the good guys. Okay? \nHUB How the fuck can you be so sure? \nELISE Because he helped me recruit the network in Iraq. OKAY? \nHe just stares at her. \nELISE We were part of the operation to destabilize Saddam Hussein. Printing up fake dinars, arming the Kurds -- \nHUB -- and financing the Sheik. \nELISE He's Iraqi. He was going to be our Ayatollah Khomeini -- \nHUB -- And help bring down Saddam. \nELISE I ran the network. Samir was the go- between. He risked his life for us over there. \nHUB So who are they? Give me names, Give me pictures. Not some history lesson. \nELISE I can't give you pictures because I don't know what they look like. We did everything at arm's length. \n", "test2_true": "ELISE I've got Samir. \nHUB Has he had any contact with them? \nELISE Minimal. \nHUB How does he do it? \nELISE He can't. They initiate. \nHUB And otherwise... \nELISE He's waiting. \nHUB He's waiting? What's he waiting for? More bodies? We got lots more buildings in midtown, maybe he's waiting to see how many they can blow up. \nELISE Look, I know how you must feel -- \nHUB YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT HOW I FEEL -- MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE DEAD. \nELISE They'll make contact soon. \nHUB How?... Why soon? \nShe looks at him, refusing to divulge anything more. Suddenly, Hub grabs her arm and roughly shoves her into: \nTHE BATHROOM \nHUB (viciously) What's the tradecraft, Sharon? Ironsites, visuals? I love all that spy shit. (still, she says nothing) I'm gonna haul your boy downtown, strap his ass to a polygraph and ask him all about you. Then I'm gonna send the transcripts to a friend of mine at the Times who just loves to write about the latest CIA link to some political horror show. \nELISE You burn him, you lose any chance you ever had. \nHUB It's lose-lose from here on in, who said that? \nELISE I'm not fucking with you. \nHUB How can you possibly remember who you're fucking? \nShe slaps him, hard. Without hesitation he slaps her back. She claws at his face, but he grabs her wrist and bends her arm behind her back. \nELISE I need... more time. Please. You're hurting me. Please... \nSomething in the violence of the moment is more than a little charged. \nCUT TO: \nVARIOUS SHOTS -- THE SURVEILLANCE OF SHARON AND SAMIR \nA dead drop by a hot dog stand. Out for her morning jog. A series of FREEZE FRAMES as the motordrive CLICKS AND WHIRS. \nFRANK (V.O.) That's good sound. \nHUB (V.O.) Except they're not saying anything worth listening to. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nIN A HAMMAM (BATH-HOUSE) \nSamir chats with a couple of older men in the steaming waters. MORE FREEZE FRAMES: \nFRANK (V.O.) One's his uncle, he owns the place. The other's a doctor. They check out clean. \nHUB (V.O.) He go there every day? \nFRANK (V.O.) A clean body and a pure heart. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nA TV LOGO: FOX NEWS SPECIAL REPORT: NEW YORK UNDER SIEGE \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) \"Tonight we take a close look at the tragic sight of a city under siege.\" \nHUB'S APARTMENT \nHub sits on his sofa, watching the special report. Spread out before him, the surveillance PHOTOS of Sharon and Samir. \nVIDEO CLIPS \nA deserted Times Square. Police checking packages of shoppers in front of a department store. Long lines of security at bus stops. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN - NEXT MORNING \nHub and Frank are walking downtown. At a stoptlight, A BUS idles beside them, a POLICEMAN onboard. \nRADIO DJ (V.O.) -- claiming responsibility for the bombing. In other news, a cab driver was beaten and his cab set on fire. The driver, Rashid Abu -- \nANOTHER CAR. TALK RADIO: \nTALK RADIO (O.S.) -- the Jews, man. When they say, jump, we say, how high. I say we -- \nFRANK -- If you're on the State Department Terrorist Watch list you cannot get into this country. But Ali Waziri was on the watch list, and he got in. \n", "test3_input": "ELISE -- But... that's what you want, isn't it? Why you've done all this -- \nBELT OF SEMTEX EXPLOSIVES \nComes next. Velcro straps fasten the belt around his chest. \nSAMIR No. It's not. \nHe comes to stand beside her. \nSAMIR I want you to bleed... as we have bled. \nELISE Samir, the Koran preaches -- \nSAMIR Do not speak to me of the Koran, woman. (fighting his emotion) You take our leader. A holy man. You put him in prison for preaching the word of God. You must learn the consequences of trying to tell the world how to live. \nELISE (with rising terror) But it's over, your point's been made, why spill any more blood? Those poor people out there in the street, they're fucking marching for your cause... \nSAMIR Yes. (fastens the last strap on his semtex harness) And they, too, will become its martyrs. \nA VOICE from the top of the stairs: \nHUB (V.O.) Let her go and you'll live. \nSamir looks up, sees Hub aiming his .45. But Sharon is between them, blocking his shot. \nFrom outside, we HEAR the sound of the marchers' CHANTING, \"No Fear...! No Fear...!\" Samir HEARS it, too. \nSAMIR Move away from the door. \nELISE NO --!!! \nHUB Let her go and you'll live -- \nELISE DON'T --!!!! \nSAMIR (screaming, panicked) GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR --!!! \nHUB SAMIR --! \nSAMIR YOU WANT TO DIE --!! \nThey're all SCREAMING at once. Still Samir keeps inching toward the stairs. Hub blocks the way. \nHUB No way you're going out there. \nSamir jams the gun into Sharon's ribs. \nSAMIR MOVE AWAY --! \nSharon's eyes meet Hubs'. \nELISE Shoot. \nHUB Shut up. \nELISE Shoot. \nHUB SHUT UP... \nSamir is edging ever closer. Starting up the stairs. Sharon's eyes plead with Hub, begging for a kind of unholy redemption. \nELISE SHOOT ME --!!! \nHUB I... CAN'T --! \nELISE YOU HAVE TO. (weeping now) You... promised... \nHub's finger tightens on the trigger. But then slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, he lowers his gun. \nELISE (sobbing) No --!!! \nSAMIR It is God's will. \nHis left hand moves imperceptibly toward the RIPCORD of the explosive device. \nHUB If there is a God, he weeps at the crimes we commit in his name. \nHIS FIRST SHOT \nRips through Sharon into Samir, blowing them both backwards. \nHIS SECOND SHOT \nIs to Samir's hand as it reaches for the ripcord. \nTHE THIRD SHOT \nIs a killing headshot. Rolling him into the baths. \nCLOUD OF BLOOD \nBlooms in the cleansing water. The funeral shroud billows. \n", "test3_true": "Still rings in the tiled room as Hub kneels beside Sharon. \nHUB (on radio) Officer down. OFFICER DOWN --! \nELISE Is... he... dead? \nHUB ...Shhhhhhh... \nELISE (whispers) ...no... regrets... \nHub cradles her head. \nHUB You... knew. \nELISE (the saddest smile) I... wondered. \nFRANK HADDAD \nAppears at the top of the steps. Behind him, two PARAMEDICS race down to kneel beside Sharon. Hub is pushed aside as they begin triage -- but it doesn't look good as suddenly, she begins to convulse. \nHUB Sharon... SHARON -- \nELISE ... Emma... My name... is Emma. \nAnd then she begins to mumble, at first incoherently, and then more clearly. We realize she's speaking Arabic. \nHUB -- what are you? I don't... \nAnd then Frank is standing above them. Tears in his eyes. \nFRANK (translating) \"I... seek refuge... king of kings...\" \nAnd Hub suddenly understands: she is preparing for her own death. He holds her as she continues to pray in and out of her two native tongues. Until, at last: \nSHARON/EMMA (whispers) Allah Ahkbar. God is great -- \nFRANK Allah Ahkbar -- \nHUB Amen. \nAnd she's gone. \nOUTSIDE IN THE STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER \nA block away, we can see the Marchers pass by. The chant of \"No Fear...\" fades into the distance. But Hub has already turned his back and is hurrying away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER \nHub hurries toward the Courthouse. \nMOMENTS LATER - IN THE COURTHOUSE \nJUDGE FRANKEL opens the door. He is taken aback by the blood on Hub's clothes. \nHUB I want to talk about a free society. \nBACK TO: \nTHE STADIUM COMMAND POST \nWhere Devereaux is watching coverage of the march. \nTV SOUND BITE (V.O.) -- \"a very moving moment in which the people of a city step forward to declare their courage and solidarity -- \nHe looks up to see Hub. He's carrying the ACCORDION FILE that the Chief of Staff gave him. \nDEVEREAUX Agent Hubbard, do you want to tell me exactly what you mean detaining Colonel Hardwick and six of my CID staff. Because that strikes me as a very peculiar idea of interagency liaison. \nHUB The last cell has been taken down. It was Samir. I took him out. \nDEVEREAUX What makes you so sure he was the last cell? \nHUB Sharon. \nDEVEREAUX Sharon is not trustworthy. \nHUB Sharon is dead. She gave her life. (takes a piece of paper from his pocket) This is a writ from the US District Court releasing all those being held here without habeus corpus. \nDEVEREAUX My authority supersedes the civilian judiciary under the decree of martial law. (a rueful smile) Sorry. \nHUB Your authority ends now. It's all over. \nDEVEREAUX What's over. \nHUB (looks at him) They're going to release him. \nDEVEREAUX Release him? \nHUB The Sheik. (holds up the Chief of Staff's' file) Clear violation of international law, Congressional oversight statutes, a couple of treaties, the Federal perjury statute, and my favorite, the Logan Act, for conducting your own personal foreign policy. (simply) I know the whole story, General. \nDEVEREAUX You don't know shit. Poor suffering Sharon and her poor suffering people. It's called \"going native\" -- the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it. She had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it. And now they're getting exactly what they want, which is the Sheik will be back in the mix. But ten times as strong, because now he's the big man who stood up to the Americans. (looks at Hub) I did what was necessary. I make no apologies. If you think you're going to be able to use that file against me, you know even less about politics than I imagined. \n"}

{"test1_input": "BACK TO -- THE 99 BUS \nThe doors hang off their hinges. As the PASSENGERS tumble off, we SEE they are covered in BLUE PAINT. \nBACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR \nHUB -- What?! \nFRANK -- That's what they're telling me. \nHUB -- And nobody's hurt? \nFrank nods. Hubs closes his eyes in gratitude. \nHUB Thank God. \nCUT TO: \nTHE JOINT FBI/NYPD TERRORISM TASK FORCE - FEDERAL BLDG \nThey're listening to a tape-recording, altered by a VO-CORDER: \nTAPED VOICE -- our first and last warning. \nAs the MESSAGE continues, we PAN the faces: MIKE JOHANNSON, squad supervisor, and DANNY SUSSMAN, representing NYPD. \nTAPED VOICE We expect our demand to be met. There will be no negotiation. That is all. \nTINA Demand for what? You hear any demand? \nMIKE You sure this is all they got? \nSUSSMAN That's it. \nFRANK Maybe it's performance art. \nSussman shoots him a look. Clearly Haddad enjoys pushing his buttons. Finally, Hub stands up. \nHUB -- Okay. Blue paint. Voice-altering technology -- \nFRANK -- available from The Sharper Image catalogue. \nSUSSMAN Last I looked they weren't offering exploding paint bombs. \nHUB Still, the rhetoric sounds political. Militia? \nTINA Not their style. \nHUB Frank --? \nFRANK Jihad isn't known for their sense of humor, and Hamas is raising so much money here, why queer their deal? \nTINA Anyway, isn't Green the color of Islam, not blue? \nFRANK -- And, excuse me, but why do we immediately assume they're Arabs? \nHUB I want a composite of the suspects in circulation by the end of business today. Tina, you cross-check it against the mainframe. Mike, have you got the lab analysis on the paint? \nMIKE Not yet... \nHUB -- See if any was sold in quantity the last month. Danny -- \nTina's phone buzzes. She picks it up as Hub keeps going: \nHUB -- find out what stop these guys got on the bus, maybe there's a witness. \nFRANK Hub... I think we're all eager to give up our weekends on this. It just occurs to me, has anybody even committed a crime here? I mean, assault with a deadly color? \nHub deals with Haddad's irreverence by ignoring it. \nHUB Here's what I don't like. They know explosives. They know our response time. They put in a call and walk. \nA young agent, FRED DARIUS, hands Hub a piece of paper: \nFRED Excuse me, sir. I think you should see this. Came in on the Fax. \nOnly two words are written: \"RELEASE HIM.\" \nHUB Release him? Him who? Who are we holding? \nTINA Marv Albert? \nSUSSMAN McVeigh? Sheik what's-his-name from the Trade Center. \nFRANK -- Omar Abdel Rahman... asshole. \nFRED The Hamas guy got released in April. \nFRANK Under protest. \nHUB (looks at the fax) Why be coy about it? \nSUSSMAN You think it's phony? \n", "test1_true": "Off Hub's look, we: \nCUT TO: \nAN OLD WAREHOUSE IN BROOKLYN - DUSK \nHub and Haddad join AGENT FLOYD ROSE, a tall Black man. \nAGENT ROSE -- She's looking for wiring signatures on the device and asking for copies of any latent prints we've managed to lift. \nHUB -- Agency? \nAGENT ROSE Smells like it. Turns out she's also been talking to some of the passengers. \nTHEY OPEN THE DOOR \nIn the klieg lights -- THE BUS. Men in white coats dust every inch and generally behave as if investigating a crashed UFO. In their midst, a young WOMAN, midwestern pretty in a serious suit. She looks up as Hub enters. \nHUB Hi. \nWOMAN Hi, there. \nHUB Special Agent Anthony Hubbard. FBI. \nWOMAN Oh, shit, I've been trying to liaise with you all day. My name is Elise Kraft, National Security Council. \nShe offers her hand. Hub doesn't take it yet. \nHUB -- And you've been trying to \"liaise\" with me all day? Did you think of trying the phone book, Elise? We have fourteen lines, that's not counting the unlisted ones. \nELISE (still holds out hand) Hi, I'm Elise Kraft, National Security Council. \nFinally, he takes her hand. And doesn't let go. \nHUB And I'm Colin Powell. What exactly do you people want with my bus. \nShe tries to take her hand away, but he tightens his grip. \nELISE We're all on the same team here, Agent Hubbard. \nHUB Who exactly is \"we\" on this particular team, Elise? \nELISE It's never the question that's indiscreet, only the answer. \nHe smiles. She smiles back. Convinced she's charmed him. \nHUB Tell you what, you send me an official inter-agency request for cooperation on this and I'll give you copies of everything we come up with. Otherwise, get your ass on out of here before you contaminate my crime scene any more than you already have. \nELISE There's no reason to be nasty. \nHUB You think this is nasty? (smiles) In case you haven't heard. The CIA has no charter to operate domestically. Which puts you in violation of federal law. \nELISE Not according to the Cooperation Agreement, Special Order 12333 -- I suggest you reread the paragraph on sharing information. I happen to be well within my authority. \nHUB Special Order 12333 refers to domestic terrorism. You got something you want to \"share\" with me? (he waits... but no answer is forthcoming) Us being teammates and all? \nELISE (holds up a clipboard) Unfortunately, not yet. But as soon as I do, I'll -- \nHUB -- get back to me, yeah, I know. (takes the clipboard from her hands) Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna have a couple my \"teammates\" here escort you back to wherever you came from. And then I'm gonna go back to the office and wait for that official cooperation request. Okay by you? \nELISE Swell. \nHUB Nice meeting you, Elise. Is that Elise with an \"E\" or an \"A\"? \nELISE Nice meeting you, too, Special Agent Hubbard. \nOUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE \nHub watches as Elise is led away by two AGENTS. Agent Rose stands nearby. \nHUB Tail her. \nNICE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nIn Frank Haddad's home. The Haddad's are celebrating the day FRANK JR. has finished reading the Holy Koran. \nFRANK JR (O.S.) (in Arabic) \"In the Name of Allah, the beneficent, the merciful. Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of Men, the King of Men.\" \nFrank's TEACHER offers the final benediction. Those who are Muslim cover their face with their palms. \nTEACHER (in Arabic) \"Make me know that which I have become ignorant of; and make me recite it in the hours of the night and the day; and make it an argument for me O Thou Sustainer of all the worlds!\" Ameen! \nALL Ameen. \nLater -- \nThe guests mingle, eat pastries and drink sweet tea. \nTINA ...Nice, wasn't it? \nHUB Very. \nTINA (after a moment) You ever gonna stop by, pick up your things? \n", "test1_id": 3033, "test2_input": "Nearby, Mike and Danny observe them. \nDANNY -- He doing her? \nMIKE Some detective you are. They stopped. \nFRED Really? I wonder if she likes white guys. \nDANNY I wonder if she likes bald guys. \nHub, meanwhile, congratulates Frank's wife, NAJIBA. \nHUB You must be so proud... \nNAJIBA Small children, small worries. Big children -- \nFRANK -- big orthodontia bills. Someday, you'll understand. \nAnd then Frank notices Hub's DRIVER standing in the doorway. \nFRANK Where we going? \nHUB You're staying with your family. I'm back in the morning. \nCUT TO: \nSequence omitted from original script. \nSequence omitted from original script. (ALREADY SHOT) \nINT. HUB'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING \nHub is looking at surveillance photos of Elise. Frank enters. \nFRANK You sleep here? (Hub smiles, but doesn't look up) Immigration called. \nA SMALL GREEN ROOM -- AS SEEN THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR \nHub and Frank watch a dark-skinned MAN being questioned by a uniformed OFFICIAL. An INS Supervisor shows them a false- bottomed suitcase stuffed with money. \nINS OFFICIAL -- all in small bills. So we figure, smurf, right? Then I think, considering the gentleman's nationality, plus where he's been recently, we better call Frank. \nFRANK -- who's trying to score points with his boss, bigtime. \nHUB Has he broken any laws? \nINS OFFICIAL No, sir. He's twenty bucks under the $10,000 limit. \nFRANK (pulls out a $20 bill) Not anymore. \nIN THE ROOM \nThe official hopes volume breaks the language barrier. \nUNIFORMED OFFICIAL ...so, Kahlil, you're saying this is an INHERITANCE? Somebody DIED and you're bringing them the MONEY? \nThe dark-skinned man is trying to keep up: \nKAHLIL No, no... dhouri. \nBEHIND THE MIRROR \nFRANK ...He means, \"dowry.\" \nHUB Check out his neck. \nSmall puckered SCARS. The INS guy looks confused. \nFRANK The tabac. (mimics putting out a cigarette on his arm) Sssssss... The territories. \nHUB (thinks a moment) Put him in play. \nCUT TO: \nTHE VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY \nHub and Frank in a rental CONTOUR, tail Khalil, in a cab: \nHUB (on the phone) -- on the Van Wyck... No, not yet. (to Frank) -- What are we in? \nFRANK A '97 Contour. On my Visa. (watches Khalil) Back home, the security services'd be up this guy's ass with a poker, but what do we do, we let him go. \nHUB (still on the phone) ...Six teams on the ground, at least... well, pull 'em off the UN... (to Haddad) Stay back... \nFRANK Not my first date, Hub. (the TAXI changes lanes) He's taking the BQE. Looks like it's Brooklyn. \nHUB (still on the phone) I want husbands and wives, I want baby carriages, and no Brooks Brothers. \nFRANK You're micro-managing. \nHUB (still on the phone) -- And find me a judge I can work with. We want sound on this guy... damn'... I'm losing you... (raises his voice) And bring us a radio. \nFRANK I get reimbursed for this, right? \n", "test2_true": "ATLANTIC AVENUE - BROOKLYN \nThe Third World. Teeming, roiling, Kinshasha meets Beirut meets Tel Aviv meets Moscow. Hand-written shop signs in Arabic and Hebrew, boom boxes throbbing out \"Oum Khatoum,\" the latest neo-Palestinian techno-rock. \nKHALIL pays the taxi driver and starts off on foot. Hub's CONTOUR pulls over a safe distance behind and waits. An AGENT passes by and slips a WALKIE-TALKIE through the open window. \nMAN CARRYING GROCERIES \nFalls in behind Khalil, who ducks into a storefront, where WE CAN SEE him buying a Coca Cola and a Baby Ruth bar. \nIN THE CONTOUR \nFRANK (notes the purchase) Twelve bucks in Gaza. \nHUB America's the place to be if you're a terrorist. (on the walkie-talkie) Fred's hovering. Patsy, take over... \nA WOMAN WITH A STROLLER replaces the man carrying groceries. \nHUB ...Tell her to watch out for reflections. \nFRANK (hands him the phone) I got the Judge. \nHUB (on the phone) ...Good morning, Sir. How're things in the Second Circuit this morning...? ...I hear you... Listen, Judge, we're in a kind of situation here... \nKHALIL is on the move again. \nHUB (on the phone) Hold on, will ya, Judge? (into walkie-talkie) Is he talking to somebody, who's he talking to? Are we getting film? \nFROM A GREAT DISTANCE \nAn AGENT with a TELEPHOTO snaps a picture of Khalil, who has paused to chat with a PALESTINIAN of patrician good-looks. \nHUB (covering the phone) -- Frank? \nFRANK Don't know him. If we were allowed to get sound on them, we'd know him. \nThe walkie-talkie CRACKLES TO LIFE, confirming the photos. \nHUB (covering the radio) ...What's that? No, Judge, not yet we're not... but we have reason to believe he may be involved with -- (covers the phone again; keys the radio) Damnit Tommy! (to Frank) He's overacting! Tell him -- (back to the phone) Sorry, Judge... No... I just -- \nFRANK He's making him. Shit. Fuck. He's -- \nKhalil has a sixth sense from a lifetime on the West Bank. All of a sudden, he BREAKS INTO A RUN. \nHUB (keys radio) Go, go, go!!! All units -- \nHe slams the car into gear and PEELS OUT into traffic. \nSIX SURVEILLANCE TEAMS \nIn various guises, break cover and SPRINT after Khalil, who shifts into overdrive. Cars SCREECH to avoid flattening him. \nHub's CONTOUR pulls into traffic and finds his way blocked by a narrow passage between double-parked cars. He goes for it, SCRAPING his way between them. \nFRANK Christ! \nHUB (on the phone) Judge, I'm gonna have to call you back... \nKHALIL SPRINTS \nInto an open-air MARKET, KNOCKING DOWN veiled WOMEN with bags of fruit and vegetables. He VAULTS over stalls. \nThe CONTOUR scrapes PARKED CARS as it swerves into an alley, desperately trying to cut off Khalil's escape route. \nFRANK Shit --! I didn't take the insurance. \nA SOCCER BALL bounces into Hub's peripheral vision, followed by TWO BOYS. \nHUB SLAMS THE CONTOUR INTO THE WALL \nTo avoid killing the two boys. Hub gets out of the car and continues the pursuit on foot. He's gaining on Khalil, when: \nA VAN \nBears down on Khalil, its doors sliding open as TWO PAIRS OF HANDS reach out and ANOTHER MAN appears out of nowhere and BODYCHECKS Khalil into the van and jumps in after him. \nHUB What the --? \nThe van BURNS RUBBER and DISAPPEARS into traffic. \nMINUTES LATER -- \nAn impromptu huddle in the alley. AGENTS gather in a circle as RADIOS SQUELCH and HELICOPTERS circle above. \nFRED They just found the van. Doesn't look like they're gonna find any prints. \nThe Agent who took the pictures pulls a color xerox-type PHOTO from a digital printer in his car. Hub looks at the picture of Khalil and the good-looking Palestinian. \nHUB Run him down, bring him in. \nFred hands a cell phone to Hub. \nFRED Floyd Rose. \n", "test2_id": 3034, "test3_input": "FRANK Anybody like anchovies --? \nThen from across the room, Hub kneels beside an ominous- looking DEVICE. A claymore mine. \nHUB Goddamn it. GODDAMN IT. \nFRANK What --? \nHUB It didn't fire. They had it rigged to the door and it didn't fire. \nFrank stares at the lethal booby-trap. Hub shakes his head. \nHUB We're too old to be lucky, Frank. \nCUT TO: \nA DOWNTOWN BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT \nWhere Mike and Tina are dancing their asses off. Around them, other AGENTS from the takedown laugh and drink. \nAT A NEARBY TABLE \nHub and Elise sit, watch them cut loose. \nELISE (sips her drink) My first boyfriend was Palestinian. My father liked to say, they seduce you with their suffering. \nA WAITRESS brings her another drink. \nELISE You ever been over there --? (he shakes his head, no) ...The courtesy with which they welcome you into their homes. And the people, these incredibly... warm people in this... austere land. \nHUB But you work against them. \nELISE Only the crazies. I tend to be suspicious of all true believers. (looks at him) Present company included. \nHUB So I'm a fanatic. \nELISE Let's just say you don't seem the ambivalent type. \nHUB Is that right? \nELISE So why're are you a fed? \nHUB That's what my nephew keeps asking me. \"Why you with The Man, Unc?\" \nELISE ...Well? What'd you tell him? \nHUB You read my file. You tell me. \nELISE Let's see... Catholic school. Captain of this, president of that. Hard work, fair play, make a difference, change the system from within. Rah. Rah. Rah. \nHUB That was in my file? \nELISE ...Tell me I'm wrong. \nHe studies her for a moment. \nELISE ...What --? \nHUB You believe in anything, Elise --? \nELISE Like what, for instance? \nHUB How about right and wrong? \nELISE It's easy to choose between right and wrong. What's hard is choosing the wrong that's more right. I just want to make it all... a little... better. (finishes her drink) Ignore me. I'm shitfaced. \nFrank appears to lean over their table. \nFRANK So am I --! Hey, Elise... tell us about being a spook? Ever meet Aldrich Ames? Weren't you at the Bay of Pigs? \nELISE You were in charge of Waco, right -- ? Or was that Ruby Ridge? \nFRANK The Shah of Iran, Noriega, I love the way you guys predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union. \nELISE Yeah, yeah, yeah... And J. Edgar Hoover wore a dress. \nShe laughs and stands up to dance: \nELISE What do you say, Hub...? Peace? \nBut as he grudgingly stands up, a BALLAD comes on. They stand there awkwardly. Finally, he takes her into his arms. \nELISE This feels like high school. \nHUB -- only my prom date wasn't packing a gun. \nELISE Mine's a 9 mm. How big is yours? \nHUB Two inches. From the ground. (laughing, they dance closer) So what's the latest from Samir. I want a list of every visa he sponsored. \nELISE Not sure he'll do it. \nHUB I once knew this undercover guy, started to care so much about his source -- \n", "test3_true": "HUB Have you considered that he might also be in bed with the other side? \nELISE Samir in bed with them? That would too much to wish for. \nHUB You're so confident. \nELISE Only in bed. \nTina watches them. She rolls her eyes at Frank. And then: \nTHE GROUND SHAKES \nA low RUMBLE as the light FLICKERS and the chandelier sways. \nFRANK Whoa... What do they put in these drinks --? \nTINA They got earthquakes in Manhattan? \nBut Elise is not too drunk to make her way to the door. Hub joins her. Already, in the distance, the WAILING OF SIRENS. \nIN THE TOWN CAR -- SPEEDING UPTOWN ON MADISON AVE \nBlue light FLASHING. Hub, Elise and Frank sit grimly silent. \nTRAFFIC \nIs snarled and gridlocked at 40th. Finally, they can take it no longer and step out into a chorus of HONKING HORNS. \nTHEY BEGIN TO RUN \nPast the frustrated drivers. Turning the corner at 41st where: \nSMOKE BILLOWS \nFrom the New Victory Theatre -- where a gala benefit is taking place. \nGIRL IN A PRADA GOWN \nWalks toward CAMERA. She's stunning. From the jeweled clutchbag to the tasteful necklace, everything is perfect, except: \nHER RIGHT ARM IS MISSING \nAnd now we SEE: \nTHE BLACK-AND-WHITES \nHaphazardly pulled-up over the steps and the FIRETRUCKS already unspooling their hoses. Cops, Firemen, EMT's. Everybody's SCREAMING. Hub and Elise race past. \nMAN IN BLACK TIE \nSits, weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions. \nTHE FEW SURVIVORS \nTheir faces cut and bleeding, stumble around, disoriented. As Hub and Elise continue toward a SOUND we have never heard before in this country. A kind of keening. \nA NYPD SERGEANT is the senior OFFICER on the scene. Hub shows his shield to the man who appears a bit shell-shocked. \nNYPD SERGEANT -- fucking bastards waited 'til intermission. Everybody standing around... Oh, Jesus... \nGLASS crunching underfoot, they can only watch as horribly disfigured BODIES are carried out. A NEWS REPORTER shoves a microphone in Hub's face. \nNEWS REPORTER Is it true the governor was attending tonight's benefit --? \nHUB I don't know. \nNEWS REPORTER Who it is I'm speaking to --? \nHub ignores the reporter. He sees that Elise is already tearing off part of her skirt to bandage a SOCIETY MATRON. He takes off his coat and goes to work beside her. \nCUT TO: \nA DARKENED AIRPLANE \nHub sits alone. \nPILOT (O.S.) Folks, as you can probably tell, we have begun our descent into Washington's National airport. \nTHE HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING SOUND IS HEARD AGAIN \nHub reaches up to his DAMAGED EARS. As anyone who's ever flown with a sinus problem knows, the pain is excruciating. \nSTEWARDESS -- You alright? \nBut we can only LIP-READ her question. He's sweating now. Over this, we HEAR: \nARMY GENERAL (V.O.) Either we answer this threat quickly and convincingly or next week there'll be a hundred more all over the world. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nON CAPITOL HILL -- LATER THAT DAY \nAs Hub climbs the steps toward the gleaming dome, the debate continues within: \n", "test3_id": 3035}

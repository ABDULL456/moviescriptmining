We see Bud working, calming them, talking them through it.  He's sweating rivers in his helmet, not looking too steady.  His projection of calm to the others is his own salvation. 
Coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room. 
COFFEY This part I do alone.  Brigman, take you men and continue aft.  Split up into two teams of two. Let's get moving... we head back in fourteen minutes. 
Bud leads his team into a narrow corridor. 
INT. CORRIDOR/ROOMS                                                     72 
They search the rooms along the corridor with their lights until they come to a vertical hatch, open.  a pit of darkness below. 
BUD Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny.  You guys stay on this deck.  Hook you line onto mine.  Any problem, you tug my line.  Two pulls.  Jammer, you're with me. 
Bud drops down through the hatch to the level below, followed by Jammer, who barely fits through.  Catfish hooks his safety line onto Bud's with a carabiner and move along the corridor with the others. 
EXT./INT. CAB ONE                                                       73 
Lindsey circles the hull, documenting, photographing.  Her strobes sear the darkness, give glimpses of the dead leviathan's form as her tiny submersible circles it like a bee. 
INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTER                                              74 
Working from a plastic card, Coffey spins the dial on the wall safe and opens it.  He removes several plastic binders... the code books.  He also grabs handfuls of classified documents and orders, and a set of missile arming keys, all which he places in a pouch at his waist. 
INT. CORRIDOR                                                           75 
Bud leads Jammer through a long, claustrophobically narrow corridor, tapping on the walls and hatches periodically.  After he taps, he waits a few moments.  There are no answering taps.  They open doors and shine their lights into the rooms.  The are bodies, but they seem anonymous.  Crumpled shapes in khaki or blue.  They undog and open a hatch.  Beyond it is the largest chamber of the sub, the... 
INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 76 
The missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and twenty feet long and forty feet high, with two rows of vertical launch tubes, 24 in all.  The chamber is divided into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork. 
JAMMER Where are we? 
BUD Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes. 
They sweep their lights around the chamber.  Jammer turns... his beam illuminating a body just beyond the door.  A coveralled seaman turning slowly in the eddying current.  Small albino crabs crawl slowly over the man's face.  One scuttles out of his gaping mouth. 
JAMMER Lord Almighty. 
BUD Hey, you okay? 
Bud goes to him.  Gets up close to his face.  Sees that he's not.  That he's hyperventilating.  Fighting nausea.  Bud grabs him by the shoulders. 
BUD Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy. 
JAMMER I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know... 
BUD I'm taking you back out. 
JAMMER No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in. 
Bud sees that the big diver's breathing has stabilized.  He looks at his watch.  Checker Jammer's pressure gauges. 
BUD Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay? 
JAMMER Yeah, okay.  Okay. 
He moves off through the center aisle of the gallery swimming between the huge cylinders.  He pays out the lifeline as he goes. 
INT. COM-ROOM                                                           77 
Coffey is working rapidly and efficiently, moving from one rack of electronics gear to the next, setting thermite grenades at vital points.  As the thermite ignites, it generates an intense arc-bright light and tremendous heat.  The circuit chasses melt.  Coffey works calmly in the infernal glare. 
INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 78 
Bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the missile compartment.  He goes down a stairwell to the lower level.  A HUNDRED FEET AWAY, Jammer loses sight of Bud's dive-lights.  He starts to get nervous.  Suddenly his own lights begin to DIM, flickering lower and lower. They become little orange candles, the filament barely glowing.  The darkness closes in. 
JAMMER Bud?  BUD?!  You readin' me?  BUD?!! 
BUD, at the same moment, is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet lights, which are dimming and flickering.  He hears nothing from his helmet transceiver. 
JAMMER, smacks the side of his helmet.  Shakes the transceiver on his belt. Nothing... just static.  Then even the static dies.  Panic time. 
He grabs the safety line and pulls twice.  Hard.  It is snagged on a sharp metal edge ten feet from him.  He pulls twice more, harder, hauling the thing.  The line severs.  Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward him.  His eyes bug.  He looks all around in the darkness.  Can't see Bud. Can't decide what to do.  We can see hysteria revving up inside him like a flywheel. 
Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls.  It is a cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm-white of their dive lights. 
It grows brighter.  He turns slowly toward it. 
The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him. 
JAMMER Bud?  Is that you? 
C.U. JAMMER, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source. 
Guess what, Jammer?  It's not Bud.  In the brightest center of the glow, SOMETHING is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls. Jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright astonishment melting into terror.

{"test1_input": "\"Seven\", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker \nSEVEN \nby \nAndrew Kevin Walker \nJanuary 27,1992 \nThe world is a fine place, and worth fighting for. \n- Ernest Hemingway For Whom the Bell Tolls \nEXT.  COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY \nThe white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky. The church bell rings, resonating. \nMass has let out.  Small church, small congregation.  The dirt road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  An old two-story house sits across the road.  Lone. \nINT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY \nSunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than bright.  SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty second-story room.  He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls. \nSomerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  He runs his finger across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper. He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly. \nHe pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a roughly squared section with the rose at its center. \nHe studies it in his hand. \nEXT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY \nBirds sing.  Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Is something wrong? \nSomerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford Thunderbird.  He holds a check and a booklet of receipts. \nMAN (CONT) Is something the matter? \nSOMERSET No... no.  There's nothing wrong. \nSomerset still seems distant. \nMAN (writes receipt) Not that it's any of my business... but, are you figuring on moving out here eventually? \nSOMERSET Soon. \nMAN I just never seen a man mortgaging an empty house before. \nSOMERSET Everything here still seems... seems so strange to me.  All this. \nMAN I don't know.  I'd say this place is about as normal as places get. \nThe man walks over to hand over a receipt.  Somerset accepts the receipt, folds it.  Somerset smiles. \nSOMERSET That is exactly what I mean.  Strange. \nSomerset looks back at the house.  The man does not understand. \nINT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS) \nSomerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out the speeding train.  He is near the back of the car, away from the few other passengers. \nOutside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  The entire panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun. \nThe light flickers across Somerset's placid face. \nINT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY \nThe train is nearly full.  Somerset has his suitcase on the aisle seat beside him.  He has a hardcover book unopened on his lap.  He still stares out the window, but his disposition has soured.  The train is passing an ugly, swampy field. \nA car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  A little further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their coats matted with blood. \nSomerset turns his head to watch the dogs. \nAway in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight. \nINT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- EARLY EVENING \nPassing urban streets below.  Slums.  Smashed cars.  People stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps. \nSomerset's suitcase is by the window.  Somerset is now in the aisle seat, reading his book. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS) \nCurtains closed.  The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will be everywhere in this story.  A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS.  Somerset's life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a closet and hundreds of books on shelves. \nSomerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed. He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical metronome. \nHe frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and forth.  Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK. Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady. \nSomerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  The metronome's ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  Somerset's face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome. \nHis eyes close tighter. \nTick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  Somerset's breathing deepens.  The car ALARM seems QUIETER. \nTick, tick, tick.  Somerset continues his concentration. \nThe METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND.  Somerset's face relaxes slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  Tick, tick, tick... \nEXT.  CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS -- NIGHT \nDAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.  He is a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always smoldering.  FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated storefronts.  He crosses the street under elevated subway tracks.  A train roars overhead. \nMills watches it as he walks on. \n", "test1_true": "EXT.  URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES -- NIGHT \nThis rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat skyscraper.  Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and pieces of junk in the gutter. \nAhead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to break into the trunk of a parked car. \nMills draws near.  One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will be a problem, continues prying.  Mills stops, calm. \nMILLS Is that your car, man? \nFIRST THUG What the fuck do you care? \nMills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand. \nMILLS Does that car belong to you? \nThe thugs look at each other, gauging.  They face Mills. \nFIRST THUG Yeah, it's my car, alright?  Fuck off. \nMILLS You're telling me that's your car? \nThe second thug starts the long way round the car. \nSECOND THUG Well, for some strange reason, I don't believe you. \nMills gives a \"isn't that silly\" laugh, shifts his gaze -- \nSees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon. \nFIRST THUG (steps forward) You can fucking suck my... \nMills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle against the first thug's head.  The thug falls, swings blindly. \nThe second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife. \nMills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the second thug's face -- CRACK.  Broken nose. \nThe second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose squirting blood. \nMills turns, enraged, breathing hard. \nThe first thug is screaming, trying to stand.  Mills takes one step, punts the first thug's head.  The crowbar clatters away. \nMills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards. \nMills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold. They both struggle spastically.  The thug's winning. \nGurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car. \nMills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair and holds the man's head against the car's side window.  Mills' free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's the charm as the window shatters.  The thug goes out cold. \nMills backs off, still incensed.  He rubs his throat, looking at the two prone men.  Slowly, he regains some composure. \nHe takes a keychain from his pocket.  He unlocks the door of the car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat.  He walks to collect the other thug off the street. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MORNING \nSomerset picks items off a moving box:  keys, wallet, homicide badge.  Finally, he opens the hardcover book from the train. \nFrom the pages, he takes the pale, wallpaper rose. \nINT.  TENEMENT APARTMENT -- DAY \nA wall is stained by a starburst of blood.  Somerset stands, melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a sawed-off shotgun.  The apartment is gloomy.  DETECTIVE TAYLOR, 52, looks through a notepad. \nTAYLOR Neighbors heard them screaming at each other.  It was nothing new or unusual. But, then they heard the gun go off. Boom, boom... both barrels. \nSOMERSET Did his wife confess?  Did she actually speak the words? \nTAYLOR When the patrolman got here she was trying to put his head back together. She was crying too hard to say anything. (shuts notebook) Crime of passion. \nSOMERSET Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here. \nTaylor shifts his weight, impatient, annoyed. \nTAYLOR This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork. \nSomerset looks at a coloring-book open on the coffee table. There are crayons beside it.  Somerset picks the book up. \nHe flips through: crudely colored pictures. \nSOMERSET Did their son see it happen? \nTAYLOR What kind of question is that?  Huh? (pointing) He's dead.  His wife killed him.  There it is.  That's all.  Anything else has nothing to do with nothing. \nSomerset replaces the book, digs up a cigarette from his pocket. \nTAYLOR (CONT) You and your fucking questions, Somerset.  I'm glad I'm getting rid of you today.  You know that, you fuck? \nDavid Mills enters, dressed in a suit.  He looks a bit lost. \nMILLS Uh... Lieutenant Somerset? \nSomerset lights his cigarette, looks to Mills. \nMILLS (CONT) I'm David Mills... your new partner. \nEXT.  TENEMENT/CITY STREET -- DAY \nA body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement doors.  Somerset follows.  Mills follows Somerset.  They walk towards the end of the filthy block. \nMILLS I'm a little thrown.  I just finished orientation at central, and they dumped me off down here. \nSOMERSET I heard you brought in two small-timers last night. \nMILLS Yeah.  Two real idiots. \n", "test1_id": 2961, "test2_input": "SOMERSET Since we are just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar.  Sit and talk for awhile.  That way we can... \nMILLS Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing for a case, if it's all the same to you. Seeing how we only have a week for this whole transition thing. (waits) I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p., know what I mean? \nSomerset walks, no reply.  Mills searches to get a read on him. \nSOMERSET I meant to ask you something... when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... (pause) Why are you here? \nMILLS (wary) I... I don't follow. \nSOMERSET All this effort you've gone through, to be transferred from Philadelphia to here.  It's the first question that pops into my head. \nMills formulates his response. \nMILLS I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or... at least the same reasons you used to have for being here... (cutting) ...before you decided to give up. \nSomerset stops and faces Mills. \nSOMERSET You think you know me?  You just met me two minutes ago. \nMILLS Maybe I don't understand the question. \nSOMERSET It's very simple.  You've come from the \"City of Brotherly Love\" to the \"City of Brotherly Hate,\" detective.  I've never seen it done that way. \nMILLS I don't know.  Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there. (pause) You know, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right out kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, lieutenant, so however you want it to go. \nSOMERSET Let me tell you how I want this to go. I want you to look, and I want you to listen. \nMILLS I wasn't standing around Philly guarding the fucking Liberty Bell. \nSOMERSET But, you've never worked homicide in this city. \nMILLS I realize that. \nSOMERSET Well, please do me the favor of remembering it. \nMills just stares back at Somerset.  Somerset walks.  Mills rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, \"what'd I do to deserve this?\"  He follows Somerset. \nINSERT -- TITLE CARD \nMONDAY \nINT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING \nSomerset lies asleep on the bed.  It is still dark outside. Relatively quiet.  The PHONE beside the inactive metronome RINGS HARSHLY.  Somerset awakens suddenly, rankled. \nINT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING \nIt is barely becoming light outside.  Mills can't sleep. \nAlone in a double bed.  He sits up, frustrated.  Sits on the edge of the bed and looks around.  The room is a shambles, filled with moving boxes. \nThe light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy on one box.  Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen motion at the trophy's pinnacle. \nMills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face. The CLINKING of DISHES and SILVERWARE is HEARD from another room.  Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled. \nINT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- EARLY MORNING \nAcross a living room full of boxes, TRACY MILLS, 30, a beautiful woman, stands in her bathrobe.  She's upset about something, takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter. \nShe pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea from a pot on the stove.  Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door. \nThe tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on the counter behind her the PHONE RINGS.  Startled, she releases the mug too close to the edge.  It falls -- \nCrashes to the floor, shatters. \nINT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING \nA dark hall.  Somerset and Mills stand with OFFICER DAVIS, 28, a beefy, uniformed cop.  Light from a camera's flash spills in from the nearby kitchen.  Davis hands Somerset two flashlights. \nSOMERSET At what time did you confirm the death? \nDAVIS Like I said, we didn't touch anything, but we were on scene at like o-five- hundred, so he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about half an hour. \nMILLS Wait, wait, wait.  You didn't check him? You didn't check vital signs? \nDAVIS Believe me, he's gone.  Unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce now. \nMILLS No.  The point is, when you're first man in, you check vital signs. \nDAVIS This guy's sitting in a pile of his own shit and piss.  If he ain't dead he would have stood up by now. \nMILLS (getting angry) Listen, Godzilla... \nSomerset steps in, heads Mills off. \nSOMERSET Thank you, Officer Davis.  We'll see you again after we've had a look. \nDAVIS Yes, sir. \nDavis leaves, eyeing Mills.  Mills watches him.  Somerset hands Mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves. \nSOMERSET I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into? \nMILLS And, I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a supposedly dead man who didn't really die until Davis was back in the patrol car calling the morgue and eating a powdered donut. \nSomerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit. \nSOMERSET Drop it.  We have more important concerns just now, don't we? \nMILLS Fine... for now. \nINT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nThe POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER packs up, hoists his camera and equipment bag.  Somerset and Mills enter.  Mills puts on his own pair of rubber gloves.  The grubby kitchen is small; barely room for four people to move around in.  The photographer exits: \nPHOTOGRAPHER Bon appetit. \n", "test2_true": "The light bathes an OBESE MAN who is slumped forward in a kitchen chair, face-down-dead in a plate of spaghetti. \nThe sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with soiled paper plates.  The plates hold bits of half-eaten sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk-food remnants. \nMills and Somerset turn on their flashlights.  Mills points his at the green bulb above.  Aluminum foil has been wrapped around the bulb to focus the light on the corpse. \nSomerset sweeps the room with his flashlight.  He goes to the body and kneels beside it.  There's a rope tied around the man's wide gut.  Mills comes to stand beside Somerset. \nMILLS I guess that makes it homicide. \nSomerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead man's pants cuffs.  Rope is tied around the purplish ankle. \nMills examines the knots behind the chair's back.  Shines his flashlight on the man's belly. \nMILLS (CONT) Still, he could have tied himself in. To make it look like murder. \nSomerset isn't listening, focused on the corpse.  He studies the man's head and neck without touching. \nMILLS (CONT) I don't see any blood or bruises yet. No wounds.  You see anything? \nSOMERSET (irritated) Not yet. \nSomerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff hands are clutching utensils.  A knife in the left hand, a fork sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging skewered.  Cockroaches swarm. \nMills turns to the sink and stove.  Each burner of the stove has a used pot or pan on it.  There's food slopped everywhere. \nMILLS I saw a guy once... committed suicide, but he wanted to make sure his family could collect insurance money, right? \nSomerset walks to the room's only window.  The window has been painted over with black paint.  he touches the window with his pinkie finger.  The paint is still wet. \nMills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator.  The trash can is full to the brim with empty food containers. \nMILLS (CONT) So, this guy took this big knife... and he held it behind him, put the tip of it in his back, and he ran backwards into the wall.  Cause, he thought it was going to look like someone stabbed him in the back. \nMills opens the refrigerator.  It's nearly empty. \nMILLS (CONT) Except, he poked a big fucking hole in the dry wall when he did it. \nSOMERSET If you could... spare me the anecdotes for now.  Leave the refrigerator open for the light. \nMILLS (sarcastic) Oh, forgive me.  I thought we had this male-bonding thing going.  My mistake. \nSomerset looks at the floor, deep in thought.  His flashlight beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and bits of food running from the stove to the table. \nSOMERSET What do you smell?  Other than him, and all the food. \nMILLS (sniffs) I don't know... there's something. \nSomerset goes close to the table, then leans to peer under. \nSOMERSET A bucket. \nSomerset points the flashlight and Mills crouches, pulls up the tablecloth on his side of the table.  Two large dead rats lay on the floor beside a metal bucket. \nMills grimaces, slides under the table, careful to avoid the rats.  He looks in the bucket.  He leans back, baffled. \nMILLS It's vomit. \nHe looks at Somerset under the table. \nMILLS (CONT) It's a bucket of vomit. \nSOMERSET Is there any blood in it? \nMILLS Can't tell by looking. \nSomerset stands, perplexed, stares at the dead man.  There is a knock at the door.  The detectives look to DOCTOR THOMAS O'NEILL, 52, the medical examiner.  O'Neill is a frumpy man, seems a bit gone, looking at the green bulb. \nO'NEILL Mood lighting.  Very sixties. \nHe drops his bag on the floor, sorts through the contents. \nMILLS (to Somerset) You think he was poisoned? \nMills goes to the trash can, pokes the garbage with a pencil. \nMILLS (CONT) And, those rats there somehow ate the poison off the floor? \nSOMERSET Guessing this early is useless. \nO'NEILL You girls have got the forensics guys out there chompin' at the bit.  Don't know if we'll all fit in here though. \nMills continues searching the garbage. \nMILLS There's room.  Light's the problem. \nSOMERSET Well, three is certainly a crowd in here.  And, with four, someone's bound to be stepping on evidence. (pause) Detective Mills, go help the officers question the neighbors. \nMILLS (not pleased) Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll stay on this. \nSomerset watches O'Neill at the corpse.  O'Neill points a thin flashlight with his mouth, his hands free for the examination. \nSOMERSET (not looking up) Send one forensic in on your way out. \nMills is pissed.  He lifts his flashlight to shine it on the side of Somerset's face. \nA moment passes.  Somerset looks at Mills, light shining directly in Somerset's eyes.  A longer moment.  Mills switches the light off.  He leaves. \nO'Neill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead man's head, lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti. \nO'NEILL He is dead. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BASEMENT GYM -- DAY \nTHWACK, THWACK... THWACK.  Mills punches the heavy bag with hard, quick punches.  Sweat drips off his face.  He's in work- out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves. \nThe walls are covered in mirrors.  Other cops watch Mills as they pass, checking out the new kid.  Mills keeps punching, skillfully. \n", "test2_id": 2962, "test3_input": "EXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT \nJohn Doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes. Factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for miles.  We can HEAR TUGBOAT HORNS sounding low and deep.  We're near the water. \nDoe seems to know where he's going.  He passes stacks of industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky. \nHe walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment.  It's like a stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs. \nAt the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow alleyway formed by two warehouses.  Doe enters, looking up at the single lit bulb on the wall above. \nHe looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap, walks under the bulb.  He throws the hubcap with all his might. It soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind. \nDoe takes aim with the rock.  He throws, grunting. \nThe rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley. \nDoe walks back to the mouth of the alley.  He stops and turns to start from there.  He walks, deliberately, looking down at his feet.    FOLLOW as he walks. \nHe stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the ground in front of him again.  He takes off his thick glasses. \nHe holds the glasses in his hand. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nSomerset is in bed.  The metronome is sounding: tick, tick, tick... The SOUNDS of the CITY are LOUD. \nSomerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome.  Tick, tick, tick... A MAN and a WOMAN are HEARD SCREAMING at each other incoherently from outside.  Somerset rolls over, restless. Tick, tick, tick... \nA THIRD VOICE is HEARD from outside.  This man is screaming at the other two people to shut up.  Somerset opens his eyes, sits up.  He reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against the wall. \nINSERT -- TITLE CARD \nSUNDAY \nINT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING \nSomerset sits away from the bed.  He's smoking a cigarette.  The PHONE RINGS.  Somerset gets up, not in the best of moods. \nSOMERSET (into phone) Hello. \nTRACY (V.O.) (from phone, upset) Hello, Somerset.  It's Tracy. \nSOMERSET Is everything alright? \nTRACY (V.O.) Yes.  Everything's fine.  Could... could you meet me somewhere.  To talk. \nSOMERSET (pause) I don't think that's a good idea. \nTRACY (V.O.) I need to talk to someone, Somerset. You're the only friend I have here.  I don't know anyone else. \nINT.  COFFEE CAFE -- MORNING \nSomerset and Tracy are seated in a booth by the window.  The city's morning rush passes by outside.  The cafe is noisy. Tracy is very upset.  Somerset is very uneasy. \nSOMERSET David doesn't know about this?  You haven't told him? \nTracy shakes her head.  Somerset sighs.  Long silence. \nSOMERSET (CONT) I have to tell you, Tracy, I'm not the one to talk to about this. \nTRACY I just can't think straight.  I don't know why I called you, except I can't stand to hold it as a secret anymore.  I had to get it out... and I can't tell David yet.  Not yet. \nSomerset takes out his cigarettes, but thinks better of it and puts them away.  He watches Tracy stir her coffee. \nSOMERSET I... I had a relationship once, very much like a marriage.  And, there was a baby.  A long time ago.  Things were good.  And I got up one morning, and I went on a case... a murder, like any other.  Except it was my first since hearing about the baby.  And, I felt this fear and anxiety coming over me.  I looked around and I thought, how can I raise a child here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have children,  And, over the next few weeks... I convinced her... \nTears come to Somerset's eyes. \nSOMERSET (CONT) I mean, I wore her down... slowly. \nTRACY I want to have children.  But... \nSOMERSET I can tell you, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive it was the right thing to do.  But, there's never a day that goes by that I don't wish I had decided differently. \nTracy reaches to hold Somerset's hand, but he withdraws it, wipes his tears away. \nSOMERSET (CONT) If you... if you decide not to have the baby... if that's what you decide, then never tell Mills you were pregnant. I mean that.  Never tell. (pause) Your marriage would just wither, and die altogether. \nTracy looks around the cafe, tears in her eyes. \nSOMERSET (CONT) But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him.  Tell him that exact second.  And, spoil that kid every chance you get. \nTRACY Somerset... \nSomerset stands.  He forces a smile. \nSOMERSET That's all the wisdom I can share with you, Tracy.  I barely know you. \nTRACY Will I see you again, before you leave? \nSOMERSET Probably not.  But, it's probably better that way. \nSomerset steps away, leaves.  Tracy watches him go. \nEXT.  CITY STREET -- DAY \nMills and Somerset walk towards the precinct house.  They wade through cars to cross the street. \nSOMERSET I've decided... I want to stay on, till this is over.  Till either it's done, or we can see it will never end. \nMills remains impassive. \nMILLS Oh, you want to stay now? \nSOMERSET One of two things is going to happen. We're either going to get John Doe... or, he will finish his series of seven, and he'll never be found. \nMILLS You think if you stay you're doing me some big favor? \n", "test3_true": "MILLS You knew I'd say yes. \nSOMERSET No.  I wasn't sure at all. \nThey enter the precinct house.  Down the sidewalk, from a distance, comes John Doe.  His brown workboots and clothing are splattered with blood. \nHe walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like he's merely out for a walk on a Sunday afternoon.  People on the sidewalk stop upon seeing him, avoiding him. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, RECEIVING LOBBY/BOOKING -- DAY \nMills and Somerset walk past booking cubicles and benches of handcuffed low-lifes.  The place is swimming with activity. \nThe two detectives head to a duty desk at the end of the room. \nSOMERSET As soon as this is over, I'll be gone. \nMILLS What a great big surprise that is. \nThey pass through a gate and Somerset goes to the staircase leading to the second floor.  Mills stops at the duty desk. Other cops are fighting for the DUTY SERGEANT'S attention. \nMILLS (CONT) Mills and Somerset are on the premises. \nSERGEANT Wonder-fucking-ful. \nMills stops, looks.  Somerset stops, looks back down the stairs. \nJohn Doe stands inside the precinct house doors.  He holds out his arms as if to say \"presto, here I am.\" \nNear silence comes to the room as all eyes go to the figure of John Doe. \nMills is riveted, finding this impossible to comprehend. \nOne UNIFORMED COP takes out his gun, points it at John Doe. \nUNIFORMED COP It's him! \nSeveral other cops drop what they're doing and draw weapons. Mills, still off-balance, walks back through the gate, takes his gun out and points it at Doe. \nMILLS Get down on the floor. \nSomerset comes back down the stairs. \nSOMERSET Be careful! \nCops move slowly in on Doe from all sides. \nANOTHER COP You heard him!  Get on the floor! \nJohn Doe gets on his knees, hands up.  Mills moves close, but not too.  ONE COP comes from behind, nudges Doe with his foot. \nONE COP Spread your legs and get your hands out in front of you. \nMILLS Get down!  Face down! \nJohn Doe gets on his stomach, obeys.  Mills comes right up to Doe, steps on his neck, puts his gun against Doe's head. \nMILLS (CONT) Don't move.  Don't move a fucking inch. \nCops frisk and handcuff Doe.  Somerset comes beside Mills. \nSOMERSET I don't believe it. \nJOHN DOE Hello, Lieutenant Somerset. \nCOP What the hell is this? \nThe cop putting the handcuffs on Doe holds up Doe's hands.  Doe winces.  Every single one of Doe's fingers has a bandage wrapped around it.  John Doe looks up, his face pressed against the floor, glasses askew, Mills' gun at his temple. \nJOHN DOE I want to speak with my lawyer. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY \nMills, Somerset and the captain stand in darkness. \nOn the other side of a two-way mirror, John Doe is seated in a restraining chair in an interrogation room.  His hands and legs are bound with leather straps to the chair's arm and legs.  A strap hold tight around Doe's throat.  This is not some superman/serial killer.  He looks more like an eccentric college professor.  His lawyer MARK SWARR, 43, sits at a table, taking notes. \nMills holds a fingerprint card.  The black ink prints are just useless blobs with traces of blood in them. \nCAPTAIN He cuts off the skin of his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in his apartment.  For a long time, he's been cutting before the papillary lines can grow back. \nMILLS What about the trace on his bank account?  The guns? \nCAPTAIN The orphanage is all we have.

{"train": "\"Seven\", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker \nSEVEN \nby \nAndrew Kevin Walker \nJanuary 27,1992 \nThe world is a fine place, and worth fighting for. \n- Ernest Hemingway For Whom the Bell Tolls \nEXT.  COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY \nThe white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky. The church bell rings, resonating. \nMass has let out.  Small church, small congregation.  The dirt road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  An old two-story house sits across the road.  Lone. \nINT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY \nSunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than bright.  SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty second-story room.  He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls. \nSomerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  He runs his finger across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper. He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly. \nHe pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a roughly squared section with the rose at its center. \nHe studies it in his hand. \nEXT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY \nBirds sing.  Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Is something wrong? \nSomerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford Thunderbird.  He holds a check and a booklet of receipts. \nMAN (CONT) Is something the matter? \nSOMERSET No... no.  There's nothing wrong. \nSomerset still seems distant. \nMAN (writes receipt) Not that it's any of my business... but, are you figuring on moving out here eventually? \nSOMERSET Soon. \nMAN I just never seen a man mortgaging an empty house before. \nSOMERSET Everything here still seems... seems so strange to me.  All this. \nMAN I don't know.  I'd say this place is about as normal as places get. \nThe man walks over to hand over a receipt.  Somerset accepts the receipt, folds it.  Somerset smiles. \nSOMERSET That is exactly what I mean.  Strange. \nSomerset looks back at the house.  The man does not understand. \nINT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS) \nSomerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out the speeding train.  He is near the back of the car, away from the few other passengers. \nOutside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  The entire panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun. \nThe light flickers across Somerset's placid face. \nINT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY \nThe train is nearly full.  Somerset has his suitcase on the aisle seat beside him.  He has a hardcover book unopened on his lap.  He still stares out the window, but his disposition has soured.  The train is passing an ugly, swampy field. \nA car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  A little further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their coats matted with blood. \nSomerset turns his head to watch the dogs. \nAway in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight. \nINT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- EARLY EVENING \nPassing urban streets below.  Slums.  Smashed cars.  People stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps. \nSomerset's suitcase is by the window.  Somerset is now in the aisle seat, reading his book. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS) \nCurtains closed.  The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will be everywhere in this story.  A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS.  Somerset's life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a closet and hundreds of books on shelves. \nSomerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed. He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical metronome. \nHe frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and forth.  Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK. Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady. \nSomerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  The metronome's ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  Somerset's face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome. \nHis eyes close tighter. \nTick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  Somerset's breathing deepens.  The car ALARM seems QUIETER. \nTick, tick, tick.  Somerset continues his concentration. \nThe METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND.  Somerset's face relaxes slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  Tick, tick, tick... \nEXT.  CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS -- NIGHT \nDAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.  He is a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always smoldering.  FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated storefronts.  He crosses the street under elevated subway tracks.  A train roars overhead. \nMills watches it as he walks on. \nSOMERSET Since we are just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar.  Sit and talk for awhile.  That way we can... \nMILLS Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing for a case, if it's all the same to you. Seeing how we only have a week for this whole transition thing. (waits) I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p., know what I mean? \nSomerset walks, no reply.  Mills searches to get a read on him. \nSOMERSET I meant to ask you something... when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... (pause) Why are you here? \nMILLS (wary) I... I don't follow. \nSOMERSET All this effort you've gone through, to be transferred from Philadelphia to here.  It's the first question that pops into my head. \nMills formulates his response. \nMILLS I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or... at least the same reasons you used to have for being here... (cutting) ...before you decided to give up. \nSomerset stops and faces Mills. \nSOMERSET You think you know me?  You just met me two minutes ago. \nMILLS Maybe I don't understand the question. \nSOMERSET It's very simple.  You've come from the \"City of Brotherly Love\" to the \"City of Brotherly Hate,\" detective.  I've never seen it done that way. \nMILLS I don't know.  Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there. (pause) You know, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right out kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, lieutenant, so however you want it to go. \nSOMERSET Let me tell you how I want this to go. I want you to look, and I want you to listen. \nMILLS I wasn't standing around Philly guarding the fucking Liberty Bell. \nSOMERSET But, you've never worked homicide in this city. \nMILLS I realize that. \nSOMERSET Well, please do me the favor of remembering it. \nMills just stares back at Somerset.  Somerset walks.  Mills rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, \"what'd I do to deserve this?\"  He follows Somerset. \nINSERT -- TITLE CARD \nMONDAY \nINT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING \nSomerset lies asleep on the bed.  It is still dark outside. Relatively quiet.  The PHONE beside the inactive metronome RINGS HARSHLY.  Somerset awakens suddenly, rankled. \nINT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING \nIt is barely becoming light outside.  Mills can't sleep. \nAlone in a double bed.  He sits up, frustrated.  Sits on the edge of the bed and looks around.  The room is a shambles, filled with moving boxes. \nThe light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy on one box.  Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen motion at the trophy's pinnacle. \nMills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face. The CLINKING of DISHES and SILVERWARE is HEARD from another room.  Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled. \nINT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- EARLY MORNING \nAcross a living room full of boxes, TRACY MILLS, 30, a beautiful woman, stands in her bathrobe.  She's upset about something, takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter. \nShe pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea from a pot on the stove.  Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door. \nThe tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on the counter behind her the PHONE RINGS.  Startled, she releases the mug too close to the edge.  It falls -- \nCrashes to the floor, shatters. \nINT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING \nA dark hall.  Somerset and Mills stand with OFFICER DAVIS, 28, a beefy, uniformed cop.  Light from a camera's flash spills in from the nearby kitchen.  Davis hands Somerset two flashlights. \nSOMERSET At what time did you confirm the death? \nDAVIS Like I said, we didn't touch anything, but we were on scene at like o-five- hundred, so he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about half an hour. \nMILLS Wait, wait, wait.  You didn't check him? You didn't check vital signs? \nDAVIS Believe me, he's gone.  Unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce now. \nMILLS No.  The point is, when you're first man in, you check vital signs. \nDAVIS This guy's sitting in a pile of his own shit and piss.  If he ain't dead he would have stood up by now. \nMILLS (getting angry) Listen, Godzilla... \nSomerset steps in, heads Mills off. \nSOMERSET Thank you, Officer Davis.  We'll see you again after we've had a look. \nDAVIS Yes, sir. \nDavis leaves, eyeing Mills.  Mills watches him.  Somerset hands Mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves. \nSOMERSET I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into? \nMILLS And, I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a supposedly dead man who didn't really die until Davis was back in the patrol car calling the morgue and eating a powdered donut. \nSomerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit. \nSOMERSET Drop it.  We have more important concerns just now, don't we? \nMILLS Fine... for now. \nINT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nThe POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER packs up, hoists his camera and equipment bag.  Somerset and Mills enter.  Mills puts on his own pair of rubber gloves.  The grubby kitchen is small; barely room for four people to move around in.  The photographer exits: \nPHOTOGRAPHER Bon appetit. \nHe stops when he sees Somerset reflected in one of the mirrors. Somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on top.  He sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette. \nSOMERSET Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills. \nMILLS We need to chat. \nINT.  BASEMENT GYM, BOXING RING -- DAY \nMills opens a door and enters with Somerset behind.  They are alone.  Chairs face an old, limp-roped boxing ring.  Practice pads hang from pegs on a wall.  Mills clasps a pair in his gloves, offers them to Somerset. \nSOMERSET No. \nMILLS You just hold them up.  I do all the work. \nSomerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on.  He still has the un-lit cigarette hanging from his mouth.  Mills climbs into the ring.  He holds the ropes open for Somerset, waits. \nSomerset doesn't want to do this, but he climbs up. \nMILLS (CONT) You've seen my files... seen the things I've done? \nSOMERSET Yes.  Impressive work. \nMills motions to Somerset and Somerset holds up the practice pads.  Mills starts working them, lightly, warming up. THWACK... THWACK... \nMILLS So, what's your problem?  I've done my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat. \nSOMERSET I know it.  That doesn't mean... \nMILLS I did all that shit a long time ago. \nTHWACK... THWACK... Somerset's very stiff, uncomfortable. \nSOMERSET I made a decision, because I have to worry about the integrity of the scene. \nMILLS That's bullshit. \nSOMERSET When I'm on scene, I'm not going to worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.  I'm there to do the work. \nMills punches a little more aggressively.  Somerset's backing, flinching, keeping the pads high.  THWACK... THWACK... THWACK... \nMILLS The badge in my pocket says \"detective,\" just like yours.  I've been Homicide for four and a half years. \nSOMERSET You've worked Homicide for four years, or for five years... Don't count the half-years, unless you want to sound like a rookie. \nMills unloads a mighty wallop and one practice pad recoils into Somerset's face, knocks Somerset on his ass. \nMILLS Oops.  My hand slipped. \nMills walks, climbs out of the ring. \nMILLS (CONT) You fucked me over today, and you know it.  You know it. \nSomerset looks at the broken cigarette in his mouth.  He contains his anger.  He seems to realize Mills has a point. \nMILLS (CONT) Just don't jerk me off.  That's all I ask.  It's not much.  Don't jerk me off. (pause) Please, do me the favor of remembering that. \nMills exits.  Somerset spits out the broken cigarette. \nINT.  URBAN SCHOOL, OFFICE -- DAY \nTracy looks out a window from behind steel bars. \nBelow her, young children play in a playground.  They're playing hop-scotch, throwing balls, chasing each other.  The swing sets are broken.  The handball wall is graffitied. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) I'm sorry, Mrs. Mills.  We don't have anything right now. \nTracy looks away from the window to the haggard WOMAN.  The school's office is ill-equipped, busy, disorganized. \nWOMAN (CONT) We'll try to give you a call if we need substitutes next month. \nTRACY Thank you. \nTracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a chain-link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the ramp of a freezer truck.  he carries a big, whole, slaughtered pig on his shoulder. \nThe pig's head flops as the butcher walks.  Some children stop their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass. \nINT.  UNDERGROUND SUBWAY TRAIN -- DAY \nThe train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, WHEELS SCREECHING.  The lights go on and off.  Passengers read tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the walls; anything to avoid making eye-contact with others. \nAll races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings. Tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail. \nA bag-lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through the crowd.  A man presses against Tracy in an attempt to let the bag-lady pass.  Tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways to make room.  She looks down. \nOn one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno magazine, THREE-WAY FUCK, in one hand.  His other hand is in his pocket.  He's obviously masturbating himself in his pants.  No one else notices or seems to care. \nTracy looks away, disgusted.  She closes her eyes.  The train's wheels SCREECH LOUDER as the train takes a curve. \nINT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT \nThe front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy sidewalk and street.  A transparent plastic canopy frames the entrance.  A STRANGE MAN, 20, stands at the edge of the canopy. He wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song, oblivious. \nTracy and Mills look together over the piles of fruits and vegetables piled on wooden stands which form tight aisles. \nMILLS It was okay.  I mean... it was certainly better than yesterday.  I think Somerset and I came to a small understanding... \nMills holds his thumb and forefinger about a quarter of an inch apart to illustrate. \nMILLS (CONT) ...about this big. \nTRACY He sounds interesting. \nMILLS He is that, if nothing else. \nMills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from Tracy's arm.  He goes to check out the carrots.  Tracy looks up from heads of lettuce to the strange man at the entrance. \nThe strange man hums on, rocking back and forth slowly, his eyes glassy.  Customers come and go, paying him no mind. \nMills stands.  Somerset will not look him in the eye.  Mills leaves, slams the door.  Somerset seems deflated. \nCAPTAIN (CONT) You win, Somerset.  You're out. \nINSERT -- TITLE CARD \nWEDNESDAY \nEXT.  CITY STREET -- MORNING \nA vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at his busy newsstand.  The headline: SECOND BIZARRE MURDER!, in huge print. \nThe vendor lays out another tabloid pile.  Headline: \"GIVE ME MY POUND OF FLESH,\" SAYS BLOODTHRISTY KILLER, in big, red letters. The vendor places a third pile beside the others:  SICKENING MURDERS - EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE!!! \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- MORNING \nOld office.  Moving boxes on the floor.  The single window faces a billboard.  Somerset works on a manual typewriter.  He types hunt-and-peck, slowly.  His paperwork is on the desk in two sloppy piles.  A jarring SOUND is HEARD OFFSCREEN, like fingers on a blackboard.  Somerset looks up, irritated. \nA WORKMAN is working at the open door, holding the source of the sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words DETECTIVE SOMERSET off the door's window. \nWORKMAN Sorry. \nSomerset turns back to typing.  The captain steps in, looks at the workman, then drops more papers on Somerset's desk. \nAs always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw.  He looks around.  Two of boxes on the floor have DETECTIVE MILLS written across them.  The captain picks one up, puts it on top of the other.  He sits, watching Somerset, starts straightening the forms on the desk. \nCAPTAIN What are you going to do with yourself out there, Somerset? \nSOMERSET I'll get a job.  Maybe on a farm.  I'll fix up my house. \nCAPTAIN Can't you feel it yet? (pause) Can't you feel that feeling... that you won't be special anymore? \nSOMERSET (lying) I don't know what you mean. \nCAPTAIN You know. \nSomerset reclines, looks at the captain. \nSOMERSET Did you read in the paper today, about the man who took his dog for a walk? And how he was mugged?  And, his wallet was taken, and his watch.  Then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened last night.  Not far from here. \nCAPTAIN I heard. \nSOMERSET I have no understanding of this place. \nCAPTAIN It's always been like this. \nSomerset saddles up to the typewriter.  Hunt-and-peck. \nSOMERSET Yes.  You're absolutely right. \nThe captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks. \nCAPTAIN You were made for this work, Somerset. I can't believe you're going to trade it all in for a tool belt and a fishing rod.  But, I guess I'm wrong. \nThe captain leaves.  Somerset looks up now that the captain's gone.  He grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their disheveled state.  He looks at the workman. \nThe workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to remove the last remnants of Somerset's name. \nSOMERSET (angrily) Put a little elbow grease into it! \nThe workman is startled, continues his work. \nINT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY \nThe grandly furnished apartment where the second murder took place has been dusted for prints and searched. \nTwo female forensics are at work. \nINT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY \nMills is seated in front of a long writing desk with many drawers.  All the drawers are open.  Mills looks through letters and stationary.  Nothing of use.  He tosses the pile back. \nHe sits back, frustrated, yanks off one rubber glove, looks around the room.  Books have been taken off their shelves, the bed has been stripped.  The room has been given the once over. \nThe victim's family photographs hang in expensive frames on one wall.  There are at least thirty photos of various sizes: ancestors, sons and daughters, grandchildren and friends.  An over-weight forensic, CHRIS, 35, leans in through the doorway. \nMills looks up and Chris shakes his head glumly. \nMILLS He must have left us another puzzle to solve... somewhere. \nCHRIS We'll keep looking, but we're running out of possibilities. \nChris leaves and Mills stands to stretch.  Something catches Mills' eye.  He walks over to the door, curious.  At the base of the open door, there's a ball of paper wedged under to act as a doorjamb.  Mills puts his glove back on, pulls the ball out. \nHe uncrumples the paper as the door slowly swings shut.  The page has a drawing on it, of the sun with waves of heat at its edges.  There is a single eye in the center of the sun. \nAn arrow is drawn in dried blood on the back of the closing door.  Mills notices this and pushes the door closed. \nThe blood arrow points to the side and up, seems to be pointing to the photo gallery wall.  Mills goes to examine the photos. \nHis eyes search each photo... one by one... till he sees it: \nMILLS Christ... \nA framed photo of a falsely pretty, middle-aged woman smiling and wearing pearls.  Under the glass, on the photo itself, circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes. \nEXT.  CITY STREETS, DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT \nAn assault on the senses.  Crowded streets and sidewalks.  On every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks, junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls.  A few tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them. Buildings border narrowly. \nSomerset walks against the stream.  He carries a file. \nCAR HORNS HOWL.  MUSIC BLASTS from the entrances of clubs. REGGAE from one club is soon OVERTAKEN by RAP from a second story window.  TECHNO-POP blasts from the tattoo parlor. \nSomerset does not like this place, views it with disdain.  He walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground.  The men are pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically. \nSomerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he crosses through the traffic jam in the street.  A VAGRANT steps up with his hand out. \nWILLIAM Yeah?  What happened to the idealistic super-cop I used to know? \nSOMERSET He became a realist. \nWilliam grunts, flicks his cigarette away, takes out a bag of pills.  He palms a few, notices the judgment in Somerset's eyes. \nWILLIAM Oh... sorry. \nWilliam turns his back to Somerset, pops the pills.  Out of sight, out of mind.  Somerset is disappointed, disgusted. \nSOMERSET (sarcastic) Not that I don't appreciate your recent artistic endeavors... but, what happened to the painter I used to know? \nWilliam smiles like a dolt, laughs a little. \nWILLIAM I can't remember. \nINT.  WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT \nColor photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing table.  The top photos are like establishing shots, each taking in the entire display the murderer created. \nWilliam examines with Somerset looking over his shoulder. \nWILLIAM Man... can I buy these from you? \nSOMERSET They're not for sale. \nSomerset lays out photos of the notes, triangle and circle: \nSOMERSET (CONT) What is it?  What's the murderer trying to say? \nWilliam narrows his eyes.  Does not know. \nSOMERSET (CONT) What picture is he painting? \nWILLIAM (figuring) Wait a minute... \nWilliam has an idea.  He ambles over to a row of cabinets where oversized art books are stacked.  He hunts through a pile, shoves some books aside. \nWILLIAM (CONT) I... I've seen things like that... \nSOMERSET Where? \nWilliam keeps digging, finds one book, finds another.  He opens one as he walks back to the drawing table. \nWILLIAM It's church stuff.  Christianity. \nWilliam lays a book down, finds a page.  He opens it to Somerset.  There is a circle to the side of the text.  It says GLUTTONY under the circle. \nSomerset creases his brow, turns the page.  William opens another book. \nWILLIAM (CONT) When it first started... Christian artwork was all from Bible stories.  It was like... nobody had any imagination. It was all... standardized. \nWilliam pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre, worlds of Hieronymus Bosch.  Horrifying religious visions. \nWILLIAM (O.S.,CONT) But, later, everyone started painting to tell their own stories... to teach lessons.  Guys like Bosch, Bregel the elder... Van Eycks. \nWilliam shoves the open book to Somerset.  Somerset looks: \nSeven paintings in a circular pattern showing characters giving in to sins.  Wicked, grotesque people. \nSomerset turns the book to examine each painting right side up. \nSOMERSET (O.S.) The seven deadly sins. \nWILLIAM (O.S.) That's what these murders remind me of. Paintings like these. (points) Gluttony... greed... \nSOMERSET (O.S.) Envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth. Seven deadly sins. \nWILLIAM Amen, brother. \nWilliam goes to continue pulling other books. \nWILLIAM (CONT) I can find more examples.  There's lots of paintings like those... painted over hundreds of years. (moves books) And you're right... that murderer is an artist. \nSomerset is chilled by all this, immersed in the Bosch book. \nSOMERSET And, it's two down... five to go. \nEXT.  CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT \nA bright, tawdry intersection.  Neon swirls and circuit-bulbs on porno theatres provide the flash.  Cars, taxies, and barkers urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise. \nThe streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards: FUN WITH NUDES, BIG BOOBS, NAKED DESIRE, etc.  The usual contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd, looking for someone to hurt. \nMOVE through the crowds.  Meet JOHN, a balding, middle-aged man, wearing thick glasses.  There is not a single thing strange or unusual about his appearance.  FOLLOW him as he walks.  He's nervous, looking at the porno palaces. \nHis sweaty hand clutches a Bible tight against his chest.  He doesn't feel comfortable being here. \nJohn walks to a corner, waits for the light so he may cross.  A grotesque STREET PREACHER approaches waving his own Bible. People walk away from him, so he confronts John. \nPREACHER ...are you, Sir?  Is Jesus Christ your Lord and Master?  Do you believe in Him? \nJohn tries to ignore, traffic blocking his escape. \nPREACHER (CONT) (pleading) Don't ignore me.  Listen to what I have to say.  Christ can be your savior! \nJOHN (quiet anger) Leave me alone. \nPREACHER Think about God, sir.  I can help you let Him into your life. \nFinally the light changes.  John turns and spits in the preacher's face.  The preacher recoils as John crosses quickly. \nJohn hurries between cars in the crosswalk.  The preacher curses from the corner, his voice drowned out in traffic. \nEXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT \nPeople pass on the sidewalk.  John is amongst them, but he stops, looking up at something offscreen. \nSOMERSET My future. \nTracy tilts her head, looking at Somerset. \nTRACY You have a strange way about you, Somerset... I mean in a good way... unusual. \nSomerset doesn't know what to say.  He pockets the paper rose. \nTRACY (CONT) I apologize.  I'll get out of your hair. \nTracy stands, takes the chair back to the kitchenette. \nTRACY (CONT) It's just... it's nice to hear a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're acting like a homosexual.  That's how he is. \nSOMERSET (mock indignation) Well!  I guess I won't be showing this to him then. \nTRACY I suppose not. \nSomerset continues writing.  Tracy sits at the kitchenette table, watches him. \nINSERT -- TITLE CARD \nTHURSDAY \nEXT.  CITY MORGUE -- MORNING \nIt's raining hard.  Mills exits the morgue building with a few art books and a paper cup of coffee.  He holds one art book over his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street. \nINT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING \nMills gets in, puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art books in a box.  He closes the door.  Alone with the sound of the rain.  He wipes water off his face, looks at his tired eyes in the rearview mirror. \nHe reaches in the box of books, takes out copies of The Canterbury Tales and Dante's Purgatory.  He makes a face, opens Dante's Purgatory: \n|                                     THE EARTHLY PARADISE    | |                               VII The Lustful         /____\\| |                                VI The Gluttonous    /_______| |       7 TERRACES OF                                /        | |                                 V The Avaricious  /         | |                                   and Prodigal   /__________| |         PURGATION                               /           | |                             IV The Slothful  /______________| |                     III The Wrathful     /__________________| |                      II The Envious    /____________________| |                       I The Proud    /______________________| |                                   /       THE ISLAND        | |                                 /        OF PURGATORY       | \nMills turns to a bookmark, rests the book on the steering wheel. He reads.  He bites his lip, leaning close to the words.  He concentrates, mouths some of the words to himself.  He finally closes the book, shaking his head, not understanding anything he's reading.  He starts pounding the book against the steering wheel with all his might. \nMILLS Fucking Dante.  Goddamn, poetry writing freak, mother-fuck... \nA figure outside the window knocks on the glass.  Mills rolls it down.  A COP in raincoat hands a wet paper bag through. \nMILLS (CONT) Good work, Officer.  Good work. \nThe cop leaves as Mills quickly rolls the window up and rips the bag open.  Inside: Cliff Notes for Dante's Purgatory and The Canterbury Tales. \nMILLS (CONT) Thank God. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY \nIt still rains outside.  Somerset enters, stops to notice DETECTIVE MILLS painted on the door where his name used to be. He walks, sees all his belongings have been moved from his desk and piled on a small temporary desk in the corner. \nSomerset sits at the temporary desk, starts organizing the files and papers.  Mills enters carrying the box of books. \nSOMERSET How's it coming? \nMILLS Great. \nMills puts the box on the large desk.  They both settle in, attending to their work.  Two men, about five feet apart, each trying not to acknowledge the other's presence. \nMills takes out his Cliff Notes, looks to see Somerset is occupied, hides them in a desk drawer. \nSomerset finishes one form, flips it and looks up.  There's a chalk board nailed to the wall. \nOn the chalkboard:     1 gluttony(x)    5 wrath 2 greed(x)       6 pride 3 sloth          7 lust 4 envy \nThe PHONE RINGS.  Both men look at it.  Phone RINGS again. \nSOMERSET It's your name on the door. \nMills picks up.  Somerset returns to his work. \nMILLS (into phone) Detective Mills here. (lowers voice) Honey, I asked you not to call unless... (listens) What... why?  Okay... okay.  Hold on. \nMills is confused.  He holds the phone out to Somerset. \nMILLS (CONT) It's my wife. \nSomerset looks quizzical.  Mills shrugs.  Somerset takes it. \nSOMERSET (into phone) Hello? (listens) Yes, well... I appreciate the thought, but... I... (listens) Well, I guess I'd be delighted to. Thank you... goodbye. \nSomerset gets up, hangs up, puzzled.  Mills is waiting. \nMILLS Well? \nSOMERSET I'm invited to have a late supper with you and your wife.  And I accept. \nMILLS How's that? \nSOMERSET (sits back down) Tonight. \nMills looks at the phone, lost. \nINT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT \nA record player on a moving box PLAYS QUIET MUSIC. \nThere's a basketball game with NO VOLUME on the t.v. screen. Tracy, Mills and Somerset eat at the kitchen table.  Mills has a beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently. \nTRACY Why aren't you married, Somerset? \nMILLS Tracy.  What the hell? \nSomerset adjusts his napkin on his lap, thinking. \nSOMERSET I was close.  It just didn't happen. \nSomerset holds the books up to Mills, points to a picture of the sun and eye, same as the drawing Mills found. \nSOMERSET (CONT) \"The Sun in Splendor with the Eye.\"  It refers to God the father, and to Saint Thomas Aquinas. \nMILLS Which saint is he? \nSOMERSET Aquinas wrote a summary of theology, Summa Theologica.  And he wrote about the seven deadly sins. \nMills takes the book and looks it over. \nSOMERSET (CONT) Now, what else have you got? \nMILLS Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but... it's my case. \nSOMERSET So... satisfying my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town on Sunday. \nMills is pondering, very tired.  He unlatches his briefcase, takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and hands it to Somerset. \nMILLS The eyes were circled.  With Mr. Gold's blood. \nSOMERSET This is his wife? \nMILLS (nods) She was away on business.  She got back the day he was killed.  If this means she saw anything, I don't know what. We've questioned her about ten times. \nSOMERSET And, if it's a threat? \nMILLS We put her in a safe house. \nSOMERSET This is the one thing. \nMILLS I know. \nEXT.  SLUM TENEMENTS -- NIGHT \nTwo twenty-story tenement buildings stand practically underneath the span of a bridge.  The streets are littered with garbage. Teenagers stand in cliques in front of a liquor store.  Cars pass slowly, CAR STEREOS PUMPING out HIP HOP. \nUnder the bridge, in shadow, a car is parked between two dumpsters.  The trunk is open. \nAT THE BACK OF THE CAR \nThe trunk is full of cardboard boxes which are in turn full of tall, orange candles.  Hundreds of candles.  JOHN leans in under the trunk's bulb, opens a leather pouch and checks the contents: \nA plastic bottle of prescription pills.  A bottle of aspirin.  A hypodermic needle filled with liquid.  Lastly, many jars of baby food: STRAINED CARROTS, STRAINED SPINACH, CREAMED CORN, etc. \nINT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT \nJohn climbs the stairs holding the leather case and a closed shoebox.  He wears clip-on sunglasses, a hat pulled low, a thin overcoat on his plump body. \nINT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nJohn comes from the stairwell door, looks, walks up the hall. The walls are graffitied.  The soiled floor is wet in spots. ARGUMENTS and LOUD CHILDREN are HEARD from behind closed doors. John comes to apartment 303.  He's winded from the climb.  He takes out keys, lets himself in.  Closes the door. \nEXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT \nSomerset stands at the edge, holding the photo of Mrs. Gold.  He puffs on a cigarette, looks out at the city lights. \nSOMERSET It's like he's preaching. (pause) The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, as a learning tool.  The sins distract man from true worship.  True faith. \nMills is seated at the table with art books open. \nA breeze fans the pages of the books.  The flipping pages reveal views of heaven, hell, adoration, crucifixion and sin. \nMILLS Like in these paintings, and in Dante's Purgatory, right?  But, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy climb that big mountain... \nSOMERSET Seven Terraces of Purgation. \nMILLS Anyway... pride comes first, not gluttony.  And in all the paintings, the sins are in a different order.  I can't find a pattern. \nSOMERSET Because there's creativity in the mix. Consider these books as the murderer's inspiration.  Or aspiration. \nSomerset drops his cigarette to the empty street, watching the glowing tip fall.  He looks at the woman's circled eyes. \nSOMERSET (CONT) He sees himself contributing to the body of Christian work. \nMILLS He's punishing these people. \nSOMERSET For all of us to see and learn from. These murders are like forced attrition. \nMILLS What?  Forced what? \nSOMERSET Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God. \nMILLS Because someone's holding a gun on you. \nSomerset thinks.  He walks from the edge to Mills. \nSOMERSET When Mr. Gold's wife found the body, about how long was she in the apartment? \nMILLS She didn't find it.  The door to the apartment was open and a neighbor... \nSOMERSET I thought you said she found the body. When she got back from a business trip. \nMILLS No.  She got back after you and I had already been there. \nSomerset thinks, coming up with something. \nMILLS (CONT) What? \nSomerset holds up the photo of Mrs. Gold. \nSOMERSET Maybe she is supposed to see something... she just hasn't had a chance to see it yet. \nINT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT \nThe room is like a bland hotel room.  Mills stands beside MRS GOLD.  He shows her photos from the murder scene.  Mrs. Gold is crying.  Somerset stands across the room. \nMILLS Please, look for anything strange or out of place.  Anything at all. \nMILLS (CONT) He fucked us. \nSomerset backs away from the wall, staring at the space where the painting hung.  There is only a nail.  He stares intently, then turns and walks out of the room. \nMills holds his hands to his temples, furious.  SOMERSET can be HEARD from the other room, going through drawers, dropping things.  GLASS is HEARD BREAKING.  Mills grabs a lamp and throws it on the floor. \nMILLS (CONT) Son of a bitch! \nSomerset comes back in, holding something.  He steps over the lamp and goes to the blank wall space. \nMILLS (CONT) What? \nSOMERSET Bear with me. \nMills watches.  Somerset has a woman's make-up compact in hand. He opens it, uses the soft brush to begin applying the red rouge powder to the wall around the nail. \nMILLS (incredulous) Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding. \nSOMERSET Shut up and wait! \nSomerset brushes with wider strokes.  He blows, leans very close to the wall to study the powder.  Leans closer still.  Pause. \nSOMERSET (CONT) Call the print lab.  Now. \nINT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nTracy is asleep with lights on.  She stirs, opens her eyes. \nINT.  MILLS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nTracy opens the door, enters.  It's quiet.  She sees Mills and Somerset are gone.  She's all alone.  Unhappy. \nEXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT \nThrough the window, we can see into the bedroom.  Tracy comes back from the living room.  She goes to her side of the bed, kneels.  She reaches between the mattress and bedspring, takes out a paperback book she has hidden there. \nShe comes to the window, opens it and climbs out onto the fire escape.  She sits, dangles her feet through the metal bars.  She opens the book and tries to read by the street light, resting her head against the railing.  A WOMAN is HEARD SCREAMING distantly. \nTracy looks down the empty street, unsettled.  The woman is not heard again. \nTracy lays back, looks at the sky, holding herself.  We can now see the title of the book: PREPARING FOR PARENTHOOD.  There is a picture of a baby on the cover. \nTracy cries, quietly. \nINT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nA MALE FORENSIC uses a magnifying glass to study a very clear fingerprint in black powder on the wall. \nFORENSIC Oh, boy... \nMILLS (O.S.) Talk to me. \nThe forensic bites his lip, still studying. \nMills and Somerset watch the forensic who works offscreen. \nMILLS (CONT) (to Somerset) Listen, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this?  Been involved in anything remotely like this? \nSOMERSET No.  I have not. \nFORENSIC (O.S.) Well, I can tell you this, detectives... \nThe forensic steps down from a stool.  Behind him, where the painting once was, there are fingerprints, clear and distinct. The prints have been left side by side, to form letters which form the words: HELP ME. \nFORENSIC (CONT) ...just by studying the underloop... these are not the victim's prints. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, PRINT LAB -- NIGHT \nDark.  A TECHNICIAN sits before an old computer.  The computer's green screen shows fingerprints being aligned, compared and then rejected; whir - click - whir - click - whir - click.  Mills and Somerset watch, bathed in the green glow. \nSOMERSET It doesn't work for me.  I can't believe he wants us to help him stop. \nMILLS Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of schizoids out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  With tiny voices whispering nasty things in their ears. \nSomerset doesn't buy it.  The technician adjusts a knob. \nTECHNICIAN I've seen this baby take three days to finish a cycle, so you guys can go cross your fingers somewhere else. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nSomerset and Mills come from the print lab.  A janitor is mopping the hall.  The computer is HEARD WHIRRING AND CLICKING onwards.  Somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the door.  Mills flops beside him. \nSOMERSET You really meant what you said to Mrs. Gold.  You really believe we'll get him, don't you? \nMILLS And you don't? \nSOMERSET I wish I still thought like you.  I'm so far gone from that. \nMILLS So, tell me what you think we're doing. \nSOMERSET All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence... all the pictures, statements.  Write everything down and note what time things happened. We take it all, make a nice, neat pile and file it away.  Just in case it's ever needed in a courtroom. \nMILLS You're unbelievable.  In my entire life, you're the oldest man I've ever met. \nSOMERSET I've seen even the most promising clues lead to dead ends.  Hundreds of times. \nMILLS I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick-boy you seem to think I am. \nSomerset takes out a cigarette and lights it. \nSOMERSET In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if every un- revenged corpse were to suddenly rise and walk again, there would be no more room for the living. \nMills slumps back, crosses his arms, closes his eyes to sleep. \nMILLS Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight... that adrenalin.  Like we were getting somewhere. (pause) And, don't try to tell me it was because you thought we found something that would play well in a courtroom. \nSomerset looks at Mills, puffs the cigarette.  The computer is heard: whir - click - whir - click... \nMILLS Get up now, motherfucker!  Now! \nINT.  SLUM APARTMENT, ADJOINING ROOM -- MORNING \nThe blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion. \nThe room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of colorful, plastic air fresheners. \nINT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING \nSomerset moves in, looks around.  He notices the area around the bed, the ceiling, walls and floor, has been painted indigo, while the rest of the room is its original white.  On a wall, a white sheet is pinned up with a square drawn on it in excrement. \nMILLS I said get up, Sleepyhead! \nMills pulls the indigo blanket off the bed, reveals the shriveled, sore-covered form of a black man who is blindfolded and tied to the bed with a thin wire wrapped time and time again around the bed.  Tubes lead from the stained loincloth around the man's waist and snake under the bed.  The victim is partially covered by what seem to be piles of black spaghetti. \nCALIFORNIA Oh, fuck me! \nSomerset pushes past the cops who recoil from the stench. \nMILLS Holy shit. \nSOMERSET Sloth... it's sloth. \nThe black cop touches the black spaghetti.  Holds a piece. \nBLACK COP What the hell... those are dead worms. \nCALIFORNIA (to Somerset) Check this out, dick. \nCalifornia points with his gun to the end of the black man's right arm.  The hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago. \nMILLS It's him.  It's Zero. \nSOMERSET Someone call an ambulance. \nCALIFORNIA Someone call a hearse, more like. \nThe female cop has gone to the wall where the sheet is pinned up.  She pulls the sheet aside and finds: fifty-two polaroid pictures; all pictures of Zero tied to the bed, with a date written at the bottom of each.  it is a visual history of Zero's physical decay.  The blond cop enters from the other room. \nBLOND COP What the fuck is going on? \nMILLS Hey, California.  Get your people out. \nSomerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on. \nCALIFORNIA You heard him.  Hit the hall, and don't touch anything. \nThe other cops file out as Mills goes to examine the polaroids under the sheet.  Somerset replaces the sheet over Zero's body. California stays by his side. \nCALIFORNIA (CONT) It looks like he's some kind of friggin' wax sculpture. \nSomerset places his finger along Zero's throat. \nMILLS Somerset, you... you better look here. \nMills studies the polaroids.  Somerset walks to join him. \nMILLS (CONT) All pictures of Zero tied to the bed. (crouches) The last one's dated three days ago. \nSomerset looks at the first photo.  In it, Zero is bound and gagged, but he is fit, healthy. \nSOMERSET (awed) The first photo... it's dated one year ago.  Almost to the day. \nCalifornia lifts Zero's blanket to peek under, examining with morbid curiosity. \nCALIFORNIA Mo-ther... \nMills kneels and lifts the bottom of the sheet off the floor, finds an open shoebox.  On the box: TO THE DETECTIVES. \nMILLS What's this? \nCalifornia leans close to Zero's gaunt, blindfolded face. \nCALIFORNIA You got what you deserved, Zero. \nSomerset leans down beside Mills.  Mills looks through the shoebox.  Inside are plastic, zip-lock bags.  One bag contains small clumps of hair, one contains a yellow liquid... \nMILLS A urine sample... hair sample... fingernail clippings.  He's laughing at us. \nCalifornia is still close to Zero's face when suddenly Zero's lips twist.  Zero lets out a loud, guttural bark.  California jerks back in fear, shouting, falling over a chair. \nMills and Somerset reel, standing.  They see California on the ground, scared out of his mind, pointing. \nCALIFORNIA He's alive! \nMills and Somerset look towards the bed. \nZero's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan. \nCALIFORNIA He's still alive! \nEXT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING -- MORNING \nA crowd has gathered.  Mills' car, the police van and two ambulances are parked on the sidewalk. \nINT.  SLUM APARTMENT, HALLWAY -- MORNING \nThe siege cops are in the hall, holding neighbors at bay. \nINT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING \nThree ambulance attendants are at the bed, working on Zero.  One attendant uses wire-cutters to clip Zero's bonds. \nINT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING \nMills and Somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs. They are both highly agitated. \nBLEEKER (O.S.,CONT) This is an example.  Gluttony is the sin, and the color is orange.  This particular manuscript is preserved from the 18th century. \nSOMERSET (O.S.) In the murders, gluttony is green. Greed is yellow.  Sloth is indigo. \nBleeker steps away and Somerset gets closer to the pages. \nBLEEKER So, if this murderer is as precise as you say, then you need to find out at what period in history was gluttony green... and so on. \nSOMERSET Where do I look?  If the colors changed so often? \nBLEEKER (contemplates) There is one man... Father Stone. (pause) I haven't heard from him for quite some time.  This was his passion.  He spent his life studying the sins... and preaching against them. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON \nThe chalkboard on the wall:  1 gluttony (x)       5 wrath 2 greed (x)          6 pride 3 sloth (x)          7 lust 4 envy \nMills is behind his paperwork covered desk, listening to a uniformed OFFICER who looks over a report sheet. \nOFFICER Zero's landlord said an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month. He says, quote, \"I never heard a single complaint from this guy and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I ever had.\" \nMILLS There's a landlord's dream tenant.  A paralyzed man with no tongue. \nOFFICER Who pays his rent on time. \nMILLS Bring me everything as soon as it's transcribed. \nThe officer leaves.  Mills starts sorting through piles on his desk.  He doesn't know where to begin. \nHe sits back in his chair, looks at the collage-like collection of pictures pinned on the walls: photos and diagrams of the murder scenes, the drawing of the sun and eye, color pages and black and white copies of pages from art books. \nHe stares, thinking.  He stands, takes a photocopy off the wall. The killer's first note: \nDear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to the light. \nMILLS (to himself) Milton. \nINT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY -- AFTERNOON \nBig brass lamps hang from the high ceiling.  Mahogany chairs and tables run down the center floor which is bordered by three levels of balconies.  People wander like ants in an ant farm. \nMills walks, taking it all in.  He goes to the circulation desk. Impatient patrons wait in a long line.  He watches the bored HEAD LIBRARIAN, female, 64, help an old man at the desk. \nShe opens the old man's books, runs a laser pen over a bar code sticker, pushes a few buttons on a computer. \nINT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY, TOP BALCONY -- LATER AFTERNOON \nNear the balcony railing, overlooking the main floor, Mills sits before a computer card catalog.  He reads the computer screen, unsure.  He sets down his pad and pencil, cracks his knuckles, begins typing on the keyboard.  The computer gives off a quiet BEEP.  Pleased, Mills reads the screen.  Types. \nOn the screen:                 TITLE / PARADISE LOST_ \nHe hits return.  Reads the screen as information on the book appears.  He copies it on his pad, puts the pencil in his mouth. \nHe types.  On the screen:      SUBJECT / JACK THE RIPPER_ \nHits return.  Again, he copies info from the screen. \nINT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER -- AFTERNOON \nA monk opens a formidable gateway door, letting Father Bleeker and Somerset into a garden courtyard.  Bleeker now wears his priestly garb and collar.  The monastery's main building looms at the end of a pathway.  The building is stately, ivy-covered. \nBLEEKER Father Stone had a church and congregation of his own.  But, he... there were some problems.  The church is deserted now. \nSOMERSET Problems? \nBleeker continues walking. \nSOMERSET (CONT) Father? \nINT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON \nThe walls of the hallway are carved with images of saints. Bleeker whispers to Somerset beside a windowless door. \nBLEEKER There was a small orphanage attached to the church, overseen by Father Stone. This was almost thirty years ago. (hesitant) He was an excellent priest, devoted in every way.  Many in his parish demanded his return. \nSOMERSET Tell me what happened. \nBleeker sees a NUN down the hall, coming towards them. \nBLEEKER Allegations were made... Stone was accused of abusing the children in his care.  But, those charges were never substantiated. \nSOMERSET What abuse? \nBLEEKER It was claimed... that the children were beaten.  And, punished severely. \nThe nun is too close for Bleeker to speak freely. \nINT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, STONE'S ROOM -- AFTERNOON \nThe door is unlocked and opened by the nun.  Somerset enters and Bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door.  It's dark. \nFATHER STONE, 73, is in a wheelchair.  Feeble and frail, eyes sunken in their sockets.  He looks up at Somerset. \nSOMERSET Father Stone.  I'm a policeman.  I'd like to ask you a few questions, if it's alright? \nThe whites of Stone's eyes have yellowed.  He seems to nod. Somerset sits on a stool, close. \nSOMERSET (CONT) I want to ask you about the seven deadly sins. \nSTONE The sins. \nSOMERSET Yes, father. \nStone reaches out a hand to touch Somerset's face.  Stone's extremely long fingernails trail against Somerset's cheek and Somerset tries to hide his revulsion. \nSTONE Are you one of mine? \nSOMERSET I don't... \nMills fumbles in his pocket, takes out his pad and reads. \nMILLS (CONT) Let's say you take, Dante's Purgatory, call number eight-five-one-D, and... The Biography of the Marquis de Sade, ninety-two S-A-D-E.  Put those books in the system, and the computer can give you the name of anyone who's ever taken out both those books.  And, it doesn't just give you their name and address, it gives you a complete history of their library reading habits. \nMills slaps the list in Somerset's hand. \nMILLS (CONT) (psyched up) If somebody's out there reading Paradise Lost and studying The Life and Times of Charlie Manson, I want to talk to them. \nSomerset looks up from the list, warming to it.  He starts looking around, searching for someone. \nEXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON \nSomerset and Mills exit down the stairs.  Somerset's still searching, holding the list.  He spies a uniformed cop, DARIO. \nSOMERSET Dario!  Come here. \nDario runs up.  Somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes him walk with him.  Mills continues on to his car. \nSOMERSET (CONT) According to the Father, this orphanage wasn't around for more than five or six years in the late fifties.  So, I want someone to go to the Department of Child Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the records on this place.  Understand? \nDARIO I got it. \nSOMERSET Get a list of every child who attended this orphanage before it shut down.  Get it on my desk within the hour. \nSomerset releases Dario, who runs to obey.  Somerset goes to his own car.  Mills is driving to leave, stops, revs the engine. Somerset hands the computer list through the window. \nSOMERSET (CONT) You thought of this all by yourself? This was your brainstorm? \nMILLS Yeah.  Is that so hard for you to believe? \nSOMERSET It's a pleasant surprise. \nMILLS I'm not as stupid as I look. \nMills peels away.  Somerset heads to his own car. \nSOMERSET (to himself) I guess not. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING \nSeven large photos hang with the other materials on the wall: \nThe seven tableau paintings.  Gluttony, greed and sloth, followed by vanity.  Vanity shows a woman standing in front of a mirror, staring at her image.  The floor around her is scattered with flowers.  The primary color is violet, and as in all the paintings, there is a quality of ugliness in the character. \nMILLS (O.S.) Ramirez.  Manuel Ramirez. \nSOMERSET (O.S.) No... I don't see any Ramirez. \nThe lust painting is next.  It shows a man standing over a woman.  The woman is nude, under a sheet, and the man's features are bizarre, lecherous.  He wants that woman.  There are apples on the floor and on the bed.  The color is red. \nMILLS (O.S.) Elinski.  Dennis Elinski. \nSOMERSET (O.S.) No. \nEnvy is particularly gruesome.  The Devil is seen hovering in the air, wearing a crown, his body orange and slick, wrapped in a cloak of flames.  His arms held high, his right hand grips a sword, a bolt of lightning, arrows, wheat, thistles, etc.  His left hand, holds a plain globe around which a serpent has wrapped itself.  He looks down at several pitiful mortals in a pit of fire.  The mortals reach for him, yearn for him, the skin on their bodies is stretched taut over their bones. \nMILLS (O.S.) Atwater?  Paul Atwater. \nSOMERSET (O.S.) No. \nWrath shows a man surrounded by vaporous, satanic demons.  He stands in a puddle of blood, looking at his hands stained with and dripping blood.  Other than the rich red, the color is blue. \nMills is at his desk, a good portion of the print-out list draped to the floor.  He rubs his eyes, sighing, gets back to it.  Somerset, at the temporary desk, studies his orphan list. \nMILLS Okay, here we go.  Listen to the books this guy's been taking out... (reading list) Basic Homicide Investigation.  Forensic Toxicology... The Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers... (looks up, excited) Of Human Bondage. \nSOMERSET That's not what you think it is. \nMills is disappointed, runs his finger further down the page. \nMILLS Holy shit.  Somerset... (reading list) The Writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. \nMills points to the drawing of \"the Sun in splendor with the eye\" which hangs on the wall. \nMILLS (CONT) Aquinas.  Right? \nSOMERSET That's right.  Let me have it. \nMills looks at the page... searching... \nMILLS Fuck... he used a false name. \nSOMERSET How do you know? \nMILLS His library card lists him as Jonathan Doe.  John Doe. \nMills sits back, angry.  Something strikes Somerset as odd. Familiar.  He starts leafing quickly through the orphanage list. \nMILLS (CONT) What? \nSomerset finds what he's looking for. \nSOMERSET Christ... it's like a sick joke. \nMILLS What are you talking about? \nSOMERSET There is one boy here.  He was abandoned... no one knew who his parents were, so he was named at the orphanage... (looks at Mills) John Doe.  It's his legal name. \nINT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- EARLY EVENING \nSomerset and Mills climb stairs, turn a corner into this hall. \nMILLS It's impossible odds that this is him. \nSOMERSET We're focusing. \nMILLS I know, I know.  On one little thing. I'm not complaining.  I'll follow anything we get and I'll take it any way we can get it. \nSOMERSET (CONT) I mean, literally. \nEXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT \nSomerset's car stops at the corner of Mills' street. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT \nSomerset puts the car in park.  Tracy sits for a long time, then turns to face Somerset. \nTRACY You've lived here for so long, Somerset. You know this city.  I... \nTracy can't quite figure how to put it. \nSOMERSET It's a hard place, Tracy. \nTRACY When David and I lived in Philadelphia, we could afford to live on the outskirts.  But now... (pause) I hate it here.  I feel scared, and I feel sick and... I hate it. \nTracy wants to laugh, like it's silly, but can't pull it off. \nSOMERSET You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.  But, keep in mind, Tracy, like tonight, there are small pockets of sanity.  Some bars and bookstores. Museums.  Several last vestiges of civilization. \nEXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT \nIn Somerset's car, Tracy and Somerset continue talking. \nOn the other side of the street, closer to the middle of the block, John Doe's car is parallel parked at the curb. \nINT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT \nBehind the wheel, John Doe is slumped low, calmly watching Somerset and Tracy.  He can see them clearly from here. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT \nTracy looks out through the windshield, fighting tears. \nTRACY I've visited so many of the schools, looking for work, you know.  And, the conditions are... horrible.  I can't believe how bad it is. (pause) Children shouldn't have to grow up here. \nSOMERSET You can always look into the private schools.  You'll find something. \nSomerset gives her a handkerchief.  She wipes her tears. \nSOMERSET (CONT) You're too hard on yourself, Tracy. \nShe will not look at him, keeping herself under control. \nSOMERSET (CONT) It's okay to hate this city.  It's natural.  But, there is a bright side in all this.  There is.  You want to hear it? \nTracy is able to muster a small smile. \nTRACY Oh, God, yes.  Please. \nSOMERSET I can't think of another place that needs education more than this city. And you're a teacher.  You can make a difference in a few people's lives. It's a very good thing. \nTracy leans to give him a kiss on the cheek. \nTRACY Goodnight, Somerset. \nThey remain close, looking into each other's eyes. \nSOMERSET Goodnight. \nSomerset reaches to touch Tracy's face.  They kiss.  They kiss a long time.  Tracy wraps her arms around Somerset's neck. Somerset runs his fingers through Tracy's hair.  They share their sorrow.  Tracy's tears run down her face.  Finally, they part, opening their eyes. \nThey know this is wrong.  Somerset's hands are shaking.  He grips the wheel, feels helpless. \nSOMERSET (CONT) I'm sorry, Tracy.  I'm sorry. \nTracy's face is flushed.  She is confused. \nTRACY I... I better go. \nTracy gets out, neglects to close the door, not looking back. \nSomerset tries to come to his senses.  He doesn't understand either, and his heart is aching.  He adjusts the rearview mirror to watch Tracy go. \nINSERT -- THROUGH REARVIEW MIRROR -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V. \nTracy walks down the block, straightening her hair.  She runs. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT \nSomerset looks away from the mirror.  he holds his head in his hands for a moment. \nEXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT \nSomerset leans to pull the door shut, puts the car in gear. He drives, turns the corner. \nINT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT \nJohn Doe watches Somerset's car leave.  Doe turns his attention to Tracy, who hurries along the other side of the street.  Tracy looks back, enters her apartment building, digs out her keys. She gets through the door and climbs stairs, disappearing. \nEXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT \nDoe gets out of his car. \nHe looks both ways down the street, walks towards Mills' and Tracy's building. \nINT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- LATER NIGHT \nMills and Tracy are asleep in their bed.  Mills' eyes shift under their lids.  Rapid eye movement. \nA SOUND is HEARD from the other room.  Mills awakens.  He lays still a moment, then gets up, slowly, reaches to take his gun off the bedside table.  He grabs his pants from a chair, slides into them. \nINT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT \nMills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up. He moves, crouching. \nEXT.  CITY STREETS, PORNO DISTRICTS -- AFTERNOON \nPorno theaters and Adult Bookstores rule these busy sidewalks. Marquees offer SEXY STUFF, PUSSY FEST and movies like MIDNIGHT PLOWBOY and NATIONAL LAM-PORN'S CHRISTMAS INSERTION.  Cops are walking through the pedestrian flow, handing out photocopies. There are many patrol cars on the street.  Definitely a larger than usual police presence. \nCops are questioning the proprietors of porn at the entrances of their shops and theaters. \nCops are taping photocopies onto lamp posts.  These photocopies are warnings, with the drawing of John Doe's face above a line of information and the words HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN? \nINT.  WILD BILL'S LEATHER SHOPPE -- AFTERNOON \nSomerset's holding up the composite sketch of John Doe. \nWILD BILL (O.S.) Yeah, he was here.  This morning. \nMills and Somerset are across the sales counter from WILD BILL, 37.  Wild Bill is shirtless, covered in tattoos.  A thick scar runs down his forehead to his bent nose.  Leather belts, whips and jackets hang from the walls. \nMILLS It was definitely him?  You're positive? \nWILD BILL Yeah.  John Doe.  Easy name to remember. \nSOMERSET What was this job you did for him? \nWild Bill pulls a box from behind the counter, digs in it. \nWILD BILL I got a picture of it.  That's what he came for this morning.  I figured he must be one of those art guys... like those guys who piss in a cup and drink it on stage.  Performance art. \nWild Bill gives a polaroid to Mills.  We don't see the image. \nMILLS Oh, fuck... \nWILD BILL I think I undercharged him.  I was up all night working to finish it. \nSOMERSET (looks at photo) You built this for him?  You built this? \nWILD BILL I've built weirder shit than that. \nA BEEL CHIMES as a POLICEMAN enters the store. \nPOLICEMAN Somerset... we have a situation. \nMills and Somerset follow the policeman out. \nWILD BILL Hey, my picture! \nThey're gone.  Wild Bill scratches his scar. \nWILD BILL (CONT) Fucking pigs. \nEXT.  THE HOT HOUSE MASSAGE PARLOR -- AFTERNOON \nIt's a madhouse outside The Hot House.  Police action in progress.  Cops have formed a barrier, holding off a crowd and creating an aisle to the back of a jail-van.  Cops and detectives escort various men, women and transvestites into the large vehicle.  The crowd, consisting of the dregs of society, is angry.  Some spit and throw trash at the cops. \nINT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RECEPTION AREA -- AFTERNOON \nAn ANGRY COP pounds his nightstick on a glass cage.  Inside the cage sits an oily FAT MAN in front of a wall of sex toys. \nFAT MAN Just wait! \nCOP Get out of the fucking booth! \nFAT MAN Just wait!  I'll come out, just wait! \nINT.  THE HOT HOUSE, CORRIDORS -- AFTERNOON \nAll the lights and walls are red.  Mills and Somerset follow a COP through the twisting corridors.  ROCK MUSIC THROBS.  They reach a door. \nCOP I don't want to go in there again. \nINT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RED ROOM -- AFTERNOON \nMills and Somerset enter.  ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES, LOUD.  A strobe light flashes from the ceiling onto TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS. The first attendant places a sheet over a bed, hiding the corpse of a WOMAN with long blonde hair.  The second attendant tries to examine the pupils of a CRAZED MAN, 55, who sits naked on the floor, wrapped in a sheet.  A COP holds the crazed man down. \nCRAZED MAN He... he... he made me do it! \nSECOND ATTENDANT I have to look at you.  I have to look at you. \nAn X is scratched into the red paint on the wall.  Mills and Somerset move towards the covered body. \nThere are apples on the bed and floor.  The ROCK MUSIC from outside SUDDENLY STOPS. \nFIRST ATTENDANT You're not going to want to see this more than once. \nCRAZED MAN He had a gun!  He... he made me do it! \nThe sheet is lifted for the detectives.  They grimace at what they see.  We do not see.  Somerset closes his eyes and walks to face a wall, shaken.  The first attendant replaces the sheet. \nMills steps back, takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it. \nCRAZED MAN (O.S.,CONT) He made me do it! \nINT.  SANATORIUM, WHITE ROOM -- AFTERNOON \nA polaroid is on a white table.  It is the photo Wild Bill gave to Mills and Somerset.  It is a picture of a belt, made with extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the groin.  It is a strap-on phallus, but there is no plastic protuberance.  Instead, there is a metal knife.  It is a strap- on butcher's knife. \nSomerset is seated beside the white table in this white room. Mills stands behind him.  The crazed man from the lust murder is in a chair across the room.  The crazed man is crying. \nCRAZED MAN And... and... and he said... he asked if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand. \nSOMERSET Where was the girl? \nCRAZED MAN What?  What? \nSOMERSET Where was the prostitute? \nCRAZED MAN She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed. \nSOMERSET Who tied her down?  You or him? \nEXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT \nJohn Doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes. Factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for miles.  We can HEAR TUGBOAT HORNS sounding low and deep.  We're near the water. \nDoe seems to know where he's going.  He passes stacks of industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky. \nHe walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment.  It's like a stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs. \nAt the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow alleyway formed by two warehouses.  Doe enters, looking up at the single lit bulb on the wall above. \nHe looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap, walks under the bulb.  He throws the hubcap with all his might. It soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind. \nDoe takes aim with the rock.  He throws, grunting. \nThe rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley. \nDoe walks back to the mouth of the alley.  He stops and turns to start from there.  He walks, deliberately, looking down at his feet.    FOLLOW as he walks. \nHe stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the ground in front of him again.  He takes off his thick glasses. \nHe holds the glasses in his hand. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nSomerset is in bed.  The metronome is sounding: tick, tick, tick... The SOUNDS of the CITY are LOUD. \nSomerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome.  Tick, tick, tick... A MAN and a WOMAN are HEARD SCREAMING at each other incoherently from outside.  Somerset rolls over, restless. Tick, tick, tick... \nA THIRD VOICE is HEARD from outside.  This man is screaming at the other two people to shut up.  Somerset opens his eyes, sits up.  He reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against the wall. \nINSERT -- TITLE CARD \nSUNDAY \nINT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING \nSomerset sits away from the bed.  He's smoking a cigarette.  The PHONE RINGS.  Somerset gets up, not in the best of moods. \nSOMERSET (into phone) Hello. \nTRACY (V.O.) (from phone, upset) Hello, Somerset.  It's Tracy. \nSOMERSET Is everything alright? \nTRACY (V.O.) Yes.  Everything's fine.  Could... could you meet me somewhere.  To talk. \nSOMERSET (pause) I don't think that's a good idea. \nTRACY (V.O.) I need to talk to someone, Somerset. You're the only friend I have here.  I don't know anyone else. \nINT.  COFFEE CAFE -- MORNING \nSomerset and Tracy are seated in a booth by the window.  The city's morning rush passes by outside.  The cafe is noisy. Tracy is very upset.  Somerset is very uneasy. \nSOMERSET David doesn't know about this?  You haven't told him? \nTracy shakes her head.  Somerset sighs.  Long silence. \nSOMERSET (CONT) I have to tell you, Tracy, I'm not the one to talk to about this. \nTRACY I just can't think straight.  I don't know why I called you, except I can't stand to hold it as a secret anymore.  I had to get it out... and I can't tell David yet.  Not yet. \nSomerset takes out his cigarettes, but thinks better of it and puts them away.  He watches Tracy stir her coffee. \nSOMERSET I... I had a relationship once, very much like a marriage.  And, there was a baby.  A long time ago.  Things were good.  And I got up one morning, and I went on a case... a murder, like any other.  Except it was my first since hearing about the baby.  And, I felt this fear and anxiety coming over me.  I looked around and I thought, how can I raise a child here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have children,  And, over the next few weeks... I convinced her... \nTears come to Somerset's eyes. \nSOMERSET (CONT) I mean, I wore her down... slowly. \nTRACY I want to have children.  But... \nSOMERSET I can tell you, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive it was the right thing to do.  But, there's never a day that goes by that I don't wish I had decided differently. \nTracy reaches to hold Somerset's hand, but he withdraws it, wipes his tears away. \nSOMERSET (CONT) If you... if you decide not to have the baby... if that's what you decide, then never tell Mills you were pregnant. I mean that.  Never tell. (pause) Your marriage would just wither, and die altogether. \nTracy looks around the cafe, tears in her eyes. \nSOMERSET (CONT) But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him.  Tell him that exact second.  And, spoil that kid every chance you get. \nTRACY Somerset... \nSomerset stands.  He forces a smile. \nSOMERSET That's all the wisdom I can share with you, Tracy.  I barely know you. \nTRACY Will I see you again, before you leave? \nSOMERSET Probably not.  But, it's probably better that way. \nSomerset steps away, leaves.  Tracy watches him go. \nEXT.  CITY STREET -- DAY \nMills and Somerset walk towards the precinct house.  They wade through cars to cross the street. \nSOMERSET I've decided... I want to stay on, till this is over.  Till either it's done, or we can see it will never end. \nMills remains impassive. \nMILLS Oh, you want to stay now? \nSOMERSET One of two things is going to happen. We're either going to get John Doe... or, he will finish his series of seven, and he'll never be found. \nMILLS You think if you stay you're doing me some big favor? \nMILLS Damn it, Somerset.  You know Johnny's fucking with us.  He's pissing in our faces again! \nSOMERSET Slow up.  You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn't just stop. \nMILLS Well... what the fuck, man? \nSOMERSET John Doe's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  But, can you even conceive of what might happen next?  I mean, can you tell me how he's going to go about it? \nMILLS (pause) No. \nSOMERSET I can tell you this; I recognize his lawyer.  His name is Mark Swarr.  He's the one who kept Zero out of prison. (pause) We'll wait for John Doe's plea. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY \nMills is at the desk with his feet up, stares at the chalkboard: \n1 gluttony (x)       5 lust (x) 2 greed (x)          6 wrath 3 sloth (x)          7 envy 4 pride (x) \nClock on the wall says 4:45.  Somerset packs books into boxes, preparing for his eventual departure.  The captain opens the door and steps into the office.  He clears his throat, looking like there is something very wrong. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nMills and Somerset stand together.  The captain is behind his desk with the D.A., Martin Talbot, seated in front of him.  Mark Swarr addresses them all, seems nervous, but in control. \nSWARR My client says there are two more bodies... two more dead, hidden away. He will take Detective Mills to these bodies, but only Detective Mills.  Only at six o'clock, today. \nSwarr wipes his brow with a handkerchief. \nTALBOT Oh, Christ. \nMILLS Why me? \nSWARR He says he admires you. \nSOMERSET (to captain) This is all part of his game plan. \nSWARR Mr. Doe claims that if the detective does not accept this offer, the bodies will never be found. \nCAPTAIN Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to let them rot. \nMills walks up into Swarr's face. \nMILLS You like what you do for a living? \nCAPTAIN Back off, Mills. \nSWARR I'm required by law to serve my clients to the best of my ability, and to serve their interests. \nMills eases off.  Talbot is agitated, tapping a finger on the gold tooth in his mouth.  He looks at Swarr. \nTALBOT We don't make deals like this. \nCAPTAIN We're going to have to pass. \nSWARR My client... he also wishes that I inform you, if you do not accept, he will plead insanity, across the board. \nTALBOT Let him try.  I'd like to see him try! \nSWARR Come now, Martin.  Even he knows, with the nature of these crimes, I could get him off with such a plea. \nTalbot stands, wringing his hands.  Mills and Somerset are looking at each other, thinking it over. \nTALBOT I'm not letting this conviction slide. I can tell you that, right here and right now! \nSWARR He says, if you accept, under his specific conditions, he will sign a full confession and plead guilty... right here, and right now. \nTalbot looks at Swarr with hatred. \nMILLS I'll do it. \nSOMERSET Hold on... just a minute. \nSomerset turns to Talbot. \nSOMERSET (CONT) If he were to plead insanity... this conversation is admissible.  The fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea... \nSWARR And, my client reminds you, two more people are dead.  The press would have a field day if they found out the police didn't seem too concerned about finding them... giving them proper burial. \nMILLS I'll do it.  I want to finish it. \nSomerset is thinking it through.  He looks at Mills. \nSOMERSET (to captain) Well... let's get the fucking lawyer out of the room, and we can talk about how this whole thing's going to go down. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON \nMills' hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor.  He's shirtless, his chest covered in shaving cream.  He starts shaving in front of a mirror.  Somerset is behind him, smoking. \nSOMERSET If John Doe's head splits open, and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it. \nMILLS I will. \nSOMERSET No emotion.  Stay as cold as ice. \nMILLS I will. \nSomerset flicks ash in the sink.  Mills finishes shaving.  He steps away from the sink and wipes his chest off with a towel. \nMILLS (CONT) (very serious) Listen, Somerset... we've been through a lot together.  And, I uh... \nSOMERSET What is it? \nMILLS I would like to make sweet love to you. \nSomerset walks away.  Mills laughs. \nSOMERSET Please... \nThe helicopter dips, flying like a bullet over the city skyline, heading towards the river and the setting sun. \nEXT.  CITY STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON \nFROM HIGH ABOVE, we see traffic on the highway at the polluted river's edge.  Cards and trucks move like blood through veins. \nDOWN CLOSER, we can see Mills' car in the flow.  The car turns into a lane of traffic on its way to the huge suspension bridge. \nSomerset's car is in close pursuit. \nUNDER THE BRIDGE, the police helicopter travels close to the water, moving parallel to the bridge, but low, so that it's out of the sightline of the vehicles above. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON \nTraffic is bumper to bumper.  Somerset moves his headset mouthpiece to smoke a cigarette.  He steers onto the bridge, under the massive girders. \nMILLS (V.O.) (from receiver) For us to go pick up two more dead bodies, and have that be the end of it... just seems too boring for you. \nINT.  MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON \nBeyond the crest of the bridge, the sunset is crimson. \nMILLS Wouldn't be sensational enough. \nJOHN DOE Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder. \nJohn Doe strains to turn, looks out the back window. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) Sometimes you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer... and then you get their strict attention. \nMILLS What are you looking at, Johnny? \nJOHN DOE Looking back... at the city proper... \nDoe situates forward, holds his hands in front of his face, looking at his bandaged fingers. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) And yet, no pillar of salt. (smiles to himself) Lost on you, isn't it?  You've never read the Bible, have you, David? \nMILLS I remember a lot of people reading it at me when I was a kid.  I preferred the classic comic version myself. \nThis is an affront to Doe, angers him.  Mills sees it, likes it. \nMILLS (CONT) I used to have \"Godspell\" on an eight- track tape.  Does that count? \nDoe leans forwards, fury building in him. \nJOHN DOE You make me sick. \nMILLS Sit back, freak. \nMills slams his fist against the partition.  Doe sits back. \nJOHN DOE (under his breath) Ignorant heathen. \nMILLS Right, right.  I forgot.  You think these murders were for God.  Right? (pause) I'm asking you seriously.  You really think what you did was God's good work? \nDoe looks out the window at other cars, refuses to answer. \nHe's pressing the tips of his forefingers into his thumbs, causing blood to drip from under the bandages. \nJOHN DOE The Lord works in mysterious ways. \nEXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT \nIt's getting dark.  We've been in this section of factories before, with John Doe.  The police helicopter soars overhead. \nINT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT \nCalifornia's looking down, wearing night-vision goggles. \nINSERT -- CALIFORNIA'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH GOGGLES \nThe goggles allow California to see clearly into the maze formed by buildings, yards and worksheds below.  No one in sight. \nCALIFORNIA (O.S.) Fuck, man... there's about a thousand places to be ambushed out here. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT \nThe headlights are off.  Mills' car's red brake lights are far ahead on this industrial road. \nCALIFORNIA (V.O.) (from headset) I don't see anything... not yet. \nSOMERSET (in mouthpiece) A quick sweep is all we get.  Clear out now.  You're right in front of us. \nSomerset reaches to turn up the volume on his radio receiver. Mills is HEARD SINGING \"Jesus Christ Superstar,\" loud.  Somerset allows a very faint smile. \nINT.  MILLS' CAR -- NIGHT \nMills drives along, singing. \nMILLS Jesus Christ, Superstar... who in the world do you think you are?  Jesus Christ, Superstar... \nDoe's in the back seat, trying to bear it, steaming. \nEXT.  INDUSTRIAL SKIES -- NIGHT \nThe chopper goes high, away, over the industrial area. \nIt moves to the other side of the factories and settles in low over the river. \nINT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT \nMills' tune comes to a conclusion.  Somerset slows the car as he sees Mills' brake lights go on ahead. \nJOHN DOE (V.O.) (from receiver) We can walk from here. \nSOMERSET (in mouthpiece) You stay out of this unless I call you in, California.  Understand? \nDoe begins twisting the loose end of the rope around the statue. \nJOHN DOE The irony, David, is that you policemen and I want the same things.  But, you are so short sighted.  In this city, where you can see a deadly sin on every street corner... and in every home, we want repentance. \nMills clutches the glass piece and starts cutting the rope just above his hands. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) We want good over evil.  We want values instilled in the children.  We want a world where a man or woman can lead a decent life. (pause) Wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord.  Such simple concepts.  Why are they non-existent? \nSomerset manages to life his head, struggles to his knees. \nSOMERSET (weakly) Let him go, God damn you. \nDoe checks to make sure the rope around Saint Emiliani is secure, tightening the knots. \nJOHN DOE There were two men once, who had wonderful gardens.  Two gardens of flowers that went on as far as the eye could see.  Beautiful gardens... the fragrance was inspiration in itself. \nDoe stands behind Emiliani, heaves against the statue. \nMills watches, gritting his teeth, rubbing the glass against the rope, fingers bleeding. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) But, both gardens were beset by problems.  Weeds started to take root, and there were infestations of insects and diseases.  The gardens started to turn putrid.  And, one man fought to save his garden, because he could never forget how it once was.  Everyday he cut the weeds, and killed the insects. Fought the diseases. \nDoe finally topples the statue, down the altar stairs, and the other end of the rope pulls Mills upwards, screaming in pain. Mills is held, about eight feet in the air, legs dangling. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) That man never had a beautiful garden again. \nMILLS Fuck you! \nJOHN DOE The other man plowed his garden under. (pause) He plowed it under the soil.  He started over. \nSomerset gets to his feet, steadying himself on a pew. \nDoe walks across the altar, picks up a long metal pole with a thick wick and candle snuffer on the end.  He lights the wick from a near candle.  The flame burns long and thin.  He looks down at Somerset, takes out his gun. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) Stay there, Somerset.  Or, I'll kill him right now. \nDoe holds the flaming pole up, near Mills. \nSomerset stops.  He looks up at Mills. \nMills is straining.  He nods to Somerset, and Somerset sees Mills cutting at the rope. \nSOMERSET Alright... you don't have to do this, John.  You've already made your point. \nJOHN DOE Do you think I chose this?  Can you even begin to understand how painful my existence has been?  It's like... like having every sense heightened beyond comprehension. \nDoe lowers the flame, standing below and beside Mills, with his attention focused on Somerset. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) So that the stench of the street coats your throat like bile.  So, sugar is so sweet it... it makes your bones ache to the marrow. \nSOMERSET You're insane.  That's why. \nJOHN DOE (seething) No!  You're wrong! \nMills continues cutting, bleeding, almost through the rope.  He begins to swing his feet slightly, his body swaying. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) I was chosen.  And I've wished a thousand times I could have been a normal man.  Like David Mills, a common man... with a common life.  But, wishing that is my sin.  I can't have it and I shouldn't. \nDoe steps towards Mills. \nSOMERSET Don't do this! \nJOHN DOE I meant what I said.  I admire David Mills.  I envy David Mills. (pause) Envy is my sin. \nSOMERSET No! \nJust as Doe is to put the flame to Mills, the rope is finally cut through.  Mills drops, swinging his legs forward, smashing Doe in the face, knocking Doe's glasses off. \nMills hits the floor with a thud. \nSomerset runs forward. \nSOMERSET (CONT) David, get out! \nDoe has fallen back, dropping the metal pole.  Mills scrambles to his feet and charges at Doe, shouting. \nDoe squints, screaming, raises his gun.  Fires twice! \nThe bullets catch Mills in mid-run, and carry him off his feet, backwards. \nSomerset grips his own gun, just as Mills' body falls, tumbles off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him. \nSOMERSET (CONT) No! \nSomerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his throat.  He falls to his knees and halts Mills' body. \nSomerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning Mills over and cradling his head in his arms.  Tears come to his eyes. \nSOMERSET (CONT) David... David?  Please... \nOn the altar, Doe throws his gun away.  he starts feeling around him, unsteady, looking for his glasses. \nMills' eyes are closed.  He is still, bloody.  He swallows. \nWith one gasp, without a word, he is dead. \nSomerset looks up at Doe, vision blurred by rage and tears. \nDoe stands, putting on his glasses, faces Somerset. \nSomerset lays Mills' body down.  Stands, walks up towards the altar, raises his gun. \nSOMERSET (CONT) You. \nDoe stands, quaking, teeth clenched, fists balled up.  He waits for the bullets, falls to his knees. \nThe gun trembles in Somerset's hand as Somerset brings the barrel to Doe's face.  A millisecond's pause.  Somerset changes the angle of fire.  BLAM, he blows John Doe's arm to pieces in a splattering explosion. \n", "test1_input": "INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nMills sits down at his desk.  He starts looking through police paperwork.  The RADIO in the other room goes OFF in mid song. \nINSERT -- TITLE CARD \nTUESDAY \nINT.  AUTOPSY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING \nThe room is cold, clean.  Stainless steel.  White tile.  Many pathologists work at slabs.  Mills and Somerset are with DOCTOR SANTIAGO, 35, who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse. \nSANTIAGO If you take a look here, buddies... I can tell you, it was not a poison. If you can see... I have emptied all of everything out of the stomach.  But, look at it, now that I took away the liver. \nSantiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse.  Mills moves closer beside Somerset, but not too close, trying to hide his disgust.  We hear squashy sounds as Santiago works, but we don't see in. \nSANTIAGO (CONT) I move the lungs over.  First, see how big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is. Now... here is the strange thing, on the stomach.  Stretches. (pointing) And, here is it distended.  Look at the size of that, because of the foods. \nMILLS I can see what you're pointing at... \nSANTIAGO On the stomach.  The lines of distention. \nSomerset's looking in, not believing what he sees. \nSOMERSET Doctor, are you saying this man... ate till he burst? \nSANTIAGO Yes, well, he didn't actually burst.  He was bleeding, inside of himself. And, there's a hemotoma on the outside... on the belly. \nSomerset walks around the slab, looking the body over. \nMILLS He died by eating? \nSANTIAGO Someone punched him, or kicked him. \nSomerset notices something on the partially shaved head. \nHe leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than others, all about the same diameter as a dime. \nSANTIAGO (CONT) Oh, and there is this here... something else you have to look at and see. \nSomerset stands straight, realizes something about the bruises. \nSANTIAGO (CONT) Most of his stomach contents are in the lab now... but, this.  I found these in the fat man's stomach. \nSantiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid.  He picks up a glass jar and shows it to Mills.  In the jar: many little bits of blue plastic.  Like scrapings. \nMILLS Plastic? \nMills gets Somerset's attention, hands him the jar.  Somerset looks at it a long time. \nSANTIAGO Why these were in a fat man's stomach, I don't know. \nINT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING \nOutside the door to the murder scene, Mills and Somerset cut through the RESTRICTED AREA/CRIME SCENE seal. \nSOMERSET Those bruises on the back of the victim's head were caused by the muzzle of a gun. \nMILLS So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and gave him a choice: eat, or get your head blown off. \nINT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- MORNING \nSomerset and Mills enter.  Somerset takes out the jar of plastic scrapings, turns on the now normal light.  They begin to search. \nSOMERSET He was force-fed... till his body started rejecting the food.  He literally couldn't eat another bite. \nMILLS So, the killer held a bucket under him. \nSOMERSET His throat was swollen from the effort. He was bleeding internally. He must have blacked out... and, if you're the killer, you're not going to want to wait around for him to die. \nSomerset examines the counter tops and wall.  Mills gets down on his knees, examines the linoleum floor. \nMILLS You kick him, pop him like a fucking balloon. (touches floor) Somerset, look here. \nSomerset gets down, holds the jar against the linoleum. \nSOMERSET Same color and texture. \nThey both crawl on hands and knees, study every inch of floor. \nMILLS If this is what that is... it doesn't make sense.  It doesn't figure. \nSOMERSET Always look for one thing to focus on. There's always one singular thing, and it might be as small as a speck of dust, but find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility. \nMILLS How are pieces of the floor going to get in the guy's stomach? \nSOMERSET Exactly.  Why would so many pieces be inside his stomach unless they were placed there intentionally? \nSomerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum, fingers the grooves.  He takes a piece of plastic from the jar, holds it to the scratches, fiddles with it, fits it in.  He looks up to see, these scratches are in front of the refrigerator.  It looks like they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away from the wall and pushed back at some time. \nINT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- LATER MORNING \nWe are BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR as it is rocked back and forth. It's pulled away from the wall.  Somerset and Mills strain, pull a few more feet, then release.  They lean to look -- \nThe refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust has been cleared.  In that space: a circle, smeared in grease, and a note taped in the center of the circle. \nSomerset's BEEPER starts BEEPING.  Mills leans to read: \nMILLS \"Dear Detectives.  Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to the light.\" (looks at Somerset) This is not good. \nSOMERSET Milton. \nMILLS What? \nSOMERSET It's a quote from a book.  Milton's Paradise Lost. \nSomerset takes out his beeper, looks at the LED window.  He looks up at Mills, like they've received very bad news. \n", "test1_true": "A marble hallway.  A DETECTIVE, 50, nervously chewing his nails, quickly leads Mills and Somerset past cops and forensics. \nDETECTIVE I said to myself, I'm not going to screw around with this.  Nope.  Fuck that. It's still pretty fresh meat.  I called the medical examiner... he's coming. (stops at door) When I got to it, I knew.  As soon as I laid eyes on it, I knew... \nThe detective opens the door.  FOLLOW Somerset and Mills -- \nINT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING \nGross, deep yellow light comes through the only window with its blinds up.  The light anoints a NUDE MAN displayed, dead. \nDETECTIVE (O.S.) ...this is your guy who did this. \nThe nude dead man's legs are folded under him as if he were kneeling, and he's bent forward, chin on the floor.  His eyes are open, his arms outstretched before him.  Mills and Somerset walk to either side of the man. \nThe detective closes the door, bites his thumbnail.  The apartment is on a high floor, so it's quiet. \nSomerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow gel, stapled in place to produce the colored light. \nMills examines the corpse.  There's a chair one foot behind the nude man.  It's an elegant leather chair, drenched in blood. There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge stain of blood under the chair.  Mills looks at pieces of cut rope on the floor behind the chair.  The rope is knotted. \nSomerset crouches beside the body.  There's a big piece of flesh missing from the man's left side, as if the love-handle had been lopped off.  Hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around the man.  The man's hands are palms up, fingers wrapped around more pennies. \nMills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the corpse and the doorway.  It's an old-fashioned counter-balance scale with two suspended dishes on a see-saw arm.  In the high dish: the hunk of flesh missing from the man's side.  In the low dish: a one pound counterweight. \nMILLS (to Somerset) A pound of flesh. \nSomerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene from near the door. \nHe looks worried, vaguely frightened.  He turns his head, looks to a far wall.  Beside a big, abstract, constructivist painting, there's a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood. \nINT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING \nAn office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is meticulously well kept.  The CAPTAIN, 50, sits at his tidy desk. He's dressed conservatively.  Mills and Somerset sit before him. Somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found. \nSOMERSET (reading) \"One pound of flesh, no more no less. No cartilage, no bone, but only flesh. This task done, and he would go free.\" \nThe captain is a calm man, but whenever not speaking, without fail, he clenches his jaw repeatedly, causing the muscles in his neck and jaw to pulse. \nSomerset stands, paces. \nSOMERSET (CONT) This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down nude, holding a carving knife.  And he was given a long time... to decide. Where to make the first cut?  There's a gun to your head... but, what part or parts of your body are expendable? \nMills sits back in his chair, arms crossed, seems anxious, doesn't know why they're here. \nSOMERSET (CONT) Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at once, his love handle.  But, he went into shock.  Bled to death. \nCAPTAIN What is the point, Somerset? \nSOMERSET Look at both killings together.  This murderer is an artist. \nCAPTAIN An artist? \nSOMERSET He uses colors and symbols.  He positions the bodies after death, so he's working with composition.  It's been premeditated so meticulously... and this is just the beginning. \nCAPTAIN Wrong.  For all we know, we might never hear from him again, and I don't want that kind of talk floating around. \nSomerset shakes his head \"no.\" \nSOMERSET The rats and the pennies.  The circle and the triangle on the wall.  There's something about them... these murders mean something. \nCAPTAIN So?  What? \nSomerset has no answer.  The captain is irked, jaw clenching. \nCAPTAIN (CONT) (to Mills) You with him, or you just here to watch? \nMILLS This is his stuff, captain.  I've been out in the cold most of the day. \nCAPTAIN (to Somerset) Always working overtime up in that big brain of yours, huh?  Always cooking. \nSOMERSET I need you to know... I want us reassigned.  We're declining this case. \nMILLS (sits up, angry) What?! \nCAPTAIN What the hell are you talking about? \nSOMERSET This cannot be my last duty here.  It's going to go on and on. \nCAPTAIN You've left unfinished business before. \nSOMERSET Everything else was taken as close to a conclusion as humanly possible. \nMILLS Can I just say something? \nSOMERSET Also... I don't think this should be Mills' first case. \nMILLS This is not my first case, fuckhead! \nCAPTAIN I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset.  And nobody's going to swap with you. \nMILLS Give it to me, then.  There's nothing that says I have to fly with him. \nThe captain considers this. \nMILLS (CONT) If Somerset wants out, fuck him. \nSOMERSET It would be too much for him, too soon. \nMILLS (to captain) Could we talk about this in private? \nThe captain looks at Somerset, then at Mills. \nCAPTAIN That's not necessary.  You're in. \nMILLS Thank you, sir. \nCAPTAIN Start picking up the pieces.  I'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner. \n", "test2_input": "Mills enters, tormented, weary.  He stands in the projector's bright beam, holds an 8\" by 10\" print. \nMILLS (O.S.) Somerset, we had him.  Goddamn it. \nHe hands a press pass and the photo to Somerset. \nMILLS (CONT) The pass is a fake... we had him. \nSomerset looks at the photo, a picture of Mills and Somerset on the stairwell of the slum apartment building; the picture John took when he posed as a reporter. \nMILLS (CONT) We were that close to him. \nSOMERSET I know. \nSomerset motions to the huge canvas.  Mills looks: \nThe painting is frightening collage, thick with paint.  The photo of Mills and Somerset has been incorporated in bits and pieces.  Duplicate images: enlarged eyes, hands, faces.  The faces have been ripped, scratched, mutilated.  Grainy eyes with holes jabbed in them are mounted in paint beside chopped broken arms.  Mills' head is on Somerset's body, and vice versa.  It's like a sick, fragmented vision of a slaughter house floor. \nEXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT \nA block of burnt-out row homes and warehouses.  Stray, wild dogs roam in a pack.  A car turns down this street.  It's John Doe's car, moving fast.  Its headlights go out and it cruises, avoiding garbage cans in the street. \nFOLLOW the dark car.  Ahead, a few blocks away, we can see the only lights in this neighborhood, the flashing reds, whites and blues of police activity. \nINT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT \nJohn Doe brings the car to a stop.  He watches the police at work around the abandoned church.  He gives no discernable reaction, puts the car in reverse.  He looks behind as he drives back the way he came. \nINT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nThe refrigerator door is open.  A male forensic uses tongs to remove Zero's severed hand from behind soda cans and mayonnaise. \nINT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT \nThe forensic walks through with the hand in a clear plastic bag, past a FEMALE SKETCH ARTIST who puts the finishing touches on a fairly accurate drawing of the balding John Doe. \nSKETCH ARTIST This is the guy? \nMills stands over the artist.  Sarah, Billy and two deputy detectives are at work in the room, photographing, searching. \nMILLS Make sure it gets around. \nSKETCH ARTIST You got it.  Tomorrow morning, this city's good citizens will be on the lookout for Elmer Fudd. \nSARAH (to Mills) We can't find anything to hang onto.  No pay-stubs, no appointment books or calendars.  Not even a book of phone numbers.  And, you're not going to believe this... \nMILLS Keep looking. \nSARA It's just... we haven't found any fingerprints yet.  Not one. \nMILLS You know, you're right.  I don't believe it.  Keep looking. \nINT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT \nSomerset reads one of Doe's notebooks.  Three cops are looking through other notebooks from the shelves.  Mills enters. \nSOMERSET We need to put more men on this. \nMILLS I'm working on it, alright.  What have we got. \nSomerset bristles slightly at Mills' abrupt demeanor. \nSOMERSET We've got about five thousand notebooks in this room.  And, as near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages. \nMILLS Then, he must write about the murders. \nSomerset looks at the notebook, reads. \nSOMERSET \"What sick, silly puppets we are, and what a gross stage we dance on.  What fun we have, dancing around, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what God intended.\" (turns pages) \"On the subway today, a man came up to start a conversation.  He was making small talk, this lonely man, talking about the weather and other things.  I tried to be accommodating, but my head began to hurt from his banality.  I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I threw up all over him.  And I couldn't stop myself from laughing.\" (closes book) No dates indicated.  They're placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  He describes a scab on his arm for five pages, then writes about existential philosophy on the next. \nMills walks.  He looks into the adjoining paint room. \nSOMERSET (CONT) It's just his mind poured out on paper. \nMills leans in the doorway, looking at Doe's strange artworks. \nMILLS You were right.  He is preaching. \nThe PHONE RINGS in the other room. \nINT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT \nAll attention is focused on the phone on Doe's desk.  A tape recorder is rigged to the receiver.  Mills and Somerset enter. Mills walks over, pushes a button on the recorder, picks up. \nMILLS (into phone) Hello... hello? \nJOHN DOE (V.O.) (from recorder) I admire you, David.  Imagine my surprise on finding you at my doorstep. I admire you more and more every day. \nMILLS (into phone) Okay, John.  Let's... \nJOHN DOE (V.O.) (from recorder) No, no, no!  You listen and don't talk. I suppose you found the painting and the photos.  This is just as well.  Now we all know we've all seen each other. (pause) I mean what I say.  I do admire you. \nLong pause.  Mills waits. \nJOHN DOE (V.O.,CONT) Oh, there is one other thing.  Fourteen hundred thirty.  West Eighty-sixth street.  Apartment six-o-four. \nJohn Doe hangs up. \nINT.  APARTMENT 604, BATHROOM -- NIGHT \nSomerset looks around this femininely decorated bathroom. \nIn the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle of anesthetic for use with the needle, a straight razor. \nSomerset moves from the sink, looks in the bathtub.  The tub and shower walls are splattered with blood.  The tub has a few inches of water in it.  The water is cloudy red and bits of gauze float in it.  Somerset jiggles the drain's knob. \nSome bubbles pop up from the clogged drain. \n", "test2_true": "Mills is in a dark mood.  He and Dr. O'Neill stand by a WOMAN who hangs by a noose from the ceiling.  The woman's head has been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape.  Her eyes have been left uncovered.  The gauze is stained red in small spots. \nThe woman hangs low, so her feet are inches from the floor where piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay.  There's a chair knocked over behind her. \nO'Neill's going through his black bag.  A violet, velvet curtain has been draped on the wall in the corner, behind a full length mirror.  The mirror reflects the corpse.  A seven-pointed star is smeared in lipstick on the mirror's surface, with the words I DID NOT KILL HER, SHE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE below. \nSomerset enters from the bathroom, looks at the murder display. \nMILLS Pride.  Just like in the painting. \nSomerset nods.  He walks to a dresser.  The woman's purse sits open and Somerset extracts her driver's license.  He looks at the photo.  The woman in the picture is beautiful. \nSOMERSET You can see what he did. \nO'Neill steps up to the woman.  He brandishes dull scissors. The captain enters with two uniform cops.  He looks around, grim, clenching his jaw. \nMILLS Cut her up... dressed the wounds.  He put the noose around her neck and stood her on the chair. \nSOMERSET She had the telephone. \nMILLS Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be mutilated. \nSOMERSET Or, kick out the chair, and spare yourself a lifetime of hideousness. \nO'Neill's cutting the bandages on the woman's face.  He pulls them away in front.  Mills looks, disgusted by the sight. \nSomerset sits in a chair, runs his fingers through his hair. \nO'NEILL He cut off her nose to spite her face. And he did it very recently. \nCAPTAIN Alright, boys, you're running on empty. Go home.  Just make sure you sleep with the phone between your knees. \nINT.  BOOKSTORE -- NIGHT \nThe bookstore is a labyrinth.  Tables and shelves, mountains and valleys of books.  Books, new and used, hard and soft, in disorganized groups.  CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS.  A few customers search for titles. \nSomerset walks, downcast, winds out of one aisle into another. he has his jacket over his shoulder, runs his fingers along the books as he goes.  He pulls one book, The Merchant of Venice, looks at it, replaces it.  He looks down the aisle and is surprised to see Tracy. \nTracy stands solemn, scanning book spines.  Somerset approaches. \nSOMERSET Tracy? \nTracy brightens a bit upon recognizing him. \nTRACY Somerset.  How are you? \nSOMERSET I'm alright.  I'm glad to see you found this place.  I almost should have expected to run into you here, knowing that you teach English. \nTracy looks up and around. \nTRACY It's so huge.  It's amazing. \nSOMERSET This is why I moved into this neighborhood. \nTRACY Don't you love the smell of all the old books.  It smells like... like... I guess just old books, but, I love it. \nSomerset notices Tracy noticing his gun. \nTRACY (CONT) Forgive me.  No matter how often I see guns, I can't get used to them. \nSOMERSET Same here. \nTracy laughs.  She looks at her watch. \nTRACY If David's going to be back home soon, I should get back. \nShe starts down the aisle and Somerset walks with her. \nTRACY (CONT) I hope you'll come to dinner another night.  Before you leave. \nSOMERSET You can stay and browse a little longer, can't you?  I mean... \nTracy considers this as they enter an open area. \nSOMERSET (CONT) I... I hardly know anyone I can talk about books with anymore.  I'd appreciate the company. \nTracy stops.  Somerset looks hopeful.  Tracy is very tempted. \nINT.  BOOKSTORE -- LATER NIGHT \nShelves and empty aisles of books.  CLASSICAL MUSIC still PLAYS. \nSOMERSET (O.S.) The irony is, that after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  Murders in the Rue Morgue. \nMOVE TO the aisle marked MYSTERY, where Somerset and Tracy are leaning against shelves.  They both hold books they've selected. \nSOMERSET (CONT) My mother would give him hell... because I was young, and he was keeping me up till all hours, giving me nightmares. \nTRACY Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. \nSOMERSET One birthday, he gave me a hardcover book called The Century of the Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of detection as a science and it sealed my fate.  Because it was real, and that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... was incredible to me. \nA CLERK looks down the aisle, then walks on. \nCLERK (O.S.) We're closing up, Somerset. \nSOMERSET Okay, thanks. \nTRACY David's going to wonder where I am. \nSOMERSET I'll give you a ride. \nTRACY No.  Please, don't bother. \nSOMERSET I have to insist.  If your husband found out I let you ride the subway at this hour he'd tear my head off. \nThey make their way out of the aisle.  Somerset chuckles. \n", "test3_input": "Somerset leaps out, takes out his gun.  FOLLOW as he runs into the junk-yard as fast as he can. \nMILLS (V.O.) (from receiver) I'm going in! \nINT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT \nThe chopper's over the river.  California listens intently. \nMILLS (V.O.) (from headset) I have to go in after him! \nSTATIC CRACKLES LOUD in his headset, then it GOES DEAD. California grips his mouthpiece. \nCALIFORNIA Somerset, what's going on down there?! \nINT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWAY -- NIGHT \nAn underground pipe-way.  Mills tries to swim, is mostly carried in the flow.  He's battered against the sides of the pipe, holding his breath desperately. \nEXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT \nFOLLOW Somerset as he charges onwards through the junk-yard, stumbling over pieces of metal.  He runs towards the alleyway. \nINT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT \nWATER ROARS.  A square pool of water churns.  A moment, then Mills rises, gasping, choking.  He's disoriented, furious, waving his gun, expecting Doe to be right on top of him. \nNo one around.  Mills looks.  This is some sort of unmanned water switching station.  the walls are covered in catwalks, drainage pipes and tunnels.  Some tunnels and pipes spew water down into the central pool, others are sealed shut. \nMills pulls himself from the central pool to a concrete spillway.  He stands up, searching.  Doe could be anywhere. \nMILLS Come on, Johnny!  I'm right here! \nINT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS TUNNEL -- NIGHT \nThere is a plastic bag with an automatic pistol and extra clip inside hanging from a protruding shut-off valve.  John Doe's hands tear the bag open, taking the contents. \nEXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT \nSomerset enters the alley, short of breath.  He points his gun in front of him, fearful.  Moving slowly. \nSOMERSET Mills! \nINT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT \nCalifornia is enraged, looks towards the pilot. \nCALIFORNIA God damn it!  Let's do something! \nPILOT Somerset said wait! \nCALIFORNIA Fuck that!  Let's go! \nPILOT Where? \nCALIFORNIA I don't know!  Just go! \nINT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT \nMills climbs onto a catwalk.  He passes tunnels, looking down each, intense, ready to kill.  A waterfall flows and over the other end of the catwalk. \nMills stands, looking over the railing at the central pool and other tunnels.  He points his gun and fires into a far tunnel. \nMILLS Come on!  Let's do it!  You and me! \nA figure appears in the center of the waterfall behind Mills. \nMILLS (CONT) I'm not going to let you win this! \nJohn Doe steps out of the waterfall, putting on his glasses. \nHe seems calm, unloads his gun into Mills' back... BLAM, BLAM... \nMills twists, blown forward by the bullets slamming into his bullet-proof vest.  BLAM, BLAM, BLAM... he stumbles, trying to turn and fire back, but bullets strike him down and he falls to the floor of the catwalk, gun falling from his hand. \nCLICK.  Doe's gun is empty.  The gunshots echo.  Mills lays there on his stomach, pounded, blacking out, the hot bullets in his vest smoking and sizzling from the water splashing them. \nDoe moves quickly, starts searching Mills' pockets. \nEXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT \nSomerset comes upon the open manhole.  Water rushes by. \nSOMERSET Christ. \nINT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT \nThe central pool bubbles, undulating.  Somerset surfaces, inhaling, bringing his gun up.  He looks.  No one in sight. \nSOMERSET Mills!  Pull out! \nHis voice reverberates, barely heard against the roaring water. he swims to the edge, climbs out.  He walks, looking... \nSOMERSET (CONT) (pleading) Pull out now! \nSomerset looks up, and freezes up on seeing -- \n-- Doe's handcuffs hang, swinging, on the rail of the catwalk above, with Mills' radio transmitter and wire tied to them. \nEXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT \nSomerset runs to his car, driven, gasping for breath, still soaking wet.  He stops for one second, looks. \nNot too far away, the police helicopter flies low to the ground, turning in wide circles. \nSomerset climbs into the car, starts it up.  He drives away, leaving his lights off.  The engine protests loudly, forced to its limit.  The car disappears in darkness. \nThe police helicopter circles, useless. \n", "test3_true": "The church stands elegant at night, when its decayed state is partially hidden.  Small shafts of light escape from holes in the facade and just into the blackness. \nSomerset is out of his car.  He strides towards the church, checks his gun as he goes.  FOLLOW with him, getting closer to the church.  He climbs the stairs. \nSomerset steps up and kicks the church doors open, met by a tremendous blast of light -- \nINT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT \nFlickering orange light from hundreds of once tall orange candles, now burnt low.  They greet Somerset, in the church's old candle racks, on the floor, on the altar and all through out the pews. \nSomerset's eyes try to adjust to the light.  He holds his gun ready, walks down the long center aisle. \nJOHN DOE (O.S.) Hello, Somerset. \nDoe sounds far, his voice echoing from the front of the church. \nSOMERSET Where's David? \nJOHN DOE (O.S.) He's here.  With me. \nSOMERSET Tell me what you want. \nSomerset can see through the heat warp.  Doe stands facing him from the altar. \nJOHN DOE What do I want?  The same you... I want an ending.  Stay where you are.  Put your gun on the floor and slide it all the way down here. \nSomerset obeys, bends, slides the gun down the aisle till it hits the bottom altar stair.  He keeps walking, slowly. \nSOMERSET I want to see him.  Show me Mills. \nOn the altar, Doe is sweating hard, standing over Mills.  Mills is slumped forward on the floor, unconscious.  His bullet-proof vest has been removed. \nMills' hands are tied tight together in front of him, tied to one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling.  Doe holds the other end of the rope, has his gun tucked under his belt. \nJOHN DOE You're an intelligent man, Somerset. You understand what you're a part of, don't you?  When this is finished, it will seem surreal, but it will be a whole, crystalline reality.  And, no one will be able to deny it, no matter how hard they try. \nDoe's voice is thick with passion.  Somerset is about halfway down the aisle, still moving. \nSOMERSET You're a murderer.  That's all.  The only way you've distinguished yourself is by your particular brutality. \nDoe walks across the altar. \nJOHN DOE You know that's not true.  You know. \nSOMERSET You're killing innocent people, and I should admire you?  You're doing it because it gives you pleasure.  That's the only purpose... your sick pleasure. \nDoe picks up a container of gasoline, looks out at Somerset. \nJOHN DOE Stay where you are! \nSomerset stops. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) I won't deny my personal desires.  I won't. \nDoe begins dousing Mills with gasoline, covering Mills' body and clothing.  Mills stirs, coming to.  He coughs, choking on the gas and fumes. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) But, I don't mourn the victims in this any more than I mourn the thousands who died in Sodom and Gomorrah. \nSomerset looks fearful.  He starts approaching again. \nSOMERSET All you've done is cause more misery and pain!  You've given people all the more reason to believe there is no God! \nSomerset eyes his gun at the bottom of the stairs. \nDoe sees Somerset moving, throws the gas can away, takes out his gun.  Doe walks to the edge of the altar, all the time holding his end of the rope. \nJOHN DOE Stop! \nSomerset is twitching with anger, looking at the gun about fifteen feet in front of him. \nMills manages to look up, weak, his eyes barely able to open because of the stinging gasoline. \nMILLS Somerset? \nDoe takes one step down off the altar.  Somerset is still edging forward, hands out away from his body. \nSOMERSET Do you really think I'm just going to let this happen?!  You think I'm going to let him die? \nJOHN DOE Yes. \nDoe fires his gun and the bullet slams into the front of Somerset's bullet-proof vest.  Somerset flies back, knocking over a rack of candles on his way to the floor. \nDoe walks quickly back onto the altar. \nMILLS Motherfucker! \nMills tries to grab at Doe as he passes, but Doe turns and kicks Mills in the ribs.  Mills cringes in pain. \nSomerset lays in the aisle, on his stomach, gasping.  He can't catch his breath, his twisted face pressed against the floor. \nJOHN DOE How can you speak of God, Somerset? When was the last time you spoke His name? \nMills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands. \nHis mind works feverishly.  He looks around to see where he is, then he searches the floor.  We can see, inside his open shirt, the bleeding, upside-down cross Doe has cut into his chest. \nDoe walks back to shout angrily down at Somerset. \nJOHN DOE (CONT) When did you last speak His name?  Was it in prayer?  Or, did you say the Lord's name after you stubbed your big toe?

SKAT Perhaps you'll take a bribe. 
DEATH saws. 
SKAT Help! 
DEATH saws. 
SKAT Help! Help! 
The tree falls. The forest becomes silent again. 
Night and then dawn. 
The travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss. They lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the wind in the tree tops. Here the forest is wild and impenetrable. Huge boulders stick up out of the ground like the heads of black giants. A fallen tree lies like a mighty barrier between light and shadow. 
MIA, JOF and their child have sat down apart from the others. They look at the light of the moon, which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and unstable. The KNIGHT sits bent over his chess game. LISA cries quietly behind PLOG'S back. JONS lies on the ground and looks up at the heavens. 
JONS Soon dawn will come, but the heat continues to hang over us like a smothering blanket. 
LISA I'm so frightened. 
PLOG We feel that something is going to happen to us, but we don't know what. 
JONS Maybe it's the day of judgment. 
PLOG The day of judgment ... 
Now, something moves behind the fallen tree. There is a rustling sound and a moaning cry that seems to come from a wounded animal. Everyone listens intently, all faces turned towards the sound. A voice comes out of the darkness. 
RAVAL Do you have some water? 
RAVAL'S perspiring face soon becomes visible. He disappears in the darkness, but his voice is heard again. 
RAVAL Can't you give me a little water? (pause) I have the plague. 
JONS Don't come here. If you do I'll slit your throat. Keep to the other side of the tree. 
RAVEL I'm afraid of death. 
No one answers. There is complete silence. RAVAL gasps heavily for air. The dry leaves rustle with his movements. 
RAVEL I don't want to die! I don't want to!

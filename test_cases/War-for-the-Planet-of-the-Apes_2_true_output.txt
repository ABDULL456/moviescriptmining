EXT. DESERTED R.V. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON 
Caesar and Rocket mount their horses as Luca arrives with the others. Maurice is about to climb up when he notices -- 
The Girl has followed them out. She wanders toward the dead Man, his gun still a few feet away. She stares at him, looking lost, but not quite sad. Instead she exhibits a strange, almost primitive fascination with his lifeless body. 
They all gaze at her, uncertain.   Maurice turns to Caesar: 
MAURICE [She'll die out here alone.] 
Caesar looks at her, a flash of pity in his eyes... but he pushes it away, turns to Maurice, firm: 
CAESAR We cannot take her. 
Maurice considers this, nods. 
MAURICE [I understand...] (then:) [But I cannot leave her.] 
Caesar stares at him, frustrated... 
EXT. WOODS - DUSK 
The posse on the move again. The Girl rides behind Maurice, arms around him, her cheek pressed into his furry back. Caesar takes in the sight, shoots Maurice a hard look... Maurice returns an assuring nod: it'll be okay. 
Just then, Luca GRUNTS for their attention. They all turn to see CROSSES UP AHEAD ON THE SIDE OF THE TRAIL, crudely-bound branches staked into the ground. They approach warily, stopping as they discover -- 
A LARGE GRAVEYARD amidst the trees. A sea of crosses, marking mounds of dirt. They peer around, a bit unnerved: 
MAURICE [Must be where they bury the dead.] 
Rocket nods, when Caesar suddenly notices the TREE TRUNKS are scarred with BULLET HOLES... He glances at the ground, finding scattered BRASS BULLET CASINGS; perplexed, he points: 
CAESAR Looks like some were killed here. 
They all look at the shot-up trees and casings, bewildered -- when Luca sees a pile of ASHES and CHARRED OBJECTS -- BLACKENED EYEGLASSES, BELT BUCKLES, DOG TAGS -- 
LUCA [They burned their things too.] 
MAURICE [Why would they kill their own men?] 
ON CAESAR, mulling the mystery -- when Luca lets out another GRUNT; they turn as he points through the trees at pinpricks of FIRE LIGHT and TENTS in the distance. It's the base camp. 
Caesar tenses in grim anticipation -- 
CUT TO: 
A POV THROUGH HIGH-POWERED BINOCULARS 
SEARCHING the FIELD OF TENTS in the blue twilight. We FIND a huge "A" stencilled on the side of one of them. Re-focus on HAND-PAINTED SIGNAGE beside it: "Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it." Next to it: "The only good Kong is a dead Kong." An eerie, almost cult-like atmosphere. 
REVEAL CAESAR 
crouched in brush, spying through the binoculars scavenged from the Airstream. Luca and Rocket are pressed beside him. 
CAESAR'S POV 
A PAIR OF TURNCOAT APES walk into view -- the binoculars follow them as they cross to an area where LARGE GROUPS OF SOLDIERS are gathered around CAMP FIRES; as the apes begin dutifully pouring drink into the humans' cups, one turns toward us -- we recognize him as RED. 
The apes watch Caesar peering; when suddenly his expression hardens. He slowly lowers the glasses, anger burning... 
LUCA [Did you find the Colonel...?] 
Caesar just hands the binoculars to Luca, who lifts them -- 
LUCA'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS 
Beside Red, the OTHER APE HAS TURNED TOWARD US, serving the humans... As Luca FOCUSES, we recognize him, as Caesar whispers his name ominously: 
CAESAR Winter... 
EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 
We're inside the human camp now. Red and Winter quietly ladle stew from a bucket to Soldiers sitting around the fire. 
A volatile soldier with tortured eyes (BOYLE) calls out in a low, menacing voice to Winter: 
BOYLE Donkey.   Over here. 
Winter hesitates, flustered -- Red notices, immediately intercedes, anxiously trying to placate Boyle -- 
RED Ok -- Ok... He come... 
He nods at Winter to hurry over; he does. Boyle holds out his bowl. Winter takes it, filling it quickly -- some stew spills on Boyle's boot -- 
BOYLE Hey!   Hey!     You stupid-- ! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
WHAP! as Boyle KICKS the bowl right out of Winter's hand -- and Winter reacts with an instinctive SNARL! Boyle grabs his gun, points it right at him. Winter FREEZES -- then: 
A VOICE (O.S.) Come on, Boyle... 
Boyle turns to see PREACHER, the fresh-faced kid, beside him.

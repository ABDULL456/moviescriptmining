JULIA I thought half of it was your brother's? 
LARRY He won't complain.  He can pay off some of his creditors. 
LARRY is getting more enthusiastic about the place by the moment.  He leaves the room, moving past JULIA to explore further. 
LARRY You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it.  She'll love it. 
JULIA You mean we're moving in? 
LARRY pauses.  Looks at her. 
LARRY You don't like it? 
JULIA shrugs. 
JULIA It's better than Brooklyn. 
She turns back down the hallway. He watches her, then follows. 
LARRY You're still blaming me. 
JULIA No.  I'm not. 
LARRY You wanted to come back to London.  We came back. 
We are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens of times, which immediately annoys them both. 
JULIA All right. 
LARRY So what's the argument? 
JULIA (cold) No argument. 
LARRY Oh Christ.  Julia ... 
JULIA wanders back to the bottom of the stairs.  Then starts to climb. 
LARRY (exasperated, to himself) Shit. 
8    INT.   LANDING   DAY 
JULIA climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed feeling.  She's sick of LARRY; his enthusiasm depresses her, his compromises anger her.  What's between them is stale, like this house. 
9    INT.    TORTURE ROOM   DAY 
The door opens a fraction. 
10   INT.   KITCHEN    DAY 
LARRY has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence, now rotted and fungal.  It smells, to judge the expression on his face.  It also puzzles him. Then, from above: 
JULIA Larry! 
He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom of the stairs. 
Larry! 
LARRY I hear you. 
He starts up the stairs. 
11   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY 
LARRY reaches the top of the stairs. 
LARRY Where are you? 
JULIA (out of sight) In here. 
LARRY follows JULIA's voice to the end of the corridor. JULIA is standing in a doorway.  Beyond, the 'bedroom' we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then. 
JULIA Squatters? 
LARRY steps past her, and throws back the blankets. Wood-lice scurry away.  He goes to the suitcase, and starts looking through it.  Besides clothes there's a lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets; Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from a dozen countries.  Amongst the stuff, some photographs. LARRY peers at them.  One pictures a good-looking intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed with a naked Chinese girl. 
LARRY Frank. 
At the door, we see JULIA almost flinch at the name.

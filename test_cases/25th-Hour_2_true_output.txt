o     He leads Doyle away, but stops after a few feet and turns back. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Marvin Ray? 
.ADMINISTRATOR 
Mm hm. 
MONTY 
You're sure? 
ADMINISTRATOR 
I was there when he broke the record. Monty nods and continues on his way. The administrator watches man and dog walk down the long corridor. 
INT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER CLASSROOM 
JAKOB ELINSKY stands at the blackboard, facing three rows of uninspired teenage faces. He wears a tweed jacket that seems a few sizes too large, with chalk stains on the sleeves. Jakob is the same age as Monty but he seems younger. There is something adolescent in his slouch, in the way he chews his lip. One of his students, MARY D'ANNUNZIO (17), stands at her desk, reading from a poetry textbook. Her eyes drown in pools of painted shadow, her hair is dyed black, tattooed roses garland her wrist. 
MARY 
-«=·-------···: .·    (reading)      - ··     --    ··· 
"Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball, And tear pur pleasures with rough strife, Through the iron gates of life." Jakob watches her. We don't know the Campbell-Sawyer dress code, but we can guess that she's violating it . We can also guess that Jakob is watching her a little too avidly. Her pierced navel is visible below her Donnas tee-shirt. 
MARY (CONT'D) 
(reading) "Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run." Mary shrugs and sits down.

JAKOB 
Good, good, excellent reading. Urn, okay, so. What do people think? What' s going on here? 
Nobody says anything. Jakob nods . 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Okay. 
LUKE , a sullen-looking student with a shaved head and a failed goatee, raises his hand. 
JAKOB (CONT'D) 
Luke? 
LUKE 
Can I go to the bathroom? 
JAKOB 
No . You went twenty minutes ago . 
LUKE 
I have a bladder infection. 
JAKOB 
The poem. The poem, folks. Hello? 
MARY 
It's not real deep or anything. The guy wants to get laid and he's telling her to give it up . A few of the students titter half-heartedly. 
A knock on the door releases Jakob from his hell . He goes to answer it and then "stops/ startled.                      ~"~ It's the type ofdoo r popular in school buildings> with a wire-reinforced glass panel at head height , allowing you to look into the classroom without disturbing anyone. 
Doyle, tongue dangling from his mouth , stares back at Jakob through the panel . 
MARY (CONT'D) 
I didn't know your mother was coming today, Luke . 
LUKE 
o Eat me . 
Jakob opens the door .

Mont y stands there, holding up Doyle. Doyle scramble s out of hi s arms and jumps on Jakob , nearly knocking th e teache r down , getting his dirty paw s all over Jakob's jacket . 
MONT Y 
Easy, Doyle. Doyle immediately calms down , squatting by Jakob' s feet and staring up at the teacher . 
JAKOB 
Hey -- uh , what' s going on? Jakob seems awkward around Monty , nervous . 
MONT Y 
(looking at Doyle) Look at him . He loves you. Jakob looks at Doyle, wh o wag s the stump of hi s tail . 
MONT Y (CONT'D) 
He really love s you . So what are you doing? Jakob turns to look at hi s class , who all stare at Mont y and the dog. For the first time today, they're quiet . 
JAKOB 
(to Monty ) Teaching m y class , I guess. 
MONT Y 
Cool . ffco class)         "      ···

BANDIT LEADER Yeah, that's what they all say. How about you take it off real slow and tip it out so's we can take a look? 
BANDIT #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack. 
BANDIT #2 He's got a gun. 
BANDIT LEADER Shit, it ain't loaded. They never are. Ain't that right, old man? (BEAT) Open the fucking pack or die. 
ELI I can't do that. 
The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten. 
BANDIT LEADER Want us to do it for you? We can get it off real easy after we've hacked your fucking arms off. 
Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft, even tone, there is something formidable about his voice. 
ELI It's real important you boys listen to me and understand. The man I work for, you do not want to cross him. See, I'm under his protection. You stand in my way, you stand in his. And he will cut you down with a righteous fury - through me. For I am his faithful instrument. 
BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously. 
BANDIT LEADER What the hell are you, some kinda preacher? 
ELI Something like that. 
BANDIT LEADER Well I got news for you, preacher man. Whatever kinda God you reckon yourself to be working for, he left these parts a long time ago. He ain't here to protect your ass. Now take off the pack and set it on the ground. 
Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder. 
BANDIT LEADER You fucking listening to me? 
ELI I hear you. You lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back. 
The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how it's supposed to go. 
BANDIT LEADER All right, I had just about enough of this shit... 
He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack. 
If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and drips onto the asphalt. 
Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood. 
Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror. 
BANDIT LEADER What... you just... he just cut my fucking hand off! My fucking hand! 
Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused. 
BANDIT LEADER What you standin' around for? Kiss him! 
BANDIT #3 What's he talkin' about, kiss him? 
ELI He's in shock. He means "kill him". 
A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing. 
Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill. 
It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt. 
The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach. 
ELI I told you you wouldn't be getting that back. 
Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world. 
BANDIT LEADER Who are you? 
ELI My name is Eli. 
And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword. 
He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing. She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next. 
He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart. 
ELI Take it and go on your way. And don't fall in with men like these again. No good can come. 
She looks at him, puzzled. 
YOUNG WOMAN Why are you doing this? 
Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches beside them and begins searching their bodies. 
He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.

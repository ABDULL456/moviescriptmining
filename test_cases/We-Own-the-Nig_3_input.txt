SIRENS. A GUN BATTLE. The LOOKOUT with the AK-47 is hit-- fatally. Bobby SEES several people FLEEING out a back entrance toward another section of the weeds. Joseph remains in the grass, his head down, his hands on his head. We cannot SEE his face... 
INT. ABANDONED BATHROOM STRUCTURE 
Vadim Nezhinski is frazzled by the approaching FORCE he sees through the window. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Moving with tremendous speed, he begins to light the FURS on FIRE... SMOKE... Vadim BEGINS TO COUGH, taking a suitcase of money with him. He backs out of the STRUCTURE. 
EXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD 
BILIOUS CLOUDS OF SMOKE.     BOBBY is MOVING TOWARD THE BUILDING. 
VADIM SCURRIES INTO THE WEEDS... THE SMALL STRUCTURE REALLY STARTS TO BURN. It is an odd flame, BLUE and SILENT. 
BOBBY RUNS OFF, into THE WEEDS, following VADIM. ELI CHARGES TOWARD HIS CAR. JACK is RIGHT BEHIND HIM: 
JACK SHAPIRO Stop!   Halt! 
Jack ruthlessly pumps Eli full of bullets, and the man falls down dead. Jack approaches, mercilessly FIRES ANOTHER SHOT into the corpse... 
INT. WEEDS 
The WIND HOWLS... Tall, tawny-colored weeds, marsh. BOBBY moves through the DENSE WEED GROWTH. Pushing his way through the brown plants. 
We HEAR POLICE DOGS. BOBBY starts THRASHING. The CAMERA is HAND-HELD, MOVING TO AND FRO WITH FEROCIOUS and VERTIGINOUS SPEED. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we: 
FLASH CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - IN THE RAIN 
It is Bobby, SEEING, through the WET GLASS: BURT, AS HE IS SHOT. DURING THE CHASE IN THE RAIN. We GO BACK TO: 
EXT. WEEDS 
Bobby raises his shotgun as he RACES THROUGH THE PHRAGMITES GRASS. The WEEDS PART. It is TRICKY. HEAVY BREATHING. BOBBY SEES other MEN running through the weeds, but he can't tell who's who. CONFUSION... 
BOBBY STOPS. FEET CRUSHING THE TWIGS... A GUNSHOT, FROM WHERE, GOD ONLY KNOWS... A RUSH OF IMAGES--SHADOWED FIGURES, OBSCURED BY THE WEEDS, APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR LIKE PHANTOMS... 
BOBBY'S HEARTBEAT THUMPS ON THE SOUNDTRACK... A MAN backing up toward him; each man has his back to the other... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOBBY DOESN'T SEE HIM YET. BUT WE CAN. THE CAMERA ZOOMS INTO BOBBY, WITH THE FIGURE BEHIND HIM. BOBBY SEES THE SHADOW ON THE GROUND. He turns, SLOWLY...raises his weapon, about to FIRE when he realizes: 
It's MICHAEL SOLO, who, in profile to Bobby is unaware he's almost been killed. He stops when he feels the barrel of Bobby's shotgun against his ribs. SLOWLY TURNING AROUND, he sees BOBBY. WHISPERED: 
MICHAEL SOLO This's too dangerous. We'll all wind up killing each other-- 
BOBBY GREEN Vadim is in here with us. Radio our guys, tell `em to get into the clearing. 
ALL OF A SUDDEN, we HEAR, SHOUTED: 
MAN'S VOICE Bobby!   We got the old man! 
Bobby looks at Michael, points to his earpiece. Michael nods, and as we HEAR Mike's words into his radio ("Our guys, outta the brush!") Bobby starts to back up, toward the clearing... 
EXT. CLEARING 
Bobby is greeted by the boys. Other POLICE, including Michael Solo, emerge from the weeds, quietly. Jack APPROACHES: 
JACK SHAPIRO We got the old man--Buzhayev. Up by the cars. His grandkids are safe--they're in the van. 
Bobby acknowledges this, turns to another OFFICER: 
BOBBY GREEN Are all our guys out? 
The Officer looks, counts.     Then nods.   Bobby looks toward the weeds and says: 
BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Burn it. 
SEVERAL COPS BREAK FLARES, ROLLING THEM INTO THE WEEDS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
All the officers back up--all of them except Bobby. Who stands, shotgun in hand, waiting for VADIM NEZHINSKI to emerge from the now-burning brush. 
TWO OTHER MEN come out of the fire, coughing. They are carrying their guns and thus killed by POLICE GUNFIRE. NO SIGHT OF NEZHINSKI AS BOBBY WAITS. AT LAST, HE DECIDES TO GO IN. 
MICHAEL SOLO Bobby?   What're you doin'-- 
BOBBY GREEN I'm not gonna let him get away... 
AS the other POLICE panic around him, Bobby ENTERS THE FIRE... 
INT. FIERY WEEDS 
Bobby walks through the FLAME. It is OTHERWORLDLY. The ORANGE-BLUE, the SMOKE, it all seems to blow from left to right... 
CHAOS of HEAT, SMOKE... We HEAR ONLY THE RUSHING WIND... BOBBY seems INCONCEIVABLY DRIVEN. Methodically stepping forward, past the FIRES, PEERING THROUGH SMOKE. NOTHING... JUST TUFTS OF SMOKE... 
Then he spots an area in which the SMOKE FLOWS UNNATURALLY, AGAINST THE BREEZE, as though it SURGES AROUND SOMETHING... SOMETHING COVERED IN SMOKE, STANDING... 
A GUST OF WIND PASSES--REVEALING--A SILHOUETTED FIGURE, WITH HIS ARM RAISED, POINTING, RIGHT AT BOBBY. 
VADIM NEZHINSKI, POISED TO SHOOT.

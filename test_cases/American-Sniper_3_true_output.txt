CHRIS I'm going to the roof. You stay here and be on the lookout for farm animals. 
48   EXT. ROOFTOP/ SNIPER NEST - DAY                            48 
Under a corrugated piece of steel, a ritual unfolds-- 
Chris packs a dip. He lays out his Bible and flag. Loads bullets in a wrist-sheath. Starts to marshal his breath. 
Time slows as he lowers his eye to the glass. 
(NOTE: we are back to the beginning of the film.) 
CHRIS SCOPE POV 
TRACK ACROSS bombed-out buildings, twisted metal and golden-domed mosques. Ragged curtains flutter out a window. Cat-tails on the river sway the same direction. 
SFX: A LOW FREQUENCY BUZZ escalates over picture as his concentration deepens. Cross-hairs land on-- 
A MAN ON CELL PHONE watches the convoy from a rooftop. 
CHRIS KYLE (keys mike) I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over. 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) If he's reporting troop movement you have a green-light. Your call. Over. 
MAN ON CELL studies the convoy, his hair tossed by wind. CROSS-HAIR push left of target, compensating for windage. 
SFX: Chris takes a deep inhale, holds it, then expels. 
His finger is taking up trigger-slack when MAN ON CELL dips his shoulder, hangs up and steps away. 
CHRIS KYLE (keys mike) He stepped off. 
Chris sucks air. Close. The ambient world floods back in. Barked orders, diesel engines and-- 
A WOMAN AND KID exit the same structure. They're headed up the sidewalk but cut sharply into the street. 
CHRIS KYLE Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, moving toward the convoy. 
(ECU)-- The woman cradles something beneath her robes. 
CHRIS KYLE Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something. 
CROSS-HAIRS ON WOMAN as she pulls a cylindrical object. 
CHRIS KYLE She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid. 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) --you say a woman and kid? 
SFX: his heart-beat, THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP. 
CHRIS KYLE You got eyes on this? Can you confirm? Over. 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) Negative. You know the ROEs. Your call. 
GOAT (OC) They fry you if you're wrong. Send your ass to Leavenworth. 
THE KID moves toward the convoy with the grenade. 
CHRIS KYLE (OC) Fuck-- 
MOTHER motions him to hurry along (ECU)-- her robes flutter, trash blows in the street, the dust off her son's footsteps; all blowing the same direction. 
THE KID sprints toward the Marines. 
IN THE STREET 
YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boots scuffing dirt. 
CLOSE ON CHRIS 
His eyes water with focus, his exhale hisses from tobacco- stained teeth. Breathe it down. He struggles to get calm. SFX: THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-- 
CROSS-HAIRS left of the running target, leading him, compensating for a dozen different considerations as-- 
He pauses upon exhale. The world goes quiet. Landscape pulses with color and focus. He stokes the trigger and-- 
THE BULLET 
Leaps from the barrel. Cracks like a whip. The .300 round hurls forward, glinting as it enters the flesh of-- 
CLOSE ON CHRIS 
He winces, sickened, and struggling to swallow the little piece of him that just died. 
GOAT (OC) -Fuck that was gnarly. 
CHRIS SCOPE POV 
MOTHER flees down sidewalk, robes aflutter. CROSS-HAIRS lead her. BAM. It pocks wall behind her. A round ejects. CROSS-HAIRS swing forward, leads her more. BAM. She runs into scope, reaches center, meets bullet. A red mist. 
GOAT (OC) Shit yeah. Evil bitch! 
COMMANDING OFFICER (OS) Nice shooting, Tex. Helluva call. 
COMPANY COMMANDER (OS) Roger that. Good lookin' out Navy. 
GOAT You hear that?

LAURA LEVIN I was going to call you. There was a problem. During our repatriation procedures, we realized Irka had no passport. 
KATHY So we get her one. Where is she? 
LAURA LEVIN You don't get it. She was trafficked from Belgrade. Her parents were killed in Kosovo. And she has no documentation. No embassy will recognize her. She is a girl without a country. 
KATHY She is a witness for a UN investigation! 
GDA EMPLOYEES peer. An INTERN betrays a twinge of complicity. 
LAURA LEVIN We handed her over to the police a few hours ago. I couldn't keep her. I've already done every favour I could for you. This is not on me. 
KATHY You had no right to do that! 
LAURA LEVIN I had every right. We have a system that works here. You're the one disrupting it. 
Kathy stares at her. Fuming. 
KATHY Where did they take her? 
Laura shrugs. Shaking off guilt has become a necessary habit. 
Just then the door opens. And... TWB 54. 
HALYNA 
Walks in. Disoriented, emotion rising... 
HALYNA (BROKEN ENGLISH) I... look for Laura Levin? 
LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN) That's me. 
Kathy holds her anger, smiling respectfully at Halyna. Laura leads her away. Kathy searches for an answer, her eyes landing on... The Intern. Unrelenting... 
KATHY If you know anything, this is on you. 
INTERN I think the cops leave them somewhere near the border, so that with no papers, the girls have to cross the border illegally. Take the 103 to Visegrad. 
105   INT./EXT. UN SUV - NIGHT                                      105 
Kathy. Speeding down the 103. A two-lane winding road. Seeing... Nothing but the 20 feet her headlights show. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
106   INT./ EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                         106 
Viko steers the Van around a corner. Raya sits in the back. 
107   INT. LAURA LEVIN'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - SAME                 107 
Laura hands an excited Halyna a cup of tea. 
LAURA (RUSSIAN) She'll be back in about an hour. 
108   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SAME                                       108 
Kathy's eyes GLUED on the road, trying to make out a SIGN... 
LANDMINES. Then another sign... VISEGRAD PRAVO. 
Sharp Turn. Onto a GRAVEL ROAD. She brakes. SKIDDING. 
109   INT. POLICE VAN / EXT. SARAJEVO - SAME                        109 
Viko stops at a traffic light. Raya peers out a crack in the van. Seeing... Young WOMEN in the streets. Laughing. TWB 55. 
110   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SAME                                       110 
Kathy slows her car... FLICKERING LIGHTS. She approaches... 
A BORDER STATION: A GRAVEL ROAD leads up to it. Kathy slows. 
BORDER GUARDS smoke and play cards. One guard saunters over. 
KATHY I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped here a few hours ago. 
He shrugs, shaking his head. 
KATHY (CONT'D) Can you check the border logs? She's about 15, the police brought her here but she didn't have a passport. Maybe-- 
GUARD Lady. I know what you're looking for. Those girls do not go through the border. They go through there... 
He points... A THICK Forest. Stretching for MILES. 
GUARD (CONT'D) To Serbia. 
Kathy stares at the endless forest. A dirt road cuts through the middle. She jumps in her SUV, and HURTLES down the road. 
111   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          111 
Viko turns down a narrow street. He glances in his rear view mirror. An old TRABBANT follows him. He veers down an alley. 
112   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           112 
Kathy's SUV crawls alongside the FOREST. HIGHBEAMS off the top of the car. SCANNING all around. Then, in a clearing up ahead...

HARRY Where'd you find this baby? 
LLOYD Used car dealer. I   traded the van for it. Plus I got   the guy to throw in fifty bucks for   gas money. (beat) Come on, man, what   do you say? We still partners? 
HARRY SMILES AND WE 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COLORADO STATE LINE - DAY 
An impatient Detective Dale is still staked-out at the Colorado border with several other officers. 
DT. DALE It doesn't make sense. They should've been here hours ago. 
COP Maybe they're smarter than we thought. 
DT. DALE How smart can they be? They're riving a goddamn dog! 
Another COP rushes over holding his walkie-talkie. 
COP #2 We just got a report that they were spotted about two hours ago heading east near Des Moines on I-80. 
DT. DALE (incredulous) Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred miles from here! 
COP #1 Guess they got wind of our welcoming party. 
DT. DALE We're wasting time. Let's mobilize. 
Dt. Dale heads for his cruiser while the other Cops follow. As the officers climb into their cars, we 
CUT TO: 
INT. HEARSE - DAY 
Lloyd is driving and Harry has his feet out the window. 
LLOYD Tell me something, Harry. Would you really have kept going home if I hadn't come back to get you? 
HARRY Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember that? 
Lloyd thinks hard about this. 
LLOYD We were never Cub Scouts. 
HARRY Exactly. 
Just then several COP CARS whiz by them in the opposite direction with SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING. When Harry glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a COFFIN in the rear of the vehicle. 
HARRY (CONT'D) What the hell is this? There's a coffin in the back! 
LLOYD Relax, it's empty. 
HARRY I don't give a shit. I'm not driving anywhere with a casket. You know I'm superstitious calm down. We'll dump it off first chance we get. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Harry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse. Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is a CADILLAC. 
INT. CADILLAC (LEAD CAR) - DAY 
(This is the car right behind the funeral hearse.) A MAN and a WOMAN are arguing. 
WOMAN I married a cheapskate. 
MAN Shut your trap, Gerdie. 
WOMAN I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be able to show my face again. 
MAN I knew something good would come out of this. 
WOMAN We could have given him a more ignified burial. 
MAN Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember what he got us for our twenty-fifth? A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm gonna spend a load to get him planted. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
While the couple ARGUES ON, Harry and Lloyd cut in front of them. The Man and the Woman on't notice this an soon the ENTIRE FUNERAL PROCESSION IS UNWITTINGLY 
FOLLOWING THE WRONG HEARSE. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY SUPERMARKET - DAY 
Harry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back. Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER AND WIPE THEIR HANDS

As Charlie hands out airline tickets -- 
CHARLIE We travel to L.A. separately. 
LYLE You still haven't told us the most important thing. What exactly is the job, Charlie? And who exactly is she? 
Lyle and Half-Ear have been kept in the dark until now. 
CHARLIE This is Stella Bridger. And we're finishing the job that we started in Italy. 
They're a little stunned at first. 
HALF-EAR Holy shit. It's about time. 
CUT TO: 
MONTAGE - LAX - NIGHT 
The crew deplane from five different airplanes, different air carriers. 
They disperse in separate vehicles. See Charlie at Avis, renting a car. 
See Handsome Rob renting a U-Haul panel truck. 
See Stella on a hotel shuttle bus. 
See Half-Ear on the underground Metro Rail, taking the Red Line. 
See Lyle in a taxi, headed south on Figueroa Street. He notices a YOUNG WOMAN HITCHHIKING. For a moment, their eyes connect. She is a beautiful waif and the feeling sweeps through Lyle: if only... But the taxi passes by. 
Charlie checks into Shutters, with its Victorian beach house feel and oceanfront view. 
Stella's at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills with its opulent lobby. 
Handsome Rob's at the Standard, with its kitschy decor and ironic style. He stares at a huge empty aquarium behind the front desk where a performance artist writhes and a DJ spins out rhythmic throbs. Very L.A. 
Half-Ear's at the new Renaissance Hollywood Hotel adjacent to the dramatic Babylon Gate and the Kodak Theatre. 
And Lyle's at the Downtown Bonaventure, riding up the glass elevator. Perfect gearhead hotel. 
EXT. SHUTTERS HOTEL - BALCONY - SUNSET 
The five of them sit in chairs on the balcony of his hotel room. There's a sweeping view of the Pacific. 
CHARLIE We need an in to get a video blueprint of the interior. We're not going into this place blind. Half-Ear, you take the first surveillance shift. Who goes in, who goes out, levels of security, you know the drill. 
HALF-EAR You got it. 
CHARLIE I also want audio surveillance on his phone. 
LYLE I'll hack into the phone company's central office remote observance monitoring system and fool it into thinking there's a legal tap on the line. Reroute the digital copies of his calls to our own listening post. 
CHARLIE How long? 
LYLE I'll burn through the night, have it up and running before morning. 
CHARLIE (to Handsome Rob) We need to know how long to get from the house to Union Station downtown. 
HANDSOME ROB No problemo. 
CHARLIE Stella. How much time will you need with the safe? 
STELLA I'll have it open in five minutes flat. 
HANDSOME ROB It's not the same as opening a safe for the cops. Your heart will be pounding in your ears. Perspiration on your fingertips. It's a whole different ball game. 
STELLA You get me to the safe, I'll open it. 
Out over the ocean, the sun is in its death throes, bruising the sky a coiling purple and orange. 
EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Nestled at the end of a cul-de-sac on Oporto Drive in the Hollywood Hills. Chrome. Glass. Carved wood. 
EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - MORNING 
The U-Haul panel truck is parked on the side of the road that overlooks Oporto Drive and Steve's house. 
INT. U-HAUL - MORNING 
It's been converted into their surveillance vehicle, the back outfitted with monitors and surveillance equipment.

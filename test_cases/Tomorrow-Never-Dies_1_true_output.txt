DiGIACOMO Signore Harmsway. A thousand apologies. (snaps his fingers to a lackey:) Give him the video tape. 
HARMSWAY Please. No harm done, Don Franco. Go upstairs, and enjoy the reception. 
As the room empties, he calls - 
HARMSWAY Oh - Mr. Bond. One minute. 
Bond approaches him. They're the only people in the room. 
HARMSWAY I hope you've enjoyed this little charade. 
BOND Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours? 
HARMSWAY (icily) A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. (beat) It's deadlier than uranium. 
BOND (staring him down) We'll see about that. 
Harmsway glances at his watch. Smiles coldly. 
HARMSWAY Aren't you late for a meeting? 
EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II/HARBOR - DAY 
Bond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock. Jumps in a gondola. 
BOND The Danielli. Presto! 
RETURN ON THE METALLURGY LAB - 
Harmsway closes the door. Yung is there. 
YUNG That was too close. 
HARMSWAY Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss. 
Harmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards. 
HARMSWAY I'm going to the plane. Tell the captain to set sail at once. 
EXT. THE DANIELLI HOTEL - DAY 
Bond jumps out of the gondola, sprints into the lobby. 
FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - 
Bond appears, rushing up a staircase. He comes to his doorway. It's closed, but unlocked. 
INT. BOND'S HOTEL ROOM - 
Bond enters the room. Looks around, calling out - 
BOND Paris? Paris? 
He sees the French doors open onto the canal. The curtains billowing outward. Bond rushes to the window and looks down: 
EXT. GRAND CANAL - BOND'S POV 
Paris Harmsway is dead, floating in the water. 
RETURN ON BOND - 
Crushed. Devastated. And to make matters worse: 
DiGIACOMO'S VOICE Signore Bond? 
Bond turns. A flashbulb goes off, capturing Bond and DiGiacomo. 
DiGIACOMO You're under arrest. 
CUT TO: 
THE SOUTH CHINA SEA - DUSK 
The HMS INDOMITABLE - a 3,300 ton British frigate, surges through the water, heading toward the setting sun. 
CLOSER - 
BATTLE-DRESSED ROYAL MARINES patrol the deck; GUNNERY CREWS man the weapons. Whatever is going on here, it's not business as usual.' 
INT. BRIDGE - DUSK 
Close on A VERTICAL GLASS MAP. An electronic panel display with a BLINKING YELLOW DOT indicates - 
NAVIGATOR We've cleared Hong Kong harbor, sir. 
THE CAPTAIN nods. Turns to the GPS OFFICER: 
CAPTAIN Position? 
The GPS officer enters keyboard commands on console marked "GLOBAL POSITIONING SATELLITE." He reads out the data: 
GPS OFFICER Two-two, zed-three, one-five north; a hundred fourteen degrees, five minutes, ten seconds east. 
CAPTAIN Mark. 
GPS OFFICER Locked on satellite, sir. 
CAPTAIN Set course, two-ten degrees, south south east. 
NAVIGATOR Coming about, sir. 
The Captain is all business - clipped, sober terse. Turns to his FIRST OFFICER, hands him a SLIP OF PAPER: 
CAPTAIN Orders from London: For the next ninety-six hours, we're to run on full radio silence. Double watches, full alert. (beat) We're to send one encrypted positioning burst to London every six hours - otherwise, zero electronic emissions. 
The first officer nods. 
CAPTAIN (cont'd) Inform the men, then run a surprise inspection. If someone paints us, I don't want this ship showing up on their radar screen like some god-damned Harrod's Christmas tree. 
FIRST OFFICER Yes, sir! 
CAPTAIN I'll be in my cabin until oh-six- hundred hours. 
The Captain heads for the door. 
SECOND OFFICER Captain leaving the bridge. 
The officers salute as he exits. With a shrug, the FIRST OFFICER picks up the INTERCOM MICROPHONE: 
FIRST OFFICER Attention all hands. Now hear this... 
INT. CREW'S MESS - 
Crowded with CREW MEMBERS eating, waiting on line for food. 
FIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM) We will rig immediately for electronic silence. All electronic gear is to be shut down... 
CLOSE ON COOK - KITCHEN -

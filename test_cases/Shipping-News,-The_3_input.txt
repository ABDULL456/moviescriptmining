She's looking at her cup now.     Not at him. 
WAVEY Came back one summer.     Fell for Herold Prowse. That.      Was that. 
Takes a swallow.     Closes her eyes. 
WAVEY Did you know I was a liar? 
Opens her eyes.     Straight into his.     Did you? 
WAVEY Herold liked other women.     But you know how that is. 
Sure you do. 
WAVEY (whispers) He didn't die. Not that he didn't deserve to. 
Quoyle blinks.     A perfect stunned ox gape. 
WAVEY See, I'm a good liar. 
Drains her cup. 
WAVEY He ran off to Seattle with some bitch. When his damaged son was two months old. And nobody knew. 
An ice-cold wink. 
WAVEY Like I said. It's four years ago. And it's yesterday. 
Pours herself another.     Savors the memory. 
WAVEY So I took his boat out. I sunk it. And told my little story. Grieving widow. 
Shrugs a drunken, careless shrug. 
WAVEY I was leaving, of course. Why humiliate myself on the wayout? 
Yes? 
WAVEY (softer) But a funny thing happened.        On 
my way out. 
Her eyes are deeper now.      And for a beat, the anger slips away. 
WAVEY All these funny, odd little folks? They put their hearts around me. So I wouldn't be alone. Having lost the man I loved. 
Silence.   A real one. 
WAVEY And since I knew, to my shame, that is exactly what I had lost. I let go of the will to leave. I did. 
I did. 
WAVEY Decided to let my child grow up. Around folks better than his mom. 
Stares in his eyes. 
WAVEY You're quite the talker. 
QUOYLE (quiet) I take pride in that. 
So she smiles.     But the bitterness is there in it. 
WAVEY Well, this morning.     The man I loved. Came back. 
And the world. Ceases to spin.         One man's world, at least.   She watches that. Assesses it. 
WAVEY Told me he knew.     I loved him still. 
Sips at her second drink.        Slides the rest of it down. 
WAVEY Okay. Now I'm drunk enough.         To talk about Petal. 
Her eyes ask.    Are you? 
WAVEY You're thinking we're kindred souls, you and me. In love with our nightmares. 
Shakes her head.     Uh-uh. 
WAVEY You don't love your Petal. You hate. Her cheating. Guts. 
Means those words as an opening blow.      Jacks or better.      Here comes the hole card... 
WAVEY You have to think it's love. Because if it's not, you're dead inside. So you keep that flame a flickering. Cos it's all you'll ever have. 
Pure contempt.     And honesty. 
WAVEY You see.   You're a good liar, too. 
Lifts the cap.     Screws it back on the bottle. 
WAVEY Where's the damn eggshells?     That's all I came to see. 
And from his prison of shock and shame.      He points to a shelf.      She is OFF his desk, like a panther... 
...SNATCHES the tiny padded box with its treasure.          RAISES it high to smash it, and... 
...stops.    To see the panic.    In his eyes. 
It brings tears.     Pooling in hers. 
And she sets the treasure down, with the tenderness that decency requires. 
WAVEY Can you guess how I know about Petal? 
He cannot.

SPRINGBOK HOOKER What's this? Homework? 
PIENAAR Sort of. 
The players look down at the pages. 
ON A PAGE: the words to Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, in Xhosa. 
One by one, the players look from the page to Pienaar. 
SPRINGBOK WING Cappie? What's this? 
PIENAAR We need to learn it. We can't just mouth the words anymore. 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER Nobody cares, as long as we win matches. 
PIENAAR They do care. 
SPRINGBOK LOCK It's their song, not ours. 
SPRINGBOK WING It's a terrorist song. 
SPRINGBOK PROP They used to arrest you for singing it. 
PIENAAR And now it's one of our anthems. 
But he's talking to a deeply conservative group of guys. 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER Cap. You know I leave my guts on the field for you, and you know I'd follow you into a fight anywhere, any time. But this ... 
The hooker crumples the page, is about to throw it away. 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER ... I can't even read it. I definitely can't pronounce the words. 
One look at his men, and Pienaar knows he has hit a wall. 
PIENAAR Okay, boys. It's optional. Take it if you want to. 
The players are relieved. Pienaar looks down at the sheet of paper for a moment, then looks up at the guys. 
PIENAAR It means "God Bless Africa". (BEAT) Which you have to admit, we could use. 
Nonetheless, most of the players crumple the pages, toss them into the closest trash can. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TV STUDIO 
BOLAND BOTHA Tell us, Mr. President, have you always been a rugby fan? 
Mandela appears with Boland Botha on his show, under a ONE TEAM, ONE NATION banner. 
MANDELA People do not realize that I once played rugby myself, when I was a student at Fort Hare. It is a very rough game. Almost as rough as politics. 
Boland laughs. 
BEGIN BOLAND BOTHA/MANDELA INTERVIEW SEQUENCE 
SHOTS OF BOOZE BEING DELIVERED to people's houses all over the country by BOTTLE STORE DELIVERY VANS (a very South African alcoholic enabling service). Lots and lots of booze. 
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.) How do you think the Springboks will do? 
MANDELA (V.O.) I think they will do very well. Their level of commitment is tremendous. 
THE SPRINGBOKS TRAIN on an isolated field at the SILVERMINE ARMY BASE outside Cape Town. Tactics and refinements, not fitness training. 
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.) Now, it's been said that you used to support any team who played against the Springboks. 
MANDELA (V.O.) Obviously, that is no longer true. I am one hundred percent behind our boys. 
JASON, ETIENNE, LINGA and HENDRICK stand anxiously outside Newlands Stadium. One of them points to the top of a tall building nearby -- a Eureka! moment, for reasons we don't yet understand. 
BACK TO THE STUDIO: 
MANDELA After all, if I cannot change when circumstances demand it, how can I ask others to? 
END BOLAND BOTHA/MANDELA INTERVIEW SEQUENCE 
EXT. CAPE TOWN - DAY 
A SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENSE FORCE HELICOPTER hovers over the tall building next to Newlands stadium. 
INT. SADF HELICOPTER - DAY 
IN THE HELICOPTER, Mandela, Jason, Linga, all wearing radio headsets. All wearing suits, as if for a state occasion. 
JASON (ON RADIO) We're going to land you on top of that building. We'll own the road between it and the stadium. 
Mandela likes it. 
Jason gives the pilot a nod and they take off down the peninsula towards Silvermine Army base. 
FROM THE HELICOPTER, MANDELA LOOKS down at his country, and finds it good. 
EXT. CAPE - DAY 
Helicopter against spectacular scenery. 
INT. SADF HELICOPTER - DAY 
Mandela points down. Jason and Linga look. 
POV FROM THE AIR: They can see the Springboks practising right below them, on the army base. 
Mandela pulls out the SPORTS SECTION with the Springbok team on it. His study guide. He takes a last minute glance at it as the helicopter loses altitude. 
EXT. SILVERMINE ARMY BASE - RUGBY FIELDS - DAY 
Mandela's helicopter lands at the edge of the field, and brings practise to a halt. 
ON COACH -- not happy, but what's he going to do.

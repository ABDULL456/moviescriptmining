Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge. \nKEPHEUS You knew about this and said nothing? \nCASSIOPEIA \n(ACCUSATORY) Just which king do you serve? \nAMOUN My Queen, I serve only the great order of things. I was the boy's tutor years ago. \nKEPHEUS How haughty this boy must be, who knows he is half-God. \nAMOUN He knows nothing and believes himself an ordinary man. He has never left his village. He can be overconfident, but it is from inexperience, not arrogance. Repheus and Cassiopeia exchange wary looks. Sharply \nCASSIOPEIA What assurance do we have that our daughter will be safe? \nTHOTH \n(LOSING PATIENCE) You have my word, as Ambassador of the Gods. \nKEPHEUS With our daughter's future at stake, we do not bestow trust easily. \n(THREATENING) If any harm should come to her -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Amoun reacts, but it is too late -- Thoth has been \nIRRITATED: Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing with an AWFUL SHUDDER. The room TILTS. Kepheus and the Queen grab for a solid handhold, frightened. The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and pile up in defiance of gravity. Wine goblets tilt toward Thoth. \nTHOTH \n(ICY) The Princessa shall not be harmed. \nAMOUN (urgently, to the \nKING) Your Majesty... \nKEPHEUS \n(SHAKEN) Of course... of course your word is unquestioned here. Thoth's demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the table, rolling across the floor to Kepheus' feet. TILT UP TO his intimidated face: \nKEPHEUS Where is the lucky young suitor? \nEXT. UNDERWATER (THE AEGEAN SEA)                            - DAY \nPerfectly blue, sunlight shafting from the surface. A GREAT WHITE SHARK appears, ensnared in a fisherman's net. Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can. As the net passes we see -- ANTEROS, a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in the net, desperately trying to hold his breath. When they have disappeared, we see a FIGURE appear through the blue in pursuit. As he passes, we get our first look \nAT -- PERSEUS,                                                    25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw, a knife in his teeth. He swims with the power and grace of a porpoise -- beyond the ability of any normal man. \nEXT. SEA FLOOR - DAY \nThe shark thrashes about, jaws snapping close to Anteros. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his knife to cut the net near the shark's snout. The shark tries to swim through the hole, but instead drags the net upwards. Perseus hangs on. One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net, bumping the young hero as it swims away. Perseus pulls Anteros toward the surface. \nEXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY \nA CREW of FISHERMEN wait desperately at the rail. SPYROS, the oldest and toughest, watches in agony. Perseus breaks the surface, gasping, his lifeless friend in his arms. Five crewmen dive in to help, but Perseus is mad with despair. They have to pull him away. Spyros watches sadly. But also, relieved to see the one survivor. \nEXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY \nSpyros makes his way to the bow, where Perseus sits alone, downcast, in pain. Spyros watches in silence. Then, gruffly -- \nSPYROS Your grieving does Anteros no good. It comforts only you. \nPERSEUS It's my fault he's gone. \n", "test1_true": "PERSEUS So it's his fault. Not mine, not fate, not the Gods? \nSPYROS \n(DISDAINFULLY) The Gods delude themselves about their power and watch in envy while we act. We make our own history. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPERSEUS (breaks down, crying) Now my history is I let my friend die in my arms. I made it back, why couldn't he? \nSPYROS What you do, no other man can do. Have you not noticed? \nPERSEUS To what purpose? I failed him. \nSPYROS \n(SCOFFS) Purpose! Looking for purpose is what ensnares men in the superstition of the Gods, as surely as your friend was caught in that net. And all the searching leads down to the same place. The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos. Perseus looks off at the rocky coast. Collects himself, \nQUIETLY -- \nPERSEUS You always say that my abilities are greater than other men's. But they were not enough to save him. \nSPYROS You are still a man, confined by man's limits. You are just as likely to fail as succeed. \nPERSEUS How is that greater than other men? \nSPYROS Ordinary men fail most of the time. The trawler rounds a point on the island. Perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff. A closer \nLOOK -- A huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe figure. Flowers in her golden hair -- wilted dahlias. Young yet ancient. THE WILTING GIRL. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: She watches Perseus intently as the boat passes. He turns to see if Spyros or his friends have seen her, but no one has. When he looks back, she's gone. \nEXT. PROMONTORY NEAR THE HOME OF SPYROS - MAGIC HOUR \nPerseus sits looking sadly at the sea that killed his friend. TEKLA,                                             14, Perseus' adoptive sister, runs up from the modest stone dwelling. She sees his mood and touches his arm gently. \nTEKLA Mother wants you to come in for supper. (as he is \nUNRESPONSIVE) Perseus, why are you so sad? This breaks his spell. He looks at Tekla warmly, gets up and puts a reassuring arm around her shoulders as they head inside. \nINT. HOME OF SPYROS - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nPerseus eats with his adoptive family: Spyros, his wife MARMARA, and Tekla. Spyros is patient and twinkly with his wife though he disagrees with her beliefs. \nTEKLA I still don't understand. \nSPYROS Your mother can explain. She believes everything has an explanation, even if we have to make it up. \n(OFF MARMARA'S \nWARNING LOOK) It's one of the reasons I love you, Marmara. \nTEKLA Tell me! Why is there war between Man and the Gods? Marmara and Tekla continue to bring out the food. \nMARMARA At the beginning of time, when Man was young, he prayed to the Gods. His belief in the Gods gave his life meaning. It was a good thing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSPYROS If you consider superstition, fear and darkness good things... \nMARMARA \n(IGNORING HIM) But Man grew, as children do, and he turned away from the Gods. Be began to put his faith in other things. Perseus watches the debate with fiery eyes. \nTEKLA What things? \n", "test1_id": 3144, "test2_input": "REPHEUS Impossible. \nAMOUN \n(TURNING FROM \nPERSEUS) No... We need only the will to do it. \nKEPHEUS You spoke the words -- the monster is indestructible! \nPERSEUS \n(QUIETLY) How can that be? Amoun alone takes notice: he spins toward Perseus, with relief. \nAMOUN Perseus! You had something you wanted to say to the King? All eyes turn to Perseus, who shrinks before them, self- conscious. \nPERSEUS What? No, Master Amoun. I'm listening. \nAMOUN You're 'listening'? We're talking about the precious life of your betrothed. Perseus meets his gaze, confused. \nPERSEUS I'm a newcomer here. I would not presume to tell these men -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAMOUN Exactly! A newcomer with a fresh perspective. Share your thoughts with the King, your future father- in-law. The ministers are puzzled by Amoun's persistence. Perseus, uncertainly -- \nPERSEUS I know that I am young and have not seen much of the world, but it seems to me that nothing is indestructible. The Ministers react to the young man's arrogance. \nSPYROS                                                   (O.S.) I am far from young and have seen much of the world... and I agree with my son. Everyone turns to the new arrival: Perseus' adoptive father, Spyros. Perseus goes to embrace him. \nPERSEUS Father, how did you find me? \nKEPHEUS I thought this boy's father was a God. How does a stranger walk unmolested into the Throne Room of the King? \nAMOUN I sent for him, Lord. This good man raised Perseus from infancy. He will help him now. \nKEPHEUS Help him with what? \nSPYROS With whatever is needed... Perseus approaches the King. Surprising himself -- \nPERSEUS He will help me destroy Leviathan. Spyros does a double-take, then swallows: \"Yeah, okay, sure.\" \nUP ON THE BALCONY Andromeda reacts, falling in love with Perseus. \nIN THE THRONE ROOM \nKEPHEUS But how? Perseus has no idea. \nAMOUN Majesty, we can seek the counsel of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia. They know the hidden ways of the Gods. If Leviathan can be slain, they'll know how to do it. \nPERSEUS We have thirty days to find its weakness. \nMINISTER OF THE INTERIOR Twenty-nine. \nPERSEUS (flashes him a look) We'll leave tonight. \nKEPHEUS With what army? I dare not weaken our forces when the city is about to be besieged. \nPERSEUS (uncertain, glances \nAT SPYROS) We'll go alone. \nSPYROS \n(CATCHING UP) Yes. Give us a map. Amoun laughs. When some of the others join in, the   King gives them a look that stops them dead. \nAMOUN My King, with your permission... The King assents, seemingly lost. Amoun speaks to Perseus. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test2_true": "AMOUN I'll give you a map and much more. I'll go with you and bring a small band of comrades to help you on your mission. We can leave at first light. (to his Aide) Diokles, the map. The men move to the work area, where the Aide selects a map from dozens. Something catches Perseus' eye. \nPERSEUS' POV Andromeda, up in the balcony, has made herself visible only to him. She silently mouths these words -- \"Thank... you.\" \nAT THE MAP which has been hung for all to see, Amoun uses a pointer. \nAMOUN We head north on the Via Dahlia. If we can make it to the Disputed Territories... MOVE IN ON the tip of Amoun's pointer on the \nAMOUN (O.S.) . we'll join the Cleon desert legion, the most formidable unit in all the army... With their escort, we can safely reach our destination in Skolothia, which lies to the east... We DISSOLVE THROUGH the map and pointer, which remain LIGHTLY SUPERIMPOSED over the following: \nEXT. VIA DAHLIA - DAY \nMUSIC SWELLS as we see THE FULL EXPEDITION on horseback, on the main road north. As they come over a rise, Amoun \nIDENTIFIES THEM: First, two fearsome Mongols, MONGKE and TAMBURLANE. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAMOUN (V.0.) Our guides will be Mongke and Tamburlane, father and son monster hunters from the Kingdom of the Iron Horde. Next, THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, commanded by a square-jawed old soldier, DRACO. His men, in heavy armor: KOSMO, Draco's lieutenant, and the soldiers ABAS, ICOS, THAD, BOREAS, KRIKOR, and POLLUC. \nAMOUN (V.0.) Our escort will be a detachment of the Praetorian Guard, led by Commander Draco -- the staunchest security force in Joppa. Next, on a stunning pale horse, a pale rider -- the Wilting Girl. \nPERSEUS                                                   (V.0.) Why do we bring the Earth Goddess into this danger? \nAMOUN (V.0.) I thank the stars we have her. Besides, she takes her orders from an authority much greater than I. Next, Spyros; horseback riding is not one of his many skills. Behind him, Perseus and Amoun ride talking -- \nPERSEUS Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence you came into my life as tutor, so long ago, and now, once again you instruct me. \nAMOUN \n(LAUGHS) No matter what you believe, Porpoise, some things are fated. I've been looking forward to this journey for a long, long time. He spurs his horse, riding ahead. Spyros drops back beside Perseus. \nSPYROS Who would have thought we'd be on a journey like this? Two simple fishermen. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPERSEUS I'm afraid I've dragged you into real danger, Father, when I have little idea of what I'm doing. \nSPYROS Living at the mercy of the sea so long has convinced me some adventures are unexpected and some dangers unavoidable. It's all in your attitude. \nPERSEUS What's our attitude about destroying Leviathan? \nSPYROS The Kraken is just another big fish. Perseus smiles, but is not as sanguine. \nEXT. TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON                              (OCEAN)                                   - PROW - NIGHT \nTiamat's Palace-Galleon is bigger than anything man can construct. Tiamat is at the prow of the vessel, using all her godly power to STIR THE ELEMENTS. With great effort, she sends a hurricane down on Joppa. Set the Void approaches the prow. \nTIAMAT The demigod and his retinue are joined. They march for the counsel of the Norn Sisters, to seek the frailty of my Leviathan. \nSET \n(CONCERNED) The Sisters... \nTIAMAT Yes. I beseech you, track the expedition. \nSET To plainly thwart them would betray our intentions and draw the wrath of Zeus and the others. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTIAMAT That, we cannot have. I merely suggest that the road to Skolothia is hazardous. \nSET I take your meaning. And your loyal brute, he is fixed upon the hunt? \nTIAMAT Fear not, he is about and he will do his share of damage. Set leaves. Tiamat resumes stirring the storm clouds. \n", "test2_id": 3145, "test3_input": "AMOUN You can honor Boreas by the way you act from this moment forward. \nPERSEUS I'm no demigod, Tutor. I'm not even much of a human. \nAMOUN It is not your choice. You are what you are. Amor fati, Perseus. 'Love thy fate.' \nPERSEUS I do not believe my fate is to be half a God. No demigod could feel as confused as I do tonight. \nAMOUN Concentrate on the task before you. All answers will come with that. \nPERSEUS Tell me of the Cleon Desert Legion. \nAMOUN A fierce group. Trained to fight... Amoun's DESCRIPTION CONTINUES as we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SIROQUE VALLEY - NIGHT \nSUPERIMPOSE: CLEON DESERT LEGION BIVOUAC, THE DISPUTED \nTERRITORIES The desert camp of the Legion is lit by torches.

A LOOKOUT peers into the dark desert, listening. Now he HEARS something, turns and shouts to another SENTRY: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLOOKOUT The Night Patrol returns on the Gorge Road! That message is shouted along from Sentries to Guards in the camp. OUT IN THE DARKNESS on the dusty Gorge Road, a dozen Soldiers gallop in GROUND-SHAKING FORMATION toward the firelit encampment. \nAMOUN                                                       (V.0.) . They've been chasing Djinn Raiders in the mountains for years. \nPERSEUS                                                     (V.0.) Djinn Raiders? \nAMOUN (V.0.) Yes, Godly zealots, supposedly insane. They fight like Hades himself is keeping score... From the dark SURROUNDING DESERT, WE SEE the Night Patrol ride into camp and dismount. \nAMOUN                                                       (V.0.) .. That's how the Desert Legion came to be called 'God-slayers.' I'm not ashamed to say I'll be relieved to have their protection the rest of the way... Amoun's Voice FADES. TILT DOWN TO the barren, desert flats. Suddenly, a miracle transforms the moonlit \nSCRUB -- Strange, beautiful MAGENTA FLOWERS sprout magically where there had been only dirt and cacti. The LOTUS BLOSSOMS surround the camp. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE (SIROQUE VALLEY) - NIGHT \nThe Cleon camp is just twinkling lights from here on the mountain. Startlingly, a huge DEFORMED PAW/CLAW/HOOF scrapes onto a boulder. Pulling himself INTO VIEW in repulsive CLOSEUP -- Kalibos. (There, within his frightening visage, is the distinctive crooked scar we noticed on the jaw of Acrisius in his human form.) When his twisted body has gained purchase, he looks up the mountain. AN EERIE LIGHT illuminates his awestruck countenance. Above him -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: -- Tiamat, ensconced in a natural throne of rock. Turning a Lotus blossom in her hand, she smiles on Kalibos, like a benevolent mother. \nTIAMAT My loyal friend. it is beneath you to stalk this band of infidels one by one. Events demand more decisive action. Kalibos' SPEECH is as tortured and deformed as his body -- \nKALIBOS Grorashnrd... I to be... ruler... rhodirs... made whole... sovfrenty... kingdom mine... \nTIAMAT Yes, Kalibos, the time is nigh when I restore you to your rightful form -- proud Acrisius. With me, your protector, on the throne of Olympos... the violator Zeus deposed. Kalibos reacts, with what must be satisfaction. \nTIAMAT Go down into this valley. See what I am building for you -- an army dangerous and fearless as you, their leader. \nEXT. CLEON LEGION BIVOUAC - PREDAWN \nSeveral Soldiers have been drawn from camp by the IRRESISTIBLE FRAGRANCE of the Lotus flowers. They pluck petals and chew them. The rest of the Legion filters out between the tents to take their fill of the drug. Kalibos watches the handsome, powerful warriors from across the field of Lotus blossoms. \nINT. THE BASILICA - ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT \nPeshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on Andromeda's bed. On instinct, she hurries to the bed and throws off the covers -- a pile of cushions, no Andromeda. Peshet races out. \nEXT. THE ACROPOLIS - NIGHT \nPeshet sprints through the RAIN, dodging the REFUGEES and CITIZENS like a cat, peering under each hood, searching for her mistress. \nEXT. THE ACROPOLIS - COVERED PLAZA - NIGHT \nOn the plaza, a rabid throng of Refugees. Fantasos, the Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by BODYGUARDS, including Agenor. As before, Fantasos seems to have actual hypnotic powers. \n", "test3_true": "FANTASOS . Does Kepheus worry about you? No! Only the Princessa... And still, the Kraken comes! Does the King build his defenses at the water's edge? \"NO!\" cries the crowd.

He makes his stand at his daughter's chamber door!... We will show Kepheus we're not sacrificial fodder. We will tremble the walls of his Basilica! RABID SUPPORT from the mob. Peshet stops suddenly, peering ahead. \nHER POV at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda herself watches from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAGENOR (O.S.)

THE ACROPOLIS - ALLEY.- NIGHT \nPeshet rounds a corner, frustrated. Andromeda is gone. A hand grabs Peshet's shoulder, startling her. It is Fantasos. \nFANTASOS Peshet, you've come at the right time. Fantasos engages her with hypnotic power. Peshet nods, trance-like. \nFANTASOS One night soon, a gong will sound three times. When you hear it, unlock the back gate of the Basilica. Then go to Andromeda's chambers... (hands her a dagger) . and bring the Princess out. My men will take her to Leviathan. Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling. \nFANTASOS Do you understand me? (harshly, off her non- \nRESPONSE) Peshet, do you understand how important your part is? She nods, horrified by her predicament. \nEXT. ROAD (THE SIROQUE MOUNTAINS)  - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSE: THE SIROQUE MOUNTAINS, THE DISPUTED TERRITORIES...   19 DAYS REMAINING \nThe Expedition moves through a mountain pass. Perseus eyes a cliff.

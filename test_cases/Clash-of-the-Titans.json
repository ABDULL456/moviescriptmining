{"train": "INT. ATRIUM                                                 (OLYMPOS)   - DAY \nTHOTH THE QUICK enters the wide courtyard, his cape billowing. He strides past the reflecting pool in the center of the courtyard, gravely acknowledging -- -- each of the TEN FIGURES seated around the perimeter... THE OLYMPIANS. APOLLO is here, and bronze-helmeted ATHENA; APHRODITE and muscular VULCAN -- we are dazzled and lose count. Thoth bows deeply before the throne of ZEUS, majestic, bearded, awe-inspiring. An EAGLE is perched on his arm. \nTHOTH My lord. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nZEUS (rumbles, like \nTHUNDER) We have debated, we have voted, and it is decided. We offer the Humans peace. Thoth, you will take them the terms of a treaty -- \nTIAMAT                                                     (O.S.) \n(SCORNFULLY) A treaty! Zeus and his eagle turn their heads. The God's eyes are familiar -- the blazing orbs we saw in The Dog. In the shadowed corner of the atrium stand TWO MORE Olympians: SET THE VOID, whose countenance is death made visible, and -- -- TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, the only God fearless enough to challenge Zeus' rule -- \nTIAMAT We don't negotiate with them! We dictate to them. Their place is to beg. They have forgotten their role and have denied us the sustenance of their prayers. \nAPHRODITE Our mercy will give them reason to be grateful. They will bow down and whisper our names with more passion than before. \nTIAMAT They will bow down when we snap their backs! Mercy? We are Gods! Some of us remember that and are not afraid -- Zeus has had enough: furious ARCS OF LIGHTNING jump to the walls, the eagle beats its wings in rage. \nZEUS Silence! Or learn what it is to be afraid! The debate is over, the votes cast... Zeus points to a golden tray; it bears TEN chips of alabaster versus TWO shards of obsidian. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nZEUS We guarantee an armistice, we shield the bridegroom and the Joppan royal family. (turning again on \nTIAMAT) And we do not interfere in their actions. We leave them undisturbed unless-invoked by name to enter their affairs. \nSET And if they refuse our terms? \nZEUS They have suffered terrible losses. They will not pass up a chance for peace. \nINT. ATRIUM - MAGIC HOUR (LATER) \nOnly Tiamat and Set now. Tiamat regards Zeus' throne. \nSET This is your rightful place to take. \nTIAMAT Soon enough, Set. Zeus has grown weaker than I knew. Set gestures at the white chips on the tray as he picks up the two black shards representing their votes. He hands one to Tiamat. \nSET So have they all. They no longer see clearly. \nTIAMAT \n(DISDAINFUL) They're beginning to think like Men. But you and I shall not. Set agrees, his eyes searching her face. \nTIAMAT We will manage these thick-witted Humans to our own ends. (off his look) Yes, we will be bound by great Zeus' rules... until their fragile membranes tear. We dare not interfere with these insects... \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTIAMAT                                                   (CONT'D) but we may be invited to intervene. Tiamat flicks the obsidian into the reflecting pool -- the whole pool darkens and choppy waves crash over the sides... a tiny tempest. \nEXT. THE AGORA                                           (MARKETPLACE) OF JOPPA - DAY \nThe long war with the Gods has wounded this city, but life goes stubbornly on. Among the war-torn buildings is a bustling market. CITIZENS eye the wares. MERCHANTS, PERFORMERS, noise, and MUSIC. \nSUPERIMPOSE: JOPPA, CAPITAL OF THE DOMINION OF ILLYRIA Suddenly the market falls SILENT. Fear grips the crowd. An occurrence rare in the world of Men -- AN OLYMPIAN \nAPPROACHES. The clouds stop dead. The crowd stops. TIME STOPS. A PRESENCE WE DO NOT SEE moves to the BASILICA, the royal residence and assembly hall. \nINT. THE BASILICA - THRONE ROOM - DAY \nKEPHEUS I have heard of no such demigod. \nAMOUN Majesty, if I may -- the young man does exist. He lives in a small fishing village on the isle of Seriphos. Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge. \nKEPHEUS You knew about this and said nothing? \nCASSIOPEIA \n(ACCUSATORY) Just which king do you serve? \nAMOUN My Queen, I serve only the great order of things. I was the boy's tutor years ago. \nKEPHEUS How haughty this boy must be, who knows he is half-God. \nAMOUN He knows nothing and believes himself an ordinary man. He has never left his village. He can be overconfident, but it is from inexperience, not arrogance. Repheus and Cassiopeia exchange wary looks. Sharply \nCASSIOPEIA What assurance do we have that our daughter will be safe? \nTHOTH \n(LOSING PATIENCE) You have my word, as Ambassador of the Gods. \nKEPHEUS With our daughter's future at stake, we do not bestow trust easily. \n(THREATENING) If any harm should come to her -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Amoun reacts, but it is too late -- Thoth has been \nIRRITATED: Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing with an AWFUL SHUDDER. The room TILTS. Kepheus and the Queen grab for a solid handhold, frightened. The golden marbles on a tabletop roll from their pits and pile up in defiance of gravity. Wine goblets tilt toward Thoth. \nTHOTH \n(ICY) The Princessa shall not be harmed. \nAMOUN (urgently, to the \nKING) Your Majesty... \nKEPHEUS \n(SHAKEN) Of course... of course your word is unquestioned here. Thoth's demeanor changes. The marbles spill off the table, rolling across the floor to Kepheus' feet. TILT UP TO his intimidated face: \nKEPHEUS Where is the lucky young suitor? \nEXT. UNDERWATER (THE AEGEAN SEA)                            - DAY \nPerfectly blue, sunlight shafting from the surface. A GREAT WHITE SHARK appears, ensnared in a fisherman's net. Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can. As the net passes we see -- ANTEROS, a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in the net, desperately trying to hold his breath. When they have disappeared, we see a FIGURE appear through the blue in pursuit. As he passes, we get our first look \nAT -- PERSEUS,                                                    25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw, a knife in his teeth. He swims with the power and grace of a porpoise -- beyond the ability of any normal man. \nEXT. SEA FLOOR - DAY \nThe shark thrashes about, jaws snapping close to Anteros. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his knife to cut the net near the shark's snout. The shark tries to swim through the hole, but instead drags the net upwards. Perseus hangs on. One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net, bumping the young hero as it swims away. Perseus pulls Anteros toward the surface. \nEXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY \nA CREW of FISHERMEN wait desperately at the rail. SPYROS, the oldest and toughest, watches in agony. Perseus breaks the surface, gasping, his lifeless friend in his arms. Five crewmen dive in to help, but Perseus is mad with despair. They have to pull him away. Spyros watches sadly. But also, relieved to see the one survivor. \nEXT. FISHING TRAWLER - DAY \nSpyros makes his way to the bow, where Perseus sits alone, downcast, in pain. Spyros watches in silence. Then, gruffly -- \nSPYROS Your grieving does Anteros no good. It comforts only you. \nPERSEUS It's my fault he's gone. \nSPYROS Learning, science... love. \nPERSEUS \n(PASSIONATE) self-determination! Those things that give Man dignity and independence. \nMARMARA But what of the Gods, who had protected and guided us so long? They must breathe our prayers to survive. They hunger for \nWORSHIP -- \nSPYROS -- as lions hunger for blood. \nMARMARA Spyros! \n(TO TEKLA) Your father's mind is closed on these matters. \nSPYROS The Gods were desperate to claim our awe again. \nTEKLA Desperate... the Gods? \nSPYROS Yes, even the Gods. If they could not earn our faith with love, they would demand it with fear. Whatever was necessary to ensure              L their continued existence. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Marmara and the wide-eyed Tekla sit down. \nMARMARA And that is how war broke out between Man and Gods. (turning to serve \nPERSEUS) Now eat your dinner, which the Gods -- and your father -- have provided. \nINT. HOME OF SPYROS - PERSEUS' ROOM - NIGHT \nMiddle of the night. Perseus lies wide awake in his tiny space. He stares, thinking about his friend. Suddenly, a KNOCK at the door. \nINT. HOME OF SPYROS - DOORWAY - NIGHT \nPerseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl. Her beauty electrifies him. She glows from within, but her color is oddly faded, washed-out. \nPERSEUS You... I saw you watching our boat at the cliff. \nWILTING GIRL It was not the boat I was watching. \nPERSEUS Can I be of service? \nWILTING GIRL Yes, of service. I need you to come with me on a journey. Perseus gives her a look. \nPERSEUS Right now? (as she nods) It wouldn't take much persuading to get me to leave this village, but tonight is impossible. My family can't wake and find me gone. Where do you want me to go? \nWILTING GIRL It's not what I want. I am in the service of others. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Perseus can't get over her beauty, the dulcet sound of her voice. Even so -- \nPERSEUS Come back in the morning and we can talk about it. \nWILTING GIRL I'm sorry. \nPERSEUS For what? Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a swarm, racing toward him. He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and falls. \nPERSEUS' WOOZY POV The Wilting Girl standing placidly in the doorway watching him. \nBACK TO SCENE He blacks out. \nEXT. SMALL SAILBOAT                                         (OPEN SEA)   - DAY \nA white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat swiftly across the sea. The Wilting Girl, alone, sits quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering. \nCLOSER We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are bite marks on his legs and arms, but they seem to be healing as we look at them. Perseus stirs and wakes, squinting up at the Wilting Girl. \nPERSEUS How long have I been out? \nPERSEUS Who, me? \nWILTING GIRL Zeus himself has chosen you. A demigod may be less than a God, but he's more than a Man. One foot in Humanity, the other in Divinity. Your marriage will be a symbol of accord between our races. \nPERSEUS Forget it. \nWILTING GIRL Such a union could save millions of souls. Perseus is struck by that. He looks off across the sea. \nPERSEUS And just who exactly am I supposed to marry? \nINT. BASILICA                                             (JOPPA)                                                   - SCULLERY CLOSET - DAY \nCLOSEUP: A hot embrace. In the blur of movement our first good look is at the GIRL, a beauty -- PRINCESSA \nANDROMEDA,                                                18. The BOY is AGENOR, a kitchen helper -- ripped and sexy. It's hard to tell who's the aggressor here. Gasping, Andromeda holds him at bay -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANDROMEDA Do you think you can manhandle a Princess this way? (as he kisses her) As though she was hungry and needy as you, a mere servant? Another steamy kiss. In between liplocks, she whispers \nHOTLY -- \nANDROMEDA very mistaken... a woman of my station... never be attracted... They go at it again. \nEXT. BASILICA - COLONNADE - DAY \nA NIMBLE GIRL hurries past SERVANTS hanging laundry in the atrium. She's PESHET, handmaid to Princessa Andromeda. She has a feline quality -- eyes, grace, agility. She raps on the scullery door. \nPESHET Princess... Princess! \nANDROMEDA (O.S.) (muffled from inside) The Princess is not here. \n(A SQUEAL) Find another... Princess. \nPESHET The Queen approaches! \nANDROMEDA (O.S.) I don't care! \nPESHET Andromeda! You'll care enough if you're caught! Remember last time... From inside we HEAR complaining, more kissing and moaning. \nCASSIOPEIA                                                 (O.S.) Peshet! Startled, Peshet spins to see the Queen approach. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCASSIOPEIA Where is the Princess? \nINT. SCULLERY CLOSET - SAME TIME \nAndromeda freezes at her mother's voice, stops Agenor, finger to her lips. He ignores her, starts again. Andromeda does something below the frame that jolts him off. The girl can take care of herself. \nEXT. COLONNADE - SAME TIME \nPeshet faces the Queen. \nPESHET Is she not in her chambers, ma'am? \nCASSIOPEIA She is not. You are expected to know her -- A SQUEAL and WHISPERING from the closet stops Cassiopeia. She throws a perturbed glance at the door. Peshet looks guilty. \nCASSIOPEIA \n(LOUDLY) Tell the Princess -- should you find her -- her father and I want to see her at once. She stalks away. Urgently, through the door -- \nPESHET Princess, it's the King as well! \nINT. BASILICA - ROYAL PARLOR - DAY \nA lavish room. Cassiopeia and Kepheus sit in golden chairs, looking off. Andromeda ENTERS FRAME, furious. with conviction -- \nIRRITABLY) What is she? \nCASSIOPEIA \n(EMBARRASSED) I'm sure she's preparing herself to make the best possible impression. Perseus suppresses a smile, amused by the royal couple. Kepheus paces with mounting impatience. \nKEPHEUS \n(LECTURING PERSEUS \nAGAIN) -- and all so she could be thrust into a momentous conflict... of which she knows nothing at all. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPERSEUS She's not the only one, sir. I don't know much about the events for which I've been drafted. \nKEPHEUS (disarmed, but tough \nGUY) I take no comfort in that, young man. In fact, I find little to take comfort in here. You are a stranger from a distant place, and I am asked to entrust the welfare of my daughter to you. \n(LEANING INTO \nPERSEUS) If you are not kind and patient with her, if any harm of any kind should come her way, I will have your head on a stake. Kepheus thinks he sees a smirk on Perseus' face. He puts his hand on the hilt of his sword. \nKEPHEUS Is this amusing to you? \nPERSEUS Not even a little, my lord. It's just that I myself was waylaid -- snatched also, as you say, from my happy springtime... Kepheus studies him to see if he's making jest of him. \nPERSEUS I've been told I'm to play a part in events which serve a higher purpose... of which I'm not at all convinced. \nKEPHEUS Does a truce in the war between Men and Gods not strike you as a higher purpose? \nPERSEUS With all respect, I have never seen a God. On my island, they're no more than a story. \nKEPHEUS You will learn there is more to this universe than is found on your island. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKEPHEUS                                                  (CONT-D) \n(TO CASSIOPEIA) This is supposed to be the son of a God, yet he doubts their existence! \nCASSIOPEIA \n(TO PERSEUS) They exist, young man. But if you doubt their power, I join you -- \nKEPHEUS \n(ANGRY) Cassiopeia! We have agreed such talk has no place in this palace. \nCASSIOPEIA \n(DEFIANT) Have we? \nPERSEUS I can only proceed based on what I have experienced, not on a faith I do not possess. \nKEPHEUS Where does a young person get such ideas? \nPERSEUS Perhaps from my adopted father, sir. I admire him greatly, and he believes in little he cannot hold in his hand. \nKEPHEUS Is he a scholar? \nPERSEUS No, Your Highness, a fisherman. \nAMOUN (O.S.) I know this mentor who so influences young Perseus. Amoun has silently entered the chamber. Perseus reacts in amazement. \nEXT. OCEAN TERRACE - MAGIC HOUR \nPerseus follows the MUSIC and the sound of LAUGHTER to a crowded terrace overlooking the sea. Upper class YOUNG PEOPLE are partying en masse. Perseus moves through the revelry, looking at every girl, testing his instincts. Suddenly, he stops in his tracks, looking off -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Andromeda is dancing at the center of attention, her sheer gown enhancing her sensuality. The MUSIC ends. Andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane. A HANDSOME YOUNG NOBLEMAN embraces her. She gives him a deep kiss, causing a sensation, then breaks away into the crush. \nEXT. BALUSTRADE - MAGIC HOUR \nAndromeda glides to the balustrade to watch the sunset. The Young Nobleman approaches, but her imperious gesture stops him cold. \nPERSEUS                                                     (O.S.) Very beautiful. Andromeda spins, petulant. \nANDROMEDA Will you please give me some \nPEACE -- The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause. \nANDROMEDA What did you say? \nPERSEUS I said, 'Very beautiful.' \nANDROMEDA Do you think just anyone can make intimate judgements on the royal family? \nPERSEUS I meant the sunset. She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder. \nANDROMEDA Do you always start a seduction with an insult? Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks at the sea. \nPERSEUS I know nothing of seduction. I'm a simple fisherman. My home is across that water. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANDROMEDA What brings you here? \nPERSEUS To Joppa? I was kidnapped. \nANDROMEDA I mean here, tonight. He looks over at her a long moment. \nPERSEUS I've come to see my future wife. Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad mix of emotions crosses her face. \nEXT. GARDENS OF THE BASILICA - NIGHT \nPerseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens. She stays close, attracted to him. \nANDROMEDA It's not personal. You're not a bad-looking boy. (as Perseus laughs) I'm too young. I don't want to be married. \nPERSEUS Me either. \nANDROMEDA Then why are you doing it? \nPERSEUS No one asked me. And now that I've met you, I don't know if I can go through with it. (off her look) It's not personal. Seeing you makes it real. I think a man should make his own decisions. I won't be the pawn of a King or a God. She looks at him with new interest. \nANDROMEDA Since we agree, it's settled. No marriage. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPERSEUS I don't think it's going to be that simple. Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer. \nANDROMEDA That doesn't mean we can't be friends. Get to know each other. I want to show you something. She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze. \nEXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - NIGHT \nBeautiful in the moonlight. She hurries him quickly around one turn, then another, and another. He laughs at her excitement. \nPERSEUS I'm already lost. \nANDROMEDA I'll take care of you. They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what could be mistaken for a bed. \nKALIBOS. \nTIAMAT (V.O.) (to the monster) My Servant, your lonely solitude now ends... It's time to leave. \nEXT. THE BASILICA - GARDEN MAZE - SUNRISE \nPerseus wakes on the bed of foliage, looks around. Andromeda is gone. He thinks, smiles. Then he remembers his situation. The smile fades. \nINT. THE BASILICA - GREAT HALL - EVENING \nPerseus, in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armor, moves through the crowd of REVELERS. The grandiose room is hemmed by columns and statues. The royal family sits on the dais. Andromeda motions Perseus up beside her. \nANDROMEDA You're late. \nPERSEUS I didn't know how to get this outfit on. \nANDROMEDA I want to thank you for seeing me home. I was so flushed with wine I can't recall much of the evening. Perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd. \nPERSEUS Me either. \nPERSEUS' POV - THE WILTING GIRL watches from the back of the hall. When they make eye contact, she quickly looks away. \nBACK TO SCENE Perseus is surprised by his feelings. Andromeda has seen her, too. He has a guilty moment and averts his eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANDROMEDA At what point do you plan to tell them we're not getting married? \nPERSEUS Tell who? \nANDROMEDA (a sweeping gesture) Them... \nFROM BEHIND THEM We see the ecstatic crowd of thousands, all celebrating the union. MUSIC STOPS and the crowd begins to settle. \nROYAL HERALD (0.5.) The Queen will speak! The room QUIETS as Cassiopeia moves front-and-center of the dais with a cup of wine, not her first. \nCASSIOPEIA I won't be long-winded. You all know I am a modest person, no matter my rank. Some of the crowd react silently. Andromeda watches her mother with trepidation, but not as much as Kepheus, watching from his throne. \nCASSIOPEIA \n(WITH EDGE) This is not a celebration of a betrothal... (as Kepheus is on \nALERT) not the celebration of the happiness of two parents, or of our good people. Mild confusion in the hall, concern from the Royal Entourage. \nCASSIOPEIA This union represents new hope for a lasting peace! That is the only cause for celebration. The crowd reacts with exclamations and applause. Amoun wills her to stop. Cassiopeia takes another drink, looks over at the Princess. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCASSIOPEIA \n(MOIST-EYED) My sweet Andromeda... grown into a fine young woman, confident and sure. Look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Her subjects agree loudly. Andromeda wishes this would end. Cassiopeia raises her glass. \nCASSIOPEIA To my beautiful daughter... more beautiful than all the women of Joppa. More beautiful than the Gardens of Nineveh... Kepheus is about to pull her away. She throws him a spiteful glance. \nCASSIOPEIA More beautiful than the turquoise ocean and its sublime Goddess of the Deep... Tiamat herself! My daughter is a beauty even a Goddess must envy. Amoun reacts in dismay. A distressed MURMUR roils the crowd. Andromeda goes to her mother. \nCASSIOPEIA I've gone on too long -- She stops with a look of sudden dread. The Great Hall DARKENS. The torch flames TURN BLACK. The temperature drops. The statues lining the hall shut their eyes and the doors burst open. TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, floats forward, parting the terrified celebrants. Perseus sees his first Olympian. Tiamat arrives at the dais. Cassiopeia drops to her knees. \nTIAMAT You have blasphemed powers beyond understanding... You, a stupid braying goat before the unfathomable galaxies. You dare put this frivolous, scrawny slut... \n(AS ANDROMEDA \nFLINCHES) above the infinite Goddess of the Deep! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Tiamat tears off her cloak and STANDS NAKED. Her body, made from the elements of the sea, is magnificent -- sexy and terrifying. Fantasos, the priest who proselytizes for Tiamat in the streets, is in the throng. His reaction is a mix of religious ecstasy and outright lust. The celebrants shield their eyes, but Cassiopeia can't. She crumples, aging before our eyes. Every word shakes her frame -- \nINT. THE BASILICA - ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT \nTiamat's storm is pounding Joppa. LIGHTNING stabs through the dark clouds. RAIN POUNDS the tiles outside Andromeda's lavish bedroom. Peshet glides to Andromeda, who's wide awake, red-eyed, distressed. \nPESHET You must sleep. (off no reaction) Princessat You must take care of yourself. A CRACK OF THUNDER. Andromeda looks over at her, thinking. \nANDROMEDA My father was ready to sacrifice me to the monster. \nPESHET I'm sure that is not so. \nANDROMEDA I saw it. I heard the words. My loving father, his beloved child. Only Perseus stayed his decision. \n(TEARS COME) And do you know the worst part, Peshet? He was right. Peshet's feline eyes widen. More LIGHTNING. \nANDROMEDA The city is besieged, the people suffer. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANDROMEDA (CONT'D) Because of me, because he did not offer me up. Is that right? \nPESHET Go to sleep, my lady. \nANDROMEDA (wiping her eyes) Sleep? Sleep will come soon enough for me, faithful one. In one month... at the latest. The palace shakes with the ROLLING THUNDER. \nEXT. THE VIA DAHLIA - NIGHT \nThe sound of that same DISTANT THUNDER as the Expedition follows the road. To the south behind them, LIGHTNING FLASHES over faraway Joppa. \nSUPERIMPOSE: THE VIA DAHLIA, NORTH OF JOPPA... 28   DAYS REMAINING \nPerseus and the Wilting Girl ride side by side. Perseus looks back at the distant storm. \nPERSEUS Joppa is pummelled by the Dark Goddess. \nWILTING GIRL \n(WITHOUT LOOKING) It will not stop. Tiamat knows no mercy. \nThe moonlight illuminates a crumbling, limestone arch on which time-worn letters read: \"VIA DAHLIA.\" \nPERSEUS By what name may mortals call you? \nWILTING GIRL I have no name. \nPERSEUS Who do your worshippers pray to? \nWILTING GIRL I can't remember. \nPERSEUS Perhaps that is why they are falling in number? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The Wilting Girl flinches, and Perseus feels guilty about his jest. \nPERSEUS I have to call you something... \n(THINKING) Since we're naming you on this road, what about 'Via Dahlia'? She gives him a sharp look. Is he mocking her? He's defensive. \nPERSEUS That's a pretty name. Wait, better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's that... 'Vidalia'? That's more than pretty, beautiful really, just as you are. She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road ahead. \nPERSEUS You don't like it? (as she murmurs) What's that? I missed it -- \nWILTING GIRL (just loud enough to \nHEAR) I do not object. She picks up the pace, moving her horse a little ahead. He smiles. \nEXT. FOREST CLEARING (VIA DAHLIA) - NIGHT \nICOS Perseus. How long do you think you could stay on one of those? Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look. \nBOREAS Don't goad the boy, Icos. No Man can ride a Pegasus. \nICOS Did not Bellerophon tame the Great White Pegasus? \nBOREAS You're right. But he was a demigod... \nPERSEUS \n(EAGER) Then this will be a good way to find out just what I am. \nDRACO Stop it, rogues. One of our own has disappeared without a trace and all you can think is to cause mischief. What if Perseus is bucked to his death from a thousand feet up? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOREAS Don't worry, Commander, the boy won't even get on its back. With a \"watch this\" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him back down. \nDRACO Don't do this. If we go back to camp right now, we can avoid trouble and keep our goal in sight. A true leader will not be distracted. \nPERSEUS I'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun is. I'm too young to start avoiding trouble. Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings, buffeting Perseus with gusts. The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus face-first into the dirt. Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the clearing. \nBOREAS I'll collect him right now, Commander. Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL. The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and swallows it whole. Humbaba turns and SNIFFS the air, homing in on Perseus. \nDRACO Perseus, get out of there! Icos, fetch the others. Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with swords drawn to draw the monster's attention. Perseus does the same. \nDRACO I told you to run, boy. You'll make things worse. \nEXT. CEDAR FOREST ROAD - DAY \nHearing the ROARS, the Expedition is already up. Icos arrives. \nICOS A Humbaba! Mongke and Tamburlane fly into the woods; the others follow. \nEXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - DAY \nThe reinforcements arrive to see Humbaba pin Boreas with its talons. \nDRACO Boreas! Draco hacks at the monster's leg, to no avail. it rips off Boreas' head and swallows his body. Perseus CRIES OUT and leaps at the creature, sword swinging. \nAMOUN No, Perseus! \nVIDALIA Get back! Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling- bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the monster and thrusts his weapon -- a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOAT \nHOOK. Tamburlane hoists an ancient BAZOOKA. Mongke lights the fuse and backs away. KA-BOOM! The weapon belches fire and metal. The Humbaba staggers from the shot, but lunges and swallows Mongke whole. Spyros sinks his harpoon in one leg, but has it ripped from his hands. \nVIDALIA A delusion is planted in its mind. It thinks it's starving and it wants to feed on -- \n(SUDDENLY \nUNDERSTANDING) \n-- YOU! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces its nose. From inside, Mongke pries open the beast's mouth with his saber. \nVIDALIA I can't reverse the powerful curse. But if the monster's hungry, I can feed it. Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes. A cyclone of CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives straight into the monster's mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake them away, Mongke is thrown clear. \nVIDALIA \n(TO DRACO) Now! The belly! Slash the belly! Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's belly at the same moment Draco sweeps down. The two blades barely miss each other, opening a huge X in the belly. The others are shocked and impressed by Perseus. Steaming purple entrails spill over Perseus and Draco. HUMBABA CRASHES \nTO THE GROUND. The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake the viscera from their feathers and take flight. \nEXT. THE CEDAR FOREST - STREAM - DAY \nPerseus, somber, washes the creature's guts from his arms and legs. He turns to find Vidalia standing above him, furious. \nAMOUN You can honor Boreas by the way you act from this moment forward. \nPERSEUS I'm no demigod, Tutor. I'm not even much of a human. \nAMOUN It is not your choice. You are what you are. Amor fati, Perseus. 'Love thy fate.' \nPERSEUS I do not believe my fate is to be half a God. No demigod could feel as confused as I do tonight. \nAMOUN Concentrate on the task before you. All answers will come with that. \nPERSEUS Tell me of the Cleon Desert Legion. \nAMOUN A fierce group. Trained to fight... Amoun's DESCRIPTION CONTINUES as we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SIROQUE VALLEY - NIGHT \nSUPERIMPOSE: CLEON DESERT LEGION BIVOUAC, THE DISPUTED \nTERRITORIES The desert camp of the Legion is lit by torches. The LEGION SOLDIERS are handsome, powerful career warriors, going about their evening business -- eating, cleaning weapons, washing. \nAMOUN (V.0.) . behind enemy lines. A LOOKOUT peers into the dark desert, listening. Now he HEARS something, turns and shouts to another SENTRY: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLOOKOUT The Night Patrol returns on the Gorge Road! That message is shouted along from Sentries to Guards in the camp. OUT IN THE DARKNESS on the dusty Gorge Road, a dozen Soldiers gallop in GROUND-SHAKING FORMATION toward the firelit encampment. \nAMOUN                                                       (V.0.) . They've been chasing Djinn Raiders in the mountains for years. \nPERSEUS                                                     (V.0.) Djinn Raiders? \nAMOUN (V.0.) Yes, Godly zealots, supposedly insane. They fight like Hades himself is keeping score... From the dark SURROUNDING DESERT, WE SEE the Night Patrol ride into camp and dismount. \nAMOUN                                                       (V.0.) .. That's how the Desert Legion came to be called 'God-slayers.' I'm not ashamed to say I'll be relieved to have their protection the rest of the way... Amoun's Voice FADES. TILT DOWN TO the barren, desert flats. Suddenly, a miracle transforms the moonlit \nSCRUB -- Strange, beautiful MAGENTA FLOWERS sprout magically where there had been only dirt and cacti. The LOTUS BLOSSOMS surround the camp. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE (SIROQUE VALLEY) - NIGHT \nThe Cleon camp is just twinkling lights from here on the mountain. Startlingly, a huge DEFORMED PAW/CLAW/HOOF scrapes onto a boulder. Pulling himself INTO VIEW in repulsive CLOSEUP -- Kalibos. (There, within his frightening visage, is the distinctive crooked scar we noticed on the jaw of Acrisius in his human form.) When his twisted body has gained purchase, he looks up the mountain. AN EERIE LIGHT illuminates his awestruck countenance. Above him -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: -- Tiamat, ensconced in a natural throne of rock. Turning a Lotus blossom in her hand, she smiles on Kalibos, like a benevolent mother. \nTIAMAT My loyal friend. it is beneath you to stalk this band of infidels one by one. Events demand more decisive action. Kalibos' SPEECH is as tortured and deformed as his body -- \nKALIBOS Grorashnrd... I to be... ruler... rhodirs... made whole... sovfrenty... kingdom mine... \nTIAMAT Yes, Kalibos, the time is nigh when I restore you to your rightful form -- proud Acrisius. With me, your protector, on the throne of Olympos... the violator Zeus deposed. Kalibos reacts, with what must be satisfaction. \nTIAMAT Go down into this valley. See what I am building for you -- an army dangerous and fearless as you, their leader. \nEXT. CLEON LEGION BIVOUAC - PREDAWN \nSeveral Soldiers have been drawn from camp by the IRRESISTIBLE FRAGRANCE of the Lotus flowers. They pluck petals and chew them. The rest of the Legion filters out between the tents to take their fill of the drug. Kalibos watches the handsome, powerful warriors from across the field of Lotus blossoms. \nINT. THE BASILICA - ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT \nPeshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on Andromeda's bed. On instinct, she hurries to the bed and throws off the covers -- a pile of cushions, no Andromeda. Peshet races out. \nEXT. THE ACROPOLIS - NIGHT \nPeshet sprints through the RAIN, dodging the REFUGEES and CITIZENS like a cat, peering under each hood, searching for her mistress. \nEXT. THE ACROPOLIS - COVERED PLAZA - NIGHT \nOn the plaza, a rabid throng of Refugees. Fantasos, the Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by BODYGUARDS, including Agenor. As before, Fantasos seems to have actual hypnotic powers. \nCLOSE ON A DEFORMED FOOT as it plants in the dust. The companion foot lands beside it -- completely different. TILT UP TO: Kalibos. Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters. Kalibos immediately focuses on the demigod. He sniffs the air around Perseus. \nVIDALIA \n(WHISPERING) Lotophagi. Lotus-eaters. We should leave... now. \nPERSEUS I won't do anything rash. I've learned my lesson. \nVIDALIA This time you must do something rash. We all must. Kalibos leans close to Perseus. \nKALIBOS Tosharicana... demigod... expulsotat... Zeusl \nPERSEUS No... Perseus. PERSEUS WHIPS OUT HIS SWORD. The whole Expedition comes to life as                                                 -- THE LOTOPHAGI ATTACK, swift and brutal. Long arms thrash and rip at the Praetorians. Mongke and Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with HANDGONNES. Spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon. Amoun opens a leather sack of sand. \nAMOUN Muster to me! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there. Amoun tosses an arc of the black sand around them all. The ring of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of insects. Amoun shouts to the others, still fighting. \nAMOUN Come on! You can pass through! Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo, killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks back at Kosmo in horror. Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him, sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside. Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over the corpse into the protected circle. The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the barrier of insects to no avail. \nAMOUN Only humans can penetrate the shield! Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm, thinking. \nPERSEUS Only humans... He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there, alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way toward the barrier. \nPERSEUS Drop the barrier!                                          r \nAMOUN No! It's too late for her! \nPERSEUS Drop it, Amoun! At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: \"If you want to save her, come and get her.\" He hungrily rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPERSEUS Take the barrier down or I'll go through it! \nAMOUN Have you learned nothing? If you break out now, we're all at risk. On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh. Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love. \nPERSEUS I've learned one thing for certain! Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian. \nPERSEUS Get down! Perseus backs away three steps. To the others               -- \nPERSEUS Get ready to defend yourselves! Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around the humans. They have only a moment to react as the stunned Lotophagi come to their senses. \nDRACO Let's kill these freks! Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia. Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a look: \"You're the one that I want.\" They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges, thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape. Perseus rolls out of the way. Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO! Bloody spittle flies from his tongue. Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia and careens toward her, head bloody. Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back with both feet, knocking him over the edge. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque figure hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES. He slams into the dust, dead. Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When he tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the bloody puncture wounds. \nVIDALIA \n(SOOTHING) Okay... sshh... I've got you. A THUNDEROUS SOUND SURGES in the distance. Vidalia scans the horizon. \nDOWN BELOW Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won't last long. The earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted, looking around nervously. Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions. Riding them, DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking all but their blue eyes. They lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the beasts with HUGE PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing SCIMITARS to cut them down. \nATOP THE ROCKS in Vidalia's arms, the fading Perseus watches as the Djinn turn and surround the Expedition members, closing in. \nPERSEUS Vidalia... we need to help them... He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what \nSHE SEES: The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In his place, neck broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace -- King Acrisius. \nEXT. SIROQUE MOUNTAINS - DJINN CARAVAN - NIGHT \nA STRING OF LIGHTS, each a lantern hanging from a Scorpioch's tail. The Expedition members ride on the Scorpioch with the Djinn. Some of the huge scorpions carry small box/rooms (palanquins) on their backs. \nINT. PALANQUIN - NIGHT \nPerseus lies sprawled on cushions, unconscious. Vidalia replaces the dressing on his bite wound. Knowing he cannot hear her -- \nFORESIGHT) Yes. They have to take turns. If they all could see at once, they would be invincible, which one cannot risk in beings so grotesque. \nEXT. CAMP                                                   (SKOLOTHIA)                           - NIGHT \nThe Expedition sleeps in a drizzle. WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus. OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a strike. \nSPYROS Stay away from my boy! Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman over his head, where he lands hard with an \"UMPH!\" Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another charge. Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood; eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the \nWHISPERING. \nPERSEUS Spyros, he means me no harm. The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt. The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels before Perseus, head bowed. \nPERSEUS I hear you and I understand you. But I don't know how. \nSHAIKH SULEIMAN Moi ne epos ae'prositi, mene daeva. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPERSEUS You are praying to me? There must be a mistake. The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade, honoring Zeus. \nPERSEUS An offering'? I thank you and take it humbly, as agift from a friend, not an offering. He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the Shaikh. \nSHAIKH SULEIMAN Tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr. \nPERSEUS You honor my father? You honor Spyros? \nSHAIKH SULEIMAN Ho Zeus Patir... Zeus... Perseus reacts, taken aback to hear it from this mysterious stranger. \nEXT. MOIRAI PILLAR - NIGHT \nThe Expedition ascends the sheer pinnacle via rain-slick stairs and GROANING ROPE BRIDGES. \nEXT. SUMMIT OF MOIRAI PILLAR - SUNRISE \nIn a morning fog, the Expedition enters a circle of FREE- STANDING MONOLITHS white with bird crap. All around: regurgitated food, shredded garments and tiny human baby bones. A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are the NORN SISTERS: URD, VERDANDI, and SKULD -- human- sized owls with the gray faces of old crones                (Strix). Each has one central EYE SOCKET; they share one ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and pop it in to study the arrivals. \nURD (low, hoot-owl) Amoun... So sorry to see you again. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAMOUN Likewise, Urd. I seek your counsel. \nVERDANDI \n(SHRIEKING) You want us to tell you about Leviathan. \nAMOUN You know already... of course. \nVERDANDI We know this -- the Kraken cannot be defeated. \nSKULD \n(PIERCING) You've wasted a journey. I trust it was not a taxing one. The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the Eye back to Urd. Perseus watches with growing irritation. \nAMOUN Surely the beast from the sea has some weakness. You owe me this answer at least. \nURD The Sisters owe nothing to you or any Man! She tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention on Perseus. \nVERDANDI There's something wrong with that one. I don't like having him here. \nSKULD Let me take a look. Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix SCREECH. Perseus goes to the precipice. \nPERSEUS Tell us what we want to know or your Eye has seen its last. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The Norns flap their wings and puff up their feathers. \n(NODS) If ever I should meet him. (turns toward the \nVAULT) I need a light. The Shaikh holds a branch near his eyes until the end bursts into flame and hands it to Perseus, who disappears into the blackness. \nINT. VAULT OF THE NORN SISTERS - DAY \nPerseus fights through cobwebs and hanging roots. The torch REVEALS piles of armor, bones, and broken weapons. A round edge catches his eye. He pulls it free -- A SHIELD, TARNISHED AND DENTED. Unsure why it attracted him, he shoulders it and leaves. \nEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT \nThe STORM RAGES around a FLEET OF SHIPS, manned by armored CREWMEN, that rises and falls on hundred-foot mountains of water. \nEXT. DECK OF LEAD SHIP - NIGHT \nThe FIRST MATE shouts to the stalwart CAPTAIN. \nFIRST MATE Captain, the storm is too great! \nCAPTAIN Joppa is under siege! King Kepheus needs these supplies! Something huge breaches the surface. The captain squints through the rain... and sees the GIGANTIC SCUTED TAIL of Leviathan. IT GOES RIGHT PAST THEM, miraculously leaving the fleet untouched. But then -- they HEAR a sound BIGGER than the typhoon. The dark sky gets darker as an ENORMOUS BLACK SHAPE appears behind the Fleet, bearing down on them at impossible speed -- TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON so dwarfs the Fleet that it PLOWS THROUGH the other ships without noticing, obliterating them in seconds, sending all hands to the depths. \nEXT. TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON - PROW - CLOSE ON TIAMAT'S \nFRIGHTENING VISAGE - NIGHT Lit by FLASHES OF LIGHTNING. The Goddess smiles in satisfaction at the devastation. \nEXT. JETTY (THE TETHYS SEA) - DAY \nA bleak shore. A boulder jetty juts into the cold pewter sea and fades into the fog. Chunks of ice bob on the lapping waves. \nSUPERIMPOSE: THE TETHYS SEA...   12 DAYS REMAINING \nThe Expedition, miserably wet, waits for passage around a campfire on the frigid beach. Perseus, polishing the shield he got from the Norns, looks to Amoun, who sits smoking. \nPERSEUS Tell of the Gorgoneion. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAMOUN The Rape of Medusa? Everyone falls silent. The soldiers shift, suddenly nervous. \nTHAD With respect, Magi, do not recite that black tale. You'll bring the sky down upon us. \nSPYROS Does a fairy tale frighten you, soldier? Thad looks at him, sharply. \nDRACO Tell the story, sir. My men fear only one thing -- to let fear in their hearts. Mongke says something that means, \"Go ahead already.\" \nAMOUN Medusa was a tender young woman once -- a mortal creature of such rare beauty as to tempt even the Gods. One night, on the road home, she caught the eye of the God of Deserts and Entropy -- Set the Void. \nFLASHBACK - EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT \nA stunning beauty, YOUNG MEDUSA, carries a water pitcher. Suddenly, frightened, she turns, sees something, drops the pitcher and runs. \nAMOUN (V.0.) She hastened to hallowed ground, thinking the Goddess Tiamat would protect her in her temple. But the God Set followed. A SHADOW passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher, in pursuit. \nINT. TEMPLE OF TIAMAT - NIGHT \nIn the center of the dark hall, SET overtakes Medusa,        L. forcing her down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: His cloak ripples as SHAPES PUSH THROUGH THE SPECTRAL FOLDS -- the girl's reaching fingers, her screaming face. \nAMOUN (V.0.) He ravished her on the cold floor. She felt the heartless passion of a God. \nSAME SCENE - LATER Alone, Medusa crawls with bloody fingernails toward the altar. \nAMOUN (V.0.) Despoiled and broken in the shadow of Tiamat's altar, she prayed for comfort and pleaded for courage... But the Goddess of the Deep regarded Medusa with disdain. The prayers of such a frail and filthy mortal angered Tiamat. A bust of Tiamat chiseled from black crystal opens her BLAZING eyes, THROWING A LONG SHADOW OF MEDUSA onto the wall. \nAMOUN (V.0.) The Goddess twisted young Medusa into a loathsome new thing... The contorting shadow shows the transformation. Legs twist and snap and become a slithering tail. Snake heads wriggle from her skull. \nL \nEXT. GALLEY - UPPER DECK - DAY \nSpyros is at the rail, looking over the ocean of ice. Perseus, troubled, arrives. Spyros looks at him closely. \nPERSEUS What? \nSPYROS Nothing. \nPERSEUS What do you see? \nSPYROS A look I know well. \nPERSEUS From me? \nSPYROS Never before. \nPERSEUS Then where? Spyros smiles, puts his huge, calloused hand on Perseus' shoulder. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSPYROS In my own mirror, son. \nPERSEUS When does it go away? \nSPYROS If we're lucky... never. \nEXT. COAST OF TARTAROS - DAY \nA landscape of volcanic rock. Lava pouring into the sea raises VEILS OF STEAM, through which the Expedition disembarks from the galley. \nSUPERIMPOSE: COAST OF TARTAROS...                          10                                                          DAYS REMAINING \nEXT. TARTAROS - DAY \nThe Expedition crosses the black terrain, lava vents here or there. \nEXT. TEMPLE OF TARTAROS - LAVA FIELD - DAY \nIn the distance, dark ruins -- an ominous tilted facade, half-sunk in the dried lava flow. \nSHAIKH SULEIMAN Jaggous temploi Tartaros de Gorgoneion maitress. \nAMOUN The Temple of Tartaros... Medusa's lair. Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words and point. They all \nLOOK -- TWO STONE STATUES flank the entrance: a pair of enormous CENTAURS -- NESSUS and IXION, their eyelids sewn shut. Icos and Krikor exchange distressed looks. \nAMOUN Medusa must have turned them to stone. Perseus swings his sickle, measuring its balance, and adjusts his shield. He checks a canvas sack on his belt. \nPERSEUS I'm going into the Temple. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDRACO I am with you. \nSPYROS \n(STEPS FORWARD) I go with my boy. Perseus, Spyros, and Draco split off toward the temple. Suddenly, the two \"statues,\" Nessus and Ixion, shake off their dusty skins and COME TO LIFE. They GALLOP down the ridge, hooves shaking the ground. They raise fearsome spiky maces of jagged iron. Vidalia readies her sling. The Shaikh draws his scimitar. Mongke and Tamburlane load their handgonnes, the others draw swords. \nEXT. TEMPLE OF TARTAROS - PORTICO - DAY \nThe Temple group arrives at the steps. Draco speaks to \nPERSEUS \nDRACO Are you afraid? \nPERSEUS Of what? \nCONTINUED: \nKEPHEUS \n(SKEPTICAL) From your lips, I pray, to his true father's ear. Andromeda has appeared. All are shocked to see her. She addresses the others with an authority we've never seen. \nANDROMEDA I would speak with the King in private. \nMINISTER OF DEFENSE Princess, let us find a protected \nPLACE -- \nANDROMEDA We can speak here, in the elements our subjects endure. The King's men exchange looks, then bow discreetly away, leaving father and daughter alone. Andromeda looks down at the tent city. \nKEPHEUS They take refuge from the Lower Wharf. A sight I wish you'd never seen. \nANDROMEDA You've sheltered me too long from the hard things in this world. \nKEPHEUS I would have it no other way. \nANDROMEDA And I thank you for the gift of my cosseted youth. But now, with Mother so... (turns to him) It's time I shared this burden you've carried so long. Filled with emotion, he puts an arm around her. \nKEPHEUS You make me proud, but you are only a child... my little one. \nANDROMEDA No, no longer. Your protection of me has brought hardship to our people... \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANDROMEDA (CONT'D) and to me, perhaps, new understanding. I must ask you something, Father. She turns away from his gaze and looks down at the city. \nANDROMEDA If you could end this siege with just one unselfish act, would you do it? \nKEPHEUS To save my people, yes, of course. \nANDROMEDA Such an act is within my power. He studies her a moment, then becomes alarmed. \nKEPH EUS Stop itl I forbid you to entertain such thoughts. \nANDROMEDA Perseus and the others were willing to give everything. \nKEPHEUS (turns her to him) Listen to me. By the time this is over, your mother and I may well be gone. But I guarantee the day is coming when Joppa will know glory under Queen Andromeda. She embraces him, head upon his shoulder, where he can't see her resolve. \nANDROMEDA Be at peace, Father, I will not cause you any more sadness than I already have. \nEXT. OLIVE GROVES (ILLYRIA)   - MILESTONE - DAY \nAn ancient walled road curves over the pastoral orchard hills. \nSUPERIMPOSE: MILESTONE, HILLS OF ILLYRIA... 3 DAYS \nREMAINING The exhausted Expedition is now six: Perseus, Vidalia, Amoun, Spyros, Mongke, and Tamburlane. They've stopped at a well beside a MILESTONE. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Spyros studies the ancient words carved into the milestone: \"Polis of JOVE PATER : XI stadia S.\" \nSPYROS Eleven stadia to the South... What is 'Polis of Jove Pater'? I'm ignorant of this. \nAMOUN Jove the Father is another name by which Zeus was known. This milestone dates from when city states were named for their patron deities. Perseus, filling his canteen, peers at the marker as Amoun uses one hand to cover the letters \"-VE\" and the other the letters \"-TER.\" \nAMOUN 'The Polis of Jove Pater' is the ancient name of -- \nPERSEUS -- Joppa. \nAMOUN Yes, Joppa... once the most sacred site in the worship of Jove. \nPERSEUS (dawning on him) Tiamat chooses the city of Zeus to take hostage. (as Amoun confirms \nFANTASOS We invoke thee, Queen of the Deep. We attend thee only to listen and obey. Fantasos moves through smoke to an altar, on which is a fearsome IDOL OF TIAMAT, unlike any representation we've seen. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFANTASOS We serve your will so that we may be absorbed into your perfection... Holy of holies... Tiamat! The Sanctuary is suddenly filled with the VOICE of -- \nTIAMAT                                                      (V.0.) Loyal servants... it may be an illusion, but the Idol seems to have taken on the most subtle of life. It does not move, but it breathes. \nTIAMAT (V.0.) You have sown the seeds of revolt. Now comes the harvest. My legions stand ready at the gates. Only one rite of consecration remains before the Ascension. Fantasos, closest to the Idol, flinches, buffeted by an unseen draft. \nTIAMAT                                                      (V.0.) The hour of sacrifice is upon us. Offer up the Princess Andromeda to Leviathan. \nINT. THE BASILICA - ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT \nA GONG sounds ONCE in the night. Repheus sleeps fitfully on a divan by the bed of the desiccated Cassiopeia. \nINT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT \nThe GONG sounds again. CLOSE ON Andromeda's tortured face staring down at the city -- too CLOSE to see exactly where she is. \nEXT. THE BASILICA - BACK GATE - NIGHT \nThe GONG sounds a THIRD TIME. Peshet opens a lock and sets the heavy gate ajar. She looks at the dagger in her palm and hurries inside. After a moment, four CLOAKED REBELS slip through the open gate. \nINT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS.- NIGHT \nL Peshet enters, dagger held at her back. No sign of Andromeda. \nPESHET My lady? Princess Andromeda? She goes deeper into the rooms, then GASPS, looking off, \nALARMED -- Andromeda stands on the balustrade of her balcony, preparing to jump to her death. She turns at the sound, teetering. Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a knife of her own. Peshet is shocked, not afraid. \nANDROMEDA Peshet, stop! I know what I am meant to do. \nPESHET My lady, please -- \nANDROMEDA I was afraid, Peshet. Afraid to understand that the fate of so many could rest with me. \nPESHET Princessa, give me your hand. Andromeda, please. Please. \nANDROMEDA (looks at the drop) I'm not afraid anymore. I will do what I must. I will die so that they may live. \nR She turns, but Peshet leaps and grabs her, pulling her to safety. They fall to the floor, both daggers CLATTERING on the marble. \nPESHET I won't allow it, my lady. Today, you are only a Princess. One day your people may need a Queen ready to die for them. Peshet snatches up the dagger from where she dropped it. \nPESHET                                                      C Come, we have to hide you... right now. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: She stops, picks up Andromeda's knife and hands it to       s her.

A VOICE from the darkness: \nAGENOR (O.S.) Your father is dead and your mother has been relieved of her suffering. The four Cloaked Rebels step into the light. Agenor wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance. \nAGENOR The Princessa is coming with us. She has a rendezvous to keep. Peshet WHIPS HER DAGGER through the air; it THUDS into the neck of the First Rebel, killing him on his feet. Before he can fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her knife. She plants herself in front of Andromeda. \nPESHET Come and get her. Agenor and the other two circle Peshet. She moves with feline agility, but is separated from the Princess. To the Second Rebel -- \nAGENOR Take the Princess -- alive! The Second Rebel circles around Peshet toward Andromeda. \nPESHET Run, Princess! Save yourself. Peshet leaps on the Third Rebel. Andromeda runs away from the Second Rebel, who easily closes the gap. \nSPYROS The sacrifice has begun. \nPERSEUS I must get to the cliffs! \nSPYROS How? They all look at what separates them from the city -- \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY \nThe MONSTER ARMY OF TIAMAT surges forward with savage \nBATTLE CRIES. The GATES OF THE CITY swing open. Out march the giant mechanical AUTOMATA, followed by streaming legions of JOPPAN INFANTRY. The two armies slam together -- The battle is joined. THEY FIGHT. \nEXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY \nGONG! The wind rocks Andromeda on her CREAKING CHAIN. She watches... A mile offshore, a BULGE OF WATER SWELLS and plows toward the coast. The Onlookers watch in terrified awe as the swell races closer. Leviathan explodes from the surface, too huge to be seen whole. It shoots straight up, up, up the three-hundred- foot cliffs. The Kraken's jaws hurtle up at Andromeda. Onlookers recoil. Fantasos stumbles in panicked retreat. The creature's BELLOW is deafening. At the apex of its surge, it SNAPS ITS JAWS SHUT with a booming THUNDERCRACK... just millimeters from Andromeda's dangling head -- and FALLS BACK. Churning surf surrounds its endless SLIDE back down. \nANDROMEDA'S POV The Kraken slips underwater and its vast shadow immediately begins to circle wide for another attempt. \nEXT. WOODED RIDGE                                           - DAY \nSpyros, Mongke and Tamburlane mount their nervous horses. PUSH IN ON Perseus, who does not mount up. From his saddle, he takes the bloody canvas bag with Medusa's head inside and slaps his horse away. Be MURMURS the INCANTATION Vidalia planted in his mind. \nFLASHES OF WHAT PERSEUS SEES A white lid opens to a black eye... Feathered WINGS beat the air... The rippled flanks of a WHITE CREATURE. \nBACK TO SCENE Perseus HEARS the BEATING OF THE WINGS and looks toward the forest. PEGASUS WHOOSHES over the treetops, BANKS and LANDS in front of Perseus. It bows, inviting Perseus aboard. Perseus climbs on and rides up to the others, who are flabbergasted. \nPERSEUS May we all have a good ride today! He spurs Pegasus. it beats its wings, launching from the ridge with astounding power. \nMONGKE AND TAMBURLANE Qi chin yang hung xian! \nSPYROS No shit. They raise their weapons and spur their horses down the slope to war. \nEXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY \nCLICK-CLACK-CLICK-CLACK. The chain lowers Andromeda toward the sea. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Andromeda manages to get herself swinging back and forth until she builds enough momentum to reach up and grasp the links above her. With effort, she climbs the very chain she dangles from, leaving a slack loop beneath. Leviathan's eyes break the surface below, watching Andromeda. With a HOWL, Leviathan HURTLES UPWARDS, jaws wide. \nFROM ABOVE - ANDROMEDA Leviathan grows huge as it leaps for her. UP, UP, UP. The JAWS SNAP CLOSED... just below her climbing feet. So close, it BITES ON THE DROOPING SLACK OF CHAIN! The monster slides back down, clutching the chain in its jaws. The Princessa plummets with it. \nUP ON THE PLATFORM The chain unreels wildly, pulls tight... and rips the platform from its anchors. It careens over the edge, taking Fantasos, Agenor and their Thugs to their screaming death. A SHADOW glides over the shocked onlookers. One by one, they tear their gaze from the sea and look up, GASPING \nAT -- PERSEUS AND PEGASUS descending. Perseus sees Andromeda splash down and get pulled under. The winch platform SLAMS into the cliff face, pulled by Leviathan. \nPERSEUS' DIVING POV Exactly the image he saw when Vidalia first planted the spell in his mind -- down, down toward the dark sea. \nBACK TO SCENE Perseus and Pegasus arrive a moment before the crashing winch. Perseus dives off with the bloody Medusa bag in hand. With his free hand, he catches the chain just ahead of the winch and goes under. \nEXT. UNDERSEA - DAY \nLeviathan hurtles downward. Andromeda flails, bound to the chain. \nFAR ABOVE Perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand. Leviathan spirals on, but THE WINCH CATCHES ON A REEF and the chain SNAPS! Andromeda, suddenly separated from the monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles. Perseus, swimming with the raw power of a porpoise, dives after her, but loses his grip on the bag. Desperate, he looks back and forth: Andromeda, the sack -- both sinking. Perseus goes after the sack. Leviathan realizes it has lost the Princess. Huge eyes darting, it spots Andromeda and surges down after her. Andromeda, drowning, passes out. Tiny bubbles leak from her nose. Leviathan swims down to her, eye as big as her entire body. The wreck of a SUNKEN WHALER rests on the ocean floor. The Medusa sack FALLS INTO VIEW and catches on a harpoon wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and is about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the harpoon. Leviathan opens its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked toward the maw. Perseus swims upward toward Leviathan's tail. Perseus concentrates -- a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY shoots through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip. LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the harpoon in the Kraken's tail -- -- at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious Andromeda. Contact -- an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge races up Leviathan's spine. Jolted, the monster spits Andromeda out. The Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus. Perseus shuts his eyes and yanks Medusa's head from the sack. Medusa's hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling energy into Leviathan's enormous eyeballs -- hardening them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The monster thrashes, tries to turn -- but unbending stone races its length, freezing the gargantuan curves -- the scuted tail locks mid-flail into a final, permanent hook. Dead in the water, the grotesque mass sinks like a mountain range, picking up speed as it plunges into the \nABYSS                                                       -- Perseus must swim like a God to snatch Andromeda from the downward tug. The stone Kraken barely misses them as it \nDROPS -- -- and CRASHES in a cloud of silt, SHAKING THE OCEAN FLOOR like an earthquake. A CRACK opens in the seabed and sucks back the silt. The trench deepens and streaks away across the seabed, swallowing all the water above it, creating a giant opening to the sky. \nEXT.

A loud BANGING sound pierces the hubbub, and the officers quiet, turning to -- KING ACRISIUS, a striking man in his prime, his handsome face marked by one crooked scar on his jaw. He commands the room -- \nKING ACRISIUS Now we end the debate about tactics... and begin to plan for victory. \nAT THE BACK OF THE HALL The Dog stares at the King. Then slips away. \nINT.

Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to leave the promontory.

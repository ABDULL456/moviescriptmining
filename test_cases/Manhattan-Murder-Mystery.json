{"train": "MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY \nScreenplay by \nWoody Allen & Marshall Brickman \nNOTE \nMost of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand- held camera or a Steadycam. These very mobile cameras move around the set, and get constantly closer and further from the characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such as \u00ablong shot\u00bb or \u00abfull shot\u00bb or \u00abmedium shot\u00bb here and there to give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements of the camera. \nTRISTAR LOGO Winged white horse flying over clouds \nBLACK SCREEN \nCREDITS IN WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK SCREEN \nWe hear jazz music during the credits. \nEND OF CREDITS \nNEW-YORK - AERIAL VIEW - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nWhile the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the jazz music. \nThe camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and starts moving around the building. \nHOCKEY GAME - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLong shot on the skating rink. A hockey game is in progress on the rink. The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience. \nThe camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in their early fifties. Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol seems to find it boring. She looks at the ceiling, and then puts her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn. Larry turns toward her. \nLARRY Come on. \nCAROL What? \nLARRY You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you next week. \nCAROL I know, honey, I promised. I know. \nLARRY I already bought the earplugs. \nCAROL Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see the puck. \nThe crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has done something really good. Carol mockingly claps her hands. \nCAROL Yay, hooray. \nThen she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than ever. \nLARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT \nA nice-looking apartment building in New-York. \nFull shot of the lobby. We see the street through the glass door. An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is writing on a book. \nLarry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the building. He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a newspaper, the \u00abDaily News\u00bb. \nLARRY God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out. \nCAROL Yeah. \nThe attendant slightly turns around and bows to them. They bow back to him. He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple keeps on walking through the lobby. \nLARRY You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later. \nCAROL know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve victims, dismembered them and ate them. \nLARRY Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle. \nCAROL Yeah, I'll say. \nThey reach the two elevators. Larry presses the call-button on the wall between the two elevators. \nLARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium shot inside the cabin of the elevator. The inner door slides open. Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper. Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel. \nPAUL (voice over) Hold the elevator. \nLILLIAN (voice over) I'm coming. \nHearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the door to keep it from closing. \nPAUL (voice over) Hold the elevator. \nPaul and Lilian enter the elevator. They are a middle-aged couple. He is bald and tall, and very smily. She is small, with grey hair. \nLILLIAN That's right. \nPAUL Thank you. \nLilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol. The elevator door slides shut. Lilian looks at Carol. \nLILLIAN I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes. \nCAROL Oh, you do ? \nLILLIAN Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall. \nCAROL Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline. LILLIAN It's important to put that time in. It does wonders. \nCAROL Oh god, yeah. I agree with you. \nLILLIAN Exercising changed my life. \nCAROL Well, geez... \nLARRY I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person. \nPAUL We bought a treadmill last week. \nCAROL Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it because it was just taking up too much space. LILLIAN Oh, it-it-it... \nLARRY Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while. That was her problem. \nLILLIAN Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never gonna get that. \nLARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT \nFull shot of a very sober and modern hallway. Creme-colored walls, grey carpeting, dark wooden doors. \nWe hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by Lilian, Larry and Paul. They all talk together and we can hardly understand the following dialogue. \nCAROL Oh, I know. It's late. \nLILLIAN It's so wonderful, meeting. \nCAROL Oh, well, yeah. \nPAUL It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never meet them... You guys... \nThe following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand it better. \nLILLIAN ... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know... and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo. \nPAUL Well, anyway... good night. \nLarry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near the elevator. \nCAROL (voice over) Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that... \nPaul bends down to pick up something on the carpet. Lilian walks one step in Larry's direction. \nCAROL Brown. \nLILLIAN Oh. PAUL Nice color. \nThey all laugh. \nLILLIAN Paul never attended college. He's self-made. \nPAUL Always regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then money. \nLarry puts his cup down on the low table. \nLARRY You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just... \nLILLIAN And, do you work ? \nLarry stands up. \nCAROL Huh ? Do I ? \nLILLIAN Yes. \nLarry looks at Carol and sits back on the sofa. \nCAROL Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency, but that was many years ago. \nThe camera moves closer to Carol and Larry. \nCAROL But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me out of it. \nLARRY Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal position and have you in bed screaming for a month. \nCAROL He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic food. \nLILLIAN My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything with fat. \nCAROL Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to exercise for a month to work it off. LILLIAN Yeah. \nPAUL (voice over) We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary. \nCAROL No, really ? \nThe camera moves around, away from Larry and Carol, to Paul. \nLILLIAN (voice over) Yes. Twenty-eight years. November. \nCAROL (voice over) Really ? \nPAUL Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ? \nThe camera moves around backward, away from Paul and back to Larry and Carol. \nLILLIAN We already have twin cemetery plots. \nLARRY Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste. You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs. \nCAROL Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them. \nLARRY Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even know her size. I'm going over. Carol bursts out laughing. \nBlack screen. Actually, we are in : \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nCarol and Larry's apartment is quite different from the one we've just left. It is the apartment of a couple of New-York intellectuals, with nice, artistic furniture. We hear a door opening. \nLARRY Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little longer in there ? \nLights are switched on. \nFull shot. We see only part of the hall, the camera being in a corridor, and the walls of the corridor concealing part of the hall. Carol enters the apartment, and Larry holds the door for her. \nLARRY I was signaling you frantically. \nLarry closes the door. \nCAROL I was just trying to be neighborly. \nLARRY Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you know, look at canceled postage. \nThe camera follows Larry walking in the corridor toward : \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nActually there are two large beds in the bedroom, the room being divided by a partition set between the two beds. The partition is only a half wall. There is a opening, without door, at each end of the partition, to go from one section of the room to the other. \nCAROL (voice over) Oh, come on, Larry. It was sweet. They, you know, they're looking forward to their anniversary. \nMedium shot of Larry taking his jacket off. He puts it on a chair. \nLARRY Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie. I don't know why they put it on so late. \nThe camera turns back to the corridor and Carol, still in the front hall. \nCAROL You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ? \nLARRY (voice over) What ? \nCarol walks in the corridor, toward the bedroom. \nCAROL Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you know... \nShe walks into the bedroom. \nLARRY (voice over) We are a dull aging couple. \nCAROL Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery plots ? \nLarry is seated on his bed. Carol looks at some pills bottles on the night table. \nLARRY No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the San Andrea's Fault. \nCAROL How often do you think they make love ? \nShe goes out of the main part of the room, and the camera follows her. \nShe sits down on the other bed and starts taking her shoes off. \nLARRY (voice over) Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You know, I'm sure as much as once a week. \nCAROL Larry ? \nLARRY (voice over) I'm exhausted. What ? \nCAROL Do you still find me attractive ? \nLARRY (voice over) Of course. What kind of question is that ? Of course I do. \nCarol stands up from the bed and moves across the room. The camera, still located in the main part of the room, follows Carol, so we don't actually see her walking, but we see the partition and the large clock on it. CAROL (voice over from behind the partition) Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old shoes, are we ? Do you think ? \nCarol reappears on the other side of the partition. \nLARRY (voice over) Never comfortable. \nCAROL No ? \nLarry's head appears in the forefront of the shot. He is still seated on the bed. \nLARRY I don't think you have to worry about that. \nMARKET PLACE - EXTERIOR DAY \nLong shot on a large outdoor antique market place in New-York. The camera pans along the stands in the market, showing sellers and customers. \nLARRY Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night. We just met them. W-We had... They invited us in for coffee. \nTALL NEIGHBOR Such a... S... Such a nice lady. \nOLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR Nice lady. \nNEIGHBOR WITH A MOUSTACHE Sweet person. \nNEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nFull shot on the entrance of Larry's building. Larry and Carol are coming out. They are very elegantly dressed, Larry wearing a suit and a necktie. \nCAROL God, okay. \nLARRY You look wonderful. \nPaul is coming down the street toward the entrance of the building. He is carrying some grocery in a paper bag. \nCAROL Oh, hallo. \nPAUL Hi. \nCAROL Hi, Mr. House, so... sorry. \nPAUL Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers. \nPaul seems very relax. He smiles a lot, which could be surprising, when we understand he put his wife in the grave only a couple of days ago. \nCAROL Oh. \nPAUL It was quite nice of you. \nCAROL That's... sure. \nLARRY If there's anything we can do. You know, anything you need, just tell us and we'll... \nCAROL No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she seemed so... God, well, healthy. \nLARRY Yeah. \nPAUL She had a heart condition. \nCAROL She did ? She never mentioned it... It... that she was... \nLARRY Ah. \nPAUL She wouldn't have. \nCAROL No. Right. Well... LARRY If there's anything we can do. \nCAROL Yeah, anything. Really. \nLARRY You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by. You know. \nPAUL Thank you. You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert. \nCAROL Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I haven't forgotten. \nPAUL Well, have a nice time. You seem all gussied up. \nCAROL Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera. PAUL Oh, enjoy. \nLARRY My favorite, my favorite. \nPAUL Goodnight. \nHe walks away toward the entrance of the building, still smiling a lot and looking very happy. Carol looks at him with a question on her face. \nLARRY Goodnight. \nCAROL Goodnight. \nLARRY Come, we're gonna be late. \nTHE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nLong shot on the Met building. \nWe hear the music from Wagner's The Flying Dutchman. \nThe camera slowly tilts down. We don't see Carol and Larry yet, but we hear their voices. \nCAROL (voice over) The deal was, I sit through the ice hockey game and you watch the whole opera. \nThe camera is now on ground level, and we see Carol and Larry coming out of the Met. LARRY I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to get the urge to conquer Poland. \nThey cross the esplanade in front of the Met. \nELAINE'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nElaine's is a cosy place, like there are many around Greenwich Village. \nCarol and Larry are eating at Elaine's with Sy, Marilyn and Ted. Ted is a quite handsome man in his forties. \nWe get a medium full view of the party, with a very mobile camera moving around the table and going from one person to another, getting closer to one person, then moving slightly away. \nSY I'll tell you something. I think it's weird. I mean, listen to this. One night she's having coffee, and the next night they are carrying her out in a rubber bag. \nCAROL Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready to go. \nTED Maybe this guy killed her, you know ? Like, he's got, like, a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something. \nLARRY No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage stamps. He's a-a boring old... \nTED Well, I can see that. Yeah, depending on whose picture is on the stamp. \nCAROL She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition. \nLARRY Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs. House and I have a bad heart. \nCAROL Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy in the first five minutes. \nSY It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is to talk about a heart condition. \nTED You said she liked... she liked eating high cholesterol desserts. Is that what you said ? LARRY So, she had one too many. \nCAROL No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets. \nLARRY So she wasn't on a diet. But... \nTED This would be a really great way to kill somebody. \nSY How ? \nTED You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate mousse, butter. They go like that. \nCarol is laughing very heartily at Ted's joke. \nSY That's great. \nLARRY I like a... It's disgusting. \nTED you know what I mean ? \nLARRY It's disgusting, but a... It's fatal. \nTED Wouldn't that be great ? \nMARILYN I'd like to French-pastry myself to death right now. \nSY I'll help you. \nMARILYN I really would. \nCAROL Yeah, I know. \nLARRY Let me speak to him, all right ? \nCAROL What? Oh. Here. Just a sec. Here's Larr... \nShe gives the handset to Larry. LARRY Hey, listen. She was not murdered. She... she had a heart attack. It was a coronary. There was a doctor there. He said to.... He was an old man. \nRESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose shot on Ted, drinking from a mug. \nTED How do you know it was a real doctor ? \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLARRY I'm not gonna touch that. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. Look... \nRESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium shot of Ted. \nTED Wait-wait-wait a minute, wait a minute, put Carol back on, I called about something else. Listen, I know a great location for a restaurant. \nNEW-YORK - A YARD - EXTERIOR DAY \nA yard in the middle of old New-York buildings. \nThe camera is located at the inner end of the passage leading from the street to the yard. We gets a full shot of Carol and Ted coming from the street and walking toward us and the yard. \nTED Hah, look at this. Isn't this great ? CAROL Well, it's dark. \nTED Aren't these walls great ? A cave, you know, like you have to go through a little cave. \nCAROL Oh, I see. \nTED And then you come out, to this here. \nThey have reached the yard. The camera moves back to get a medium shot of them both. \nCAROL Oh, look at this though. It's really so beautiful. \nTED Yeah. Isn't it great ? CAROL But... it's kind out of the way for a restaurant, isn't it ? \nTED No, no... that's the appeal. That's just the appeal, because it's... it's, I mean it's so romantic... tucked away back in here like this. \nThe camera leaves Carol and Ted in the middle of the yard and moves up and around to show us the old building around the yard. \nCAROL (voice over) Yeah. \nTED (voice over) And, you don't want street traffic. You want... \nCAROL (voice over) No. \nTED (voice over) you want a little out of the way spot that people hear about and lovers go to. \nCAROL (voice over) Yeah. \nTED (voice over) It takes months to take a reservation, you know ? Very few tables. \nThe camera moves down to ground level to give us a better view of the yard. It does look a bit neglected, with weeds growing in between the stones covering the ground. There are some trees and a small out-of-order fountain with a statue on top of it. CAROL (voice over) You know, you've really thought this out. \nTED (voice over) Oh, well, I used to come here all the time with-with July, when we were married. \nCAROL (voice over) Uh uh. Right. \nThe camera moves back to Carol and Ted. \nTED Used to walk around here. Really beautiful at night. It's gorgeous at night. \nCAROL It's beautiful, I bet. \nTED I used to think, \u00abWhat am I doing here with July ? We don't love each other any more\u00bb, you know ? It made the moment doubly poignant. \nPAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium shot of the corridor, showing the front door. Paul opens the front door. Larry and Carol are standing in the doorway. Larry is wearing a necktie and Carol is carrying a large tray. \nPAUL Hi. How are you ? \nCAROL Hi. How are you ? \nPAUL Oh, my... \nCAROL These are my floating islands. I hope you like meringue. \nPaul takes the tray from Carol's hands. \nPAUL I love it. Come on in, come on in. \nCAROL Well, okay. \nPAUL This is unbelievable. \nCarol enters the apartment, followed by Larry. \nCAROL I know, it's just... \nPAUL Did you do it ? Larry closes the door behind him. \nCAROL I did do it. I told you. Anyway, this has got... this is vanilla sauce here and I put little chocolate truffles. \nPAUL Well, come on in. \nCAROL Do you like chocolate truffles ? \nPAUL Would you share it with me ? \nLARRY Oh, no. She made these just for you. This is... \nCAROL Oh, well... PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThey all enter the living room. \nPAUL No, no, no, it's too much for one. I'll I make some coffee. Please. \nLARRY They're only half a dozen. \nCAROL No, no, no. Look, I'll make the coffee. That'd be better. Let me make it. \nPAUL Oh, you've already done so much. \nCAROL No, no. I insist, I insist. Go on, sit down, relax. \nShe takes the tray from Paul's hands. \nPAUL Aren't you nice. \nCAROL Enjoy yourself, you've been through enough. \nShe walks to the kitchen, carrying the tray. \nLARRY She worked on those for... How're you holding up ? \nPAUL Oh, I don't know. I was thinking after a while. I'd get away from here. From this place and all its memories. LARRY Uh uh, so you have someone to go with, or are you... \nPAUL I have a brother in Florida. \nLARRY Oh, really ? \nPAUL I'm hoping he can get away for a while. \nLARRY Good. It's a good idea. \nCAROL Hey, I'm not tired. \nLARRY What do you mean, \u00abYou're not tired\u00bb ? \nCAROL You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home, tomorrow. \nLARRY Great. CAROL You know what I mean ? I mean, I don't understand why you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be living next door to a murderer, Larry. \nLARRY Well, New York is a melting pot. You know, get used to it. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLater in the night. \nMedium shot on the bed. Larry is asleep, but Carol is not. She moves in the bed, and then sits up. She turns around, pats her pillow, and tries to lie back on her side. But she sits up again, looking around the room. Eventually, she gets out of the bed. \nShe walks around the bed in the dark, and switches on the lights in the corridor. The camera follows her in the corridor. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT Carol switches the lights on in the hall, then she looks into the peephole in the front door. \nCAROL Oh my God ! \nThe camera turns around toward the corridor. Larry is getting out of the bedroom, putting his slippers on. \nLARRY Hey, are you okay ? \nCarol walks in the corridor toward him. \nCAROL Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. I-I-I heard a noise in the hallway, so I just... I... You know, I-I looked and I think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator. \nLarry hops toward her, still trying to put his slippers on. She backs up and they are now both in the front hall. \nLARRY Yeah ? You're sure ? \nCAROL Yeah, you know, I was... I'm-I'm... almost certain that it was him. \nLARRY So-So-So what ? \nCAROL Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be ? \nLARRY So what ? It's not a crime. He can get on the elevator. CAROL I know. I know. But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the morning ? \nLARRY Oh, Jesus. I was in a deep sleep. What-What's the difference ? \nCAROL But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm saying ? A joke ? \nWhile Larry is answering her, Carol opens the front door and peeks into the hallway. \nLARRY All right, so it was Mr. House. So he got on the elevator. It's not a felony. The guy pays rent. He's entitled. I mean, what... Can you go back to bed ? This is crazy. You woke me up out of a deep sleep. I gotta get up early tomorrow morning. \nCarol closes the door, and walks toward the kitchen. The camera follows her. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nCarol looks through a notebook. \nCAROL I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home. \nLARRY (voice over) You're gonna ring Mr. House, now ? \nCAROL Yes, because this is really... \nLARRY (voice over) What are you talking about ? \nCAROL It's very sus... \nLarry joins Carol when she already has the handset in her hand. But she succeeds in dialing Paul's number. \nLARRY Don't ring Mr... What are you doing ? No, don't ring... \nCAROL Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait. \nLARRY Don't ring Mr. house. This is a widower. Leave the poor guy alone. You're crazy. Stop it. Carol listens to the phone. \nCAROL That's one ring. \nLARRY So you saw him go out. It's not a-not a crime. \nCAROL Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet. \nLarry takes the handset from Carol's hand. \nLARRY Give me this. Give me this. \nCAROL What are you doing ? \nLARRY Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call downstairs. Call the-the-the person at the desk. CAROL All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing. \nLARRY Ask if someone went out. \nCAROL Keep ringing. \nLARRY Yeah, um. Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing. You got it. \nWhile Carol walks out of the kitchen, Larry puts the phone back on its hook on the wall. \nCAROL Oh, man. \nCarol walks into the hall. The camera follows her. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLARRY (voice over) This is insane. What's gotten into you ? \nCarol picks up the building internal telephone handset from the wall. \nCAROL I don't know. What is he doing ? Where is this guy at one- thirty in the morning ? You know what I'm saying ? \nLARRY (voice over) It's not your business. He can go any place he wants. \nCAROL (in the phone) Hallo ? Yes, hallo. This is Mrs. Lipton. Yes. Did anybody just leave the building ? I'm just... hmm. You're sure ? You're sure no one ? No, okay. All right. Yes. Thank you. \nWhile she was talking on the phone, the camera has moved toward Larry, standing at the entrance of the kitchen. \nLARRY Okay. Are you happy ? \nWe hear the noise of the phone being put back on its hook. \nCAROL I don't believe this. Man, I don't get it. \nLarry joins his wife in the hall. \nLARRY Now, can we back to bed ? \nCAROL No. LARRY For crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a mystery where nothing exists. \nCAROL Just let me think about this a second. Okay, I got it. Wait. I know, it... No, wait. Listen to me. Larry... Listen. He got on the elevator, okay ? \nLARRY You know, I'm gonna... \nCAROL No, wait. No, no, listen to this. No. \nLARRY I wanna go to sleep. I don't want to be standing here in the middle of the night. \nCAROL I know. Larry, he got on the elevator and he took it to the basement. \nLARRY Oh, great ! Great ! So what ? Now, what've you got ? \nCAROL He has a car, right ? He's got the garage door key, he opened... he could... he has the... \nLARRY So what ? So what ? \nCAROL What do you mean, \u00abso what\u00bb ? He's... \nLARRY Yeah, that's great. \nPAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThey both start searching the room frenetically. While Larry looks on the desk, Carol searches the rest of the room, even kneeling on the floor. \nCAROL (WHISPERING) Come over here. I put'em... um... right here. Right in here somewhere. The first... Wait. I should... (to Paul, with a much louder voice) Uh, how-How are you doing in there ? You need... \nLarry drops things on the floor. With a nervous gesture, Carol shushes him. \nCAROL You need any help ? \nThe camera pans to the kitchen, where Paul is preparing the dessert. \nPAUL No, I'm fine. I'll be right in. CAROL (voice over) Um... Okay, great. \nThe camera pans back to the living room, where Larry is still nervously messing things on the desk. Then he starts moving around the room, looking for his wife's glasses. Carol puts things back in order on the desk. Larry walks to her, and whisper something we can't understand. \nLARRY (to Paul, with a louder voice) Are you okay ? Can-can-can-can we do anything for you ? \nPAUL (voice over from the kitchen) Coffee or tea ? \nCAROL Tea. It's what... I'd like to have some tea. \nPaul walks into the room, with a pair of glasses in his hand. \nPAUL You know, I found your glasses. \nCAROL Mine ? \nPAUL These are yours, aren't they ? \nCAROL Yes. \nLARRY No. \nCAROL Uh, no. Yeah. Uh... No no no no no. They... They... Oh, God. \nCarol and Larry both look very nervous. Carol takes the glasses from Paul's hand. \nLARRY No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually. They are, aren't they ? These-These-These ones, are. \nCAROL They are actually... They're mine. Honey, they're mine. I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I must have left them here. It's the strangest thing. \nPAUL Did you ? I didn't notice that. \nCAROL No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ? \nCarol and Larry both look very embarrassed. Paul looks at them with a slight surprised eye. \nLARRY At your mother's house. \nCAROL That's right. Of course, so... \nShe turns toward Paul, who has remained very calm. \nPAUL That mousse looks fabulous. \nCAROL Anyway, it's so good. I love mousse. \nPAUL Thank you very much. \nCAROL Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in the Caribbean ? PAUL Very much. Very much. \nCAROL Uh uh. \nPAUL That's funny. I found those glasses under my bed. \nCAROL That's because I must have dropped them and they probably got kicked under. \nLARRY Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop... \nCAROL They were just... \nLARRY She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around the house. \nCAROL They f... \nPAUL The mousse ? \nHe walks away to the kitchen, with a strange smile on his face. \nLARRY She's always-She's always kick... \nCarol looks at Larry with a meaning look, to make him stop rambling. CAROL Anyway, I'd love to have some mousse. \nLARRY Yes, really ? Remember there was the time you kicked the mousse under the bed in the house. Remember that ? It was... \nCarol walks away toward the kitchen. \nCAROL I remember. \nLARRY It took-took six months to get the... \nNEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nMedium full shot of Carol waiting under the awning of a place (hotel or club) called the \u00abFive Hundred\u00bb. She hears a car stopping and she looks at the street. TED (voice over) Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic's murder. \nCarol runs to the car. \nCAROL I know, but where... where are we going ? \nTED (voice over from inside the car) I looked up, looked up Helen Moss in the phone book. \nCarol climbs into the car and closes the door. \nCAROL (voice over from inside the car) Yeah. \nTED (voice over from inside the car) It was just H. Moss. \nCAROL (voice over from inside the car) Right. \nTED (voice over from inside the car) So I-it's on Bank Street... \nThe car drives away, with Ted's voice fading as the car gets away from us. \nTED (voice over from inside the car) Bank Street... we're going to go down and do surveillance. I got a lot whole of food. It's great. I called up this... I called this number. \nNEW-YORK - BANK STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nFull view of the corner of two very quiet streets. A brick building covered with vines. The camera pans away from the building to Ted's car parked on the other side of the street corner. Medium shot of the inside of the car, through the open window on the passenger's side, Carol's side. \nTED There's her house. \nCAROL Right. So we should just sit here and wait, huh ? \nTED Yeah. \nCAROL Okay. \nThey look at each other and laugh. \nSlightly later. Medium shot through the windshield. The view is a little blurred by the daylight reflection on the windshield. \nTED Maybe he thought that if he, if he, if he divorced her, she'd-she'd hit him for a ton of alimony. Or maybe she, maybe she controls the family fortune. What do you think of that ? \nCAROL Oh, I don't know. Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted. Maybe we're just, you know... I mean, maybe she died of natural causes, like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little shot of adrenaline. \nTed looks through the paper food-bag he has brought with him. \nTED Does yours ? I'll tell you, mine needs something. \nCAROL Yeah? What's that, there ? \nPAUL (voice over) Well, we only show revivals now. This week, we have Fred Astaire. Next week, we have an Orson Welles festival. HELEN (voice over) Oh, yeah ? \nPAUL (voice over) Yeah, it'll be about the last thing we do before we start renovating. \nThe camera keeps on panning around the room. \nHELEN (voice over) Mm. Oh, Paul, I... \nPAUL (voice over) Oh, come on, there's nobody around. \nWe hear moaning and kissing sounds. \nHELEN (voice over) I-I... \nPAUL (voice over) Come on. \nHELEN (voice over) Okay. \nPAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY \nFull shot of the backstage behind the screen. In a corner, a stairway going to the top of the backstage. Half-hidden on the stairway, Carol and Ted. \nHELEN (voice over) I've never been behind a movie screen before like this. \nPAUL (voice over) Strange, isn't it ? \nHELEN (voice over) Yeah. \nPAUL (voice over) Used to be a first-run house when the neighborhood was better. \nThe camera pans to the back of the screen, in front of which Paul and Helen are standing. \nHELEN Oh. \nPAUL Beautiful, huh ? Look around. \nHELEN All these mirrors. \nThe camera pans around the room, where a lot of huge mirrors are stacked. PAUL Huh ? Well, it used to be all mirrors, and it was quite beautiful. \nThe camera tilts down to give us a closer shot on the mirrors. \nPAUL (voice over) I'm having all this broken glass replaced as we go along with this renovation. You know, they used to have stage shows, here. Now, of course, we only show old movies. \nThe camera tilts back up on Paul and Helen. \nHELEN It has such a lonely feeling. \nPAUL That's because I'm the only one here. And my assistant, Mrs. Dalton. I'm gonna have this place fixed up, then I'm gonna sell it. The money's gonna come in handy. HELEN It sure will. \nPaul looks around, a bit worried. \nPAUL What's that noise ? \nHELEN Where ? \nThe camera pans to the other side of the room, where a middle-aged woman with red curly hair has just entered. She is Gladys Dalton, Paul's assistant. She is walking with the help of a cane. \nPAUL (voice over) Oh, Mrs. Dalton. I didn't know you were here so early. \nGLADYS Oh, uh, I-I didn't know whether an-anyone was here. I-I'm sorry. I-I-I heard the noise and I thought... \nPAUL (voice over) It's quite all right. \nGLADYS But, but, uh... \nPAUL (voice over) It's quite all right. \nGLADYS I apologize. \nPAUL (voice over) Quite all right. \nGLADYS All right. \nGladys Dalton starts going out of the room and the camera tilts up on the stairway, on which Ted and Carol are still hiding. \nHELEN (voice over) I'd love to really get an acting job. I had it with this modeling. \nPAUL (voice over) Maybe you won't have to work at all. \nTed and Carol are moving away from the stairway, which remains empty. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose shot on the clock on the wall : the time is just after one o'clock. The room is completely dark and the clock is the only source of light. The camera pans to the bed and on Carol, sound asleep. We hear a noise, like an object dropping down. Carol instantly wakes up. She gets up and the camera pans to Larry, still asleep. He eventually wakes up, moves around in the bed, takes his glasses from the night-table and put them on his nose. \nCAROL (whispering in voice over) Oh, my God. \nSlowly Larry gets out of the bed. \nLARRY What's the matter ? \nCAROL (voice over) Larry, come with me, okay ? \nLarry starts walking along the corridor. \nLARRY Oh, Geez, I was... \nCAROL (voice over) Come on. \nLARRY I was fast asleep. I was dreaming of round card girls. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT \nLarry has reached the front hall. Carol is looking through the peephole of the front door. \nCAROL Okay. Uh, it looks like he's gone. Yeah. Yeah. He's gone. \nLARRY Oh, Christ. Not that again. Please, you know... \nCAROL Listen, Larry. I want to take another look around his apartment. Yeah. \nCarol walks along the corridor toward the bedroom. Larry follows her. \nLARRY What are you talking about ? Where're you going ? \nCAROL Listen. \nLARRY It's-It's one o'clock in the morn... \nCAROL He'll never be back, Larry. \nLARRY What ? What ? \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT CAROL No, he's not coming back. Not for at least an hour, an hour and a half. \nLARRY What-What're you doing ? You got his key ? \nCAROL Yeah. \nLARRY You're kidding. What are you talking about ? You can't do... Why... because you-you followed him to the movie house, you-you said there was nothing happening. \nCAROL No, wait a minute, look, he was with this young model type, and they were talking about money. \nCarol is putting her shoes on. \nLARRY Well, so what ? That's the... \nCAROL So, that's the motive. \nLARRY What... Hey, listen to me. Come here. \nCAROL What are you talking about ? \nCAROL Oh, oh, wait. Look. \nShe starts looking through the mail scattered on a table. \nLARRY What ? What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail ? This is insane. \nHe starts looking through the mail. \nCAROL What do you mean ? \nLARRY Oh, my... As he takes some more letters, Larry hits a small porcelain statuette, and drops it on the floor, where it breaks. He bends down to pick up the debris. \nLARRY Jesus. Oh, Christ ! \nCAROL What are you do... Well, just... Clean it up, Larry. Clean it up. \nLarry stands up. \nLARRY What do you mean, clean it up ? What am I gonna do, vacuum ? \nCAROL Put it under the rug, or something like that, okay ? \nLARRY I can't. It's a wall-to-wall carpet. I broke his-his-his- his... porcelain... \nHe looks at the porcelain pieces in his hands. \nCAROL Well then glue it. Glue it back to... \nShe moves around the room. \nLARRY What do you mean, glue it ? What are you talking about ? \nCAROL Oh, look. Look. \nLARRY What ? \nCAROL Look. \nShe shows him a pair of gloves she just picked up on a low table. \nLARRY So what ? Gloves. I have gloves. They keep my fingers warm. \nCAROL So ? I know. I know, but you keep yours out on the bureau in this kind of weather ? Uh ? \nLARRY Let's get out of here, because this is a... \nCAROL I think something's very strange, here. I mean, he left these out and ready. I think the whole thing is really sinister. LARRY It's eye of the beholder. What you have... you've got to go to the eye doctor, get happy glasses. \nHe pushes her toward the exit of the room. \nCAROL What ? \nLARRY Look, I'm gonna take the pieces with us, and we'll-we'll get rid of them. \nNEW-YORK - CLUB TWENTY-ONE - EXTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot of the famous entrance of the club 21, with the line of painted cast iron lawn jockey statues which adorns the balcony above the entrance. The camera zooms backward to give a full shot of the entrance of the club. \nNEW-YORK - CLUB TWENTY-ONE - INTERIOR DAY \nFull shot on the lobby of the club. On the right, a counter with an attendant behind the counter. Facing us the entrance of the main room. Carol, Larry, and their son Nick, are coming out of the room. Nick must be in his early twenties. \nCAROL So, how did you like your birthday cake, Nick ? \nNICK I loved it, I... \nCAROL I know. \nNICK I loved... But then again, I love chocolate anything, so... The camera moves around the three people as they walk toward the cloakroom. \nCAROL I know. \nLARRY Right. \nCAROL I know. What-What-What are you laughing about ? \nNICK Well, I... \nLARRY If only he could stay in town-If only could stay in town just a couple of more hours. \nNICK I know. I was going to, but I... CAROL Well, what about that ? \nNICK They're working us so hard at school. I can't. \nCAROL Oh. \nThey've stopped in front of the cloakroom. \nNICK I gotta get right back. \nCAROL Really. \nLARRY I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present. And- And-And, uh... \nNICK Brooks Brothers. Yeah. \nLARRY Your mother's going to a wine-tasting. \nCAROL You're going to get something from Brooks Brothers ? \nNICK Yeah. A sweater. \nLARRY She's going to a wine-tasting. Can you believe that ? \nCAROL Well, if I'm going to be a restaurant owner, I should know something about wines. Don't you... Larry ? \nLarry walks across the lobby, because he has seen someone he knows in the sitting-room. He waves his hand and comes back to his wife and his son. \nLARRY Hi. Hey, I want you to meet somebody. \nCAROL What ? \nThe camera pans around, to show us Marcia crossing the sitting- room. \nLARRY I want you to meet somebody. This is, this is... \nMARCIA Hi, Larry. LARRY Hi. How are you ? \nMARCIA Good. How are you doing ? \nLARRY This is my wife. \nMarcia has reached the lobby. \nCAROL Honey, I'm here. I'm right o... \nLARRY You snuck around. \nCAROL Carol. Remember me ? \nLARRY Yeah. This is Marcia Fox. \nThe two women shake hands. \nCAROL Oh, hi. \nMARCIA Hi. \nLARRY My son Nick. He's in town on, uh... \nMARCIA Good to see you. \nLARRY It's his birthday, so we took him to Twenty-One. \nCAROL I mean, I know he didn't see Mrs. House, Larry. \nLARRY If she's a twin, it's a different story. But you don't seem to feel she is, so... CAROL Well, I don't know. Oh, I know. Unless he's in on it. \nLARRY Who's in on it ? The super ? The super can't change a fuse. \nThe lady, sitting next to Larry, just gave the couple a bad look, and Carol taps on Larry's arm. \nCAROL Shh !... Shh !... \nA short pause. \nCAROL I mean, she... \nLARRY What ? \nCAROL Well, she's alive. And my question is, who was in that bag. I mean, somebody... \nLARRY She's not alive, unless she's a twin. Okay ? Now keep quiet... \nCAROL Look, somebody... Somebody got cremated, Larry. Somebody. \nLARRY Shut up. \nNEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY \nLong shot of Ted and Carol walking toward us in a quiet street. Actually it is the street where the wine-tasting lounge is located, and, of course, the street where Carol saw the bus with Lilian on board of it. They walk near the entrance of the \u00abNational Arts Club\u00bb. Ted is holding a small notebook and looking at what is has written in it. \nTED Lillian House. \nCAROL Right. \nTED Uh, maiden name, Lillian Beagle. Born in Carlyle, Pennsylvania, nineteen-thirty-five. Married Paul Richard House. \nCAROL Right, I know. \nTED She was not a twin. Had an older sister who... CAROL So goes Larry's theory. \nTED Uh, went to England twenty years ago, and an older brother who died in nineteen-eighty-seven. \nCarol stops in front of the building next to the \u00abNational Arts Club\u00bb. It is the building where they had the wine-tasting session the day before. \nCAROL Right here. This is it. \nTED This is where we were. \nThe camera tilts up to show the window behind which Carol was sitting the day before. \nCAROL (voice over) This is where we were. I know. And I was sitting right here, after you left. \nThe camera tilts back down to Ted and Carol. \nTED Right. \nCAROL And I was having a glass of, you kn-you know, wine, and I looked out the window, and-and I saw the... right here. \nCarol shows Ted the spot where she saw the bus. \nTED You saw her after I left ? CAROL Yes, I saw... her on a bus. It was passing. You... It was, like. \nShe walks in the middle of the street. \nTED Wait a minute. Are you... You're absolutely sure you saw her ? You saw her face ? \nCAROL I'm positive I-I saw her. \nA car is honking. Carol, still standing in the middle of the street, moves out of the way of the car. \nCAROL Whoo !... Excuse me. I-I'm telling you, Ted. \nTed joins Carol in the middle of the street. \nTED What was the number of the bus ? \nCAROL Uh, I don't know what the number of the bus was, but I know that it was heading west to east, so it was... it obviously was a cross-town bus. \nTED All right. Okay, look, look. It's a cross-town bus. \nThey walk to the sidewalk on the other side of the street, where the park is located. \nCAROL Right. \nTED Okay, so look. The end of the line is a few blocks down there. \nCAROL So, okay. So, then, it's like... \nTED So, she... She had to get off somewhere... somewhere. \nCAROL Then... Her destination was probably within the next five or six blocks. \nThey start walking on the sidewalk, going the way where they first came from. \nTED Yeah, right. So, let's, let's look around. Let's, we, we'll see some, you know, uh, like a, like a, you know... clue, or something. Or something. Maybe we'll see her. You're sure you saw her face ? CAROL Don't, don't doubt me, okay ? \nTED Okay, okay, okay. No, no, no, no. \nCAROL I'm-I'm not kidding. Look. \nNEW-YORK - A WIDE AVENUE - EXTERIOR DAY \nThis is not a nice area anymore. It is a wide dingy-looking avenue, with the nearest buildings very far away and a road bridge over the street. And it is raining. \nLong shot of the avenue, with Carol and Ted walking further away. \nCAROL Oh, God. Well, I think, you know, I think we've reached the end of the line. TED I think this is it. \nA bus is coming toward them. \nCAROL Look. The bus. \nThe bus slows down. \nTED I don't think... there's noth... Watch out. Watch out. \nTed pushes Carol so she doesn't get soaked by the bus driving very close to the sidewalk and into the pools of rain. \nCAROL Yeah, what ? Oh. Whoo !... \nThe bus makes a U-turn on the avenue. \nTED Yeah, look. See ? See, he's turning. That's it. \nCAROL Yeah, I know. \nTED That's all there is, here. \nCAROL Well, what do you think ? \nRED What ? \nCAROL Do you think we should retrace our steps ? NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY \nThey are back in the same street where the wine-tasting place is located. \nFull shot of the park across the street, seen across the thick vertical bars of the railings that surround the park. Ted and Carol are walking on a lane in the park. \nTED You-you wear a tie with a dress. It's a... It's a very special... \nThe camera follows Ted and Carol, moving on the other side of the railings. \nCAROL No, I don't think it looks good, and I don't even know if it looks... I mean, I feel like it'd be to masculine if I wore it with a pair of pants. TED Oh, it'd look great on you. No, no, just don't wear it with pants. \nCAROL Oh. \nCAROL You know, I... \nLARRY I took you to see \u00abLast year at Marienbad\u00bb on our first date ? \nCAROL Yeah, I know. I had to explain it to you for the next six months. \nLARRY Who knew they were flashbacks ? You know. \nCAROL Look, Larry. Look. We've got plenty of time to be conservative. You know what I'm saying ? Don't you see ? \nThe camera starts moving around the car. \nCAROL It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just, like dropped into our laps. I mean, life is just such a dull routine and here we are, right ? I mean, we're on the threshold of a genuine mystery. I mean, to me, the whole thing is like. It's... Hey, no. The camera stops moving on another medium shot, where we still see Larry through his open window, but we see Carol only through the wet windshield. \nLARRY Are you gonna burst into a song, here ? We're in a car. \nCAROL Just don't make fun of me, okay ? Because I'm open to new experiences. \nLARRY Let me ask you a personal question, here. \nCAROL Yeah. \nLARRY Did you ever sleep with Ted ? \nCAROL Sleep ? \nLARRY Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys... \nCAROL What, are you nuts ? \nLARRY We were on an eating tour of France, together. \nCAROL Yeah. \nLARRY You two guys spent an evening, you know, together. CAROL Yeah, right. We sp... \nLARRY At that place, you know. \nCAROL I know... Yeah, but what about you ? Remember ? You spent the evening with Julie. Am I right ? You spent the night, and shared a... \nLARRY That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised me. \nCAROL What ? \nLARRY You know that. She-She thought I was a low-life and a wimp and a vermin and a roach. Just-Just jump in anytime you want to defend me, you know. \nCAROL Hey, I mean, I'm waiting for you to say something I don't agree with, okay ? \nLARRY Ho-ho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !... \nHe stops smiling because he just saw something in front of his car, something we don't yet see, because the camera hasn't moved from its position. \nCAROL Oh. Larry. \nLARRY Yeah. \nThe camera starts panning very rapidly toward the entrance of the hotel. \nCAROL (voice over) Larry, Larry, look. It's her ! I'd say it's her ! \nA lady carrying a white open umbrella is entering the hotel. \nLARRY (voice over) Oh my god, it is. \nCAROL (voice over) Yeah. You see what I mean ? See, so I was right all along, wasn't I ? \nLARRY (voice over) Can you... Are you sure ? Are you sure ? \nCAROL (voice over) I'm positive. Yes. \nThe camera starts panning back toward Larry's car. \nLARRY (voice over) Oh, my God. \nCAROL (voice over) Right ? Right ? I mean, I was... \nMedium shot of Larry and Carol in the car, seen through Larry's open window. \nLARRY I'm... Jesus, I'm sh... \nCAROL I know. W-Well. Come on. \nLARRY That is her. Are you... CAROL Yeah. I know. \nLARRY I told you so. \nCAROL What do you mean, you told me so ? What are you talking about ? You're nuts, honey. \nLARRY Oh, Jesus. I'm flabbergasted. \nCAROL Yeah. No, look. You're white. You're completely white. \nLARRY I know. All the blood rushed to my brother. \nCAROL Larry ! \nLARRY I don't know what to do. \nCAROL Let's go. Let's get out there. Let's find out what's going on. \nLARRY No, I don't want to. \nCAROL Oh, come on. Y-You're not afraid of her, are you ? \nLARRY No, I'm not afraid. CAROL You're not afraid of Mrs. House. \nLARRY She's an old woman and I'm a virile male. \nCAROL I know. \nLARRY And yet somehow I am scared. I don't know why. Maybe because she's dead. You know ? \nCAROL Let's go. You know, I tell you, I'm gonna break this thing wide open. \nLARRY Well, how ? What do you want to do ? \nCAROL I'm... You know, I'm... God, if only Ted were here with us now. You know what I'm saying ? \nLARRY Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's get out of here. \nCAROL No, wait. I got an idea. \nLARRY What ? \nCAROL I know what we should do. We should get a gift, right ? \nLARRY What ? \nCarol gets out of the car. \nCAROL We'll surprise her. We'll sneak into the hotel. Come on. \nLARRY How ? How ? \nCAROL Yeah, no. Come on. \nLarry gets out of the car. \nHOTEL WALDRON - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY \nA modern clean lobby, with a very conventional decoration. Medium shot of a clerk cleaning the lobby floor with a broom. She is a woman in her forties, very casually dressed with a flowered blouse and a beige sweater, and with uncombed hair hanging on her shoulders. The camera pans around toward the street door. Carol enters the lobby, followed by Larry. Carol is holding a small present-wrapped parcel in her hand and walks toward the clerk. \nCAROL Uh, excuse me. Hi. \nHOTEL WALDRON - SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY Same shot of the long corridor as before. We see Carol and Larry coming out Room 611 and running toward us. \nLARRY Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears. \nThey reach the end of the corridor, and the camera follows them as they run around the corner of the hallway. \nLARRY Get down those stairs. \nThey don't use the elevator and instead run down the stairs. \nCAROL Okay, all right. \nLARRY Come on, come on. Quickly. NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY \nLong shot of the entrance of the hotel, seen from the other side of the street. A blue police car is parked in front of the hotel. Two plainclothes police officers and one uniformed policeman are talking with Carol and Larry. They both try to explain the situation to the police officers. But since they both talk together, the police officers have a hard time understanding them. \nWhile they are talking, the camera zooms forward from a long shot to a full shot of the group. \nCAROL (talking together with Larry) And then, you see, what happened was I suspected Mr. House, right ? He's a... He runs a movie house. But-But then what hap... We're sit... I saw her on this bus, right ? And... And she has... no place at all. Then we checked anyway. So we were just sitting there, just waiting... \nLARRY (talking together with Carol) We-We-We were there. She-She was very nervous. So-So we were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and looking around the place. And then suddenly she's a... Her hand is on the floor. You could see it on the side of the bed. She was lying there, she was sort of... like blue in the face. The girl was nervous. I tried to keep calm, as best as I could. \nOne of the plainclothes police officers stops their talking. \nFIRST POLICE OFFICER There's nobody up there. \nCAROL There's what ? \nLARRY What do you mean, there's nobody up... FIRST POLICE OFFICER There's nobody. \nCAROL Wait a minute, wait... \nSECOND POLICE OFFICER There's no body there. \nCAROL We-We saw... \nLARRY We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor. \nCAROL We... \nSECOND POLICE OFFICER (talking to the uniformed policeman) Mike, check the basement with... He starts climbing the few steps to the entrance of the hotel, followed by Carol and Larry. The other police officer remains on the sidewalk. \nLARRY She was totally dead. \nCAROL We... She's there. \nLARRY Wait, wait. \nHOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium close shot of an uniformed policeman, different from the one we just saw in the street. \nCAROL (voice over) She was right here. She was lying, like, right this-a-way. \nLARRY (voice over) Yeah, she was definitely laying here. \nThe camera pans from the uniformed policeman to the two police officers talking with Carol and Larry in the middle of the room. The following dialogue transcript separates what Larry says from what Carol says, but, most of the time, they talk together at the same time, making it quite difficult for us, or for the police officers, to follow their conversation. \nCAROL Because, I mean, she was, she was there, do you understand ? \nThe camera tilts down on one of the police officers looking under the bed. LARRY The... Y-Yes. She was... It looked like she was strangled, or something. Not-Not that I'm an expert on violent death, because I wouldn't know. \nCAROL We're-We're two professional people. \nLARRY Right, I'm a... I-I work at Harper's. \nCAROL Yeah. \nLARRY I'm in publishing. \nCAROL Yeah, that's right, and I'm-I'm looking to start a little restaurant, basically French, although international cuisine would be fine. Not that I really have a location... LARRY Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook. \nFIRST POLICE OFFICER Calm down. Calm down ! Please ! \nCAROL Okay, just... \nLARRY Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body. Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were here fast. It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to understand what I was saying. \nFIRST POLICE OFFICER Nobody is doubting you, okay ? We're going over the whole building, all right ? \nCAROL All right. \nNEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot of Carol, Larry, the first plainclothes police officer and the uniformed policeman we first saw in the street. \nCAROL Uh, did you check... \nFIRST POLICE OFFICER Mr. House... \nThe second plainclothes police officer joins the group. SECOND POLICE OFFICER ...He's been at his place of business all day. \nLARRY Any witnesses ? \nCAROL Yeah, b... \nSECOND POLICE OFFICER Uh-huh, backed up and corroborated. \nCAROL Yeah, but you didn't use our names, or anything like that, did you ? \nSECOND POLICE OFFICER No, we didn't. \nCAROL No, okay. SECOND POLICE OFFICER I don't know. If you think you saw his wife, shouldn't you tell him ? \nCAROL No, I'm... No, I mean, he's in some sort of scheme, here. It's... \nFIRST POLICE OFFICER We think you should calm down and file a report. \nCAROL It's not... Oh ! \nFIRST POLICE OFFICER This way, if anything turns up, we got it on record. \nHe gives his business card to Larry. \nCAROL All right. \nFIRST POLICE OFFICER Take a card, give us a call, have a good day. \nCAROL Thank you. Thanks very much. \nSECOND POLICE OFFICER Bye-bye. \nThe two police officers walk away with the uniformed policeman. Larry looks at the card in his hand. \nCAROL Thanks very much. Oh, man, I don't know how we're gonna... \nLARRY Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need fourteen Zanacks or something. \nCAROL Where is Ted ? I just don't understand where Ted is. I mean, you know, all this stuff is happening. \nThey start walking away on the sidewalk, while the police officers are climbing in their car. \nLARRY Ted ? Ted-Ted's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly. \nCAROL Do you think Helen Moss might be in on this ? \nLARRY Helen ? I don't know and... \nCAROL I think so. LARRY I don't want to know about this. I think we should change our lives. \nCAROL No, think about it. \nLARRY We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You know, start over maybe in Mexico. \nThe clerks goes and gets the key of the room. He gives it to Carol, who drops the card on the small counter under the window. \nHOTEL NIGHT CLERK Is there any trouble ? \nLARRY No, no, no, no, no. I-m-I'm-I'm-I'm j... I'm-I'm ju... um... I'm a detective. They-They-They lowered the height requirements, so I... I'll take this card back. They-re, they're... \nHe takes the card from the counter and puts it back in the inside pocket of his jacket. \nCAROL Come on. \nLARRY ...expensive. \nCarol walks toward the elevator and Larry follows her. \nHOTEL WALDRON - SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT \nAs before, the camera is located at one end of the long corridor, showing Larry and Carol at the other end of the corridor ready to enter Room 611. Larry keeps looking around while Carol is opening the door. \nHOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR NIGHT \nFull shot of the room with the door in the background. The door is opening slowly. Carol enters the room, followed by Larry \nCAROL Okay. \nLARRY Be careful. \nCAROL Telling me to be careful. Now, just don't upset anything. Okay, Larry ? \nLarry closes the door. \nLARRY I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just gonna leave a-a set of fingerprints around, so if there's a trial, we can get trapped. \nThe camera follows Carol and Larry moving around the room. \nCAROL All right, now look. The murderer must have, like, hid in this closet, right ? \nCarol opens a closet. \nLARRY I don't like this. \nCarol gives a quick peek inside the closet, and then closes it. CAROL Right, and then he must have... \nLARRY Let's go. You know, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I've got to be in temple. \nCAROL Okay, he must have dragged the b... The body out, really fast. What ? \nWe hear a click coming from the door of the room. \nLARRY Shhh !... \nLarry picks up a metal lamp from the floor and hides behind a closet in front of the door with Carol behind him. The door opens and the cleaning lady walks in with her bucket and things. Larry is ready to hit her, but, when he realizes who she is, he drops the lamp. The cleaning lady yells. CLEANING LADY Ahhh !... Oh, Jesus! What... \nLARRY I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... I-I, oh, it's- It's-It's a... \nCAROL Oh, hi. \nLarry opens the door and pushes the lady out of the room. \nLARRY You don't have to turn the bed out. It's not necessary. And no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast. \nHe takes some money out of his pocket and gives it to her. \nLARRY Here, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh... \nHe closes the door. \nCAROL Oh, Jesus. Larry. I mean, really. \nLARRY Let's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're gonna get in trouble. \nCAROL Just a second, Larry. Let me just look around here, just a little bit. \nLarry picks up the lamp which is broken in two pieces. LARRY Oh, look. I did damage. I... Now. I'll be sued. \nCAROL (voice over) Oh ! Larry ! \nLARRY That's what ? \nCarol comes back to Larry, holding something small in her hand. \nCAROL Larry, look. Look. I thinks that's her wedding band, Larry. \nLARRY How do you know ? \nCAROL How do I know ? I saw it on her. \nLARRY You did ? CAROL Yeah. \nLARRY Jesus. \nCAROL I think so. \nLARRY So much for the police combing every inch of this place. Where did you find it ? \nCAROL I found it behind the door, right there. \nLARRY Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open. \nCAROL Okay. Okay. \nLarry opens the door and they walk out of the room. \nHOTEL WALDRON - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium shot inside the cabin. The elevator is moving down. \nCAROL Didn't I tell you the police weren't thorough ? I mean they probably thought we were cranks, right ? I mean, we got no body, and... I mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a minute. Why would they bother with us ? \nLARRY I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff. CAROL Just... \nLARRY We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know what I mean ? This goes... this could be... Who knows who's involved in this ? This could go very deep, Carol. This could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission, or something. I don't like it. \nCAROL Oh, not the Warren Commission. \nThere is a loud noise and the elevator suddenly stops. \nCAROL Oh, my God ! \nLARRY Jesus ! What is that ? CAROL Wait a minute. Okay, all right, now look. All right. The- the elevator's probably stuck. \nLARRY Why are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ? \nCAROL Relax now, Larry. \nCarol starts punching all the buttons on the control panel. \nLARRY Don't tell me to relax ! I'm-I'm-I'm a-a world-renowned claustrophobic. \nCAROL It's okay. It's okay, everything's going to be fine. \nLARRY Stop. Hit something. \nCAROL I am hitting it. \nLARRY I don't like this, I don't, I don't... \nCAROL I know, I know. It's okay. \nLARRY It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic. \nCAROL The-the idea is, there's plenty of air, in this elevator. Uh, Larry, relax. Now, if you just don't panic, okay ? Don't panic, all right ? LARRY I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm... \nCAROL Now, just don't worry. \nLARRY Th-Th-These are my matches. I got them at... \nCAROL Wait a minute, what... When were you at the \u00abCaf\u00e9 des Artistes\u00bb ? \nLarry blows the match, because it is burning his fingers. \nLARRY Look. I got... Yeah, I was with an author. An authoress. At-at the... At... \nCAROL At the \u00abCaf\u00e9 des Artistes\u00bb ? LARRY Yeah, b... A French, a French authoress. An author. \nHe lights another match. We very dimly see the basement walls around them. \nCAROL Wait. Shh ! Shh ! Shh ! \nLARRY Jesus. \nCAROL Try this way. \nMedium full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us in a corridor. Beside the light of the match, there is some other dim light coming from somewhere in the basement. \nLARRY I like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table. You know, where you can... \nCAROL Hey, look, look, look, look. Uh-huh. \nThey are now in close shot. \nLARRY What ? What ? \nCAROL What's this ? \nLARRY I... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here, it's dank. The camera turns around to follow them in the corridor. \nCAROL All right. \nLARRY And there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I don't know. This... \nWe hear a loud metallic bang. \nLARRY Oh, Jesus ! \nCAROL Calm down. \nLARRY Calm down ? Don't tell me to calm down. \nCAROL There. Turn the light on. Larry switches the light on. They are in a room with beige walls. There are pots of paint stacked behind Larry. \nLARRY This... Wh-Wh... I-I don't... What do you... \nCAROL Let me see. \nCarol tries to open a door near Larry, but it is locked. \nCAROL Where... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you gonna do ? \nLARRY Oh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand back. \nLarry walks back a few steps and rushes on the door, trying to break it open. \nCAROL Careful, now. \nLARRY Don't worry. Just-Just give me a second. \nHe does it another time. \nCAROL Don't hurt yourself. \nLARRY Must be one of those new doors. \nCAROL Let's try out here. \nCarol points to another room opening in the one they are in. \nCarol and Larry are now walking in a lit corridor. \nLARRY Oh, my god. I keep hearing noises. \nCAROL Oh. What's down there ? \nCarol walks rapidly toward a dark section of the corridor. The camera follows her. \nLARRY Where ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me. \nCAROL Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh ! \nShe has reached a door with a barred window showing the street outside. \nCAROL Yeah. I think this is it. I think this is the service entrance. \nShe tries to open the door, but it is a bit stuck. \nLARRY Well, come on. \nCAROL I'm trying. \nLARRY Come on, get it open. \nCarol succeeds in opening the door. \nCAROL I got it. I got it. \nLARRY Go into a trot. \nThey rush outside. \nNEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nLong shot on the dark street. At a distance, we see a man putting a large oblong-shaped parcel in the trunk of a car. The man looks very much like Paul. \nThe camera pans around to give us a reverse-angle medium shot of Carol and Larry coming out of the basement of the hotel. They stopped in the middle of the short staircase. \nCAROL Wait ! Wait ! Did you see that ? \nLARRY What ? \nCAROL It looks like somebody's putting a body into a car. \nLARRY Jesus. \nCAROL I swear. Look. It's got a white sheet on it. \nLARRY Yes. \nCAROL Right... Yeah. Come on. \nCarol walks on to the sidewalk, followed by a very frightened Larry. LARRY It is. Oh, brother. \nThe camera pans back around to give us a reverse-angle shot of the car leaving the curb of the street. \nLARRY (voice over) Let's-Let's-Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. \nCAROL (voice over) Oh, my God. Wait. No, look ! Let's-Let's follow him. Come on. \nLARRY (voice over) No, no, no, no. \nCAROL (voice over) Yeah, no. Come on. \nThe camera pans back around again to give a reverse-angle medium long shot of Carol and Larry running toward their car. \nLARRY I'm not going to follow. I'm not gonna... I don't wanna follow him. \nCAROL No, let's follow it. I swear, there was a body in that car. \nLARRY I know, I saw that there was a... \nCAROL Hey. \nPAUL How are you ? \nCAROL H-How are you ? \nPAUL May I introduce Gladys Dalton, my gal Friday ? \nCAROL Mrs. D... How are you ? Nice to see you. \nCarol and Larry shake hands with Gladys. \nPAUL This is Larry and Carol, my neighbors. \nCAROL Yes. GLADYS Nice to see you. \nPAUL We were just watching Madame Bovary. Wonderful. \nGLADYS Such a sad story. \nCAROL Yeah, it is. We, you know... \nLARRY She-She-She gets cremated. She gets killed at the end. \nCAROL Yeah. \nPAUL Yeah. Listen you gotta stop up for a drink before I go on my trip. \nCAROL Love to. \nPAUL See you later. \nCAROL See you later. \nPAUL Oh, incidentally, if you hear of anybody who needs an apartment, I think I may be moving. \nCAROL Oh, well, it... PAUL See you later. Come on, Gladys. \nHe puts his hand on Gladys' shoulder and start walking away with her. \nCAROL What a shame. \nPAUL Good night. \nCAROL Good night. \nThe camera follows the departing couple, Gladys still walking with the help of a cane. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium shot of Larry and Carol, sitting in their bed. They've already put on their nightclothes and they have a last talk before going to sleep. \nLARRY Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh ? I can't figure it out. It's got to be that either he's a... \nCAROL What ? \nLARRY Either she's a twin, or he's a twin. \nCAROL He... He... \nLARRY Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm a twin. \nCarol laughs. \nLARRY Because I don't know what's going on. \nCAROL You're nuts. \nLARRY You know, look. \nCAROL Wait, wait, yeah. \nLARRY Let me be logical about this. \nCAROL Okay, she's not a twin. We know she's not a twin. LARRY Hey. \nCAROL What are you talking about, Larry ? \nLARRY Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out. \nCAROL I'm calm, Larry. Okay, but okay, she's a twin, she's not a twin. I mean, now you're saying we are twins ? What are you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm, okay. \nLARRY Yeah, I'm going to be logical. \nCAROL All right, all right. \nLARRY The, um, the first thing is this. \nFLASHBACK SCENE LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe door of the elevator opens. Inside the cabin, Larry and Carol are smiling and talking. \nLARRY (voice over) We came home that night. There had been a heart attack. \nSome neighbors are gathered around Paul's apartment door. Larry asks them questions. \nLARRY (voice over) Uh, what if they induced it ? You know, some kind of poison. We never saw the body. \nThe camera pans inside Paul's corridor, where Mrs. House's body, completely covered by a white sheet, is lying dead on a stretcher with the doctor and the emergency medical team around her. \nLARRY (voice over) You know, it had to be some other woman. You know, some- some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House. \nThe camera pans around to the group of neighbors standing in the hallway. \nLARRY (voice over) The super says he saw her, but, uh, he's a drunk, you know. Mrs. House could have been hiding. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nBack to Larry and Carol sitting in their bed. LARRY But you-you remember that you heard a noise that night. That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel. \nCAROL Yeah. Yeah. Well... \nLARRY I can't sleep. I just, I... \nCAROL No, wait a minute, wait. \nLARRY I'm too, you know... I'm too... \nCAROL But it doesn't make any sense at all, Larry, because suddenly, you know, he murders her. I mean, what's it all about ? \nLARRY Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey... and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something to eat, and talk with them. \nCAROL Wait a minute. At one in the morning ? What are you talking about ? You mean... You wanna... \nLARRY Yeah, so what ? So what ? It's so, you know, Ted-Ted was taking her to a show and to-to-to dinner... so they'll be there. \nCAROL All the way out to New Jersey... \nLARRY So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That, plus I don't know where Duluth is. \nHe picks up the phone on his night table. \nLARRY Lucky me. \nVINCENT'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nVincent's is a nice cosy place, with dim lights, tasteful decorations, and light piano music. \nFull shot of a table with the four customer seen in profile. Larry is seated next to Marcia, and across from his wife. Ted is seated next to Carol. During the following conversation, the camera moves around the table. \nTED Uh, you really saw his face ? CAROL Yes. Oh, yes, I'm here to tell you... \nTED You saw, you saw what he looked like ? No question. You know exactly who it is. \nCAROL I... Well. It's not that I'm jealous. \nTED Kids, kids. People, what are we doing, here? \nThe camera pans to a medium close shot on Carol. \nCAROL Yeah, look who's talking. My God, I mean, you kept staring into her eyes like she was the Dragon Lady, or something. \nThe camera slightly zooms back to show us Larry and Carol \nLARRY What'd wrong with you ? You're jealous because he's-he's interested in her. \nTED I'm interested in her theory. What... I don't... What are you... \nCAROL Well, I'd just like to know if you take all your-your authors to lunch at the Caf\u00e9 des... Marcia walks back to the table. \nMARCIA Okay, I've got it. \nShe sits down, while Larry half-stands up and then sits back. Close shot on Marcia \nMARCIA Here's the story. Since he's gotten away with it, all we can do is bluff. As long as we have no body, we have no case. \nThe camera pans to Ted. \nTED What... What do you mean ? What do we... We pretend that he slipped up, and the molten steel didn't do the job ? What- What do you mean ? \nThe camera pans back to Marcia. MARCIA Yeah, it's possible. He saw you there, he knows you're onto him. After he ran away, why couldn't you have retrieved the body ? \nLARRY You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a shoulder, maybe, at most. \nMARCIA Well, that's... Okay, okay, you have the body. What does he know ? He was probably too scared to be very lucid. \nThe camera pans to Ted, who looks at Marcia with worshipping eyes. \nMARCIA (voice over) He's an amateur. He dumped the body and ran off, and then somehow - who knows the details, you two dug her out. Now, you can send him to the chair. \nCAROL Okay, okay, just... \nTED I like this woman, she's lurid. \nCAROL Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us, okay ? \nThe camera pans on Larry. \nLARRY Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie without giggling, so-so... \nThe camera pans to Carol. CAROL Yeah. No, because if we really had the body, why tell him ? Why not go straight to the Police ? \nThe camera pans to Marcia. \nMARCIA If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down. \nMedium shot on another table, around which two middle-aged men are seated, listening very eagerly to the conversation. \nTED (voice over) Oh, she's wicked. Oh, I-look... look how, look how this works out. You go to the law, what do you gain ? \nMedium close shot on Ted and Carol. \nTED I mean, so-so maybe they, you know, they put him in jail. What have you got ? You haven't got anything. LARRY (voice over) Right. \nTED But if he wants the evidence, and he's got to pay for it, now... Okay, now he's nervous, right ? \nCAROL Yeah, you know, wait. There's just so many fallacies in this, I can't even count them. \nThe camera pans to Marcia and Larry. \nTED (voice over) What ? Name one. \nCAROL (voice over) Name one? Okay, the guy looks us straight in the eyes and says, \u00abWhat body? What the hell are you talking about ? Prove it\u00bb. \nMARCIA Well, that's when we keep bluffing. \nTED (voice over) What ? How ? What do we do ? \nMARCIA We produce the body. \nLARRY Yeah, but where are you gonna get it. Madame Tussaud's ? \nMARCIA Yeah. Say-Say we found someone to corroborate this story. \nCAROL (voice over) Oh, really. J-Just... \nMARCIA Someone he trusted. \nThe camera pans to Ted and Carol. \nCAROL Like who ? \nMARCIA (voice over) Like his lover. Say she called and said, \u00abPaul, I've just seen Lillian's body. They want a hundred thousand dollars for it\u00bb. \nTED Why-Why would she do that ? \nThe camera pans to Marcia and Larry. \nMARCIA (to Larry) Remember that book you recommended to me ? \u00abMurder in Manhattan\u00bb ? \nLARRY Oh, yes. Max Schindler's book. That's right, the phone call. \nCAROL (voice over) I don't remember that book. \nLARRY This is perfect. \nCAROL (voice over) You never mentioned that book to me. \nLARRY No, no. Because you don't like light reading, so I never... \nThe camera pans to Ted and Carol. \nCAROL Since when did I not like light reading, Larry ? \nTED I don't know... I don't know this book. What is this book ? \nThe camera pans to Larry and Marcia. \nLARRY This book. That's fantastic ! It would be so perfect because s-she's a, she's a-an, actress, or would-be actress, anyhow, and you're-you-re... Jeez, we could use his theatre. He's a playwright. This is so perfect. Your theatre is empty all the time, anyhow. \nThe camera pans to Carol and Ted. \nCAROL Oh, God. \nTED Oh, yeah, thank you. That's great. What-What are we talking about here ? What-What do you mean ? What-What is this ? \nThe camera pans to Larry and Marcia. \nLARRY Listen to this. What you do is, we get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything. \nTED (voice over) Yeah. \nLARRY And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing and we tape-record it. \nCAROL (voice over) Uh... LARRY Listen to this. \nCAROL (voice over) I'm listening. \nLARRY And we edit it up. We edit the tape recording up, and we make one end of a phone call... \nThe camera pans to Ted and Carol. \nLARRY (voice over) ...and we play it into the phone to Mr. House. \nTED This is in the book ? \nThe camera pans to Larry and Marcia. \nTED Yeah, just... Whenever, you know, whenever you feel it. Whenever you feel into it. \nTed walks away. Helen takes a very deep breathing, sits down, puts her hands trough her hair, takes another breathing, and picks up the phone handset from the telephone on the table. She overdoes it a lot, trying to act as the prima dona she is not. \nHELEN Yeah, okay. \nShe dials a fake number on the phone keyboard. \nHELEN Hello, Joe ? I-I was just... I... \nTED (voice over) Uh, let me stop you right there. \nHelen looks in Ted's direction. \nTED (voice over) I'm sorry, I... uh, if you'll be... if you'll start out more frightened... then that'll take you where you're gonna go. \nHELEN Right, right. \nShe breathes deeply before starting again. \nHELEN Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, now, and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed. \nLater. Helen is auditioning another scene. She doesn't have the phone in her hand any more. She is holding a script and looking at it. Larry is seated in front of her, and read his own script on his clipboard. \nHELEN Give me your hand. Hold on. Try not to fall. Hold on. \nLARRY I'm trying, I'm trying. \nHELEN Quickly ! Hurry ! \nLater. Close shot of Helen's face auditioning another scene. \nHELEN They're asking two hundred thousand dollars for it. Yeah. They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake. \nMedium shot of Helen, seen from behind. We see Sy standing behind his camera on her right, and Larry standing with his clipboard in his hand on her left. In the background, Ted, Marcia, Marilyn and Carol listening to her. While Helen is talking, the camera moves backward through the opening in the scenery. \nHELEN Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall. \nA BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT. \nFull shot on the upper level of a building, that could be either Ted's theatre of Sy's workshop. The camera tilts down to street level. \nSY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWe are inside Sy's workshop. It is full of very high-tech video and audio equipment. \nMedium shot of Marilyn standing behind a computer. Close to her, Carol is seated on a table, and Ted is standing next to her. They are both looking at a large video monitor. On the monitor screen and on the computer screen, we see the same picture of Helen auditioning with the telephone in her hand. \nHELEN'S VOICE Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, right now... \nThe camera pans to Marcia, seated behind Carol and also looking at the monitor. Behind her, Sy is looking at another monitor, and manipulating some switches on an editing machine underneath the monitor. Larry is standing next to him. \nHELEN'S VOICE ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed. \nSy rewinds the video tape. \nHELEN'S VOICE Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much right now. \nSy fast winds the tape. \nHELEN'S VOICE Hello, Joe ? Ever since Joe came back from Vietnam... \nClose shot on Ted's face, then the camera pans to Carol and Marcia, seated one behind the other, and behind them, Sy working on the editing machine, with Larry standing next to him. The camera zooms on Sy. \nHELEN'S VOICE ... he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall. \nSy rewinds the tape. HELEN'S VOICE A pall. \nSy rewinds the tape. \nHELEN'S VOICE Pall. \nSy rewinds the tape. \nHELEN'S VOICE Pall. \nSlightly later. Medium close shot of Ted looking at something we don't see, with Marcia standing next to him. \nHELEN'S VOICE Hello, Joe ? \nThe camera pans to Carol standing up and looking at the same thing as Ted. We hear Helen's voice distorted by Sy's editing machine. HELEN'S VOICE (distorted) Hello, Joe. \nThe camera pans back on Ted and Marcia, then it pans to a close shot of a big high-tech tape recorder, on which Sy is working. We see his hands cutting off a short section of the audio tape, and gluing back the two severed ends of the tape together. \nFull shot of the room. In the foreground, Sy is working on his tape recorder. On his right, Larry is standing and looking at him. On his left, Marilyn also looking at him. Behind him, Carol, Ted and Marcia, all looking at him. \nTED It's so... \nThe camera zooms on Ted and Marcia. \nClose up shot on the tape recorder. Sy starts it. \nHELEN'S VOICE Hello, Paul ? I can't talk much, right now... \nThe camera tilts up from the tape recorder to a medium shot on Ted and Marcia. Ted smiles when he hears the work Sy has done with the tape. HELEN'S VOICE ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed. \nMARCIA (SMILING) Perfect. \nShe shakes hands with Larry. \nTED That's great. He also shake hands with Larry, moving slightly Carol out of the way. \nMARCIA You did great. Great. \nLarry suddenly notices that Carol has been excluded from the hand- shaking party, and he turns around toward her. \nCAROL Well, yeah, it's, excuse me, hey, don't worry, yeah, okay. \nMARCIA Fantastic. \nMARCIA'S CAR - INTERIOR DAY \nThe camera is behind Marcia, who is driving in a street in New- York. We see Helen walking on the sidewalk. \nMARCIA There she is. The camera pans around, from inside the car, to get a better shot of Helen. \nTED Where ? \nMARCIA You have to keep her busy for all afternoon. \nThrough the back window of the car, we see Helen entering a restaurant called \u00abTime\u00bb. \nTED Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll-I'll just keep improvising, you know ? \nMARCIA Okay, well, it shouldn't be too hard. She's a hungry actress, you're a playwright with a role. \nNEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nClose shot on Marcia's car, inside which Marcia and Ted are talking together. \nTED You know what ? I'll g... I'll talk about the play, or, get her, get her talking about the part, you know, her life. I'll get her talking about her life, and her whole background. Stop the car, I'm gonna get out here. \nMARCIA Good. We'll hook up later, okay ? \nTED All right. Good - Good luck with your assignment. Ok ? MARCIA All right, you too. \nMarcia has stopped the car, and Ted is getting out of it. \nSY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nFull shot of a large room, furnished with good taste. In the background a large bay window, overlooking some green trees. On the right, there is a large modern mantlepiece. On the left, a bicycle is leaning on the wall. Under the window, a large and cosy sofa. \nCarol and Sy are standing in front of the window and talking together. Next to them and Marcia is also standing and reading a large album. In the foreground, Larry, who is the only one not to be casually dressed, and is wearing jacket and necktie, is playing with a small cassette-player in his hands. Marilyn is walking into the room. \nDEAD END STREET BEHIND PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot on Larry and Paul, still fighting. Larry succeeds in getting away from Paul, who fires his gun. But, apparently, Larry is not hit by the gunshot, because he runs toward the back entrance of the movie house. The camera follows him. PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot on the staircase on the side of the backstage. Larry runs down the stairs, while we hear the sound of the \u00abLady from Shangai\u00bb. \u00abThe Lady from Shangai\u00bb is a 1947 film written, directed and played by Orson Welles. \nMICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) That's what Grisby thought. But, of course, she meant to kill Grisby, too. After he'd served his purpose. Poor howling idiot. \nLarry has now reached the backstage. He is behind the screen, a small part of which is seen on the side of the shot. \nMICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) He never even did that. He went and shot Broome. And that was not part of the plan. Broome might have got to the police before he died. \nLarry walks around the backstage, trying to find his way. We see the black and white film on the screen, but also reflections of the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage. \nMICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And if the cops traced it to Grisby... and the cops made Grisby talk, he'd spill everything. \nMedium shot on the staircase. Paul is walking very slowly downstairs. \nMICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And she'd be finished, so she had to shut up Grisby but quick. Back on Larry, still trying to find his way around the backstage. \nMICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And I was the fall guy. \nFull shot on the screen, where a man is falling down a long slide, like the one used by kids on playgrounds. We hear the film music. \nMedium close shot on two mirrors, one behind the other. On the mirrors, we see the reflection of the screen. Paul is slowly walking from behind the first mirror, his gun in hand. \nFull shot on the mirrors, with Larry walking cautiously among them. \nPAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot on Carol in the small room. She is still trying to get free from her bonds and gag. \nELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film) Why don't you try to understand ? PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY \nBack to the mirrors showing numerous reflections of the screen. \nELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film) He was mad. He had to be shot. \nMICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And what about me ? \nPaul walks in, his gun in his hand. \nELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film) We could have gone off together. \nClose shot of Larry half-hidden behind a large mirror. \nMICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) One who follows his nature, keeps his original nature in the end. \nLarry inadvertently drops the large mirror on the floor. The mirror breaks with a crashing sound. \nCAROL (voice over) Help ! Help ! \nThe camera pans to Paul, walking slowly with his gun pointed toward Larry. \nPAUL They can't see us behind the screen, and they can't hear us with the sound on. Not even a gunshot. \nBehind Paul, we see the film on the screen. We have now reached the famous last scene of the film, shot in the hall of mirrors. Rita Hayworth's face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film, just like, in the actual scene in the backstage, Paul and Larry are reflected on the many mirrors scattered around. \nARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) I knew I'd find you two together. \nArthur's figure, walking with a cane, is reflected in the many mirrors in the film. Just the same, Gladys, who has just entered the backstage, walking with a cane, is also reflected on the mirrors scattered around her. She has a gun in the hand which is not holding the cane. \nWhile Gladys and Paul are talking, the film keeps on showing on the screen behind them, but we do not understand the words from the film, because Paul and Gladys' voices are louder. \nGLADYS Hallo, Paul. Didn't you expect me ? \nMedium shot on the mirrors, showing several reflections of Paul. \nPAUL Mrs. Dalton. \nClose shot on Gladys' face. While she is talking, the camera pans away from her, showing her reflection on a mirror. \nGLADYS You made a lot of promises to me, over the years. And then, you decided to dump me for that young model. \nThe camera keeps on panning, showing another reflection of Gladys. \nPAUL (voice over) I never led you on. \nGLADYS (with a very harsh voice) It's late for excuses. \nMedium shot on the mirrors showing several reflections of Paul. \nPAUL None of you can prove anything. \nFull shot of the screen, showing Arthur and his numerous reflections on the mirrors in the film. \nARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) So you'd be foolish to fire that gun. \nLow angle shot on the staircase, showing Larry going down the stairs. \nARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell. You are aiming at me, aren't you ? \nLARRY Carol ? Carol ? Carol ? Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections. \nGLADYS I'm aiming at you, lover. \nARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) Of course, killing you is killing myself. \nGLADYS Of course, killing you is killing myself. \nARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) It's the same thing. \nGLADYS But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us. \nShe fired her gun twice \nMedium shot on the many reflections of Paul. He fires his gun twice. We hear noises of mirrors being broken by the gunshots, both in the film, and on the backstage itself. Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections. She turns around, not being sure, because of the mirrors, of Paul's exact location. \nMedium shot of Paul walking on the backstage. We still hears noises of mirrors being broken, but we don't know if the noises come from the film or the backstage. \nMedium shot of Gladys and several of the reflections. \nMedium shot of the floor of the backstage. We see the bottom of the screen and, of course, the film projected on it, and in which the mirrors are being broken. Paul enters from behind a mirror frame, and falls on the floor. Gladys' reflection appears in several mirrors. She stops and looks at Paul's body lying on the floor. \nPAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium close shot of Larry entering the room. He rushes to Carol, and takes her gag off. \nLARRY God ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ? \nHe hugs and kisses her. \nCAROL Oh, God, Larry ! Oh, Larry, I'm so happy to see you ! \nLARRY Jesus, I was, I was never so glad to see somebody in my life. Are you all right ? \nHe starts untying her hands. \nCAROL Yes, I'm all right. \nLARRY You don't know what's going on out there. I'll never say that life doesn't imitate art again. I'm... I'm... Oh, gee... \nCAROL We... we gotta call the police, Larry. \nLARRY Yes, and... and... and... a glazier. \nCAROL I know. Oh, God. \nLARRY Quick, quick. Dial, dial, dial. \nHe picks up the telephone, and Carol, whose hands are now completely free, starts dialing. CAROL Larry. Oh, God, Larry. Oh, God. Oh, honey. Oh, God. Ow ! Ow ! Oh, God ! Jesus ! \nLarry hugs and kisses her again. \n", "test1_input": "CAROL The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his satchel. \nTED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nClose shot of Ted's back. He is still seated at his desk and talking on the phone \nTED Listen, I'd get out of there right away, if I were you. \nThe camera moves around Ted, showing the typewriter he is typing on. TED No, no, no. Go, go, go. We'll do... We'll talk more from your apartment. \nPAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nSame shot of Carol on the phone. \nCAROL He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss. \nShe turns around, because she feels she heard a noise in the landing hallway. \nLARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY \nOne of Paul's neighbor is standing in the hallway, waiting for the elevator. He's got some documents in his hand. The elevator dings and the door opens. Paul comes out. NEIGHBOR Oh. Hi. How are you ? \nPAUL Good morning. How are you ? \nPaul has his key in his hand and is ready to open his apartment door. \nNEIGHBOR Good. You got the notice on the... Uh, maintenance increase ? \nPaul turns around to look at the neighbor. \nPAUL No. When did that happen ? \nPAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nClose shot on Carol, whispering in the phone and looking toward the front door. \nCAROL I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here, okay ? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, I-I'm just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just the craziest thing I've ever done. \nTED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nClose-up shot on the ashtray, where a cigarette is burning slowly. The camera pans to a close-up shot on Paul's face, still on the phone. \nTED Yes, it's crazy. But soon, we'll be too old to do anything crazy. Go, leave, leave, leave. \nPAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nCarol puts the phone down on the desk. She stands and turns around when she hears the front door opening. \nBlack screen shot on the front door in the dark of the corridor, then the camera quickly spins around to show Carol, standing in the living-room, with a frightened look on her face. She walks away from the room. The camera spins back to the front door, which opens. Paul enters and switches the lights on. He closes the front door, and walks along the corridor to the living-room. \nCarol walks into the kitchen from the living-room. \nThe camera pans to Paul, looking for something on his desk. He looks through all the documents scattered on the desk. \nThe camera pans back to Carol, hiding in the kitchen, then back to Paul. Paul opens both his hands in a gesture of despair : apparently, he hasn't found what he was looking for. He starts walking across the room, and the camera pans back to Carol in the kitchen. She rushes out of the kitchen. \nThe camera remains at the same spot, and we see Paul in the living-room, still looking for whatever he is missing. He walks out of the living-room through the kitchen. \nPAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nPaul enters the room, looking in the inner pocket of his jacket. He walks around the room, and opens a closet. He looks through the hanging clothes, and finds a few documents in one of the jackets. He closes the closet, and starts looking through the documents he has found. He puts them inside the inner pocket of his jacket. He starts walking out of the room, when the phone rings. He stops and picks up the phone receiver on one of the night-tables. \nPAUL Hallo. \nMedium shot of Carol hiding under the bed. We notice she doesn't have her glasses anymore. \nPAUL (voice over) Oh, hi. Yeah. I know. I-I...Yes, I miss you, too. I did. I made all the arrangements. \nBack to Paul standing by the bed and talking in the telephone. \nPAUL Yeah, look. I... Okay, I have to run. But I'll see you later, okay ? Okay. \nHe puts the phone down on its hook, and starts walking out of the room. He stops, thinks for a couple of seconds, turns around, sits on the bed and picks up the phone. Back to Carol under the bed. The bed frame hits her back when Paul sits on it. She looks up. We hear Paul dialing a number. \nPAUL (voice over) Extension five. Well, keep ringing, would you please ? Because I just talked to her. What ? Okay. Uh, will you tell her... yes, tell her that Tom called. Tom. Thank you. \nBack to Paul sitting on the bed. He puts the phone down on its hook, stands up and starts walking out of the room. \nBack to Carol under the bed, waiting for Paul to get out of his apartment. \nNEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nStarting from street level, the camera tilts up along a very modern office building, all glass and steel. A sign, above the main entrance, says \u00ab10 East 53\u00bb. This is the building where Larry's office is located. LARRY'OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY \nFull shot of a large office room. In the forefront, a reception desk, with a young female receptionist talking to someone we still don't see. Coming from the other end of the room, Larry is walking with Marcia, a tall dark-haired lady, wearing sunglasses. \nLARRY So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little bit, but, uh... \nMARCIA Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean... \nThey are now at the reception desk level, and, since the camera is following them, we can see the young gentleman the receptionist is talking with. \nLARRY That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry about, you know ? This book makes \u00abFinnegan's Wake\u00bb look like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's- It's-It's... \nThey are now walking along a corridor. \nMARCIA You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it. \nLARRY No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great. Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own life ? They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on a sofa. \nMARCIA Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film critic. \nLARRY (voice over) Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right ? \nMARCIA No, but I put myself through school playing poker. \nThe camera pans to Larry, who is standing up at the other end of the room, looking through some documents. \nLARRY Oh, really ? Do you still play ? \nMARCIA (voice over) No, but I still know how. LARRY Yes ? Are you good ? \nMARCIA (voice over) Yeah. \nLARRY Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers. \nMARCIA (voice over) I could turn your game around in two hours. \nLARRY Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is, uh, too good to be true. \nLarry sits down with the pile of documents on his laps. The camera pans back to Marcia. She has a cigarette in her hand. \nMARCIA Well, I wouldn't say beautiful. \nLARRY (voice over) Oh, I would. \nMARCIA But I do have tremendous sex-appeal. \nThe camera pans back to Larry, who is looking through the huge pile of paper on his laps, perhaps a manuscript. \nLARRY Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ? \nMARCIA (voice over) No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do you ask ? \nLARRY Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I know he would get a big kick out of you. \nMARCIA (voice over) Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ? \nLARRY Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold. \nMARCIA (voice over) How about a cheeseburger right now ? \nThe phone rings. \n", "test1_true": "LARRY You know, we could, we could do... (talking into the telephone) Hallo. Yes ? Where are you ? \nThe camera pans back to Marcia, who listens to Larry, smoking her cigarette. \nLARRY (voice over) Is everything okay ? Really ? No, I could, sure. \nThe camera pans back to Larry. \nLARRY I could. Yeah. I need-I need, you know, five minutes, or so. Okay. Yes. Yes. I know where it is. Okay, hold on. \nHe puts the telephone down on its hook. \nLARRY I can't do it. I have to... My wife, I have a little thing I have to do. I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week, or something. \nThe camera pans back to Marcia, who is smiling. \nMARCIA Story of my life ! \nShe crushes her cigarette in and ashtray and stands up. \nNEW-YORK - A PARK - EXTERIOR DAY \nFull shot of a round concrete pond, with a fountain in the middle pouring water. In the background, a meadow, with chairs scattered on it. Carol is standing by the pond. Larry is talking to her, looking very nervous. \nLARRY What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment ? Are you nuts ? \nCAROL Oh, stop being such a fuddy-dud. \nLARRY A fuddy-dud ? \nCarol starts walking around the pond. Larry follows her. \nCAROL Yeah. \nLARRY What are you talking about ? That's a crime. You can't do that. You... That's-That's burglary and breaking and entering. But... What has gotten into you lately ? For crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause. \nCAROL It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in. \nLARRY Hey, look. Do... I don't want to... You-You'll wind up rooming with John Gotti. You can't do that. You can't just steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment. \nCAROL Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay ? Okay ? \nLARRY I don't wanna know. I don't wanna be an accessory. \nCAROL He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named Helen Moss. \nLARRY Tell Ted. I don't want to know. Leave me alone. \nThey keep on walking around the pond, the camera following them from a fixed location. They are now hidden by the fountain. \nCAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) I told Ted. \nLARRY (voice over from behind the fountain) You told Ted before you told me ? \nCAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) Yeah. He's more open-minded about these things. \nLARRY (voice over from behind the fountain) Yes, I know. I'm-I'm-I'm a bore. I'm-Because I-Because I don't break the law, you know ? \nCAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) Yeah. \nLARRY (voice over from behind the fountain) I live within the Constitution, so I'm dull. \nCAROL (voice over from behind the fountain) Listen. Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay ? \nThey appear back from behind the fountain. \nLARRY I-I don't wanna hear. Leave me alone. Don't tell me. \nCAROL He talked on the phone with a woman. \nLARRY How do you know ? CAROL Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you know, so... \nLARRY He did ? \nCAROL Yeah, but I hid under the bed. \nLARRY You hid under his bed ? \nCAROL He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all. \nLARRY I cannot believe this. My stomach is curdling, here I... \nCAROL He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you know ? He kept saying stuff like, you know, \u00abdon't worry, it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together.\u00bb That kind of thing. \nThey keep on walking around the pond, slowly coming back toward the camera, which moves a little to meet them. \nLARRY But what would you have done if he, if he found you out ? \nCAROL I know, listen, I-I couldn't think that far ahead. \nLARRY That far ahead ? You're talking two seconds. \nCAROL No, I c... \nLARRY He could have looked under the bed and there you are. What do you... \nCAROL Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. He-He called this woman back. Probably this-this Helen Moss woman, right ? \nLARRY I don't wanna know. Leave me alone. \nCAROL And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he leaves this message, and he says : \u00abTell her Tom called\u00bb. You know what I'm saying ? Tom. Tom, Larry. \nThey are back at the same place where we saw them first by the pond. They stop walking. LARRY Yeah, yeah. I... I know, I get it, his name is Paul, but I don't care. I don't wanna hear. \nCAROL Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did... \nLARRY I just don't... \nCAROL I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think a private eye could have done any better than me. I put everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I made one mistake. \nLARRY What ? \nCAROL I left my reading glasses on his table. \nLarry looks at her with a very puzzled eye. \nLARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium close shot on Paul's apartment front door. We get a close shot of the back of Carol's head. The door opens on Paul. \nCAROL Oh, hallo. Hi. I-I thought I'd bring you some chocolate mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert. \nCarol walks rapidly inside the apartment, followed by Larry. Paul looks a bit surprised by this intrusion. He follows them along the corridor. He doesn't even close his front door ! \nPAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT The camera follows the three persons along the corridor. \nPAUL Well, thank you. \nCAROL I thought I'd-I'd give you, you know, another shot at something really delicious. Do you want me to serve that for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's still fresh. \nThe shot becoming a bit wider, we notice that Paul is carrying the tray of chocolate mousse that Carol gave him when entering his apartment. \nLARRY And you can divide it up and we can all have some. \nCAROL That'd be great. That's a great idea. LARRY You'll really like this dessert. \nPAUL Okay, I'll get some plates for it. Wait a minute. \nPaul walks out of the corridor toward his kitchen, and Carol rushes into the living-room. \nCAROL Okay, that'd be really good. \n", "test1_id": 1992, "test2_input": "CAROL Okay. TED Well, you know, you would be my first choice. \nCAROL Me, huh ? \nTED Yeah. \nCarol laughs. \nCAROL Well. Oh, boy. \nTED Well, you... Can I give you a lift ? Do you, uh, I'm gonna go east. Do you... \nCAROL Thanks. No, I-I think I'll stick around, I need to think. I need my... I feel a little, you know, tipsy. TED I didn't offend you by what I said, did I ? \nCAROL No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You didn't offend me, no, I was very, uh, flattered by this, Ted. Flattered. Well, anyway. \nTED See you later. \nHe stands up and bumps into a low table in front of the sofa. \nCAROL See you. Oops, careful. Whoops. \nTED Sorry. Excuse me. \nCAROL Excuse me. \nCarol looks at him walking away with a strange expression in her eyes. \nNEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY \nMedium tracking shot of Ted walking on the sidewalk, coming from the lounge and toward us. \nMedium low-angle shot of one of the window of the lounge, seen from the street. This shot is low-angled because the lounge is located slightly above street level. Carol is seated in front of the window, looking very pensive. She takes a sip of her glass of wine. She looks absently though the window. \nNEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY The street seen through the window, next to which Carol is seated, but we don't actually see Carol. We see a big car, followed by a bus. The camera zooms on the bus. Through one of the bus windows, we see a woman, seated inside the bus. And this woman looks very much like the deceased Lilian, Paul's wife. \nNEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY \nClose shot on the window, in front of which Carol is seated. She looks at the passing bus, with a wide open mouth, and a surprised, almost frightened, expression on her face. She stands up a little and then sits back. \nNEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY \nFull view of the room. In the background, Carol, still seated by the window. She stands up, picks up her purse, and starts crossing the room, bumping into people. She reaches the staircase, and walks downstairs. \nNEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY Full view on the entrance of the lounge. Carol is walking rapidly down the stairs leading to the entrance. She reaches the sidewalk, and looks around her for the bus. She walks away from the lounge and toward us, with the camera on a tracking shot in front of her. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot of Larry working in the kitchen, putting things away in the cupboards. Behind him, we see the front hall. The front door opens and Carol walks in. \nLARRY I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick, today. \nCarols closes the door and leans on the wall. But Larry doesn't seem to understand that something is wrong with her. He walks away to the sitting room. He keeps on talking in voice over, while Carol is still leaning on the wall of the front hall. \nLARRY (voice over) Really beautiful. It's cashmere. Very expensive. The kid looked so handsome in it, though. Also, I decided I'd cook dinner tonight. My one dish tuna casserole. \nLarry comes back in the kitchen and looks at his wife, but still doesn't seem to notice that something is wrong. We follow Larry into the sitting-room. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nLarry is setting the table for dinner \nCAROL (voice over) Well, no wonder he had her cremated. \nLARRY What ? \nCAROL (voice over) Mrs. House. \nLARRY Oh, Jesus. You're not about Mrs. House again. I thought we'd have a light dinner, you know, because we had a rich lunch at Twenty-One, I thought. \nThe camera pans to Carol standing at the entrance of the room and leaning on the wall \nCAROL Larry. \nLARRY (voice over) What ? \nCAROL I just saw Mrs. House. LARRY (voice over) What are you talking about ? The ashes ? \nCAROL No, no, no. A bus. It passed me, and she was on it. \nLarry joins Carol. \nLARRY Uh, the dead woman passed you on a bus ? Which bus was this, the bus to heaven ? \nLarry walks away toward the kitchen. Carol follows him. \nCAROL No, but I'm not, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm telling you something. I'm telling you, I really saw her. I actually saw her. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY \nLarry is checking his cooking. \nLARRY Uh-huh. Uh-huh. \nCAROL Yeah. \nLarry takes two wine-glasses out of the sink. \nLARRY You want to lie down for a while ? We'll put a cold compress on your head, or a hot compress on your back, or... \nCAROL No, Larry, you know, I was at the wine-tasting, right ? And I was just... I was sitting at, you know, a bay window. I-I happened to look out. A bus passed, and she was on it, Larry. \nLARRY Remember I said to you ? Yes, remember I said to you, spit it out ? \nCAROL I... \nLARRY I said don't drink it. You said you were going to a wine- tasting ? \nCAROL But ? \nLARRY You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon ? I said spit it out ? CAROL Yeah... \nLARRY I said don't swallow it ? You swallowed it. And that's why you're this way. \nCAROL I know. I know. Okay. I-I... Yeah. I had a few drinks, but it's-it's not... I mean, I saw her. \nLarry puts the glasses away on the dinner table. \nLARRY Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her. \nCAROL I ... \nLARRY How could you see her ? She's dead. Not only is she dead, she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween. \nThey walk into the sitting-room. \nLARRY'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nCAROL Okay. Are you telling me that you... That, that, that, that you... That I didn't see her ? Is that what you're saying ? \nLARRY I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City transit system. \nCAROL I just... I just don't know what's happening, Larry. I-I-I don't know what's going on. \nLARRY What's going on ? \nCAROL What's... yeah. \nLARRY Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown. Okay ? Is that enough ? \nCAROL I... \nLARRY Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now forget this. \n", "test2_true": "He opens the dish he had put earlier on the table. \nCAROL Honey, you're getting so close-minded these days. I just... \nThe phone rings. \nCAROL Oh. Oh, God. \nShe picks up the phone from the wall. Larry sits at the table. \nCAROL Hallo ? Ted. Ted. \nLARRY Oh, Ted. Ted. \nCAROL Ted, you're not going to believe this, but, Ted, I saw Mrs. House. Yes, Mrs. House. Yeah. Mrs... the murdered woman. That's right. \nLarry opens the red wine bottle and pours some wine in his glass. \nLARRY She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary. It was a coronary, folks. It was a coronary. She wasn't murdered. I don't know what they're talking about. \nCAROL Yeah. No, I'm sure. I'm sure I saw her. She was on a bus, you know ? I mean, I-I saw her just moments after you left. I was looking out the... Larry puts the cork back on the bottle. \nLARRY He was at the wine tasting, too. Sure, why not. \nCAROL Would you ? \nLARRY They're both at the wine tasting. \nCAROL Would you really ? Oh, that would be so great. You'd just run a check on Paul and Lillian House. \nLarry stands up and walks toward Carol. \nLARRY Don't run a check. Don't run a check. \nHe takes the phone from Carol's hand. CAROL What are you talking... \nLARRY Stop. \nCAROL What are you doing ? I mean... \nLarry talks to Ted on the phone. \nLARRY Listen, could you call back later, because my marriage is falling apart. \nHe puts the phone down. \nCAROL Larry, what are you... But, what ? \nLARRY Forget it. Will you ? If you're gonna have an affair with the guy, you don't need a murder to do it. \nCAROL I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House. \nLarry sits back at the table. \nLARRY Yes, I know, on the bus, the dead persons' bus. No car fare. \nCAROL I s...Okay. \nLARRY Now, sit down. Let's... \nCAROL Now look. Just... I can tell you. I can show you the exact spot, Larry. \nLARRY Yeah, I'm not going to see the exact spot. \nCAROL Uh ? What about lunch ? Tomorrow ? \nLARRY No, I've got a business lunch tomorrow.

Bluff, bluff. \nNEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nLong shot of a street covered with iron works.

Come on! \nLarry opens the trunk. PAUL Step back! \nLarry takes something in the trunk, then closes it back, but the door of the trunk doesn't close well and opens again. Larry walks back to Paul and shows him what he's got in his hand. \nLARRY No, no, I got her. See, if I don't have her, how come I got her ring ? I got her ring, there. This is... This is her ring. \nPAUL I think you're lying ! \nHe walks to the open trunk. \nLARRY It's a... No, no, no, no. Uh. \nPaul takes a bad-looking dummy out of the trunk. Apparently, it is an amateur dummy that Larry has made himself. \nPAUL What is this ? What is this ? \nHe throws the dummy back in the trunk. \nLARRY I could never bluff. \nPAUL What ? \nLARRY I... I... I've lost a fortune in cards over the years. PAUL Listen to me. \nLARRY I'm not a bluffer. \nPAUL I'm going to put a...

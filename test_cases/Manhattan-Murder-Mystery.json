The first... Wait. I should... (to Paul, with a much louder voice) Uh, how-How are you doing in there ? You need... \nLarry drops things on the floor. With a nervous gesture, Carol shushes him. \nCAROL You need any help ? \nThe camera pans to the kitchen, where Paul is preparing the dessert. \nPAUL No, I'm fine. I'll be right in. CAROL (voice over) Um... Okay, great. \nThe camera pans back to the living room, where Larry is still nervously messing things on the desk. Then he starts moving around the room, looking for his wife's glasses. Carol puts things back in order on the desk. Larry walks to her, and whisper something we can't understand. \nLARRY (to Paul, with a louder voice) Are you okay ? Can-can-can-can we do anything for you ? \nPAUL (voice over from the kitchen) Coffee or tea ? \nCAROL Tea. It's what... I'd like to have some tea. \nPaul walks into the room, with a pair of glasses in his hand. \nPAUL You know, I found your glasses. \nCAROL Mine ? \nPAUL These are yours, aren't they ? \nCAROL Yes. \nLARRY No. \nCAROL Uh, no. Yeah. Uh... No no no no no. They... They... Oh, God. \nCarol and Larry both look very nervous. Carol takes the glasses from Paul's hand. \nLARRY No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually. They are, aren't they ? These-These-These ones, are. \nCAROL They are actually... They're mine. Honey, they're mine. I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I must have left them here. It's the strangest thing. \nPAUL Did you ? I didn't notice that. \nCAROL No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ? \nCarol and Larry both look very embarrassed. Paul looks at them with a slight surprised eye. \nLARRY At your mother's house. \nCAROL That's right. Of course, so... \nShe turns toward Paul, who has remained very calm. \nPAUL That mousse looks fabulous. \nCAROL Anyway, it's so good. I love mousse. \nPAUL Thank you very much. \nCAROL Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in the Caribbean ? PAUL Very much. Very much. \nCAROL Uh uh. \nPAUL That's funny. I found those glasses under my bed. \nCAROL That's because I must have dropped them and they probably got kicked under. \nLARRY Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop... \nCAROL They were just... \nLARRY She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around the house. \nCAROL They f... \nPAUL The mousse ? \nHe walks away to the kitchen, with a strange smile on his face. \nLARRY She's always-She's always kick... \nCarol looks at Larry with a meaning look, to make him stop rambling.

The traffic's murder. \nCarol runs to the car. \nCAROL I know, but where... where are we going ? \nTED (voice over from inside the car) I looked up, looked up Helen Moss in the phone book. \nCarol climbs into the car and closes the door. \nCAROL (voice over from inside the car) Yeah. \nTED (voice over from inside the car) It was just H. Moss. \nCAROL (voice over from inside the car) Right. \nTED (voice over from inside the car) So I-it's on Bank Street... \nThe car drives away, with Ted's voice fading as the car gets away from us. \nTED (voice over from inside the car) Bank Street... we're going to go down and do surveillance. I got a lot whole of food. It's great. I called up this... I called this number. \nNEW-YORK - BANK STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nFull view of the corner of two very quiet streets. A brick building covered with vines. The camera pans away from the building to Ted's car parked on the other side of the street corner. Medium shot of the inside of the car, through the open window on the passenger's side, Carol's side. \nTED There's her house. \nCAROL Right. So we should just sit here and wait, huh ? \nTED Yeah. \nCAROL Okay. \nThey look at each other and laugh. \nSlightly later. Medium shot through the windshield. The view is a little blurred by the daylight reflection on the windshield. \nTED Maybe he thought that if he, if he, if he divorced her, she'd-she'd hit him for a ton of alimony. Or maybe she, maybe she controls the family fortune. What do you think of that ? \nCAROL Oh, I don't know. Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted. Maybe we're just, you know... I mean, maybe she died of natural causes, like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little shot of adrenaline. \nTed looks through the paper food-bag he has brought with him. \nTED Does yours ?

Two people, a male and a female, are coming out of the brick building. CAROL (voice over) What ? What ? What ? What ? \nTED (yelling in voice over) Helen ! Helen ! (Back to a normal low voice) Duck, duck, duck ! \nNeither one of the couple has turned around at the sound of Ted's yelling, and they start walking down the street, away from the corner. \nCAROL (voice over) Ted! God, oh...Oh. \nTED (yelling in voice over) Helen ! \nThe camera pans back to the car, looking through the open window on the passenger's side. Carol is hiding under the dashboard. Ted is hiding his face with his paper bag, holding a paper cup in the other hand. TED It's not her. \nCAROL It's not her ? \nShe sits back in her seat. \nTED No, it's not her. \nCarol laughs. \nTED What... \nCAROL Oh, God, you really have this worked out, don't you ? \nShe keeps on laughing. Ted starts laughing too. \nSlightly later. It is raining. It is still the same medium shot through the passenger's window, but the window is now closed, with the rain pouring on the window-pane. \nTED I figured she'd come out and go to work, you know ? \nCAROL Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's like... you and she has writers hours. \nTED I'm writing a play about something that happened to you and me. \nCAROL Oh, God. Oh, dear. What ? \nTED Remember-Remember that time... you and... you and I and Larry and Julie were all on that-that eating tour of France ? \nCAROL Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. \nTED And they, and then they wandered off and they forgot to pick us up ? You remember ? We had to share that bed-and- breakfast place. \nCAROL Right. Do you remember those wonderful cottages ? \nTED Yeah. \nCAROL And I remember... that we shared a bedroom together, right ? \nTED Yeah, but not a bed. \nThe camera pans away from the car to the other corner of the street. Someone is coming out of the brick building. It is apparently a male wearing white pants. He opens an umbrella. \nCAROL (voice over) No, not a... Well, God. You were too gentlemanly to suggest that. \nTED Well, it's not... Not that I didn't think of it. \nThe camera follows the man with white pants, while he is crossing the street on the other side of the street from the car. \nCAROL No. Well, I knew what was going on in your mind... because of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux, remember ? \nThe camera is back behind the passenger's window of the car. Though the car-windows, we see the white-pants-man walking on the sidewalk on the other side of the street. Ted and Carol do not seem to notice him at all. \nTED It could have been our little secret, then you passed out. \nCAROL Well, you... Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago, doesn't it ? \nTED Not that long ago. \nSlightly later. The rain has stopped. Same shot through the passenger's window of the car, but the window is now open again. \nA long pause. Ted and Carol seem to be both lost them in their own thoughts. Then Ted gives a look outside and comes back to attention. \nTED Look, look, look, look. \nCAROL Oh, what ? \nThe camera pans to the other side of the street. A woman is coming out of the brick building. \nTED (yelling in voice over) Helen ! (with a softer voice) Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck ! On the other side of the street, the woman has stopped and is looking around her. \nCAROL (voice over) Oh, god, yeah. Right. \nTED (voice over) She didn't see us. She didn't see us. \nCAROL (voice over) No ? No. That's gotta be her. \nTED (voice over) I'll bet it's... \nThe woman starts walking again on the sidewalk. \nCAROL (voice over) Are you sure ? \nTED (voice over) I mean, she answered to Helen. \nCAROL (voice over) She answers to... She's pretty. \nTED (voice over) Yeah, I'll say. \nThe woman has reached the corner of the street and she lifts her arm. CAROL (voice over) She's... What is she doing ? She's getting a... \nTED (voice over) She's getting a cab. A yellow cab stops near the woman. \nCAROL (voice over) Okay, okay. Hold on. \nTED (voice over) Keep-Keep down. \nCAROL (voice over) Okay, don't worry. Don't worry. \nTED (voice over) I'm gonna follow her. \nCAROL (voice over) All right. \nThe woman opens the cab door and climbs into it. \nNEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nLong shot of a street covered with a metal structure. We could be under a commuter train bridge. The yellow cab is driving toward us. The cab stops at the corner of the street with another street. The woman comes out of the cab, and walks away on the sidewalk of the other street. The camera pans back to the first street and we see Ted's car coming toward us. The camera stops at the corner of the street and Carol walks out of the car. She runs in the direction of Helen, and waves Ted to join her. The camera pans to the end of the street, which actually is a dead end street with the back door of a movie house. The woman enters the movie house. \nPAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot of a door leading to an emergency stair way. Helen, the woman we just saw coming out of the yellow cab, is coming down the steps and through the door. She is blonde, young and pretty. \nPAUL (voice over) Watch your step. It's very steep. Be careful. \nBehind Helen, Paul is coming out of the stairway. Helen has stopped to look around her. \nHELEN Oh, this is beautiful. \nPAUL Isn't it ? \nHELEN Yeah. \nThe camera pans away from the couple toward the main hall of the movie house. It is an old-fashioned movie house, with red velvet seats, and a carved balcony. \n", "test1_id": 1992, "test2_input": "LARRY Th-Th-These are my matches.

Beside the light of the match, there is some other dim light coming from somewhere in the basement. \nLARRY I like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table.

I keep hearing noises. \nCAROL Oh. What's down there ? \nCarol walks rapidly toward a dark section of the corridor. The camera follows her. \nLARRY Where ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me. \nCAROL Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh ! \nShe has reached a door with a barred window showing the street outside. \nCAROL Yeah. I think this is it.

At this early hour of the night, the bridge still has a lot of traffic moving on it. Then the camera moves down to get a closer look of the traffic on the bridge. \nLARRY (voice over from inside the car) Oh, Jesus. I-I can't c... I can't follow his car. \nThe camera follows the moving traffic on the bridge, and certainly also follows Larry's car, even though, from this height, we can't tell which car it is. \nCAROL (voice over from inside the car) Well, he's right up ahead. He's right there. \nLARRY (voice over from inside the car) Where, up ahead ? I don't know which car I'm following here. I... You know, I'm not a good driver. I can't chase somebody in a car.

They pass the \u00ab15W\u00bb exit. \nNEW-YORK - INDUSTRIAL PARK - EXTERIOR NIGHT Long shot inside an industrial park, somewhere on the outskirts of New-York.

LARRY (voice over from inside the car) Be careful, be careful, be careful. \nThey both get out of the car, and they start walking toward the place where Carol saw the other car. \nThey reach the other car surrounded by huge piles of metal scrap. The car and the scenery around it are lit by a powerful red light. Carol and Larry run toward the place where the red light comes from. It is inside a huge building. But they don't go inside the building and, instead, keep on running along the building. \nMedium shot on Larry and Carol. Carol stops Larry and points at something. \nCAROL Look, look ! \nThe camera pans to the thing Carol was pointing at. A body, half- wrapped in a white sheet, is being lifted by a huge electromagnet.

Then the camera pans to a reverse angle medium shot on Larry and Carol coming out between rows of huge heavy-duty bags. \nReverse angle medium shot on a huge cauldron full of hot melted metal.

Among the metal scraps, we see Mrs. House's body \nCAROL Oh, my God. \nThe camera zooms to a close shot on the cauldron. \nLARRY (voice over) Good bye, Mrs. House. \nReverse angle shot on Larry and Carol. Then reverse angle long shot on the cauldron. A lot of bright sparks are coming out of the cauldron. \nLong shot on the building. Larry and Carol are coming out of the building.

He starts the car and drives away. \nThe camera pans around toward Carol and Larry, still running - too late - toward Paul's car. \nLARRY That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House. \nCAROL What are we gonna do ? \nThey run after the departing car. \nNEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nFull shot of Larry's car.

We've got no body. We've got nothing, Larry. \nLarry looks away from her and puts his hand on his mouth, as if frightened by something \nLARRY Ohhh !... \nCAROL What ? What ? What's wrong ? What? Oh !... \nThe camera turns around Larry and Carol and, located now behind Larry's back, gives us a full shot of the entrance of Larry's building. \nCAROL Oh, my God.

You're jealous because he's-he's interested in her. \nTED I'm interested in her theory. What... I don't...

We pretend that he slipped up, and the molten steel didn't do the job ? What- What do you mean ? \nThe camera pans back to Marcia. MARCIA Yeah, it's possible. He saw you there, he knows you're onto him. After he ran away, why couldn't you have retrieved the body ? \nLARRY You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a shoulder, maybe, at most. \nMARCIA Well, that's... Okay, okay, you have the body. What does he know ? He was probably too scared to be very lucid. \nThe camera pans to Ted, who looks at Marcia with worshipping eyes. \nMARCIA (voice over) He's an amateur. He dumped the body and ran off, and then somehow - who knows the details, you two dug her out. Now, you can send him to the chair. \nCAROL Okay, okay, just... \nTED I like this woman, she's lurid. \nCAROL Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us, okay ? \nThe camera pans on Larry. \nLARRY Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie without giggling, so-so... \nThe camera pans to Carol. CAROL Yeah. No, because if we really had the body, why tell him ? Why not go straight to the Police ? \nThe camera pans to Marcia. \nMARCIA If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down. \nMedium shot on another table, around which two middle-aged men are seated, listening very eagerly to the conversation. \nTED (voice over) Oh, she's wicked. Oh, I-look... look how, look how this works out. You go to the law, what do you gain ? \nMedium close shot on Ted and Carol. \nTED I mean, so-so maybe they, you know, they put him in jail. What have you got ? You haven't got anything. LARRY (voice over) Right. \nTED But if he wants the evidence, and he's got to pay for it, now... Okay, now he's nervous, right ? \nCAROL Yeah, you know, wait. There's just so many fallacies in this, I can't even count them. \nThe camera pans to Marcia and Larry. \nTED (voice over) What ? Name one. \nCAROL (voice over) Name one? Okay, the guy looks us straight in the eyes and says, \u00abWhat body? What the hell are you talking about ?

He's gotten away with the first murder. \nMedium close shot on Carol and Ted. \nLARRY (voice over) You know what I'm thinking, though ? \nThe camera pans to Marcia and Larry. \nMARCIA What ? \nLARRY Actually, in the book what happens is, now that I think of it, he... he kills the... the two people that are working the scheme on him. \nTED (voice over) Yeah, that's all right. CAROL (voice over) But... \nTED (voice over) But you're not worried about that. \nLARRY Um, well, I don't know. \nMARCIA It's perfect. \nLARRY Either that, or I've... I've just developed Parkinson's. \nThe camera zooms back, to show us the four people around the table. \nTED No, we can handle him. We can handle him. Listen, this is incredible. This is an incredible idea. MARCIA It's perfect. It's perfect. He knows you're onto him. You shake him down. \nCAROL No, no. \nMARCIA He comes after you, we nab him. \nThe camera stops zooming back and gives us a full shot on the table. \nTED That's great. It's great. You're wonderful. I just... I'm amazed. \nMARCIA Yeah. \nCAROL I... I just... \nMARCIA It's either that, or he walks. \nCAROL Yeah. Yeah, wait. I... So, what you're saying is... \nTED This is great. \nCAROL Wait, no, okay... What you're saying... Oh boy. You're saying, you want to provoke Mr. House into trying to murder Larry and me. MARCIA Yeah. It's perfect. You're not scared, are you ? \nLARRY No, no, no, no, no, I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm just turning it over in my mind. I just want to check with my clergyman before we commit. \nNEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot on Helen Moss, making a phone call from an open booth in the street. While she is talking, the camera comes closer to her, to a medium close shot on her face. \nHELEN Hi, uh, B-twenty-four messages ? Oh, really ? Audition for what ? Did he say ? Okay, okay. Wait, hold on. \nShe looks into her purse and gets her agenda out of it. \nHELEN Let me get a pencil. Okay. TED'S THEATRE - STAGE - INTERIOR DAY \nFull slightly high-angled shot on the stage. In the middle of the stage floor, a white circle, on which there is a chair and a small table with a telephone. Suzanne Raphael, a young woman, is auditioning. She is seated on the chair, holding the telephone. Behind Suzanne, which is the left side of the stage seen from the audience, a white wall, with a doorless opening. On either side of the wall, two red columns. And on either side of the girl, which are the front and the back of the stage, two red metallic frames. In front of the girl, a video camera on a tripod, with an operator standing behind the camera. Actually, the operator is Sy, Larry and Carol's friend, whom we have seen much earlier in the film, in the antique market and at Elaine's restaurant. The stage is well lit, when the audience hall is in the dark. \nSUZANNE Yeah, well, Dad, you know, I've heard just about enough of this. \nShe slams the phone down. The camera pans around to show us the right side of the stage, where there is several rows of theatre seats and a table in front of the seats. Ted, Marcia and Marilyn are seated in the front row. Marilyn is Sy's wife, whom we have also seen earlier in the film. Carol is seated in the second row, behind Marcia. \nTED Good, that's great. Thank you, Suzanne. Thank you. \nMARCIA We'll let you know. That's Suzanne Raphael, right ? \nTED Yeah. Good, thank you. \nCarol taps on Marilyn's shoulder, and whispers something to her. Ted joins them in their whispered conversation. The camera pans back on the stage. Larry, with a clipboard in his hand, has entered the stage, pushing Helen in front of him. \nLARRY This is Helen Moss. \nHELEN Hi, there. \nCAROL (voice over) Hi, there. \nMARCIA (voice over) Hi. \nHELEN Hi. \nMedium close shot on Ted, who stands up, and walks toward the stage. The camera follows him. TED Uh, have you, uh... I know, I know you just got the material, uh, you know, just in the... last little while, but... uh, h-have you had a chance to-to study it ? To go over it, a little bit ? \nThe camera pans to a medium close shot of Helen. \nHELEN Yes, yes. Uh, I have, but, um, I have just a few questions. \nTED Sure , yeah. \nThe camera moves slightly, and is now located behind Ted's back, still with Helen in medium close shot. \nHELEN Is she divorced, in this ? \nTED Uh, yes. Yes. \nHELEN Uh, recently ? \nTED Yes. Yeah. But she's, uh, very, highly emotional. \nHELEN Yeah. \nTED You know really... uh, lot of... Lot of feeling. Very strong. \nHELEN Oh. TED Hm ? \nHELEN Should I just begin ? \n", "test3_id": 1994}

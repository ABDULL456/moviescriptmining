It fits perfectly. \nGUMP (nodding approval): It will turn a broadhead arrow ar fifty yards. \nSCREWBALL: He might pass for a champion in that. \nGUMP: Have a look at yourself, Jack. (pointing: Use yonder shield for a mirror. \nJACK(confused): ....Shield? \nGUMP(exasperated): The round shiny thing over there. \nSCREWBALL: Clothes never made the man.... \nGump silences Screwball with a stern look and and stalks over to a small carved desk. \nThere is a loud, MUSICAL CHIME. Gump pulls a remarkable instrument from a pouch on his belt: a wonderous crystal globe filled with whirling miniature worlds. \nGUMP(studying globe): Hmmm... getting late. Almost half- way past the morning mayfly hatch... SCREWBALL(sullen): Too cold for mayflies now.... 'Sides, I ain't got no timepeice. \nGUMP: You first must know how to tell the time. \nSCREWBALL: I ain't got nothing.... \nGUMP: No more chatter....! I've got work to do. \nGump sits at the desk setting his timepeice beside him and rummaging among his papers. \nJack kneels before a brightly polished shield and studies his reflection. \nLuna round and round his head. \nSCREWBALL: Think I'll brew some tea. \nScrewball snatches variosu herbs off the ceiling. \nSCREWBALL(cont): Colt's foot and sassafrass... Maybe a spot of spearmint.... St John's Wort not bad.... and a little foxglove. \nScrewball feverishly stuffs a silver teapot full of dried herbs. \n56 DELETED \n57 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY \nThe unicorn's flowering footprints lead Lili to Gump's cave. \nShe pauses to consider the situation. Snowflakes glisten in her tangled hair. She is fiercly beautiful. \nDeciding nothing is amiss, Lili stalks silently inside. \n58 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY \nA small cooking fire flickers under blackened pots and an iron skillet. The mare unicorn is bedded down on a blanket of straw. Brown Tom lies fast asleep against her flank. \nThe unicorn lifts her head when Lili tiptoes in. \nBrown Tom is jerked awake as the mare climbs to her feet, snorting with rage. \nBROWN TOM: What....? What....? Who's there? \nLILI: I'm Princess Lili.... I..... \nBROWN TOM: You! You're the cause of all our sorrow! \nThe Princess drops to her knees. \nLILI: I know it was wrong.... Everything is my fault. (weeping) Please.... please forgive me. \nBROWN TOM: I ain't the one ye should be asking. \nLILI: I want to make it up to her.... I followed the goblins! They gave the alicorn to the Lord of Darkness! \nBROWN TOM: Good lass! You're a plucky little partridge at that. \nLILI: We can't stay here! It's not safe!

If I found her, so will they....We msut go! \n59 DELETED \n60 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY \nBrown Tom looks past Lili to the mouth of the cave. \nBROWN TOM: Too late! \nPox and Blix stand in the entrance, aiming their wicked, barbed arrows straight at the hearts of Lili and Brown Tom. \nBrown Tom swings an iron skillet back over his head in a warrior's stance. \nBROWN TOM: If you imps're looking for a fight, ye've come to the chap who'll oblige ye. \nBLIX/POX: Kill....! K-k-kill...! Kill...! \nBlix and Pox loose their arrows, renocking the bows with incredible speed. \nBrown Tom moves like lightning, using the skillet as a shirld to deflect the arrows raining about him. \nLili stands in front of the mare, striving to protect the unicorn's body with her own. \nBrown Tom lepas acrobatically about with the skillet. A fusillade of arrows CLANGS OFF its iron surface. \nA lucky shot peirces Brown Tom's hat. Dark red liquid streams down his face. His eyes roll up in mortal terror. \n", "test1_true": "Brown Tom staggers in a dramatic half-circle, toppling straight over backwards, stiff as a board. \nThe mare unicorn rears WHINNYING on her hind-quarters. \nThe goblin hunters advance.

He sits stop a jewel cask enjoying a cup. A horned Viking helmet several sizes too large covers his head down to the bridge of his nose. \nGump works at his desk, marking out distances on an ancient chart with a pair of golden dividers. Dozens of parchment mps are spread in front of him. \nGUMP(muttering): Forty leagues from the Dragon's Track.... another half-span past the basilisk den. \nGump lifts his elbow and the curled parchment rolls together. \nGUMP (cont)(annoyed): Wirrikows and dopplegangers! \nSCREWBALL: Spot of tea, Gump....? Help calm your nerves... \nGUMP: Not now! I'm busy with navigation. \nOn the other side of the cave, Jack practices a variety of thrusts and passes with his sword in front of the polished shield. \nLuna buzzes around him like a miniature meteorite. \nJACK: That's not so bad.... What do you think, Luna? \nJack studies his reflection in the shield. \nThere is a BURST OF LIGHT behind him. Luna materialises as a child- sized woman with gossamer wings. She wraps her slender arms around his neck. \nLUNA: I think you look like a hero. \nJACK: What! H'd you do that? \nJack spins around, but Luna is gone. Only the tiny dot of LIGHT hovers in the air. \nJACK(cont) (puzzled): Magic.... \nJack looks back at the shield and there is a full-sized Luna hugging his reflection. \nLUNA: Nobody knows nut you. it's our secret.... (kissing his cheek) Promise? \nJACK (squirming): Don't do that. \nLUNA(another kiss): Better promise.... \nJACK: All right, all right.... I promise. \nA loud, MUSICAL CHIEME interrupts Gump's work. he looks around for his timepiece but it is nowhere in sight. \nGUMP: Hmmmm...? Screwball! \nSCREWBALL (all innocence): Something I can do for you, Gump? \nGUMP: Hand it over....! \nSheepishly, Screwball pulls Gump's timepeice from inside his tunic and gives it back. \nSCREWBALL: Well, well, well.... how'd that get in there? Must be some kinda magic... \nGUMP: Sneak thief's magic! (studies timepiece) Jack! it's time we were on our way! \nAt the SOUND of Gump's voice, Luna TRANSFORMS instantly back to a dot of light. \nJACK: I'm ready as I'll ever be.... \nJack picks up the shield and starts after Gump and Screwball. Luna flies overhead. \n62 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY \nBrown Tom lies flat on his back as Jack and the faeries emerge from the tunnel. \nGump rushes to his fallen friend, lifting him in his arms. \nGUMP: Brown Tom....? You can't be dead....! Oh, this is is terrible.... terrible! \nBrown Tom opens his eyes and looks feebly about. \nBROWN TOM (in a daze): Why, Wisp.... they kill you, too? \nGUMP: Course they didn't! What in blazes are you talking about? \nBrown Tom rolls his eyes up at the arrow piercing his hat. \nBROWN TOM: Goblins shot me through the brain pan. \nGump yanks off Brown Tom's hat. Bits of broken wine bottle tumble out. Gump reagrds his friend with scorn. \nGUMP: Your brains are one spot an arrow'd do no harm! \nJACK: Where's the unicorn? \nSheepishly, Brown Tom pulls the arrow from his hat. \nBROWN TOM: I'm afeered the goblins took her. Did me best to fight them off, but they swarmed up by the hundreds.... Horrid creatures they were.

A huge fire blazes in the hearth. \nPOX: Hail m-most great, and d-d-darkest of the dark! \nBLIX: Though we be nothing in your sight, We bow before your strength and might! \nWe hear Darkness speak, but see only his bat-winged shadow spread like an inky cloak across the two kneeling goblins. \nDARKNESS (os): Can you fawning sycophants do more than grovel? What of the task I set you? \nPOX: D-d-done, Lord. We have the m-m-m-m-m-m.... the unicorn. \nDARKNESS(os): Where is she? \nBLIX: In the dungeon like a treasure, Awaiting your darkest pleasure. \nDARKNESS (os): Very good.... You two are not entirely devoid of talent. \nPOX: There's m-m-more, Sire.... \nBLIX: Though unworthy of your magnificence, Trifles without consequence, We present with all due deference.... A gift. \nDARKNESS (os): Gift....? What sort of gift? \nBLIX: This thing you once called innocence. \nDARKNESS (os): Innocence...? I must behold this wonder.... \nDarkness stares into the fire. \nAs Darkness grimps the arm of his throne, his fingers start to melt, dripping to the dank stone floor. \n64 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY \nDarkness bleeds through the groin vault ceiling, speading like a stain across the curving stones. \nBelow, the unicorn is locked in a steel halter, a woven steel cable binding her to an iron windlass. \nThe Princess paces the dark and dripping cell. Her dress is in tatters, her hair tangled. There is something wild and free about her now, and yet she has never appeared more alluring. \nThe melting shadow of Darkness drips from the ceiling, forming a small demonic shape as it falls. \nWe hear the BEATING of Darkness' heart in time with each evil drip. The sound grows LOUDER and LOUDER until the echo reverberates within the vaulted chamber. \nLili is terrified. She looks frantically around as the pulsing rhytm continues. The Princess sees nothing and hugs the unicorn's neck for comfort. \n64A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nDarkness contemplates the raging flames, his heartbeat THUNDERING. \n65 EXTERIOR HILL ABOVE GREAT TREE BOG DAY \nJack and the faeries stare out at the tree-crowned ruin and surrounding bog. \n65A EXTERIOR BOG DAY \nJack and the faeries wade forward through the drifting curtains of mist. \nJACK: Legend says the Dark Castle stood in olden days when evil anarchy ruled the land.... The wicked still come here to sacrafice. \nGUMP: They worship the demon.... \nSCREWBALL: It's ugly! I hate it! \nGUMP: Good! You shall go first.... \n65B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nCLOSE ON: Darkness. For the briefest instant, we see the smouldering eyes of the demon GLOWING in anitcipation out of the shadows. \n65C EXTERIOR BOG DAY \nAlthough Jack is in no trouble, the water is rapidly growing too deep for the faeries. Gump urges Screwball forward: \nGUMP: Go on! Hurry up! \nSCREWBALL: All the time me. Same old story. \nScrewball clibs up onto a floating lily pad. \nAn undulating v-shaped wake moves through the water alongside as they step from lily pad to lily padf and clamber onto a long, twisting root. \nWithout warning, an emaciated green arm shoors out of the water and grabs Screwball. He is gone under the surface with a scream. \nBROWN TOM: Screwball! \nJACK: What was that? \nGUMP: Big trouble! \nJack grips the hilt of his sword and rushes to the spot where Screwball disappeared. \n", "test2_true": "Before Jack can finish, Meg Mucklebones rises out of the bog behind him. She tosses Screwball aside and hauls Jack into her cadaverous embrace. \nMEG: Foul tasting faerie.....! Come to me, juicy boy! \nJack YELPS in horror. \nMEG (cont): Who be this tender morsel disturbing Meg Mucklebones' rest? \nJACK(terrified): They call me Green Jack ma'am. \nThe faeries watch in dismay. \nBROWN TOM: Our champion's a goner, he is. \nThe fearsome hag pinches Jack with her wicked talons. \nMEG: What a fine fat boy you are.... \nJACK: You don't mean to eat me, do you ma'am? \nMEG: Oh, indeed I do.... \nJACK: That would be a shame, Miss Meg. You're so lovely. You deserve far better than scrawny little me.... \nThe flattery gives Hairy Meg a pause; she simply can't resist it. \nMEG: Hmmmm....think me fair, do you, Jack? \nJACK: All the heavenly angels must envy your beauty. \nMEG: Ooooo....what a find meal you'll make, be the rest of you as sweet as your tongue. \nJACK: Let me go and I'll sing songs of praise to you. \nMEG: Let you go? Don't be daft. I've had naught but muskrat and snakes all this month.... bit of rancid goblin, too.... \nJACK: But....but....don't you like my words? \nMEG: Words are little help in filling an empty stomach.... \nJACK: Then fill your soul with loveliness. Look into your glass and feast on beauty. \nMEG: There's no looking-glass here.... Sometimes, when the moon is full, I'll chance to see my reflection in the bog. \nJack glances at the shield hanging over his shoulder. \nJACK: My shield would serve you well. \nMeg Mucklebones takes Jack's shield, partially releasing him from her clammy clutches. \nMEG: What a splendid idea! You be so clever, Jack. \nHanging onto Jack with one hand, Hairy Meg bends over the shield. \nJACK: Your radiance is the alchemy that makes rusted steel shine like silver. \nMeg primps and preens: an obscene parody of a pretty maiden at her vanity table. \nMEG: Oooo! That's nice! I be the envy of any princess in the land. \nWhile Meg is pre occupied with her grotesque reflection, Gump catches the Jack's eyes. The cunning elf silently mouths the word: 'sword', pointing to his waist at the same time. \nJACK: Better, you are a queen without a peer.... a reigning angel. \nJack nods to Gump and silently draws his sword. Meg doesn't notice thing. \nMEG: You have such discerning taste for so young a boy.... \nMeg turns to face him with a fearful pucker of her tattered lips. \nMEG (cont): Come, Jack....give us a kiss before dining. \nJack petrified with fear. \nGUMP(shouting): Give her the kiss of cold steel, Jack! \nJack swings blindly with his eyes closed. It is a lucky stroke, Meg Mucklebones' head flies from her shoulders. \nJACK(astonished): I did it! \nThe decapitated hag sinks back beneath the scummy surface. \nGUMP: Like a chmapion, Jack. \nBROWN TOM: Bravo! \nJACK: How's Screwball? \nSCREWBALL: Chewed, but not disgested.... \nJack points his sword at the hollow tree. \nJACK: Then on to victory! \nFAERIES (all together): On to victory! \n65D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nA huge fire blazes in the gaping hearth.

I hate it.... \n72 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY \nThe iron-studded dungeon days swing magically open as Lili watches, her eyes aglow with animal fire. She crouches beside the unicorn, resting on her haunches in an easy feline fashion. \nLili rises like a sleepwalker, unable to resist the compulsion luring her toward the open doorway. \nThe chained unicorn WHINNIES pitifully. Princess Lili looks back without expression as she leaves. \n73 DELETED \n74 DELETED \n75 INTERIOR ANOTHER CORRIDOR DAY Luna's bobbing LIGHT leads the way as Jack and Gump hurry along the rubble-choked corridor. Alerted by the SOUND of something, they dart into the shadows. \nGUMP: Quick, Jack! \nJack and Gump watch in horror as a cracked EGG the size of a watermelon runs down the corridor on armor-scaled chicken legs, led on either side by a Demon holding a chain leash. \nJack draws his sword. The Demons stop and the Egg begins to crack. \nJACK: I'll scramble that one! \nGump restrains him. The Egg cracks apart. \nGUMP: Don't trust your eyes! All is enchanted here. \nThe Egg breaks into pieces and a dripping winged monster emerges; a diabolic cross between a bat and a pterodactyl. It emits a fearsome SHRIEK and flies off down the corridor followed by the twin attendant Demons. \nJack and Gump hurry on in the opposite direction. \n75A INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY \nScrewball and Brown Tom creep timorously forward. They are alerted by the SOUNDS of something approaching. A hideously deformed shadow fall across the opposite wall. \nThe two faeries clutch each other in terror and duck into the shadows. \nIt is Princess Lili! She passes the evles' hiding place as if in a trance. \n76 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY \nJack and Gump emerge on a narrow span arching across the vast central of the undreground castle. Similiar viaducts, above and below, bridge the awesome chasm. \nThe Green Man and the faerie gawk at the sheer magnitude of it all. \nJACK: Not even kings live like this.... \nOn a high span above, Jack sees Princess Lili drifting by like a somnabulist. \nJACK (cont): My God! Gump, look! It's Lili! \nGUMP: Don't believe it, Jack. \nJACK (yelling): Lili ! \nThe SOUND ECHOES through the vast space. \n77 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY \nThe Princess pauses. A section of parapet has broken off and she wanders to the edge, staring down into the void. For a precarious moment, she teeters on the brink, seemingly about to fall. \nJACK (os) (calling): Li-li ! The Princess does not respond, wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow edge of disaster. She leans against the ruined parapet and a bug chunk of masonry breaks away, tumbling and bouncing into the abyss. \nJACK (cont) (os) (calling): It's Ja-ack ! \nLili's face is blank. She turns and continues blindly on her way. \n78 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY \nJack stares up at Lili's retreating form. \nJACK: It's her. I know it. \nGUMP: Don't be so hasty! Remember who we're dealing with. \nJACK: I've got to reach her! \nJack races off. Gump runs along behind. \n78A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nThe shadowy figure of Darkness looms over a band of deformed PYGMIES with needle-sharp teeth and wickedly curved talons long as pitchfork tines. \nDARKNESS: My enemies approach.... destory them! Darkness points an evil finger and the Pygmies scurry CACKLING off. \n79 DELETED \n80 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY \nJack and Gump hurry out onto the arching span. The Princess is nowhere in sight. \nGUMP (running after): Slow down....! Use some caution! \n", "test3_true": "Jack runs on into the corridor in the direction taken by Lili. Gump follows after. \n81 INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY \nLili wanders down a long colonnade with dangling vine-like roots. A glistening magic rain falls from the granite ceiling. Her blank eyes stare straight ahead. \nJack and Gump appear at the opposite end of the passage in time to see the Princess drift out of sight. \nJACK: There she is....! Lili....! \nJack and Gump run to catch up, pushing through root tendrils agleam with rain. Suddenly, they are attacked by SCREAMING Pygmies. \nGUMP: Jack! \nJACK (drawing his sword): Demons! \nThe nimble Pygmies leap about them, lethal talons slashing through the drizzle. \nJack and Gump retreat, backing between clingling rootlets. \nGUMP: Quick! In here! \nGump yanks open a heavy oaken door in the side wall and they duck inside, slamming it shut in the teeth of the attacking Pygmies. \n81A INTERIOR SEALED CORRIDOR DAY \nJack strains against the door handle, struggling to keep the portal shut tight. There is less space than in a closet. The corridor behind them is completely bricked over. \nGUMP: Trapped....! \nCLOSE ON DOOR: With great force, the Pygmies' claws stab through the thick wood like stiletties. Their needle tips are mere inches from Jack and Gump. \nThe door's inner surface is studded with talons. Jack suddenly SLAMS the door open with such force it swings into the side wall with a loud CRASH. \nThe Pygmies' frenzied SCREAMING ends in abrupt SILENCE. \nJack and Gump peer cautiously out. \n81B INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY \nThe Pymies hang unconscious on the other side of the door, dangling from their imbedded talons. \nJACK: Come on! \nJack and Gump run into the rain. \n82 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY \nJack and Gump hurry around the corner just as Lili heads towards a pair of massive doors swinging slowly open at her approach. \nJACK (calling): Lili! Wait! \nGump grabs Jack's arm and yanks him to a stop. \nGUMP: Don't be daft! She's under a spell! \nLili enters and the doors swing closed behind her. \n83 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nAn enormous chamber draped with black cloth surrounded by tall Baroque columns. Winged demons writhe in the shadows above. A long black table reaches down the centre of the room. All is lit by firelight. The gaping hearth, with its entablature of monumental sculpture, is flanked by a pair of massive ebony thrones, carved in a hideous, twisting mass of tendons, sinews and museles. \nWhen the imposing doors swing closed, Lili's spell is broken. She stares in terror at her news surroundings. \nSomething weird and mysterious approaches from out of the draped shadows. It is a magnificent high-collared black gown, waltzing like a ghost across the black marble floor. There is no one wearing the garment! \nFascinated, Lili watches the dress circle towards her. She finds it irresistable. Taking hold of the gown's empty sleeves she begins to dance, spinning round and round to the impulsive music. \n84 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY \nJack paces back and forth in front of the sealed doors. \nJACK: Why did you stop me? \nGUMP: We best reconnoitre. What if it's a trap? \nGump and Jack strain to see through the crack between the doors. \n85 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nLili dances by herself, turning slow dreamy circles before the blazing fire. She is now WEARING the splendid black gown! \nReflected firelight GLITTERS in the shadows. An open jewel box spills its sparkling treasure onto an ornate table. Lili is lure like a moth to the flame. \nShe steps up onto an oversized footstool by the table. The ebony casket brims with gemstones. Lili's eyes dazzle. A carved ebony figure of a skeleton turns slowly out of the centre, holding in its up lifted arms the most exquisite black diamond necklace the mind can imagine. \nThe Princess sucks in her breath. The temptation is too great. She impulsively takes the necklace and hops down from the stool. \nThe high collar of her gown makes fastening the clasp difficult and without thinking, she backs towards the wall, fumbling behind her neck. \nShe leans against a sculpted marble frieze of souls in torment, concentrating on the tricky clasp. All at once, a piece of sculpture becomes ANIMATE. Powerful arms reach out to fasten the necklace. For a moment Lili doesn't notice, grateful for the help. Then, she realises what is happening and SCREAMS. \nThe musular black arms reach for her as she pulls away in terror. Lili turns to run, but is stopped short by her reflection in a tall cheval glass mirror. She looks furtively about, making certain she is unobserved. Alone, she admires her perfect image. \nCLOSE ON MIRROR: Beneath Lili's pleased expression we see the evil face of Darkness APPEAR like a man emerging from under water. \nDarkness penetrates the surface of the mirror. \nLili backs away, GASPING soundlessly with terror. \nDarkness steps forth through the glass into the room, clad in black finery. \nLili staggers. Darkness reaches to embrace her and the Princess SHRIEKS at the top of her lungs. The moment he touches her shoulder, she slumps tothe floor, unconscious. \n", "test3_id": 1424}

{"train": "LEGEND ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY by WILLIAM HJORTSBERG \n2nd Draft Revised 10 March 1984 \n1EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT \nHuge trees taper upward like columns supporting the roof of heaven. Moonlit dewdrops spangle a delicate spiderweb. The setting is tranquil and utterly majestic. \nOver the brow of a distant hill, a pair of brilliant light beams scintillate in an etheral ballet. \nNumerous small animals gather to behold this wonder. They stand on the hillcrest, staring down as if at the Nativity. \nSquirrels, quail, hedgehogs, mice, pheasants and badgers, natural enemies untied by the radiant LIGHT. \nA magnificent stag watches, numbers of tiny songbirds perched in his branching antlers. \n1A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT \nPULL BACK: from the hilltop, through ferns and brambles to a steep embankment where umbrella-sized toadstools cluster. \nA snarling face APPEARS under a mushroom cap. This is BLIX a brigand goblin hunter. Clad in decrepit armor and slung with savage weapons, he is a terrifying figure. \nBlix WHISTLES. The SOUND is unexpectedly lovely, a nightingale's call. \nFurther back, three other goblins return the BIRDCALL. They bristle with weaponry. POX is a pig-faced fop wearing tattered lace and flithy brocade. Tiny BLUNDER and TIC are both masked by grotesque helmets. Swarms of gnats drone above their hidden heads. They creep forward to join Blix. \n1B GOBLIN'S POV : HILLTOP \nThe distant animals silhouetted by dazzling LIGHT. \n1C EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT \nBlix signals an advance and the goblins creep through the forest towards the hilltop. \nA moth lands on a twig two feet from Tic's head. He turns. His incredibly sticky tongue uncoils from within the helmet seizing the moth and retracting with it, quick as a flash. \nAs the goblins near the hilltop, the fantastic LIGHT gradually illuminates their hideous features. A tiny mouse runs out of the eye-slits on Blunder's helmet, circles the crest, and runs back in on the other side. \nBlix signals silently for the other goblins to spread out. \nThe goblins crawl separately through the underbrush. \nPox comes snout to snout with a wild piglet. Terrified, the little shoat SQUEALS and scampers off. \n2 DELETED \n2A CLOSE : ANIMALS \nAlerted by the NOISE, they face the impending threat. The startled animals run for cover down the hillside. \n3 DELETED \n3A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT \nBlix charges forward, brandishing his crossbow. \nBLIX: Kill. . . . ! \nBlix runs over the top of the hill and down into the gully beyond, closely followed by Tic, Pox, and Blunder. Brilliant clumps of forget-me-nots are everywhere, like disgarded jewels. \n3B GOBLIN'S POV : DISTANT FOREST \nThe pair of shining LIGHT BEAMS race away between the trees. \n4 DELETED \n5 DELETED \n5A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT \nThe goblins watch the LIGHT BEAMS disappear. Blix GROWLS in frustration. \nBLUNDER(musing): . . . . Fast as a hound dog with his ass on fire. . \nBlunder spots a SHINING silver hair caught on the bark. He reaches up and plucks it free. \nPOX: What's that . . . . ? L-l-let me see, old chap. \nBLUNDER: No! It's mine! \nBlunder hides the hair behind his back, but Pox quickly grabs the other end. \nPOX: Give it to m-m-m-me! \nBoth goblins pull on the hair. Miraculously, it does not break, but stretches between them like spun steel. \nBLUNDER: Turn loose, anus features! \nPOX: Hard cheese! \nA furious tug of war. Pox pulls his knife and tries unsuccessfully to cut the hair. \nBLUNDER: It's mine you rectum! Mine! Mine! \nBlix marches up and furiously bangs their heads together. Pox and Blunder fall dazed to the ground. \nBlix holds the silver hair shining above his head and studies it. \nBLIX: Disgusting and pure, like a prayer. . .. There be magic in this hair. The beast ran off, faster and faster. We must take this to our Master. \n6 EXTERIOR VAST LANDSCAPE NIGHT \nAn incredible landscape, fantastically contoured hills rise above the monnbright mist. The four goblins dismount, tie up their devil steeds, and disappear over the brow of a hill. \nAcross the stream, the mare paces back and forth, obviously agitated. \n27 EXTERIOR BEHIND THE BOULDER DAY \nBlix pulls a long black flute from his quiver. He takes a dried hornet from a black snail-shell with a hinged lid and slips it into his flute, aiming the instrument like a blowgun. \nBLUNDER: Steady....take your time.... Don't miss... \nBlix silences the foolish golbin with a ferocious scowl. His cheeks puff. There is a soft PHUT of expelled breath. \n28 EXTERIOR CENTRE OF CLEARING DAY \nThe poisened hornet sails the air and strikes the hornet on the haunch. \nStung, the unicorn bolts through the clearing, disappearing into the undergrowth with the mare hard on his heels. \nThe Princess stands be confused and bewildered. \nDistant THUNDER disturbs the tranquility. \nJack rushes to Lili's side. \nLILI: Oh, Jack, it was so lovely... like a dream. \nJACK(angry): You're lucky it wasn't a nightmare! \nLILI: Don't be such a scold.... Come, I'll chase your fears away. \nThe Princess takes Jack by the hand and leads him from the clearing. \n29 EXTERIOR FOREST (UNICORN HUNT) DAY \nThe unicorns plunge through brambles and fern clumps. Leaping a deadfall log, the stallion stumbles. He struggles to his feet and continues running. \nThe three goblins gallop pell-mell on their devilish steeds. There is nothing comical about them now. \n30 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY \nJack and Lili sit atop a high promontory jutting over a crystalline pond. \nLILI: Sweet William did a-hunting go, In the wood where faeries dwell. From dawn to dusk roamed he to and fro, Lost, O lost, all under thier spell. \n31 EXTERIOR FOREST (UNICORN HUNT) DAY \nThe stallion stagger, his gait increasingly unstable as the poisen takes effect. \nThe mare nuzzle his flank where the envenomed hornet struck. It is a virulent ound, red and swollen. \nThe war-like SHOUTING of the goblins grows even closer. \nThe unicorns pause at a fork in the trail. The stallion motions with his head. Sadly, the mare compreheads and flees down the divergent path to safetly. \nThe stallion stands his ground. When the three goblin hunters gallop towards him, he turns and limps into the woods. \n32 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY \nJack lies beside Lili, listening raptly to her poem. \nLILI(reciting): Came he at last to where bluebells grow, He heard them ring, 'tis true to tell. He lay him down and did not know The flower's sound was his own death knell. \nAnd while he slept came teh lady fair, And gathered him up behind her saddle. Now, all young hunters of bluebells beware Sweet William rode straight through the gate of Hell. \nJack is lost in Lili's smile. \nJACK: When I get to heaven, I know just how the angels will sound. \nLILI(enjoying it): Do you flatter all the girls like that, Jack? \nJACK(embaressed) It's the truth. \nLili kisses Jack sweetly. He doesn't respond. \nLILI(smiling): Are you afraid of my kiss? \nJACK: I'm afraid you'll break my heart. \nLILI: Then still your heart... You are dear to me as life itself. \nJACK: Only because I amuse you...Like some trained bear! \nLILI: That's not true! I do love you, Jack. You must believe me! \nJACK: And if I so....no good can come from it. I am only a Green Man, without land or title...no name or wealth to bring you. \nThe Princess her golden ring on and off her finger. \nLILI: What does it matter. I don't care about any of that. \nJACK: But it does matter....! If not now....Someday. What about when the time comes for you to marry? \nLILI: I want to marry you. \nJACK: That's impossible! \nLILI: Not if it's what you really want, Jack. \nLili shows Jack her ring. \nLILI(cont): Don't you wish this was our wedding ring? \nJACK: What if I say yes...? Will my wish come true? \nLILI: It is my right as a princess to set a challenge for my suitors. \nSOUNDS of SNORTING and SHOUTING come from outside Lili scratches the frost off the window pane in the sleeping alcove. \n42 LILI'S POV : THROUGH WINDOW \nThe noisy goblins ride up on a makeshift sleigh of lashed animal bones. They stop outside and clamber out. Blix has the alicorn tucked under his arm. \n43 INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY \nTerrified, Lili runs wildly across the cottage and clims the ladder to the loft. \n43A INTERIOR COTTAGE LOFT DAY \nBarrels and chests are stored here. Cured bacon and hams hang from the rafters. Lili hides in a corner with several twig brooms and a butter churn. She wraps herself in an old quilt snatched from an open trunk. \nSnows blows in through a hole in the roof, covering the floor timbers. Three-inch gaps between the planks permit a view into the cottage interior. \n43B LILI'S POV : BETWEEN PLANKS \nThe front door slams open and the goblins stumble laughing inside. \nBLIX: Mortal world turned to ice, Here be goblins' paradise! \n43C INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY \nBlunder sinks his handaxe onto the kitchen table as he saunters past the frozen tarts. \nBLUNDER: Lots to eat! \nPox runs forward to the cradle and seizes the frozen baby, baring his tusks for the feast. \nPOX: I s-s-simply adore m-m-milk-fed meat! \nBLUNDER: What're you....? Some kinda animal? \nHorrified, Lili GASPS (OS) in the loft. \nThe goblins cock their ears to listen. Pox SNARLS and drops the baby back in the cradle. \nCurious, Blunder starts up the ladder to the loft, but changes his mind half-way, more interested in what Blix is doing. \nBLIX: Why eat cold? It's better hot! \nBlix points the alicorn at the frozen stewpot on the hearth. It begins to steam and bubble, magically boiling without a fire underneath. \nPOX: Am-m-mazing! How did you d-d-d-do that, old, ch-ch-chap? \nBlix is equally surprised by the alicorn's power. He CACKLES and aims it at the clock on the mantle. \nThe clock's hand spin wildly around backwards, the carved figures darting in and out at fives times their normal speed. \nBlix launches on an orgy of destruction, waving the alicorn like a magic wand. Plates shatter, the cradle rocks. furniture topples, Toby mugs come WAILING alive, painted wooden toys dance and caper. \nThe goblins SHRIEK with impish joy. \n43D INTERIOR LOFT (FROZEN) DAY \nLili watches the havoc through the gaps in the floor. \nBlix points the alicorn straight up. Snow flies wildly around the crouching Princess. \nThe broom and the butter churn begin a mad dance across the crowded loft. \nIt is all the Princess can do to keep from screaming. \n43E INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY \nAs a grand finale, Blix points at Nell's frozen figure, blowing her skirts above her waist. \nPOX(languidly): M-m-most amusing Blix....most terribly amusing. \nBLUNDER: This is sure our lucky day. Killed that ugly one-horn dead as a cowplop on a birthday cake! \nBLIX: Prattle, prattle like a priest! (pointing to himself) It was me who shoot the beast! \nPOX: Without the p-p-princess for bait, you'd never gotten close.... B-b-beauty brought the b-b-beast to bay. \nBLUNDER: She's so sweet....I could eat her brains like jam! \n43F INTERIOR LOFT (FROZEN) DAY \nLili slumps against the wall, aghast at what she's just overheard. \n43G INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY \nBlunder and Pox fill a sack with frozen tarts. \nPOX: I'd like such her b-b-bones! \nBlix points the alicorn at the cottage door. It flies open with a CRASH. \nBLIX: Better hurry! Can't be late! \nBlix marches out of the door. The other two goblins follow, darrging their sacks of tarts. \nBLUNDER: When we deliver that horn, Pox ol' buddy, Darkness gonna give us a humongous big reward. \nBlunder and Pox leave, slamming the door behind them. \nAfter a long pause, Lili creeps sobbing down the ladder from the loft. \nLILI: Oh, God.... God.... \nThe Princess stumbles across the cottage towards Nell. \nJack runs to the man, thinking himself saved.. \nJack discovers the man is frozen, like the bird. His initial shock gives way to releif. The man is his salvation after all. \nQuickly, he unties the stranger's travel bags and cloak. \nJACK(cont): God rest your soul.... I know you won't mind if I borrow your things. \nJack wraps himself in the claok and finds a tinder box in the travel bag. \nHe scrapes together a pile of twigs, striking sparks with the flint and steel to start them smouldering. \n45 DELETED : TRANSPOSED TO 46D \n46 EXTERIOR FAERIE CIRCLE NIGHT \nA campfire blazes. Jack sleeps beside a tiny fire, shivering under his new cloak. \nA tiny glowing LIGHT streaks out of the woods. It circles around Jack. The LIGHT touches the fire and it BLAZES up like a bonfire, waking Jack. \nJACK: What....? \n46A JACK'S POV : LIGHT \nJack stares at the radiant buble hanging above him. He sees a tiny woman-child with delicate dragonfly wings trapped inside. This is LUNA. \nJACK (cont)(OS): Who're you? \n46B EXTERIOR FAERIE CIRCLE NIGHT \nLuna ZOOMS off into the treetops. \nJack grabs a flaming brand and jumps to his feet. \nJACK (cont): Who's there....? \nWatching him through the drifting smoke in GUMP, an elf no more than the waist high. Slightly built, he is near-naked in spite of the cold. His face is that of a child, yet his eyes shine with a wisdom centuries old. \nGUMP(smiling mysteriously): Here you be a forest child and not know the Gump.... \nJACK: Gump, is it? \nGUMP: Aye, Jack.... Honeythorn Gump at your service..... \nThe air is filled with frenzied CLICKS and SNAPS: stones tapping, stick's rubbing, logs being thumped, etc. \nNumbers of green-glowing eyes stare at Jack out of the shadows. \nJACK (frightened): How d'you know my name? \nGUMP: How does a migrating swallow know the way south in winter....? Or a spawning salmon find the tiny freshet of his birth from the black cold depths of the mysterious sea....? I know everything, Jack! \nJACK: Everything....? Why has this happened? Why is it winter now? \nGUMP: I'd be a powerful wizard indeed could I answer.... (shrewdly): Suppose you tell me , Jack. \nJack in uncomfortable. \nJACK: Me? How can I do that? \nGUMP: You know these woods as well as any elf.... Did you not see something odd today? Any strange spirits? Did nothing untoward happen? \nJACK: No....well.... I took Lili to see the unicorns..... \nGUMP (furious): You did what? \nNumbers of elves and faeries appear out of the dark woods. They come in all sizes, from sprites no larger than squirrels to plump hobmen as big as small children. \nBROWN TOM is a plump, tipsy leprechaun, draped with pots and pans like a tinker; SCREWBALL, a tiny pixie wearing an ill-fitting cap and garments tassle with flowers. \nFAERIES (whispering in chorus): What....? Codfish and cockles....! Never....! Pewterpots and.... pumpkins....! Poo-poo pudding....! Doo-doo dumplings....! Shit-willy whatnot....! \nGUMP: Silence! \nThe whipering stops. All eyes are on Jack. He writhes with guilt under thier scrunity. \nJACK(deepling ashamed): Oh God, she touched him.... \nA GROAN rises from the crowd of faeries. They are outraged. Gump is the maddest of all. His face darkens. His eyes glow. He trembles with banshee fury. \nGUMP: Touched it! A mortal laid hands on a unicorn? \nBROWN TOM: Bad....terrible bad! \nJACK: We meant no wrong. \nGUMP (screaming): What was it you did mean, Jack! \nJACK: Nothing.... \nGUMP (cold and hard): Nothing, he calls it! \nJACK: I wanted to share something special with her. \nGUMP: Well.... I have something now to share with you....a lively reel to warm your bones! \nGump magically pulls a violen out of thin air. \nJACK: I'm in no mood for dancing. \nGUMP(screaming with wrath): Squawk! Squawk! No more talk.... Do you think you can upset the order of the universe and not pay the price? \nBrown Tom produces ancient bag pipes, Screwball a tambourine. The other wee folk tune up an incredible variety of oddly-shaped instryemnts : seashell trumpets, acorn cellos, gossets, serpentines, blossom-bell horns, bone flutes, all manner of drums and rattles. \nJACK: Is there nothing you can do? \nGUMP: If you want more tricks, I'm your man.... but, for big questions, you must go elsewhere. \nJACK: But don't you care what's happened? \nGUMP: Course we care.... What good's the world locked in a season of death? No folks to scare on a summer's night.... \nBROWN TOM: No babies to tickle.... \nSCREWBALL: No lovers to tease.... \nGUMP: No more spells to cast....Does that sound like an enjoyable prospect? \nJACK: We must find the answer! \nGUMP: That we must. But first, we better see that no harm's come to the unicorns. \nSCREWBALL: I sadly fear the worst.... \nGumps claps his hands and everyone is magically holding luminous flower lanterns. \n46C EXTERIOR DEEP FOREST NIGHT \nSeen from a distance, the lantern-lit faerie procession glows like foxfire between the massive trees. \n46D EXTERIOR SNOW (LILI TRACKS GOBLINS) NIGHT \nPrincess Lili tuns swiftly between the frozen trees, following the tracks of the goblins. The quilt is torn, her hair dishevelled. She pauses at the top of a small, steep hill. \nThe tracks of the goblins' sleigh pass below. \nLili jumps from the hilltop, leaving the quilt floating behind like a discarded skin. It is an incrediable leap. \nShe lands with the sureness of a wild woodland creature and runs off, hair streaming behind, following the trail of the sled. \n47 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA NIGHT \nThe faerie procession moves out of the woods onto the frozen meadow. \nFAERIES(singing together): What can you do when there's Nothing to be done? Sing a little song And have fun, fun, fun.... \nThe silhouette of the unicorn is glimpsed in the glow of the faerie lanterns. \nLed by Jack, the faeries run towards the recumbent stallion. \nWisp stoops and picks up an arrow dropped by the goblins. \nGUMP: This is goblins' work.... Powerful demons are agaisnt us! \nJack kneels sadly beside the ice-glazed unicorn. \nThe SOUND of CRASHING HOOFBEATS alerts the faeries as the mare unicorn thunders out of the trees. \nBROWN TOM: Take cover, laddies! \nThe faeries dive for protection. Only Jack stands his ground. \nThe mare charges straight at Jack. He is knocked to his knees as she gallops past. \nThe unicorn wheels about. Jack scrambles to his feet. \nShe charges again, skidding to a stop on the frozen grass. Her alicorn is aimed straight at Jack's throat. \nGUMP: Run, Jack! \nJACK: The fault was mine. I owe her my life. \nGUMP: Nobly spoken, lad, and nobility is her gift in return. \nThe mare makes a soft NOISE deep in her throat. It is a cross between whale song and the cooing of doves. \nJack responds in kind, imitating the sound exactly. \nSCREWBALL: What's he saying? What's it mean? \nBROWN TOM (shrugging): Search me.... I speak some rabbit, but not a word of unicorn. \nThe unicorn continues, a SOUND as close to music as anything in nature. Jck listens intently and answers her. \nGUMP: Come on Jack, don't keep us in the dark. \nJACK: The dark is where we'll stay.... We're cursed. All warmth and light was lost when the stallion died. \nBROWN TOM: Is there naught we can do? \nJACK: We must get the alicorn back. Only then will the world return to normal. \nGUMP: And how do faeries fight a demon? \nJACK: She says we're to find a champion.... a mortal, bold of heart and pure in spirit. \nSCREWBALL: Look....! Look....! \nScrewball points to the mare's hoofprints in the snow. Tiny wild flowers spring to life within each indentation. \nJACK: That is the warmth of her soul. Not even death's icy hand can stop it! \nSCREWBALL: Little good her soul'll do us now. \nBROWN TOM: Screwball's right. Where we gonna find a champion when every mortal can swing a sword is froze stiff as an icicle? \nGUMP: Don't give up so quick, lads. (feeling Jack's arm) You sure you're mortal? \nSuddenly, with the pure clarity of a BELL CHIME, the presence of DAYLIGHT is detected. \nThe reflected glow of the coming dawn tinges the ground and casts it luminence over Darkness and the goblins. \nDARKNESS (cont) (writhing): What is this light...? \nBeams of rising sunlight advance down the tree trunks. \nDarkness recoils, wrapping his flaming cloak about him. \nDARKNESS (cont): You killed the final unicorn.... Is this not true? \nBlix and Pox exchange guilty looks. \nBLIX: This is true.... \nPOX: Undeniably t-t-true, Lord. \nDarkness is on to them. He points with the alicorn. \nDARKNESS: You lie! Here is dawn! \nPOX: Well.... almost t-t-true.... ess-s-sentially true.... \nBLIX: That stallion is dead, dead as dreams, dead as legend.... \nDARKNESS: OUT WITH IT! \nSunlight is half-way to the ground. Darkness shrinks, shrivelling like a dying ember. \nPOX: But.... but.... the m-m-mare still lives... \nDARKNESS: If even one unicorn walks the earth, my power is not complete.... \nBLIX: Just a female.... She has no power... The ground grows very light. Darkness melts into the campfire. \nDARKNESS: Only the power of creation....? Get that female....! I command you.... In the name of Darkness.... \nSunlight strikes the ground. Darkness is gone! His arm holding the alicorn aloft the fire is the last to disappear. \nLili backs silently into the shadows surrrounding the Great Tree. \n49 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY \nLili runs straight into a driving blizzard. A distant SOUND alerts her and she pauses to listen. \nIt is Jack and the faeries, SINGING. Jack's voice carries above the others. \nJACK & THE FAERIES (os): When times are hard and things look bad, Don't feel blue and don't feel sad.... \nA look of astonished joy comes over Lili's face. As the SOUND of singing FADES, she runs towards it, calling eagerly. \nLILI: Jack....! Ja-aack! \n50 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY \nJack and the faeries troop march through the blizzard, all SINGING merrily. \nJACK & THE FAERIES (singing): If your down, wearin' a frown, That's the time to dance like a clown! \nJack hears something in the distance and stops to listen. \nLILI (very faint) (os): Ja-aack.... Ja-aack.... \nJACK (bewildered): Lili....? \nThe SOUND of her distant call is erased by the howling storm. Jack sadly decides it was a trick of the wind and hurries to catch up with the others. \n51 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY \nLili stops running. There is nothing but the wailing wind. \nLILI (softly): Jack....? Oh, Jack.... \nA solitary tear starts from her eyes, only to freeze on her cheek like a diamond beauty spot. \nLILI (cont): Please God.... help me! \nLili drops sobbing to her knees. Through her grief, she sees the unicorn's track in the snow, each hoofprint gay with tiny blooming flowers. \nHer courage restored, Lili follows this meandering trail of burgeoning life through the forest. \n52 EXTERIOR ENTRANCE TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY \nGumps leads the way a huge BOULDER lodged uner the roots of a giant tree. \nGUMP (proudly): Here's my home, Jack.... What d'you think of that for a front door? \nJack thinks Gump is pulling his leg. \nJACK (in jest): Be some job in getting it open. \nGUMP: Think you so? \nGump WHISTLES. Immediately, two eyes blink open on the front of the boulder, and he is seen to have facial features. \nBOULDER: Morning', Gump.... \nThe Boulder stands on a pair of tiny legs and waddles forth from under the tree roots, REVEALING the entrance to a cavern. \nHe promptly trips and rolls over and over in the snows, his tiny stone feet kicking wildly in the air. \nGUMP (bowing): After you, Jack.... \nGUMP: Go on.... see if it fits. \nJack slips the coat over his head. It fits perfectly. \nGUMP (nodding approval): It will turn a broadhead arrow ar fifty yards. \nSCREWBALL: He might pass for a champion in that. \nGUMP: Have a look at yourself, Jack. (pointing: Use yonder shield for a mirror. \nJACK(confused): ....Shield? \nGUMP(exasperated): The round shiny thing over there. \nSCREWBALL: Clothes never made the man.... \nGump silences Screwball with a stern look and and stalks over to a small carved desk. \nThere is a loud, MUSICAL CHIME. Gump pulls a remarkable instrument from a pouch on his belt: a wonderous crystal globe filled with whirling miniature worlds. \nGUMP(studying globe): Hmmm... getting late. Almost half- way past the morning mayfly hatch... SCREWBALL(sullen): Too cold for mayflies now.... 'Sides, I ain't got no timepeice. \nGUMP: You first must know how to tell the time. \nSCREWBALL: I ain't got nothing.... \nGUMP: No more chatter....! I've got work to do. \nGump sits at the desk setting his timepeice beside him and rummaging among his papers. \nJack kneels before a brightly polished shield and studies his reflection. \nLuna round and round his head. \nSCREWBALL: Think I'll brew some tea. \nScrewball snatches variosu herbs off the ceiling. \nSCREWBALL(cont): Colt's foot and sassafrass... Maybe a spot of spearmint.... St John's Wort not bad.... and a little foxglove. \nScrewball feverishly stuffs a silver teapot full of dried herbs. \n56 DELETED \n57 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY \nThe unicorn's flowering footprints lead Lili to Gump's cave. \nShe pauses to consider the situation. Snowflakes glisten in her tangled hair. She is fiercly beautiful. \nDeciding nothing is amiss, Lili stalks silently inside. \n58 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY \nA small cooking fire flickers under blackened pots and an iron skillet. The mare unicorn is bedded down on a blanket of straw. Brown Tom lies fast asleep against her flank. \nThe unicorn lifts her head when Lili tiptoes in. \nBrown Tom is jerked awake as the mare climbs to her feet, snorting with rage. \nBROWN TOM: What....? What....? Who's there? \nLILI: I'm Princess Lili.... I..... \nBROWN TOM: You! You're the cause of all our sorrow! \nThe Princess drops to her knees. \nLILI: I know it was wrong.... Everything is my fault. (weeping) Please.... please forgive me. \nBROWN TOM: I ain't the one ye should be asking. \nLILI: I want to make it up to her.... I followed the goblins! They gave the alicorn to the Lord of Darkness! \nBROWN TOM: Good lass! You're a plucky little partridge at that. \nLILI: We can't stay here! It's not safe! Darkness sent the goblins to hunt the mare... If I found her, so will they....We msut go! \n59 DELETED \n60 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY \nBrown Tom looks past Lili to the mouth of the cave. \nBROWN TOM: Too late! \nPox and Blix stand in the entrance, aiming their wicked, barbed arrows straight at the hearts of Lili and Brown Tom. \nBrown Tom swings an iron skillet back over his head in a warrior's stance. \nBROWN TOM: If you imps're looking for a fight, ye've come to the chap who'll oblige ye. \nBLIX/POX: Kill....! K-k-kill...! Kill...! \nBlix and Pox loose their arrows, renocking the bows with incredible speed. \nBrown Tom moves like lightning, using the skillet as a shirld to deflect the arrows raining about him. \nLili stands in front of the mare, striving to protect the unicorn's body with her own. \nBrown Tom lepas acrobatically about with the skillet. A fusillade of arrows CLANGS OFF its iron surface. \nA lucky shot peirces Brown Tom's hat. Dark red liquid streams down his face. His eyes roll up in mortal terror. \nJACK(overjoyed): She's alive! \nBROWN TOM: She was living still when they killed me. \nGUMP: You'll earn your champion's spurs this day, Jack.... We'll follow their tracks in the snow. Foul weather's on our side for a change. \n62A EXTERIOR FOREST DAY \nJack and the faeries march through the woods holding lanterns, into the teeth of a driving blizzard. \n63 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nBlix and Pox kneel nervously before the Throne of Darkness. A huge fire blazes in the hearth. \nPOX: Hail m-most great, and d-d-darkest of the dark! \nBLIX: Though we be nothing in your sight, We bow before your strength and might! \nWe hear Darkness speak, but see only his bat-winged shadow spread like an inky cloak across the two kneeling goblins. \nDARKNESS (os): Can you fawning sycophants do more than grovel? What of the task I set you? \nPOX: D-d-done, Lord. We have the m-m-m-m-m-m.... the unicorn. \nDARKNESS(os): Where is she? \nBLIX: In the dungeon like a treasure, Awaiting your darkest pleasure. \nDARKNESS (os): Very good.... You two are not entirely devoid of talent. \nPOX: There's m-m-more, Sire.... \nBLIX: Though unworthy of your magnificence, Trifles without consequence, We present with all due deference.... A gift. \nDARKNESS (os): Gift....? What sort of gift? \nBLIX: This thing you once called innocence. \nDARKNESS (os): Innocence...? I must behold this wonder.... \nDarkness stares into the fire. \nAs Darkness grimps the arm of his throne, his fingers start to melt, dripping to the dank stone floor. \n64 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY \nDarkness bleeds through the groin vault ceiling, speading like a stain across the curving stones. \nBelow, the unicorn is locked in a steel halter, a woven steel cable binding her to an iron windlass. \nThe Princess paces the dark and dripping cell. Her dress is in tatters, her hair tangled. There is something wild and free about her now, and yet she has never appeared more alluring. \nThe melting shadow of Darkness drips from the ceiling, forming a small demonic shape as it falls. \nWe hear the BEATING of Darkness' heart in time with each evil drip. The sound grows LOUDER and LOUDER until the echo reverberates within the vaulted chamber. \nLili is terrified. She looks frantically around as the pulsing rhytm continues. The Princess sees nothing and hugs the unicorn's neck for comfort. \n64A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nDarkness contemplates the raging flames, his heartbeat THUNDERING. \n65 EXTERIOR HILL ABOVE GREAT TREE BOG DAY \nJack and the faeries stare out at the tree-crowned ruin and surrounding bog. \n65A EXTERIOR BOG DAY \nJack and the faeries wade forward through the drifting curtains of mist. \nJACK: Legend says the Dark Castle stood in olden days when evil anarchy ruled the land.... The wicked still come here to sacrafice. \nGUMP: They worship the demon.... \nSCREWBALL: It's ugly! I hate it! \nGUMP: Good! You shall go first.... \n65B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nCLOSE ON: Darkness. For the briefest instant, we see the smouldering eyes of the demon GLOWING in anitcipation out of the shadows. \n65C EXTERIOR BOG DAY \nAlthough Jack is in no trouble, the water is rapidly growing too deep for the faeries. Gump urges Screwball forward: \nGUMP: Go on! Hurry up! \nSCREWBALL: All the time me. Same old story. \nScrewball clibs up onto a floating lily pad. \nAn undulating v-shaped wake moves through the water alongside as they step from lily pad to lily padf and clamber onto a long, twisting root. \nWithout warning, an emaciated green arm shoors out of the water and grabs Screwball. He is gone under the surface with a scream. \nBROWN TOM: Screwball! \nJACK: What was that? \nGUMP: Big trouble! \nJack grips the hilt of his sword and rushes to the spot where Screwball disappeared. \nVOICE: You hold the world in your grasp.... Supreme power belongs to you... yet your triumph is meaningless! \nDARKNESS: Meaningless? \nVOICE: What do you gain from it? What pleasure comes from ruling a pack of imps and goblins....? Souls already black.... This innocent creature fascinates you because only she can appreciate the enormity of your achievement. \nDARKNESS: I'll take her then! \nVOICE: A hollow victory! She remembers the world as it was, when she loves your new order you will triumph! Woo her.... win her.... break her spirit.... \nDARKNESS: Thank you, Father.... Your wisdom is ever my guide. \nVOICE: Remember.... She must desire you.... nothing else matters! \n65E EXTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY \nJack and the faeries step ashore on the island. Gump makes a mystical sign with his hands. \nJACK: What's that? \nGUMP: For our protection, Jack. You must be ready.... Remember, Darkness is a liar.... a treacherous fiend! Don't listen to him. Never believe what you see..... \nJACK: He won't fool me. \nGUMP: Don't be so sure! No human has ever set foot in this place before! 66 INTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY \nJack and the faeries stare up at the massive horn embedded in the inner tree. \nScrewball starts to climb towards it. \nSCREWBALL: What a nice big trumpet....! Bet it sounds louder than anything.... \nGump hauls him back down by the seat of his pants. \nGUMP: Don't touch it! Our lives are lost if it blows! \nJack finds an opening hidden between the roots of the inner tree. \nJACK: In here! I've found a passage! \nJack drops inside. \n66A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nThe moment Jack enters the inner tree, a deep TREMOR reverberates through the subterranean Castle of Darkness. \nDraped in shadows before the fire, the Dark Lord looks up at this disturbance. \nDARKNESS (to the fire): I feel a presence....! Some power invades my sanctity.... \nVOICE (from the flames): Every wolf suffers fleas.... 'tis easy enough to scratch! \nThe flames surge out towards Darkness, embracing him. \n67 INTERIOR TINY ANTECHAMBER DAY \nLike the catacombs of Paris, the walls are decorated with bones and human skulls. At each corner of the open ceiling is a carved demonic head. Jack and the faeries stand looking up. \nGUMP(gloomily): The decor of death.... \nBROWN TOM: Tells you somthing 'bout him what lives here. \nSCREWBALL: It's a dead end.... \nJack searches along the ossuary walls. \nJACK: Doesn't make sense.... Check the walls. There must be some sort of secret key.... \nScrewball doesn't join the other faeries in the search. He is attracted by several round stone balls lying in the rubble. Picking up three with a happy grin, he begins to juggle. \nSCREWBALL: One-two-three.... fidde-dee-dee.... \nGump sees what Screwball is doing and flies into a rage. \nGUMP: Screwball! Drop those this minute! \nScrewball tosses the balls carelessly over his shoulder. One lands in the stone cornice near the ceiling and rolls along, gathering momentum as it passes through the open mouths of each gargoyle. \nThe balls disappears into the mouth of the final gargoyle. It is swallowed with an emphatic GULP. \nAll at once, the roof slides shut above. \nBROWN TOM(alarmed): Newt-finger marmalade! \nThe floor pulls suddenly open and they all plummet SCREAMING into empty space. Luna circles, a dot of light above tthe bottomless pit. \nLUNA (wee voice): Oh, dear.... Oh, dear... \nThe tiny faerie whirls in a blur of indecision before streaking down into the dark opening after her falling friends. \n68 INTERIOR CAVE CHUTE DAY \nLike prisoners on a fairground helter-skelter, Jack and the faeries spin down a seemingly endless curvinbg chute. \nGUMP(singing): When times're hard and thing look bad, Don't feel blue and don't feel sad.... \nJACK: How can you sing at a time like this? \nGUMP: Can you think of anything better to do? \nThey hurtle through festooned cobwebs, stirring up smokey clouds of ancient dust. \n69 INTERIOR CAGE AND ALCOVE DAY \nBROWN TOM: What? \nSCREWBALL: Why me? \nBrown Tom gives Screwball a swift kick in his rear. \nBROWN TOM: Why not? \nThe two little elves scamaper off together. \nSCREWBALL: I hate it....I hate it.... I hate it.... \n72 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY \nThe iron-studded dungeon days swing magically open as Lili watches, her eyes aglow with animal fire. She crouches beside the unicorn, resting on her haunches in an easy feline fashion. \nLili rises like a sleepwalker, unable to resist the compulsion luring her toward the open doorway. \nThe chained unicorn WHINNIES pitifully. Princess Lili looks back without expression as she leaves. \n73 DELETED \n74 DELETED \n75 INTERIOR ANOTHER CORRIDOR DAY Luna's bobbing LIGHT leads the way as Jack and Gump hurry along the rubble-choked corridor. Alerted by the SOUND of something, they dart into the shadows. \nGUMP: Quick, Jack! \nJack and Gump watch in horror as a cracked EGG the size of a watermelon runs down the corridor on armor-scaled chicken legs, led on either side by a Demon holding a chain leash. \nJack draws his sword. The Demons stop and the Egg begins to crack. \nJACK: I'll scramble that one! \nGump restrains him. The Egg cracks apart. \nGUMP: Don't trust your eyes! All is enchanted here. \nThe Egg breaks into pieces and a dripping winged monster emerges; a diabolic cross between a bat and a pterodactyl. It emits a fearsome SHRIEK and flies off down the corridor followed by the twin attendant Demons. \nJack and Gump hurry on in the opposite direction. \n75A INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY \nScrewball and Brown Tom creep timorously forward. They are alerted by the SOUNDS of something approaching. A hideously deformed shadow fall across the opposite wall. \nThe two faeries clutch each other in terror and duck into the shadows. \nIt is Princess Lili! She passes the evles' hiding place as if in a trance. \n76 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY \nJack and Gump emerge on a narrow span arching across the vast central of the undreground castle. Similiar viaducts, above and below, bridge the awesome chasm. \nThe Green Man and the faerie gawk at the sheer magnitude of it all. \nJACK: Not even kings live like this.... \nOn a high span above, Jack sees Princess Lili drifting by like a somnabulist. \nJACK (cont): My God! Gump, look! It's Lili! \nGUMP: Don't believe it, Jack. \nJACK (yelling): Lili ! \nThe SOUND ECHOES through the vast space. \n77 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY \nThe Princess pauses. A section of parapet has broken off and she wanders to the edge, staring down into the void. For a precarious moment, she teeters on the brink, seemingly about to fall. \nJACK (os) (calling): Li-li ! The Princess does not respond, wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow edge of disaster. She leans against the ruined parapet and a bug chunk of masonry breaks away, tumbling and bouncing into the abyss. \nJACK (cont) (os) (calling): It's Ja-ack ! \nLili's face is blank. She turns and continues blindly on her way. \n78 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY \nJack stares up at Lili's retreating form. \nJACK: It's her. I know it. \nGUMP: Don't be so hasty! Remember who we're dealing with. \nJACK: I've got to reach her! \nJack races off. Gump runs along behind. \n78A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nThe shadowy figure of Darkness looms over a band of deformed PYGMIES with needle-sharp teeth and wickedly curved talons long as pitchfork tines. \nDARKNESS: My enemies approach.... destory them! Darkness points an evil finger and the Pygmies scurry CACKLING off. \n79 DELETED \n80 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY \nJack and Gump hurry out onto the arching span. The Princess is nowhere in sight. \nGUMP (running after): Slow down....! Use some caution! \nDarkness stands over the fallen girl, his heartbeat pulsing like muffled thunder. Something almost like a smile creases his hideous features as he rolls a lock of Lili's hair between his clawed fingers. \nThe Princess blinks and opens her eyes. She is horrified to find Darkness kneeling over her and frantically tries to get away. \nDARKNESS: Do not be afraid, lady.... \nLili GASPS like a stranded fish. She is catatonic with fear. \nDARKNESS (cont): I mean you no harm. \nDarkness offers the Princess his hand. \nDARKNESS (cont): How like you my gifts...? Does the gown not please you? Come.... tell me.... \nLili's terror renders her speechless. \nDARKNESS (cont): The colour is most suitable... We sanctify the death of the old world and the birth of a new order.... You are the guest of honour. \nLili WEEPS and tugs at the black dress. \nLILI: ....of dishonour...! Take this away.... Please! I beg you! \nDarkness advances on Lili. The slow kettldrum THROB of his heart underscores his words. \nDARKNESS: Your soul in like some dark nectar.... I cannot rest unril I taste its sweetness. \nLILI (frantic): Never! I hate you! I hate this dress! \nDARKNESS: Can you speak so of your bridal gown....? \nLILI (screaming): Nooooooooo! \n86 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY \nJack and Gump listen by the closed doors to Lili's peircing scream (OS). Jack is desparate and half-draws his sword from the scabbard. \nJACK: What has he done to her? \nGump restrains the boy. \nGUMP: You have no power to stop it.... Be thankful she lives. \nJack shoves his sword back in disgust. \nJACK (bitterly): Some champion.... What good is this fancy sword? \nGUMP: It's not the sword that counts, but the man who swings it.... \n87 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nLili slumps to the cold stone floor, WEEPING. Darkness bends solicitously over her. \nDARKNESS: Why the tears? \nLILI (sobbing): ....everything is lost.... poor Jack.... \nDARKNESS: Why weep for him? He left you alone to die! \nLILI: No! He'd never do that! He was killed....like everything else.... \nDARKNESS (glancing over his shoulder): Yes.... But why mourn? You have a new and grander destiny! \nLILI: Consort of some cowardly vile toad who slinks through the night! \nDARKNESS: Not so! I requite to shadow's solace and dark of the night.... Sunshine is my destroyer! \nLILI (scornful): You think you're so powerful.... and hide in the ground like a mole! \nDARKNESS (smiling): This too will change. The last unicorn dies tonight....! As her blood ebbs, the sun sets forever. There shall never be another dawn! \nLILI (horrified): No....! You can't.... You mustn't.... \nDarkness throws back his evil head and LAUGHS. \n88 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY The demonic LAUGHTER of Darkness carries through the massive doors. \nJACK: He means to kill the mare, Gump! \nGUMP: Don't mourn the corpse 'til the coffin's in the ground. \nDARKNESS (OS): My dominion shall encompass the enternal night! \nGUMP: As long as the sun still shines, so does hope! \nJACK (bitterly: Sun doesn't shine down here. \nJack fingers Lili's silver medallion hanging around his neck and from out of the blue, inspiration strikes. \nJACK (cont) (grinning): Wait a minute....! I think I know a way. \n89 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nLili stares at Darkness with terror and loathing. \nDARKNESS: The world shall be at last as nature intended....a place of chaos and anarchy! \nLILI: You're mad! \nDARKNESS: Aye, Lady, and proud to be so! For in madness lies the soul of all that's noble.... Can you fathom the loneliness of untold eons lived in darkness? My spirit was forged in that black fire.... \nLILI: You live alone because you are loathsome! The contagion of your wicked heart demands isolation. \nDARKNESS: Nay, mistress. I've found my mate and you know it. We're just alike, you and I. Beneath the skin we are already one. \nGUMP (amazed): How did you do that? \nJACK (to Gump): I didn't do anything.... (into keyhole) let me see your face. It will give me hope.... \nJack strains to see through the keyhole. \n95 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nLili stares at the keyhole in horror. \nJACK (os): ....just to glimpse your smile.... \nLILI (grief-stricken): No.... I can't.... forget me, Jack.... \nThe Princess reaches out her animal's paw and covers the keyhole. \n96 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY \nAs the LIGHT in the opening grows DARK, Jack tenderly places his hand next to Lili's. \nJACK: Lili....? I love you.... \nGump pulls frantically on Jack's arm. \nGUMP: Come, Jack. We've no time to spare.... Remember your plan? \nSadly, Jack takes his hand from the keyhole and follows Gump back along the corridor. \n97 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nPrincess Lili lies SOBBING. High above, the winged figures watch her. The music THROBS, underscoring a low, rhythmic CHANTING. Like some ghastly chorus fro, Hell, the living statuary sings in unison to Lili: \nSTATUARY (singing): Bride of Night.... Bride of Night.... Darkness is your heart's delight! Hail to Darkness! Hail the Night! His the Power and the Might! Master of Chaos, Lord of Doom, Sing his praises from the tomb! \nLili lifts her head, listening to the sepulchral SINGING. Her eyes burn like a tiger's. She bares her fangs, and from her throat issues a bone-chilling HOWL. \n98 INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY \nScrewball and Brown Tom stop short in their tracks when they hear the SOUND of a distant HOWL echoes in the shadows. \nSCREWBALL (trembling): I vote we run like hell! \nThe two faeries scamper off into darkness. 99 INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY \nGump, Jack and a woman-sized Luna wait outside the kitchen door as Brown Tom and Screwball come running up. Gump studies his ornate timepiece. \nGUMP: Where were you? In another three flicks of a badger's tail it'll be half-past. \nSCREWBALL: Sorry....time slips away when you're having so much fun. \nBROWN TOM (out of breath): We....found the mare ....chained....in the dungeon below. \nGump shoves his timepiece back in his belt. \nGUMP: Excellant.... Who has a bit of parchment? \nThe two faeries search in their clothing. Screwball produces a plethora of trash: marbles, string, old doll's eyes, coloured bird's eggs, ancient coins, etc. At last he finds a crumbled peice of sheepskin. \nSCREWBALL: Here.... I was saving it to write me will on. \nBROWN TOM: Where there's a will there's a.... \nGUMP: Shush, both of you....! Jack has a plan....a good one.... \nGump squats on the floor, and, using a triangle and some charcoal, divides the parchment into mysterious lines and angles. \nGUMP (mumbling): ....angle of refraction equals.... angle of incidence....multiplied by a factor of fourty.....divided by the square root of a google-plex.... \nGump SNAPS his fingers triumphantly. \nGUMP (cont): Perfect! It will work like a charm, Jack! \nJACK: Let's get started! What we need to do is sneak back into the kitchen and gather all the plates and platters.... \nSCREWBALL: Oh no! Not me! Seen enough of that kitchen, I have! \nBROWN TOM: Don't be so pig-headed! You can trust Gump. \nSCREWBALL: I'd sooner trust a rat in the ghetto! \nBROWN TOM: Well.... trust Jack then. \nJack eases open the kitchen door. \nJACK: Remember....just the shiny ones.... \nJack leads the way back into the kitcheb. Gump urges the other two to follow. \nGUMP: ....and be quiet! Soft as thistledown, that's the faerie way. \n100 INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY \nJack and the faeries tiptoe cautiosuly into the kitchen. \nBoth Demon Cooks are asleep, the encountered first is stretched out across his chopping block, SNORING like a dragon with indisgestion. \nThe unfortunate Blunder turns slowly over the coals, hog-tied to a spit. A bright red apple is stuffed in his mouth. Jack and Gump rush to his side. \nGump pulls the apple from Blunder's mouth. \nBLUNDER (frantic): Get me outta here! Please! While I'm still medium rare! \nGUMP: Quiet....! You're a free imp on one condition.... \nStaggering under the full weight of the faerie onslaught, the Second Cook lurches in circles. \nSECOND COOK: Kill....! Smash....! \nFurious, the Second Cook swings his heavy skillet at Screwball and Blunder. He misses them completely, hitting himself square on the head and knocking himself out. \nThe faeries leap off as the demon toppes backwards into the fireplace. \nGUMP: We must help Jack! \nThe faeries race to the foot of the ramp. Jack parries the Cook's fearsome swing. The Cook presses him relentlessly. The CLASH of steel rings through the cavernous kitchen. \nThe faeries start up the ramp like a tiny cheering section. \nBLUNDER: Stick him a good one! \nSCREWBALL: Cut him down to size, Jack! \nGiant wine barrels are stacked at tge top of the ramp. The Cook back Jack against them. There is no further room for retreat. \nCOOK: Gonna spill your guts, boy. \nThe Cook swings his cleaver from the hip. Jack nimbly springs out of harm's way. The cleaver drives full force into one of the chocks supporting the pyramid of wine barrels. \nGRUMBLING, the Cook yanks his cleaver free. This pulls the chock loose from under the bottom barrel. \nCOOK (cont) (Listening): Wuzzat....? \nThe entire stack of barrels shifts, rolling towards the Cook. \nCOOK (cont): Bad news! \nThe Cook runs for his life. The huge hogshead RUMBLE forward in a wooden avalanche. \nJack crouches at the top of the ramp. As the Cook runs past he sticks the sword-blade between his legs and trips him up. \nThe Cook tumbles, head over heels, down the ramp. \nHalf-way up, the faerie band sees the giant barrels ROLLING towards them. \nSCREWBALL (horrified): Sodom and Glockamora! \nThe faeries turn and run. \nThe barrels CRASH on top of the fallen Cook, knocking him senseless as they CONTINUE rolling. \nThe faeries dive for cover in the arched opening of the kitchen doorway at the bottom of the ramp. \nThe barrels CRUNCH into the kitchen wall. Because they are larger than the doorway, the faeries crouching inside are spared. \nOceans of wine flood out in a dark tidal wave, forcing the door and washing the little people into the corridor beyond. \n101 INTERIOR KITCHEB CORRIDOR DAY \nBrown Tom is beside himself with delight. He scoops up wine with Screwball's helmet and pours it on top of his head.. \nBROWN TOM: Whoopeeeeeee! \nJack appears in the shattered doorway, sword in hand. \nJACK: Hate to break up the party, but there's work to be done! \nGump jumps to his feet. \nGUMP: Hurry! Get those plates~ \nJack sheathes his sword and rushes into the kitchen. \nScrewball and Blunder follow, but Brown Tom lingers behind, scooping the helmet full of wine. \nBROWN TOM: Just a wee taste.... \nGump kicks Brown Tom smartly in the pants. \nGUMP: Move! Or I make your head ring worse than any hangover! \nGump chases Brown Tom back into the kitchen. \n101A INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY \nThe faeries gather up the fallen plates. Jack stares thoughtfully at the fireplace, where the body of the Second Cook has snuffed out the flames. \nGUMP: What's on your mind, Jack? \nJACK: Smoke rising.... That chimney must go clear to the top. \nGump peers into the hearth. \nGUMP: Not much to hold onto. Take a peapod pixie to make the climb. \nScrewball steps proudly forward. \nSCREWBALL: I'll do it! \nThe faeries are astonished. Screwball never volunteers. \nGUMP: What? Can I believe my ears? \nSCREWBALL: Don't see why not. Ain't I small enough for the job? \nBLUNDER (proudly): No job's too small for the Buttercup brothers.... \nSCREWBALL (on his knees: Please, Gump.... let me try. I know I'm always trouble, but I want to make it up to you.... Prove that I won't let you down. \nLILI: I have no interest in your foul ambition. \nDARKNESS: Desire then....surely we beasts all have desire. \n102C INTERIOR GREAT HALL (MATCHING FIREPLACE OPPOSITE) DAY \nUnseen, Screwball climbs up onto the banquet table. He can't believe his good fortune. A bounteous feast surrounds him. \nLILI (os): You'd never dream what I desire.... \nDARKNESS (os): Don't be so sure.... Dreams are my speciality \nScrewballs stuffs his tunic with black fruit. He rushes about, treading on the feast in his crazed delirium at beung surrounded by such plenty. \nDARKNESS (cont) (os): It is through dreams I influence mankind. I have dreams of my own.... dreams of enternity with you....no more silence....no more loneliness.... \n102D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nLili LAUGHS in the face of Darkness. \nLILI (scornfully): Such drivel! You sound like some simpering schoolboy! \nDARKNESS: I'll wager there was a time when the attention of a devoted schoolbvoy were entirely to your liking. \nLili regards her claws with a savage sneer. \nLILI (snarling): I know what I'd do with such meat now! \nDARKNESS: ....all things change, lady. The pleasures of youth become the regrets of maturity.... \nA loud CRASH on the banquet table causes Darkness to look around. He SEES Screwball standing by the centrepiece, about to shove a whole chicken in his mouth. \nDARKNESS (cont) (angry): What're you doing here? \nBlackened with soot, Screwball easily passes for a goblin. \nSCREWBALL (all innocence): .....am I early....? \nDARKNESS: You impudent imp! \nSCREWBALL: I thought the invitation said half-past.... \nDARKNESS (roaring): GET OUT! \nScrewball gets the message. He drops the chicken and hops down off the banquet table, running to the opposite fireplace for all he's worth. \nDARKNESS (cont) (gently to Lili): Sit.... I value your thoughts. Why not share them with me? \nLili looks at the grotesque throne. \nLILI: No more than that....just sit? \nDARKNESS (nodding): Sit.... \nLili steps up onto the oversized footstool. Inches behind her, the monstrous throne swells and throbs like an organic creature, the powerful sinews rippling with desire. \nLILI (a feline smile): Doesn't seem such an outrageous request.... \nThe Princess prepares to sit, her luscious, silk-swathed bottom only inches from the lavcivious surface of the squirming throne. \nDARKNESS: You'll never regret granting me this favour.... \nLili's eyes glitter as she teases him. \nLILI: What shall we talk about? \nDARKNESS (impatient): Just sit! \nThe febric of Lili's gown brushes the writihing throne. In another second she will be sitting. Unexpectedly, she stands up tall on the footstool. \nLILI: Such a disagreeable chair....must be terribly uncomfortable. I think I'll stand if you don't mind. \nDarkness barely controls his raging anger. \nDARKNESS: I prefer you to sit! \nLILI: I'd rather stand, thank you. \nDarkness's forehead swells with fury. \nDARKNESS: Sit! \nLILI: No.... Not now.... \nDarkness puffs like an adder in his frenzy, rising up to tower over Lili. \nDARKNESS (roaring): I command you to sit! \nLili is utterly unafraid. She LAUGHS at the swollen image of Darkness. \nLILI: Don't be silly. \nLili hops down from the footstool. \nDARKNESS (screaming with rage): SIT, DAMN YOU! \nLili sashays past him, twitching her gown in an unashamedly wanton fashion. Her hearty LAUGH is as loud as the outraged ROARS of Darkness. \nLILI (laughing): Never.... never.... \n103-110 DELETED \n110A INTERIOR DUNGEON CHASM DAY Jack scales a plate like a golden discus across the chasm to Brown Tom waiting on the viaduct above. \n111D EXTERIOR TOP OF CHIMNEY DAY \nThe chimney pot is shaped like a monstrous demon. Black as a sweep, Screwball emerges at the top and looks around. \nThe distant sun is a dying ember resting on the surrounding rim of dark mountains. We HEAR the SOUND of a clock CHIME! \n111E INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY \nA distant CHIME stops Gump in his tracks. He pulls out his timepiece from the pouch and studies it. \nGUMP: ....not much time.... \n111F INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nPrincess Lili stretches out her arms towards Darkness. \nLILI: Bring me to the wretched beast. \nDarkness takes her arm and leads her towards the blazing hearth. \nThe unicorn's distant whinny ECHOES from below. \nDARKNESS: This way, fair beauty. I hear a throat begging to be cut. \nLili hesitates when she realises Darkness intends to lead her straight into the flames. \nLILI (fearful): No....! It's impossible! \nDarkness steps into the leaping flames. He turns and takes Lili's hand. \nDARKNESS: Now you are my queen. Nothing is impossible....Come....it takes but a single step....Find the faith.... \nDarkness looks deep into Lili's eyes. She places her tiny foot among the white glowing coals. Nothing happens. Not even the fur is singed. \nLili smiles. Her fear vanishes. She stands at the side of her master. Darkness wraps a powerful arm about the girl and they are consumed by flames, becoming one with the blaze around them. \n112 DELETED \n113 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY \nUnseen by the deformed goblin GUARDS, the faeries creep out of the shadows and take cover behind a squat stone column. \nJack positions Blunder in the corridor entrance with the final plate before joining the others. \nJACK: Everything's ready.... \nGUMP: And you, Jack? Your greatest challenge is still to come.... \nDarkness and Princess Lili emerge, arm in arm, out of a background curtain of fire. They sweep majestically down the stone steps to where the unicorn is chained. \nSilent as mice, Jack and the faeries peer around at them. Jack is horrified by Lili's bestial appearance. JACK: ....oh, God....! Lili.... \nGUMP: Judge her with your heart, not your eyes. \nBlix and Poxand the other goblin Guards scramble to attention as the regal pair ascends. \nBLIX: Greetings.... \nPOX: S-s-s-salutations.... \nDARKNESS: Silence....! Prepare the unicorn for sacrafice! \nThe goblins hurry to comply. Blix selects a grotesque black greatsword from among a rack of weapons. \nPox furiously pedals a grindstone. Blix applies the blade. Showers of sparks shower onto the glistening floor. \nBehind the column, the watching faeries are desparate. Luna's glowing LIGHT hovers above their heads. \nBROWN TOM: The game is lost....for all of Jack's pretty plan... JACK: No! It'll work! It must! \nGUMP: Luna! Fly up to Screwball! Tell him it's time! \nQuick as a FLASH, Luna STREAKS off into the shadows. \nBlix carries the sharpened greatsword to Darkness, offering it with a low bow. \nDARKNESS: Excellent.... Let the ritual begin.... \nThe demon Guards stand in a semi-circle around the unicorn. Blix and Pox open tattered black prayer books. Darkness steps to a twisted lectern and READS from a sinister volume. \nDARKNESS: In the beginning, there was nothing....a void of darkness, a cold enternity of silence.... \nPOX: Endless night, black as death! Mother of Shadows protect us! \nThe assembled Guards answer in a ghastly CHORUS: \nCHORUS OF GUARDS: Mother of Shadows, renew us! \nPOX: Dream Sister....eclipse our pain! \nCHORUS OF GUARDS: Night Bride....restore our strength! \n114 INTERIOR KEEP AND CORRIDORS DAY \nLuna BLAZES straight up out of the abysmal keep; a tiny shooting star. The demons' ceremony continues (OS): \nDARKNESS (OS): ....and when the perfect void was corrupted by Light, a great wailing was heard and all the brethern fled in terror.... \nLuna rockets along the ruined corridors of the labyrinth. \nCHORUS OF GUARDS (OS): Deliver us, O' Darkness, from all fear.... \n115 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY \nLili swings the greatsword high over head. \nCHORUS OF GUARDS (chanting): Blood and fire....eternal ice! Blood and fire....and sacrafice.... \nGump draws back the arrow in the longbow, aiming at Lili. \nJACK: No....! Don't...! \nJack grabs the bow. He and Gump struggle for the weapon. \n118 DELETED \n119 DELETED \n120 DELETED \n120A INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY \nThe beam of LIGHT hits the plate held by the Second Cook in the fireplace. It STREAKS across the the plate leaning on the bellows, ZIGZAGGING out into the corridor. \n120B INTERIOR KEEP DAY \nThe beam of LIGHT ZOOMS out of the corridor, strikes the plate on the viaduct, and REFLECTS down into the lowest depths of the castle. \n121 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY \nGump is determined to shoot Lili. Jack, equally determined to stop him. \nJACK: I trust her, Gump....I'll always trust her.... \nGUMP: Foolish, mortal! \nThe beam of LIGHT STREAMS in through the corridor. Blunder REFLECTS it off his plate towards the others. \nStruggling for the bow, Jack and Gump kick over the propped shielf the moment the LIGHT beam reaches it. \nBROWN TOM: Stop lads....! The light! \nA wild LAUGH bursts from Lili's throat. She swings the sword with all her might. \nThe blade arcs through the air, a glittering SUNBURST where it carves through the deflected beam of LIGHT. \nLili aims not for the mare, but for the line restraning her. The sword severs the woven cable. \nLILI (exultant): Run! You're free....! \nThe unicorn plunges into the shadows. Only the ECHO of her hoofbeats remain. \nJack and Gump stop struggling. Jack dives for his fallen shield. \nDarkness pulls a weapon from his belt. It is the stallion's alicorn mounted as a shortsword. \nDARKNESS (sneering savagely): Innocence! \nHuge and terrible, Darkness lunges for Lili, driving the alicorn straight through her side. \nLili is pierced by the horn. She GASPS, supported by the Demon's hold on the blade. \nMiraculously, Lili's features alter and TRANSFORM. The fangs and claws disappear. Her fur melts like the morning dew. She is an innocent maiden once more. \nLili slides dying off the alicorn and falls to the ground. \nJack holds his shield in the beam of LIGHT, angling in a bright swath towards Darkness. \nJACK: Burn....! You evil bastard.... \nThe LIGHT hits Darkness like an express train. He HOWLS, blasted in a smoking whirlwind across the dungeon. \nDarkness cowers on his knees, SCREAMING in the LIGHT. \nAll the goblins scatter HOWLING from the LIGHT. \nBrown Tom capers a happy two-step around Gump, who stares straight up into the central keep. \nBROWN TOM: ....and we'll dance on the black devil's grave.... \nGUMP'S POV : LOOKING UP: The beam of LIGHT dims and goes out. \nBROWN TOM (OS): What's wrong....? What's happening, Gump? \nGump shrugs, looking sadly at Jack and the darkened shield he holds. \nGUMP (sadly): Sunset.... \nWith a savage SNARL, Darkness staggers off into the gloon, trailing trendrils of smoke. \nJack drops the shield and rushes to Lili's side. He kneels and cradles her in his arms. \nThrowing back his head, Jack HOWLS like a wild animal. His CRY is a wolf-wail of utter despair. \nGump runs frantically up to grieving Green Man. \nGUMP: No, Jack....Quick! He's after the mare! \nGump seizes the grotesque sacraficial greatsword. \nGUMP (cont): The world needs a champion! (handing Jack the black sword) Use this against him! \nJack snatches the sword. He rises cold with fury and runs off into pursuit of Darkness. \n122 DELETED \n123 DELETED \nShe spears Darkness straight his mid-section. The evil Lord SCREAMS, staring down at the shining alicorn thrsut out of his chest. \nDARKNESS (cont): ....Father....! Protect me.... \nDarkness starts to shrink. The mare lifts the writhing demon high in the air, impaled like a kicking insect. \nRearing, the unicorn arches her neck and tosses Darkness over toe edge into the abyss. \nDarkness tumbles into the haze. His final HOWL is a lament from the depths of Hell. \nAt the last moment, the falling figure of Darkness TRANSFORMS into the flapping black cloak and sails off into the shadows. \nJack picks up the alicorn. He wraps his other arm around the unicorn's neck. They stand together at the edge of the world, united in a victorious embrace. \n126C EXTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVERN NIGHT \nThe faeries gather at the entrance. Screwball is there, half asleep. Luna is full-sized. Pale and sleeping, Lili lies on the black cloak. The faeries stand around her, eyes downcast. \nJack rides up, mounted on the unicorn. Surrounded by light, he is more than a champion. He is divine. The faeries are delighted. \nGUMP: Why....Jack....solved your riddle at last.... \nBROWN TOM: Should've known no mortal could speak unicorn like that.... \nJACK: How is Lili? \nGUMP: Sadly beyond the help of faerie magic. She's under a powerful spell.... It's like a riddle.... \nJack understands. He brightens into a smile. \nJAC: I know the answer....! Lift her to me, gently.... \nJack hands Gump the alicorn as the faeries gather Lili in their arms, lifting her above their heads. \nJack carefully pulls the enchanted Princess in front of him across the unicorn's withers. \nJACK (cont): We'll meet again, dear friends.... \nJack touches his heels to the unicorn's flanks and they gallop off in a CLATTER of hoofbeats. \nGUMP (waving): Ride like the wind, Jack.... \nBROWN TOM: Wish we could go with him.... \nGUMP: And why not? I know some magic words that'll do the trick! \nSCREWBALL: Oh no! Not me! I hate to travel like that....makes me sick. \nGUMP: Stand back....! The sky's the limit! \nSCREWBALL: Can't stand your bumpy takeoffs.... \nAbruptly, Screwball SHOOTS into the air, flying out of sight. \nGUMP: Screwball! Wait for the spell.... \nSCREWBALL (os): ....I never do.... \nGump gestures magically. \nGUMP: Eiderdown and milkfeed fluff.... \nAll at once, Gump, Blunder, and Brown Tom STREAK off into space. Luna watches them go. TRANSFORMING into a dot of LIGHT, she speeds up after them. \n127 EXTERIOR FOREST (RIDE MONTAGE) NIGHT \nJack clings to Lili as the unicorn thunders through the midnight forest, darting like quicksilver between the shadowy trees, leaping impossible chasms, splashing across streams in a burst of moonlit spray. \n127A EXTERIOR SKY NIGHT \nThe full moon hangs above like the lantern of God as the faeries tumble through the clear night sky. Gump rides the alicorn like a broomstick. \nFar below, magically white and fluid as free-roving moonbeam, the unicorn carries her passengers across the nocturnal forest with the ease of a dreamer transported through time. \n128 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY It is not yet sun-up. The first faint trace of the false dawn tints the eastern horizon. Everywhere, the snow is melting. It is like springtime, with bold patches of green showing through the frozen landscape. \nA bright beam of LIGHT APPROACHES, weaving between the giant trees. It is Jack and Lili, mounted on the unicorn. \nJack rides up onto the high rock overinghanfing the ponnd and slides easily to the ground with Lili in his arms. \nThe unicorn doesn't move. She stands watching as Jack gently rests Lili down on the mossy earth. \nJack strips off his golden mail coat and steps on the edge of the promontory. He dives gracefully into the pond. \n128A EXTERIOR FOREST DAY \nScrewball in the lead, the faeries CRASH down through the trees, bouncing to a stop on the forest floor. \nSCREWBALL: Ow! \nBROWN TOM: Ouch! \nGUMP (cheerfully): Home again! \nThe bedraggled faeries scowl at Gump. \n129 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY \nJack streaks down, streaming air bubbles like a comet's tail. \n129A EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY \nThe faeries gather around the frozen unicorn stallion. His alicorn has been restored. Wreathed in flowers, it stands majestically out from his forehead. \n", "test1_input": "Squirrels, rabbits, and mice dart fearfully for cover.

Only the night creatures, the wolves, weasels, and owls perk up thier ears to listen. \n11 INTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT \nThe three goblins cower terrified among the gnarled roots. \nBLUNDER: Now what. . . . ? \nBLIX: We sit. . . . We wait. . . . That be our fate! \n11A EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT \nThe goblins wait up on the upper platform of the ruined castle. Blix sits apart from the others, staring out across at the bog. The light of a campfire casts their shifting shadows against the huge trunk of the hollow tree. \nBlix plays with the silver hair. \nBLIX(to himself): Moving silent like the breeze. Soft as shadows, still as trees, Darkness be in all we sees. He lives in silence, he lives in fire, He lives in all that's dark and dire. \nA mysterious floating shape approaches out of the distance. It is a black cloak, wafting through the mist like an airborne manta ray. \n12 EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT \nThe flying cloak wraps about the statue of the skeletal fiddler. The wind presses it tight, revealing the skull through the cloth. \nSuddenly, the statue's head turns to look at the great tree. \n13 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT \nBlix walks to to the edge of the platform, peering into the night. \nBLIX: Look in the gloom, search out the tomb. That be where you find our sire. \nThe pedestal is empty. The statue of the fidder has vanished! \nBlix gets down on his knees, genuflecting, toward the the open bog. \nThe black shadow of the LORD OF DARKNESS falls across him. \nDarkness towers over the ruined castle platform, a huge horned figure drpaed in bacl cloth. An awesome silence ensues. \nBlunder and Pox kneel, heaping ashes and dirt upon thier heads. \nBLIX: Hail O great One. . . . divine and dark! Strong like a lion, swift like a shark. \nBlix offers the silver hair up to Darkness. \nBLIX: Though I'm not worthy of the task Great Lord, I found this for your amusment. \nBlunder leaps to his feet and grabs the hair from Blix. \nBLUNDER: Don't listen to them mealy-mouthed lies boss. . . . I'm the one who found it. . . . Me! Blunder the Bold! \nThere is a bight FLASH OF LIGHT. Blunder HOWLS with pain. \nBlunder stares at his arm in dismay. His hand is gone, magically replaced by a grotesque birdclaw. \nBLUNDER(stunned): Thank you, Lordship . . . . \nBlunder experimently clenches and unclenches his new bird claw. \nPOX: Quite stylish, actually. . . . \nDarkness dangles the shining silver hair in front of him. \nDARKNESS: Where. . . . ? \nBLIX: In the woods, six leagues back, 'Tween Twin Oaks and the Dragon's Track. \nDARKNESS: Did my bold hunters chance to see quarry which cast this spoor? \nBLIX: I stalked it, Sire, but much too slow, What beast it be I do not know. \nDARKNESS: This hair is from an angel of light. . . It comes this way rarely. . . I must have this creature! \nBLIX: Oh Divine Dark One, teach us how to catch this creature. \nPOX: Your instruction would be m-m-most ap-p-preciated. \nBLUNDER: Amen! I wants to learn! I craves knowledge! \nDARKNESS: No trap of yours will work. . . . There is only lure for such disgusting goddness. . . .one bait which never fails. . . . \nBLIX: Name the bait, Lord. . . . \nDARKNESS: Innoncence! \n14 EXTERIOR COTTAGE MEADOW DAY \nA beautiful flower-spangled meadow alive with songbirds. \nBaby rabbits frolic in the tall grass where industrious squirrels forage for acorns and nuts. \nA delicate fawn gambols under the watchful eye of the doe. Clouds of multi-hued butterflies swirl overhead. \nWaist-deep in flower, a young princess skips SINGING across the meadow. Her name is LILI. She wears splendid brocades and carries a bouquet wrapped in a lace napkin. Like these blossoms, she is beautiful and fresh and innocent. \nTiny birds fly down and land on her head and shoulders. She laughs as a warbling wren takes a seed from her lips. \nLILI(singing): Come down sparrow, sing me good morning. Rise up sun, light the arch of the sky. Living river, turn light to diamonds, When I look in my true love's eyes. \nLili runs towards a distant thatched-roofed cottage. \n15 EXTERIOR BOULDER AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY \n", "test1_true": "BLIX(whipering): Darkness say the perfect lure Always be a virgin pure. . . . \n15A EXTERIOR COTTAGE AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY \nThe WOODCARVER'S WIFE is hangin up the washing when Lili sneaks from behind the cottage. \nGrinning micheviously, Lili unfastens one end of the clothes-line and lets it drop. \nThe laundry flutters onto the new-mown grass, A sheet drpaes around the outraged wife. \nWIFE: Dad-blamed faeries! \n16 INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY \nThe cottage is snug and homey with smoke-blackened beams and hand- pegged furniture. A WOODCARVER sleeps by his bench surrounded by wood-shavings and roughed-out toys. \nLili steps into the sunlight streaming through the open doorway. Her beauty is etheral, an angel descending. \nFinches peck at newly-made tarts laid on a trestle table to cool. They rise to the rafters as at Lili's approach. \nThe Princess peeks around the room. She tiptoes to the hearth and lifts the stewpot lid, dipping a finger in for a taste. \nSpying the tarts, she grabs one and eats it hurriedly, leaving a telltale crumb on her upper lip. \nThe clock tolls the hour. A carved wooden maiden piroettes from the interior, pursued by a skeletal fiddler playing a bone fiddle. Lili is fancinated. \nThe Woodcarver's Wife enters. She curtsies to the Princess. \nWIFE: God Bless Your Highness. A royal visit is ever a joy. \nLILI: I've not come to visit, Nell \nWIFE: Won't you stay for a tart? \nNell pulls a tray from the oven. \nWIFE(cont): They're fresh-baked. \nLILI: I've no time today. \nWIFE(teasing): The Princess must have a sweetheart waiting. \nLILI: Nonsense! \nWIFE: Surely the king forbids such folly \nLILI: What my father doesn't know won't hurt him. \nWIFE: The wilful heart invites despair, Like blind men creeping in a dragon's lair. \nWith Nell's back turned, Lili steals another tart, hiding it among the flowers in her bouquet. \nLILI: Neither country provebs nor king's command can keep me out of the woods today. \nWIFE: Then it's common sense ought. These woods be thick with spriggen and banshee! \nLILI: Is that why you've hung a bell over the door? \nWIFE: Aye, and spread the floor with flax and salt. My babe won't be stole by faeries. \nThe Princess starts merrily for the sun-bright doorway. \nLILI(laughing): More salt, Nell. . . .! You'll worry yourself to death if you're not careful. \nLili runs out like a naughty child. The Woodcarver's Wife leans against the door jamb and calls after her: \nWIFE: Beware of toadstool rings and willow trees. . . . ! Stay away from old oaks! \n17 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH TO GLADE DAY \nHiding behind a moss-coverd log, Blix, Pox, and Blunder watch Princess Lili run SINGING through the woods, oblivous to any sign of danger. \nBLIX(scowling): May be innocent. . . . May be sweet. . . . Ain't half as nice as rotten meat. . . . ! \n18 EXTERIOR JACK'S FOREST GLADE DAY \nA lovely glade surrounded by tall trees, Breathlessly, Lili runs in from the woods. She is familair with this spot. It is her trysting place \nLILI(calling): Jack. . . . ! I know you're here. . . . Jack! \nLili looks around in exasperation. Behind her, something wild and mysterious swings through the trees like an animal. \nLILI(cont): Jack? Where are you. . . . ? Answer me! \nLili is apprehensive at getting no reply. She hears the RUSTLE of the leaves but does not see the sun-dappled figure leaping from limb to limb overhead. \nLILI(frightened)(cont): Oh, Jack. . . . please say something if you're here. . . . \nJACK O' THE GREEN, a legendry \"Green Man\" who lives the free life of a hermit in the woods, drops down from a tree behind the Princess, landing without a sound. He is barefoot, about sixteen, and wears woven ivy leaves and skins. \nStartled, Lili SCREAMS. \nLILI(cont): Jack! You scared the life out of me. \nJack says nothing, staring at her shyly. Lili hands him the flowers. \nA JAY flies down out of the greenery and lands RASPING on Jack's shoulder. He imitates the bird expertedly, The Jay answers him in English: \nJAY: She brings a gift as fair as herself. \nLili LAUGHS, It all seems magic to her. \nLILI: You're so clever, Jack. . . . See what you can find in the flowers. \n", "test2_input": "Jack pokes in the bouquet and discovers the stolen tart. He stuffs it immediately into his mouth. \nJACK: Mmmmmmm. . . . \nLILI: Sweet? \nJAY: Sweets from the sweet. \nJACK: I know someone sweeter. \nLili blushes. \n19 EXTERIOR ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST DAY \nConcealed behind the trees, Blix, Pox and Blunder watch the Green Man and the Princess wander down a meandering path. \nPox picks a spider from his web, pops it in his mouth, and crunches it down with a happy smile. \n19A EXTERIOR MEANDERING PATH DAY \nSeveral birds perch on Jack's head and shoulders. Squirrels, rabbits and hedgehogs play about his feet. Jack feeds them nuts and berries from his pouch, answering their chatter expertedly. Jack understands the language of all wild creatures. \nWhen a frisky wren flies warbling overhead, Lili hesitantly returns its call. \nJACK: That was very good. . . .just right. \nLILI: Teach me rabbit like you promised. \nJACK: Rabbit is much harder than wren. \nLILI: Let me try. I'm a very good student. . . . My father thinks I'm brilliant. . . \nLili toys with the silver madallion pendant she wears, causing reflected sunlight to shine in Jack's eyes. \nLILI(cont): See how brilliant I am! \nJACK(laughing): Stop it. . . . ! I can't see! \nLILI: Don't I dazzle you with my wisdom? \nLili seems to glow with sunlight. Jack stares at her, rapt with love. \nJACK: Much more than wisdom dazzles me. \nLili LAUGHS and hangs her madallion around his neck. \nLILI: Then teach me rabbit. \nJACK: Not today. . . . There's something really special I promised to show you. \nLILI(delighted): Oh, Jack. Do you mean it? \nJACK: If it pleases you. \nLILI: More than anything! \nJACK: This is their season. They won't pass here again for a long, long time. . . . If you want to see them, you must do everything I tell you. \nLILI: I swear. . . on my honour! \nJACK: I'm taking you to a very special place. . . it's sort of sacred. Nobody but me knows where it is, and, well. . . . \nLILI(impatient): What? Tell me! \nJack unwraps the lace napkin from Lili's bouquet. \nJACK: You'll have to wear a blindfold. \nLILI(coyly): Don't you trust me, Jack? \nJACK: I'll always trust you, Lili. . . . \n20 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH, GLADE TO STREAM DAY \nJack holds Lili's hand, leading her blindfolded along a path through the woods.

Haven't you a cosy place to hide? \nJACK: Many places. . . .None fit for a princess. . . . \nLILI: In these woods you are the prince, Jack. . . . I am only a pauper here. . . . \nJack turns to face a radiantly smiling Lili. He bends towards her, closer and closer, and, for a moment, seems about to steal a kiss. She waits, smiling, sensing what is about to happen. In the end, Jack's innoncence and timidity get the best of him and he turns away. Without his knowledge Lili lifts a corner of the blindfold and mischievously peeks. \n20A EXTERIOR BEHIND A TREE NEAR THE PATH DAY \nThe three goblin peer around a mossy trunk. \nBLUNDER: Yuck! Did you see what he was gonna do? Makes me want to puke! \nBLIX: I swear by all the bats above, Nothing's quite so foul as love! \n21 EXTERIOR UNICORN STREAM AND GLADE DAY \nA sun-glided amphithtre within the darker confines of the forest. Sparkling like a ribbon of diamonds, a stream flows down the middle. \nJack leads Lili out of the woods and unties the napkin from around her eyes. \nLILI(aewstruck): Oh, Jack. . . .! It's magic! \n21A EXTERIOR STREAMSIDE SHUBBERY DAY \n", "test2_true": "LILI: How much longer? \nJACK: Be patient! \nLili kneels by the bank of the streem, cupping water into her hands.

No animal will drink here now. \nLILI(indignant): I want some water. \nJACK: Shhh! \nLILI: Don't tell me to be quiet. . . .!

True royalty approaches. . . . \n22 EXTERIOR THE STREAM (JACK & LILI'S POV) DAY \nThe radiant LIGHT BEAMS GLEAM through the trees. A moment later, a splendid white unicorn moves down the hillside to the edge of the stream. This is a stallion. He holds his head proudly. His mate stands at the edge of the woods. \nLILI(OS): Ohh....They're so beautiful.... \nThe unicorn dips his horns into the stream. \nJACK(OS): The alicorn purifies the water. . . . \nThe stallion watches his mare approach to drink.

You risk your immortal soul. \nLili pulls free and steps into the clearing. \nLILI: You sound like my confessor. . . . I only want to touch one. \nThe Princess strides defiantly into the open meadow. \nThe unicorns watch the girl from across the stream. They snort and paw the ground. \nLili stands alone, holding her arms to the unicorns. \nLILI(singing): Like a child feels watching a rainbow. Like a brid feels the first time it flies I feel magic stirring within me, When I look in my true love's eyes. \nThe Stallion's nostrils flare. His strong neck arches. Sunlight gleams on his horn as he charges. \nFrom Lili's POV the stallion is terrifying as he thunders towards her acroos the stream. \nThe stallion rears and prances, racing around the Princess as if drawn foward on an invisable lead. \nJack watches from the underbrush, his outrage tinged with more than a touch of jealously. \n25 EXTERIOR BOULDER DAY \nBlix, Pox and Blunder peer from their hiding-place. Evil leers brighten their impish features. \nPOX(whipering): M-m-might as well be fish in a barrel. . . One would hope for a t-t-touch more sp-p-port. . . . \nBlix clamps his hand over Pox's mouth. \nBLIX: Pox! Shut your yap! \n26 EXTERIOR CLEARING DAY \nThe lureof the virgin is too strong for the unicorn to resist.

Dance you life away! \nJACK: Threats can't make you love you. Human hearts don't work that way. \nLUNA: What care I for human heart? Soft and spiritless as porridge! A faerie's heart beats fierce and free. \nThere is a furious pytotechnic whirlwind and, in an instant, Luna returns to a tiny dot of LIGHT. \nJACK: Luna....? \nWithout an answer, Luna flies out between the iron bars. \nJACK(cont) (to the faeries): I.... didn't mean to hurt her. \nGUMP(scornful): Your fine senseibilities have left us here to rot. \nThe SOUND of heavy footsteps approaches, accompanied by rough, tuneless SINGING. \nCOOK(os): ....this li'l piggie went to market.... anudder li'l pigge got eat.... pig-meat pie, l'l piggie die.... \nBLUNDER: Oh, no! He's coming...! Hide! Hide! Hide! \nBlunder conceals himself under a pile of straw. A deformed shadow is cast across the cage. \nSCREWBALL: Blunder's got the right idea! \nScrewball hides in the straw. Jack and the other immediately do the same. \nA fiendish demon COOK opens the cage door. He is ten feet tall and unspeakably ugly. He peers blindly inside, sniffing the air with his hideous nose. \nCOOK: ....pig-pig-pig...

Instantly, she reduces to a tiny dot of LIGHT and flies out of the alcove. \nGUMP: Well done! \nGump unlocks the barred door and they all clamber out. Screwball steps on Brown Tom's head in his eagerness. \nSCREWBALL: Lemme outta this stink hole! \nBROWN TOM: Mind you bleeding foot! \nGUMP: Shhhh! \nJack is the last of all. \nJACK: Keep behind me in case there's trouble. \nSword in hand, Jack ;eads the faeries out of the alcove into the kitchen. \n70 INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY \nHuge ovens belch fire and smoke. The vast hearth blazes. Like the lower reaches of Hell, the Dark Lord's kitchen is a place where all hope is abandoned. \nJack and the faeries creep through the brimstone haze. \nBROWN TOM: Terrible sight for a sober man to see.... \nJACK: Quiet! \nThe demon Cooks blocks the way, chopping meat with a montrous cleaver, A SECOND COOK, every bit as terrifying, SNORES by the hearth. Trussed to a spit, Blunder hangs upside-down nearby. \nJack motions the faeries on. The blind Cook turns them, sniffing the air. \nCOOK: Whut be there? \n", "test3_true": "SCREWBALL: ....Back in the frying pan! \nGump clamps his hand over Screwball's mouth. \nGrasping his cleaver, the Cook advances towards them. \nCOOK(sniffing): Be it live victuals? \nFrom where he hangs, Blunder sees the faeries' plight. \nBLUNDER(calling out): Hey....!

Den it no be so pretty! \nThe Cook backhands poor Blunder, smacking him about like a punching bag. \nJack and the faeries make a break for the exit. \nBlunder manages to work one arm free from his bonds. \nCOOK(cont): Whut you got to say now, pork pie? \nBlunder rears back and punches the Cook in the jaw. Stunned, he topples over over backwards a great CRASH. \n70A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \nThe reverberations tremble through the immense underground castle. Darkness listens by the fire. \nDARKNESS: Do you feel it, Father....? A force....loose in my domain.... \nVOICE(out of fire): Guard well what is yours! \nDARKNESS(roaring): BRING INNOCENCE TO ME! \n71 INTERIOR KITCHEN CORRIDOR DAY \nThe faerie band gathers in the foul, dripping corridor. Irregular torchlight casts a lurid glow across the broken stones. \nBROWN TOM (gasping for breath): .....saved....by a goblin.... Never thought....I'd see....the day.... \nJACK: Wish we could repay the favour! \nSCREWBALL: My brother can take of himself. \nGUMP: Screwball's right! It's more important we find the unicorn. \nJACK: And Lili! \nBROWN TOM: Where do we start? \nGUMP: We must find the dungeons.

You search with the rest of us! \nScrewball hugs Jack's leg. \nSCREWBALL: All right! I'm going with Jack! \nGUMP: No you won't. Be faster if we split up. \nScrewball looks both ways, deciding which seems safest. \nSCREWBALL: Fine! I'm going this way! \nBROWN TOM: I'm going that way! \nThey both turn and collide, falling flat on their rumps. \nJACK: Wait....! Better to search in teams, Gump and me together. Brown TOm, you and Screwball look in the other direction. \nGump hauls out his ornate timepeice. \nGUMP: Right! Let's synchronise! We meet back here in twice five hundred beats of a bluebird's heart. \nBrown Tom takes a similar timepeice from under his tunic and studies its intricate interior. \nBROWN TOM: Best to allow another couple dozen butterfly breaths in case we get thirs....er, get lost.... \nGUMP: No grog shops down here, Brown Tom. \nJACK: Let's hurry! \nJack and Gump run off along the corridor, followed by Luna's glowing LIGHT. Screwball watches without moving. \nSCREWBALL: Know what I want to know? \n"}

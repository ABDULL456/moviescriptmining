People hug and console each other. Joel sees Suzie, walks over to her. 
JOEL Hi... You doing okay? 
SUZIE Yeah, I'm okay. 
JOEL I heard you were right there when it happened. That must've been rough. 
SUZIE It was horrible Joel. He came over to ask for that check, and I just... Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING. 
SUZIE (CONT'D) .I just lost it. I started yelling at him. I said horrible things. He had an aneurism and I probably caused it. 
(CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY) I think the last thing I said to him was "shut up." Those were the last words he heard. Joel hugs her, consoling. 
JOEL It's okay, it's not your fault... It's not your fault. Suzie's crying subsides a little. 
SUZIE It could happen to any of us Joel. Any of us could have an aneurism. We could die at any moment. 
JOEL Yeah, I know... I know... But we probably won't. It'll be alright. Suzie starts to regain her composure. They stand there for a beat. 
JOEL You wanna go get something to eat... or something? Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little. 
SUZIE Yeah, okay. Sure. 
They walk off towards the cemetery gates. After a while, Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex. 
JOEL Here... 
SUZIE Thanks. They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby. 
JOEL Maybe we should've been married in a Church like that one. Instead of the Botanical Gardens. 
SUZIE I thought you liked the Botanical Gardens? 
JOEL Yeah, but... a church just seems more -- I don't know -- official. 
SUZIE You think it would've made a difference? 
JOEL I don't know... So, are we still married? 
SUZIE Well, legally yes. 
JOEL I mean otherwise. 
SUZIE Hmmm... We can talk about it I suppose. 
JOEL Alright. They walk for a beat. 
JOEL You know, this is really bad, but... Oh never mind. 
SUZIE What? 
JOEL Well, as I was looking down at Nathan there, I was thinking... That's the longest I've ever seen him with his mouth shut. Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself. 
SUZIE Joel! They walk off into the distance as we 
FADE OUT.

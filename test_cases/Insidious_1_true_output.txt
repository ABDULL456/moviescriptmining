The formerly bustling kitchen is now a museum at midnight. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
A long, dark thoroughfare. A ticking clock its only occupant. 
INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT 
Stairs swallowed up by darkness. The groan of settling wood. 
INT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The soft breathing of a sleeping child. 
INT. CALI'S NURSERY - NIGHT 
Hanging toy birds dangle over the baby, tinkling in a breeze. 
INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Dalton is sleeping too. Impossibly still. Lying on his back. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Renai and Josh are entwined together. Josh is snoring. They are both blissfully asleep... 
...for now. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Another day, another chaotic breakfast. 
Foster waves a stuffed toy around. Josh charges in, bits of tissue on his face from shaving cuts. Cali flails her arms in her high chair. Renai is at the sink, whisking eggs. 
RENAI Foster, sit down honey. 
She whips a look around. 
RENAI (CONT'D) Where is...? Hey Josh, could you go wake up Dalton? 
We FOLLOW Josh as he marches down the corridor to Dalton's bedroom, poking his head inside. 
INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Josh knocks on the wall. 
JOSH Time to get up, my man. Come on. 
Nothing from Dalton. He doesn't even stir. Josh rolls his eyes and walks in. Nudges Dalton with his knee. 
JOSH (CONT'D) You're making me look bad here. Outta bed before your mother comes in and kills both of us. 
Nothing. He's really out. 
Josh reaches down and shakes Dalton vigorously. 
JOSH (CONT'D) Dalton, get up. You've gotta get ready for school. 
Josh waits for a response, but none comes. Dalton is as slack as a puppet. Something resembling concern crosses Josh's face. 
JOSH (CONT'D) Dalton...? 
He kneels down, shaking Dalton hard. He listens for breathing. 
JOSH (CONT'D) Dalton? Dalton?! DALTON!! 
His scream takes us into-- 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, ICU UNIT - DAY 
--the stern sterility of a hospital. 
Josh and Renai, eyes lined by dark circles, stand in front of a dour neurologist, DR. JOEL SERCARZ (46). 
Renai dabs her eyes with a tissue. They are red with tears. Beyond a window in front of them, lying on a gurney in an ICU chamber, is the unconscious body of Dalton. 
DR. SERCARZ Okay...as of yet, our tests have not drawn any conclusive answers for you. Repeated blood and CSF cultures are normal, making an infective origin highly unlikely. Tests for Lyme disease and repeated polymerase chain reaction are negative. Systemic vasculitis was ruled out. Dalton remains in an areactive coma without focal signs or abnormal brainstem reflexes. 
Josh and Renai struggle to follow the cold, multi-syllable medical terminology...like stranded tourists keeping up with a foreign language. 
DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D) We've looked for bacterial pathogens like Meningoencephalitis, but haven't seen anything. (MORE) 
DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D) I wouldn't say we've exhausted every single angle...but we're close. The underlying cause is still unknown. 
Josh and Renai look in at their boy.

HAN (reeling from the odor) Whew... 
LUKE Dagobah... 
HAN This may smell bad, kid... 
LUKE (moaning) Yoda... 
HAN ...but it will keep you warm... til I get the shelter built. (struggling to get Luke inside the carcass) Ooh... I thought they smelled bad on the outside! 
The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter container.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection against a bitter Hoth night. 
EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN 
Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape. 
INT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT 
There is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft.  He concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit.  He hears a low beep from one of his monitors. 
ZEV (into transmitter) Echo Base... I've got something!  Not much, but it could be a life form. 
EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT 
The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new direction. 
INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT 
The pilot switches over to a new transmitter. 
ZEV (into transmitter) This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two. 
There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice. 
HAN (filtered over Zev's receiver) Good morning.  Nice of you guys to drop by. 
ZEV (switching transmitters) Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I found them.  Repeat, I found them. 
EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY 
The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side. A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift.  Han spots Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his arms frantically at the tiny craft. 
INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER 
Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment.  A switch is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank filled with a thick, gelatinous slime.  He begins to thrash about, raving in delirium. 
INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM 
Luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling.  His face shows terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack.  Threepio and Artoo enter the room. 
THREEPIO Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again. 
Artoo beeps his good wishes. 
THREEPIO Artoo expresses his relief, also. 
Han and Chewie make their entrance.  The Wookiee growls a greeting. 
HAN How are you feeling, kid?  You don't look so bad to me.  In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. 
LUKE Thanks to you. 
HAN That's two you owe me, junior. 
Han turns as Leia enters the room.  He looks at her with a big, devilish grin. 
HAN Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. 
LEIA (haughtily) I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. 
HAN That's a good story.  I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight. 
LEIA I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain. 
Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner.  Han, enjoying himself, regards Chewie good-humoredly. 
HAN Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. 
Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia. 
HAN She expressed her true feelings for me. 
Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han. 
LEIA My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half- witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf- herder! 
HAN Who's scruffy-looking? (to Luke) I must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?

He glasses. She smokes, waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
DELTA (CONT'D) Here we go. 
He hands her the binoculars. 
DELTA (CONT'D) Look right there. 
--THROUGH THE BINOCULARS WE LOOK OVER JUAREZ-- 
She sees it. Muzzle flashes. Right on the street. Rifle fire glowing white against the muddy gray of Juarez at dusk. Gone as fast as it came. She looks at Delta. 
DELTA (CONT'D) Keep looking. 
She begins scanning the city. Sirens. Everywhere. She sees another muzzle flash. She looks up. 
MACY I don't hear anything. 
DELTA Can't. Too far away. Keep looking. They're everywhere. 
She scans the city slowly. Sirens. More sirens. The city is lit in a throbbing red and blue. 
MACY Unbelievable. 
DELTA Madness, huh. 
He bums a drag from her cigarette. They sit in silence and watch the city go to war. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- NIGHT. 
Macy, Matt, and Alejandro walk through the parking lot. Macy is exhausted. Matt's on his cell phone. 
MATT Can they get them all in one place? No... I'm on a clock now, I can't wait... No, contact Bob Fiske. Have him hold all of them at the staging center.( Turns to Macy) How far is Tuscon? 
MACY From here? Little over two hours. 
MATT We'll be there a little after 2. 
Not what Macy wanted to hear. 
MACY We're going to Tucson? 
MATT You gotta learn how to sleep on a plane. 
Reggie leans against the Tahoe. Not very happy. 
REGGIE They let me on the base when this peckerwood needs a ride, don't they? 
MACY REGGIE- 
MATT (Pleasant as can be) Has nothing to do with your race. I just don't believe you're good enough at your job yet to be of any use. Kate's sure fond of you, though. 
REGGIE Thanks, man. I feel much better now. 
Reggie spots Alejandro. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Who's that. 
Macy shakes her head, doesn't have the strength to go into it. 
MACY We're going to Tucson. 
Matt and Alejandro get in the back seat of the Tahoe. We push in on Alejandro's emotionless face. 
REGGIE (O.S.) Now? 
She nods and yawns at the same time. Reggie takes her in. 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Hey... How was it? 
MACY Bad. 
REGGIE What happened? 
She moves toward the front of the car. 
MACY Now's not the time.

ALICE Darling, you're a Roosevelt. What do you know about people? 
She leans in conspiratorially. 
ALICE Of course, I can think of one person you did manage to find the time to invest in. A Miss Mercer, I believe? 
FRANKLIN Alice, stop. 
ALICE Don't misunderstand me, Franklin. Being married to Eleanor I think you deserved some fun. But you made the right decision. Especially since Miss Mercer has gone on with her life. 
FRANKLIN What are you talking about? 
ALICE Edward Rutherford is a wonderful catch for a girl like her. 
FRANKLIN (stunned) She's married? 
ALICE Last week. A small event, of course. 
FRANKLIN When I last heard she was governess to his children. 
ALICE (with a smile) And then love bloomed. As a "man of the people," I wouldn't be too hard on her, Franklin. We can't all have trust funds you know. 
EXT. STATEN ISLAND BOY SCOUT CAMP - DAY Franklin, Louis and a PHOTOGRAPHER disembark from a touring car. 
LOUIS We're not taking this defeat lying down, boss. We'll run you for Governor -- 
FRANKLIN (kidding) Really? Of which state? 
Louis shoots him a look. 
LOUIS Very funny. No, this buys you time. It buys you experience. 
FRANKLIN What about Al Smith? 
LOUIS He's vulnerable. You're still a fresh face, boss. We'll use that to our advantage. 
They walk down a hill towards some waiting Boy Scouts as the PHOTOGRAPHER follows them. 
FRANKLIN Boy Scouts, Louis? Hardly my political base. 
LOUIS They've got parents. Besides they're photogenic. 
Franklin begins glad-handing the assembled group of mostly underprivileged children. 
FRANKLIN Franklin Roosevelt, happy to meet you. 
Franklin masks his thinly veiled discomfort with an artificial good cheer. Meanwhile, Louis, in full political mode, makes sure the L Photographer gets everything. 
OUIS Over here! 
Franklin poses with two Scouts. The picture is taken. 
SCOUTMASTER Okay, boys, lunch. Line up to wash! (to Franklin) Will you be joining us? 
FRANKLIN Of course! 
Franklin steps into a line before a large communal water barrel and glances sideways at GUISEPPE, 9, an immigrant child of the city streets. He wears his uniform proudly and smiles at Franklin. 
FRANKLIN What's your name, son? 
GUISEPPE Guiseppe. 
Franklin puts his arm around Guiseppe, forcing the moment between them. He waits patiently as the cameras click away. 
FRANKLIN Guiseppe! Come sta, ragazzo? 
GUISEPPE (puzzled) Okay, I guess. 
The SCOUTS begin washing their hands together in the water barrel and Franklin joins in as Louis looks on admiringly. 
As Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face, Franklin, not to be outdone, does so as well. It's all for the cameras.

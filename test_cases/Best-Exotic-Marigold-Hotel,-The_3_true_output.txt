EVELYN They should be. The hotel paid for them. I'm sure they'd rather have us there than not. And its fantastically cheap for the first three months. 
CHRISTOPHER I wonder why. They walk on in silence. 
CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) How will we know you're alright? 
EVELYN I'll call. They do have phones there, you know. Or you can just read my blog. 
CHRISTOPHER Your what? 
EVELYN On the interweb. You can log in whenever you like, read my news. 
CHRISTOPHER I just hope the first item will be announcing your return. I don't suppose they'll be paying for the journey back...? Evelyn stops. They've reached the terminal. 
EVELYN Could you please, before I go, say one thing that is supportive? Because I've never done anything like this before. 
CHRISTOPHER Without Dad, you never did anything at all. And i don't think you'll be able to cope. 
EVELYN Well. I suppose we'll find out, won't we? They head into the building. 
20 INT. CHECK-IN AREA. AIRPORT - EVENING 20 
Madge is at the First Class Check-In desk. 
MADGE And the connecting flight to Jaipur is first class too? The check-in girl nods, hands Madge back her passport. 
MADGE (CONT'D) I tell you, it's tough to get upgraded nowadays. I had to flirt so hard with the travel agent, it was practically phone sex. 
21 INT. SECURITY AREA. AIRPORT - EVENING 21 
The light is fading. 
15A. Norman appears to be relishing a detailed search from a female Security Guard. 
NORMAN Come on. Thorough as you like Muriel is waiting to collect her bag from the belt. 
SECURITY GUARD We'd like to take a look in this bag, Madam, if you don't mind. He lifts the bag onto a table. It's heavier than he thought. 
SECURITY GUARD (cont'd) What you got in here anyway? He opens the bag, stares in astonishment. 
MURIEL PG Tips. Brown sauce. Ten jars of Marmite. Thirty one packets of Chocolate Hobnobs. Pickled onions. Pickled eggs. And pickle. 
SECURITY GUARD No liquids on the plane. 
MURIEL What does that mean? 
SECURITY GUARD It means you can't take the pickled onions. Or the pickled eggs. 
(BEAT) The pickle's fine. 
22 INT. BOARDING GATE. AIRPORT - EVENING/NIGHT 22 
The passengers from Flight 1045 to Delhi are seated at the gate, waiting to board. Muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end of the only remaining row of empty chairs. Douglas and Jean are already sitting there. Jean smiles politely as Graham sits down a couple of seats away. Norman arrives, carrying his battery radio, sees an empty place between Jean and Madge, who is sitting at the end. He smiles knowingly at Madge as he sits. Finally Evelyn takes the only available space, between Graham and Douglas. And there the seven passengers wait patiently, unaware of their common fate. The sound of a jet engine, quiet at first, finally engulfs them. 
23 EXT. RUNWAY. INDIA - DAWN 23 
The plane cruises down through a stunning sunset, and lands at Delhi Airport. 
24 INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL, DELHI - DAY 24 
Evelyn, Douglas, Jean and Graham are descending on an escalator. Madge is a few steps up. 
JEAN Obviously one's read one's Kipling, but we view this as an opportunity to explore another culture, as well as making new friends. And a retired judge is just the class of guest one was hoping for, isn't it Douglas? 
DOUGLAS I'm sorry? 
GRAHAM 
(TO EVELYN) And is this your first time in India? 
JEAN You don't seem like an experienced traveller. 
EVELYN I'm not. Although one has read one's guidebooks. Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas hides his. And Madge sees it all. As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator. Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair. 
NORMAN Norman Cousins. 
MADGE Madge Hardcastle. A pleasure. 
NORMAN Play your cards right, it could be. Madge stares at him. A voice comes over the tannoy.

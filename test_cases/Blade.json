{"test1_input": "-- Mercury has fangs now too. In fact, everyone in the club does, with the exception of poor Dennis. That's because they're all vampires. \nDennis tries to run, but the burly Doorman blocks his exit, brutally smashing his fist into Dennis' face. \nDennis falls, dazed. The club-goers close in around him. They make a game of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces leering like twisted jack-o-lanterns. \nThe strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensity. Dennis spins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -- Dennis lands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up. A DARK FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. The figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt -- \nA BLACK MAN, \ntowers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of horror. His name is BLADE. \nBlade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an arsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body: \n6-point adjustable body armor, a modified CAR-15 assault rifle with an ultra-violet entry light, two Casull .454 revolvers, a \"Demon\" automatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of mahogany stakes, an Indian-style katar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his namesake -- a silver sword which is secured in a back-scabbard. \nCLOSE ON BLADE \nA gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers stare back. Nuclear silence. And then -- \nAll hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving at superhuman speed, practically a blur -- \nBlade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions -- \nMACRO BULLET SHOT \nas a round roars through the air towards Raquel. A silver-tipped dum- dum bullet which explodes on contact. \nWHAM! The round punches a fist-sized hole through Raquel's chest, continuing on into the vamp behind her! Vampire blood fountains. Both creatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of black oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains. \nBlade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He holsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on the UV entry light mounted above -- \nMERCURY \nleaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything move so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into the night just as -- \n-- a shaft of blinding UV \"sunlight\" cuts across the vampires. They rear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade opens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets into the crowd -- vampire genocide. \nThe strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes clogged with liquefying bodies -- \n-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their opening, surge forward en masse -- \nBlade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!- unsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip. \nTHE SWORD \nFour acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so sharp it could cleave a shadow in two. \nBlade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING VAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half -- \nON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB, \na LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword, sending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the vampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies. \nBeat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses -- \nSOMETHING BIG \nrising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward, cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb falls to the floor -- \n-- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into Blade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables, slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the ceiling. \nBlade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot- something nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head, jaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual scarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos. \nBlade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at bay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a stake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx. Quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. \nBlade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his leg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open, drawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES -- \nThe bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and nailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to pull out the stake -- \nBlade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm, effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board. \nUP ABOVE, \nmounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. Blade fires a cross-bow bolt straight into the lens. \nBlade strides over, placing his sword against Quinn's chest. \nBLADE Where is Deacon Frost? \n", "test1_true": "BLADE Got something in your throat. \nBlade yanks the stake free. The vampire laughs, air whistling through his ruined larynx. \nQUINN Fuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying shit -- \nBLADE Frost. \nQuinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade sees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness -- \nQUINN You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's rising, the Sleeper's gonna -- \nBlade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH! Quinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work, ignoring the howling pyre behind him: \nAll evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few oily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by the acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition. \nDENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade approaches, he cringes back -- \nDENNIS Please don't -- \nBlade simply grabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward, rotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren't any. \nBlade moves on, leaving Dennis alone amidst the carnage. As Blade starts up the stairs, he pauses in mid-step -- \nA COCKROACH \nscurries out from underfoot. \nBlade adjusts his footfall, sparing the roach. He continues on up the stairs, disappearing in the smoky haze. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CITY HOSPITAL, AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT \nCAMERA FOLLOWS a bagged corpse as it's rolled into the autopsy room by an ASSISTANT. \nASSISTANT Brought you a baked potato, nice and crispy. Still warm, too. \nCURTIS WEBB, the forensic pathologist (30s, white bread, a little on the smarmy side) steps forward, unzips the bag -- \nIt's Quinn, what's left of him, anyway. Burnt to a charcoal briquette, limbs twisted horribly, oozing fluids. \nCurtis turns his head, grimacing, wafting the air. \nCURTIS Jesus, that's rank -- \nCurtis turns back, makes note of the blackened stump where Quinn's arm used to be, the ruined throat -- \nCURTIS What's his story? \nASSISTANT Paramedics said he was still screaming when they found him. Looks like some joker had stapled him to a wall. \nCURTIS Pretty. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL, HEMATOLOGY LAB - NIGHT \nMICROSCOPE POV \nof a slide-mounted blood smear stained with Wright stain (blue ink). What we see is a collection of donut-shaped pink things (red blood cells) intermingled with some small blue specks (platelets) and the occasional larger, light-blue blobs (white blood cells). \nKAREN JANSEN (20s), a fine-featured hematologist with a social life in suspended animation, sits back from the microscope, stumped. Next to her is JULIE WHITAKER, a cheerful chemtech. \nKAREN You took this off a DOA? \nCurtis sits on a stool nearby, slowly nodding. \nKAREN This isn't human blood. \nCURTIS Then what is it? \nKAREN I don't know -- (re: microscope) Look at this blood smear -- \nCurtis takes a look for himself. \nKAREN The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them. (shaking her head) Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated. \n", "test1_id": 2097, "test2_input": "FROST Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it. (cryptically) Which, of course, they do. \nDRAGONETTI You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost. \nFROST Perhaps. \nFrost studies Dragonetti, a self-satisfied grin on his face. If the act was intended to unnerve Dragonetti, it succeeded, though the ancient vampire would never admit it. \nDRAGONETTI What are you up to, Frost? \nFrost shuts the lid on his laptop, rising, drawing intimidatingly close to Dragonetti. \nFROST'S VOICE Wouldn't you like to know, Old Fang? \nA beat as the young turk stares his elder down. Dragonetti is the first to lose his nerve. Frost smiles and exits, leaving the old vampire to lick his wounds. \nCAMERA DRIFTS back to the hulking silhouette, which has been eavesdropping on the conversation. It quivers in fear. \nINT. BLADE'S OLDS (ON KAREN'S STREET CORNER) - DAY \nBlade brings the car to a stop. Karen looks at him. His eyes are hidden behind his glasses, his expression stone. \nBLADE Remember what we said. Keep your eyes open. They're everywhere. \nEXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nAs Karen climbs out, Blade swings the door shut behind her. The Olds ROARS off down the quiet residential street. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, LOBBY - DAY \nKaren crosses the lobby, stepping into an elevator. Just as the doors are closing, a WOMAN and TWO MEN duck in alongside her. \nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY \nSilence, the uncomfortableness of an elevator ride magnified tenfold. Karen can FEEL the eyes of her fellow passengers upon her. Finally succumbing to paranoia, she hazards a glance -- would she be able to tell if these people weren't human? The woman turns to Karen, smiles -- \nKaren surreptitiously fishes the \"vampire mace\" from her pocket, clutching it -- and now one of the men turns to look at her, nodding -- \nINT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY \nThe elevator doors open. Karen hurries out, heads left, finds herself in a deserted hallway. She looks back -- \n-- then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out! As Karen raises the canister of mace -- \n-- the trio turn and head down to the right. Karen breathes a sigh of relief, shakes her head. \nINT. KAREN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nKaren enters quickly, bolting the door behind her. She picks up the phone, dials 911 -- \nKAREN I need the police. This is an emergency -- \nAs Karen waits to be connected, she moves to the back entrance and checks the locks -- then the windows, then the fire escape -- finally, a VOICE comes on the other end. \nKAREN Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was with Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital last night -- that's right, I witnessed the attack -- (listening) 115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll wait here. Please hurry. \nKaren hangs up the phone and turns -- \nA SHAFT OF BRIGHT SUNLIGHT \nstreams in through a window. Karen forces herself to look at it and winces, shielding her eyes. Again, she brings a hand to the bandaged wound on her neck. She moves to the window, pulling the shade down, frightened. \nKAREN Get a grip on yourself, girl. \nShe sinks down into a chair to wait, setting Whistler's vampire mace aside. Then she shuts her eyes, massaging her temples. We SEE -- \nA BRIEF FLASH OF \nQuinn, his mouth opening wide, saliva dripping from his fangs. His pupils pulsating hypnotically. We rush into his gaping maw and -- \nWHAM! We're back to reality. Karen wakes with a start, looks to the windows -- time has passed, it's getting dark outside -- \n-- and someone is KNOCKING at the front door. Karen reaches for the vampire mace, then moves to the door. She looks through the peephole, cautious -- \nKAREN Who is it? \nKAREN'S POV (FISH-EYE) \nA POLICE OFFICER stands in the hallway -- 30s, handsome, a knight in shining armor as far as she's concerned. \n", "test2_true": "Karen visibly relaxes. She opens the door and steps aside, allowing Gideon to enter. \nKAREN Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen -- \nGideon smiles, takes a quick glance around the room, then studies Karen's face, the bandages on her neck. \nGIDEON Are you all right? (off Karen's nod) I'm glad you called, Ms. Jansen, we've been anxious to get a hold of you. You disappeared on us for a while. \nKAREN I know. Listen -- do you have any idea what happened to Curtis, the other doctor? \nGIDEON (matter of fact) Oh, he's dead. But I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. \nKAREN (alarmed) Why? \nGideon's smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun. \nGIDEON Because you're dead too. \nKaren GASPS. She has a half-second to act -- in which she triggers a spray of vampire mace into Gideon's face. Gideon stumbles back, blinded, cursing, rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes -- \nKaren expects pyrotechnics -- but the end result is little more than an annoyance. A second later, Gideon is simply blinking, sniffing his fingers, confused -- \nGIDEON Garlic? \nKAREN He said it would work against vampires -- \nGideon bursts out laughing. \nGIDEON Who said I was a vampire? \nGideon shakes his head, still snickering. He forces Karen against the wall, placing the gun against her head -- \nGIDEON Thanks for the laugh. You can shut your eyes if you want to. \nCRASH!!! The front door explodes open as Blade comes flying through it! \nGideon tries to bring his pistol up -- but Blade grips the man's hand and squeezes. Gideon SCREAMS as his bones snap like kindling. The pistol falls from his grasp -- \nBlade fires his fist into Gideon's gut again and again, then flings the officer across the room, sending him SMASHING into a glass-cased cabinet. Bleeding, battered, Gideon struggles to stand -- \nBlade is all over him, kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he sinks to the floor in a half-conscious haze. \nBlade stands over Gideon's limp form, fists clenched, breathing heavily, touching down after his adrenaline high. Finally, he looks to Karen -- \nBLADE You okay? \nKaren nods, glances at Gideon -- \nKAREN How did you know? \nBLADE Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up. \nKAREN You used me as bait?! \nBLADE It worked, didn't it? \nKAREN But, he could've -- \nBLADE He didn't. Get over it. \nBlade kneels next to Gideon. He turns the man's head, inspects the neck, the skin behind the ear -- \nKAREN But he's a policeman -- \nBLADE He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark? \nBlade pushes aside Gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol tattooed into the man's scalp. \nBLADE That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner -- (studying the glyph) This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now -- \nKAREN Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them? \nBLADE Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them. \nKAREN And that's a good thing? \nBLADE For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high. \n", "test2_id": 2098, "test3_input": "BLADE Yeah. I know. \nBlade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket. \nBLADE Thanks, Kam. (thinking) One other thing. Have you ever heard of a vampire called the Sleeper? \nKam shakes his head. Blade pulls out the parchment he took from Pearl. \nBLADE I found this in there archives. I need to find someone who can read their language. \nKam studies the parchment. \nKAM I've heard about a woman named Miracia. Some say she's a mayombero, a Santeria witch. Supposedly she lives in that tent community down by the city dump. I'm told she only sees people at night. \nBlade nods his thanks and heads back through the curtains. \nEXT. CHINATOWN, STREET - DAY \nBlade emerges from the alley into the sunlight, then hears his name WHISPERED on the wind. \nVOICE (o.s.) Blade. \nBlade spins, scanning his surroundings -- did he really hear his name, or was it just the wind? \nVOICE (o.s.) Blade. \nAgain, the taunting voice calls him. Blade's gaze finally settles on -- \nA MAN \nsitting on a bench in the deep shade, his face obscured by the Chinese newspaper he's reading. There's a LITTLE GIRL sitting stiffly beside the man -- a look of pure terror written on her face. \nMAN Afternoon, Blade. \nThe man lowers his newspaper. It's Deacon Frost. He's wearing sunglasses, but otherwise, he's seemingly unprotected by the sun. \nBlade reaches for his .454 -- \nFROST Easy. \nFrost's hand rests on the back of the girl's neck. We see his claws extend, caressing the flesh beneath her chin. \nFROST Wouldn't want our little friend here to wind up on the back of a milk carton, would we? \nBlade reluctantly lowers his hand. Frost smiles. He takes in a deep breath of air, savoring it. \nFROST Beautiful day, isn't it? \nBLADE (confused) How can you be out here? \nFROST I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things. \nOn closer examination we see that Frost is wearing a translucent lotion on his face. He touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of the lotion between his fingers. \nFROST It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, \"the Day-walker\". \nBLADE I don't buy it. \nFROST Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses. \nBLADE Maybe I don't see it that way. \nFROST Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been. \nBLADE You're wrong. \nFROST Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you. (pointedly) The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete. \nFrost watches the marketers stream past, sneering in contempt. \nFROST Look at them, just an endless stream of cattle in a mad race to the slaughterhouse. \nFrost lifts a silver flask to his mouth, taking a swig of blood. He smacks his lips, sighs contentedly -- \nFROST The pause that refreshes -- (offering it to Blade) Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron. \nBLADE Pass. \nFROST You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter. \n", "test3_true": "FROST Tell me honestly, do you really get the same rush from that pasteurized piss-serum of yours? (off Blade's look) You're surprised I know about your serum? You shouldn't be. I know everything about you. \nFrost leans forward, grinning. \nFROST You can't keep walking the razor's edge, Blade. The day will come -- and soon, when you'll have to choose between our kind and their's. If I were you, I'd take care not to wind up on the wrong end of the fang. \nA bead of sweat runs down Frost's neck, washing away a minute amount of the sun-blocking cream. The patch of exposed skin instantly blackens. Frost gazes upwards at the sun. \nFROST Love to continue this chat, but it appears I'm melting. \nFrost rises, taking the little girl by the hand. Blade follows, his hand resting on the butt of his Casull. \nBLADE You're not going anywhere. \nFROST (growling) Watch me. \nFrost's eyes flicker towards the street -- a CITY BUS is rumbling by. In a heartbeat, Frost hurls the little girl forward -- \n-- out into the path of the oncoming bus! \nBlade has a split-second to act. It's Frost or the girl -- and for a moment we actually think he's going to go for Frost -- \n-- but then he DIVES forward, scooping the girl into his arms, throwing themselves out of the bus' path. The bus misses them by a hair. By the time Blade looks up again -- \n-- Frost is gone. Blade rises, cursing, scanning the street as market-goers gather around him. \nWHIP PAN TO -- \nSOMEONE sitting astride a motorcycle, watching Blade from the roof of an elevated parking garage. The rider is clad from head to toe in a helmet and black leather -- Mercury. \nEXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY \nBlade's Olds cruises into the gated grounds. It zips down the ramp way into the loading elevator. \nBACK BY THE TRAIN TRACKS -- \nMercury's cycle rolls into frame. She picks up a radio handset and keys it. \nMERCURY (into radio) This is Mercury. Tell Deacon I've found their hiding place. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY \nBlade enters through the loading elevator, finding Karen and Whistler hard at work. She turns as he approaches -- SEES him back-lit by the sun. She looks pale, the whites of her eyes are streaked with red. \nBLADE Any progress? \nKAREN Some. It's been slow -- \nBLADE You don't look so good. \nKAREN I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night. \nBlade nods, not buying her explanation. He shoots a glance to Whistler, which doesn't go unnoticed by Karen. \nKAREN Excuse me. \nKaren turns, heading for the back of the workshop. \nINT. WORKSHOP - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nKaren enters a dingy bathroom, turning on the overhead bulb. She studies her reflection in the mirror above the sink, then grimaces as she peels the dressing from her wound -- the wound is clearly infected, gangrenous. \nBLADE (O.S.) It's started. \nKaren spins, startled. Blade stands behind her. He grips her jaw, turning her head so he can better view the wound. \nBLADE You've got another day or two at most. \nKaren nods, shaken. As she moves to leave, Blade reaches for her arm, stopping her. \nBLADE For what it's worth, I'm sorry. \nKAREN You make it sound like I'm already dead. \nBlade just stares at her. Finally, she pulls away. \n", "test3_id": 2099}

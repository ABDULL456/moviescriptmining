{"train": "BLADE - by David S. Goyer \nBLADE \nby \nDavid S. Goyer \nDarkness, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS. Presentation credits roll as we FADE UP ON: \nINT. HOSPITAL, INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - NIGHT \nIt's 1967, the Summer of Love and -- \nBOOM! Entry doors swing open as PARAMEDICS wheel in a FEMALE BLEEDER, VANESSA (20s, black, nine months pregnant). She's deathly pale, spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat -- \nA SHOCK-TRAUMA TEAM swarms over her, inserting a vacutainer into an artery to draw blood, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her arm -- \nNURSE #1 (with stethoscope) She's not breathing! \nSENIOR RESIDENT Intubate her! \nThe RESPIRATORY THERAPIST feeds an endotracheal tube down the woman's ruined throat, attaches that to an Amblu bag -- \nRESIDENT Blood-pressure's forty and falling -- \nThe woman starts spasming violently. It takes three staff members just to hold her down. \nSENIOR RESIDENT Jesus, her water's broken -- (calling for help) She's going into uterine contractions -- \nCAMERA PUSHES IN on the woman as she bolts upright, SCREAMING to wake the dead. We PLUNGE INTO the darkness of her mouth and find ourselves -- \nINSIDE HER BLOODSTREAM \nThe sound of a HEART BEATING, pounding as we whip-snake through -- \nCORPUSCLES \nfloating in amber plasma. Erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. \nThe rhythmic expansion of the artery walls, pulsing with each successive surge of blood as the HEART BEATS FASTER AND FASTER, taking us -- \nIN UTERO, \nA CHILD, alive but unborn, shifting in a sea of amniotic fluid, surrounded by the white, protective substance known as vernix caseosa. The HEARTBEAT races like a locomotive now. The unborn child shifts, turns its head towards us -- \n-- and opens its eyes. \nCUT TO: \nA SWORDBLADE \ncleaving the darkness, radiant light slicing across gleaming Damascus steel. Words acid-etched in the weapon's fine-tempered surface: \nBLADE \nMain credits end. \nEXT. INNER CITY, INDUSTRIAL GHETTO - NIGHT \nA decaying no man's land populated by condemned buildings and HUNGRY HOMELESS. Steam rises from manhole covers, drifting across the litter- lined streets. Suddenly -- \nA black Mercedes 850 appears over the crest of a hill, ROARING past us, stereo system belting out FILTER. \nINT. MERCEDES - NIGHT \nRaquel, a wasp-wasted woman, sits behind the wheel. 20s, rich, sickeningly attractive. Hungry eyes. \nSquirming around in the passenger seat is DENNIS, a model/actor boy- toy with a sub-zero IQ and a \"fuck me sideways\" grin. \nDENNIS So where we going? \nRAQUEL It's a surprise. \nDENNIS I likes surprises. \nRaquel eyeballs Dennis -- \"if looks could devour\". \nRAQUEL What do you have down there, little man? \n-- Mercury has fangs now too. In fact, everyone in the club does, with the exception of poor Dennis. That's because they're all vampires. \nDennis tries to run, but the burly Doorman blocks his exit, brutally smashing his fist into Dennis' face. \nDennis falls, dazed. The club-goers close in around him. They make a game of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces leering like twisted jack-o-lanterns. \nThe strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensity. Dennis spins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -- Dennis lands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up. A DARK FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. The figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt -- \nA BLACK MAN, \ntowers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of horror. His name is BLADE. \nBlade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an arsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body: \n6-point adjustable body armor, a modified CAR-15 assault rifle with an ultra-violet entry light, two Casull .454 revolvers, a \"Demon\" automatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of mahogany stakes, an Indian-style katar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his namesake -- a silver sword which is secured in a back-scabbard. \nCLOSE ON BLADE \nA gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers stare back. Nuclear silence. And then -- \nAll hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving at superhuman speed, practically a blur -- \nBlade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions -- \nMACRO BULLET SHOT \nas a round roars through the air towards Raquel. A silver-tipped dum- dum bullet which explodes on contact. \nWHAM! The round punches a fist-sized hole through Raquel's chest, continuing on into the vamp behind her! Vampire blood fountains. Both creatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of black oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains. \nBlade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He holsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on the UV entry light mounted above -- \nMERCURY \nleaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything move so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into the night just as -- \n-- a shaft of blinding UV \"sunlight\" cuts across the vampires. They rear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade opens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets into the crowd -- vampire genocide. \nThe strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes clogged with liquefying bodies -- \n-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their opening, surge forward en masse -- \nBlade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!- unsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip. \nTHE SWORD \nFour acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so sharp it could cleave a shadow in two. \nBlade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING VAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half -- \nON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB, \na LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword, sending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the vampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies. \nBeat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses -- \nSOMETHING BIG \nrising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward, cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb falls to the floor -- \n-- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into Blade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables, slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the ceiling. \nBlade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot- something nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head, jaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual scarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos. \nBlade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at bay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a stake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx. Quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. \nBlade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his leg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open, drawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES -- \nThe bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and nailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to pull out the stake -- \nBlade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm, effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board. \nUP ABOVE, \nmounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. Blade fires a cross-bow bolt straight into the lens. \nBlade strides over, placing his sword against Quinn's chest. \nBLADE Where is Deacon Frost? \nCURTIS What about the chemistry panel? \nKaren looks to Julie, who reaches for a computer print-out. \nJULIE Blood sugar level is three times the norm, phosphorous and uric acid are off the scales. (shrugs) Like the woman said, impossible. \nKaren removes her glasses, rubbing the bridge of her nose. \nKAREN Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes. \nCURTIS (insistent) It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask. \nKAREN I thought you promised to give me some distance? \nCURTIS This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear. \nKaren rolls her eyes, lets loose a tired sigh. \nKAREN Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about \"us\". \nCURTIS No problem. \nINT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - NIGHT \nThe dead of night, not a mouse in the house. Curtis and Karen, each garbed in a mask, stand on either side of Quinn's body, which now rests on the autopsy table. \nQUINN'S BODY \nA preliminary exploratory Y-incision has been made across the chest, stretching from shoulder to shoulder, then continuing on down the abdomen. Ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart and lungs. \nKAREN You haven't started in on the internal organs? \nCURTIS Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac. \nCurtis pauses, studying Quinn's disfigured face -- the features seem much less damaged now -- almost as if the corpse were healing itself. \nCURTIS That's weird -- \nKAREN What? \nCURTIS He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up -- \nCurtis pulls out a penlight, flicks it on. He leans over Quinn, shining the light into one of his eyes. \nCURTIS Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us? \nKAREN (grudgingly) Sometimes -- \nCurtis looks up from the corpse, grinning beneath his mask. \nKAREN -- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality. \nCURTIS Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here -- \nQuinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs into Curtis' jugular. He snaps the man's neck in two for easier access, sucking in blood like a living vacuum. \nKaren stumbles backwards, sending autopsy tools CLATTERING. \nQUINN \nrises from the table, flinging Curtis' twitching body aside. He curls his blood-soaked lips back, baring viper-like fangs, emitting a GUTTURAL GROWL -- \nQUINN (crazed by thirst) -- more -- blood -- \nKaren backs into the corpse drawers, but Quinn is upon her in a half- second, wrapping a hand about her throat. His mouth opens/morphs disturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole, caustic saliva dripping from his canines -- \nKaren tries to turn her head away, but Quinn's grip is vise-like. She finds herself staring into his eyes -- pupils pulsing rapid-fire, opening and closing, hypnotic -- \nAs Quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into Karen's carotid artery and starts to nurse -- \nBANG!!! A load of MAHOGANY buckshot chews into Quinn's side. He HOWLS in pain. Another load catches him full in the face. He drops Karen. She falls to the floor -- \nKAREN'S POV \nThe sound of RUSHING BLOOD pounding through her skull. Everything spinning. She struggles to move, turns her head, finds herself eye to eye with Curtis' corpse. \nON QUINN \nrising, his face torn up, smoking. WHIP PAN TO -- \nA gate grinds open. \nWe follow the Olds as it cruises around the back of the building, heading down a concrete loading ramp. At the bottom of the ramp, a heavy iron door rises. Blade's Olds disappears into the darkness. \nINT. ABANDONED FACTORY, INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nMore UV lights flicker on. We're in a massive loading elevator which HUMS as it ascends, eventually reaching its destination with a BOOMING CLANG. The doors at the rear glide open. Blade guides the Olds out. \nINT. ABANDONED FACTORY, WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nSet up in an old ironworks, the place looks like a cross between an auto junkyard and an armory. Equipment is strewn everywhere -- lathes, mills, old furnaces, gutted vehicles, an ad hoc surgical theater -- all of it jerry-rigged in a brutal, oily-tech. \nBlade climbs out of the Olds. He opens the passenger door and pulls Karen out, carries her in his arms. \nBLADE Whistler! \nWHISTLER (O.S.) Are we bringing home strays now? \nABRAHAM WHISTLER (60s) \nhobbles out of the shadows, leaning heavily on a cane. Gimlet-eyed, bitter, his right leg encased in a metal brace. Though his face is lined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray, we sense he could kick the living shit out of any man half his age. \nBLADE She's been bitten. \nWHISTLER You should've killed her, then. \nBLADE She hasn't turned yet. (pointedly) You can help her. \nBlade and Whistler stare each other down. Finally, Whistler turns and heads over to the operating theater. \nWHISTLER No promises. You watch her close. She starts to turn, you finish her off. \nBlade nods, lays Karen down on the operating table. Whistler turns on an overhead light. Karen is sheathed in sweat, ashen. She's lost a lot of blood. \nWhistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves, probes the wound in Karen's neck with an antiseptic swab -- there's capillary damage around the perimeter of the wound, the tissue looks bruised, gangrenous. \nWHISTLER Localized necrosis. She's borderline. Another hour and she'd be well into the change. \nWhistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under Karen's nose. As she starts to stir -- \nWHISTLER Can you hear me, woman? \nKaren's eyes open wide. She's scared, disoriented -- \nKAREN What -- ? \nWHISTLER You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite -- \nWhistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with caustic-looking fluid. Karen sees the syringe, resists -- \nWHISTLER Hold her. \nBlade forces Karen back. Whistler readies the syringe. \nWHISTLER (reading her name tag) \"Dr. Karen Jansen\". Listen close, I'm going to inject you with an antidote made from allium setivum -- garlic. This is going to hurt. A lot. \nWhistler sinks the needle into Karen's neck and depresses the plunger. \"Hurt\" doesn't begin to describe what Karen experiences next. Imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid through your veins. \nKaren SHRIEKS, her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms. The wound on her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous vampire venom. \nKaren clutches at Blade's arms, digging her nails in. She stares up at him with unflinching intensity, like a child desperately searching for assurance. \nON BLADE, \nuncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid. He'd like nothing more than to be done with this, but the only thing he can do is hold Karen while she rides out the seizures. \nKAREN'S POV \ngrowing darker by the moment. The last thing she sees is Blade staring down at her -- then the night closes in. \nINT. HOUSE OF EREBUS, MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON a monitor featuring footage taken at the vampire club massacre. Blade turns and stares into the camera, fires his cross- bow. The screen cuts to static. \nA WITHERED, CLAWED HAND \nmoves into frame, holding a remote. With a tap of a button, the monitor goes dark. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL a large, minimalist conference room -- the House of Erebus, seat of the vampire race's legislative assembly. \nstrapped into some kind of Inquisition-esque restraint chair. His shirt is off, his body slick with sweat. Whistler finishes strapping Blade in, then stands back, holding up a gas-powered pistol injector, hesitant -- \nWHISTLER I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum -- \nBLADE (impatient) Just do it, old man. \nWhistler nods, fitting Blade with a bite guard. Then he presses the pistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery. \nBlade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard, veins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his credit, Whistler never lets go. \nMentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs its violent course. We understand that these shared moments, oddly private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire hunters together. Finally, Blade slumps forward in his restraints, exhausted. \nKAREN \nShe draws back, instinctively knowing that she's just witnessed something she shouldn't have. She looks for an exit, SEES another doorway. She makes for it -- \nINT. WHISTLER'S LAB - TANK ROOM - DAY \nA dusty, darkened hole of a room, no windows, just shadows, crumbling concrete, rust stains, and -- \nA LARGE TANK \nfilled with swirling blood plasma, choked with electrical leads and biomedical sensors. SOMETHING floats within, suspended in the murky fluid -- a child , two or three years of age, drifting about like a medical oddity preserved in formaldehyde -- \nTHUMP! The child SLAMS up against the glass. Karen backpedals, startled. Its eyes are open now, pupils blown. It snarls, revealing a mouthful of razored fangs, trailing mouth-slime across the glass as it futilely tries to chew its way through to Karen. \nKaren stifles a sob, turning and running right into -- \nBLADE, \nwho now blocks the exit, sword in hand. Karen retreats a step, wary -- \nBLADE You shouldn't be here. \nKAREN I'm sorry, I -- \nWHISTLER (O.S.) Wandered off the beaten path, Doctor? \nWhistler has entered the room from a second doorway. Karen looks from Whistler to Blade, trapped between them -- \nKAREN Who are you people? \nWHISTLER My name is Abraham Whistler. (re: Blade) This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here -- \nWhistler limps over to the tank, rapping his cane against it. The creature snaps at it reflexively, following the silver tip back and forth like a fish after a lure. \nBLADE -- he's a vampire. \nKAREN You're joking -- \nWHISTLER Not at all. You're looking at a prime specimen of the homines nocturna. \nWhistler toys with the feral creature, engaging in a certain amount of sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied. Suddenly, it surges towards the top of the tank, clawing at the lid -- \nKaren becomes alarmed -- but then a massive ELECTRICAL JOLT shocks the creature back into submission. \nWHISTLER If Blade hadn't brought you here, you would've wound up like him. \nKaren brings a hand to her bandaged neck, recalling the events of the previous night. She looks to Blade. \nKAREN Why did you help me? \nBlade scowls, his gaze flickering to Whistler. \nBLADE Stupidity. \nWHISTLER (appraising her) Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy. \nBLADE It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her. \nKAREN Why? \nBLADE Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us. \nKAREN What happens then? \nBlade looks to Whistler -- as far as he's concerned, the debate's over. \nBLADE Then I have to take you out, just like any other bloodsucker. \nJust then, Gideon MOANS. Blade drags the man up so they're eye to eye. \nBLADE How 'bout you, Officer? You a good little bloodhound? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK \nBlade and Karen are now standing by Gideon's police cruiser which is parked outside Karen's apartment. Blade shoves Gideon against the hood of the cruiser. He finds Gideon's keys, moves to the trunk, opens it -- \nIN THE TRUNK -- \nA sophisticated medical cooling unit for transporting organs. Blade opens the unit, coolant vapor hisses out. Inside are plastic bags containing blood. \nBLADE Looks like our friend was blood-running. (to Gideon) Where were you headed? \nGideon mumbles through a split lip and chipped teeth -- \nGIDEON Mphuck you -- \nWHAM! Blade plants Gideon's face into the hood of the car. Gideon GROANS, coughs -- \nGIDEON Jesus -- 1227 Brookner -- Holliston Clinic -- \nBlade releases him, then reaches for his Casull. \nKAREN What are you doing?! \nBLADE Preventive medicine. \nKaren steps in front of Blade, shielding Gideon. \nKAREN You can't do this, he's human, it's murder. \nBLADE It's war, now get the fuck out of the way! \nKaren grabs Blade's arm, wrestling with him, trying to push his hand away. As the two of them struggle, Gideon makes a break for it, stumbling across the lawn. Blade pushes Karen aside, takes aim, FIRES -- \n-- but Gideon ducks into an alley, disappearing from sight. Blade spins on Karen, enraged -- \nBLADE God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea what you just did?! He'll warn them. They'll be waiting! \nBut Karen's defiant, she's not backing down. \nKAREN You were going to kill him. What was I supposed to do?! Shut my eyes and pretend I didn't see what I saw? \nBlade tears off his glasses. Karen gasps -- \nBLADE'S EYES \naren't human, nor are they vampire. They're something else -- emerald green, laced with swirling flecks of red. \nBLADE Let me set you straight on something, Doctor. What you've \"seen\" so far is nothing. The world you live in's just the sugar-coated topping. There's another world beneath it, the real world -- and it's a fucking bloodbath. If you want to survive in it, you'd better pull your head out of your ass. \nBlade slips his glasses back on, leaving Karen shocked into silence. He heads for his Olds without looking back, climbs in, guns the engine. In seconds, he's gone, tearing off down the street in a cloud of exhaust. \nEXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - DUSK \nWe are soaring through the air above the gleaming city skyline, moving towards the Edgewood Towers whose windows reflect the blood- red sinking sun. \nINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT \nSuffused lighting, elegant tile-work featuring evocative mosaics, the quiet strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC -- \nMERCURY, \nthe lupine Gaultier girl from the club, glides beneath the water, surfacing at the deep end. We SEE -- \nFROST \nlounging in a chair, studying a laptop which rests beside him. On the screen is a digitized image -- a page taken from an ancient manuscript, written in a secret tongue. \nOfficer Gideon waits nearby, cradling his ruined hand, his battered face cast downward like a boy who's been called into the Principal's office. \nGIDEON Look, I know you're disappointed -- \nFROST Crestfallen. \nGIDEON Blade was waiting for me. There wasn't anything I could do. \nyour basic inner-city blood-barter establishment where desperate transients parley their plasma into cash. \nKAREN (recognizing it) I know this place -- it's a blood bank. \nBLADE Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver. (looking to Karen) You telling me you're ready to walk through that door? \nKaren nods. Blade continues to stare at her, taking her measure -- there's a strength in this woman's eyes, she has the soul of a fighter -- and Blade recognizes it. \nBLADE All right, then, listen up, Vampire Anatomy 101. Crosses and running water don't do dick, so forget what you've seen in the movies. \nBlade enumerates the following on his fingers: \nBLADE You use the stake, silver, or sunlight, got it? \nBlade holds up one of his Casulls. \nBLADE Know how to use one of these? \nKaren takes the weapon from him, eyes all over it. \nKAREN No. \nBlade takes the gun back, snorting derisively. \nBLADE Safety's off, round's already chambered -- (cocking it) Silver hollow-points filled with garlic. You aim for the heart or the head, anything else is a one-way ticket to a pine box. \nBlade hand it to her again, then starts across the street towards the clinic. Karen follows -- \nINT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, LOBBY - NIGHT \nBlade enters, swinging his rifle around for all to see. \nBLADE Get out. Now. \nThe POTENTIAL DONORS scramble for the exit. Behind the counter, TANAKA, a male nurse, reaches for an alarm button. Blade vaults over the counter, aiming his rifle. \nBLADE I know you're blood-running. Who's your sponsor? \nTANAKA I don't know what you're -- \nPOW! Blade backhands him across the face hard enough to loosen his teeth. Karen flinches, stepping forward -- \nKAREN What if you've made a mistake? \nBlade pins Tanaka's head to the wall, turning it to the side -- revealing the man's glyph. It's different than Gideon's, looking more like a Japanese kanji character. \nBLADE What's this? A birthmark? \nBlade grips Tanaka by his collar, shoving him through a doorway -- \nINT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT \nKaren and Blade SEE supply cabinets, cots, a number of locked refrigeration units. Blade FIRES into the door handle of one of the units, tears it open -- the fridge is stacked floor to ceiling with plastic packets of blood. \nBLADE (to Karen) Still think we might be wrong? (to Tanaka) How much are you shipping? \nTANAKA Bite me! \nBlade opens FIRE, sweeping his rifle around the room, shooting everything in sight. Glass cabinetry shatters, ampoules and vacutainers go flying. Tanaka cowers, arms wrapped about his head. \nBlade stops shooting. He leans down towards Tanaka, placing the end of his rifle against the man's forehead. Tanaka looks like he's about to wet his pants. \nBLADE I've got a message for your masters -- the night's no longer safe for their kind. \nBlade pulls back his rifle, leaving a red indentation mark where the end of the rifle barrel pressed into Tanaka's skin. He starts towards the exit. Karen follows. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT \nBlade and Karen return to the Olds. He keys the ignition, lets the engine idle. They're parked down the street from the blood clinic. Karen looks to Blade, confused -- \nKAREN You let him go -- (off Blade's nod) An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk. \nBLADE He will. \nBlade points -- \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- \nON THE STRIPPER \nas she catches sight of Blade and freezes in mid-routine. The stripper pulls off her hood. Long black hair with a streak of white tumbles down her back -- it's Mercury. \nINT. BLACK PEARL, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nBlade and Karen head past the bathrooms. At the end of the hall is a door marked \"OFFICE\". Just then, the Men's door opens, a DRUNK COLLEGE KID steps out, SEES Blade -- \nKID Hey -- \nBlade plants a hand over the kid's face, shoving him back into the bathroom as he kicks open the office door -- \nINT. THE BLACK PEARL, BACK OFFICE - NIGHT \nTanaka spins around, startled, tries to throw a punch -- \nBlade traps Tanaka's arm, levering the man up and over. He CRASHES into a shelving unit, taking the whole thing down with him. Karen winces. Blade grabs a handful of Tanaka's hair, yanks his head up -- \nBLADE Where's the entrance?! \nTANAKA I can't -- they'll kill me! \nBlade rips off his glasses and gives Tanaka an eyeful -- his irises pulse and glow. \nBLADE I got news for you, butt-boy. You're already dead. \nTANAKA (terrified) Oh God, shit -- behind the bookcase -- \nBlade drops Tanaka, moves to the bookcase. He searches the wall a moment, then finds a trigger. Hits it -- the bookcase slides aside, revealing a hidden elevator. As Blade moves to put his sunglasses back on -- \nBLADE'S POV (IN THE REFLECTION OF HIS SUNGLASSES) \nWe see Tanaka behind him, pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer, swinging it up -- \nBlade unholsters one of his Casulls faster than any gunslinger in history. He FIRES over his own shoulder, BLOWING Tanaka back against the wall. \nBlade puts his sunglasses back on, motions to the elevator, then nods to Karen -- \nBLADE After you. \nINT. THE BLACK PEARL, ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nThe elevator descends. Then a tone CHIMES, signaling the end of the ride. The doors hiss open -- \nINT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nBlade and Karen enter the narrow, maze-like \"stacks\" of the vampire archives, weaving their way through shelves of climate-controlled, digitized records. \nKAREN What is this place? \nBLADE Some kind of archive -- \nKAREN Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins. \nBLADE You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown. \nBlade pulls a CD-ROM from the shelves, its spine labeled in indecipherable vampire glyphs. \nBLADE This must be where they keep their records -- \nHe pauses, hearing a DISTANT WHISPER. Blade signals quiet, silently leading Karen through the stacks towards -- \nPEARL'S LAIR \nA vestibule of sorts, leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of rice paper shoji screens and tatami mats. Candles glow within, illuminating a MONSTROUSLY OBESE SHADOW beyond the translucent rice paper walls. \nThe shadow speaks in a tremulous, bird-like voice -- the secret tongue. As Blade draws his sword, the massive shadow freezes -- \nPEARL'S VOICE (frightened) Lorca, is that you? \nBlade slides open the nearest shoji screen -- \nINT. PEARL'S BED CHAMBER - NIGHT \nNothing Karen's seen up until this point could prepare her for the archive's curator -- \nPEARL, \na nine-hundred-pound androgynous vampire of Asian origin, lounging amidst pillowed rice mats, wearing a communications headset. Think of a cross between Divine and Jabba The Hutt. Skin the complexion of buttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood that he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin. \nEnraged, Pearl LUNGES from his bed. Karen triggers the UV rig, flash- frying him to a blackened crisp. Pearl quivers, his enormous body smoking like a piece of charred meat. \nBlade looks back at Karen with newfound respect. She shrugs. \nKAREN He moved. \nBlade turns back to the vault, setting off the charge. BOOM! Blade kicks the damaged door in, knocking it clear off its hinges -- \nINSIDE THE VAULT, \nancient papers flutter through the smoky air like wind-borne leaves. Blade and Karen SEE a lucite-encased document -- fragments of an ancient, calligraphied papyrus. \nKAREN What are these? \nQUINN (o.s.) Curiosity killed the cat. \nBlade and Karen spin -- \n-- QUINN, \nMercury, and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the vault. \nQUINN (grins) Hola, amigo. Remember me? \nKaren triggers the UV light, but Mercury ducks under it, ripping it from her hands, crushing it. In a split-second, the she-demon has her claws around Karen's throat. \nAs Blade reaches for his rifle, the vampires converge on him like quicksilver. They drag Karen and Blade out -- \nPEARL'S BEDCHAMBER \nThe vampires fling Blade against the wall, pinning him. \nQUINN You took my arm, Blade. But that's okay, I'm growing a new one -- \nQuinn lifts up his \"arm\". A skeletal forearm has grown from the stump. It's got cartilage, sinew, and muscle, but no flesh yet. \nQUINN Nice, huh? Think I'll ever play the piano again? (shrugging) You can slice him, you can dice him, and the man just keeps on coming. \nBlade struggles violently, but Quinn is upon him, pounding his fist into Blade again and again and again -- giving him payback with compounded interest. When it's over, Quinn steps back, winded -- \nBlade's head hangs down. He gasps, wincing, every breath sending a red hot poker to his gut. Quinn grabs a hold of Blade's jaw, forcing his head up. \nQUINN Stay with me, sweetness, I'm not through with you yet. \nQuinn pulls Blade's jacket open, sees the bandoleer of mahogany stakes. He tugs one out, admiring it. \nQUINN Teak. Nice craftsmanship. (to the others) Now here's a man who takes his job just a little too seriously, don't you think? (back to Blade) Which reminds me, Blade, think I owe you one -- \nQuinn stabs the stake into Blade's shoulder. Blade CRIES OUT, tries to pull free. Karen, who's being held by Mercury, averts her gaze. \nQUINN Actually, if you want to get technical, I owe you two. \nAs Quinn reaches for another stake, Blade starts to laugh. \nQUINN What's so funny, bright eyes? \nBLADE I'm expecting some company. \nIt's then that Quinn notices the micro ear-coil radio receiver in Blade's ear. As we MOVE IN on it, we hear a tiny VOICE squawking from it: \nVOICE (filtered) Get down! \nBlade kicks his feet out, sending Quinn flying backwards. He tears free of the vamps holding him and DIVES forward, knocking Karen to the ground just as -- \nBOOM!!! The wall of Pearl's bedchamber EXPLODES INWARD, knocking Quinn and the rest of his cronies to their feet. \nWHISTLER \nstands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be, brandishing his cane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other. He balances the rifle against his hip like an over-the-hill gunslinger and OPENS FIRE on the vampires. \nBlade rolls, snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown free from the vault. Seconds later, he and Karen are fleeing after Whistler, retreating back through his newly created exit. \nINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT \nThe three of them find themselves ankle-deep in a flooded sewer tunnel running parallel to the archives. Whistler pauses, wheezing from overexertion. \nWHISTLER Christ, I'm too old for this. Somebody get me a goddamn wheelchair. \nBlade leans against the tunnel wall, GRUNTING as he yanks the stake from his shoulder. He then pulls out a light-stick, snapping it, illuminating the area in a GREEN GLOW -- disturbing waves of GLITTERING COCKROACHES. \nKAREN What am I injecting you with? \nBLADE (weakly) Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute. \nKaren locates a vein, presses the injector against it -- Blade tenses, grits his teeth, fights to keep his body thrashing as the serum enters his bloodstream. He grips the wall behind him -- actually digs his nails into the metal surface -- the agony he's going through is excruciating, like nothing we could imagine. \nWhen it's over, he slumps forward, spent, vulnerable, flushed with sweat. Karen stares at him -- \nKAREN You're one of them, aren't you? \nBlade turns away from Karen, filled with self-loathing. \nBLADE Not quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human, half-vampire. \nOff Karen's surprised reaction, we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nThe loading elevator CLANGS to a stop. Blade throws the gate open. Karen helps him out. Now that they're safely back, the last of Blade's strength seems to dissipate. \nWHISTLER \nis waiting for them, sitting at a workbench. \nWHISTLER What took you so long? \nBLADE Don't even start, old man. \nBlade throws his sword aside, then moves off into the shadows, disappearing beyond the curtains. Karen looks to Whistler -- \nKAREN Why didn't you tell me the truth about him? \nWHISTLER We weren't sure we could trust you. \nWhistler sighs, removing his glasses. \nWHISTLER Blade's mother was attacked by a vampire while she was pregnant. Ultimately, she died, but her unborn child lived. Unfortunately, he'd undergone certain genetic changes while in the womb -- \nWhistler reaches for a pack of cigarettes, pulls one out. He thumbs a match, fires up. Takes a long drag -- \nWHISTLER I found Blade when he was thirteen. He'd been living on the streets, feeding off the homeless. Apparently the Thirst manifested itself at puberty -- (beat) I took him for one of them at first, almost killed him, too. But then I realized what he was. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nFrost stands at the window, looking out at the glimmering cityscape before him. \nINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nFrost turns away from window. Quinn, Mercury, and the other vampires from the Black Pearl stand before him. Quinn cradles his amputated stump with his newly grown arm. \nQUINN He took my fucking hand! Again! \nFROST You seem to be in the habit of losing them fairly often, Quinn. Maybe the amputee lifestyle just suits you. \nThe other vampires laugh. Quinn stares them into silence. \nQUINN We need to find him, tonight. \nFrost claps a hand on Quinn's shoulder. \nFROST Down, boy. Blade's not going anywhere. I promise. Right now, though, we've more pressing business -- (off Mercury's look) It's time Dragonetti paid the piper. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nWhistler studies Karen, exhaling another lungful of smoke. \nWHISTLER Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst. \nKAREN What happens if he doesn't take the serum? \nWHISTLER The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control. (sighs) The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure -- \nKAREN No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something. \nFADE IN on Dragonetti, his face covered with a black condemned man's hood -- \nFrost stands before him, grinning like the Cheshire Cat. He's dressed from head to toe in a black motorcycle suit -- boots, gloves, a visored helmet tucked under one arm. Mercury and Quinn are standing nearby, similarly attired. \nWe're on a stretch of rocky coastline, tucked away in a secluded cove. Dragonetti has been stripped bare, chained like Prometheus to an ancient standing stone. \nDRAGONETTI (straining) What is this? Where am I?! \nFrost steps forward, pulling Dragonetti's hood off. Dragonetti stares at his surroundings, horrified. \nFROST When was the last time you stopped to appreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti? Three, four hundred years? \nFrost checks his watch, then looks to the ocean. On the horizon, a sliver of gold appears. \nFROST How do you like that? Right on time. \nDRAGONETTI (snarling) The other elders will never let you get away with this! \nJust then, the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS emerge behind Frost, forming a circle around Dragonetti. All wear business suits, gloves, along with high-tech \"sun masks\" to protect their faces from the light's lethal rays. \nThey stare at Dragonetti like a silent jury. His face darkens, anger rising -- but there's a desperation in his eyes now too. He speaks in the secret tongue: \nDRAGONETTI (subtitled) Don't you see, you fools?! He'll betray you too! He's planning on invoking LaMagra himself! \nThe vampires just smile and shake their heads. \nFROST The wheel turns, old fang. Guess you just got a little too long in the tooth. \nDragonetti's cries are cut short as Frost forces the aging vampire's mouth open, ripping out his fangs with his bare hands. Dragonetti GURGLES and SHRIEKS, sounding like a dying animal. \nFrost turns to face the Twelve now, his eyes bright with victory. He pulls on his motorcycle helmet, as do Mercury and Quinn. \nBehind them, Dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no avail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him, channeled inward by the natural formation of the cove -- \nDragonetti HOWLS, his skin beginning sizzle and smoke. Then he catches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass. He thrashes about as his flesh starts to run from his body. \nTHE VAMPIRE ELDERS \nwatch, impassive, protected by their masks -- \n-- when suddenly, TWELVE FIGURES rise up behind them, clad in bike helmets and black leather, just like Frost. The intruders grip each of the Elders in a strangle hold, ripping their masks off. \nFROST Dragonetti was right. You were fools to trust me. \nFrost flips down the visor of his helmet even as -- \nTHE RED SUN \nrises in all its fiery glory. \nOne by one, the vampire Elder's heads catch fire, skullflesh sizzling away -- burning down the line of them in successively building intensity until all twelve EXPLODE in a conflagration of BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. \nFrost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer intensity of the occult blast -- a blast which sends the skeletal bodies of the Elders SLAMMING into the rock wall. \nWhen it's over, Frost picks himself back up. We SEE that the only thing left of Dragonetti and the others are -- \nTHIRTEEN SHADOW SILHOUETTES \npermanently etched onto the rock's surface, just like the bombing victims of Hiroshima. \nINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY \nKaren stands at a lab table with Whistler, preparing a number of blood sample vials. They are surrounded by host of new medical equipment -- from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond. \nBlade emerges from his room, looks to Karen. As if by silent agreement, last night's words go unacknowledged. He straps on his bandoleer of stakes, secures his scabbard. \nWHISTLER Going somewhere? \nBLADE China Town. I need more serum. (re: new equipment) What's all this? \nKAREN I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment. \nBLADE (sarcastic) For your miracle cure? \nWHISTLER She's been making real progress, Blade. (to Karen) Show him -- \nKaren looks to Blade, who shrugs. She opens a refrigerator, removing a syringe filled with blue fluid. \nKAREN This is sodium citrate. It's an anti-coagulant. We use it to treat blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood is thinner than humans, though. Watch what happens when I introduce some into a sample -- \nBLADE Yeah. I know. \nBlade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket. \nBLADE Thanks, Kam. (thinking) One other thing. Have you ever heard of a vampire called the Sleeper? \nKam shakes his head. Blade pulls out the parchment he took from Pearl. \nBLADE I found this in there archives. I need to find someone who can read their language. \nKam studies the parchment. \nKAM I've heard about a woman named Miracia. Some say she's a mayombero, a Santeria witch. Supposedly she lives in that tent community down by the city dump. I'm told she only sees people at night. \nBlade nods his thanks and heads back through the curtains. \nEXT. CHINATOWN, STREET - DAY \nBlade emerges from the alley into the sunlight, then hears his name WHISPERED on the wind. \nVOICE (o.s.) Blade. \nBlade spins, scanning his surroundings -- did he really hear his name, or was it just the wind? \nVOICE (o.s.) Blade. \nAgain, the taunting voice calls him. Blade's gaze finally settles on -- \nA MAN \nsitting on a bench in the deep shade, his face obscured by the Chinese newspaper he's reading. There's a LITTLE GIRL sitting stiffly beside the man -- a look of pure terror written on her face. \nMAN Afternoon, Blade. \nThe man lowers his newspaper. It's Deacon Frost. He's wearing sunglasses, but otherwise, he's seemingly unprotected by the sun. \nBlade reaches for his .454 -- \nFROST Easy. \nFrost's hand rests on the back of the girl's neck. We see his claws extend, caressing the flesh beneath her chin. \nFROST Wouldn't want our little friend here to wind up on the back of a milk carton, would we? \nBlade reluctantly lowers his hand. Frost smiles. He takes in a deep breath of air, savoring it. \nFROST Beautiful day, isn't it? \nBLADE (confused) How can you be out here? \nFROST I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things. \nOn closer examination we see that Frost is wearing a translucent lotion on his face. He touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of the lotion between his fingers. \nFROST It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, \"the Day-walker\". \nBLADE I don't buy it. \nFROST Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses. \nBLADE Maybe I don't see it that way. \nFROST Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been. \nBLADE You're wrong. \nFROST Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you. (pointedly) The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete. \nFrost watches the marketers stream past, sneering in contempt. \nFROST Look at them, just an endless stream of cattle in a mad race to the slaughterhouse. \nFrost lifts a silver flask to his mouth, taking a swig of blood. He smacks his lips, sighs contentedly -- \nFROST The pause that refreshes -- (offering it to Blade) Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron. \nBLADE Pass. \nFROST You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter. \nEXT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DUSK \nCLOSE ON Karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows, watching the sun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - DUSK \nWindy. Urban desolation. Blade stands on the perimeter of a sprawling cardboard and plywood squatter's ghetto which has sprung up around the city dump. CHILDREN and DOGS forage for salvageable items, while in the distance, dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse. \nMOMENTS LATER, \nBlade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and ashcan fires. A CROWD quickly closes in around him, suspicious. A BRUTISH MAN steps forward, challenging him -- \nMAN Extranjero. \u00bfQuien es? \nBLADE I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me. \nThe man turns to his fellow squatters, WHISPERING. After a heated debate, a GAUNT WOMAN steps forward, motioning -- \nWOMAN This way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nWhistler and Karen sit at a work table. Karen is looking at a blood smear slide through a microscope. \nKAREN All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood? \nWHISTLER Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin. \nKAREN Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia? \nWhistler nods. \nKAREN So what about gene therapy? \nWhistler looks intrigued. Karen continues. \nKAREN Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin. \nWHISTLER How? \nKAREN With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia. \nWhistler can hardly believe what he's hearing. \nWHISTLER You're serious? You actually think this could work? \nKaren pauses -- we can see in her expression that there's something she's been holding back. \nKAREN On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure -- (gravely) The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him. \nWHISTLER Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins. \nAt that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out. Karen looks around the room, alarmed. \nKAREN What happened to the power? \nWHISTLER (concerned) I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in. \nA few seconds pass. The back-up generator still hasn't activated. Whistler moves to the window -- \nWHISTLER UV floodlights are down too. \nAs Whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of GLASS SHATTERING coming from the other end of the workshop. Whistler shines the flashlight in that direction. We hear more sounds now -- water draining, glass tinkling. \nWhistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. He edges towards the black-out curtains, Karen falling in behind him. \nINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - TANK ROOM - NIGHT \nWhistler and Karen enter, cautious -- \nTHE TANK \ncontaining the vampire child has been smashed open. It's empty now, with just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a widening pool -- and a trail of tiny BLOODY FOOTPRINTS leading back out into the main workshop. \nINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nBLADE Who is LaMagra? \nMIRACIA The vampire God. This speaks of His return. \nMiracia's fingers search the parchment again. \nMIRACIA \"-- there will come a Day Walker.\" (reading) \"His blood will call the Sleeper from beyond the Veil of Tears.\" \nBlade stares at Miracia, shaken. \nBLADE His blood -- ? \nThe old woman nods, reaching for a smoldering cigarette. \nMIRACIA The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him. (reading) \"And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood.\" \nBLADE (recalling the phrase) \"The Blood Tide\". \nMIRACIA (nodding) Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst. \nBLADE How do I stop it? \nMiracia shrugs, spreading her hands. \nMIRACIA The Great Wheel turns, my friend. The Dark is rising. How would you fight a shadow? \nMiracia sits back, slumping into her chair. The candles have burnt themselves down to nothing. \nMIRACIA I am tired. Dawn is coming. \nBLADE But I just got here -- \nMIRACIA You've been here longer than you think. \nBlade rises, looking to the horizon. Incredibly, dawn is coming. As he stands there, mystified, the wind picks up, sweeping the parchment fragment out of his hand. He tries to snatch it back, but the fragment is quickly borne away. He watches it disappear into the sky, then turns back -- \nMiracia is gone. Blade glances around him, but she's nowhere to be found. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK, \nisolating Blade amidst the ghostly squalor. From our vantage point, he looks like any other homeless phantom. \nINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAWN \nBlade steps out from the elevator into the workshop -- \nThe place has been trashed. It looks like a tornado touched down in his absence. Blade pulls out one of his .454s, cautious -- \nBLADE WHISTLER?! \n-- and then he stops dead in his tracks. \nWHISTLER \nhas been strung up by his arms against the far wall, tortured and left for dead. In response to Blade's voice, a MOAN escapes the dying man's lips. \nBlade rushes to the wall, cutting Whistler down with his sword, gently lowering him to the floor. As he cradles the old man in his arms, Blade sees the primary wound -- two ragged puncture marks along Whistler's throat. \nBLADE Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to you? \nWhistler opens his eyes, struggling to speak -- \nWHISTLER Frost took her -- \nWhistler spasms and coughs, wincing from the pain. \nBLADE Don't try to talk -- \nWHISTLER Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back. \nBLADE No, we can treat the wounds -- \nBut Whistler is shaking his hand. \nWHISTLER Too far gone, you know that. \nBlade's at a complete loss. \nBLADE Whistler, I can't. \nBLADE What are you talking about? \nKaren forces herself to meet his gaze. \nKAREN Your condition's congenital, the genetic mutations occurred in utero. All the other victims contracted vampirism after birth. \nBlade stares at Karen, disbelieving. Who could imagine a more horrifying irony? She's crying now. She can't help it. \nKAREN I can't cure you, Blade. I can cure myself, but I can't cure you. (beat) I'm so sorry. \nBlade's head sinks, the last vestiges of hope draining out of him. \nAnd then, as if the final stake were being pounded in, the truck lurches to a stop. We hear the ENGINE being killed, then FOOTSTEPS approaching, and then a series of BOLTS BEING SHIFTED as -- \n-- the back of the truck is thrown open. Frost stands there, grinning, flanked by Mercury, Quinn, Vanessa, and a half-dozen other VAMPIRE ASSOCIATES. \nFROST Welcome home, children. \nEXT. THE BANK OF EREBUS - NIGHT \nBlade and Karen are dragged from the back of the truck, which is revealed now to be an armored car. \nTHE BANK OF EREBUS \nrises up before them. A towering beaux-arts edifice situated in the heart of the city's high-priced financial district -- one of the many institutions owned and operated by the vampire enclave. \nFrost starts up the marble steps towards a grand, triple-arched entrance flanked by Corinthian columns. Karen and Blade are dragged along after him. \nINT. BANK OF EREBUS - ATRIUM - NIGHT \nFrost leads his vampires into a high-ceilinged atrium, moving towards a bank of elevators -- one of the doors of which is outfitted with a high-tech hand-key ID system. \nFrost places his palm on the ID screen. The screen GLOWS GREEN, acknowledging his identity. In response, the doors HISS open. \nINT. SECURITY ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nBlade and Karen are pulled inside the elevator. The control panel buttons have vampire glyphs, rather than numbers. Frost presses the bottom one. The doors close with a WHOOSH and the car descends -- down, down, down. \nFrost glances over at Karen, smiling amiably. \nFROST On its surface, this building houses one of the city's oldest financial institutions -- and for over two-hundred years its served our corporate needs. Look beneath the surface, however, and you'll discover another truth entirely -- \nThe elevator CHIMES, having arrived at its destination. The doors HISS open, revealing \nINT. THE TEMPLE OF NIGHT \nA vast, barrel-vaulted chamber lined with recessed tombs stretches out before us -- an underground cathedral of sorts, wrought from alabaster and marble. Restrained. Elegant. Replete with dark splendor. \nFROST As above, so below. \nTorches burn in wall sconces, casting everything in a warm, amber glow. Frost takes in the beauty of the place. \nFROST Welcome to our hall of ancients, Doctor. We call it the Temple of Night. \nBlade and Karen are led to the middle of the room, where a stone altar rises up from a dais. Blade is roughly thrown to the ground. He kneels there, eyes cast downward. Broken. His system being assaulted by the devastating effects of the Thirst. \nQuinn and Mercury pick their way through Blade's discarded gear. Quinn picks up the punching dagger, admiring it. \nFrost turns to Mercury, who's been holding Blade's scabbarded sword. \nFROST Let's see this sword of his. \nMercury draws the sword, handing it to Frost. He sights down the length of it, testing its weight. With a flick of his wrist, he lashes out, slashing Blade's cheek open. \nFROST Still quite sharp, I see. \nBlade feebly struggles to rise. Frost clubs him on the back of the neck with the sword pommel. Blade crumples. Karen tries to pull free, but Quinn holds her tight. \nKAREN Blade -- \nFROST You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip. \nFrost reaches down, dragging Blade's head up by his hair. Karen watches on as Frost continues to taunt him. \nFROST How long has it been since you had your serum? Twelve hours? More? You must be quite thirsty by now. \nHe crouches down so he's eye to eye with Blade. \nFROST What does it feel like? Is your blood on fire? Are you burning up inside? Give in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace your true nature. \nFrost leads Mercury, Quinn, and the others from the sanctuary. \nBlade struggles futilely against his bonds, crying out in frustration, his body eventually sagging from exhaustion. \nVANESSA (O.S.) There's no use fighting us, Jason. \nBlade looks up, focusing now on -- \nVANESSA, \nwho has remained behind. Blade stares at her. As terrible as his physical torment is, his mother's betrayal is infinitely worse. \nBLADE How could you be a part of this? \nVANESSA These are my people now. I'm one of them. \nBLADE You don't have to be. \nVANESSA You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it. \nShe draws closer, caressing her son's face. There's just a hint of creepy eroticism in her action, a dash of incest. \nVANESSA I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that. \nBLADE I don't believe that. \nVANESSA You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins. \nVanessa turns away now. Blade cries after her -- \nBLADE Mother! \nVanessa pauses, looking back, smiling cruelly. \nVANESSA Your mother died the night you were born. \nAnd with that, she's gone, melting into the shadows. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE BONE PIT - NIGHT \nKaren rises, wary, taking in her shadowed surroundings. \nHEAPS OF HUMAN BONES \nare piled against the pit walls -- skulls, rib-cages, femurs, tibias -- all picked clean of flesh. Some of the skulls have large, canine- like fangs -- the remnants, no doubt, of long-deceased vampires. \nSuddenly we hear a WHISPER of sorts, the soft CLINKING of bone fragments grinding together -- \nKaren spins, trying to place the source of the sound. Then she hears the SOUND again. Behind her now, closer. \nREVENANT (O.S.) Karennnnn -- \nKaren looks up with a growing sense of dread. \nA FACE \nemerges from the darkness. Pallid, cadaverous, shedding its desiccated flesh. Lidless eyes like black marbles slick with Vaseline. A mouth like a raw wound. \nREVENANT Karreennnnnn. I never thought I'd see you againnnnn. \nKaren backs away, realizing who she's standing before. \nKAREN Curtis?! \nWhat used to be Curtis SNARLS, knocking Karen back into the drift- pile of bones. It pins her to the ground, kneeling above her, gurgling through its gutted trachea. \nCURTIS REVENANT Tell, me, Karennn -- ever have second thoughts -- about us? \nKaren SCREAMS, trying to force the revenant away from her, but it lunges closer, lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a pathetic approximation of a French kiss. \nShe fumbles behind her, choking, grabbing hold of a human femur, blindly swinging it upward -- \nCRACK! The blow shatters the Curtis-thing's jaw. It rears back, falling to the side. \nKaren crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and again -- \nCRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it back until the femur actually splinters in half. The creature's head hangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken -- but still it advances, dragging itself back up. \nMeanwhile, Blade traps Mercury's other hand, disarming her, flipping her over his shoulder. He hefts his Casull, BLASTING her into eternity -- \nA bloodbath ensues. Blade moves like speed-personified, FIRING off one, two, THREE HEADSHOTS with brain-numbing accuracy, cutting down the vampires where they stand. \nIt's an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and -CLICK-CA-CHING-CLICK!- Blade and Karen have spent their bullets and -- \nFROST (O.S.) Enough!!! \nBlade turns to face -- \nFROST, \nwho's advancing, clutching Blade's own sword in his hand. He thrusts the sword forward -- \nBlade presses the grip-trigger on his punching dagger -CHING!- the two side blades spread out. We hear the RASP and CLANG of metal on metal as Blade manages to trap the sword-point between two of the dagger blades -- \nFor a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together, then, Frost forces Blade backwards -- \nWhat happens next is the most blindingly-fast sword fight ever exposed to celluloid. Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves. \nFrost lands a powerful blow on Blade's shoulder, the sword-edge biting deep into the flesh. Blade SCREAMS. Frost withdraws the sword for another strike -- \n-- until Blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing Frost's left arm off at the shoulder -- \nThe severed arm releases Blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! To Frost and Blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid-air, bleeding red, quivering like zero-G liquid, then SLURPING back to Frost's arm- stump to re-attach itself! \nUndaunted, Blade slices the punching dagger into Frost's mid-section, meeting only liquid-like resistance. The moment Blade withdraws his dagger, Frost's flesh seals itself up again. \nBlade hesitates now, uncertain -- and Frost laughs, understanding what has happened. \nFROST You're too late, Blade. I'm already changing. Don't you see? The Sleeper has awakened. I'm not just Frost anymore. I'm becoming a god now, blood incarnate. \nEven as Frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph, bleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. He doesn't walk so much now as flow. He's become a three-dimensional creature of animated blood! A blood demon. \nON KAREN, \nas she watches Frost's transformation, wide-eyed. She SEES Blade's discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the periphery of her vision -- \nVANESSA \nrushes at Karen in a near-blur. The SNARLING hellion is upon Karen in an eye-blink, SLAMMING her down against the temple floor, pinning her. \nVANESSA Did you think I'd forgotten you, you little whore? \nBACK TO FROST, \nwho towers above Blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid- like form. \nFROST You can't hurt me anymore. \nWHOOSH! Frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, HOWLING WITH LAUGHTER, then just as suddenly -- \n-- splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. In the blink of an eye, he streams through Blade's feet, re-solidifying behind Blade. Blade spins, swings his dagger -- \nOnce again, Frost morphs into blood-form. He races around Blade in a series of spouting arcs, turning from blood-form to solid and back again in a series of split-second transformations. \nBlade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time -- \nWHOOSH! Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing. Blade spins, unnerved, trying to pin-point his foe's next manifestation. \nBLADE Where are you?! \nFrost's voice answers from all directions. \nFROST Everywhere. \nA DROPLET OF BLOOD \nspatters the floor at Blade's feet. Blade looks up -- \nA SHOWER OF BLOOD \nrains from above, coalescing into Frost as he sweeps down on Blade like a giant bird of prey, crushing him against the temple floor. \nFROST You want my blood so much?! Take it! \nFrost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake-like spouts of blood -- the rest of Frost remains solid. The blood-spouts twist around Blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing Blade's head in a bubble of blood. \nBlade claws at the blood-bubble as if it were a solid object that he could dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it! \n", "test1_input": "FROST Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it. (cryptically) Which, of course, they do. \nDRAGONETTI You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost. \nFROST Perhaps. \nFrost studies Dragonetti, a self-satisfied grin on his face. If the act was intended to unnerve Dragonetti, it succeeded, though the ancient vampire would never admit it. \nDRAGONETTI What are you up to, Frost? \nFrost shuts the lid on his laptop, rising, drawing intimidatingly close to Dragonetti. \nFROST'S VOICE Wouldn't you like to know, Old Fang? \nA beat as the young turk stares his elder down. Dragonetti is the first to lose his nerve. Frost smiles and exits, leaving the old vampire to lick his wounds. \nCAMERA DRIFTS back to the hulking silhouette, which has been eavesdropping on the conversation. It quivers in fear. \nINT. BLADE'S OLDS (ON KAREN'S STREET CORNER) - DAY \nBlade brings the car to a stop. Karen looks at him. His eyes are hidden behind his glasses, his expression stone. \nBLADE Remember what we said. Keep your eyes open. They're everywhere. \nEXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nAs Karen climbs out, Blade swings the door shut behind her. The Olds ROARS off down the quiet residential street. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, LOBBY - DAY \nKaren crosses the lobby, stepping into an elevator. Just as the doors are closing, a WOMAN and TWO MEN duck in alongside her. \nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY \nSilence, the uncomfortableness of an elevator ride magnified tenfold. Karen can FEEL the eyes of her fellow passengers upon her. Finally succumbing to paranoia, she hazards a glance -- would she be able to tell if these people weren't human? The woman turns to Karen, smiles -- \nKaren surreptitiously fishes the \"vampire mace\" from her pocket, clutching it -- and now one of the men turns to look at her, nodding -- \nINT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY \nThe elevator doors open. Karen hurries out, heads left, finds herself in a deserted hallway. She looks back -- \n-- then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out! As Karen raises the canister of mace -- \n-- the trio turn and head down to the right. Karen breathes a sigh of relief, shakes her head. \nINT. KAREN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nKaren enters quickly, bolting the door behind her. She picks up the phone, dials 911 -- \nKAREN I need the police. This is an emergency -- \nAs Karen waits to be connected, she moves to the back entrance and checks the locks -- then the windows, then the fire escape -- finally, a VOICE comes on the other end. \nKAREN Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was with Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital last night -- that's right, I witnessed the attack -- (listening) 115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll wait here. Please hurry. \nKaren hangs up the phone and turns -- \nA SHAFT OF BRIGHT SUNLIGHT \nstreams in through a window. Karen forces herself to look at it and winces, shielding her eyes. Again, she brings a hand to the bandaged wound on her neck. She moves to the window, pulling the shade down, frightened. \nKAREN Get a grip on yourself, girl. \nShe sinks down into a chair to wait, setting Whistler's vampire mace aside. Then she shuts her eyes, massaging her temples. We SEE -- \nA BRIEF FLASH OF \nQuinn, his mouth opening wide, saliva dripping from his fangs. His pupils pulsating hypnotically. We rush into his gaping maw and -- \nWHAM! We're back to reality. Karen wakes with a start, looks to the windows -- time has passed, it's getting dark outside -- \n-- and someone is KNOCKING at the front door. Karen reaches for the vampire mace, then moves to the door. She looks through the peephole, cautious -- \nKAREN Who is it? \nKAREN'S POV (FISH-EYE) \nA POLICE OFFICER stands in the hallway -- 30s, handsome, a knight in shining armor as far as she's concerned. \n", "test1_true": "Karen visibly relaxes. She opens the door and steps aside, allowing Gideon to enter. \nKAREN Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen -- \nGideon smiles, takes a quick glance around the room, then studies Karen's face, the bandages on her neck. \nGIDEON Are you all right? (off Karen's nod) I'm glad you called, Ms. Jansen, we've been anxious to get a hold of you. You disappeared on us for a while. \nKAREN I know. Listen -- do you have any idea what happened to Curtis, the other doctor? \nGIDEON (matter of fact) Oh, he's dead. But I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. \nKAREN (alarmed) Why? \nGideon's smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun. \nGIDEON Because you're dead too. \nKaren GASPS. She has a half-second to act -- in which she triggers a spray of vampire mace into Gideon's face. Gideon stumbles back, blinded, cursing, rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes -- \nKaren expects pyrotechnics -- but the end result is little more than an annoyance. A second later, Gideon is simply blinking, sniffing his fingers, confused -- \nGIDEON Garlic? \nKAREN He said it would work against vampires -- \nGideon bursts out laughing. \nGIDEON Who said I was a vampire? \nGideon shakes his head, still snickering. He forces Karen against the wall, placing the gun against her head -- \nGIDEON Thanks for the laugh. You can shut your eyes if you want to. \nCRASH!!! The front door explodes open as Blade comes flying through it! \nGideon tries to bring his pistol up -- but Blade grips the man's hand and squeezes. Gideon SCREAMS as his bones snap like kindling. The pistol falls from his grasp -- \nBlade fires his fist into Gideon's gut again and again, then flings the officer across the room, sending him SMASHING into a glass-cased cabinet. Bleeding, battered, Gideon struggles to stand -- \nBlade is all over him, kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he sinks to the floor in a half-conscious haze. \nBlade stands over Gideon's limp form, fists clenched, breathing heavily, touching down after his adrenaline high. Finally, he looks to Karen -- \nBLADE You okay? \nKaren nods, glances at Gideon -- \nKAREN How did you know? \nBLADE Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up. \nKAREN You used me as bait?! \nBLADE It worked, didn't it? \nKAREN But, he could've -- \nBLADE He didn't. Get over it. \nBlade kneels next to Gideon. He turns the man's head, inspects the neck, the skin behind the ear -- \nKAREN But he's a policeman -- \nBLADE He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark? \nBlade pushes aside Gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol tattooed into the man's scalp. \nBLADE That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner -- (studying the glyph) This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now -- \nKAREN Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them? \nBLADE Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them. \nKAREN And that's a good thing? \nBLADE For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high. \n", "test2_input": "KAREN There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when -- \nFROST What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about. \nKAREN But you use blood banks -- \nFROST Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life. (rising from his seat) Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle. \nFrost moves to the end of the room. He pushes a button. With a HUM the wall slides open, revealing something Karen wishes she'd never seen -- living blood banks. \nTHREE SEDATED HUMANS \nhave been hooked up to IV feeds which replenish various nutrients as their blood is drained from them. Shunts have been implanted in their forearms which serve as taps. \nFROST Under these conditions I can keep a donor alive for years, producing anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints of blood. (admiring his charges) Of course, this is just a pilot program, really. Once the Tide comes, we'll need to expand production. So many more mouths to feed -- \nKaren turns away, overwhelmed by revulsion. \nKAREN You're a monster. \nFROST Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest. \nFrost stares at Karen with an intense, uncompromising gaze. \nFROST I have a wake-up call for the human race. You're no longer at the top of the food chain. \nEXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - DAY \nBLADE'S POV \nA telephoto view of Frost's penthouse. The windows are polarized, blocking out the sun's harsh rays. \nBlade lowers a pair of binoculars. He's standing on the roof of a building across the street. He hefts an air-launcher rifle up into firing position -- \nBANG! An iron spike trailing a steel cable rockets through the air between the two buildings, sinking into the concrete facade of Frost's penthouse. Blade secures his end of the rope. He slips a pulley over the rope, grabs hold of two handles, and leaps off the roof ledge! \nWHOOSH! Blade slides towards Frost's penthouse, a good twenty stories above street level. A second before he reaches the windows, Blade lets go. Momentum sends him CRASHING through in a shower of glass. \nINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY \nAn ALARM is ringing. Sunlight streams in through the broken window. TWO VAMPIRE GUARDS who have been caught in the sudden swath of light are burning up before our eyes. Blade climbs to his feet -- \nA THIRD VAMPIRE \nleaps at him. Blade spins, flipping the vampire over his shoulder, sending him straight through one of the other windows -- \nEXT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY \nThe vampire tumbles earthward, SCREAMING as the sun's rays ignite his body, falling like a human comet. \nINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY \nBlade unsheathes his sword and heads out into the hall -- \nINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY \nTo Blade's right is the inner chamber with the \"waterfall\" walls. As ANOTHER VAMPIRE approaches, Blade readies his sword -- \nVAMPIRE You think I'm afraid of that toothpick of yours? \nBLADE You should be. I've made some improvements. \nAnd with that, Blade thrusts his blackened sword forward, right through the vampire's chest. \nThe creature SHRIEKS and atomizes -FWOOSH!- flying apart in a fine- beaded spray of blood mist. \nUp ahead are a set of steel doors with a time-lock mechanism. Blade draws a Casull, BLASTS away at the lock, then shoulders the doors open -- \nINT. FROST'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - DAY \nWe are in a windowless, vault-like room dominated by a series of high-tech STAINLESS STEEL SARCOPHAGI. Think of a hyperbaric coffin, each unit possessing a small face-plate window through which the sleeping subject can be viewed. \nBlade unsheathes his sword. He grabs the lid of the first sarcophagus, HEAVING upward. With a PNEUMATIC HISS, the lid rises, belching out a cloud of condensation mist. \nAs the mist clears, revealing the occupant within, Blade raises his sword, ready to plunge it downward -- only it's not Deacon Frost who rests beneath him, it's -- \nVANESSA, \nBlade's mother!!! Although some thirty years have passed since the events of our prologue, Vanessa looks exactly the same -- vibrant, beautiful, full of life. Her eyes open. \n", "test2_true": "Blade gasps, uncomprehending. \nBLADE Mother -- ?! \nVanessa rises from the sarcophagus, tears staining her cheeks. \nVANESSA I've missed you so much, Jason. (drawing closer) You have no idea what I've been through, how much I've wanted to see you -- \nBlade falters, his mind reeling. What he's seeing is incomprehensible -- his mother is dead. Yet, here she is in the flesh, reaching out to him and -- \n-- flashing a mouthful of viper-like fangs! She SNARLS and strikes, brutally raking her claws across Blade's face, knocking the sword from his grasp -- \nA TRIO OF BLACK-CLAD VAMPIRES \nled by Mercury step from the shadows where they'd been waiting all along. They're armed with tasers which they fire en masse -- \nBlade is hit by the taser darts from all sides. He writhes as electricity courses through him, then collapses in a heap. He labors to lift his head, looking up at Vanessa -- \nBLADE But you -- died -- \nVANESSA (a hellish smile) Deacon brought me back. \nBLADE Fight him -- \nAs if on cue, Frost appears at Vanessa's side, wrapping a proprietary arm about her waist, kissing the nape of her neck. She leans into him -- an act of practiced intimacy. \nFROST She can't. She's one of my thralls now. She has about as much free will as a puppet on a string. (looking at Vanessa) You love me, don't you, Vanessa? \nVANESSA Yes. \nFrost kisses Vanessa hungrily. Then he kneels and reaches into Blade's jacket, retrieving a vial of Blade's serum. \nFROST What do we have here? Your precious serum? I don't think you'll be needing this anymore. \nFrost crushes the vial in his fist. Blade struggles to reach Frost, stretching a palsied hand upwards -- \nBLADE Please -- \nVANESSA Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world. \nBlade stares at Vanessa uncomprehending. \nFROST Don't look so surprised, Blade. You've spent your life looking for the vampire who fathered you. Well you can rest easy now, you've found him. (gripping Blade's chin) Daddy's here. \nBlade's eyes widen in shock. Frost simply laughs. \nFROST It's true, Blade. You've got my blood running through your veins. (smiling) Thirty years ago. A moonlit street, a woman on her way home alone. You were conceived the night I tore my fangs into your mother's flesh. \nFrost swings his fist into Blade's skull. Everything goes black. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT \nFADE IN as Blade opens his eyes, still groggy, his face beaded with sweat. Feverish. His hands have been bound tightly behind his back with manacles and chains. \nKAREN \nsits nearby, watching him. From the steady rocking motion and the SOUNDS of traffic outside, it's evident that they are in the back of a moving truck. \nKAREN Are you all right? \nBLADE (weakly) I've been better -- \nBLADE How long have we been driving? \nKAREN (shaking her head) I don't know. I woke up just before you did -- \nAs he struggles to sit up, she crosses over to him. Blade shuts his eyes for a moment, fighting a wave of pain. \nKAREN Is it bad? \nBLADE (nodding) We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours. \nKaren doesn't respond. Instead she looks away. How in the world is she supposed to tell him this? \nKAREN (quietly) It won't work on you. \n", "test3_input": "Vanessa hands Frost the chalice containing Blade's blood. He lifts it up for all to see. The vampires begin to chant en masse, some long- forgotten invocation in the vampire tongue. \nFROST (grinning, to himself) \"And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\" \nFrost lifts the chalice to his lips and begins to drink. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT \nBlade tries to sit up, gripping Karen's wrist -- \nBLADE Get out of here -- \nKAREN I'm not leaving without you. \nBLADE You don't understand. The Thirst -- \nHe clutches his stomach, experiencing phenomenal pain. \nBLADE (gasping) -- tearing me -- apart. \nKAREN I know. Take some of my blood. \nBLADE No -- \nKAREN It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't. \nBlade suppresses a shudder. Simply keeping himself from attacking her takes every ounce of his resolve. \nBLADE I can't -- I won't be able to stop -- \nKAREN Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is. \nKaren matches Blade's gaze, steeling herself. The truth is, she's terrified. \nBlade stares back at her. At this moment, he wants what Karen is offering more than anything he's ever desired. And so he rises -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - SANCTUARY - NIGHT \nFrost continues drinking down the blood, when suddenly, a force seizes his body. He throws his head back, eyes rolling to white, flinging the chalice aside. \nAnd as the vampire incantation reaches a fevered pitch, we SEE the stone tomb tablets off the vampire ancestors beginning to judder -- as if some force within were trying to break free -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT \nKaren turns her head to the side, baring her neck, offering herself to Blade. Blade opens his mouth. His canines elongate. He lowers his head -- \n-- and starts to feed. Karen involuntarily stiffens as Blade's teeth puncture her skin and we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT \nFrost shakes, possessed by an unseen force. A wind picks up from nowhere, swirling about the chamber, accompanied by a strange HUMMING. \nSuddenly, one of the tombs BURSTS OPEN. A WRAITH-LIKE SPIRIT rushes outward in a fountain of light, penetrating Frost's body. \nThen ANOTHER TOMB SPLITS APART. Then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER -- until a torrent of SPIRIT-WRAITHS are surging into Frost, buffeting him about like a scarecrow in a cyclone. \nMercury, Vanessa, and the other vampires back away, apprehensive, humbled by what they're witnessing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT \nBlade moans, sinking his teeth deeper. Karen's head rolls back. Her eyes open -- glassy, unseeing -- as a wave of ecstasy overtakes her. \nShe shudders, her breath quickening, falling into a synchronous rhythm with Blade's. Her fingers dig deep into his back, clawing downward, tearing into him -- \nShe's not Karen anymore -- she's a red blood cell, an erythrocyte, spinning in a river of plasma, roaring up Blade's femoral artery, racing towards the pumping chambers of his heart which beats like the deafening breath of God, which blots all other sounds out of existence and we're -- \nCUTTING BACK AND FORTH NOW \nbetween Frost's transformation and Blade's, each of them growing stronger by the second, caught in an ever-increasing feedback loop of expanding energy until -- \n", "test3_true": "Blade tears himself from Karen, his pulse racing as -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT \n-- the invocation of LaMagra reaches critical mass. Frost is consumed by a hellish force, unable to withstand the onslaught of spirit energy any longer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT \n-- Karen clawing at Blade, tears streaming down her cheeks. \nKAREN Don't stop -- \nBut Blade grips her by her shoulders, shoving her back. Karen stares at Blade, wide-eyed, as if waking from a trance. She touches the raw wounds on her neck, shaken -- \nKAREN My God -- \nBlade rises to his full height. His strength has more than returned, it's been doubled by the infusion of real blood. And there's something else in his gaze now too -- an animal fury that was missing before. Blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness. \nKAREN (hesitant) Are you -- all right? \nBlade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists, SNAPPING them apart like toys. He flexes his hands -- fingernails lengthening to tapered points. And he smiles, offering us a view of his canines, which have elongated into fangs. \nBLADE (near-demonic) Never been better. \nINT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT \nThe aftermath. Smoke hangs heavy in the air, occluding the area where Frost had stood. As it dissipates, Mercury and the others creep forward, apprehensive -- \nMERCURY Deacon? \nFROST \nstands with his back to us, his body trailing wisps of occult fumes. As he slowly turns, we catch a glimpse of his eyes -- burning with an awesome, inner fire. \nFROST No longer. \nBLADE (O.S.) Frost!!! \nAll heads turn -- \nBLADE \nstands at the balcony overhead, Karen at his side. He leaps from it, somersaulting down to the floor below, landing on his feet like a predatory cat. \nBLADE Who dies first? \nFROST (growling, to the others) Take him. \nQuinn GROWLS, stepping forward, armed with Blade's punching dagger. He offers his second \"new hand\" up for view. \nQUINN Grew another hand for you sweetmeat -- (tossing the dagger to his new hand) -- and now I'm gonna kill you with it. \nQuinn charges. Blade meets the vampire head-on, dropping into a low kick and sweeping the vampire's legs out from under him. He spins behind Quinn -- \nBLADE Let's see if you can grow a new one of these! \nBlade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket sleeve, pulling out a retractable strangle-wire which he twists around Quinn's throat. \nBlade tightens the wire, decapitating Quinn. The headless body staggers about, then drops to the cavern floor. Blade scoops up his punching dagger -- \nBLADE Next? \nMercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse. Blade launches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamp's face, SNAPPING its neck -- \nMercury has Blade's .454 Casulls. She aims them at him -- \nMERCURY Have a taste of your own medicine! \nAs she FIRES, Blade tucks and rolls, knocking one of the guns from her hand. The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up by -- \nKAREN, \nwho takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away. \n"}

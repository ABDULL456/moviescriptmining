{"train": "THE BIG LEBOWSKI \nTHE BIG LEBOWSKI \nWe are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices gently singing \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" and a deep, affable, Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps: \nVOICE-OVER A way out west there was a fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself.  This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from.  But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  And a lot about where he lived, like- wise.  But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'. \nWe top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us. \nVOICE-OVER They call Los Angeles the City of Angels.  I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there.  'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says.  But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold-- wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. \nINTERIOR   RALPH'S \nIt is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep. \nHe is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates. \nVOICE-OVER Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties-- just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes there's a man. \nThe Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs. \nVOICE-OVER And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. \nCHECKOUT GIRL \nShe waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him. \nGEORGE BUSH This aggression will not stand. . . This will not stand! \nThe Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache. \nVOICE-OVER ...and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that--quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County. \nThe Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents. \nVOICE-OVER ...which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide--but sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes there's a man. \nEXTERIOR  RALPH'S \nLong shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or three cars parked in the huge lot. \nVOICE-OVER Wal, I lost m'train of thought here. But--aw hell, I done innerduced him enough. \nThe Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot. Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk. The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night. \nAfter a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points. \nDUDE It's the LeBaron. \nDUDE'S HOUSE \nThe Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door. \nINSIDE \nThe Dude enters and flicks on a light. \nHis head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit. We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body. Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole. \nThe Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor. \nThe Dude blows bubbles. \nVOICE We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny said you were good for it. \nHands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and gasps for air. \nVOICE Where's the money, Lebowski! \nHis head is plunged back into the toilet. \nVOICE Where's the money, Lebowski! \nThe hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping. \nVOICE WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD! \nDUDE It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look. \nHis head is plunged back in. \nVOICE Don't fuck with us.  If your wife owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that means you owe money to Jackie Treehorn. \nThe inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the toilet. \nThe Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand. \nLooming over him is a strapping blond man. \nWALTER This was a valued, uh. \nDonny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter. \nDONNY What tied the room together, Dude? \nWALTER Were you listening to the story, Donny? \nDONNY What-- \nWALTER Were you listening to the Dude's story? \nDONNY I was bowling-- \nWALTER So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know-- \nDUDE What's your point, Walter? \nWALTER There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason-- \nDONNY Yeah Walter, what's your point? \nWALTER Huh? \nDUDE What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about? \nWALTER Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here-- \nDONNY What the fuck is he talking about? \nDUDE My rug. \nWALTER Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element. \nDUDE This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about? \nWALTER What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please. \nDUDE Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my-- \nWALTER What the fuck are you-- \nDUDE Walter, he peed on my rug-- \nDONNY He peed on the Dude's rug-- \nWALTER YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude. \nDUDE So who-- \nWALTER Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong? \nDUDE No, but-- \nWALTER Am I wrong! \nDUDE Yeah, but-- \nWALTER Okay. That, uh. \nHe elaborately clears his throat. \nThat rap really tied the room together, did it not? \nDUDE Fuckin' A. \nDONNY And this guy peed on it. \nWALTER Donny!  Please! \nDUDE Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy-- \nDONNY His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude! \nDUDE Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug. \nWALTER Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on your fucking Rug. \nCLOSE ON A PLAQUE \nWe pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR. \nReflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room with a YOUNG MAN.  We hear the two men talk: \nYOUNG MAN And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera. \nDUDE Yes, uh, very impressive. \nYOUNG MAN Please, feel free to inspect them. \nDUDE You mean, did you personally come and pee on my-- \nLEBOWSKI Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug? \nDUDE Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug-- \nLEBOWSKI Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the-- \nDUDE Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just-- \nLEBOWSKI You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski? \nDUDE Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing-- \nLEBOWSKI Are you employed, sir? \nDUDE Employed? \nLEBOWSKI You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday. \nDUDE Is this a--what day is this? \nLEBOWSKI But I do work, so if you don't mind-- \nDUDE No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes-- \nLEBOWSKI My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can. \nThe Dude rises. \nDUDE Ah fuck it. \nLEBOWSKI Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything! \nThe Dude is heading for the door. \nLEBOWSKI Your \"revolution\" is over, Mr. Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums lost! \nAs the Dude opens the door. \nLEBOWSKI ...My advice is, do what your parents did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will always lose-- do you hear me, Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS-- \nThe Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find himself-- \nHALLWAY --in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt is approaching. \nBRANDT How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski? \nDUDE Okay.  The old man told me to take any rug in the house. \nWALKWAY \nA houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming pool to a garage.  Brandt and the Dude follow. \nBRANDT Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude. \nDUDE It's the LeBaron. \nDUDE'S POINT OF VIEW \nTracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails. \nBeyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the pool. \nBRANDT Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude. \nDUDE Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john. \nCLOSER TRACK \nArcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the nails emerald green. \nTHE DUDE \nLooking. \nWIDER \nThe young woman looks up at him.  She is in her early twenties. \nShe leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude. \nYOUNG WOMAN Blow on them. \nThe Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over them. \nDUDE Huh? \nShe waggles her foot and giggles. \nDUDE Hey man-- \nWALTER Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line! \nSmokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter. \nWALTER Smokey Huh? \nWALTER Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul. \nSMOKEY Bullshit.  Eight, Dude. \nWALTER Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame. \nSMOKEY Bullshit. Walter! \nWALTER This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules. \nDUDE Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game. \nWALTER This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong? \nSMOKEY Yeah, but-- \nWALTER Am I wrong!? \nSMOKEY Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight. \nWalter takes out a gun. \nWALTER Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain. \nDUDE Hey Walter-- \nWALTER Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain. \nSMOKEY I'm not-- \nWALTER A world of pain. \nA manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a phone. \nSMOKEY Look Dude, I don't hold with this. This guy is your partner, you should-- \nWalter primes the gun and points it at his head. \nWALTER HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO! \nThe Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps. \nDUDE Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away. \nWALTER MARK IT ZERO! \nSMOKEY Walter-- \nWALTER YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!! \nSMOKEY All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero! \nHe points frantically at the score projected above the lane. \nSMOKEY You happy, you crazy fuck? \nWALTER This is a league game, Smokey! \nPARKING LOT \nWalter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car.  The Pomeranian trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier. \nDUDE Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector. \nWALTER You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course-- \nDUDE And you know Smokey has emotional problems! \nWALTER You mean--beyond pacifism? \nDUDE He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile! \nAs the two men get into the car: \nWALTER Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong? \nDUDE No, you're not wrong-- \nWALTER Am I wrong! \nDUDE You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole. \nJeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around. \nLEBOWSKI It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski? \nDUDE Dude. \nLEBOWSKI Huh? \nDUDE I don't know, sir. \nLEBOWSKI Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man? \nDUDE Sure.  That and a pair of testicles. \nLebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost in thought. \nLEBOWSKI You're joking.  But perhaps you're right. \nThe Dude thumps at his chest pocket. \nDUDE Mind if I smoke a jay? \nLEBOWSKI Bunny. \nHe turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks. \nDUDE 'Scuse me? \nLEBOWSKI Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir? \nDUDE Fuckin' A. \nLEBOWSKI Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry. \nHe clears his throat. \nLEBOWSKI I received this fax this morning. \nBrandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the Dude. \nLEBOWSKI As you can see, it is a ransom note. Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play. Men who will not sign their names. Weaklings.  Bums. \nTHE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX: \nWE HAVE BUNNY.  GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON- CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES.  AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.  NO FUNNY STUFF. \nDUDE Bummer. \nLebowski looks soulfully at the Dude. \nLEBOWSKI Brandt will fill you in on the details. \nHe wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire. Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the hall. \nHALLWAY \nThe soprano's singing is once again faint.  Brandt's voice is hushed: \nBRANDT Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money. \nDUDE Why me, man? \nBRANDT He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion. \nDUDE So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh? \nBRANDT Well Dude, we just don't know. \nBOWLING PINS \nCRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion. \nWIDER \nStill in slow motion.  We are looking across the length of the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying perfect form.  He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side. \nFAST TRACK IN \nOn the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler. \nDUDE Fucking Quintana--that creep can roll, man-- \nBACK TO THE BOWLER \nDisplaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's conversation continues over. \nWALTER Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude. \nDUDE Huh? \nVOICE Okay, listen-- \nWalter looks over at the Dude and bellows: \nWALTER Dude, are you fucking this up? \nVOICE Who is that? \nDUDE The driver man, I told you-- \nClick.  Dial tone. \nDUDE Oh shit.  Walter. \nWALTER What the fuck is going on there? \nDUDE They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands! \nWALTER Easy, Dude. \nDUDE We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter! \nWALTER Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her-- \nThe phone chirps. \nWALTER Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs-- \nDUDE Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here. \nWALTER (patronizing) Okay Dude.  Have it your way. \nThe Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack. \nWALTER But they're amateurs. \nThe Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone: \nDUDE Dude here. \nVOICE Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff. \nDUDE Yeah. \nVOICE So no funny stuff.  Okay? \nDUDE Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go. \nA HIGHWAY SIGN:  SIMI VALLEY ROAD \nIt flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car. \nDUDE That was the sign. \nWalter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road. \nWALTER Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh. \nDUDE Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she? \nWALTER That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him. \nHe looks at the Dude. \nWALTER ...Huh? \nDUDE Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch. \nWALTER Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam-- \nThe phone chirps. \nDUDE Dude. \nVOICE You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you. \nClick.  Dial tone. \nDUDE FUCK. \nWALTER What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off? \nDUDE There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car! \nWALTER Huh? \nDUDE We throw the money out of the moving car! \nWalter stares dumbly for a beat. \nBeep.  Dial tone. \nOLDER COP Well, I guess we can close the file on that one. \nTRACKING FORWARD \nWe are moving through the open living area of a large downtown L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant rug. \nWe hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude, standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky depths of the cavernous space. \nSomething huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head. As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass. \nWe see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas. \nThe Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track and haul it back for another push. \nVOICE I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Lebowski. \nShe rumbles by in another pass. \nAll right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro. Help me down. \nThe  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix look. \nDoes the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski? \nDUDE Is that what that's a picture of? \nMAUDE In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina. \nDUDE Oh yeah? \nMAUDE Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his \"dick\" or his \"rod\" or his \"Johnson\". \nDUDE \"Johnson\"? \nMAUDE Thank you. \nThis to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe. \nAll right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give. Now.  As for this. . . \"kidnapping\"-- \nDUDE Huh? \nMAUDE Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven. \nDUDE Right, but let me explain something about that rug-- \nMAUDE Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski? \nDUDE Excuse me? \nMAUDE Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it? \nDUDE I was talking about my rug. \nMAUDE You're not interested in sex? \nDUDE You mean coitus? \nMAUDE I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy. \nDUDE Oh, no. \nMAUDE Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these. \nDUDE Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua? \nMAUDE Take a look at this, sir. \nShe is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen flickers to life.  A title card: \nJACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS \nSECOND CARD: \nKARL HUNGUS \nAND \nBUNNY LAJOYA \nIN \nA THIRD CARD: \nLOGJAMMIN' \nThe Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway to his glass. \nHe followed us here. \nThe Dude turns to look. \nHIS POV \nHalfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the curb.  In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape. \nTHE DUDE \nHe scowls. \nDUDE When did he- \nThe Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half- nelson by another uniformed chauffeur. \nSECOND CHAUFFEUR Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No arguments. \nAs he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it. \nDUDE Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here! \nThe waiting limo's back door is flung open. \nINSIDE \nThe Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the rear. The door is slammed behind him. \nLEBOWSKI Start talking and talk fast you lousy bum! \nBRANDT We've been frantically trying to reach you, Dude. \nBrandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees. \nLEBOWSKI Where's my goddamn money, you bum?! \nDUDE Well we--I don't-- \nLEBOWSKI They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS! \nBRANDT This is our concern, Dude. \nDUDE No, man, nothing is fucked here-- \nLEBOWSKI NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN! \nThe Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink. \nDUDE C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money-- \nLEBOWSKI WHAT?! \nDUDE I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know? \nLEBOWSKI What in God's holy name are you blathering about? \nDUDE I'll tell you what I'm blathering about!  I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself! \nLebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged. \nDUDE Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir? \nLEBOWSKI (quietly) No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me. \nBRANDT That had not occurred to us, Dude. \nDUDE Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax-- \nLEBOWSKI Brandt, give him the envelope. \nDUDE Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside. \nBRANDT We received it this morning. \nThe Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton wadding and unrolls it. \nLEBOWSKI Since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust. \nThe wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package. \nLEBOWSKI I have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And with Brandt as my witness, tell you this:  Any further harm visited upon Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon your head. \nBetween thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish. \nLEBOWSKI ...By God sir.  I will not abide another toe. \nCOFFEE SHOP \nThe Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little clinking noises. \nThe man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other men are entering behind him. \nThe room is dark now except for spill from the living room; the men are backlit shapes. \nOne of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor. \nThe Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal. \nDUDE Nice marmot. \nThe man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, screaming, into the bathtub. \nThe Dude screams. \nThe marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression. \nFIRST MAN Vee vant zat money, Lebowski. \nThe Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his head and squishes him back into the water. \nSECOND MAN You think veer kidding und making mit de funny stuff? \nTHIRD MAN Vee could do things you only dreamed of, Lebowski. \nSECOND MAN Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski. Vee belief in nossing. \nHe scoops the marmot out of the water.  It shakes itself off, spraying the Dude. \nDUDE Jesus! \nDIETER Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski! NOSSING!! \nThe marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking itself and convulsing in little sneezes. \nDUDE Jesus Christ! \nFIRST MAN Tomorrow vee come back und cut off your chonson. \nDUDE Excuse me? \nFIRST MAN I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON! \nThe three men turn to leave.  Over their retreating backs: \nSECOND MAN Just sink about zat, Lebowski. \nFIRST MAN Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski. \nSECOND MAN Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und skvush it, Lebowski! \nNORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS \nA policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a large parking lot. \nPOLICEMAN You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr. Lebowski. Must've been a joyride situation; they abandoned the car once they hit the retaining wall. \nThey have reached the Dude's car.  The  driver's side exterior has been scraped raw.  The policeman hands the Dude a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror. \nPOLICEMAN These were on the road next to the car.  You'll have to get in on the other side. \nThe Dude climbs in the passenger side. \nDUDE My fucking briefcase!  It's not here! \nPOLICEMAN Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report. You're lucky they left the tape deck though. \nDUDE My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's that smell? \nPOLICEMAN Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept in the car.  Or perhaps just used it as a toilet, and moved on. \nThe Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will not go; he bellows through the glass: \nDUDE When will you find these guys?  I mean, do you have any promising leads? \nThe policeman laughs, agreeing broadly. \nPOLICEMAN Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with the boys down at the Crime Lab. They've assigned four more detectives to the case, got us working in shifts. \nThe Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by the glass. \nBOWLING ALLEY BAR \nThe Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer nuts. \nDONNY And then they're gonna stamp on it?! \nWALTER Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny. \nDUDE I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off. \nA man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter vacated.  He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam Elliot, perhaps.  He has a large Western-style mustache and wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat. \nTO THE BARTENDER: \nMAN D'ya have a good sarsaparilla? \nWe recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened the movie. \nBARTENDER Sioux City Sarsaparilla. \nThe Stranger nods. \nTHE STRANGER That's a good one. \nWaiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His crinkled eyes settle on the Dude. \nTHE STRANGER How ya doin' there, Dude? \nThe Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head. \nDUDE Ahh, not so good, man. \nTHE STRANGER One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you. \nDUDE (absently) Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing? \nTHE STRANGER Far from it. \nDUDE Mm. \nThe bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim. \nTHE STRANGER Much obliged. \nHe looks back at the Dude. \nTHE STRANGER I like your style, Dude. \nTHE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY: \nDUDE Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'. \nTHE STRANGER Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words? \nThe Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how out of place the cowpoke is. \nDUDE The fuck are you talking about? \nThe Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the bar. \nTHE STRANGER Okay, have it your way. \nHe brushes his hat brim with a fingertip. \nTHE STRANGER Take it easy, Dude. \nDUDE Yeah.  Thanks man. \nHe is gone.  \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" is ending as we hear an offscreen voice, breaking the spell: \nVOICE Dude!  Dude! \nTHE DUDE LOOKS: \nTony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, beckoning. \nMAUDE'S LOFT \nShe strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut.  Paint flecks her skin. \nMAUDE Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor. \nDUDE No it's fine, really, uh-- \nMAUDE Do you have any news regarding my father's money? \nDUDE I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all. \nMAUDE She most certainly was not! \nDUDE Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got-- \nMAUDE And please don't call her my mother. \nDUDE Now I got-- \nMAUDE She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim. \nDUDE I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence-- \nTHE STREET \nThe car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone poll. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nThe Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which also won't open. \nDUDE Fuck Me. \nBut he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from the lit butt.  He looks around for it. \nSmoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion and back cushion. \nDUDE Fuckola, man. \nHe takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions. There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper sticking out from between the cushions. \nThe Dude pulls it out. \nIt is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right- hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled \"The Louisiana Purchase.\"  In red ink is a large circled D and some handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled in red throughout. \nCRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER \nWe are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, is performing a dance moderne. \nAs Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse audience. \nWALTER He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger-- \nDUDE The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose. \nWALTER Near the In-and-Out Burger-- \nDONNY Those are good burgers, Walter. \nWALTER Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers. \nDUDE Who the fuck is that? \nWALTER Huh? \nDUDE Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers? \nWALTER Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude? \nDUDE Yeah. \nWALTER All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek? \nDUDE Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what? \nWALTER Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude. \nDUDE Uh-huh. \nWALTER The bulk of the series. \nDUDE Uh-huh. \nWALTER Not exactly a lightweight. \nDUDE No. \nWALTER And yet his son is a fucking dunce. \nDUDE Uh. \nWALTER Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the. \nHe waves a hand vaguely toward the stage. \nWALTER What have you.  We'll, uh-- \nDONNY We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger. \nWALTER Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude. \nRESIDENTIAL AREA \nThe Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated house sitting on a scrubby lot.  Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette. \nDUDE Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money! \nWALTER Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny. \nTHE FRONT DOOR \nWalter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish woman. \nWALTER Ah, this is pointless. \nAs he shoves the homework back in the attache case: \nWALTER All right, Plan B.  You might want to watch out the front window there, Larry. \nHe is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to follow him. \nWALTER This is what happens when you FUCK a STRANGER in the ASS, Larry. \nOUTSIDE \nWalter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like an enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at, the Dude, who follows: \nWALTER Fucking language problem, Dude. \nHe pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes out a tire iron. \nWALTER Maybe he'll understand this. \nHe is walking over to the Corvette. \nWALTER YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY! \nCRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which shatters. \nWALTER YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?! \nCRASH!  He takes out the driver's window. \nWALTER THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS! \nLights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs bark. \nWALTER HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY! \nCRASH! \nWALTER HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS! \nCRASH! \nA man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar. \nMAN WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?! \nHe wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter. \nMAN I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK! \nWalter cringes before the enraged Mexican. \nWALTER Hunh? \nThe man looks about, wildly. \nMAN I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR! \nHe runs over to the Dude's car. \nDUDE No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT-- \nCRASH!  CRASH! \nMAN I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR! \nCRASH! \nMAN I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR! \nINSIDE THE CAR \nGlass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny. \nMAN I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR! \nON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO: \nTHE DUDE'S CAR \nWe are looking into the car through the broken windshield as it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved- in windows. \nThe Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the \nroad.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 'on In-and-Out Burgers. \nCreedence music plays above the bluster of wind. \nDUDE'S BUNGALOW \nHe is getting to his feet, but sways woozily. \nDUDE I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie. \nThe Dude shakes his head, tries to focus. \nTREEHORN A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your idea of a joke? \nJackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.  He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the Dude. \nDUDE No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just wanted a car.  All the Dude ever wanted. . . was his rug back. . . not greedy. . . it really. \nHe squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus. Tied the room together. \nHe tips forward, spilling his drink off the table. \nFROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE \nLooking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and squishes. \nFAST FADE OUT \nBLACK \nTHE STRANGER'S VOICE Darkness warshed over the Dude-- darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night.  There was no bottom. \nWe hear a thundering bass. \nSCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD: \nJACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS \nANOTHER TITLE CARD: \nTHE DUDE \nAND \nMAUDE LEBOWSKI \nIN \nTHIRD TITLE CARD: \nGUTTERBALLS \nThe title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's \"Just Dropped In.\" \nThe Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable repairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley. \nIn the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident. \nThe Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball. \nThe lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the end. \nBut it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides. \nHis point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little ball-guide arrows zipping by. \nThe Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face-up. \nNow his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines. \nThe Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair. \nComing at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them, and rush on into black. \nA body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking. \nAs she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor. \nThe Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping. \nThe scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights. The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring. \nWith the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up. \nSQUAD CAR \nThe Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded: \nDUDE He was innocent.  Not a charge was true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay. \nCHIEF'S OFFICE \nThe Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair. \nHis wallet is tossed onto the desk. \nDUDE Get out of that fucking car, man! \nThe man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out. \nThe man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch. \nHe is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a short fringe and a mustache. \nThe Dude shouts to cover his fear: \nDUDE Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man! \nMAN Relax, man!  No physical harm intended! \nDUDE Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead! \nMAN Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus. \nThe Dude is stunned. \nDUDE Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk? \nMAN Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man! \nDUDE Huh? \nDA FINO A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man. \nDUDE I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man. \nDA FINO Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady-- \nDUDE She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man! \nDA FINO Hey, man, I'm not-- \nDUDE Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn? \nDA FINO The Gundersons. \nDUDE The?  Who the fff-- \nDA FINO The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back. \nHe is fumbling in his wallet. \nDA FINO See? \nThe Dude looks at the picture. \nIt is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs. \nDUDE Jesus fucking Christ. \nDA FINO Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago. \nHe is holding out another picture. \nThe Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her. The family farm. \nA bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat snow-swept landscape. \nOutside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it'll make her homesick. \nDUDE Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm once they seen Karl Hungus. \nHe hands back the picture. \nShe's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's definitely not around. \nDA FINO Fuck, man!  That's terrible! \nDUDE Yeah, it sucks. \nDA FINO Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know-- \nWe hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an approaching car. \nDUDE Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino. And stay away from my special la-- from my fucking lady friend. \nThe Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping. \nDENNY'S \nFour people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless, and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and arms. \nNotable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage- swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German. They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad and pen. \nWAITRESS You folks ready? \nDUDE But I guess she told Dieter. \nWALTER Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped her. \nBRANDT Who's this gentleman, Dude? \nWALTER Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN! \nBRANDT You shouldn't go in there, Dude! He's very angry! \nBANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into-- \nTHE GREAT ROOM \nThe big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His wheelchair hums as he spins it around. \nLEBOWSKI (bitterly) Well, she's back.  No thanks to you. \nDUDE Where's the money, Lebowski? \nWALTER A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE SCUM, MAN! \nThe dog yaps. \nLEBOWSKI Who the hell is he? \nWALTER I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS! \nDUDE We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself. \nLEBOWSKI Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it. \nWALTER AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY! \nDUDE You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about. \nLEBOWSKI Well?  Aren't you? \nDUDE Well. . . yeah. \nLEBOWSKI All right, get out.  Both of you. \nWALTER Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire! \nLEBOWSKI I said out.  Now. \nWALTER Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker. \nHe is crossing to Lebowski. \nWALTER This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life! \nLEBOWSKI Stay away from me, mister! \nWalter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski out of the wheelchair by his armpits. \nWALTER Walk, you fucking phony! \nThe big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing the floor like a Raggedy Ann's.  The pomeranian gaily leaps and yaps. \nLEBOWSKI Put me down, you son of a bitch! \nDUDE Walter! \nWALTER It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff! \nDUDE WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN! \nWALTER Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!! \nHe shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the floor, weeping. \nWALTER Oh, shit. \nLEBOWSKI (sobbing) You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you! \nWalter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the floor. \nWALTER Oh, shit. \nDUDE He can't walk, Walter! \nWALTER Yeah, I can see that, Dude. \nLEBOWSKI You monsters! \nDUDE Help me put him back in his chair. \nWalter moves to comply. \nDONNY Are these the Nazis, Walter? \nWalter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three men: \nWALTER They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to be afraid of. \nThe Germans stop conferring. \nDIETER Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat money or vee fuck you up. \nKIEFFER Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee sreaten you. \nHe pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the firelight. \nWALTER Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you. \nDUDE Hey, cool it Walter. \nWalter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans: \nWALTER There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules. \nDIETER Zere ARE no ROOLZ! \nWALTER NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES-- \nKIEFFER His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She sought we'd be getting million dollars!  Iss not fair! \nWALTER Fair!  WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST HERE!  WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF FUCKING CRYBABIES?! \nDUDE Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him. \nWALTER AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK! \nThe Germans confer again, in German. \nDonny is visibly frightened. \nDONNY Are they gonna hurt us, Walter? \nWALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE: \nWALTER They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards. \nTHE CONFERENCE ENDS: \nDIETER Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen. \nWALTER Fuck you. \nThe Dude is digging into his pocket. \nDUDE Come on, Walter, we're ending this thing cheap. \nWalter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's. \nWALTER What's mine is mine. \nDUDE Come on, Walter!. \nLouder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet: \nDUDE Four dollars here! \nHe inspects the change in his palm. \nDUDE Almost five! \nDONNY (tremulously) I got eighteen dollars, Dude. \nWALTER (grimly) What's mine is mine. \nWith a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber. \nDIETER VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY! \nWALTER (coolly) Come and get it. \nDIETER VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN! \nWALTER Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist. \nDIETER I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU! \nWALTER Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman. \nIn a rage, Dieter charges. \nDIETER I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU! \nDUDE Wha. \nWALTER Call the medics, Dude. \nDUDE Wha. . . Donny-- \nWALTER Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out. \nThe Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand on Donny's shoulder. \nWALTER Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing fine.  We got help choppering in. \nFADE OUT \nHOLD IN BLACK \nTHE DUDE AND WALTER \nThey sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off those of the other.  They sit.  They wait. \nA tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it. \nMAN Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved? \nDUDE Yeah man. \nMAN Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you. \nDUDE Jeffrey Lebowski. \nWALTER Walter Sobchak. \nDUDE The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh. \nDONNELLY Excuse me? \nDUDE Nothing. \nDONNELLY Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains. \nWALTER Yeah. \nDONNELLY We have the urn. \nHe nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop. \nDONNELLY And I assume this is credit card? \nHe is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk to whomever wants to take it. \nWALTER Yeah. \nHe takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence. The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards Donnelly, pointing. \nWALTER What's this? \nDONNELLY That is for the urn. \nWALTER Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes. \nDONNELLY Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle. \nWALTER This is a hundred and eighty dollars. \nDONNELLY Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle. \nDUDE Well can we-- \nWALTER A hundred and eighty dollars?! \nDONNELLY They range up to three thousand. \nWALTER Yeah, but we're-- \nDUDE Can we just rent it from you? \nDONNELLY Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house. \nWALTER We're scattering the fucking ashes! \nDUDE Walter-- \nWALTER JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! \nDONNELLY Sir, please lower your voice-- \nDUDE Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in? \nDONNELLY That is our most modestly priced receptacle. \n", "test1_input": "WALTER Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude. \nDUDE Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll. \nWALTER Have it your way.  The point is-- \nDUDE It's your roll-- \nWALTER The fucking point is-- \nDUDE It's your roll. \nVOICE Are you ready to be fucked, man? \nThey both look up. \nQuintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of the lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a windbreaker with a racing stripe and \"Jesus\" stitched on the breast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair. \nQUINTANA I see you rolled your way into the semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and me, we're gonna fuck you up. \nDUDE Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man. \nQuintana looks at Walter. \nQUINTANA Let me tell you something, bendeco. You pull any your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger til it goes \"click\". \nDUDE Jesus. \nQUINTANA You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with the Jesus. \nJesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly. \nWALTER Eight-year-olds, Dude. \nDUDE'S BUNGALOW \nWe are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug. His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an intermittent clatter. \nIn his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987. \nThe Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the Dude opens his eyes. \nHe screams. \nA blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards the carrier. \nThe sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head thunking back onto the rug. \nA million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear the \"La-la-la-la\" of The Man in Me. \nThe black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug. The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed. \nThe Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his bowling shirt. He looks up. \nAhead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing us, growing smaller. \nThe Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand. His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down toward the city, dragged by the ball. \nA  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in black. \nWe hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny surface of an oncoming bowling ball. \nWe pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being regurgitated up at us, overtaking us. \nThe Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass rolling a huge shadow across his face. \nThe gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward us --finger holes. \nThe largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing us once again in black.. \nThe black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in the thumbhole of the rolling ball. \nWe see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde woman, performing her follow-through. \nFloor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; ceiling; approaching pins; again and again. \nWe hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins spin, hit each other and drop. \nWe hear an irritating, insistent beeping. \nFADE IN \nWe are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint. They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is now askew, with one arm off his ear. \nAs the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around.  His head is now resting against hardwood floor, not rug. \nDUDE Oh man. \nHe  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps. \n", "test1_true": "An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is in place. The rug is gone. \nThe  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue. The beeps continue. \nThe phone starts to jangle. \nTRACK \nWe  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway. Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a wrist to  look at  his watch. \nBRANDT They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw? \nDUDE Oh, nothin', you know. \nThey have reached the little desk outside of the big Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case. \nBRANDT Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give. \nDUDE Uh-huh. \nBRANDT Her life is in your hands. \nDUDE Oh, man, don't say that.. \nBRANDT Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands. \nDUDE Shit. \nBRANDT Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done. \nDUDE'S CAR \nWe pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper. \nThe car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase. \nWALTER Take the ringer.  I'll drive. \nThe Dude takes the briefcase and slides over. \nDUDE The what? \nWALTER The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet? \nThe Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it as the car starts rolling. \nDUDE What the hell is this? \nWALTER My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites. \nDUDE Agh-- \nHe closes the briefcase. \nDUDE Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies-- \nWALTER Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty. \nDUDE Walter--what the fuck are you thinking? \nWALTER Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand-- \nDUDE We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along-- \nWALTER My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong? \nDUDE Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter-- \nWALTER It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself-- \nDUDE ' Yeah, but-- \nThe phone chirps.  Dude grabs it. \nDUDE Dude here. \nVOICE (German accent) Who is this? \nDUDE Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go? \nVOICE ...Us? DUDE \nShit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver.  I'm not handling the money and driving the car and talking on the phone all by my fucking-- \nVOICE Shut the fuck up. (Beat) Hello? \nDUDE Yeah? \n", "test1_id": 2328, "test2_input": "WALTER Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem? \nThe portable phone stops ringing. \nDUDE Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman-- \nWALTER What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself-- \nDUDE No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain-- \nWALTER That's right, Dude, 1  % certain-- \nDonny is trotting excitedly up. \nDONNY They posted the next round of the tournament-- \nWALTER Donny, shut the f--when do we play? \nDONNY This Saturday.  Quintana and-- \nWALTER Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule. \nDUDE Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski? \nWALTER I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling? \nDUDE Walter-- \nDONNY Burkhalter. \nWALTER I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas. \nDONNY It's already posted. \nWALTER WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT! \nDUDE Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell-- \nWALTER C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back-- \nDONNY How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter? \nWALTER I'm shomer shabbas. \nDONNY What's that, Walter? \nDUDE Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski? \nWALTER Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll! \nDONNY Sheesh. \nDUDE Walter, how-- \nWALTER Shomer shabbas. \nThe Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone. \nDUDE That's it.  I'm out of here. \nWALTER For Christ's sake, Dude. \nWalter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling alley. \nHell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the hand-off, everything went, uh, you know-- \nDONNY Oh yeah, how'd it go? \nWALTER Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up-- \nDUDE But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna-- \nWALTER Yeah yeah, \"kill that poor woman.\" \nHe waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra. \nWALTER Kill that poor woman. \nDONNY Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas-- \nWALTER Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong? \nDUDE Walter-- \nWALTER Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here? \nDUDE \"Our\" car, Walter? \nWALTER And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car? \n", "test2_true": "DONNY Who has your undies, Walter? \nWALTER Where's your car, Dude? \nDUDE You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else! \nWALTER Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed. \nDUDE It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen! \nWALTER Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude-- \nDUDE Aw, fuck it. \nThe Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts ringing again. \nDONNY Where you going, Dude? \nDUDE I'm going home, Donny. \nDONNY Your phone's ringing, Dude. \nDUDE Thank you, Donny. \nDUDE'S LIVING ROOM \nThe Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, the other a fresh-faced rookie. \nAt the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping. The Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do: \nDUDE 1972 Pontiac LeBaron. \nYOUNGER COP Color? \nDUDE Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration. \nYOUNGER COP And was there anything of value in the car? \nDULLY: \nDUDE Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase. \nYOUNGER COP In the briefcase? \nDUDE Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers. \nYOUNGER COP And what do you do, sir? \nDUDE I'm unemployed. \nOLDER COP ...Most people, we're working nights, they offer us coffee. \nThere is silence.  Dude continues to stare at a spot on the floor.  The older cop stares at him. \nDUDE ...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer. \nAT LENGTH: \nDUDE ...Also, my rug was stolen. \nYOUNGER COP Your rug was in the car. \nThe Dude taps the floor with his foot. \nDUDE No.  Here. \nYOUNGER COP Separate incidents? \nThe Dude stares at the floor. \nSilence. \nOLDER COP Snap out of it, son. \nThe home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the chirp of the portable.  The Dude makes no move to answer it.   Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks on. \nDUDE You find them much?  Stolen cars? \nDude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in.  Leave a message after the beep.  It takes a minute. \nYOUNGER COP Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes. \nDUDE And the, uh, the briefcase? \nBeep. \nFEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you. Call when you get home and I'll send a car for you.  My name is Maude Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took the rug. \n", "test2_id": 2329, "test3_input": "Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe. \nMAUDE Jeffrey. \nDUDE Maude? \nShe pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches. \nMAUDE Love me. \nThe Dude is stupefied. \nDUDE That's my robe. \nTHOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO: \nBLACK \nAfter a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the blackness: \nMAUDE Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey. \nDUDE Well, uh. . . Not much to tell. \nA match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness except for the glowing tip of the joint. \nDUDE I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement. \nMAUDE Uh-huh. \nDUDE Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven? \nMAUDE Mmnun. \nClick--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie next to each other in bed. \nDUDE And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly. \nMAUDE Oh? \nDUDE Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour. \nMAUDE Uh-huh. \nDUDE Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately. \nMAUDE What do you do for fun? \nDUDE Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback. \nHe climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised. \nMAUDE What happened to your house? \nDUDE Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee. \nMAUDE Finder's fee? \nDUDE He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it. \nMAUDE It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does? \nDUDE Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat. \nHe picks a White Russian off the bedside table. \nMAUDE Jeffrey-- \nDUDE It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just-- \nMAUDE I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any. \nDUDE Huh?  He's fucking loaded. \nMAUDE No no, the wealth was all Mother's. \nDUDE But your father--he runs stuff, he-- \nMAUDE We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it. \nDUDE But he's-- \nMAUDE He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut. \nDUDE Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga? \nThroughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees pulled in. \nMAUDE It increases the chances of conception. \n", "test3_true": "DUDE Increases? \nMAUDE Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games? \nDUDE Well...no, of course not-- \nMAUDE I want a child. \nDUDE Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude-- \nMAUDE Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself. \nDUDE Huh... \nSomething occurs to him. \nDUDE So...that doctor. \nMAUDE Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well? \nThe Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer is absent. \nDUDE No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it! \nMAUDE What? \nThe Dude is leaving the bedroom. \nDUDE Yeah, my thinking about the case, man, it had become uptight.  Yeah. Your father-- \nLIVING ROOM \nThe Dude finishes punching a number into the phone. \nPHONE VOICE This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in; leave a message after the beep. \nFROM THE BEDROOM: \nMAUDE'S VOICE What're you talking about? \nBeep. \nDUDE Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not-- \nWALTER Dude? \nDUDE Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up-- \nWALTER I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas. \nDUDE Huh? \nWALTER Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency. \nDUDE It is a fucking emergency. \nWALTER I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone. \nDUDE THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to-- \nWALTER Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls-- \nDUDE WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM! \nMAUDE'S VOICE Jeffrey? \nTHE DUDE \nHe emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His attention is caught by something down the street. \nHIS POV \nA car is  parked halfway down the block.  We can see the shape of a fat man in the driver's seat. \nTHE DUDE \nStriding purposefully down the street. \nHIS POV \nThe fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over.  More whines and coughs; no start. \nThe man hurriedly fumbles in front of him.  He brings up a newspaper, which he holds before his face. \nTHE DUDE \nAs he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground. He is revved with nervous energy. \n", "test3_id": 2330}

{"test1_input": "Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around. \nLEBOWSKI It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski? \nDUDE Dude. \nLEBOWSKI Huh? \nDUDE I don't know, sir. \nLEBOWSKI Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man? \nDUDE Sure.  That and a pair of testicles. \nLebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost in thought. \nLEBOWSKI You're joking.  But perhaps you're right. \nThe Dude thumps at his chest pocket. \nDUDE Mind if I smoke a jay? \nLEBOWSKI Bunny. \nHe turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks. \nDUDE 'Scuse me? \nLEBOWSKI Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir? \nDUDE Fuckin' A. \nLEBOWSKI Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry. \nHe clears his throat. \nLEBOWSKI I received this fax this morning. \nBrandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the Dude. \nLEBOWSKI As you can see, it is a ransom note. Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play. Men who will not sign their names. Weaklings.  Bums. \nTHE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX: \nWE HAVE BUNNY.  GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON- CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES.  AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.  NO FUNNY STUFF. \nDUDE Bummer. \nLebowski looks soulfully at the Dude. \nLEBOWSKI Brandt will fill you in on the details. \nHe wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire. Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the hall. \nHALLWAY \nThe soprano's singing is once again faint.  Brandt's voice is hushed: \nBRANDT Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money. \nDUDE Why me, man? \nBRANDT He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion. \nDUDE So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh? \nBRANDT Well Dude, we just don't know. \nBOWLING PINS \nCRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion. \nWIDER \nStill in slow motion.  We are looking across the length of the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying perfect form.  He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side. \nFAST TRACK IN \nOn the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler. \nDUDE Fucking Quintana--that creep can roll, man-- \nBACK TO THE BOWLER \nDisplaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's conversation continues over. \nWALTER Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude. \nDUDE Huh? \n", "test1_true": "FLASHBACK \nWe see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater, walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging the bell. \nThe VOICE-OVER conversation continues. \nDUDE Huh. \nWALTER When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast. \nThe door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up. \nDONNY What's a pederast, Walter? \nWALTER Shut the fuck up, Donny. \nPINS \nscattered by a strike. \nQUINTANA \nwheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air. \nStitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his first name, \"Jesus\". \nBACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE \nThey have been joined by Donny. \nWALTER Anyway.  How much they offer you? \nDUDE Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug. \nWALTER Just for making the hand-off? \nDUDE Yeah. \nHe slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket. \nDUDE ...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call-- \nWALTER What if it's during a game? \nDUDE I told him if it was during league play-- \nDonny has been watching Quintana. \nDONNY If what's during league play? \nWALTER Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit. \nDONNY What's wrong with Walter, Dude? \nDUDE I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself. \nWALTER Huh? \nDONNY What do you mean, Dude? \nDUDE Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town-- \nWALTER That...fucking...bitch! \nDUDE It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say-- \nDONNY I am the Walrus. \nWALTER That fucking bitch! \nDUDE Yeah. \nDONNY I am the Walrus. \nWALTER Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov! \nDONNY What the fuck is he talking about? \nWALTER That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK! \nDUDE Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter? \nDONNY Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off? \nWALTER Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet-- \nDUDE I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter. \n", "test1_id": 2328, "test2_input": "Beep.  Dial tone. \nOLDER COP Well, I guess we can close the file on that one. \nTRACKING FORWARD \nWe are moving through the open living area of a large downtown L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant rug. \nWe hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude, standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky depths of the cavernous space. \nSomething huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head. As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass. \nWe see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas. \nThe Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track and haul it back for another push. \nVOICE I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Lebowski. \nShe rumbles by in another pass. \nAll right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro. Help me down. \nThe  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix look. \nDoes the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski? \nDUDE Is that what that's a picture of? \nMAUDE In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina. \nDUDE Oh yeah? \nMAUDE Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his \"dick\" or his \"rod\" or his \"Johnson\". \nDUDE \"Johnson\"? \nMAUDE Thank you. \nThis to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe. \nAll right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give. Now.  As for this. . . \"kidnapping\"-- \nDUDE Huh? \nMAUDE Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven. \nDUDE Right, but let me explain something about that rug-- \nMAUDE Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski? \nDUDE Excuse me? \nMAUDE Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it? \nDUDE I was talking about my rug. \nMAUDE You're not interested in sex? \nDUDE You mean coitus? \nMAUDE I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy. \nDUDE Oh, no. \nMAUDE Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these. \nDUDE Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua? \nMAUDE Take a look at this, sir. \nShe is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen flickers to life.  A title card: \nJACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS \nSECOND CARD: \nKARL HUNGUS \nAND \nBUNNY LAJOYA \nIN \nA THIRD CARD: \nLOGJAMMIN' \nThe Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway to his glass. \n", "test2_true": "On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced man in blue coyer-alls.  It is Dieter, the floater in Lebowski's pool. \nDIETER Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere iss problem mit deine kable. \nDUDE Shit, I know that guy.  He's a nihilist. \nMAUDE And you recognize her, of course. \nThe girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski. \nBunny The TV is in here. \nDIETER Za, okay, I bring mein toolz. \nBunny This is my friend Shari.  She just came over to use the shower. \nMAUDE (grimly) The story is ludicrous. \nDIETER Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to verk in zese clozes-- \nMaude switches off the set. \nMAUDE Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here. \nDUDE He fixes the cable? \nMAUDE Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career \nin pornography, nor that she has been \"banging\" Jackie Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts and-- \nDUDE Shit yeah, the achievers. \nMAUDE Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this \"abduction\", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive \nfornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride. \nDUDE Yeah, but my- \nMAUDE I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to. \nDUDE Well--sure, I could do that-- \nMAUDE If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum. \nDUDE A hundred. \nMAUDE Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them. \nDUDE Yeah, but what about-- \nMAUDE --your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw. \nThe Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has all but disappeared. \nDUDE Oh that's okay, I hardly even-- \nMAUDE Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough. \nDUDE That's really thoughtful but I-- \nMAUDE Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough. \nLIMO \nThe Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery cap a ponytail emerges. \nDRIVER --So he says, \"My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain.\" \nTHROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER: \nDUDE Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony. \nHe takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves milk on his mustache. \nI was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a little  money, I  was down in the dumps. \nTONY Aw, forget about it. \nDUDE Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be worrying about that shit.  Life goes on! \nThe limo has rolled to a stop.  The Dude gets out, still holding his drink. \nTONY Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your friend in the Volkswagon? \nDUDE Huh? \nHis eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his shoulder. \n", "test2_id": 2329, "test3_input": "The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other men are entering behind him. \nThe room is dark now except for spill from the living room; the men are backlit shapes. \nOne of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor. \nThe Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal. \nDUDE Nice marmot. \nThe man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, screaming, into the bathtub. \nThe Dude screams. \nThe marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression. \nFIRST MAN Vee vant zat money, Lebowski. \nThe Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his head and squishes him back into the water. \nSECOND MAN You think veer kidding und making mit de funny stuff? \nTHIRD MAN Vee could do things you only dreamed of, Lebowski. \nSECOND MAN Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.

Must've been a joyride situation; they abandoned the car once they hit the retaining wall. \nThey have reached the Dude's car.  The  driver's side exterior has been scraped raw.  The policeman hands the Dude a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror. \nPOLICEMAN These were on the road next to the car.  You'll have to get in on the other side. \nThe Dude climbs in the passenger side. \nDUDE My fucking briefcase!  It's not here! \nPOLICEMAN Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report. You're lucky they left the tape deck though. \nDUDE My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's that smell? \nPOLICEMAN Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept in the car.  Or perhaps just used it as a toilet, and moved on. \nThe Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will not go; he bellows through the glass: \nDUDE When will you find these guys?  I mean, do you have any promising leads? \nThe policeman laughs, agreeing broadly. \nPOLICEMAN Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with the boys down at the Crime Lab. They've assigned four more detectives to the case, got us working in shifts. \nThe Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by the glass. \nBOWLING ALLEY BAR \nThe Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer nuts. \nDONNY And then they're gonna stamp on it?! \nWALTER Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny. \nDUDE I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off. \n", "test3_true": "DUDE Thanks Walter. \nWALTER Not if I have anything to say about it. \nDUDE (bitterly) Yeah, thanks Walter.

Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis. \nDONNY They were Nazis, Dude? \nWALTER Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration! \nDONNY Uh-huh. \nWALTER Are you gonna split hairs? \nDONNY No-- \nWALTER Am I wrong? \nDONNY Well-- \nDUDE They're nihilists. \nWALTER Huh? \nDUDE They kept saying they believe in nothing. \nWALTER Nihilists!  Jesus. \nWalter looks haunted. \nSay what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos. \nDUDE Yeah. \nWALTER And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either. \nDUDE What're you, a fucking park ranger now? \nWALTER No, I'm-- \nDUDE Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot! \nWALTER --We're sympathizing here, Dude-- \nDUDE Fuck your sympathy!

Fuck you, Walter! \nThere is a moment of stunned silence. \nWALTER Fuck the tournament?! \nSAD; QUIET: \nWALTER Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's go get a lane. \nThey leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.  As he stares \nDOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS: \nDUDE Another Caucasian, Gary. \nVOICE Right, Dude. \nSTILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR: \nDUDE Friends like these, huh Gary. \nGARY That's right, Dude. \nThe pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds.\" \n", "test3_id": 2330}

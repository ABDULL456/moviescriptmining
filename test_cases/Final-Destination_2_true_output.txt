CLEAR Know what this is? 
Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no." 
CLEAR It's you. 
Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable. 
CLEAR Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex. 
ALEX I'm... really sorry. 
CLEAR Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehansible attraction. 
Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens. 
CLEAR (CONT'D) Before that day, you were just another suburban nothing that would never have anything to do with my life. And I'm sure you thought I was some Marilyn Manson body-pierced freak, or whatever. (beat) But at that moment... on the plane... I felt what you felt. I didn't know where all those emotions were coming from until you started freaking out. 
Alex sighs, embarrassed. 
CLEAR (CONT'D) I didn't see what you saw, but I felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that X-Files bullshit... but it was a psychic connection. Why to me? Why to you? 
Jarred, he eyes her, frightened. 
CLEAR And you can still feel it, can't you? Something from that day is still with you. I know, because I can still feel you. 
Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone... 
CLEAR That's why I was there last night. 
ALEX I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere. 
CLEAR "It?" ALEX What if Tod... is just the first... of us? 
The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear. CLEAR Is that something you're "feeling?" 
ALEX I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know. 
CLEAR Then, let's go see him! 
Alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting... 
CUT TO: 
INT. FUNERAL HOME - FOYER - NIGHT 
CAMERA is LOW, moving across the paisley carpet. Dim light, spilling through the stained glass windows, falls upon the creepy decor, appearing as if designed by a morose Laura Ashley, floor model coffins and urns. CAMERA CONTINUES, TILTING UP to the CEILING, REVEALING a stained glass skylight. Outside, on the roof, two silhouettes appear... 
The skylight hinges CRACK open. Clear leads the way. lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window. 
Alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus. Using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet. 
CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex and Clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels. A bronze plaque identifies: "MT. ABRAHAM FUNERAL HOME. THE JOURNEY'S END. WILLIAM BLUDWORTH - INTERMEDIARY." 
CLEAR (whispering) Gives me a rush... 
ALEX This place?! 
CLEAR Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to. 
With a hot, mischievous smile, Clear proceeds toward the hallway. Alex anxiously sighs... then follows. 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT 
An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME. Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor. 
A faint light spills from beneath a doorway. Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand. From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on. 
CLEAR Good call. Very "Quincy." 
Alex tries the doorknob. Locked. He looks at her, defeated. Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart. 
From it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle. He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. CLACK! 
INT. MORGUE - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT 
A lone desk lamp shines. Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod. A sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red. 
As Alex and Clear approach... 
ALEX That... him? 
CLEAR I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson? 
ALEX That's him, but... he's not here. That... whatever... that whatever made him Tod is gone. 
Suddenly, Tod jerks; his hand lifting four inches... 
ALEX                         CLEAR Ahhh! fuck! You fucking		 Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD! asshole. You think this        He's not dead? is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you! 
MR. BLUDWORTH (O.S.) Please don't yell... Both are jolted again with shock, turning toward the voice... 
MR. BLUDWORTH

OLD MAN Yes. But you are to say, "No, thank you." 
Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his lips, but doesn't take a sip. 
OLD MAN Coffee? 
SPOONER No.    Thank you. 
OLD MAN As you wish. 
The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee pot. 
SPOONER You want to tell me something about Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death? 
The Old Man smiles. 
OLD MAN I want to tell you that his death was not a suicide. 
SPOONER And why do you say that? 
OLD MAN Why?   Because I want you to know it. 
SPOONER I understand that. But what specifically leads you to believe that he didn't commit suicide? 
OLD MAN (considers) Nothing specifically. 
Spooner shifts his weight.   Agitated. 
SPOONER Under normal circumstances that wouldn't be enough to get you a homicide investigation. 
OLD MAN But this is not "normal circumstances," is it, Detective Spooner? 
SPOONER No.    It isn't. 
OLD MAN Then you will find out who killed Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you will tell me. 
Spooner's losing his patience. 
SPOONER If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll find out. And you'll be the first to know..... 
JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER. 
15   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                              15 
Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT ROBOT. 
ESCORT ROBOT Please follow me. 
Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief glimpse of... 
DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY. 
Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then continues on. 
16   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  16 
Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom looking out over the entire complex. 
Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically feel the brains and ambition. 
SPOONER Usually I ask who's in charge... 
Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON, founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics. 
SPOONER But everyone knows you, Dr. Robertson. 
Robertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people. 
ROBERTSON Remind me to cut back on my talk show appearances. 
LAUGHTER. 
ROBERTSON Welcome to U.S. Robotics, Detective. I regret you're not visiting us under more pleasant circumstances. Allow me to introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of Legal Affairs. 
A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods hello. 
ROBERTSON And the gentleman to my right is Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of Research. 
Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods. 
ROBERTSON They'll be available to answer any questions you might have during your investigation. You'll understand how anxious we are to resolve this matter -- especially before the press gets wind of it. There are some anti-robot sentiments out there as you know, Detective, and we're not eager to stir them up. So. Where would you like to begin? 
SPOONER We can begin with whether or not the old man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.

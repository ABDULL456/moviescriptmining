You're some sweet punk. You been broke in yet? 
Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey. 
BOGS Hard to get. I like that. 
Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving the three Sisters laughing. 
35	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 35 
Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep. 
36	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36 
Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. Heywood and Jigger pause, watching. 
ANDY (offers his hand) Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. 
Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues. 
RED The wife-killin' banker. 
ANDY How do you know that? 
RED I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd you do it? 
ANDY I didn't, since you ask. 
RED Hell, you'll fit right in, then. (off Andy's look) Everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that? Heywood! What are you in for, boy? 
HEYWOOD Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! 
Red gives Andy a look. See? 
ANDY What else have you heard? 
RED People say you're a cold fish. They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. That true? 
ANDY What do you think? 
RED Ain't made up my mind yet. 
Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. 
ANDY I understand you're a man who knows how to get things. 
RED I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. They seem to fall into my hands. Maybe it's 'cause I'm Irish. 
ANDY I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer? 
RED What is it and why? 
ANDY You make your customers' motives a part of your business? 
RED If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal sort of object. 
ANDY Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks. 
RED Rocks. 
Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red. 
RED Quartz? 
ANDY Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill. 
RED So? 
ANDY I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again, on a limited scale. 
RED Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull? 
ANDY I have no enemies here. 
RED No? Just wait. 
Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them. 
RED Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have. Especially Bogs. 
ANDY Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual? 
RED Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify. (off Andy's look) Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. I'd grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you. 
ANDY Thanks for the advice.

CAPTAIN Collision alarm!  Collision alarm!  Lighten her up, Charlie! 
NAVIGATOR The torpedo room is flooded, sir! 
CAPTAIN Blow all tanks!  Blow everything! 
HELMSMAN Passing twelve hundred feet... 
EXEC Blowing main tanks! 
HELMSMAN Twelve hundred fifty feet... 
EXT. MONTANA                                                            10 
The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section, its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell. 
INT. MONTANA CONTROL ROOM                                               11 
The command crew fights futility for control, everyone shouting and terrified. 
EXEC Main forward tanks ruptured! 
HELMSMAN Passing thirteen hundred feet... 
EXEC Too deep to pump auxiliaries! 
CAPTAIN All back full!  All back full! 
HELMSMAN Answering all back full.  Passing thirteen hundred fifty feet... fourteen hundred... fourteen fifty... 
The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din... 
CAPTAIN We're losing her.  Launch the buoy! 
The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button.  A red light comes on.  The Captains takes a deep breath. 
EXT. MONTANA                                                            12 
A tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent to the surface.  A second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a ledge, tearing open its pressure hull. 
INT. MONTANA                                                            13 
VARIOUS QUICK CUTS, just flashes and impressions, as... Seawater blasts down the corridors -- Explodes across the control room, hurling men like dolls -- Floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds -- Bursts through hatches into the reactor room -- Blasts men OUT OF FRAME in a micro-second. 
EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER                                                   14 
In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull SCREECHING like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur.  Descending in an avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below... a blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of the Cayman Trough.  The abyss. 
EXT. OCEAN SURFACE -- DAY                                               15 
Above, in the world, the Caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky.  The Montana's emergency buoy pops to the surface, transmitting. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OCEAN/20 MILES AWAY -- DAY                                         16 
LONG LENS SHOT: three massive Navy Sea King helicopters thundering straight at us, FILLING FRAME. 
REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER. It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment. 
The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen.  A pantomime in the rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum "company man" KIRKHILL greeting COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander. 
INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/BRIDGE -- DAY                                     17 
The bridge is state-of-the-art, with computers and sophisticated navigation and communications gear, looking like mission control with its bank of video monitors.  The Drilling Operations Supervisor, LELAND MCBRIDE, and BENDIX, the crew chief, watch the invaders swarming the deck below. 
MCBRIDE Does not look good at all. 
TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN (MINUTES LATER) showing divers working in total blackness around some sort of installation on the bottom of the ocean.  They move through the harsh floodlights in dreamlike slow motion, looking like space-suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses. 
DEMARCO (V.O.) No light from the surface.  How deep are they? 
MCBRIDE (V.O.) Seventeen hundred feet. 
WIDER, showing the Navy contingent crowding the control room.  DeMarco is hardcore military, brusque and efficient.  Kirkhill is a small man with pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means company man and/or dickhead. 
DEMARCO I need them to go to over two thousand. 
KIRKHILL They can do it. (to McBride) Get Brigman on the line. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY (TOTAL DARKNESS)                                 18 
1700 FEET BELOW.  A submersible oil-drilling platform, DEEPCORE II, an island of light in the vast blackness.  Its main framework connects two "tri- modules" consisting of three cylinders each.  These contain living and work areas in a pressurized environment.  An umbilical cable, thick as a man's thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer at the surface.  In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or "toolpusher," BUD BRIGMAN.  He's talking (via headset) with two divers working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER. 
BUD Hey, you guys are milking that job.

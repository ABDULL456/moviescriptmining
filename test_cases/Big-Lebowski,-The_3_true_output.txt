DIETER I haff lingenberry pancakes. 
KIEFFER Lingenberry pancakes. 
FRANZ Sree picks in blanket. 
The woman speaks to Dieter in German.  He nods. 
DIETER Lingenberry pancakes. 
WALTER'S CAR 
Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from the back seat. 
DUDE I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh? 
WALTER Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh. 
DUDE I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back. 
WALTER What's your point, Dude? 
DUDE His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer! 
WALTER Yeah? 
DUDE Shit yeah! 
WALTER Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency? 
DUDE Huh? 
WALTER I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death-- 
DUDE Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're-- 
WALTER What the fuck are you talking about? 
DUDE You're fucking Polish Catholic-- 
WALTER What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude! 
DUDE Yeah, and you were-- 
WALTER You know this! 
DUDE And you were divorced five fucking years ago. 
WALTER Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish? 
DUDE This driveway. 
AS HE TURNS: 
WALTER I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye 
DUDE It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past. 
WALTER Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened? 
He is looking off as the car slows.  The Dude looks where Walter is looking. 
THE LEBOWSKI MANSION 
Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he and the Dude get out. 
Both are gaping off at the front lawn. 
WALTER Jesus Christ. 
THEIR POV 
Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a palm trunk. 
TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY 
Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny, naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing into the illuminated pool outside.  Heavy metal music filters in from a boom box by the pool. 
Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the length of the hall. 
BRANDT He can't see you, Dude. 
We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to the great study.  Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its tail. 
DUDE Where'd she been? 
BRANDT Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.

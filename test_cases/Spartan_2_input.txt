He hesitates for a moment. We hear another explosion, he nods, as if to say "That's what we're waiting for", and passes her out of the window, and begins lowering her to the ground. 
ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Laura, on the rope, reaching the ground. 
ANGLE INT. THE ROOM. Scott, as he turns to the sound of the door opening, two men come through the door, and he shoots them. 
ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Scott puts Laura into the SUV and gets behind the driver's seat. He puts the car in gear, and it begins to drive off. 
ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Laura turns to face him. 
LAURA ...they said they were going to take care of me... 
SCOTT I'm going to take care of you. You hold on, now. (as Scott drives he reloads his weapons) 
LAURA (lazily) Who are you? 
SCOTT ...you remember, Baby, we went to high school together... (pause) You dropped your earring. 
She shakes her head. Drugged. Trying to make sense of the proceedings. 
SCOTT You're Picasso, right...? That's who you are... 
He draws the Picasso sign on the windshield, she looks at it, having trouble focusing. 
LAURA ...they're going to send me to a Party. 
SCOTT No, Baby, you're going Home. (pause) You're just taking the long way home. 
ANGLE EXT. THE CAR. Moving through the streets. The airport just becoming visible in the background. 
INT. BARE ROOM. DUBAI. NIGHT. 
Laura, asleep, at a small cardtable. Out of the window we see an expanse of desert and scrub. Her head is down. Scott enters the room, he moves a chair in front of the door, moves to Laura, and manhandles her to a small cot, and closes the shutters to the window. 
SCOTT ...I told you to stay on the bed. 
We see her wake and look around, trying to place herself. 
ANGLE on Scott, as he takes out a notebook and begins to make notes in it. 
SCOTT ...you're going travelling. 
LAURA ...what...? 
SCOTT ...we're going to take a little trip. 
She takes out a crumpled pack of cigarettes, and extracts the last one. She takes out a match. 
SCOTT ...put that away. 
LAURA ...I need a smoke. 
SCOTT Y'can't smoke it. American tobacco. Smell. Carry. In the desert air. 
He looks down his list, and nods. He takes a bandana from his pocket and hands it to her. 
SCOTT Put that on. Over your head. 
LAURA Whatsamatter, you don't like Blondes...? 
SCOTT Whole world likes Blondes. That's why you're here. Put the bandana on. 
LAURA (as she tries to light the cigarette) I need a smoke. (He takes it away from her, and crumbles it.) ...gimme the fucken smoke. 
He shushes her, and moves to the window. 
ANGLE, EXT. The window. The first gleam of dawn. And, far off, a Muezzin is heard chanting morning prayers. Laura moves toward him, unbuttoning her blouse. 
LAURA I could make you give me the smoke. 
He slaps her lightly in the face. 
SCOTT Keep it together. (he takes a small hypodermic kit) Keep it together, or I'm gonna give you a shot and carry you out. 
She reacts violently to the sight of the needle. Beat. Then, she sits on the bed and cries self-pityingly. 
LAURA Nobody Cares about me... 
Hold. On Scott. And we take him back to a small shelf near the door. He takes down what we see is an ashtray, overfull with yellow-brown cigarette butts. He takes the ashtray to the small table, takes out his knife, and begins shredding the butts, and gathering the tobacco into a pile. 
SCOTT ...that's right...

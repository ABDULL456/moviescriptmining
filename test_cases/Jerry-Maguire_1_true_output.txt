They approach the Reptile House, where a small crowd is gathered. 
JERRY (continuing) -- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of... 
RAY I'm scared.  What is it? 
JERRY It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of... 
A few people peel away, revealing... 
JERRY (continuing) The Two-Headed Corn Snake. 
THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE 
A friendly but confused looking reptile.  The snake has two heads, both identical, both twisting and battling each other for direction.  Aw-ed chatter around the animal ranges from "weird" and "wow" to "mira mira!  Dos cabezas!"  Few can turn away. 
RAY Whoa. 
DOROTHY (quietly) Two heads.  My God... 
Jerry is happy to play tour-guide. 
JERRY Both heads have brains.  Both heads eat, both heads battle for direction all day long. (meaningful) Man, can I relate. 
The odd animal moves forward, fighting itself constantly. 
RAY Me too. 
Dorothy just looks at the two men in her life.  She turns to Anonymous Man standing nearby, staring at the animal. 
DOROTHY Is this a guy thing? 
ANONYMOUS MAN It is, and it isn't. 
ON THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE 
strangely endearing, jittering and moving around the cage. 
EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT YARD -- DAY 
A U-Haul is parked in the driveway.  Inside the cab, a very sad Ray.  Jerry approaches carefully.  Ray does not look at him.  He opens the door, scoots the kid over, and sits next to him. 
EXT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY 
Laurel and Dorothy say goodbye. 
LAUREL You're doing the right thing. I mean, come on.  You need to start your life and he... he needs a warm body to cushion the fall. Check out exhibit A on the front lawn -- 
POV -- THE SISTERS 
We see Jerry, following Chad back to the house, saying goodbye too many times. He's anxious not to be left alone. Finally Chad grabs him by the shoulders, says goodbye, as a sad Ray trudges to the cab of the U-Haul.  Jerry now follows Ray to the car. 
EXT. DOROTHY'S PLACE -- DAY 
Jerry scoots a very sad Ray over, and talks to him in the car. 
JERRY I'm not good at this. 
Ray begins to cry. Jerry is incapable of dealing with it. 
JERRY (continuing) I'll see you this weekend, okay? Promise. 
Ray wails.  Jerry squeezes his shoulder, it does nothing, so he exits. He rises and faces Dorothy, keys in hand. 
JERRY (continuing) Sure you're okay to drive this? 
DOROTHY This rig? Phht.  No problem. 
JERRY So I'll see you this weekend. 
She accepts it casually, with a shrug. 
DOROTHY Airight, so goodbye and -- (simple, with shrug) I love you. 
Jerry blinks. 
JERRY (too quick, weirdly) ... I love you too, you know. 
She reacts with an odd look.  The words don't sound right, and he knows that she knows. 
JERRY (continuing) What -- 
DOROTHY Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever... (beat) Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it. 
He shudders a little with the intimacy of her words.  She kisses him, and moves quickly toward the car, leaving him alone in frame. He grows increasingly uncomfortable.  He watches her leave. 
JERRY Wait a second. 
ON DOROTHY

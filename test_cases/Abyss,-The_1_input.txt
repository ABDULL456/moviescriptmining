TITLE: THE ABYSS -- ON BLACK, DISSOLVING TO COBALT BLUE 
EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER -- DAY                                            3 
Blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down. PROPELLER SOUND.  Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine. 
INT. U.S.S. MONTANA -- DAY                                              4 
In the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat in the glow of their instruments.  The SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around BARNES, the sonarman. 
CAPTAIN Sixty knots?  No way, Barnes... the reds don't have anything that fast. 
BARNES Checked it twice, skipper.  It's a real unique signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise... doesn't even sound like screws. 
He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING.  The captain studies the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an amorphous trace, representing the bogey. 
CAPTAIN What the hell is it? 
EXEC I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of ours. 
BARNES Sir!  Contact changing heading to two-one-four, diving.  Speed eighty knots!  Eighty knots! 
EXEC Eighty knots... 
BARNES Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet. 
FRANK (simultaneously) Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet. 
Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the intruder.  The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side- scan sonar array.  The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls. 
EXEC (low, to Captain) It's getting tight in here. 
CAPTAIN We can still give him a haircut.  Helm, come right to oh six niner, down five degrees. 
HELMSMAN Coming right to oh six niner, sir.  Down five degrees. 
NAVIGATOR Port side clearance one hundred twenty feet narrowing to seventy-five.  Sir, we have a proximity warning light. 
EXEC That's too damn close!  We've gotta back off. 
BARNES Range to contact, two hundred.  Contact junked to bearing two six oh and accelerated to... one hundred thirty knots, sir! 
EXEC (really freaked now) Nothing goes one thirty! 
Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness. 
EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     5 
We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes rapidly under the sub's hull.  Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways. 
INT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     6 
The bride crew are knocked off their feet, as the ship is buffeted. 
EXEC Turbulence!  We're in its wake! 
SIRENS.  Everyone shouting at once.  The power flickers low. 
CAPTAIN Helm, all stop!  Full right rudder! 
HELMSMAN All stop.  Full right rudder.  Hydraulic failure. Planes are not responding, sir! 
Power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side-scan display... AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE THEM. 
HELMSMAN Hydraulics restored, sir. 
EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     7 
The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with nightmarish slow-motion.  The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping along and bouncing off.  One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG! 
INT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM                                               8 
With the outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting the inner hatches.  Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods, blast into the room.  Everything vanishes instantly in white spray. 
INT. CONTROL RM/ATTACK CENTER                                           9

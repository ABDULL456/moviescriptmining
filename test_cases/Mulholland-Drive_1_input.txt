He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the blonde girl. He shakes her hand. 
ADAM (cont'd) Thank you very much, Carol. It was really great of you to come in. I know how busy you are. 
CAROL Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this script! Where do I sign? 
ADAM Look... I love you, but there's no way they're gonna let me cast this thing until I've seen everyone. I'll let you know as soon as I can. 
CAROL I know you will ... cause my manager's gonna bug you day and night ... me too. 
ADAM It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of here. 
CAROL Oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget me. I'm the girl that's going to play this part. 
ADAM (lightly pinching her cheek) See ya later. 
Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor. He looks around. He sees Betty being introduced by Sarah to some of the studio executives. He goes over to his Assistant Director and looks down at the man's notepad. 
ADAM (cont'd) Who's next, Hank? 
HANK Camilla Rhodes. 
Adam wonders - worries. 
ADAM Is she ready? 
HANK All ready. 
ADAM Bring her out. 
Hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. The sound of his voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage. 
HANK (through walkie-talkie) Camilla Rhodes next! 
Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up singers step in behind her. 
Adam nods to Hank. 
HANK (cont'd) Turn over! 
The cameraman calls out, "Speed". 
ADAM (through megaphone) Playback! 
Countdown before the music begins. 
ADAM (cont'd) ACTION! 
The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing. 
On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches. Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers. This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment. She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and pulls Hank over to him. 
HANK Yeah? 
Adam pauses. 
ADAM Get Jason over here. 
Hank gets on his walkie-talkie. 
HANK Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.

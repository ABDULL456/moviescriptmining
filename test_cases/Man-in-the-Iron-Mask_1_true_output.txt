D'ARTAGNAN 
famous Musketeer, Captain of the King's Royal Bodyguard.  He is still handsome at mid-life, still erect, unambiguous in his courage and his loyalty. 
He rides past a knot of angry beggars, moving through the streets breaking windows and scavenging for food.  When they see d'Artagnan, some throw rocks at him.  They sail by d'Artagnan's head; he ducks them with the fluid grace of a boxer dodging punches, and keeps on riding. 
OUTSIDE THE CATHEDRAL 
D'Artagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence beside Notre Dame Cathedral.  Priests are dispensing food to beggars gathered in the courtyard.  As d'Artagnan reins his horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at the royal symbols on his uniform.  But d'Artagnan is not a man anyone would be quick to confront; as he dismounts and moves toward the doorways the people part for him. 
He pauses as he sees, parked to one side of the old residence, a big rickety carriage.  D'Artagnan smiles. 
D'ARTAGNAN Porthos too! 
D'Artagnan hears drunken feminine giggles echoing down the staircase of the tower above him. 
INT.  PRIESTS' RESIDENCE - A STAIRWAY - DAY 
Four people are moving up a winding stairway; three are women, bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses; the fourth is PORTHOS, the former Musketeer, now a nobleman of great wealth and even greater girth.  He and the women are drinking wine as they stagger up the stairs, the women towing Porthos like rowboats tugging a ship to dock.  Porthos is not so drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip their bodies as they walk and giggle. 
PORTHOS Ah ha!  Here we are!  Aramis! Porthos is here! 
They reach a doorway.  Porthos kicks it open, staggers back, and begins shoving the women inside. 
INT.  A PRIEST'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The first of the partying women tumbles inside; she stops short at what she sees.  The second and third stumble in after her and they too stop dead still, sobered by what they see.  Then with a great roar Porthos barrels in. 
PORTHOS Aaaaaaaramis!!  Porthos is -- 
He stops dead in his tracks.  From the POV OF PORTHOS AND THE WOMEN, we see ARAMIS.  Always the most theological of the Musketeers, and ruthlessly brilliant, he is still lean and powerful.  And still handsome, or at least he would be; but now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar, wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer. 
PORTHOS Sorry, my dears.  You would have enjoyed it too.  He's hung like a donkey. 
WENCH 1 So are you. 
PORTHOS Really?  I haven't been able to see it for fifteen years.  Go on now, leave His Holiness alone.  I'll bring you back tomorrow when he's in a better mood. 
He whacks their bottoms, herding them out, then swaggers to Aramis, heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend. 
PORTHOS Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone -- 
ARAMIS Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying? 
PORTHOS I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes. 
ARAMIS (trying to ignore him) There are more important things than tits. 
PORTHOS Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral. 
Aramis is still trying to pray, but rises to the bait. 
ARAMIS Forgiveness. 
PORTHOS Forgiveness? 
As if in reply, Porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart. 
PORTHOS (beat) Forgive me. 
Aramis' fingers clamp down on the rosary beads, as he tries to keep praying. 
PORTHOS Am I forgiven? 
Aramis abruptly backhands his huge friend.  Porthos reels backwards, landing in a chair. 
PORTHOS I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple. 
ARAMIS Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?! 
Porthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls. Aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it; Porthos picks up the whole table -- just as d'Artagnan enters. 
PORTHOS AND ARAMIS D'Artagnan. 
Porthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs d'Artagnan. 
PORTHOS How are you, you skinny little pup! 
Aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment. 
ARAMIS A simple theological discussion. 
D'ARTAGNAN Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.

GRANDPA CLIFF Good.   Good to see you. 
DAD Ah, it's great to see you. 
GRANDPA CLIFF You made it alright, huh? 
DAD Yeah, we sure did.    We sure did. 
GRANDPA CLIFF (to Annie) How are you, darling? 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Annie and Nana quietly light the candles on Mason's birthday cake. 
DAD Alright, we ready? 
ANNIE Yeah, yeah, get started -- 
NANA Wait, wait, wait... 
INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY 
DAD Hey, Sam. 
He subtly indicates for her to get off her laptop and join the family. They take their seats in the living room. 
DAD (CONT'D) Hey, still sleeping here? 
GRANDPA CLIFF Oh, yeah, sawin' logs. 
DAD You ready? 
The family sings happy birthday to Mason. Nana brings in the birthday cake, complete with lit candles. 
ALL (singing) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Mason... Happy birthday to you! 
DAD Make a wish, make a wish. 
Mason blows out the candles. The family cheers. 
NANA Real good! Presents!      Wait, wait, wait. Here, sweetie. 
Nana hands Mason a wrapped gift. 
DAD Hey Sam, would you get us a knife so we can cut this up? Hey? Alright. 
Sam walks into the kitchen to grab a knife. 
NANA I hope you like it. I heard you didn't have one, so. 
He unwraps the gift. 
NANA (CONT'D) It's a Bible. Is this your first Bible? Look, there's your name... 
MASON Wow. 
NANA ...In gold. And wait-wait-wait-wait. Look at this. It's a Red Letter edition, and that means that everything Jesus said is in red. 
MASON Thank you. 
NANA Like it?     Alright. I love you, sweetie.     Happy Birthday. 
ANNIE And this one's from us. 
Annie hands Mason a large gift box. 
DAD It's not going to make all your dreams come true, here, you know. Just keep your expectations low. No, no, no, no, you need it. It's... 
Dad pulls a blue dress shirt, blazer, and tie out of the box. 
DAD (CONT'D) It's -- hey! Come, on right? You gotta have it. You need this. 
NANA Wow! 
DAD You've got life ahead of you.   You know -- 
ANNIE And the shirt is blue, and I know you like blue. 
DAD You've got dances -- 
NANA It's beautiful! 
DAD -- And job interviews. Here, I'm going to get it all wrinkled here. 
Grandpa comes out of the kitchen with a covered gun. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Mason? 
DAD (whispers) The Black Album was from me. 
NANA Uh-oh. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Come here, son. Pull that off. 
Mason walks over and pulls the case off to reveal a shotgun. 
GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D) There's a 20 gauge shotgun. 
MASON Wow. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Yeah. My dad gave it to me when I was a little younger than you, and his dad gave it to him, and well, you're fifteen and I'd like for you to have it. Alright? Here, you hold it. Yeah. 
MASON (taking the gun) Thank you. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Congratulations, son. I'll teach you how to clean it, teach you how to fire it. I'll teach you a little bit of safety. 
The family laughs, as Mason holds the gun pointing precariously across the room. 
EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY 
Samantha holds a pistol, ready to shoot. Dad is helping her aim. There are bottles and cans lined up as targets. 
DAD Now cock it. Alright, there you go. Now, what you want to do is line up the front sight with the back sight, here, you see this little V right here -- 
SAMANTHA Mm-hm. 
DAD Now which one you aiming at? 
SAMANTHA Ah, the middle can. 
DAD The middle can? Alright, alright. Now fire at will, alright? 
SAMANTHA Okay. 
Samantha shoots the can. 
DAD Ho.   Whoa! 
Dad claps as Samantha lowers the pistol. 
SAMANTHA Yeah! 
GRANDPA CLIFF Howdy!

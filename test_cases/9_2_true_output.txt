(RUEFULLY) Yes. The ones we're not supposed to ask. 
They exchange a look. This is the first time 5 has said something to actually challenge 1's rules. 9 notices this and nods.

The wind howls louder. 5 looks at his map uncertainly and tries to keep leading them forward. 
They come to a field full of trip mines and dangerous tank trap pits.   A parachute blows in the wind on a tree branch. 
5 turns the map one way and the other with growing panic. 
here are we? 
(MISERABLY) I don't know... 
As he turns the map to look at it, the wind picks up and blows the map out of 5's hands. It blows away into the distance and gets stuck on a pole. 
5 reaches after it desperately but can't retrieve it.      He looks in despair at 9. 
(CONT'D) It's no use.      We should go back! 
We can't. 
9 looks around bravely, then points over towards a trench. 
9 (CONT'D) There. 
They head over to the trench.      They now see a huge FOOTPRINT OF THE BEAST. 
They inspect the footprints. 9 moves bravely towards the trench entrance. 5 resists, afraid.

can't help himself. He pulls the lightbulb out, pulls out a battery and electrical wire from his chest, winds the wire around the battery and places it inside the hat. 
They screw the lightbulb and it LIGHTS UP.    5 can't help smiling at 9. 
unwinds the wire holding the blade on 2's staff. He places 2's hat on the end of 2's staff and secures it with the blade.   5 nods, intrigued. 
Yes... yes... good.... 
He sees that 9 now has made a LIGHTSTAFF.    He blurts out: 
5 (CONT'D) 2 will be so impressed!

BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE 
SLOW DOLLY up to Tim. Choking, gurgling. His eyes are open, but rolled up. His hand limply reaches up...then drops. 
Sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue our SLOW DOLLY into Tim's eyes. 
They GLAZE OVER...the choking stops. And a HAND reaches into frame and pulls the puffer fish out of Tim's mouth. 
REVEAL JEAN looking petrified at the close call, looking around to make sure nobody saw... 
EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER 
Nora and Tim, feeling better now, walk past the CONSTRUCTION CREW. A CRANE OPERATOR smiles at Tim, who smiles back. 
From across the mall, the tiny running figures of Kimberly and Thomas appear in the dis tance, pointing and screaming. 
TIM What are they doing here? And why are they yelling "pigeons"? 
Just then, Tim and Nora walk into a large cluster of PIGEONS who suddenly burst into flight, startling the Crane Operator, whose hand inadvertently jerks a lever - 
A METALLIC CHAIN RATTLE fills the air and Tim looks up just as a HUGE SHEET OF GLASS PLUMMETS downward toward him and CRUSHES him, his mangled body visible underneath. 
As two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk, NORA SCREAMS. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER 
Emergency vehicles everywhere. Thomas seems exhausted as he walks back to Kimberly, who stands by his car. In the BG, EMTs load a stretcher into an ambulance. 
THOMAS (shaking his head) Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son. 
KIMBERLY We have to tell her she's in danger! 
THOMAS (sadly) I did. And right now, I don't think she cares. 
EXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Thomas' car turns into the driveway and parks. Kimberly holds up her hand and watches it tremble. 
KIMBERLY It's happening again.   It's fucking 
happening again. I hoped we'd get there and they'd be okay, that Clear Rivers was full of shit and Evan's death was just a freak accident... 
Thomas kills the engine to listen. 
KIMBERLY But we're all going to die. We can't stop it. It's just a matter of time. I'm so scared. 
Thomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly. 
THOMAS I am too. But you can use that fear. It'll sharpen your instincts. Keep you alert fro signs. It's the only way you'll be able to sav e the others...and me. 
Kimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back. Thomas senses he's losing her, and softens her approach. 
THOMAS I know you didn't ask for any of this, Kimberly. But I don't think you have it in you to quit either. 
Kimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in. BANG! A startling pound on the roof of Thomas' car. 
Kimberly jumps, then spins around to see: 
CLEAR RIVERS - standing in the driveway. A determined, powerful presence. Kimberly exits the car. A MOMENT where Kimberly and Clear stare each other down. 
KIMBERLY Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear. 
Clear nods absently to Thomas, still focused on Kimberly. 
KIMBERLY (bitter) The second one just dies.   A 16 year old kid. 
CLEAR (nods; a faint trace of guilt) I hope you're ready for this. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 
Thomas' car pulls into a partially filled parking lot. Kimberly, Thomas and Clear file out and head to the door. 
KIMBERLY This is cheery. 
THOMAS Who is this guy, anyway? 
CLEAR A mortician. He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us. 
THOMAS Should we knock? 
CLEAR (looking ill) He probably already knows we're coming. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

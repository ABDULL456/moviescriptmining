WEINSTOCK He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business. 
SAL, a little desperate. 
SAL Look, the stuff is here.  We could set up the switch in an hour.  I'm tellin' you, Mr. Weinstock, he'll split if we don't move.  This guy is everything they say he is. 
WEINSTOCK taking SAL apart with his eyes over the cigar.

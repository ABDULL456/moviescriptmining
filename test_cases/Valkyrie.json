{"train": "VALKYRIE \nWritten by \nChristopher McQuarrie & Nathan Alexander \nJanuary 8, 2007 \nI swear by God this sacred oath: \nThat I shall render unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, the F\u00fchrer of the German Reich, and that I shall at all times be prepared, as a brave soldier, to give my life for this oath. \n1   BLACK                                                   1 \nAnd from out of the blackness a voice. A man speaking in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio. Subtitles translate the voice of Adolf Hitler. \nHITLER (V.O.) My comrades. Once again - I don't know how many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life. I speak to you tonight for two reasons. First, so that you can hear my voice and know that I am unhurt. And second, so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in German history... \n2   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                     2 \nTITLES: SMOLENSK, RUSSIA - THE GERMAN EASTERN FRONT. 13 MARCH 1943. \nA lonely airfield. A NAZI OFFICER and his AIDE stand rigid by a gleaming limousine. The officer's uniform denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight. \nTITLES: MAJOR-GENERAL HENNING VON TRESCKOW - CHIEF OF STAFF FOR ARMY GROUP CENTER. \nTresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only movement in the frame. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie. Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp. \nApproaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200 Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109 fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors come to rest and, needing no introduction: \nADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS. \n(Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.) \nTresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler, but they are pushed back by SS guards. The F\u00fchrer marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or their waiting limo. \nTo Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive. Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off. \nVOICE (O.S.) It's not so much your car he doesn't trust... It's your driver. \nTresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is: \nTITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION. \nThe consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops into the limo they brought for Hitler. \nTresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car. \n3   EXT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - DAY                              3 \nEst. Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is bustling. Security is tight, everyone is on edge. \n4   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - MESS HALL - DAY                  4 \nLong tables packed with SOLDIERS straining their necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head table, but he is obscured by his detail of SS guards. ONE MAN dares to approach. The room falls silent. \nHITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the F\u00fchrer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite. We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly, deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die. When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of the room relaxes slightly and digs in. \nANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt, eating like a pig, still making notes in his book. Tresckow stares. \nTRESCKOW Managing the F\u00fchrer's security must be quite an undertaking. \nBRANDT (in between mouthfuls) Irregularity is the F\u00fchrer's precaution of choice. \nTRESCKOW I can assure you he's safe here. Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal. \nBrandt's look says, \"Don't be ridiculous.\" He cleans his plate in seconds. Then he gently dabs his mouth, takes out his datebook and starts writing - once again the precise man we saw on the airfield. \nTRESCKOW (CONT'D) I understand you're returning to Berlin this afternoon... \nBrandt nods. \nTRESCKOW (CONT'D) Could I trouble you to deliver a package to Colonel Stieff? \nBrandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide... \nDOCTOR Perhaps before you see the Colonel we should go to my office and- \nNINA I will see my husband now. \nThe Doctor wants to argue but Nina's eyes shut him down. He opens the door and they enter to find: \n16   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                         16 \nA mass of mummy-like bandages with only small openings around the mouth and one eye. The arms and hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing. No movement but for the rise and fall of the patient's chest. \nBerthold cannot look. Holding back her anguish, Nina bravely turns to the Doctor. \"Well?\" \nDOCTOR He's been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers. The right hand has been amputated above the wrist. He's lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. We... couldn't save the left eye. \nBerthold covers his face. Nina is a rock. \nNINA His ring. \nDOCTOR I don't- \nNINA He had a ring on his right hand. Where is it? \nDOCTOR I'm sorry... His hand was amputated in the field... I'm afraid- \nNINA Thank you. \nAs in: \"That will be all.\" The Doctor leaves. Nina sits beside her husband. She shows him a photo of FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN - three boys and a girl. \nStauffenberg tries to speak but can't. His eye begins to tear. \nNina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a chain with a cross she takes from around her neck. It is identical to the ring Stauffenberg wore in Africa. \nCLOSE ON: The engraving inside the band - finis- initium [end-beginning]. Nina places the ring and chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering. She cannot hold the tears back any longer. She stands and turns away, not wanting her husband to see. \nBerthold takes her place. Stauffenberg struggles to speak. Berthold puts an ear to the hole where Stauffenberg's mouth is - making out his question, even if we can't. Berthold debates answering, then: \nBERTHOLD We've lost North Africa. \nCLOSE ON: That one eye staring at us closes. \n17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER                          17 \nStauffenberg's bandages are gone - a black patch covering what had been his left eye. The chain with the cross and ring from Nina hangs around his neck. \nANOTHER PATIENT lies motionless in the next bed. \nA man's belongings tell you more about him than he ever could. Stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly arranged, books of poetry and philosophy are well worn. Beside them are his own writings - the print meticulous and flowing. Up to a certain date. After that a new, child-like hand has taken over. \nA family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of another generation - wealthy aristocrats from a bygone era. He is a teenager in this photo and smiling broadly. A smile he left in Africa. \nStauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under his eyepatch to dab the empty socket. Then he goes to button his shirt. Holding his collar in his teeth, he tries to do the buttons with the use of only three fingers on his left hand. It is heartbreaking to watch. \nHe is about to give up when he notices a figure looming in the doorway. General Olbricht. He winces at the sight of Stauffenberg's deformities. \nSTAUFFENBERG I don't know what I ever did with ten. \nOlbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but Stauffenberg beats him to it. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) I'm wanted in Berlin. \nOlbricht nods. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Are you asking as a member of the High Command? \nOlbricht contemplates his answer. He carefully closes the door behind him, nervously glancing at the patient in the next bed. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) You can speak openly, General. He died just before you came in. \nAwkward moment. Finally: \nOLBRICHT We could use your help. \nSTAUFFENBERG I'm a field officer. \nOlbricht steps closer, speaking openly now. \nOLBRICHT This war can't be won in the field. \nThe city sleeps. An unsettling image knowing that, in war, quiet can turn to chaos in the blink of an eye. \n21   INT. TOWNHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT                            21 \nSoft knocking at the front door is further muffled by heavy black-out curtains. A YOUNG OFFICER enters the frame, dousing the lights, parting the curtains and opening the door to reveal a SHADOWY FIGURE on the stoop. \nThe figure steps into the half light to reveal his fresh scars and eye-patch. And from the dark quiet of the foyer we CUT TO: \n22   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                 22 \nChaos. The air is thick with cigar smoke and harsh words. A DOZEN MEN - some officers, some civilians - are fighting bitterly, everyone talking at once. Stauffenberg enters unnoticed, escorted in by the YOUNG OFFICER who immediately ducks out again. \nStauffenberg scans the faces in the room. We recognize Olbricht and Tresckow. With them we find... \nA distinguished gentleman in his early sixties: \nTITLES: ERWIN VON WITZLEBEN - FORMER FIELD MARSHAL OF THE MILITARY DISTRICT. FORCED OUT BY HITLER, 1938. \nBeside him is a rough-hewn, charismatic man despite his 59 years. A face millions might follow. He is: \nTITLES: DR. CARL GOERDELER - FORMER MAYOR OF LEIPZIG. RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1937. \nAnd finally, a grandfatherly sort with surprisingly kind eyes, sitting outside the fight - tired and saddened by it. \nTITLES: LUDWIG BECK - FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE GERMAN ARMY. RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1938. \nWITZLEBEN ...He is not a man, he's a lunatic. He doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck. He has no weakness to exploit, no vice to manipulate. His only passion is complete control. How can you expect to reason with him? \nGOERDELER After this most recent failure I'd say we've no other choice. \nWITZLEBEN Confront Hitler now and you'll end up with piano wire for a neck-tie. Our only option is the central solution. \nGOERDELER He's a man like any other. Flesh and blood. Take him head on and- \nTRESCKOW I'll say this for you, Doctor... You're certainly delusional enough to take Hitler's place. \nGOERDELER (eyes narrowing) When that day comes, I'll be sure to remember you. \nTRESCKOW I doubt you'll remember much of anything. \nGOERDELER Dammit, Tresckow- \nAnd the shouting resumes. It is Beck who finally sees Stauffenberg. He touches Tresckow's arm. He, in turn, nudges Olbricht and so on. A moment later, the room is silent, all eyes on the Colonel. Everyone is a little embarrassed. Olbricht clears his throat: \nOLBRICHT Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned to my office at the War Ministry. (to Stauffenberg) Colonel, may I introduce- \nSTAUFFENBERG These men need no introduction. \nBeck stands, shaking Stauffenberg's hand. \nBECK I apologize for this unfortunate... spectacle. On behalf of everyone, welc- \nBut before he can finish, Beck is seized with a gravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill through the room. He is very ill. \nGOERDELER (to the others) I haven't welcomed him. Not yet. Where does he stand? \nTRESCKOW For God's sake- \nGOERDELER (re: Stauffenberg) He's a field officer. He knows the army better than any of us. I want to hear his opinion. \nTRESCKOW (to Stauffenberg) All right. What do you think, Colonel? Confront Hitler, force him to resign? Or the central solution? \nBut before Stauffenberg can answer: \nGOERDELER \"Central Solution.\" You soldiers are all the same. Say what you mean. \nWITZLEBEN That's a laugh coming from a politician. \nGOERDELER The army will follow diplomats before they follow assassins. \nTRESCKOW They follow a butcher now. What difference does it- \nSTAUFFENBERG What makes you think the army will follow you at all? \nThe room quiets down. Beck hides a slight smile. He likes Stauffenberg already. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Oust him, kill him. That isn't what matters. How do you plan to take control of the government when Hitler is gone? \nSTAUFFENBERG What are you trying to say? \nBERTHOLD I seem to remember you telling me about reports from the Ukraine - the SS forcing Jews to dig their own graves. You said then that Hitler should be removed. An officer's duty, you said. What's changed? \nSTAUFFENBERG I said senior officers. The only men that can get to him. \nBERTHOLD Perhaps it doesn't matter that you succeed. \nStauffenberg looks at Berthold like he is crazy, but: \nBERTHOLD (CONT'D) Perhaps it only matters that you try. Don't you see? Someone has to stand up and show the world that not all of us were like him. \nSTAUFFENBERG Even if they could remove Hitler, they can't hope to seize power. For God's sake, they have no plan. \nBERTHOLD Then give them one. Find a way. \nHe puts a hand on Stauffenberg's arm. \nBERTHOLD (CONT'D) Evil happens when good men do nothing. \nBefore Stauffenberg can answer, new music comes blasting from the phonograph O.S. The unmistakable sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. \nSTAUFFENBERG Children, that is far too- \nHe is cut off by the appearance of his four children, all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets, pots for helmets and brandishing makeshift swords. They charge into the room, singing loudly and attacking their father. He does his best to defend himself with one hand. Their commotion causes the phonograph to skip. \nAnd you'd think that's where it ends. We even pull back, creating that effect. It takes a moment to notice the wailing sound we're suddenly hearing is not on the phonograph. Nina hears it first, then Stauffenberg and Berthold. Finally the children freeze and the phonograph skips without their help. The glasses on the table rattle. \nNow we hear the wailing quite clearly. A siren. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Air-raid. \nThe adults herd the children out of the room. Muffled concussions cause the phonograph to skip frequently, turning Wagner's masterpiece into a stutter. \n28   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BASEMENT - NIGHT               28 \nThe family rushes down the stairs, huddling in a corner - adults holding shivering children. The bombs are closer, louder. The Wagner, the siren, the explosions fray the nerves. \nStauffenberg reaches for Nina in the darkness, finding her belly. Her hand clamps around his - around their unborn child. \nBOOM. So close the children scream. Dust and debris fall from the ceiling. The needle rakes the phonograph upstairs going back to the beginning. \nCLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG - on his eye. His thoughts as the bombs fall all around his home - a moment of profound realization... \n29   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            29 \nMove across the room to the phonograph, looking down at the 78 spinning on the turntable. The camera begins to turn until all the world around us is spinning and only the record is still. We read one word of the title of the 78 quite clearly: \nSTAUFFENBERG (V.O.) Valkyrie. \n30   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                 30 \nStauffenberg faces the top members of the Resistance. \nOLBRICHT We've already considered Valkyrie. It isn't suitable. \nSTAUFFENBERG Not as it's currently written. \nGOERDELER Excuse me. What is Valkyrie? \nTRESCKOW Operation Valkyrie. \nTresckow explains even as he studies Stauffenberg, curious. What does he have in mind? \nTRESCKOW (CONT'D) The Reserve Army has thousands of men all over the city - most of them not even in uniform. Valkyrie is top secret plan to mobilize those men in a national emergency. \nSTAUFFENBERG Hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if he's cut off or killed. \nGOERDELER And what use is that to us? \nSTAUFFENBERG The orders could be rewritten. A few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command. \nOLBRICHT Yes, of course, but- \nSTAUFFENBERG Now what would the High Command do if they thought, say, the SS was staging a coup? \nOLBRICHT They would declare a military state of emergency. \nTITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM - COMMANDER OF THE GERMAN RESERVE ARMY. \nThe haggard Fromm sits at his desk, rubbing his temples. Stauffenberg and Olbricht share a confident look. Surely this guy hates the High Command. Without looking up to see them: \nFROMM What is it you want? \nOlbricht hesitates. Fromm looks up. \nFROMM (CONT'D) Well, Olbricht? Speak up. \nOLBRICHT I wanted to introduce you to our new man - Colonel Stauffenberg. \nFROMM Ah yes - the hero from Africa. I'd offer my hand but you might not give it back. \nSTAUFFENBERG I'd say the General's lost more important things this morning. \nFreeze. But after a tense beat, Fromm relaxes and laughs, taking a cigarette from a box on his desk and nudging it toward them. \nFROMM About time they put a man with balls in this office. Have a seat. (to Olbricht) You too, if you must. \nThey sit. Fromm lights a cigarette, leans back and exhales a cloud of smoke. We let things sit for awhile. The game of recruitment is about to begin and no one is sure where to start. The longer the quiet, the more awkward things seem. Finally: \nFROMM (CONT'D) They tell me you're critical of the war, Colonel. Not that you don't seem to have good reason. \nSTAUFFENBERG I am critical of losing the war, General. All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision. \nFROMM In the field, you mean. \nHe's baiting Stauffenberg to talk shit about Hitler. \nSTAUFFENBERG In Berlin. \nFROMM I take it that's why you're here. To make decisions. \nSTAUFFENBERG I've made my decision, General. I`m here to help others make theirs. \nStauffenberg makes no attempt to shade his delivery. He is quite clearly indicating that he means more. Fromm knows it, but he's being coy. \nFROMM They say when there's no clear option, one should do nothing. \nSTAUFFENBERG We're at war. We must act. Sometimes... rashly. \nFROMM Just what sort of rash action did you have in mind, Colonel? \nSTAUFFENBERG That would be a decision for the Supreme Military Commander. \nFromm is getting the message. He takes a deep drag. \nFROMM Supreme Commander, you say. \nSTAUFFENBERG Second only to the Chancellor. \nFROMM If only I were that man... This war would be going quite differently. \nOLBRICHT We were thinking the very same thing. \nFromm frowns at Olbricht. This was a bit too obvious. Stauffenberg shoots Olbricht a look. \"What the hell are you doing?\" \nFromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the ashtray and picks up the telephone. \nOlbricht and Stauffenberg steel their nerves - certain they are going to be reported. But Fromm doesn't dial. Instead, to our relief, he disconnects the line. When he is certain that it is dead: \nFROMM I don't need to remind you that we've all sworn an oath. That said, I'm going to forget we had this conversation with the understanding that such speak will never occur under this roof again. Am I clear? \nSTAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT Yes, sir. \nFROMM Tell   your friends that I always come   down on the right side. And as long   as the F\u00fchrer is alive, you know   what side that is. \nFROMM (CONT'D) (raising his hand) Heil Hitler. \n33   INT. WAR MINISTRY - CORRIDOR- CONTINUOUS                  33 \nOLBRICHT (trying to be upbeat) I think that went rather well. \nSTAUFFENBERG Yes... Quite. \n34   EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAY                              34 \nTRESCKOW I'm appointing you military leader of the Resistance. Beck agrees. \nSTAUFFENBERG But Olbricht- \nTRESCKOW We both know Olbricht hasn't the wit or the spine. No. It's you. \nA million thoughts are running through Stauffenberg's mind. Fear. Anxiety. But he knows what he must do. \nTRESCKOW (CONT'D) One more thing. You were right what you said that first night. It's not enough to kill Hitler. We need to isolate his chain of command. The slightest confusion could crush us. We need to be certain that no conflicting orders get out after the flash. \nStauffenberg considers this for a moment. \nSTAUFFENBERG That greatly limits our options of where and when to make our move, but it's the only way. \nTRESCKOW How will you do it? \nSTAUFFENBERG Perhaps it's better I don't say. \nPause. A sad smile and nod from Tresckow, a moment ago he was in charge. Now he has no clearance. \nTRESCKOW God promised Abraham that he would not destroy Sodom if he could find just ten righteous men. \nHe puts a hand on Stauffenberg's shoulder. \nTRESCKOW (CONT'D) I have a feeling that for Germany it may come down to one. \n39   INT. OFFICERS' CLUB - BERLIN - NIGHT                    39 \nA wild party - a small band, German officers, plenty of women. \nIn stark contrast, two GESTAPO MEN sip coffee at a corner table, keeping a watchful eye on the crowd. \nA WAITER carries a tray of drinks to a rowdy group in the corner who are immersed in the denial common to Berlin these days. The Waiter serves carefully, making sure one particular drink goes to: \nTITLES: GENERAL ERICH FELLGIEBEL - CHIEF OF THE ARMY SIGNAL CORPS. \nThe group toasts and downs their booze. \nCLOSE ON: Fellgiebel's smile suddenly fades. He looks into his glass, his good mood vanishing. He politely excuses himself over the noise of the rowdy mob and heads for the bathroom. He looks ill. \n40   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                     40 \nFellgiebel walks to the sink and dumps what is left of his drink in the basin. \nCLOSE ON: Mingling among the melting chunks of ice is a GLASS EYE staring back at him. \nHe scowls in the mirror at Stauffenberg, waiting. \nFELLGIEBEL You realize how close I am to Hitler. With one word I could have the Gestapo make you disappear. \nSTAUFFENBERG Why haven't you then? \nFellgiebel checks the stalls to make sure they are empty. Stauffenberg collects his glass eye from the sink, dabbing it dry on a hand towel. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) None of my associates know we've been talking if that's what you're afraid of. \nFELLGIEBEL But you know. And when the SS catch you, they'll pull you apart like warm bread. It'll be a crime just to have known you then. I warn you. If it means protecting myself, I will expose you. Do not try to contact me again. \nFellgiebel heads for the door but stops on: \nSTAUFFENBERG You can't report me. Maybe if you had when I first approached you, you'd have been keeping your oath. But now you're just as guilty as- \nFELLGIEBEL So you think that makes me a sympathizer, eh? You give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer or his F\u00fchrer and assume his actions will show you his heart. It's not that simple. \nSTAUFFENBERG It is to me. \nFELLGIEBEL For the last time, don't push me to make a decision. \nSTAUFFENBERG I have no choice. It's clear now that without you we have no hope of success. \nPause. Fellgiebel's silence speaks volumes. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) You want us to succeed. Don't you? \nFELLGIEBEL And what if you do, eh? What then? Will you be any different from Hitler? What of his Reich, his people, the very momentum of history? Will all of that let you be something he isn't? \nSTAUFFENBERG No. \nThrown, Haeften sits. Stauffenberg continues writing, ignoring him. Haeften looks up at the portrait of Hitler, startled when Stauffenberg finally speaks: \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Do you know how this war will end, Haeften? The portrait will be un- hung... And the man will be hung. \nStauffenberg looks up - looking for a reaction to such frank and treasonous talk. He gets none. He sighs, too tired to play games. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Bottom line. I'm engaged in high treason with all means available to me. Can I count you in? \nAnd the strangest thing - a reaction no one would suspect - Haeften relaxes, almost sighs, like someone who has at long last found a home. \nHAEFTEN For anything, sir. Anything at all. \nSTAUFFENBERG Anything is a very dangerous word. \n42   EXT. NORMANDY - VARIOUS - DAY/NIGHT                     42 \nTITLES: 6 JUNE 1944. \nNEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF D-DAY. Allied forces invade Normandy. The liberation of Europe has begun. \nBut this is not the D-Day you learned about in history class. This is a German newsreel. Nazi spin. In it, Hitler's forces have nothing to fear. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) (subtitles) The Allied Forces have blundered into the trap awaiting them on the beaches of Normandy - heroically repelled by the combined might of the German Army. It is a glorious day for the Reich. At long last the craven enemy has come to Europe to face their inevitable defeat at the hands of- \n43   INT. MILITARY SEDAN - NIGHT                             43 \nHAEFTEN Five thousand ships, one-hundred thousand men from the combined Allied forces. \nHaeften and Stauffenberg ride in a sedan. Stauffenberg is in profile the entire time. \nSTAUFFENBERG What about the Panzer divisions in- \nHAEFTEN They were never dispatched. Word is Hitler took a sleeping pill. His staff was afraid to wake him. \nSTAUFFENBERG First Africa, now France. \nHAEFTEN The Russians bearing down from the East. \nSTAUFFENBERG Sometimes I wonder if Hitler's real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of Europe. \nStauffenberg rubs his forehead. The car stops. SOLDIERS are waiting outside. \nStauffenberg gets out of the car wearing an ornate dress uniform and carrying a leather valise. He has arrived at a meeting of great importance. \nHe turns to face Haeften directly and we are surprised to see both of his eyes - for an instant the young lion he once was. But a closer look is unsettling - we see the faint scarring, one eye glowing and alive, the other cloudy and dead. \nHis glass eye. Stauffenberg only wore it on special occasions. This is one. \nHAEFTEN Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Maybe he'll finally listen to reason - consider a truce while he still can. \nSTAUFFENBERG We'll see if I can't convince him. \n44   EXT. THE BERGHOF - NIGHT                                 44 \nEst. Hitler's forboding southern headquarters. \nTITLES: THE BERGHOF. 7 JUNE 1944. \nStauffenberg walks up a flight of wide marble stairs - at the top he sees a group of WAITING ADJUTANTS quietly smoking cigarettes - a clique of devoted Nazis. In the group is Major Freyend, the wormy officer we saw outside Fromm's office. He watches Stauffenberg pass, aloof. We hate him. \nJust then Stauffenberg is greeted by TWO SS OFFICERS who move to physically search him - one his body, the other his valise. \nVOICE (O.S.) You don't need to search him. \nANGLE ON: Fromm's adjutant, Lt. Herber approaches, waving off the SS. \nHERBER Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored guest. The hero of Africa. \nThe SS officers stand down. Herber and Stauffenberg share a friendly smile, about to speak when Fromm walks up on them: \nFROMM For God's sake, Stauffenberg, you're- \nHe pauses, clearly caught off guard when he sees Stauffenberg with two eyes. \nFROMM (CONT'D) ... they're waiting for you. \n45   INT. THE BERGHOF - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT                45 \nBECK Out of the question. It won't work. We need you here in Berlin. \nSTAUFFENBERG Who else, then? Who can even get as close? \nBeck knows there is no other choice. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Valkyrie is very clear. Once the order is given, the Reserve Army will automatically seize control of the government with or without me. \nBECK Orders are not enough. They need a man to follow. The right man. \nPause. Stauffenberg knows he's right. The fucking pressure. He thinks for a moment, then with a sigh: \nSTAUFFENBERG Olbricht will oversee operations in my absence. I can be back in Berlin three hours after Hitler is- \nStauffenberg shuts up, lowering his head in prayer as a CLERGYMAN passes. Once they are again alone: \nBECK Three very crucial hours. \nSTAUFFENBERG We both know there's no other way. \nBeck nods, resigned. \nBECK I'll tell the others- \nAs if on cue, Beck loses control of his cough. Stauffenberg leans forward, handing him a handkerchief and putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder until the old man's hacking subsides. \nBECK (CONT'D) I'm afraid whatever the outcome, I won't be there to see it. \nSTAUFFENBERG Nonsense. You're stronger than you think. You might just be the strongest one of all. \n49   EXT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BAMBERG - DUSK                   49 \nEst. The sound of children at play takes us to: \n50   EXT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BACK LAWN - CONTINUOUS           50 \nOnce again, the scene idyllic. The Stauffenberg children play football in the distance. Stauffenberg himself is out of uniform for the first time since the hospital, but he does not seem relaxed. \nNina sits across from him, half-reading a book, half talking to her husband. Stauffenberg cannot hear a word she is saying - he is miles away. \nHe looks over at his children. One would never suspect that Germany has waged a calamitous war and that the country is facing total devastation. \nNINA ...After that I thought I'd take the children to the country for a few days to see my- Claus? \nHe snaps out of his thoughts. \"Hmmm?\" \nNINA (CONT'D) Have you heard a word I said? \nSTAUFFENBERG The country... (thinking) Nina. Listen. I want you to delay your trip. Just for a while. \nShe wants to ask, he wants to tell her. Finally: \nNINA Does this have something to do with... your work? \nSTAUFFENBERG I would just be more comfortable knowing where you are - until I'm back from Berlin. Things will be different then. I promise. \nLong pause. Once again, a couple who know each other well enough to not have to say things plainly. Nina is worried but strong. \nNINA How long until... until we see you? \nSTAUFFENBERG A few days. If all goes well. Then we can travel as a family. \nNINA And if things... don't go well? \nHe hesitates. \nSTAUFFENBERG I love you, Nina. \nNINA And I love you... What- \nCHILDREN PAPA, COME AND PLAY WITH US. (Etc.) \nThe children kick the ball toward Stauffenberg - the one sport he can play. He is about to say something to Nina, but she cuts him off. \nNINA Go be with your children. \nStauffenberg stands, touching Nina's cheek and kissing her forehead. We stay on her as he joins the children. She watches them play together, seeing her husband laughing for the first time in a long while. Her eyes well with tears - a mixture of happiness and anguish. Too good to last, too much to bear. \nOLBRICHT (CONT'D) This is General Olbricht. Order the Guard Battalion and all Army Schools near Berlin to take up march readiness. Stand by for Operation Valkyrie. \nCLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK... \n52   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY             52 \nA small, bunker-like room serves as the hub of all military communications. The walls are lined with chattering teletype machines and their OPERATORS. \nCLOSE ON: One teletype in particular. The words are clicking by quickly but we clearly make out: \nSTAND BY FOR OPERATION VALKYRIE... \nOne SERGEANT HELM leans in, reading it, curious. He tears the sheet out of the teletype and takes it to: \nThe officious LIEUTENANT HAANS - officer in charge. He likes his job and how well he does it. \nHELM (handing over the order) Lieutenant. \nHAANS What about it? \nHELM This order is calling the Reserve Army for some sort of stand-by action... in Berlin. \nHAANS (shrugs) Looks like a drill of some kind. \nHELM Valkyrie? I've never heard of that. \nHAANS Send the order through, Sergeant. \nA SHRILL WHISTLE and a WAILING SIREN take us to... \nEXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY \nShots of scattered elements of the Reserve Army coming together, taking shape: \nRESERVISTS and CADETS, from all walks of life, rush to their homes, hastily trading their civilian clothes for uniforms. \n54   EXT. AIRFIELD - RANGSDORF - DAY                         54 \nTITLES: 15 JULY 1944. \nStauffenberg and Haeften board a waiting courier plane, preparing for departure. Both are clutching their briefcases, faces like stone. Stauffenberg is dressed once again in his ornate, formal attire - his patch gone, glass eye in place. \nEXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - BERLIN - DAY \nAIR SIRENS wail. A SCULPTED EAGLE AND SWASTIKA loom over a large pillared stronghold. \nFrom out of the surrounding barracks, RESERVE SOLDIERS scramble to march readiness, assembling on the center parade grounds, awaiting orders. \nVehicles move into place along the perimeter. All in all, a well-oiled machine. \nCLOSE ON THE BERLIN COMMANDANT - GENERAL PAUL VON HASE - issuing the alert signal. AIR SIRENS wail. \nRESERVE SOLDIERS scramble into readiness. Vehicles move into place - a well-oiled machine. \nWe focus on two officers in particular: MAJOR OTTO ERNST REMER, Commander of the Deutschland Guard Battalion, and SECOND LIEUTENANT DR. HANS HAGEN. Loyal Nazis both. \nREMER What do you suppose this is all about? \nHAGEN Probably just a drill. \nBut Remer doesn't seem convinced. Remember him. \n56   INT./EXT. VARIOUS - DAY                                   56 \nShots of Stauffenberg and Haeften deplaning/getting into a waiting car/slowly making their way to their destination. Finally, they arrive at: \n57   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    57 \nEst. A 625 acre compound hidden deep in the mosquito infested forests of Wilhelmsdorf. Security is tight - barbed wire fencing, checkpoints, flak towers, machine gun nests, trenches, land mines. \nTITLES: WOLFSCHANZE - \"THE WOLF'S LAIR\". HITLER'S BAVARIAN HEADQUARTERS. \n58   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - MAIN GATE - DAY                      58 \nThe car carrying Stauffenberg and Haeften arrives at the first security checkpoint. \nTWO GUARDS check identity papers and confiscate pistols from Haeften and The Driver. Stauffenberg boldly extends his valise to one of the Guards, but rather than reach for it, the young soldier snaps to attention and raises his hand in a Nazi salute, eyes straight ahead, stone-like. A drone. \nMERTZ Put the Reserve Army on standby alert. \nOLBRICHT Not until I hear from Stauffenberg. Not until I'm sure. \nMERTZ But that's not what he- \nOLBRICHT Noted, Colonel. Thank you. \n88   EXT. AIRFIELD - RASTENBURG - DAY                          88 \nThe plane touches down and taxis to a stop. Stauffenberg and Haeften deplane and immediately step into a waiting courier car driven by a young, dutiful Nazi. SECOND LIEUTENANT KRETZ. Remember him. \n89   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    89 \nEven this early, the heat is oppressive. \nWe watch from a distance as the courier car is stopped at the outer checkpoint. Once again, the GUARD carefully examines Stauffenberg and Haeften's identification and takes their pistols before allowing the car to pass. We follow. \n90   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY                  90 \nEst. Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel's office as the courier car arrives. \nStauffenberg and Haeften are greeted by Freyend who shows them to: \n91   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS          91 \nTWO OFFICERS are already waiting. They stand... \nFREYEND Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - Chief Officer of the Reserve Army. \nOFFICER #1 Colonel Stauffenberg. This is an honor. They say you're the man that will defend Berlin from the Red Army single-hand- \nThe officer realizes what a faux pas he has made as soon as he says it. Unfazed, Stauffenberg smiles, raising his briefcase with his single hand. \nSTAUFFENBERG Indeed. I've got the whole bag of tricks right here. \nThe officers laugh nervously, relieved he was not insulted. Idiots. Meanwhile, Freyend steps toward Haeften, reaching for the handle of his briefcase. \nFREYEND Let me take that for you. \nBut Haeften snaps the case back. Freyend raises a suspicious eye. Before he can press: \nVOICE (O.S.) Colonel Stauffenberg? \nEveryone turns to find General Fellgiebel standing at the door. Everyone stands at attention. \nFELLGIEBEL At east, Gentlemen. (to Stauffenberg) General Fellgiebel, communications. I just wanted to meet the hero of Africa... And see if there's anything you need. \nSTAUFFENBERG Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a call of the utmost importance. Even if it comes when I am in conference with the F\u00fchrer I'd appreciate it if you had a man come and get me. \nBeat. Fellgiebel and Stauffenberg share an instant look of understanding. \nFELLGIEBEL Of course, Colonel. \nFellgiebel salutes. Stauffenberg and the others return it as Fellgiebel departs. Just then, Keitel bursts from his office, fixing his tie. \nKEITEL Gentlemen. The meeting has been pushed forward to 12:30. Mussolini is arriving on the afternoon train and Hitler wants to have lunch with him. \nStauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus. \nSTAUFFENBERG Will Mussolini be in the briefing? \nKEITEL I only wish he were. Then some ambitious officer might take the opportunity to shoot the dago bastard. \nKeitel makes a beeline for the door and the others follow like good sheep. Stauffenberg holds back, however, attracting Freyend's attention. \nSTAUFFENBERG I'll need a place to wash up - change my shirt. \nStauffenberg points to the shaving cut on his throat and the tiny blood stain on his shirt. The cut was intentional after all. \nAnnoyed, Freyend motions to the adjoining anteroom. \nFREYEND Please, do be quick. You heard the General. \nStauffenberg nods in appreciation. He motions for Haeften to follow him. Freyend watches, curious. \n92   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                92 \nFreyend seems more than just a little peeved. But Stauffenberg doesn't notice. He is focused straight ahead, mentally calculating what time he has left. \nThe bunker suddenly seems miles away. \n98   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE BUNKER - DAY                   98 \nSecurity Perimeter I. Keitel and his men file through the heavily guarded entrance. Each man holds up his pass for the GUARDS to inspect. Stauffenberg is last. \nKeitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead - AWAY FROM THE BUNKER. Stauffenberg is confused. \nSTAUFFENBERG Where are they going? \nFREYEND It's too hot. The briefing has been moved to the conference hut. \nANGLE ON: The conference hut. The door and many windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open. Not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure vital to Stauffenberg's plan. But this obstacle only seems to strengthen his resolve. He is a soldier after all. And no military operation goes according to plan. Making matters worse: \nFREYEND (CONT'D) Sir, your briefcase. I insist. \nAnnoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion, Stauffenberg finally acquiesces, handing it over. He watches Freyend carry the bomb into the hut. Pause. \nStauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to: \nFellgiebel - standing by the communications building. The man who will get Stauffenberg out of the room before the bomb goes off. They share a nod. Then Stauffenberg steps into the hut. \n99    INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS               99 \nIn the room beyond we see Hitler at the end of a long table surrounded by RANKING OFFICERS. One by one, they present their individual briefings to the nodding F\u00fchrer. Stauffenberg whispers to Freyend. \nSTAUFFENBERG My injuries left me a bit hard of hearing. See that you place me as near the F\u00fchrer as possible. \nFreyend nods, but for now his concerns are elsewhere - wrangling everyone into the meeting. \nLike the other officers, Stauffenberg hangs up his belt and hat on hooks at the entrance to the briefing room. He catches sight of SERGEANT-MAJOR ADAM, the conference hut's young telephone operator. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent call from Berlin... \n100   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                100 \nA small room measuring 15 by 32 feet. Stifling heat. We notice again that the windows are open to let in some air. Hitler and his officers hunch over a long, heavy table covered in detailed maps of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. \nLIEUTENANTS and SERGEANTS continually tiptoe in and out of the room. A GENERAL stands beside Hitler in the middle of his briefing: \nGENERAL The Eastern Front forces are assured a victory... but they need reinforcements. \nIn other words, they are getting pounded but he can't say that. The General is relived to be interrupted by Keitel's arrival. The briefing stops momentary as: \nKEITEL Please pardon our tardiness... You remember Colonel Stauffenberg? \nHitler makes a deliberate effort to shake Stauffenberg's hand, their eyes lock - an unnerving moment. Stauffenberg has come to kill this man greeting him. The moment is broken when the General clears his throat, continuing his presentation. \nGENERAL As you can see, Mein F\u00fchrer, the situation in the East Prussian sector is increasingly critical... (and on and on...) \nFreyend startles Stauffenberg slightly when he takes him by the arm, moving him to his place at the table - less than half a step from Hitler. He is squeezed in between two other officers. We suck in wind when we see who one of them is... \nCOLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - the same Brandt who carried the bottles of Cointreau onto Hitler's plane so long ago. He still scribbles in his damn datebook. \nFreyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg - bumping Brandt's leg. Brandt looks down at the briefcase - long enough to make us nervous. \nHe watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down, sliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible, leaning it against the heavy wooden table support immediately to the right of Hitler's foot. \nStauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at his watch. He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the telephone operator. Where is his God-damn phone call? \nAround him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear nothing. Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat in his own ears - the only thing betraying his otherwise outward calm. \nHe looks down at the briefcase - the bomb just under his feet. He looks at Hitler nodding. The longer we stay, the more excruciating it is. So we milk it. \nStauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm. The annoying Freyend is there, whispering in his ear. Keitel sees this, irritated by the interruption. Stauffenberg makes a gesture to Keitel with his hand, indicating a phone call. Keitel is not pleased. \n101   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY                       101 \nFreyend leads Stauffenberg to Adam who offers the telephone receiver. \nADAM General Fellgiebel, sir. He says it's urgent. \nStauffenberg takes the phone and stares at Freyend and Adam - they get the idea that this is a private call and leave. When they are gone, Stauffenberg simply lays the receiver down and walks out. Fast. \nA moment later, Adam returns to the room. He sees the receiver laying there. Odd. Looking down the hallway he sees Stauffenberg quickly exiting the building. \n106   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - INNER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         106 \nKretz brings the car to a sudden stop at the first checkpoint. A barricade is in place. A GUARD approaches. Stauffenberg and Haeften hold up passes. \nSTAUFFENBERG We have to get to the airfield at once. Orders form the F\u00fchrer. \nThe guard signals his men to remove the barricade. \n107   INT. COMMUNICATIONS HUT - MOMENTS LATER                    107 \nFellgiebel waits to be connected to the War Ministry in Berlin. His Communications Officer awaits orders. This makes it hard for Fellgiebel to speak plainly. He plays up his distress for his audience. \nFELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE) I am calling from The Wolf's Lair with urgent news for the General. Something terrible has happened... \nThen he turns his back, lowers his voice. \nFELLGIEBEL (CONT'D) (whispering) The F\u00fchrer is still alive. \nVOICE (ON PHONE) I'm sorry. Please come again. \nBut Fellgiebel's officer is watching him, trying to hear. Fellgiebel has no choice but to hang up. \nFELLGIEBEL Sever all communications. \nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER Sir? \nFELLGIEBEL DON'T ARGUE WITH ME, DAMMIT. JUST DO IT. \n108   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY                108 \nOlbricht anxiously hovers over Mertz who shouts into the phone. \nMERTZ I didn't hear you. Come again. Fellgiebel. FELLGIEBEL. \nBut it's no use. Mertz slowly hangs up the phone. \nOLBRICHT Well, what did he say? \nMERTZ I... couldn't be sure. It sounded as though he said... Hitler is still alive. \nOlbricht clinches his teeth and starts sweating. \nOLBRICHT Get him back on the line. \nMERTZ Sir... The bomb did go off. That much was clear. Fellgiebel's next step will be to sever all communications. \nOlbricht is confused. Frozen. \nMERTZ (CONT'D) Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit. We initiate Valkyrie regardless. \nOLBRICHT Only Fromm can initiate. You know that. \nMERTZ Then lie. Tell him Hitler's dead. Or arrest him. But do it now. \nBut Olbricht is frozen. \nMERTZ (CONT'D) Sir... Did you hear me? You have to give the order to initiate Valkyrie. This is our only- \nOLBRICHT I'm not doing anything until I talk to Fellgiebel. Get him back on the phone. NOW. \nMertz shakes his head bitterly and dials, but he'll never get through. \n109   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         109 \nStauffenberg's car presses on through the woods toward the last security checkpoint, but numerous new road barriers are in place. This is not good. \nOne SERGEANT KOLBE and TWO ARMED SOLDIERS step from the guardhouse, signalling Kretz to stop. \nKOLBE No one gets in or out. \nSTAUFFENBERG We're on orders from the F\u00fchrer. We have to get to the airfield immediately. You will step aside. \nKOLBE I'm sorry, sir, but my orders are- \nStauffenberg steps out of the vehicle and makes a beeline for the guardroom. Kolbe races after him. \n110   INT. GUARDROOM - CONTINUOUS                                110 \nADAM Yes, sir. Of course. But... \nKEITEL But what? Spit it out, man. \nADAM Well. The Colonel left his hat. \nKeitel's expression sours. \"Is that all you've got for me?\" He is about to say so when that prick Freyend barges in, also banged up. With him is Kretz - Stauffenberg's driver. \nFREYEND Pardon the intrusion, sir, but I think you will be most interested to hear what this man has to say. \n116   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY               116 \nTITLES: 2:00 PM. \nForty-five precious minutes have slipped away. \nMertz sits alone at Olbricht's desk, lighting a fresh cigarette with the remains of another. The ashtray says he's been at this for quite a while. He stares at the clock, as if attempting to will time forward. \nHis eyes sweep across Olbricht's desk, past his files, his stationery, framed photographs of his family. Then he looks up at a portrait of Hitler. \nMertz is struck suddenly with a notion. He looks again at Olbricht's desk. His stationery... \n\"Fuck it.\" \nHe grabs the stationery and feeds it into a typewriter. \n117   INT. WAR MINISTRY - COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY         117 \nMertz approaches a LOWLY TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATOR. Awkward pause. A struggle with the soul. Then he hands over a sheet of paper. \nMERTZ Orders from General Olbricht. \nCLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK... \n118   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              118 \nAgain we are inside the nerve center of Nazi communications. Again the teletypes busily chatter away. And again, Sgt. Helm is curious, watching: \nSTANDBY FOR OPERATION VALKYRIE... \nThe TELETYPE OPERATOR looks up at Helm. \"What do I do?\" Helm glances over his shoulder to the uptight Lt. Haan - oblivious. Helm shrugs. \nHELM Send it through. But keep me informed. \nA SHRILL WHISTLE takes us to... \nEXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY \nOnce again RESERVISTS and CADETS rush to their homes and scramble to put on their uniforms. \n119   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - DAY                  119 \nThe siren, the sculpted eagle and swastika, the pillared stronghold. Tanks and heavy equipment are once again made ready. \nGeneral Hase issues the alert signal just as he did before, watching the men of the Reserve Army scramble. In the melee we find Lieutenant Hagen. \nHAGEN Here we go again. \nHe says this to: \nMajor Remer, the man who was so suspicious last time is even more suspicious now. \n121   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - CONFERENCE HUT - DAY                  121 \nA light drizzle. A man jabbering in Italian O.S. \nWe get our first good look at the demolished briefing hut. That anyone survived is a miracle. Officers crowd around the smoldering ruins, the F\u00fchrer himself heading this procession. He wears new clothes, nodding, smiling politely to the jabbering Italian O.S. A slight wince is the only indication that he was damn near blown to bits just hours ago. \nCOME AROUND TO REVEAL none other than BENITO MUSSOLINI speaking an incessant stream of Italian. \nHITLER'S P.O.V. Blissful silence. Mussolini's blathering falls literally on deaf ears. \n122   EXT. AIRFIELD - RANGSDORF - DAY                          122 \nTITLES: 3:15 PM. \nThree hours have passed since the explosion. Stauffenberg and Haeften alight from the plane. The airfield is surprisingly calm. No car to meet them. \nHe looks at Mertz. \nOLBRICHT Get Beck and the others. Tell them it's time. \nRelieved, Mertz nods and rushes out. Olbricht picks up the phone and dials. After a beat, he reads from the first page of the Valkyrie order. \nOLBRICHT (CONT'D) This is General Olbricht calling on behalf of General Fromm - Commander of the Home Army. Adolf Hitler, is dead. A group of radicals from the SS are attempting to seize control of the government. Operation Valkyrie is in effect. All military districts, training schools and replacement troops are to take control of essential government offices at once... \nCLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK... \n127   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              127 \nLt. Haans sits at his desk, sensing someone over his shoulder. He turns to find Sgt. Helm, a sheet of paper in his trembling hands. \nHELM The F\u00fchrer is dead. \nSkeptical, Haans snatches the paper from Helm. When he looks up, the entire staff is looking at him, some with tears in their eyes - others perhaps hiding a sense of relief. \nA phone rings. Then another. The chattering teletypes seem to surge into another gear as news of Hitler's death starts to spread. \nLong pause. Haans struggles with the sheer size of the moment. \nHAANS You all know your jobs. Get to work. \nZombie-like, the Operators go back to their teletypes, passing orders along. \nBut one Operator - the one Helm asked to keep him informed - notices something strange about one order in a stack of many he is sifting through. \nOPERATOR Sergeant. This order is signed by Witzleben. \nHELM (taking the paper) That's ridiculous. He`s not even in the army anymore. \nBut sure enough, there is Witzleben's name. Strange. Helm looks over at the devastated Haans, wondering how to handle this. Then, like a good little Nazi: \nHELM (CONT'D) Pass the order along. \n128   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - DAY                  128 \nRESERVE SOLDIERS are marched into readiness. Vehicles moved into place. As they await further orders... \nFROMM (V.O.) Who told you the F\u00fchrer was dead? \n129   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                129 \nMertz and a sheepish Olbricht stand before Fromm. A stunned Lt. Herber hovers by the door. \nOLBRICHT General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's Lair. \nFromm is at a loss for words. This just can't be so. He picks up the phone. \nFROMM (INTO PHONE) This is Fromm. Put me through to The Wolf's Lair. \nOLBRICHT There's no use calling, all communication lines are- \nFROMM (INTO PHONE) Yes. General Fromm for Field Marshal Keitel. Urgent. \nMertz and Olbricht are shocked that he got through. \n130   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY                 130 \nKeitel is still nursing a few wounds. \nFROMM (ON PHONE) What's going on up there? The most incredible rumors are circulating in Berlin. \nImmediately suspicious, Keitel plays dumb, leading... \nKEITEL I don't know what you mean. Everything's in order here. \nKeitel looks out the window at the still smoldering ruins of the conference hut in the distance. \nFROMM There's talk the F\u00fchrer's been assassinated. \nKEITEL Another failed attempt. The F\u00fchrer was never in danger. (beat) By the way, where is your man Colonel Stauffenberg? \n131   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                 131 \nFROMM Stauffenberg? On his way back to Berlin, I should think. \nHELLDORF There's a lot of talk that Hitler isn't really dead. Is this true? \nAwkward pause. Good question. The men in the room share nervous glances. Then all eyes on Stauffenberg. \nSTAUFFENBERG I can't offer you any guarantees. The decision is yours and yours alone. Can we count on you? \nLong pause. PAN ACROSS the uneasy faces of the men in the room, perhaps all of them waiting to see what Helldorf does before making their decisions. Finally: \nHELLDORF I'm with you. \nStauffenberg can barely hide his relief. There is a palpable shift in the room. One by one, the officers in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup. \nSTAUFFENBERG Have your men surround the building. No one gets in or out of here without my permission. (to the others) I want every available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city. Dismissed. \nThe soldiers move, but Beck's voice stops them - surprisingly loud and clear for a sick old man. \nBECK Acts of vengeance will not be tolerated. We represent a different form of government. We represent what is good and just in Germany. \nAN EXPLOSION OF ACTIVITY: \n135   INT. WAR MINISTRY - STAUFFENBERG'S OFFICE - DAY          135 \nStauffenberg stands at his cluttered desk, a flurry of activity surrounding him. He is frantically speaking into the phone and to those present. \nSTAUFFENBERG ...Deploy troops to seize and protect all Reich agencies. Of most importance are communication centers - newspapers, radio stations, telephone and telegraph offices. All Nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once... \n136   INT. MILITARY COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - BERLIN - DAY         136 \nGeneral Hase, the Berlin Commandant, stands before a giant map of Berlin, addressing a roomful of NAZI OFFICERS. \nHASE ... Completely blockade the government quarters. Everything from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz. Nobody, not even generals or ministers, should be allowed to pass. (beat) You have your orders, gentlemen. \nAgain, we focus on Major Remer, Commander of the Deutschland Guard Battalion and always suspicious. \nHASE (CONT'D) Is there a problem, Major? \nREMER It just all seems very... vague, sir. Protocol dictates we should receive orders in writing- \nHASE These are the orders as they were presented to me, Major. Now move. \nPause. Just before the pause becomes insolent, Remer clicks his heels and salutes, leaving. But the look on his face tells us he's hatching a plan of his own. \nYou are right to be nervous. \n137   EXT. GOVERNMENT QUARTERS - BERLIN - VARIOUS - LATER      137 \nThe city center is abuzz with soldiers and military vehicles as they frantically cordon off the streets. \nSOLDIERS come out of various government buildings with SEVERAL NAZI GENERALS in custody, hands bound. They push them into waiting trucks. \nMeanwhile, PASSING CIVILIANS walk quickly by, trying to pretend they don't see anything. Years of Nazi rule have told them to mind their own business. \nANGLE ON: A staff car - Major Remer in the back, watching the entire scene with cold eyes. Lt. Hagen emerges from the chaos on the streets. \nHAGEN Major Remer. We've just had orders from the War Ministry. The battalion is to blockade the government quarter and place Minister Goebbels under arrest. \nRemer does not move. He just thinks. \nHAGEN (CONT'D) What is it, Major? \nREMER Something just doesn't feel right about this. I would hate to find out I'm being taken advantage of. \nHAGEN (realizing) A coup you think? \nREMER Of that I am certain. What I can't say is which side we're on. Get in. \nAs Hagen does, Remer turns to his DRIVER. \nREMER (CONT'D) Take us to the Reichministry. Be quick about it. \n140   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                  140 \nStauffenberg, Beck and Olbricht lead a continued effort to manage the coup. Each man shouts orders into the phone, all the while signing dispatches sent by a steady flow of RUNNERS. \nFRAULEIN VON OVEN (the secretary who worked with Stauffenberg and Tresckow to compile the Valkyrie orders) rushes in, whispering to Stauffenberg. \nSTAUFFENBERG Send him in. (Oven hesitates) It's all right. Send him in. \nREMER (CONT'D) Hello? \nVOICE (ON PHONE) Do you recognize my voice? \nRemer is in awe, for a moment unable to speak. Then: \nREMER Of course, Mein F\u00fchrer. \nHITLER (ON PHONE) Then listen to me very carefully... \n144   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              144 \nThe communications staff busily connects calls and transmits orders. Sgt. Helm gingerly approaches Lt. Haans with two sheets of paper. \nHAANS What is it now, Sergeant? \nHELM It's just that now we're getting conflicting orders, sir. The Wolf's Lair says one thing, Stauffenberg another. \nHaans sighs, genuinely irritated now. \nHAANS Our job is not to interpret the orders. Our job is to pass them along. Regardless. \nHELM Yes, but sir- \nHAANS Is that perfectly clear, Sergeant? \nHaans thrusts the orders back at Helm who sheepishly walks back to his pool of radio operators. \n145   EXT. REICHMINISTRY - DUSK                               145 \nAs day turns to night, the soldiers surrounding the government quarters wait for further orders. \nMajor Remer comes out a new man - invigorated and focused. He walks over to a truck loaded with RANKING PRISONERS, turning to the soldiers guarding them. \nREMER (re: prisoners) Release these men at once. \nHAGEN But these men are part of a coup. \nREMER I've just been on the phone with Hitler himself. We are the coup, you idiot. We've been duped. \n146   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S QUARTERS - NIGHT            146 \nFromm is a prisoner in his own quarters - staring at a portrait of Hitler with equal parts disdain and reverence. The door suddenly opens. \nHerber enters, leading the handcuffed Fat General. Avoiding Fromm's gaze, he removes the restraints and turns to leave. But the wily Fromm can see the look in Herber's eyes. \nFROMM Well, Lieutenant. What do you make of all of this? \nHerber freezes. Beat. \nHERBER I... I don't know... \nFROMM I won't ask you to make a choice. That's for you and you alone. All I ask is that you observe and think for yourself. In time you'll see things for what they truly are. You know where to find me when you do. \nHerber nods hesitantly, then turns to leave, but: \nFROMM (CONT'D) Lieutenant. (as Herber turns back) Heil Hitler. \nHerber raises his right arm, just managing: \nHERBER Heil Hitler. \n147   INT. REICHMINISTRY - GOEBBELS' OFFICE - NIGHT           147 \nGoebbels' office is now the scene of great activity. Soldiers rush in and out carrying orders. Goebbels is on two phones at the same time. \nThrough the melee comes none other than Heinrich Himmler - the bespectacled villain whose appearance is unmatched in fiction. His arrival cannot be good. \nGOEBBELS Have you seen the F\u00fchrer? Is he- \nHIMMLER It seems the conference table shielded him from the blast. He's lucky to be alive. (looking around) Do you want to tell me what's going on? \nGOEBBELS Everything is under control. I've taken charge of the Guard Battalion and given them new orders. We're turning the tables on these cowards. \nHIMMLER I've been sent here personally by the F\u00fchrer to collect the conspirators. He insists they be taken alive. \nGoebbels and Himmler, two of the most evil men who ever lived, smile coldly. Being taken alive by this mob is obviously a fate worse than death. \nUnder Remer's direction the Deutschland Guard Battalion quickly surrounds the War Ministry. \nWe see a figure moving behind the windows up above... \n153   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - NIGHT             153 \nOlbricht helplessly watches troops surround the building below. It is only a matter of time now. \nHe sits at his desk. With a long trembling sigh, he puts pen to paper and writes: \n\"My dearest wife...\" \nA commotion from the anteroom startles Olbricht and he drops the pen. A loud, shrill scream follows. \nThe door bursts open to reveal Herber and his TWO COHORTS. They are supported by A HALF DOZEN ARMED SOLDIERS, all training their weapons on Olbricht. \nIn the anteroom behind the soldiers we see Fraulein Oven quietly slipping out into the hallway. \n154   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - NIGHT                154 \nBeck, Stauffenberg and Haeften are still making calls and writing orders - doing all they can to keep the coup alive. They are startled when Fraulein Oven bursts in. It is written on her face. \n155   INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT                       155 \nStauffenberg and Haeften rush toward Olbricht's office, stopping when they see a MASS OF SOLDIERS surrounding the doorway. A chill runs down our spines when we see Herber talking to none other than Major Remer. Just then, he spots Stauffenberg and Haeften. \nREMER YOU THERE. \nStauffenberg and Haeften turn and run. \nREMER (CONT'D) HALT. \nBANG. A shot is fired. Stauffenberg and Haeften take cover in a nearby doorway. Haeften returns fire. Stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his right arm, managing to cock it with the three fingers of his left hand. Awkward. Then he aims and fires. \nStauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his good arm. He drops his gun, bleeding badly. \nBut MORE SOLDIERS appear at the opposite end of the corridor. The loyal Haeften covers Stauffenberg with his body, aiming to fire. But Stauffenberg stops him, shaking his head. It's over. They toss down their guns. Boot-steps approach loudly O.S. \nAs Stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring around his neck: \nHAEFTEN Thank you, Colonel. \nStauffenberg is genuinely confused. \"For what?\" \nHAEFTEN (CONT'D) Better I die for Germany than for Hitler. \nVOICE (O.S.) Colonel Stauffenberg. \nStauffenberg turns to find Remer standing there. \nREMER You're under arrest. \n160   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - LATER                160 \nStauffenberg, Olbricht, Beck, Mertz and Haeften, the last of the conspiracy, are held at gunpoint. A smug Fromm enters, followed by Herber, the Fat General, Remer and numerous GUN-TOTING OFFICERS. \nFROMM If you have any last messages, you'd better write them now. \nSTAUFFENBERG My actions speak for me. (to his men) I'd rather my wife and children remember our last time together. \nThe others bravely nod in agreement. But then: \nBECK I'd like a pistol, please. \nStauffenberg looks at Beck with surprise. \nBECK (CONT'D) For personal reasons. \nFromm thinks about it, then matter-of-factly hands Beck a pistol. Remer quickly steps forward. \nREMER General, my orders are to deliver the prisoners alive. \nFROMM Noted, Major. (to Beck) Get on with it then. \nREMER But, sir- \nFROMM THAT WILL BE ALL, MAJOR. \n", "test1_input": "Tresckow halts and faces Olbricht, expressionless. \nTRESCKOW What makes you think- \nOLBRICHT Oster's been arrested. The Gestapo came for him last night. \nTresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking. Olbricht hurries after him. \nOLBRICHT (CONT'D) Did you hear what I said? \nTRESCKOW The Gestapo could have arrested him for anything. Find a replacement. \nOLBRICHT There's no one we can trust. Not in Berlin. \nTRESCKOW Then stop looking in Berlin. \nJust then, they approach the final threshold, a SENTRY guards an office marked: \nCOLONEL HEINZ BRANDT. \nOlbricht stops, regarding the door with dread. But Tresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to enter when: \nSENTRY Your pistol please. \nOh shit. Tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol from its holster and handing it over. \nAnd with a nod to Olbricht, Tresckow squares his shoulders and enters Brandt's office. \n11   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - BRANDT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    11 \nBrandt is at his desk, writing as always. Tresckow notices Brandt's pistol sitting within arm's reach. A clock ticks loudly. Imagine it. Then wait. Finally: \nBrandt puts his pen down, stands and salutes, but the gesture is almost casual. Pure formality. \nBRANDT You'll forgive me, General. This little round-up has had me writing reports all day. \nTRESKOW Round-up? \nBRANDT Dissenters. A plot against the F\u00fchrer. \nTresckow makes a good show of laughing that off. \nTRESKOW Who would even have the balls? \nBRANDT You'd be surprised, the number of cowards in this army that would be willing to stand against the Reich. \nTRESKOW Only if the F\u00fchrer were dead, of course. \nBRANDT Of course. It's one thing to think you know what's right. What matters is having the strength to do it. \nClunk. Brandt produces the package, putting it on the desk in front of him. \nBRANDT (CONT'D) Is this what you've come for? \nPause. Staying cool, Tresckow reaches for it: \nBRANDT (CONT'D) Perhaps we should open it. \nTresckow freezes, studies Brandt's cold smile. \nTRESCKOW I beg your pardon. \nBrandt sits back, smiles. Does he know? \nBRANDT You've come a long way. You must be thirsty. \nTRESCKOW I wonder how the F\u00fchrer, who does not partake, would feel about an officer who did so on duty... Colonel Brandt. \nBrandt's smile fades. We can't decide why. He picks up the package carelessly. Tresckow stays cool despite the armed explosive just a few feet away. \nBRANDT I took you for another sort, General. \nAnd we realize he really did just want a drink. He knows nothing about what the package hides. \nTRESCKOW And I you. \nTresckow reaches out, grabbing the package and: \n", "test1_true": "12   EXT.

A column of tanks, trucks and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely contained chaos. Men dismantle tents from around others dumping documents into burning oil drums. \nIn the middle of it we find a tall, handsome young officer (age 35). He wears an Afrika Korps uniform complete with Colonel's badges, staying cooler than the other side of your pillow. He directs men this way and that, holding back panic. \nTITLES: COLONEL CLAUS VON STAUFFENBERG - STAFF OFFICER, 10TH PANZER DIVISION. \nA jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by a YOUNG LIEUTENANT. \nYOUNG LIEUTENANT Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new headquarters has been established at Mezzouna. I'm to take you there. \nStauffenberg looks over the scene, expressionless. \nSTAUFFENBERG Now they tell us to disengage - a day late. No matter how many times we tell Command the reality, they always manage to leave us- \nBut he stops himself, containing his rage. \nYOUNG LIEUTENANT Colonel, the enemy is less than five kilometers from here. You've done all you can. \nStauffenberg glances at his right hand, contemplating a ring on his finger. After a beat: \nSTAUFFENBERG I wonder... Was there even a point in our coming to Tunis? \nYOUNG LIEUTENANT To get taken prisoner, it seems. \nStauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as: \nBOOM. The first bomb explodes before we even see the tight formation of BRITISH FIRE-BOMBERS overhead. Fighter planes strafe with machine-guns. Artillery blasts strike in front and behind the retreating column. The 10th Panzer Division is trapped. \nPanic hits the column like a tidal wave. Stauffenberg taps the Young Lieutenant who drives into the melee. \nSoldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short supply and many are left in the open. So they run. Dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters. The survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn to make another run. In a panic, the soldiers run the other direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way. \nStauffenberg stands in the passenger seat. \nSTAUFFENBERG STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT. \nThe men calm when they see the Colonel, trusting him. They turn and watch the formation of planes complete their turn and bear down, gaining speed. Knees tense, some jerking from the natural inclination to flee. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) STAND FAST, I SAID. \nThey do, despite the menace of the planes' engines growing louder, meaner... \n13   INT. LEAD FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY                          13 \nThe confused PILOT takes in the mass of motionless men below. His finger tenses on the trigger and... \n14   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                        14 \nSTAUFFENBERG NOW. \nThe mob of soldiers breaks - some right, some left - as the fighters open fire on what had been the center of their mass. Unable to change course quickly enough, they spray their lead into the sand. \nIn that same instant, Stauffenberg drops into his seat, the Young Lieutenant jams the jeep in drive and a wave of hot lead misses them by mere feet. Stauffenberg watches his men regroup, waiting out the turning squadron. They've got the idea now. He turns to his Lieutenant who smiles admiringly. But Stauffenberg's eyes widen. He grabs his Lieutenant's head and jams it down, revealing a STRAY FIGHTER coming up from behind. Stauffenberg ducks out of frame, shielding the Young Lieutenant with his body. \nBANG. Blood sprays across the jeep's windshield before bullets rip it to pieces, leaving only clear blue African sky... And then the EXPLOSION. \nSILENCE. FADE TO WHITE. \n15   INT.

Beside her is BERTHOLD VON STAUFFENBERG (38), Stauffenberg's older brother. \nThey reach the door of a private hospital room just as A DOCTOR comes out.

WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY           64 \nStauffenberg quietly slips back into the briefing unnoticed. He freezes: \nCLOSE ON: The spot where Stauffenberg left his briefcase. Remember? Well it's gone. \nHe looks around frantically. Some officers notice him. Tension mounts. He gets Haeften's attention. \nSTAUFFENBERG (mouthing) My briefcase. \nBefore Haeften can answer, Fromm shoots them both a glare. \"What the hell are you doing?\" \nKEITEL ...Gentleman. You are dismissed. \nAnd like that, the briefing has ended. Stauffenberg is sickened - the opportunity lost. Hitler exits, walking right past him. Keitel and the rest file out. The last to leave is Fromm. \nFROMM That call better have been important. \nStauffenberg turns, coming face-to-face with Freyend, Keitel's hateful toady. He holds the missing briefcase. For a moment we're sure the jig is up. \nFREYEND Your bag... Colonel. \nHe hands it over and leaves. \n65   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - BERLIN - DAY           65 \nA military sedan skids to a stop outside the Guard Battalion headquarters. Olbricht jumps from the car, racing to get General Hase's attention. \nLARGE FORMATIONS of soldiers stand at attention in the hot sun, awaiting orders. \nHASE (whispering) What the hell is going on? My men have been standing here for an hour. I don't know what to tell them. \nCLOSE ON REMER (the officer we told you to remember) standing before the ranks. He eyes Hase and Olbricht suspiciously, trying to hear what they are saying. After a moment, Hase addresses the men. \nHASE (CONT'D) At ease, gentlemen. \nOlbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to hide his nerves. \nOLBRICHT This has been a drill. You're all to be commended for your quick response. Dismissed. \nPause. The men linger, confused until: \nOLBRICHT (CONT'D) HEIL HITLER. \nSOLDIERS HEIL HITLER. \nAnd the men fall out, nowhere to go so they just light up and shoot the shit. Hagen approaches Remer. \nHAGEN What did I tell you? A drill. \nBut Remer is not so sure. The way he stares at Olbricht makes us nervous. \nCLOSE ON: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making note of the esteemed KNIGHT'S CROSS pinned to Remer's uniform. Olbricht leans toward Hase. \nOLBRICHT That man there. Who is he? \nHASE Major Remer? He commands the Deutschland Guard Battalion. What about him? \nOLBRICHT Get rid of him. \nHASE Remer? Don't worry about him. He's an order taker. To the bone. \nAh yes... But whose orders? \n66   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OUTSIDE FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY           66 \nAs usual, Lt.

A beat later, Keitel storms out of Fromm's office, his face red with anger. Deja vu.

You damn near cost me my commission. What in God's name made you think you even had the authority? \nOLBRICHT It was only a drill. An exercise. \nFROMM DON'T LIE, OLBRICHT. Not to me. We both know it was no fucking drill. \nSTAUFFENBERG General, if I may- \nFROMM You may not, Colonel. You may not do anything. Because now you've not only shown me you can't deliver, you've painted a target on my back. If I so much as sense you trying to move the Reserve Army again, I'll personally have you both arrested. Do I make myself abundantly clear? \nSTAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT Yes, sir. \nFROMM Heil Hitler. \nOLBRICHT Heil Hitler. \nBut Stauffenberg turns to leave without answering. \nFROMM I'll hear you say it, Colonel. \nStauffenberg stops, glaring at Fromm with his one eye. He squares his shoulders, clicks his heels loudly and delivers a downright Nazi-like: \nSTAUFFENBERG HEIL HITLER. \nStill managing to make it sound spiteful. He leaves without being dismissed, slamming the door. \n68   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                   68 \nIt has been a long day, the Resistance leaders are all exhausted. Beck, Olbricht, Witzleben, Haeften and Mertz watch Goerdeler circling a rigid Stauffenberg. \nGOERDELER The point of your central solution is to replace Hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the Allies. The Allies, I suspect, would be more amenable to a truce... IF WE OFFER IT TO THEM BEFORE THEY ARE IN FUCKING BERLIN. \nSTAUFFENBERG Today was a matter of indecision - nothing more. A military operation in the hands of a politician. \nStauffenberg's lack of respect infuriates Goerdeler. \nGOERDELER I don't think I am alone when I say your judgement is in question. (to the others) I would like to take a vote. \nBECK Carl. \nGOERDELER I DEMAND THAT WE RELIEVE COLONEL STAUFFENBERG. \nBECK Carl, if I may have a word with you in private. \nGOERDELER If you have something to say, Ludwig, say it here. Say it now. \nBECK Very well. There's no need to vote. \nBeck turns to the bar, pours two drinks. Stauffenberg stiffens, ready for the axe. \nBECK (CONT'D) I consider you a friend. And I look forward to the day when we can once again live as free men. But you've become a liability. \nGoerdeler smiles smugly. But the smile fades when Beck turns, offering a drink to him. \nBECK (CONT'D) I'm sorry it has to be this way. \nGOERDELER Wha... What are you saying? \nBECK Fellgiebel informed me this evening... Himmler's issued an order for your arrest. You'll have to leave Germany. Tonight. When we've succeeded with the central solution you'll return as Chancellor. Until then- \nGoerdeler stands, confronting Stauffenberg. \nGOERDELER This is your doing, isn't it? ISN'T IT? You can't just get rid of me like this. I am the man Germany will follow. I'm... I... \nStauffenberg says nothing. He's too cool. Goerdeler looks at the other conspirators, but no one is going to speak for him. Finally, almost in tears: \nGOERDELER (CONT'D) Ludwig, I- \nBeck offers him an envelope. \nBECK Disappear, Carl. Avoid contact with anyone. \nUgly pause. Goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks out. We could not be happier to see him go. Beck coughs, turns to Stauffenberg. \nBECK (CONT'D) No more indecision. From now on, Stauffenberg has discretion. \n", "test2_id": 502, "test3_input": "OLBRICHT I can't issue Valkyrie again unless we follow through. If he fails to- \nSTAUFFENBERG I'll do my job.

I'd like to place a call to Bamberg, please. \nINT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BAMBERG - NIGHT \nNina and her children eat supper around a single candle, Bamberg is experiencing a blackout. Though Nina manages a tranquil facade she is anything but. \nANGLE ON: The silent telephone in the foreground. We wait for it to ring, but it never does. \nINT. CHURCH - NIGHT \nBeck enters to find Stauffenberg in the front pew, staring at Christ on the cross. \nBECK Have you made your peace with God, then? \nSTAUFFENBERG As best I can. \nBECK Then you have nothing to fear. \nStauffenberg manages a smile as Beck sits. \nSTAUFFENBERG I know the soldier inside me is a traitor. I wonder how I'll be judged as a man. \nBECK By history? \nSTAUFFENBERG By God. \nBECK In the end, we answer only to ourselves. \nStauffenberg fingers the cross and ring hanging from the chain around his neck. \nBECK (CONT'D) Did you reach your wife? \nSTAUFFENBERG Bombing in Ebingen. I can't get through. \nBECK Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg. They're safe. You've seen to that. (realizing...) To think... You came to us a wounded soldier from Africa. Now... Now you are both the architect and the assassin. I'm still trying to understand how this came to be. \nSTAUFFENBERG (more to himself) Like a farmer watching the corn grow. One day it's over his head... \nBECK What's that? \nSTAUFFENBERG Nothing... \nAnd the two men look up at the cross in silence. \n71   EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAYBREAK                         71 \nIn these waking hours Berlin appears quite peaceful. Only the distant sound of shelling reminds us that the city is surrounded by war. \n72   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS             72 \nA tawny leather briefcase sits on a neatly made bed. \nStauffenberg, freshly bathed and wrapped in a towel, shaves in front of the mirror. For the first time we see his scars and deformities in full. He looks himself over, finally focusing on the chain around his neck, contemplating the small cross and the ring - its engraving: finis-initium [end-beginning]. \nThough his face is clean-shaven now, he continues, slowly running the razor down his throat. Then he stops, pressing the blade a little too hard and bringing blood. It almost seems intentional. \nCLOSE ON: The box that holds his glass eye, staring. \n73   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BEDROOM - LATER                  73 \nStauffenberg has since mastered the process of dressing himself.

Many of the faces we recognize, some we see for the first time. We notice Witzleben has donned his old military uniform, looking a little too proud. \nBeck looks over the faces of these men, trying to contain his own fear. His eye catches the door opening and a MAN IN A DECORATED POLICE UNIFORM entering the room. We tense. \nOne by one, the men in the room stop talking, staring at the police officer. Just as we think it's over: \nBECK Gentlemen, may I introduce Chief Helldorf. He's guaranteed the full support of the Berlin Police. \nHelldorf nods. The men breathe a collective sigh of relief. Some laugh. Many shake Helldorf's hand. \nBECK (CONT'D) We can begin. \nBeck moves to a table covered with maps of Berlin, Paris and the Wolf's Lair. \nBECK (CONT'D) Hitler has scheduled a military briefing for today at one o'clock. Stauffenberg will strike regardless of who else is present. \nAs Beck speaks, we see how things should play out... \n80   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    80 \nStauffenberg and Haeften are driven in a topless sedan. Each carries his leather briefcase. \nBECK (V.O.)

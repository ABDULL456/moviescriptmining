{"test1_input": "TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM - COMMANDER OF THE GERMAN RESERVE ARMY. \nThe haggard Fromm sits at his desk, rubbing his temples. Stauffenberg and Olbricht share a confident look. Surely this guy hates the High Command. Without looking up to see them: \nFROMM What is it you want? \nOlbricht hesitates. Fromm looks up. \nFROMM (CONT'D) Well, Olbricht? Speak up. \nOLBRICHT I wanted to introduce you to our new man - Colonel Stauffenberg. \nFROMM Ah yes - the hero from Africa. I'd offer my hand but you might not give it back. \nSTAUFFENBERG I'd say the General's lost more important things this morning. \nFreeze. But after a tense beat, Fromm relaxes and laughs, taking a cigarette from a box on his desk and nudging it toward them. \nFROMM About time they put a man with balls in this office. Have a seat. (to Olbricht) You too, if you must. \nThey sit. Fromm lights a cigarette, leans back and exhales a cloud of smoke. We let things sit for awhile. The game of recruitment is about to begin and no one is sure where to start. The longer the quiet, the more awkward things seem. Finally: \nFROMM (CONT'D) They tell me you're critical of the war, Colonel. Not that you don't seem to have good reason. \nSTAUFFENBERG I am critical of losing the war, General. All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision. \nFROMM In the field, you mean. \nHe's baiting Stauffenberg to talk shit about Hitler. \nSTAUFFENBERG In Berlin. \nFROMM I take it that's why you're here. To make decisions. \nSTAUFFENBERG I've made my decision, General. I`m here to help others make theirs. \nStauffenberg makes no attempt to shade his delivery. He is quite clearly indicating that he means more. Fromm knows it, but he's being coy. \nFROMM They say when there's no clear option, one should do nothing. \nSTAUFFENBERG We're at war. We must act. Sometimes... rashly. \nFROMM Just what sort of rash action did you have in mind, Colonel? \nSTAUFFENBERG That would be a decision for the Supreme Military Commander. \nFromm is getting the message. He takes a deep drag. \nFROMM Supreme Commander, you say. \nSTAUFFENBERG Second only to the Chancellor. \nFROMM If only I were that man... This war would be going quite differently. \nOLBRICHT We were thinking the very same thing. \nFromm frowns at Olbricht. This was a bit too obvious. Stauffenberg shoots Olbricht a look. \"What the hell are you doing?\" \nFromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the ashtray and picks up the telephone. \nOlbricht and Stauffenberg steel their nerves - certain they are going to be reported. But Fromm doesn't dial. Instead, to our relief, he disconnects the line. When he is certain that it is dead: \nFROMM I don't need to remind you that we've all sworn an oath. That said, I'm going to forget we had this conversation with the understanding that such speak will never occur under this roof again. Am I clear? \nSTAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT Yes, sir. \nFROMM Tell   your friends that I always come   down on the right side. And as long   as the F\u00fchrer is alive, you know   what side that is. \nFROMM (CONT'D) (raising his hand) Heil Hitler. \n33   INT. WAR MINISTRY - CORRIDOR- CONTINUOUS                  33 \nOLBRICHT (trying to be upbeat) I think that went rather well. \nSTAUFFENBERG Yes... Quite. \n34   EXT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DAY                              34 \n", "test1_true": "Then he turns to face Nina. As always, there is much to be said that they cannot say. She gently touches the silver chain around his neck, the ring and the cross she gave him. They embrace tightly and kiss. She gets in the car, looking at him through the back window as she is driven away. \n35   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                       35 \nDarkness. As our eyes adjust we realize we are in the middle of the woods. Is this a dream? A nightmare? We are drawn toward a flickering light in the distance. \n36   EXT. FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT                            36 \nFrom out of the darkness comes a candle held by a nervous, almost mousy young woman, FRAULEIN VON OVEN. Walking just behind her is Tresckow. He carries a small but heavy case in one hand. \nThey come to a clearing in the woods and find a strange sight. In the center is a tree stump surrounded by papers, including the original orders for OPERATION VALKYRIE, next to a leather valise marked with the seal of the Reich. The orders have been meticulously annotated. \nVOICE (O.S.) Were you followed? \nFraulein Oven gasps. Tresckow turns, pistol drawn. The tip of his barrel comes up just inches from Stauffenberg's eyepatch. Stauffenberg smiles, emerging from the shadows. \nTRESCKOW Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me half to death. \nSTAUFFENBERG We'll be closer than that before we're finished. \n37   EXT. FOREST - LATER                                       37 \nWearing white gloves, Fraulein Oven opens the case Tresckow brought, revealing a portable typewriter. She carefully feeds a sheet of crisp parchment into the machine and sets the margins carefully. Pause. Then she starts typing with remarkable speed. \n(Note: The sound of typing runs throughout the scene, punctuated by the crack of the carriage return - each time a little louder.) \nStauffenberg and Tresckow carefully pore over the Valkyrie orders, scribbling copious notes. \nTRESCKOW Looking this over, I'm not satisfied that the Reserve Army is enough to shut down Berlin completely. \nSTAUFFENBERG (handing over papers) Yes, I've been giving that some thought. We should include any field units that are home on leave. \nBefore Tresckow can respond, more papers: \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) I've also drawn up an outline for orders to streamline combat groups in order to quietly concentrate forces at vital points - state and government buildings, of course, but also the radio and newspapers. \nMore papers. Tresckow can barely keep up. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Combat groups will be reorganized as reinforced grenadier regiments. One or two of them can be quickly mobilized, eliminating the usual six hour lag. We blitz the government quarter, arrest all Ministers and Party leaders, surround all SS and police barracks. Any officers who resist will be arrested... or shot. \nCRACK. A carriage return as loud as a rifle-shot. \n38   EXT. BERLIN - STREET - LATER                              38 \nA truck full of soldiers roars past. Stauffenberg, Tresckow and Fraulein Oven walk across a dimly lit bridge on a foggy night in Berlin, stopping in the middle. \nStauffenberg carries a leather valise with the Valkyrie orders, Tresckow carries the typewriter case. They stop at the center of the bridge, looking around carefully. No one is in sight, but anyone could be watching from the shadows. Eerie. \nSTAUFFENBERG (to the Fraulein) If anyone comes to you, play ignorant. Just tell them- \nFRAULEIN OVEN I'll tell that I was serving the German people. Then I'll tell them to go to hell. \nBoth men smile, a bit taken aback. Von Oven shakes each man's hand and walks away, swallowed up by the darkness. When she is gone: \nTRESCKOW To Operation Valkyrie. \nStauffenberg nods. Tresckow heaves the typewriter case over the railing and into the water below. \nSPLASH. \nThey watch in silence as the water settles, then: \nTRESCKOW (CONT'D) I've been transferred to the front. \nSTAUFFENBERG (shocked) Why didn't you tell me? \nTRESCKOW Would you have stayed? \nObviously not. Then it occurs to Stauffenberg. \nSTAUFFENBERG Do you think Fromm reported us? \nTRESCKOW It's more likely just... an unfortunate coincidence. Anyway it doesn't matter. You wrote the orders. You know them better than anyone. \nSTAUFFENBERG You don't mean to say- \n", "test1_id": 501, "test2_input": "BECK Out of the question. It won't work. We need you here in Berlin. \nSTAUFFENBERG Who else, then? Who can even get as close? \nBeck knows there is no other choice. \nSTAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Valkyrie is very clear. Once the order is given, the Reserve Army will automatically seize control of the government with or without me. \nBECK Orders are not enough. They need a man to follow. The right man. \nPause. Stauffenberg knows he's right. The fucking pressure. He thinks for a moment, then with a sigh: \nSTAUFFENBERG Olbricht will oversee operations in my absence. I can be back in Berlin three hours after Hitler is- \nStauffenberg shuts up, lowering his head in prayer as a CLERGYMAN passes. Once they are again alone: \nBECK Three very crucial hours. \nSTAUFFENBERG We both know there's no other way. \nBeck nods, resigned. \nBECK I'll tell the others- \nAs if on cue, Beck loses control of his cough. Stauffenberg leans forward, handing him a handkerchief and putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder until the old man's hacking subsides. \nBECK (CONT'D) I'm afraid whatever the outcome, I won't be there to see it. \nSTAUFFENBERG Nonsense. You're stronger than you think. You might just be the strongest one of all. \n49   EXT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BAMBERG - DUSK                   49 \nEst. The sound of children at play takes us to: \n50   EXT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BACK LAWN - CONTINUOUS           50 \nOnce again, the scene idyllic. The Stauffenberg children play football in the distance. Stauffenberg himself is out of uniform for the first time since the hospital, but he does not seem relaxed. \nNina sits across from him, half-reading a book, half talking to her husband. Stauffenberg cannot hear a word she is saying - he is miles away. \nHe looks over at his children. One would never suspect that Germany has waged a calamitous war and that the country is facing total devastation. \nNINA ...After that I thought I'd take the children to the country for a few days to see my- Claus? \nHe snaps out of his thoughts. \"Hmmm?\" \nNINA (CONT'D) Have you heard a word I said? \nSTAUFFENBERG The country... (thinking) Nina. Listen. I want you to delay your trip. Just for a while. \nShe wants to ask, he wants to tell her. Finally: \nNINA Does this have something to do with... your work? \nSTAUFFENBERG I would just be more comfortable knowing where you are - until I'm back from Berlin. Things will be different then. I promise. \nLong pause. Once again, a couple who know each other well enough to not have to say things plainly. Nina is worried but strong. \nNINA How long until... until we see you? \nSTAUFFENBERG A few days. If all goes well. Then we can travel as a family. \nNINA And if things... don't go well? \nHe hesitates. \nSTAUFFENBERG I love you, Nina. \nNINA And I love you... What- \nCHILDREN PAPA, COME AND PLAY WITH US. (Etc.) \nThe children kick the ball toward Stauffenberg - the one sport he can play. He is about to say something to Nina, but she cuts him off. \nNINA Go be with your children. \nStauffenberg stands, touching Nina's cheek and kissing her forehead. We stay on her as he joins the children. She watches them play together, seeing her husband laughing for the first time in a long while. Her eyes well with tears - a mixture of happiness and anguish. Too good to last, too much to bear. \n", "test2_true": "Haeften, Olbricht and Stauffenberg stand around a table giving their undivided attention to: \nTITLES: COLONEL MERTZ VON QUIRNHEIM - STAUFFENBERG'S REPLACEMENT UNDER OLBRICHT. \nHe empties the contents of two tawny leather briefcases onto the table: \nAlong with a crude drawing covered with calculations he produces two brick-like lumps wrapped in butcher paper, two small caps and two thin metal cylinders. \nMERTZ Two 975 gram packs of plastic-W. Enough explosive to cripple a panzer. (pointing to caps) Your detonators. (pointing to cylinders) Your fuses. British time pencils. This acid capsule is your trigger. \nStauffenberg carefully studies the items before him. \nMERTZ (CONT'D) When you're ready to arm, attach the detonator to the bottom of the time pencil, like so... (demonstrating) ...Insert the entire device into either end of the plastic-W, crush the acid capsule and you're live. When the acid eats through the wire holding back the trigger spring... Well... You'll want to be very far away. \nOLBRICHT What if they search your bag? \nSTAUFFENBERG I'm one of the inner circle now. They'll make sure I am who I am. Beyond that, they won't touch me. (to Mertz) How much time do I have? \nMERTZ Theoretically there's a 30-minute delay. But with the kind of heat you can expect at the Wolf's Lair, I'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops. \nHAEFTEN That's... hardly precise. \nMERTZ This is state of the art. You can have small or precise. Not both. \nOLBRICHT Might this be just a little too small? \nMERTZ The explosion won't do the killing. The air in the room will. \nHe points to the drawing - an overhead sketch of: \nMERTZ (CONT'D) Hitler's bunker is constructed of reenforced concrete. A steel door, no windows. Just one of these explosives in a space like that will cause tremendous air pressure. \nMERTZ (CONT'D) Enough to instantly kill everyone present. The second charge will be entirely redundant. \nOLBRICHT Of course, I'm all for redundancy. However... If, by some miracle, Hitler does survive, what then? \nSTAUFFENBERG We have an inside man at the Wolf's Lair in communications. He'll notify you immediately following the flash and then sever all contact with the outside world. \nThe others are stunned. \nOLBRICHT Just how did you manage that? \nSTAUFFENBERG It's my job, isn't it? While Hitler's inner circle is still regrouping, you will initiate Valkyrie and seize control in Paris and Berlin. Even if Hitler survives, we'll have momentum. \nMERTZ (to Olbricht) But as   you said yourself it would take a   miracle. Anyone in that bunker   when just one of these goes off is   not coming out alive. \nHaeften places the items back in the briefcases. \nOLBRICHT Himmler is expected to be at the meeting as well. Don't proceed unless you can get them both. \nSTAUFFENBERG That could be difficult. \nOLBRICHT Why kill a madman just to have a lunatic take his place? \nSTAUFFENBERG This is Goerdeler's idea, isn't it? \nOLBRICHT The members are in total agreement on this. \nStauffenberg chews on this, pissed. Then: \nSTAUFFENBERG Fucking politicians. I'll hold off if the decision is unanimous. And I want another man on the committee. A soldier. \nA soldier himself, Olbricht is insulted. \nOLBRICHT And just who this soldier be? \nStauffenberg glances at Mertz, sizing him, up. \nSTAUFFENBERG (pointing to Mertz) Him. \nOLBRICHT Him? \nMertz's eyes widen. \"Me?\" But Stauffenberg and Haeften pick up their briefcases and leave without another word. Assassins. \nOlbricht reaches for the phone and dials. \n", "test2_id": 502, "test3_input": "64   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY           64 \nStauffenberg quietly slips back into the briefing unnoticed. He freezes: \nCLOSE ON: The spot where Stauffenberg left his briefcase. Remember? Well it's gone. \nHe looks around frantically. Some officers notice him. Tension mounts. He gets Haeften's attention. \nSTAUFFENBERG (mouthing) My briefcase. \nBefore Haeften can answer, Fromm shoots them both a glare. \"What the hell are you doing?\" \nKEITEL ...Gentleman. You are dismissed. \nAnd like that, the briefing has ended. Stauffenberg is sickened - the opportunity lost. Hitler exits, walking right past him. Keitel and the rest file out. The last to leave is Fromm. \nFROMM That call better have been important. \nStauffenberg turns, coming face-to-face with Freyend, Keitel's hateful toady. He holds the missing briefcase. For a moment we're sure the jig is up. \nFREYEND Your bag... Colonel. \nHe hands it over and leaves. \n65   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - BERLIN - DAY           65 \nA military sedan skids to a stop outside the Guard Battalion headquarters. Olbricht jumps from the car, racing to get General Hase's attention. \nLARGE FORMATIONS of soldiers stand at attention in the hot sun, awaiting orders. \nHASE (whispering) What the hell is going on? My men have been standing here for an hour. I don't know what to tell them. \nCLOSE ON REMER (the officer we told you to remember) standing before the ranks. He eyes Hase and Olbricht suspiciously, trying to hear what they are saying. After a moment, Hase addresses the men. \nHASE (CONT'D) At ease, gentlemen. \nOlbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to hide his nerves. \nOLBRICHT This has been a drill. You're all to be commended for your quick response. Dismissed. \nPause. The men linger, confused until: \nOLBRICHT (CONT'D) HEIL HITLER. \nSOLDIERS HEIL HITLER. \nAnd the men fall out, nowhere to go so they just light up and shoot the shit. Hagen approaches Remer. \nHAGEN What did I tell you? A drill. \nBut Remer is not so sure. The way he stares at Olbricht makes us nervous. \nCLOSE ON: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making note of the esteemed KNIGHT'S CROSS pinned to Remer's uniform. Olbricht leans toward Hase. \nOLBRICHT That man there. Who is he? \nHASE Major Remer? He commands the Deutschland Guard Battalion. What about him? \nOLBRICHT Get rid of him. \nHASE Remer? Don't worry about him. He's an order taker. To the bone. \nAh yes... But whose orders? \n66   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OUTSIDE FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY           66 \nAs usual, Lt. Herber sits at his desk and, as usual, he tries to ignore: \nMUTED SHOUTS through Fromm's office door. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Stauffenberg and Olbricht waiting. \nThey sit across from, Freyend. A beat later, Keitel storms out of Fromm's office, his face red with anger. Deja vu. When Keitel and Freyend are gone: \nHerber looks up from his desk with a nervous smile. \nHERBER The General will see you now. \nStauffenberg and Olbricht stand, hats in hand. \n", "test3_true": "FROMM How dare you put the Reserve Army on standby without my knowledge. You damn near cost me my commission. What in God's name made you think you even had the authority? \nOLBRICHT It was only a drill. An exercise. \nFROMM DON'T LIE, OLBRICHT. Not to me. We both know it was no fucking drill. \nSTAUFFENBERG General, if I may- \nFROMM You may not, Colonel. You may not do anything. Because now you've not only shown me you can't deliver, you've painted a target on my back. If I so much as sense you trying to move the Reserve Army again, I'll personally have you both arrested. Do I make myself abundantly clear? \nSTAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT Yes, sir. \nFROMM Heil Hitler. \nOLBRICHT Heil Hitler. \nBut Stauffenberg turns to leave without answering. \nFROMM I'll hear you say it, Colonel. \nStauffenberg stops, glaring at Fromm with his one eye. He squares his shoulders, clicks his heels loudly and delivers a downright Nazi-like: \nSTAUFFENBERG HEIL HITLER. \nStill managing to make it sound spiteful. He leaves without being dismissed, slamming the door. \n68   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                   68 \nIt has been a long day, the Resistance leaders are all exhausted. Beck, Olbricht, Witzleben, Haeften and Mertz watch Goerdeler circling a rigid Stauffenberg. \nGOERDELER The point of your central solution is to replace Hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the Allies. The Allies, I suspect, would be more amenable to a truce... IF WE OFFER IT TO THEM BEFORE THEY ARE IN FUCKING BERLIN. \nSTAUFFENBERG Today was a matter of indecision - nothing more. A military operation in the hands of a politician. \nStauffenberg's lack of respect infuriates Goerdeler. \nGOERDELER I don't think I am alone when I say your judgement is in question. (to the others) I would like to take a vote. \nBECK Carl. \nGOERDELER I DEMAND THAT WE RELIEVE COLONEL STAUFFENBERG. \nBECK Carl, if I may have a word with you in private. \nGOERDELER If you have something to say, Ludwig, say it here. Say it now. \nBECK Very well. There's no need to vote. \nBeck turns to the bar, pours two drinks. Stauffenberg stiffens, ready for the axe. \nBECK (CONT'D) I consider you a friend. And I look forward to the day when we can once again live as free men. But you've become a liability. \nGoerdeler smiles smugly. But the smile fades when Beck turns, offering a drink to him. \nBECK (CONT'D) I'm sorry it has to be this way. \nGOERDELER Wha... What are you saying? \nBECK Fellgiebel informed me this evening... Himmler's issued an order for your arrest. You'll have to leave Germany. Tonight. When we've succeeded with the central solution you'll return as Chancellor. Until then- \nGoerdeler stands, confronting Stauffenberg. \nGOERDELER This is your doing, isn't it? ISN'T IT? You can't just get rid of me like this. I am the man Germany will follow. I'm... I... \nStauffenberg says nothing. He's too cool. Goerdeler looks at the other conspirators, but no one is going to speak for him. Finally, almost in tears: \nGOERDELER (CONT'D) Ludwig, I- \nBeck offers him an envelope. \nBECK Disappear, Carl. Avoid contact with anyone. \nUgly pause. Goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks out. We could not be happier to see him go. Beck coughs, turns to Stauffenberg. \nBECK (CONT'D) No more indecision. From now on, Stauffenberg has discretion. \n", "test3_id": 503}

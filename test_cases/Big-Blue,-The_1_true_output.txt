Stare out to sea. 
ROBERTO (after a while) Enzo, what are you going to do with the money? 
ENZO Have the car painted. 
ROBERTO Santini will do that for 25 dollars! 
ENZO Then tell him to wax it too. 
ROBERTO Enzo, really.  What are you going to get? 
ENZO (thinking) A rosary for Mama, a dress for Angelica, something with rhine- stones for what's her name, and get yourself a suit that fits... But most important... 
ROBERTO Yes? 
ENZO Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol. 
EXT.  FLAKES OF SNOW - MOUNTAINS - DAY 
Mountain peaks, stark and white.  A winter sky which is strangely and disquietingly dark.  A landscape swept by snow. 
SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN: PERU - LAKE HUACRACOCHA - MAY 1987 
A yellow light comes out of the storm -- advances toward us.  The headlight of a train. 
A narrow gauge locomotive steams up grade pushing piles of snow in front of it. 
INT.  TRAIN - DAY 
Sitting in the train, leaning against the misty window, JOHANA CROSS, 27, has clear quick charm and a sort of romantic fragility.  She is dressed simply but warmly. She looks through the window; all she sees is white. 
It is clear that she was not the one who decided on this trip.  Reading the key phrases from a beat-up note book, she calls upon an old Peruvian. 
JOHANA (in Spanish) Is this the Lago del Demonio? (Es bien aqui el Lago del Demonio) ... Huacracocha? 
The old man goes into a long, rambling explanation. JOHANA nods without understanding a thing. 
JOHANA Gracias. 
OLD MAN You welcome. 
EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAY 
The train pulls in, slowly pushing piles of snow in front of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which serves as the station. 
A man, FRANK, bundled in a parka, comes out of a snowmobile parked by the station, and walks up to the train. 
JOHANA steps down, carrying her suitcase and drops two feet in the snow as she comes off the last step.  FRANK walks over and leans down towards her. 
FRANK (smiling) Welcome to Peru! 
INT.  SNOWMOBILE - DAY 
FRANK throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile, jumps in and turns the ignition on.  JOHANA takes her hat, scarf and gloves off.  FRANK glances over at her, he is both amused and charmed. 
JOHANA Don't you have a heater? 
FRANK (hitting at the dashboard) Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru? 
JOHANA Does anybody live to make a second? 
FRANK smiles and kicks the heating system, then leans over to check it, his eyes off the road. 
JOHANA (a little worried) Forget about the heater! 
EXT.  LAKE OF THE DEMON - CAMP - DAY 
The storm is at its peak.  The frozen snowmobile plows along side the lake HUACRACOCHA and stops in front of a cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow. 
FRANK gets the bags out of the back.  The suitcases are by now frozen stiff.  JOHANA follows in his steps. 
A couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in attempt to protect themselves from the storm. 
JOHANA is bewildered.  Shacks in the middle of the Andes, the lake of the "Demon", and now llama that have to be pushed aside to enter one's home. 
As FRANK opens the door, a man is leaving the hut.  The man is JACQUES MAYOL.  JOHANA and JACQUES pass each other in slow motion.  Everything seems suddenly suspended: time, sound, cold... 
JACQUES MAYOL instantly makes an impression on her.  He is now 34, still dark-haired, with dark eyes.  He is wearing a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles.  He looks like some legendary creature one would dream about. 
Everything finally regains its formal speed.  The door slams, the man is gone.  She and FRANK are in the middle of the entrance hall.  JOHANA hasn't yet gotten over the vision she has just had, but she regains composure and enters the next room. 
INT.  QUONSET HUT 
JOHANA happily takes her gloves off. 
FRANK puts down the bags and walks into the next room. It's a sort of laboratory, filled with ultra modern equipment. 
A big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a long wooden dock. 
Sitting in a corner, an old Peruvian man is preparing hot drinks.  JOHANA drops into a chair.

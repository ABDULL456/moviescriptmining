THROUGH the window, we see Gordy delivering Luis to a Latin man, clearly Luis's father and the bodega's owner. We don't hear the words, but we can tell Gordy's complimenting the boy to his dad. 
Gordy emerges.    Checks his watch.   Whistles up a taxi. 
26   INT. TAXI - DAY                                                   26 
Traffic jam on Park Avenue South. Gordy's anxious. Checks his watch. He's late. To the cabbie -- 
GORDY Try Fifth. 
27   EXT. 68TH AND MADISON - DAY                                       27 
Anne waits on the corner with Matt, playing with his spaceship. She checks her watch. It's five of twelve. 
28   INT. TAXI - DAY                                                   28 
Fifth Avenue's also a parking lot. 
GORDY Shit. 
He jams money in the pay dish. 
GORDY I'm getting outta here. 
29   EXT. FIFTH AVENUE                                                 29 
Gordy exits the cab and takes off running. 
30   ANNE                                                              30 
checks her watch again.   She's pissed now. 
In b.g., a cop leaves his police cart to write a ticket. 
A caravan of Lincoln Navigators passes Anne and turns east on 68th. 
31   GORDY                                                             31 
turns onto 68th. As he runs, he jumps, trying to see Anne and Matt over other pedestrians. 
32   ANNE                                                           32 
In b.g., the Navigators pull up at a building flying the Colombian flag. Latin and American men in suits get out of the Navigators. 
33   EXT. 68TH - BETWEEN FIFTH AND MADISON                          33 
Gordy dodges pedestrians.     Still trying to get a glimpse of Anne and Matt. 
The cop we saw writing tickets earlier is walking the other way. Gordy nearly collides with him. At the last moment, the traffic cop shuffles Gordy aside. 
GORDY Sorry. 
Gordy reaches the corner. Sees Anne and Matt. Whistles. In b.g., behind Gordy, we see the cop get into a brown Ford. 
34   ANNE AND MATT                                                  34 
hear the WHISTLE.     Matt sees Gordy. 
MATT There he is. 
Matt waves. 
35   GORDY                                                          35 
waves back, shrugs an apology to Anne as he starts across the street, when... 
36   INTENSE FLASH                                                  36 
suddenly lights up the intersection. 
In SLOW MOTION: 
37   SHOCK WAVE                                                     37 
wave rolls up 68th past Madison... 
38   HUGE BALL OF FLAME                                             38 
erupts behind Anne and Matt... 
We hear the ENORMOUS BANG of the explosion... 
39   WINDOWS                                                       39 
are sucked into millions of fragments, a hailstorm of glass... 
40   GREAT CHUNK OF METAL                                          40 
-- an engine block -- flies from the ball of flame... 
41   ANNE                                                          41 
instinctively pulls her child to her... 
42   GORDY                                                         42 
sees the engine block tumbling through the air toward his wife and son. 
His scream is lost in the thunderous ROAR all around. 
43   GORDY'S POV - IN SLOW MOTION                                  43 
The engine block is about to hit Anne and Matt, when... 
A FedEx TRUCK, WINDOWS SHATTERED, SKIDS past, wiping out Gordy's line of sight. When the truck clears... 
Anne and Matt are gone. The corner's empty.   Just Matt's spaceship, slowly falling to the ground... 
44   BACK TO SCENE                                                 44

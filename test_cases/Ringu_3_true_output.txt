Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away. 
TOMOKO The other day, I... I watched this strange video. MASAMI Where? 
TOMOKO With Youko and them. 
MASAMI (excited) So thats what Ive been hearing about you doing some double-date/ sleepover thing!  So, you and that guy Iwata, huh? 
TOMOKO No, its not like that.  Nothing happened! 
Their eyes meet and Tomoko half-blushes, looks away again.  Her expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation. 
TOMOKO Iwata... he found this weird video. Everyone was like, Whats that? so he put it on and we all watched it. 
MASAMI (quietly) And?  What kind of video was it? 
TOMOKO Just... weird, I cant really explain it.  Anyway, right after we finished watching it, the phone rang.  Whoever it was didnt say anything, but still... 
Silence.  Masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked. 
MASAMI Jesus. 
TOMOKO It's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the rumors. 
Tomoko looks seriously over at her friend. 
TOMOKO (cont'd) That was one week ago today. 
There is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything. 
MASAMI Waaait a minute.  Are you faking me out? 
Tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile. 
TOMOKO Busted, huh? 
They both crack up laughing. 
MASAMI Oh, my... I cant believe you! 
Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee. 
MASAMI (contd) Youre terrible! 
TOMOKO Gotcha! 
MASAMI (thinking) But hang on... you really stayed the night with Youko and Iwata, right?

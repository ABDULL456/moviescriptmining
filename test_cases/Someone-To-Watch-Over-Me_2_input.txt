CLAIRE I wouldn't have missed it, Tony. 
ANTONIA You look so beautiful... 
ANTONIA looks up to see MIKE. 
CLAIRE This is Mike Keegan, the policeman assigned to protect me.  Antonia Bolt... 
She looks up to SEE MIKE:  it directs others to do the same. 
MARGE (change of tone) Hello. 
CLAIRE (introducing) Marge Woodwin, Antonia Bolt, this is Mike Keegan... 
MIKE (ultra respectful) Hello... (a deferential nod to Antonia) ... Ma'am. 
ANTONIA (liking him; to Claire) He's got nice eyes.  Very gentle. (re: Mike's embarrassed reaction) And he blushes.  I like that.  Take good care of her. 
INT.  THE RECEPTION - LATER - NIGHT 
CLAIRE in the thick of things -- a BAND PLAYING NOW -- occasionally glancing at MIKE -- who stands against a wall, ever watchful... 
CLOSE ON MIKE: TURNING to see a VERY PRETTY YOUNG THING come up to him; just "oozing" seduction. 
PRETTY YOUNG THING I hear you're a policeman. 
MIKE nods; eyes fixed on CLAIRE. 
MIKE Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman. 
PRETTY YOUNG THING Ever shot anyone? 
MIKE Yes. 
PRETTY YOUNG THING Does it make you... hard? 
MIKE ... Hard? 
PRETTY YOUNG THING Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man. 
MIKE'S eyes register abject dumbfoundment. 
MIKE Would you excuse me, please? 
HE PUSHES TOWARD CLAIRE, catching her eye. 
MIKE Would you consider leaving here pretty soon? 
CLAIRE relaxed, clearly having a good time. 
CLAIRE People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal. 
MIKE (confidential) Hey!  There are crazy people here. 
CLAIRE Let's get a drink. 
MIKE Ah... I shouldn't... on duty. 
She plows toward the crowded bar, just inside the ballroom entrance, MIKE following. 
CLAIRE I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee. 
MIKE I'll come with you. 
CLAIRE I think I can probably do that on my own. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  Not amused.  CLAIRE heads to the ladies' room across from the bar.  MIKE watches her enter.  Turns back to the bar, which is very busy and confused. 
MIKE (irritated) Gimme a spritzer, and a... vodka martini. 
MIKE seeing the Pretty Young Thing. 
MIKE Make it a double. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT 
as a pair of WOMEN finish their "touch-up" and head out, making way for CLAIRE to step up to the mirror to assess herself.  The room momentarily empties.  Putting her purse down she moves to a stall and enters. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BAR COUNTER - NIGHT

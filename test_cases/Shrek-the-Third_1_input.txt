SHREK Back to what? Being a loser?! 
As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone too far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to yank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from the decking. 
SHREK (CONT'D) Now look what you did! 
ARTIE Look what I did? Who's holding the wheel chief? 
Donkey climbs up onto the railing. He is seasick and is about to puke when he sees jagged rocks ahead. 
DONKEY (SWALLOWING; THEN SHOUTING) Shrek! 
Shrek desperately sets the wheel back down and tries to steer the ship clear of the rocks. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 59. 
The camera pans past the boat. Off-screen we hear the boat crash into the rocks. 
SHIP CAPTAIN (O.S.) Land ho! 
EXT. BEACH - DUSK 
Shrek, holding Puss and Donkey, staggers onto a small beach. He glares at Artie who pulls himself out of the surf. Shrek drops Puss and Donkey. 
Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously. His fur puffs up into a fro. He drops his head in shame. 
PUSS How humiliating... 
SHREK Oh, nice going, Your Highness. 
ARTIE Oh, so now it's "Your highness?" What happened to "loser?" Huh? 
SHREK Hey, if you think this is getting you out of anything, well it isn't. We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another, and you're gonna be a father! 
Artie raises an eyebrow. Puss and Donkey stare at Shrek uncomfortably. 
ARTIE What? 
DONKEY (clearing his throat) A-hem. You just said father... 
SHREK You're... I said king. You're gonna be King! 
ARTIE (IMITATING SHREK) "You're gonna be King!" Yeah right. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 60. 
Artie shakes his head and marches down the beach toward a path into the woods. 
SHREK Where do you think you're going? 
ARTIE Far Far Away... from you! 
SHREK You get back here young man and I mean it! 
Artie keeps climbing. 
PUSS Uh boss, I don't think he's coming back and maybe it's for the best. He is not exactly king material. 
Shrek looks towards Artie. 
DONKEY When were you planning on telling him that you were really supposed to be King? 
SHREK Oh c'mon, now why would I do that? Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me. 
Shrek starts off after Artie. Donkey jumps in front of Shrek. 
DONKEY Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then you're gonna have to change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with this kid. 
Beat. 
SHREK You're right, Donkey. 
Shrek picks up a piece of driftwood. 
SHREK What about this? 
Donkey shakes his head in disgust. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 61. 
DONKEY Shrek! 
Shrek tosses the log. 
SHREK Oh c'mon. It's just a joke. (LAUGHS) Still... 
Shrek walks off, trying to catch up to Artie. 
EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER 
Artie marches up the mountain trail. 
Shrek thinks for a moment and then tries a different tactic with the kid. He catches up to Artie. 
SHREK Listen Artie... 
Artie looks back over his shoulder. He sees Shrek and just keeps going.

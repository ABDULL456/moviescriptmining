CAPTAIN Have them run diagnostics on her. Make sure she's not malfunctioning -- EEYAH!! 
...and reveals WALL-E. Everyone stares at him. Long awkward pause. Wall-E innocently motors over to the Captain. Shakes his hand. 
WALL-E Wall-E. 
Leaves a CLUMP OF DIRT in his palm. The Captain stares at it. Turns to Auto. 
CAPTAIN Have "Wall-E" cleaned. 
INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 
The elevator opens. Gopher's transport drives out. Both Eve and Wall-E strapped on it with energy bands. The typing-bot has now mastered waving. Waves an enthusiastic goodbye. Wall-E tries to get Eve's attention. 
WALL-E Ee-vah? 
She gives him the cold shoulder. Refuses to speak to him. Wall-E shrinks. 
The transport exits the lobby. 
BACK UP IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS 
CAPTAIN Analyze. 
The CLUMP OF DIRT is suspended in a beam of light. It rotates. The captain sits at his vanity console. ANALYSIS DATA scrolls on a HOLO-SCREEN. 
SHIP'S COMPUTER Analysis: foreign contaminant. Substance is a three phase system composed of various combinations of naturally derived solids. Subject is most commonly referred to as "soil", "dirt", or "earth". 
The last word piques his interest. 
CAPTAIN Earth? 
His eyes drift to a GLOBE on his shelf. 
CAPTAIN Define "Earth"... 
SHIP'S COMPUTER "Earth" - the surface of the world as distinct from the sky or sea. 
Dozens of IMAGES OF LAND pop up on screen. Lush, green, colorful, inviting. He's fascinated. Takes it all in. 
CAPTAIN Wow... Define "sea". 
SHIP'S COMPUTER "Sea"... 
EXT. AXIOM/CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME 
THROUGH THE WINDOW we see the Captain. Glued to his screen. Filled with ocean images. 
SHIP'S COMPUTER ...an expanse of salt water that covers most of the Earth's surface and surrounds its land masses... 
The CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY from the window... ...Moves aft to the Axiom's stern... ...Pushes in... 
INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL 
M-O continues to clean WALL-E'S FILTHY TRAIL. Oblivious to everything around him. Cuts through traffic. Robots crash into each other in his wake. M-O doesn't notice EVE AND WALL-E'S TRANSPORT drive past. They hover down a corridor, and enter... 
INT. REPAIR WARD - CONTINUOUS 
It's a fully automated clinic for broken bots. Day care for the malfunctioned. The REJECTS are kept in FORCE FIELD PENS. Dozens line the walls. 
Eve and Wall-E stop at the INSPECTION STATION. Robotic ORDERLY-ARMS activate. Wall-E shrinks. Watches them systematically check in Eve. Perform an I.D. scan. Attach a RED "DEFECT" BOOT to her head. A button is pressed on the boot. Eve goes into "sleep" mode. Lifted off the transport. 
WALL-E (beeps) [Where are you going?!]

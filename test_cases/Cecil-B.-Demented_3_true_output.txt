WANNA BET?! LEWIS gives an expert karate chop to DRIVER who in turn uses a few quick karate moves of his own on LEWIS. PETIE jumps in and picks up DRIVER and throws him into display case out front of theater, smashing the glass and knocking DRIVER unconscious. 
101. INTERIOR THEATER. 101 CECIL pulls HONEY away from AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS to escape but stops and poses with HONEY for a celebrity polaroid with a bunch of ACTION FANS. 
102. EXTERIOR PATTERSON THEATER. 102 PETIE is gunning the motor of Hiway Film Delivery truck with LEWIS aboard as DRIVER lies unconscious on ground. CECIL, HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES come running out of theater and pile on to truck as ACTION FANS chase after them, cheering and begging for autographs. 
PETIE peels out the truck, as one diehard FAN keeps running along so HONEY can finish signing her signature, hanging out the back of truck. 
FADE OUT. 103. Fade in to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. NIGHT. 103. We hear a jazzy, gospel-influenced rap song being DJ'd by LEWIS and sung by CHARDONNAY on soundtrack entitled "DeMented Forever." 
104. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 104. PETIE, dressed in mourning, brands CECIL on the arm with the CECIL B. DEMENTED logo as SPROCKET HOLES lie exhausted, awaiting their turn for the brand, nursing their wounds, loading their guns, and eating junk food. CECIL, bandaged, filthy, wide-eyed in directorial fanaticism rants to his followers below. 
CECIL .The slash and burn of the white hot metal will brand you forever with the logo of Cecil B. DeMented... Wear the privileged scar of cinema sainthood with pride and horniness... LYLE projects the dailies of the day on wall as he pops Percodans. HONEY, out of her cell and unguarded for the first time, watches her "stunt" footage with pride as she gets the vodka bottle from their filthy dirty freezer and goes about the ritual of making the perfect martini. LEWIS, proudly displaying his brand, DJ's the music as CHERISH writhes in a sexy go-go dance for CECIL. CHARDONNAY painfully caresses her fresh brand and wails out the chorus of "DeMented Forever." HONEY empties ice tray into martini shaker. 
CECIL .There is no such thing as family. We are the orphans of cinema and without our movie, we do not exist!... PETIE approaches CHERISH with the red hot brand and she eagerly sticks out her. arm. 
CHERISH My real life began in the cinema... PETIE brands CHERISH's arm. 
CHERISH (Writhing in pleasure) And it will end in the cinema! 
SPROCKET HOLES (Singing along with CHARDONNAY) 
DEMENTED FOREVER! PETIE turns to PAM, DINAH and LYLE with branding iron. 
PAM (Holding out her arm bravely) From the valleys of Lebanon... PETIE brands her arm and she laughs at the pain. 
DINAH .to the jungles of Cuba... PETIE brands her arm and she smiles in fanaticism. 
LYLE (Shooting up in his leg) Film revolutionaries can never be stopped! PETIE brands him but LYLE feels no pain. 
SPROCKET HOLES (Singing along with CHARDONNAY) 
DEMENTED FOREVER! Shot of HONEY pouring vodka into shaker. RODNEY turns to RAVEN whose eyes light up in satanic glee. 
CECIL (Squeezing out the bullet from his injury) .Rodney died for the roots of cinematic rebellion... HONEY stops making martini and quickly checks her hair to see if any dark roots are showing and smiles at 
RAVEN. 
CECIL .and he's now in cinema hell where one day we'll all be reunited. RODNEY brands RAVEN. 
RAVEN (Eyes rolling back in head) 
PLEASURE IS PAIN! SLAVERY 
IS FREEDOM! SUICIDE FOR SATAN! HONEY scientifically adds one drop of vermouth to martini shaker and looks up sharply at the mention of suicide and gives RAVEN a stern but motherly disapproving look. RAVEN looks away guiltily, feeling HONEY's influence. 
LEWIS 
(BLURTING OUT) But our film could be a hit even after we're dead, right, Cecil? CECIL smiles egotistically and joins in chanting with zombie-like SPROCKET HOLES. 
CECIL AND SPROCKET HOLES 
DEMENTED FOREVER! A distracted HONEY expertly shakes her martini happily. PETIE turns towards FIDGET with the brand and FIDGET begins playing pocket pool frantically in fear. HONEY takes chilled martini glass from freezer. CECIL sees FIDGET's fear and nods to DINAH to turn on video footage with remote. FIDGET looks sad to see his PARENTS flash on the TV screen taped from WJZ TV news show. 
FIDGET'S MOM .Fidget is a good boy and we love him... 
FIDGET'S DAD .And we'll stand behind our son no matter what he's done. 
FIDGET (Suddenly brave, to PETIE) NO! I want to go home!

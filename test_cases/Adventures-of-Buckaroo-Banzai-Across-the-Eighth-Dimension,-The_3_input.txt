BUCKAROO BANZAI What? How do you know that? 
RAWHIDE It's all on the record. Come on- 
Buckaroo heading up the stairs... 
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY...BUCKAROO MOVING QUICKLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR with his men, being debriefed on the run: 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body? 
PERFECT TOMMY Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey... 
RENO ...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo? 
PERFECT TOMMY Lizardo caused it all.  Because he was already here on earth, screwing around with his own stupid Overthruster. 
RAWHIDE Faulty design.  It sucked. 
RENO ...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else? 
PERFECT TOMMY It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI It?  Who does? 
INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	261 
Professor Hikita and his assistant toil away, starting at... 
...an elaborate electron-tube apparatus that just now beings to produce TINY GLOWING GREEN PARTICLES... 
...the professor excited, confused...rechecking Buckaroo's EQUATION ON HIS FOREHEAD by looking into a mirror. 
INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	264 
...while Billy places John Parker's UNUSUAL YELLOW RECORD on a turntable in Buckaroo's cluttered office...Casper and Scooter and the Cavaliers seeking protection behind a PLEXIGLAS 'BLACKBOARD', their faces seen through a maze of mathematical symbols and equations... 
...Buckaroo at his messy desk with a can of beer, FASCINATED TO SEE HE STILL POSSESSES ENOUGH STATIC ELECTRICITY IN HIS HAND TO DRAW A SHEET OF PAPER UP FROM THE BLOTTER LIKE A MAGNET! 
RENO Stand back, man... 
...as the needle now comes down on the yellow disc, and amid a flurry of SMOKE AND SPARKS, A GORGEOUS BLACK HUMAN FEMAL sizzles up from the grooves of the record and hovers in mid-air...A HOLOGRAM! 
HOLOGRAM Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.  I am John Emdall from Planet 10. A common grave danger confronts both our worlds. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	267 
Meanwhile out in the corridor, Mrs. Johnson advances with a load of cold beers and Birdseye burritos...passing by a figure frozen in the shadows...OUR POV: THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR.  Mrs. Johnson gone, none the wiser. 
INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	268 
Mrs. Johnson entering, dropping some of her load in shock at the sight of beautiful John Emdall floating free in the center of the room... 
MRS. JOHNSON Oh, wow... 
Reno picking her things up, as Mrs. Johnson backs away from the HOLOGRAM and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the corner of Buckaroo's desk... 
JOHN EMDALL After a bloody reign of terror, the hated leader of our military caste, the self-proclaimed "Lord" Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as your Hitler was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and condemned, along with several hundred of his followers, to spend eternity in the formless void of the Eighth Dimension. Death was deemed too good for their ilk. 
RENO Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see her? 
MRS. JOHNSON She's not in her room...I looked. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Will everybody please shut up so I can hear this thing? 
JOHN EMDALL Were it not for the experiments of your father and Professor Hikita and the real Doctor Lizardo, then John Whorfin would still be locked safely away on another plane of existence. 
Rawhide and Pinky Carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere in the room... 
PINKY CARRUTHERS "John Parker" I think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike dressed up in aluminum foil.  With a weird album...how the hell was I supposed to know he came from outer space? 
Buckaroo moving dangerously close to the HOLOGRAM... 
John Emdall suddenly pointing right at the great man...	273 
JOHN EMDALL And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally helped John Whorfin further with your Oscillation Overthruster! For our intelligence warns us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back through the Eighth Dimension...and on to Planet 10! If he should attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. 
PERFECT TOMMY An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American first strike!

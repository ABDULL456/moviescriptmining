BAM! The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER. The Man looks at the dog and says -- 
THE MAN IN BLACK Stay. The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey -- uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound -- then A PISTOL COCKS behind him -- Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist: 
MEACHAM Palms to heaven, Friend. The Man freezes. Turns up his hands. 
THE MAN IN BLACK Been shot. 
MEACHAM Only two kinds of men get shot -- criminals and victims. (steps forward; hard) Which one're you? 
THE MAN IN BLACK don't know. Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening... 
MEACHAM Got a name, son? 
THE MAN IN BLACK Don't know that either. 
MEACHAM What do you know? 
THE MAN IN BLACK (a beat; then) ... English. Off Meacham, INTRIGUED -- we CUT TO: 
INT. CHURCH RECTORY - LATER 
A CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and Meacham's studying The Man's wound: 
MEACHAM Odd wound. Looks... cauterized. (off The Man's look) Means somethin' burned it half closed. The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts -- 
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet? The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?" Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle -- 
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Try'n hold still. He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces slightly, but bears the pain. 
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Where'd you ride in from? 
THE MAN IN BLACK West. Woke up in the desert. Looking up at the sun like I'd been dropped outta the sky. 
MEACHAM Seems I remember a story about that happening once... fella by the name of Lucifer. 
(GRINS) How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for short. But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror: his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS -- 
MEACHAM (CONT'D) That blood yours or somebody else's? 
THE MAN IN BLACK Three men rode up. Drew on me. 
(STILL CONFUSED) My hands... moved on their own. 
MEACHAM 
(A BEAT) Anything else you wanna confess to while you got my attention? And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but: 
THE MAN IN BLACK Everything that happened before I woke up... (shakes his head) It's gone. 
MEACHAM Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for your sins if you don't recall 'em. That bein' said... Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n' brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT -- 
MEACHAM (CONT'D) I seen bad men do good things and good men do bad things. Whether you end up in heaven or hell... it's not God's plan... it's yours. 
(BEAT) You just got to remember what it was. The Man considers. Darkly -- 
THE MAN IN BLACK What if I don't want to remember? 
MEACHAM 
(BEAT; GRINS) Then you're probl'y goin' to hell. On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire -- 
MEACHAM (CONT'D) Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men! WHOOPS and HOLLERS and GUNSHOTS outside! The Man whirls to see A DOZEN MEN ON HORSEBACK, marauding through town --

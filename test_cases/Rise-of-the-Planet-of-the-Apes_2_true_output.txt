EXT. ATRIUM/TREE - DAY 
Caesar sits high in the tree, looking down at the apes. Rocket's part of the group again, but no longer the Alpha. Caesar's got his eye on CORNELIA, a FEMALE APE, standing with a group of females. He follows her movements with his eyes... Maurice climbs up next to Caesar. 
MAURICE Why cookie Rocket? 
CAESAR Need strong. All apes strong. 
MAURICE No understand. Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT. 
CAESAR Gorilla. He breaks another twig. 
CAESAR (CONT'D) Orangutan. He breaks another. 
CAESAR (CONT'D) Chimpanzee. He grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together - now they can't be broken. 
CAESAR (CONT'D) Apes.

RODNEY (CONT'D) Hey - you are not allowed back 
THERE - Will ignores him, keeps going. 
EXT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY 
Caesar sees Will coming. He turns his back, heads to a common area away from the bars. Will runs up to the cage.

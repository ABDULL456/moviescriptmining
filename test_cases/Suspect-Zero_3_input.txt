FADE IN: 
...on a BLACK WAVE - vast, oceanic, and coming right at us. BEGIN TITLES. 
The wave is relentless, huge, menacing. We can't tell if this is daytime or night because it simply obscures everything - noisily. It sucks, it yawns, it roars. 
Then we realize... this massive wave of darkness is actually just a RUN-OFF of dirty black WATER alongside the edge of an Interstate. We PULL OUT OF IT now... 
...to find concrete, and garbage, and weeds. END TITLES. 
1   EXT. DITCH - OFF THE INTERSTATE - 4:30 A.M.                      1 
Amongst the refuse is a discarded MILK CARTON, resting on its back. The carton asks "Have You Seen Me?" above a photographed face that's been obscured by grime. 
Yellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers... in that bed of untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows through it all. We stay with the carton... 
Then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep RUMBLE grows in the distance, becoming a ROAR. The yellowed newspaper lifts off and whips past us. 
...as an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, just a blur in the corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness. 
Then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. The milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed. 
A LIGHT RAIN begins to fall... and some of the grime washes away from that milk carton, revealing a face. A child. "Have You Seen Me?" It's heartbreaking. TILT UP... to take in the vast flatness of Texas' I-35: concrete forever. In the distance, gray highway yields to black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently over endless prairie. 
A vertical vein of LIGHTNING streaks through one of them. 
CUT TO: 
...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee. 
2   INT. "THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER" - GAINESVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING 2 (4:30 A.M.) 
HAROLD SPECK sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. A family man. Reads "Rod and Reel" magazine. Has a SALESMAN'S CASE by his side. Around him is a TRUCK-STOP in twilight: 
Truckers at the counter, Elvis on the wall, a "Drink Bud!" mirror. The WORLD SERIES can be heard on a RADIO... 
DOLLY (O.S.) Top that off for ya, Hon? 
That's DOLLY, a waitress, (50, been here too long.) Speck looks up, smiles thinly, "No." Dolly heads off. Speck returns to his article, underlining a particular passage. 
...until a MAN seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite Speck's. Speck reacts, startled. 
SPECK Jesus... 
The MAN's name is O'RYAN. We only see PIECES of him: his eyes, his hands, a stain on his parka... 
O'RYAN What's in the case? 
SPECK I'm sorry? 
O'RYAN You're always lugging that case around. I'm curious. 
Speck looks around: there are plenty of empty tables in here. So why is this guy bothering me??? 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) What do you sell? 
SPECK I'm... in restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name? 
O'RYAN Must travel a lot, huh? 
Speck is looking for Dolly, a Manager, anyone... 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Whole country, or just hereabouts? 
SPECK I don't mean to be rude but-- 
O'RYAN How's your wife feel about it? 
That spun things a bit. Speck pauses. 
SPECK What? 
O'RYAN She must get lonely, with you gone all the time. Does she? 
SPECK Look, I... 
O'RYAN Do you get lonely? 
Speck's so thrown now he can't answer. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Ya miss fucking her, Harold? 
SPECK Listen, I don't know who you are but you can't-- 
O'Ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. On it is a DRAWING. The image faces away from us. But Speck can see it in rich detail. And his eyes go wide. 
We catch GLIMPSES: The color of flesh. A body-part. Looks like a rendering of a young, naked WOMAN. 
And, just like that, Speck finds himself STARING. Glued.

JESSE and BRAD rest on a bench in their uniforms as MARK an ERIC do push-ups. The COACH stands on a blocking sled with PLAYERS Pounding into it. 
WALSH C'mon girls, those are love taps! (sees Chuck give a weak block) Potter, show me you're a dog. 
CHUCK Aww, coach. 
WALSH You know the drill. The other PLAYERS begin a BARKING CHANT. CHUCK strips off his helmet, jogs to the bench and opens a styrofoam cooler, within it are slabs of raw steak on blood soaked ice.. 
WALSH Show me you're a dog, Potter. The barking rises as the PLAYERS psyche up CHUCK, who chews off a bite of the raw meat. JESSE whispers to MARK... 
JESSE I hate this bullshit. 
MARK Not me. I love it. MARK pops up, grabs a steak, rips off a bite, and runs full tilt at the, blocking tackle, smashing into it with meaning. 
WALSH You're a piece of work, Bing. MARK takes a bow as he jogs away, chewing. He spots the SHERIFF's CRUISER pulling --p to the practice field. 
INT. A BUS - DAY 
RACHEL hugs her dog, who 'Looks a mess; hind legs bandaged, a funny cone around his head. TWO OLD LADIES are staring at RACHEL, unsure if they're more appalled by her appearance or the doge. WALSH c `1.O . ) Show me you're dzgs'.

WALSH drill sergeants over MARK and the other PLAYERS as they do drills. The CHEERLEADERS run their practice in the' background. on the sideline, SHERIFF KELTON is talking to ERIC, who's sweating bullets as he fiddles with his helmet. MARK watches ERIC, so intent he bobbles a ball thrown to him. 
KELTON So, you're saying you never met or talked to Lisa Parker? 
ERIC No, sir. Never. KELTON produces the photo of LISA and ERIC. 
N Eric, who's this you're hanging onto, a ghost? ERIC blanches. MARK watches KELTON leading ERIC away with WALSH. 
KENNEL - DAY A pinball machine as MARK plays, applying some body English to it. A wired ERIC enters, a bundle of violent energy. 
MARK What happened? 
ERIC 
(ANGRY) Kelton, man, with that sheriff's badge he pulled out of a cereal box. Somebody told him I did Lisa. He nails me with a picture of me and her, starts talking statutory rape. 
MARK Relax, that's bullshit. Your dad's a lawyer, he'll kill that talk dead. 
ERIC So I'm suspended. And Coach, Coach he up and does this scene where he says, "give me your helmet." 
MARK What about Carlin? 
ERIC What about Carlin? Game of the year, football scouts are gonna be there and I'm gonna be sittin' on the bench with my thumb up my... (shoves the machine in anger) You said you were gonna get the pictures. 
MARK I tried. That Rachel bitch wouldn't give'em to me.. 
ERIC She's the one who put me and Lisa together. Shit. what are we gonna do, Mark? 
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

BRAD Who's place is this, again? 
CHUCK Nimrod. It's Carlin's quarterback. MARK and ERIC pull up in Mark's Mustang convertible. 
MARK

{"train": "Traffic by Stephen Gaghan \n\"TRAFFIC\" \nBy \nStephen Gaghan \nBased on the miniseries \"Traffik\" \nBy \nSimon Moore \nEXT. COLUMBUS, OHIO - DAY \nThe state capital of Ohio.  It's an impressive building for a city this size. \nSUPERTITLE: COLUMBUS, OHIO - STATE CAPITAL \nINT. OHIO STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY \nIn chambers striving for august, JUSTICES listen to a lawyer MR. RODMAN, argue his case before the highest court in Ohio. Mr. Rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice. \nMR. RODMAN This informant, paid by the police, using taxpayers dollars to continue his felony drug habit, was the link which allowed police to raid a private farm.  A working farm.  A farm where honest Americans make their living. \nOne particular justice, ROBERT WAKEFIELD, younger than the others, is clearly bemused by this performance. \nMR. RODMAN The government, in its haste, has employed an army of criminals whose allegiance to the truth is, at best, questionable -- \nJudge Wakefield interrupts -- \nROBERT Mr. Rodman...it's too bad your client didn't show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney... \nA polite chuckle from the justices -- \nROBERT Lately the only variation I'm hearing in your argument is the name of the client.  And you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates, but you aren't going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants. (beat) Furthermore, there is no sacred protection of property rights in the United Sates.  When you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm, whether it's one joint or an acre of plants, your property can be seized and your property can be sold. \nMR. RODMAN I'm sorry the court finds my argument repetitious. \nROBERT Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of advice?  The next time you argue this point before this court, regardless of my whereabouts, I recommend you have something up your sleeve other than your arm. \nINT. ROBERT'S CHAMBERS - DAY \nThe office is marble and dark wood.  A young CLERK, black, 29, enters carrying an oddly-shaped gift.  They both look at it. \nCLERK What do you think it is? \nROBERT Depends who it's from. \nCLERK (reading the card) Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson. \nROBERT You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me. (re: the elaborate box) Definitely third category. \nCLERK What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar? \nROBERT Depends on the state. \nCLERK (checks) Arizona. \nROBERT Medicinal marijuana initiative. (beat) Or am I being cynical? \nThey both laugh.  Robert reaches up and pulls a bottle of Scotch from a shelf.  He pours a couple of fingers in two glasses. \nCLERK Maybe there's a book in it. \nThe clerk takes one of the glasses. \nROBERT Not by me. \nThey toast and drink. \nEXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY \nRobert exits, trailed by a small group of reporters.  He gets into a car being driven by two security TYPES. \nINT. AIRPLANE - DAY \nRobert sits in a business class window seat. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nAn expensive hotel.  Robert Wakefield stands at the window, looking at the view of our nation's capital. \nSUPERTITLE: WASHINGTON D.C. \nON THE TABLE \nThe remnants of a meal.  It was a steak and a small caesar salad.  The wine glass is half-empty. \nANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT \nIn front of the mirror now, trying on a dark, tasteful jacket. \nCLOSER \nOn Robert in the same position, only now we are in HIS HOME. It's daytime, and his wife BARBARA is helping him into this same jacket.  As her hands dust the lint off his shoulders \nWE MATCH CUT TO: \nROBERT \nIn the hotel rooms, making the same motions.  Satisfied, he straightens, then turns to look at himself. \nOMITTED \nANGLE ON ROBERT \nSALAZAR (to Javi) One question.  How did you find about this? \nJAVIER An informant. \nSALAZAR What is the name of your informant? \nJAVIER (beat) It was an anonymous tip. \nSalazar looks at Javi a beat. \nSALAZAR (to his men) For a State Police officer, you're very well informed.  Let's go. \nMOMENTS LATER Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of vehicles drive away. \nJavier lights a cigarette. \nMANOLO Wasn't that General Salazar? \nJAVIER Yeah. \nMANOLO What's he doing up here? \nJAVIER I don't know.  Something. \nThey start for their car. \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nEXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY \nSUPERTITLE: SAN DIEGO \nTwo men, RAY CASTRO, 30's, proud, ambitious, and MONTEL GORDON, 40's, suspicious of everyone including himself and always, always the smartest guy in the room, walk from a Lincoln Towncar toward a dumpy office.  Castro is talking under his breath -- \nCASTRO No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways. (beat) How're you feeling? \nGORDON (keyed up) I feel good. \nCASTRO No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh? \nGORDON Nope. \nCastro stretches his arms, swings them around. \nCASTRO Limbering up, gonna stay loose, keep it all together.  Take this motherfucker down. \nThey reach the door to the office.  Gordon looks at Castro, then turns the handle. \nCASTRO Showtime. \nINT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY \nIt's a cluttered, rundown working office unusual only in the extent of its ordinariness.  A SECRETARY goes about her business like a somnambulist.  CLERKS shuffle and file. \nCastro switches into Spanish -- \nCASTRO (in Spanish) Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen. We're looking for Eduardo Ruiz.  We have a two o'clock appointment. \nINT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - LATER \nIn a back alcove, Castro and Gordon sit across a cheap table from EDUARDO RUIZ, 40's, an entrepreneur in an expensive suit and bad hairpiece.  They are waiting. \nRUIZ You ever buy a quarter ton?  Not many people have. \nAnother \"businessman\" enters from another door and whispers in Ruiz's ear, then leaves again. \nRUIZ So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City -- \nGORDON Nobody said shit, Eduardo -- \nOne of Ruiz's hands dips under the desk where we see a handgun is holstered on the underside. \nRUIZ Relax.  We're waiting, that's it. \nCASTRO Hey, you want to hear a joke?  I got a joke.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume? \nGORDON Chill out -- \nCASTRO It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume? \nRUIZ I don't know. \nCASTRO 'Cause they're ugly and they stink. \nCastro laughs uproariously. \nINT. DEA SURVEILLANCE SPACE - DAY \nON FUZZY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO: Castro laughing.  Ruiz politely smiling, one of his hands hidden by the table. \nGORDON Man, you never been close enough to a woman to know how she smells. \nDEA AGENT (V.O.) What's his hand doing?  Watch his hand.  Anybody?  I don't like the hand. \nIN THE OFFICE \nThe room is filled with crappy surveillance equipment.  DEA AGENTS, in DEA logo'd outerwear, jiggle a monitor fuzzily displaying the view from another hidden camera: Gordon and Ruiz around the cheap table. \nDEA AGENT This is ridiculous this fucking thing. (taps monitor) Look at this shit -- the first television transmission.  I had better shit when I was the AV guy at junior high, swear-to-God. \nANOTHER DEA AGENT Come on, Castro, pay attention. Watch his damn hands. \nON THE MONITOR \nCAROLINE Entertainment.  The Susan Lucci section or Banal Love Songs of the Nineties? \nSeth looks at her.  He has a crush. \nSETH Banal Love Songs it is. (hits keys) Hey, you wanna try something? \nShe nods.  They both take a swig of beer.  He takes her hand pulling her past the stoned people on the couch -- \nIN THE KITCHEN \nSeth takes out a box of baking soda.  He tears off a square of aluminum foil.  He takes out a spoon.  Caroline watches as he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon.  He adds a pinch of baking soda.  He puts in a few drops of water. Stirs it around with the heel of a lighter.  Then holds the flame under the spoon. \nCAROLINE What are you doing? \nSETH (concentrating) Just watch. \nHe watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and bubbles, then separates... He pours the most viscous part onto the aluminum foil, making four separate little puddles. \nHe quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen, making a straw.  He hands it to Caroline. \nSETH Inhale the smoke and hold it. \nCAROLINE What is this, like freebase? \nSETH Not like.  It is. \nHe lights the flame under the aluminum foil.  The puddle crackles and pops, then starts to smoke -- \nSETH Go...  Go! \nThere's a rush of thick grey smoke.  Caroline catches most of it. \nSETH Hold it. \nShe pulls it in deeper and holds... Suddenly her expression changes... Her eyes lose their focus, her face slackens, an almost sexual response.  Seth is watching her intensely. \nSETH See... Now, you see. \nCaroline slumps back against the counter.  Seth moves against her, kissing her, running his hands over her breasts and body.  She stares over his shoulder, holding it as long as she can. \nFinally she exhales -- \nCAROLINE More. \nThe cloud of grey smoke from her lungs fills the room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE HOUSE OFFICE - DAY \nThe White House CHIEF OF STAFF meets with Robert Wakefield. The Chief of Staff has the floor; he always has the floor. \nThis is a man you do not want to disappoint. \nCHIEF OF STAFF Until you officially take over the office of National Drug Control Policy, under no circumstances should you speak to the press unprotected, without going through this office or having someone in the room.  There are a lot of interests in this town and, right now, they're all scared of you.  The reason they're scared of you...technically, you have veto power over their budgets.  So think about that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS, TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio Shack and the DMV, they're all gonna want to speak to you.  And that's the good news... You'll also be meeting Senators and Congressman, each with a specially prepared question.  Their question is designed for one thing: to make them look smart.  If you lecture them, they won't think you respect them.  If you respond with utter humility, they will.  Remember, this is about your respect for them, and the President's respect for them. Speaking of which, as soon as he gets back from Russia and China, we'll get you in there for some face- time, let the two of you catch up. (beat) It'd probably be a good idea for you to meet your predecessor.  I'll have Jeff Sheridan take you over. Also, four weeks from today you will give your first official press conference.  In it you will outline the President's strategy for winning the war on drugs. (beat) Okay, anything else? \nROBERT I'll be sure to let you know. \nINT. EXECUTIVE BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY \nRobert makes his way through a warren of hallways in the endless corridors of the Old Executive Building alongside JEFF SHERIDAN, 35, an enthusiastic government employee who has found his place. \nSHERIDAN I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you. \nROBERT Like you protected Landry? \nSHERIDAN I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for. \nINT. OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY - DAY \nRobert and Sheridan enter the office of outgoing Drug Czar, GENERAL RALPH LANDRY, 60's, buzz-cut, professional soldier with a sense of humor. \nLandry is putting some personal items in a box. \nGENERAL LANDRY Jeff, you want to excuse us for a minute? \nSheridan nods and leaves. \nGENERAL LANDRY (bemused, off Sheridan's exit) Functionaries.  Nice people, the Schedule C's.  About twelve graduate degrees apiece, but it seems sometimes all they do is start rumors. \nRobert and Landry shake hands. \nROBERT You've done a fine job here, Sir. The Office of National Drug Control Policy is in better shape than when you found it. \nLandry tries to determine whether Robert believes this.  He looks around the office as if the policy is hiding somewhere. \nGENERAL LANDRY I'm not sure I made the slightest difference. (wistful) I tried...  I really did. \nROBERT There are a lot of encouraging statistics.  The work's just started, but I intend to see it through. You've got my word on that. \nGENERAL LANDRY You're here for two years, three maximum.  What'd they promise you? Court appointment?  What?  District? Appeals? (checks Robert's reaction) Not Supreme... Supreme? \nROBERT I've come in to do a tough job and that's what I'm going to focus on. \nGeneral Landry SIGHS. \nGENERAL LANDRY When Kruschev was forced out, he sat down and wrote two letters and handed them to his successor.  He said \"When you get into a situation you can't get out of, open the first letter and you'll be saved.  And when you get into another situation you can't get out of, open the second.\"  Soon enough this guy found himself in a tight place.  So he opened the first letter.  It said, \"Blame everything on me.\"  So he blamed the old guy and it worked like a charm. (beat) He got into another situation he couldn't get out of, so he opened the second letter, which read, \"Sit down and write two letters.\" \nThey stare at each other a beat.  Then Landry smiles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MANOLO'S STREET, MEXICO - DAY \nA cinderblock house.  Kids and dogs in the street.  A face we recognize as Manolo's peers out of a curtain into the street. \nINT. MANOLO'S KITCHEN - DAY \nEveryone laughs.  Helena is by far the youngest in her crowd. \nALEX It's a very fatty bird.  All that winter insulation.  Just like me. \nNAN You mean all breast, just like you. \nALEX You're bad -- \nNAN (singsong) Jealous, that's all -- \nHELENA I've heard... I can't remember where... That it's full of that good kind of fat, the kind you're supposed to eat -- \nSTEWIE Unsaturated fat -- \nTWO WOMEN IN UNISON Polyunsaturated. \nHELENA And now there's a good cholesterol and bad cholesterol.  Everything they tell you completely changes every other week.  I don't know why they think we should listen at all. \nNAN What I know is ducks, as cute as they are, were designed by God to be eaten. \nNan reaches for a taste and the other women lean forward also, a sea of inanity swirling around Helena's salad. \nEXT. COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - DAY \nHelena buckles her little boy, DAVID, 5, into the front seat of her Mercedes.  He won't let go of his putter. \nHELENA I'll put this in the back. \nDAVID No -- \nHELENA All the professionals keep them in the trunk. \nDAVID Not Tiger Woods. \nHELENA Especially Tiger Woods. (sharing a secret) ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat. \nShe pulls the putter away from the reluctant boy and sets it on the back seat. \nEXT. HOTEL - DAY \nA modern high-rise on the waterfront playground of San Diego. \nHelena passes the hotel in her car. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nA standard room looking out at the water which is dotted with sailboats and cruise ships.  The bed is covered with hi- tech surveillance equipment. \nThe equipment salesman, LONNIE, 40's, who makes a fetish of gadgetry, explains the finer points of operation to FRANCISCO \"FRANKIE\" FLORES, 30's, sallow, watery-eyed, in expensive clothes. \nLONNIE Gates, Myrhvold, Bezos.  I sell to all those guys.  Why?  Because the technology to intrude has reached the masses.  Your competitor, your ex-spouse, adversaries, stalkers, they're at the local electronics store right now, and they're gonna be intruding on you not only through your telephone, but your fax, cell phone, pager, cable TV, Musak, windows, walls, air conditioning ventilation, modem, and internet connection. \nHe walks over to the bed and the sexy equipment -- \nLONNIE Nobody has these babies, no way, not the shiznit. \nFrederico picks up a piece of equipment. \nFRANCISCO I want to intercept cell phone calls, digital and analog.  And locate the source of the call.  I need databasing capability, to cross-reference calls and numbers. \nLonnie lovingly picks up a laptop computer with a sleek device attached to it -- \nLONNIE Your Cellular Secretary, friend across all the digital wireless spread spectrum. (beat) So, Francisco, what do you do?  You a PI?  Private security? \nFrancisco looks at Lonnie coldly. \nFRANCISCO Assassin. \nLONNIE (not missing a beat) Assassin, okay.  Let's get you started in surveillance. \nEXT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nThe house takes up most of one of the nicest blocks.  PEOPLE enter and party VOICES drift out. \nSUPERTITLE: GEORGETOWN, WASHINGTON, D.C. \nINT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nA power cocktail party in full swing.  This is where most of the business in Washington gets done. \nRobert, scotch in hand, listens to a smug PHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYIST explain the world. \nPHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYIST We in the legal drug business, and I mean Merck, Pfizer, the rest of my very powerful clients, realize this isn't a war with a traditional winner and loser, but an organism at war with itself, whose weapons of mass destruction happen to be intoxicants. And if you want a body count look no further than alcohol which racks up 80,000 kills a year.  Cocaine manages a measly 2,000.  Same for Heroin. But, the big daddy is Big Tobacco which kills 380,000 each year, which, by the way, is more people than have been killed by all the illegal drugs in the last century. \nROBERT (faking it) That's very interesting. \nThe lobbyist smiles.  Robert sips his drink. \nANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT \nIn another room.  Listening to STAN, overweight advocate for the United States Council of Chambers of Commerce. \nSTAN It's time, Robert, to choke some honesty out of these rural legislators; get'em to fess up that it's pretty much Prisons or Casinos in terms of their choices for economic growth. \nANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT \nlistening to ETHAN, earnest advocate of harm reduction. \nETHAN What's the difference between Prozac and Ecstacy, you ask?  One's a mattress and the other's a trampoline. Molecules don't have morality. Really, think about it: some molecule changes the way a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor works, it's not suddenly a bad molecule; it's just a molecule. My theory: America has a real fear of short, intense experiences. \nRobert turns away -- \nROBERT (under his breath) Like you. \nANOTHER ROOM Robert at the bar getting another scotch.  A secretive man, TIM, 40's, nerdy, sidles up beside him and whispers furtively in his ear. \nTIM (whispering) Chemicals?  Some say problems, others say solution.  Imagine a cloud that when it rains prohibits the growth of poppies or takes the THC out of marijuana.  Imagine a pill that eliminates any psychological craving, from Dilaudid to Dove Bars.  Law enforcement hasn't let science sit on the sidelines.  Addiction is no more relevant than polio or the Black Plague. \nEXT. AYALA HOME - LA JOLLA - DAY \nA starter castle high in the hills near Mount Soledad, an exclusive neighborhood with views of the ocean.  Joggers jog to the SOUNDS of tennis and Jacuzzis gurgling, and lawn care equipment operated by Mexicans. \nBehind the Ayala gate we see David playing with his golf club on the lush lawn. \nWorkers set-up the party under the direction of a professional party planner. \nA BMW 740il with tinted windows pulls into the driveway. \nDAVID Daddy! \nThe window lowers and we see CARL AYALA, 40's, handsome, charismatic, second generation American, in expensive, conservative clothes, covering his cell phone as he greets his kids. \nCARL Hello.  Hello. \nHe goes back to his phone call, pulling around to the garage. David goes back to his game. \nINT. AYALA DINING ROOM - DAY \nThere are MAIDS in the house and a COOK in the kitchen.  The large rooms are filled with fine art. \nHelena Ayala sits at the dining room table with plans, bills and receipts spread before her.  Carl enters and paces around the room, continuing his cell phone conversation. \nCARL (into phone) I'm sorry, Jonas.  I don't care if that is the price you have gotten in order countries. \nHelena watches her husband pace as he talks.  He can't help it, but a portion of this call is theatrical, for an audience's benefit, which in this instance happens to be his wife.  Helena's expression of annoyance resets itself into love. \nCARL This is America, a different country. I am Carl, a different man.  So you see, everything about our situation is different and I believe the pricing will be different, too. (beat, listens) You're a reasonable man... So take the weekend to think about it. \nCarl clicks off the phone, turns to Helena. \nCARL Every day with this guy is like starting all over again. \nCarl winds down and finally becomes present in the room with his wife.  He looks at her.  She looks back. \nCARL Hi. \nHELENA Hi. \nCARL What's up? \nHELENA Just watching you. \nCARL I got that.  How was your day? \nShe pushes the topiary away from her.  Suddenly, she seems tired.  Carl comes over and puts his hand on her pregnant belly. \nCARL You all right? \nHELENA I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something. \nHer husband watches her, then wraps his arms around her. \nEXT. AYALA HOME - DAY \nCarl and Helena step out on the front porch of their home and watch David play with his golf putter. \nOUTSIDE THEIR GATE \nAn unmarked police car rolls up and stops behind the wall. Another arrives and another and another.  OFFICERS in DEA jackets exit the cars. \nThere is MURMURING, then SILENCE. \nHelena slowly turns to look at her husband.  He doesn't look at her. \nHELENA David, come inside -- \nSuddenly, POLICE and DEA enter the front yard.  Gordon and Castro enter the yard and move quickly up the drive to Carl. \nCARL What is this?  What is going on? \nGORDON Mr. Ayala? \nCARL That's right. \nGORDON You're under arrest for violation of Federal Narcotics laws. \nGordon and Castro spin him, cuff him, and without emotion begin pulling him from his yard.  David is trying to get to his father.  In a kind of shock.  Helena trails after him. \nCastro drags Carl into the street toward the open door of the cruiser.  He pushes him down into the backseat. \nGORDON We have a warrant to search your home, Mrs. Ayala. \nGordon hits the side of the cruiser and it pulls away.  Carl looks at his wife through the window. \nGordon and Castro head up the driveway toward her house. \nHelena is left standing in the street.  NEIGHBORS, who have appeared in front yards and at the ends of driveways, stare at her with suspicion.  David approaches and holds onto her leg. \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED \nINT. SALAZAR'S HEADQUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY \nJavi and Manolo wait in Salazar's anteroom.  A ceiling fan swirls the air.  After a moment the door opens and an AIDE motions to them.  They stand. \nAIDE (to Manolo) Not you.  You. \nJavi goes into the room. \nINT. SALAZAR'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe office is Spartan and military.  Salazar and Javi sit facing each other.  Salazar looks at a piece of paper. \nSALAZAR Javier Rodriguez.  Twenty-nine years- old.  Graduated from Montessori school.  Five years as a beat cop in TJ.  Three years with the State Police.  Parents died four years ago in their apartment from carbon monoxide poisoning because they could not afford to fix their gas heater. Your sister works in a Maquiladora in Juarez, making designer blue-jeans. On the police force three years, you currently make 316 dollars a month. \nThey all look at each other.  Caroline sips her wine. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SAN DIEGO JAIL - DAY \nIn the intake area of a busy San Diego precinct, Helena sits on a bench and regroups.  Detectives move past her. Handcuffed criminals are separated, bagged and tagged. \nbeautifully dressed man, ARNIE METZGER, 30's, super- lawyer, knows everyone from the top of the system to the bottom, slick but likable, smart and ruthless, too, separates himself from a DETECTIVE he's gladhanding and approaches Helena. \nARNIE Helena, I'm so sorry -- \nHELENA Arnie, thank God. \nMetzger sits, giving her a hug. \nHELENA Can you please tell me what on earth is going on? \nArnie looks at her as if to say, \"do you really not know?\" \nThen, he speaks quietly with his hand in front of his mouth. \nARNIE I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good. \nHELENA Why are you talking like that? \nARNIE Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me? \nHe checks to see if this is registering. \nARNIE Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it? \nHELENA Arnie, this is crazy. \nHe makes eye contact with her. \nARNIE Got it? (she slowly nods) Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard. \nHELENA What is he being charged with? \nARNIE I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important. \nHELENA Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass. \nARNIE That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children. \nEXT. BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY \nHelena exits.  Her expression is set as she drives.  She turns a corner in the shopping district, passing JAVIER AND MANOLO who are walking down the street.  Tourists, drunk Marines and the homeless piss away another day. \nWe follow them into a bar with blackened windows and a discrete sign. \nINT. BAR - DAY \nThis is a place where men come to meet men.  And it's already lively even at this early hour.  Javier and Manolo find a seat and wait. \nLATER Javi is working on his second beer when he seems to recognize somebody. \nACROSS THE ROOM \nFrancisco \"Frankie\" Flowers has entered the bar.  Javi watches him circulate through the room then settle at the bar.  Javier finishes his beer, rises, and takes the empty seat next to Francisco.  Manolo watches. \nVery quickly Javi strikes up a conversation.  We don't hear what they're saying but it doesn't matter because Francisco clearly likes Javi. \nOff Francisco's anticipatory smile -- \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nEXT. MILITARY BASE - MEXICO - DAY \nThe back of a blue van opens and a blindfolded Francisco falls onto the ground. \nSurrounding him are Javi and Salazar, who watch as two of Salazar's MEN drag Francisco away toward an abandoned mission- style building. \nSALAZAR (clearly pleased with Javi) I'm curious how you did this with such economy. \nJAVIER Everybody has a weakness. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SOMEBODY'S PARENTS' MANSION, CINCINNATI - NIGHT \nWith its old-growth trees and manipulated shrubbery, the large house is shrouded in the mystery of well-heeled suburbia.  It is very late. \nINT. SOMEBODY'S PARENTS' MANSION - NIGHT \nSomebody's parents are out of town and the house feels empty. Big empty rooms with expensive furniture nobody sits on. \nFaint MUSIC echoes through the house. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHigh ceilings of a 1930's kitchen.  Vodka bottles and cranberry juice and limes are spilled across a counter.  ON THE RHODES AGAIN by Morcheeba plays from a jam-box on a counter. \nMaybe ten TEENAGERS are partying hard in this kitchen.  It's weird and disassociated, people wandering in and out, playing with kitchen utensils, heavily fucked up. \nThere are drugs on a mirror on the eat-in table.  Caroline and Seth and two friends sit around this table.  VANESSA, 16, almost pretty, is hitting a freebase pipe and holds the hit.  FUCKED-UP BOWMAN, 17, super-preppy with a wan, Baby Huey face, takes a slug of vodka. \nThey are jittery, sweaty, tweaked, fucked-up -- \nCAROLINE All I'm saying, what I'm saying, is it never seems like anybody ever says anything that matters to them, like we all look at each other and nod with responses we've been trained to make, not real responses, just social conventions, phony, fake smiles, surface bullshit... I mean, we're all smart and do we have any idea what each other are like, really like?  Do I know what Seth's afraid of, or Vanessa, or fucked-up Bowman? \nEveryone looks at Fucked-up Bowman who grinds his jaw appreciatively -- \nCAROLINE ...Probably, but do I ever say this stuff, just say, \"hey, I'm uncomfortable in this crowd, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, either? I know you're afraid and it's okay-- \nCaroline leaves the study and shuts the door harder than necessary. \nRobert and Barbara look at each other, raising their eyebrows and breathing deeply -- \nROBERT I think she's lying. \nBARBARA Me, too. \nROBERT (reaching a decision) We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing. \nBARBARA Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried -- \nROBERT Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that. \nBARBARA Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is? \nROBERT This is different. \nBARBARA Why? \nROBERT To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old. \nBARBARA I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space -- \nROBERT Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct? \nBARBARA We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences. \nRobert looks at his wife, then it dawns on him. \nROBERT How long have you known about this? \nNo response. \nROBERT (yelling) How long have you known? \nBARBARA Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank -- \nROBERT Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent. \nBARBARA She asked me not to. \nHe leaves the room. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRobert is in the hallway, at Caroline's door.  He opens it and we get BLASTED WITH MUSIC. \nCaroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on. She faces the window and moves back and forth, back and forth. \nRobert calls her name, but the SOUNDTRACK is drowning him out. \nHe calls again, this time apparently loud enough for her to hear.  She takes the headphones off - the MUSIC stops - and turns to look at him.  Or rather, she looks right through him, as though he didn't exist.  Robert is so taken aback by the coldness of her gaze that he doesn't speak. \nShe turns away from him and puts the headphones back on. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MILITARY BASE - MEXICO - DAY \nJavier and Salazar walk across the base.  Salazar is feeling ebullient and it shows. \nSALAZAR You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog. \nJAVIER But will he be house-trained? \nSALAZAR When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall. \nThey enter the barracks. \nINT. CELL - MEXICAN MILITARY BASE - DAY \nIt's pitch black in the cell.  There's a human in here, but we can't see him. \nSuddenly the door is thrown open and light floods in, illuminating a very broken Francisco Flores. \nThe figure of Commander Salazar fills the doorway. \nSALAZAR This is shameful.  A disgrace. Francisco Flores -- \nFrancisco cowers in the corners -- \nSALAZAR It's all right, son.  It's all right. Salazar is here.  You're among gentlemen, now.  This shameful treatment will stop immediately. (calling out) Guard! \nA GUARD appears in the doorway.  Francisco is spooked. \nSALAZAR I want to know who is responsible for this treatment. \nGUARD Yes, sir! \nSALAZAR We aren't barbarians. \nGUARD Yes, sir! \nSALAZAR Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten? \nGUARD I don't know, sir. \nSALAZAR (to Francisco) You will dine with me from now on. \nFrancisco moves closer to Salazar already feeling safe in his presence. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTHOUSE, SAN DIEGO - DAY \nA packed courthouse.  Carl is at the defense table.  He doesn't look at Helena who sits in the gallery next to Arnie Metzger. \nEXT. LA JOLLA PLAYGROUND - DAY \nHelena reads a book, Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert, and keeps an eye on David, who is playing on the monkey bars. \nACROSS THE ROAD at a careful distance is the ubiquitous telephone repair van.  On the roof a parabolic mike swivels around. \nINT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - DAY \nCastro and Gordon watch Helena via a small surveillance monitor. \nGORDON You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona. \nCASTRO Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here. \nGORDON He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you. \nCASTRO Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers? \nGordon looks at the monitor -- \nGORDON What do we have here? \nON THE MONITOR: David kicking a soccer ball with an older strange man, TIGRILLO, Latino, 40's, fit and tough looking. \nThe man is very good.  He juggles the ball and bounces it off his head and David follows him away from the center of the playground. \nEXT. PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS \nHelena notices David moving away while playing with the man. She follows, then begins to jog after them. \nHELENA David, come back here this minute. David! \nAs she closes distance the man stops juggling the ball and abruptly picks up David and begins swinging him around by his arms.  David is having fun as Helena approaches. \nHELENA David -- \nDAVID We're playing! \nThe strange man swings David up so that he's under his arm. \nSTRANGE MAN Yeah, this is fun. \nHELENA Please put down my son. \nThe man holds David. \nSTRANGE MAN Shouldn't let your kid wander off with strangers. \nHELENA Thank you.  That's a valuable lesson. David, come on. \nThe strange man holds David tighter so that he's no longer having fun.  He begins to wriggle -- \nSTRANGE MAN Mrs. Ayala -- \nThis gets her attention -- \nSTRANGE MAN Your husband owes a lot of money. Enough that snapping this kid's neck wouldn't nearly cover it. \nDavid begins to cry.  Helena looks around wildly for help. \nSTRANGE MAN You better come up with it in a hurry or your kid is going to disappear, and he won't turn up until the evening news. \nHe drops David who runs to his mother. \nSTRANGE MAN You get exactly one warning. \nThe strange man moves away across the field. \nSTRANGE MAN The first payment is three million dollars. \nHe continues walking away. \nINT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - DAY \nGordon and Castro stare with rapt attention. \nGORDON Are you getting this on tape? \nCASTRO I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT \nJavier and Manolo stand guard outside the front door of the dining hall.  Javi smokes a cigarette. \nMANOLO A group of us are going out tonight. \nJAVIER Who? \nMANOLO Guzman, Tomas, Esteban -- \nJAVIER Your new friends. \nMANOLO Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come? \nJAVIER Not this time. \nINT. DINING HALL - BARRACKS - NIGHT \nFrancisco and Salazar eat at a beautifully set table.  They are waited on by military officers who serve perfect flan at the end of the meal. \nFRANCISCO In my home I have B&W speakers.  I recently purchased a compact disc burner.  I can make my own cd's, with whatever music I like, as if I bought them at the store, only I don't have to pay these crazy prices. \nSALAZAR We have much in common.  We both attended school in the United States, and both of our fathers are engineers. \nFRANCISCO I got into stereo equipment when I was a kid.  Some people don't notice the difference but it is very important to me. \nEXT. AYALA HOME - AFTERNOON \nHelena carries the cups down the driveway.  She presses a button and the gates swing open. \nINT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - AFTERNOON \nGordon and Castro listen to their headsets.  Suddenly -- \nVOICE (O.S.) (over their headsets) Okay.  She's coming out.  She's leaving her property.  Okay, she seems to be heading for the van! She is approaching the van! \nCastro and Gordon looks at each other. \nGORDON What do we do? \nCASTRO I don't know. \nThere's a KNOCKING at the door of the van. \nGORDON What do you think she wants? \nCASTRO She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids. \nGordon opens the door.  Helena is standing there with the lemonade. \nHELENA I so hope I didn't startle you.  I thought you might like some cold lemonade. \nGORDON Uh... Thank you. \nShe hands the cups to him.  Helena gathers herself. \nHELENA I know this is a difficult situation and you're only doing your jobs.  I don't bear you any ill-will, but I do have a small favor to ask. \nCASTRO You want to ask us a favor? \nHELENA A man threatened my children. These charges have attracted a lot of attention and it seems to be bringing all the nut-jobs out of the nut jar. (beat) Would you keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary.  I don't know what else to do. \nGORDON Of course, we will. \nHELENA Thank you. \nThey shut the door to the van and sit for a moment. \nCASTRO It's probably poisoned. \nGordon takes a big sip of his. \nGORDON It's good.  Not too sweet. \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nEXT. TIJUANA STREET - MORNING \nThis is a questionable neighborhood pushed up against the edge of poverty. \nAnna hurries across the street. \nEXT. JAVI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING \nAnna walks up the stairs of a rundown building.  She passes two PROSTITUTES loitering in the stairwell. \nShe knocks on a door and Javi, half-dressed for work, answers. He's surprised to see her. \nJAVIER Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want? \nANNA I can't find Manolo. \nJAVIER He's not here. \nANNA He never came home last night.  Was he with you? \nJAVIER No. \nHe lets her into the apartment. \nINT. JAVI'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nA small, clean room with a partition for the sleeping area. \nANNA I'm worried.  Last time he was out late, I went through his clothes while he was asleep. \nShe pulls out a plastic packet with the scorpion insignia and 911 stamped on it. \nJavier thinks a beat. \nJAVIER I'll find him. \nEXT. ALLEY - TIJUANA - DAY \nJavi slams Manolo against the side of building. \nJAVIER What the fuck are you doing? You're supposed to be at work. Look at you. \nManolo is sweaty and crazy-eyed. \nMANOLO It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with. \nJAVIER Oh, really.  General Salazar was there? \nMANOLO No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us. \nJAVIER Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up. \nSeth prepares the drugs by the light of the mini-fridge. \nSETH I love this place. \nSeth dumps the drugs on the bedside table.  From other pockets he extracts aluminum foil, lighter, tube.  She trails away watching him fix the first hit. \nSETH Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy? \nCAROLINE I think so.  If she didn't she should have. (checks her watch) I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home. \nSETH Why?  Nobody's there. \nHe prepares the first hit.  She does it and lies back.  He does one. \nCAROLINE (blowing out the hit) The maid... They ask her what time I get back.  She spies for them. \nSeth starts kissing her.  They try to get into it, but both of them are thinking about the drugs. \nCAROLINE I wish we could stay here.  Just be here forever and ever.  Make it a little home. \nShe leans over to snort a tiny line of heroin. \nSETH I want to have sex and do a hit right as we're coming. \nCaroline's distracted by the line she's snorting.  After a while... \nCAROLINE Okay. \nSeth begins undoing her jeans. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EPIC BUNKER LOBBY - DAY \nSUPERTITLE: EL PASO, TEXAS \nRobert and Sheridan listen to the official tour of the EPIC center delivered by the SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE, 40, a sincere weight-lifter with a sincere crew-cut. \nSPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE ...Over 200 DEA field agents, a budget of almost 100 million dollars and state of the art communications equipment make the El Paso Information Center the Drug Enforcement Administration's flagship for the 21st century. \nINT. EPIC BUNKER CAFETERIA - DAY \nA huge lunchroom.  Long plastic institutional tables and agents minding their own business, \nRobert, Sheridan, and their Epic Guide walk through.  They pass a wall of black and white head shots -- \nROBERT Who are these guys? \nSPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE Agents who died in the field. \nEXT. BINOCULAR POV - DAY \nof large mansion with manicured grounds.  The back lawn is filled with children, balloons, a merry-go-round, and pony rides.  It's a sumptuous children's birthday party. \nSPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE That house, that you see from the DEA headquarters, belonged to Porfirio Madrigal -- the Lord of the Skies, largest trafficker in Mexico. \nANGLE ON ROBERT \nlooking through the binoculars. \nROBERT He died in a liposuction surgery, right? \nSPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows? (beat) Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha. \nBINOCULAR POV: a child running in circles holding a clutch of colored balloons. \nROBERT Who do we interface with on their side? \nSPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE What do you mean? \nROBERT I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side? \nSPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person. (thinks) See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized. \nEXT. TRAMAC - DAY \nRobert, walking with purpose, leads his group to their plane. \nINT. MILITARY JET - DAY \nRobert and Sheridan and several DEA, Law Enforcement, and Military Officials.  It's a nice plane, used for important people and Robert has the best seat. \nROBERT I want everyone thinking out the box for a second.  What are we gonna do about Mexico? (silence) Come on, guys.  Out of the box. \nThe men on the plane just stare at him.  Finally the REP FROM DEA leans forward. \nREP FROM DEA Unlimited funds? \nROBERT Unlimited. \nREP FROM DEA From a DEA standpoint we need a vetted task force and matching funds.  And cut the red tape on getting them equipment and training. \nRobert turns to the others. \nROBERT Come on.  I want to hear from everyone: FBI.  Customs.  Treatment. Is there anyone from treatment on this plane? (no one answers) Then I want an answer for why there isn't anyone from treatment. (beat) Look, we know we have to bust one of these cartels, Juarez or Tijuana, not just as a symbol, but hell yes, also as a symbol - they are symbols - and there's nothing wrong with sending a message.  That's why when Carlos Ayala hired Michael Adler lead defense, I flew Ben Williams to San Diego to prosecute.  Because he's the best we have, he's our symbol that we're serious about putting the top people away. (beat) So, as of right now, this flight only, consider the dam on new ideas thrown open. \nStill, no one else says anything.  They watch Robert impassively. \nROBERT If I'm not mistaken, we got DEA, Pentagon, U.S. Attorneys office, about a billion dollars of budget right here.  So what are you people waiting for? \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED \nEXT. SAN DIEGO OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nEstablishing shot of a tall glass building in the downtown skyline of San Diego. \nJAVIER This is why Salazar is so interested in cleaning up Tijuana.  Madrigal, who's supposed to be dead, owns him. And Madrigal is making a move on Juan Obregon. \nJavier calmly drives away. \nMANOLO Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi -- \nJAVIER We keep our mouths shut. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARBARA'S CAR - NIGHT \nBarbara drives Robert home from the airport.  There's a sense they've been silent for a while. \nROBERT I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to. \nBARBARA Does this mean you're going to be gone more? \nA long silence. \nROBERT Possibly. \nAnother silence. \nBARBARA You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter. \nROBERT Barbara -- \nBARBARA Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert. \nROBERT The first thing we have to do is present a unified front. \nBARBARA If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole. \nROBERT Look, I'm as worried as you are -- \nBARBARA No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar. \nROBERT Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too. \nShe looks at him, stung. \nBARBARA I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello. \nROBERT I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different. \nBARBARA Oh, it is? \nROBERT Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death. \nEXT. WAKEFIELD HOUSE - NIGHT \nHe car pulls into the driveway.  Robert gets out.  Barbara doesn't.  He looks back at her. \nBARBARA Why don't you go in and tell your daughter how bored you are. \nShe puts the car in reverse and drives away.  He stands for a moment, steaming. \nINT. WAKEFIELD HOUSE - NIGHT \nRobert Wakefield steps inside his home.    It's very QUIET. He checks the mail on the hall table. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRobert walks down the hallway.  He steps into Caroline's bedroom. \nINT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRobert stands outside her closed bathroom door. \nThere is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the faint sound of a lighter CLICKING.  AGAIN and AGAIN, then a COUGH. \nINT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nCaroline sits on the toilet.  Glamour Magazine on her lap. \nShe's wild-eyed and paranoid.  The exhaust fan is running. \nThe aluminum foil is on the sink.  The last little bit of heroin in a wax-paper bundle sits beside it. \nShe's listening hard for any SOUND in the house.  What she's wondering is if someone is outside the door listening. \nShe puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once more before lighting it.  She does the hit. \nAnd seems to feel better. \nSuddenly there's a POUNDING on the door.  The VOICE of her father muffled through the solid wood. \nROBERT (V.O.) (muffled by the door) Caroline.  Open this door immediately. \nCaroline is up like a shot.  She looks around.  The POUNDING on the door gets stronger. \nShe crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet. \nThe bathroom door SOUNDS like it's about to cave inward. \nCAROLINE (faking the best she can) Who is it?  I'm going to the bathroom. \nShe's coping now, full parallel process mode: she dumps the last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it, checking her nose in the mirror as she reaches for a can of air freshener which she sprays into the air. \nCAROLINE One minute. \nShe takes the remaining crack, lighters, tubes, little smudgy druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet. \nShe pauses a beat, then opens the door, and tries to brush by her father while avoiding his eyes. \nCAROLINE Excuse me -- \nJAVIER Ten years ago Tijuana had no drug problem.  Now it is epidemic. (beat) Ten years ago America takes a hammer to Pablo Escobar, a hammer to the Miami drug trade, and you allowed everything to move to my country. You dumped the problem at our feet. Now, drug use is epidemic.  Now, the treatment centers are full and get no state money.  They survive on donations and what they get for building doghouses to sell to the U.S. (beat) We need lights for the parks so kids can play at night.  So they can play baseball.  So it's safe.  Everybody likes parks.  Everybody likes baseball. (beat) What I'm talking about is I would like to see somebody take an interest in Tijuana.  That's what I'm talking about. \nJavi starts to get out of the pool. \nHUGHES Javi, You want to come see us again, you're going on the box.  No more of this water-wing bullshit. \nINT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY \nJavier gets out of the DEA sedan and back into his.  He drives away. \nINT. SEDAN - DAY \nAgents Hughes turns to Agent Johnson. \nJOHNSON You wanna tell me what the hell that was all about? \nHUGHES He's got something.  We just have to be patient. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAIL VISITATION ROOM - DAY \nHelena and Carl each hold a telephone receiver as they stare at each other through a thick pane of meshed glass.  Helena is barely holding it together.  It's hard for Carl to see her like this.  After a beat -- \nCARL How's David? \nHELENA How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl. \nCARL Helena -- \nHELENA We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back. \nShe can't even look at him. \nCARL (beat) We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you -- \nHELENA (snapping) How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home? (beat) Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me. (losing it) Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection. \nCARL Helena -- \nHELENA Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude. (beat) I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back. \nCarl looks at his wife as if he is trying to weigh her.  He thinks, then leans forward -- \nCARLOS I built our house and I don't want to lose it.  Every stone, every brick, every board. (carefully) My business... That would take a lot of private study... (he blinks) That you don't have time for.  I suggest you look into the Coronel... (he blinks again) Into selling it.  If you can stomach it, you should look into it. \nThat painting is very valuable. \nHELENA I don't understand. \nCARLOS Look into the Coronel; otherwise, there is nothing to do. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SERENITY OAKS - DAY \nA peaceful wooded campus with a unobtrusive sign reading, \"Serenity Oaks Treatment Facility.\" \nINT. MEETING ROOM - SERENITY OAKS - DAY \nThere are sayings on the wall: \"Easy Does It;\" \"Let Go and Let God;\" \"Turn it over;\" \"One Day at a Time...\" \"H.A.L.T. -- Hungry?  Angry?  Lonely?  Tired?\" \nCaroline, wearing a thick, woolly sweater, and the other PATIENTS sit around on beat-up couches and chairs in a loose circle.  It's a mixed BUNCH: trucker meth-head, rocker dope- fiend, yuppie crack-head, fat, thin, rich, middle-class, and all white.  Caroline is the youngest. \nMARTY, 40's, an overweight alcoholic, finishes his \"share.\" \nMARTY So it was my birthday an my ex-wife was getting remarried and I was in some church basement telling a bunch of strangers how it was a good day because I didn't have to eat out of a dumpster.  That was enough to send me out on big one. (beat) I've been thinking a lot about the first step: that I came to believe I was powerless over alcohol and that my life had become unmanageable. (beat) See my disease tells me I don't have a disease.  That I'm fine.  That it's my birthday and I can have one little drink, then one little line, then one little Valium, then two more fat lines, then two more 10 mil Valium... Six months later I wake up in a sober living house in Philly. And I'm from Dallas, people. (beat) It's a disease -- an allergy of the body and an obsession of the mind. I know that now.  So my name's Marty and today I'm a grateful recovering alcoholic who didn't eat out of a dumpster.  Thanks. \nAnd Marty looks to Caroline who didn't relate to one word he said. \nCAROLINE (slowly, very nervous) Hi.  I'm Caroline.  I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic. (beat) I mean I don't really like to drink. For someone my age it's so much easier to get drugs than beer.  I don't know, this is really weird and I'm really nervous... \nPeople in the room nod encouragingly. \nCAROLINE I guess I'm angry.  I mean I think I'm really angry about a lot of stuff, but I don't know what exactly. \nShe blushes, and stares out the window. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AYALA LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nHelena follows an ART APPRAISER through her formal living room as he inspects paintings and makes notations.  He is very excited and moves quickly from one to the next. \nART APPRAISER Tamayo.  Carrington.  A simply wonderful collection of Mexican Modern.  Give me three months.  I know several collectors in South America, very discreet. \nHELENA I don't have three months. \nART APPRAISER It takes time to find the proper collection. \nHELENA How much will you give me in cash? Today. \nThe appraiser taps out some numbers on a calculator and shows the figure to Helena. \nHELENA You must be joking.  That's a fraction of their value. \nART APPRAISER I'm sorry, but that is the figure I can get today. \nHelena turns her back.  She walks to a window and looks out, then surveys the contents of her beautiful home. \nHELENA (snapping) Get out.  Get out of my house. \nHelena turns and sees David in the doorway.  She goes to him. \nHELENA It's all right.  We're have a disagreement, that's all. \nThe art appraiser passes them on his way out. \nINT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY \nA packed, tense courtroom listens to testimony from a government witness, FRANK, 50's, very matter-of-fact and truthful. \nFRANK He first came to me in January. That would've been nineteen eighty- seven.  He wanted to rent warehouse space along the harbor.  I didn't ask too many questions; I'm a businessman also. \nINT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY \nAnother witness, MRS. BERRY, 40's, pedantic on the stand -- \nMRS. BERRY I told Mr. Ayala there were irregularities in his tax return. And I couldn't represent him unless we could explain this... \nINT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY \nSHEILA, 38, a mousy secretary, is on the stand.  Carlos sits at the defendant's table listening raptly.  Gordon and Castro sit in the back watching Helena who pays close attention to the witness -- \nSHEILA I was the company secretary from 1991 to 1994.  I supposedly worked for all six companies.  But... they weren't... I mean, it was just one empty office with a desk and a telephone.  We never sold anything the whole time I was there.  Sometimes people came and got paid.  I don't really know what we did. \nPROSECUTOR Did Mr. Ayala say where the money came from? \nSHEILA No, and I didn't ask. \nPROSECUTOR Where do you think it came from? \nCarl's lawyer, Adler, is on his feet -- \nKAUFMAN This speculation -- \nPROSECUTOR I'll rephrase.  Did you feel like you were engaged in a legal enterprise? \nSheila is reluctant to answer. \nSHEILA No, not really. \nHelena catches Carl's eye and they share a grim moment. \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nINT. CARL'S UPSTAIRS STUDY - DAY \nHelena sits at Carl's office desk.  On the desk in front of her are the lists she found and an encrypted cell phone. \nHelena picks up the phone.  Her hands are shaking.  She is crying as she dials.  A voice on the other end answers. \nFRANCISCO (V.O.) Who is this? \nHelena gathers her courage, then... \nHELENA A friend... of Carlos Ayala. \nThere is a long pause. \nFRANCISCO (V.O.) Yes. \nHELENA I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely? \nFRANCISCO (V.O.) You may speak. \nHELENA I have a job for you and I don't have much time. \nEXT. BOTANICAL GARDEN - DAY \nHelena watches David look at the wide variety of plants and flowers.  All around them a GROUP of 3rd graders, in identical T-shirts, enjoy a field trip. \nFRANCISCO (V.O.) I love this place.  Don't turn around. \nBehind her Francisco Flores takes a photo with an instant camera. \nFRANCISCO You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb. \nHELENA You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something? \nFRANCISCO I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive. \nHELENA When will you do it? \nFRANCISCO I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way. \nHELENA There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him. \nFrancisco laughs. \nFRANCISCO Careful... You're sounding like your husband, Mrs. Ayala. \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nINT. JAVI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAnna sits in the living room, staring.  She appears too upset to speak.  The apartment is cleaner.  There have been other changes.  There's a new rug. \nJAVIER What?  What is it? \nANNA It's very hard for me to come and tell you this. \nJavier just watches her. \nROBERT I don't want anything. \nROBERT AND SETH \nSETH Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help. \nROBERT You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her. \nROBERT IN HIS CAR \nROBERT I'm looking for my daughter. \nThe dealer looks at him with disgust, turns his back, and waves everyone else away. \nRobert slams his fist against the steering wheel.  He slams it again and again.  He stops and pulls away, just as \nAT THE INTERSECTION \nbehind Robert's car, Caroline crosses the street toward Sketch's house. \nINT. SKETCH'S BEDROOM - DAY \nA single candle lights the room.  Caroline is underneath Sketch the drug dealer.  He is pounding away.  As she clutches his back and holds on, her expression is both surprised and druggy, and SOUNDS escape her mouth that she wouldn't believe she could make. \nThere's a KNOCK on the door.  Sketch continues his business. The KNOCKING is more insistent.  Finally, he stops and gets up and goes to the door.  Caroline lies back.  She's in a bed with black sheets in a room with nothing else in it but a dresser and some duffle bags. \nSketch opens the door -- \nSKETCH What the fuck do you want? \nSOMEBODY outside says something.  Sketch walks over to a duffle bag and extracts some product.  Caroline's eyes are glued to it as Sketch hands it through the door.  Sketch sees her staring at the drugs. \nHe comes back to bed. \nSKETCH You want some of that? \nCaroline nods. \nSKETCH What you gonna do to get some of that? \nCAROLINE Please -- \nSKETCH What you gonna do? \nShe turns her back to him, pouting.  He laughs. \nSKETCH Maybe a taste. \nHe reaches over beside the bed where there is a small tray. \nOn the tray is a rig, spoon, several powders, and an eye dropper.  He pulls the candle over and rapidly fixes a speedball.  He pulls the fluid into the neck of the syringe and holds it up the light.  It has Caroline transfixed. \nSKETCH Feed this to you like a little bird. \nHe squirts the tiniest amount of fluid into the air.  It arcs in the candlelight. \nCAROLINE Don't -- \nSKETCH You want this? \nShe nods. \nSKETCH This is the Express train.  Baby turnin' pro and getting down in a big, big hole. \nHer concentration is entirely, hypnotically focused on the syringe. \nSketch moves the syringe toward her lips. \nSKETCH Kiss it.  Kiss your new mommy hello. \nCaroline moves her mouth toward the side of the syringe, her lips part. \nSketch pulls the sheet back, exposing her legs.  He grips one powerful hand around her ankle and squeezes... Veins stand out on her foot. \nHe slides the needle into the largest vein and slowly depresses the plunger. \nCaroline watches, then her head tilts back, then forward, she GROANS, sexually and slumps against the pillows, her eyes half-open, her lips twitching. \nSketch puts the rig back on the tray, then admires Caroline's beauty for a second before starting to fuck her again. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOTEL - DAY \nGordon and Castro and two other AGENTS escort Ruiz out of the hotel and usher him into a waiting cruiser. \nThey pull out in a caravan and move through the streets toward the courthouse. \nEXT. COURTHOUSE PARKING LOT - DAY \nThe cruiser pulls into a fenced and gated parking lot. \nGordon, Castro and Ruiz, walking with a limp, cross to the building entrance. \nAs they push inside, Francisco Flores, in a conservative grey suit passes them going outside. \nThe parking lot is empty of people.  The guards at the gate talk about something distracting. \nFrancisco passes by the cruiser and drops his keys.  Kneeling down he extracts a small, powerful, magnetized bomb from his jacket.  He attaches it to the underside of the vehicle, stands and walks toward the guard gate. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nThe court is filled to capacity.  Helena and Metzger watch from the gallery. \nThe JUDGE bangs his gavel.  Adler is on his feet. \nADLER Your honor, it has come to our attention that your honor, while in private practice, previously represented the town of Seal Beach in their stop-work suit against the Police Department of Seal Beach.  We believe this disqualifies you from hearing this case and we therefore move for a temporary suspension while this is investigated. \nThe cruiser EXPLODES. \nGordon hits the pavement.  Parts of the car begin raining down around him. \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED \nINT. SIDEWALK CAFE - SAN DIEGO - DAY \nA fire truck and paramedic unit WHIZZES by.  Manolo sits at an outdoor cafe table, waiting.  He can't help looking around at the attractive people, but he's also nervous. \nSuddenly two MEN, recognizable as Salazar's OFFICERS from the desert drug bust, sitting at a nearby table, rise and move to Manolo's table. \nMAN #1 Manolo, how are you? \nThey take seats uncomfortably close to Manolo. \nMAN #2 Manolo, have we interrupted? \nYou're looking around like you're expecting someone. \nMANOLO No.  I'm looking for the waiter.  I want to order. \nMAN #1 What are you gonna have? \nMANOLO A steak. \nMAN #1 Well, if you like steak, we know a much better place.  We'll take you there. \nMANOLO That's okay, really. \nThey each take Manolo by an arm. \nMAN #2 Manolo, we should really be going now, before it gets too crowded. \nINT. SUV - DAY \nWe're looking through the windshield as we approach the Mexican border.  As the car slows, we pan to follow the border official as he looks in briefly and waves us through.  We continue to pan to reveal Manolo in the backseat sitting beside Man #2. \nINT. SUV - DAY \nWe're in the desert.  There's nothing in any directions. \nJavi is implacable.  Manolo understands what is happening. \nMANOLO I was going to feed them wrong information.  Feed them lies to... it was for... \nThe men say nothing.  After a beat -- \nMANOLO Don't tell Anna I died like this. Tell her it was something else. Tell her it was official business. Tell her that I died doing something honorable.  Please, tell her that for me... \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nJavi and Manolo stand next to two freshly dug graves. \nMAN #1 Turn around. \nJavi hesitates before turning.  We're on Javi as we hear the GUNSHOT.  Javi doesn't flinch.  Manolo's body falls into the grave. \nJavi stands there, waiting. \nMAN #1 You got anything you want to say? \nJavi shakes his head.  Finally, another GUNSHOT.  After a beat, a hand reaches out of Javi's shoulder. \nMAN #1 Sorry about that... we had to be sure. \nThey walk back to the SUV. \nSOMEBODY ELSE Are you sure you don't have anything to tell us? \nJavi says nothing, doesn't even acknowledge them.  We hear a GUNSHOT. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AYALA HOME - DAY \nArnie Metzger is in Helena's living room.  The stereo is loudly playing MOZART. \nARNIE That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid. \nHELENA I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try. \nARNIE Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl. (beat) They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case. \nHELENA That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us. \nHelena steps closer to Arnie, close enough that her breasts are almost touching his chest. \nARNIE Helena, please.  This is out of your hands. \nHELENA (softly) I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with. \nHelena looks searchingly into his eyes. \nARNIE Helena -- \nHELENA I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers. \nARNIE I can't do that. \nHelena leans closer to him. \nHELENA I figured out what Carl was up to and I need your help.  Will you help me? \nCUT TO: \nHELENA This doll is cocaine. \nJuan picks up Spastic Jack and looks at him.  He bangs it on the desk. \nHELENA Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone. \nMARQUEZ I don't believe you. \nShe takes out the \"solvent\" and puts it on his desk. \nHELENA Get a bowl. \nINT. CLUB PLATINUM - OFFICE - LATER \nSpastic Jack is slowly dissolving in a bowl of solvent. Only his shoulders, head, and ridiculous ears remain above the quicksand of milky glop. \nHelena holds a mirror under the desk lamp.  She is drying the paste.  She puts the mirror on the desk.  A white substance has coagulated there. \nHELENA Try it. \nJuan takes out a razor blade and chops the dried substance into two white powder lines.  He hands a silver straw to Helena. \nMARQUEZ You first. \nHELENA I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it. \nMARQUEZ Fine, then we don't have deal. \nHELENA Fine, then we don't have a deal. \nShe stands.  He watches her a beat, then smiles. \nMARQUEZ Okay, okay. \nHe leans down and quickly snorts a line.  After a beat. \nMARQUEZ That's good coke. \nHELENA It should be... It's yours. (beat) I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed. \nMARQUEZ Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors. \nHelena waits.  Juan Marquez reaches in his desk and pulls out a quarter kilo of cocaine.  He pushes it across the desk. \nMARQUEZ Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal. \nHELENA That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling. \nMARQUEZ Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government. \nShe puts the quarter key in her bag and stands. \nHELENA You will help me with my other problem. \nMARQUEZ Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal. \nTigrillo escorts her out of the room. \nINT. CLUB PLATINUM - DAY \nHelena follows Tigrillo.  As they pass the restrooms she signals that she has to stop. \nINT. CLUB PLATINUM - LADIES' ROOM - DAY \nHelena goes into a stall.  She extracts the cocaine from her handbag. \nShe looks at it, trying to figure out where it goes.

Hughes and Johnson watch as Javi talks into a tape recorder on the table. \nJAVIER ...And I have the electronic serial numbers for their cellular phones. They change them every twenty-four hours but I have a contact at MexTel who can get me the new ESNs within twelve. \nJavi finishes talking and sits back.  Agent Hughes shuts off the tape recorder and looks at the polygraph operator who nods approval.  Hughes and Johnson exchange a look.  They are dumbstruck. \nHUGHES That's good shit. \nJAVIER Now that you have what you want, let's talk about how I get what I want. \nJOHNSON Oh, don't worry, Javier, you're not gonna have any problems there. \nHUGHES I want to take a minute and talk about what type of precautions you're taking to protect yourself.  When Salazar and Madrigal go down, they might send someone to see you. \nJAVIER You worry about getting me the things that I want.  I'll worry about myself. \nThere's a beat.  Javier seems discomfited.  The two agents notice this and exchange looks. \nJOHNSON You should feel good about this. \nJAVIER I feel like a traitor. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nRobert sees a middle-aged JOHN in his underwear and a dress shirt. \nJOHN Hey, I haven't touched her -- \nCaroline is passed out on the bed.  Robert goes to her as the John scrambles for his clothes. \nShe stirs and sees him -- \nCAROLINE (really out of it) Hi, Daddy. \nINT. ROBERT'S CAR - DAY \nCaroline rides in the passenger seat.  She's come out of her stupor and is now filled with ebullience. \nCAROLINE It's gonna be great...  I mean, I'm okay and all, because, see, I met a guy, he's in this pretty famous band and... (gets up confessional courage) They've invited me to write lyrics for them, I'm gonna be able to do that and maybe sing, too... not at first, but later. \nCaroline gets lost in her grandiose vision.  Robert looks over at her as she drifts off into a nod.  A moment later she's awake and rambling again. \nCAROLINE (sounding completely crazy) I've been doing research for the school paper, that's what I've been doing, like on assignment kind-of, I've seen some stuff you wouldn't believe, but I'm gonna write it all down into lyrics.  They think I'm really good, everybody says so, what do you think? \nRobert fights back tears.

Barbara is on the phone. \nBARBARA (into phone) I'm really not sure.  She seemed to recognize it wasn't Serenity Oaks. It's a pretty hard-core facility, but at least we know where she is.

You smell. \nThere is a KNOCK on the front door.  An AGENT goes to answer -- \nAGENT Who is it? \nSOMEBODY (V.O.) (through the door) The Mafia.  I've got his breakfast. \nThe agent opens the door and is handed a breakfast tray.  He puts the food in front of Ruiz who uncovers the sausage and eggs. \nAn agent walking by tries to take a bite of sausage.

Helena is talking with a GROUP of rich people who include her friends, Nan, Stewie and Alex, from the country-club, and their HUSBANDS. \nSTEWIE This is fabulous, Helena.  What a turnout. \nHELENA Thank you so much, but I had a lot of help. \nHelena circles away.  As Helena leaves, the women speak their minds -- \nNAN It's a turnout because it's a spectacle.  Can you imagine? \nALEX I've met her husband, as nice as they come. \nSTEWIE It teaches me a valuable lesson... (re: the nice house) Apparently crime pays. \nNAN Silly, you knew that already. \nON THE STAGE \nThe band stops playing and steps aside as a man in a tuxedo takes the microphone.

They sit opposite each other and neither speaks for a while. \nHELENA (quietly) I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman. \nARNIE Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk... \nHelena is relieved, but she's not looking at Arnie and when she does she sees him shaking his head in a very definitive, \"No.\" \nArnie stands and continues talking as he walks to the windows and shuts the blinds one by one. \nARNIE ...Carl is a very important member of this community and when we're through suing the police and the district attorney and the DEA, they'll have to rename the public parks for your husband. \nThe blinds are closed.  Arnie crosses to Helena and talks very softly in her ear.  She's a beautiful woman and Arnie manages to make this act seem both practical and inappropriate. \nARNIE (whispering) Your husband is very good at his job... \nHelena leans back and looks at Arnie.  He whispers more -- \nARNIE Which is smuggling illegal drugs into this country. \nEXT. AYALA HOME - NIGHT \nWorkers break down the party under the watchful eye of the party planner.

How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this? \nARNIE You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.

He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do? (beat) I mean, what would you have done if you had been us? \nBARBARA How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana. \nCAROLINE He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do. (beat) It wasn't my pot. \nShe searches her parents' faces.  It has been a convincing performance and she expects victory. \nROBERT Okay, honey.  We understand.

If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.

Anna has clearly not been out of the house since the last time we saw her. \nINT. MANOLO'S HOUSE - DAY \nJavier sits opposite Anna. \nJAVIER I know this is a tragedy, but you have to realize that good has come out of it. \nShe looks at him. \nJAVIER If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico. \nANNA I want to believe you.  I really do. \nJAVIER You will believe me, because it's true. \nEXT.

Let me talk to her. \nMUFFLED VOICE I don't know what you're talking about.  Go away! \nRobert reaches the door.

The crates of cocaine are clearly marked \"911.\" \nROBERT The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso? \nJAVIER I'm aware of that. \nROBERT So what's it doing in Tijuana? \nJavi looks Robert Wakefield squarely in the eye.  He shrugs. \nROBERT Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence? \nJAVIER It could mean that, yes. \nROBERT That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power? \nJAVIER It's possible. \nROBERT Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels? \nJavi thinks along time before answering. \nJAVIER Yeah, it's possible... if you're prepared to die. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

What? \nCARLOS So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested? \nARNIE (V.O.) I was just waiting for the right time. \nCARLOS And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news? \nARNIE (V.O.) I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else. \nCARLOS You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie. \nARNIE (V.O.) Carl, that's insane. \nCARLOS So my wife is lying? \nARNIE (V.O.) Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal. \nOn the front lawn CHILDREN are lined up for the ice-cream sundae bar that is being tended by a WAITER. \nCARLOS Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is. \nARNIE (V.O.)

Everyone is waiting. \nCarl and Helena turn to leave the room and Montel Gordon is standing in the doorway with his glass of champagne. \nGORDON Hello, Helena.  What a great party. \nCARLOS Who are you? \nGORDON Nobody.  I'm a nobody who arrested you, but your wife is a murderer. \nGordon takes a sip of his drink.  Two SECURITY OFFICERS appear in the doorway behind him. \nSECURITY OFFICER Hey, you can't be in here. \nGORDON I'm a cop. \nSECURITY OFFICER I don't care. \nHELENA (to the guards) Throw him out of here. \nThe security officers grab Gordon.  There is a scuffle. Gordon falls to the floor by the window.  They are wrestling. \nAs they wrestle, Gordon reaches out and, unnoticed, affixes TINY LISTENING DEVICE underneath the desk. \nHe continues to struggle with the guards.

The Press Secretary signals and Robert walks to the podium.  He looks back to the Chief of Staff; he stares out at the expectant faces and television lights and camera flashes. \nROBERT (reading his prepared speech) The War on Drugs is a war on our nation's most precious resource... our children.  Sixty-eight million children have been targeted by those who perpetrate this war and protecting those children must be priority number one. (beat) There has been progress and there have been failures, but where we have fallen short I see not a problem but an opportunity. \nRobert is becoming increasingly uneasy.  He glances at the Chief of Staff who bores into him.  He looks again at his speech.  With great effort he continues. \nROBERT An opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past while laying a solid foundation for the future. (a long, uncomfortable beat) This takes not only new ideas, but perseverance.  This takes not only resources, but courage.  This takes not only government, but families. \nRobert stops again as though the words are choking him. \nROBERT I've... I've outlined a ten-point plan, representing a new bilateral effort... \nHe can't finish.  Everyone stares at Robert.  The crowd of reporters senses something is wrong. \nROBERT I can't do this. (beat) If there is a War on Drugs then our own families have become the enemy. How can you wage war on your own family? \nHe walks out of the room.

And I believe everything is going to work out fine. (beat) On the bad days, I just want to grab the phone and start dialing numbers. I want to pull my hair and run through the streets screaming. (beat) But, thanks to the people I've met in these rooms, people like Margaret and Jim and Sarah, people who've taught me how to listen, I'm pretty sure I'll make it through today. \nCaroline is finished sharing. \nVOICE (O.S.) Would you like to share? \nWe pan over to reveal Robert and Barbara sitting next to Caroline. \nROBERT My name is Robert.  This is my wife, Barbara.  We're Caroline's parents.

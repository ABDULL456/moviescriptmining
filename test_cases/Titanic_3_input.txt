Swimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as they see the keel coming down on them like God's bootheel. The massive stern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea and pushing out a mighty wave of displaced water. 
Jack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail. They feel the ship seemingly RIGHT ITSELF. Some of those praying think it is salvation. 
SEVERAL PEOPLE 
We're saved! 
Jack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly. 
Now the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the awesome weight of the flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OF ASCENT as the fantail angles up again. Everyone is clinging to benches, railings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts. 
The stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty. 
People start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down the deck, screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. They wrench other people loose and pull them down as well. There is a pile-up of bodies at the forward rail. The DAHL FAMILY falls one by one. 
JACK 
We have to move! 
He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrified to move. He grabs her hand. 
JACK 
Come on! I've got you! 
Jack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over the rail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just as the railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips her fiercely. 
The stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolith standing against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note, its buoyancy stable. 
Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea at the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over, hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fall one by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some of them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators. 
Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull, gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet are the gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern. 
Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them. Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull, holding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment. 
JOUGHIN 
(nodding a greeting) 
Helluva night. 
The final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods. Looking down a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with Jack and Rose. 
JACK 
(talking fast) 
Take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The ship will suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go of my hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me. 
She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder. 
ROSE 
I trust you. 
Below them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... the boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last thirty feet. 
278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The name TITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under the water. 
Where the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean. 
CUT TO: 
279 EXT. OCEAN / UNDERWATER AND SURFACE 
Bodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others struggling spasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them. 
280 Jack rises INTO FRAME F.G. kicking hard for the surface... holding tightly to Rose, pulling her up. 
281 AT THE SURFACE: a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. Over a thousand people are now floating where the ship went down. Some are stunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, praying, moaning, shouting... screaming. 
Jack and Rose surface among them. They barely have time to gasp for air before people are clawing at them. People driven insane by the water, 4 degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form death by fire. 
A man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselessly trying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything. Jack PUNCHES him repeatedly, pulling her free. 
JACK 
Swim, Rose! SWIM! 
She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her lifejacket. They break out of the clot of people. He has to find some kind of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water. 
JACK 
Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it. 
All about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... a chorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... nothing but black water stretching to the horizon. The sense of isolation and hopelessness is overwhelming. 
CUT TO: 
282 OMITTED 
283 EXT. OCEAN 
Jack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from freezing. 
JACK 
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything. 
ROSE 
It's so cold. 
JACK 
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around. 
His words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them. Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. She turns and... SCREAMS. 
A DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH BULLDOG, swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyes bugging. It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland. 
Beyond it Rose sees somehting in the water. 
ROSE 
What's that? 
Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is a piece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and she slithers onto it belly down. 
But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges, almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. He clings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as best he can. 
Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. A MAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. Jack warns him back. 
JACK 
It's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under. 
MAN 
Let me try at least, or I'll die soon. 
JACK 
You'll die quicker if you come any closer. 
MAN 
Yes, I see. Good luck to you then. 
(swimming off) 
God bless. 
CUT TO: 
284 EXT. COLLAPSIBLE A / OCEAN 
The boat is overloaded and half-flooded. Men cling to the sides in the water. Others, swimming, are drawn to it as their only hope. Cal, standing in the boat, slaps his oar in the water as a warning. 
CAL 
Stay back! Keep off! 
Fabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat. Cal CLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp. 
FABRIZIO 
You don't... understand... I have... to get... to America. 
CAL 
(pointing with the oar) 
It's that way! 
CLOSE ON FABRIZIO as he floats, panting each breath agony. You see the spirit leave him. 
FABRIZIO'S POV: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demon in a tuxedo. The image fades to black. 
CUT TO: 
285 EXT. OCEAN 
JACK AND ROSE still float amid a chorus of hte damned. Jack sees the ship's officer nearby, CHIEF OFFICER WILDE. He is blowing his whistle furiously, knowing the sound will carry over the water for miles. 
JACK 
The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. They had to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back. 
She nods, his words helping her. She is shivering uncontrollably, her lips blue and her teeth chattering. 
ROSE 
Thank God for you Jack.

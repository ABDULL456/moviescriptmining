BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--DAY \nAn ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red Bank. \nBRODIE (O.S.) No fucking way! \nWE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to-- \nINT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--LATER \nBRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a Dixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he puts new books in the racks. \nBRODIE Dante and Randal slapped you with a restraining order?! \nJAY Judge said if we go within a hundred feet of the stores, we get thrown into County. \nBRODIE So you gonna abide by the court's ruling or you gonna go Bandit-- Reynolds style? \nJAY Fuck yeah! You know what they make you do in county? Toss the fucking salad! I don't like this fuck's asshole; I'm gonna do it for some stranger? \nBRODIE I guess if you really wanted to hang out in from of a convenience store, you could just buy your own now-- what with all that money you guys made. \nJAY Hell yeah, bitch. (beat) Wait a second--what money? \nBRODIE The money from the movie, dumb-ass. \nJAY What the fuck are you babbling about? \nBRODIE (pulling a bagged-and- boarded issue down from the wall) The Bluntman and Chronic movie. (dawns on him) Oh my God--don't tell me you have no idea there's a movie being made of the comic you two were the basis for. \nJAY What?! Since when? \nBRODIE Goddamit, man-- (taps his wrist) Here's the pulse, alright. And here's your finger-- (shoves his hand down the back of his pants) --far from the pulse, jammed straight up your ass. (extracts hand and extends it to Jay) Say--would you like a chocolate covered pretzel? \nBrodie leads them back to the counter. \nBRODIE You see, kids, if you read Wizard, you'd know it's the top story this month.  Check it out. \nBrodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to the headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get Big Screen Treatment!  There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and Chronic. \nJAY When the fuck did this happen?! \nBRODIE Well, after X-Men hit at the box office, all the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their hands on. Miramax optioned Bluntman and Chronic. \nJAY Miramax? I thought they only made classy flicks like The Piano and The Crying Game? \nBRODIE Yeah, well once they made She's All That, everything went to hell. So you're saying you haven't gotten a cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book? \nJAY We haven't seen a fucking dime for no movie! \nBRODIE Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think Holden and Banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash. I mean they're making a movie based on characters that are based on you and Quiet Robert. \nJAY It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a pair of stupid-ass superheroes that run around saying \"Snitchy-Nitchies\" or something. \nBRODIE I believe it \"Snootchie Boochies.\" Regardless--you're getting screwed. If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden McNeil and ask him for my movie check. \nJAY Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid. \nBRODIE And on that note, we cue the music. \nJay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with his own beat. \nEXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY \nJay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building and knock. \nINT. POTZER'S INC--DAY \n", "test1_true": "HOLDEN Well! I have been waiting years to do this. (smiles) Look at these morose motherfuckers right here. Smells like someone shit in their cereal. Bunngg! \nJay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following them. \nJAY What the fuck took you so long answering your damn door? You trying to talk another girlfriend of yours into some of that gay-ass three-way action with your buddy? \nHOLDEN No, I was just showering your mother's stink off me after I gave her a quick jump and sent her home. But now that you mention it-- (to Bob) Thanks, you know. You could've made the moral of that story you told me a bit more clear. \nSilent Bob shrugs. \nHOLDEN So what brings you two dirt merchants to my neck of the woods? \nJAY Oh, I'll tell you what our necks are doing in your woods-- \nSilent Bob holds up the Wizard article. \nJAY Where's our motherfucking movie check? \nHOLDEN You heard about that too, Hunh? Well, I've got nothing to do with it. That's Banky's deal. He owns the property now. I signed my half of the Bluntman and Chronic right over to him years ago. \nJAY Why the fuck would you do a thing like that? \nHOLDEN Because I'm almost thirty, for God's sake--why on earth would I want to keep writing about characters whose central preoccupations are weed and dick and fart jokes? You gotta grow, man. Don't you ever want more for yourself? (off Silent Bob) I know this poor, hapless sonovabitch does. I look in his doe eyes and I see a man crying out, \"When, Lord? When the fuck can your servant ditch this foul-mouthed little chucklehead to whom I am a constant victim of his folly, and who bombards me and those around us with grade-A foolishness that prevents me from even getting to kiss a girl? Fuck! When?! \nSilent Bob nod like he's finally understood. Jay looks at him, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth. \nJAY I'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're the dumb-ass who gave away his comic, and now you ain't got no fat movie check neither. \nHOLDEN When you're right, you're right. I wish I'd broken off a little piece for myself. Because if the buzz is any indication, the movie's gonna make some huge bank. \nJAY What buzz? \nHOLDEN The Internet buzz. \nJAY What the fuck is the Internet? \nINT. OFFICE OF POTZER'S INC--LATER \nHolden's at a computer terminal. Jay and Silent bob look over his shoulder. \nHOLDEN The Internet is a communication device that allows people the world over to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another. (off monitor) Here's what we're looking for: \"Movie PoopShoot.com\" \nJAY (to Bob) \"PoopChute.\" Yeaaahhh. \nHOLDEN This is a site full of militant movie buffs: sad bastards who live in their parents' basements, downloading scripts and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies and actors they despise yet can't stop discussing. This is where you go if you wanna hear frustrated would-be filmmakers mouth off with their two- bit, arm-chair-director's opinions on how they all could've made a better Episode One. \nOn the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up. Holden begins navigating the site. \nHOLDEN Here. This is about the Bluntman movie. (reading) \"Inside sources tell me Miramax is starting production this Friday on their adaptation of underground comic fave Bluntman and Chronic.\" \nJAY Friday?! Shit. Does it say who's playing us in the movie? \nHOLDEN No, but if it's Miramax, I'm sure it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. They put'em in a bunch of movies. \nJAY Who? \nHOLDEN You know--the guys from Good Will Hunting. \nJAY You mean the fucking movie with Mork from Ork in it? \nHOLDEN Yeah, I'm not too big a fan either. Though Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms. \nJAY Word, bitch. Phantoms like a motherfucker. \nHolden and Jay slap hands. Holden points at the monitor again. \nHOLDEN Now down here is where you can gauge the buzz. This is the Shoot Back area. It's where people who read the news get to chime in with their two cents. Here's what a guy who goes by the chick-magnet Net handle of \"Wampa- One\" thinks about Bluntman and Chronic. (reading) \"Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only work in small doses, if at all. They don't deserve their own movie.\" (to Jay) He's got a point. \nJAY Fuck him. What's the next one say? \nHOLDEN (reading) \"Bluntman and Chronic is the worst comic I ever read. Jay and Silent Bob are stupid characters. A couple of stoners who spout dumb-ass catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech and Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses.\" \nJAY Who the fuck said that shit?! \nHOLDEN A guy who calls himself \"Magnolia- Fan.\"  Check out what the guy after him said: \"Jay and Silent Bob are terrible, one-note jokes that only stoners laugh at.  They're fucking clown shoes. If they were real, I'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid. I can't believe Miramax would have anything to so with this shit. I, for one, will be boycotting this movie. Who's with me?\" (leans back) And then there are about fifty more posts from people who agree to join Spartacus-here's boycott of the flick. \nJAY (grimly) I'm gonna kill all these fucks-- \nHOLDEN Ah, let it go. Number one, they're a bunch of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the Net to insult people who're doing what they wish they were doing, and number two, they're not really talking about you guys--they talking about Bluntman and Chronic. \n", "test1_id": 2937, "test2_input": "JAY Well, what the fuck am I supposed to call you, then? \nJUSTICE Something sweet, you big goof. Something nice. \nJAY (thinks; then) Boo-boo kitty fuck. \nJUSTICE (laughing) Okay.  That's a start. \nSissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming it at Jay and Bob. \nSISSY Jay, before you go, could you say something into the camera about the clitoris. \nJAY What? \nJUSTICE (to Sissy) Man you are such a bitch-- \nSISSY (off Justice; to Jay) She's just a little embarrassed. See, Jussy and I are putting together this documentary for our Human Sexuality class, and we need a male perspective on the clitoris. \nJAY The female clitoris? \nSISSY Uh--yeah. \nJUSTICE Jay, you don't have to do this. \nShe elbows Sissy. \nJAY Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few things I can say about the clit that I's like you to hear. (clears throat; into camera) I am the master of the clit! I make that shit work! It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do!  No one rules the clit like me! (off Silent Bob) Not this little fuck! None of you little fucks out there! I am the clit commander!!! Remember that-- commander of all clits! \nJay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces. Justice shakes her head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles. \nSISSY Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger. \nSissy climbs back into the van. \nJAY (to Justice) So--can I get a little kiss for good luck? \nJustice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips. \nJAY So--can I get a little blow job for good luck? \nJustice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off, revealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in midair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out. Justice watches them go. \nSISSY Jussy. C'mon. \nJustice climbs back into the van. \nINT. VAN--SAME \nJustice sits, glaring at Sissy. \nSISSY Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my authority again, you lose your fucking fronts, you got that? \nJUSTICE Yes, sir. \nSissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to Missy, beside whom is a bag full of high-tech equipment. \nSISSY Phase One, down. While we're executing Phase Two, you edit that tape and grab a new car. \nMISSY No sweat. \nSISSY Let's suit up. \nEXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT \nJay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn, stopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN out of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly gives the \"metal\" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame. \nINT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT \nIt's dead quiet and still. Then, the pair smash through a window, landing in the floor in a ball. They lift their Ninja hoods. Jay glares at Silent Bob. \nJAY You fat fuck-- \nINT.

VAN--NIGHT \nThe quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black. They head for a SEPARATE BUILDING.  Stopping at the front door. \nSissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures elaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers Sissy a look. \nJUSTICE You are so gay. \nChrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four different digits. The door lock CLICKS open. \nSISSY Once we're inside, I want complete silence. (holding up high-tech device) Missy whipped this up. It counts our decibel level. If it goes into the red--alarm, we're dead. So not even the slightest noise, got it? \nJustice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed closely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay and Bob. \nSISSY (pokes her head back out) Justice! Move your ass! \nJustice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads: BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE. \nINT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT \nJay and Bob stand there, looking around the room. \nIt's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking ANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his eyes and hits him. \nJAY Stay frosty, you big fucking softie. We've got a job to do. \nSilent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade through the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on the wall. Inside it, there's a pistol. \nJAY Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up like Percocets! \nJay elbows the glass, breaking it. He takes the gun out and tosses it to Bob. \nJAY Hold this. Later, me and Justice can shoot each other with it and fuck like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg. \nSilent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat.

At the other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS. \nSissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly, within the mist, laser beams become apparent. \nSissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs forward and does an impressive series of flips down the hallway, not touching a single laser beam. \nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly. \nOnce Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm. \nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly. \nJustice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to Chrissy. \nChrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly. \nThen, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are even more impressive than the other two, including running up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud, manly FART. \nThe decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING through the building. \nCHRISSY Holy fuck--the little stoner was right-- \nSissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds. She ours them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed by Justice and Chrissy. \nEXT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT \nThe Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy pulls up in a CONVERTIBLE. \nCHRISSY Boom Box! \nMissy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the convertible. \nSISSY I can't believe it. Months of planning and it's all blown by a fucking fart. \nJUSTICE We can't just leave them like this! That alarm's gonna bring the cops here any minute! \nSISSY That was always the plan, Justice!

What more could two guys from Jersey possibly want? \nJAY All those fucks to stop talking shit about us on the Internet, for starters. \nBANKY What do I keep telling you? There's not much you can do to stop that. Well, short of showing up at all their houses and beating the shit out of them, I guess. \nJay and Bob suddenly freeze.

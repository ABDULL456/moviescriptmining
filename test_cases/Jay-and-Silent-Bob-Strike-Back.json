{"train": "JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK \nScreenplay by \nKevin Smith \nOVER BLACK WE SEE: \nCHYRON \nA long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far away-- \nEXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY \nWe FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK -- a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in the Mother's hands. \nMOTHER Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks up the free cheese, 'kay? \nShe looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her baseball cap and places it on the baby. \nMOTHER This'll keep the sun out of your eyes. You be good now. \nShe walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks kind of familiar. \nThen, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip. She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets her Baby down beside him. \nMOTHER Don't fucking move, you little shit- machine. Mommy's gonna try to score. \nA PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted. \nPASSERBY Excuse me--who's watching these babies? \nMOTHER The fat one's watching the little one. \nPASSERBY Oh, nice parenting. (walking away) Leave'em out here like that and see what happens. \nThe Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird. \nMOTHER FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE! \nPASSERBY (waving her off) Ah, keep on truckin'. \nMOTHER (to baby) D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me how to fuckin' raise you? Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking think he is? What's the worse fuckin' thing could happen to you sitting outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck! \nThe door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat. Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing. The smaller one says-- \nBABY Fuck, fuck, fuck... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE PRESENT \nJAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record Rack is now RST VIDEO. \nJay is mid-chant. \nJAY (as a chant) --fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother- fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck, noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed, smoking weed, doing coke, drinking beers!  Drinking beers, beers, beers, rolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who smokes the blunts? We smoke the blunts! \nA pair of TEENS approach them. \nTEEN 1 Lemme get a nickel bag. \nJAY Fifteen bucks, little man. Put the money in my hand. If the money does not show, then you owe-me-owe-me- owe. (changing up to Morris Day) My Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh! I think I want to know ya', know ya'-- \nTEEN 1 (digging in pockets) What the hell are you singing? \nJAY You don't know \"Jungle Love\"? That shit is the mad notes. Written by God Herself and handed down to the world's greatest band--the motherfucking Time. \nTEEN 2 The guys in that Prince movie? \nTEEN 1 Purple Rain. \nTEEN 2 Man, that shit was so gay--fucking eighties style. \nJay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against the wall. \nJAY Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind word about The Time! Me and Silent Bob modeled our whole fucking lives after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and Tubby here's my black manservant! \nJust then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door behind him. \nJAY But they said Jay and Silent Bob! They used our real names. It doesn't matter that there's a comic book version of us and a real version, 'cause nobody knows we're real in real life. \nHOLDEN Really. \nJAY Yeah! And all these people who read that shit think the real Jay and Silent Bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book Jay and Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch, and she'll be like \"Oooo! I want to suck youse guys dicks off. What's your names?\"  And I'll be like, \"Jay and Silent Bob.\" And she'll be like, \"Oh--I read on the Internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs.\"  And then she goes and sucks two other guys's dicks off instead! Well fuck that!  We gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa- bitches before they ruin our good names! \nHOLDEN First off, I don't know how good your names really are. Secondly, there's not much you can do about stopping this bile. The Internet's given everyone in America a voice, and everyone in American has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies. As long as there's a Bluntman and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are gonna have something negative to say about it.  Jay steams, thinking. Then, a light dawns on him. \nJAY But wait a second--if there wasn't a Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no one would be saying shit about Jay and Silent Bob, right? \nHOLDEN They're not saying anything about you now--they're talking about fictional characters! \nJAY (oblivious to Holden; to Bob) So all we gotta do is stop 'em from making the movie! \nHOLDEN Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties you're due in the process. Are you fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since Greedo shooting first. I mean, a Jay and Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to see that? \nHolden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for a beat. Then-- \nHOLDEN But since it is happening, you might as well just ignore the idiots on the Internet, go find Banky, and get your \"motherfucking movie check.\" As you so succinctly put it. That's what's important here. \nJAY No, Holden McNeil--what's important here is that there's a bunch of motherfuckers we don't even know calling us assholes on the Internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who can't even get laid. Putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do. (off monitor) When did it say they're making that movie? \nHOLDEN They start this Friday. \nJAY So if today's Tuesday, that gives us-- (counts) Eight days. \nHOLDEN It's more like three days. \nJAY Right. Three days to stop that stupid fucking movie from getting made! C'mon, Silent Bob-- \nJay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose. \nJAY We're going to Hollywood. \nThey stride off. Holden shakes his head. \nHOLDEN Now that's what I call the Blunt leading the Blunt. \nEXT. BUS STATION--DAY \nJay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled \"Los Angeles.\" They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After a beat, they re-emerge. \nJAY Tickets? Since when did they start charging for the bus? \nThey head toward the depot. \nJAY Didn't we used to ride that shit to school every day for free? \nEXT. HIGHWAY--DAY \nThe bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey. \nINT. BUS--SAME \nJay makes his way up to the DRIVER. \nJAY We in Hollywood yet? \nDRIVER It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles, sir. We left twenty minutes ago. \nJAY I didn't ask you about Los Angeles. I asked you about Hollywood. \nDRIVER Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir. \nJAY Don't change the subject! Are we in Hollywood yet or not? \nDRIVER Please sit down, sir. \nJay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat. \nJAY Why don't you take your seat Ralph Kramden-- \nJay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob. \nJAY I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't shit to so on this bus. \nSilent Bob mimes jerking off. \nJAY I already did that. Twice. \nJAY Yeah, but we ain't gay. \nGUY Well, neither am I. But have you seen the price of bus tickets lately? Shit--I don't wanna cough up two hundred bucks just to get to Chicago. \nJAY Well, I don't wanna cough up some dude's sperm! \nGUY Don't be so suburban--this is the new millennium. Gay, straight--it's all the same now. There're no more lines. \nJay draws a line on the ground with his foot. \nJAY There's one. On this side of it, we ain't gay. \nGUY All hitchers do this. Why do you think people pick us up? If you get a ride, it's expected--I don't care who the driver is. It's the first rule in the Book. \nJAY What book? \nGUY The unwritten Book of the Road. \nA TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy points to it, as if to say \"See?\" The passenger-side door opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He looks out the window at Jay and Bob. \nGUY Follow the rules of the Book, and you'll get where you're going in no time.  Excuse me. \nThrough the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road. \nJay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window and leans toward them. \nNUN You two boys need a ride? \nINT. CAR--LATER \nThe NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun. \nNUN You both don't have to sit back there. One of you can sit up here with me. \nSilent Bob shakes his head \"no\" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs up front. \nNUN So where are you boys from? \nJAY New Jersey. \nNUN What brings you to Indiana? \nJAY We're going to Hollywood. \nNUN Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways away. \nJAY Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up. \nNUN Well, do unto others. That's what the Book says. \nJAY (misinterpreting completely) Wait a minute--you follow the Book, too? \nNUN I live my life by it. \nJAY Really? You? \nNUN Of course. You know how lonely it gets on the road? Thanks to the Book, I'm never alone--if you know what I mean. \nJAY I guess. This guy back there explained it to us. But I didn't think you'd be into that. \nNUN Are you kidding? I've dedicated my life to it. Every hour of every day. \nJAY Shit--you nuns are alright. \nNUN You live by the Book, too? \nJAY You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta. \nNUN That's good to hear. But it takes deed, not words. It's a lot easier to say you live by the Book than to actually do it. (looks at him) Can you do it? \nJAY You want me to do it right now? \nNUN No time like the present, right? \nJay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head \"no.\" Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and starts to bend down. \nJAY Alright. (he suddenly stops) You hear that? She's not a Catholic. She's a Presbyterian. \nJay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed. \nEXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY \nAn ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob enter. \nINT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME \nAs the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public INTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm. \nJAY Yo--check that shit out: the Internet. Let's see if those fucks said something new about us and that stupid flick. \nBob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar and types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look at the screen and go wide-eyed. \nJAY \"Any movie based on Jay and Silent Bob is gonna lick balls, because they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely each other's.\" \nJay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed. \nJAY Eww. (reading further) \"Yes--they are real people. Real stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal.\" (to Bob) Motherfucker! It's time we wrote something back! Type this shit down. \nSilent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates. \nJAY All you motherfuckers are gonna pay. You are the ones who are the ball- lickers.  We're gonna fuck your mothers whole you watch and cry like little bitches. Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who are making the movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our shit, then shit our shit, then eat their shit which is made of our shit that we made 'em eat. Then all you motherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay and Silent Bob. \nSilent Bob finishes typing and presses \"Return\". He and Jay nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking up at the menu board. \nJAY That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get back on the road, get to Hollywood, and stop that fucking movie from getting made. No more hairy-bush nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye on the prize, and not let nothing-- and I mean NOTHING--distract me. \nAs Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and freezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in the World. She's bathed in light, glowing. \nShe bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us. \nJay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's eyes, getting zero response. \nJAY'S POV \nThe Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to her breasts, then down to her crotch. \nJay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him. \nBut it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She smiles at the zombified Jay. \nGIRL (off cup) Oh my God. Do you get free refills with that? \nJAY Oh, what--this? I just wear this for protection. You know--so no guys try to grab my shit. \nGIRL Hi. I'm Justice. \nJAY (dreamily) And I am so fucking yours-- \nSilent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze. \nJAY I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my hereto life-mate, Silent Bob. \nJUSTICE It's nice to meet you. \nJAY Justice, hunh? That's a nice name. (under his breath, to Bob) Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F- U-C-K-I-N-G-- (back to Justice) So you come here often? \nJUSTICE Oh, I'm not from around here. My friends and I are taking a road trip, and we just stopped to grab something to eat. \nJAY Your friends, hunh? Where they at? \nJUSTICE (pointing) Out there. By that van. \nJay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other gorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair around, looking incredibly sexy. \nWithout looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him-- \nJAY Dude--I think I just filled the cup. \nINT. VAN--DAY \nJay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the other Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food to her friends. \nJAY Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!! \nSISSY Who the fuck are these guys? \nJUSTICE This is Jay and Silent Bob. (to Jay and Bob) Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy. \nCHRISSY Where the fuck did they come from? \nSISSY Why the fuck did you let that little stoner throw Brent our of the van?! \nJUSTICE Oh please--if I had to listen to one more of those stupid songs, I was going to throw him out myself. \nSISSY We needed Brent, Justice! He was our patsy! \nJUSTICE We'll find someone else. Besides, I didn't see you trying to stop Jay from throwing him out. \nSISSY Because I didn't want to blow our cover! \nJUSTICE Cover, shmover--you all hated his songs, too. \nCHRISSY Not as much as I hate you. \nJustice offers Chrissy a cold glance, \nCHRISSY Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone! \nSISSY (rubbing Chrissy's shoulders) Don't mind Chrissy. She's just a little too wound for sound. \nCHRISSY Then how about you help me take the edge off? \nChrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot and heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other customers regard them wide-eyed. \nJUSTICE (to Customers) They're really good friends. \nSISSY (TO CHRISSY AND MISSY) Would you two knock it off? We're in the fucking heartland here! Try to blend! \nJUSTICE They already do--she's the milkmaid, and she's the cow. \nCHRISSY Oh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow, bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your head off and fuck your spine stump. \nSISSY Enough! (calm to Justice) We have a very simple gang here, Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl. But lately, I'm having a hard time figuring out what you're doing here. \nJUSTICE That makes two of us. \nCHRISSY Shit--your name doesn't even fit the rhyme scheme. \nJUSTICE That's because very few names rhyme with \"douchebag.\" \nCHRISSY (getting in her face) You're dancing on my last nerve, Strawberry Shortcake. (to Sissy) You deal with the weak link. I'm gonna take Missy into the dirty convenience store bathroom and hate- fuck the shit out of her. \nChrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go. \nJUSTICE And you said letting them read all that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to anything. \nSISSY Don't change the subject. You know what you have to do now, right? Since you let our patsy slip away, you've gotta convince the little kid and that fat guy to take his place. They've gotta break into Provasik now. \nJUSTICE Uh-uh! \nSISSY Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out of this gang. Just use the little one's crush to convince him, since he's so fucking in love with you. \nJUSTICE Jay? No he's not. \nSISSY What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing your hand back in the van like he was fucking Lord Byron? \nJUSTICE Well, maybe he was just raised with manners. \nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY \nA GIRL walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store. \nJAY (to exited Girl) YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?! (to Bob) Yeah. \nINT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY \nSissy continues to confront Justice. \nSISSY You're the one that brought the kid in, Jussy. So you've gotta make amends. \nJUSTICE Jay is not taking Brent's place as the patsy. \nSISSY That kid and his quite friend are our only options at this point. Now we got about two hours before we get to Boulder. That gives you plenty of of time to work on him. \nJUSTICE I'm not gonna do it. \nSISSY Why the fuck not? \nJUSTICE Because he's just to so innocent! \nCHRISSY Kaboom, you little stoner fucks. \nThe girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into the car with them. \nCHRISSY It's set. Let's roll. \nThe convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there. The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting down from two minutes. \nINT. PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT \nJay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something seems to move inside it. The head for the exit, but Silent bob hesitates, offering a sad look to the animals in all the cages. Jay hits him. \nJAY What the fuck are you looking at? There ain't no snacks here, man! Now we got what we came for, so let's get the fuck out! \nSilent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes his head frustrated. \nJAY Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck are we supposed to do about it? \nSilent bob offers Jay a look. \nEXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT \nThe front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob (carrying their bag), and HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS--cats, dogs, birds, rabbits. All race off into the night. \nJay and Bob race toward the van. Jay screams at it. \nJUSTICE JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS! \nSuddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks. \nJAY Oh shit-- \nThree COP CARS screech up, the van between them and Jay and Bob. The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay looks to Bob, pissed \nCOP DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS EXPLOSIVE! \nThe counter on the device attached to the van hits \"0,\" and the van BLOWS UP.  Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one direction, the Cops in the other.  On all fours, Jay looks at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye. \nJAY Justice-- \nWe crane up from him as he bellows-- \nJAY JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!! \nSilent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still carrying the bag. \nEXT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY \nWe start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a DEPUTY opening the door and heading inside. \nINT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY \nThe Deputy enters just as a FAX is coming through at an operations board. He rips it off, reading it. His eyes go wide. \nDEPUTY Oh, fudge... (calling off) Marshal Willenholly! \nINT. BATHROOM--SAME \nMARSHAL WILLENHOLLY sits on the bowl, staring at Four Legged Law-Man magazine, eyeing it lustily. Below frame, he jerks off. \nWILLENHOLLY Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby-- It takes two hands to hold doesn't it--?  Uhhh-- \nAs he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him. \nWILLENHOLLY WHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING! \nDEPUTY (O.S.) Sir, we got a report of a break-in at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing lab. \nWillenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine. There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants. \nWILLENHOLLY Have you read this article on the mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I wish that was in our jurisdiction-- I'd shut down every last one of those ass-cock chuggers, personally. \nThe Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then at Willenholly. \nWILLENHOLLY What? \"Ass\" means \"donkey.\" \nDEPUTY Yes, sir. (hands him a fax) \nWILLENHOLLY (looks at fax) Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the jet. \nJay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at-- \nSUZANNE (the ORANGUTAN)--who sits on a log across from them, staring back. \nJAY This is Jussy's monkey (to Suzanne, angrily) JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY FUCK! \nSuzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. Jay and Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and pulling back as if he's going to strike. \nJAY (to Silent Bob) Do something. Tons of Fun! \nSilent Bob offers the ape a weak wave. Suzanne drops her hands from her face and waves back. Jay cranes his neck to see over silent Bob. \nJAY Is that fucking thing waving at us? \nSuzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at the ape. \nJAY Holy shit? That monkey understood us! Maybe it's some sort of super- monkey! \nSuzanne offer them a \"raspberry.\" Spitting as if the comment was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at this. \nJAY What the fuck was that for? It's not a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo? \nSuzanne holds her nose, as if to say, \"Congo stunk.\" Silent Bob smiles in agreement and amusement. Jay looks at him, stung. \nJAY You're my bitch. You get my back. Don't go joining this chimp's side. \nJay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. Silent Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers. \nJAY Yo--what if there's more super monkeys up in the lab? Maybe they're making an army of 'em up there! Holy shit! Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the X-Files Roswell--style! \nJAY'S DELUSION: We enter into JAY'S HEAD and see-- \nINT. LAB--DAY \nWe PAN over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching blueprints for an insidious war machine. An orangutan shakes hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files. \nJAY (V.O.) Working in secret with a crew of double-dealing, nicotine-fiending fucks that're selling out the human race, these supermonkeys will use simian science and their genius IQ's to make man and monkey alike believe that they're the superior species! \nEXT. BALCONY--DAY \nA monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of apes, who wave fists in the air. \nJAY (V.O.) Then all it'll take is one little monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the dumber chimps into a frenzy, until they go all ape-shit and start demanding more bananas, better pay, and human flesh! \nEXT. FIELD--DAY \nRandal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield, and is shot in the neck. He collapses, revealing a GORILLA on horseback holding a rifle. Two other Gorillas throw a net over him. \nJAY (V.O.) You'll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit, and the occasional inter- species blow-job. And if you don't wind up with a monkey hog in your mouth, you'll be captured, killed or worse... \nINT. LAB--DAY \nCornelius and Zera-looking chimps dissect the brain of a living, screaming, Dante. \nJAY (V.O.) Eaten alive! \nEXT. QUICK STOP--DAY \nThe Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like atmosphere. Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of bananas. The sign now reads: Ape Stop \nJAY (V.O.) Then these monkey fucks'll start wearing our clothes and rebuilding the world in their image. \nEXT. BEACH--DAY \nWe start on a FULL SHOT of Jay on the beach, looking up, then SNAP ZOOM OUT to REVEAL Jay kneeling before the beach buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised. \nJAY (V.O.) And only those who outwit those damn dirty apes'll ever remember that it was MAN who once ruled the earth! \nJAY (at statue) YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!! \nWE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO: \nEXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY \nAnother close-up of Jay's painted face. Behind him, Suzanne and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake. Jay eyes Suzanne angrily. \nJAY Not on my watch, motherfucker! \nJay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously. \nCHRISSY The only thing I regret is not gutting that little trout-mouthed prick like a fish and playing Twister with his vitals. \nMISSY You are so nasty. \nCHRISSY I'll show you nasty, you little slut. \nSISSY Would you two get a room? \nCHRISSY Fine--we'll take yours. (getting up in Sissy's face) I am gonna stain your sheets, bi- otch. \nChrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls her eyes. \nSISSY Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure. \nJUSTICE They're your gang. \nSISSY Oh and not yours? You know, I don't get you, Justice. You used to be all about the girl stuff: stealing, boning, blowing shit up. Now you're like this little priss with a conscience. It's really a fucking drag. \nJUSTICE We all gotta grow up some time. \nSISSY If moping around over some little boy you're crushing on is being grown- up, then pass me my Wonder Woman underoos. \nJUSTICE Don't you feel the least bit of guilt for what we did to those guys? \nSISSY Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty about setting up her boyfriend? Then how about taking a shower? \nSissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace. They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas. \nPIZZA DELIVERY GUY You the gals that ordered the pizzas? \nSISSY This dopey bitch ordered the large plain, but I could go for some hot, thick, Sicilian. \nPIZZA DELIVERY GUY No charge, lady.  He rushes into the motel, Justice sighs, looking up at the stars. \nJUSTICE (quietly) I'm sorry, Jay. \nINT. DINER--DAY \nJay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne digs into a banana split. \nJAY You know, Justice died trying to save this monkey, so maybe we should keep her around. That way, we can honor her memory. \nSilent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their food. \nJAY Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing all sentimental, and you're all about a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't you glad we stopped to eat?  And you were all piss-scared the cops'd bust us or something. You know what I say? (singing, a la NWA) \nVOICE (O.S.) (via bullhorn) THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER THE ORANGUTAN! \nJay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat. Then-- \nJAY You think they're talking to us? \nEXT. DINER--DAY \nThere's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other COPS. \nSHERIFF YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY. (to other COPS) Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty. \nSuddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind the car, gun drawn. \nSHERIFF The ape. \nWILLENHOLLY What? \nSHERIFF An orangutan's a member of the great ape family.

Suzanne is looking out the back window waving.  Jay and Bob leap to their feet, chasing after the truck. \nJAY HEY! GET THE FUCK OFF HER, MAN! THAT'S MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S MONKEY?! \nThe truck speeds away in the distance. Jay and Silent Bob stand there, panting. \nJAY Man!

CUT TO STEVE KMETKO in studio. \nSTEVE KMETKO Is Hollywood ready for Jay and Silent Bob?  A source at the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office tells us a posting was pulled off an Internet movie chat board that was allegedly written by the two domestic terrorists themselves. It's sending a shockwave through Hollywood. Jules Asner's on the scene at Miramax Studios, Jules? \nJules Asner is in front of the Miramax Studios main gate. \nJULES ASNER Steve, the tenor of Tinseltown is one of terror today, after the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office learned that hot, new terrorists Jay and Silent Bob are targeting Miramax Studios for their next campaign of blood, violence and monkey-theft. In the posting, pulled off Movie Poop Shoot.com, the gruesome twosome threatened, quote-- (reading) \"Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax Expletive-Deleted who are making the Bluntman and Chronic movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our Expletive-Deleted, then Expletive- Deleted, which is made up of our Expletive-Deleted, then eat their Expletive-Deleted, which is made up of our Expletive-Deleted that we made 'em eat. Unquote. So far, we haven't been able to get a statement from anyone here are the studio. \nBACK TO STEVE in the E! Studio. \nSTEVE Jules, word has it that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are on the lot, shooting a super-secret project. Have you seen then roaming around? \nBACK TO JULES at Miramax Studios. \nJULES No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck buying a soda at a concession stand earlier. \nSTEVE But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob? \nJULES None whatsoever. However, to be fair, all the feds have to work with is murky videotape, so no one's even a hundred percent sure what Jay and Silent Bob look like, exactly. For all we know, they could already be on the lot. \nAs Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her, looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera and start waving behind Jules. \nINT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM--DAY \nJustice goes wide-eyed, seeing Jay and Bob on E! She hops out of her seat. \nJUSTICE Oh my God! Jay! No! \nJustice looks around, panicky. Her eyes fall on-- \nThe diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table. \nJustice looks at the diamonds, then the TV screen. She thinks for a beat, then-- \nJUSTICE Fuck it. \nShe pours the diamonds into the satchel, and shoves it in her pocket. \nINT. SEEDY MOTEL BEDROOM--DAY \nThe door slowly opens in the dark bedroom, and Justice crawls to the bedside table, reaching for a set of keys. In the bed, Missy and Chrissy make out under the sheets, moaning. Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity. Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place. As she crawls back out, we PUSH IN on the note, which reads: SORRY, GUYS--BUT I LOVE HIM. \nEXT. SEEDY MOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY \nThe convertible skids out, taking off. \nINT. SEEDY MOTEL HALLWAY--DAY \nThere's a loud scream, then Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy rush down the stairs (in varied states of undress and sheet-wrap). Wiping their mouths. Sissy holds Justices's note. \nSISSY That bitch!  That fucking, fucking bitch!!! (to girls) Get dressed. We're going after her. \nCHRISSY Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet. \nSISSY Which is more important to you: a fortune in diamonds or busting a nut? \nSissy and Missy race back up the stairs. Chrissy stands there still, shrugs, then digs her hand into her panties. \nSISSY (O.S.) Chrissy! Now! \nCHRISSY Fuck-- \nChrissy races back up the stairs. \nEXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS-DAY \nThe E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob. \nJAY We gotta play this right. \nBob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle and giving chase. \nAGENT SID I'll bet, Will. What's it this time... Beaver trouble? Some kind of unauthorized marsupial trafficking? \nThe agents crack up, stifling their laughter. \nWILLENHOLLY (taking it in stride) No, no--nothing like that. Say--there aren't other people listening in, are there? \nAGENT SID No way, man. It's just me and you talking here. \nWILLENHOLLY Good. I'm tracking a monkey down that's on it's way to Los Angeles, and I could use some bureau backup. \nAGENT SID Los Angeles, hunh? Maybe we should stake out Clint Eastwood's place. Didn't he used to drive around with a monkey that'd punch people and drink beer? \nThe Agents crack up. Willenholly's catching on. \nWILLENHOLLY Am, uh--Am I on speaker phone? \nAGENT SID No way--Dunston! \nWILLENHOLLY Alright, now that's not fair. I know I didn't make it as high up as you guys, but my job's just as important. \nAGENT SID Calm down, Will. Don't go all... bananas on us! \nThe Agents crack up even more, Willenholly's pissed. \nWILLENHOLLY I come to you as a friend--as a fellow professional--and this is the shit I get?! \nAGENT SID You're right, Will. Tell you what-- we'll get our best man on your case right away. You might've heard of him. He's a doctor. \nWILLENHOLLY (excited) Oh, a doctor? \nAGENT SID His name's Doctor Zaius! \nThe Agents laugh hysterically, pounding the desk, Willenholly tears up, enraged. \nWILLENHOLLY SCREW YOU GUYS! \nWillenholly throws his cell phone across the car, the mocking laughter still emitting from it. Willenholly cries. \nEXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS LOT--DAY \nThe Red Light FLASHES outside the soundstage. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME \nJay and silent Bob stand amidst a line of EXTRAS. Silent Bob looks O.C. goes wide-eyed, and pokes Jay, pointing O.C. Jay looks and sees-- \nA COLLEGE BAR set that looks like the College Bar from Good Will Hunting, complete with CLARK (the stuffy college jerk). MATT DAMON stands off to the side, loosening up for the scene. BEN AFFLECK calls to the O.C. DIRECTOR. \nBEN Where are we taking it from, Gus? \nGus Van Sant sits off to the side, counting a stack of money. He just shrugs. \nGUS I'm busy. \nBEN You're a true artist, Gus \nMATT Just take it from \"It's a good course.\" \nBEN Oh, now you're the director. \nMATT Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let's remember who talked who into doing this shit in the first place. Talking me into Dogma was one thing, but this-- \nBEN I'm sorry this is taking you away from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses- who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely- flick you're supposed to be doing this week. \nMATT Oh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you never saw Forces of Nature? \nBEN You're like a child. What've I been telling you? Sometimes you've gotta do the safe picture. Sometimes, you do it for art. Sometimes, it's the payback picture your friend says you owe him-- \nThey take a beat and look at the camera. Then-- \nBEN And sometimes, you go back to the well. \nMATT And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games. \nBEN Now that's just mean. \nJay turns excitedly to Bob. \nJAY This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick, 'cause that's those two fucks from that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do is figure out a way to get close to them-- \nJay and Silent Bob rush in to see-- \nWes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar- looking GHOSTFACE KILLER and SHANNEN DOHERTY. The Clapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4 \nCLAPPER/LOADER Scream four, scene thirty-seven, take one. (claps it and rushes off) \nWES CRAVEN Action! \nThe Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff, until she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out. \nSHANNEN DOHERTY Alright, you bastard! Let's see who you really are! \nShannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal SUZANNE. \nJay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed. \nSHANNEN DOHERTY Fucking Miramax-- (getting up) CUT! \nShannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask. \nWES CRAVEN Shannen, usually I say \"cut.\" \nSHANNEN DOHERTY A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't even trying anymore, are you? \nWES CRAVEN The market research suggest that people love monkeys. \nJay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne. \nJAY WE LOVE THIS MONKEY! \nThey rush out. West shrugs to Shannen. \nWES CRAVEN See? \nSecurity Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair. \nEXT. LOT--DAY \nJay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne. On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting. The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until-- \nAt the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking their path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the other Security Guards gaining. \nJAY What the fuck are we gonna do? \nJust then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front. \nJay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse. Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart. \nJAY PUNCH IT!!! \nBob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the vehicle, taking flight, \nBelow, the Security Guards stare in awe as-- \nJay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a soundstage) a la E.T. \nJay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then they look ahead and let out a scream. \nThe bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage Building. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY \nThe Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling onto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see. \nJAMES VAN DER BEEK AND JASON BIGGS dressed as Jay and Silent Bob, looking down as them. \nJAMES Holy shit--that looked like it hurt. \nJASON Are you guys alright? (off Suzanne) Hey! They've got a monkey! \nJay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other. \nJAY Yo, I think that shit just kicked in. \nJAMES Let's get you guys on your feet. \nJames and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet. All stare at one another, perplexed, \nThen-- \nJAY (to door; deepening voice) Uh--yeah. They're in here. \nSECURITY GUARD Do they have you hostage? Should we call your publicists? \nJAY NO! I mean, we kicked those guys' asses bad. They're--knocked out. \nEXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME \nThe Security Guards stand outside a door marked James. \nSECURITY GUARD Great work, sirs! If you let us in, we'll take over-- \nJAY (O.S.) (through door) NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in here! Together! \nThe Security guard look at one another. \nSECURITY GUARD Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the door, sirs. \nThe Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job face to the rest. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY \nBob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it and hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods, and starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the vent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet. \nJAY What the fuck are we gonna do?! How are we gonna get out of here without them seeing us? \nSilent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet, smiling. \nEXT. LOT--DAY \nThe Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a waiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and Silent Bob. \nJAMES YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS! \nJASON HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M THE PIE-FUCKER. \nSECURITY GUARD (to Cops) He'll be the pie--in prison. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY \nJay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits). \nJAY This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In these outfits we're totally incognito. \nSuddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders. \nA.D. Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? Great--you've changed costumes already. Let's get you to set. (pulling them off) The director doesn't like to be kept waiting. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET \nIt looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side, near the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs the hustling, white crew. \nDIRECTOR Look at all these crackers, Seventy million dollars and I can't even get a black grip? \nA white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director. \nP.A. Here's your coffee, sir. \nDIRECTOR (eyes the coffee) You spit in this?  Because I know all you white folks are pissed off that the studio'd entrust a multi- million dollar to a brother. \nP.A. I didn't spit in it, sir. \nDIRECTOR Then taste it! Go on! \nThe P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it back to the Director. \nP.A. It's all good, sir. \nDIRECTOR No it ain't all good. Oh, you think I want it now, after your lips touched the cup? Get the fuck off my set! \nP.A. You the man, sir. \nDIRECTOR No you the Man! And that's the problem! \nThe Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously skulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches. \nBANKY Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and Chronic. We met a few weeks back. I'm the executive producer. \nDIRECTOR/CHAKA Oh--you're the executive producer, hunh? Well go \"produce\" me a latte no white folks spit in--okay Fucky? \nA.D. Or House Party Three? \nCHAKA Shut the fuck up! \nCock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock- Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver a saber kill-shot, when we hear-- \nJAY (O.S.) YO-BITCH-FISTS! \nCock-Knocker turns to see-- \nJay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a double-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One). \nJAY Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg. \nJay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong Saber. \nCHAKA (from behind the monitor) I think George Lucas is going to sue somebody-- \nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY \nWillenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside the flashing red light. \nWILLENHOLLY (looking around) So, this is Hollywood? (suddenly full of purpose) Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent Bob. \nWillenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY \nThe door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two shots, O.C. \nWILLENHOLLY FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!! \nWillenholly goes wide-eyed. \nIt's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses. \nWILLENHOLLY Oh my God-- (to kids) Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm on the wrong, uh--wrong set. \nThe Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the O.C. Willenholly. \nKID You killed Mooby-- (to Kids) LET'S GET HIM!!! \nThe Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as he's attacked. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME \nJay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle. \nCOCK-KNOCKER (breaking character) You are not upstaging me, Van Der Beek! \nJay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker, hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other hand. \nCOCK-KNOCKER (to O.C. Chaka) CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A \"CUT\"! \nOn cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire). \nSilent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber, Jay grins at Cock-Knocker. \nJAY Now whose balls have been busted, bitch? \nSuddenly, a gun shot rings out. \nAll turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun first on Jay, then Bob. \nWILLENHOLLY The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and Silent Bob! (revealing badge: calling out) Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal Wildlife Marshal. These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey. \nVOICE (O.S.) They didn't really steal that monkey. \nAll turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows. Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops. \nJUSTICE It was just a diversion so we could steal these. \nJustice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing them. \nJUSTICE And they're not the leaders of C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real. \nWILLENHOLLY No--the clit's real. The female orgasm is a myth. \nJUSTICE (to Jay) Are you guys alright? \nBoth Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head. \nBANKY Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I just wanted to say hi. I'm-- \nJAY Banky fucking Edwards! Just the motherfucker we came to see! \nBANKY (shocked) Holy shit! What the fuck are you guys doing here?! \nSissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the floor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue. \nBANKY Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?! \nJAY All these assholes are calling us names on the Internet, 'cause of this stupid movie! \nBANKY I feel for you boys--I really do. Those Net snipers can be really cruel. But Miramax paid me a shitload of money for Bluntman and Chronic, so it occurs to me that people bad- mouthing you on some web-site is none of my FUCKING CONCERN! \nSILENT BOB Oh--but I think it is. \nBanky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes. \nJAY Here we go again-- \nSILENT BOB Shut the fuck up. (to Banky) We had a deal with you on the comics for likeness rights. And as we're not only the artistic basis but also the character basis for your intellectual property, Bluntman and Chronic, when we said property was optioned by Miramax Films you were legally obliged to secure our permission to transfer the concept to another medium. As you failed to do that, you're in breach of the original contract--ergo, you find yourself in a very actionable position. \nBanky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a beat, Jay adds-- \nJAY Yeah. \nJustice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming. \nBANKY So, what do you guys want, to go away and take your lady friends with you? \nJAY Shitcan this movie so we don't get called names on the Internet anymore. \nBANKY Even if there's no movie, people are still free to talk shit about you on the Internet. That's what the Internet's for: slandering others anonymously.  Stopping the flick isn't going to stop that! \nIn the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the air. \nJAY Well this isn't fair!  We went to Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole a monkey, we got shot at, and got punched in the motherfucking nuts! We ain't leaving empty-handed! \nOn cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap. \nJAY What's up baby? You look good! \nBANKY Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy? \nJAY Oh yeah. (pushing Sissy off him) Get the fuck offa me, pig! \nSissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair. \nJay, Bob, and Banky continue. \nBANKY You guys are gonna ruin my movie career. \nJAY Well, we want something for our mental anguish. \nBANKY Tell you what: we'll settle this monetarily. I'll give you half of what I made. \nJAY Half?!? \nBANKY Half's not good enough?  Fine--I'll give you two-thirds of what I made! \nJAY Fuck-you--you already said half? You can't take it back! \nSilent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand. \nBANKY Done \nJustice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing each other. \nSISSY Your shit is so tired, Justice! \nJUSTICE Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH! \nJustice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage. \nSissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop Missy and Chrissy, knocking them out. \nWillenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting. \nWillenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the car. \nJUSTICE (to Jay) Wait for me. \nJAY What--here? \nJay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away, leaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking down the lot. \nBANKY Well, boys--you're rich in love-- (indicating Jay) Well, you're in love. And to top that off, you've got your own monkey. What more could two guys from Jersey possibly want? \nJAY All those fucks to stop talking shit about us on the Internet, for starters. \nBANKY What do I keep telling you? There's not much you can do to stop that. Well, short of showing up at all their houses and beating the shit out of them, I guess. \nJay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and smile. \nJAY (to Bob) You know--with all that money we're gonna make we can buy a lotta plane tickets. \nSTART THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE \nEXT. SKY--DAY \nA passenger JET flies through the sky. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY \nJay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod at each other, and cross the street. \nINT. HOUSE--DAY \nThe doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent Bob standing in the doorway. \nMOTHER Can I help you? \nJAY Yes. Ma'am, Does-- (reading of paper) William Dusky live here? \nMOTHER Yes. He's my son. \nJAY May we talk to him, please. \nMOTHER One moment. \nShe walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes to the door. \nKID Yeah? \nJAY Yo--do you post as-- (reading off paper) Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com? \nKID Yeah. \nJAY And did you write \"Fuck Jay and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses? \nKID Yeah, a while ago. So? \nJay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front lawn. \nEXT. SKY--DAY \nThe passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite direction. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY \nJay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers.

APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY--DAY \nJay and Bob beat the shit out of a WOMAN. \n", "test1_input": "Jay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back over his shoulder. \nJAY Just spread my cheeks a little and you can see the fucking stink nuggets-- \nCOP Pull up your pants up sir, Now! \nJay bends down to pull up his pants and FARTS. Silent Bob cracks up. The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the car. \nCOP Let's take a ride down to the station. \nJAY What? It's suddenly a crime to fart, motherfucker?! \nEXT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--DAY \nAn ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red Bank. \nBRODIE (O.S.) No fucking way! \nWE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to-- \nINT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--LATER \nBRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a Dixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he puts new books in the racks. \nBRODIE Dante and Randal slapped you with a restraining order?! \nJAY Judge said if we go within a hundred feet of the stores, we get thrown into County. \nBRODIE So you gonna abide by the court's ruling or you gonna go Bandit-- Reynolds style? \nJAY Fuck yeah! You know what they make you do in county? Toss the fucking salad! I don't like this fuck's asshole; I'm gonna do it for some stranger? \nBRODIE I guess if you really wanted to hang out in from of a convenience store, you could just buy your own now-- what with all that money you guys made. \nJAY Hell yeah, bitch. (beat) Wait a second--what money? \nBRODIE The money from the movie, dumb-ass. \nJAY What the fuck are you babbling about? \nBRODIE (pulling a bagged-and- boarded issue down from the wall) The Bluntman and Chronic movie. (dawns on him) Oh my God--don't tell me you have no idea there's a movie being made of the comic you two were the basis for. \nJAY What?! Since when? \nBRODIE Goddamit, man-- (taps his wrist) Here's the pulse, alright. And here's your finger-- (shoves his hand down the back of his pants) --far from the pulse, jammed straight up your ass. (extracts hand and extends it to Jay) Say--would you like a chocolate covered pretzel? \nBrodie leads them back to the counter. \nBRODIE You see, kids, if you read Wizard, you'd know it's the top story this month.  Check it out. \nBrodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to the headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get Big Screen Treatment!  There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and Chronic. \nJAY When the fuck did this happen?! \nBRODIE Well, after X-Men hit at the box office, all the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their hands on. Miramax optioned Bluntman and Chronic. \nJAY Miramax? I thought they only made classy flicks like The Piano and The Crying Game? \nBRODIE Yeah, well once they made She's All That, everything went to hell. So you're saying you haven't gotten a cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book? \nJAY We haven't seen a fucking dime for no movie! \nBRODIE Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think Holden and Banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash. I mean they're making a movie based on characters that are based on you and Quiet Robert. \nJAY It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a pair of stupid-ass superheroes that run around saying \"Snitchy-Nitchies\" or something. \nBRODIE I believe it \"Snootchie Boochies.\" Regardless--you're getting screwed. If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden McNeil and ask him for my movie check. \nJAY Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid. \nBRODIE And on that note, we cue the music. \nJay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with his own beat. \nEXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY \nJay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building and knock. \nINT. POTZER'S INC--DAY \n", "test1_true": "HOLDEN Well! I have been waiting years to do this. (smiles) Look at these morose motherfuckers right here. Smells like someone shit in their cereal. Bunngg! \nJay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following them. \nJAY What the fuck took you so long answering your damn door? You trying to talk another girlfriend of yours into some of that gay-ass three-way action with your buddy? \nHOLDEN No, I was just showering your mother's stink off me after I gave her a quick jump and sent her home. But now that you mention it-- (to Bob) Thanks, you know. You could've made the moral of that story you told me a bit more clear. \nSilent Bob shrugs. \nHOLDEN So what brings you two dirt merchants to my neck of the woods? \nJAY Oh, I'll tell you what our necks are doing in your woods-- \nSilent Bob holds up the Wizard article. \nJAY Where's our motherfucking movie check? \nHOLDEN You heard about that too, Hunh? Well, I've got nothing to do with it. That's Banky's deal. He owns the property now. I signed my half of the Bluntman and Chronic right over to him years ago. \nJAY Why the fuck would you do a thing like that? \nHOLDEN Because I'm almost thirty, for God's sake--why on earth would I want to keep writing about characters whose central preoccupations are weed and dick and fart jokes? You gotta grow, man. Don't you ever want more for yourself? (off Silent Bob) I know this poor, hapless sonovabitch does. I look in his doe eyes and I see a man crying out, \"When, Lord? When the fuck can your servant ditch this foul-mouthed little chucklehead to whom I am a constant victim of his folly, and who bombards me and those around us with grade-A foolishness that prevents me from even getting to kiss a girl? Fuck! When?! \nSilent Bob nod like he's finally understood. Jay looks at him, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth. \nJAY I'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're the dumb-ass who gave away his comic, and now you ain't got no fat movie check neither. \nHOLDEN When you're right, you're right. I wish I'd broken off a little piece for myself. Because if the buzz is any indication, the movie's gonna make some huge bank. \nJAY What buzz? \nHOLDEN The Internet buzz. \nJAY What the fuck is the Internet? \nINT. OFFICE OF POTZER'S INC--LATER \nHolden's at a computer terminal. Jay and Silent bob look over his shoulder. \nHOLDEN The Internet is a communication device that allows people the world over to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another. (off monitor) Here's what we're looking for: \"Movie PoopShoot.com\" \nJAY (to Bob) \"PoopChute.\" Yeaaahhh. \nHOLDEN This is a site full of militant movie buffs: sad bastards who live in their parents' basements, downloading scripts and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies and actors they despise yet can't stop discussing. This is where you go if you wanna hear frustrated would-be filmmakers mouth off with their two- bit, arm-chair-director's opinions on how they all could've made a better Episode One. \nOn the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up. Holden begins navigating the site. \nHOLDEN Here. This is about the Bluntman movie. (reading) \"Inside sources tell me Miramax is starting production this Friday on their adaptation of underground comic fave Bluntman and Chronic.\" \nJAY Friday?! Shit. Does it say who's playing us in the movie? \nHOLDEN No, but if it's Miramax, I'm sure it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. They put'em in a bunch of movies. \nJAY Who? \nHOLDEN You know--the guys from Good Will Hunting. \nJAY You mean the fucking movie with Mork from Ork in it? \nHOLDEN Yeah, I'm not too big a fan either. Though Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms. \nJAY Word, bitch. Phantoms like a motherfucker. \nHolden and Jay slap hands. Holden points at the monitor again. \nHOLDEN Now down here is where you can gauge the buzz. This is the Shoot Back area. It's where people who read the news get to chime in with their two cents. Here's what a guy who goes by the chick-magnet Net handle of \"Wampa- One\" thinks about Bluntman and Chronic. (reading) \"Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only work in small doses, if at all. They don't deserve their own movie.\" (to Jay) He's got a point. \nJAY Fuck him. What's the next one say? \nHOLDEN (reading) \"Bluntman and Chronic is the worst comic I ever read. Jay and Silent Bob are stupid characters. A couple of stoners who spout dumb-ass catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech and Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses.\" \nJAY Who the fuck said that shit?! \nHOLDEN A guy who calls himself \"Magnolia- Fan.\"  Check out what the guy after him said: \"Jay and Silent Bob are terrible, one-note jokes that only stoners laugh at.  They're fucking clown shoes. If they were real, I'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid. I can't believe Miramax would have anything to so with this shit. I, for one, will be boycotting this movie. Who's with me?\" (leans back) And then there are about fifty more posts from people who agree to join Spartacus-here's boycott of the flick. \nJAY (grimly) I'm gonna kill all these fucks-- \nHOLDEN Ah, let it go. Number one, they're a bunch of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the Net to insult people who're doing what they wish they were doing, and number two, they're not really talking about you guys--they talking about Bluntman and Chronic. \n", "test1_id": 2937, "test2_input": "Jay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts them. \nJUSTICE Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical lab where they perform gross experiments on animals. \nJAY So, what kind of animals are we talking about here--like bears and rhinos? \nBRENT No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats... heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak for them, who will? (touches Justice's arm) Right, Jussy? \nJay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After a beat, he relaxes. \nJAY Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you over here for a second? \nBrent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him confidentially. \nJAY Be honest, yo--you're down with this for the fine-ass pussy, right? \nBRENT I'm down with this because I love animals, stupid. \nJAY Even sheep? \nBRENT Of course. Sheep are beautiful creatures. \nJAY They are beautiful, aren't they? \nBRENT Oh God, yes. \nJAY So then you'd fuck a sheep? \nBRENT What is your damage little boy? You've got a sick and twisted world perspective. \nJAY No, you misunderstand me, Prince Valiant. I mean if you were another sheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if you were another sheep? \nBRENT I--suppose so. \nJAY That's what I thought. (suddenly loudly, to all) YO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF US!

VAN--SAME \nMissy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels between them. \nCHRISSY What the fuck are we gonna do now? \nSISSY Shut up, I'm thinking. \nIn the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her, and she quickly folds them up. \nJAY Is Hollywood near where we're going? \nJUSTICE Is that where you guys are from? \nJAY Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent! \nJUSTICE Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you all the way out here? \nJAY Well, we couldn't hang in front of the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of the strainen-en order, which sucks ass 'cause it's been like our home since we were kids. Silent Bob even busted his cherry there. \nJUSTICE (to Bob) You did? I'll bet she was a lucky girl. \nBob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has strayed. \nJAY Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying to tell a story here. \nJUSTICE Sorry. \nJAY Anyway, we were talking to Brodie and he said there's gonna be a Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we went to see Holden McNeil, and he showed us the Internet, and that's where we found all these fucking little jerkoffs were saying shit about us. So we decided to go to Hollywood and stop the movie from getting made.  And now we're here. \nJUSTICE Wow. I have no idea what you just said. \nJAY Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like animals, huh? \n", "test2_true": "JAY That's cool. Even snakes? \nJUSTICE You can't exclude an animal just because it's not cuddly. Of course I like snakes. \nJAY How about trouser snakes? \nJUSTICE What's a trouser snake? \nJust then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder. \nJAY DEVIL (to Jay) What the fuck are you waiting for? She went for the setup! Reach in your fucking pants, and pull yer cock out, bitch! That's the kinda shit girls like! \nSuddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right shoulder. \nJAY DEVIL 2 Right about here's where the angel's supposed to show up and tell you not to pull your dick out. But we bitch- slapped that little fuck and sent him packing, so it's smooth sailing. Let 'er rip, boy! \nThey disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick, when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder, rubbing a swollen jaw. \nJAY ANGEL Sorry I'm late. So what's the deal here? (looks down) Oh, shit--you're not thinking of whipping your dick out at this fine piece of woman, are you? \nJay thinks, then nods \"Yes.\" The Jay Angel rolls his eyes, and slaps him. \nJAY ANGEL Tell you what: look at Silent Bob. See if he thinks it's a good idea to whip your dick out. \nJay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in his pants to Jay and shakes his head \"no,\" sternly. Jay withdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods, satisfied. \nJAY ANGEL That's it, boy--put the dick down. You gotta go from the heart, yo. No little perv bullshit will do for this one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the shit out of two suckerpunching little bitches. Remember--don't pull your dick out until she asks you to. (beat) Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg! The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice looks at Jay, a bit confused. \nJAY Don't ask. (beat) So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like me do to help the animals? \nJUSTICE You really don't want to help us-- \nJAY What the fuck are you talking about? Sure I do. I'd do anything for you. \nJustice smiles. Jay tries to recover. \nJAY I mean, youse guys! I'd do anything for youse guys. For the lift and shit. \nJUSTICE You sure? \nJAY Sure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I. Fuck \nJUSTICE Well--okay. Let me talk it over with the other girls and get back to you. \nJAY You do that. \nJay takes Justice's hand and kisses it. \nJAY I'll be right here. \nHe winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the can, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and winking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly, then imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls. \nJAY Fuck you. Fatty. \nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY \nThe van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls head toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent Bob. \nJUSTICE You guys want anything from inside? \nJAY No, we're cool, thanks hon. \nJustice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study the front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one. After a beat-- \nJAY It just ain't the same, is it? This place licks balls compared to Quick Stop. \nSilent Bob shakes his head \"Yeah.\" \nJAY And speaking of licking balls--how 'bout that Justice chick? She is too fine.  And she smells so fucking pretty. She's got a nice voice, too. And that body?  Smoking. You know, she never once said \"fuck off,\" when I was talking to her, or pulled out the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one. \nINT.

Something nice. \nJAY (thinks; then) Boo-boo kitty fuck. \nJUSTICE (laughing) Okay.  That's a start. \nSissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming it at Jay and Bob. \nSISSY Jay, before you go, could you say something into the camera about the clitoris. \nJAY What? \nJUSTICE (to Sissy) Man you are such a bitch-- \nSISSY (off Justice; to Jay) She's just a little embarrassed. See, Jussy and I are putting together this documentary for our Human Sexuality class, and we need a male perspective on the clitoris. \nJAY The female clitoris? \nSISSY Uh--yeah. \nJUSTICE Jay, you don't have to do this. \nShe elbows Sissy. \nJAY Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few things I can say about the clit that I's like you to hear. (clears throat; into camera) I am the master of the clit! I make that shit work! It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do!  No one rules the clit like me! (off Silent Bob) Not this little fuck! None of you little fucks out there! I am the clit commander!!! Remember that-- commander of all clits! \nJay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces. Justice shakes her head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles. \nSISSY Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger. \nSissy climbs back into the van. \nJAY (to Justice) So--can I get a little kiss for good luck? \nJustice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips. \nJAY So--can I get a little blow job for good luck? \nJustice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off, revealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in midair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out. Justice watches them go. \nSISSY Jussy. C'mon. \nJustice climbs back into the van. \nINT. VAN--SAME \nJustice sits, glaring at Sissy. \nSISSY Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my authority again, you lose your fucking fronts, you got that? \nJUSTICE Yes, sir. \nSissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to Missy, beside whom is a bag full of high-tech equipment. \nSISSY Phase One, down. While we're executing Phase Two, you edit that tape and grab a new car. \nMISSY No sweat. \nSISSY Let's suit up. \nEXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT \nJay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn, stopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN out of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly gives the \"metal\" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame. \nINT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT \nIt's dead quiet and still. Then, the pair smash through a window, landing in the floor in a ball. They lift their Ninja hoods. Jay glares at Silent Bob. \nJAY You fat fuck-- \nINT. VAN--NIGHT \nMissy peers through binoculars out the window. \nSISSY They in? \nMISSY You can say that. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. VAN--NIGHT \nThe quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black. They head for a SEPARATE BUILDING.  Stopping at the front door. \nSissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures elaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers Sissy a look. \nJUSTICE You are so gay. \nChrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four different digits. The door lock CLICKS open. \nSISSY Once we're inside, I want complete silence. (holding up high-tech device) Missy whipped this up. It counts our decibel level. If it goes into the red--alarm, we're dead. So not even the slightest noise, got it? \nJustice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed closely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay and Bob. \nSISSY (pokes her head back out) Justice! Move your ass! \nJustice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads: BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE. \nINT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT \nJay and Bob stand there, looking around the room. \nIt's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking ANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his eyes and hits him. \nJAY Stay frosty, you big fucking softie. We've got a job to do. \nSilent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade through the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on the wall. Inside it, there's a pistol. \nJAY Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up like Percocets! \nJay elbows the glass, breaking it. He takes the gun out and tosses it to Bob. \nJAY Hold this. Later, me and Justice can shoot each other with it and fuck like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg. \nSilent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat. The pair look through the cages, until HEAR the distinct SOUND OF A MONKEY. Jay directs Silent Bob's flashlight to the cage from where the sound emitted. He smiles. \nJAY (reading) \"Suzanne.\" Boo-yah. \nINT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT \nThe three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway. At the other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS. \nSissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly, within the mist, laser beams become apparent. \nSissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs forward and does an impressive series of flips down the hallway, not touching a single laser beam. \nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly. \nOnce Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm. \nChrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly. \nJustice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to Chrissy. \nChrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly. \nThen, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are even more impressive than the other two, including running up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud, manly FART. \nThe decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING through the building. \nCHRISSY Holy fuck--the little stoner was right-- \nSissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds. She ours them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed by Justice and Chrissy. \nEXT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT \nThe Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy pulls up in a CONVERTIBLE. \nCHRISSY Boom Box! \nMissy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the convertible. \nSISSY I can't believe it. Months of planning and it's all blown by a fucking fart. \nJUSTICE We can't just leave them like this! That alarm's gonna bring the cops here any minute! \nSISSY That was always the plan, Justice! They take the heat off of is long enough until we can get out of town! \nChrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van. \n", "test3_id": 2939}

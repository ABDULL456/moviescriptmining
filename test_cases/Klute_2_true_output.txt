BREE (CONT'D) I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something? 
SPANGLER (smiles) I'd just be guessing. 
BREE Guess! 
SPANGLER Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve -- 
BREE (primly, distintly) I do not love him. 
SPANGLER (undeterred, suggests) You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it. 
WE CUT TO: 
EXT. THE PLAZA OF LINCOLN CENTER 
Sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and elegant architecture. Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the civilized monuments to man's search for culture. CAMERA pans to ugly street across the way revealing Klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse topped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue of Liberty. This is the municipal storehouse. 
INT. MUNICIPAL STOREHOUSE - DAY 
The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us in almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE. We are in a huge storeroom. As we grow accustomed to the darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous objects scattered along Klute's path - old pieces of furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc. - the remnants of the lives of the plundered, the destroyed and the dispossessed. Some is stolen property, some evidence for homicide cases, and some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed dead. 
A CUSTODIAN -- an ancient retainer sort, a civil servant, leads KLUTE into an old elevator cage. 
INT. ELEVATOR 
Klute and Custodian as elevator ascends; looking up the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead nowhere. The whole sequence has the feeling of a dream of being lost in a black limbo. 
Klute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floor and walk down the long very low corridor past rows of locked vault doors. The Custodian stops at one and opens it. We are in a small dungeon-like room filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling. The Custodian counts to himself -- 
CUSTODIAN Four -- five -- what number'd I say? 
KLUTE Four ninety-seven, Jane McKenna 
Custodian finds it, unlocks for Klute's inspection. Reaches for paper Klute's holding. 
CUSTODIAN -- And I keep the authorization, please. 
KLUTE I thought there'd be more. 
Klute pokes through a small collection of personal effects -- perhaps an ankle bracelet, rabbits foot, faded snapshot of a child, some letters, pitiful remnants of Jane McKenna's life. Klute closes the drawer, and the front of the drawer is marked McKENNA, JANE? 
Over the visual material of Klute's trip through the warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bits and pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist. 
BREE (V.O.) All right. Loneliness. (space) Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten. (space) Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong. 
SPANGLER (V.O.) (prompts mildly) Don't belong? 
BREE (V.O.) (snappishly) Do you always have to repeat? 
SPANGLER (V.O.) Sorry. (then) 
BREE (V.O.) Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up. 
SPANGLER (V.O.) You think people hate you. 
BREE (V.O.) The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money. (pause) All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together. (pause) Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me. 
SPANGLER (V.O.) Didn't want you. 
BREE (V.O.) (snaps) I said that. (resumes) Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or -- (then more rapidly, plunging) So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it. (beat) And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is. (beat) And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know? 
INT. PROJECTION ROOM - MISSING PERSONS BUREAU 
On the left a portion of the original obscene letter. On the right a series of comparison documents -- beginning with a portion of a personal letter. We hear TRASK'S, KLUTE'S VOICES OVER, and occasionally cut to them as -- 
TRASK'S VOICE (skipping, summarizing) All right, there's Tom Grunemann, you're right, different margins, different spacing absolutely, sloppy, right. 
KLUTE'S VOICE Mm.

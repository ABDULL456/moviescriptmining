GUESTS To King Louis, and the Queen Mother! 
Everyone drinks; Phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his glass in his fingertips -- and it slips through his nervous fingers, hitting the floor with a crash. 
Dead silence; everyone is looking.  Then Anne drops her glass too -- and everybody does it, as if to break the glass is part of the celebration. 
As the music begins again, Anne leans to Phillippe -- 
ANNE I retire now.  Wait two waltzes, then retire to your room; and spend the night in safety.  We have much to talk about, and have the rest of our lives to do it. 
PHILLIPPE Good night, Mother. 
ANNE Good night... my son. 
She kisses him on the cheek; it brings tears to both of them. She moves to the door, everyone bowing as she leaves. 
JUST OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM DOOR 
Anne encounters d'Artagnan.  He stops, so taken by the sight of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her. 
D'ARTAGNAN Anne!  You look -- 
Remembering himself, he bows deeply. 
D'ARTAGNAN My Queen... 
ANNE D'Artagnan. 
She takes his hand, not caring who is watching. 
D'ARTAGNAN I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight. 
ANNE We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow. 
She moves off, toward her room.  D'Artagnan enters the ballroom. 
INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT 
D'Artagnan sees "Louis" sitting on the throne.  More baffled than alarmed, he grabs one of the Musketeer guards near him. 
D'ARTAGNAN How long has the King been back? 
GUARD Some while, Captain. 
D'ARTAGNAN He didn't pass my doorway, I was in my room. 
GUARD He must've, Captain, there is no other way here. 
D'Artagnan stands and thinks; his mind begins to spin. 
PHILLIPPE 
sees d'Artagnan, staring at him... then calling more guards over and giving them quick instructions; the guards hurry away.  Then d'Artagnan moves to Phillippe, and bows.  He looks at him carefully, but seems to see nothing unusual. 
PHILLIPPE Continue. 
D'ARTAGNAN Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me. 
PHILLIPPE ... The ball... Continue. 
D'ARTAGNAN I must insist, Sire. 
Phillippe stands, and follows d'Artagnan from the ball. 
INT.  PASSAGES TO RIVER - NIGHT 
Aramis, Athos and Porthos -- carrying Louis -- descend the secret passages to the foundations of the palace, into a drainage channel leading to the river. 
They have stashed a boat there; they plop Louis into it and climb in themselves.  They row toward the archway that is the exit to the river; the moonlit waters of the Seine glow outside, like a beacon of safe escape. 
But the steel grate of the archway slams down just before they reach it, and blades point at them from every angle of the darkness.  A shielded lantern rises and its wick is turned up, revealing 
D'ARTAGNAN 
he stands with a small contingent of young Musketeers.  His eyes are intense, his face in agony. 
D'ARTAGNAN My friends. 
The only one they can see it d'Artagnan.  They all look at each other, in the small circle of light from the lantern. 
D'ARTAGNAN Only we four, the most trusted Musketeers, knew about the passages, meant to keep the King safe... Your Majesty... 
Phillippe steps out of the darkness; his eyes are full of shame and failure as he looks at Athos, but still he holds on, trying to maintain the charade that he is Louis. 
PHILLIPPE Yes...?  Why do you bring me here, d'Artagnan?

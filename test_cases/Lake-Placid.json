{"train": "LAKE PLACID \nWritten by \nDavid E. Kelley \nMay 6, 1998 Full Pink Draft \nOVER BLACK we HEAR the distant but near melodic CRY of a LOON. \nSLOWLY FADE IN TO: \nEXT. BLACK LAKE - NIGHT \nThe loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.  The loon continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake, the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under, silenced forever.  A lone feather surfaces and floats as: \nCredits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing \"I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW.\" Then-- \nOVER BLACK \nKEOUGH (O.S.) And they pay you for this?  To tag beaver? \nWALT (O.S.) Imagine. \nAs we FADE IN a face COMES INTO FOCUS from underwater.  It is the face of WALT LAWSON (Maine Fish And Game) looking down from a boat. \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nNext to him is SHERIFF HANK KEOUGH, paunch, disposition of an untipped waiter. \nKEOUGH Ask me, what an animal does in the wild is his own business so long as he doesn't do it to man.  I think Mark Twain said that. \nWALT (dry) I think he didn't.  But since you've said it, I guess we're covered. \nKeough holds a stare.  Walt drops overboard.  Keough pulls a Twinkie from his pocket.  Begins to unwrap. \nEXT. NEW YORK - MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY \nINT. MUSEUM - DAY \nFIND  KELLY SCOTT, pretty, thirty, as KEVIN CAMPBELL, forties, approaches. \nKEVIN Kelly. \nKELLY (warmly) Kevin, hey. \nShe beams affection, he exudes a little discomfort. \nKEVIN Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second? \nKELLY (great idea) Absolutely. \nINT. KEVIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nThey enter ON THE CUT, he closes the door. \nKEVIN I had a great time last night. Again. \nKELLY Me too. \nReading his look, she suddenly smells it.  Her face drops. \nKELLY (CONT'D) (deducing) That's not what you came to say. \nKEVIN You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, \"us\"... \nShe's a little crushed. \nANGLE WALT'S REMAINING HAND \nclenching around Keough's arm. \nANGLE WALT'S FACE \nHe knows he's done.  OFF Keough's continued horror, we: \nCUT TO: \nBLACK AND WHITE \nA DINOSAUR (T-Rex) is angry and out for blood. \nREVEAL \nINT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY \nWe're watching an old classic creature feature.  FIND Kelly alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense... watching the movie. As the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the popcorn bag and her mouth. \nANGLE THE SCREEN \nThe monster pursues its human victim. \nANGLE KELLY \nfear on her face. \nANGLE THE SCREEN \nThe monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey. \nANGLE KELLY \nas she screams with fear and delight.  Her scream is only partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers. \nAfter a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again.  Wearing gullibility, vulnerability all over her face.  Then from behind a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with the most blood-curdling scream of all. \nAll the moviegoers turn to SEE... as will WE: \nMYRA OKUBO \nThirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nKelly and Okubo emerge from the movie theater. \nKELLY What do you expect, mugging me from behind? \nOKUBO I tapped you. \nKELLY Well you shouldn't have.  How did you even know where I was. \nOKUBO (sarcastic) Wild guess. \nKELLY I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me. \nOKUBO Kevin told me you were upset. \nKELLY Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else? \nOKUBO (sheepish) Well... he didn't have to tell me that part. \nKelly freezes.  Stares at her.  Then: \nNow she looks up. \nKELLY Sorry? \nKEVIN I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I-- \nKELLY This is what we do? \nKEVIN I'd like you to check out this lake.  See-- \nKELLY Are you on drugs? \nKEVIN Kelly-- \nKELLY I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street-- \nKEVIN Part of our research-- \nKELLY I'm not even a field person. \nKEVIN Well on this one I'd like you to be. \nKelly stares back.  The nickle drops. \nKELLY This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until-- \nKEVIN It has nothing to do with-- \nKELLY I never do field work and even if I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something-- \nKEVIN Kelly-- \nKELLY I am not going to Maine.  That's ridiculous. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAINE SKIES - DAY \nA sea helicopter is sailing up against the blue sky, nothing but Evergreens and lakes below. \nINT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS \nKelly with the Pilot.  She looks a little white. \nINT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY \nKelly is walking with Keough toward the morgue. \nKEOUGH He just came up screaming. \nKELLY Did he say anything? \nKEOUGH He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead. \nKELLY And you didn't see anything? \nKEOUGH The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there. \nKELLY (seeing) There?  That's the morgue. \nKEOUGH Yes. \nKELLY Is the dead guy in there? \nKEOUGH That's where they keep them. (then) You want me to bring the tooth out here? \nKELLY Um. (bravado) No, no.  Let's go. \nKEOUGH Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here. \nKELLY You have a thing against museums? \nKEOUGH I got nothing against-- \nKELLY Ever even been in one? \nHe stares back.  Then picks up a huge cannon-like gun.  As he loads it-- \nKELLY What is that? \nKEOUGH Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead. \nKELLY (incredulous) And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia? \nA beat. \nKEOUGH You're sort of a rude person. \nKELLY It's just that-- \nSuddenly, like a shot, Kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a white fog from a can of Yard Guard.  Keough holds a look at her. \nKELLY (CONT'D) Mosquitos.  I have a thing about mosquitos. \nUpon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked \"Maine Fish And Game\".  Jack Wells emerges, Kelly's eyes scan him like radar. \nJACK We set? \nKEOUGH Ready. (re Kelly; dry) A museum in New York sent us some additional back up. \nKelly shoots Keough a look.  Then: \nKELLY Kelly Scott. \nJACK Jack Wells.  A museum sent you? \nKELLY Are we all museum bigots in Maine? \nJack holds a look, decides to let that pass. \nJACK Did you make anything of the tooth? \nKELLY Yes, it did seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it worked, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body. \nJack holds another look. \nKELLY (CONT'D) Why are you staring at me? (to Keough) Do I have a smudge on my face, it would be so you not to have told me. \nKeough also lets that pass. \nKEOUGH (to Jack) I'm ready when you are. \nJACK Let's go. \nAs they start out, Kelly grabs Jack by the arm. \nKELLY Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a small point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by him, but you seemed quick to join in. \nJACK Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well. \nAs JANINE POST, sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up. \nJANINE Excuse me?  Is it true you're going to look for some kind of monster in Black Lake? \nKEOUGH We're just going to investigate an accident.  There's no monster. \nKELLY (to Jack) Gee. \nJack smiles, gets her sarcasm. \nKEOUGH The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up. \nKELLY (what?) We're staying in tents? \nKEOUGH I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp. \nKELLY Yes, camp, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard \"tents\", will there be toilets? \nKEOUGH (seeing something) What the hell? \nKeough's attention has been otherwise arrested.  He sees something in the water. \nKELLY What? \nKEOUGH (slowing the boat) I thought I saw... \nKELLY It looks like a branch. \nHe leans over to grab something floating in the water.  Looks like a branch.  He lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler. Connected to the severed head of a moose.  Keough, seeing it as he lifts it, screams, throwing it. \nIt hits Kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the HEAD hits the floor of the boat with a HEAVY THUD.  Kelly rears back, still screaming, and belts Keough in the shoulder. \nKEOUGH Hey!! \nKELLY You threw it at me!! \nKEOUGH (denying) I just let go of it. \nKELLY                       JACK You threw it at me!!       Alright. (to Jack) Did you see that? \nShe belts him again. \nKEOUGH                      JACK (CONT'D) Stop hitting me!           Ma'am! \nKELLY Don't throw heads at me, (to Jack) and stop calling me \"Ma'am\"! \nANGLE THE HEAD \nRESUME \nA beat.  This head looks ripped off the body. \nJACK What is going on here? \nEXT. BEACHSIDE CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER \nA small tent camp is being set up.  People unpacking.  Two Deputies, BURKE and STEPHENS, present.  Kelly is with Jack. \nKELLY How big do the bears get? \nJACK Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water.  On land maybe.  But... \nKELLY And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow? \nJACK Hank says he's sure. \nKelly takes in the scenic surroundings. \nKELLY It really is beautiful, isn't it? \nJACK Never been to Maine before? \nKELLY I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene. (off Jack) I never believed it. \nHector gives the toe to Keough, then heads off.  Keough stands there, holding the tow, as we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nKelly is testing a MACHINE that sends out little SQUEAKY SOUNDS, as Jack approaches.  He stops.  Takes a second to... well, admire her.  She's an attractive woman.  He then approaches. \nJACK Baby crocs? \nKELLY Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there... \nJACK If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible? \nKELLY Because they just consult their little indigenous charts. \nA beat, as she tends to her work. \nJACK Listen... if you really do know crocs, you should know how stealth like they are.  I wouldn't be standing a foot from the water. \nShe looks. \nJACK (CONT'D) He could be right there and you wouldn't see him. \nKELLY (still looking at the water) I'd be able to see something. \nUpon which, Jack tosses a rock over her shoulder.  As it makes a splash, she screams and practically jumps into his arms. Then: \nKELLY (CONT'D) (realizing) Oh that's funny.  That was real funny. \nAnd she heads off.  OFF Jack, we: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HECTOR'S TENT - NIGHT \nTwo deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of his tent.  From within we HEAR MUSIC, the SOUNDS of a PARTY. Keough approaches... looks at Deputy Burke, who's digging. \nBURKE (shrugs) He paid us.  Five hundred. \nKeough continues on toward the tent. \nINT. HECTOR'S TENT - CONTINUOUS \nHis tent is on the palatial side.  Stereo, generator, he's got a margarita bar going.  There's a party.  Hector's dancing with Deputy Gare, others are enjoying the drinks and MUSIC. \nHECTOR You're a beautiful woman. \nGARE Thank you. \nHECTOR And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity. \nUpon which, Keough enters, doesn't like what he sees. \nKEOUGH Hey. \nHe goes, turns OFF the MUSIC. \nKEOUGH We are here on official business. \nHECTOR Cocktail? \nKEOUGH No!! (then) What's with digging the holes? \nHECTOR They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it. \nKEOUGH Everybody out, back to your tents, now! \nJACK (feels bad now) I'm sorry but you're... \nA beat. He doesn't finish the sentence. \nKELLY (genuine) I do know crocodiles and I won't get in your way. (then) I really do want to be a part of this. \nJack reads her, he can see that she does. \nJACK Okay. (then) We're up at six. \nKELLY Good. \nJACK (a beat) 'Night. \nThere's a little chemistry here, though both would probably deny it.  He heads off toward his tent, she sits with her book.  She gives one last look, watches him go.  Then she goes back to her book. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LAKE - MUCH LATER \nThe lake is still, the campfire is out, the tents are quiet. The quiet SOUNDS of NIGHT.  CRICKETS.  A LOON.  An OWL.  A courageous raccoon looks about, seeing what he can rummage.  By the water... a black bear takes a drink. \nANGLE KEOUGH'S TENT \nHe emerges, compelled by a full bladder, wearing only his trousers, carrying a revolver.  He walks into the nearby woods. He removes from his shorts his bladder's connection to the outside world.  Proceeds to URINATE.  Then... he hears something.  The SOUND of RUSTLING LEAVES.  He STOPS URINATING, we HEAR a HALF SECOND of MOVEMENT.  Then quiet.  Must be his imagination.  He RESUMES his business. \nMore RUSTLING, it's not just the sound of dense urine against leaves, he stops... something's out there in the darkness. Quiet.  He starts up for a second, STOPS QUICKLY, and we HEAR it for sure.  Something's RUSTLING TOWARDS him.  With his free hand, Keough pulls out his revolver.  More RUSTLING... Keough points the gun.  Something on the ground is coming toward him. He moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness.  The RUSTLING is getting LOUDER.  It's almost upon him.  A beat.  CLOSER. CLOSER.  Then Keough peels away a bush revealing: \nHECTOR \nLooking into a gun barrel.  He screams.  Keough screams.  Then-- \nHECTOR Jesus Christ!! \nKEOUGH What the hell are you doing?!! \nHECTOR What are you doing?! \nKEOUGH You're crawling around like a-- \nHECTOR I'm laying a spring trap! \nKEOUGH A spring trap! \nHECTOR I keep telling you, they can come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night-- \nKEOUGH I coulda shot you, you-- \nHECTOR This could end up saving your life,-- \nHECTOR (CONT'D)                  KEOUGH You'll be glad you didn't    Hey look, I'm sure you shoot me then, you'll be     finished first in your tongue massaging my          class but I think you need hemorrhoids, just before     to be retired to the big rubber running off to get your      room, where you can play with sister pregnant, who you     soft stuffed reptiles. probably already call mom. \nAnd now all the others, awakened, are charging. \nKELLY (arriving) Hey!  What is going on? \nHECTOR                    KEOUGH This man takes a pistol     He's crawling around-- to pee! \nKEOUGH (CONT'D) (escalating) This is an official investigation, and this cuckoo bird is a civilian. I don't care how much money he's got, he's a total mental. \nAnd Hector storms off.  A beat. \nKELLY You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize. \nKEOUGH Apologize? \nKELLY                   KEOUGH (CONT'D) We're a team here.  It     He's a fruitcake! won't kill you to get along. \nJACK Good. (climbing over) See ya soon. \nKELLY Good luck. \nThere was a twinge of real concern in her voice.  He makes eye contact with her.  Then drops over.  Goes under. \nHECTOR (to Kelly) Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count. \nKELLY What? (off Hector's look) Oh as if I'm interested. \nHECTOR As if. (as he's about to go overboard; to Keough) Will you miss me? \nKEOUGH (to Hector) I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck. \nHECTOR No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log. \nAnd Hector drops overboard. \nKEOUGH (to Kelly) Was that like a homo-sexual remark? \nKELLY (strict) I asked you to be nice to him. \nKeough rolls his eyes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNDERWATER - ANGLE ON JACK - DAY \nJack, diving.  We HEAR the HIGH PITCH of CROCODILE HATCHLINGS. Visibility is again pretty limited. \nEXT. LAKE - ANGLE ON HECTOR - UNDERWATER - DAY \nHector dives through the dark black water.  Visibility is lousy. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - THIRTY MINUTES LATER \nJack dives, searched.  Looks ahead, sees something... He moves closer... it's the carcass of the moose, no head. \nEXT. LAKE - AN HOUR LATER \nKelly and Keough onboard. \nKELLY He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped. \nKEOUGH And that's why he thinks they're Godly? \nKELLY He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes. \nKEOUGH (simple) You like Jack? \nKELLY (thrown) What?  I don't even know the guy. \nKEOUGH Hector thinks you like him. \nKELLY Well Hector's a giant cracker. \nKEOUGH You think Jack's handsome? \nKELLY What is this? \nKEOUGH I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome? \nKELLY Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah. \nA beat. \nKEOUGH Am I? \nANGLE KELLY \nKELLY Hurry up!! \nSuddenly about thirty feet away... we SEE fish breaking water. \nKELLY (CONT'D) Shit!!  Hank!! \nThe boat is zooming toward her.  It arrives.  As Keough and Burke go to pull her aboard, we see a dark shadow rising. \nBURKE (screaming) Look out!! \nAnd Jack explodes out of the water, it was his shadow.  Keough and Burke pull them both aboard. \nKEOUGH (back to Kelly) Are you alright? \nKELLY I think.  My hair. (then) Where's Hector?! (to Jack) Where is he? \nJACK We went in different directions. That water is thick, you can't see through it! \nEXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS \nHector is swimming toward the surface.  Suddenly... a shadow looms over him.  He looks up. \nHIS P.O.V. \nThere is no boat.  We can't see it, just a big shadowy mass. \nRESUME HECTOR \nHe's scared. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS \nKEOUGH (into headset) Hector!  Hector, we got dragged off position, when you surface, you gotta yell. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS \nHector is still charging toward the surface.  The lack of visibility is frightening, something could be six feet away and he wouldn't know it. \nEXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS \nKELLY (pointing) There's bubbles over there!  Look! \nKeough quickly maneuvers the boat to where Kelly indicated, under-- \nKELLY (CONT'D) There he is.  Here he comes! \nAnd Keough has the boat to him as Hector breaks surface. \nAnd they quickly pull Hector on board, all attention is on Hector as they lean over to rescue him.  On the far right... two eyes... moving closer to the oblivious rescuers. \nSlowly moving in, everybody is so preoccupied with Hector, Deputy Burke, at the end of the boat, is leaning way over to see Hector.  If only he knew what he's not seeing.  The eyes come closer.  They're now in the water right below Burke's head.  How can he not see it?  A beat.  Another beat.  Then... suddenly, a mouth, a dragon, teeth, something, flashes from the water-- snap.  And Deputy Burke's head is simply gone as his limp body hangs over the boat.  Kelly screams in horror. \nIn a microsecond, Burke's head and life are both gone.  OFF their stunned faces, as Kelly continues to scream we: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET \nBurke's body is being loaded into an ambulance.  People move in silence, the wake of tragedy.  A few State Troopers are on the scene. \nKEOUGH (giving a statement) Nobody actually saw it.  It happened sudden. \nPAN TO FIND Kelly, staring almost blankly, as Jack, finishing a phone call, approaches.  He measures her expression, she's still in shock. \nShe just stares out as if she didn't hear.  And he fixes his own stare on her.  Feeling it, she turns, catches him looking at her, he diverts the stare.  She feigns a non-reaction.  A beat. \nJACK (CONT'D) You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion. \nKELLY Excuse me? \nJACK When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's... (a beat) in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie. \nKELLY What are you talking about? \nJACK I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good. \nKELLY Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist. \nJACK Forgive me for trying to be nice. \nKELLY Nice?  Nice would be \"you look pretty,\" nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good. \nJACK I didn't say it like that. \nKELLY You did, you-- \nJACK I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science. \nKELLY A man just died, you're hitting on me with science. \nJACK Just forget it. \nHECTOR (arriving) Beg pardon?  Sorry to intrude but Hank seems to have gotten himself stuck in a tree. \nEXT. CAMPSITE - SECONDS LATER \nHank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as Hector, Kelly, and Jack approach. \nHECTOR I probably could've accomplished freeing him myself but he had a look of mayhem on his upside down face. \nThey arrive.  Hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still. \nKELLY Hank? \nKEOUGH (calmly) Yes. \nThe three exchange looks. \nKELLY Are you okay? \nKEOUGH (calmly; almost sweet) Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine. (then) Could you cut me down? \nHECTOR Promise you won't kill me, first. \nKEOUGH (calmly) I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector. (again) Could you please cut me down? \nJack gives Kelly a knife. \nJACK You cut, we'll hold him. \nHector and Jack grab hold, Kelly cuts, they lower him to the ground.  He rises. \nKEOUGH (calm) Thank you. (then) I lied. \nAnd he charges after Hector, who runs toward the beach.  Keough chases, Jack and Kelly pursue, trying to stop him.  And suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging GROWL.  An attack.  Screams all over, a half-second of confusion before we SEE it's a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the darkness, right at Hector.  Hector dives out of its path. Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs. Seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water the giant jaws of a crocodile. \nIn a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it, slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water. \nThe bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only be one outcome here.  In a matter of seconds, both bear and crocodile have vanished.  And the water is calm again. \nANGLE THE FACES \nKELLY I wonder if he's some kind of mutant. (then) That bear had to be surprised. \nJACK (taking her arm; ushering) Let's get away from the shore. \nShe looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self- consious. \nJACK (CONT'D) Sorry. \nKELLY It's okay. \nThey hold a look. \nEXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT \nWe are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake.  A four-wheel-drive of some sort is bumping down a fairly unpassable dirt road into the clearing. \nTOM (O.S.) Told you I could make it. \nAs the jeep comes more INTO VIEW, we REVEAL its occupants to be six teenagers, including Janine, and TOM, STEVE, DANNY, CAROL, ELLEN.  They've been drinking but they're not sloppy drunk.  As they climb out, Tom points to a swing rope which extends from the branch of a tree that overhangs the water. \nTOM There it is. \nSTEVE (stripping) Last one in's a dead man. \nCould be more like first one in.  The teenagers begin to strip off their clothes.  As they giggle and laugh we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. KELLY'S TENT - NIGHT \nKelly is butterflying Jack's wound, necessarily working very close to him. \nJACK Ow.  Shit. \nKELLY Just gotta pull it a little tighter. \nJACK Who taught you be be a nurse? \nKELLY Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here. \nJACK No thanks. \nKELLY Keep it dry.  No swimming. \nJACK (dry) Thank you. \nThey hold a look.  Then -- \nJACK (CONT'D) You're having the best time of your life, aren't you? \nKELLY (caught) What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would... (off his look; copping) Does it show? \nJack nods slightly. \nKELLY (CONT'D) This is the first time I've actually... y'know been in the middle of anything.  I've never really even gotten dirty before, with me showers have always been preventative. \nTheir eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and nervous. \nJACK That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something? \nKELLY Maybe.  I've always read about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace while something is actually... y'know... happening. \nSomething is happening right now.  A beat. \nKELLY (CONT'D) We should probably go to bed. (quickly) Get rest, get some rest.  Go to our separate beds, get some rest. \nThe Freudian slip of her life.  They hold another look.  Then he starts to exit.  He stops at the door, turns back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nHector and Kelly are flying toward the area, the search beams are on. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON JANINE \nJANINE He just took him in his jaws. \nREVEAL \nEXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT \nThe teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on. Hector's chopper is hovering over the area, its beams lighting the water.  Lying on the beach, covered... is Tommy.  Alive. And basically unhurt! \nKEOUGH He was in his mouth?! \nJANINE Yes. \nJACK (stunned; to Tommy) You're okay? \nTOMMY (in shock) I think; just cuts. \nDANNY The thing just came up out of the water and kind of spit him at us. \nJANINE You should have signs posted, for God's sake! \nJACK (examining him) You're really okay? \nTommy nods.  Then-- \nTOMMY I might need a Tetanus. \nKeough and Jack exchange a look of disbelief. \nEXT. CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER \nHector, Keough, Jack, and Kelly, looking tired, trek toward their tents. \nHECTOR Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know? \nKEOUGH (dismissive) He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear. \nHECTOR Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God-- \nKEOUGH I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me. \nHECTOR That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful. (then) Nightcap? \nKEOUGH Raincheck. \nThey're growing on each other.  Jack and Kelly exchange a smile. Hector and Keough are developing an odd kinship almost.  They continue on as Jack and Kelly stop at her tent. \nJACK Well.  Goodnight. \nKELLY We seem to say goodnight a lot. \nJACK We could not say it and... (suddenly a coward) Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to... \nShe smiles.  Then: \nKELLY Night. \nHe holds another look.  She goes into her tent.  He stands there.  A beat.  Waits to see if she calls him back.  She doesn't.  He then heads off.  Her head pops out.  Watches him go.  Almost calls after him.  Doesn't. \nKELLY Thing we can lift it? \nJACK Maybe.  Don't mush it. \nKELLY (annoyed) I'm not mushing it. \nJACK You're mushing it a little around the-- \nKELLY I'm not mushing it. \nSuddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot, scaring all of them, but particularly Kelly who jumps.  Her foot lands on a long extended branch, and even more suddenly Burke's severed head seesaws out of the shallow water, hitting her in the shin. She screams as they all jump back. \nANGLE THE HEAD \nRESUME \nThey just stare, as Kelly continues to scream. \nJACK (holding her) Okay.  Okay.  Okay. \nKELLY That is it!! \nJACK Really-- \nKELLY No.  I keep getting hit with heads! \nJACK (holding her shoulders) Calm down. \nKELLY You calm down! \nJACK Calm down. \nShe takes a couple of calming breaths. \nKELLY I'm being very calm.  I'm composed. This is the second time I've been hit with a severed head, I'm entitled to complain. \nSTEVENS (re the head) Is that uh... \nKEOUGH I can't recognize him from the back.  It looks like him. \nKeough takes a stick.  Squeamish, he tentatively pokes the head, trying to turn it over. \nANGLE THE HEAD \nIt is Burke. \nRESUME \nKeough leans in for a closer look. \nKEOUGH That's him. (re something) What the...? \nSomething appears to be in his mouth.  Keough takes a small twig, pries back a cheek... the mouth is full of worms. \nKEOUGH (CONT'D) Now I'm gonna puke. \nJACK (seeing something) You gotta be kidding. \nKELLY What? \nJACK (pointing) Look. \nTHEIR P.O.V. \nAbout a hundred yards north, Mrs. Bickerman is leading a blindfolded cow to the water. \nRESUME \nGARE (getting panicked) C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't-- \nHECTOR I need to see his habitat. \nAs he drops in. \nGARE Please.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water. \nHECTOR He's not gonna hurt me. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nKelly, Jack and Keough with Bickerman. \nBICKERMAN Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  No.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile... \nKEOUGH You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest. \nBICKERMAN Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat. \nGARE (O.S.) (through walkie-talkie) Hank!  We got a problem with Hector. \nKEOUGH (into walkie-talkie) What problem? \nGARE (O.S.) \n(through walkie-talkie) He went swimming. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS \nHector is underwater, exploring. \nANGLE GARE ON THE CHOPPER \nHer radar is up, she heard something.  But she doesn't see anything.  She scans the surface closely. \nEXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS \nThe water is slightly more visible as Hector swims.  Other than the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing extraordinary.  Then, a flash shadow looms over him.  He looks up, but sees nothing.  Probably just the sun ducking under a cloud.  It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head for the surface.  He swims upward. \nEXT. LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUS \nHector breaks the top.  Lifts his mask, looks toward the chopper, which he sees about forty yards out.  He continues to breaststroke on the surface.  Suddenly... the croc's head rises up right behind Hector, who's oblivious.  He continues to swim. The croc follows.  Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets a feeling he's being followed.  He then turns to look the other way, upon which his face goes rigid. \nHIS P.O.V. \nAbout three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at him. \nANGLE HECTOR \nashen. \nHECTOR (weakly) Oh.... my. \nThe croc doesn't move.  It just stares at him.  Then end of his snout is almost touching Hector.  Hector himself doesn't dare move, for fear of spooking the croc into action.  We get the idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling any spiritual voids.  A beat. \nHECTOR (CONT'D) I suddenly feel a bit foolish. (then) You're different from the others. \nThe croc raises his head now to reveal the snout.  And his deadly smile.  Hector just tries to tread water with as little motion as possible.  He deathly fears a quick movement will cause his life to be over.  Perhaps this is what he came for. To be judged by this symbol of mythology. \nHe backswims ever so slightly.  The croc pursues just as slowly, their eyes are locked.  He could snap off Hector's head in an instant. \nHECTOR (CONT'D) (terrified; trying to convince himself) Holy spirit of Sobek.  Holy ghost. (swallows) Holy shit. \nJACK So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to-- \nHECTOR We both know what they'll do. \nSilence.  Admission by silence.  Then-- \nJACK Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land. \nKEOUGH Other than to eat us? \nHECTOR He follows anything that moves. You guys can be in the trucks with tranq guns.  If he charges, drive off, plus Hank you've got your hand- held cannon.  We could do this with no safety risk.  If it works, we save a beast that should be saved. \nA beat.  They are sympathetic to the idea. \nJACK And again.  How would you get him on land? \nHECTOR That's actually the easy part. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BICKERMAN'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER \nWe HEAR the CHOPPER. \nBICKERMAN (to Keough) I'll sue you. \nKEOUGH Go ahead. \nAnd up goes Hector's chopper.  And... REVEAL connected to a long cable... a cow.  An airborne cow, dangling from the chopper. \nBICKERMAN (to Jack) You can't take a cow by eminent domain. \nJACK We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am. \nBICKERMAN You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers. \nJack turns to Kelly. \nJACK Are we crazy? \nKELLY Well... \nJACK We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter. \nShe shrugs. \nKEOUGH Let's get back to camp. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS \nHector pilots. \nHECTOR Not much drag.  As long as I can keep him from swinging, we're okay. \nEXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS \nHector's chopper is flying the befuddled animal toward the cove. FIND Keough, Kelly, and Jack on the water cruising back to camp. Keough has his gun. \nEXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER \nTwo pickup trucks have been backed in for a shooting vantage. Kelly, Jack, Keough.  Riflemen are ready with tranq guns. \nANGLE JACK \nJACK (into headset) Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim. \nJACK Hector, you see anything? \nANGLE HECTOR \non the pontoon of his chopper.  He's looking about, studying the water. \nHECTOR No! \nKEOUGH (sarcastic) I just have this feeling everything's totally safe. \nHECTOR (yelling) I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank. \nAnd as Hector looks further.  Behind him... up surfaces the crocodile in all his stealth.  His head is two feet from Hector and nobody knows it.  Least of all Hector. \nHECTOR (CONT'D) I can't see him, but this is definitely blood.  Maybe you got him. \nAnd as he turns back, he sees it.  The croc comes up as Hector screams, jumps off.  Screams.  Keough leaps off the truck and charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give Hector some cover. \nHector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  He climbs in. \nKEOUGH Where is he?! \nHECTOR I don't know! \nNo sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  As he springs toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other side.  The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin and he becomes wedged.  The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes right through the chopper.  He's not completely immobilized but wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him. \nKEOUGH Hector!! \nBut now Jack has joined, rifle in hand.  Hector surfaces again, swimming for shore.  Jack runs to help him onto land. \nKEOUGH (CONT'D) (taking aim) Alright.  Game over. \nBut the croc looks feeble now.  He lets out this MOAN of DEATH. And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger. \nKEOUGH (CONT'D) (to Kelly) Should I? \nKELLY Wait. \nRESUME \nThe croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach. But there's no rage in his behavior now.  He seems desperate. He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two ton piece of metal and he's exhausted. \nKELLY I think the drugs are kicking in. \nBreathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to free himself from the mangled wreckage.  As unbelievable as that cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  A thirty foot exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  And he just cannot go on anymore. \nKelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back.  They approach with caution.  They all stare at the tired crocodile. \nANGLE THE CROC \nHe's now looking back.  Bleeding, gasping... beaten.  In his eyes... we can see it.  The beast is beaten. \nANGLE THE PRINCIPLES \nThere's no triumph.  In their eyes... sadness. \nJACK I don't think we really want to wait for him to catch his breath. \nIt continues to breathe heavily. \nKELLY He's through fighting.  Look at him. \nJACK I don't care.  Hank.  End it. \nKeough raises his cannon. \nHECTOR No.  Look.  He's got nothing left. \nHECTOR And Hank. (to Keough) I know you weren't really trying to hit him. \nKEOUGH (gently) I was aiming for you. \nHector smiles. \nHECTOR Thanks for the rescue. \nJack leans down. \nJACK You take care. \nHECTOR You talk to Bickerman? \nJACK She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off. \nHECTOR Women's intuition.  Are there anymore? \nJACK Just those two. \nPARAMEDIC We gotta take him. \nJACK Okay. \nPARAMEDIC We got room for one. \nJACK Well... I got stuff to pack up and... \nHe looks to Kelly, but before she can say \"yes\"-- \nKEOUGH (grudging) I'll go. \nHector smiles.  The Paramedics board Hector.  Keough turns to Jack. \nKEOUGH Thanks for your help. \nJACK You too. \nHandshake.  Respect.  That's about as much affection as you get from Keough.  He then extends his hand to Kelly. \nKELLY I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch? \nKEOUGH I guess. \nAnd she kisses him on the cheek.  Keough fights off his blush, boards the chopper.  As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack. \nKELLY Well... \nJACK You wanna ride in my truck? \nGARE (arriving) Your truck is jammed.  Should we take some stuff out? \nKELLY No, no, I'll be a while anyway. I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake. \nJACK You sure?  I don't mind... \nKELLY No, I actually want to stay for a little while. \nThey hold a look.  Then-- \nKELLY (CONT'D) I'll miss you most of all scarecrow. \nAnd she kisses his cheek. \nJACK If I'm ever in New York... \nKELLY Yeah. \n", "test1_input": "KELLY                KEOUGH (flaring)             (frustrated) I have not.           Who is this man? \nHECTOR Hector Cyr, I said it once, let me know when it sinks in, (to Kelly) have you seen it? \nKELLY                      KEOUGH (CONT'D) No.                        Mister... \nKELLY (CONT'D) It couldn't be a crocodile. \nHECTOR They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,-- \nKEOUGH (frustrated) Mr. Cyr! \nHECTOR C'mon, we're losing light, (to Kelly) why does the big one heckle me? \nKelly yanks him aside. \nKELLY (sotto) Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since he's the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self. \nHECTOR That hurt my feelings. \nAnd it did a little.  Hector is a big Teddy Bear. \nJACK (arriving) If we're gonna go we better go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAKE - SUNSET \nKeough and Kelly are in one canoe, Hector and Jack are alongside in another.  Hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar devices.  The calm.  The still.  The beauty. \nHECTOR If he's here, I'll find him. (to Jack, re Kelly) Did she tell you we had sex together? \nKELLY I never had sex with you! \nHECTOR Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage. \nKEOUGH I really don't mean to be discourteous. (patronizing) But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England? \nHECTOR They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time. \nKEOUGH And what would he do come winter? \nHECTOR They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive, (to Kelly) am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name? \nKELLY                    KEOUGH (scolding)          Hey. Hector. \nHECTOR (to Keough) Is this where it happened? \nKEOUGH Around here.  Yeah. \nHECTOR (knows his crocodiles) If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source. \nKELLY But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway. \nHECTOR 'Cept he wasn't before, was he? (then to Keough) You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat. \nKELLY Hector. \nSuddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty feet away. \nJACK What's that? \nKEOUGH White perch. \nJACK Are they feeding? \nKEOUGH Doesn't look like it. \n", "test1_true": "KELLY They look scared. \nUpon which something grabs the front of Kelly's canoe and with one crisp yank, flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table, sending them all flying. \nIn an instant, Keough and Kelly are swimming for their lives. Screaming/yelling, they scramble for the canoe, climb onto it's flipped-over back.  Breathless, they all exchange confused looks.  \"What the hell happened\"? \nKELLY (CONT'D) My hair. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMPSITE - SUNDOWN \nKelly, still in wet clothes, is talking on her portable phone. Keough is there as Hector approaches.  Jack is approaching as well.  Activity bustles in the b.g. \nKELLY (into her phone) None of us actually saw anything. (then) I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink. \nHECTOR What's going on? \nKEOUGH They don't believe her. \nKELLY (still into phone) Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. (she clicks off) \nHECTOR Such the flirt. \nKELLY U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation. \nJACK Same thing from Fish And Game. \nKELLY Something's in that water. \nJACK Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people. \nAs DEPUTY SHARON GARE approaches-- \nGARE (O.S.) (calling) Sheriff. \nKeough looks over. \nGARE (pointing to the ground) You might want to see this. \nThey all walk over. \nANGLE THE GROUND \nThere's hundreds, maybe a thousand worms squirming, surrounding... a human toe. \nKELLY (O.S.) Oh God, worms.  I got a thing about worms. \nRESUME \nGARE It's a human toe. \nHector studies it, picks it up.  Then-- \nHECTOR Some decomposition, little acidic, it has been swallowed. (to Keough; holding the toe) Is this the man who was killed? \nKeough deadpans back.  Then-- \nKEOUGH We'd only just met. \nHECTOR Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species. \nKEOUGH Keystone what? \nHECTOR Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile. (proffering the toe) Bury your friend. \n", "test2_input": "The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open.  Gare FIRES her REVOLVER.  It might as well shoot BB's.  The croc is undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER \nJack is nearly manhandling Hector, pulling him by the elbow towards his tent.  Kelly and Keough are there too. \nJACK (livid) This time, I'm gonna kick your ass. \nHECTOR Bastard bit my chopper. \nJACK Hey!! \nJack simply grabs his arm and squeezes a pressure point.  Hector yelps in pain. \nJACK (CONT'D) You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide? \nKELLY Alright, Jack! \nJACK No! (back to Hector) You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and-- \nHECTOR (flaring) Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe-- \nJACK 'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid-- \nKELLY Jack! \nHECTOR I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority-- \nKEOUGH I can arrest you!! \nHECTOR Then do it!! \nKEOUGH You probably do want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker. \nHECTOR So profound and fat. \nHector, feelings hurt, stomps off again.  Kelly looks at Jack. Then Kelly follows Hector. \nINT. HECTOR'S TENT - A MINUTE LATER \nHector enters, sits.  A beat.  Kelly enters, goes to sit next to him. \nKELLY (softly) Did you want to be killed by it? \nHECTOR You think I'm that nuts? \nKELLY (softly) Hector. (then) What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on. \nHECTOR Nothing's real. \nKELLY Excuse me? \nHECTOR Nothing's real. (escalating) I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and-- \nHe's sounding erratic. \nHECTOR (CONT'D) With crocodiles... everything's even. \nKELLY I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than-- \nHECTOR (pained) I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack-- \nKELLY Oh, bullshit. \nAnd Hector drops the act. \n", "test2_true": "KELLY No. \nHECTOR (worth a try) Eh.  Fuck it. \nKELLY Can I tell them you won't go back in the water? \nHECTOR Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know... \nHe has trouble saying it. \nKELLY What? \nHECTOR Could we have intercourse? \nShe just whacks him.  Then exits.  OFF Hector, \"worth a shot\", we: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMPSITE - DAY \nJack and Keough are there to meet Kelly. \nJACK Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four. \nKELLY Okay. \nJACK We might as well pack. \nKELLY Good idea. \nHECTOR (O.S.) They'll kill him. \nThey turn to see, Hector is standing there. \nHECTOR They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns. \nKELLY They could try to tranq him on land. \nHECTOR (knowing) They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down. \nKEOUGH Gee, that would really disappoint me. \nHECTOR Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he is a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. A grand dragon.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive. \nJACK Well, you can try talking them into that, if-- \nHECTOR I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to-- \nJACK Forget it. \nHECTOR Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,-- \nKEOUGH                    HECTOR (CONT'D) Which is exactly          Please, Hank, let me finish what...                 I'm having a sane moment, this is a window. \nHECTOR (CONT'D) If he were neutralized when they got here... they might consider saving him. \nKELLY And how would we neutralize him? \nHECTOR We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs. \nJACK No way. \nHECTOR Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant. \nHector's impassioned here, he's not fooling around. \n", "test3_input": "Sure enough... that giant snout breaks the surface.  Ever so calmly... it moves toward the cow. \nEXT.

(to the others) Let's get ready. \nHector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore. Behind it... the snout and eyes of a giant croc.  Back on the shore, Keough's men ready themselves for action.  Tranq guns. rifles... the team is mobilized.  We HEAR a DISTRESSED CRY from the COW. \nKELLY He's mooing. \nJACK You wouldn't? \nKEOUGH They're coming right in. \nKELLY Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you? \nKEOUGH That it's about to go wrong. \nJACK (into walkie talkie) Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow. \nHECTOR (O.S.) (sarcastic, through walkie talkie) Thank you, Jack. \nJACK (to the team) You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling \"go\" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land. (to Keough) You set? \nKEOUGH Don't worry about me. \nIncredibly... the plan is working.  A giant dragon is following a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline. \nHector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore.  The big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank steak.  The time is now. \nINT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS \nHECTOR We're in about four feet of water now. \nEXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS \nJACK Little closer.  Three, two, one... \nThe crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow, snapping at air.  Hector pulls up with the chopper. \nJACK (CONT'D) Fire!! \nJack, Gare, and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts. But Hector has taken his chopper up too fast, causing the cow to swing like a pendulum.  It rocks the chopper. \nINT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS \nHECTOR Oh, shit. \nThe chopper is in trouble.

I'll get Hector!! \nJACK Where is he?! \nKELLY We gotta get to Hector!! \nJACK (to the driver) Back us in a little, we need to get a shot! \nHector pops his head out of the overturned chopper.

Do not move. \nThe water is calm again.  A beat. \nJACK (CONT'D) (to Gare) You see anything? \nGARE (looking through binocs) Nothing.  Maybe he swam out. \nUpon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging the truck.  Screams. \nJACK Go!!  Drive!! \nThe pick-up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing Keough off balance.  The croc heads back for the water as Keough regains his balance. \nJACK (CONT'D) Take him!! \nAnd Keough blasts.  It detonates the ground near the croc causing him to surge airborne into the water.  And he goes under.  Silence.  A beat. \nKELLY Did you get him? \nKEOUGH I don't know.

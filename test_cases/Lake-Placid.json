{"test1_input": "LAKE PLACID \nWritten by \nDavid E. Kelley \nMay 6, 1998 Full Pink Draft \nOVER BLACK we HEAR the distant but near melodic CRY of a LOON. \nSLOWLY FADE IN TO: \nEXT. BLACK LAKE - NIGHT \nThe loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.  The loon continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake, the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under, silenced forever.  A lone feather surfaces and floats as: \nCredits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing \"I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW.\" Then-- \nOVER BLACK \nKEOUGH (O.S.) And they pay you for this?  To tag beaver? \nWALT (O.S.) Imagine. \nAs we FADE IN a face COMES INTO FOCUS from underwater.  It is the face of WALT LAWSON (Maine Fish And Game) looking down from a boat. \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nNext to him is SHERIFF HANK KEOUGH, paunch, disposition of an untipped waiter. \nKEOUGH Ask me, what an animal does in the wild is his own business so long as he doesn't do it to man.  I think Mark Twain said that. \nWALT (dry) I think he didn't.  But since you've said it, I guess we're covered. \nKeough holds a stare.  Walt drops overboard.  Keough pulls a Twinkie from his pocket.  Begins to unwrap. \nEXT. NEW YORK - MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY \nINT. MUSEUM - DAY \nFIND  KELLY SCOTT, pretty, thirty, as KEVIN CAMPBELL, forties, approaches. \nKEVIN Kelly. \nKELLY (warmly) Kevin, hey. \nShe beams affection, he exudes a little discomfort. \nKEVIN Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second? \nKELLY (great idea) Absolutely. \nINT. KEVIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nThey enter ON THE CUT, he closes the door. \nKEVIN I had a great time last night. Again. \nKELLY Me too. \nReading his look, she suddenly smells it.  Her face drops. \nKELLY (CONT'D) (deducing) That's not what you came to say. \nKEVIN You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, \"us\"... \nShe's a little crushed. \n", "test1_true": "KEVIN I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix. \nKELLY Kevin, as long as we... (suddenly) What was that last part? \nKEVIN (sheepish) The somebody else part? \nKELLY Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um... \nKEVIN (feels terrible) Else. \nA beat. \nKELLY (covering) Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, you... you're y'know... \nKEVIN (reading her mind) A jerk. \nKELLY (you have no idea) Oh... (then) No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm... (checks her watch) I actually have an early lunch, so... \nKEVIN It's ten after nine. \nKELLY Yes, well... (smiling) famished. \nAnd she rushes out of the room.  OFF Kevin, we: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNDERWATER - DAY \nWalt dives down, visibility is lousy. Whether it's algae or dense vegetation, the water is extremely murky. \nEXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS \nKeough unwraps the second Twinkie. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS \nWalt continues to swim. \nHIS P.O.V. \nNot much to look at.  Then suddenly... no, just a snapping turtle swimming away.  Walt descends a little deeper.  He loves it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere else.  Next best thing to meditation.  Suddenly, he stops kicking. \nHIS EYES FOCUS \nA black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length. \nRESUME \nWalt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look.  The snake seems unimpressed.  Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him, misses.  Shit.  Walt's look says \"what the fuck?\"  A beat.  Then the snake swims off.  Walt relaxes.  A beat.  But then... he looks around, uneasy.  He gets this feeling he's not alone down there.  Looks about, nothing but murky water.  But he's not alone, we can feel he's not alone. \nHe looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering, looking back at him.  What's with these snakes?  Walt decides he'll go back to the boat.  Then... BOOM.  Something hits him... and it's no snake. \nEXT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS \nKeough.  Oblivious.  Waiting.  Suddenly-- Walt comes thrusting up with a scream! \nWALT Sheriff!! \nAnd Walt is promptly yanked back under. \nKEOUGH Hey! \nUpon which Walt surfaces.  He swims frantically for a beat before he's suddenly yanked under again.  Then he surfaces, thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat.  He takes hold of him and pulls him on board.  Actually... what's left of him. There's nothing below the waist.  Walt is just a bleeding torso, though still conscious. \nKEOUGH (CONT'D) (going into shock) Jesus Christ. \n", "test1_id": 2949, "test2_input": "Now she looks up. \nKELLY Sorry? \nKEVIN I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I-- \nKELLY This is what we do? \nKEVIN I'd like you to check out this lake.  See-- \nKELLY Are you on drugs? \nKEVIN Kelly-- \nKELLY I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street-- \nKEVIN Part of our research-- \nKELLY I'm not even a field person. \nKEVIN Well on this one I'd like you to be. \nKelly stares back.  The nickle drops. \nKELLY This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until-- \nKEVIN It has nothing to do with-- \nKELLY I never do field work and even if I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something-- \nKEVIN Kelly-- \nKELLY I am not going to Maine.  That's ridiculous. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAINE SKIES - DAY \nA sea helicopter is sailing up against the blue sky, nothing but Evergreens and lakes below. \nINT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS \nKelly with the Pilot.  She looks a little white. \nINT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY \nKelly is walking with Keough toward the morgue. \nKEOUGH He just came up screaming. \nKELLY Did he say anything? \nKEOUGH He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead. \nKELLY And you didn't see anything? \nKEOUGH The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there. \nKELLY (seeing) There?  That's the morgue. \nKEOUGH Yes. \nKELLY Is the dead guy in there? \nKEOUGH That's where they keep them. (then) You want me to bring the tooth out here? \nKELLY Um. (bravado) No, no.  Let's go. \n", "test2_true": "Reveal-- \nINT. MORGUE - DAY \nThe Medical Examiner, STEVEN DANIELS, is there with Keough and kelly.  Walt's torso is covered.  Kelly is examining the tooth. \nKELLY I need to get a microscopic look at it. \nDANIELS Fine. (indicating) There you go. \nKELLY Maybe I should see... (the body) \nKEOUGH (reading her) I wouldn't. \nKELLY I'm fine, thank you. \nKEOUGH Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott? \nKELLY Well. (admits) At wakes. \nKEOUGH This is a little different. \nKELLY I can look at dead things. \nAnd Daniels is about to pull the sheet back-- \nKELLY (CONT'D) Wait. \nShe takes a breath. \nKELLY (CONT'D) Okay. \nAnd Daniels peels back the sheet.  Kelly strains to disguise her extreme horror.  Finally-- \nKELLY (CONT'D) (fighting off nausea) This... how long did this attack go on for? \nKEOUGH Seconds.  Three, four. \nKELLY And this is how he came to the boat? \nKEOUGH Yes. \nKELLY Okay. (then) And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit? \nOFF this, we: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. INDIGO MAINE - DAY \nIt's a small, almost tiny town; general store, post office, fire station.  Kelly and Keough are in front of the general store loading supplies into a van, across the street in front of the Sheriff's Department. \nKEOUGH Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual. \nKELLY You talk to the married couple? \nKEOUGH Not yet. \nKELLY What kind of backup do we have? \nKEOUGH We? \nThat strikes a nerve. \nKELLY (defensive) What? \n", "test2_id": 2950, "test3_input": "JACK Hector, you see anything? \nANGLE HECTOR \non the pontoon of his chopper.  He's looking about, studying the water. \nHECTOR No! \nKEOUGH (sarcastic) I just have this feeling everything's totally safe. \nHECTOR (yelling) I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank. \nAnd as Hector looks further.  Behind him... up surfaces the crocodile in all his stealth.  His head is two feet from Hector and nobody knows it.  Least of all Hector. \nHECTOR (CONT'D) I can't see him, but this is definitely blood.  Maybe you got him. \nAnd as he turns back, he sees it.  The croc comes up as Hector screams, jumps off.  Screams.  Keough leaps off the truck and charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give Hector some cover. \nHector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  He climbs in. \nKEOUGH Where is he?! \nHECTOR I don't know! \nNo sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  As he springs toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other side.  The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin and he becomes wedged.  The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes right through the chopper.  He's not completely immobilized but wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him. \nKEOUGH Hector!! \nBut now Jack has joined, rifle in hand.  Hector surfaces again, swimming for shore.  Jack runs to help him onto land. \nKEOUGH (CONT'D) (taking aim) Alright.  Game over. \nBut the croc looks feeble now.  He lets out this MOAN of DEATH. And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger. \nKEOUGH (CONT'D) (to Kelly) Should I? \nKELLY Wait. \nRESUME \nThe croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach. But there's no rage in his behavior now.  He seems desperate. He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two ton piece of metal and he's exhausted. \nKELLY I think the drugs are kicking in. \nBreathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to free himself from the mangled wreckage.  As unbelievable as that cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  A thirty foot exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  And he just cannot go on anymore. \nKelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back.  They approach with caution.  They all stare at the tired crocodile. \nANGLE THE CROC \nHe's now looking back.  Bleeding, gasping... beaten.  In his eyes... we can see it.  The beast is beaten. \nANGLE THE PRINCIPLES \nThere's no triumph.  In their eyes... sadness. \nJACK I don't think we really want to wait for him to catch his breath. \nIt continues to breathe heavily. \nKELLY He's through fighting.  Look at him. \nJACK I don't care.  Hank.  End it. \nKeough raises his cannon. \nHECTOR No.  Look.  He's got nothing left. \n", "test3_true": "Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the water, seizing Hector.  Screams.  It death rolls Hector, flings him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more. Keough blasts his Avenger.  A direct hit. \nIt takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing into the air.  It splashes down, the first head not to hit Kelly. \nThey all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore.  He's bleeding. \nHECTOR I'm okay. \nKELLY You're not okay, your leg's a mess. \nJACK Get him onto shore. \nKELLY He heeds a tourniquet. \nKeough quickly peels off his shirt.  Gives it to Kelly, who goes to work. \nKELLY (CONT'D) You're gonna be okay. \nHECTOR Guess I finally got bit. \nKELLY Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it. \nA sudden ROAR.  Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see... the big croc.  Maybe his final roar, he looks weak.  GASPING in the crashed chopper.  Jack and Keough approach. \nKEOUGH (quietly; re the big croc) He's done.  He's dying. \nJACK Don't count on it. (then) We better take him out. \nBut something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at them... nobody wants wants to take him out. \nANGLE THE CROC \nlooking back at them.  He knows he's in their hands now.  He knows. \nANGLE THE HUMANS \nA beat. \nHECTOR (quiet) Flax him under his tail.  Two hundred cc's.  Under the tail, that'll put him to sleep. \nUpon which we HEAR the SOUND of TRUCKS.  Florida Fish And Game, U.S. Wildlife, arriving on the scene. \nJACK Thank God. \nOFFICER COLSON, Florida Fish And Game, emerges, approaches. Stares with utter disbelief. \nKELLY We need to get it some medical help. (re Hector) And him too. \nBy now the Florida army has moved in.  They all stare with the same suspended disbelief. \nKEOUGH (explaining) We trapped him with our chopper. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BEACH - AN HOUR LATER \nA crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying to free it from the wreckage.  FIND the PARAMEDICS with Hector, on a stretcher.  Jack, Kelly, and Keough are there. \nPARAMEDIC We're gonna airvac him to Portland. \nKELLY Okay. (to Hector) That's where they're taking the croc, Hector, they've got some big tank there. \nHECTOR He's gonna live? \nKELLY Yeah.  Thanks to you. \n", "test3_id": 2951}

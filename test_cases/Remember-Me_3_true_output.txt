ALLY Okay. Now what? I'm supposed to just forgive you? 
A BMW 7 Series speeds around the corner. Stops in front of the house. Charles gets out of the car, sees his son. 
CHARLES How is she? 
TYLER She's sleeping. 
Diane emerges from the house. Charles strides quickly towards her. 
95   INT. BEDROOM -- LATER                                       95 
Caroline asleep in her bed. Charles stands in the doorway watching her sleep, we get the feeling he hasn't seen her asleep in some time. Diane appears at his side. 
CHARLES How long do you think she'll sleep? 
DIANE I think she'll be out for a while. Would you like to wait? 
CHARLES Thank you. I can't. I'll call her later. 
DIANE I'll tell her. 
Diane looks at Charles. He's still watching his daughter. 
96   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- CLASSROOM -- MORNING                 96 
Caroline's TEACHER prepares her lesson plan. She starts to write the date on the board when The door opens. Caroline and Tyler enter. The entire class is watching. It's dead quiet. 
Caroline puts her trembling hands in her pockets. 
Tyler looks at a few of the girls. They look back, unconcerned, almost amused. Tyler walks his sister to her desk. 
TYLER (to Caroline, whispering) You okay? 
Caroline nods, although her eyes are brimming. As she slips out of her jacket, the contents of her pockets clatter noisily to the floor. Tyler immediately bends to help her. 
MEAN GIRL Have you done something different with your hair? I love it! 
SNICKERING LAUGHTER. Caroline looks like a deer in headlights. 
TEACHER Okay, okay. Enough. 
Tyler moves towards an EMPTY DESK. Some girls keep snickering. Suddenly, Tyler grabs the desk. THROWS it through the air. 
97    INT. HALLWAY -- SIMULTANEOUS                                 97 
A JANITOR pushes a flat broom down the empty corridor when the glass from one of the classroom doors explodes as the desk makes impact. He stops pushing the broom and stares. 
98    INT. CLASSROOM -- LATER                                      98 
Pin-drop silence. The students sit paralyzed. Tyler stares at the Mean Girl. Her arrogance completely gone. Caroline stares up at her brother, awestruck. 
99    INT. HOLDING CELL -- LATER                                   99 
TYLER locked up among CRACK HEADS and PETTY CROOKS on a dirty bench with his hands behind his head and a bemused smirk. A BAILIFF approaches the holding cell. Looks at Tyler. 
BAILIFF You posted. 
100   INT. NYPD PRECINCT -- LATER                              100 
Charles standing in the waiting area. Tyler is led out by the bailiff rubbing his wrists. He sees his father, his face registering surprise. 
Beat. 
The men walk together towards the exit in silence. Neither looking at the other. 
CHARLES Destruction of private property and felony trespassing. 
TYLER I didn't call you. 
CHARLES I know you didn't. 
Charles stops. 
CHARLES I have unleashed a raging shitstorm of epic proportions on the board of trustees of that pissant school that will not abate until those girls seek enrollment elsewhere. I give them a week. 
Beat. 
CHARLES I know you think I'm a prick, but I have my uses. 
Guess so. 
CHARLES Can you come by the office to talk to the lawyers? 
Beat. Tyler deciding.

He shakes his head and locks away from her, wondering about himself: 
GRAHAM Molly. (pause) I love you. And I'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile... 
They are both frozen: in the same room but very separate. Molly's eyes are moist. She gets up and leaves. Graham sits at the kitchen table by himself, both hands around his mug of coffee. Slowly, deliberately, he picks up the mug to take a sip. Then he sits alone in the kitchen. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BALTIMORE AIRPORT - GRAHAM - DAY On a pay phone to Dr. Bloom. 
GBAHAM Sidney: I don't understand him. We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming' ...but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming. (beat) The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me. why the mirrors? 
BLOOM (V.O.) The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them. I don't have an answer for you. (beat) Listen to me, my friend: leave this. 
GRAHAM And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home? (beat) This ends when I make it over. 
BLOOM (V.O.) How are Molly and the boy? 
GRAHAM Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana. (beat) Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...! 
Sidney Bloom has no answer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BALTIMORE AIRPORT, COFFEE SHOP - WINDOW - LATE AFTERNOON 
Outside is gray. Rain stripes the glass. Sheets of rain whip across the silver planes and yellow utility vehicles. 
CLOSE: WINDOW 
Graham's hand enters and flattens against his half-reflection on the cool glass. He hears: 
VALERIE LEEDS (V.O.) (ansaphone recording ) 'Hello. This is Valerie Leeds. I'm sorry I can't come to the phone right now ... 
GRAHAM I'm sorry, too... 
WAITRESS Excuse me...? 
Graham turns. The WAITRESS looks at him strangely. 
GRAHAM Coffee ... 
She leaves. Graham sits. He stares at his handprint and says : 
GRAHAM It's just YOU and me now, sport. And I'd better hurry up and find you. (beat) Because I'm losing all this... 
CUT TD: 
INT. DARKROOM - DOLLABHYDE - NIGHT 
Entering. It is almost totally dark. In the green dullness we make our the forms of a WOMAN and Dollarhyde. 
DOLLARHYDE Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock. 
REBA (WOMAN) Put your back against the doer. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile an your feet and there will be a stool just to your left. 
We see Dollarhyde's form follow instructions and sit. 
REBA Can you give me an idea of the conditions... 
DOLLARHYDE Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights. 
REBA What's being photographed? 
DOLLARHYDE The activities of nocturnal animals. 
REBA When do you need it? 
DOLLARHYDE In eight days. 
REBA Let me stick this in the black hole. 
We see some movements. Then the light comes on. 
DOLLARHYDE'S 
hand is curled under his nose, hiding his Z-plast scars. Then he reacts to something. His face lights up in an uncharacteristically open smile. 
He brazenly looks the woman up and down. We don't understand why he can do this. 
REBA McCLAIN 
is blind. Her white cane is propped in the corner. She's thirty with a handsome prairie face. 
REBA The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code . (beat) It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do? 
DOLLARHYDE It'll do fine. 
RALPH DANDRIDGE, 
young manager of the department enters, checks watch. 
DANDRIDGE Reba, dear, I've got to fly. (beat) Mr. Dollarhyde, if it wouldn't be too much trouble could you help her home ? 
REBA I can 'help' myself home, Ralph...

{"test1_input": "STACY Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar. \nLINDA I know. \nThey watch her pass. \nLINDA (CONT'D) Actually, there are three girls at Ridgemont who have cultivated the Pat Benatar look. \nLinda gestures out on lunch court. \nANGLE ON ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKE \nwearing pink spandex pants and short-cropped black hair with dark lipstick. \nANGLE ON STILL ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKE \nwearing blue spandex pants and short black hair. She stands a good distance away from the other two. \nLINDA (CONT'D) None of them talk to each other. \nLinda looks at them with bemusement but Stacy is wondering. \nSTACY Do you think guys find that attractive? \nLINDA Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them. \nThey sit and eat their lunches. Linda has her perennial diet lunch of yogurt and raw vegetables. \nSTACY Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed. \nLINDA What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't. \nSTACY No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at. \nLINDA What variables? \nSTACY (shyly) Like, you know, giving blow jobs. \nLINDA What's the big deal? \nSTACY Well I never did it. \nLINDA There's nothing to it. \nShe takes out a carrot stick and eases it down her throat. Stacv tries one but chokes. \nLINDA (CONT'D) You just have to practice a little first. (feels her throat) Relax these muscles. Think of your throat as an open tunnel. \nThe girls try sliding the carrot sticks down their throats without gagging. \nANGLE ON A BOY \nat the next table; sees them and points them out to his companions. \nSTACY What happens... don't laugh at me, but when a guy has an orgasm... you know, like, how much comes out. \nStacy stops practicing and looks horrified. Linda laughs. \nLINDA Just kidding. About 10cc. \nSTACY (enlightened) Oh! That's where that group got its name from. \nThey continue practicing as the boys look on. Stacy manages to get almost a whole carrot down her throat to Linda's amazement. \nThe group of boys break out in applause. \nStacy looks very embarrassed. \nINT. BIOLOGY LAB - DAY \nThe class is situated so that all students sit at Bunson burner tables lining the room. \nPat is seated at one of the tables and Stacy takes a seat nearby; she looks at the ledge in front of her. It contains a pig embryo. She listens to the conversation next to her. \nGIRL STUDENT I'll tell you right now. I'm not going. I'll get sick or something. I'm not going into a room with a bunch of dead guys. \nARNOLD You'll go. It's part of the final. \nGIRL STUDENT (a Pat Benatar) Have you heard what they do? I'm serious. Have you heard? \nBOY STUDENT What? \nARNOLD The bodies are dissected, Mike, and Mr. Vargas pulls out parts of the dead body and holds them up. Okay? \nBOY STUDENT You mean he reaches in and pulls this stuff out? \nGIRL STUDENT Yes. \n", "test1_true": "GIRL STUDENT Hearts, lungs, guts... \nStacy strains to hear more, just as Mr. Vargas -- a diminutive man holding a coffee mug -- enters the class. \nMR. VARGAS Good day, everyone! I just switched to Sanka. I'm running a little slow today, so have a heart. \nANGLE ON THE RAT \nHe is riveted on Stacy Hamilton, swooning. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWe see Stacy's room, a young girl's room with posters and frilly pillows. Stacy is in bed, and her Mother is just leaving the room. \nMOTHER Sleep tight, Stacy. \nSTACY Good night, Mom. \nHer Mother shuts off the light, exits. Stacy pulls back the covers. She is fully dressed. \nEXT. STACY'S WINDOW - NIGHT \nWe see the window to Stacy's room slide slowly open, and watch her slip outside. She hikes down a drainage pipe to the street. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT \nA brown MG pulls up. Stacy jumps from the shadows and hops in. The car drives away. \nINT. RON'S CAR - NIGHT \nRon sits behind the wheel, humming casually along to the music on his car stereo. \nRon has on a light-brown leather jacket. He looks like a contestant for \"The Dating Game.\" \nSTACY (a little nervous) Thanks for picking me up. \nRON No problem. \nHe speeds off, turning up the radio to sing along. \nRON (CONT'D) 'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.' (eyes Stacy) You look nice tonight. \nSTACY Thanks. So do you. \nRON Where do you feel like going? \nSTACY I don't know. Wherever you want. \nRON How about the point? \nSTACY (nervously) The point sounds fine. \nRON (looks at her knowingly) All right, the point it is. \nWe see Stacy's anxious face, as the car speeds up Ridgemont Drive, with music. \nEXT. THE POINT - NIGHT \nStacy and Ron sit in the car, listening to music. The \"point\" is a natural lookout spot that lovers can \"discover.\" It is behind the baseball field and dugout of Ridgemont High School. \nStacy and Ron get out of the car and walk to the baseball dugout. \nINT. DUGOUT - NIGHT \nThey sit side-by-side. Above them, a single light bulb shines a very private fifty watts on things. \nSTACY That's a nice shirt. \nRON Thanks. Thanks a lot. \nSilence. They look at each other, look away. \nRON (CONT'D) It's very warm out tonight. \nSTACY It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last? \nRon leans over and kisses Stacy lightly on the cheek. Stacy sits quietly for a moment, thinking, was that the first move? Then she lunges at Ron and kisses him square on the mouth. At first surprised, Ron then holds her there and kisses her in return. After a time, he breaks away. \nRON Are you really nineteen? \nSTACY Yes... I am really nineteen. \nThey continue making out. \n", "test1_id": 336, "test2_input": "We see Stacy Hamilton, once again, at the cash register wearing an Assistant manager name tag and a hostess gown. She handles a customer's bill, then stands there a moment, looking glum. Linda Barrett approaches. \nSTACY Another summer of working at Swenson's. \nLINDA Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open. \nSTACY You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex. \nLINDA What do you want? \nSTACY I want romance. \nLINDA Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV. \nANGLE ON \nthe back kitchen door, which swings open, and out comes Mike Damone in a peppermint Swenson's shirt. He wipes some grime on his pants. \nSTACY Mike! You have a mess on C-9! \nDAMONE All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break. \nSTACY Get going. \nThe two girls smile, go back to their posts. \nINT. JEFF SPICOLI'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJeff Spicoli sits in his room, and it is his castle. Clothes lie in disarray on the floor. A huge half-waxed surfboard is propped against the window. We see Spicoli dressed in a too large white short-sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's fat paisley tie. He stops to take a hit from his bong, all the while talking on the phone. The music of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Freebird\" plays on the radio. \nSPICOLI I... am... so... wasted, mon. What is in this shit? (pause) Doesn't that stuff cause brain damage? (pause) Bitchin'. \nSpicoli listens for a moment. He rubs his eyes, shakes his head. He is really buzzed. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Hey, mon, I am going to Mexico as soon as school is out. Two more weeks, bud. Week from Wednesday. (pause) I am gonna take both boards, my duck feet, many cases of beer, and just jam. (pause) No, mon, from school. I'm leaving as soon as school gets out. I'll be at Sunset Cliffs by nighttime. (pause) Totally. (pause) Later. \nSpicoli hangs up, and concentrates on tying his tie. He almost strangles himself. Then suddenly the door to his room flies open and Spicoli's little brother Curtis bursts in. \nCURTIS Jeff you have company! \nSPICOLI Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you. \nCurtis slams the door and leaves. A moment later there is a knock. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) That's better. Come in. \nThe door swings open and Jeff Spicoli sits in stoned shock at the sight before him. There, standing in the doorway of his room is Mr. Hand. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Mr... Mr. Hand. \nMR. HAND That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in? \nSpicoli can only nod. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) (calling downstairs) Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Spicoli. \nHand walks into Spicoli's room, takes off his suit jacket and lays it on the chair back. He stops a moment and catches the stare of Miss January Penthouse on the wall, then turns to Spicoli. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff? \nSPICOLI Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year. \nMR. HAND I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff. \nSPICOLI Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand? \nHand removes several copies of Oui Magazine from another chair and sits down. He sets his briefcase on Spicoli's dresser, next to a bag of pot, and opens it up for easy access. \nMR. HAND Do you want to sit there, Jeff? \nSPICOLI I don't know. I guess so. \nMR. HAND Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here. (pause) As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson. \nMr. Hand takes a sheet from his briefcase and looks at it. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) According to my calculations, Mr. Spicoli, you wasted a total of eight hours of my time this year. And rest assured that is a kind estimate. \nHe returns the sheet to his case and looks into Spicoli's weed-ravaged eyes. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty. \nSPICOLI Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand. \nMR. HAND Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you. \nHand reaches in his case and produces the book. He hands it to Spicoli. \n", "test2_true": "INT. SPICOLI'S ROOM - HOURS LATER \nWearily, Spicoli is trying to grasp the material. \nSPICOLI ... so, like, when Jefferson went before the people what he was saying was 'Hey, we left this place in England because it was bogus, and if we don't come up with some cool rules ourself, we'll be bogus, too!' Right? \nANGLE ON MR. HAND \nwho nods his head. \nMR. HAND Very close, Jeff. \nHand reaches over and gets his case. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) I think I've made my point with you tonight. \nSPICOLI Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question? \nMR. HAND What's that? \nSPICOLI Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff? \nMR. HAND Well, you'll find out next year. \nSPICOLI (smiling) No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building. \nMR. HAND If you graduate. \nSPICOLI (panicked) You're gonna flunk me?! \nMr. Hand pauses a moment, then breaks into the nearest approximation of a grin we have seen all year. It isn't much, but it's noticeable. His lips crinkle at the ends. \nMR. HAND Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by. \nSPICOLI All right! Oh, yeah! \nMr. Hand has now gathered all his material, and he stands to approach Spicoli's door. Jeff jumps up, extends his hand. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Aloha, Mr. Hand! \nMR. HAND Aloha, Spicoli. \nMr. Hand exits the room, and descends the staircase of the Spicoli household. Spicoli kicks the door shut, grins, and continues struggling with his tie. \nINT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM - NIGHT \nTight angle on the emotion-filled face of the lead singer in a cheesy high school band called the T Birds. He is bathed in a blue light, singing the last verse of The Eagles' 'Take It To The Limit'. \nWe pull back to reveal a large, clumsy banner reading: LAST DANCE. Students are pouring into the gym for this event. Many have brought their annual yearbooks. On stage, the lead singer snaps his fingers and the band goes into Nick Lowe's 'Heart of the City'. Some students start to dance. \nEvery one of our characters is either here, or about to arrive. From Charles Jefferson to Spicoli to Mr. Hand. For once, all classes are partying together. But, just as in the beginning of the year on lunch court, the kids are still cordoned off into their distinctive cliques. \nANGLE ON MORE STUDENTS ARRIVING \nat the Last Dance. They see Mr. Hand signing annuals by the door. They all say the same thing as they pass, \"Aloha, Mr. Hand\". He nods in return. \nANGLE ON STACY \nsurveying the growing mob of annual-crazed students. From behind her comes Linda Barrett in a low-cut black dress. \nSTACY Where's Doug? \nLINDA He's not coming. \nSTACY Not coming? What happened? \nLINDA He says he's got to stay in Chicago. (sighs) He says I should visit him sometimes. \nSTACY Sometime? \nLINDA Yeah, like maybe never. \nSTACY But what are you going to do? \nLINDA Well I might go to Dartmouth. \nSTACY Dartmouth?! \nLINDA I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it. \nSTACY I can't believe it! But what about Doug? \nLINDA (STOIC) There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them. \nSTACY Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss. \n", "test2_id": 337, "test3_input": "ANGLE ON MIKE DAMONE \nin another part of the dance, by the Junior class sponsored food counter. Damone is standing, talking to several girls, gesturing and being Damone, Mr. Attitude. \nDAMONE Sign my annual, honey. \nThe girls look at each other, laugh. They walk away. \nANGLE ON THE RAT \nstanding nearby. \nTHE RAT You're losing it, Damone. \nDAMONE You're crazy. Those girls love me. \nANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI \nsprawled out in the bleachers with his surfer stoner buddies. He turns to one admiring stoner (Todd). \nSPICOLI Hey, mon. Sign my annual. \nSpicoli slips the annual into the kid's crotch. The stoner winces in pain, but still opens the book and lingers on all the signings in Spicoli's annual. They are all drug-related messages from fellow stoners. After a moment, Spicoli's friend signs: \"Thanks for the reds. Todd.\" \nTODD Hey, mon, good thing we're going to Mexico this summer. 'Cause you're gonna get kicked out of your house when your parents read your annual. \nINT. GYMNASIUM - ANGLE ON DOOR \nBrad Hamilton pushes both doors open, and makes his entrance into the Last Dance. There is a lot of activity going on, but all nearby eyes turn to Brad as he walks into the dance. Fifteen kids immediately gravitate towards him. They all want Brad to sign their annuals, to talk about the 7-11 incident. Onstage, the T-Birds play the Beatles' \"It Won't Be Long\". \nWe see Brad's old girlfriend Lisa push up to him. Her new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm around her. \nLISA I saw your picture in the paper. You had the greatest look on your face! \nANOTHER STUDENT Front of the Metro Section. I'm telling my parents, 'I know this guy, I know this guy.' \nLisa's boyfriend pulls his arm tighter around her. \nLISA Will you sign my annual, Brad? \nBrad smiles, nods. He signs, and gives her his. We then see Brad's three Buddies from Carl's Jr. come up, pat him on the back and grab his shoulder. Brad studies them warily. \nBUDDY #1 Fuckin' manager of 7-11! \nBUDDY #2 Get us jobs over there, Brad! You can do it! \nBRAD Since when do you guys want to work at 7-11? \nBUDDY #2 Come on, Brad! It would be great! All of us together! \nBRAD Well, 7-11 is a tremendous operation. It's really changed, man. They've got great food, great magazines, videogames... it's class. Total class. \nBUDDY #3 As soon as you can get us in there, we're gone from Carl's, Brad. \nBUDDY #2 Yeah, man, all the little punks from junior high have taken over the place. \nBrad leaves his old buddies. He grins and notices someone across the crowded dance floor. \nBRAD Hey, Thompson! Wendell! Get a job! \nThey laugh, flip him off. Brad is back in his element at last. He moves into the main dancing area, works his way across the room, past the bleachers, when he hears a voice. \nSPICOLI (O.S.) Hamilton! \nBrad turns around, seen Spicoli sitting on the bottom rung of the bleachers. Spicoli looks back with true respect. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Awesome. \nHe throws Brad his annual. Brad gives him his. They sign. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Easy, mon. \nBRAD Later. \nANGLE ON THE BLEACHERS \nwhere several couples are passionately making out. Four teachers clomp up into the stands from different angles. They pin the couples in flashlight beams, like the main tower pinning an escaping prisoner. \nANGLE ON THE T-BIRDS \nonstage, singing the Rolling Stones' \"I'm Free\". \nEXT. GYNMASIUM - NIGHT \nWe see Jeff Spicoli leave the dance and come backing down the stairs with a stoner bud. His fist is in the air. \nSPICOLI Summer, mon! We're there! \n", "test3_true": "SPICOLI (CONT'D) Let's roll, my man. \nSpicoli backs right into a young buzz-cut kid. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Hey, bud! Watch yourselff \nSpicoli turns around to see he's backed into a squad of eight Lincoln Surf Nazis. They are all standing on the steps, waiting. \nSURF NAZI Are you Jeff Spicoli? \nSpicoli looks up and down the row of Surf Nazis. On the end, he sees L.C. \nL.C. That's him! He did it! \nSPICOLI Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but... \nSpicoli dashes off down Luna Street. L.C. and the Surf Nazis take out in hot pursuit, chasing him through the parking lot, past Ridgemont High, and into the night. They will never catch him. \nSLOW DISSOLVE: \nINT. RIDGEMONT MALL \nSchool is out and it's summer business as usual at the Ridgemont Mall. We see the same stores, the same packs of kids roaming the three tiers. \nANGLE ON MARK RATNER \nwho stands against the railing in his Cinema Four jacket, gazing across the mall at Swenson's Ice Cream Parlor. He sees Stacy walk two girlfriends to the outdoor front tables, and almost look his way. The Rat turns away suddenly. Then he hears her calling out after him. \nSTACY Hey Mark! Turn around! \nRatner turns around, affects total and complete cool. He waves across the mall to her. \nSTACY (CONT'D) Come over here! \nHe looks back at his post at the theatre, decides it's okay to step away. He walks across the mall. \nINT. SWENSON'S \nStacy is standing by the sundae bar. Next to her are two empty stools. After a moment, we see The Rat plop onto one of the metal stools. He pounds the seat next to him with the palm of his hand. \nTHE RAT You. Sit. \nStacy turns to look at him, smiles. She sits. \nSTACY Hi, Mark. \nTHE RAT Hi, Stacy. How are you? \nSTACY I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year. \nThe Rat maintains The Attitude. \nTHE RAT Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual. \nSTACY I know everybody says it, but I really mean it. \nThe Rat looks at her from the corner of his eyes. \nTHE RAT Really? \nSTACY Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer. \nShe withdraws a picture from her pocket, hands it to The Rat. \nTHE RAT Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around... (breaks down, takes picture) But I'll give you a call sometime. \nSTACY I'd like that. \nShe gives him a kiss on the mouth, gets up and walks away. The Rat sits there, smiling at the way things sometimes turn out. He slips the picture into his pocket, a satisfied young man. \nINT./EXT. SWENSON'S AND MALL \nThe Rat is joined by Mike Damone, who has changed into his street clothes. \nDAMONE She wants it, Rat. \nThe Rat snickers, shakes his head. \nDAMONE (CONT'D) I saw you.

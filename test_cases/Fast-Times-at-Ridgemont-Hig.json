{"train": "Fast Times at Ridgemont High \nFADE IN: \nEXT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL - NIGHT \nFrom the outside parking lot it looks like an enormous beached whale. It is the prime hangout for all the teenagers in the area. Kids mill around the parking lot or stand by the mall entrance. \nINT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL \nThere are three levels of stores underneath a massive fluorescent roof. Different music comes from each store. It looks seventies-modern, but already used and run-down. Groups of kids cruise the mall, eyeing each other and acting cool. \nINT. SWENSON'S ICE-CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT \nThe teenage waitresses in their peppermint pattie uniforms are rushing around, trying to keep up with their orders. \nA good-looking man in his mid-twenties enters and sits. He wears a plastic name tag that says: \"Pacific Stereo Audio Consultant, RON JOHNSON.\" \nTwo Swenson's Waitresses pass by with supreme indifference, and take their orders into the back kitchen. \nINT. SWENSON'S BACK KITCHEN \nWAITRESS #1 I think he looks like Richard Gere. \nThe two Waitresses discuss the issue at hand. One of them, Linda Barrett, is the seventeen year old, retired sex queen of Ridgemont High. \nWAITRESS #1 (CONT'D) I think he looks like... Richard Gere. (Bruce Springsteen) \nLINDA Did you see his cute little butt? \nA third waitress enters. \nWAITRESS #2 Let's talk about C-19. \nWAITRESS #1 AND LINDA We were! \nWAITRESS #2 I think I'll drop over and change the shakers. \nLINDA No, be cool, that's Stacy's section. \nThrough the entrance, we see Stacy Hamilton. She is the fifteen-year-old trainee, sweet-looking with just the last traces of baby fat. She puts down a glass of water for Ron, spills some and mops it up. \nWAITRESS #1 He's too old for Stacy, she hasn't even started high school yet. \nA flustered Stacy enters the back kitchen. \nLINDA How's it going. \nSTACY Do you think that guy's cute? \nWAITRESS #1 In a blow-dryed kind of way. \nSTACY Does anyone else want to take his table? \nLINDA Don't you like him? \nSTACY Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really. \nLINDA Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man. \nSTACY What should I do? \nLINDA Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot. \nShe fluffs up Stacy's hair and gently shoves her towards the door. Stacy reluctantly exits. \nINT. SWENSON'S DINING ROOM \nStacy goes to Ron's table. \nRON So you working hard or hardly working? \nStacy thinks it over, decides it's a joke and laughs (a little too late). Ron looks at her soulfully. \nRON (CONT'D) You look like you could still be in high school. \nSTACY I know, everyone says that. \nHe stares at her and she stares back uncomfortably. \nSTACY (CONT'D) What can I get for you tonight. \nRON How about your phone number? \nStacy smiles nervously. \nINT. RIDGEMONT MALL - OUTSIDE SWENSON'S - NIGHT \ngrumbling, putting shirts back on. It pains them. \nDennis heads back to his office when he sees something in the trash bin. \nDENNIS Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton? \nBRAD They were left over from the last shift. \nDENNIS Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton. (glares at Brad) Perfectly good. \nBRAD But they weren't mine. \nBrad laughs, goes back to work. \nINT. MALL - LATE NIGHT \nIt is closed and only a few janitors remain. Stacy and Linda walk through the large empty mall. \nSTACY He gave me his card. (lovingly) 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.' \nLINDA (amused) Should we buy a frame for that? \nSTACY Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week? \nLINDA Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call. \nSTACY So what did you do? \nLINDA I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him. \nSTACY I can't do that. \nThey pass a janitor cleaning graffiti that says: LINCOLN SURF NAZIS and MAGGOT LUST FOR THE DUST. \nLINDA Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies. \nSTACY Really? \nLINDA Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will. \nSTACY (cute) He was hot, wasn't he? \nLINDA If I didn't have a fiance in Chicago, I'd go for it. \nA young Girl runs and catches up with Linda and Stacy. \nGIRL (breathless) Are you Linda Barrett? \nLINDA Yes. \nGIRL I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something. \nLinda nods. \nGIRL (CONT'D) I have this situation with my boyfriend, and I wanted to... (looks at Stacy, then whispers in Linda's ear) \nLinda listens thoughtfully, then clicks into her \"sex expert\" mode. \nLINDA Okay, are you over sixteen? \nThe Girl nods. \nLINDA (CONT'D) All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly - several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's. \nGIRL And they don't call my parents? \nLINDA Not if you're over sixteen. \nGIRL Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda. \nLINDA And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either. \nThe Girl thanks Linda again. Linda and Stacy get to the back exit of the mall and Linda uses a key to open the door. \nSTACY I can't believe I start high school tomorrow. \nLINDA Believe it. \nThey exit the mall, into the night. \nEXT. RIDGEMONT SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nWe see all the elements of the first day of school. The students carry new books, explore new lockers, begin to stake out their ground. \nSomeone has taken the steel letters from the green vanguard out front. It reads: \"IDG MON SENOR HI HO.\" \nThe rest of Ridgemont High is covered with toilet paper. And a black spray paint message along the side of the front office building reads, \"LINCOLN SURF NAZIS.\" \nRICH (as soon as she is gone) Your sister is really turning into a fox. \nBRAD You should see her in the morning. \nBRAD'S BUDDIES Hey-yooooooooooo. \nINT. U.S. HISTORY CLASS - DAY \nStacy barely slips in the door before the final attendance bell sounds. She finds a seat just as the teacher's cubicle door opens at the back of the classroom. A tall figure comes barreling down the aisle. He is Mr. Hand. The man makes a double-speed step to the door at the front of the class, kicks the door shut and locks it. The windows rattle in their frames. Stacy watches, wide-eyed, at her first high school class. \nMR. HAND Aloha. My name is Mr. Hand. \nMr. Hand writes his name on the green chalkboard before his class. Every letter is a small explosion of chalk. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) (almost sweetly) I have but one question for you on our first morning 'together.' (pause) Can you attend my class? Pakalo?... Understand?... History has proven us one basic fact. Man does not do anything that is not for his own good. It is for your own good that you attend my class. And if you can't make it... I can make you. \nAn impatient knock begins at the front door of the classroom. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) We have a twenty-question quiz every Friday. It will cover all the material we've dealt with during the week. There will be no make-up exams. It's important that you all have your Land of Truth and Liberty textbooks by Wednesday. At the latest. \nThe knock continues. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Your grade is the average of all your quizzes, plus the midterm and final, which counts for one-third. Got it? \nThe mystery knocker tries a lazy calypso beat on the front door. No one in Mr. Hand's U.S. History class dares mention it, much less answer it. \nStacy grips her desk with the tension of her first day. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Also. There will be no eating in this class. You get used to doing your own business on your own time. That's one demand I make. I don't like staying after class with you on detention. That's my time. I don't like wasting it. Just like you wouldn't want me to come to your house some evening and discuss U.S. History on your time. Pakalo? \nHand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the sound at the door and opens the door an inch. Jeffrey Spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes glistening. His long, blond hair is still wet and streaming down the back of his white peasant shirt. He grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as attendance bells. A Student sitting near Stacy turns to his friends. \nSTUDENT That guy has been stoned since the third grade. \nMR. HAND Yes? \nSPICOLI Yeah. I'm registered for this class. \nMR. HAND What class? \nSPICOLI This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window. \nMR. HAND (appears enthralled) Really? \nSpicoli holds his red ad card up to the crack in the door. \nSPICOLI Can I come in? \nMR. HAND (swinging door open) Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here. \nSpicoli laughs. He is the only one. \nSPICOLI Sorry I'm late. This new schedule is totally confusing. \nMr. Hand takes the red ad card and reads from it with utter fascination. \nMR. HAND Mr. Spicoli? \nSPICOLI That's the name they gave me. \nMr. Hand slowly tears the card into little pieces and sprinkles the pieces over his wastebasket. Spicoli watches in disbelief. His hands are frozen in the process of removing his backpack. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) You just ripped my card in two! \nMR. HAND Yes. \nSPICOLI Hey, bud. What's your problem? \nMr. Hand moves to within inches of Spicoli's face. \nMR. HAND No problem at all. I think you know where the front office is. \nIt takes a moment for the words to work their way out of Jeff Spicoli's mouth. \nSPICOLI You... dick. \nIn the tense moment that follows, no one in the class is sure what might happen. \nMr. Hand simply turns away from Jeff Spicoli as if he ceased to exist and coolly continues his lecture. \nMR. HAND I've taken the time to print up a complete schedule of class quizzes, and the chapters they cover. Please pass them back to the desks behind you... \nHand begins passing out stacks of purple mimeographed sheets. \nANGLE ON STUDENTS \nall smelling the purple mimeographed sheets. \nSTACY Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar. \nLINDA I know. \nThey watch her pass. \nLINDA (CONT'D) Actually, there are three girls at Ridgemont who have cultivated the Pat Benatar look. \nLinda gestures out on lunch court. \nANGLE ON ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKE \nwearing pink spandex pants and short-cropped black hair with dark lipstick. \nANGLE ON STILL ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKE \nwearing blue spandex pants and short black hair. She stands a good distance away from the other two. \nLINDA (CONT'D) None of them talk to each other. \nLinda looks at them with bemusement but Stacy is wondering. \nSTACY Do you think guys find that attractive? \nLINDA Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them. \nThey sit and eat their lunches. Linda has her perennial diet lunch of yogurt and raw vegetables. \nSTACY Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed. \nLINDA What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't. \nSTACY No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at. \nLINDA What variables? \nSTACY (shyly) Like, you know, giving blow jobs. \nLINDA What's the big deal? \nSTACY Well I never did it. \nLINDA There's nothing to it. \nShe takes out a carrot stick and eases it down her throat. Stacv tries one but chokes. \nLINDA (CONT'D) You just have to practice a little first. (feels her throat) Relax these muscles. Think of your throat as an open tunnel. \nThe girls try sliding the carrot sticks down their throats without gagging. \nANGLE ON A BOY \nat the next table; sees them and points them out to his companions. \nSTACY What happens... don't laugh at me, but when a guy has an orgasm... you know, like, how much comes out. \nStacy stops practicing and looks horrified. Linda laughs. \nLINDA Just kidding. About 10cc. \nSTACY (enlightened) Oh! That's where that group got its name from. \nThey continue practicing as the boys look on. Stacy manages to get almost a whole carrot down her throat to Linda's amazement. \nThe group of boys break out in applause. \nStacy looks very embarrassed. \nINT. BIOLOGY LAB - DAY \nThe class is situated so that all students sit at Bunson burner tables lining the room. \nPat is seated at one of the tables and Stacy takes a seat nearby; she looks at the ledge in front of her. It contains a pig embryo. She listens to the conversation next to her. \nGIRL STUDENT I'll tell you right now. I'm not going. I'll get sick or something. I'm not going into a room with a bunch of dead guys. \nARNOLD You'll go. It's part of the final. \nGIRL STUDENT (a Pat Benatar) Have you heard what they do? I'm serious. Have you heard? \nBOY STUDENT What? \nARNOLD The bodies are dissected, Mike, and Mr. Vargas pulls out parts of the dead body and holds them up. Okay? \nBOY STUDENT You mean he reaches in and pulls this stuff out? \nGIRL STUDENT Yes. \nRON I think I better take you home. \nSTACY What about those other guys you live with? \nRON No. I mean back to your home. \nBut they make no moves in any direction. They continue making out. Ron begins unbuttoning her blouse and massaging Stacy's breasts. A moment later, he tugs at her pants. Awkwardly, she starts to help him. He tilts her backward onto the concrete dugout bench. They kiss feverishly, her hand pulling off her shoes, then her pants. Ron goes to work. \nRON (CONT'D) (whispers) Is this your first time? \nSTACY Yes. \nSTACY'S POINT OF VIEW \nas she feels a man enter her for the first time, we see the graffiti above her: Surf Nazis Lincoln was here --  Sieg Heil Led Zeppelin Dan y Roberto (Disco Fags) \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SCHOOL LOCKERS - DAY \nStacy is standing by her locker, twirling the combination. She is joined by Linda Barrett. \nLINDA Was it great? \nSTACY It was okay. \nI LINDA You'll always remember your first time. \nSTACY It was nice. \nLINDA So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious? \nSTACY Come on, Linda. It's just sex. \nLINDA Hey! That's my line! \nThey both laugh and walk down the hall. \nEXT. HAMILTON HOME - LATE AFTERNOON \nStacy arrives home. The Hamilton home has that anonymous prepackaged tract look, like many others in this lower-middle class neighborhood. \nBrad washes his car in the driveway and listens to the car radio. \nBRAD Mom says to clean up the pool. \nSTACY Why can't you do it? \nBRAD Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up. \nSTACY Your friends use the pool too. \nBRAD I take out the garbage. \nSTACY Don't strain yourself. \nStacy bristles, and heads inside the front door. \nINT. HAMILTON LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nThe furniture in the Hamilton living room looks like it was gleaned for a sale at Pic 'N Save. Through the living room, one can see a very small, kidney-shaped pool. \nStacy checks an erasable telephone message sheet near the refrigerator. There are two names on it: BRAD/STACY. Brad's side is filled with messages. Stacy's is empty. \nShe notices a summer bouquet floral arrangement. Stacy reads the attached note. It reads: \"Memories of You, Ron Johnson.\" She quickly gathers it up and carries it back outside. She fans the door several times to dispel the odor. \nEXT. HAMILTON DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON \nSTACY Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this? \nBRAD They're not home yet. \nSTACY Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work? \nBRAD I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson? \nSTACY I'll explain everything later. \nBrad nods, as Stacy pushes the flowers into his arms. \nINT. DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON \nDamone expertly fills two glasses three-quarters full of Kahlua, then adds a few drops of milk. Music is playing on a nearby speaker. Damone hands The Rat a drink and checks himself out in his mirror. \nDAMONE See that moustache coming in, Rat? \nThere is only a hint of peach fuzz, but he grooms it anyway. \nINT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOON \nStacy and Linda are enjoying a brief lull in the Christmas season madness. They sit at the sundae bar. Stacy looks forlorn, almost red-eyed, as she makes a sundae. \nLINDA You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy. \nSTACY I think Christmas brings out the worst in people. \nLINDA I guess Ron hasn't called yet. \nSTACY Not since November. \nLinda nods her head, always the coach. \nLINDA Stacy, it doesn't look good for the relationship. \nStacy continues making her ice cream, slapping the scoops onto the stainless steel dish. \nSTACY (sighs) Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen? \nLINDA Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on. \nANGLE ON GREGG AND CINDY \nwho are seated at a back table, feeding each other. \nStacy looks at her finished sundae. \nSTACY I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out. \nLINDA Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday. \nSTACY Thanks a lot. \nLinda punches Stacy lightly on the shoulder. \nLINDA Hey -- Ron Johnson? It's his loss. \nWe follow Stacy, as she walks into the dining room to serve the sundae. \nINT. WHEREHOUSE RECORDS - MALL - DAY \nWe see a group of buzz-cut young toughs, walking in formation, hunched over, sneering and wearing sleeveless U.S. Army fatigue jackets. None of these damaged-looking kids is over the age of fourteen. They pass to reveal this legend on their backs: LINCOLN SURF NAZIS. \nAngle on Mike Damone and Mark Ratner, who are standing by the upcoming concert list posted on the door to Wherehouse Records. Damone sees the Surf Nazis pass, turns to Mark Ratner, who is still wearing his Cinema Four jacket. \nDAMONE The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith. \nTHE RAT I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now. \nDAMONE There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall. \nDamone is approached by a couple of young ticket Customers. \nCUSTOMER #1 Got any Blue Oyster Cult tickets? \nDAMONE No Cult. I ate twenty-four pairs of Blue Oyster Cult tickets last time around. I was this close to working at 7-11. No Cult. \nSuddenly we see all ticket business stop. Damone and his customers see someone menacingly coming directly for them. The small crowd parts as Charles Jefferson, football duffel bag in hand, walks up. With him is a thick, tough, miniature version of himself. This is Little Charles. They both stop in front of Damone. \nJEFFERSON (after long look) When is Earth, Wind and Fire coming? \nDAMONE (respectfully) I'm really not sure. I haven't heard anything yet, but I'll let you know the second there is the slightest news, sir. \nJEFFERSON I'm taking my little brother. \nDAMONE Excellent. So that will be two tickets... All right. Fine, sir. \nJefferson and L.C. push past the customers. \nCUSTOMER #2 Wow. He really lives here. I thought he just flew in for the football games. \nDAMONE (gaining composure) Shit, he's my man. He knows where to come for tickets. \nDamone turns to The Rat. \nDAMONE (CONT'D) Well, Rat. Are you ready for the moment of truth? \nThe Rat adjusts his jacket, and nods. \nTHE RAT She is immune to my charms. \nThey walk together towards Swenson's, as The Rat drapes his aqua-blue Cinema Four jacket around his shoulders, like a French film director. Damone walks a few steps, then stops Rat. \nDAMONE Hey, Rat. \nTHE RAT Yeah? \nBrad watches him disappear behind the door that says: ASSISTANT MANAGER. \nAs soon as Dennis disappears behind the door, the one Businessman in the place rises and returns to the counter. \nBRAD (CONT'D) (nervously) May I help you? \nThe Businessman has short, curly brown hair. He speaks in a whine. \nBUSINESSMAN Yes. This is not the best breakfast I ever ate. \nThe Businessman points to the huge display over Brad's head: TRY OUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST. \nBUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) And I want my money back. \nBrad begins searching under the counter. \nBRAD Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here. \nBUSINESSMAN No. I want my money back right now. \nBRAD Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too... \nBUSINESSMAN See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back. \nBrad begins looking to the restroom. \"Where's Arnold?\" \nBRAD I can't do that. But if you wait a minute... \nBUSINESSMAN (as if talking to a kindergartner) Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay? (looks at name tag) Please, Brad? \nBRAD I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here. \nBUSINESSMAN I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to... \nBrad looks up from under the counter. No amount of pay will make him take that kind of insult. \nBRAD Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass. \nBUSINESSMAN Manager!! \n\"Bam!\" The door to the Assistant Manager's office swings open, and Dennis comes hurtling out of the back. \nDENNIS Can I help you, sir? Is there a problem? \nBUSINESSMAN You bet there's a problem! Your employee used profanity and threatened me with violence! I'm shocked, frankly. I've eaten here many times and I've always enjoyed the service -- until today! \nAngle on bathroom door as it opens and Arnold starts towards the register. He quickly sees the incident with the irate Businessman and ducks back inside the bathroom. \nBUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) All I wanted was my money back for this breakfast. It was a little undercooked. And this young man threatened me. Now I plan to write a letter! I plan to... \nDennis wheels around to Brad. \nDENNIS Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way? \nBRAD He insulted me first. He called me a moron. \nDENNIS Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way? \nBRAD Yes, sir. \nDENNIS You're fired. \nBrad looks around, expecting his friends to defend him. Dave and Rich seem very occupied with their work. Brad is stunned. \nDENNIS (CONT'D) (to Businessman) I'm very sorry this happened to you, sir. \nBUSINESSMAN Thank you very much. \nThen Brad unhooks his fryer's apron and throws it on the counter. He grabs a backpack and walks out of the place. On the way, he bangs the bathroom door with his fist. \nBRAD I hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BRAD'S ROOM - DAY \nHe arrives back in his room and locks the door. He yanks the burger picture off his wall, dumps it into the trash. Then he takes it back out of the trash and cracks the cardboard picture and plastic frame in half. \nDARKNESS \nWe are in the middle of a deep, dark void. After a moment, a pinprick of light appears in the distance. We head towards the light. We are being led somewhere important. \nAs we draw still closer, curtains suddenly part to reveal a wildly cheering studio audience. We hear the voice of Merv Griffin. \nMERV GRIFFIN (O.S.) Will you please give a warm welcome to... Jeff Spicoli! \nThe Merv Griffin Show band begins playing a Merv Griffin Show version of AC/DC's \"Highway to Hell\". Someone hands Jeff Spicoli a microphone. He works the studio audience into a frenzy as he sings the words to \"Highway to Hell\": Merv Griffin show style. \nINT. GYMNASIUM - DOORWAY - DAY \nSpicoli wanders into the assembly, takes a seat on a corner bleacher. He sits just below Brad Hamilton and Lisa. \nOn podium in front of assembly, Cindy Carr and another cheerleader, Dina Phillips, are making a presentation before the school. \nCINDY I just want to say that we are not 'Spirit Bunnies' anymore. We always hated that name. It bugged the heck out of Dina and me... \nDINA It's just such a put down. \nCINDY They don't call the Chess Club 'Checker Champs' or anything like that. We're going to go to everything this year, you guys. We're going to go to soccer, wrestling, basketball... everything. We know you've got a lot of spirit! Everybody -- riiiiiight? And we're gonna destroy Lincoln next week? Riiiiiiight? \nANGLE ON THE STUDENTS OF RIDGEMONT \nThey don't respond. \nANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI \nwho is asleep in the bleachers. \nANGLE ON BRAD AND LISA \nsitting nearby. We hear them over the drone of the assembly. \nBRAD Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again. \nLISA If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back. \nBRAD Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor. \nThey sit in silence for a moment. \nBRAD (CONT'D) I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year. \nLISA (sighs) Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing. \nTIGHT ANGLE ON BRAD'S FACE \nas he accepts the news. \nLISA (O.S.) (CONT'D) But I still want to be friends. \nTIGHT ANGLE ON BRAD'S FACE \nas it falls slack. \nINT. GYM - PODIUM IN FRONT OF ASSEMBLY \nCINDY We're going to be going to every game this year. We just want the crowd to participate and we want spirit from every little person in this entire school. Allll-Riiiight? \nThere is unenthusiastic, minor applause from the assembled students of Ridgemont High. Vice Principal Ray Connors, a tough-looking man with an H.R. Haldeman crew cut, approaches the podium. He has a sour look on his face. \nCONNORS Well, thank you, girls. People, don't forget, the big game is one week away. We'll see everybody back here on Monday and have a good weekend. \nFor the first time during this assembly, there is a loud and hearty applause. \nA GRAINY HIGH SCHOOL FILM 57 \nWe are suddenly watching a movie shown on a class projection screen. We see footage of a serene, middle-class neighborhood -- as seen through the glass windshield of a car. Judging from the other vehicles parked on the street, the film is from the early Sixties. We hear the narrative voice of Desi Arnaz, speaking in his inimitable Latin accent. \nARNAZ Driving ess an important part of each and every one of our da-ily lives. Ees a responsibility like no o-ther and ess a matter of life and... \nA ball comes rolling out into the serene street. A small child runs out after it. The driving of our vehicle brakes, but not in time. The film freeze frames on the terrified face of a child about to be splattered. \nARNAZ (CONT'D) Death. \nThere is a swell of dramatic music. \nARNAZ (CONT'D) They have foun'... The Braking Point. \nThe words flash on the screen and we hear a high school Driver's Training class groan in mock horror. \nINT. DRIVER TRAINING CLASS - DAY \nANGLE ON CHARLES JEFFERSON AND BRAD HAMILTON \nwho are seated in this class. \nANGLE ON LINDA AND STACY \nsitting together in the class. They are oblivious, lost in conversation. \nSTACY What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner. \nLINDA Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen? \nSTACY Sixteen. \nDAMONE You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts... \nStanding there in the front of the Wherehouse, The Rat nods his head and smiles. He's finally beginning to understand, and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE RAT'S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT \nWe see The Rat behind the wheel of a green Volvo. Stacy sits beside him. They are driving the streets of Ridgemont. \nINT. THE RAT'S CAR \nThis is it. The Big Date. \"Led Zeppelin IV\" is on the car stereo of his sister's van. \nFinally... \nSTACY Thanks for coming to get me. \nTHE RAT Sure thing. \nSilence. \nEXT. THE RAT'S CAR \nHe rounds the corner of Luna Street, off the neon fast-food stand that is Ridgemont Drive. \nINT. THE RAT'S CAR \nYet another silence has fallen. Then, after a time... \nSTACY This is a nice car. \nTHE RAT Yeah. It's my sister's. \nSilence. \nSTACY Do you have Mrs. George for English? \nTHE RAT Yeah. She is pretty good. \nSTACY Yeah. She is pretty good. \nEXT. ATLANTIS RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThey pull into the parking lot of a steak and lobster house called The Atlantis. \nTHE RAT Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant. \nSTACY I've heard that, too. \nThe Rat finds a parking spot near the back of the lot, grateful that the long silence is over. He walks with Stacy to the front of The Atlantis. \nINT. THE ATLANTIS - NIGHT \nThe Rat and Stacy are escorted by the host to a nearby table. They are given large wooden menus. \nTHE RAT Do you know what you want? \nSTACY I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special. \nTHE RAT Excellent. \nThe Rat leans back in the booth. He is starting to feel in control now. Then something hits him. The panic sweeps across his face. \nSlowly, The Rat reaches back to check his wallet. It's gone. \nSTACY Are you all right? \nTHE RAT (weakly) Oh yeah. \nCool. Cool was the name of the game. Stay cool. \nTHE RAT (CONT'D) Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment? \nSTACY Not at all. \nJust as The Rat is about to get up, the Waitress approaches the table. \nWAITRESS Are you ready to order here? \nTHE RAT Well... sure. (settles back down) She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same. \nWAITRESS Anything to drink? \nTHE RAT Two Cokes. \nWAITRESS Okay. Thanks. \nThe Rat pulls up to Stacy's house in the cul-de sac. He stares straight ahead, like a zombie. \nTHE RAT I had a really nice time tonight. \nSTACY Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck. \nThe Rat nods glumly. \nTHE RAT I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez. \nSTACY Do you want to come inside? \nTHE RAT Aren't your parents asleep? \nSTACY No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house. \nTHE RAT Okay. Sure. I'll come in. \nWe see a confused but interested look on The Rat's face. \nINT. THE HAMILTON HOUSE - EVENING \nThey walk in the front door. The Rat stands uncomfortably in the doorway to the living room. \nTHE RAT Where's your brother? \nSTACY I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink? \nTHE RAT No. That's okay. \nSTACY Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind. \nTHE RAT Naw. I don't mind. \nStacy turns her back and pulls up her hair. \nSTACY Will you unzip me? \nANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE \nas the wheels inside his mind start to spin. This can't be what it seems. He unzips Stacy, past her bra, down to the small of her back. It's the first time he's ever done anything like that. \nSTACY (CONT'D) Thanks! \nShe walks down the hall to her room, easing out of her dress as she walks. She leaves the door to her room open. \nSTACY (CONT'D) You can come in, if you want! \nANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE \nHe is completely unsure of himself, as he begins to walk down the hall. His heart pounds into his throat. He turns the corner and steps into Stacy's room. \nINT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nStacy stands there, looking gorgeous in an almost seethrough white robe. The Rat pretends not to notice. \nTHE RAT So... pretty nice house you've got here. \nSTACY Thanks. So... (puts hands on hips) What do you want to do? \nANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE \nas he struggles with the memory of Damone's words. \"Always call the shots.\" \nTHE RAT I don't know. \nSTACY Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right? \nTHE RAT Sure. \nStacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab the books from the top shelf. The Rat watches her robe slip up her legs. Then she sits down next to him. Her knee grazes his. It is almost too much for The Rat. Go for it. We see The Rat struggle with the action of putting his arm around her. He almost does, but then reacts as she says suddenly... \nSTACY This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan? \nTHE RAT (looking pained) Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan. \nHer knee grazes him again. Does she expect something? \nTHE RAT (CONT'D) Look, Stacy, I want you to know that... \nThe Rat struggles. Try as he might, he can't seem to cross the line. He can't make his move. He is woeful as he completes the sentence. \nTHE RAT (CONT'D) ... I've got to go home. \nSTACY Do you really have to go? \nTHE RAT Well... it's getting kind of late. \nSTONER #1 There's the pizza. \nSTONER #2 Totally! \nMr. Hand pushes the pizza into their hands and slams the door. \nSPICOLI You better save some for me, you swine! \nMR. HAND And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week. \nSpicoli eases back in his chair, shrugs. It was a good idea at the time. \nINT. CAPTAIN KIDD FISH AND CHIPS - DAY \nBrad Hamilton, looks terribly uncomfortable in his Ponce de Leon hat and buccaneer uniform. He rings up an order for an older Customer. \nCUSTOMER Why aren't you in school, son? \nBRAD I go to school in the mornings. I have a work study program for the afternoon. \nHe bags one final coffee and punches up the amount. \nBRAD $8.46, please. \nCUSTOMER Here you go. I have it exactly. (sets money down) Good luck! \nBRAD Thank you, and thanks for coming to Captain Kidd. \nBrad loosens his buccaneer scarf, and starts back towards the kitchen. He is stopped by the sudden appearance of Captain Kidd Assistant Manager, Harold. \nHAROLD Hamilton! I'll take over the fryer. Those boys at IBM need some Catch of-the-Day boxes, and I told them you would personally deliver them within the hour. I'll reimburse you for gas. \nBrad dutifully unhooks his apron, to reveal the bottom half of his pirate suit. \nBRAD Just write me out a bill. \nWhile Harold leans down to tally up the fish order, Brad goes to a nearby employee's closet. He has completely perfected the art of changing back into his street clothes, and it takes less than a minute. He is just about to finish buttoning his street shirt when Harold sees him. \nHAROLD Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on? \nBRAD This is how I dress all the time. \nHAROLD But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform. \nBRAD I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable. \nHarold can barely fathom the idea. \nHAROLD Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that! \nBRAD You really want me to put all this stuff back on? \nHAROLD Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton. \nANGLE ON BRAD \nas he stands there, stoic looking. \nBRAD I don't believe you're asking me to do this, but okay. \nHe begins taking off his street shirt. He looks at Harold, looks at the boxes, and returns to the closet. \nINT. THE CRUISING VESSEL \nBrad is driving down the freeway, listening to the music of Bruce Springsteen's \"Out in the Streets.\" He pries open one of the fourteen Catch-of-the-Day boxes on the seat next to him and pulls out a small piece of fried fish. Brad takes a bite. The look on his face says it is the worst piece of shit he has ever tasted. He throws the piece out the window, and drives on. \nBrad turns to see a girl smiling at him from another car. It makes his afternoon. He returns the smile with gusto. \nANGLE ON THE GIRL \nas she bursts out laughing and drives away. \nANGLE ON BRAD \nlooking perplexed. Then he realizes that he hasn't taken his Ponce de Leon hat off. Brad drives on. \nA SERIES OF ANGLES ON BRAD'S CAR \nas we see the Cruising Vessel move down the highway. We see the Captain Kidd hat go flying out the window. Then the plastic sword, and the scarf. Then a couple boxes of Captain Kidd fish. Then the rest of them. We see Brad rip past the IBM Building. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RIDGEMONT HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON \nSchool is out and kids are leaving campus, heading for the parking lot and bus stop. We see Mike Damone carrying some books, walking towards Ridgemont Drive. He is joined by Stacy Hamilton, who hurries to catch up to him. \nSTACY I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag. \nSTACY It's okay if it's your first time. \nShe gives him a kiss. \nDAMONE Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend. \nSTACY He's my friend, too. \nShe gives him another kiss. He kisses her in return. Standing there, feeling Stacy in her bikini, feeling her kiss him, Damone also felt some of his reservations slip away. \nDAMONE You're a really good kisser. \nSTACY So are you. (pause) Are you shaking? \nDAMONE (shaking) No. Are you crazy? \nIt is clear that this is as far as Mr. Attitude has ever gotten with a girl. Stacy takes the initiative, rubbing her hands through his hair, rubbing his sides, kissing his neck, then pulling away. \nSTACY (whispers) Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike? \nDAMONE You first. \nSTACY How about both of us at the same time? \nDamone nods, and watches as Stacy unhooks her top and steps out of her bikini bottom. She stands naked in the shadows of the afternoon sun. She sits down naked on a red changing room couch, and gathers her legs up to her chest. She watches as Damone struggles with his clothes. \nANGLE ON DAMONE \nhopping on one leg, pulling first out of his pants, then his jockey underwear. Bashfully, he goes to sit next to Stacy on the couch. They begin to kiss, and it quickly escalates into heavy petting. Stacy pulls away. \nSTACY I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not. \nDAMONE Let's continue. \nStacy leans back and pulls him on top of her. He enters her and begins pumping so hard, so fast, that he doesn't notice he's banging the sofa into the wall of the changing room. \nBut just as quickly as Damone starts, he stops. \nSTACY (whispers) Hey, Mike? \nDAMONE What? Are you all right? \nSTACY I think we're making a lot of noise. \nDAMONE I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. \nHe has a strange look on his face. \nSTACY What's wrong? \nDAMONE I think I came. Didn't you feel it? \nSTACY I guess I did. \nThey lay there, Damone still on top of her on the red couch. \nANGLE ON DAMONE \nas we read the confusion on his face. He is embarrassed, a little confused... mostly he just wants to be alone. \nDAMONE I've got to get home. I've really got to go, Stacy. \nANGLE ON STACY \nas she looks up at him. She gives him a kiss. Damone gets up puts his pants and shirt on. He leaves the changing room. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BIOLOGY CLASS - AFTERNOON \nWe see Stacy sitting at her usual seat, and she's wearing a bright spring dress with a slight amount of makeup. She looks at Damone's seat with anticipation, but it remains empty as other students file in. Finally, she turns to The Rat. \nSTACY Where's Mike today? \nTHE RAT Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th. \nSTACY What's April 16th? \nTHE RAT It's John Bonham's birthday. \nSTACY John Bonham? \nTHE RAT John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday. \nSTACY Oh. I see. \nThe bell rings, and Mr. Vargas enters the room with his Sanka cup. \nA student raises his hand. \nMR. VARGAS Yes, Randy? \nRANDY Who are these guys? \nMR. VARGAS Most of them were derelicts, Randy. They sold the right for medical examination of their bodies for money. Something like thirty dollars, I believe. Isn't that right, Doctor Miller? \nDR. MILLER Twenty-five dollars. \nANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI \nwho turns to Stacy. \nSPICOLI Twenty-five bucks is pretty good. \nMR. VARGAS Now this gentleman here is named Arthur. Arthur died from heart failure last week and we are fortunate enough to view his body in its pristine state. \nMr. Vargas suddenly pulls the white sheet aside and we see the body of Arthur. The students' eyes widen. Some gasp. Others cover their mouths. Others begin furious notes. Nobody speaks. The body of Arthur is smallish and withered. It is orange, flaky, and not quite real looking. A deep cut has been made in Arthur's chest. \nMr. Vargas bends Arthur upright for a better student view. He gestures to the deep cut made in Arthur's chest. \nThe tension mounts. \nMR. VARGAS (CONT'D) This incision allows us to pull aside the skin covering of the chest cavity and really observe the human organs as they exist in their natural state. \nANGLE ON ARTHUR \nand his shrunken face, which seems to say please don't. \nMR. VARGAS (CONT'D) I want all of you to take a look at the chest cavity for just a moment. \nMr. Vargas grabs the two sides of Arthur's chest cavity covering, and rips it open. \nMR. VARGAS (CONT'D) Here we have the human lungs and heart, which you can see is actually located in the center of your chest. \nWith a squish, Mr. Vargas reaches inside Arthur and pulls out the human heart for display. The class stands in silent shock. Only one comment escapes from any of them. \nSPICOLI Bitchin'. \nANGLE ON STACY HAMILTON \nwho goes running out of the \"Cold Room\", holding her mouth. The Rat runs after her. \nINT. BOTTOM FLOOR HALL \nRat and Stacy sit side-by-side on some orange plastic chairs, by a nurse's desk. Stacy is shook up. \nSTACY I made a fool of myself. \nTHE RAT Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in. \nSTACY What about the notes? \nTHE RAT I'll get you the notes. \nShe squeezes his arm. \nEXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON \nThe students file out of the hospital, looking like they've just been through a war. \nINT. LINDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIt is night, and Linda and Stacy are watching Fantasy Island. \nMONTALBAN You see, Tatoo, what this man doesn't realize is that he must one day leave Fantasy Island. And he must continue his life as an incurable leper. \nStacy is fighting back tears. Linda looks angry. \nTelephone rings. Linda jumps to get it. \nLINDA Hello. \nLinda obviously is disappointed when she hears a female voice. \nLINDA (CONT'D) Yeah... you're kidding... What did he say... What did you say... How much did it cost? Look, tell him he can have a relationship with you or a 'more open' relationship with someone else... Listen, Debbie, can I call you later. I'm waiting for Doug to call. \nShe plops back on the couch with Stacy. \nLINDA (CONT'D) I'll bet he forgets to call again. \nShe notices that Stacy is crying over the TV show. \nLINDA (CONT'D) God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban. \nSTACY I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing. \nStacy stands there, hands folded, nodding. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON \nHe is working at his desk, counting through a wad of money. \nANGLE ON THE LIST \nin front of him, which has a split line down the middle. People Who Owe Me -- fifteen dollars Rick. People I Owe -seventy-five dollars REO Speedwagon tickets, seventy-five dollars abortion. Damone counts fifteen dollars into his stack, crosses out Rick. Then he counts through the money. Seventy five dollars exactly. He crosses out REO Speedwagon tickets. This leaves him no money for the abortion. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON \nHere, at the same corner where she once waited for Ron Johnson, Stacy waits for Damone. Cars pass, no Damone. \nINT. HAMILTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nStacy is on the phone, calling Damone. We see the phone messages sheet that lists two calls for Stacy, and none for Brad. The line rings four times, then it's answered. \nFEMALE VOICE Hello? \nSTACY Hello... is Mike there? \nFEMALE VOICE Hold on. \nStacy sags, disbelieving, and looks at the clock on the kitchen wall. It's getting late... \nFEMALE VOICE (CONT'D) He says he's helping his father in the garage and he'll call you back. \nStacy is stunned. \nFEMALE VOICE (CONT'D) Hello? \nStacy hangs up. She punches out another number, quickly. \nMRS. BARRETT (V.O.) Hello? \nSTACY Hi, Mrs. Barrett. Is Linda there? \nMRS. BARRETT (V.O.) She went off to the beach. She'll be back later, though. \nSTACY Okay. Thanks. \nShe looks at the clock again, then hears a noise in the driveway. \nSTACY (CONT'D) Brad! Hey, wait a second! \nShe runs out. \nEXT. CRUISING VESSEL - AFTERNOON \nBrad and Stacy pull up next to the flea market. \nSTACY Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do. \nBRAD See you later. \nSTACY Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it. \nShe gets out of the car. \nEXT. FLEA MARKET \nStacy Hamilton watches her brother drive away. Then she looks to both sides, and walks on. She passes the entrance to the Flea Market. She walks around the corner to another building marked BIRTH CONTROL - FREE CLINIC. Brad follows her in the rearview mirror. \nINT. BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC \nStacy is lying in bed wearing a paper dress. Her hair is stuffed in paper shower cap. She looks anxious. In a bed next to her an older girl is being affectionate with her visiting boyfriend. \nA Nurse comes in with an IV. \nNURSE This is going to prick a little. \nShe sticks the needle into Stacy's hand. Stacy looks pained but doesn't yell. The Nurse pats the rolling bed. \nNURSE (CONT'D) Now scoot over here. \nStacy moves onto it. Looking up from her point of view, we see the ride out of the room and into: \nINT. OPERATING ROOM \nStacy gets wheeled in. The Doctor looks down at her. \nDOCTOR Hello, Stacy, I'm Doctor Bartell. \nStacy moves onto the operating table as the Nurse and Doctor get ready. \nEXT. DAMONE CAR \nMike Damone travels down Ridgemont Drive, making the turn into the school parking lot. There is a large cardboard panel taped on the side of his car. \nEXT. DAMONE'S LOCKER \nHe arrives at his locker, where, in white spray paint, there is another message: LITTLE PRICK. Several girls walk by, they laugh knowingly. \nGIRL #1 Hi, Mike! \nGIRL #2 Hi, mike! \nDamone backs up against the locker, with a sick smile on his face. \nDAMONE Hi... girls. \nMore students pass, looking strangely at the young man pinned against his own locker. \nEXT. BOY'S LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON \nDamone exits the boys locker room. Just as he does, he is accosted by The Rat. We have never quite heard this tone in The Rat's voice before. \nTHE RAT Damone? What happened between you and Stacy? \nDamone feigns The Attitude, shakes his head. Damone sighs. \nDAMONE Let me tell you something, Rat. Sometimes girls just go haywire. It was a month ago, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you ever since. We started messing around and... (shrugs) ... something happened. It's all over with. It's no big deal. I never called her again. \nThe Rat says nothing. \nDAMONE (CONT'D) If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying? \nTHE RAT No Damone. I don't understand. \nDAMONE She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway. \nTHE RAT Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove? \nDAMONE Jesus. I'm sorry. \nTHE RAT I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out. \nDAMONE Fine. Get lost. \nDamone starts to push past him, but The Rat shoves his shoulder hard. \nDAMONE (CONT'D) All right, Rat. You want to do something about it? \nDamone begins the classic high school fighting ritual. He throws his books down. He takes a step back. He goes into a crouch. He gestures towards himself. Then Damone says the universally recognized high school fighting words. \nDAMONE (CONT'D) Well come on. \nThe Rat shows no fear. As other kids begin to crowd around the two boys, Rat throws his own books down. He takes a step back, goes into the crouch. He gestures toward himself. \nTHE RAT You come on. \nThey stand there, gesturing, neither one of them wanting to make the first move. \nDAMONE No. You come on, you wuss. \nAssistant Coach Mr. Sexton comes running out of the boy's locker room, and steps in front of the two boys. \nSEXTON Hey! Knock this crap off!! \nThe Rat stalks off, disappearing into the crowd of onlookers. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RIDGEMONT DRIVE - NIGHT \nThe Ridgemont Drive strip is filled with cars, cruising for parties. There is a lot of honking, and yelling out windows. Everyone is headed towards the beach. We stay on a lowly 7-11 store near the freeway entrance. \nEXT. 7-11 STORE - NIGHT \nA yellow Firebird slowly, menacingly cruises the empty parking lot. It does not stop. \nThen, around the corner, walks Jeff Spicoli. We see him in the neon 7-11 light, his hands stuffed deep into the pockets of baggy jeans. He walks inside the store. He is the only shopper. \nINT. 7-11 STORE \nBrad Hamilton stands behind the counter in a red and white striped shirt and cap, making fresh coffee. Jeff Spicoli trudges up to the counter. He looks at Brad. Brad looks at Spicoli. There is an unspoken edge between them. \nSPICOLI Hey, mon, can I use the bathroom? \nBrad squints his eyes, looks at the sign on the back room door. \nANGLE ON \nWe see Stacy Hamilton, once again, at the cash register wearing an Assistant manager name tag and a hostess gown. She handles a customer's bill, then stands there a moment, looking glum. Linda Barrett approaches. \nSTACY Another summer of working at Swenson's. \nLINDA Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open. \nSTACY You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex. \nLINDA What do you want? \nSTACY I want romance. \nLINDA Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV. \nANGLE ON \nthe back kitchen door, which swings open, and out comes Mike Damone in a peppermint Swenson's shirt. He wipes some grime on his pants. \nSTACY Mike! You have a mess on C-9! \nDAMONE All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break. \nSTACY Get going. \nThe two girls smile, go back to their posts. \nINT. JEFF SPICOLI'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJeff Spicoli sits in his room, and it is his castle. Clothes lie in disarray on the floor. A huge half-waxed surfboard is propped against the window. We see Spicoli dressed in a too large white short-sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's fat paisley tie. He stops to take a hit from his bong, all the while talking on the phone. The music of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Freebird\" plays on the radio. \nSPICOLI I... am... so... wasted, mon. What is in this shit? (pause) Doesn't that stuff cause brain damage? (pause) Bitchin'. \nSpicoli listens for a moment. He rubs his eyes, shakes his head. He is really buzzed. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Hey, mon, I am going to Mexico as soon as school is out. Two more weeks, bud. Week from Wednesday. (pause) I am gonna take both boards, my duck feet, many cases of beer, and just jam. (pause) No, mon, from school. I'm leaving as soon as school gets out. I'll be at Sunset Cliffs by nighttime. (pause) Totally. (pause) Later. \nSpicoli hangs up, and concentrates on tying his tie. He almost strangles himself. Then suddenly the door to his room flies open and Spicoli's little brother Curtis bursts in. \nCURTIS Jeff you have company! \nSPICOLI Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you. \nCurtis slams the door and leaves. A moment later there is a knock. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) That's better. Come in. \nThe door swings open and Jeff Spicoli sits in stoned shock at the sight before him. There, standing in the doorway of his room is Mr. Hand. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Mr... Mr. Hand. \nMR. HAND That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in? \nSpicoli can only nod. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) (calling downstairs) Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Spicoli. \nHand walks into Spicoli's room, takes off his suit jacket and lays it on the chair back. He stops a moment and catches the stare of Miss January Penthouse on the wall, then turns to Spicoli. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff? \nSPICOLI Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year. \nMR. HAND I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff. \nSPICOLI Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand? \nHand removes several copies of Oui Magazine from another chair and sits down. He sets his briefcase on Spicoli's dresser, next to a bag of pot, and opens it up for easy access. \nMR. HAND Do you want to sit there, Jeff? \nSPICOLI I don't know. I guess so. \nMR. HAND Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here. (pause) As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson. \nMr. Hand takes a sheet from his briefcase and looks at it. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) According to my calculations, Mr. Spicoli, you wasted a total of eight hours of my time this year. And rest assured that is a kind estimate. \nHe returns the sheet to his case and looks into Spicoli's weed-ravaged eyes. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty. \nSPICOLI Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand. \nMR. HAND Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you. \nHand reaches in his case and produces the book. He hands it to Spicoli. \nANGLE ON MIKE DAMONE \nin another part of the dance, by the Junior class sponsored food counter. Damone is standing, talking to several girls, gesturing and being Damone, Mr. Attitude. \nDAMONE Sign my annual, honey. \nThe girls look at each other, laugh. They walk away. \nANGLE ON THE RAT \nstanding nearby. \nTHE RAT You're losing it, Damone. \nDAMONE You're crazy. Those girls love me. \nANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI \nsprawled out in the bleachers with his surfer stoner buddies. He turns to one admiring stoner (Todd). \nSPICOLI Hey, mon. Sign my annual. \nSpicoli slips the annual into the kid's crotch. The stoner winces in pain, but still opens the book and lingers on all the signings in Spicoli's annual. They are all drug-related messages from fellow stoners. After a moment, Spicoli's friend signs: \"Thanks for the reds. Todd.\" \nTODD Hey, mon, good thing we're going to Mexico this summer. 'Cause you're gonna get kicked out of your house when your parents read your annual. \nINT. GYMNASIUM - ANGLE ON DOOR \nBrad Hamilton pushes both doors open, and makes his entrance into the Last Dance. There is a lot of activity going on, but all nearby eyes turn to Brad as he walks into the dance. Fifteen kids immediately gravitate towards him. They all want Brad to sign their annuals, to talk about the 7-11 incident. Onstage, the T-Birds play the Beatles' \"It Won't Be Long\". \nWe see Brad's old girlfriend Lisa push up to him. Her new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm around her. \nLISA I saw your picture in the paper. You had the greatest look on your face! \nANOTHER STUDENT Front of the Metro Section. I'm telling my parents, 'I know this guy, I know this guy.' \nLisa's boyfriend pulls his arm tighter around her. \nLISA Will you sign my annual, Brad? \nBrad smiles, nods. He signs, and gives her his. We then see Brad's three Buddies from Carl's Jr. come up, pat him on the back and grab his shoulder. Brad studies them warily. \nBUDDY #1 Fuckin' manager of 7-11! \nBUDDY #2 Get us jobs over there, Brad! You can do it! \nBRAD Since when do you guys want to work at 7-11? \nBUDDY #2 Come on, Brad! It would be great! All of us together! \nBRAD Well, 7-11 is a tremendous operation. It's really changed, man. They've got great food, great magazines, videogames... it's class. Total class. \nBUDDY #3 As soon as you can get us in there, we're gone from Carl's, Brad. \nBUDDY #2 Yeah, man, all the little punks from junior high have taken over the place. \nBrad leaves his old buddies. He grins and notices someone across the crowded dance floor. \nBRAD Hey, Thompson! Wendell! Get a job! \nThey laugh, flip him off. Brad is back in his element at last. He moves into the main dancing area, works his way across the room, past the bleachers, when he hears a voice. \nSPICOLI (O.S.) Hamilton! \nBrad turns around, seen Spicoli sitting on the bottom rung of the bleachers. Spicoli looks back with true respect. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Awesome. \nHe throws Brad his annual. Brad gives him his. They sign. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) Easy, mon. \nBRAD Later. \nANGLE ON THE BLEACHERS \nwhere several couples are passionately making out. Four teachers clomp up into the stands from different angles. They pin the couples in flashlight beams, like the main tower pinning an escaping prisoner. \nANGLE ON THE T-BIRDS \nonstage, singing the Rolling Stones' \"I'm Free\". \nEXT. GYNMASIUM - NIGHT \nWe see Jeff Spicoli leave the dance and come backing down the stairs with a stoner bud. His fist is in the air. \nSPICOLI Summer, mon! We're there! \n", "test1_input": "BRAD Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years! \nLISA I don't want to talk about it here, Brad. \nBrad prepares to respond. He squints his eyes, prepares for a truly sizzling comeback, when Dennis Taylor, short and prematurely balding assistant manager of Carl's Jr., comes bustling out of his back office. He quickly surveys the situation in the kitchen. \nTAYLOR Hamilton! You have fifteen double cheese to box! \nLisa returns to her cashier post, leaving Brad's last words stalled in his mouth. \nEXT. HAMILTON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nWe see the Hamilton's cul-de-sac home. All the lights are off in the house at this hour. Except for Brad's room. \nINT. BRAD'S ROOM \nBrad is alone in his room. He's prone on his neatly made bed, reading a paperback book entitled Power With Class. On the wall of Brad's room is a large framed photo of a Carl's Jr. hamburger. \nBrad hears a muffled knock at his door. \nBRAD Come on in. \nStacy walks into Brad's room. \nSTACY Thanks for getting rid of those flowers. \nBRAD Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers? \nSTACY It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him. \nBRAD I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own. \nHe begins pacing. \nSTACY Is everything okay at work? \nBRAD Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent. \nSTACY You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you? \nBRAD I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom. \nSTACY Why? Because she won't sleep with you? \nBRAD Where did you hear that? \nSTACY I'm just guessing. \nBRAD Well... it's true. \nSTACY Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa. \nBRAD Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend. \nSuddenly, Stacy pops the question. \nSTACY Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin? \nBRAD Why? \nSTACY I don't know. I was just curious. \nBRAD Maybe yes. Maybe no. \nSTACY You are a virgin! \nBRAD I didn't say that. \nSTACY But your face did! \nThey laugh. Then Brad turns serious. \nBRAD Are you still a virgin? \nSTACY Maybe yes. Maybe no. \nBRAD Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin! \nStacy smiles and stands up. She playfully slaps her brother on the arm and walks down the hallway to her room. We can see there is less frill and lace in Stacy's room. The junior high paperbacks are gone. There are no dolls in sight. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nLinda and Stacy walk past rows of cars. Stacy stops at a brown MG. \nSTACY There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen. \nLINDA Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again. \n", "test1_true": "LINDA Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him. \nSTACY If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen. \nLINDA Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games. \nThey enter the mall. \nINT. U.S. HISTORY CLASS - MORNING \nWe are now several weeks into the school year. Mr. Hand is dropping test papers on desks like they are pieces of manure. \nMR. HAND C... D... F... F... F... three weeks we've been talking about the Platt Amendment. What are you people? On dope? A piece of legislation was introduced into Congress by Senator John Platt. It was passed in 1906. This amendment to our Constitution has a profound impact upon all of our daily liv.... \nMr. Hand stops on a dime. He is like a champion hunting dog that has just picked up the scent. He scans the room. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Where is Jeff Spicoli? \nThere is silence in the U.S. history classroom. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) I saw him earlier today near the 200 Building bathrooms. Is he still on campus? \nSilence. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Anyone? \nOne student sitting next to Stacy raises his hand. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Yes, Desmond? \nDESMOND I saw him by the food machines. \nMR. HAND How long ago? \nDESMOND Just before class, sir... \nMr. Hand snaps his fingers, Hawaii Five-O style. \nMR. HAND Okay. Bring him in. \nDesmond hustles out the door. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) What is this fascination with truancy? What is it that gets inside your heads? \nMr. Hand begins to pace the aisles as he speaks. Occasionally, for emphasis, he bends down to lecture directly into the students' faces. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) There are other teachers in this school who look the other way at truants. (points to attendance clip on the doorway) It's a little game that you both play. They pretend they don't see you, you pretend you don't ditch. Who pays the price later? You. \nDesmond returns to the room with a red-eyed Jeff Spicoli. \nSPICOLI Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here! \nMR. HAND Thank you, Desmond. (to Spicoli) What's the reason for your truancy? \nSPICOLI I couldn't make it in time. \nMR. HAND (in top form) You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't? \nSPICOLI I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever. \nMR. HAND Food will be eaten on your time! (pause) Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this? \nSPICOLI I don't know. \nMr. Hand appears mesmerized. He then turns and heads for the board. He writes in long, large letters as he slams the chalk into the green board. He writes: \"I DON'T KNOW\". \nMR. HAND I like that. \nHe stands back and admires it. He turns randomly to Stacy. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) Don't you like that, Miss Hamilton? \nSTACY Yes, sir. \nMR. HAND I really like that too. 'I don't know'... that's nice. 'Mr. Hand, will I pass this class?' 'Gee, Mr. Spicoli, I don't know'. I like that. I think I'm going to leave your words on this board for all my classes to enjoy. Giving you full credit, of course, Mr. Spicoli. \nWe hear the blare of the dismissal bell. Stacy and the other students get up to leave. Spicoli stays in place. He has just figured out a truly bitchin' comeback... and his mouth is forming the first word, when Mr. Hand cuts him off. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) You can go now. \nHand turns back to his desk. The rest of the students have already left. Spicoli's audience is gone. He shrugs and lopes out the door. \nINT. RIDGEMONT MALL - AFTERNOON \nIt's Christmas time at the Ridgemont Mall. All three tiers are strung with neon lights, and we hear the sound of the bell-ringing Santas. \n", "test1_id": 336, "test2_input": "Spicoli fingers the bubbles in the wheel. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) With a genuine Mustang steering wheel, you can negotiate a hairpin turn with ease, my man. \nEXT./INT. MUSTANG \non the word \"ease\", Spicoli curls his finger into one of the Mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips it clockwise. The idea is to turn off onto a side street and head back to the party. But instead, at the moment of the hairpin turn, L.C. is attempting to switch the radio station. Spicoli crooks his finger farther into the bubble than he expected. The car swings in a complete circle, a circle that includes a bright yellow fire hydrant. The hydrant rips the side of the car open like a can of tuna. There is a silent moment of terror. \nSPICOLI Are you okay? \nThere is silence. Outside the smashed car, the Granada Jocks pass Spicoli and L.C. \nGRANADA JOCKS Fuck youuuuuuuuuu! \nThen L.C. stirs and utters his first words. \nL.C. My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us. \nSPICOLI Just be glad you're all right. \nL.C. My brother is gonna shit. \nSPICOLI Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us? \nL.C. First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.. \nSPICOLI Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car. \nL.C. You can't fix this car, Spicoli. \nANGLE ON THE BLUE MUSTANG \nwaffled and mangled. It is just inches away from scrap iron. \nSPICOLI I can fix it. \nMONTAGE OF SHOTS \nas we see Ridgemont High gearing up for its big Homecoming Game against Lincoln. We see a series of shots of kids talking about it, wagering on the chances of a Ridgemont victory. We see the many signs and placards all over school, proclaiming Ridgemont revenge. We see students lining up to vote for Homecoming King and Queen in the gymnasium. It is the most spirit that Ridgemont has shown this year. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RIDGEMONT SCHOOL - FLAGPOLE - DAY \nFrom the back of the parking lot, we see a crowd around the flagpole. A group of kids are staring at something. They sadly shake their heads at the sight, as if they are witnessing a funeral. \nAs we draw closer, we see the center of commotion. It is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles Jefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it to the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the message: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE. \nEXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT \nThe Ridgemont football bleachers are full of cheering students. We see the same basic groups from lunch court, and many more. \nThe cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr, Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader \"husbands\" sit directly in front of them in the stands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with some of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit several rows above them, watching. The teachers sit together in another section. \nANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTON \nwho is again sitting alone in the bleachers. Watching. Several old lunch court friends pass by, on their way to the concession area. \nSTUDENT #1 Hey, Brad! How's going? \nBRAD All right. \nSTUDENT #2 Where you working? \nBRAD Fish and chips place. \nSTUDENT #1 Which one? \nBRAD Just a fish and chips place. \nBrad says nothing more. The students look at each other. \nSTUDENTS We'll be seeing you, Brad! \nBRAD (sullen) Later. \nEXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - THE GAME - NIGHT \nEveryone is cheering the amazing game on the field. Charles Jefferson is poised on the offensive line. He mutters a string of obscenities at the opposing Lincoln player. The ball is snapped, and Charles Jefferson comes directly at the player with both elbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet. The Lincoln player is hit and keels over. \nCharles Jefferson sets up for another play. The ball is snapped. Ka-boom. Down falls another Lincoln player. Jefferson doesn't know who it was who wrecked his Mustang, but he wasn't about to spare any of them. There is pure madness in his eyes. It has taken him over. \nThe Ridgemont points rack up. Jefferson is single handedly maiming Lincoln for Homecoming. \nEXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT \nWe see Jeff Spicoli and L.C. sitting calmly in the bleachers, watching. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. FIELD AND SCOREBOARD \nThe half-time gun fires and the score is 36-7... Ridgemont. Even the Ridgemont players steer clear of Charles Jefferson as they return to their locker room. \nEXT. THE HAMILTON POOL - HOT AFTERNOON - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER \nLinda and Stacy are sitting by the pool, dressed in string tie bathing suits. They are listening to the music of Tom Petty's \"Breakdown\" playing on the living room stereo. Linda luxuriously applies suntan lotion to her chest and legs, in long and writhing strokes. Stacy reads a book. It's called Total Orgasm. Several beats pass. \nLINDA I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here. \nSTACY (engrossed in book) You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school. \nLINDA Why don't you put your mother's secret book back? \nLinda continues regally applying lotion. \nSTACY Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?' \nLINDA (automatic) Okay, penis, that's one, balls... \nSTACY Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category? \nLINDA You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck. \nSTACY All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?' \nLINDA Climax together. \nSTACY Does that ever happen? \nLINDA No. But it's a nice idea. \nSTACY Listen to this ... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.' \nLinda stops applying lotion, considers that thought. \nLINDA Well... they obviously don't know about Doug. \nThey laugh. Linda resumes applying the lotion. Stacy continues reading the book. A couple of beats pass. \nSTACY How long does Doug take? \nLINDA I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes. \nSTACY (pause) What's Doug do in Chicago? \nLINDA He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him. \nStacy looks at Linda, almost disbelieving. \nLINDA (CONT'D) (wistful) He's no high school boy. \nThere is a noise by the side fence leading into the Hamiltons' backyard. It is Mark Ratner and Mike Damone. They are already wearing swimsuits. \nDAMONE Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework! \nSTACY Oh, really? \nTHE RAT Really. We figured you needed the help. On such a hot day. \nStacy quickly stashes the book in a stack of towels beside her. She leans over to Linda and speaks confidentially. \nSTACY What do you think? \nLINDA I think they're both virgins. \nStacy smiles, gets up and goes over to the fence. \nSTACY I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda? \nLINDA No. \nDAMONE Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi. \nSTACY O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay? \nEXT. HAMILTON POOL \nMike Damone yells \"banzai!\" and dives into the small pool. At one end of the pool is the jacuzzi, which is separated by a tile wall. Damone has already poured the Wisk into the jacuzzi, and the detergent has created a huge bubble bath effect. Damone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi. \nStacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits kicking her legs by the side of the pool. Linda stands on the board. She is poised to dive. The Rat treads water and stares at both girls. Inside the Hamilton living room, the family stereo plays the music of Deep Purple's \"Woman From Tokyo\". \nDAMONE Hey, Linda! I'll judge your dive. I'm a champion diver myself. \nBrad arrives home by the side gate and slams it behind him. He is home from a bad day at work. He walks out onto the patio and stands with his hands on his hips. For the first time, our former campus hero looks absurd. He is still in his uniform from Captain Kidd Fish and Chips -- it is a blue and white striped Pirates of the Caribbean outfit, complete with black plastic sword at the side, and a ridiculously large Ponce de Leon-esque hat. Brad carries the hat under his arm. \n", "test2_id": 337, "test3_input": "BRAD Does Mom know you have company? \nSTACY It's just Linda. And Mark from school. \nBrad ignores the underclassmen, and notices Linda on the board in her maroon bikini. He smiles. \nBRAD Hi, Linda. \nLINDA Hi, Brad. \nBRAD Well, you guys, keep it down. I've got some work to do upstairs. \nBrad turns and heads back inside. He is just out of earshot when they begin talking about him. \nLINDA God, he hardly even talks anymore. \nSTACY I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms. \nDAMONE Poor guy. \nTHE RAT Really. \nStacy breaks the spell by jumping into the water, surfacing, and flipping over the tile wall into the Jacuzzi. She sits next to Damone, looking mischievous. \nANGLE ON DAMONE AND STACY IN THE JACUZZI \ntalking while the others are at the other end of the pool. \nANGLE ON THE RAT \ncasually catching sight of them together from the other side of the pool. We can read the emotions on The Rat's face. He is still taken with Stacy, but his big moment for her appears to have passed. \nANGLE ON DAMONE AND STACY IN THE JACUZZI \nas they talk. \nUnderneath the water, her leg accidentally knocks against his. Then he feels her continue. Damone feels Stacy's cool hand on his inner thigh. Moving upwards, stopping just short of the bulge in his trunks. \nANGLE ON DAMONE'S FACE \nas it loosens and quivers just the slightest bit. This is uncharted territory, even for Mr. Attitude. \nANGLE ON LINDA \nwho is now sunning herself by the side of the pool. She rubs her legs against each other, slowly, enjoying the hot afternoon. \nEXT. BRAD'S WINDOW - ANGLE ON BRAD \nwho is watching Linda from the window in his room. We see him from behind, peeking out the curtains. \nEXT. POOL - ANGLE ON LINDA \nwho smiles at Damone and flips back into the pool with a splash. Damone steals a look down at his swimsuit. He's popped a big one. \nTHE RAT Why don't you get up and do a dive, Mike? \nLINDA Go ahead. \nANGLE ON DAMONE'S FACE \nand we know he can't get out of the water yet. \nDAMONE No. I don't think so. Not right now. \nTHE RAT Chicken! \nLinda, for one, loses interest quickly. Standing by the side of the pool, she jams a finger in her ear and wiggles it. \nLINDA Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips? \nSTACY God, I don't think so. Better look in the house. \nLinda towels off and heads back inside the Hamilton house. She knows how to walk. \nINT. BRAD'S BEDROOM AND BATHROOM - AFTERNOON \nWe see Brad's room. The Carl's burger picture on the wall is conspicuously missing. There is music playing from his stereo -- Pink Floyd's \"You and Me\". \nWe see Brad. He is kneeling on the bathroom floor, his back to us. His green T-shirt is on, his underwear in a pile on the floor behind him. His arm is pumping slowly. Brad is jacking off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HAMILTON POOL - BRAD'S DAYDREAM \nIt features Linda Barrett, just as she stood on the diving board a moment ago. She is gorgeous. Her breasts seem even bigger than usual. Her nipples are hard, poking through the film maroon string bikini. Water rolls slowly down her cheeks, into the corners of her mouth. Her lips are parted slightly. Her eyes are filled with desire as she says... \nLINDA Hi, Brad. (pause) You know how cute I always thought you were. I think you're so sexy. Will you come to me? \n", "test3_true": "in a nice shirt, his hair combed back and looking great. He walks to Linda. She reaches out and grabs him for a kiss, pulling him close. Then she pushes him away, so he can watch as she carefully unstraps the top of her bathing suit. The incredible Linda Barrett's breasts fall loose. \nShe takes Brad's hands and places them on her, as she begins unbuttoning his shirt. They are just about to fall into passionate lovemaking when we hear... \nLINDA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hey, Brad! Do you have any Q-Ti... \nThe daydream evaporates and we see real life again with an... \nINT. BRAD'S BATHROOM - ANGLE ON LINDA'S FACE \nin the doorway of Brad's bathroom as she watches the sight before her. \nANGLE ON BRAD \ntrying to cover himself and act nonchalant and keep his back turned at the same time. The words barely escape his mouth. \nBRAD Wait just a... minute. \nLINDA Sorry. I didn't know anybody was in here. \nLinda turns and goes immediately, as if she wants to forget what she saw as quickly as possible. She closes the door behind her. \nANGLE ON BRAD \nstill kneeling. It had all happened so quickly, so fast \nBRAD Doesn't anybody fuckin' knock anymore? \nHe slams the toilet seat down and we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. U.S. HISTORY CLASS - DAY \nThe third attendance bell rings, and Mr. Hand strides to the front of the class. He locks the door. Then he takes the front of the class and notices something very different. \nANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI \nbright and clear-eyed, sitting in the front row. His hands are clasped in front of him on the desk. His textbook is open to the proper page. \nMr. Hand is suspicious, but continues with class. \nMR. HAND Now in 1898, Spain owned Cuba. Outright. Think about it. Cuba, owned by a disorganized parliament 4,000 miles away. Cubans were in a constant state of revolt. \nMr. Hand begins pacing the aisles as he talks. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) In 1904, the United States decided to throw a little weight around, and... \nThere is a brief, sharp knock at the door. Mr. Hand whips his head around, like McGarrett. He approaches the door like a cat. \nMR. HAND (CONT'D) (sweet voice) Who is it? \nVOICE Mr. Pizza. \nMR. HAND Again? \nVOICE Mr. Pizza, sir! \nHand swings the door open, out of curiosity. In walks a young Man in a Mr. Pizza delivery shirt. \nPIZZA MAN Okay, who had the double cheese sausage and bologna? \nJeff Spicoli speaks up. \nSPICOLI That's me. \nThe Delivery Man takes the pizza, sets it on the desk, as Spicoli whips out some crumpled dollars. Then he produces yet another crumpled dollar, and presses it into the Delivery Man's hand. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) For you, my man. \nThe Delivery Man thanks him warmly, just as Mr. Hand rages into the picture. \nMR. HAND Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing? \nSPICOLI Learning about Cuba. Having some food. \nMR. HAND Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time. \nSPICOLI (cool and urbane) I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time? \nMr. Hand is so furious he's almost shaking. \nSPICOLI (CONT'D) So I thought I'd order us a pizza. Just leave me a lot of bologna... \nMr. Hand snatches up the pizza, and starts to throw it in the wastebasket. Then he thinks better, and heads for the door. He opens it just as a gang of young Stoners walk past. \n", "test3_id": 338}

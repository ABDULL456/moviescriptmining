{"train": "SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE \nWritten by \nSimon Beaufoy \nNovember 4th, 2007 \n\u00a9 SLUMDOG FILMS LIMITED 39 LONG ACRE LONDON WC2E 9LG \n1   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 1 \nAn expensive bathroom suite. Excess of marble and gold taps. Into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes. Hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of thousands of rupees. The sound of a fist thumping on the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other side. \nJAVED O/S Salim! Salim! \n2   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. DAY.                              2 \nDarkness. Then, glimpses of faces. In the half-light, shadowy figures move with purpose. An implacable voice announces. \nTALKBACK V/O Ten to white-out, nine, eight, seven... \nPREM Are you ready? \nSilence. A hand shakes a shoulder a little too roughly. \nPREM (CONT'D) I said are you ready? \nJAMAL Yes. \n3   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 3 \nThe thumping at the door continues. The sound of mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the chamber, snaps the chamber shut. \nTALKBACK V/O ...three, two, one, zero. Cue Prem, cue applause... \nSuddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through. A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly... \n4   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       4 \n...we are back in the studio, the gun-fire morphing into rapturous applause. \n(CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:                                                       4 \nTALKBACK V/O Go, Prem. \nA wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage. Cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. On stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem Kumar. \nPREM Welcome to Who Wants To Be A Millionaire! \nMore applause. \nPREM (CONT'D) Please give a warm welcome to our first contestant of the night- a local from our very own Mumbai! \nUnder cover of the wild applause, Prem ushers Jamal towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing. \nPREM (CONT'D) Smile, dammit. \nThe lights seem to bore into him but Jamal manages a tentative smile. Out of nowhere, a hand slaps him ferociously across the face. Then again and again. Blood trickles from his mouth. \n5   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. NIGHT.                               5 \nThe studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the harsh bulb of an interrogation light. Jamal is strung from the ceiling by his arms. \nCONSTABLE SRINIVAS Your name, bhen chod. \nConstable Srinivas's hand pulls back Jamal's head by the hair, forcing him to stare directly into the lights. \nCONSTABLE SRINIVAS (CONT'D) Your name! \nJAMAL Jamal Malik. \nAnd seamlessly we are back.... \n6   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         6 \n...on the set of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Prem leans back in his chair, a man at home in his surroundings. Jamal sits opposite, frozen. \nPREM So, Jamal, tell us a bit about yourself. \nClose on Jamal's face. Without warning, it is shoved under water. \n7   INT. BUCKET. NIGHT.                                         7 \nWe look up from the bottom of the bucket at the screaming face of a drowning man. His head shakes desperately, pointlessly. Then Jamal's face is dragged up again, roaring for breath. Close on his eyes. \nJAMAL V/O I work in a call centre. In Juhu. \n8   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         8 \nPREM A Phone-basher! And what type of call centre would this be? \nJAMAL XL 5. Mobile phones. \nPREM Aha! So, you're the man who rings me up every single day of my life with Special Offers, huh? \nJAMAL No, actually, I'm an assistant. \nHe pays no heed to the rest of the children who are scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. The ball seems suspended in the blue sky. Shouts from the other children seem very far away. He doesn't notice that they are screaming for him to get out of the way. Jamal adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. Then out of nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. Jamal is knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the plane. The ball bounces away. Also flattened, Salim gets to his feet. \nSALIM (CONT'D) How could you drop that? It was a sitter. \nThen Salim's face turns to one of alarm. \n12   EXT. AIRPORT PERIMETER. DAY.                                12 \nAt the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming abuse and wielding a long stick. The kids dash across a rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes that run in between the shacks of the slum. \nSECURITY GUARD Private-ka land! Private-ka land! The planes won't kill you, mader chod, I will! \nJamal and Salim- also with a wooden sword- break off, head down a separate lane. The Guard pursues them. \n13   INT. JUHU SLUM. DAY.                                        13 \nThe lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are three feet wide, with an open drain running down the middle. Many of the precarious upper floors of the shacks have been built right over the paths, turning them into black tunnels. Tunnels shot through with slivers of light. If you didn't live here, you would be lost and frightened in minutes. \nBut these children are natives and with the practice of many years, Jamal and Salim zig-zag down the warren of lanes. \nThey dodge past people cooking in the doorways, sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a naked four year-old, pissing into the drain. Salim shouts a warning. \n(CONTINUED) \n13   CONTINUED:                                                13 \nSALIM Vinod! Musketeers coming through! \nWithout breaking step, they both jump expertly over the stream of piss. Not so the Security Guard who gets it all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit. \nThe two children charge past a shack filled to the roof with chickens in cages who all start squawking. They break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the slum lined with shops. It is packed: with people, stalls, bicycles and cows. All modern India is here, drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food, playing carom, video games. Leaving a trail of shouting and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new Mercedes almost blocking the lane. Beside it stands Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his two Minders. Jamal and Salim skid to a stop, put their hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car. \nStill in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides carefully past the car with deprecating bows and smiles. On past the chi stall where a crowd has gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv rigged up overhead. The irate Security Guard gets tangled up in a bicycle. Jamal and Salim stop to give him a taunting, hip-gyrating parody of the dance on the tv before scooting down another tunnel. They break out into sunlight again. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Jamal! \nJamal skids to a halt, bumping into Salim who is already frozen. \nJAMAL Shit. Mummy-ji. \nJAMAL'S MOTHER Don't you move a muscle. \nThe Security Guard arrives and he too skids to a halt at the sight of Jamal's mother. \nJAMAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D) Thank you, Mister Gupta. I will deal with these two. \nThe Guard puts his hands together in grudging respect as Jamal's Mother lifts each skinny kid off the floor by their t-shirt and marches them down the road. \n14   INT. SCHOOL. DAY.                                           14 \nThe two renegades are dumped by Jamal's Mother into their desks as Mister Nandha hands out ancient school books. \nMISTER NANDHA So, the musketeers return. We are honoured. Salim. Or Porthos, isn't it? \nHe crashes the heavy book down on his head. Salim opens the book. Jamal glances over and turns the book the right way round for Salim. \nSALIM I know! \nMister Nandha hovers over Jamal's head. He winces in anticipation. \nMISTER NANDHA And Athos. \nThe book comes down like thunder. Jamal blinks from the impact and suddenly we are back.... \n15   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               15 \n... in the Inspector's office. Jamal watches Srinivas fiddling with the video recorder, trying to get a picture. Through the pebbled glass, Jamal sees shapes moving along the corridor. \n16   INT. CORRIDOR. POLICE STATION. DAY.                         16 \nThe Commissioner of Police is fawning along beside Prem as they walk. The Young Constable hurries behind. \nCOMMISSIONER OF POLICE It is so kind of you to visit our station, Sir. A great honour. \nPREM Not at all, not at all. I hope you will visit us, Commissioner. \nOut of his jacket pocket comes a couple of tickets. \nPREM (CONT'D) Bring the family. It's a lot of fun. \nCOMMISSIONER OF POLICE Oh! A thousand thanks, Sir. Missus Janda will be overcome. (CONTINUED) \n16   CONTINUED:                                                    16 \nHe turns to the Young Constable. \nCOMMISSIONER OF POLICE (CONT'D) chi, you lazy chutiy\u00e9, chi! \nThe Inspector joins them in the corridor. \nCOMMISSIONER OF POLICE (CONT'D) Ah, Inspector! Cracked it? \nThe Inspector moves his head. Maybe yes, maybe no. \nINSPECTOR Nearly, Sir. \nThe Commissioner is just able to contain his apoplexy. \nCOMMISSIONER OF POLICE Nearly? Nearly? When Prem Kumar himself has- \nPRAKASH (CONT'D) I'm off to Devi's bog. Give me that. \nHe snatches the coin back from Salim and hurries off. Salim bangs on the toilet door. \nSALIM You just lost me good money, you stupid idiot- \nSalim stops. In the distance, there is the faint sound of shouting, a crowd coming closer. Then the crowd bursts through the outer shacks of the slum, pour onto the rubbish dump and make for the airfield. \nMAN It's Amitabh! That's his helicopter! \nJAMAL O.S. Amitabh? Amitabh Bacchan? \n21   INT/EXT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                    21 \nJamal peers through one of the many cracks in the shack. He sees crowds surging around the pier, charging towards a landing helicopter. Salim shoves the chair under the door handle- effectively locking it- and runs down the pier to join the chase. Jamal pulls up his shorts. \nJAMAL No! Wait! Salim, sala! Salim! \n(CONTINUED) \n21   CONTINUED:                                                  21 \nRattles the locked door. Pulls a torn flyer from his pocket advertising an Amitabh movie. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) Wait! Amitabh.... \nHe looks down the toilet hole at the sewage beneath him, the landing helicopter, the disappearing crowd. A final rattle of the door. There is only one way out. He jumps down the hole, sprawling headlong into a year's worth of human waste, managing to keep the flyer out the mire. He runs for the helicopter. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) Amitabh-ji! Amitabh-ji! \nSalim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a way through, but the adults shove him back. Not so for Jamal. The down-draft from the helicopter flicks bits of sewage from his clothes. Disgusted fans curse him and get out of his way. Suddenly, the red sea parts and there is nobody between Jamal and Amitabh Bacchan getting out of the helicopter. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) Please. Amitabh-ji. \nJamal holds out his flyer. Used to signing autographs, the movie star barely looks at Jamal. He takes the flyer and scribbles his autograph on it. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) A thousand thanks, Amitabh-ji. \nHe hands the flyer back to Jamal as his bodyguards surround him and hustle him into a car. Jamal chases the flyer across the tarmac, grabs it. Kisses it. \n22   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                      22 \nFrom high up, the rickety tin roof-tops of the slum seem to stretch to the horizon. There is a distant shout, a figure waving an arm. \nMAN It's coming! \nThen another shout and another, a chain of voices coming closer. People come out of their doorways with pails and buckets. The shouts come closer until we see a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and singing in the lane. Jamal is the happiest boy in the slum. \nJAMAL (singing) Amitabh, Amitabh, oh Amitabh! (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n22   CONTINUED:                                                22 JAMAL (CONT'D) I have your autograph, oh, holy Amitabh! \nMOTHER Here it comes! \nWater comes bubbling through a hose and Jamal's mother hoses down her ecstatic son. \n23   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                    23 \nNot far away, Salim wanders to Mister Chi's stall. He glances around to make sure everybody is glued to the hindi film on Mister Chi's tv and surreptitiously slips Mister Chi the signed flyer. Mister Chi takes a look and gives Salim a small wad of rupees. He sticks the money in his pocket, slinks away. \n24   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                    24 \nA tear-stained Jamal is furiously trying to batter Salim, but Salim's extra strength and height means that he can keep Jamal at bay with one hand, Jamal's flailing fists punching thin air. \nJAMAL Sala! Sala! \nSalim's laughter only makes Jamal cry harder. \n25   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                           25 \nClose on the tv screen in the Inspector's office. Prem ponders Jamal's choice. Presses a button on his computer. \nPREM V/O You chose A- Amitabh Bacchan. Guess what? You just won one thousand rupees! \nApplause on screen. The Inspector looks at Jamal. Jamal shrugs. \nJAMAL You don't have to be a genius. \nCONSTABLE SRINIVAS I knew it was Amitabh. \nJAMAL Like I said. \nConstable Srinivas twists Jamal's arm behind his back, evincing a squeal of pain from Jamal. \n(CONTINUED) \n25   CONTINUED:                                                  25 \nJAMAL (CONT'D) (squealing) He's the most famous man in India...! \nThe Inspector stares at Jamal, turns back to the tv where Prem is asking the next question. \nPREM O/S For four thousand rupees....the national emblem of India is a picture of three lions. What is written underneath? Is it... \n26   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         26 \nPREM ...A) The truth alone triumphs. B) Lies alone triumph. C) Fashion alone triumphs. D) Money alone triumphs. \nPrem shoots a mock puzzled look out to the audience eliciting giggles from them. \nPREM (CONT'D) Religion! Interesting. For sixteen thousand rupees, in depictions of the God Ram, he is famously holding what in his right hand? Is it A) a flower. B) a scimitar. C) a child or D) a bow and arrow? \n31   EXT. DHOBI. JUHU SLUM. DAY.                                 31 \nRight next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty water surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are washing clothes. Trains flash past only feet away from them. Down the other end of the pond, nine-year old Jamal and Salim are splashing noisily with some other children. Jamal's mother pauses in her scrubbing, wipes sweat from her forehead and gazes up at the leaden sky. \nJAMAL AND SALIM'S MOTHER It's going to come. Today. I can feel it. \nThe woman next to her nods. \nWOMAN Hope so. My head is exploding. \n(CONTINUED) \n31   CONTINUED:                                                 31 \nMOTHER Yes. We need rain. \nJamal is trying to intercept the ball that Salim and Krishna are throwing to each other. He's not having much success. The ball flies overhead again from Salim to Krishna. Jamal dives for it, misses and goes underwater. When he comes up for air, he shakes his head, clearing his ears of water. Then he stops, listens. Shakes his head again. Definitely something strange. Thunder? Salim and Krishna are trading catches, unaware that anything has changed. But Jamal's mother has heard it too. The faintest sound of shouting, roaring. The wave of noise is still faint but getting louder. A frozen moment broken by: \nMOTHER (CONT'D) Run! Jamal, Salim, run! \nEverybody stares at her. A train speeds through as she continues to shout, her words lost beneath the thundering train. \nMOTHER (CONT'D) Go! Run! \nThe train goes through, the last carriage flying past suddenly opening up the sight of a wall of rioting men wielding clubs, scythes, metal bars. They come screaming across the railway tracks. \nSALIM Krishna, quick! \nSalim holds out his hand to Krishna who is wading with difficulty through the water. \nKRISHNA No way! You're a bloody Muslim. Get away from me! \nThe rioters leap the tracks and are upon them. \nKRISHNA (CONT'D) They're Muslims! Him and him! \nMOTHER Go! \nSalim and Jamal scramble out and retreat into the lanes. Salim turns to see his Mother felled by a rioter. She is surrounded by screaming, chanting men who rain blows down on her. Jamal runs back and drags Salim down an alley. As they head down the alley, they get glimpses of burning houses, fleeing women, a three- year old boy in a doorway, painted entirely in garish blue. He stares at them. In his hand, he is carrying a bow and arrow. An eleven-year old girl dressed only in a pair of pants runs after them. (CONTINUED) \n31   CONTINUED: (2)                                            31 \nShe has two bleeding red gashes on her back. They turn a corner and head towards some vans full of police. Jamal sees Mister Nandha, the school teacher, stops. \nJAMAL Salim! \nThen Mister Nandha starts walking towards him. An oasis of calm in the chaos. Jamal looks at him with relief. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) Mister Nandha. \nMister Nandha smiles, walks towards them. \nMISTER NANDHA Ram nam satya hai, Babri Masjid dhvasth hai. \nJAMAL Mister Nandha? \nMISTER NANDHA We have destroyed your mosque. Now, the followers of Ram will drive you dogs out of our city. \nFrom behind his back he produces a knife and runs towards Jamal, screaming. \nMISTER NANDHA (CONT'D) Ram has returned to his temple! Ram has returned! \nThey flee, but Jamal turns, sees the girl, frozen. He chases back a few steps, hauls her arm. The spell broken, and they are off. \n32   INT. STREET. EVENING.                                     32 \nThey reach the safety of the police vans. But inside the vans, the police are smoking, laughing, playing cards. Down the street, a man comes whirling out of a doorway, his hair on fire. He falls into the middle of the street and is engulfed by rioters. Unperturbed, the police continue to chat. Salim and Jamal look on, horrified. Then one of the police men turns, looks at them. Is interested. Motions to a colleague. Puts out his cigarette with purpose. \nJAMAL Let's go, bhai. \nSalim and Jamal run. The girl follows. \n33   EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                     33 \nSalim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city. Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl. \nJAMAL We should go back. \nSilence. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) See if Ama- \nSalim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a moment. But only a moment. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) What about Jeevan Chacha? \nSalim shakes his head. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) Maybe he- \nSalim shakes his head again. \nSALIM - I saw him. He was with them. \nJAMAL But he wouldn't hurt- \nSALIM - he was with them! \nDIRECTOR V/O Prem? Tone it down, for goodness sake. You're making him a laughing stock. \nPrem glances up at the gallery with contempt. \nPREM We're having fun here. They love it...Where the hell do you get them from? \nHe makes no attempt to hide the conversation from Jamal. \nDIRECTOR V/O It's supposed to be a quiz show, not a blood sport. \nFLOOR MANAGER Two minutes. \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED: (2)                                             38 \nPREM Stop wetting your pants. I'll be a good little boy with the next one. Promise. \nHe chucks the head-phones back at the Floor Manager. Glances in the wings. Sees Nita, the make-up woman. Gets up and goes over. \n39   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                             39 \nIn the half-light, backstage, Nita dabs his face with powder. \nPREM Meet me after the show. Please. \nNITA No. \nPREM Nita, I can explain. \nNITA No need. I read it in bloody Stardust. Didn't even have the balls to tell me. \"Prem's happiness with another baby on the way\". After everything you said... \nPREM Baby, it all happened before I met you. I swear to you. \nNITA She's got the gestation period of an elephant, then. \nPrem is about to object. But instead, he laughs. \nPREM You see? Amidst all this misery, only you can make me laugh. \nScornful but hints of melting. \nNITA All this misery... \nPREM Her and I- nothing. You have to believe me, baby... \nNita turns away. The Floor Manager comes over. \nFLOOR MANAGER One minute. (CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                                39 \nPrem slings himself in a chair. \nPREM No. I'm not going on. \nNITA Prem... \nPREM I can't. Without you, it's all pointless. \nClicks his fingers at the Floor Manager. \nPREM (CONT'D) You. Tell the Director. \nNita shakes her head at the Floor Manager who by now is looking very worried. \nFLOOR MANAGER Thirty seconds. \nPrem shrugs and folds his arms. Sees her weaken. \nNITA Prem... \nPREM Calypso Bar, private room, just you and me? \nFLOOR MANAGER Fifteen. \nNITA (furious) Alright. \nHe grins, jumps up, blows her a kiss, and stalks back on stage. \n40   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       40 \nHe sits back down, says almost to himself. \nPREM Steel balls. \nTurns to Jamal. \nPREM (CONT'D) Okay, Juhu boy, you've had a good run. Take your Mother to Khandala and eat some chiki. \nJAMAL My Mother's dead. (CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:                                                40 \nPREM Well, your girlfriend then. Even better. \nJAMAL I don't have a girl-friend. \nPREM Live wire like you? You surprise me. \nJAMAL I wouldn't be here if she had. \nINSPECTOR Pretty was she? \nJamal stares down at his feet. \nINSPECTOR (CONT'D) Guess not. \nRight in the eyes. \nJAMAL The most beautiful woman in the world. \nConstable Srinivas snorts. Suddenly, Jamal is out of his chair and at Srinivas' throat. The combined force of the Inspector and Srinivas force him roughly back down. He is again handcuffed to the chair. \nINSPECTOR OF POLICE Well, well. The slum dog barks. Money or women. The reason for most mistakes in life. Looks like you got mixed up with both. Srinivas, you need the exercise: a trip to VT Station to check on the statue. And lock your bloody bike up. \nConstable Srinivas swears under his breath but bumbles out. \n(CONTINUED) \n45   CONTINUED:                                                45 \nINSPECTOR That's the chutiy\u00e9 out the way. Now, man to man. How did you know all the answers? \nJAMAL If I knew, I'd tell you. \n46   OMITTED                                                   46 \n47   OMITTED                                                   47 \n48   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       48 \nPREM Now we're into the serious money. For two hundred and fifty thousand rupees, ladies and gentlemen, a quarter of a million rupees...the song Chalo Ri Murali was written by which famous Indian poet. Was it A) Surdas. B) Tulsidas. C) Mira Bai. D) Kabir. Remember you still have two lifelines- fifty- fifty and Phone A Friend. Tempted to use one? \nJAMAL No. \nPREM No? \nJAMAL I know this one. \nPREM Oh. I see. An expert on the poets, huh? \nThe lights dim, the music swells and Prem presses his computer. \n49   EXT. MUMBAI STREET. NIGHT.                                49 \nJamal is studying a piece of paper and reading out numbers from it. There is something not quite right about Jamal- perhaps the fact that there are two feet by his ears. Salim is standing on his shoulders and spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a certain lack of confidence. \n(CONTINUED) \n49   CONTINUED:                                                 49 \nJAMAL Four, nine, zero, nine- the one with the stick going down, Salim- six- stick going up- \nLatika's head appears from around the corner. \nLATIKA (whispered) Oi! \nBut they don't hear. Then she is running for her life past the pair of them. \nJAMAL Six, one, shit, let's go- \nSalim collapses off Jamal's shoulders and all three run off down an alley past a dozen of the gang's sprayed-on adverts all reading: \"Beanbags- 989 4909661\". A fat Security Guard with a long stick huffs round the corner. Chases them up an alley. Nowhere to go except through an imposing gate that clearly leads to a private house. \nSECURITY GUARD Got you now, little shits. \n50   EXT. GARDEN. NIGHT.                                        50 \nThey charge across the lawn, down one side of the house where all the washing is hanging. The Guard gets caught up in drying sheets, towels. He fights his way through to see Salim, Latika and Jamal leaping over the wall to safety. But Jamal turns, jumps back and grabs a girl's dress from the line. \nSECURITY GUARD Aha! Little thief! \nThe Security Guard lands a couple of blows on Jamal's back as he dodges around him and back across the lawn, dress in hand. The Security Guard gives up. \nSECURITY GUARD (CONT'D) Pervert! \n51   INT. ALLEY. NIGHT.                                         51 \nJamal is examing the bruises on his legs. \nSALIM Useless bloody look-out. What good is she, huh? \n(CONTINUED) \n51   CONTINUED:                                                51 \nLATIKA (infuriated) I tried to warn you. \nJAMAL It's okay, Salim. \nLatika slips on the dress. Spins. Both of them look up. Stare. She pulls her hair back, smiles, is transformed into a beautiful girl. \n52   EXT. GORAI BEACH DUMPING GROUND. DAY.                     52 \nBlazing sun. Diggers and trucks are shifting mounds of rubble on a rubbish dump that seems to stretch for ever. Oblivious to the dust kicked up by the trucks, Latika is picking up old plastic bags, examining each one and putting the less worn in a big sack. The dress is recognisable but dusty and torn. She stoops to dig another bag out of the dirt, but stops and stares. Shimmering in the heat, a rickety pick-up truck comes through the rubbish dump gates. Toots at the Guard who waves, pulls up in the dump. \"Hope Orphanage is written on the side of the van. A man gets out. Looks around. \n53   INT. `TENT'. DAY.                                         53 \nUnder sheets of plastic propped up on sticks, Jamal and Salim are sleeping out the hottest part of the day. Jamal wakes to see a figure standing over him- a silhouette with a halo of sun behind him. Out of his bag, the man produces a bottle of Thumbs Up. He uncaps it with an alluring hiss. It is almost an advert for thirst-quenching affluence. Almost instinctively, Salim and Jamal stir. \n(CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED:                                                  59 \nHe sprints out of the room, wailing. \n60   INT. ORPHANAGE. SHOWERS. NIGHT.                             60 \nThe lights are on and two dozen children are screaming with laughter as Salim stands under the make-shift shower directing the water down his pants to his burning genitals, his face a picture of agony. Latika wipes crushed chillies from her hands. \nSALIM You're dead, sala. \nShe smiles and walks past Jamal with a shrug. Then Punnoose comes stalking in and the children scatter away. \nPUNNOOSE Get back to bed, dogs! What the hell... \nJAMAL V/O They taught me every song in the history of Indian music. \nINSPECTOR V/O And why would they do that, I wonder? \n61   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                          61 \nIn a shack, Arvind is singing one of Surdas' bhajans in front of Maman and an old man who by his ragged appearance must be a villager. Punnoose and Salim sit behind Arvind. \nMAMAN Very good, very good. I am pleased, Arvind. He is ready. \nARVIND Ready? \nMaman nods to Punnoose. Before Arvind can turn round, Punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after the briefest of struggles, Arvind's body goes limp. The villager puts an old tin box on the table. Taking the lid from the tin, he brings out a cloth and unwraps it. Inside is a spoon. He checks the edge with his thumb. Sharp. Douses it with a clear liquid from a bottle and passes it over a candle flame. The spoon whooshes with a high flame for a moment. The villager wipes it with the cloth nods to Punnoose. \nPUNNOOSE Salim! \n(CONTINUED) \n61   CONTINUED:                                                  61 \nUtterly bemused, Salim nevertheless helps Punnoose lay Arvind on the table. The villager takes hold of Arvind's eyelid and pulls it open. He brings the spoon close. Suddenly, Salim is being sick in the corner of the shack. By the time he has turned back, the villager is wiping the spoon on a blood-soaked rag. \nMAMAN Okay. Take him out the back. \nPunnoose picks up Arvind and carries him out. \nMAMAN (CONT'D) Now the other one. Salim, go get Jamal. \nA frozen moment. \nSALIM What? \nMAMAN Gunfighter Number One, isn't that right, Salim? The money, the women, the cars...you want them bad, huh? And why not? \nMaman gets out of his chair. Approaches Salim. \nMAMAN (CONT'D) The time has come to choose, yaar. The life of a slum dog or the life of a man. A real man. A gunfighter, Salim. \nMaman holds Salim's head in his hands. \nMAMAN (CONT'D) Your destiny is in your hands, bhai. You can be me. Or nobody. Understand? \nSALIM Yes, Maman. \nMaman nods. \nMAMAN So, brother, go get Jamal. \nSalim is frozen for another few seconds, then turns and walks out of the door. Punnoose appears at the door. Maman nods to him and he slips off after Salim. \n62   INT. DORMITORY, ORPHANAGE. NIGHT.                           62 \nAll the children are asleep apart from Jamal who is crouched underneath a couple of wash-basins. (CONTINUED) \n62   CONTINUED:                                                 62 \nHe is talking through a plate-sized hole in the crumbling masonry. Latika's eyes can be seen. \nJAMAL ...weddings, government things, big parties. If Maman says my voice is ready. Big money. \nLATIKA Enough for a room? \nJAMAL Easily. Maybe an apartment. \nLATIKA Really? \nJAMAL That's what Arvind said. On Harbour Road. You, me and Salim. The three musketeers. \nLATIKA Harbour Road! We can have ice cream from Babanji's. \nJAMAL Every day if we want. \nSalim appears at the door. Nods his head at Jamal. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) It's my turn. \nLATIKA Good luck, Jamal. \nLatika's hand comes through the gap. Jamal takes it for a moment. Salim hisses at Jamal. He lets go of the hand and heads out. \n63   EXT. PATH. NIGHT.                                          63 \nSalim and Jamal walk along the path, Jamal humming happily. Salim checks behind him, sees Punnoose following. \n(CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED:                                                69 \nJAMAL Yes. \nPREM Computer-ji, A lock kiya-jaye. \nThe lights dim, the music swells. Prem presses a button on his computer: looks him straight in the eyes for an age. \nPREM (CONT'D) (simply) Guess what? You're right. \nApplause, music, lights. \n70   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                             70 \nThe Inspector is eying Jamal, weighing it all up. \nJAMAL (shrugging) Blind singers earn double. You know that. \nINSPECTOR And what happened to the girl? They blinded her too? \nJAMAL (shakes his head) They had other plans. Though it took me a long, long time to find out. \n71   EXT. TRAIN. MORNING.                                      71 \nSalim and Jamal are sitting on top of the train. Jamal is staring blankly down the track. \nSALIM Ar\u00e9, Jamal... \nSalim puts an arm around Jamal's shoulder. Jamal wipes the tears from his eyes, shakes his head furiously. \nSalim gets up. Holds out his hand. \nSALIM (CONT'D) Come. \nJAMAL Where you going? \nSALIM First class, bhai. Where else? \n72   INT/ EXT. FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE. MORNING.                  72 \nThe ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline. A middle class Indian couple with their three children are sitting at a table, their breakfast spread before them. Into this domestic scene, unseen by them comes Jamal. Upside down and still outside the train, he is clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train roof. He gives a few, silent directional signs to Salim who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be hoisted up. The family continue to eat, unperturbed. \nThen Jamal appears again. This time one of the children spots him. Despite Jamal giving her a friendly wave, she yelps. The father of the group grabs Jamal's hand which has just snatched a samosa. There is a tussle, Salim holding onto Jamal's legs, the father holding onto Jamal's arms and Jamal in the middle, shouting. Salim is losing the battle and his footing. He stumbles and the pair of them fall from the train, rolling and tumbling down an embankment in slow-motion. Interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are images of Jamal and Salim on top of different trains- \n- huddled together against the freezing rain... \n- surfing the wind at the front of the train... \n- admiring the distant Himalaya.... \nJAMAL V/O We criss-crossed the country from Rajasthan to Calcutta. Every time we were thrown off we got back on again. This was our home for years. A home with wheels and a whistle. \nThe final tumble as they crash onto flat ground. \n73   EXT. RAILWAY EMBANKMENT. DAY.                             73 \nGroggily, Jamal sits up and groans. Somehow in the tumble, he has been transformed into a twelve year-old. And Salim a strong fourteen year-old. Through the haze of pain and dust, Jamal sees something glinting in the distance- something impossibly beautiful. \nJAMAL Salim? Is this heaven? \nSALIM You're not dead, Jamal. \nJamal clears his head. Sees Salim picking himself up from the ground. But the apparition is still there. \n(CONTINUED) \n73   CONTINUED:                                                73 \nJAMAL So what's that? \nSALIM Wow. \nThey stare at the apparition. The unmistakable outline of the Taj Mahal rises from the horizon, pink in the morning sun. Nothing could be more beautiful. \nJAMAL Some hotel, huh? \n74   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. DAY.                                      74 \nJamal and Salim wander under the great dome of the Taj Mahal. Two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive monument to love. It is a moment of genuine wonderment for them. Then a tour guide bustles nearby, tourists flowing behind him. \nGUIDE ...there are five main elements to the Taj. The Darwaza, the main gateway, the Bageecha or garden, the Masjid or mosque, the Naqqar Khana, the rest house and the Rauza or mausoleum. If you would like to follow me, I will show you the ninety-nine names of Allah on Mumtaz's tomb. As before, please remove your shoes. \nJamal follows the Guide and his entourage into the mausoleum. Salim meanwhile is studying the line of shoes. Tries a smart pair of women's court shoes, before slipping a foot into a nice, white sneaker. A smile crosses his face. His other foot quickly follows and he saunters away, all mock-innocence. \n75   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. DAY                                       75 \nJamal comes out of the mausoleum into the bright sunlight and looks around for Salim. No sign of him. Suddenly, a German couple approach. \nADA Please, what time is the next tour? \nJAMAL Err- \nPETER - so much waiting around in this damned country. (CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:                                                 75 \nJamal notices that he is standing next to a sign advertising guided tours of the Taj. \nA shout from the top of the lane and the boys scatter, bouncing the four wheels at speed down the lane. Jamal, the Indian driver and the two Americans return. They stop in front of the denuded car. \nCLARK Woah. What happened here? \nSuddenly the Indian driver is slapping Jamal ferociously around the head with one of his shoes. \nDRIVER I give you two tight slaps, mader chod! \nJAMAL I don't know! I didn't do it, did I...? Nothing to do with me...get off! \nBut the beating continues, the driver kicking Jamal down onto the floor. The two Americans stare, uncertain what to do. \nADELE Do something, Clark. \nCLARK Well, I- I dunno, I- \nFinally Clark intervenes, pulling the driver off Jamal. (CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED: (2)                                                80 \nCLARK (CONT'D) Okay, okay, just cool it. You're insured, aren't you? Jesus Christ... \nJamal sits up. He is bleeding from his nose and mouth. \nCLARK (CONT'D) You okay? \nJAMAL You wanted to see the `real India', Mister David. Here it is. \nADELE Well, here's a bit of the real America, too, son. \nAdele pulls out his wallet and rummages for dollars. \n81   EXT. YAMUNA RIVER. NIGHT.                                     81 \nA battered Jamal limps along the river bank towards the Taj. He stops, bathes his swollen face in the river. Then looks up. Strange lights appear to emanate from the base of the monument. And then strange sounds. \n82   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. NIGHT.                                        82 \nJamal climbs   a crumbling   wall and is confronted with an opera taking   place right   under the dome. Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice.   Hundreds of   India's smartest professionals are watching   from banked   seating on a scaffolding frame. \n83   EXT. STANDS. NIGHT.                                           83 \nJamal and a couple of street kids slip under the scaffolding supporting the banked seats. The street kids are trying to reach the hand-bags of the women above them. \nBOY (hissing) Oi, Jamal! There's a woman with no panties on over here. \nJamal reaches up and easily lifts a wallet from a man's trouser pocket. On stage, the actors start singing. Jamal seems to have forgotten the wallet and stares, mesmerised, at the stage. \nWOMAN Why don't you put it back and listen to the music? (CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED:                                                  83 \nJamal starts, makes to run, but the woman who spoke holds out a cigarette. A Canadian back-packer is sitting, staring at the singers. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) It's called Orfeo. Orpheus and Eurydice. Orpheus- that one there- is looking for his lover, Eurydice. She died, but he can't live without her. \nShe hands him a cigarette. He puts the wallet back. She smiles at him and they both turn to the stage. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) The pain is so bad that he goes to the underworld- the place we go when we die- to try to get her back. \nJAMAL You can't do that. Can you? \nWOMAN (shrugging) You can in opera. \nJAMAL Does he find her? \nWOMAN Watch and see. \nJamal watches as Orpheus sings one of the most beautiful pieces of music a human is likely to hear. Tears are running down Jamal's cheeks. \n84   EXT. YAMUNA RIVER. NIGHT.                                   84 \nSalim, Shankar, Jamal and the Taj Gang are gathered around a campfire. All of them wear extraordinary foot- wear of one form or another, from elaborate high heels to walking boots five sizes too large. A home-made hooka pipe is being passed around the fire. The eyes of the children have long since stopped focussing. Salim is sporting a Mercedes Benz badge on a chain around his neck. Behind him, Jamal appears, his face swollen. He takes off his fake Guide's Badge and throws it in the fire. \nSALIM Woah! What are you- Jamal? \nJAMAL We have to go, Salim. \nSALIM Go? Go where? (CONTINUED) \n84   CONTINUED:                                                  84 \nJAMAL Bombay. \nSALIM Don't be stupid. We're making good money here. \nJAMAL We should have gone a long time ago. \nSalim turns to Shankar with sudden understanding. \nSALIM Oh, God. Baby brother's in love. With a flat-chested hijra. \nJAMAL Latika was one of us. A musketeer. \nSALIM A musketeer...Grow up, Jamal. Look, how was I to know they'd beat you up. Here, you can have some of the cash. Come on... \nJAMAL I've got cash. \nHe rips out a wad of dollar bills from his pocket. \nJAMAL I've heard of him. \nThe Inspector kicks his chair. \nINSPECTOR Don't get clever or I'll get the electricity out again. \nJAMAL They didn't ask me that question. I don't know why. Ask them. \nThe Inspector stares hard at Jamal. \nINSPECTOR Funny, you don't seem that interested in money. \nThen, Constable Srinivas stomps back into the office, sweat pouring from him. \nCONSTABLE SRINIVAS Platform Seventeen- \nHas to consult his notebook. \n(CONTINUED) \n88   CONTINUED:                                                  88 \nCONSTABLE SRINIVAS (CONT'D) A statue of Frederick Stevens, architect and builder of Victoria Terminus in - \nINSPECTOR OF POLICE - yes, yes, Srinivas. The hundred dollar bill. \n89   EXT. BOMBAY. DAY.                                           89 \nFrom a thousand feet in the sky, looking down on the limitless megatropolis of Mumbai. Half-built sky- scrapers, slums, factories, roads, trains. \nJAMAL V/O Bombay had turned into Mumbai. \nWe descend, down until the lines of ants become people. \nJAMAL V/O (CONT'D) The orphanage had gone, the slum had gone, the people.... all gone. And everywhere was building, building, building. \nDescending even further, we pick out a construction site and then Jamal.... \n90   EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE. DAY.                                90 \n..who is staring through a wire fence at the construction site. \nJAMAL V/O But I knew she was here. Somewhere she was here. \nHe turns away, then something catches his eye. Underneath all the scraps of flyers and posters on a broken wall is a corner of something that Jamal recognises. He tears back a poster. Underneath, faded but recognisable is one of their beanbag graffiti advertisements. \n91   EXT. SLUM. NIGHT.                                           91 \nJamal asks a group of stall-holders on the slum main street. They shrug, aren't interested. The camera pulls up and up until Jamal is nothing but a dot wandering the maze of lanes, railways and highways, one among endless millions of people. \nJAMAL V/O Evenings, I searched. Days, I worked. \n92   EXT. HOTEL. DAY.                                            92 \nJamal wanders up to the rickshaw drivers parked outside the hotel. He stops and asks a question. The drivers shake their heads. Jamal continues up the steps towards a door, exhausted face and grubby clothes walking straight towards camera. He goes through the door and immediately.... \n93   INT. HOTEL. FOYER. DAY.                                     93 \n....is, without breaking step in a slightly grubby white uniform. He walks across the echoing, marble floor of a struggling four-star hotel, goes through double doors.... \n94   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.                                   94 \n...into a corridor that is devoid of carpet, paint- anything except a phone on the bare wall and a stool. The phone is ringing. Jamal sits on the stool and answers the phone. \nJAMAL Room service, good afternoon?... Yes, sir. Two chicken burgers, two fries, one cocoa-cola and one mango lassi and a large bottle of mineral water...Bisleri or Himalayan Spring, Sir?...Certainly, Sir. That will be with you in fifteen minutes, Sir. Thank you. Have a nice day. \nHe hangs up and goes through another set of doors... \n95   INT. HOTEL KITCHENS. DAY.                                   95 \n...to a cramped kitchen with definite hygiene problems. The cooks are playing carom on the table while under it Salim is dozing. \nJAMAL Two chicken burgers, coke, mango lassi and a bottle of Bisleri. \nDozily, Salim gets up and takes a look behind one of the fridges. He chases out a chicken with a desultory kick and sorts through some empty mineral water bottles until he finds a Bisleri bottle. Salim fills the bottle of mineral water from the tap and begins delicately re- sealing the tamper-proof lid with super-glue. Jamal collects cutlery and starts laying out a tray. \n(CONTINUED) \n95   CONTINUED:                                                95 \nJAMAL (CONT'D) I'm going to Chowpatti again, okay? Want to come? \nSALIM For God's sake. You got some disease? You force me back to this shit-hole, we leave our friends, a good life, loads of money- for this. Isn't that enough? \nJAMAL We came back to find her. \nSALIM No, you did, Jamal, not me. Me, I don't give a shit about her. Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim. Oh, yes, sir! You should come down the Cages on Saturday night instead of searching for your lost love. \nJAMAL I'm going to Chowpatti. \nSALIM (impersonating Ram) \"I'm going to Chowpatti\". There are nineteen million people in this city, Jamal. Forget her. She's history. \nJAMAL V/O But she wasn't. \n96   EXT. BANDRA BANDSTAND. DAY.                               96 \nJamal is dodging the traffic at a busy junction. He moves around the beggars who are working the cars. Then he hears singing. He looks around, suddenly panicked. It is a siren song drawing him across the road, not even noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple of cars, to a traffic island underneath a flyover. He turns a corner and there is the singer, leaning up against one of the struts of the flyover. Arvind. Older now, just like Jamal, a fourteen year-old boy. But eye- less. Jamal freezes. He approaches Arvind and waits until he has finished singing. Despite his eyeless sockets, Arvind appears to know somebody is there. He turns and bows low, putting his hands together. \nARVIND Namaste, Sahib. Any kindness you give will be repaid in heaven many times. \n102C   INT. TULIP STAR. HOTEL LOBBY. LATER.                    102C \nOn top of the metal preparation counters, Salim and Jamal are fencing: Jamal with a fish slice and Salim with a large spoon. \n103    INT. HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.                                  103 \nAn empty, dusty hotel suite. Jamal is on the phone. \nJAMAL 307 here. I want a bottle of Johnny Walker Red Label, beer, wine- \nLATIKA - chicken. \nJAMAL Ah! Chicken.... \nJamal closes his eyes at the wonderful thought. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) What kind of chicken? \nLATIKA (also dreaming) Tikka Masala. With roti- \nSALIM Naan, chutney, dal- \nLATIKA - aloo gobi, rice- \nShe stops. Change of mind. \n(CONTINUED) \n103   CONTINUED:                                              103 \nLATIKA (CONT'D) Pop Tarts! \nJAMAL Hold the line, chutiye. Pop Tarts? \nLATIKA On the tv. The commercial. Everybody's happy when they have Pop Tarts. \nJAMAL Exactly! A bucket of Pop Tarts, chutiye. \nJamal slams down the phone. \n104   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                  104 \nLatika is clearly in the shower. Jamal wanders in carrying an old pair of lunghi. Shouts through the door. \nJAMAL Found some lunghi! \nLATIKA V/O Stay there. Look away. \nThe shower stops. \nJAMAL Atcha, atcha. \nLATIKA V/O I'll know if you're looking.... \nJAMAL I'm not! \nWith a towel around her, Latika comes to the doorway where Jamal is holding out a the lunghi with his eyes tight shut. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) Where's Salim? \nLATIKA Dunno. \nShe watches this innocent a second with true fondness. \nLATIKA (CONT'D) You're a sweet boy, Jamal. \n(CONTINUED) \n104   CONTINUED:                                            104 \nShe takes the lunghi from his outstretched hand and disappears into the bathroom, slamming the door with a giggle. \n105   EXT. MUMBAI SLUM STREET. NIGHT.                          105 \nSalim wanders the crowded streets of a slum. He stops uncertainly at a doorway where a group of men are lolling, smoking. Plucks up his courage. \nSALIM I'm looking for Javed-bhai. \nMAN Ja, mada chod. He's not looking for you. Ja! \nSALIM I need to see him. \nThe group of men stir, irritated now. Salim begins to back away, then stops. Pulls the gun from behind his back. \nSALIM (CONT'D) I killed Maman. I'll kill you too.

LATER.                                  106 \nJamal and Latika lie on the bed, drunk, though still coherent. Latika is dressed in the Bell-Boy's jacket and the old lunghi. \nLATIKA Maman's gang will hunt us. You know that? \nINSPECTOR (eventually) Enlighten us Constable. \nCONSTABLE SRINIVAS Accessory to murder, Sir. \nThe Inspector puts his hands in the air, palms up. Simple. \nINSPECTOR Only the finest minds in the Mumbai Police Force. \nUntroubled by irony, Srinivas looks extremely pleased. \nINSPECTOR (CONT'D) Go check the files, Constable. \nSrinivas goes out. \nINSPECTOR (CONT'D) You puzzle me, Slumdog. Admitting murder to avoid a charge of fraud is not exactly clever thinking. Now, why would you do that? \nJamal shrugs. \n(CONTINUED) \n109   CONTINUED:                                            109 \nJAMAL When somebody asks me a question, I tell them the answer. \n110   EXT.

He stands up, walks towards Jamal. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) Please, Sir. Which way? \nSECURITY GUARD I don't know and I don't care. \nThe Guard raises his stick and gives him a roar. Jamal backs away onto the street. The Guard slams the gate shut. Jamal looks despairingly up and down the street at the teeming traffic, the crowds. \nPREM V/O Ready for another question. \nJAMAL V/O Yes. I'm ready. \n111   OMITTED                                                  111 \n112   INT. STUDIO.

DAY.                                         114 \nEighteen year-old Jamal's eyes open. Now with the beginnings of a beard and moustache, Jamal wakes in a tiny shack just big enough for a mattress on the floor. He pulls on a shirt, lifts the mattress and takes out his trousers which have been pressing there all night, puts them over his shoulder, picks up his shoes and goes down a ladder. \n115   INT. SHACK. DAY.                                         115 \nHe descends into a room and two feet of water that is eddying around the ground floor of the shack. Wades out of the door into the narrow lane of the slum. \n116   EXT. SLUM.

Together, they wade to higher ground, put on their trousers and shoes and trudge up to the main road. \n117   INT. CALL CENTRE. NIGHT.                                 117 \nUltra-modern, glass-windowed office. The words Cultural Studies are written on the white board. Jamal walks in with a tray of glasses of chi. He puts a glass down on the young, hip, Teacher's desk and heads out again. \nTEACHER Okay, guys, it's been a big week in UK. Kat is back. \nHe holds up a copy of Radio Times showing Kat from East Enders smiling at them. A collective groan from the Trainees. \nBARDI She's already back. \nTEACHER Bardi...Jamal? \nJAMAL Oh. Well. She did come back, then she went away when Alfie split up with her and now she's back again. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n117   CONTINUED:                                             117 JAMAL (CONT'D) But it looks as if Alfie still fancies Mo after all, so- \nTEACHER - thank you, Jamal. Keep up, Bardi. The chi-wallah knows more than you. \nBardi glares at Jamal. Jamal shrugs apologetically and goes out. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) Okay, it's been super-duper hot for UK this week, so there'll be a lot of chat about that- they love their weather- and there's the festival in Edinburgh- Edinburgh? \nHe points at a young woman Trainee. \nNASREEN Scotland. Kilts, castles, err, haggis? Porridge, the Highlands, mountains. Ben- Ben Nevis? \nJamal searches desperately around, spots a picture of Big Ben. \nJAMAL Loch Big- Loch Ben. Next door to Detective Taggart's flat. \nWOMAN V/O Loch Ben? Och, no, hen, that's one of the wee ones up in the Highlands. You're all the way up there?

I'd like to speak to your supervisor, son. \nJAMAL I don't think that's a good idea. He is a very important man, Mrs Mackintosh- \nWOMAN V/O - get me the supervisor on this line now- \nJAMAL - and he doesn't like bloody time wasters. \nJamal panics, presses the button he saw the Manager press earlier. The screen goes blank, then reboots itself. Jamal looks around. Where the hell is Dave? On the screen, Jamal is faced with the question: \"what name do you require?\" He looks around again, and then with one finger types in the word \"Latika\". He presses enter. Hundred upon hundred of Latikas with their surnames and phone numbers scroll down the page. He erases her name and enters the name Salim K. Malik. Presses enter. Fifteen numbers come up. He stares at the numbers for a long time, then types it into his computer and presses dial. \nMAN V/O Yeah? \nJAMAL Salim? \nMAN V/O Who wants to know? Do you know what bloody time it is? \nClearly not Jamal's brother. Jamal cuts the line. Dials the next number. \n(CONTINUED) \n120   CONTINUED: (3)                                         120 \nMAN V/O (CONT'D) Huh. Hello? \nClearly not his Salim. He cuts the line. Dials again. \nSALIM V/O Hello? Hello? Who is this? \nBut Jamal can't speak. \nSALIM V/O (CONT'D) Hey. Is someone screwing with me? \nSilence. \nSALIM V/O (CONT'D) Who is this? \nJAMAL I am calling from XL 5 Communications Sir. As a valued customer, we are offering you a free upgrade with our `friends and- \nJamal's voice peters out. \nJAMAL (CONT'D) Family. \nSALIM V/O Jamal? Is that you? Brother?

NIGHT.                                 122 \nA flash of a sign post reading `Oxford Circus', pointing down one of the aisles. The banner above that section of the warehouse reads `London'. \nCUT TO: \nJamal hurrying down another `Kings Parade' carrying glasses of tea. He glances up to see a large banner that says `Cambridge'. \nINSPECTOR Not that incredible. You'd just murdered somebody with a Colt 45, after all. \nJAMAL It was self-defence. \nINSPECTOR Let's call it manslaughter, then, shall we? \n126    INT. STUDIO.

Prem presses his computer. \nPREM What sports do you play? \nJAMAL None. \nPREM None. Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear. Not to worry, there's only ten million rupees at stake... Which cricketer has scored the most first class centuries in history. Was it A) Sachin Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C) Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs. \nPrem allows the question to sink in. \nPREM (CONT'D) You've got a cheque for five million rupees in your hands. You've still got two life-lines, Phone A Friend and 50/50. For ten million rupees: pay, play, or bail out. It's still an option. Remember, if you get the answer wrong, you will lose everything like that. \nHe clicks his fingers. \nPREM (CONT'D) Are you sure you want to do this? \n129   EXT. CRICKET GROUND.

DAY.                                  131 \nJamal is riding the construction lift to the top of a high building, still just a shell but buzzing with carpenters, bricklayers, cable-layers. The lift stops at the top. Jamal gets out. Looks around. He is miles up. Alone. \nSALIM Jamal! \nJamal looks around. There is Salim standing on the edge of the building. He saunters over to Jamal, his arms outstretched in theatrical greeting. He is groomed, expensively dressed with the best mobile money can buy dangling from a gold chain around his neck. \nSALIM (CONT'D) God is good, bhai. God is good. \nHe tries to embrace Jamal. With as much force as he can muster, Jamal punches him in the face. Salim takes it. Stands there. Wipes blood from his lip. Gets another punch. Then another and another, not even defending himself, until he is being beaten back by a raging Jamal towards the edge of the building. Finally, he tries to reason with Jamal \nSALIM (CONT'D) Maman's boys were after us. Had to skip. \nJamal keeps on beating him back. \nJAMAL Liar. \n(CONTINUED) \n131    CONTINUED:                                             131 \nSALIM Left a message at reception. Waited weeks for you in Nagpur. \nJAMAL There was no message at reception. \nSALIM Bhai, I left a message. \nSalim opens his arms, defenceless. It would take one, small push to send him over the edge. There is a moment, when Jamal might. He even has his hands on his chest. \nJAMAL I will never forgive you. \nSALIM I know. \nThe fury in Jamal subsides minutely. Finally, he turns away with a roar of frustration. Salim hangs his head. \nCuts the call off and slings the phone in a drawer. Takes the gun from his waist, and throws that in too. Slams the drawer shut with as much force as he can. \n150B   INT.

In the background can be heard the sound of the television. Jamal looks at the knife in his hand, wonders what he might do with it. The sound of Prem's voice on the tv. \nPREM O/S ...if you want a chance to play Who Wants to be a Millionaire, call now...! \nJamal looks up. Stares at the tv. \n152    INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE.

BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                            153 \nJamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens screaming. \nDIRECTOR What's going on? \nPREM He's a cheat. \nDIRECTOR This was you? You called them? \nPrem shrugs. \nDIRECTOR (CONT'D) How d'you know he's cheating? \n(CONTINUED) \n153   CONTINUED:                                             153 \nPREM Oh, come on! Of course he is. He's a bloody village boy. Even when I fed him the wrong answer the little shit got it right. \nDirector stares at him. \nDIRECTOR You gave him an answer? \nPREM Well, I didn't exactly- \nThe Director walks away shaking his head.

And let's be clear about this. Twenty million rupees ride on your answer. You have thirty seconds. Jamal, please read out the question to Latika. \nJAMAL Is that really you? \nLATIKA V/O Yes. \nPREM The question, Jamal. \nJAMAL In Alexandre Dumas' book, The Three Musketeers, two of the musketeers are called Athos and Porthos. What was the name of the third musketeer. Was it A) Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu, C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet. \nSilence.

They move on, past more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex, not in the least perturbed to be interrupted. They reach the end of the landing. From the other side of the door comes the filmi music. Jamal puts his eye to one of the gaps in the slatted door. Through it he can see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music. Latika; though not the rag-picker of before. Now fifteen, she is a beautiful young woman and dressed in a revealing, turquoise, silk sari. \nSALIM Is it her or not? \nHe shoves Jamal out of the way and watches. \nSALIM (CONT'D) Shit, she's sexy, man.... \nThen the music stops, an effeminate man steps into the limited frame Salim can see and snaps a stick down hard on Latika's hand. \nDANCE TEACHER Smile! Flow, flow! You entice with the hands not make chapattis, you gawaar. Again. \nThe man starts the music again and Latika's hands flow elegantly around her head. \nDANCE TEACHER (CONT'D) Lift your feet, you lump. Stop, stop! \nThe stick is raised to hit her but Jamal opens the door. \n100   INT. BROTHEL.

Quick. \nBut Latika remains fixed. \nDANCE TEACHER You silly little boys. Get out now while you can. \nJAMAL Come with us. \nLatika runs to Jamal. But she freezes as she looks at the doorway. Maman, Punnoose and the Woman from downstairs stand there. The skin around Punnoose's eye bears the blisters from the chloroform burn years ago. \nMAMAN Look who we have here, Punnoose. Hello again, Jamal. Salim. Never forget a face. Especially one that I own. \nPUNNOOSE Shall I take them to the marshes? \nMAMAN Whatever you like. Have fun. Just make sure that you dispose of them properly afterwards. No traces, thank you. \nHe turns to Jamal. \nMAMAN (CONT'D) You really thought you could just walk in and take my prize away? Have you any idea how much this little virgin is worth, bhen chod? \nHe fingers Latika's hair. \nMAMAN (CONT'D) Get them out of here. \nPunnoose and the Muscle walk towards Jamal.

Heavy, aren't they? \nSalim straightens up his gun arm. \nSALIM Money. \nMAMAN You can have money. Here. \nMaman gets out his wallet and throws all the money in it on the floor. \nMAMAN (CONT'D) Take it. Go. Disappear with your friend and we'll forget all about this. Okay? \nSalim collects up the money. \n", "test1_true": "MAMAN Oh, Maman can make an exception. \nSalim walks over to the music, turns it up. Picks up a cushion from the bed and walks right up to Maman. \nSALIM Can't take that risk, Maman. Sorry. \nHe wraps the cushion around the gun and pulls the trigger. Or tries to. Nothing happens. There is a frozen moment as they watch him fail to shoot. Everybody watches with surreal interest as Salim fumbles with the pistol. Eventually he looks up, giggles stupidly. \nSALIM (CONT'D) Safety catch. \nShrugs apologetically and shoots. Nobody is more surprised than Maman who crumples onto the floor.

Latika is going through Maman's wallet, Salim is fingering the pistol, admiringly. Jamal is staring out to sea. Each in their own world, yet sharing swigs from a bottle of Johnny Walker. \nLATIKA Shit, there's thousands here. \nSALIM We should be celebrating. \nJAMAL You just killed somebody. \nSALIM He was going to kill us. \nJAMAL Where did you get the gun? \nSALIM Bought it. Now, I'm going to have to throw this beauty in the sea. \nLATIKA You didn't need to kill him. \nSALIM What? Typical. I save your life and you're on at me. All you ever do is mess us up. Whenever you're around- \nJAMAL - shut up, can't you? Just shut up. \nSilence. \nSALIM Why can't you just be happy, huh? \n(CONTINUED) \n101    CONTINUED:                                            101 \nJAMAL Happy? \nSALIM You got what you wanted, didn't you? So, let's celebrate. \nLATIKA Yeah. Let's celebrate. \nShe takes a long swig from the bottle. \nLATIKA (CONT'D) While we can. \nShe nudges Jamal and holds the bottle out to him. Smiles at him. He smiles back, shakes the black dog from his head and takes a long, long drink. Latika and Salim cheer. \n101A   EXT. TULIP STAR.

Walk into another life. Doesn't everyone want that? \nJAMAL You have another life. A rich one. \nLATIKA Who'd have thought it possible? A slum dog, with all this. \nJAMAL Are you happy? \nLATIKA I have five star food, five star clothes. I sleep in a bed, not on the street.

Then the Bookie comes on the line and he turns back to the television. \nJAVED Atcha... \nLatika hurries around the kitchen getting out bread and condiments, whispering while Javed talks on the phone. \nJAMAL Come away with me. \nLATIKA Chutiy\u00e9.

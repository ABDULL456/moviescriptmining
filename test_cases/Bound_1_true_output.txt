VIOLET ...  I needed that. 
CORKY Tell me about it. 
Corky hands her the beer as Violet sits up a bit. 
CORKY Caesar's Mafia, isn't he? 
VIOLET You have to ask? 
CORKY No. 
VIOLET Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business." 
CORKY How did you meet him? 
VIOLET They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it. 
CORKY He's a launderer? 
VIOLET Basically. 
CORKY How long have you been with him? 
VIOLET Almost five years. 
CORKY Five years is a long time. 
VIOLET Yes, it is. 
Corky stares at her beer.  She knows what Violet is thinking. 
CORKY The redistribution of wealth. 
VIOLET What? 
CORKY Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for? 
VIOLET The redistribution of wealth? 
CORKY That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed. 
VIOLET I'm already in your bed. 
CORKY My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me. 
Corky sips her beer. 
CORKY I started stealing when I was little. We were piss-poor, which is not an excuse, just a fact. 
It isn't like her to talk about this, especially with someone she just met. 
CORKY The first time I remember so vividly. A bunch of us kids were at Waxman's Drugstore, when Mr. Waxman, who was a mean old prick, always worrying about us robbing him, dropped a roll of quarters. 
We can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor. 
CORKY I can still hear that sound, those quarters, because right then something clicked inside of me.  Some instinct took over and as everyone, including Waxman, dove down, I reached up and emptied the cash register. 
Violet smiles.  She likes this woman. 
CORKY I gave most of the money to my mom. I told her I found it at the trainyard.  She was so happy she cried, calling me her lucky charm. Fifteen years later, I guess my luck ran out. 
Sbe swallows that with beer. 
CORKY Sometimes I tell myself that I didn't have a choice, that stealing was surviving.  Usually I can admit that's bullshit.  I did it because it was a way out.  It was easy and I was good at it, real good. 
She glances at Violet. 
CORKY I don't usually talk this much.  I guess I have been rehabilitated. 
Violet laughs. 
VIOLET You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to. 
CORKY I guess I wanted to. 
VIOLET I'm glad you did. 
CORKY So am I. 
EXT. PARKING LOT DAY 
Corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools.  Grinning like someone who has been well-laid, she whistles off to work. 
EXT. LOBBY - DAY 
Between the main doors she sees a man.  His name is SHELLY and he is an overdressed accountant. 
He is very nervous, talking to someone through the intercom. 
SHELLY I know he's gone.  Please.  I have to talk to you. 
Fiddling with her keys, Corky recognizes the voice that answers him.

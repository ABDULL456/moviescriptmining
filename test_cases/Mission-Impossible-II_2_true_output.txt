SWANBECK Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done. 
ETHAN She's got no training for this kind of thing. 
SWANBECK Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs. 
Ethan's anger flashes but does his best to contain it. 
ETHAN I don't think I can get her to do it. 
SWANBECK You mean it'll be difficult. 
ETHAN Very. 
SWANBECK Well it's not mission difficult, Hunt. It's mission impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job. 
He pulls out a little Minolta digital camera (identical to the one in Nekhorvich's bag at airport security).  Swanbeck sets it on the table.  Ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye. 
EXT - BAR (NIGHT) 
A grim Ethan, starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever more lively crowd.  as he does: 
STREET VENDOR Senor, senor!  Your flowers. 
The vendor holds up the spring bouquet.  Ethan seems genuinely surprised by them. 
ETHAN Yes.  They're very nice.. 
And he's lost in the crowd, leaving a very puzzled vendor holding the bouquet. 
STILL OF CRASH SITE IN ROCKIES (THRU MINOLTA STILL CAMERA) 
One after the other flashing by.  They are more evocative than specific in their suggestion of an abrupt, fiery, ending, where the lives of hundred are literally and figuratively torn apart and strewn over a desolate landscape. 
NYAH 
carefully places the little Minolta on a glass-topped coffee table.  She's beautifully pulled together, the safehouse has the lights low, flamenco music playing, and when she walks out onto the balcony Ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of champagne chilling.  There's a light breeze the fire from the burning effigies throwing smoke and flame all over the city. 
NYAH What's the population of Seville any idea? 
ETHAN Five, six-hundred thousand. 
NYAH There's nearly 2 million in London. 
ETHAN And six billion in the world. 
NYAH That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that? 
ETHAN Sean Ambrose, for one. 
A long shocked moment.  Nyah laughs. 
NYAH Right... 
INT - SAFEHOUSE (EVE - LATER) 
The pounding beat of the flamenco music seems to fill the room Nyah's back to Ethan: 
NYAH (grimly amused) Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.' 
ETHAN This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah. 
NYAH But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it.. 
She approaches Ethan.  They're inches apart. 
NYAH (cont'd) Come on, out with it.  Tell me to go and insinuate myself back into Sean's life. 
ETHAN Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life. 
NYAH I'd like a little more conviction.. 
ETHAN So would I.  But it's not mine to give. 
NYAH (archness there) You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide? 
ETHAN Something like that. 
With a smile and a wink.

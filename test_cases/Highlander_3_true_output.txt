TAUPIN Neuvich, the clown of the crusades. 
KAHN But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do? 
TAUPIN Offered the Pope one of his whores. 
They LAUGH. 
A JOGGER stops on the gravel and listens to the strange conversation. 
TAUPIN Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope. 
KAHN (sighs) Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now. 
The jogger shakes his head and runs on. 
TAUPIN (serious) He found us even there. 
KAHN He always did. 
52  EXT. ZOO - NIGHT                                                52 
A CLINKING of chain link as Taupin and Kahn climb a fence and tumble into the Washington Zoo. 
TAUPIN I haven't drunk this much since- 
KAHN -Since you last saw me. 
Kahn chucks an empty wine bottle.  An unspecified animal GROWLS sleepily somewhere in the darkness. 
KAHN Come on. 
53  EXT. DISPLAY AREA - NIGHT                                       53 
Taupin and Kahn stumble through an open-air display of Asian animals.  Their VOICES seem to echo everywhere. 
KAHN I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid. 
TAUPIN You were never a kid. 
Kahn leans on the wall of a water buffalo pen. 
KAHN (points at one) I knew his great-grandfather. 
TAUPIN You're insane. 
KAHN No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon. 
TAUPIN How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long? 
KAHN Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time. (beat) You're marking time. 
TAUPIN I've had a few more concerns. 
Kahn jams his hands into his overcoat and starts down the footpath. 
KAHN The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth. 
TAUPIN You're wrong. 
KAHN You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore. 
54  INT. O'REILY'S - NIGHT                                          54 
Late.  The bar is nearly empty. 
No sign of the Knight.  Brenna looks at her watch, sighs, and drops a bill onto the counter. 
55  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                             55 
Brenna has left the bar and is now walking down a dimly lit street. 
She hears something and turns. 
-Nothing.  A breeze rustles the trees above. 
After only a few more paces she hears something again. Brenna abruptly turns. 
-Right into the face of THE KNIGHT. 
Brenna SCREAMS.  The Knight reaches into his leather carrying bag. 
A GROUP OF NOISY TEENAGERS 
Exit a facing townhouse.  The Knight removes his hand from the bag as they spill onto the sidewalk LAUGHING and YELLING.

OTIS What! God damn, how many? 
GRAMPA (watching TV) What? How many? 
OTIS Don't worry about it. 
Otis jumps up and goes over to an old dresser and opens a drawer and pulls out an automatic revolver. 
MOTHER I don't know. I only saw one. 
OTIS I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs... (handing the gun to Mother) ...here, take this. 
MOTHER (takes the gun) What should I do? 
OTIS Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME 
Naish and Willis move through the cluttered back yard of garbage. 
NAISH Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away? 
MR. WILLIS Shhhh... you hear that? 
The soft sound of moaning can be heard. 
NAISH Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from? 
MR. WILLIS Over here, inside the smokehouse. 
Naish and Willis stand in front of a brick smokehouse. The thick door is chained shut. 
NAISH (knocking on door) Anybody in there? 
The moaning gets louder. 
MR. WILLIS We gotta break it open. 
NAISH I ain't got a warrant. 
Willis picks up a broken axe handle and begins prying open the door. 
MR. WILLIS Tell it to my daughter. 
NAISH (grabbing hold to help) Shit... fuck procedure. 
Together they struggle to open the door. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME 
Mother slowly opens the front door. The revolver is behind her back, tucked in her apron strings. 
MOTHER (trying to be sexy) Well hello, officer. 
WYDELL (holding up his badge) Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon. 
MOTHER Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think? 
WYDELL My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
MOTHER Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know. 
WYDELL I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl... (holds up picture) ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her? 
MOTHER Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry. 
She begins to close the door. Wydell stops her. 
WYDELL Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something. 
MOTHER I um... no, I don't think so... 
WYDELL Please, just a minute. 
MOTHER Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all. 
She opens the door.

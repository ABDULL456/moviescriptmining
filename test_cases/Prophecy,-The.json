{"train": "\"THE PROPHECY\" \nScreenplay by \nGregory Widen \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nWith the sound of wind, of sand gritting against glass: \nFADE UP ON: \nA howling dust storm battering the doors and walls of a tiny woodplank church. \nInside, huddled together against the rage outside, are a small group of people. All in black, mostly elderly, they kneel in prayer. \nBefore them, on the cramped altar, lies a man. Dressed in the uniform of a general, surrounded by the silk softness of his casket. \nHe's an old man, far from the crump of battles, consumed now with stillness, listening to the prayers of old people. Of desert wind, moaning through thin wood. \nThe candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless gusts, strains for life, then goes out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT \nIt's not the best part of town and probably never was. A place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad drainage. It's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure enters. \nWearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexican radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze. \nThere's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-coated figure effortlessly pops up onto. Sunglasses focused on the window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, on the railing with the ease of a crow. Or a gargoyle. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nDawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve the alley. The figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle perched on the railing. Watching the window. \nThe shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's movement behind the window. \nThe sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing. \nBEHIND THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW \nIs a room as grim as we expect. Lumpy iron bed, sink that's been pissed into one too many times, and SIMON; a man in a tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary column. \nSimon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening. He whips around to face the window just as it EXPLODES into fragments. \nThe gargoyle LEAPS into the room on the trail of glass. Simon spins and THROWS himself against the intruder. The two STRUGGLE savagely across the room, SMASHING chairs. \nSimon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the back of his skull against the wall. The gargoyle gets his locked fists up and SWINGS them like a war club, SMACKING Simon's face and SPRAWLING him backwards onto the bed. \nThe two, across the room for each other, pause. \nGARGOYLE Where is it? \nSimon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now walking slow circles around each other. \nSIMON Leave me alone. \nGARGOYLE You've found it, haven't you? \nSIMON Fuck you. \nThe gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon, who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS. \nThe gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simon's leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simon up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the first plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath -- \n-- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. Over and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to one side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body around and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the frame and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING a shard of glass through his neck. \nSimon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Pushing his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window. \nThe gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread- eagles thirty feet to the asphalt. \nSomebody turns up their Mexican radio station. \nThe gargoyle's a wreck. \nBut he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing every inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway- speed firebird BOMBING down the alley. \nThe impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him into a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly, bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's windshield. \nTHREE FLOORS ABOVE \nSimon leans against his splintered window and looks down at the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. His own shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing is difficult. Pain flashes across his forehead as he checks that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of his nose. \nAt the sound of a distant siren Simon turns and quickly finishes packing his duffle bag. Stiffly pulling on an oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out. \nDAGGETT (looking at floor) There's glass in the carpet. \nBURROWS That usually happens when you break a window. \nDAGGETT It's on the inside. \nAmongst the glass fragments at Thomas' feet is a pair of dark sunglasses. He picks them up, taps them in his palm, and looks out the window down to the man with no eyes, pinched between brick and chrome. \nDAGGETT Where's Chimney Rock? \nBURROWS Arizona desert, I think. Which is exactly where I'm going to be in two years, three months. \nDAGGETT And give up all this? \nBURROWS You're breaking my heart. \nDISSOLVE SLOWLY TO: \nThe sun sinking beneath the horizon of a vast and undulating expanse of desert. \nTravel through the landscape as the sky purples and darkens and silhouettes tall, finger-like spires of volcanic rock. Hear the coyotes, the wind making its constant, probing search. Before the night swallows it all whole, \nCome upon The Town. \nIt used to be something. But that's long gone. Now, wrapped in the sucking blackness of a wilderness night, it's a shell of a place. \nLights still burn in some of the windows but fool no one. The ghosts are the majority here. Biding their time. Waiting for The Town to surrender and slip beneath the waves of the desert. \nThe wind slinks over the hills, creeps down past boarded-up storefronts, skeletal ocitillo, and the rusting hulks of abandoned mining equipment. The corpse of a summer's kite twists slowly on a power line. \nON THE EDGE OF TOWN \nFrom the inky oblivion of the road, comes a crunch of gravel. \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN \nStands a large, nineteenth century brick schoolhouse. An icon from a more prosperous past, its dark massiveness was meant for scores of ruddy-faced miner's kids. Now it seems to be imploding, eating itself with creeping decay. On this night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner and the faint sound of children's voices in song. \nIt is a hymn. An ancient, Latin one. The melancholy beauty of voices rising and falling in choir. \nINSIDE THE BUILDING \nIs a school auditorium. On the stage, dwarfed by it, are twenty five students from first grade to high school, singing together as a choir. A young woman, KATHERINE, directs their acapella voices as the small group of parents, lonely in the huge room, look on. \nOUTSIDE \nThe voices drift on the night, down the road, and lap against the peeling facade of a storefront. A mortuary. \nINSIDE \nThe rooms are dark but for one. There, bathed in the flickering light of a tall candle, lies the body of the old general we saw at the opening. \nTHE FRONT DOOR \nOf the mortuary has a locked handle that jiggles from outside. A small panes of glass beside it is BROKEN by a hand. \nIN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM \nYoung voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain of centuries. Faces white, Mexican, Navaho. Katherine guides them with soft hands. She smiles in pride. They smile back. Proud. Of her. Of themselves and the beauty coming from their mouths. \nOne small, beautiful navaho girl, MARY, maybe eight, gets a special smile of special friendship from Katherine. \nTHE MORTUARY'S \nFront door now stands ajar in the darkness. Small shards of glass glisten in the carpet. \nINSIDE \nIs the dead General. Even in the bleached ravages of age and death, his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride. \nIt takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize someone is there with him. Simon in his oversized surplus jacket. His arms are folded tightly across his middle, as if in deep cold. But his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his breath is shallow and uneven. He stares at the old man behind sunglasses and takes slow, cautious steps forward into the amber glow. \nHolding out two blood-stained fingers, Simon touches the General's forehead. A new strain crosses his perspiring face. Concentration. \nPlacing his right palm on the General's chin and the left on his forehead, Simon CRACKS OPEN the dead man's mouth. \nIN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM \nThe hymn is reaching its aching climax of medieval longing. \nIN THE MORTUARY \nSimon leans down to the open mouth, and in a voice soft and deeply weary, \nSIMON Qui ex Patre Flioque procedit... \nCORONER Sit. \nThomas obeys as the coroner spreads out a stack of white sheets. \nCORONER Where would you like me to start? \nDAGGETT I think we can skip the cause of death. \nCORONER All right. To begin with, your man has no eyes. \nDAGGETT Weren't stuck in the radiator grill? \nCORONER No, he never had any eyes. We checked the sockets. There's no optic nerve, muscle pores, loose viscus, nothing. \nDAGGETT Huh. \nCORONER We also did a toxicology on his blood: High sodium, elevated selenium, no floating cholesterol platelets, trace ammonia. \nDAGGETT Something wrong with that? \nCORONER No, it's actually pretty common -- for an aborted fetus. \nDAGGETT (rubs eyes) I should have listened to Burrows... \nCORONER We also did a bone section. Wasn't that much trouble since most of them were sticking out of his chest anyway. \nDAGGETT And? \nCORONER When babies grow up their bones get larger by adding calcium layers over the interior haversham canals. Child growth isn't uniform though, comes in spurts that always leave growth rings in the bone. Everybody has them -- except your man. That would, to a hasty observer, seem to indicate he had never been a child. \nDAGGETT I assume you, a cautious and learned observer, of course have an explanation. \nCORONER Not even remotely. Want to hear the last one? \nDAGGETT Not even remotely. \nCORONER He's a hermaphrodite. (Thomas stares at him) -- Has both male and female sex organs. \nDAGGETT Think of the possibilities. \nCORONER Yeah, you can be impotent and frigid all at the same time -- they don't normally work. \nThomas sighs and climbs to his feet. \nDAGGETT Well, I'd love to say thank you, but -- \nCORONER Oh, I also have a bonus prize for you. \nThe coroner opens his desk and pulls out a small, ancient looking leather bound book. \nCORONER Found this sealed in his coat lining. \nThomas turns it over in his hand. \nDAGGETT It's a bible. \nCORONER A pretty old one, I think. \nThomas runs his finger across the gold-leaf cover. \nCORONER We checked it out inside. Thought there might be a name or fingerprint somewhere. All we found was a curled page marking the fourteenth chapter of St. John's Revelations. \nDAGGETT There is no fourteenth chapter to Revelations. \nCORONER Maybe this is the teacher's edition. \nThomas opens the bible and there it is, in Latin, the fourteenth chapter. \nDAGGETT Can I keep this awhile? \nCORONER Sure. \nDAGGETT (beat) Can you sit on all this a few days, Willie? Not circulate the file? I need some time before all the questions start. \nCORONER Oooh, are we breaking the rules again? \nDAGGETT So what else is new? \nINT. POLICE OFFICE \nThomas at his desk, working under a lone gooseneck lamp. He's translating the fourteenth chapter of St. John's Revelations from Latin onto a slip of paper. Finished, he sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and leans back in his chair, alone in the dark. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING \nDISSOLVE TO: \nKatherine's lecturing her students. All twenty-five of them. There's high school age sons of white ranchers, Navaho girls on the edge of puberty, tiny Mexican children. All being taught together in one room. \nIt's dinosaur day. Katherine has a large fossilized bone on her lap. \nKATHERINE This is \"Camposaurus\". Camposaurus was a herbavore, which meant he only ate plants. Camposaur stayed mostly to himself and never bothered anyone. \nThe little girls smile. They like Camposaurus. Katherine holds up another bone fragment. \nKATHERINE This is a leg fragment that belongs to the killer of the plateau, Alosaurus. Alosaurus was a vicious carnivore, which meant he'd eat anything that moved, especially nice, juicy Camposaurs. \nThe little boys grin. They like Alosaurus. \nKATHERINE Both these guys lived together right here on the White Rock plateau eighty million years ago, when this area used to be on the banks of a huge, shallow sea. Remember how we talked about how sedimentation fossilizes bones? That's also what made the hills out behind our town and put the copper in the ground. \nHIGH SCHOOL KID Lot of good that did us. \nKatherine lifts off the desk an ancient 1950s gieger counter and switches it on. It ticks softly when she points it at the dino bone. \nBOY It's radioactive! Like Godzilla! \nKATHERINE Just a tiny bit, Alex. Do you know why? Uranium, that's the rock they use in nuclear power plants -- \nBOY And bombs! \nKATHERINE And bombs Alex, yes, is all through these hills naturally. Millions of years ago the dinosaurs here ate plants and drank water which had uranium in it that became concentrated in their bones, which is exactly how, with Mr. Geiger counter here, we're going to find some. \nThe class CHEERS. \nEXT. HILL - DAY \nWith the brick schoolhouse tiny in the background, Katherine's class trudges its way up the barren, rocky hillside behind the town. The teenage rancher's kids try to make time with the Mexican girls One of the little boys has gotten into a shoving match with a little girl. \nKATHERINE (coming between them) -- Hey. Come on. What's the deal, Brian? \nThe girl folds her arms defiantly. The boy is pissed, embarrassed. \nBRIAN She... \nKATHERINE Yes? \nBRIAN ...She, she called me a \"Dick Head\". \nKATHERINE Sandra? \nSANDRA Well, he is. \nKATHERINE All right, Brian. You get one free insult. Make it good. \nBrian concentrates. \nPAUL You... You're a... Cow Demon! \nKATHERINE (beat) Uh... Okay. Everybody satisfied? (looks at Brian) Cow Demon? \nUP ON THE HILL \nKatherine's given the geiger counter to the little Navaho girl, Mary. Focusing grimly on the rock in front of her, Mary guides the detector over the stones till suddenly it begins clicking softly. \nMARY I got one! I got one! \nThe high school kids come up and help dig. \nKATHERINE Easy... Easy... Don't break it. \nAlmost immediately, an eye socket appears in the dust. \nAs the students carefully brush away the dust, Katherine looks back across the crumbly path. A coyote has crept up onto a near ledge. It just stands there. Watching her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BIG CITY CHURCH \nIt's mostly empty at this time of day and the young man sitting in the pew, staring at the altar, is alone. His name is GABRIEL and he wears jeans, a faded leather jacket, and dark sunglasses, even inside. His thin hair is slicked back and there's an almost feminine quality about him. \nHe sits there a moment longer, staring, then gets up and leaves. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY \nThe alley from the beginning. Gabriel pulls his old, convertible rambler to a stop and walks into the flophouse. \nINT. FLOPHOUSE \nHe comes upstairs to the landing, where the door to the room is covered with a strip of yellow tape: POLICE INVESTIGATION. DO NOT ENTER. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nAn old fifties two-level, Polynesian lamps and glitter stucco, now faded and browinish with water stains. Gabriel, the young man with the sunglasses and leather jacket we last saw kicking down the door at the flophouse, walks up the apartment's stairs to the second level, knocks once, and opens the door. \nTHE APARTMENT INSIDE \nHasn't been very well looked after lately. Either has the occupant. Sitting slumped in a kitchen chair, staring at the floor, he peers through dully yellow eyes that barely seem to register his visitor. \nGABRIEL Gee Jerry, you look like shit. \nThe eyes lift to Gabriel, revealing a pale, bloodless face eaten with dried sores. \nJERRY Leave me alone, Gabriel. \nGABRIEL Soon, pal. Soon. \nGabriel drops into the chair across from Jerry and pushes aside with distaste the maggot-ridden plates of food piled on the table. He reaches his hand out to Jerry. \nGABRIEL Come here. \nJERRY Go away. \nGABRIEL (sing-song, like to a baby) Come here... \nGabriel puts his hand under Jerry's chin and turns the face side to side, examining the cracked, decaying skin and filmy eyes. \nGABRIEL Hmmm. Still a little life left in you. Barely. \nJERRY Fuck you. \nGabriel releases Jerry's chin and slouches down in the chair. \nGABRIEL There's something I want you to do for me. \nJERRY What a surprise. \nGABRIEL Don't be that way. \nJERRY I just want to... Why won't you let me... \nGABRIEL I will, I will. Promise. \nA dark, intestinal looking amber fluid begins to pool out of Jerry's pant leg. \nGABRIEL You need some new clothes, son. \nA tear wells in Jerry's decomposing face. \nGABRIEL Aw come on, don't start. You know how I hate that... \nJERRY I'm so tired. I'm so goddamn tired. \nGABRIEL Watch the profanity. -- Just one more favor. Honest. \nJERRY (deep sigh) What? \nGABRIEL I want you to get something for me. A few personal effects the cops ripped off from the lovely Allenwood Arms on Seventh Street. It'll be sitting in their property room down on San Julian. \nJERRY I'm supposed to just go in there? Like this? \nGABRIEL Give you a bath, put on some decent clothes, (beat) Maybe a very large brim hat, you'll be fine. Just go in between five and five-ten, it's a shift change and nobody'll notice you. \nJERRY How do you know? \nGABRIEL (cocks an eye) C'mon. (tosses yellow ID card onto table) This should be more or less up to date. \nJERRY Got a name this stuff is under? \nGABRIEL John Doe. \nJERRY Why doesn't that surprise me. \nGabriel gets up, pats Jerry on the head, and walks to the door. \nGABRIEL I'll see you tonight. (flips him silver dollar) Here's some bus fare. \nCUT TO: \nThe SLAM of a racquetball against the scarred white wall of an indoor court. It ricochets off the ceiling, hits the back glass partition, and is SLAMMED again. Four players, including Thomas, grunt and sweat across the hardwood floor. It's brutal. Shoulders and knees bang off one another. \nOne of the players falls back, yells to Thomas. \nPLAYER Cover me! Cover me! \nDAGGETT Do you think it's possible that John might have written that extra chapter? \nBILL Who knows? Vichini was the greatest biblical scholar of the age, some claimed he made his own translations from the original writings. Maybe he did find some unknown writings by John. It's possible I suppose. John always was a little negative about angels. All this actually has something to do with an LAPD murder? \nDAGGETT I don't know yet. Maybe. Probably not. \nBILL I hate to break it you, but that particular family spat has been settled for 1,600 years. Nobody loses sleep over it anymore. Honest. \nDAGGETT What did John have against angels? \nBILL Oh, he didn't trust them much. All that running around smiting and killing in the name of the Lord. God's wild bunch. He thought it made them fickle and vain. One click above ghosts. Satan didn't help the image much either. \nDAGGETT Satan? \nBILL Well, he did start as an angel. \nEXT. GYM \nThomas walks Bill out to his car. \nBILL So when are you going to get a real job? \nDAGGETT You mean with the Church? \nBILL You almost did it once. I never saw a seminary student more called to the collar than you. Why didn't you ever become ordained? \nDAGGETT It's a long story. \nBILL You'll have to tell it to me sometime. \nDAGGETT Sometime. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY \nThe building is squat and brick. A non-descrip warehouse that subs as a police evidence storage area. \nThe sun is hard today as it beats down on Jerry's large- brimmed felt hat. Daylight and Jerry don't get along very well. His sunken, filmy eyes squint at its glare. The decayed flesh cracking along his cheeks flames at its touch. He shuffles down the sidewalk, the brackish, amber fluid that gurgles down his leg filling his shoes and leaving behind shiny wet footprints like a snail. \nThere's nobody around the back door and its unlocked. Jerry's shrunken claws pull it open. \nINSIDE \nIs a crush of filing cabinets and erector-set shelves. All of it crammed with low grade stuff. The heroin busts and million dollar currency arrests don't end up here. Here it's all shoe boxes and dusty files. Fragments of small lives forgotten. \nJerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works his way past rack after rack. The single uniform he meets looks only casually at Jerry's lapel ID badge. It's on the third shelf he finds it. John Doe #78. Jerry lifts the box and walks out. \nINT. COUNTY BUILDING BASEMENT \nGabriel steps off the elevator and follows the signs for MEDICAL EXAMINER. Along the way he passes a checkpoint guard. \nGUARD Need a pass, friend. \nGABRIEL I'll just be a second. \nGUARD C'mon... \nGABRIEL Sorry. \nGabriel walks back to the guard, smiles, and KNOCKS him clean out of his chair with the back of his arm. The guard SMACKS against the wall and crumples out of view. \nINT. MORGUE \nTiled floor and refrigerated corpses. Nobody's around when Gabriel enters. He walks over to a file cabinet and removes a thick folder. Then he walks to the big filing cabinets, the ones that hold a body in each drawer. He strolls along, tapping each label till he finds the one he's looking for, slides it open, and looks down at the naked body of the gargoyle. \nHe's been sewed back together. Kind of. Gabriel grabs the eyeless corpse under the armpits and drags him out onto the floor where he pushes the legs together and outstretches the arms, like a crucifix. From his coat Gabriel takes out a small vial of oil and rubs it onto the gargoyle's feet and hands. Anointing them. Then with the tip of his finger, he draws a faint sign of the cross on the forehead, stands, and walks for the door. \nIn the background, as Gabriel leaves, we see the body of the gargoyle BURST into flame. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. KATHERINE'S SCHOOL \nKatherine's students are shuffling back from lunch to their seats, making small talk and paper airplanes. Katherine does a head count, then stops a young boy coming through the door. \nKATHERINE Brian, have you seen Mary? \nBRIAN I think she's out back somewhere. \nKATHERINE (to girl) Allison? \nALLISON We haven't seen her since lunch. \nKATHERINE We're you guys up in the... \nThe girls, Mary's friends, shrug innocently. Katherine sighs. \nShe takes a couple of shy steps toward him. \nSIMON Closer... \nAs she does -- \nCUT TO: \nKatherine, outside the building, rounding up some of the kids who decided to take an impromptu recess. Hustling the last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly. She hears something. Faint coughing. \nKatherine walks back around the side of the building and sees Mary bent over, vomiting. Katherine rushes up to her. \nMARY I don't feel good... \nKATHERINE What's the matter, pumpkin? Did you eat something? (concerned beat) Did he give you something? \nMary coughs up the last of her lunch. \nMARY Can I go home now? \nKatherine wipes off Mary's mouth with a hanky. \nKATHERINE Sure, hon. Let's go. \nEXT. TOWN - DAY \nKatherine drives Mary home, a dusty, tired mobile home slumped among the saguaro and tumbleweed on the edge of town. \nINT. MOBILE HOME \nMary and Katherine pull open the door and enter. Mary's elderly grandmother is sitting watching \"All My Children\". She smiles at Katherine and looks at Mary with concern as the little girl rubs her stomach and explains something in Navaho. \nIN THE BEDROOM \nKatherine helps tuck Mary in bed as her grandmother brings a glass of water. \nKATHERINE I'll have the school send over a doctor. \nThe grandmother sits beside Mary, whispers gently in Navaho, and softly stokes her brow. \nIN THE LIVING ROOM \nKATHERINE (on the phone) ...He's was just laying up there. I thought, with the kids and everything... \nVOICE Most of my boys are up the highway on a tanker spill at the moment. They may be a while. These people are rarely any problem. I'll have a deputy come by tonight or tomorrow and shoo him out. \nKATHERINE He looked hurt. \nVOICE They all do, ma'am. Inside or out, they're all damaged goods. \nIN THE BEDROOM \nAlone and tucked into bed, Mary stares off at something very, very far away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THOMAS'S APARTMENT \nThe sun orange and fading outside his window, Thomas drifts off into a nap on his couch. The phone rings. \nDAGGETT Yeah. \nVOICE It's your friendly coroner. \nDAGGETT Why is my friendly coroner, after a long day at work, calling me at home? \nVOICE I have something you'll want to see. \nDAGGETT I doubt it. \nVOICE No, you'll definitely want to see this. \nINT. MORGUE \nOn the floor is the smoldering, blackened outline of a body. A thick, slimy goo gurgles and pops. The whole room is afoul with acrid smoke. \nCORONER They also took the autopsy file. \nDAGGETT \"They\"? \nCORONER He, she, it. They took it. They also lifted all the physical evidence from the San Julian impound. \nDAGGETT Where was everyone? \nCORONER The cop at the desk is in the hospital as we speak with a broken collarbone. Everyone else was down the hall watching the basketball playoffs. \nGABRIEL Some things are human work, son. Live or dead, human work. Besides, I like you. \nJERRY Lucky moi. \nGabriel suddenly stands on the brakes, SCREECHING the rambler to a dusty stop. He kills the engine and everything is instantly whispering night and coyote howls. Gabriel climbs out and walks to the edge of a cliff. Far below, nestled among the finger-like spires of volcanic cones, lies The Town. Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace. \nGabriel pushes his sunglasses up his nose and smiles. \nGABRIEL I can always smell a graveyard. \nTwo coyotes begin fighting and snarling with each other in the dust nearby. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT \nOn a low hill at the edge of town. Cracked, sinking headstones. The rambler's parked next to a new one, Slim Pickens on the AM, as Jerry digs up the fresh grave marked General Arnold Hawthorne. Gabriel sits perched on the headstone over the grave like a winged creature. \nJERRY I hope you're enjoying this. \nGABRIEL I always enjoy watching you work, Jerry. \nJERRY How did I ever get you in my life? \nGABRIEL Come on, you didn't really want to kill yourself. \nJERRY But I did it, didn't I? I did kill myself. \nGABRIEL Well, yes. Technically. \nJERRY And you're just keeping me alive. \nGABRIEL Letting you die slower. \nJERRY I'm so in your debt. \nGABRIEL Thank you, Jerry. I'm touched. Really. \nJerry's shovel CLANKS onto something hard. He scrapes away the dirt, revealing a coffin lid. With a socket wrench Jerry removes the fastening bolts, then with the edge of his shovel, pries open the lid. \nIt's the ancient, wasted general we saw at the beginning. His medals flash in the moonlight. \nJERRY Not much to look at. \nGABRIEL Ah, but it's not what's on the outside that matters -- \nGabriel leaps off his perch down into the grave. \nGABRIEL -- It's what's on the inside. \nGabriel reaches down, places one hand on the General's forehead, one on his chin, and BREAKS the mouth open. He gazes down into it. Then suddenly stiffens and straightens up. \nGABRIEL (upset) It's not here. \nGabriel frantically look in the ears. Up the nose. \nGABRIEL It's not here! \nJERRY Oooh, bad news for the war effort. \nGABRIEL (spins wildly on him) Shut up!! \nGabriel BANGS the coffin lid in frustration. Tries to think. \nGABRIEL Now, if you were a soul, where would you hide? \nJERRY The hell away from you. \nINT. THOMAS'S APARTMENT \nThe numbers on the clock radio roll over five AM and the news comes on. Thomas stirs in bed, rubs his eyes, and looks out at a sky untouched by any sign of dawn. \nCUT TO: \nIn coat and tie, Thomas sits in his spartan kitchen stirring a coffee when the phone rings. \nFEMALE VOICE Hey little brother. \nDAGGETT (smiles) Hey. How's the world? \nVOICE The world's the usual. Except for a guppy. the world's minus one guppy this morning. \nDAGGETT And Jamie and Mac? \nVOICE They keep asking for Uncle Tommy. The only man that can make stuffed bears talk. \nDAGGETT My one true calling. What's up? \nShe hands them to the Sheriff, who passes them on to Thomas. He flips through the stack, comes up with nothing. The secretary hands another, single sheet to the Sheriff. \nSECRETARY Bobby just called this in from Chimney Rock. \nThomas perks at The Town's name. \nSHERIFF (to Thomas) Sent a car up there this morning. Teacher complained some vagrant was sleeping in her schoolhouse. \nThe Sheriff's brow crinkles in consternation as he reads further. \nSHERIFF (to secretary) Damn it, get Bobby on the phone, Clarice. What the hell is this suppose to be? \nDAGGETT (re report) May I? \nThe Sheriff hands it to him. Glancing at it we pick up words like BURNED, BLACK SLICK, BODY OUTLINE. Thomas copies the name of the school down, gulps his coffee, and shakes the Sheriff's hand. \nDAGGETT Thanks for the coffee. \nSHERIFF (as Thomas turns to leave) Small piece of advice, Lt. Dagget, that I give free of charge to all visiting big city policemen: It's wild country up there. Always has been, always will be. You come across anything that snarls, you call me first, hear? \nDAGGETT I never turn down advice, Sheriff. Especially when it's free. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThomas's sedan passing through the vast, empty land. \nFAR ON THE HORIZON \nA small clump of buildings emerge clinging hopelessly to the earth. The Town. \nEXT. TOWN HOTEL - DAY \nA former miner's hotel, stone walls and sagging wrought iron. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nThomas tosses his bag onto the bed, opens the balcony door, and looks out on the crumbly shale hills, the abandoned prospecting shacks, and the Chuska Mountains, clouds brewing darkly across its shattered back. \nCUT TO: \nA close-up of the circled newspaper obituary for General Hawthorne. The paper lowers and reveals behind it the general's grave. The dirt around the tomb is loose, recently filled. The grave keeper, a young, gangly, drifter type stands nearby with his shovel. \nDAGGETT How long ago was he buried? \nGRAVE KEEPER Which time? \nDAGGETT What do you mean? \nGRAVE KEEPER Somebody dug him up last night. I just finished putting him back. \nDAGGETT Did they take anything? \nGRAVE KEEPER Nothin' on the outside. \nINT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE \nThomas's breath escapes in warm clouds here in the unheated, abandoned part of the building. Rats scurry away from feeding on the dark, human-like stain on the floor as Thomas crouches down beside it. He probes the dried, black, crusty flotsam with his ball-point pen. Just like the burned body back at the morgue. \nFar away you can hear the sounds of children. Of a teacher's voice. \nDOWNSTAIRS \nIt's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders. The creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess. \nThe last one out is Katherine. She's surprised to see Thomas. \nDAGGETT Hello. \nKATHERINE (suspicious) Can I help you with something? \nDAGGETT Tom Dagget. I'm with the police. \nKATHERINE About the guy upstairs? \nDAGGETT I'd like to ask you a few questions. \nKATHERINE I've kinda got my hands full right now. \nDAGGETT I'll just tag along. \nKatherine unlocks a hall cabinet and pulls out a stack of volleyballs. She tosses two to Thomas. \nKATHERINE Here, make yourself useful. \nArms full, she pushes the building door open with her shoulder and backs out into the sunshine. She tosses the balls out to the kids. \nDAGGETT Thanks for the lift. Tomorrow at noon? At the little girl's house? \nKATHERINE First trailer on the highway past town. \nThomas climbs out. \nKATHERINE I must say, Mr. Dagget, that you don't seem very like a police officer to me. \nDAGGETT That's what my bosses keep saying. \nKATHERINE I meant it as a compliment. \nDAGGETT So taken. Goodnight, Miss Henley. \nKATHERINE Goodnight, Tom-from-Los-Angeles. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThomas lying in his hotel bed, flinching through a dream- filled sleep. \nThere's glimpses of shattered images: War. Death. And a small, dark-haired girl. Thomas's eyes open and fix on the ceiling. \nOut his window, perched on the railing of his balcony, is something dark and winged. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe honey warmth of dawn heats the bluish, quiet streets of The Town. Across shale hills and abandoned 19th century miner's shacks, there echoes the faint, clear notes of a trumpet. The bluesy notes drift over narrow dead-end streets, junked cars, and the abandoned copper mine out past the end of town. \nINT. MINE \nDeep in the tunneled rock, past the rusting conveyor belts, Gabriel sits in a small cave blowing Miles Davis on his trumpet. There's just the blanket he sits on and a single candle. Jerry comes around the corner. \nGABRIEL Get any sleep? (Jerry only stares) -- Just kidding. \nEXT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE - MORNING \nAs Katherine climbs out of her pick-up she sees several of her students standing in a circle. Crouched in the center, talking to them, is a man. Gabriel. Jerry stands nearby. \nGabriel is showing a boy his trumpet. Demonstrating where to put his fingers. \nGABRIEL ...There, and there. Now pucker your lips... aim it that way, and just blow a little bit, this is a special trumpet. \nThe boy puffs lightly. The trumpet emits a piercing, clear note that SHATTERS a window high up in the abandoned part of the building. The youngsters whoop and applaud. \nGABRIEL Very good, Timmy. Very good. Here, have a Junior Mint on me. Open up. \nAs Timmy opens his mouth we clearly see Gabriel looking down into it. Looking for something... \nGABRIEL Who's next? \nKatherine approaches the scene warily. The children all beg for their turn. Gabriel selects Sandra, one of Mary's second grade friends, and puts her on his knee. \nGABRIEL And who are you? \nSANDRA Sandra. \nShe can barely get her fingers around the trumpet. \nGABRIEL And did you see the man upstairs, Sandra? \nSANDRA A little. \nGABRIEL Did you talk to him? \nSANDRA No. \nGABRIEL And who did, Sandra. Who talked to the man? \nSANDRA Mary. \nGABRIEL And where is Mary, Sandra? \nSANDRA She isn't here. She's sick. \nGABRIEL You've got very pretty teeth, Sandra. Here, let me see... \nHe gently pushes down her chin with his thumb, opens her mouth, and gazes in. \nKatherine enters the circle. \nKATHERINE What the hell do you think you're doing? \nGabriel looks up, unperturbed, and smiles. \nGABRIEL Just talking to the kids, Ma'am. \nKATHERINE What, pumpkin? \nMARY Then it wouldn't be a secret. \nDAGGETT You're a good friend not to tell, Mary. But I'm a friend of Simon's too. So if you ever want to tell, you can to me. Okay? \nMARY It's a secret... \nMary lowers her head and shuts her eyes. \nMARY ...But sometimes it hurts. \nThomas and Katherine exchange looks. Mary's pretty eyes rise again as she calmly asks, in that cute little eight year old voice: \nMARY Have you ever killed a chinaman? \nDAGGETT No Mary, I haven't. \nMARY They don't bleed. Not the way you and I do. Or maybe it was just the cold... \nThomas looks to Katherine for an explanation, but she's as confused as him. \nMARY I've killed them, you know. Lots. You could always tell when they were coming. There'd be the trumpets first. Every note flat. Then those songs... After that they'd charge. Right down through the snow. The guns would freeze and it would be just knives... It was so cold and there were so many of them. But I was smarter than they were. Even at Chosin, I was smarter... \nMary's been explaining this in a girlish, show-'n-tell kind of way. Suddenly her face cracks as her voice chokes with a sob. \nMARY It scares me, Miss Henley. I hate it. Please, make it stop! \nShe buries herself into Katherine's arms, sobbing. \nMARY Make it stop! \nKATHERINE (rocking her) It's okay... It's okay... \nMary suddenly pushes away and runs back toward the trailer, into the arms of her grandmother. \nKATHERINE I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -- \nGRANDMOTHER It's all right, Miss Henley. We know you love Mary... \nKATHERINE What are we going to do? \nGRANDMOTHER She's going to have the Enemy Ghost Way. We leave this afternoon. \nThe grandmother turns and walks back to the trailer. \nDAGGETT Where will they do the ceremony? \nKATHERINE In the home village. The Hand Trembler must have found corpse sickness... \nDAGGETT They're taking her away? Shouldn't she see a doctor? \nKATHERINE She's already seen a doctor. (then, under her breath) That son of a bitch... \nDAGGETT Who? \nKATHERINE Gabriel the children called him. The little shit was hanging around my kids this morning asking about Mary. He and his buddy make a real pair. \nDAGGETT Maybe it's time I checked out Mr. Gabriel. \nKatherine turns from trailer and looks at him. \nKATHERINE I know where he parks his car. \nINT. THOMAS'S CAR - DAY \nKatherine and Thomas drive back down the road leading to town. \nKATHERINE Chinamen? Chosin? I've never heard her talk like that before. \nDAGGETT Chosin Reservoir was a Korean war battle the Marines had against the Chinese, supposedly the bloodiest hand-to-hand fighting of the century. Someone been teaching that to your class? \nKATHERINE Sure, right next to Jack 'N Jill. \nDAGGETT Where would she have heard it? \nKATHERINE Nobody I can think of. (beat) Maybe one. \nDAGGETT Who? \nKATHERINE General Hawthorne. \nDAGGETT Did she know him? \nKATHERINE He didn't like children. \nEXT. MINE - DAY \nKatherine and Thomas lie in the dust outside the mine's tunnel entrance. Catching their breath. Trying to organize and repair the short circuits in their brains. Thomas rolls on his side, squints at the sun. Katherine's voice is faint and raspy. \nKATHERINE What... What was that? Hell? \nDAGGETT ...No. The voices. They were screaming and fighting over... theology. They don't sweat much about that in hell. But they do in... heaven. \nHe squeezes a handful of dirt in his hands. \nDAGGETT The son of a bitch. He carries it around with him like a photo album. A big, greasy cloud wherever he goes. They all do. \nKATHERINE How can that be heaven? Jesus Christ. How? I don't even believe in heaven. \nThe tears start rolling down her face. She looks up and shouts at the endless sky above them. \nKATHERINE You dumb fucking assholes! How could you have done that! \nDAGGETT That extra chapter by St. John was right. It's a war... Just like the first one. Just like when the angel Michael beat Lucifer and cast him out. Only now they've turned on each other... Turned on each other in a civil war over theology. \nHe laughs hopelessly at the insanity of it all. \nDAGGETT Oh sweet God, theology. (sighs) \"God's wild bunch\". (shouts) God's morons! \nKATHERINE How do you know know so much about that? \nDAGGETT I just know. (shakes his head) Yes folks, the good news is that there's life after death in heaven. The bad news is that it's as screwed up as here. \nKATHERINE They were like us. \nDAGGETT They are us. Aborted children. And they need us. They need our corrupt, dark souls for their fight. They need... \nKATHERINE ...Mary. \nKatherine climbs abruptly to her feet and walks for the car. \nDAGGETT What are you doing? \nKATHERINE I don't know what this is. I don't know what I believe. I don't know if my sanity is lying back in that cave flopping around waiting for me. But I know one thing. Those... Those things aren't taking her! \nINT. THOMAS'S CAR \nKatherine and Thomas drive along in silence. Finally, \nKATHERINE In those... visions... did you ever see... God? \nDAGGETT No. \nKATHERINE Me either. \nINT. MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER \nKatherine and Thomas open the trailer door and enter cautiously. \nKATHERINE Mary? \nThomas looks out the window and notices for the first time, parked behind the trailer, Gabriel's rambler. He immediately pulls out his pistol, runs for the closed door at the end of the hall and KICKS it in. The door FLIES open, revealing Gabriel sitting on the bed beside Mary. \nDAGGETT Get away from her. \nHis gun's leveled at Gabriel's head. The angel sits there impassively, then smiles. \nGABRIEL You know. Son of a bitch, the priest wanna-be actually figured it out. That's a rare club, son. At least down here. \nDAGGETT Back away from the kid, man. Now. \nGABRIEL She won't feel anything, honest. I'll have to tear her apart of course -- just the way it goes -- but it'll be all right in the end. A good catholic boy like you, Mr. Daggett, you should be on my side. \nDAGGETT Goddamn it -- \nGABRIEL You're gonna have to watch that profanity. \nJerry suddenly LEAPS out from behind the door and TACKLES Thomas to the carpet. The gun skitters to one side as Jerry SINKS his rotting teeth into Thomas's shoulder. Thomas cries out and SLAMS his fist against Jerry's head, knocking off an ear. \nGabriel turns back to Mary's frightened face and smiles as he runs a hand through her hair. \nGABRIEL It'll only be a moment... \nKatherine suddenly HAMMERS Gabriel across the side of the head with a chair, KNOCKING him to the floor. As he gets up she HITS him again. \nThomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard against the chest, forcing him off. \nGabriel GRABS both of Katherine's legs and PULLS, CRASHING her flat on her back. \nThomas scrambles for his gun, grabs it, and as Jerry comes at him again spins and FIRES twice. The slugs RIP into Jerry's chest and knock him to his knees. As the putrid, curdled juices pump lumpily out of him, Jerry looks up at Thomas and smiles. \nThe second deputy has walked over to Gabriel. \nDEPUTY Is he alive? \nDEPUTY #2 He's alive. \nDEPUTY Cuff him. We'll take him to the hospital in our car. \nDAGGETT -- No, you don't understand. You have to let me have him -- \nThe volunteer fire engine growls up through the weeds, drowning out Thomas's words. Two firemen kneel down beside him with medical kits. \nThe deputy has walked over to his partner and the two are dragging back between them a cuffed, comatose Gabriel. \nDAGGETT (hoarse, faint) You'll never hold him. \nThomas tries to get up, but the pain and a hand from the firemen keep him down. As the deputies pass, he manages to desperately grab the one's pant cuff. \nDAGGETT Take off his sunglasses... Jesus Christ, just take off his sunglasses... \nGabriel's head lies low between the shoulders. The deputy looks with concern at the firemen. \nFIREMAN (re Thomas) He'll be all right. Just a bad hit. \nThe deputy nods. As they carry on to the car with Gabriel, the angel turns his head slightly and smiles a smile only for Thomas. \nFIREMAN (to partner) Let's get a splint. \nThe patrol car pulls away. As the firemen walk back to their engine, Thomas looks frantically at Katherine. \nDAGGETT We have to get out of here. \nKATHERINE But your head... \nDAGGETT If you want Mary to stay alive past sundown we have to leave, and we have to do it now. \nThey lock eyes. Then Katherine without a word helps Thomas up into the passenger side of the pickup. Mary gathers her grandmother into the pickup's bed and climbs up beside her as Katherine starts the engine. The firemen turn in confusion as the truck peels out of the lot and up onto the road. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nKatherine's truck shoots by. Just before town, near the copper mine, it slows down at a junction. \nAnd there, lying on its side down the embankment, is the sheriff's patrol car. A single, bent tire turns aimlessly. \nKatherine hits the gas and takes the junction that leads away from town, out onto the endless expanse of the plateau. \nINT. TRUCK \nThe bandage on Thomas's forehead covers most of one eye. He closes the other tightly, riding a spasm of pain, before letting his forehead rest against the door glass and gazing out at the empty tracks of land. \nDAGGETT Where are we going? \nKATHERINE Mary's village. \nKatherine looks over her shoulder to Mary's grandmother sitting in the truck bed. She nods in understanding. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nKatherine's pickup passing alone through the wrinkled desert. \nEXT. GAS STATION - DAY \nA trading post with a few pumps, growing orange in the weakening afternoon light. A scruffy dog barks constantly as the teenage Indian sticks the nozzle in Katherine's pickup. Still glassy-eyed with throbbing pain, Thomas takes another handful of aspirin and climbs out of the cab. \nThere's a tiny, weatherbeaten church across the weedy lot from the trading post with a pay phone bolted to it. Thomas crunches across the lot, picks up the receiver, and punches in some numbers. \nTELEPHONE VOICE County Coroner's office, Assistant Coroner Raphael speaking. \nDAGGETT Willie? \nVOICE Tom? \nDAGGETT You weren't crazy, man. \nAnd Thomas hangs up. He backs away from the phone and for the first time notices the church it's attached to. \nINT. CHURCH \nThomas steps inside. It's empty and there's some doubt whether it's been used in a generation. The pews are dusty and scraped, some broken down completely. Thomas sits in one and looks across the space and dust and years to the crucifix hanging behind the altar. \nDAGGETT So what's the deal, huh? \nThe pew creaks and groans as he shifts his weight. \nDAGGETT I mean, do you have any kind of plan here? Cause I'm just about of ideas, friend. \nDAGGETT Yeah, He's certainly a shy son of a bitch, I'll give Him that. \nKATHERINE Maybe we're not supposed to. Maybe that's faith. \nDAGGETT Do you still have faith in anything, Katherine? \nKATHERINE I have faith in Mary. And that I'm going to save that little girl from those creeping things out there. From all of them. \nDAGGETT Maybe you were called to something after all. \nKATHERINE Maybe we both were. \nThe oil lamp wanes and fades. Katherine lays her head on Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds her. They hold each other. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nJohn the bus driver lying fully dressed on his bed asleep. The night breeze through the window, and maybe something else, tickles his nose. His eyes open, blink, turn left, right, then up, \n-- And see Gabriel perched on the headboard, staring down at him. \nGABRIEL Heavy sleeper, John. \nJohn's eyes open wide in shock. Gabriel's skin is blackened and blistered in parts. Whole shards of his shirt are missing. John tries to sit up but Gabriel forces his head back down with his palm. With the ease of a spider he slides down and beside John. \nJOHN Don't -- Don't hurt me, man. My wallet's in the dresser. \nGABRIEL Don't be such a materialist, John. (sees empty bourbon bottle on dresser, sighs) No end to your bad habits. \nJOHN What do you want? \nGABRIEL A moment of your time. \nJOHN You ought to have that nose looked at, man. \nGabriel leans said nose in very close and whispers, \nGABRIEL Where are they, John? Katherine and Mary? Where would they go? \nJOHN What? Mary? I don't know. \nGABRIEL Sure you do. Think hard. \nJOHN No, really. I don't know. The school maybe. \nGABRIEL Now you're not even trying, John. You're Katherine's best friend. She tells you everything. \nJOHN I'm just the driver, y'know? \nGabriel extends a blistered, open palm over John's face. \nGABRIEL I can help you remember, John... \nFROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM \nWe see Gabriel leaning over John as a sickly yellow glow begins to rise and reflect off the walls. Beneath it comes John's worst and deepest screams... \nCUT TO: \nGabriel SPLASHING the soot off his face and arms in a small, institutional bathroom. He looks at himself in the mirror, runs a hand through his hair, and walks out the door into \nA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR \nAt the end of it is the intensive care unit, that institutional purgatory where a small handful of patients, wired and tubed and oxygenated, lay inconclusively between life and death. There's a nurse's station there, all health status video screens and a single nurse that looks up from her work at Gabriel. \nNURSE Can I help you? \nGABRIEL Someone's going to die here soon. I'll just be a minute. \nNURSE There's no visitors allowed in ICU. \nGABRIEL The timing's important. I can smell these things, you know. \nThe nurse reaches for the telephone. Gabriel takes it away from her with one hand and with the other grasps her face open-palmed and whispers, \nGABRIEL Go to sleep. \nThe nurse slides out of her chair and collapses to the floor. Gabriel pulls out the metal clipboards holding each patient's chart and flips through them, tossing one after another aside as unsuitable. \nGABRIEL Recovering... Recovering... Stable... (finally settles on one) Deteriorating critical. \nSatisfied, he steps over to one of the beds, pulls back the curtain and sits down beside an unconscious, middle-aged woman. He watches patiently, listening the beeping scrawl of the EKG above her. \nIt was weak to begin with but now it's faltering badly, becoming the unsynched etchings of a child. A beeping alarm has begun to ring and her breathing is slowing to nothing. At the last possible moment Gabriel places his fingers across her face, whispering to her, coaxing her. \nGABRIEL Whoa, not just yet. Come on back. That's it... \nLUCIFER Don't press your luck, Mr. Daggett. \nAnd you know instantly, in the bottom of your stomach, that those eyes mean it. \nLUCIFER Go and get ready, Thomas. \nThomas hesitates, holds the gaze, then turns and leaves. In an instant Lucifer sweeps down from the hogan roof to Katherine's side. Face and eyes and maggot breath uncomfortably close, he smiles. \nLUCIFER Have you ever considered Katherine, that the great absentee landlord, the soft-eyed eagle scout your childhood prayers are for, is just using you? That you're only the exterminator to get rid of his pests? \nLucifer places a cloaked arm around her shoulder and leads her to the walled edge to look out across the endless plateau. His mouth presses against her ear and whispers, \nLUCIFER God's junkies are coming, Katherine. And when they do, all hell is going to break loose... \nCUT TO: \nA tiny speck on the empty horizon. It grows, takes shape, and finally becomes a red convertible rambler as it WOOSHES past on a desolate throat of forgotten highway. \nGabriel's at the wheel. Beside him, grey-blonde hair streaming out behind her, is Rachael, recently lifted from the file- and-forget section of the hospital ICU. She tilts her head up. Lets the sun warm her pallor. Just a sociopathic angel and his somewhat deceased babe out for a top-down cruise across a sixty million year old desert. \nIt could happen. \nINT. ROADSIDE DINER - DAY \nA reality bruised waitress, Madge, sets down a coffee and milkshake before Gabriel. He downs the shake in one belt. \nGABRIEL Say, Ma'am, any idea where I can find Old Woman Butte? \nMADGE It's on the reservation. \nGABRIEL I don't suppose you could be just a tad more specific. Madge. \nThe waitress' eyes move from the guy with sunglasses and burn marks on his shirt to the woman sitting alone outside in the rambler. \nMADGE Isn't your friend hungry? \nGABRIEL Not for a while, I'm afraid. Funniest thing. \nMadge has a lot of things she misses in her life, but one of them she decides isn't Gabriel. \nMADGE Take 522 to the Sonsela Wash cut- off. First dirt road go left. Twenty, twenty-five miles you'll see it. Big, black and all alone. \nGabriel downs the coffee, stands, and tosses a bill on the counter. \nGABRIEL I doubt we'll meet again. \nMADGE Suits me. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nThomas drags a heavy chain from Katherine's truck and begins fastening it to a post. Lucifer watches perched on a nearby rooftop. \nDAGGETT You could always lend a hand. \nLucifer just smiles or sneers or whatever he does with that hideous mouth. \nINSIDE THE KIVA \nGrey Horse begins laying out his prayer instruments as Mary is prepared with paint and oils. \nOUTSIDE \nKatherine leans against the doorway, nervously watching the horizon. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe sky thinning into uneasy pastels as the sun falls unceremoniously toward the mountains. A few lanterns have been lit, and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants of the Navaho Enemy Ghost Way. \nKatherine's eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into shadow. She stiffens. There, at the end of the earth, appears a silent plume of dust. It could be anybody's car, but it can only be one car. Thomas steps up beside her. \nKATHERINE He's coming. \nThomas sticks his head into the kiva, speaks softly to one of the elderly villagers attending the ceremony. \nDAGGETT Is there any way to speed this up? \nVILLAGER No. \nA fire has been built on the kiva's floor. Through the choking smoke can be seen Mary lying on a mat as Grey Horse chants to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing sand painting beside her. His voice rises and falls in guttural syntax. He's coaxing. Coaxing the alien spirit out of the child. \nDAGGETT Lock the door. \nHe pulls his head out and hands Katherine the pistol. \nDAGGETT Stay inside. It's only one round, so make it count. \nIt's about all one human can take. \nMad with pain and anger and desperation, Thomas manages to climb to a shaky crouch, Rachael still shrieking on his back. Throwing all his weight backward, he JAMS her into the short stone wall. The impact SNAPS her hold and PROPELS her over the wall -- \nAnd two thousand feet down the side of the butte. \nThomas Daggett can only curl up into a ball, gulping shallow, shuddering breaths. \nIN THE VILLAGE \nGabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and KICKS down the plank wood door. No one home. He walks to the second and KICKS its door down. Nothing. \nIN THE KIVA \nMary's ceremony is nearing a crescendo. Grey Horse has donned the colorful mask of the yei god Monster Slayer as the relatives now join in the guttural chants of the Enemy Ghost Way. Through the thick, choking smoke of the ceremonial fire we see Katherine, nervously watching the door. \nIN THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE \nThomas tries hopelessly to make his way back. Stumbling every few steps, he's beyond pain and into driven numbness. It's hopeless though. We know it. \nIN THE VILLAGE \nGabriel KICKS down another door to another empty hogan. There's only one left. As he approaches, from within can be heard the muffled sound of chanting. \nTHOMAS \nTakes a few more fumbling steps and falls again. He reaches out to something metal for support. It's Katherine's pickup. \nGABRIEL \nSteps up to the kiva door and KICKS it. The frame buckles but holds. He steps back a few feet, puts all his weight into a turn, and KICKS again. The door SHATTERS. \nINSIDE \nWood splinters ROCKET through the smoke as Gabriel appears in the doorway. Grey Horse, everyone, freezes. \nGABRIEL Relax folks, it's just a soul. \nFrom out of the smoke steps Katherine. She FIRES, one round, into Gabriel's side. The archangel is pitched against the kiva's wall, where he stays a moment before turning to Katherine. \nGABRIEL I'm getting real tired of you. \nShe stands her ground between him and the child. \nKATHERINE Go to hell. \nGABRIEL Heaven, darling. Heaven. At least get the zip code right. \nKATHERINE It's all the same, isn't it? \nGABRIEL No. In heaven we believe in love. \nKATHERINE And what do you love, Gabriel? \nOnce again, the shade of doubt holds him up. But it's quickly pushed aside for a corrupted grin. He's given up all pretense. \nGABRIEL -- Cracking your skull. \nHe advances on her. \nKATHERINE That's all it is for you anymore, Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing and the burning. You don't work for God anymore. You don't fight for love. \nGABRIEL Shut up! \nAnd he's on her. With his left arm he brutally forces her to her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed, clamp themselves over her face. Katherine's mouth opens in a silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance, flows through her body. \nFrom somewhere outside, there's a sound. \nKatherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to smolder around her. \nWe hear the sound once more, closer, before -- \nThe entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's pickup CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, gets up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catatonic Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look with him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire iron. \nGabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every pore, one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim. \nGABRIEL God loves you, Mary! \nKatherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all her might, DRIVING him to the floor. She turns to Grey Horse, her eyes wild. \nKATHERINE Finish it. \nHe, everyone, just stare. Stunned to stone. \nKATHERINE Finish it! \nMARY I'm okay. \nKatherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her. \nKATHERINE It's going to be okay... We're all going to be okay... \nThe chattering, hissing sycophant grabs Gabriel's body by the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door. Lucifer has remained behind, crouched on his haunches, his liquid, yellow eyes on Katherine. \nKATHERINE I can't quite bring myself to say thank you. \nLUCIFER I understand. \nKATHERINE Then this is done. \nLUCIFER Not necessarily. Maybe I like you. Maybe I want you to come with me. \nHe rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her. \nLUCIFER You owe me, Katherine. And you're going to ask me to take you home. \nKATHERINE (clutching Mary) No. \nLUCIFER You will. You will because any other way is going to be more awful than you can imagine. \nKATHERINE Are you threatening me? \nJust a grinning, twisted stare. \nKATHERINE Then you've picked the wrong person this time. I've just about had it up to here with ghosts. So you can put away the horror movie sneer and the K-Mart halloween eyes, because we know you now. We know you all. And if you want to force the issue then go ahead because you're just another angel to me. Take a look at your buddy Gabriel. Then ask yourself, do you really, really want to fuck with us? \nThe smallest hint of a pause. \nLUCIFER Perhaps another time. \nKATHERINE I'm holding my breath. \nLUCIFER Goodbye, Katherine. For now. \nAnd he's gone. Through the door and into the night. \nMARY Is he coming back? \nKATHERINE I don't think so, honey... I don't think so... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe fullness of day over Old Woman Butte, hot and bright. Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon. \nThe village is full of police vehicles now. Green broncos from the Navaho Tribal Police. Blue and white sheriff department sedans. \nThe Navaho cops are talking with Katherine and Mary. Thomas is sitting on the trunk of a patrol car getting his wounds properly bandaged as the Sheriff we met earlier leans beside him chewing on a wild oat stalk. \nSHERIFF (to deputy bandaging Thomas) Is he going to live? \nDEPUTY With any luck. \nSHERIFF (to Thomas) I thought I told you to give me a call if anything snarled. \nDAGGETT There wasn't a phone. \nSHERIFF Hmmm. \nHe chews some more on his stalk. Looks off at the village. \nSHERIFF This fella, Gabriel... \nDAGGETT Yeah. \nSHERIFF Gabriel what? \nDAGGETT Just Gabriel. \nSHERIFF Pretty violent guy, Gabriel. Even for out here. \nDAGGETT Yeah. \nSHERIFF Caught up with him at the village? \nDAGGETT He caught up with me. \nSHERIFF What were you doing way up here? \nDAGGETT Enemy Ghost Way for Mary Tsosie. \nSHERIFF Indian stuff. \n", "test1_input": "GABRIEL Please, Simon. Get serious. \nGabriel walks over to him. Puts his face close. \nGABRIEL Now. Where's the soul? (beat) You know. So high. Used to reside in the recently departed General Hawthorne. \nSimon doesn't answer. Gabriel shrugs. \nGABRIEL Have it your way, big guy. \nSIMON I do have one question. \nGABRIEL Shoot. \nSIMON Do you even remember what this war's about? \nGabriel pauses, almost thoughtfully. Then he smiles. \nGABRIEL That's hardly the point, is it? \nSIMON I guess I never did get the point. \nGABRIEL Happens. \nSIMON How do you do it, Gabriel? How do you go on and on in this place? \nGABRIEL I like it here, Simon. I always have. \nSIMON I'm so tired... \nGabriel grasps Simon's hand. \nGABRIEL Then join us, Simon. Reject the Nicene Council. We were here first. \nSIMON I can't do it, Gabriel. I don't even know why anymore, but I can't. \nGABRIEL You know the routine. \nSIMON (swallows hard) Yes. \nGabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, claw-like. They press into the flesh. Hard. And harder. Until Simon starts to bleed. \nThen to burn. \nINT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nKatherine startles abruptly in her bed at the faraway sound of Simon's screams. Screams carried either on the wind or her dreams. \nINT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAsleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes. \nINT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT \nGabriel releases his grip on Simon, letting him fall back against the wall, afire. His clothes twist and blacken. His skin creeps and pops. His sunglasses melt and fall away; revealing two hollow pits beneath. Gabriel lifts Simon's entire body up off the floor by just the disintegrating face, and stares into the hollow pits. \nGABRIEL Not yet. \nAnd the fires go out. Gabriel drops the crackling, acrid body onto the floor. Impossibly, through the sizzling mucus and molten hair, it breathes. It gasps in pain. It won't die. \nGABRIEL I can do this for five months, Simon... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE TOWN \nThe skies above lighten and smear blue and red. \nKATHERINE \nFinishes dressing for school, picks up her teaching bag, and crunches out across the gravel to her pick-up. \nINT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING \nGabriel's lizard boots pace back and forth past Simon's writhing, burning body. Gabriel's more jittery now. Losing his patience. He bends down and pulls Simon's face up to his. \nGABRIEL This is getting boring, Simon. \nJERRY Amen. \nGABRIEL Where is it? Where did you put it? \nThe seared skin around Simon's mouth comes off in Gabriel's hand. But Simon is still, even now, silent. \nGABRIEL Where is it! \n", "test1_true": "GABRIEL I'm just about out of tricks here. You're a tough one, friend. Old school. \nHe walks over and places a hand with something like friendship on Simon's charred shoulder. \nGABRIEL God loves you, Simon. \nAnd with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart. Simon's mouth springs open and hisses emptily. Gabriel slips the heart into his pocket and lets go of Simon's shoulder. The body instantly disintegrates and crashes to the floor. \nEXT. THE TOWN - MORNING \nKatherine squints at the morning glare as she drives through town. Pulling into the school's drive she sees, parked at the building's back door, a sheriff's patrol car. \nINT. SCHOOL BUILDING \nKatherine comes up the stairs of the building's abandoned floor, passing the stacks of rotting desks toward where she last saw Simon. There's a bad smell in the air. \nAt a turn stands a deputy that looks up as Katherine approaches. \nDEPUTY You may want to skip this, ma'am. \nKatherine looks past him to where a second deputy crouches down beside... beside something. It's human shaped, but like a shadow. A shadow twisted in agony and slicked with a tarry, smoldering ooze. The smell is overpowering. The crouched deputy has a handkerchief over his mouth. \nCROUCHED DEPUTY God damn... \nDEPUTY (to Katherine) Were any of your students up here? \nKATHERINE Mary... \nEXT. MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY \nKatherine pulls-up and parks. \nINSIDE \nMary is still in bed, droopy-eyed and sweating. Her grandmother is there, and so is an elderly Navaho. He stands beside Mary's side, holding above her body a clenched pouch that he passes slowly back and forth. \nKATHERINE (to grandmother) How is she? \nGRANDMOTHER Same. \nKATHERINE Did the doctor come by? \nGRANDMOTHER He found nothing. But something is in her. I know. Something the Belagaana doctor can't see. The night people have been around two days now. It is a warning. (nods to Navaho man) So we have called the hand trembler. To find if she must have an Enemy Ghost Way. \nThe old man mumbles a soft chant as he moves the pouch back and forth across Mary's body. \nEXT. MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY \nKatherine walks back out toward her pickup. She stops. Thirty yards away, almost invisible in the sage say for the glare of its evil, intelligent eyes, is a coyote. As she feels it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder. Katherine turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of her eye, a glimpse of something very large. \nAnd winged. \nCUT TO: \nA huge semi ROARING deafeningly past on an empty desert highway, KICKING UP a dusty cyclone that drifts over a one- horse gas station and Thomas, sitting there in his car checking a map. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COUNTY BUILDING - DAY \nSmall townish; old adobe and stucco walls, cannon on the front lawn, every door loudly declaring itself a department: SOCIAL SERVICES, COURTS, and, SHERIFF. \nINSIDE \nThe Sheriff's personal office is turn of the century regal, with high beam ceilings and rotating fans. Nothing seems newer than 1940, including the coffee pot the Sheriff pours a mugful from. Trim with glasses, bolo tie and boots, he looks like Barry Goldwater. \nSHERIFF And to what do I owe the thrill of a visit from a So Cal homicide cop? \nHe hands the coffee to Thomas, sitting in a chair beside his solid oak desk. \nDAGGETT Run of of the mill psycho killer body dismemberment on our end. The usual. \nSHERIFF Lovely place, Los Angeles. \nDAGGETT Got a lead I wanted to run down Chimney Rock way. Thought I'd do the courtesy of telling you first. \nSHERIFF Big of you. \nDAGGETT You're welcome to put a babysitter on me if you like. \nThe Sheriff smiles. \nSHERIFF Son, this is the third biggest county in the country, not even counting the 25,000 square mile Indian reservation right next door, and I've got fewer men than just one of your little palm tree precincts to cover all of it. 'Fraid the only help you're gonna get from me, short of another shoot out at the OK Corral, is that cup of coffee in your hand. A middle-aged secretary enters with a stack of paper. \nSECRETARY Here's the last week's watch reports. \n", "test1_id": 2094, "test2_input": "Those sunglasses. Impenetrably dark. Like at the skid row flophouse. \nGABRIEL You're not from here. \nDAGGETT Either are you. \nGABRIEL I'm looking for something. \nDAGGETT Have you found it? \nGABRIEL I will. Have you found what you're looking for? \nDAGGETT I will. \nGABRIEL (appraising him) I don't doubt it. (stands) You'll let me know? When you find it? \nDAGGETT Where are you staying? \nGABRIEL I'm around. \nAnd he walks out, leaving Thomas alone in a place gone suddenly cold. \nINT. THOMAS'S HOTEL \nThere's a note waiting for him at the front desk: \"Her name is Mary Tsosie. You can talk to her at noon tomorrow. I'll be at the VFW hall tonight -- Katherine.\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. VFW HALL - NIGHT \nThomas sticks his head in through the door. \nMICROPHONE VOICE ...B-26... B-26... \nIt's an Indian bingo game. Thomas' eyes drift down the table packed with elderly faces and find Katherine and John the Navaho bus driver. Katherine waves him over. Both her and John are totally obsessed with the game, keeping track of several cards. \nDAGGETT I got your note. \nKATHERINE Have a seat. You need a card. Here, play one of mine. \nDAGGETT No, it's okay. Really -- \nJOHN You must learn to shed your high- strung ways, pale face. You must learn the spirit joy in patience, peace, and making fifty or sixty bucks. \nMICROPHONE VOICE ...G-19... G-19... \nKATHERINE John, this is Mr. Dagget. Says he's with the police, though judging by his coat and basic command of the english language, I don't think it's from anywhere around here. \nDAGGETT (shakes John's hand) Tom. From Los Angeles. \nJOHN That near Oxnard? \nDAGGETT Sort of. \nKATHERINE Long way from home, Tom-from-Los- Angeles. \nMICROPHONE VOICE D-9... D-9... \nThomas lazily glances at his card, his eyes opening suddenly wide. \nDAGGETT -- Hey, wait. I won. I won! \nKATHERINE -- What? No way -- \nJOHN Recount! Recount! \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT \nA Navaho social in full swing -- square dancing. The Indian band on stage plays deeply traditional, inspiring, -- Hank Williams. John easily whirls Katherine around; a steely-eyed, master square dancer. Thomas leans against the wall tugging on a beer. When John releases her for another partner she points at Thomas. \nKATHERINE Your turn. \nDAGGETT Oh, no thanks. \nKATHERINE C'mon, don't be a drip. \nShe leads him out onto the floor. \nDAGGETT I'm not very good at this... \nKATHERINE (as they dance) No, you're not, are you? \nShe smiles. Gets a smile out of him. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT \nCouples drift off the building's porch and into the street to cool off, smoke, and take a few hits off paper bags. John leans against the brick wall, tugs liberally from his paper bag, and exchanges war hoops with some friends across the street. He passes the bag to Katherine and Thomas. \nJOHN So how's our star pupil feeling today? \nKATHERINE Mary? The school doctor came by. Declared it \"Non-specific gastrointestinal disorder\". \nJOHN Latin for \"I don't have the slightest fucking idea\". \nDAGGETT Will she be able to talk with me? \nKATHERINE That's up to her. (to John) Mary's grandmother called a hand trembler. \nJOHN Uh oh. Hocus pocus time. \nDAGGETT Is that serious? \nJOHN Depends what the hand trembler says. People call them in when they think a witch or a Yei is trying to sprinkle corpse sickness in their hogan, or if the Night People have been hanging around too much. Night people screw around a lot, but they're good at warning of evil ghosts. \nDAGGETT Who are the Night People? \nJOHN They come as coyotes. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nThomas sits in the truck's bed as they Katherine drives through town. John, on the near side of royally toasted, has his boot stuck out the passenger window. Thomas looks up at the night sky. At its blaze of stars. \nDAGGETT Beautiful stars out here. \nJohn drinks again from his bottle, rests his head on the open window and looks out. \nJOHN Too much fucking sky in the desert. It pushes on you. (sighs) Sometimes I wonder if anyone in heaven even knows this place is here... \nINT. JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nEarly American bachelor. John collapses onto the couch as Katherine heads for the kitchen. \nKATHERINE Where do you keep the coffee in this joint? \nJOHN Above the stove. \nShe messes with the grounds and filter. Thomas paces the room, looks over the pictures and a few weavings. \nDAGGETT What happens if the hand trembler says a ghost has been... \nJOHN -- Messing with Mary? If you're smart you say thank you very much and forget about it. But if you're heavy traditional, and Mary's people are serious traditional, you have an Enemy Ghost Way. \nDAGGETT What's that? \nJOHN Goddamn expensive. It's a Sing to purify and drive off the corpse sickness. Two days of dancing and ceremony and feeding the whole damn village. Not even to mention hiring the yataallii, if you can even find one these days. And you can bet they don't come cheap. But every clan does it a bit different. Especially Mary's. \nDAGGETT You know them? \nJOHN The Bitter Sky Clan. Hard core reservation. No lights, no running water, no HBO. Their village is out on the edge of Old Woman Butte. Million miles from anything. Witch country. Settled right there in the Dead People Land where no one else would, right on top of the old Anasazi village. They're a dying clan. Just the old ones now. All alone out there in the middle of nothing. (drinks) They can keep it. \nDAGGETT Do people really still believe in it all? Ghosts, Sings, corpse sickness? \nJOHN Depends, I guess. Sometimes you go along because it's a village thing, or you don't want to disappoint grandma. But sometimes, when you're alone out there, far from town, and the wind kicks up and sneaks into your hogan... I don't know. \nJohn closes his eyes and drifts off. Thomas wanders into the kitchen. \nDAGGETT I think John's out for the evening. \nKATHERINE Saturday night in Chimney Rock. \nShe hands him a mug of coffee. \nDAGGETT So how does a person like you end up teaching here? \nKATHERINE When I was younger I used to believe that no matter how much you mucked around in your life, one day, if you listened hard enough, a voice would tell you what you were really cut out to do. And when it didn't show up on schedule I decided to go look for it. And I looked in a lot of places, believe me. I drove that road out there so far that the end became the beginning again. And it was when I got here that I realized there never was going to be a voice. So I stopped looking and took the first job they offered me. That make any sense to you? \nDAGGETT Oh, I know all about voices. Problem is not all of them are very nice. \nKATHERINE How did you end up a cop? \nDAGGETT It was the evil of two lessers. \nKATHERINE Are you always this cryptic? \nDAGGETT No. When you get to know me I can be down right evasive. \nEXT. HOTEL - NIGHT \nKatherine pulls up to drop Thomas off. \n", "test2_id": 2095, "test3_input": "Katherine wanders along the edge of the village, turning up her collar under a blinding mass of stars. There's nothing beyond the village. Not a light, not a sound. Say the wind. It is the icy brush of wind on her body that now whispers. \nVOICE Hello, Katherine. \nLike the wind, it is low and thin and hoarse. Like the wind it seems to come from everywhere. And, like the wind, it is utterly without pity or remorse. \nKatherine turns. \nPerched on the wall behind her in a low crouch is a figure clad entirely in layers of black. Its head and hands are hairless and waxy white. There are eyes in this winged head, but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow. There are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are the eyes. \nKatherine gulps down, with only partial success, the hysteria rising in her throat. \nKATHERINE Oh Lord, I can't do this. I can't do this anymore... \nFIGURE We must talk, Katherine. \nIt's takes all her strength to look upon him. \nKATHERINE You're... You're... (tries to form the word) ...God? \nFIGURE God is love, Katherine. \nThe eyes narrow. Rippling pools of unfathomable evil. \nFIGURE -- I don't love you. \nThere's a crouched silhouette beside the figure. Dimmer. Skinny. A wheezing sycophant. An afterthought. \nKatherine backs away from both of them. \nKATHERINE I can't. I can't do this tonight. Go away. \nFIGURE I can kill you, Katherine. I can lay you out and fill your mouth with your mother's feces. Or I can talk with you. \nKatherine stops. Faces him. \nFIGURE I am here, before you, in a form to put you at ease. \nKATHERINE Good job. \nThe sycophant shivers and ruffles something feathery under its cloak. \nFIGURE I rarely do this in person. I am, perhaps, somewhat out of touch. \nKATHERINE Are you one of them? \nFIGURE No. \nKATHERINE You're not an angel? \nFIGURE Oh, I am an angel. A very special one. The first. The oldest. The naive eagle scout, he once loved me above all others, and I him. It was the only true love for either of us, but like all true love, it couldn't possibly last. \nThe figure cranes his neck around to the horizon beyond them. The movement makes a liquid, snapping sound. \nFIGURE The winged party boys will come, Katherine. They'll come to feed on the guts of your little Mary. \nKATHERINE What do you care? \nFIGURE I have my interests... \nHe turns back to her. \nFIGURE The naive eagle scout, he has his interests too. He even has a place for them, as I do for mine. Big, shiny place. You'd like it. Only it's been empty for a long time. Can't open till after the resurrection. The problem's with the hired help. Always had problems with the hired help. They're arrogant, boastful little pricks. Not like me. What I did I did for love. But they, the winged party boys, even before the park could open for its first customer, they started fighting over the popcorn stand. \nThe figure shifts his perch on the wall. \nFIGURE You see, Katherine, heaven can't start accepting guests till this fight is settled. And without people, there is no heaven. All those good and true souls left mouldering in the ground clutching their H-tickets and waiting and waiting and waiting... Some, lying down there with the worms century after century, they start to get doubts about the whole program. That's when, out of sheer boredom, some of them come to me. Because I'm always open for business. 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Even on Christmas. \nThe figure's face darkens. \nFIGURE Some of the angels cheat. They sneak a few souls in to help with the fight. The really dark ones. And now one of them has found a special soul so wonderfully sick that it might just win it for them. And if one side wins, even the wrong one, then there's no fight. And if there's no fight, there can be a heaven. \nKATHERINE And if there's a heaven? \nFIGURE I'd be very unhappy. (beat) I am here to help you and the little bitch not because I love you, not because I care about you, but because I want this war to go on and on and on. \nThe figure straightens up, stretching its spine. \nFIGURE I bring you the chance to save your Mary, Katherine. And along the way, stop the resurrection. \nKATHERINE How? \nFIGURE Listen when I speak. Now go to bed, Katherine. Tomorrow, I promise you, is a big day. \nINT. HOGAN \n", "test3_true": "DAGGETT Is it over? \nKATHERINE For now.

(beat) How's the head? \nDAGGETT Still attached. Barely. \nShe sits down on the floor beside him. \nKATHERINE Here, I'll change the bandage. \nShe carefully unwraps the blood-soaked gauze. \nKATHERINE Does that hurt? \nDAGGETT No. \nKATHERINE Then I must be doing it wrong. \nShe peels back the compress and dabs the wound. \nKATHERINE I saw the devil tonight. \nDAGGETT How nice. Which one? \nKATHERINE The main one. Satan. Lucifer. The dark angel. You know. \nDAGGETT What did he have to say? \nKATHERINE That he did it all for love. That and I have a choice. Mary's life or a billion souls waiting in the pipeline for heavenland to open. \nDAGGETT You're not kidding, are you? \nKATHERINE No sir. \nDAGGETT Satan? You're sure? \nKATHERINE You had to be there. \nThomas suddenly slams his fist against the wall in anger. \nDAGGETT Why wasn't I! \nKATHERINE We can double date next time if it's that important to you. \nDAGGETT You don't understand, I've spent my whole life... (looks upward) I don't suppose it would occur to anyone in authority to fill me in on what's going on every once in awhile, huh? Shit! \nThe ache in his head's flared up. He leans it back against the wall to ease the pain. \nDAGGETT Did he say anything about the Nicene Council? About the rank of Jesus Christ in the holy Trinity? \nKATHERINE It didn't seem important to him. \nKatherine finishes taping the new bandage. \nKATHERINE Are you a priest? \nDAGGETT A near miss. \nKATHERINE Why? \nDAGGETT It's a long story. \nKATHERINE This may be your last chance to tell it. \nA wind outside rustles through the hogans. \nDAGGETT The other night, you were talking about waiting for a voice to call you to something. Well, let me tell you, the worst thing that can happen to you is to be called to something. Since I can remember a voice from somewhere deep in the Church called me. So loud and so often that by thirteen I knew I was going to be a priest. You know what that's like? My parents, friends, all of them thought I was crazy. But see, I had this voice. The voice that kept coaxing me along, telling me there was a reason. So I entered the seminary and was half way to my starched white collar when my mother, father, and my little brother were wiped out in a car crash. \nHe pauses, the old emotions creeping back up on him. \nDAGGETT I had never asked anything of the voice. Not when the neighborhood kids made fun of me, not when my father looked down at me like some knock-kneed faggot. I never questioned a damn thing. But on the morning I spent looking down at three parallel graves, I asked it one question. Why. Why were these people taken from me? And the voice, that same voice that would wrench me out of my sleep some nights with its jabbering, it was suddenly stone silent. It was the only question I ever asked of it and it just left me hanging in the fucking wind... \nHe blinks back the tears welling in his eye. \nDAGGETT So after that I traded in priest school for homicide school. Because if God wouldn't talk to me the devil sure as hell would, and his ways were a lot easier to understand. \nKATHERINE We've never seen God, have we? Not in any of this. \n", "test3_id": 2096}

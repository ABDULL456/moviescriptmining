{"test1_input": "\"THE PROPHECY\" \nScreenplay by \nGregory Widen \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nWith the sound of wind, of sand gritting against glass: \nFADE UP ON: \nA howling dust storm battering the doors and walls of a tiny woodplank church. \nInside, huddled together against the rage outside, are a small group of people. All in black, mostly elderly, they kneel in prayer. \nBefore them, on the cramped altar, lies a man. Dressed in the uniform of a general, surrounded by the silk softness of his casket. \nHe's an old man, far from the crump of battles, consumed now with stillness, listening to the prayers of old people. Of desert wind, moaning through thin wood. \nThe candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless gusts, strains for life, then goes out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT \nIt's not the best part of town and probably never was. A place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad drainage. It's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure enters. \nWearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexican radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze. \nThere's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-coated figure effortlessly pops up onto. Sunglasses focused on the window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, on the railing with the ease of a crow. Or a gargoyle. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nDawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve the alley. The figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle perched on the railing. Watching the window. \nThe shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's movement behind the window. \nThe sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing. \nBEHIND THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW \nIs a room as grim as we expect. Lumpy iron bed, sink that's been pissed into one too many times, and SIMON; a man in a tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary column. \nSimon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening. He whips around to face the window just as it EXPLODES into fragments. \nThe gargoyle LEAPS into the room on the trail of glass. Simon spins and THROWS himself against the intruder. The two STRUGGLE savagely across the room, SMASHING chairs. \nSimon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the back of his skull against the wall. The gargoyle gets his locked fists up and SWINGS them like a war club, SMACKING Simon's face and SPRAWLING him backwards onto the bed. \nThe two, across the room for each other, pause. \nGARGOYLE Where is it? \nSimon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now walking slow circles around each other. \nSIMON Leave me alone. \nGARGOYLE You've found it, haven't you? \nSIMON Fuck you. \nThe gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon, who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS. \nThe gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simon's leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simon up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the first plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath -- \n-- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. Over and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to one side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body around and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the frame and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING a shard of glass through his neck. \nSimon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Pushing his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window. \nThe gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread- eagles thirty feet to the asphalt. \nSomebody turns up their Mexican radio station. \nThe gargoyle's a wreck. \nBut he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing every inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway- speed firebird BOMBING down the alley. \nThe impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him into a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly, bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's windshield. \nTHREE FLOORS ABOVE \nSimon leans against his splintered window and looks down at the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. His own shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing is difficult. Pain flashes across his forehead as he checks that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of his nose. \nAt the sound of a distant siren Simon turns and quickly finishes packing his duffle bag. Stiffly pulling on an oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out. \n", "test1_true": "The gargoyle, still pinned to the wall by the firebird. \nA FLASH bounces off his skin. Then another. He's being photographed. Go wide and find him in the middle of a police investigation. Bored blue uniforms, yellow barrier tape. The usual. \nA plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits THOMAS DAGGET, thirties, tweed coat and steel notebook. He smiles at a couple of cops, ducks under the yellow barrier, and nods a greeting to an older uniform sergeant, BURROWS. \nTHOMAS DAGGET Hey. \nBURROWS Hey. \nDAGGETT (looks up at sky) Thought those clouds this morning spelled rain for sure, but it's turned into a beautiful day, wouldn't you say, Sergeant Burrows? \nThomas takes a deep, healthy breath. Burrows just stares at him. \nBURROWS I warned you about that cheerful shit. \nDAGGETT Sorry. I'm working on it. \nHe eyes finally make their way to the gargoyle. \nDAGGETT What's the word? \nBURROWS Friend here did a half-gainer with a firebird tuck from the third floor. \nDAGGETT Jumper? \nBURROWS Not unless he decided not to bother opening the window first. \nDAGGETT Drugs? Alcohol? \nBURROWS Well, he wasn't exactly in a condition to walk a chalk line when we got here. You're welcome to try and smell his breath if you like, that is if you can find the mouth. \nDAGGETT Ghouls been by? \nBURROWS On their way. Willie promises a white paper tomorrow. Or Wednesday, depending on his golf game. \nDAGGETT Firebird driver? \nBurrows nods in the direction of a very shook up young man sitting on the curb. \nBURROWS Mr. Jiminez. Was taking a short cut to his job at a packing plant on San Pedro. First thing he remembers about the deceased is several vital organs bouncing off his windshield. \nDAGGETT Have you had him walk a chalk line? \nBURROWS He's straight. Shook up some. \nDAGGETT (looking at gargoyle) Anything on him? \nBURROWS No wallet, license, nothing. He is missing one or two things, though. \nDAGGETT Like? \nBURROWS His eyes. \nDAGGETT (looking at tangled mess) Along with everything else. \nBURROWS We've found everything else -- and what fun that was, let me tell you -- but the eyes are still AWOL. Might just be stuck in the radiator grill. Little weird though. \nDAGGETT What? \nBURROWS Both popping out together like that. Worth a page in my scrapbook. \nINT. FLOPHOUSE \nBurrows and Thomas coming up the stairs. \nDAGGETT Who's the room registered under? \nBURROWS John Smith. \nDAGGETT Anything interesting inside? \nBURROWS There are, what an intelligent, experienced detective like yourself could possibly construe as signs of a struggle. \nThey enter the room, which is, of course, totally trashed. Thomas steps over the splintered furniture. \nBURROWS Naturally nobody saw or heard anything. \nDAGGETT In such a fine establishment as this? \nThomas looks at the splashes of blood, overturned dressers, a newspaper, the \"Chimney Rock Republican\"; one name in its obit section circled. \nBurrows sighs and checks his watch. \nBURROWS Ku San's on fourteenth is still open for another hour. Whatd'ya say we pull out the 'ol \"SUICIDE\" rubber stamp and get some lunch. Rancid chow mein and watered beer for under three bucks. \n", "test1_id": 2094, "test2_input": "DAGGETT Do you think it's possible that John might have written that extra chapter? \nBILL Who knows? Vichini was the greatest biblical scholar of the age, some claimed he made his own translations from the original writings. Maybe he did find some unknown writings by John. It's possible I suppose. John always was a little negative about angels. All this actually has something to do with an LAPD murder? \nDAGGETT I don't know yet. Maybe. Probably not. \nBILL I hate to break it you, but that particular family spat has been settled for 1,600 years. Nobody loses sleep over it anymore. Honest. \nDAGGETT What did John have against angels? \nBILL Oh, he didn't trust them much. All that running around smiting and killing in the name of the Lord. God's wild bunch. He thought it made them fickle and vain. One click above ghosts. Satan didn't help the image much either. \nDAGGETT Satan? \nBILL Well, he did start as an angel. \nEXT. GYM \nThomas walks Bill out to his car. \nBILL So when are you going to get a real job? \nDAGGETT You mean with the Church? \nBILL You almost did it once. I never saw a seminary student more called to the collar than you. Why didn't you ever become ordained? \nDAGGETT It's a long story. \nBILL You'll have to tell it to me sometime. \nDAGGETT Sometime. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY \nThe building is squat and brick. A non-descrip warehouse that subs as a police evidence storage area. \nThe sun is hard today as it beats down on Jerry's large- brimmed felt hat. Daylight and Jerry don't get along very well. His sunken, filmy eyes squint at its glare. The decayed flesh cracking along his cheeks flames at its touch. He shuffles down the sidewalk, the brackish, amber fluid that gurgles down his leg filling his shoes and leaving behind shiny wet footprints like a snail. \nThere's nobody around the back door and its unlocked. Jerry's shrunken claws pull it open. \nINSIDE \nIs a crush of filing cabinets and erector-set shelves. All of it crammed with low grade stuff. The heroin busts and million dollar currency arrests don't end up here. Here it's all shoe boxes and dusty files. Fragments of small lives forgotten. \nJerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works his way past rack after rack. The single uniform he meets looks only casually at Jerry's lapel ID badge. It's on the third shelf he finds it. John Doe #78. Jerry lifts the box and walks out. \nINT. COUNTY BUILDING BASEMENT \nGabriel steps off the elevator and follows the signs for MEDICAL EXAMINER. Along the way he passes a checkpoint guard. \nGUARD Need a pass, friend. \nGABRIEL I'll just be a second. \nGUARD C'mon... \nGABRIEL Sorry. \nGabriel walks back to the guard, smiles, and KNOCKS him clean out of his chair with the back of his arm. The guard SMACKS against the wall and crumples out of view. \nINT. MORGUE \nTiled floor and refrigerated corpses. Nobody's around when Gabriel enters. He walks over to a file cabinet and removes a thick folder. Then he walks to the big filing cabinets, the ones that hold a body in each drawer. He strolls along, tapping each label till he finds the one he's looking for, slides it open, and looks down at the naked body of the gargoyle. \nHe's been sewed back together. Kind of. Gabriel grabs the eyeless corpse under the armpits and drags him out onto the floor where he pushes the legs together and outstretches the arms, like a crucifix. From his coat Gabriel takes out a small vial of oil and rubs it onto the gargoyle's feet and hands. Anointing them. Then with the tip of his finger, he draws a faint sign of the cross on the forehead, stands, and walks for the door. \nIn the background, as Gabriel leaves, we see the body of the gargoyle BURST into flame. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. KATHERINE'S SCHOOL \nKatherine's students are shuffling back from lunch to their seats, making small talk and paper airplanes. Katherine does a head count, then stops a young boy coming through the door. \nKATHERINE Brian, have you seen Mary? \nBRIAN I think she's out back somewhere. \nKATHERINE (to girl) Allison? \nALLISON We haven't seen her since lunch. \nKATHERINE We're you guys up in the... \nThe girls, Mary's friends, shrug innocently. Katherine sighs. \n", "test2_true": "Katherine closes the door behind her. The class immediately erupts into goofing off. The door opens again. \nKATHERINE I mean quiet. \nIN THE ABANDONED PART OF THE BUILDING \nKatherine walks through decayed and rusting halls. \nKATHERINE (calls out) Mary... \nIt's spooky up here. A part of the building Katherine clearly dislikes. \nKATHERINE Mary... (to herself) Shit. \nKatherine calls out Mary's name a few more times, turns a few more corners, and suddenly comes on her. \nKATHERINE Mary? \nMary's sitting beside Simon, the bleeding, ashen-faced man with sunglasses. She's giving Simon a piece of sandwich and a coke. Katherine is instantly wary. \nKATHERINE Mary, come here. \nMARY But Simon and I were -- \nKATHERINE Come here. \nMary reluctantly walks over to Katherine. \nKATHERINE Go back to class. \nMARY But -- \nKATHERINE Go. \nMary frowns, waves once to Simon, and leaves. There's a heaviness to the air around Simon. A kind of buzzing. Katherine blinks her eyes a few times. Focuses. \nSIMON She wasn't doing any harm. \nKATHERINE It's not her I'm worried about. \nSIMON Of course. \nKATHERINE What are you doing here? \nSIMON Small job. Mostly done now. Just passing through. \nKATHERINE This is school property, you can't sleep here. \nSIMON It wasn't part of the plan. Honest. \nKATHERINE (notices blood stains) Are you all right? \nSIMON No. Not really. \nThat buzz. Katherine rubs the side of her temple. \nKATHERINE I'll have to call the police. \nSIMON I wish you wouldn't, but I understand. \nKATHERINE They'll help you. \nSIMON Oh, I rather doubt that. \nKatherine turns and leaves, her footsteps fading. Mary appears again. \nMARY Hi. \nSIMON Hello. I thought you'd left. \nMARY I hid. I'm very clever. \nSIMON I'm sure you are. (beat) You were nice to give me the food. \nMARY I know. \nSIMON I haven't much time, Mary. And since you've been so nice to me, there's something I'd very much like to give to you. \nMARY What? \nSIMON Just for a little while. Something very special. Can you keep it a secret? The biggest secret ever? \nMARY Yes. What is it? \nSIMON Come here, Mary. \n", "test2_id": 2095, "test3_input": "She hands them to the Sheriff, who passes them on to Thomas. He flips through the stack, comes up with nothing. The secretary hands another, single sheet to the Sheriff. \nSECRETARY Bobby just called this in from Chimney Rock. \nThomas perks at The Town's name. \nSHERIFF (to Thomas) Sent a car up there this morning. Teacher complained some vagrant was sleeping in her schoolhouse. \nThe Sheriff's brow crinkles in consternation as he reads further. \nSHERIFF (to secretary) Damn it, get Bobby on the phone, Clarice. What the hell is this suppose to be? \nDAGGETT (re report) May I? \nThe Sheriff hands it to him. Glancing at it we pick up words like BURNED, BLACK SLICK, BODY OUTLINE. Thomas copies the name of the school down, gulps his coffee, and shakes the Sheriff's hand. \nDAGGETT Thanks for the coffee. \nSHERIFF (as Thomas turns to leave) Small piece of advice, Lt. Dagget, that I give free of charge to all visiting big city policemen: It's wild country up there. Always has been, always will be. You come across anything that snarls, you call me first, hear? \nDAGGETT I never turn down advice, Sheriff. Especially when it's free. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThomas's sedan passing through the vast, empty land. \nFAR ON THE HORIZON \nA small clump of buildings emerge clinging hopelessly to the earth. The Town. \nEXT. TOWN HOTEL - DAY \nA former miner's hotel, stone walls and sagging wrought iron. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nThomas tosses his bag onto the bed, opens the balcony door, and looks out on the crumbly shale hills, the abandoned prospecting shacks, and the Chuska Mountains, clouds brewing darkly across its shattered back. \nCUT TO: \nA close-up of the circled newspaper obituary for General Hawthorne. The paper lowers and reveals behind it the general's grave. The dirt around the tomb is loose, recently filled. The grave keeper, a young, gangly, drifter type stands nearby with his shovel. \nDAGGETT How long ago was he buried? \nGRAVE KEEPER Which time? \nDAGGETT What do you mean? \nGRAVE KEEPER Somebody dug him up last night. I just finished putting him back. \nDAGGETT Did they take anything? \nGRAVE KEEPER Nothin' on the outside. \nINT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE \nThomas's breath escapes in warm clouds here in the unheated, abandoned part of the building. Rats scurry away from feeding on the dark, human-like stain on the floor as Thomas crouches down beside it. He probes the dried, black, crusty flotsam with his ball-point pen. Just like the burned body back at the morgue. \nFar away you can hear the sounds of children. Of a teacher's voice. \nDOWNSTAIRS \nIt's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders. The creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess. \nThe last one out is Katherine. She's surprised to see Thomas. \nDAGGETT Hello. \nKATHERINE (suspicious) Can I help you with something? \nDAGGETT Tom Dagget. I'm with the police. \nKATHERINE About the guy upstairs? \nDAGGETT I'd like to ask you a few questions. \nKATHERINE I've kinda got my hands full right now. \nDAGGETT I'll just tag along. \nKatherine unlocks a hall cabinet and pulls out a stack of volleyballs. She tosses two to Thomas. \nKATHERINE Here, make yourself useful. \nArms full, she pushes the building door open with her shoulder and backs out into the sunshine. She tosses the balls out to the kids. \n", "test3_true": "She sits down beside Thomas on the building's stone steps. \nDAGGETT What grade is this? \nKATHERINE All of 'em. \nDAGGETT Town doesn't look that small. \nKATHERINE Nearly all ghosts now. When the copper mine closed it took most of the town with it. We just teach out of this one corner of the schoolhouse now. Rest of it's been abandoned for years. \nDAGGETT You're the only teacher. \nKATHERINE Yup. Just me. (to kid threatening another) -- Randy... \nRANDY But he -- \nKATHERINE Do it again and I'll put your head in the door and slam it. (to Thomas) Love and understanding are important tools in education. \nDAGGETT Clearly. \nThe children skitter back and forth playing. \nDAGGETT The man upstairs, did you talk to him? \nKATHERINE I wanted to know what the hell he was doing there. \nDAGGETT What did he say? \nKATHERINE That it wasn't part of the plan. He looked hurt. Bloody. Like someone had cut him. That happens here. (beat) Was that... stuff... on the floor really him? \nDAGGETT Did any of the children talk to him? \nKATHERINE Yes. \nDAGGETT Who? \nKATHERINE (protective) She's home sick from school today. \nDAGGETT Can I speak with her parents? \nKATHERINE They're dead. She lives with her grandmother. I'll have to ask her. \nDAGGETT All right. (stands, hands her slip of paper) This is my number at the hotel. \nThomas starts away. Pauses. \nDAGGETT Did you know Arnold Hawthorne? \nKATHERINE The General? Saw him here and there. It's a small town. \nDAGGETT Military man? \nKATHERINE About a million years ago. His interests lately were more like gardening and herbal tea. \nDAGGETT Did you go to the funeral? \nKATHERINE Everyone did. He lived here. \nDAGGETT No dark hidden secrets? \nKATHERINE There are no secrets in small towns, Mr. Dagget, dark or otherwise. \nACROSS THE STREET \nUp the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house, is Gabriel. He watches Thomas walk to his car. He watches the children playing, lifting his nose to snort the air, like a coyote. \nINT. THE TOWN LIBRARY \nThomas sifts through some clippings on General Hawthrone. Tactical genius. The man who saved Korea. Brutal. Almost court marshalled a dozen times for his inspired savagery. A truly ruthless man -- who spent the last twenty years quietly tending his garden in a dying town. \nINT. THE TOWN CHURCH \nSmall, simple, and woodplanked. The church we saw at the beginning. Thomas sits there, staring at the candles, the altar, the crucifix. \nHe's alone there. But for a creeping buzz. A feeling in the air. \nGABRIEL'S VOICE It's unusual to see someone of your age in church on a weekday. \nThomas turns in surprise. Gabriel is kneeling in the row behind, inches from his ear. \nGABRIEL Don't get me wrong. I think it's an excellent sign of character. \nThere's something cold and creepy about Gabriel. Out of place in here. There's another sound. Teeth chattering far in the back. Thomas turns and sees Jerry, deep in the shadows of the choir box. Jerry waves. \nGABRIEL Never mind him. He shouldn't even be in here. Least not standing. \n", "test3_id": 2096}

Quinn turns toward Louis. He pulls his katana up to attack position and Louis follows suit. 
ZOEY (tearing up) Wow...yeah goodbye. 
Quinn and Louis charge each other. Zoey doesn't bother to stay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away. 
Quinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant. Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers film. 
We don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at it until we can't tell who is who. 
OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD-AWAY FROM THE BATTLE 
Zoey starts to make a call on her cell phone. 
CLOSE SHOT-CELL PHONE 
She starts to dial 911. Her thumb moves in the position to hit send. 
OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD 
Zoey stops. She slowly puts her phone away. She looks back toward where the battle is going on. 
She starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog. Finally the jog turns into a full run. 
OPEN FIELD 
When she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an empty ninja suit. Zoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana. 
ZOEY (laughs to herself) I am Curious:Yellow (beat) Goodbye boys... 
Zoey stares out into the open field. She feels reborn. She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her beyond the horizon.

TITLE CARD: 70 YEARS LATER 
INT. UNIVERSITY CONFERANCE HALL 
The camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old Zoey. She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front that reads: Marshal University Association of Free Thought. 
ZOEY For years we have thought absence of the impossible indicated that we were exercising free thought. In my experience ladies and gentleman, that's not the case. (beat) Believing in hope my friends, opening yourself up to accepting there might be more than the world around you. That's truly being a free thinker. 
The camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face. 
EXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER 
Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down beside her grandmother. 
JENNIFER Hey Grandma. 
ZOEY Hey...

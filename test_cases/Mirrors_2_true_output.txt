DELIVERYMAN (CONT'D) You have a nice day, Sir... 
Ben shuts the door and examines the UPS box. He's not used to getting many deliveries. He flips it over to see who it is from- 
THE SENDER IS GARY LEWIS... 
Ben grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel. He tears away the cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room table- 
A DOZEN NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS LAND, ALL MIXED UP, ON THE TABLE. 
More or less recent, all the articles relate to the department store and the fire that burned it down... Gary has meticulously cut them out and sent them to Ben. But why? 
52   EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                           52 
Ben's car parks in front of the fence that encloses the entrance to Mayflower. 
He runs into Lorenzo who exits the trailer, ready to go home from work- 
LORENZO I've just been through the craziest day here... No kidding! Your ex- colleagues came to pay us a visit... 
BEN What happened? 
(CONTINUED) 
52   CONTINUED:                                                      52 
LORENZO You know Gary, the guy who was working here before you, the cops found him dead in a subway station in Harlem. I never liked him too much, but poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that... 
BEN Did they mention the cause of death? 
LORENZO No... they wouldn't tell me. 
Lorenzo hands him over the keys. 
LORENZO (CONT'D) Well, Ben? I better get going, Mrs. Sapelli is waiting for me at home. Have a good night at work, Ben. Oh, and by the way, about that leak, they're sending someone over to work at it the beginning of next week. 
BEN Have a good night, Lorenzo. 
Ben remains standing on the landing of the trailer for a moment, his gaze fixed at the department store- 
THE WALLET, THE DREAM, AND NOW, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, THE NEWS OF GARY'S DEATH... ALL THESE STRANGE COINCIDENCES AROUND HIS PREDECESSOR HAVE AWOKEN HIS CURIOSITY AND DOUBT. BEN WANTS TO KNOW... 
53   INT. DAY-NIGHT - MAYFLOWER ENTRANCE HALL                        53 
WIDE SHOT OF MAYFLOWER FIRST FLOOR- 
IN FAST MOTION- FROM THE FINAL HOUR OF DAY TO THE FALL OF NIGHT. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRRORS, LIGHT GIVES WAY TO THE DARKNESS... 
The beam from the flashlight appears in the distance- 
Determined, Ben crosses the entrance hall in the direction of the basement door. 
He goes down- 
54   INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER                                 54 
Ben appears at the bottom of the stairs with his flashlight, and follows the subterranean passageway. 
(CONTINUED) 
54   CONTINUED:                                                       54 
Suddenly he is struck by a frightening feeling of déjà-vu, HE IS IN THE VERY ACT OF RELIVING HIS NIGHTMARE IN DETAIL, STEP BY STEP- 
In the darkness, the rat glides peacefully on the water surface. 
He crosses an intersection and, once again- 
He recognizes the half-visible Psychiatric Department sign on the tiled wall. 
The beam from his flashlight sweeps across the walls and the piping, bringing to light, in the distance- 
THE BROWNISH DAMP-SPOT. 
BEN (to himself) Damn... What is happening to me? 
The moisture has pearled into droplets. Slowly, his hand comes closer. The wall crumbles at the slightest touch... 
Pushed by curiosity, Ben begins to dig a hole in the plaster, just as he had done in his nightmare... 
He hears the echoing sound of streaming water, coming from the other side of the wall. It confirms the existence of a hidden room. 
Ben begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall, creating a large enough opening to access the other side- 
He inspects the interior with his flashlight, revealing- 
THE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE THE OCTAGONAL ROOM, SURROUNDED BY THE MIRRORING WALLS. 
He enters. His image is reflected in all directions and multiplied into infinity. His dream was foreboding. Everything is perfectly identical to the nightmare, with the exception of Gary Lewis- 
The former watchman is not there but... 
ALL OF A SUDDEN, BEHIND HIM, ONE OF BEN'S DUPLICATES IN THE INFINITE REFLECTION TURNS AROUND TO OBSERVE HIM WITH AN ICE COLD GLARE...

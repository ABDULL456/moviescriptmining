As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin. The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues.

In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by the throat via one arm, the gun with the other. \nHANCOCK \n(SUPER-PSYCHOTIC) What are you thinking? The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground - one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt. The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the pavement. \nHOODLUM (fuck me) Shit... \nHANCOCK What are you thinking?! Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS. \nHANCOCK (CONT' D ) Huh?! Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the- Hoodlum's nose. \nHANCOCK (CONY' D) Want to see brain? Huh?! Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside.

I got student loans... Hancock - intense. Is this getting through? \nHOODLUM (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) please. Have a heart, mister. Hancock - the fire inside subsides. Cools to a rational state. He lowers the. Hoodlum. He spits the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the Hoodlum's breast pocket. Walks away. \nINT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT \nIn the closing hours of business, employees pell-mell about in preparation for departure. A group of LADIES form around a display T.V., taking in with frothy wetness every inch of Hancock's footage. They gasp amongst themselves. Horus enters the picture, jacket and thermos. He notices the TV - it's like he can't escape the good news. \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe TV set. More news on the day's activities.

I don't know. A female REPORTER concludes the footage... \nREPORTER \n(FAINTLY) And so we ask... who is this man?

Have a drink. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nHADES - a smoky bar in the armpit of town. NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god. We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain water in Dixie cups. It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen. \nHANCOCK \n(MUTTERING) What he's got to do... a man's got to do it. \nEXT. BAR - NIGHT \nHancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds. We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He peers into the alley. There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl. The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it... \nA COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further violence. Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his legs. A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each other's eyes for answers. The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves it into the light. \nWHORE (the sage) You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're tired... \n(BEAT) and in need. Hancock - his eyes agree. The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes out a MATCHBOOK. Hands it to him. \nWHORE (CONY' D) My business card. (to the phone booth) My office.

SKY - NIGHT \nFrom the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing into the trash cans below. Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans against the building, glazed over with drunkenness. He turns to the only source of light that of a building across the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded- up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic. He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than we think it deserves. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMary swallows. Starts in on the tune. \nMARY \"Once there was a way, to get back homeward. Once there was a way, to get back home.\" \nAARON Oh, mom. \nMARY Shut up. \nEXT.

And I will sing a lullaby...\" And like that, a seamless fade into peace - he sleeps. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nErratic traces of an urban landscape JAG about. Aaron's distorted view of his neighborhood comes sharp and in flashes as he is pursued by his tormentors. Spengler. Erlick. Perceval.

Out of an alley and into the street - Hancock, trenchcoated, inconspicuous, and in pursuit. J \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY \nHorus waits outside - hands in his pockets. He paces uncomfortably. Roheim exits the liquor store, already imbibing from a brown paper BAG. Not a word from Horus. \nROHEIM \n(POST-GULP) This stuff's going to kill me. He gives Horus a glance. Takes another swig. \nROHEIM (CONT' D) \n(CONTINUING) You disapprove, I know. \nHORUS No. \nJ \nROHEIM Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you allow me to drink... to poison myself. Your friend. Without a word of caution. Not a word. Just take it... you take everything. \nHORUS No. \nROHEIM You're afraid to offend. You don't want to be abrasive. Provocative.

He crosses. the street, failing to look both ways... BAH! A UPS truck STRIKES the clueless superhero, sending him across air - towards Mary. \n200 lbs. of superflesh EXPLODES into a JEWELRY display window - just ahead of Mary's path. Glass showers the scene. People \nSCREAM. Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to mere tatters. He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the rubble. Looks at Mary, reposed before him. \nHANCOCK (nothing happened) How are you? In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of steel, STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator. Hancock shrugs a smiles. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nMr. Longfellow rounds the corner and ambles home. He is tired and his face shows it. There to make it worse - Clyde.

It grows in size, getting closer and arriving fast... and gradually, it shapes into Hancock. \nHe swoops into view, straight downward. Pulls on the air brakes and eases into a soft landing - by Mary's side.

Too late. \nMARY I saw it, right? A little cloud. She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains. And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain. Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand touches his. He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring.

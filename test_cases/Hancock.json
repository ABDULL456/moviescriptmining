{"train": "HANCOCK \nWritten by \nVincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan \nFADE IN: BLACK. It's everywhere. It swallows the screen. And so we stare into a sea of BLACK. \nNARRATOR (V.0.) I saw a severed head once. Except for the, paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed. The end came abruptly you could tell 'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence. \"Shh.  ,\" the curled lips attempted. Like it started saying \"shucks\" or \"Shirley\" or... \"shit happens.\" Your eyes don't forget things like that. Like you don't forget the sound animals make when they're humping. Primal. Raw. They endure in you forever because the senses have a brain all their own and they recall long after you've succumbed to the la-la of forgetfulness. (a pregnant beat) Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark it's black, I'll see HIM. \n(BEAT) And it starts all over again. From this blackness, a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky. \nEXT. SKY - NIGHT \nWe are in the eye of a STORM, an angry mass of clo uds raging o f a howling WIND. across the black sky..It brings RAIN and THUNDER an d the swirl An ENTITY emerges from this moist darkness. weather and advances into our scope of visibilityies through the A FLASH, of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky. We SEE the approaching entity as it hovers before us. It's a man. It's a man, plus. It's a SUPERHERO, garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain. This Superhero (30). Unshaven. Disheveled. Worn. A face chiselled with mileage. \nIn the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed nerve, snagged in a fish hook. He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off. He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood. And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land. He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect, engulfed in the dimensions of his cape. The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it. Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT. An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the ruptured orifice as he disappears inside. There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG down the street like loose change. The rain continues its onslaught. \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits, dinner before them. HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as low fat milk. He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an attitude. A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn plate, finding no humor in eggplant. \nMARY The principal did'nothing. Like schoolyard terrorism is no worse than being tardy. What's the matter with education? Back when, you could go to school and learn about Betsy Ross and... mollusks and... not get stabbed on the way home. \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT \nA subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its side and plumes into a wall of white mist. And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his gait. It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck, PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him. He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti- raped subway wall. On the wall, a line of profanity declares that... \n\"YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS.\" He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips into the metal vendor like it was Jello. His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE. Deposits it under his coat. And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets above. At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors. Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we... \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nsee STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water. It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits another set of pots. She's clearing the table. Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes out of his clothes. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHorus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in- the-face body. \nHorns strikes a He-man pose, his biceps in the wind. \nHe removes the Police apparel, plastic. Proceeds to put it on. \nINT. RED \nEYE MOTEL - NIGHT \nFISH How the fuck can I help you sir? \nSUPERHERO A room. \nHis blood-shot eyes mean it. Fish turns to the back wall. Grabs a random KEY from a nail. \nFISH Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front. (re: the check-in sheet) And your John Hancock makes it sweet. The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles \nHANCOCK on the dotted line. Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's grab. \nFISH (CONT'D) I don't take messages, I don't do favors, and I don't know you from Jack. You want sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra. Plunger's extra. \nHANCOCK I need quiet. Is it quiet? \nFISH Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public library to you? The girls work. Some of them scream, some of them moan... \n(SMILES) and some of them just kinda lay there cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls you can stick in your ear. They're extra. \nHancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it under the window. \nAnd while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly. \nHancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and CLINKS off the counter. Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - DAY \nMorning brings a cease-fire on precipitation. The streets glimmer from puddles left behind from the night. The overcast sky - its precarious rain formation indicates that the storm is far from over. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nA SUPERMAN lunchbox perches on the kitchen table. Mother and son prepare for school. Aaron adjusts his raincoat, looking disturbed. \nMary parts his hair, Straightens his shirt. _the complete morning routine.

Wipes his mouth. \nHORUS I just made the last run. He helps the old man to his feet. \nROHEIM You're a good man. \nINT. RED EYE MOTEL (7F) - DAY \nAn ASHTRAY buried under a mountain of butts. A bed unslept. The TV is on, commercialing some spring-fresh vaginal wash. The room sits empty. But the bathroom door is open. Inside, the supersuit peeled down to his waist, Hancock shaves. \nHANCOCK (mumbling; rehearsing) it's about responsibility... with what is empowered in you... to correct the ills of man. No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to sleep. \nHANCOCK (CONT'D) \n(AGAIN) it's about responsibility... Hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink - pulls out a BOTTLE of 409 all-purpose cleaner... On the tube, the commercial segues way into... \nT.V. (O.S.) \n(FAINTLY) And on the world front, heavy fighting continues in Angola as rebel forces storm... regime... under the military stronghold... The SOUND of machine guns CRACKLE amidst mortar explosions and civil destruction. Hancock listens - it disturbs him. He whirls around, accosts the TV Rips it from the wall, throws it out the window. And a CRASH eradicates images of war and chaos. He returns to the bathroom. To the mirror. Proceeds to spray his teeth with 409... \nEXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - DAY \nAARON (about to break) You were late. \nMARY I was held up... \nAARON The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit. \nMARY .at the bank. Honey, were they the same ones? Don't cry. \nAARON Get a grip, mom. They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the stairs. \nEXT. APARTMENT - DAY \nThe door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying. Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by Horus, sleep still on his face. \nHORUS How was your day? Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUILDING - DAY \nJust your average professional building, several stories of brick and cement. \nBut all is not well with this typically normal picture. On the top floor, outside and on the ledge - a JUMPER stands poised before blood and concrete. His TIE flaps in the wind. From an adjacent window, a SECRETARY, a FIREMAN attempt to get him down. \nJUMPER' \n(SELF-PITY) People ignore me. From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window across the street. \nFIREMAN Mr. Fisher. \nSECRETARY (through her teeth) You're not unattractive. \nFIREMAN Baldness is not fatal. \nJUMPER My wife ignores me. \nFIREMAN Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher. \nSECRETARY We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls acknowledge you, we all do. \nJUMPER No. \nSECRETARY Yes. \nJUMPER Really? The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING across the street. The secretary points... \nEXT. OPPOSITE BUILDING - DAY \nThere... \non the top floor, outside and on the ledge - the baby seen earlier, diaper-clad, crawls precariously on the rim of doom. His mother's FREAKING from the window. Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his lonesome. The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole, dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric. Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice. On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls the infant down. But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete. He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior. We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose- diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nAn apartment building engulfed in FLAMES. FIRE TRUCKS don't even bother with the hoses - it's too late. Around them, TENANTS bemoan the loss of... Like a wrecking ball, Hancock BURSTS through the burning rubble and surfaces clean on the other side of the building. Blanketed under his cape are two little TODDLERS, and a young WOMAN in bra and panties. He lowers them to safety. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nWe're in the hallway. Where Horus kneels. He's bent listening into Aaron's bedroom, in his security clothes. By the TV and in her apron, Mary watches the news... \nNEWS . paramedics have taken the rescued tenants to County General for smoke inhalation but no serious injuries reported thanks to the superheroics of this mystery man... \nWe see FOOTAGE of the dramatic fire rescue: Hancock recovering tenants from the pyre - plebs and dwellers cheer in exaggerated astonishment. \nHORUS (to Mary) Mary? Mary blinks back her attention. \nVOICE (O.S.) How about spreading some of that joy? Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own slimy kind of way. In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a gun to Hancock's temple. \nHOODLUM \n(PSYCHOTIC) Better yet, why don't I just take it... Hancock - enraged. In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by the throat via one arm, the gun with the other. \nHANCOCK \n(SUPER-PSYCHOTIC) What are you thinking? The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground - one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt. The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the pavement. \nHOODLUM (fuck me) Shit... \nHANCOCK What are you thinking?! Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS. \nHANCOCK (CONT' D ) Huh?! Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the- Hoodlum's nose. \nHANCOCK (CONY' D) Want to see brain? Huh?! Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside. Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth. The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants. \nHOODLUM (with his mouth full) Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a wife. I got student loans... Hancock - intense. Is this getting through? \nHOODLUM (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) please. Have a heart, mister. Hancock - the fire inside subsides. Cools to a rational state. He lowers the. Hoodlum. He spits the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the Hoodlum's breast pocket. Walks away. \nINT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT \nIn the closing hours of business, employees pell-mell about in preparation for departure. A group of LADIES form around a display T.V., taking in with frothy wetness every inch of Hancock's footage. They gasp amongst themselves. Horus enters the picture, jacket and thermos. He notices the TV - it's like he can't escape the good news. \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe TV set. More news on the day's activities. Mary sits mesmerized on the sofa, holding a dish she had planned to dry. Aaron surfaces from the hallway, lured out by the TV He comes up behind Mary - his black eyes on the news. \nMARY \n(SURPRISED) You're still up. \nAARON Can't sleep. He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother. They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this man. \nAARON (CONT' D) \n(IMPRESSED) That's him? \nMARY There's something about him... I don't know. A female REPORTER concludes the footage... \nREPORTER \n(FAINTLY) And so we ask... who is this man? Speculation abounds - government super- experiment, an aberration of nature, or extraterrestrial renegade? Who are you? Where are you now, superguy? Call me. \n(SMILES) We'll get together. Have a drink. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nHADES - a smoky bar in the armpit of town. NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god. We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain water in Dixie cups. It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen. \nHANCOCK \n(MUTTERING) What he's got to do... a man's got to do it. \nEXT. BAR - NIGHT \nHancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds. We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He peers into the alley. There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl. The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it... \nA COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further violence. Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his legs. A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each other's eyes for answers. The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves it into the light. \nWHORE (the sage) You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're tired... \n(BEAT) and in need. Hancock - his eyes agree. The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes out a MATCHBOOK. Hands it to him. \nWHORE (CONY' D) My business card. (to the phone booth) My office. Hancock inspects the matchbook - 555-GINA, etched inside. \nSPENGLER 'Less he can walk through wall. \nERLICK Fuck... squeeze through brick. \nPERCEVAL (just arriving) Let's rock it up. They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just the brick wall and a trash can. They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash can. He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing. That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron hovers - under Hancock's capable arm. In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them away. \nEXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY \nMary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her bladder's going to break. \nMARY (checking watch) No... no... no! \nEXT. ROOFTOP - DAY \nA secluded view of the city, high above. Hancock, Aaron under his arms, rides a light breeze - and then lands. Aaron scampers away. Turns and faces the man. Hancock examines the boy's face, the black eyes. He shakes his head. Disappointed. He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it. \nHANCOCK You smoke? \nAARON What? \nHANCOCK Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid. (beat; takes a puff) Smoke no evil. Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner. \nHANCOCK (CONT'D) (re: cigarette) Ever curious... .what it's like? Aaron shakes his head. \nHANCOCK (CONT'D) (hands it to.him) Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't kill you. Once. Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on it. Doubles over, coughing. \nHANCOCK (CONT'D) Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your first stick. Then, after a few more... it starts getting this. flavor. A little nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only now, it takes a whole pack to get there.., and you won't settle till your, mouth's as sweet. Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing philosophical. \nHANCOCK (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) From manure to pure cane sugar. That's change. Today... you're a boy. Tomorrow, Mr. Penis comes knocking. Shakes your hand. Takes you for a walk... and tells you about life's simple pleasures. You're a man. And you don't look back.. \n(BEAT) You see... things evolve. Nothing is wholly inert. A step in any direction... you're walking into pockets of evolution. That is living... taking those steps. And change. Can start by changing some principles. Blank best describes Aaron's face. \nAARON Principles? \nHANCOCK Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just about all you need to know: a man's got to do what a man's got to do. (beat; smokes) I look at your face, the shiners. You took a shove and you let it go clean. Not good. That's a formula for future abuse... an invitation to the loser's dance. Letting it go. Walking away. ,(shakes head) Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're running, looking for a place to hide. \nAARON What am I suppose to do? \nHANCOCK You do what is necessary. \nAARON I wanted... there were three of them. \nHANCOCK What is necessary. \n(HEAT) Let me tell you something, kid. There was this infantry unit, you see... badly outnumbered. (thinks about it) Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A fox and he's walking through what, the woods, the forests, right? Next thing the fox knows, he's staring down a pack of... hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this chase, the fox's running his ass off, over boulders and through streams and, but the damn hounds are still on his tail. Finally the fox comes to this cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a seven hundred foot drop onto jagged rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds are closing in and they're going to tear him to pieces. So what does he think... \"I jump and I die for sure. I stay, confront them and I'll get my ass butchered.\" Decision time. He thinks, \"stay and least I'd have something, a chance. \n(MORE) \nHANCOCK (CONT'D) To slip away, maybe.\" The fox decides to go down fighting, make a stand. Right? \n(BEAT) The hounds come. What do you think happens? \nAARON (thinking about it) He gets away. Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke. \nHANCOCK No. The fox gets his ass kicked and some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs, like cheap fabric. \nAARON What're you saying? \nHANCOCK But you know, when the last hound was through with him,-and he's walking away, he hears this noise. It's the fox and he's muttering something under his breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets up close. To hear what he's saying. You know what the fox's saying... just before he keels off? Aaron - negative. \nHANCOCK (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) Now he's gurgling, choking on his own blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying next to his entrails, you know... and you know what he says? (raises his fist in the air) \"No regrets.\" \nAARON What? \nHANCOCK No regrets. You make a decision and you stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And \"no regrets.\" Aaron - submitting it to memory. \nAARON (CONT'D) Good arm. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLater. \nHANCOCK not about the labor... or the love of it. (beat; we've heard this before) .It's about responsibility... with what is empowered in you. The gift of might. Might to.do what? Exploitation, because you can? Or a different path. To purvey justice. To correct the ills of man... because I can. Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are charmed, his words secondary to his charisma. Horus, the quiet observer, observes. \nHANCOCK (CONY' D) \n(CONTINUING) so, a job? Yes. And no. It's about... essence. The essence of the man... not his clothes. It's the job. Take away the arm,. the leg..., his bodily possessions but not his trade, his profession. That case, you strip him of what he is... a man. Horus a firm grasp of the concept. \nHANCOCK (CONY' D) What line of work are you in, Mr. Longfellow? \nHORUS (clearing throat) Oh, it's not like you... what you do or anything. A department store over on Third. \nMARY Horus is in the securities business. \nHORUS I'm a security guard. I'm just... \nAaron rises from the table. Goes over to the fridge. \nMARY It's a large department store, over a couple million in merchandise... stereos, jewelry. On three floors. \nHORUS It's a night job. I sit around. \nHANCOCK You're a security guard. You keep the state of things. It's a job. You do it. \n(PAUSE) We're in the same business. Aaron returns with the ketchup bottle. A frozen moment while Horus ponders the implications. He stares at the BOTTLE. \nHANCOCK (CONT'D) Aaron, could you show me the restroom? Aaron points first door in the hall. \nAARON On the right. He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family. \nAARON (CONT' D) What do you think, mom? \nMARY (in a whisper) Horus, what do I do? \nHORUS (at his watch) I need to get ready. \nAARON mom? \nMARY (to Horus) What do I do with him... when you're gone? I have to entertain this super... She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the participants. \nIt comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the surface tension.of water. LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism from which it is generated. The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished faces - mouths agape. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLater,. by a few minutes. \nHANCOCK (lost; sombre) and you could see the flames, through the storm... I get there, the vessel's all over, spread across three miles of South Pacific. Bodies floating in the water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns out, the only one alive was the captain, up against a buoy... crying 'cause he didn't go down with his men... and he's got to live with it. \n(BEAT) Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard in a parking lot a couple months after. A good man... (at Aaron) . did what he had to do. A brief moment while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron's smitten. Mary, a mixture of repulsion and fascination. \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIn the kitchen, in the sink, stacks of plates indicate that dinner is through. Company has moved into the living room, with the exception of Horus. Aaron kneels besides Hancock. Mary, across from him. \nAARON (making a fist) I wanted to kill him. \nMARY Aaron. \nAARON I want to deck him, just once. So bad I tense up... like I can't even move. \nMARY (to Hancock) He comes home crying. \nAARON Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off. \nHANCOCK \nADAMS Games. I don't need it. \nRUTGER Fuck games, fuck dames. \nADAMS I got a'wife, I don't need the aggravation... \nRUTGER Take a donut hole. The entrance. Horus wanders in, lost in this environment. He finds the front counter. The cops watch him. \nHORUS A cup of coffee, please. Holly takes the order. Leaves to fetch it. \nADAMS (O.S.) Longfellow. \nHORUS (turns; with dread) How are you, John? \n(RUTGER) Frank? \nADAMS (god, I'm funny) Observe anything worth recording, lately? \nHORUS You know... things are slow. \nRUTGER Not for Samsone Electronics on fifth. Got hit on Thursday. \nADAMS The guard, he was cut-up like a piece of meat. \nRUTGER Anything go wrong, you make sure you notify us, the authorities. No heroics without a license. You know the procedure. Horus - he knows the procedure. \nADAMS Of course he does. \nRUTGER Of course. Holly returns with the coffee. Hands it to Horus - free of charge. From the back, Soon-yi intervenes... \nSOON-YI He no have gun. Not copper. \nHOLLY Oh, I thought... \nSOON-YI He regular guy. Sixty-five cents for regular.guy. Horus - somebody shoot him. \nINT. AARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMary's folding clothes by the dresser, busy with thought. Aaron squats on the bed, his brain going a mile a minute. He plops back against the bed. Brings his hand up to his face. Makes a fist. Thinking. Wondering. \nMARY What're you doing? She's taken by this scene. \nAARON (releases fist) Thinking. Mary goes over to the bed. Sits. \nMARY About him? \nAARON No. Not really. Are you? \nMARY No. They're lying through their collective teeth. \nAARON Me neither. I was thinking.., about tomorrow. \nMARY Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better... \nAARON I know, mom... after a good night sleep. He says that but he's the one working every night. Does that mean he never feels better? He's always feeling terrible? \nMARY \n(AMUSED) Go to bed, anyway. She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the door... \nAARON Mom? She turns. \nAARON (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) Who is Mr. Penis? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHEEPSHEAD - NIGHT \nEXT. APARTMENT - DAY \nThe Longfellow's apartment.- seem from above. Clyde exits the building in his morning robe., Takes hold of the newspaper. Digs through it... Mary and Aaron - they exit, surprising Clyde. Mary gestures at Clyde, pointing an accusing finger. She seizes the paper from him, sending him cowering inside. \nEXT. SCHOOLYARD DAY \nMary and Aaron - by the perimeter fence. \nMARY Have a good one. \nAARON I got to do what I got to do. She watches him go -curious. \nEXT. SKY - DAY \nThe sky's POV - the schoolyard. Aaron - sauntering to class. Mary - turning, walking away. We soar through air and mist. Circle a street below. Hover over an alley. Descend from the clouds - into the depths of buildings and fire escapes. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nMary, among other pedestrians, head homeward. Her pace say she's in no hurry to get there. Out of an alley and into the street - Hancock, trenchcoated, inconspicuous, and in pursuit. J \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY \nHorus waits outside - hands in his pockets. He paces uncomfortably. Roheim exits the liquor store, already imbibing from a brown paper BAG. Not a word from Horus. \nROHEIM \n(POST-GULP) This stuff's going to kill me. He gives Horus a glance. Takes another swig. \nROHEIM (CONT' D) \n(CONTINUING) You disapprove, I know. \nHORUS No. \nJ \nROHEIM Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you allow me to drink... to poison myself. Your friend. Without a word of caution. Not a word. Just take it... you take everything. \nHORUS No. \nROHEIM You're afraid to offend. You don't want to be abrasive. Provocative. (beat; as'Horus squirms) So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it. Roheim takes another gulp. \nHORUS (pulling teeth) You shouldn't drink. \nROHEIM My wife. She left a bad taste in my mouth. I drink to kill-the taste. Horus has no response to this. \nROHEIM (CONT'D) \n(SMILES) You're a good man, Horus... \n(BEAT) And you're right. This stuff's no good. It's a coward's way out and I know it. He gives the bottle a guilty stare. Tosses the bottle into a nearby garbage can. \nROHEIM (CONY' D) (sick of himself) What the hell. I can learn to love beverage. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nMary. Walking. Hancock. Following. From across the street. Mesmerized and in a world to himself. He crosses. the street, failing to look both ways... BAH! A UPS truck STRIKES the clueless superhero, sending him across air - towards Mary. \n200 lbs. of superflesh EXPLODES into a JEWELRY display window - just ahead of Mary's path. Glass showers the scene. People \nSCREAM. Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to mere tatters. He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the rubble. Looks at Mary, reposed before him. \nHANCOCK (nothing happened) How are you? In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of steel, STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator. Hancock shrugs a smiles. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nMr. Longfellow rounds the corner and ambles home. He is tired and his face shows it. There to make it worse - Clyde. He's back, getting at the sports page on the front steps. A sudden burst of outrage consumes Horus. He approaches the steps with fire and... \nHORUS (burning...) Clyde. Can I talk to you for just a brief moment? \nMARY (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) You're tense. \nHANCOCK I've been tired, lately. \nMARY You should slow down. Rest. \nHANCOCK -So people tell me. \nMARY (heat; upon some thought) It must be hard. \nHANCOCK Hard? \nMARY To always do right... do good when all you want to do is rest. \nHANCOCK It's harder to not do anything. What am I? It's not for me. It's for... it is about people. Rest? When there is despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am relief. You know that instant, that split instant of time when you realize that the nightmare... the totality of fear itself... that it's all been a bad dream? That it's safe? That is relief. The infant in my arms... to the hysterical mother. When you can see her face, what's rest? It is self-indulgence. Mary - in some advance stage of \"wow.\" \nMARY Where... who are you? \nHANCOCK It's not important who I am, Mary. Or what... where I'm from. It doesn't matter. I'm a man. I am every man. \nMARY (sizing up his words) You probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself, on account of who you are and what you do. \nHANCOCK Why... do you say that? \nMARY It's like, everything you say sounds... so perfect. Like you rehearse them so they'll be that way. I mean, not to say that it's insincere... \n(BEAT) I mean, maybe it's something about you but... it must be hard on you sometimes. Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer. \nMARY (CONT' D) \n(APOLOGETIC) But probably not... probably.. \nHANCOCK Yes... (pulling teeth) sometimes. Mary allows the moment to sink in. \nMARY So, you never answered. Back there... what were you doing in the middle of the street? \nHANCOCK \n(THINKS) I was lost... \n(EXHALES) . but I think I'm ok, now. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nTrash cans fly. Paper, swept up and sent aflutter. We've seen this before - Aaron, running for his life and the bullies in pell-mell pursuit. He cuts into an alley. Looses them momentarily. Finds a DUMPSTER to his liking. \nErlick. Spengler. They zoom by and with great eagerness. Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat. From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he takes. \nAARON \n(HANCOCK) \" before long, you're running, looking for a place to hide.\" \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nErlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted they scale it. Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground. \nPERCEVAL Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed my hair. Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their eyes are of disbelief. \nPERCEVAL (CONT'D) What's up? (checks his hair) What? Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering with clenched fists. \nPERCEVAL (CONT'D) (rolls up sleeves) I just combed my hair. Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray. \nPERCEVAL (CONT'D) Don't bother. He's mine. (to Aaron) No biting. I hate biting. \nSPENGLER Kick his ass, Percy. \nHORUS (CONT' D) (notices Mary, applying \nLIPSTICK) Are you going somewhere? \nMARY No. I have to start on dinner. So how about that glass of milk? Horus - shakes his head, annoyed. \nMARY (CONT' D) All right. Try to get some sleep. With that, she's out the door. Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his wretched face. He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean? Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the cover. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nAaron races down the. last leg of his street. On the steps of his apartment building - Hancock, making himself at home. Yes, a cigarette smolders from his lips.. Hancock looks at the boy. They share a second of silence. And finally, Hancock-puts out his hand - he approves. Aaron, triumphant, SMACKS it for five. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe dinner table. Post meal. Mid-digestion. Aaron is running off at the mouth. \nAARON .o his mouth was. open and he just stared up at me, it hurt that bad. And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair - a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned. \nAARON (CONTD.) \n(CONTINUING) I said, \"don't mess with me.\" Just like that. \n(MORE) \nAARON (CONT'D) \"Don't mess with me.\" Mom, remember that guy in the cop movie... he said that? \nMARY All right, already. How's your mouth? \nAARON It doesn't hurt, I told you. \n(CONTINUING) He saw everything from the roof. Said I did what I had to do. \nHORUS \n(FINALLY) Aaron, tomorrow... \nAARON (to Mary; oblivious) He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up again... \nHORUS I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I pick you. \nAARON God, my friends will freak. Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThrough the dim of light - Horus, alone, prepares for work. A framed PHOTOGRAPH of a distinguished MAN (50's) sits on the shelf inside the closet - he poses in full police regalia, stern and proud. Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet door. \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nOn the kitchen floor and under the light - Mary and Aaron, mother giving son a HAIRCUT. \nMARY Hold still. \nAARON I like it long. \nMARY Shut up. \nHorus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his wife, then at his son - doing their own thing. They don't realize he's there. Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him. \nMARY (CONT'D) Horus? \nAARON it's almost eight. Dad's late. \nMARY Horus? She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into the stairway outside. There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other. \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIn the kitchen and under the light, Mary. Hancock. Aaron. Mary is finishing up on Aaron, applying the last SNIP. \nAARON my mouth. It's starting to swell. I think he loosened a tooth. Mary - maternal duty calls. \nMARY All right. Go to your room. I'll get the ice pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for the front door. Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him... \nMARY (CONT' D) You're leaving? \nHANCOCK It's getting late. \nMARY I'm sorry. \nHANCOCK I'm going to take a walk. \nMARY Really? On the boardwalk? \nHANCOCK Maybe. Pause. \nAARON (O.S.) Mom.' \nMARY I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought. \nHANCOCK \n(FINALLY) Good night, Mary. \nMARY Good night. \nINT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT \nThe clock - 9:45 pm. The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer. He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and peers out at the street - no Roheim. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nThe bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there, marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis. She mingles with a BAR FLY. Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat. From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap. Whispers to him. \nMAN I wear dresses. How about you? \nHANCOCK (considers; nah) Get lost. The warning comes across quite well - the man exits. Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door. \nGINA (to bar fly) Meet you outside. The El Camino, right? The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face in her hands, studies him. \nGINA (CONT'D) Your eyes are calm. It's good. She withdraws her hands. \nHANCOCK What? \nGINA But you're still here. She rises. And as she makes for the exit... \nGINA (CONT'D) Nice haircut. Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the rest of his cigarette - pensive. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT \nThe clock, it reads 1:05 am. Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine takes him outside - via an EXIT door. \nEXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT \nA dark alley. Dumpsters. Boxes. Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the street.:. \n. as a ragged FIGURE collapses onto.him. It's Roheim and he's been drinking, right? \nHORUS Dear God. Horus catches him. \nINT. WATANABE'S - NIGHT \nThey find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling. A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds. \nHORUS Jesus. Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to nurse' the wounds. \nROHEIM Figured I can get you by the front... but you weren't there. \nMARY Eat... and we'll go. (checks her watch) Where's your father? She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair. \nAARON You forgot the corn... (the comb snags) . ouch! \nMARY I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll be home before we leave. I'm sorry. \nAARON You having your period, mom? She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK. \nINT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY \nWe enter an anal-retentively neat and manicured living room. Horus ushers Roheim in... \nROHEIM Shoes. The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nHorus sets Roheim down on the bed. Tucks him under. \nHORUS You're going to be okay? \nROHEIM I don't know. You might have solo act tomorrow night. \nHORUS Get some sleep. \nROHEIM You're a good man, Horus. \nHORUS (washing over it) I have to get home, now. I'll call. Roheim grabs on to his sleeve. \nROHEIM You know what Olga said before she walked out on me? Her last words to me. She turned at the front door. Looked around the room and she says, \"keep it clean.\" That's it, can you believe it? Then out the door. \n(BEAT) But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place spotless... in case she walks through that door one day. (at Horus; with pain) I don't think she's coming back. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nHorus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger, despair, a combination thereof. He moves down his street. Looks ahead - where Clyde stands, pillaging his morning paper. Clyde Spots Horus on the approach. Smiles at him, with impunity. Goes back in. On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth. \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nFist clenched, the morning paper under his arm - Horus. steadies down the hallway. His eyes target the door at the end of the hall, seeing red. \nHe gets there, the door. He swallows. Wipes sweat off his hand. KNOCK. And again, KNOCK. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdow He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed second. Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung. The door opens. And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other. Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy. \nCLYDE The box scores are waiting and I got an inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make it snappy. \nHORUS (loosing his voice) I'd like my sports page, please. \nCLYDE You what? \nHORUS I want you to stop taking my sports page. \nCLYDE All right. Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck. He stutter-steps... KNOCKS... \nCLYDE (CONT' D) \n(AGITATED) What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop taking your sports page. Now get out of here and let me... \nHORUS \n(INTERRUPTS) I want today's sports page. \nCLYDE You what? \nHORUS That there... my sports page. \nCLYDE What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden? You don't even like football. Horus does.not budge. \nCLYDE (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) You'll get it back... after I take my dump. Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his foot in the door. \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nMary is on the sofa - wondering where Horus might be. She checks h er watch. \nEXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY \nThe place is empty. Deserted. Aaron. On the curb. Some trash flutters by his feet. On his face - the abandonment of all hope. Nobody's coming, this is clear. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nHancock - on his back and amidst the rubble. He braces the building to get up. Drops. Gets to his feet, only to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk. We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something stiff up his ass. \nREED What do we have here? A piece of shit. A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that superguy. Hancock stares at him. \nHANCOCK \n(HUMORLESS) Fuck off. He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nA Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives chase... and confronts him, out of breath. \nAARON (a slight smile) Hi. \nHANCOCK (turning; drunk) What're you doing here? \nAARON (the smile fades) I saw you walking. Where were you today? You said you'd... be there. Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame. \nHANCOCK I don't know what you're talking about. \nAARON Where are you going? Can I go? \nHANCOCK You don't want to go where I'm going. \nAARON Those assholes got me in the bathroom, today... (trying to hold on) and you said you'd pick me up at school. Hancock turns. He's upset now. \nHANCOCK Listen. Aaron recoils. \nHANCOCK (CONY' D) \n(CONTINUING) Listen. I'm not here to save you. \n(MORE) \nHANCOCK (CONT'D) No, not my job. Don't put that on me. (pounds his chest) Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal with it, kid. You are what you are and... what I say, it won't do you any change. You'll grow up to be just like-your old man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can do about it... 'cept grab both ankles, hope by the grace of God the reaming's gentle. Aaron backs away from his angry wrath. \nHANCOCK (CONT' D) \n(CONTINUING) That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not here to save you. He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed against the rocks. In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint. \nINT. BAR - DAY \nThis empty bar. With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's drying some mugs, let's call him JOEY (30). \nHORUS \n(BOOZED) One.more. Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it... \nHORUS (CONT'D) No... nevermind. (going to blow) Where's your bathroom? \nJOEY (not in my place) Bathroom's closed. Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit. \nHORUS How much. \nJOEY \n(SARCASM) Let's see... that's one beer. Tell you what. I'll take care of this one. \nHORUS Thank you. \nMARY (CONT' D) What do you think you're doing, Horus Longfellow? Horus gauges her. \nHORUS Don't \"Horus Longfellow\" me, Mary. I'm not your child. I'm your husband. \nMARY Horus, what're you talking about? (re: bruises) Who did this to your face? Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength. \nHORUS \n(OBLIVIOUS) But you didn't know-about me... Mary knows where this is headed. \nHORUS (CONT' D) \n(CONTINUING) You didn't know I was going to do this to you. (a half-chuckle) I guess I should've known. We were married and I knew... at the reception. I couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and I watched you dance. In your white dress. And I remember zoning out... for a second, just watching you. God, Mary... the little girl next door who used to get into fist fights with her brothers in those patched-up Toughskins. We met only 'cause the tallest tree in the neighborhood was in my backyard and you needed to climb it. \n(BEAT) But that night. God, you looked so beautiful I.had to realize it... how much I loved you... one more time. \n(BEAT) You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I remember I'm watching you there, with him... together like that. You looked good with him, I thought all of a sudden. Like you belong... better. And as I stared across the floor, it was the same story with all the guys there, that they were more right for you. \n(SWALLOWS) More right because that night, you walked in with the wrong man. \nMARY Why do you say that? \nHORUS Because I let you down. \n(BEAT) I'm a coward. I can't do anything about it. Look at me, I'm breaking up in front of you. And God, I fear the day when I'd have to defend you and Aaron. What do I do, then? What am I if I can't do that... my own wife, family? Not a man. \nMARY (ballistic) L are. Did You're a fool, that's what you you think I was completely blind when I married you? Something cuts at your masculine ego and it's the pressure... the standard's unreasonable. The woman, she wants me to part oceans. That's the kind of bull shit's made of.

BATHROOM - NIGHT \nHancock stares into the mirror - a face in the latter stages of deterioration. And in disgust, he swipes EVERYTHING off the sink. \nREPORTER (O.S.) What're you doing, in there! I'm calli ng the police. Hancock drops his pants. Straight-arms the wall with his left. And with his right, latches on to his magnanimous member. Outside and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed against wood - listening. So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a storm. His body convulses under said stimulation. He GROWLS... Cue for the reporter to back away. \nREPORTER (CONT'D) Jesus... Hancock stiffens, in full throttle. Full. Throttle... up and into a fevered pitch... and BOOM, we hear a He GROWLS...

(bull horn) Come on out! Hancock seizes his ears the bull horn testing his nerves. He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of healing. Hancock closes in - corners her. \nMARY Please. But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his hand down her back and between her buttocks. \nMARY (CONT' D) (in tears) No... \nHANCOCK Please... A sudden burst of anger seizes Mary. She SCREAMS... STRIKES Hancock across the face. \nMARY \nNO! He tears himself away. Disgusted. Tortured. \nHANCOCK (a desperate child) Help me. \nTED (O.S.) (bull horn) All HELL'S going to break loose! Hancock recoils from this noise - in veritable pain. Clutches his ear. \nOFFICER Let go, you little asabite. Aaron spots Horus in the hallway... \nAARON Dad! He breaks loose - running into his father's arms, crying. \nAARON (CONT' D) I'm sorry dad. I didn't know what to do... \nOFFICER Mr. Longfellow... \nAARON. He's got mom, dad. He came and took her away. What do we do, now? Horus - he hasn't a clue. On the TV - a graphic depiction of war at Killybegs. \nOFFICER There's not much you can do. We've got every man out there, already. I suggest you take your son some place safe. Let us do our jobs. \nHORUS (on the TV) Mary... \nAARON I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry. \nOFFICER (dreading it) I have to go... they need me. He exits. Roheim enters, out of breath. He notices the nasty, gaping hole in the kitchen. \nHORUS He's got Mary, Roheim. (blank; uncertain) I got to get her. \nROHEIM What do you mean, you got to get her? \nHORUS I got to do what I got to do. Aaron stares up at his father - \"did he just say that?\" \nAARON Damn right, dad. We got to get her. Horus at the screen - oblivious. \"What can I do?\" \nROHEIM Brain damage runs in this family or something? Aaron senses his father's state of overwhelmness. \nAARON Dad. You ever hear about the fox and the bloodhounds? \nEXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT \nA HELICOPTER (Chopper Three) has since joined the picture of CHAOS. A strobe light cuts through the darkness and rain, zeroed in on Hancock. A machine GUN mounted inside opens FIRE - a wave of bullets ricochet off the superhero with no effect. Cops and S.W.A.T. teams continue their assault - it's the only thing they can do, and it's worthless. And on that note, Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance. First to go is the helicopter. He slices through the air and RIPS the vehicle in half. An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning PROPELLER into wild trajectory. It crashes into a cluster of Cops - heads are severed, sent flying. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nHorus sprints through the downpour, following the SOUNDS of destruction. At the scene, he arrives in time to witness the dismantling of future law enforcement. \nEXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT \nHancock swoops down toward a patrol car. Scares the Cops away.

They startle him. \nHORUS Jesus, Aaron. I don't want you to be here. \nROHEIM (at the mayhem) I need a drink. Aaron, staring at the massacre - a HEAD rolls pass him. It looks pale but well-fed, healthy. It Ted's. Aaron ducks into his father's chest. \nEXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT \nIn the blink of an eye, the police department is no more. The entire block - a panorama of bedlam, overturned vehicles, and mangled bodies. Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building. From the street, we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble, heading towards the confrontation. He'passes a mutilated body - belonging to Adams. A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun and stops. He looks around at the vast destruction and realizes that no revolver will do. He continues forth. \nINT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT \nMary is on the floor, wrapped in cape. Hancock returns. He's pumped, deranged, and he's lost that loving feeling. \nMARY What have you dome? \nHANCOCK I made them go away. \nHORUS (O.S.) Mary! Mary responds to her name like a body to sugar. \nMARY \n(HORROR) Horus! \n", "test1_input": "CLYDE \n(LOUD) Longfella. Good to see you. \nHORUS Clyde... Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face. \nCLYDE Picked this up for you.

The headline reads... \nRAINSTORM HITS SHEEPSHEAD. NO END IN SIGHT. Horus checks the sky - a sinewy mesh of angry clouds. He lumbers inside. \nINT. NICK'S MARKET - DAY \nYour average market, mom and pop. Artichokes! Mary handles an artichoke, contemplating.

She continues her way, purpose in every step. No window shopping bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful. She crosses the street, her destination: CENTRAL FIDELITY BANK. A dark CHEVY eases pass Mary on this street, pulls to a stop. Mary continues forth, entering the bank. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nSheepshead DENIZENS crisscross amok. People queue behind teller lines, taking care of business. Mary takes her place. She glances at the bank CLOCK - it's 10 o'clock. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nA BEE spirals the air and lands on the sleeve of a nervous ARM. This arm protrudes from the dark Chevy, parked before the bank. The engine is running. The arm fidgets. SHOOS the insect away. With white knuckles, it grips the wheel. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nSame bank, same people. Mary awaits service in the same line. A MAN ambles pass Mary's line, up towards the front. He cuts off the person in front, an elderly WOMAN. \nWOMAN Hey, what's the idea? The man turns. Smiles. His smile fades, turning into a maniacal. grin. This man is TOM (35), as plainly evil as the eye can see. \nTOM You know what, you remind me of my grandma. Tom whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants... \nTOM (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) She gave me this when I made parole. He aims the barrel in her face. \nTOM (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) Thanks, Granny! Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the situation at hand. They begin to panic. On cue, two new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY (30's), emerge from the crowded bank, both revealing automatic RIFLES. Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the butt of his gun. As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin. The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues. The Jerrys try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with ,Ir\u00e2\u0096\u00ba that, Tom takes center stage. He leaps on the teller counter. \nTOM (CONT'D) Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. My name is Tom. These are my assistants, Jerry and Jerry.

BANK - DAY \nBehind the teller window is Tom, assisted by a quite voluptuous employee - VERONICA, (23), with an IQ to match. \nTOM (to the crowd) And while I take care of business, my associates will be making their rounds. The Jerrys leap into action - guns pointing. They rummage the helpless patrons for jewelry, cash and collectables. \nTOM (CONT'D) \n(CONTINUING) Please be cooperative and more importantly, charitable. We'd like you to think of it as donations... for Jerry's kids. Jerry #2 weaves through crowd waving his automatic wand. People dish out valuables into his canvas BAG. He arrives at Mary, motioning at the bag with the rifle. \nMARY \n(UNINTIMIDATED) I have no money. \nJERRY #2 (I wasn't born yesterday) Come on, is. What the hell you doing in a bank if you.got no money? \nMARY I'm here to withdraw money. This stumps the brainless beast. And over by the teller, while he's stuffing her bag... \nTOM Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful. She's too scared for speech. But back on the bank floor... \nJERRY #2 (at her ring) Give me that. \nJerry #2, testicles in his throat. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nTom is out on the floor, gun wielding. Jerry #1 is with him, loot bags in hand. \nTOM (to the crowd) No heroes! No heroes! Jerry #2 returns, bad news on his tongue. \nJERRY #2 He flew! Fucking Fred flew! \nTOM Fuck! Fuck!

Mary, amongst the crowd, takes a glance at the CLOCK --one thirty. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK DAY \nTime LAPSES. It's 2:30. Mary turns from the clock, concerned. She studies the situation, the robbers - an overall glumness tells the story. At the entrance - Tom. He looks desperate. Irrational. Ready to snap. \nThe hostages huddle on the floor, tired. They wait. \nEXT. BRADLEY ELEMENTARY - DAY \nThe CLOCK on the building reads 2:30 school is out. Children file out of classrooms. Scatter. Only Aaron remains, alone to the elements - waiting. A ball bounces, rolls to his feet. Aaron looks... It's not a ball. It's a doll's head. Aaron's face - dread. \nEXT.

(hands over the phone) Tami. \nTED Ooh, one sec. (to the bank) Time's... all Hell's gonna break loose, fellas. (to phone) My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo... A BLAST rings out from Central Fidelity. Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security guard, tumbles out and onto the sidewalk. Blood and brain exits in OOZES where the bullet had entered - he's probably dead. \nThe cops, Ted., Chad. Rutger and Adams - they all REACT, guns raised. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nTom huddles by the entrance, gun smoking. Cool and suave has succumbed to psychotic. The Jerrys are nearby, nervous. As are the hostages, clumped together in fright. \nTOM \n(SNAPPED) I'm not gonna say it again, Ted! (re: hostages) swiss cheese. All of them! \nTED (O.S.) Time's running out, fellas!

And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a CAR comes CRASHING down before the bank entrance. It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps still reeling from the impact. The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED, the getaway driver (alias, the arm.) Fred lands on the hood of the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame. SHOCK waves across faces of stone. The cops all look up. \nTED (at the sky) What the... \nThere :;n the sky, a taped figure works his magic of flight. He examines the ground below. And he dives. Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral. He circumvents the bank structure, flying around and around. Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nTom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots. Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion. The WHIR outside subsides. Stops. A loaded beat. Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of bricks sprays the air inside. A caped figure bursts into the scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages. in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route to the windshield of a police vehicle outside. Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of steel. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nJerry #1 rides air and glass out and across the street into another awaiting police windshield. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nSmoke and debris smother the air. And as they subside, all eyes fall on the caped figure that is Hancock, erect in the rubble. Mary can't believe her eyes. She surveys every inch of his frame, now clean-shaven, combed, comic book perfect. Hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages - his eyes pick out the WOMEN - Veronica's wet smile takes him. A heartbeat. \nHANCOCK \n(GOD) Everybody out, please. Bodies bang about, all moving for the door. \nMary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped figure, until real estate ushers her into the street. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nPARAMEDICS converge on the hostages . The cops are at a loss - deers staring down a pair headlights. They train their guns on the bank, waiting for answers. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nThe bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars us to the back, where the bank SAFE is. We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a thick steel chamber of commerce. Hancock arrives at the safe. Confronts the object inside - Tom. \nINT. BANK SAFE - DAY \nThere he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery. Tom bears his revolver, aimed at Hancock. Hancock enters the safe. \nTOM Stay away.

The BULLET ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity. It rips Tom's right EAR from his head. \nHANCOCK (catching the renegade slug) Why'd you go and do that for? Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back, clutching his head. He bleeds. \nTOM Fuck... My shirt. \nHANCOCK (steps forward) Why don't we call it the day. \nTOM (gun raised) Don't. I told you... I'm not going back. \nHANCOCK \n(IRRITATED) If you're going to tease, cock the damn gun. Otherwise, spare me the wounded animal act of desperation. I don't got c, time for rhetoric and sympathy so. don't expect... dialogue and \"come with me and you won't be hurt\" bullshit. You walk out of here with me and your life is a violent storm.

ALLEY - DAY \nThe schoolyard - it looms in the background, as a reference to where we are. Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and fire-escapes and ominous gray skies. DARK FIGURES move into this sight - they eclipse the heavens. And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs - his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER and ERLICK (both his age.) Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts his mouth out of symmetry. He stares at PERCEVAL, before him - the blonde kid from class. We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about, SPRAYING. Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nThe aftermath. Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS, reporters squeezing through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this superman. \nWe follow Hancock's scope amidst the melee it spots luscious Veronica again, it spots WOMEN, all who'd die for a chance to suck on his cape. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He can't see but, from behind, the stall door opens... Guess who? Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head. Introduces it to the yellowed waters below. SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range. What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked laughter. The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler.

Nick jumps down onto the other side, but just as he reaches for the pen, Hopps is suddenly right there and snatches it. 
HOPPS The thing is, you don't need a warrant if you have probable cause, and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty low-life climbing the fence, so you're helping plenty. Come on. 
Hopps cheerfully heads off. Nick watches her, not quite smiling, but he's starting to respect his opponent. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER 
Hopps wipes snow off a back bumper: LICENSE PLATE 29THD03. 
HOPPS 29THD03... this is it. 
INT. REFRIGOUSINE - MOMENTS LATER 
They open the big door, which looks like it belongs on a refrigerator. As they snoop around, Hopps uses tweezers to pick up a clump of fur. 
HOPPS Polar bear fur. 
NICK (opening glove box) OH MY GOD! 
HOPPS What? What?! 
Hopps looks up, only to see Nick holding some JERRY VOLE CDs. 
NICK The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole! But on CD? Who still uses CDs? 
As Hopps rolls her eyes and goes back to collecting clues, Nick lowers the back partition and his eyes go wide. 
NICK (CONT'D) Carrots...? If your otter was here... he had a very bad day. 
Hopps' flashlight reveals CLAW MARKS covering the back seat. 
HOPPS Those are... claw marks. You ever seen anything like this? 
NICK No. 
Through the fog on the floor Hopps spots a wallet. 
HOPPS Oh, wait. Look. 
They slink back into the back seat. Hopps opens up the wallet to find a drivers license for Mr. Otterton. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He was definitely here. What do you think happened? 
Nick spots a cocktail glass... it's etched with a "B." 
NICK Well, now wait a minute... (then, suspicious) Polar bear fur... Rat Pack music... fancy cup... (suddenly terrified) I know whose car this is. We gotta go! 
HOPPS Why? Whose car is it? 
Nick tries to put everything back the way he found it. 
NICK The most feared crime boss in Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big and he does not like me, so we gotta go! 
HOPPS I'm not leaving, this is a crime scene. 
NICK Well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here, so we're leaving right now! 
Nick ushers Hopps to the door, but opens it to find two big POLAR BEARS. 
NICK (CONT'D) (faux excitement) Raymond! And, is that Kevin?! Long time no see. And speaking of no see, how about you forget you saw me? Huh? For old time's sake? 
The polar bears grab Nick and Hopps by their throats... 
NICK (CONT'D) That's a no. 
...and yank them off screen. 
INT. POLAR BEAR CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
VROOM! A car whizzes by. Inside, Nick and Hopps sit nervously in the back seat, sandwiched between the polar bears-- one of whom casually scrolls through Zoogle Photos on his phone. 
HOPPS What did you do that made Mr. Big so mad at you? 
NICK (sotto) I uh, I may have sold him a very expensive wool rug... that was made from the fur of a... skunk's butt. 
HOPPS (pissed at Nick) Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.

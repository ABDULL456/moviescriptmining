RICK Look, before we go bagging any chicks, I gotta get a hunk of beef in me. 
GARY Hey, I got a guy over at Outback Steak House who could set us up. 
BAKER Ooooh, he's got pull over at Outback. Wow. 
RICK Hey, I like Outback. Let's chug these and hit the road. 
As the guys drink up, Hog-head puts his arm around Gary. 
HOG-HEAD Hey, Gar, you don't happen to have any connections at 7/11, do ya? Maybe someone could hook me up with a player's card so I can cut right to the front of the raspberry slurpy line. The guys all LAUGH, as we

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CAPE COD BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT This is an old summer shack nestled on a quiet bluff overlooking the sound. 
INT. BEACH COTTAGE - SAME 
Grace stands at the window staring out on the ocean, while Maggie nestles on the couch reading a summer novel. The kids are asleep and the place is quiet. 
GRACE I think we might've made a huge mistake. 
MAGGIE Stop thinking about it, Grace. Why don t you just try to get some sleep? Grace turns to Maggie. 
GRACE Sleep? I can't sleep. I don't understand you--how can you Just sit there and read knowing that Rick could be making out with a supermodel right now? Maggie doesn't answer. 
GRACE (CONT'D) Our husbands aren't married this week. Do you know what husbands do when they're not married? 
MAGGIE Shh. You're going to wake the kids. 
GRACE Are you going to sit there and tell me you're not the least bit concerned about what they're doing right now? Maggie SIGHS. 
MAGGIE Okay... I'm a little concerned. 
Grace flops into the chair across from her. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Of course I'm concerned. But what choice did we have? 
GRACE We could've kept the status quo. I mean, were things really that bad that we had to try something this extreme? 
MAGGIE For me they were. 
(BEAT) Look, you may call this a hall pass, but for me it's more of a Hail Mary pass. I'm serious, I don't know what else to do. Grace looks at Maggie, surprised. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Remember last week when we went to Lucy's award thing? Grace nods. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) That night when we got home, Rick and I were gonna.. .you know... and I was waiting for him in bed while he tucked the kids in, and I started wondering who he would be thinking about during sex. Would it be the girl he checked out on the way into the party? Or would it be Missy Frankenfield--because I noticed him gawking at her? Or how about one of the waitresses, or maybe somebody he saw at work that day? Then when he came into the room, I did something I'd never done before: I pretended to be asleep. 
GRACE You're kidding me? You've never done that? I do that all the time! Maggie almost smiles. 
MAGGIE Look, I understand that people have fantasies and that you're not always thinking about the person you're with. 
GRACE That's for sure. 
MAGGIE But it's just...I don't know... it's been too long since I felt that he was thinking about me. 
They sit there for a moment, quiet. Then: 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) I need this hall pass to work, Grace, because if it doesn't, I don't know what's going to happen.

BAKER Okay... so where to now? Rick can't think in this state. 
RICK Fred...? 
FRED Hm? 
RICK Answer Baker. 
FRED What's the question? 
RICK What are we doing for the rest of the night? 
FRED 
(DISINTERESTED) I don't know. Getting laid, right? 
HOG-HEAD I gotta go home and poo.

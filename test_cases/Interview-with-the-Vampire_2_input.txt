LOUIS Yes... 
Lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his teeth in his neck. 
ON LOUIS' FACE 
Every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is drained from him. 
ON THEIR FEET 
Hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers. 
THE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and rigging of the boats around the wharf. 
LESTAT 
Floats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his blood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging from a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face. 
LESTAT You still want death? Or have you tasted it enough? 
Louis can barely get the words out. 
LOUIS Enough... 
Lestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets into the water below. 
LOUIS' FACE 
Coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the wharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside him. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him, dangling from the rope of the shipmast. 
INT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO 
ON MALLOY'S FACE 
Captivated, terrified, enthralled. 
MALLOY That's how it happened? 
LOUIS No. The Gift of Darkness requires more than that, as you'll see. 
EXT. WATERFRONT - DAY 
Louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish, the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish. He gets to his feet and walks weakly through the mudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him. 
LOUIS (V.O.) He left me half dead that morning. he wanted something from me. He came back the following night. 
INT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC 
Louis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with mosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his face with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover in the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed, and withdraws, with the others. 
Candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin. 
Louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring incoherently. Then he opens his eyes. 
LESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands by the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright. Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible - and angel or monster. 
Louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it. 
LOUIS Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house? 
LESTAT And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it? 
Louis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel. Louis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand. Lestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand and throws it away. His hand begins to heal. 
LESTAT You're not afraid of anything, are you? 
LOUIS Why should I be? 
Louis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and point it. Lestat laughs indulgently. He draws closer. 
LESTAT Are you going to put that through me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes? 
He comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the sword passes through his waistcoat. 
LESTAT Were all last night's promises for nothing? 
He reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out the sword. 
LOUIS What do you want from me? 
LESTAT I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it? 
Lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis is becoming spellbound. 
LESTAT The wine has no taste. The food sickens you. There seems no reason for any of it, does there? But what if I could give it back to you? Pluck out the pain and give you another life? And it would be for all time? And sickness and death could never touch you again?

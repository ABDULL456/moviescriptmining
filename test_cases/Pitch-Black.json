{"train": "\"Pitch Black\", shooting draft, revised by David Twohy \nPITCH BLACK \nScreenplay \nby \nDavid Twohy \nBased on material by Ken and Jim Wheat \nRevised First Draft \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME \"OMITTED\" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nNOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON- PREFORMAT FONT \"TIMES NEW ROMAN\". THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nThough mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and lack of the same. \nDavid Twohy \nCUT IN: \nINT. MAIN CABIN \nA CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out... \nCAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere: The world is dying around her. \nLegs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But in the next cryo-locked... \nThe CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief. Slapping an intercom: \nFRY Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn, I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your E-release...no, red handle, red handle. I'll get the warm-ups out while -- \nPHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin, blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS HISSING in the air. \nFry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly... \nAnother LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry -- but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic: \nOWENS Why did I fall on you? \nFRY He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when -- \nOWENS I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall at all? \nFRY You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too. \nOWENS Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. I'm Owens. Right? \nThey swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own identities. \nFRY Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs brain cells. \nINT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN \nThey stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens. \nFRY 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin' took a swipe at us. \nOWENS Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space.... \nOwens activates an exterior view: A planet rushes up at us. That's why they have gravity. \nFRY Jesus God.... \nEXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY \nThe SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons already disintegrating. \nINT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK \nHeart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to steady herself. Over a headset: \nOWENS (V.O.) They trained you for this, right? Fry? FRY? \nFRY I'm not dying for them. \nShe pushes it. But this time... \nEXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY \nNo bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN through the clouds. \nINT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN \nNow we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and blocked them open. \nFRY Owens! \nOWENS 70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out! \nINT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY \nSeething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more speed, more heat. The ship does level -- but it's still being pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out... \nThe windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's just a glimpse of landscape before... \nEXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY \nAn airbrake fails. It shears off and pinwheels into... \nINT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY \nThe windscreen. It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but impossibly it holds. For now. \nOWENS (V.O.) What the shit was that? \nSunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression of the outside world. Now she has to rely on... \nA ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping. \nINT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY \nINTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he claws at safety restraints. \nINT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY \nGround-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in. \nOut the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up into view. Land. \n40 meters...30...20...10.... \nFry braces. \nIMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in. \nINT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN \nIMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one, Owens slams into the ceiling. \nINT. MAIN CABIN - DAY \nIMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he would've stayed inside, because just beside him... \nThe hull is cracking open. \nNIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free... skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it. 40 lives. \nINT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY \nHammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally. \nFRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris. But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under. \nFry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before... Dirt avalanches into the cockpit. It buries CAMERA. \nBLACKOUT \nINT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY \nChoking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING, CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in Arabic. Soon we find... \nNav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax, digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade. Paris straggles in with antique curios. \nJOHNS What the hell are these? \nPARIS Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare. \nZEKE An' this? \nPARIS Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's extinct. \nZEKE 'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess. \nPARIS Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us? \nJOHNS First, because he can only live out there for so long -- he's gonna come back and take what we got. Second, for the sheer thrill of the kill. \nA beat. They all grab for weapons. \nEXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY \nJohns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He fixates on... \nA blue glow on the horizon. \"What the hell is it?\" \nZeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on demand rather than in a constant flow. \nChrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for travel. \nFry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun, low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow. \nFRY Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler. \nZEKE What, you're goin' off, too? \nFRY Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad. \nSHAZZA A'course we will. \nPILGRIM #1 (O.S.) Imam...Imam.... \n(NOTE: \"Imam\" is pronounced \"el-ee-MAM.\") \nFry and the others round the ship to see... \nA blue star flaring into view. It's rising as the other suns are setting. \nSHAZZA My bloody oath.... \nAUDREY Three suns? \nZEKE (to Fry) So much for your nightfall. \nPARIS So much for my cocktail hour. \nIMAM We take this to be a good sign -- a path, a direction from God. \nJohns swings down from the top of the ship. \nJOHNS A very good sign. (re: blue sun) That's Riddick's direction. You do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy. \nFRY Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset. \nJOHNS (nodding) Which means he went toward sunrise. \nEXT. PLANET - DAY \nTrekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder. Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd, odd sight. \nAlready sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi. Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps. \nFRY So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then.... \nIMAM You know who Muhammad was? \nFRY Some prophet guy? \nIMAM \"Some prophet guy.\" And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God. \nJohns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal... \nRiddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity. \nEXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nTrailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her breather. \nINT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nRiddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons. Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry. Alone. \nEXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nJohns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her some. \nFRY Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more. \nJOHNS Probably right. \nThey drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against the combing. It brings her within arm's length of... \nINT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nRiddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled. \nJOHNS (O.S.) You know, I woulda played road dog for these guys. You could've stayed back. Pro'bly should've -- because, you know, if we don't find water.... \n\"We may not make it back.\" \nFRY (O.S.) No, no, I wanted to get away. \nJOHNS (O.S.) So I noticed. Never seen a \"captain\" quite so ready to leave her ship. \nJust as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck... \nEXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nShe steps away. \nFRY Better keep moving.... \nJOHNS What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch? \nFry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND! \nJOHNS (CONT'D) Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn. \nFRY Promise me. Swear to me you won't -- \nJOHNS You see anybody else here? Just between you and me. \nFRY During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin. \nJohns blinks, stunned. \"Are you shittin' me?\" \nINT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nTrying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's all he wanted. \nFRY (O.S.) So now you know. \nJOHNS (O.S.) Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought. \nRiddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle, left behind. It's still got one good swallow. \nEXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY \nLeaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the hills. Ahead is a canyon. \nJOHNS Hold up. \nHe jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye. \nJOHNS (CONT'D) Didn't bite. \nFRY What? \nFry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles, SOMETHING CREAKS behind her. \nIt's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight. \nFRY No darkness. No lights because no darkness.... \nEXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nFry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the source of the glint. \nExcited hits on her breather. \nFry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic bearing. Soon she's running. \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nFRY (V.O.) Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! \nJohns and the Chrislams trade looks. \nEXT. SKIFF - DAY \nFRY Allahu Akbar! \nFry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch up. They too marvel at... \nThe skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but the hull looks intact. \nEXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY \nCLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points. \nA SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on... \nA shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a dirt rampart just climbed by...someone. \nPARIS This now qualifies as the worst fun I've ever had. Stop it. \nNo response. \nEXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY \nWar-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked with? Again? He hopes? \nPARIS Audrey? Oh, Audrey.... \nAUDREY (O.S.) What? \nParis spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where he expected. \nINT. CARGO HOLD - DAY \nBlades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers, searching for usable goods. \nPARIS Tell me that was you. \nAUDREY Okay, it was me. What'd I do now? \nPARIS Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what. \nSHAZZA What're you goin' on about? She's been right here for the last.... \nThey all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something passing outside. Someone. \nSHAZZA (a quiet probe) Zeke? \nNo answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye to a crack there. \nHULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He starts toward the ship. \nAudrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: \"RIDDICK!\" \nParis goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there, ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang. All eyes watch as... \nThe sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach: We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears... \nAnd Shazza swings hard. \nJOHNS ...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie.... \nFRY Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what.... \nShe hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick. \nSHAZZA What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke? \nEXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY \nFry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv. \nFRY He used that? \nJOHNS Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut. \nFRY So why isn't it all bloody? \nJOHNS I assume he licked it clean. \nINT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY \nRiddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard. \nFRY So where is he? \nRiddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her. \nFRY Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before.... (no response) If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull. \nRIDDICK 'Mean the whispers? \nFRY What whispers? \nRIDDICK The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight. \nFry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get, Riddick is going to grab some with both hands. \nFRY Why don't we try the truth now? \nA head-shaking beat, then: \nRIDDICK All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now. \nFRY Show me your eyes. \nAgain he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with lids shut tight, anticipating the pain. \nFRY Show me, Riddick. \nImagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as those of a starved jaguar. \nFRY You did this? To yourself? \nRIDDICK Slam doctor. Well, we called him \"doctor.\" \nFRY Heard about it. Just never seen it. \nRIDDICK Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns. (replacing goggles) Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time. \nFRY Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked. \nRIDDICK Look deeper. \nHe CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her. \nEXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY \nChain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site. Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as... \nJOHNS I know what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to -- \nFRY Let's just be sure. \nJOHNS I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into -- \nFRY We're gonna find the body, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it. \nThey drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave, listening. Nothing now. \nINT. SPIRE - DAY \nFRY I'm over here in the -- \nSomething tugs on her chain. \nFRY Oh, God.... \nCLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge out footholds. \nA stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to... \nThe MADLY CLICKING LAIR below. \nShe tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and undo the belt. Suddenly... \nSomething explodes near her head. Daylight appears, followed by faces, human faces. They're breaking through the spire with the pick-ax. Hands reach inside... \nEXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY \n...and birth her into daylight. Overlapping: \nJOHNS We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now.... \nIMAM The child heard you before any of us could even.... \nSHAZZA Did you find him? You find Zeke? \nFRY (half insane) ...wasn't Riddick...it was...it was... goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't Riddick. Somethin' else down there that got Zeke and nearly got -- \nHer. She flies back into the spire. Something's still got the chain. \nThe others grab at flailing limbs. It's a tug-of-war now, human hands on one end, unseen \"hands\" on the other -- and the humans are losing. Until... \nImam unsheathes his blade... \nAnd slices through Fry's belt. \nINT. SPIRE - DAY \nAs the chain falls down the spire. Without Fry. \nINT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY \nFAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the Koran -- whatever qualifies as \"essential\" on this planet. Amid the activity, Audrey pauses to look at... \nThe spired hills. \nINT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY \nFry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay, THUMPING it down on the deck. \nIMAM One is all? \nFRY For now. \nINT. CARGO HOLD - DAY \nAt his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells. He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one. There's something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure. \nINT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY \nA shadow falls over Riddick. He doesn't look up. \nRIDDICK Found somethin' worse than me, huh? \nJOHNS We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now. \nNow their eyes meet. Johns RATCHETS HIS SHOTGUN and points it at Riddick's head. \nRIDDICK Woof, woof. \nThe SHOTGUN EXPLODES. CAMERA PANS off of Johns to show Riddick still alive. The shotgun discharged next to his head and blew off his wrist chains. \nJOHNS Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't. \nJOHNS Little ratty-ass. \nFRY Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts. \nSHAZZA Not a star-jumper. \nRIDDICK Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up. (to Fry) Right? \nFry looks from Riddick to Johns. \"How did he know that?\" \nFRY Little help here? \nThey muscle the power cell aboard. Riddick starts to follow, but Johns blocks. He doesn't want Riddick inside. \nJOHNS Check those containers for me. See what we can patch wings with. \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nWith religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture- recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to. \nINT. SKIFF - DAY \nSTART on the battery bay. Hands are adapting the power cell to the skiffs older electrical system. Soon... \nLights wink on throughout the ship. \nFRY Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells. \nJOHNS How many? \nFRY 15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch. \nJOHNS 25 kilos each, huh? \nSHAZZA Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get it up and chuggin'. \nJOHNS Do it. And if you need an extra hand, tap our problem child out.... (looking out) Where's Riddick? \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nHe's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens...upended chairs and furniture...broken skylights. Behind his back... \nAudrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through FRAME, stalking this curious monster in their midst. \nEXT. MOISTURE-RECOVERY UNIT - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nCLOSE on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation while awaiting... \nThe first drop of water. It appears at the bottom of a pipette. \nTongues fight for it. Another drop forms in its place. Now another and another. It brings CHEERS. \nINT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nCLOSE on Paris' hands. Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps crystal goblets...dusts off the refectory table...and rehangs an old Christmas garland. INTERCUT WITH... \nEXT. CORING ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nHands digging in dirt. \nCovertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the entrance of a tall windowless structure. \nHe excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light... and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel clean. The robot's language program warbles to life: \nROBOT \"...to all intruders. I am the guardian of this land. I will protect my masters at all cost. Death to all intruders...\" \nRiddick stands and tries the doors. Locked. He peers through a small filthy window. Is there something moving inside? Nothing now. Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign. \"Coring Room.\" \nJOHNS (O.S.) Missin' the party. C'mon. \nIt's Johns, keeping him on a short leash. Leaving, Riddick kicks a trash bin. Hard. \nRIDDICK Missin' the party. C'mon. \nHe leaves. HOLD on the trash bin a beat. \nAUDREY (O.S.) Talkin' to me? \nIMAM Ali.... \nINT. CORING ROOM - DAY \nCHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures, winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into... \nA dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut -- but at least he's still alive. \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nAs the survivors run for the coring room. \nINT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nAs Riddick stays behind to drink their water. \nINT. CORING ROOM - DAY \nHINGES ARE BLASTED AWAY. The door caves in. Imam shoulders past Johns to enter and find... \nThe empty coring room. \nIMAM Ali? \nA NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to come out? Imam opens the door... \nAnd hatchlings pour out. \nMoving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave, soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft, SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then... \nPilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room. \nImam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer down... \nThe coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean. \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nAgainst a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service. Paris and Audrey attend. Riddick watches from afar. \nINT. CORING ROOM - DAY \nSHAZZA Why was the door chained up? Why the bloody hell would they lock themselves in like that? \nJOHNS Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams better not be diggin' another grave out there. \nRIDDICK (O.S.) Other buildings weren't secure... \nThey turn. Riddick enters. \nRIDDICK (CONT'D) ...so they ran here. Heaviest doors. Thought they'd be safe inside, but... (looks down shaft) Someone forget to lock the back door. \nShazza joins him at the shaft. Gazing on the human remains: \nSHAZZA So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you saw it. You was right there. \nRiddick nods. \nSHAZZA (CONT'D) You were tryin' to kill him too. \nRIDDICK (shrugging, \"not necessarily\") Just wanted his O-2. (a beat) Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead. \nShazza can't deny it. She looks at him differently now, the man she once beat while in chains. She takes off her breather. \nSHAZZA Take it. \nRIDDICK (suspicious) What, it's broken? \nSHAZZA Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it. \nRiddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2. Johns watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick being promoted to oxygen-breathing human. \nJOHNS (to Fry) Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all -- \nFRY 60 years ago. \nJOHNS Wha'? \nJOHNS I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat. \nEXT. SKIFF - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nJohns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field table in the shade of the skiff. He seems out of earshot. Now, anyway. As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs through Johns. \nRIDDICK Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat. \nJohns moves on. The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of Vectran (wing-fabric material). They drop it on the table. Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was just there. \nRIDDICK (looking after Johns) I'll cut. \nHe has the knife. \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nAs Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat. \nEXT. SKIFF - DAY \nCLOSE on the knife slicing through the Vectran. \nRiddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old Berber rug-weaver. Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on... \nThe setting blue sun. Nothing unusual. Yet. \nINT. SKIFF - DAY \nThe hatch closes, seals. \nCLOSE on a monitor. A \"HULL INTEGRITY TEST\" is underway. Fry scans rising pressure gauges. \nRIDDICK (O.S.) Looks like we're a few shy.... \nFry whirls. Riddick is aboard, staring at the depleted battery bay. And he has Imam's blade. \nRIDDICK (CONT'D) Power cells. \nFRY They're coming. \nRIDDICK Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet. (half-beat) Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape. \nFRY I got the quick-and-ugly version. \nRIDDICK An' now you're worried about a repeat of history? \nFRY Entered our minds. \nRIDDICK I asked what you thought. \nFRY You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now? \nShe finds the courage to turn her back on him. Riddick moves closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. The cabin pressure builds. \nRIDDICK Think Johns is an do-right man? You think I can trust him to cut me loose? \nA beat. Does Riddick already know? Is he testing her? \nFRY Why, what'd you hear? \nRIDDICK Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive. (reading her face) Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed. \nIt knocks her off stride, but... \nFRY Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on each other -- no matter how hard you try. \nRiddick moves right up behind her. \nRIDDICK I don't truly know what's gonna happen when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I do know that once the dyin' starts, this little psycho family of ours is gonna rip itself apart. So you better find out the truth. Come nightfall, you better know exactly who's standing behind you. \nA monitor chirps the news: \"HULL INTEGRITY --100%.\" EXHALING GASSES, the hatch opens automatically. \nRIDDICK Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask why your crew-pal had to scream like that 'fore he died. \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nCLOSEUPS: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box... pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an eager arm vein. \nThe open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases his head and a light around the door to spot... \nHatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food. \nJOHNS (to others) Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones that musta -- \nSomething WHOOSHES for his head, swinging like a scythe. It catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us... \nA flash-image of an adult predator. Up close. \nIn one thin second, Johns is back with the others. \nJOHNS Very big beads. \nPARIS Not staying in here another.... \nHe goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night. Fry lunges for him. \nFRY Christ, you don't know what's out there! \nPARIS I know what's in here! \nIMAM Everybody come, this way and we should be safe. Hurry, please.... \nINT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nImam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed. At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a SCRATCHING. \nJohns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts the gasses to illuminate... \nThe door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY BLOWS drive everyone back. \nRIDDICK (to Johns) Can you do sumpin' else with that? 'Sides holding it in my fucking face? \nTaking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the blades of the predators. \nINT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nAn burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as... \nINT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nPredators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING, sweeping, hunting. \nINT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nSERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch just as the predators break into the container being vacated, always entering darkness. \nINT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nInside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the cargo with their bodies. \nRiddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind... \nPARIS Hello, hello? \n...and moves to the front of the container where darkness prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles. \nRIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the open container, the one where Johns found predators. \nSensing energy, Riddick lifts his face. \nRIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo, eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull. \nSensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS. \nPREDATOR POV: Of Riddick. \n(NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression without detail. We're \"seeing\" what the predator hears with echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its subject in 3-D space.) \nOblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey, Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back. \"Where's Riddick?\" \nHe's in a stare-down with a predator. \nSearching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head caught in a vice-like grip. \nRIDDICK Don't. Move. \nNow she challenges him to be the mind-reader. \nJOHNS (CONT'D) Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane. \nFRY (to others) We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock. \nPARIS I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night. \nFRY We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes. \nTroubled faces. Is it just our imagination? Or is the light on the floor growing dimmer? \nAUDREY You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there? \nPARIS Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot. \nJOHNS Back it up. How long can this last? Few minutes? Couple hours? \nNo one knows for sure. \nIMAM I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness. \nJOHNS Those suns gotta come back sometime. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then. \nFRY I'm sure that's what someone else said. Locked inside that coring room. \nA persuasive thought. Eyes swing back to Audrey. \nJOHNS Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there? \nFRY Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen. \nJOHNS Smoke screen for what? \nFRY For your own fear. \nJOHNS (eyes narrowing) Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE? \nTwo seconds pass. \nFRY How much you weigh, Johns? \nJOHNS What the hell's it matter? \nFRY How much? \nJOHNS 79 kilos. \nFRY Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan. \nHe makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps the underside of Riddick's chin. \nRIDDICK Think about that reward, Johns. \nJOHNS I'm willing to take a cut in pay. \nRIDDICK How 'bout a cut in your gut? \nJohns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds, poised for evisceration. \nJOHNS Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this. \nIMAM Please...this solves nothing...please.... \nJohns backs off first. The light grows dimmer. \nFRY (to Audrey) They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them. \nIMAM And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark? \nFRY No, I'm not. But he can. \nShe's pointing, of course, to Riddick. \nEXT. PLANET - NIGHT \nThe eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal light remains, we see clouds forming. \nRIDDICK (shaking head) Had it with deals. \nFRY But I just wanted to say -- \nRIDDICK Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better. \nIt worries Fry. \"If he doesn't expect to go free....\" \nRIDDICK (CONT'D) Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there. \nFRY We can, can't we? Trust you? \nRIDDICK Actually... (completely genuine) That's what I been askin' myself. \nHe walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a terrible, terrible mistake. \nEXT. NIGHT \nThe drag-sled begins moving. \nSERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off, eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side- guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every shadow a threat. They are a train of light. \nCLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles of booze. \nCLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot. \nEXT. NIGHT \nBelow us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND, the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from above, awaiting their chance. \nEXT. NIGHT \nFRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished. \nJOHNS So you noticed too? \nFRY Riddick. Riddick. \nThe procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on breathers as they muster inside the light. \nFRY Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them? \nRIDDICK Saw something I didn't like. \nJOHNS Such as. \nRIDDICK Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you? \nParis looks over his shoulder. \"We went around what?\" Nearby CLICKING breaks up the confrontation. \nFRY Let's move. (to Audrey) Just a detour. He'll get us there. \nPARIS Can we switch? \nFRY What, switch what? \nPARIS I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can.... (off their stares) Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here -- \nJOHNS She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells. \nPARIS Oh, so I'm disposable? \nFRY I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just get this train moving! \nEXT. NIGHT \nThey trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner. \nAt side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty. \nPARIS Light, please, need light here.... \nStill moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light. \nPREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl. \nA HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam lunges at the last nanosecond... \nRIDDICK What, you 'spect me to do it? \nJOHNS What's one more to you? Like this is the one that sends you to Hell? \nRIDDICK Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you. \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nAs Fry and the others keep slowing. \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nJOHNS Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the others off your back. \nRiddick stops. Reconsiders. \nJOHNS (CONT'D) Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples. \nRIDDICK (shakes head) Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum. \nJOHNS Like who, Mr. Chrislam? \nEXTREMELY TIGHT on both men: In their eyes, we see the new partnership splintering apart: \"Like Mr. Johns.\" \nRiddick makes a play for the shotgun. It BLASTS skyward. \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nAs the fight erupts: \nFRY Bring the light! \nAUDREY What're they doing? What're we -- \nFRY Leave the sled, let's go, go, go! \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nFIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE CLICKING AWAY. \nThe shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it into the night. And then pulls his shiv. \nRIDDICK Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's the only rule. \nJohns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark. Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club. \nRiddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers, forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns makes a desperate lunge for the light, but... \nRiddick shivs open his back. \nRIDDICK Remember that moment? \nGushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light. Riddick dogs him. \nRIDDICK Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns. You were one brave fuck, before. Now look at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass with your gauge...with your chains.... \nJohns finds the shotgun. \"And I'm still Billy Bad-ass.\" He sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill... \nBlackness. Where'd Riddick go? \nCLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see... \nSomething big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his head, he whirls again and takes aim on... \nAnother bull-rushing predator. \nJohns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the shotgun for another try. He's too late. \nBIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red. Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark. \nRIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator lifts him off the ground and \"stares\" with a deceptively gentle CLICKING-COOING SOUND. \nPREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression. \nRIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade, splitting him in two. \nEXT. NIGHT \nEXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nThe torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop. \nFry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a torch. \nPilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight. \nAudrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a metal carapace. \nRiddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through. \nRIDDICK As fast as you can. \nFRY You sure you can keep -- \nRIDDICK As fast as you can. \nEXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nSLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind, flank them in fire. \nEXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nAs predators launch from the rim. \nEXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nFirst come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces -- then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next come FERAL SOUNDS overhead. \nRIDDICK Don't look. \nThin blue liquid spatters them. \nRIDDICK Do not look up. \nMore spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds... \nA ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry eels. \nRIDDICK Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going! \nHis voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry keeps her eyes down and speed up. \nMore blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself? \nIMAM (a muttered mantra) \"So dark the clouds around my way I cannot see, But through the darkness I believe God leadeth me. I gladly place my hand in His when all is dim, And, closing my weary eyes, lean hard on him....\" \nNow WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly mess. \nPilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg, drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut. \nEXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nThe passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first. \nFRY Riddick? RIDDICK? \nAhead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon. \nAUDREY What? What is it? \nRIDDICK It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT! \nSteeling themselves, they start climbing. \nBut Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on... \nOne \"corpse\" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways... \nAnd tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed. \nPREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10 different predators. \nFRY Audrey! \nAudrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as... \nHe's found a crevice in the canyon wall. \nRIDDICK Inside...inside.... \nEXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nThey crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them. \nEXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nThere's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over to the crevice... \nEXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \n...and slide it over the opening. A black beat. \nAUDREY (a beat) Why's he still out there? \nFry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them? \nEXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nWorking like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise. He stops at the top, peers through the rain. \nRIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement. \nRiddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow, slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail. \nEXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nAUDREY He's not coming back, is he? \nFry checks Imam's face. Did Riddick say anything to you?\" Imam wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see his face. \nFRY There's light in here. \nIt's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few. \nFRY What are they? \nCLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life. \nIMAM Larva.... \nAUDREY Glow worms.... \nFRY (mind racing) How many bottles we got? Empty ones? \nINT. SKIFF - NIGHT \nRiddick boards the dark craft. \nConnects the power cells to the battery bay. \nWatches the ship come to life. \nEXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nCLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms. \nAUDREY More, more, we need more.... \nThey climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their world. \nEXT. SKIFF - NIGHT \nDrenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff, looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision? Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately... \nRiddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and closes the hatch behind him. \nEXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nSomething claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she spies... \nThe settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light. \nEXT. SKIFF - NIGHT \nRIDDICK Just give me your hand. \nFRY But they...they could still be.... \nRIDDICK No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn. \nA beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway. They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck. \nFRY I will not give up on them! I Will not leave anyone on this rock with those fucking things, even if it means -- \nIn a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely calm. Curious. Even gentle. \nRIDDICK You'd die for them? \nFRY I would try for them. \nRIDDICK You barely know them. \nFRY But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them. \nEXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nMORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready to do battle with... \nFry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick. \nAUDREY (big-eyed) You came for us.... \nRIDDICK Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this? \nEXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nProtected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four remaining survivors head out. \nRIDDICK Tighter, tighter.... \nEXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT \nRIDDICK Stop. \nThey pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL. \nFRY I don't hear -- \nHe covers her mouth. \nRIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise. A predator drinks there. \nRIDDICK (on his breath) Doesn't see us...wait for it to leave.... \nRIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another. Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major gathering place. \nSoon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare is far from over. \nRIDDICK Get behind me. \nRIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the pool. A slim gap appears. \nRIDDICK When I go, we go. Full-throttle. \nCLOSE on their hands, gripping each other. \nRIDDICK Ready...ready.... \nRIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage. A gauntlet within a gauntlet. \nRiddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly. \nRIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to \"stare\" over its shoulder. \nPREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast. \nThe survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to reach... \nThe muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others... \nAnd starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of... \n", "test1_input": "Four male \"Chrislams\": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab Muslims.) \nWIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain. The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side, spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are two suns -- one red, one yellow. \nPARIS Well. Our own little slice of heaven. \nThe Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to orient themselves. \nIMAM Please...which way to New Mecca? We must know the direction in order to pray. \nNorth? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING inside the ship finally ends. \nINT. CRASH SHIP - DAY \nAs Fry holds Owens, now dead. \nEXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY \nThe four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together, each faces a different compass point. \nEXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY \nFry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza, Audrey are already here. \nJOHNS Big talk about a scouting party... \nFry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship. One glance confirms that there are no other survivors. \nJOHNS (CONT'D) ...then we saw this. \nPARIS Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me? \nAUDREY Like I just ran, or something.... \nSHAZZA Feel one lung short. All of us. \nPARIS Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And with all this dust.... \nFaces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers. \nFRY It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to -- \nZEKE So what the bloody hell happened, anyways? \nFRY Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know. \nSHAZZA Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking grateful. This beast wasn't made to land like this. But cripes, you rode it down. (to others) C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason we're alive is a'cuzza her. \nOthers CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders. HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their savior. \nINT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY \nBreaking out pressure suits: \nFRY Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last. \nAUDREY Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse? (off their looks) Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me. \nSHAZZA We're worried you'll scare us. (ushering her away) Name's \"Audrey,\" right, love? And you're goin' to Taurus Three like we were? \nAUDREY Yeah, but...do we even have enough food to get there? Or will we have to resort to cannibalism? \nZEKE (to Fry) I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit further, cap'n. With your permission, a' course. \nFry blinks. \"They actually think I'm the captain.\" Zeke and the others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at another problem. Riddick. \nFRY And him? \nJOHNS Big Evil? \nFRY We just keep him locked up forever? \nJOHNS Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on -- \nFRY I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous? \nJOHNS Only around humans. \n", "test1_true": "FRY Oh, Christ.... \nThey're losing water. Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an emergency light, climbing wall-rungs... \nINT. MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY \nAnd crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water cistern.

Anything to drink! \nINT. CARGO HOLD - DAY \nOversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into this dark corridor lined with cargo containers. Each container has an access door. \nPARIS Mine here.... \nAs Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed. \nFRY S'matter? \nJOHNS Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep. \nParis opens his container to reveal... \nINT. PARIS' CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - DAY \nTiffany chairs stacked 10 high. Bronze eagle lecterns. Oriental umbrellas. Neo-Egyptian castings. \nJOHNS King Tut's tomb.... \nPARIS Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare. \nThey open the Wooten desk. Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles of sherry. Vintage Port. Glenfiddich. Bicardi 151. \nFRY This is it? Booze? That's what you have to drink? \nPARIS (educating her) 200-year-old single-malt scotch is to \"booze\" as foie gras is to \"duck guts.\" \nJOHNS (cracking a bottle) A toast to whatever he just said. \nPARIS I'll need a receipt for that. (to Fry) For all these. \nFRY Top of my list. \nShe joins Johns for a drink. Entering, the Chrislams watch with both envy and aversion. \nFRY I don't suppose.... \nIMAM One of the Christian habits we didn't adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait. \nJOHNS For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you? \nIMAM All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there. \nINT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY \nSTART on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it is... \nRiddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead, he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through. \nRiddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint. \nFree, he reaches for the cutting torch. \nEXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY \nPistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping.

CRASH SHIP - DAY \nShazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it and the ship. \nThe Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat. \nRiddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second. They're racing the eclipse and each other. \nEXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK \nAs the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun. \nEXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK \nIt's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND. \nFRY Don't stop, don't stop.... \nBut Paris can't help himself. He squints to see... \nEXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK \nThe spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there. \nEXT. SKY - DUSK \nAs the rings eclipse the red sun. \nEXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK \nA second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop, beholding... \nEXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK \nSomething pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light, it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their first nightfall. \nEXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK \nJOHNS Jesus, how many can there.... \nThey keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully, the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves from another -- and does a quick about-face. \nPARIS Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee. \nFRY Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo. \nThey run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see... \nRiddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE descending on them... \nRiddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just inches overhead. \nCLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being underwater. \nCLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades. \nThe hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try? \nAUDREY Tell her to stay there. Stay down. SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN! \nShazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her feet... \nFRY No, no, NO, NO, NO.... \n...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza. \nINT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK \n", "test2_true": "EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK \nStill on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him... \nA rising GANG-CLICKING. \nCLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone. \nEXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK \nThe spires are crumbling, torn down from within. \nEXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK \nReaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look. PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his jaguar eyes. \nRIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian, hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the world they haven't inhabited in 60 years. \nFRY What is it? What's happening? \nRIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding, SOUNDING, searching. \nRIDDICK Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry about. \nEXT. SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT \nThe rim of the planet overtakes both suns. The world goes dark. \nINT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nVault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED. \nThe survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship. Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths. \nAUDREY What if...what if she's still out there... still alive.... \nJOHNS Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions here...but 'member that boneyard? These just might be the fuckers that killed every other living thing on this planet, okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that door anytime soon are just about zero squared. \nFRY (agreeing) I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off. \nIMAM Quiet, please. Everyone. \nImam is listening at the cargo door. The others pile up alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside. \nAUDREY (whispering) Why do they do that? Make that sound? \nIMAM Perhaps the way they see. With sound, reflecting back. \nFRY (realizing) Echo-location. That's what it is.... \nNow MORE CLICKING -- behind them. Lights whip around to find... \nNothing. Only the door of an open container about halfway down the tunnel-like hold. \nA volley of looks. \"How the fuck could one get in here?\" \nFRY Breach in the hull. I dunno. \nMore CLICKING. Johns realizes they expect him to check it out. \nJOHNS I'd rather piss glass. \nRIDDICK Well, you got the big gauge. \nJOHNS Wanna rag your fat mouth? \nAUDREY Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam, are you still -- \nIMAM No, no, no, I do not believe -- \nJOHNS C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody bugfuck with those things. Why don't you just lose the goddamn.... \nMore CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO. \nRIDDICK Big beads. \nButching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward... \n", "test2_id": 2026, "test3_input": "Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now. \nRIDDICK Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think. \nFRY Think about what? \nJOHNS About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick! \nRIDDICK (answering Fry) About the girl. \nFRY What about her? \nRIDDICK What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding. \nJOHNS What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut. \nRIDDICK (agreeing) No. She's not. \nIt hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey. \nAUDREY (confessing) I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything.... \nFRY No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner. \nJOHNS (finally getting it) Aw, this can't be happening to me.... \nRIDDICK They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood. \nIMAM Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between -- \nRIDDICK (scanning) There is no \"safe.\" \nAn epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears fill with CANYON SOUNDS. \nFRY It's not gonna work. We gotta go back. \nJohns brays. \nJOHNS Hey, you're the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a whipped dog? \nFRY I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship. \nJOHNS I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here. \nFRY Are you fucking high again? Just listen to -- \nJOHNS No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get -- \nIMAM She's the captain, we should listen to -- \nJOHNS Listen to her? Her? When she was willing to sacrifice us all? \nA beat. Eyes turn to Fry. She wants to protest -- but can't. \nAUDREY What's he talkin' about? \nJOHNS During the crash, she -- \nFRY (a warning growl) This does not help us, Johns. \nJOHNS -- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us -- \nFRY Just shut up, okay? \nJOHNS -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we are disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her. \nFRY Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE! \nShe rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside. \nJOHNS We're not alive because of her -- we're alive in spite of her. \nHe swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes, her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down. \nFRY We cannot go through there.... \nJOHNS (lording) How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh? \n", "test3_true": "Johns snatches a light away from Imam. \nJOHNS (to all) Verdict's in. The light moves forward. \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nThey trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run. At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder. Pilgrim #1 now draws the sled with Imam. And up ahead... \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nJohns falls in step with Riddick. \nJOHNS Ain't all of us gonna make it. \nRIDDICK Just realized that, huh? \nCLICKING nearby. Johns BLASTS the night, driving the sound away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge. \nJOHNS Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right? \nRIDDICK Not if I'm the one. \nJOHNS What if you're one of five? \nRiddick stares. \"I'm listening.\" \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nAUDREY What're they doin' up there? \nIMAM Talking about the canyon, I suppose. How to get us through. \nOverhearing, Fry looks. It's odd to see Johns and Riddick walking side by side, like equals. Like partners. \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nJOHNS Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called \"triage,\" okay? \nRIDDICK Kept calling it \"murder\" when I did it. \nJOHNS Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto. \nRIDDICK (doping it out) Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum. \nJOHNS Trawl with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us. \nRIDDICK Nice embellishment. \nJOHNS Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent. \nRIDDICK (looking back) So which one caught your eye? \nJOHNS Don' look, don' look, don' look.... \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nFry spots Riddick's look -- and Johns' non-look. \nFRY Imam. Slow down. \nIMAM What? \nFRY Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them. \nIMAM I would rather we all stay-- \nFRY Do what I say. Please. \nEXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT \nRIDDICK What's her name, anyway? \nJOHNS What do you care? \nRiddick shrugs. \"I don't.\" \nJOHNS Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv. \n", "test3_id": 2027}

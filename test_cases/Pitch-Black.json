{"test1_input": "Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal... \nRiddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity. \nEXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nTrailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her breather. \nINT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nRiddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons. Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry. Alone. \nEXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nJohns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her some. \nFRY Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more. \nJOHNS Probably right. \nThey drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against the combing. It brings her within arm's length of... \nINT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nRiddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled. \nJOHNS (O.S.) You know, I woulda played road dog for these guys. You could've stayed back. Pro'bly should've -- because, you know, if we don't find water.... \n\"We may not make it back.\" \nFRY (O.S.) No, no, I wanted to get away. \nJOHNS (O.S.) So I noticed. Never seen a \"captain\" quite so ready to leave her ship. \nJust as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck... \nEXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nShe steps away. \nFRY Better keep moving.... \nJOHNS What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch? \nFry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND! \nJOHNS (CONT'D) Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn. \nFRY Promise me. Swear to me you won't -- \nJOHNS You see anybody else here? Just between you and me. \nFRY During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin. \nJohns blinks, stunned. \"Are you shittin' me?\" \nINT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY \nTrying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's all he wanted. \nFRY (O.S.) So now you know. \nJOHNS (O.S.) Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought. \nRiddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle, left behind. It's still got one good swallow. \nEXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY \nLeaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the hills. Ahead is a canyon. \nJOHNS Hold up. \nHe jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye. \nJOHNS (CONT'D) Didn't bite. \nFRY What? \n", "test1_true": "SCOPE POV: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle. It's still got that one swallow. \nJOHNS (CONT'D) But nah. Didn't bite. \nEXT. BONEYARD - DAY \nCLOSER on the bottle. Only we see that the scotch has been emptied -- and replaced with sand. \nEXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY \nWorking under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave. Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on... \nThe crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back. \nEXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY \nThe scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast. \nFry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. \"What are they? Just mineral deposits?\" \nPILGRIM #1 Captain...captain.... \nThe Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant. Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core. ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible? \nFRY Wait, wait, wait.... \nFry takes the \"plant,\" pushes the \"petals\" back down over the core. They all stare. It's a baseball. \nIMAM We are not alone here, yes? \nThey look ahead, wondering what awaits them. But Johns is looking back. \nJOHNS Never thought we were. \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nHIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind. Fry, Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below. \nPILGRIM #1 Assalamoo ahlaykum! \nThe GREETING ECHOES through the settlement, built from stacked shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. A rusty bike lies on the ground. \nPILGRIM #2 Assalamoo ahlaykum! \nJOHNS Long gone. Whoever they were. \nThey move around a building -- and pull up short. Before them looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair. Old jugs litter the ground. \nIMAM Water...water there was here.... \nPILGRIMS Allahu Akbar.... \nIMAM (translating) \"God is Great,\" yes? \nJOHNS I'm born-again. \nFry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the abandoned buildings. \"Who were these people? Why did they leave so much behind?\" \nINT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nThrough a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting... \nRefectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust. \nPhotos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing baseball. Posing with children. \nINT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nFry enters a dark room. \nFRY Lights. \nNo response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she throws them open to reveal... \nA man standing right outside. \nJOHNS (through window) Hey. Don't go too far, huh? \n", "test1_id": 2025, "test2_input": "JOHNS I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat. \nEXT. SKIFF - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nJohns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field table in the shade of the skiff. He seems out of earshot. Now, anyway. As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs through Johns. \nRIDDICK Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat. \nJohns moves on. The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of Vectran (wing-fabric material). They drop it on the table. Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was just there. \nRIDDICK (looking after Johns) I'll cut. \nHe has the knife. \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nAs Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat. \nEXT. SKIFF - DAY \nCLOSE on the knife slicing through the Vectran. \nRiddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old Berber rug-weaver. Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on... \nThe setting blue sun. Nothing unusual. Yet. \nINT. SKIFF - DAY \nThe hatch closes, seals. \nCLOSE on a monitor. A \"HULL INTEGRITY TEST\" is underway. Fry scans rising pressure gauges. \nRIDDICK (O.S.) Looks like we're a few shy.... \nFry whirls. Riddick is aboard, staring at the depleted battery bay. And he has Imam's blade. \nRIDDICK (CONT'D) Power cells. \nFRY They're coming. \nRIDDICK Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet. (half-beat) Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape. \nFRY I got the quick-and-ugly version. \nRIDDICK An' now you're worried about a repeat of history? \nFRY Entered our minds. \nRIDDICK I asked what you thought. \nFRY You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now? \nShe finds the courage to turn her back on him. Riddick moves closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. The cabin pressure builds. \nRIDDICK Think Johns is an do-right man? You think I can trust him to cut me loose? \nA beat. Does Riddick already know? Is he testing her? \nFRY Why, what'd you hear? \nRIDDICK Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive. (reading her face) Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed. \nIt knocks her off stride, but... \nFRY Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on each other -- no matter how hard you try. \nRiddick moves right up behind her. \nRIDDICK I don't truly know what's gonna happen when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I do know that once the dyin' starts, this little psycho family of ours is gonna rip itself apart. So you better find out the truth. Come nightfall, you better know exactly who's standing behind you. \nA monitor chirps the news: \"HULL INTEGRITY --100%.\" EXHALING GASSES, the hatch opens automatically. \nRIDDICK Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask why your crew-pal had to scream like that 'fore he died. \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nCLOSEUPS: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box... pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an eager arm vein. \n", "test2_true": "Shirt off, Johns looks up. She's in the doorway. \nFRY (CONT'D) You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like -- \nJOHNS I never said I was. \nFRY Never said you were a hype, either. \nShe moves closer. Rummages through his stuff brazenly. Finds a shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules. \nJOHNS You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what? \nFRY And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you born lucky? \nJOHNS Not a problem unless you're gonna make -- \nFRY (lashing) You made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team. \nJOHNS Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact. \nFRY Anything else we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when -- \nHe catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing her into an embrace. We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine. \nJOHNS My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord. (giving her hands back) So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business. \nFRY You coulda helped. And you didn't. \nO.S., we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for \"Captain, Captain....\" \nJOHNS Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first. Right, \"captain\"? \nIt cuts deep. \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nFry and Johns move outside. The others have gathered, all eyes gang-locked on... \nAn arch in the sky. Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon. \nPARIS What do my eyes see? \nFRY It's starting.... \nThey watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two suns. Shazza shakes out of the trance first. \nSHAZZA (to Fry) If we need anything from the crash ship -- I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's solar. \nEXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY \nMULTIPLE SHOTS: Shazza cranking the sand-cat...hands snatching up lights, water, ropes...Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat. \nFRY LET'S GET THOSE CELLS! \nSand-cat moving...Riddick jumping onto the rear bed....Paris and Audrey running, catching up. \nSHAZZA We stay together! C'mon! \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY \nJohns doubles back, grabs his shotgun shells, swings out the door... \nEXT. INCINERATOR - SETTLEMENT - DAY \n...and catches up to the sand-cat. Riddick reels him aboard. \nRIDDICK Don't wanna miss this. \nAUDREY Lookit. Lookit! \nThey turn back to see the rim of a giant planet. It's cresting over the horizon. The luminous arch is the planet's rings. \nEXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY \nThe sand-cat storms through the canyon. As it passes through the massive ribcage... \nThe ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones. \n", "test2_id": 2026, "test3_input": "The open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases his head and a light around the door to spot... \nHatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food. \nJOHNS (to others) Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones that musta -- \nSomething WHOOSHES for his head, swinging like a scythe. It catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us... \nA flash-image of an adult predator. Up close. \nIn one thin second, Johns is back with the others. \nJOHNS Very big beads. \nPARIS Not staying in here another.... \nHe goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night. Fry lunges for him. \nFRY Christ, you don't know what's out there! \nPARIS I know what's in here! \nIMAM Everybody come, this way and we should be safe. Hurry, please.... \nINT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nImam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed. At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a SCRATCHING. \nJohns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts the gasses to illuminate... \nThe door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY BLOWS drive everyone back. \nRIDDICK (to Johns) Can you do sumpin' else with that? 'Sides holding it in my fucking face? \nTaking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the blades of the predators. \nINT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nAn burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as... \nINT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nPredators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING, sweeping, hunting. \nINT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nSERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch just as the predators break into the container being vacated, always entering darkness. \nINT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nInside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the cargo with their bodies. \nRiddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind... \nPARIS Hello, hello? \n...and moves to the front of the container where darkness prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles. \nRIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the open container, the one where Johns found predators. \nSensing energy, Riddick lifts his face. \nRIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo, eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull. \nSensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS. \nPREDATOR POV: Of Riddick. \n(NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression without detail. We're \"seeing\" what the predator hears with echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its subject in 3-D space.) \nOblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey, Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back. \"Where's Riddick?\" \nHe's in a stare-down with a predator. \nSearching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head caught in a vice-like grip. \nRIDDICK Don't. Move. \n", "test3_true": "And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made of. \nCLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss. \nMore blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments. One test-slices Riddick's shirt. \nINT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nIn the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the escape hatch: \nFRY Imam? Where are they? \nINT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nCLOSE on a predator's scythe blade. It test-slices the pilgrim's skin. Blood wells up. All CLICKING CEASES. \nIMAM (O.S.) Hasan? \nFRY (O.S.) Riddick? \nTIGHT on the pilgrim -- more scared now that the clicking has stopped. Losing his nerve, he bolts. \nRIDDICK No.... \nThe predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM. \nRIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him. \nMaking his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the escape hatch as... \nFry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit... \nThe predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the beast HOWLS and flails back. \nHOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked up, Johns is BLASTING shadows. \nFRY Stop it, stop it, STOP IT! \nJOHNS 'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it. \nThey give him a look. \"Sure you did.\" Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS to the floor, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash- pattern. \"Christ, he did kill one.\" \nFry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass. Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams. \nFRY There.... \nPARIS Like the light is scalding it. \nFRY It hurts them. Light actually hurts them.... \nVULTURE SOUNDS from the two O.S. adolescents, fighting over the scraps of the pilgrim. \nIMAM Is that...Hasan? \nRiddick nods. \nJOHNS We'll burn a candle for him later. C'mon. \nINT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT \nCargo has been shoved against the door and walls. The survivors gather around Fry's handlight. Audrey -- tough little Audrey -- has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush. \nFRY ...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I think two more.... \nPARIS Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well. \nFRY How many bottles? \nPARIS Not sure. Ten? \nFRY Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? (reading his face) If you got a receipt? \nPARIS Possibly. \nFRY Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light. \nJOHNS Enough for what? \n", "test3_id": 2027}

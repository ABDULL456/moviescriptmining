CUT TO : 
INT. STAGE -- SAME TIME 
The Peasants/hooded figures raise their axes. They suddenly have the manner of executioners... They stand ready to fell Madame Ranevsky's beloved orchard. 
JULIE (as Madame Ranevsky) One last look at these walls, these windows...Dear mother used to love to walk about in this room. 
GAYEV My sister! My sister! 
ANYA (O.S.) Mamma! 
TROFIMOV (V.O.) Aa-oo! 
JULIE (as Madame Ranevsky) We're coming. The sound of the HOODED FIGURES as they chop the trees behind her. It's horrific. Madame Ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls to the ground...and begins to weep... 
INT. CAR - SAME TIME 
HENRY Stop the car! 
MAX Henry! 
HENRY Joe, stop the car. 
MAX He can't stop the car, it's the getaway! 
JOE Yeah, you can't -- 
HENRY 
STOP THE FUCKING CAR! Joe screeches to a halt. Henry gets out of the car. 
MAX What the hell are you doing? Henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he can... Max sticks his head out the window. 
MAX (CONT'D) Henry! But he's already gone... 
INT. STAGE - SAME TIME 
The HOODED FIGURES finish destroying the orchard. TREES litter the stage... Madame Ranevsky still holds her hands over her ears on the ground... 
As the cacophony ends, she gets up slowly and turns to walk off the stage... 
SHE FREEZES : 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER Coming down the aisle is HENRY as LOPHAKIN Pause. He comes closer. He's limping slightly.... 
LOPHAKIN I had to come back. I couldn't get on the train. The moment I stepped on the platform, the blood drained from my heart. ON JULIE, in shock. 
LOPHAKIN (CONT'D) I knew I might never see you again. He steps up on the stage... 
ON DAREK 
DAREK What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?! 
ON HENRY 
LOPHAKIN I had to come back. 
MADAME RANEVSKY 
(A WHISPER) Henry, what is this? What are you doing? 
LOPHAKIN This is the only way you'll listen to me. She looks out to the audience. EAGER FACES awaiting Madame Ranevsky's response... 
MADAME RANEVSKY You should have gotten on that stupid train. You made a mistake. 
LOPHAKIN The mistake would have been getting on that train without telling you how I feel. 
MADAME RANEVSKY Ha! Don't pretend you care about me. All you care about is money. 
She tries to get past him. He blocks her. 
LOPHAKIN You think this is about money? 
MADAME RANEVSKY Yes. He grabs her. 
HENRY It's never been about money. You know that. 
MADAME RANEVSKY Let go of me! 
LOPHAKIN No. 
MADAME RANEVSKY Damn it! Just leave, Henry! (under her breath) Get off the fucking stage -- 
HENRY Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow. 
MADAME RANEVSKY No, I'm perfectly happy here.

EXT. PAN ACROSS BADLANDS 
The CAMERA PANS across the badlands. There Is not a tree or a bush in sight. It comes to rest on Kit, who carries his rifle over his shoulders the way James Dean did in "Giant". 
KIT'S P.O.V. - SERIES OF ANGLES 
Various sights of the prairie a distant mountain, a wild turkey, a lizard, a burst of lightening in a cloud on the horizon, a falcon. Kit takes all this in, then he turns back to the campsite. The sun is down, just barely, and the moon has risen behind him. Holly is heard over this last shot. 
HOLLY (v.o.) We lived in utter loneliness, neither here nor there. Kit said that solitude was a better word, cause it meant more exactly what I wanted to say. Whatever the expression, I told him we couldn't go on living this way. 
INT. CADILLAC 
Kit and Holly sit in the back seat of the Cadillac. They have been necking. Her hair is in curlers. 
KIT (responding to v.o.) Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching. 
HOLLY Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat. 
KIT Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains. 
He kisses her. She gives in reluctantly. After a while they break. 
KIT Everybody loves trout. 
HOLLY I'm serious. 
They neck some more. then break again. Kit looks out one window, Holly out the other. 
EXT. DISTANT TRAIN 
A train moves slowly across the horizon. 
HOLLY (v.o.) In the distance I saw a train making its way silently across the plain, like the caravan in "The Adventures of Marco Polo." It was our first taste of civilization in days, and I asked Kit if we could have a closer look. 
EXT. KIT - WITH FOOTBALL 
Kit sets a football down on the ground, backs off a few steps, squats and shoots a hole through it with his pistol. To his surprise. it does not deflate. He moves closer and pounds it flat with the barrel of the pistol. 
HOLLY (v.o.) Before we left he shot a football that he considered excess baggage. 
TIGHT ON SUITCASE 
Kit is burying some things from Holly's suitcase in a bucket the trophy he took from the mansion, her stereopticon slides, a doll, a spark plug, a pack of Camels, etc. 
HOLLY (v.o.) Afterwards he took and buried some of our things in a bucket. He said that nobody else would know where we'd put them, and that we'd come back someday, maybe, and they'd still be sitting here, just the same, but we'd be different. And if we never got back, well, somebody might dig them up a thousand years from now and wouldn't they wonder! 
EXT. BADLANDS 
The Cadillac speeds across the plains. A plume of dust stretches out behind it.

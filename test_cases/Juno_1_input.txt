WOMAN #1 And I was like, "No offense, sweetie, but nobody looks good in gauchos." 
WOMAN #2 Especially not with her build. 
JUNO (mimicking the women, Peanuts-style) Wah-wah-waaah! 
One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa's sleeve. Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play area and begins to play energetically with her. 
Juno watches intently, but Leah just snickers. 
LEAH She's gonna steal that kid for her collection. 
JUNO Right, seriously. 
They watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children. 
LEAH Bo-ring! 
Leah stands up. Juno lingers for a moment. 
INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - ELEVATOR BANK - A HALF HOUR LATER 
Leah and Juno approach the elevator. 
JUNO I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously. 
LEAH God, Spermy. Must you always feed? 
The elevator door opens, revealing... Vanessa. 
VANESSA Juno? 
Juno tries her best to look enthused. 
JUNO Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today? 
VANESSA Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends. 
LEAH You're gay? 
Juno glares at Leah. 
VANESSA (confused) No... 
JUNO Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged. 
VANESSA Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling? 
JUNO Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now! 
She lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out NAVEL. 
VANESSA That's great. 
Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces. 
JUNO Dude, it's moshing all over. 
Vanessa looks confused. 
JUNO (explains) It's kicking. 
Vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the courage for an unusual request. 
VANESSA Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it? 
JUNO Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.

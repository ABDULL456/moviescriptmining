She charges. At the last second, Roadie spots her. 
ROADIE Duck! 
Roadie and Coach duck into the water, but Heroine is unable to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. Sister Beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey. Roadie aims his water-dripping gun, but Heroine rises and blocks his shot. 
ROADIE Stay down! 
From her knees, Heroine fires. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The three shots push Sister Beast #1 backwards. Heroine rises, covered in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face. 
HEROINE Go! The bitch is mine! 
Roadie and Coach reluctantly turn, leaving Heroine to fend with the Beast. 
Heroine charges. Hissing, Sister Beast #1 charges as well. 
Heroine pumps and fires. BOOM! Sister Beast spins, avoiding the shot. Now too close, Heroine jams the Beast in the mouth with the gun, knocking her back. 
Sister Beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm. 
Heroine bats her away. Sister Beast #1 moves to the others. 
HEROINE Look out! 
Roadie and Coach sprint until Sister Beast #2 BURSTS through the tunnel walls, stopping Roadie and Coach in their tracks. 
Roadie fires his weapon, but it sparks and fizzles. 
ROADIE The shells are wet! 
With the two Beasts closing in. The men are trapped. Coach looks around, seeing a plan. 
COACH Grab onto ceiling and get out of water! 
ROADIE What? 
COACH Do it!!! 
Grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling, Roadie pulls himself from the water. Coach uses the machete to cut a power cord from above. He grabs the exposed, sparking end. 
COACH (to Heroine) Get out of water!!! 
Heroine sees what he's doing, sprints back the way they came. 
As the two Beasts charge, Coach pulls himself out of the water by holding onto the above piping. He's forced to wait for Heroine to get out of the water. 
The second she does, he jams the cord into the water. 
ZAP! The conductive water sizzles. Sister Beast #1 and Sister Beast #2 lock up and crash. ELECTROCUTION. Sparks and smoke rises from their cooked bodies. 
Roadie and Coach look to each other, victorious. They begin shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel. 
INT. TUNNEL/BASEMENT -- NIGHT 
Heroine looks back at the two men. She turns and reenters the basement. 
GAH! Teen Beast drops in front of her, whacking her to the floor. Heroine slides across the floor, but jumps up quickly. Teen Beast cautiously moves in for the kill. 
Heroine raises her weapon. 
HEROINE You fuck with my family. (aiming shotgun) I fuck right back! 
Click -- out of ammo! 
HEROINE Oh shit. 
Heroine THROWS the shotgun at him and pulls out the MACHETE. 
She rolls left and swings. Teen Beast loses two fingers. 
She swings again but gets whacked to the floor. 
Heroine rolls with the hit, grabs her shotgun, and dives into the KEG ELEVATOR. 
She slams closed the door as Teen Beast regains its composure and lunges. BAM! It CRASHES against the door. 
INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT 
Roadie and Coach crawl to the platform by the exit.

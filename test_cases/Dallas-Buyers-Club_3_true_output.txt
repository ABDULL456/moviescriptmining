T.J. I heard you get that just by touchin' someone. Or that queers get it. 
RON Which is exactly why it's a mistake. 
T.J. Well, what if it ain't? 
RON You know me, T.   You fuckin' serious? 
T.J. Damn right I know you, like you was born with some kinda pussy addiction. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 13 
Ron smiles at the compliment as T.J. dives into the mirror and inhales the last line of coke. 
One of the GIRLS walks over. 
KELLY You said we would be dancin' by nine. 
T.J. smiles at Ron. 
T.J. We should get goin'. 
T.J. puts on his jacket. 
T.J. Let's go girls. 
RON I'll catch up with you. 
T.J. Alright brother, you cool? 
RON I'm cool. 
T.J. See you there. 
T.J. and the girls leave. 
Ron gets up, wasted, and stares out the screen door into the cold dark night, nothing stares back at him. 
17   INT. DALLAS PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY                                 17 
Ron is seated in front of a screen that shows a microfiche of information on AIDS, HIV and AZT. 
LATER - DAY: Ron continues reading; the LIBRARIAN looks over as he endures a brief coughing spasm, then he goes back to his work. We PUSH IN on the phrase"...Unprotected sex..." 
LATER - DAY: Ron continues reading, runs his finger along the words. Stops at "INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE". As he closes his eyes and exhales-- 
18   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT - DREAM / FLASHBACK                           18 
We're on a SNAKE TATOO on the back of a naked girl having wild sex with a younger and heavier Ron, totally wasted, and... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 14 
hypnotized by the tattoo that goes up to her neck and down to her arm -- marked with track marks. 
19   INT. DALLAS PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY                                 19 
Ron slams the book shut with rage. He screams out releasing his anger. His voice echoes off the library walls. 
20   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - RECEPTION AREA - DAY                20 
Ron impatiently stands at the Triage desk, looking at a NURSE, 40s. He spots a tattooed Hispanic ORDERLY mopping the floor in the hallway. He locks eyes with Ron for a second too long then moves on. 
NURSE FRAZIN Dr. Sevard's not on today. 
RON Do I look like I can wait til tomorrow? 
NURSE FRAZIN If you'll tell me what the problem is -- 
RON Problem? Which problem you want to hear about? My lungs bleeding, my skin crawling, the jackhammer in my head... hell that's just the beginning of my problems sweetheart. 
Having overheard Ron's rant, Dr. Eve Saks walks over. 
EVE Mr. Woodroof?

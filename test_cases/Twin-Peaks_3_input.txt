LAURA Mom...  what are you wearing? 
Sarah looks down.  She is wearing the sweater that she is looking for. 
SARAH My god, I am going to have another breakdown.  God, god. 
LAURA Mom, take it easy. 
Laura starts down the stairs towards her mother. 
SARAH No, no... this can't be happening. 
Laura holds her mother. 
LAURA Mom, you're not having a nervous breakdown. 
Sarah pulls away from Laura and wanders into the living room.  Laura watches her go feeling helpless. 
119.    INT.  JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - DAY 
LEO JOHNSON is ragging on Shelly.  He is down on his hands and knees showing her how to scrub the floor. 
LEO Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is.  Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is. 
SHELLY Lay off the bennies, Leo. 
LEO (continuing his tirade) Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere.  To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface. (shouting) WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY. 
He scrubs more. 
LEO (continued) That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, - HOW TO CLEAN.  It takes scrubbing, Shelly.  There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY. 
SHELLY As if I didn't know. 
LEO I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it. 
SHELLY Come off it, Leo.  I'm late for work... 
LEO What did you say? 
Leo goes over the top pulls Shelly down to the floor. 
LEO Shelly, I am not fooling around anymore. The first thing you've got to WORK on is a good attitude.  That's the key. Anybody will tell you that. 
Gives her a good shot to the back of the head.  Shelly falls to the floor.  The phone rings.  Leo gets up to get the phone. 
LEO Don't even _think_ about going anywhere, Shelly.  I'm not finished with you. 
He answers the phone. 
LEO What are you doing calling me here?... No way, you already owe me money... Five thousand, to be exact. 
Leo looks over at Shelly suspiciously.  (Did she hear him mention the five thousand?) 
SHELLY (silently mouthing it) Five Thousand???

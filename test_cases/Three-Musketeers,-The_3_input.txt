33   INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY                                       33 
Anne, or rather, Queen Anne, steps into the throne room, a massive cathedral-like chamber. Twin thrones occupy a raised dais. An entire wall is covered with a spectac- ular map of the world. The map contains every known country and continent, including the New World. The SENESCHAL exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom. Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. And for the first time, she looks and acts her age. Barely a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings and queens who came before her. And a long way from home. Anne steps to the great map of the world. She reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a pang of separation. We hear: MAN (O.S.) Your Majesty... 
Anne reacts with a start. A tall, powerfully built man stands in the shadows, a spectre in red. ANNE Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised me. Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness.     He smiles. 
RICHELIEU How was your ride? 
Richelieu's question takes her by surprise. He bows before Anne. Considering a reply, she extends her hand. The Cardinal kisses it. 
ANNE My ride...?    Well, I... I'm not sure... RICHELIEU (rising up) Forgive me. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
33   CONTINUED:                                                     33 RICHELIEU (CONT'D) But your welfare is more than a matter of personal interest. It is a matter of State. But rest assured, your secret is safe with me. 
His manner is both charming and paternal. Anne, smart enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings, is nonetheless touched by his concern. 
ANNE Thank you. Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently. 
RICHELIEU You're homesick. ANNE (after a beat) Lonely. Is that the same thing? RICHELIEU Sometimes. Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues: RICHELIEU Austria's loss is France's gain. ANNE I'm not sure my new husband shares your opinion. RICHELIEU Nonsense.    He's young, not blind. 
ANNE Mostly, he is absent. I've barely seen His Majesty since our wedding, and that was three months ago. Whenever he's around me, he has nothing to say. 
RICHELIEU Arranged marriages can be difficult. Your father and I thought yours would bring Austria and France closer together.

33   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             33 ANNE Countries align more swiftly than people, I'm afraid. Louis and I remain... far apart. RICHELIEU May I advise you? 
He says it with seeming humility, not condescension.        Anne nods assent. 
RICHELIEU Louis was only nine years old when his father was assassinated. He lost his childhood forever that day. I have watched him grow toward manhood, seen the toll his life demands. A boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man. He is shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet stubborn. But most of all, he is not yet sure exactly who he is. The boy who lost his father. Or the King of France. ANNE But how can I...? 
RICHELIEU Flatter him. Make the boy feel like a King. So that the King may be your husband. 
Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply... when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull boom, the Seneschal chants: 
SENESCHAL His Majesty, the King. 
The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face is handsome and intelligent. 
RICHELIEU Your Majesty. LOUIS Cardinal Richelieu, I've been looking for you. 
As Louis strides toward them, Richelieu and Anne bow. (CONTINUED) 
33   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              33 When Louis sees Anne, he reacts with an almost imper- ceptible start. Her presence catches him off guard. 
LOUIS Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn't know you were here. 
Louis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love, behind a formal veneer. Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's confidences, replies:

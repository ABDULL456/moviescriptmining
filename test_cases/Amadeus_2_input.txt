FRAU SCHLUMBERG Michael! 
MOZART Perhaps if I were to play a little first, it might encourage the Fraulein. (to the girl) Why don't you let me try the instrument? All right? 
Suddenly the girl rises. Mozart smiles at the parents. They smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands and preludes over the keys. Instantly a dog howls loudly. Startled, Mozart stops. Schlumberg leaps to his feet and goes over to the beagle. 
SCHLUMBERG Stop that, Dudelsachs! Stop it at once! (to Mozart) Don't let him disturb you. He'll be all right. He's just a little willful too. Please, please - play. I beg you. 
Mozart resumes playing. This time it is a lively piece, perhaps the Presto Finale from the K. 450. The dog howls immediately. 
SCHLUMBERG Stop it! STOP! 
Mozart stops. 
SCHLUMBERG No, not you. I was talking to the dog. You keep playing. It's most important. He always howls when he hears music. We've got to break them of the habit. Play, please. Please! 
Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again. The dog howls louder. 
SCHLUMBERG That's it. Now keep going, just keep going. (to the beagle) Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs, you stop it this instant! This instant, do you hear me? Keep going, Herr Mozart, that's it. Go on, go on! 
Mozart plays on. Suddenly the dog falls silent. Schlumberg smiles broadly. 
SCHLUMBERG Good, good, good! Very good dog! Very, very good Dudelsachs. (to his wife, snapping his fingers) Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit. 
The wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits. A servant brings in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray. He puts it down beside Mozart as Schlumberg addresses the silent dog with deepest affection. 
SCHLUMBERG Now guess who's going to get a nice reward? Clever, clever Dudi. 
He gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily. Mozart stops playing and stands up. 
SCHLUMBERG It's a miracle, Herr Mozart! 
MOZART (barely controlling himself) Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir! 
He bows to them and leaves the room. They look after him in puzzled astonishment. 
FRAU SCHLUMBERG What a strange young man. 
SCHLUMBERG Yes. He is a little strange. 
EXT. A BUSY STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S 
A cheerful scene. We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers, sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons. Horses and carriage clatter past him. His mood is best expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on the forte-piano. 
Still in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house. 
INT. MOZART'S HOUSE - HALLWAY -  DAY - 1780'S 
Suddenly, he stops. He looks up the stairs. The grim opening chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march from Figaro. What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, standing on the landing. The light comes from behind the figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession. It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held before Mozart realizes who it is. Then, as the music continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's arms. 
MOZART Papa! PAPA! 
Both men embrace. The music slowly fades. 
INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S 
A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages. We see music lying everywhere. Also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food. 
Mozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health. 
MOZART Why are you here? 
LEOPOLD Am I not welcome? 
MOZART Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa! 
He kisses his hands. 
LEOPOLD You're very thin. Does she not feed you, this wife of yours? 
Mozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the landing. 
MOZART Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see. 
LEOPOLD Is she not here? 
MOZART I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi! 
Leopold looks about him at the mess in the room. 
LEOPOLD Do you always live like this? 
MOZART Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see. 
He carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the bedroom. Constanze lies in bed. She sits up, startled. 
MOZART Oh! I didn't know you were home. Stanzi, this is my father. 
Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold. Leopold stares back from the doorway. 
MOZART We'll wait, we'll wait. Why don't you get up now, darling? 
He closes the door again. 
MOZART She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me. 
LEOPOLD Don't you have a maid? 
MOZART Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself. 
LEOPOLD How is your financial situation? 
MOZART It couldn't be better. 
LEOPOLD That's not what I hear. 
MOZART What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here. 
LEOPOLD They say you're in debt. 
MOZART Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!

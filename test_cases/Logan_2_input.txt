Logan crosses to the -- 
INT. TRUCK STOP MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
We look at a half closed handicapped stall door as Logan and Charles shuffle about inside. 
CHARLES Stop it. For God's sake I can do that myself! 
LOGAN Well, you're not doing it! 
EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY 
As Logan wheels Charles back to the car, he looks over at the bucking bronco ride. LAURA'S GONE. 
INT. TRUCK STOP CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY 
Laura walks down an aisle, looking at the colorful products. She grabs a can of Pringles, starts in on it. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                46. 
Then she stops and looks at a floor display of Hypno, Mag and all the variations of "energy drinks." Laura grabs a can, opens it and takes a long drink. She's bouncing as she walks now... 
A CLERK looks up from his phone at her eating snacks. 
Laura stops at a SUNGLASS RACK, munching. Notices a pair of shades. Puts them on, eats more, looking at herself. 
CLERK Yo. Girlie. You gotta pay for that. 
Laura looks up with her mouth full. She starts for the door. 
The Clerk blocks her way. She just looks up at him. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Where's your mommy and daddy? 
She continues staring. Shoves some Pringles in her mouth. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Alright, that's enough-- 
He swipes the Pringles can from her hand, about to take the sunglasses from her nose, when, in a terrifyingly swift move, she throws the clerk to the floor, straddling him, hand on his throat the other raised-- SNIKT-- claws out. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Holy shit! Oh God Jesus, No! 
That's when a hand again grabs Laura by the wrist. 
LOGAN Not okay. 
Logan pushes Laura to the door turns to the clerk-- 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Sorry. 
--then grabs a handful of CIGARS and A PHONE CHARGER, stealing a look at a security camera on his way out. 
INT. EXT LIMO -- OKLAHOMA -- NIGHT 
A great starry sky as the desert becomes the plains. The limo sits, parked along a flat stretch of Oklahoma highway. 
Laura and Charles are asleep in back. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                47. 
Logan sits up front in the darkness, legs across the bench, staring at the road ahead and then at the Pennysaver clipping for the boat on his visor. And the envelope of cash. 
A billboard up ahead hypes GAMBLING AND SHOWS IN OKLAHOMA CITY, 50 miles away. 
There is a small beep. Logan sighs, looks down to Gabriela's pink phone plugged into the charger. It's come to life. He raises the partition and hits play. 
ON THE PHONE SCREEN -- PART TWO OF GABRIELA'S VIDEO : 
WE SEE A "STAFF MEMBER" PINNED ON THE FLOOR, SKIN SMOKING, his neck being gripped by a 9 year old with glowing eyes. People scream. "Leo! Basta! Basta!" The boy leans back and starts crying. The staff member is dead. 
GABRIELA As the children became older, they became difficult to control. 
ANOTHER SURREPTITIOUS VIDEO. A BUMPY SKINNED CHILD expertly shoots an automatic weapon into target dummies in an indoor range. SUDDENLY THEY TURN AND SHOOT THE INSTRUCTOR. SCREAMS. 
A MOVING SHOT. THE BOY WITH GLOWING EYES is chased by security up a staircase to a rooftop. An alarm whoops. The boy lands outside and, for a moment, breathes air and stares at Mexico City. Panicked staff yell to him in Spanish as -- 
THE BOY THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE LEDGE. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) They taught them to kill-- but they did not remove their hearts. 
ANOTHER CHILD IS FORCIBLY CUFFED IN A NOW FAMILIAR RESTRAINT SYSTEM, hissing, spitting, VIBRATING, loose objects flying around the room. OTHER CHILDREN WATCH. Some weep. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) They could not be controlled. 
ANOTHER SHOT -- A trickle of blood runs to a drain. TILT TO FIND A YOUNG LAURA IN A SMOCK, seemingly drugged, SITTING on the floor of a tiled room. She stares at her arm as she cuts it with a metal claw, then watches it heal, then cuts again. 
The camera/phone drops and we see a dutched image of Laura as Gabriela comforts her, saying "What are you doing, baby?" in Spanish. Laura cries on her shoulder. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  48. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) A soldier who cannot be controlled is not a good soldier. 
A LONG LENS GLIMPSE OF THE RED HAIRED MAN, temperamental, gesticulating, walking up a corridor, trailed by PIERCE. 
NOW A SHOT FROM A MOVING CAR-- OF A WINDOWLESS STRUCTURE. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Inside this building is something new. Something better than X-23. 
STOLEN SHOTS FROM IN THE NEW BUILDING-- FLASHES OF TANKS CONTAINING ADULT HUMAN ORGANS, LIMBS submerged in liquids on collagen forms: arms, hearts, feet-- some being harvested. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) I got inside yesterday. 
THE RED HAIRED MAN confers with technicians. A Reaver notices Gabriela who hides her camera/phone. She claims (in Spanish) to be lost.

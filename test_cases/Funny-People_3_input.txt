INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Leo pulls Ira into the other room and goes off on him. 
LEO He asked for me to write jokes too and you didn't tell me! 
IRA Uh...yes. 
LEO You .fucker! 
IRA I didn't think you would want to. 
LEO Why wouldn't I want to? What, I don't like money? I don't like private jets? 
IRA I'm sorry, it's just, I needed the gig. And you are doing so much better than me. I guess I just wanted this for myself. 
LEO It wasn't yours to keep for yourself. You lied to me. 
IRA I did. And it was fucked up. And I am sorry. I don't know what to say. 
LEO Don't say anything. Just get your shit, and get out of the apartment. 
IRA Are you serious? 
LEO You don't get let off the hook for going into faggy apology mode. That is a terrible strategy. 
(MORE) 
LEO (CONT'D) I don't know what the fuck has happened to you--but my name is on the lease, and I don't want to live with it. 
INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
Ira is mad at George for bringing up the jokes. 
IRA I never told Leo because I wanted the gig? 
GEORGE I didn't know you were fucking over your friend. Don't yell at me. 
IRA Well I fucking live with you now because he told me to leave. 
GEORGE He kicked you out for that. 
IRA He said friends don't lie and I'm fucking with his career. 
GEORGE Well in a way that's a compliment to me because he's so mad he can't hang out with me that's he mad at you. That's kind of cool. I got you kicked out. 
IRA Fuck off. 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Ira is unpacking a dufflebag of clothes he grabbed from his apartment when he was kicked out. George pops his head in. 
GEORGE This should be comfortable in here. This room is almost as big as your old apartment. 
IRA (through gritted teeth) Thank you for letting me stay here. 
GEORGE No problem. Hey, you want to come talk to me while I crash? 
IRA No. You want to come talk to me while I crash? 
CUT TO: 
INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
George is under the covers. He turns on the TV and he changes channels until he finds "Charlie Rose." They're interviewing a reporter from the New York Times about America's policy towards Pakistan. 
GEORGE All right, Charlie. Talk to me. George closes his eyes.

The door knocks.   Paul gets up, angry. 
TATIANA Please, Paul, 'til first light. 
PAUL Dawn. Then they go. 
Paul opens the door, it's Odette, holding the hand of Paul's eldest daughter. 
ODETTE Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that Roger has gone. 
Tatiana comes over instantly, worried. 
TATIANA Gone where? Tell me, Danielle. Their daughter Danielle answers. 
DANIELLE Next door, mama. He was afraid for his friend Simon. He went to fetch him. 
EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT 
Roger crawls between the shrubs.      He hears ANGRY VOICES. 
He peers through the long grass. 
Sees: Hutu soldiers boots, feet in sneakers, bare women's feet. And among them the glint of machetes, hoes, a club spiked with nails, a length of chain CLANGING on the ground. 
EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT 
Tatiana rushes out the front door, Paul after her. 
Paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth. 
PAUL Shhhhh. 
SHOUTS next door. Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car. A beat. More SHOUTS. Paul takes his hand from her mouth. She's sobbing. E 
EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD. NIGHT 
Roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs. Feet, a crowd, leaving, through a gate. Engines rev. 
Roger crawls from the bushes. 
Crawls across, the driveway, crawls through a puddle. 
Then stops, SEES SOMETHING, AN (UNSEEN) HORROR! 
EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT 
Paul and Tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand headed towards the rear gate. 
Paul searches along the chain link fence, finds a section loose, he pulls it back, clambers underneath it. Tatiana clasps her mouth, afraid to utter a cry. 
EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT Paul crawls through this scrub tunnel. 
Then he hears BRANCHES SNAPPING. He moves toward the sound. Discovers Roger, terrified, thrashing in a tangle of bushes. He grabs Rogers shirt, pulls him as the little boy startles. PAUL Ssshh! Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his arms and rushes him to the house. 
INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT 
Paul bursts through the back door and sets Roger down.   Tatiana is beside them. 
TATIANA Roger! 
Paul turns the flashlight on Roger. Tatiana pulls back in horror: Roger is covered in blood. Her SCREAMS, stifled by fear. 
TATIANA (CONT'D) Oh, my God! PAUL Where are you hurt, son? 
oger stares blankly. Odette is beside them now. 
ODETTE Get his clothes off. 
Hands pull and tear his clothes off. Towels wipe him down. Odette looks all over his body with the flashlight. Despite the blood Roger has no injuries. 
PAUL What happened, son? Where did you get this blood? 
But Roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized. Children cry. 
ODETTE He's not injured. 
His paralysis freaks the women in the room. Paul turns angrily to them. 
PAUL Leave us, give us some space. 
He ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (to Tatiana) The neighbors must go at dawn. 
Tatiana hugs her son. 
EXT. KIGALI. DAWN 
The faintest grey of dawn over the city. Then a flock of birds rises as one in the distance. A millisecond later, the cause of their flight, a grenade explosion, echoes. 
The birds dart, in another direction as the STACCATO of a machine gun rips the air. 
INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. DAWN 
PAUL sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window. 
Behind him Tatiana has Roger cradled in her arms, he still trembles wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk. 
TATIANA Will you take a little milk? 
Nothing. 
PAUL Let him sleep. 
The door knocks. The old guard calls in frightened.

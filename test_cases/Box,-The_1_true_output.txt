ARTHUR (CONT'D) Norma... what happened? 
NORMA I don't know. Norma notices Walter standing in the doorway. 
WALTER You came home an hour ago. 
NORMA We did? She sits up in bed... looking at the clock radio. It is 6PM. 
WALTER Neither of you said a word... you just walked into the house like two zombies. Went straight to bed. Arthur and Norma stare at one another, trying to make sense of what has just transpired. 
NORMA The wedding. It starts in an hour. We've got to get ready.

INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BATHROOM -- LATER ON 
Norma, now wearing her BRIDESMAID DRESS, puts a DIAMOND EARRING in her right lobe. She turns to the mirror and jumps in her skin... as the face staring back at her has no eyelids. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- WALTER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT 
Arthur sits on the end of Walter's bed. Walters stands in front of him as his father ties his NECK TIE in front of a standing mirror. 
WALTER What's going on? 
ARTHUR I don't know. 
WALTER This is about the box... isn't it? 
ARTHUR Yeah. 
WALTER Did you push the button? 
ARTHUR Your mother did. 
WALTER What happens when you push the button? 
ARTHUR I don't know. 
WALTER Yes you do. You're just not telling me. Arthur finishes with his tie. He notices something on the floor of his son's bedroom. It is the MARS COMIC BOOK. He picks it up and stares at the dark figure looming on the cover. 
ARTHUR Where did you get this?

Vitti winds up to brain him with the pipe. They all wince in anticipation of the blow. But Vitti just freezes there with his arm upraised. Then he drops his arm and seems to sag. 
VITTI Forget about it. He doesn't know anything. 
He tosses the pipe aside. 
VITTI Get him outta here. 
Jimmy looks at Jelly in surprise.

Ben is driving to the party with Michael. Sitting in stopped traffic, he checks his mirrors anxiously. 
BEN (to himself, urgently) Look at this. Everybody's nuts. Ooh, I hate walking into that house late. 
MICHAEL I think you're reacting like this because you're mad we have to go to this party. 
BEN No. Don't. I'm not going to be analyzed by someone who up until a few years ago believed in Santa. Sorry, but we only have room for one Dr. Sobol in this family. 
MICHAEL But there's two Dr. Sobols. There's you and Grandpa. 
BEN (a beat) Can we talk about something else? 
MICHAEL Are you going to read Grandpa's new book? Mom says you won't because you're...

BEN Does your mother talk about anything else or is it just me twenty-four hours a day? 
Wham!   Ben REAR-ENDS the CAR in front of them. 
BEN That's your mother's fault!   Your mother did that! Damn! 
CUT TO: 
16   EXT. EAST 90TH STREET - NIGHT                                      16 
The minivan has rear-ended a black Lincoln Town Car. The trunk has sprung open and Nicky Shivers can be seen in the trunk, bound and gagged, kicking and squirming. Muffled shouts can be heard through the duct tape over his mouth. 
Jelly and Jimmy jump out of the Lincoln and slam the top of the trunk just as Ben gets out of the minivan to inspect the damage. 
JIMMY (heading Ben off) What's the matter with you?   Are you some kind of moron? 
BEN I'm sorry.   It's totally my fault. 
Ben looks at the damage. The Lincoln has gotten the worst of it. The rear bumper is hanging off, and Jelly is struggling to latch the trunk. 
JIMMY Did you see anything? 
BEN I was talking to my son.   I took my eyes off the road -- 
JIMMY Forget that bullshit.   Did you see anything? 
Jelly steps in to defuse the situation, warning Jimmy off with a look.

JELLY That's all right, sir. It's our fault for being in front of you like that. 
BEN (surprised) Well, I should have been watching. Let me give you my insurance information -- 
JELLY It's okay.   Forget about it. 
BEN Really? It looks like your whole rear end might be screwed up. 
Jimmy is reattaching the rear bumper and securing the trunk lid with duct tape. 
JELLY No, it was like that before. 
BEN Maybe we should call the police? 
JELLY (suddenly menacing) Why?    Fuck the police. 
BEN Right!   Fuck 'em. 
HORNS start HONKING behind them. 
BEN At least take my card. You might look at the damage in the morning and change your mind. 
Jelly takes the card and reads it. 
JELLY You're a doctor? 
BEN Ph.D.    Psychologist. 
JELLY A shrink. You talk to a lotta nuts, huh? 
Ben hears KICKING from inside the car trunk.

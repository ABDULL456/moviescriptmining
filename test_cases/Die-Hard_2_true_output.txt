TAKAGI Ladies and gentlemen...I congratulate each and every one of you for making this one of the greatest days in the history of the Nakatomi corporation... 
In the b.g., obviously still at work, an attractive BUSINESSWOMAN in her mid-thirties, studying a computer printout, heads toward her office.  Falling into step with her is HARRY ELLIS, thirty-seven, V.P. of Sales.  Well-dressed, with stylish, slicked-back hair, he looks and acts very smooth. 
ELLIS What about dinner? 
WOMAN (HOLLY) Harry, it's Christmas Eve.  Families... Stockings...chestnuts...Rudolph and Frosty...those things ring a bell? 
She turns into: 
5       HER OFFICE                                             5 
Her name is HOLLY GENNARO MCCLANE, though the nameplate on her door stops after the first two.  She puts the printout down on her secretary's desk. 
ELLIS (in reply) I was thinking more of roaring fireplaces...mulled wine and a nice brie... 
Holly ignores the come-on, turns to her secretary. 
HOLLY Ginny, it's 6:40, you're making me feel like Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Go on, join the party, have some champagne. 
Ginny slowly manipulates herself out of her seat.  She is enormously pregnant. 
GINNY (grateful) Thanks Ms. Gennaro. (worried) Do you think the baby can handle a little sip? 
HOLLY (eyeing her) Ginny, that baby's ready to tend bar. 
ELLIS (not giving up) How about tomorrow night? 
Holly just points to the door.  He follows Ginny out, clearly not giving up.  Just then the party on Holly's phone picks up and we: 
INTERCUT: 
6       INT. NICE HOUSE IN SANTA MONICA                        6 
where a five-year old LUCY MCCLANE races her YOUNGER BROTHER to the phone, winsthe wrestling match, and answers with a sense of importance.  An Xmas tree is in the b.g. 
LUCY McClane residence.  Lucy McClane speaking. 
Holly suddenly smiles.  It is the first time we've seen her smile and it speaks volumes about the person hidden under a tough business exterior. 
HOLLY (with affection) Hello, Lucy McClane.  This is your mother. 
She looks up and watches Ellis leave.  He "shoots" her with a "catch ya later" wink. 
LUCY Mommy!  When are you coming home?! 
HOLLY Soon.  You'll be in bed when I get there, though. 
LUCY Will you come say 'good night'? 
HOLLY Don't I always, you goose? (enjoying Lucy's giggle) Now put Paulina on the line, and no searching the house for presents! 
LUCY (caught) I didn't look in the front closet under the steps!  Is Daddy coming home with you? 
JOHN, JR. (hearing this, jumping up and down) Yeah!  Daddy!  Daddy!  Daddy! (on second thought) And a Captain Power! 
HOLLY (a little tightly) Well, we'll see what Santa and Mommy can do.  Goose, put Paulina on, okay? 
Lucy hands the phone to a young Salvadorian woman, PAULINA, the housekeeper. 
PAULINA Hello, Mrs. Holly.  You coming home soon? 
HOLLY I'm working on it. (beat) Did Mr. McClane call?                               * 
PAULINA No ma'am. 
Holly hides a trace of disappointment. 
HOLLY Well...maybe there wasn't time before               * the flight.  You should probably make up the spare room just in case. 
PAULINA (smiling) Yes, Mrs. Holly.  I do that already.                * 
Holly's smile comes through again. 
7       INT. LAX - EVENING                                     7 
McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag, comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal. He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend. 
MCCLANE (sotto, to himself) California. 
He looks around the terminal at: 
7-A     HIS P.O.V. - TERMINAL                                  7-A 
FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very touching and not the least bit corny. 
7-B     BACK TO SCENE                                          7-B 
McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting. Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure. 
MCCLANE I'm John McClane.

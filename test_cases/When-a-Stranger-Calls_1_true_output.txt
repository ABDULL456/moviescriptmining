CLIFFORD Jesus... 
GARBER He'd been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected. 
CLIFFORD Who is he? 
GARBER We found a Merchant Seaman's card on him. He's English. Entered the country less than a week ago. 
CLIFFORD How about the babysitter? 
GARBER She's going to be all right. 
As Garber delivers his final line, we see ambulance attendants dressed in white, taking a sheet-covered stretcher out the front door. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: 
EXT. STREET - LATER AFTERNOON 
An upper-class neighborhood. The CAMERA is facing down the street. A car approaches the intersection at the end of the block, turns and comes slowly up the street. 
Because it is not a new car or an expensive car, and because it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole male occupant is looking for house numbers, we can assume that the DRIVER is a visitor to this neighborhood. 
The CAMERA PANS with the car ninety degrees as it turns into the semi-circular driveway of a mansion and rolls up to the front door. 
A TITLE appears across the bottom of the screen: 
4:30 pm Thursday, April 20, 1978 
As the TITLE FADES, the driver shuts off the car engine and opens the door to get out. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANSION - DAY 
The doorbell rings. A HOUSEBOY comes into the front hall, goes to the door and opens it for the visitor. It is John Clifford, the detective from six years ago. 
He has aged noticeably over the years. His hair is grayer, his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe occupation. 
No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford across the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. Still keen in his observation of things, Clifford quickly takes in this new atmosphere. 
The house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme of melancholy. There are no bright or cheerful furnishings, and the houseboy advances with guarded tread, his face steady and reverent. 
The houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase and raps lightly on it with his knuckles. Without waiting for an answer, he opens the door and steps aside for Clifford to enter. 
Clifford pauses briefly, then walks into what appears to be an upstairs study. 
INT. STUDY - DAY 
A MAN is sitting behind a desk which faces the door. Presumably he is the master of the house. Although his face is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is engaged in writing something down. 
Clifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat in front of it. Then, vaguely in keeping with the spirit of the house, he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt the pervasive stillness. 
After a moment, the master of the house lays down his pen and leans back in his chair. Pause. 
MASTER So you're in business for yourself now. 
CLIFFORD (quietly) Yes, sir, for the past three and a half years. 
MASTER That's good. (beat) And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's escape? 
CLIFFORD Oh, yes. 
MASTER Do you think the police will... find him? 
Pause. 
CLIFFORD I know they haven't assigned anyone to it specifically. It's an old case. 
MASTER (a tinge of bitterness) An old case. (beat) Can you find him?

THE DOORS ARE OPENED 
They step into a room of living animal experiments. 
SCHREBER We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting. 
WHITE I'm nothing then. 
SCHREBER Anything but, my friend. 
The two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its movements. 
SCHREBER It feels no pain. 
White turns and starts to pace away.  Schreber reluctantly follows. 
WHITE Can I get my life back? 
SCHREBER Maybe. 
Schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing two rats. 
SCHREBER We know of two kinds of memory. Firstly, declarative memory. 
The rats perform various activities involving mazes and geometric symbols.  Schreber turns to look at White, eyebrow raised. 
SCHREBER And then there is procedural memory. 
TIGHT ON HIS SLENDER FINGER  -  pointing to a machine also run by rats.  The object is to make it through a guillotine device. One rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two. 
SCHREBER Follow? 
White nods. 
SCHREBER Research on simple animals can be... useful.  To show us where memory storing systems are located, for example.  I am building an experiment with hamsters next. (looks at nearby cage of hamsters) Cute little things. 
Schreber puts a hand on White's shoulder. 
SCHREBER Listen to me talk!  You must be hungry. 
White nods again, extremely troubled. 
INT.  HALL-WAY (DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE) 
Schreber's office is an annex of his living quarters  -  a maze-like series of rooms and halls.  White is led down a dark hall by Schreber, clutching a candle. 
SCHREBER Whole damn wing lost power.  Wiring's old.  Keep meaning to get it fixed. Here we are. 
They've stopped outside a flaking door. 
INT.  KITCHEN 
A small eat-in kitchen.  Dirty and run-down.  White, sits at a bench, as Schreber removes items from the refrigerator.  The doctor holds up a large FROZEN fish. 
SCHREBER Ah.  Beautiful!  Head and all!  Just how I like 'em! 
ANGLE ON FRYING PAN ON STOVE  -  The fish lands in it and starts to sizzle furiously. 
ANGLE ON WHITE 
WHITE I'm sorry.  About before. 
SCHREBER I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help. 
A set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open slightly and THE NURSE looks in. 
NURSE (to Schreber) I have to talk to you. 
SCHREBER It can't wait? 
She shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out again. 
SCHREBER  (to White) Excuse me.  Ah, make yourself at home. 
He leaves. 
Alone, White looks around the bleak room.  He takes off his coat and sits down again.  He removes the FISH.  The eye opens. The creature looks up at him.  It breaths painfully. 
WHITE Still kicking, huh? 
He puts it back in his pocket. 
The OTHER fish is spattering oil everywhere.  Smoke starts to fill the room.  White, steps over and looks at the frying pan. The fish is turning black.  He turns the heat down. 
He notices a SMALL HOLE in the wall.  At eye height.  He steps across, looks through. 
TIGHT ON WHITE'S eye through the hole. 
HIS P.O.V. 
A dark room.  Shadows on the wall.  Something wet, some kind of ANIMAL, moving in the darkness.  He can hear breathing and whispering voices. 
White's eyes start to blur, he rubs them. 
SCHREBER O.S. How are things in here?

{"test1_input": "Erin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus with him.  He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia, Birkenstocks, bushy beard.  He's as dry as dust, and as much as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her. \nFRANKEL What kind of chromium is it? \nERIN There's more than one kind? \nFRANKEL Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful. \nERIN Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get? \nFRANKEL With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer. \nHe rattles it off coolly.  Just facts.  Erin's stunned. \nERIN So that stuff -- it kills people. \nFRANKEL Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff. \nERIN Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley? \nFRANKEL Have you been to the water board? \nERIN Hunh-uh.  What's that? \nFRANKEL Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there. \nERIN County water board.  All righty, thanks. \nFRANKEL Good luck. (beat) Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ... \nHis line continues over: \nEXT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL WATER BOARD - DAY \nErin's Hyundai pulls up and stops in a cloud of dust. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) ... Incriminating records have a way of disappearing when people smell trouble. \nErin hops out, checks her reflection in the side-view mirror, then heads into the building. \nINT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL COUNTY WATER BOARD - DAY \nDrab, government-issue.  ROSS, the bored desk clerk is thumbing his way through ROAD & TRACK.  Just as he stops to stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters. \nERIN Whew!  Goddamn, that's a heavy door. \nRoss looks up.  It's like the girl from the ad walked right off the page.  He jumps up, to help her with the door. \nROSS Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there. \nERIN Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ... \nROSS Ross. \nERIN Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin. \nShe smiles.  He can't believe his luck. \nROSS Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin? \nERIN Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records. \nROSS (with a laugh) You come to the right place. \nERIN (laughing along) I guess I did. \nROSS You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you. \nERIN I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay? \nROSS Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here -- \nHe hands her a pen.  He reads over her shoulder as she signs her name -- Erin Pattee Brockovich. \nROSS Pattee?  That your middle name? \nERIN Nope.  Maiden. \nROSS (disappointed) You're married. \nERIN Not anymore. \nShe smiles and winks at him, then goes around the counter with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files. \nERIN Well.  Here goes nothing. \nShe heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files. They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande, Helendale -- in no particular order.  Finally, Erin spots one that says Hinkley.  She pulls it down. \nIN THE FILE \nare pages and pages of Xeroxed memoranda, letters, charts, graphs, handwritten notes.  All shoved in willy-nilly. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY \nGeorge is watching a football game on TV.  He's just put TV dinners on the floor in front of the Matt and Katie. \nMATT Our mom gives us sandwiches on Fridays. \nGEORGE That's a sandwich. \nKATIE No, it's not! \n", "test1_true": "He picks up Matt's chicken, tears it in two ... \nGEORGE Most people think a sandwich's gotta have bread on the outside.  Not true.  Chicken is a perfectly good outside for a sandwich. \n... then places the broccoli neatly between the halves. \nGEORGE See? \nKatie and Matthew look at it, then up at George, and smile. This guy just might be all right, after all. \nEXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT \nIt's gotten dark.  Erin's Hyundai's still there. \nINT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT \nErin is on the floor, her legs stretched out in front of her. She has a bunch of files open and spread across the floor. The one in her hand has caught her attention. \nINSERT ON THE PAPER \nIt's a memo titled \"CLEAN-UP AND ABATEMENT ORDER\" from the water board to PG&E.  Erin is concentrating hard on it, reading laboriously to herself. \nERIN (O.S.) \"... On December 7, 1987, the discharger notified the regional board and the San Bernardino County Environmental Health Services of the discovery of 0.58 ppm of hexavalent chromium in an on-site ground water monitoring well ...\" (beat) ... hexavalent ... \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY \nCLOSE ON A XEROX OF THE ABATEMENT ORDER.  WIDEN to see it is on top of a stack of papers that Erin is carrying as she enters the office.  She has an efficient air about her -- a sense of purpose. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY \nErin swoops in, ready to work, only to find her desk cleared off.  She turns to Anna, who's already hard at work. \nERIN Where's my stuff? \nAnna looks up. \nANNA Where've you been? \nERIN What the fuck did you do with my stuff? \nANNA Don't use language with me -- \nBut Erin's out the door before Anna can finish her sentence. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, JANE'S OFFICE - DAY \nJANE is at her desk.  Erin barrels in. \nERIN Someone stole my stuff. \nJANE Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you. \nERIN I had photos of my kids, plus a mug -- \nJane reaches under her desk for a box, looks through it. \nJANE -- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here. \nERIN What's going on? \nJANE There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay. \nShe hands her the box.  Erin doesn't take it. \nERIN I've been working.  Shit, that's all I've been doing.  Ask Mr. Masry.  He knows. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY \nEd's at his desk, dialing the phone when Erin barrels in. \nERIN You said to fire me? \nHe sets down the receiver. \nED Erin, you've been gone for a week. \nERIN I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and -- \nED That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off. \nJane follows her in, still carrying the box of stuff. \nERIN What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds? \nJANE Yes.  It's called accountability. \nERIN I am not talking to you, bitch. \nJANE Excuse me? \nED Okay, enough -- (beat) Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay? \nERIN Don't bother. \nShe turns to Jane, takes her box, and heads out. \nED Come on, I'm trying to help here. \nERIN Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that. \nAnd she leaves. \n", "test1_id": 2358, "test2_input": "Matthew and Katie fan out into the store.  Erin keeps messing with the phone. \nGEORGE You can buy 'em all the toys you want, but come Monday, when you split again, they're still gonna be pissed. \nErin looks over at him, weary. \nERIN George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it? \nGEORGE One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else. \nERIN Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now. \nGEORGE I'm just saying -- \nERIN (with intensity) I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can. \nAnd she walks away from him. \nEXT. HINKLEY, ROADSIDE DITCH - DAY \nErin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch, scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic containers.  Over this: \nERIN (O.S.) Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich.  Tell me something: if I wanna find as much evidence of hexavalent chromium contamination as I possibly can, what should I do? \nAs Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk. \nEXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - NIGHT \nErin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked \"No Trespassing\".  Her arms are full of more containers. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) Well, what you have to remember is, if you have hex chrom in the water, you have it in anything that lived off the water. \nShe adds them to a growing collection of containers in the trunk of her car. \nEXT. HINKLEY, THE POOL BEHIND AN ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY \nAnother day.  This time it's RAINING.  Erin minces her way down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) What I'd do is start a collection.  Anything that existed in water, on water, under water \nShe gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of rancid pool water and seals it. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) anything that had water flow over or under it ... \nErin spots a few dead frogs in the water.  She picks one up by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well. \nEXT. WELL - DAY \nWith a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts shimmying down the well. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) anything that had water pass through it ... \nINSIDE THE WELL \nshe winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as she descends to the water level.  When she's low enough, she takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY \nErin's at her desk, bending over her notebook in a miniskirt, adding reports to the TOXICOLOGY binder. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) ... collect 'em, label 'em, then bring 'em to me.  I'll analyze 'em, see what we got. \nON THE REPORTS: We catch a few words: \"water sample A ...\", \"soil sample D ...\", \"frog sample A ...\", \"... traces of hexavalent ...\" \nBrenda looks at Erin and sees her hem rising in the back. \nBRENDA For God's sake, Erin, I can see your panties. \nErin turns to Brenda, relishing the chance to irritate her. \nERIN Liar.  I'm not wearing any. \nEd, in his office, laughs.  He's starting to like this gal. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's a hot night.  George is playing on the floor with the kids.  Erin is behind them on the couch, laboriously reading a book labeled, simply, CHROMIUM.  The phone RINGS.  Erin picks it up. \nERIN Hello? \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich that's been snooping around the water board? \nHis voice is flat, creepy.  Not friendly. \nERIN Yes.  Who's this? \nCLICK.  Erin stares at the phone, freaked. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nGeorge watches Erin double-checking the locks on the door. \nERIN I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George. \nGEORGE Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger. \nERIN I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember? \nShe goes to the living room, double-checks the window locks in there.  George follows. \nGEORGE Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here? \n", "test2_true": "She heads into the bedrooms. \nGEORGE It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there. \nERIN (off-hand) How would you know? \nGeorge reacts, a little stung.  He follows her into: \nINT. MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMatt and Katie are asleep.  Erin is checking their windows. George comes in.  They whisper. \nGEORGE You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean? \nERIN Nothing. \nGEORGE If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so. \nERIN I didn't say that. \nGEORGE Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy? \nERIN Keep your voice down. \nGEORGE I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you. \nShe gives him a glare, then leaves the room. \nINT. WATER BOARD - DAY \nErin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of files.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ross passing. \nERIN Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart? \nROSS (a bad liar) I don't know what you're talking about. \nERIN The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you. (beat) People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night. \nRoss is speechless.  He just stands there.  Erin drags the box to the floor and goes to work. \nEXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT \nErin's car is parked in front.  A DIRTY OLD PICK-UP comes rumbling up the road.  When its lights hit Erin's car, it slows, then pulls over.  The driver flicks on his BRIGHTS to get a better look at the car.  The truck sits there for a bit, a dark presence.  Then, as the headlights of another car appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out and drives off. \nINT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - NIGHT \nA pile of documents is strapped into the passenger seat.  An empty coffee cup rolls around the floor.  Erin's driving, exhausted.  She yawns as she dials her phone. \nGEORGE (O.S.) Hello? \nINTERCUT between Erin in her car, and George in bed. \nERIN I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya? \nGEORGE What do you want, a joke? \nERIN No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there? \nGEORGE Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking. \nERIN What? (beat) Beth?  My Beth? \nGEORGE Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, \"ball.\" \nErin says nothing, just stares out at the empty highway, feeling all hollowed-out. \nGEORGE I'd never seen that before -- someone's first word.  Pretty intense. \nErin just nods.  Keeps staring straight ahead as a tear rolls down her cheek. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S AREA - DAY \nCLOSE ON SOME FILES as Erin hands them to Ed.  As he takes them from her, he notices a crematory urn on Erin's desk. \nED Is that what I think it is? \nERIN She lived on the plume.  You never know. \nEd laughs and hands the documents to Brenda without looking at her.  She grumpily takes them over to the fax machine. \nCLOSE ON THE FAX LED as Brenda types in the number. The recipient's name comes up again: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT. \nEXT. HINKLEY BARBECUE - DAY \nOpen pits, pony rides, watermelon.  George is watching Katie and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped being fun hours ago.  Now they're just hot and tired. \nBY THE BARBECUE, Ed is talking to an OLDER COUPLE as they sign retainer agreements. \nELSEWHERE, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a swimming pool with FIVE OTHER WOMEN.  The water is green. \nERIN This was the community pool? \nWOMAN 1 Yeah, that PG&E built.  The whole time we thought it was algae that made it so green. \nLATER ... \nErin's trunk is open.  She and Ed are clipping new clusters of retainer agreements into the \"PLAINTIFFS\" binder. \nLATER STILL ... \nErin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets.  She sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's. \n", "test2_id": 2359, "test3_input": "GEORGE I'm bored, and so are the kids. \nERIN Just a few more minutes, then we can go. (as he heads off) Take her, will you? \nGeorge drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin.  He heads over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log. \nAs he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he dropped.  It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET.  He's in his 50's, strong and sinewy.  Military-style dark glasses obscure his eyes.  He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working the crowd.  Watches her carefully.  He slides the pamphlet into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board. \nLATER STILL ... \nErin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave, when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow. \nDONNA Erin, this here's Frank Melendez.  He works over at the compressor station -- \nErin stops in her tracks, very interested. \nLATER STILL ... \nErin and Frank are on a bench, talking.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees her car drive off.  George's hand sticks out the driver's side and flips her the bird.  She watches him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank. \nERIN I'm sorry.  What were you saying? \nLATER ... \nThe barbecue is winding down.  Ed is heading for his Mercedes.  Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out. \nERIN I need a ride. \nINT. ED'S CAR - DAY \nEd is driving.  He glances over at Erin, fuming in the passenger seat.  After a beat: \nED You wanna talk about -- \nERIN No. \nAnother beat.  Then Erin's cel phone rings.  She digs into her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can.  Answers. \nERIN What, asshole? \nThere's a pause.  Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the line, very strained: \nMIKE AMBROSINO (O.S.) Um, Erin?  This is Mike.  Ambrosino. \nEXT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY \nThe curtains are drawn; everything is dark.  Ed and Erin are at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired. \nMIKE She was about to take a handful of these -- \nHe shows them a bottle of prescription pills. \nMIKE It's a morphine thing -- for pain -- \nErin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward: \nINT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY \nErin opens the door.  Very dark, very quiet.  Laura is lying in bed.  Erin goes over to her.  They speak in whispers. \nLAURA I'm embarrassed. \nERIN That's okay.  I understand. \nLAURA It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother. \nERIN I'm real sorry, Laura. \nErin sits down on the chair next to the bed.  Takes a beat. \nLAURA Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar. \nERIN Jaguar's a darn pretty car. \nLAURA I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine. (beat) I don't even know how much they cost. \nERIN A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one. \nLaura shakes her head. \nLAURA Wouldn't mean the same thing. \nErin watches her sadly. \nINT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY \nA LOUD, industrial plant.  Erin and Frank Melendez walk through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress.  Both in hard-hats.  He's giving her a tour. \nEXT. NORTHRIDGE STREET - DAY \nGeorge, in his leather and denim, is walking down the sidewalk.  As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER. He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change. \nIn the stroller, Beth starts to whine.  George reaches in his pocket, finds her pacifier.  As he's leaning down to give it to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him. The roar grows.  He stands, looks.  A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN BIKERS has pulled up next to him.  He looks at them.  They look at him, then at the stroller.  George feels ridiculous. \nWhen the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out. George just stands there and watches them go. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT \nHis office is all about Hinkley.  A map of the plume area and a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface; \nErin is up at the map, eating Chinese food. \n", "test3_true": "ED I don't remember seeing any ponds up there. \nShe bites into a forkful of food, keeps talking. \nERIN They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock. \nED And that's what caused the contamination? \nERIN It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom. \nShe reaches for a document, reads from it. \nERIN See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what -- \nED They skipped that step. \nERIN I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please. \nED Jesus. (beat) I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk. \nIn response to the insinuation, Erin gives him a glare. \nERIN For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job. \nED No shit. \nERIN No -- \nSuddenly, her eyes pop out of her head -- \nERIN SHIT!  SHIT!  Hot!  Hot!  Hot! \nTears spring to her eyes.  She fans furiously at her mouth. Ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her. She takes a swig.  There's a nanosecond of relief ... until the tequila hits.  Her eyes redden.  She spews and gasps. \nERIN You ... asshole ... \nEd chuckles. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - LATER \nThe tequila's been dipped into.  Ed and Erin are each lying on a couch, staring at documents.  Late-night working. \nED Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work. \nERIN Yeah?  Then gimme another raise. \nED Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something. \nHe gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room with it, cleaning up all the Chinese food cartons. \nERIN Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here. \nED We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco. \nERIN What do you mean? \nED PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley. \nERIN Oh, they knew.  They had to know. \nED Show me the document that proves that. \nShe doesn't have one. \nED Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is. \nERIN Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and we're the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right. \nBeat.  Ed smiles. \nED I like this case. \nERIN Really?  It makes me sick. \nED Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about. \nERIN You didn't care about my case? \nED I would now. \nHe gives her a long look. \nED Hey.  I like working with you. \nERIN Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too. \nThey both smile a little awkwardly.  Take a beat.  Then: \nED When'd you start calling me Ed? \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT \nThe Christmas party.  The office is decorated; someone is Santa.  Erin and George enter, all dressed up. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nErin's giving George a guided tour.  As they head down the hall, every desk is decorated and has a present on it \nGEORGE I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here? \nERIN Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party. \n", "test3_id": 2360}

{"train": "ERIN Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set. \nEd notices her ranting is starting to draw attention. \nED Okay -- let's try and settle down here. \nERIN Settle down?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't afford to settle down! \nBeat. \nED I'm sorry, Erin. \nERIN Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids. \nErin turns away from him and heads for the stairway. \nEXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY \nA shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge.  The Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb. \nErin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell. \nA Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white baby.  This is MRS. MORALES. \nMRS. MORALES Hi, Erin!  You're back so soon.  How was it? \nShe hands Erin the baby.  It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old. Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby. \nERIN Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie? \nMRS. MORALES Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good? \nThe truth is too depressing to share. \nERIN It'll be fine, yeah. \nMRS. MORALES Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries -- \nERIN What? \nMRS. MORALES My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her. \nERIN You're moving away?  When? \nMRS. MORALES Next week. \nERIN (stunned) Wow, that's soon -- \nMRS. MORALES I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door. \nOh, God.  In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH. \nEXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY \nErin carries Beth up to her house.  As she nears her door, she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG.  It crunches under her sole. \nERIN Ugh. \nInsult added to injury.  She heads up to the house, dragging her shoe, wiping off the bug guts. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAY \nJust as dull inside.  Salvation Army furniture.  A lot of beige.  Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are at the table.  Beth is in a baby seat.  Erin spoons some Mac & Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry. \nMATTHEW I don't like this part, it's all crusty. \nKATIE I like the crust. \nErin switches the plates. \nERIN Put your napkins in your laps and eat up. \nKATIE How come you're not eating? \nCause there isn't enough food. \nERIN Mamma's gonna eat later. \nFrom her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more. Thick, sick-sounding coughs.  Erin looks at her. \nERIN Don't go getting sick on me, baby.  Okay? \nINT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with STEAM.  Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap, trying to steam the illness out of her. \nERIN It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.  I promise. \nBut her face doesn't look like she believes it. \nEXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY \nMatt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine. \nINT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAY \nErin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles.  She stops at the medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself, glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle. \nINT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAY \nAs a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY. \nErin shakes her head, no.  Great, thinks Anna. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY \nAs Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass JANE, the bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area. \nJANE Just last week, he told my sister we weren't hiring. \nBRENDA What's your sister look like? \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nEd is packing up his office.  Erin sticks her head in. \nERIN Mr. Masry? \nHe turns, sees her. \nED Yeah? \nERIN I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend. \nED Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays. \nERIN Oh.  Okay.  That's okay. \nEd looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay. \nED Oh, for Christ's sake ... \nHe takes out his wallet, looks in. \nED All I have is hundreds. \nERIN I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry. \nED Bullshit, you don't. \nHe slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves.  When he's gone, she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a great big kiss. \nEXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nErin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's.  Katie and Matt pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house. \nEXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT \nErin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag of groceries in the other.  Katie and Matt are each carrying a bag of groceries as well.  They are all singing and moving with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.  Katie spots a flower display outside the store. \nKATIE Mommy, can I get a flower? \nERIN Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nA small room with Salvation Army furniture.  A BUNCH OF DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table. Matt and Katie are asleep in bed.  Erin looks down at them, smiles, then kisses them good-night. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nErin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door. But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING. It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall. \nEXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nErin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what used to be Mrs. Morales's house.  A few MOTORCYCLES are parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE. \nERIN Hey! \nBut of course he can't hear her.  She walks over to him, stands right in his line of vision. \nERIN HEY! \nHe sees her and kills the engine.  Everything about GEORGE HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long hair.  Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's. \nGEORGE Well, hello to you, darlin'. \nERIN What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise? \nGEORGE Just introducing myself to the neighbors. \nERIN Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up. \nThe guys on the porch chuckle.  Erin turns and starts back to her house.  George hops off his bike and follows her. \nGEORGE Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours? \nERIN Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine. \nGEORGE Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness? \nErin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking. \nGEORGE Come on.  Gimme your number, I'll call you up proper and ask you out and everything. \nShe stops at her porch, turns to him. \nERIN You want my number? \nGEORGE I do. \nERIN Which number do you want, George? \nGEORGE You got more than one? \nERIN I'm not gonna leave my kids with you. \nGEORGE Why not? \nERIN Cause I don't even know you. \nGEORGE Yeah, and whose fault is that? \nHe's got a point there.  After a beat: \nGEORGE What, you got so many friends in this world, you don't have use for one more? \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nGeorge is on the floor with Matt and Katie, playing War. Katie points to the Harley emblem on his leather jacket. \nKATIE What's that stand for? \nGEORGE That's for Harley Davidson.  The best damn motorcycle ever made. \nErin comes in from the kitchen. \nERIN And if I catch either of you anywhere near one, I'll knock you silly.  Go on to bed, now -- I'll come tuck you in in a minute. \nThey get up ... \nGEORGE Night. \nKATIE/MATT Night. \n... and head into bed.  George starts cleaning up the cards. \nGEORGE Great kids. \nErin bends down to help him. \nERIN Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them. \nGEORGE How? \nERIN I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat. \nGEORGE I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons. \nERIN Great.  Another deadbeat. \nGEORGE I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to. \nERIN Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund? \nGEORGE I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap. \nERIN (with a little laugh) I hope that's not supposed to impress me. \nGEORGE Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you? \nERIN It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice. \nGEORGE Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it. \nERIN Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids? \nGEORGE Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them. \nERIN Right. \nShe starts cleaning up the cards. \nGEORGE I do.  I like how they keep it all simple, you know?  They don't get all complicated about life, like grown-ups do.  A bicycle and an ice cream cone -- boom, done, they're happy. \nErin thinks about the offer. \nERIN You're around every afternoon? \nGEORGE Yup.  Usually working on my bike. (she's tempted) No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady. \nTempting.  Erin looks him over. \nERIN This isn't gonna get you laid, you know. \nGEORGE (with a laugh) Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we? \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe wee hours.  Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress on the floor.  The paperwork from the box is now spread all over the floor around her.  She's reading a letter. \nCLOSE ON THE LETTER \nIt's from PG&E, to Donna and Peter Irving.  We see the phrases, \"purchase your house ...\", \"fair market value ...\" \nCLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT \nIt's a list of comparable house sales in the area.  Owner, cost; owner, cost.  Every house is in the $65,000 range. \nFrom another room, she hears the sound of BETH CRYING.  Still reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into: \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nStill reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib.  Beth quiets. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY \nThis is a dry, desolate part of California.  No downtown, no community.  Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the landscape like occasional tombstones. \nA beat-up old sign on the road reads: \"HINKLEY, CA.  POP: \" but the  corner where the number would be has broken off. \nAs a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley. \nINT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY \nErin looks around.  The house she's passing has been razed. A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property. \nAs she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she drives by the PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from the road.  Erin passes it without noticing it. \nShe stops at an intersection.  The house on the corner has been boarded up with plywood.  Erin notices it -- depressing -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street. \nEXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY \nA generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of nothing.  There's a pool out back and a chain link fence hugging the property.  No landscaping.  Dull, but clean.  A few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door. \nThe Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.  Erin gets out.  As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into the dirt.  She rings the bell.  It has a melody chime. \nDONNA IRVING opens the door.  She's 35, petite, with a scrappy, high-strung manner.  She's wearing tight jeans, and her dark curls are piled on top of her head. \nERIN Hi.  Donna Irving? \nDONNA Yes? \nERIN I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe? \nDONNA (a little surprised) You're a lawyer? \nERIN Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute? \nINT. THE IRVINGS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe house is furnished with little money, but lots of care. Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows. Out back, two GIRLS, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool. \nERIN This is a real nice place you got here. \nDONNA (O.S.) Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it. \nShe comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea. \nDONNA I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ... \nERIN Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey. \nDonna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows. \nDONNA Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over. \nERIN Right. \nDONNA Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have. \nERIN Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me -- \nThis would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self- pitying.  But not Donna.  Life's handed her a shitload of lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade. \nDONNA I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer -- \nERIN Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that. \nDONNA Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you. \nERIN I'll say.  Holy moley. \nDONNA So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point. \nERIN Yeah, I can see that. (beat) I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff? \nDonna tops off their iced teas. \nDONNA Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place. \nERIN Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place. \nDONNA Well, they paid for the doctor's visit. \nERIN They did? \nDONNA You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill. \nERIN Wow.  Why would they do that? \nDONNA Cause of the chromium. \nERIN The what? \nDONNA The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off. \nINT. IRVING HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY \nCLOSE ON A BOX, with \"CHROM INFO\" scrawled on it. \nDONNA (O.S.) PG&E came around a few years ago, told us they put chromium in our well by mistake. And since we shouldn't have to drink it if we don't want to, they gave us free spring water and offered to buy our house. \nWIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room. \nERIN What's chromium? \nErin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus with him.  He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia, Birkenstocks, bushy beard.  He's as dry as dust, and as much as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her. \nFRANKEL What kind of chromium is it? \nERIN There's more than one kind? \nFRANKEL Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful. \nERIN Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get? \nFRANKEL With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer. \nHe rattles it off coolly.  Just facts.  Erin's stunned. \nERIN So that stuff -- it kills people. \nFRANKEL Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff. \nERIN Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley? \nFRANKEL Have you been to the water board? \nERIN Hunh-uh.  What's that? \nFRANKEL Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there. \nERIN County water board.  All righty, thanks. \nFRANKEL Good luck. (beat) Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ... \nHis line continues over: \nEXT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL WATER BOARD - DAY \nErin's Hyundai pulls up and stops in a cloud of dust. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) ... Incriminating records have a way of disappearing when people smell trouble. \nErin hops out, checks her reflection in the side-view mirror, then heads into the building. \nINT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL COUNTY WATER BOARD - DAY \nDrab, government-issue.  ROSS, the bored desk clerk is thumbing his way through ROAD & TRACK.  Just as he stops to stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters. \nERIN Whew!  Goddamn, that's a heavy door. \nRoss looks up.  It's like the girl from the ad walked right off the page.  He jumps up, to help her with the door. \nROSS Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there. \nERIN Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ... \nROSS Ross. \nERIN Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin. \nShe smiles.  He can't believe his luck. \nROSS Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin? \nERIN Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records. \nROSS (with a laugh) You come to the right place. \nERIN (laughing along) I guess I did. \nROSS You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you. \nERIN I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay? \nROSS Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here -- \nHe hands her a pen.  He reads over her shoulder as she signs her name -- Erin Pattee Brockovich. \nROSS Pattee?  That your middle name? \nERIN Nope.  Maiden. \nROSS (disappointed) You're married. \nERIN Not anymore. \nShe smiles and winks at him, then goes around the counter with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files. \nERIN Well.  Here goes nothing. \nShe heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files. They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande, Helendale -- in no particular order.  Finally, Erin spots one that says Hinkley.  She pulls it down. \nIN THE FILE \nare pages and pages of Xeroxed memoranda, letters, charts, graphs, handwritten notes.  All shoved in willy-nilly. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY \nGeorge is watching a football game on TV.  He's just put TV dinners on the floor in front of the Matt and Katie. \nMATT Our mom gives us sandwiches on Fridays. \nGEORGE That's a sandwich. \nKATIE No, it's not! \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY \nAs Erin heads for the door, pleased glances fly from secretary to secretary.  Erin reaches the door, but can't open it with the box in her arms.  She turns to the room. \nERIN I don't suppose any one of you cunts could open the fucking door for me. \nEXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY \nErin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house.  Erin shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of stuff off the seat, and gets out. \nAs she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs into the MAILMAN.  He hands her a packet of mail. \nMAILMAN Here ya go, Miz Brockovich. \nErin looks at the top of the stack.  It's the electric bill. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY \nErin enters, puts down the box and stares at the mail. Bills, bills, and more bills.  As she throws them on the table, she sees George coming out of the kitchen. \nERIN What are you doing here? \nGEORGE Fixing a leak under your sink. \nShe heads into the kitchen, weary and irritated. \nERIN I didn't ask you to do that.  Damn it, George, I don't ask you to do things like that. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY \nErin enters, sees all the cleaning stuff from under the sink is spread around the kitchen floor.  A tool box lies open. \nERIN Great. \nGEORGE I'm gonna clean it up. \nErin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away. \nGEORGE Relax, Erin, I'll do it -- I'm not -- \nBefore he can finish, a huge WATER BUG runs onto Erin's hand. \nERIN Ugh -- Jesus -- \nShe jumps and brushes it off. \nGEORGE Yeah -- you had a whole family of those things hanging out back there. \nShe takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it. \nERIN Damn it -- \nThe bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard.  Erin chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time. \nGEORGE Don't worry about it, I'll get it later. \nBut Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into killing that one bug. \nERIN Come here, you little motherfucker -- \nThe bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt, the pepper, the napkin holder.  Erin keeps after it, BANGING the table harder and harder with each SMACK of her shoe. \nGEORGE Hey, whoa -- relax -- \nThe salt and pepper skid off the table.  The napkins fly from their holder.  Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips into a crack in the wall and disappears.  Erin hurls her shoe at the crack.  It SMASHES into the wall. \nERIN GOD DAMN IT! \nAs Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears. She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her. \nERIN (almost a whisper) ... God damn it. \nShe looks around at her for-shit kitchen and starts to cry. \nERIN What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats? \nGEORGE It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator. \nERIN I can't call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my phone. (beat) I got fired. \nGEORGE What?  But you been working so hard -- \nERIN Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference. (then, fragile) Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so nothing? \nGeorge picks a napkin up off the floor, hands it to her. \nGEORGE You're not nothing, Erin. \nERIN Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen. (wipes her nose) I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone. \nGEORGE You are someone. \nERIN No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not. \nGEORGE You're someone to me. (beat) You're someone real special to me. \nHe takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very close.  He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on her foot.  Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them. \nERIN I'm no good, George.  I make people miserable. \nBut he kisses her anyway.  And for the first time in so long, she feels like something other than a failure.  He pulls her into him, and she lets herself be pulled. \nED This is the only thing you found? \nERIN So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more. \nED Find out. \nEXT. 10 FREEWAY - DAY \nErin's Hyundai zips along the freeway.  \"Funky Town\" is blaring from the tinny stereo.  Over it: \nMATTHEW (O.S.) I hate this music. \nINT. HYUNDAI - DAY \nErin's driving.  Matthew's in the front seat.  Katie and Beth (in a car seat) are in the back. \nERIN There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible. \nMATTHEW Well I hate it. \nKATIE I hate it too.  I hate this trip. \nERIN Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before. \nKATIE I'm gonna hate it. \nMATTHEW Me too. \nShe glances at them, frowns a little. \nERIN You know what I'm realizing for the first time?  You kids are a couple of downers.  I mean, you are the real thing -- a couple of honest-to-God depresso-types. (small smile) Who in the heck raised you, anyway?  Some kind of moron? \nKatie smiles a little.  She likes this side of her mom. \nKATIE Yeah.  A real moron. \nERIN Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet. \nMATTHEW (also smiling) Yeah. \nERIN Thank God we got you away from her, huh? \nBy now they're all smiling.  Funky Town plays on. \nEXT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY \nThe Hyundai is parked at the entrance to the station, by a row of dead trees.  Erin is standing beside a sign that says \"Private Property.  No Trespassing\", taking pictures of the massive structure in the distance.  Matthew, Katie, and Beth are drawing in the dirt with sticks. \nERIN Stay out of the road.  I'll be right back. \nShe wanders up the drive, onto PG&E property, moving around the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle. \nAs she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue. She looks at the dirt right her feet.  Kicks the ground. \nBelow the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green.  Erin notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt. Worry comes over her face.  She heads back to them. \nEXT. HINKLEY MART - DAY \nThe kids are waiting at the car.  Erin comes out of the store with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands. \nEXT. WATER BOARD - DAY \nThe sound of a BABY CRYING.  The Hyundai's parked in front. \nMATTHEW (O.S.) I'm hungry. \nINT. WATER BOARD - DAY \nErin is at the Xerox machine, copying a file while she tries to calm Beth.  There's a stack of files on the nearby table. Matthew and Katie are flopping around on the floor. \nERIN We'll go eat in a minute.  Settle down. \nWhining, fussing.  Ross goes over to her. \nROSS You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner. \nERIN Ross -- you are an absolute angel. \nShe hands Ross the STACK OF DOCUMENTS. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY \nEd comes in in the morning, and without pausing, hands Brenda a copy of the STACK OF DOCUMENTS, with a Post-it on the top. \nED Fax these to this number, okay? \nBRENDA All of 'em? \nED All of them. \nHe continues into his office and closes the door. \nCLOSE ON THE FAX MACHINE LED \nBrenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up on the LED: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT. \nINT. IRVING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAnother copy of those DOCUMENTS, now in Donna's hands.  She's on her couch with Erin, reading them.  Outside, Donna's two daughters are playing in the pool.  She reads the last page and looks up at Erin, bewildered. \nDONNA An on-site monitoring well?  That means -- \nERIN -- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's disease, immune deficiencies, asthma, chronic nosebleeds. \nDespite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously the party line: \nBAUM A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair. \nED Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here. \nBAUM 250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer. \nEd looks across at this pissant little kid. \nED (to himself) Jesus Christ. (he stands, to leave) I will present your offer to my clients.  I doubt they'll accept it. \nAs Ed starts out: \nBAUM Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation. \nED (containing his anger) Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind. \nAnd Ed leaves the conference room.  Erin follows him out. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY \nErin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office. \nERIN At least they made an offer. \nED That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you. \nERIN I don't get why they'd do that. \nED Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world. \nERIN And you can't? \nED What, you think I'm made of money? \nBehind them, Baum steps out of the conference room. \nBAUM Hey, you know where I can get a cab?  My plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes. \nEd turns and looks at him.  He gets a tiny smile. \nED Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport. \nBAUM Hey, excellent.  Thanks. \nBaum heads out to the reception area. \nERIN Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours. \nED (gleeful) Yeah.  Isn't that a shame? \nShe watches him go into his office, impressed.  Big smile. \nERIN Well I'll be God damned. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nEnd of the day.  Most everyone has left.  Erin is at her new work space near Ed's office.  She's poring over a fat file of documents.  ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on. \nROSALIND You've been reading for hours. \nERIN I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word \"dog\" and see \"god\". \nROSALIND Hey, just so long as you see Him. \nRosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out. \nOutside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's.  These are MANDY and TOM BROWN.  He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope under his arm.  Rosalind points to Erin.  The Browns enter the office and approach her. \nMANDY Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich? \nERIN Yeah.  Who are you? \nTOM I'm Tom Brown.  This is my wife Mandy.  We used to live across the street from the Irvings.  PG&E bought our house last year. \nINT. ERIN'S DESK - LATER \nCLOSE ON photos of chickens, each with a twisted, limp neck. \nTOM It's called wry neck.  It's when they're born without any muscles in the neck. \nWIDEN to see Erin looking at them with Tom and Mandy. \nERIN Wow.  How many were born like this? \nTOM Twelve, maybe thirteen. \nMANDY When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too. \nERIN It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot. \nShe tucks them into a file, as if that's it. \nMANDY There's something else, too. \nERIN What? \nTOM Well.  Mandy here's had nine miscarriages. \nERIN I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward? \nED Erin -- \nErin's enjoying Ed's discomfort almost too much to stop.  But just almost.  She shifts gears. \nERIN Then I asked him how much he makes if I didn't get anything. \nThey look at Ed.  Well? \nED Then I don't get anything either. \nERIN And I realized, he's taking a chance too. \nWhen they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they all reach for their pens and sign.   They hand the agreements over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed.  He stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up.  That's that. \nED All right, then.  Let's hit the road. \nBoy.  Cold as ice.  Erin stares at him, stunned by his brusque manner, then leans in to him, close. \nERIN (whispering) Mr. Masry, if you don't mind my saying, you got a lot to learn about being friendly. These people just hired you as their lawyer. The least you could do is make a little pleasant conversation. \nShe gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women. \nERIN Donna, let me help you clean all this up. \nShe picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the kitchen.  Donna and Mandy follow, leaving Ed alone with Pete and Roy.  He stands there, awkwardly.  Then, finally: \nED So, what's, uh ... what's new? \nINT. DONNA'S KITCHEN - DAY \nErin and Donna are putting away the cleaned glasses.  Mandy is scanning the chromium pamphlet Erin gave her. \nMANDY You know that thing it says in here about rashes? \nERIN Uh-huh? \nMANDY Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ... \nErin listens, interested. \nEXT. LINWOOD DAIRY, BARN - DAY \nAnother day.  BOB LINWOOD, 40's and gruff, is in the barn, tossing hay around. \nERIN (O.S.) Excuse me.  Are you Mr. Linwood? \nHe sees Erin picking her way toward him in her high-heels. \nLINWOOD Yeah? \nERIN I'm Erin Brockovich.  I work at the law firm that represents your former neighbors the Browns.  They suggested I give you a call. \nShe steps in a cow patty.  Laughs at herself good-naturedly. \nERIN Boy howdy, did I ever wear the wrong shoes. \nEXT. THE DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY \nCLOSE ON A SIGN that reads: THE DESOTOS, hanging on the side of a small, paint-chipped house.  Erin is at the door talking to MARY DESOTO, 65, who's wearing a big cross at her breast. \nERIN ... and Mr. Linwood seemed to think that your husband had been sick as well. \nMARY Yes, Mr. DeSoto has lung cancer.  Never smoked a day in his life, neither. \nINT. LAURA AND MIKE AMBROSINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nErin is talking to MIKE and LAURA AMBROSINO -- 30's.  Solid, family folks.  But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that she's in a lot of pain. \nERIN Mrs. DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly what it was that you had -- \nPETE She's not alone on that one. \nLAURA Well, they know what it is -- it's called fibrous dysplasia -- \nPETE The bones start growing again.  Gives her headaches like you wouldn't believe. \nLAURA -- they just don't know what caused it. \nINT. RITA AND TED DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY \nErin is talking to TED AND RITA DANIELS.  Their daughter ANNABELLE, 10, is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket. \nERIN ... then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing you folks at the hospital from time to time too, so I thought I'd just stop by. (to Annabelle) You must be Annabelle. \nANNABELLE Uh-huh. \nERIN Whew, are you ever a beauty.  I mean, you must drive those boys crazy. \nAnnabelle smiles a little. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLate night.  George rolls over -- Erin's side of the bed is empty.  He checks the clock, then gets up and heads into: \nINT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nHe peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's chair in Matthew and Katie's room. \nErin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep.  Erin hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway. \nMatthew and Katie fan out into the store.  Erin keeps messing with the phone. \nGEORGE You can buy 'em all the toys you want, but come Monday, when you split again, they're still gonna be pissed. \nErin looks over at him, weary. \nERIN George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it? \nGEORGE One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else. \nERIN Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now. \nGEORGE I'm just saying -- \nERIN (with intensity) I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can. \nAnd she walks away from him. \nEXT. HINKLEY, ROADSIDE DITCH - DAY \nErin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch, scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic containers.  Over this: \nERIN (O.S.) Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich.  Tell me something: if I wanna find as much evidence of hexavalent chromium contamination as I possibly can, what should I do? \nAs Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk. \nEXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - NIGHT \nErin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked \"No Trespassing\".  Her arms are full of more containers. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) Well, what you have to remember is, if you have hex chrom in the water, you have it in anything that lived off the water. \nShe adds them to a growing collection of containers in the trunk of her car. \nEXT. HINKLEY, THE POOL BEHIND AN ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY \nAnother day.  This time it's RAINING.  Erin minces her way down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) What I'd do is start a collection.  Anything that existed in water, on water, under water \nShe gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of rancid pool water and seals it. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) anything that had water flow over or under it ... \nErin spots a few dead frogs in the water.  She picks one up by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well. \nEXT. WELL - DAY \nWith a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts shimmying down the well. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) anything that had water pass through it ... \nINSIDE THE WELL \nshe winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as she descends to the water level.  When she's low enough, she takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY \nErin's at her desk, bending over her notebook in a miniskirt, adding reports to the TOXICOLOGY binder. \nFRANKEL (O.S.) ... collect 'em, label 'em, then bring 'em to me.  I'll analyze 'em, see what we got. \nON THE REPORTS: We catch a few words: \"water sample A ...\", \"soil sample D ...\", \"frog sample A ...\", \"... traces of hexavalent ...\" \nBrenda looks at Erin and sees her hem rising in the back. \nBRENDA For God's sake, Erin, I can see your panties. \nErin turns to Brenda, relishing the chance to irritate her. \nERIN Liar.  I'm not wearing any. \nEd, in his office, laughs.  He's starting to like this gal. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's a hot night.  George is playing on the floor with the kids.  Erin is behind them on the couch, laboriously reading a book labeled, simply, CHROMIUM.  The phone RINGS.  Erin picks it up. \nERIN Hello? \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich that's been snooping around the water board? \nHis voice is flat, creepy.  Not friendly. \nERIN Yes.  Who's this? \nCLICK.  Erin stares at the phone, freaked. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nGeorge watches Erin double-checking the locks on the door. \nERIN I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George. \nGEORGE Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger. \nERIN I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember? \nShe goes to the living room, double-checks the window locks in there.  George follows. \nGEORGE Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here? \nGEORGE I'm bored, and so are the kids. \nERIN Just a few more minutes, then we can go. (as he heads off) Take her, will you? \nGeorge drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin.  He heads over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log. \nAs he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he dropped.  It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET.  He's in his 50's, strong and sinewy.  Military-style dark glasses obscure his eyes.  He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working the crowd.  Watches her carefully.  He slides the pamphlet into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board. \nLATER STILL ... \nErin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave, when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow. \nDONNA Erin, this here's Frank Melendez.  He works over at the compressor station -- \nErin stops in her tracks, very interested. \nLATER STILL ... \nErin and Frank are on a bench, talking.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees her car drive off.  George's hand sticks out the driver's side and flips her the bird.  She watches him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank. \nERIN I'm sorry.  What were you saying? \nLATER ... \nThe barbecue is winding down.  Ed is heading for his Mercedes.  Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out. \nERIN I need a ride. \nINT. ED'S CAR - DAY \nEd is driving.  He glances over at Erin, fuming in the passenger seat.  After a beat: \nED You wanna talk about -- \nERIN No. \nAnother beat.  Then Erin's cel phone rings.  She digs into her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can.  Answers. \nERIN What, asshole? \nThere's a pause.  Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the line, very strained: \nMIKE AMBROSINO (O.S.) Um, Erin?  This is Mike.  Ambrosino. \nEXT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY \nThe curtains are drawn; everything is dark.  Ed and Erin are at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired. \nMIKE She was about to take a handful of these -- \nHe shows them a bottle of prescription pills. \nMIKE It's a morphine thing -- for pain -- \nErin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward: \nINT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY \nErin opens the door.  Very dark, very quiet.  Laura is lying in bed.  Erin goes over to her.  They speak in whispers. \nLAURA I'm embarrassed. \nERIN That's okay.  I understand. \nLAURA It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother. \nERIN I'm real sorry, Laura. \nErin sits down on the chair next to the bed.  Takes a beat. \nLAURA Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar. \nERIN Jaguar's a darn pretty car. \nLAURA I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine. (beat) I don't even know how much they cost. \nERIN A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one. \nLaura shakes her head. \nLAURA Wouldn't mean the same thing. \nErin watches her sadly. \nINT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY \nA LOUD, industrial plant.  Erin and Frank Melendez walk through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress.  Both in hard-hats.  He's giving her a tour. \nEXT. NORTHRIDGE STREET - DAY \nGeorge, in his leather and denim, is walking down the sidewalk.  As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER. He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change. \nIn the stroller, Beth starts to whine.  George reaches in his pocket, finds her pacifier.  As he's leaning down to give it to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him. The roar grows.  He stands, looks.  A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN BIKERS has pulled up next to him.  He looks at them.  They look at him, then at the stroller.  George feels ridiculous. \nWhen the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out. George just stands there and watches them go. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT \nHis office is all about Hinkley.  A map of the plume area and a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface; \nErin is up at the map, eating Chinese food. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - NIGHT \nIt's dark.  The door to Erin's area opens. \nERIN And here, ta-daa, is my desk. \nShe flicks on the lights.  Brenda's desk is decorated and as a present on it.  Erin's is empty. \nGEORGE Which one? (it's obvious) Maybe they didn't think you were coming. \nErin shakes her head.  She's surprised by how hurt she is. \nERIN (quietly) God damn.  I work so hard.  The least they could do ... \nGeorge looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little.  He goes over to her, wraps his arms around her. \nGEORGE Hey.  Fuck 'em, babe.  Who needs 'em, huh? \nHe kisses her.  She leans into him.  He kisses her some more. \nGEORGE (quietly) See?  All we need is each other. \nShe kisses back.  She's gonna let him take care of her.  Some more kisses, heating up.  He slides her onto her empty desk. \nGEORGE Good thing there isn't a present there, huh? That mighta hurt. \nShe laughs a little.  He slides his hands up her skirt.  She pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants. \nINT. MASRY OFFICES, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nEd is coming down the hall with his wife, JOEY.  Joey is much younger than Ed, and very pretty. \nED I'll show you what we did back here -- \nINT. ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT \nErin and George, in a rapidly-heating-up clinch on her desk, hear the voices.  Erin pulls away. \nERIN That's Ed. \nGEORGE Lock the door. \nERIN No, I wanna say hi. \nHe pulls her back into him, not wanting to move. \nGEORGE We'll say hi later.  Lock it. \nBut Erin pulls away ... \nERIN Come on, George, it's a party. \nHe watches her straighten her dress and take a step away from him.  It's just one step, but it feels a hell a lot farther. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER \nErin and Ed are at the reception desk, talking and laughing. \nNEARBY, Joey and George are standing together, awkwardly. \nJOEY Your wife's real pretty. \nGEORGE She's not my wife. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMatthew lies awake in his bed, listening to George and Erin fight. \nGEORGE (O.S.) It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while -- \nERIN (O.S.) What do you want to talk about instead? Your day?  That's a fascinating subject. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nErin and George are fighting while they get ready for bed. \nGEORGE Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am -- \nERIN That is not what I'm -- \nGEORGE Bullshit, Erin.  Bullshit. \nThe fight is interrupted by the sound of BETH CRYING. \nERIN Great.  Excellent.  Thank you very much. \nShe leaves the room. \nINT. BETH'S ROOM - NIGHT \nBeth is wailing in her crib.  Erin comes in in her nightshirt and lifts Beth out.  Then, more to herself than to Beth: \nERIN It's okay, baby.  It'll be okay. \nShe runs her hand over Beth's head, then slides down the wall and crumples onto the floor.  As she curls around Beth, Erin starts to COUGH.  Deep, raspy coughs from way down low. \nEXT. PG&E STATION - NIGHT \nLate, late at night.  The plant is silent.  The property seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone inside the gates, staring up at the station. \nAfter a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant. It misses.  Not that it would do anything if it hit.  He reaches for another, throws it.  Then another, and another. He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant.  Then, overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a TERRIFYING YELL. \nEXT. HINKLEY GAS STATION - SUNSET \nErin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the bottle.  She checks her watch: 6:30.  The GAS STATION ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights. \nERIN This is the only station in town, right? \nATTENDANT Yup. \nHe gets in his car and drives off.  Erin sits down again. Looks down the road in both directions.  Nothing. \nThen she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint of chrome.  She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees: the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery. \nErin looks around, realizes she's alone.  As she looks back at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab. She realizes she's being watched.  The driver's door opens. \nErin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys.  She jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it won't turn over.  Panic.  The Man in the Dark Glasses has gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around again.  Not a soul.  She tries the engine again.  And again. \nJust as he gets to her car, the engine engages.  Erin peels out of the gas station. \nINT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT \nErin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus on the road.  She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing. \nShe reaches the train tracks.  A train is passing.  She has to stop.  As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce off her rear view mirror.  Truck lights, coming her way. Fuck.  She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back at the headlights closing in on her.  The train, the headlights, the train, the headlights ... \nFinally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last train car zips by.  Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car over the tracks.  The truck follows. \nEXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT \nThe Hyundai zips down the road.  And behind it, the truck. \nINT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT \nShe looks out at the landscape around her.  It's black.  No other cars on the road.  She starts to panic, accelerates. \nEXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT \nThe Hyundai going faster.  The truck still following. \nINT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT \nErin comes up on a stop sign.  She runs it.  So does the truck.   A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST CAUSE SALOON.  In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's Mercedes.  She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car. \nINT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT \nEd is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door.  She rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion. \nERIN Someone's following me. \nED What?  Who? \nERIN Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer. \nEd gets up and heads toward the door. \nED (to the counter guy) Beer, please. \nAs Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench. \nED What kind of truck? \nERIN I don't know.  Big.  Dark. \nED He's gone. (back to the table) Did you get a license plate?  Or a make? \nERIN No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things -- \nED I was just asking.  Are you all right? \nERIN Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine. \nEd looks at her.  She looks terrible.  Shaky, tired, drawn. \nED Jesus, you look like shit.  When was the last time you had a decent night's sleep? \nEXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT \nCrappy and pink.  Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot. Erin's Hyundai follows.  Ed stops, gets out. \nINT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT \nEd swings by Erin's open car window. \nED Don't worry.  I'm getting two rooms. \nEXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT \nErin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each rattling a key.  They find their adjacent rooms and stop. Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand. \nED Lock the door every which way you can.  And if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever -- pound on the wall.  I'll come right over. \nShe nods a little.  Then before she goes into her room: \nERIN I think you should know -- there's very few people in the world who don't piss me off 90 percent of the time. (beat) You're one of 'em. \nIt's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.  They look at each other.  Maybe even considering.  But after a long beat, she reaches for her door again.  Moment over. \nED I'm triple locking my door, so don't even think of trying to take advantage. \nShe smiles, goes inside.  He watches her close her door behind her before going inside himself. \nEXT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT STOOP - NIGHT \nERIN What? \nJANE I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night. \nERIN (seething) Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights? \nJANE You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something. \nErin glares at her ... \nERIN I don't believe this -- \n... then turns and storms out of Jane's office. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY \nEd is on the phone when Erin barges in, rage in her eyes. \nERIN I want my fucking money -- \nED (into phone) I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- (puts the call on hold, then, to Erin) Do you mind? \nERIN (seething) Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind. \nClearly, she's in a dander he's going to have to deal with. \nED Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or -- \nERIN It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me. \nED Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with -- \nERIN Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had? \nED Is that what you want? \nERIN I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day. \nEd sighs.  Realizes he's going to have to take this on. \nED I'll see what I can do. \nERIN You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake. \nShe storms out. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT \nErin is standing at the sink, visibly exhausted, trying to do the dinner dishes with one arm and comfort Beth, who's CRYING, with the other.  Matthew comes in. \nMATTHEW Can I play roller hockey? \nERIN We'll see. \nMATTHEW When? \nThe DOORBELL RINGS.  Erin goes to get it.  Matthew follows \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nMatthew is dogging Erin on this.  Beth is still crying. \nMATTHEW Randy's mom said yes right away. \nERIN (snapping) Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house. \nErin opens the door.  A MESSENGER is there. \nMESSENGER Erin Brockovich? \nERIN Yeah? \nMESSENGER Package from Masry & Vititoe. \nHe hands her a manila envelope.  She signs for the package, then tears into it as the Messenger heads away. \nA CHECK and a SET OF KEYS fall out.  She looks at the check. It's made out for $5,000.  A note attached reads \"HIRE A NANNY. AND LOOK OUTSIDE. - E.\" \nErin looks up and sees A BRAND-NEW CHEVY BLAZER parked on the curb.  She looks at the keys in her hand.  Chevy keys.  Whoa. \nEXT. MASRY & VITITOE, PARKING LOT - DAY \nErin drives up in the Blazer, pulls into a parking space. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, LAW LIBRARY - DAY \nIt's dark.  Ed's seated at a table, alone.  Erin walks by the door, then spots him and stops in the doorway. \nERIN Believe it or not, I would've been satisfied with just the check. \nEd turns, sees her. \nED Well, you go threatening to leave, I can't take any chances.  You're the only person around who understands what I'm doing. Things come up, I gotta know I got someone to turn to. \nShe sits, reading him. \nERIN What kind of things come up? \nED Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer. (beat) 20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it. \nERIN Whoa.  No shit. \nTHERESA You know what?  Why don't I take Erin down the hall, so we can start in on this stuff? \nErin notices all her files in stacks against the wall. \nERIN Hey -- those are my files -- \nTHERESA Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research. \nOkay, these people are starting to piss her off. \nERIN Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research. \nTHERESA No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask. \nERIN Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will. \nTHERESA Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them. \nERIN Whose number do you need? \nTHERESA Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs. \nERIN I said, whose number do you need? \nTHERESA You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart. \nErin just stares at her.  Theresa sighs, reluctantly glances down at a file. \nTHERESA Annabelle Daniels. \nERIN Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346. \nAs Theresa starts to write it down: \nERIN 10 years old, 11 in May.  Lived on the plume since birth.  Wanted to be a synchronized swimmer, so she spent every minute she could in the PG&E pool.  She had a tumor in her brain stem detected last November, had an operation on Thanksgiving, shrunk it with radiation after that.  Her parents are Rita and Ted.  Ted's got Chron's disease, and Rita has chronic headaches and nausea and underwent a hysterectomy last fall.  Ted grew up in Hinkley.  His brother Robbie and his wife May and their five kids Robbie, Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose, and Peter lived on the plume too.  Their number's 454-9445. You want their diseases? \nBeat.  Erin glares at Theresa, indignant. \nTHERESA Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here -- \nERIN That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes. \nINT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nIt's still raining.  Erin is following Ed to the car.  He's furious. \nERIN She insulted me! \nED Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect -- \nERIN Why the fuck should I respect her? \nEd stops in his tracks, furious.  He glares at her. \nED Because that's how people treat each other! \nERIN Not in my world. \nED Gee, I wonder why. \nOn that, he gets in his car, slams the door, and drives off, leaving her standing alone in the pouring rain. \nERIN Hey!  You're my ride! \nINT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - DAY \nPotter and Ed are walking down the hallway, mid-conversation. A FEW PARALEGALS follow them with files. \nPOTTER I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what -- \nED Right. \nPOTTER I think we should makes some changes. \nEXT. LINWOOD'S DAIRY - DAY \nBob Linwood is in his barn, mucking it out.  Theresa is at the edge of the property, trying unsuccessfully to get his attention by yelling and waving her arms.  In her expensive shoes, she's stopped short of the cow patty minefield. \nINT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON A CLIENT FILE as a hand fills in a phone number. \nWIDEN TO SEE Erin seated with a PARALEGAL, rattling off facts and numbers from memory.  She's seized by a COUGHING FIT. \nEXT. LINWOOD DAIRY - DAY \nTheresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention.  Finally, rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses it at the barn.  It hits the window and BREAKS IT. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - DAY \nErin's desk is empty: no Erin, no files, nothing.  Ed comes out of his office and hands Brenda a STACK OF DOCUMENTS. \nCLOSE ON THE FAX LED \nBrenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up again, only this time it says: POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD. \nINT. POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY \nA SECRETARY carries the documents to Potter's office.  On the way, she passes THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  Inside, Erin is still dictating to the PARALEGAL.  She's shivery with fever now. The floor around her is littered with tissues. \nINT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY \nED You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun -- \nERIN \"Fun?\"  Jesus, \"fun?\"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as \"fun?\" \nED Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't -- \nERIN Not personal?  That's my work in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is. \nShe starts to COUGH and CRUMBLE, but fights it. \nERIN (weakened) How dare you take that away from me. \nED No one's taking anything -- \nERIN Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get. \nBy now the entire office is watching.  As are the lawyers in the conference room. \nED Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ... \nERIN Perks?  Jesus -- perks? \nErin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone. \nERIN If this piece of shit is supposed to take the place of your respect, you can take it and shove it up your ass. \nShe throws it at him and storms away.  The phone hits the glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it.  Ed just stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the splintered glass wall. \nEXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY \nErin gets to her car.  As she opens the door, the ALARM SOUNDS.  She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out.  With the siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage. \nINT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT \nErin's driving home.  As she turns onto her street, her headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way. \nERIN Holy shit -- \nShe looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark. She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street.  A CAR HONKS. \nErin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again.  Holy shit, is right.  It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night. \nERIN Matthew -- \nShe pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk, blocking his path.  When he sees her car, he turns and runs the other way.  Erin leaps out and follows him. \nERIN Matthew!  MATTHEW! \nShe catches up and collars him. \nERIN God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here? \nMATTHEW I'm gonna go live with George. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMUSIC is playing.  TANIA is on the phone.  The receiver is yanked from her hand.  She turns to see Erin hovering over her, barely containing herself. \nERIN If you leave here real fast, I might not kill you. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATTHEW AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMatthew's in his bed, facing the wall.  Erin sitting on the foot of his bed, near tears.  Katie's watching from her bed. \nERIN We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise. \nMATTHEW You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised. \nERIN I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short. \nMATTHEW You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more. \nERIN Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing. (beat) I promise. \nShe lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and inches away from her. \nINT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nErin comes out of the bedroom.  As she turns to close the door, she collapses to the floor in a heap.  Out cold. \nINT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT \nA busy Southland ER.  George bursts through the doors with Katie, Matthew and Beth in tow.  He goes up to the desk. \nGEORGE I'm looking for Erin Brockovich.  They brought her in in an ambulance? \nINT. ER WAITING AREA - DAY \nThe kids are waiting.  George is talking to a DOCTOR. \nGEORGE Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis? \nDOCTOR It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain. \nGEORGE Jesus. \nDOCTOR She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now. \nGEORGE How does someone get meningitis? \nDOCTOR Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ... \nDONNA For what? \nERIN Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ... \nINT. MANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY \nErin, Donna, Mandy, and Tom are seated on the sofas.  Mandy signs an agreement.  Hands the pen to Tom, who also signs. \nEXT. LINWOODS' HOUSE - DAY \nFrom outside, we see Erin at the kitchen table with Donna and Bob and Ruth Linwood, who are listening intently. \nINT. DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY \nErin and Donna are leaving, saying good-bye to Mary DeSoto. Erin has a signed release form in her hand. \nINT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S CAR - DAY \nDISCO blares.  The two boxes.  The formerly empty one now has a small stack of signed release forms in it.  The top one has Bob Linwood's signature. \nIN THE FRONT SEAT \nErin is driving, eating a hamburger, and going over her list of plaintiffs. \nEXT. HINKLEY MART - EVENING \nPeople are going about their shopping.  Rita Daniels is stopped, talking with A FEW MORE PLAINTIFFS. \nRITA I thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's gonna take years \nINT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT \nThe signed stack has grown; the unsigned stack has shrunk. Erin drops five more agreements into the \"signed\" box. \nINT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nIn the wee hours.  While her kids sleep, Erin sits at the cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing, alphabetizing. \nINT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON ERIN, fast asleep at the table, her face pressed against the linoleum.  There's some NOISE in the room, WHISPERING.  Erin stirs and looks around to see George behind her, diapering Beth, while Matt and Katie put their shoes on. \nERIN What time is it? \nGEORGE Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast. \nErin forces herself awake. \nERIN No, I need my car -- \nGEORGE We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep. \nHe picks up Beth, takes Katie's hand, and calls across the room to Matthew. \nGEORGE C'mon, pal.  Leave that alone, we gotta go. \nErin turns to see Matthew holding one of her release forms. \nERIN Oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay? I got 'em all organized.  Just put it back. \nBut he's reading it.  And something has caught his attention. He looks up at Erin. \nMATTHEW This girl's the same age as me. \nErin gently takes the form away from Matthew, wanting to shield him from the harsh realities of this case. \nERIN That's right, sweetheart. \nShe replaces the form on top of the stack. \nMATTHEW She's one of the sick people? \nERIN Yeah.  She is. (beat) But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better. \nMatthew mulls this over a bit more. \nMATTHEW How come her own mom isn't helping her? \nERIN Cause her own mom's real sick, too. \nMatthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the door, where George, Beth, and Katie are waiting for him. Before he leaves, though, he turns back to Erin. \nMATTHEW Maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast. You want eggs? \nShe looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward acceptance.  Smiles, moved. \nERIN Eggs'd be great, baby.  Eggs'd be perfect. \nINT. ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY \nErin's driving along a dusty Hinkley road, eating cold eggs out of a take-out container with her fingers. \nEXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY \nMorning.  A GROUP OF MEN are arriving at work.  Erin's truck pulls up.  She grabs some release forms from the truck and wanders up to the men. \nERIN Hey, y'all.  How you all doing today? \nINT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY \nShe tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack. \n", "test1_input": "\"Erin Brockovich\", early draft, by Susannah Grant \nERIN BROCKOVICH A True Story \nby \nSusannah Grant \nFebruary 1, 1998 \nEXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY \nPalms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms. \nON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk, past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops, Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE- HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see they're leaving a 99-cent store. \nAs the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS. Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going. \nThey saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes rest on her a microsecond longer than usual. \n- Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the tops of her thighs. \n- A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR. \n- A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER. \nIt isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH. \nEXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY \nA side street.  No pedestrians, just parked cars.  A PARKING TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai. \nERIN Fuck. \nEven when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze. \nAs she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses accidentally CLATTER to the ground. \nERIN Shit. \nWhen she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement. \nERIN God damn it. \nShe tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in. \nWIDER ON THE STREET \nThe Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops. \nEXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY \nA boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded by strip malls.  Definitely not where the power lawyers work. \nROSALIND (O.S.) Morning, Mr. Masry.  How you doing today? \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY \nGeneric.  Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art.  A sign over the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW. \nED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM -- already rumpled. \nED Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind. \nWhatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that is his career has long since dissipated.  He trundles off toward his office. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY \nEd's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner. She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed. \nBRENDA Tony Marvin. \nED Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time? \nBRENDA His dry cleaners.  You want him? \nED What do you think?  What's this? \nHe grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card. \nBRENDA Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend. \nED Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client. \nBRENDA He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there. \nEd peers into his office.  It's a mess -- papers everywhere, unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin, in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress.  As she jiggles a spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously. Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace. \nED Whoa. (to Brenda) Remind me. \nBRENDA Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says. (sarcastic) And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think? \nED You shouldn't judge, Brenda. \nBRENDA Right.  Lap-dancers are people too. \nAs Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone. \nBRENDA I can't find him, Tony.  We'll have to call you back. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY \n", "test1_true": "ED Erin -- hi.  Sorry you had to wait.  Here, sit down, sit down. \nHe clears a stack of papers off a chair. \nERIN Thanks a lot. (as she sits) I tell you, I never thought just standing would take it out of me, but ever since that shithead hit me, it feels like my whole body's put together wrong. \nEd gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy. \nED Jesus, you poor thing. (he sits) Well, listen, you came to the right place. Whoever did this to you made one hell of a mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make him pay for it. \nHe takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write. \nED Why don't you tell me what happened? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY \nErin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to Ed, who's questioning her. \nERIN I was pulling out real slow, and out of nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the corner like a bat outta hell ... \nShe glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits nobly in surgical scrubs.  His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS are behind him.  A frigging Norman Rockwell painting. \nLATER IN HER TESTIMONY: \nERIN They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now. \nSTILL LATER: \nERIN ... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids. \nSTILL LATER: \nERIN ... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months. \nSTILL LATER: \nERIN ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know? \nED (oh so moved) Yeah.  I know. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nErin is still on the stand.  But now the doctor's lawyer is questioning her. \nDEFENDING LAWYER Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out? \nERIN Which one? \nDEFENDING LAWYER (feigning shock) There's more than one? \nERIN Yeah.  There's two.  Why? \nErin looks over at the jury.  The personification of conservative family values.  Oh, shit. \nLATER IN HER TESTIMONY: \nERIN (getting defensive) ... not like a career, cause I had my babies. But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't have this neck thing. \nErin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem. Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch. \nDEFENDING LAWYER (sarcastic) Right.  No doubt. \nErin sees a few jurors share dubious glances.  Great. \nSTILL LATER: \nThe defendant's lawyers is on the offensive.  Erin's starting to feel the case slipping away. \nDEFENDING LAWYER So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon. \nERIN (pointed) What's your point? \nEd shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad. \nDEFENDING LAWYER Broke, three kids, no job.  A doctor in a Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good meal ticket. \nErin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement. She's on a sinking ship. \nERIN What?  Hey -- he hit me. \nDEFENDING LAWYER So you say. \nERIN He came tearing around the corner, out of control -- \nDEFENDING LAWYER An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control -- \nERIN (erupting) That asshole smashed in my fucking neck! \nINT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY \nThe door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out, furious.  Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator. \nERIN Open and shut?  Open and fucking shut? \nED If you hadn't used profanity -- \nERIN Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap -- \nED I told you the questions might get a little personal -- \n", "test2_input": "INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nErin's sitting up now, jiggling her knee, unable to sit still.  She checks her watch again.  6:30.  She can't take it.  She throws off the blanket and gets up. \nERIN Come on, kids, we're going for a ride. \nINT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON HANDS.  As people stream in, they are each handed a release form with a space for a signature on the bottom. \nINT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - LATER \nIt's sweltering.  The room, packed with plaintiffs, hums with horse flies and tension.  People are fanning themselves with the release forms.  Potter's addressing them from a raised platform.  Ed, Theresa, and Andrew are seated behind him. \nPOTTER Binding arbitration isn't all that different from a trial.  It's overseen by a judge. Evidence is presented in much the same way. \nEXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT \nOne more car pulls into the lot.  It's Erin's Chevy. \nINT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT \nErin unbuckles her seat belt. \nERIN Stay in the car, babies, I won't be long. \nEXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT \nErin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a window and looks in at the packed meeting. \nPLAINTIFF (O.S.) And then a jury decides? \nPOTTER (O.S.) No, sorry, I should have mentioned that. There's no jury in binding arbitration.  No jury, and no appeal. \nShe climbs up on an old wagon for a better view. \nBOB LINWOOD (O.S.) No appeal?  So what are our options if we don't like the result? \nPOTTER (O.S.) Well -- you have none.  The judge's decision is final.  But I really don't anticipate that as a problem. \nINT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT \nNow, in addition to the stifling heat, the large room is thick with mistrust.  People are shifting in their seats, whispering to each other. \nTOM BROWN You don't even know what it's gonna be; how do you know we're gonna like it? \nAgreeing MURMURS ripple through the crowd. \nPOTTER As I said before, it will definitely be somewhere between 50 and 400 million dollars. \nMANDY BROWN Which?  There's a big difference there. \nPOTTER I wouldn't want to speculate at this point. \nMANDY BROWN Ed -- what do you think it'll be? \nPotter turns around and looks at Ed seated behind him. \nED I think ... Kurt's right.  We shouldn't speculate. \nMANDY BROWN So then, what, that mystery number's divided up at the whim of some judge -- \nPOTTER Judges don't make decisions based on whim, ma'am.  They make them based on precedent and evidence. \nThe GRUMBLE of discontent has overtaken the room.  More whispering, more movement. \nEXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT \nErin watches the meeting fall apart.  It's driving her crazy. \nERIN Fucking idiot -- \nINT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT \nPotter sees he's losing them, too.  Tries to gain control. \nPOTTER Look.  Everyone.  Is this a big decision? Absolutely.  But I do believe that if you put a little faith in the system, you'll be quite pleased with the outcome. \nTed Daniels gets up from his seat. \nTED DANIELS Mr. Potter, if you knew me from Adam, you'd know that being pleased isn't an option for me anymore.  Now don't take this personally, sir, but I've never seen you before in my life.  I'm not about to put my faith in anything just cause you tell me to. \nHe drops his agreement form, unsigned, then takes Rita's hand and heads for the door. \nEXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT \nMeeting's over.  The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse. Cars start up, headlights flick on.  People pull away. \nINT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT \nEveryone has left.  Erin enters and looks around.  The floor is littered with rejected, unsigned release forms. \nShe thinks for a moment, then gets an idea.  She picks up a release form, and leaves the firehouse. \nEXT. MINI MALL - NIGHT \nEverything's closed, except the KINKO'S store at the far end. Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot. \nINT. KINKO'S - NIGHT \nA BORED EMPLOYEE is at the register, painting with Wite-Out on a blue piece of paper.  Erin enters, dragging her kids. \n", "test2_true": "The Employee gives it to her.  Erin crosses to the copiers. She slips the release form into one, then taps in the number of copies: 635.  Presses \"START.\"  The machine WHIRS to life. \nEXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT \nErin's Chevy pulls into the parking lot. \nMATTHEW (O.S.) I don't want to stay here.  It smells. \nINT. HINKLEY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nErin is entering the crappy motel room with her kids. \nERIN We got no choice.  I'm not gonna make it home tonight.  Now go wash up and climb into bed. \nAs the kids wander toward the bathroom, Erin picks up the phone and dials.  RING, RING. \nGEORGE (O.S.) Hello? \nERIN Hi.  It's me. (silence) I got a favor to ask you. \nGEORGE (O.S.) I don't do favors for you anymore. \nERIN It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with. \nEXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - DAY \nVery early.  Erin is visible in the motel office, talking to the clerk, when George's motorcycle pulls into the lot.  She turns around and sees him pulling up next to her Chevy. \nEXT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nErin comes up to him, hands him a key. \nERIN I got you your own room. \nHe takes it, glances toward the motel room. \nGEORGE They up? \nERIN Hunh-uh.  Not yet. (awkward beat) Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere. \nShe hands him a wad of cash. \nGEORGE How long's this whole thing gonna take? \nERIN I don't know.  Few days. (beat) Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it. \nHe nods.  She gets into her car.  Before closing the door, she turns back to him. \nERIN And I miss you. \nGEORGE Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find. \nShe sees how mad she's made him.  Takes a beat. \nERIN I treated you real bad, George.  I know that.  But, my problem was -- I never been with anyone who deserved better than that. You're the first nice guy who ever liked me. \nGeorge softens, shifts.  He steps toward the truck and gently closes her door, so he's standing close to her. \nERIN I just ... didn't know how to handle it. That's all. \nHe thinks about this.  Finally: \nGEORGE Think you could learn? \nERIN (with a smile) You know me.  I pick things up real fast. \nHe smiles back at her, nods, then tenderly brushes a piece of hair out of her eyes. \nGEORGE You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick. \nERIN Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't. \nHe nods, understanding.  Then he taps the side of her truck and turns toward the motel room.  She puts the truck in gear and pulls out. \nEXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - DAY \nErin's Chevy is bombing down the road. \nINT.

DONNA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY \nErin is sitting with Pete and Donna. \nDONNA I don't know, Erin -- the way he was talking to us, telling us everything was gonna be fine -- I just didn't trust him. \nPETE And after all we been through -- no jury, no appeal.  It just makes me nervous. \nERIN I understand all that. And I don't wanna force you into anything.  If you don't want to sign, that's fine.  But why don't we talk it over a little, cause I'd sure hate for you to turn this down for the wrong reasons. \nEXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe door opens.  Erin emerges, holding two signed agreements. Donna is letting her out. \nERIN You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna? \n", "test3_input": "ROSALIND In the conference -- \nBut Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can finish.  Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her gait.  They watch her with interest. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated slew of paper that PG&E is sending them.  Ed, Kurt, Theresa, Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them. \nErin breezes in like sunshine. \nERIN Morning! \nED Erin?  What are you -- \nERIN (ignoring Ed) You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you. \nShe plunks the box down on the table.  Potter opens the top of the box.  Looks in. \nERIN 635.  They all signed.  Every single one. \nIN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering what's up.  A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads across Ed's face. \nED Ho - ly - shit. \nERIN Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too. \nErin hands Ed a manila envelope.  He opens it. \nERIN Internal PG&E documents, all about the contamination.  The one I like best says, and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes, the water's poisonous, but it'd be better for all involved if this matter wasn't discussed with the neighbors.  It's to the Hinkley station, from PG&E Headquarters. Stamped received, March, 1966. \nPotter and Theresa reel.  Ed shakes his head in disbelief. \nPOTTER Where did -- how did you do this? \nERIN Well, what with me not having any brains or legal expertise, I just went on up there and performed sexual favors.  635 blow jobs in five days.  Whew, am I ever tired. \nAnd she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed. The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away. \nEXT.

As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office. \nED Hey! \nErin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing.  He stares at her, in awe. \nED I don't know what to say. \nERIN Say you were wrong. \nED I was wrong. \nERIN Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself. \nED I did.  Both. \nERIN Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this. \nED The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history. \nHe looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in the elevator.  He walks toward her, stops right outside the elevator. \nED But I know you're not gonna quit on me. \nERIN How do you know that? \nED (with a smile) Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance. \nOf course she will.  She releases her hand so he won't see her smiling.  Ed watches the doors close. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PCH - DAY \nOne of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball. \nErin's Chevy moves up the PCH.  DISCO music emanates from it. \nINT. ERIN'S CHEVY - DAY \nErin's at the wheel.  Time has passed -- her hair's a little different.  She's singing along with \"Funky Town.\" \nEXT.

After a breathless beat: \nDONNA I don't even know how much money that is. \nERIN It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough. \nDonna wipes the tears off her face, then watches the light flickering off her girls playing in the surf. \nDONNA I can put them in a good school. \nERIN Any school you want. \nDONNA And get someone to help around the house. \nERIN Yup. \nDONNA Oh my God.  Oh my God. \nDonna is overwhelmed.  Erin pulls her close. \nDONNA Oh, my God. \nEXT. MASRY & VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nNow this is where the hot lawyers work.  A gleaming testament to power. \nINT. MASRY & VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE - DAY \nBoxes everywhere.  They just moved in.  Everyone is unpacking at his or her desk.

Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ...\" \nERIN Ed, I swear, I'm not -- \nED Okay, fine.  Fine  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ... \nHe reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a check.  Hands it to her. \nERIN What is that? \nED Take it. \nErin does.  Looks at it.  Her eyes bug out. \nERIN Two million dollars? \nED The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me. \nShe stares at it, speechless.  He goes back to unpacking \nED Oh, now I suppose you're gonna say it's not enough.  Well, tough, Erin.  Too goddamn bad.  Cause this is absolutely, positively where I draw the line. \nFADE OUT. \nTHE END \nErin Brockovich Writers : \u00a0\u00a0Susannah Grant Genres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama User Comments \n"}

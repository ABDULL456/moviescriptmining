JOE Jesus, Seth. 
SETH They're gonna be here any minute, are they here? 
JOE No, they're not here. Who? 
SETH Christ. Joe. Christ. Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns the apartment lights off. 
SETH (CONT'D) (re: the lights) What are you doing? Right. Smart. 
JOE Seth, sit down here. CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table. 
SETH Late to my own funeral. Mom always said... 
JOE Tell me now. 
SETH Christ, Joe. Late to my own goddamn funeral. Can you help me? 
JOE Seth, what did you do? 
SETH You can protect me a little, right? Just so they don't... jeez. Oh jeez. This is like a nightmare. This is a nightmare. 
JOE (V.O.) I knew then what he did so I don't know why I asked. 
JOE (CONT'D) What did you do? Seth lifts his eyes to Joe. 
SETH He was singing. 
EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
FLASH: a hog-tied man with a sack over his head appears. Singing. Seth, with his gun raised, hesitates. 
SETH (V.O.) Through the gag and mask, but I could hear the tune. Deep memories, my mom in a dark room, singing. Back warm and safe, when I coulda still been good. And once I knew it was him... Joe I couldn't. I couldn't. I had to see. Seth pulls the sack off the man's head. 
INT. JOE'S APARTMENT 
SETH Joe I can't even tell you. Looking in his eyes. I had to let him talk, then. I don't even remember the words, but I remember believing every one of them, or not even believing, but submitting. I've never felt that small before. I've never felt that happy. He told me. I remember, there's a new holy terror boss-man in the future, and he's closing all the loops. The Rainmaker, they call him. He told me. 
(MORE) 
SETH (CONT'D) Then he wanted a cigarette and I untied him, and he gives me this look. And he just starts running. 
EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
Seth standing with his gun in his limp arm, receding behind us as we run away. 
SETH (V.O.) And I had my blunderbuss so I know he's got about fifteen strides till he's out of my range. And they come and go, and I just watch him till he's gone. 
INT. JOE'S APARTMENT 
Seth breaks down crying. 
JOE (V.O.) This is called letting your loop run. It's not a good thing. 
SETH What do I do? You're the only friend I got Joe you gotta help me 
JOE You fucking idiot coming here. Seth, sucker punched. 
JOE (CONT'D) You can't be here, I'll give you a little money but you gotta 
SETH Joe? A little - where am I gonna - 
JOE You hop a freight train, you beat it the hell out POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses 
JOE (CONT'D) Shut up. Don't move. Goes to the door. Two GAT MEN and Kid Blue stand outside. 
KID BLUE Open up Joe! (to the gat man) Watch the window.

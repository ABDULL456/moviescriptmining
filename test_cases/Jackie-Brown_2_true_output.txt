MAX Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her? 
ORDELL Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit - and mind you, I said "if" - it was just her shit to get high with. 
MAX Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business? 
Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket. 
ORDELL Okay, man. I got your money. But don't you ever ask me for no fuckin' favor. 
INT. MAX'S CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT 
It's early evening; and Max's powder-blue Seville is driving to the County Jail with a client, a young Hispanic woman of twenty named ANITA. 
MAX Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral 
ANITA I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother. 
MAX But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would. 
ANITA I know. That's why I went. 
MAX But then you told her you were home. 
ANITA Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go. 
Max gives up. 
MAX I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem. (getting stern) Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand? 
ANITA I understand. 
MAX I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries. 
Like an exasperated teenager. 
ANITA I understand. 
MAX Then say "Yes, Max. I understand." 
ANITA Yes, Max, I understand. 
INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT 
POV THROUGH A WIRE MESH CAGE 
Max and Anita, side by side. Anita's hands are cuffed behind her back. 
MAX Dropping off and picking up. Dropping of Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown, Jackie. 
We're at the admitting desk of the L.A. County Jail. Max undoes Anita's handcuffs, while a SHERIFF waits to take her away. 
ANITA So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow? 
MAX I'll call her. 
ANITA Won't forget? 
MAX I won't forget. 
She kisses Max on the cheek and the Sheriff takes her away. 
ANITA Thanks, Max. See you later. 
Max puts the cuffs away, sits on a bench, takes out a Len Deighton paperback and begins to read. 
FADE TO BLACK 
FADE UP: 
MAX 
Still reading his novel. We hear offscreen, a SHERIFF'S voice. 
SHERIFF (O.S.) Max! Here she comes. 
Max puts his book down and see - 
Jackie being led into the Admitting Area by TWO SHERIFFS. She's wearing her stewardess uniform and carrying a small envelope with her belongings in it and her shoes. When Max was imagining a woman in her forties, he had someone with a bit of wear and tear on them in mind. But this Jackie Brown's a knockout. 
As he watches her, she steps out of the County Jail slippers she was wearing and slips into her shoes. 
He approaches, handing her his card. 
MAX Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm your bail bondsman. 
She takes the card and shakes his hand saying nothing. 
MAX (CONT'D) I can give you a lift home if you'd like? 
JACKIE Okay. 
INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - NIGHT 
Max puts his key in the ignition, when Jackie asks; 
JACKIE Are you really a bail bondsman? 
MAX Who do you think I am? 
She doesn't answer. 
MAX (CONT'D) I gave you my card there. 
JACKIE Can I see your I.D.? 
MAX You're serious? 
She waits. 
Max digs the case out of his pocket, hands it to her, then reaches up and turns on the light above them for her to see. 
MAX'S ID: SURETY AGENT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
JACKIE Who put up my bond? Ordell? 
MAX In cash. 
She looks straight ahead. 
Max shifts into drive. 
Max rolls down his window at the front gate. A DEPUTY comes out of the gatehouse and hands through the window Max's .38 revolver, cylinder opened. Max hands the Deputy his pass in exchange for the gun, says "thanks", then puts the .38 in his glovebox in front of Jackie. He drives on. 
MAX AND JACKIE (MOVING) 
JACKIE Can we stop for cigarettes? 
MAX Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?

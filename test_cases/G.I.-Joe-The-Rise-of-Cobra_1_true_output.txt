BREAKER Now we can run the face through an infinity scan. 
HAWK We have access to any photograph on any server anywhere in the world. 
BREAKER Everyone gets photographed in some way at some time. ATM machines, airports, crowd shots at a football game. We'll find her. Duke just stares at Ana's photo. Ripcord whispers quietly: 
RIPCORD You okay? 
DUKE (not okay) .what happened to her? For once, Ripcord doesn't know what to say. Cover Girl walks in and hands a document to Hawk, who looks through it. 
HAWK From NATO. I am now the official custodian of the warheads. Your mission is complete. Once you hand it over, that is. Duke nods, hands over the case with a hint of defeat. 
DUKE When you move it, she's gonna come after you, you know that, right? (off Hawk's look) And with her Intel, and her toys... she'll find you. 
HAWK And your point is...? 
DUKE You're going to go after her first. And I want to help. 
RIPCORD Let us in on this, General. Our team just got wasted. I think a little payback is in order. 
HAWK You don't ask to be a part of GI JOE. You get asked. 
DUKE You scouted me four years ago, now I'm ready. Let's have at it. 
HAWK I've lost men too, Captain. Good men. But attempting to-- 
DUKE I know her. 
HAWK Excuse me? 
DUKE You said knowing is half the battle. Well, I know who she is. Duke reaches into his pocket, pulls out a photo and shows Hawk. INSERT PHOTO: Ana, four years earlier, much softer looking, staring lovingly at Duke as they're about to kiss. 
DUKE (CONT'D) Her name is Ana Lewis, and I can tell you everything you need to know about her until... four years ago. After that, well, obviously sa lot's changed. Hawk just stares in disbelief. 
INT. HAWK'S STATEROOM - DAY 
Hawk sits down behind his desk and looks up at Duke, still standing at attention. 
HAWK Before this goes any further, I need to know what I'm dealing with, a man looking to settle a score, or a man who can put the mission first. Because the battlefield is the wrong place for emotion. (he pauses for effect) Could you kill her? 
DUKE If I had to. 
HAWK Chances are you will. But if you flinch, hesitate even an instant... what I'm trying to say is, unless you can kill her graveyard dead I don't want you. 
DUKE I can. (off Hawk's look) I signed on to deliver those warheads, General, and despite your present authority, I want to finish the job. Hawk regards him for a moment. 
HAWK So tell me about her. 
DUKE Okay, I'll start right here: I hope that vault is tight, because she always gets what she wants... 
EXT. THE BARONESS' MANSION - PARIS - NIGHT 
A BLACK, BEEFED-UP SUV drives towards a magnificent mansion in the Parisian suburbs. Though the vehicle looks relatively harmless, we'll come to know it as a "SCARAB" attack truck. 
SUPER: PARIS, FRANCE 
INT. FOYER - THE BARONESS' MANSION - PARIS - NIGHT 
Ana enters the mansion. SERVANTS take her coat as her handsome, sophisticated and well dressed husband, BARON LEON DECOBRAY, glides up to her, very French. They kiss warmly. 
DECOBRAY Hello, darling. 
ANA How is work at the lab?

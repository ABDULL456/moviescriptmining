{"train": "by \nScott Yagemann \nREVISED SHOOTING DRAFT \nNovember 4, 1996 \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nRev. 7/10/96 \n1   EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN SKYLINE - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING    1 RUSH HOUR \nON a pair of black Dexter penny loafers diligently pedaling an old Schwinn mountain bike. ADJUST ANGLE now to meet the bicyclist... \nHe's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD. \nADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind him. Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers. \nTrevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft. above the East River. \nA fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks back and forth as he pumps the pedals. \nFROM ABOVE now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour traffic on the bridge below. \n2   EXT. ATLANTIC AVENUE (BEDFORD STUYVESANT) - MORNING         2 \nA wrought-iron train trestle covered with graffiti shakes as an \"EL\" TRAIN ROARS overhead. Trevor races parallel with it along Atlantic Avenue. Every city block becomes more and more rundown. \n3   EXT. ROOSEVELT WHITNEY HIGH SCHOOL (BEDFORD                 3 STUYVESANT) - MORNING \nA cyclone fence frames the stalwart face of the old three-story administration building. Ubiquitous gray patches of paint fail to cover where taggers have most recently left their marks. The ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, a black man with a booming voice, barks at late-comers who are about to be tardy... \nASSISTANT PRINCIPAL (clapping his hands) ... Let's go, people! Tardy lock- out starts in one minute! Get your butts in gear! One minute, people! Move it! \n(CONTINUED) \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                  2. \n3    CONTINUED:                                                      3 \nSUPERIMPOSE:    ROOSEVELT WHITNEY HIGH SCHOOL - OCTOBER 1994 \nThe Assistant Principal, attention diverted, doesn't even notice Trevor as he enters on his bike and races down the sidewalk in front of the school. With all the prompting, students still don't seem to be in much of a hurry. \n4    OMITTED                                                         4 \n5    INT. RWHS \"A\" BUILDING - MAIN ENTRANCE                          5 \n... as Trevor squeezes through the doorway past students being processed through card readers and metal detectors and turns down the main hall. \n6    INT. RWHS - MAIN FLOOR                                          6 \nWith a glance over his shoulder, Trevor hops back onto his bike and pedals it down the middle of the corridor. STRAGGLING STUDENTS either ignore him or look at him like he's insane. \nSTRAGGLING STUDENT (as Trevor passes) ... No ridin' bikes in 'a hallway, stoo-pit. \n6A   INT. STAIRWELL                                                  6A \nAs Trevor reaches the end of the main corridor... and steers his bike down the stairs. \n7    INT. RWHS - BOTTOM FLOOR                                        7 \nTrevor coasts skillfully down the stairs and emerges onto the bottom floor of the school. He pedals away toward the other end of the corridor. \n7A   EXT. TREVOR'S CLASSROOM                                         7A \nA crowd of 10th graders loiter outside Trevor's room. Seeing him coming, they stir to life with a flurry of taunts. Trevor chooses to face all dissension with a smile. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                               3. \n7A   CONTINUED:                                                  7A \nAs Trevor hops off his bike and unlocks the classroom door, he notices two lovers making out in the hallway... \nVOICE IN CROWD ... Yuh late, Garfield. \nTREVOR (catching his breath) ... No, bell hasn't rung yet. Okay, let's get inside. C'mon. (as they file into the room) ... Morning, morning. Rise and shine. \nTWO STUDENTS make passing comments... \nAUGGIE (shaking his head) ... You one crazy-ass nigga, G. \nTYWAN (a quarter stuck in one ear) ... Damn skippy. \nTREVOR Thank you for sharing, Auggie. \nTYWAN (provoking Auggie) ... Auggie doggie. \nAUGGIE (O.S.) Fuck you, Tywan. Yer mama's a gangsta-rapper. \nTrevor offers a pleasant greeting to the two lovers. \nTREVOR 'Scuse me, you two... this isn't the Playboy Channel. \nTrevor enters the room, but ducks his head back into the hall. \nA PUERTO RICAN WOMAN prods a group of gangbanger wanna- bes. Two of the teens hover over a Sony Walkman, sharing the earphones. \nSECRETARY Okay, fellas, off the table. Put the Walkman away. I said put it away... \nA 10th grade counselor's office opens and a student emerges. Trevor walks directly in. \nTREVOR Walter, I need to speak with you. \nWALTER (Anglo; 52) is a disheveled middle-aged counselor. A lifer. He chews on an empty smoking pipe as he glances through a student \"cum\" (cue-mm). \nWALTER (preoccupied) I'm pretty busy right now, Garfield. What is it? \nTrevor sets the book down on Walter's desk and nervously adjusts his glasses. \nTREVOR Could you open it, please? \nWalter opens the book. \nWALTER (a weary look of disgust) Don't suppose this kid cares about our budget crisis? (shuts the book) Have the textbook room charge him for the book. \nWalter snaps the book shut and looks up at Trevor. That's all? \nTREVOR One-Eight-Seven is a penal code number for murder, Walter. Means the same thing as T-O-S. 'Terminate On the Spot.' \n(CONTINUED) \n11   CONTINUED:                                                     11 \nWALTER (piqued) For chrissake, I know what it stands for. Look, kid probably heard it in a rap song. Doesn't mean anything. \nTREVOR ... The book belongs to Dennis Broadway. He's a known gangster, Walter -- a 'Five Percenter.' \nWALTER Garfield, if I had a dollar for every time a student threatened faculty... Don't you think you're overreacting a little? \nTREVOR (suppressing trepidation) Did you tell Dennis Broadway he was getting a fail from me? \nWALTER (stymied) I have legal access to those files. \nTREVOR He's a transfer from Nixon High School, isn't he? \nWALTER (becoming defensive) Look, I'm not obligated to track you down every time a transfer student comes through here. You want confidential information like that, come look it up in his cum (cue-mm). \nTrevor exhales a sigh of resignation. \nTREVOR Do you have him on a contract? \nWALTER If he gets through the semester without a fail then he gets to go back to Nixon, so what? \nTREVOR ... and be with his homeboys. \n(CONTINUED) \n11   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             11 \nWalter's caught between a rock and a hard place.   His instincts lean toward self-preservation. \nWALTER So he blew his opportunity. Now he has to learn to live with the consequences. \nTREVOR I don't think this kid's ready to deal with the consequences. I think he wants me dead. \nWALTER Relax, has nothin' to do with you. \nTREVOR I should have been told, Walter. \nWALTER Hey, I'm on your side, Garfield, but my hands are tied. Kid has a right to his privacy... Know what your problem is? You're an idealist. \nTREVOR What's wrong with that? \nWALTER You only see what you wanna see, that's what's wrong. On one hand you think someone's trying to kill you. On the other hand you actually believe kids are paying attention in your classes. \nTrevor resigns himself to the fact that he's come to the wrong person for support. \nTREVOR (collecting himself) Never mind. It's not a problem. \nWALTER (an empty promise) Tell you what, as soon as I get a chance I'll summons the kid. Promise. \nTrevor's bemusement holds us. \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                              10. \n12   INT. RWHS \"A\" BUILDING - MAIN CORRIDOR - MORNING            12 \nTrevor retraces his steps back up the empty corridor as the passing BELL RINGS. Within seconds the corridor is teeming with teenagers. \nInto SLOW MOTION now. MANEUVERING THROUGH the crowd to DISCOVER DENNIS BROADWAY (16). About ten paces behind. His Snoop-Dogg Afro frames a gold earring and a pair of deep-set eyes filled with vitriol. Oblivious of Dennis, Trevor presses on toward the north stairwell. \nVARIOUS SHOTS OVERHEAD and THROUGH crowd as the gap between Dennis and Trevor narrows. Every facial expression, every blink of an eye, all magnified a hundred times. \nBroadway's right hand is wrapped in a dirty white handkerchief as he reaches into the front pocket of his baggie Solos and pulls out a block of wood with a ten-penny nail imbedded in it. \n13   INT. RWHS - AT NORTH STAIRWELL                              13 \nTrevor's heavy eyelids blink as he slowly glances up into a parabolic mirror on the wall. A silent, paroxysmal terror registers on his face. \nIn a parabolic mirror, the blurred image of Dennis Broadway, pushing hard toward a conclusion now. \nBACK TO SPEED as Dennis explodes forward, body blocking Trevor from behind, pinning him against a wall and sending the \"187\" textbook flying. \nHe rams his weapon into Trevor's back. \n21   CONTINUED:                                                        21 \nTEACHER #1 (pointing) All the way out, next to the parking lot. Last bungalow on the left. \nTREVOR ... Thank you. \nTEACHER #1 (fatalistic) Good luck. \nHer comment weighs on him as he resumes his winding path through the bustle of students headed for first period. \n22   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - MAIN CORRIDOR/CLASSROOMS -               22 TREVOR'S POV \nGlancing through open doorways. Observing the inner life of various classrooms in passing... sees students watch- ing TV, teacher ignores them. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n23   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - CLASSROOM #2                             23 \nANGLO MALE, 39, slouching behind his desk, attempting to read a newspaper but distracted by an offstage commotion. \nCLASSROOM #2 TEACHER (ANGLO MALE) (erupting) ... Sit down. I come back there and you're gonna be sorry. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n24   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - CLASSROOM #3/COMPUTER LAB                24 \nOn the opposite side of the corridor... we can hear Ellen Henry's voice before reaching her doorway. All brightness and light, full of enthusiasm... \nELLEN (O.S.) (like,    a buzzer; times    up) ... EEEEgghh!     Wrong. William, you know this.     C'mon, how do you find the pound    sign? What's the fastest way? \n(CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED:                                                   24 \nNow we see her through the doorway. ELLEN HENRY (TEACHER #3). She's thirty, Anglo, and non-tenured. At the front of the class ten students stand linked together, arm-in- arm, in a human chain. WILLIAM (15) sits behind a computer in the front row struggling to decipher the problem... \nELLEN (playfully) You're not thinking. (a major clue) How 'bout Binary search. \nWilliam remains puzzled. The chain of students delight in chiding him. \"C'mon, Beavis!\"... \nELLEN (the answer) You split them! \nEllen attempts to bisect the impulsive chain of students with a double-handed karate chop. Fickle chain that they are, they resist. \nELLEN (amused) ... Very funny. \nNow a SLOW MOTION fleeting moment as she catches Trevor's passing gaze and openly smiles at him. \n25   INT. MEN'S BATHROOM                                          25 \nTrevor rinses his face at the sink as Victor Sifuentes' head speaks to him from above one of the heavily graffitied stalls in b.g. \nVICTOR So who yuh here for? \nTREVOR Eskander. \nVICTOR (zipping up, exiting) Aw, man, you got bungalow duty. \n26   EXT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - BUNGALOWS - MORNING                 26 \nOn a MEANDERING COURSE, MERGING with Trevor now. \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:                                                       26 \nIncreasing evidence of tagging, and bands of wandering students, indicate a higher degree of disorder the further one gets from the Main Office. \nFROM ABOVE NOW, like Algernon and his maze, Trevor negotiates his own path deeper and deeper into the configuration of bungalows. \n... And Trevor's trepidation. Eyes discerning every passerby. His PULSE AUDIBLY RACES, senses heightened. \nSHIFTING INTO SLOW MOTION AGAIN... And the reverberating SOUND of a SPRAY PAINT MARBLE as Trevor rounds a corner and comes face to face with three tag-bangers concealing spray paint cans inside their oversized jackets. One of the taggers locks eyes with Trevor as he passes, a slow premonitory burn. The tagger has a \"skin tight\" (pelon) hair cut and a string of black rosary beads around his neck. A barcode tattoo on the back of his neck identi- fies BENNY. \n27   EXT. UTILITY SHED AND VICINITY - MORNING                         27 \n... Behind the bungalows, adjacent the delivery gate. Meet DAVE CHILDRESS, a forty-something ditto-head. The residual effects of a hangover linger as he sneaks a cigarette before first period. He wears a faded Hawaiian shirt and Huarache sandals. An old military tattoo emblazons his left forearm. As he crushes out his cigarette, something catches his eye. \n28   EXT. UTILITY SHED                                                28 \n... Thru a chain-link fence we see a handful of cholo- types loitering around the shed. \nChildress investigates.    As he approaches the fence... \nCHILDRESS ... Hey, ese(s)?! \nHomeboys scatter in all directions, some hop the chain- link fence, others scurry out a narrow gate behind the shed. Childress weighs an amused smirk. Now out of nowhere a gangbanger lurches from the shed, buttoning his sagging Dickies and tripping over his own feet. He scrambles out the back gate and is gone. \nChildress, curiosity piqued, now enters the compound through a tear in the fence. \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                 17. \n29   INT. UTILITY SHED - MOMENTS LATER                              29 \nAs Childress pokes his head inside he discovers... \nRita Nartinez, seventeen... braless. A niobium belly- ring piercing her navel. She pulls a dark blue sweat shirt on over her head. Glances up at Childress. Masks her shame with a defiant smirk. \n(Behind the heavy eyeliner and baggy pants of a chola, Rita's really nothing more than a little lost girl.) \nTrevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers.     A startling discovery abruptly halts his search... \nCLOSER now INTO a brown paper bag Trevor has opened. Inside the bag is a .357 Magnum. \nOFF Trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice interrupts... \nCHILDRESS (O.S.) ... Can I help you? \nTrevor lifts his head to see Dave Childress standing in the doorway of the bungalow. Trevor shuts the desk drawer. You can hear a pin drop. \nChildress piston-chews a wad of gum as he approaches Trevor. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                               21. \n30   CONTINUED: (4)                                               30 \nCHILDRESS Sorry I'm late. Had to handle something. You a sub? \nTREVOR (puzzled) I thought this was Science. Ms. Eskander. \nChildress weighs a shit-eating grin as he glances at Trevor's name on the board. \nCHILDRESS No. This is Dave Childress, American History. \nSome students brave a laugh at Trevor's expense. \nCHILDRESS ... Don't know how to break it to you... (glancing at Trevor's name again) ... Garfield... but this is bungalow 84. \nChildress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds. \nCHILDRESS See, you zigged when you shoulda zagged. Course it's not your fault someone jacked the number off my door. Keep askin' Garcia to fix it but all I get is 'nada.' \nChildress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing another bungalow across the way. \n31   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - THROUGH WINDOW PANE                      31 \n... In complete disarray. Students clutter the doorway as wads of paper intermittently zing past them. \nCHILDRESS ... that mess over there, that's Eskander's. \nOFF Trevor's unflinching stare... \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                  22. \n32   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - MORNING                                     32 \nThe bungalow was originally designed for lab science: glass-encased cupboards, a caged white lab rat on a side counter, an 8' by 3' counter top (island) at the front of the room, including a built-in sink and butane gas valve. \nStudents crowd the opened windows on the far side of the room. The chaotic atmosphere centers around one student... Benny Chacon (18), the tagger we met earlier. \nTrevor's back to square one. He struggles with trepidation as he steps into the doorway of the bungalow and hesitates. \nA young black girl, LAKESIA STEWART (16), stands near the doorway. She cradles a realistic looking E.N.A.B.L. baby (Education Now And Babies Later). \nLAKESIA You our sub? \nTrevor takes a peek at the doll. \nLAKESIA It's not real. We're studying teen parenting in home-ec.' It's computerized, so it cries and shit. \nCrowd at the windows begins to disperse now, finding their seats, except for Benny who doesn't budge. Trevor approaches, gazes out the window, eyes sizing up the situation. \n33   EXT. BUNGALOW #86 - TREVOR'S POV - TEXTBOOKS                    33 \nScattered on the blacktop between the parking lot fence and bungalow #86 are 35 science textbooks. \n34   INT. BUNGALOW #86                                               34 \nTREVOR (addressing Benny; without prejudging) You know how the books got outside? \nBenny plays with the black rosary around his neck. Responds with mock ignorance. \nBENNY No speaky Engless. \n(CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:                                                         34 \nClass erupts with laughter.      A wad of paper sails past Trevor and out the window. \nBENNY You speak Spanish, Mister... Whas yer name? \nTREVOR Garfield. \nBENNY ... You speak Spanish, Mister G? (as Trevor ignores the question) Eh, G... know what dat means when a homeboy calls you 'G'? Dat means gangster, homes. You a gangster, maestro? \nTREVOR No, I'm not a gangster. (beat) Would you please do me a favor and pick up the books? \nBENNY (righteous indignation) Andate a la mierda. (more laughs) I ain't pickin' dat shit up.   You go pick it up. \nBenny now finds a seat.      Trevor follows him. \nTREVOR What's your name? \nBENNY Cesar Chavez.    Don't you recognize me? \nClass laughs. Trevor refers to the seating chart (inside the sub folder) in his hand but Benny's not sitting in his proper seat. Benny indicates a 2\" by 3\" monitoring device strapped to his ankle... \nAs they shake right in front of Childress' face he can't help noticing the mean scar on the back of Trevor's hand. \nCHILDRESS Nice scar yuh got there. \nThere's something familiar about this sub. \nCHILDRESS Ever sub here before? \nTREVOR First time. \nCHILDRESS (curiously) What about permanent? \nTREVOR I taught seven years in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Roosevelt Whitney High School. \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                35 \nCHILDRESS Roosevelt Whitney? Didn't some teacher get stabbed to death there last year? \nTREVOR Actually, he survived. \nCHILDRESS No, it was on 'Sixty Minutes.' Some gangbanger stabbed this guy with a ten-penny nail like a dozen times in a hallway and... \nChildress looks from Trevor silently stirring his soup down to the scar again... and now it hits him. \nCHILDRESS Jesus Christ, you're him.   It was you. \nEllen blanches. \nCHILDRESS (awestruck) Holy shit, Garfield. When was that? December before last? No, it was fall. \nTREVOR October 27. \nCHILDRESS Whadda schmuck. I'm sittin' here givin' advice to a man with a purple heart. \nELLEN Excuse me... \nInexplicably, she gets up and leaves. As Trevor watches Ellen go, Childress slides closer to him. \nCHILDRESS (sotto) Lemme tell yuh somethin'. In my book you're a fuckin' hero. Damn straight. \nTrevor slides a look back to Dave as he eats his soup. \nTREVOR ... Getting stabbed doesn't make me a hero. \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                35 \nCHILDRESS (disregards Trevor's comment) So what'd they give the kid? \nTREVOR They put 'im upstate in a facility until his twenty-first birthday. \nCHILDRESS That all? They shoulda caned the bastard. Like they did that kid in Singapore. Remember? (recollecting) President of Singapore had a few choice words. Use to have it memorized... He said something like, 'When a state of increasing disorder and defiance cannot be checked by the rules... then new and sometimes drastic rules have to be forged to maintain order.' (slides Trevor a glance) 'The alternative is to surrender order to chaos and anarchy.' \nTREVOR So why do you still teach? \nCHILDRESS Same reason as you, Garfield -- for the paycheck. \n36   EXT. BUNGALOW #86 - AFTERNOON (SIXTH PERIOD; NEXT DAY)           36 \nThe windows and blinds are shut now. \n37   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - CLOCK ON WALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION            37 \nis inching toward the top of the hour. \nClosing their books and loading their knapsacks, the students talk and pay more attention to the inexorable march of time than to Trevor writing on an overhead projector. \nTREVOR Okay, someone tell me the difference between the central nervous system and the lymphatic system? \n(CONTINUED) \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                   30. \n37   CONTINUED:                                                       37 \nRita Nartinez (the chola from the \"utility\" shed) sits near the front of the class. She wears her usual heavy eyeliner and a new nose ring. \nRITA (obscenely) Mr. G, you gotta nice butt. \nClass erupts. Rita enjoys the attention.        Trevor turns and looks at her squarely. \nTREVOR You seem to be an expert on anatomy, Miss -- (checks roster) -- Nartinez. Central nervous system and lymphatic system. What's the difference? \nRITA ... Uh... \nTrevor doesn't expect anything remotely close to the right answer. \nRITA It's like the central nervous system, that's your brain and spinal cord, and the lymphatic system, that's the stuff in your blood that fights diseases. \nA beat.   Trevor looks up at her. \nTREVOR Very good. \nTrevor notices Cesar Sanchez writing on his desk.      Stevie cranes his neck to observe. Paco snoozes. \nTREVOR Cesar. \nON bug zapper above garage, a churning, SLOW MOTION swarm of bugs repeatedly throw themselves headlong into the light. \n46   INT. TREVOR'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION                   46 \nMUSIC plays faintly on the STEREO. Numerous artifacts occupy the bookshelves. A primitive AFRICAN MASAI BOW (with two arrows) is mounted on a wall. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                  41. \n46   CONTINUED:                                                      46 \nTrevor, tie loosened. Ellen, in nylon stocking feet, leaning back against a couch. On the coffee table before them are dirty dishes and half-full wine glasses. Trevor's lost in a thin introspective smile. \nELLEN (breaks the silence) ... So you have a wife hiding in a closet somewhere? \nTREVOR (smile widens) No.   No wife. \nELLEN Don't you ever get lonely? \nTrevor considers the question. \nTREVOR (genuinely) Sometimes. There's this passage in God's Lonely Man by Thomas Wolfe where he says, '... The whole conviction of my life rests upon the belief that loneliness is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.' I believe that. \nELLEN God that's depressing. \nThey both laugh. \nTREVOR ... My New York mentality. (beat) It's not always easy looking on the bright side. \nELLEN Especially after spending a year in and out of a hospital, I would guess. \nA beat. \nTREVOR Actually, that wasn't the toughest part -- it's the robbery that's been hardest to recover from. \nELLEN (didn't know about this) What'd they steal?

I resent that. I want them back. \nHe offers a smile.        Ellen returns it. \nELLEN They're still there. Everybody around me seems to have given up. They're all so beaten down. But you're different. You refuse to be beaten. \nTREVOR So do you. \nKindred souls.      Ellen fills her glass. \nELLEN Remember the last time a student surprised you? \nTREVOR You mean where a light goes on? \nELLEN Yeah. Where the kid surpasses all your expectations. \nTREVOR ... Been awhile. So few you can actually get through to... You? \nELLEN (thinks) ... That would have to be Daniel Terrazas. This was last year sometime. Kid was failing miserably ... But he was the best Salsa dancer in the whole school. \nTREVOR (brightens slightly) Uh-oh. \nELLEN So I made 'im a deal. Tutoring in exchange for Salsa lessons. \nTREVOR Saw it...

He was a perfect gentleman. \nTREVOR (dryly) Male teachers can't do things like that. They get arrested. \nELLEN Yep, double standard... By the way, did you know Cesar Sanchez was Special Ed? (as Trevor shakes his head) Yep, he never should've been mainstreamed. His I.E.P. says he's L.H. but he acts more like S.E.D. \nTREVOR Severely Emotionally Disturbed... that's great. \nA beat. Then Ellen gets up, wine glass balanced in her left hand. \nELLEN Come on, Garfield -- on your feet. Lemme teach you how to Salsa. \nTREVOR (resisting) No, no, I'm no good at that. \nEllen spins the tuner on the STEREO to a LATIN STATION and practically yanks Trevor to his feet. \nELLEN Let's go.   Don't play shy with me, homeboy. \nTrevor grimaces, awkwardly relinquishes, as Ellen walks him through it. \nELLEN (still holding wine glass) That's it... Okay, follow me. It starts on the one. Step forward with your left foot... One. Change weight on, two.

Checks the wall clock. \nTREVOR Rita, bring your friend in the cage over here, please. \nBringing the cage over... \nRITA His name's Snowball. Like 'dat lil' pig dude from Animal Farm. \nTREVOR (coolly impressed) You've read Animal Farm? \nCESAR (above the din) ... schoolgirl. \nRITA (snapping a look) Shut up, Cesar. \nTREVOR You read Animal Farm, Cesar? \nCESAR No, but I fucked a sheep. \nStevie and Paco love it. \nTREVOR Cesar, come up here.

His eyes are bloodshot and vapid. \nTREVOR Why your eyes so red? \nCESAR (lying) Mus' be pink-eye, sir. \nCESAR (eyes Trevor's pocket watch) Nice watch, homes. Can I have it? \nDisregarding Cesar, Trevor opens a drawer and removes two latex surgical gloves from a cardboard box. He puts on the gloves and selects a petri dish from another drawer. \nTREVOR (pointing) Rita, would you bring me a sugar cube from the shelf over there? \nShe does. Trevor now removes a small amber bottle (with an eye-dropper top) from his briefcase. The class starts to settle down now as Trevor pre-measures water in a pipette and adds it to the petri dish. \nTREVOR (referring to text) Cesar, read Young's rule for us. Page 564. At the top. \nCESAR (like it's above him) I ain't gonna read 'dat shit. \nTREVOR Rita, give Cesar your book.

Cesar laughs. \nCESAR You like her, Mr. G? \nClass erupts. \nRITA (shrinking) Shut up! \nTREVOR (genuinely) Settle down, everyone. We all have to learn how to forgive and get along. C'mon, Cesar, read. Please. \nAt first Cesar doesn't budge.         Now grudgingly he looks down at the book... \nCESAR (attempting to read) ... Young's rule... ff... fo... \nTREVOR ...

It's... hard for me... \nA struggle, fighting against his true feelings... \nTREVOR Pretty much been like that since... you know, my accident. Has nothing to do with you. \nELLEN Is it because I'm white? \nTREVOR No. \nTrevor stares into her eyes, a soulful, searching gaze. Now he averts a self-conscious look. \nELLEN We can still be friends.   Just don't pull away. \nTrevor just looks at her.    Nods, somewhat bewildered. \nELLEN (back to lighter note) Now, can I ask you a favor? After you're done with Hyland, can you give me a ride to my car? It's at the mechanics, about five or six blocks up Lankershim. If you can't, it's okay, I can walk. \nTREVOR (a little embarrassed) ...

Hyland flashes Trevor a defeated smile as we... \nTrevor coolly deciphers the situation. \nGarcia reaches down, switches on a portable tape recorder. \nMR. GARCIA You don't mind if I tape record our conversation. Matter of record. You understand. (indicating Mr. Hyland) Of course, you know Mr. Hyland. \nTrevor weighs the situation.

For the record, I primarily suspect Mr. Sanchez. Although I wouldn't be surprised if Stevie was an accomplice. (glances over at Cesar and Stevie) Beginning of sixth period, Cesar admired the watch. I believe his exact words were, 'Can I have it?' (looks back to Garcia) Either way, I'd like my watch back. \nMR. GARCIA Anything else? \nTREVOR When I asked him to empty his pockets, Cesar refused. \nMR. GARCIA Is that true, Mr. Sanchez? \nCESAR No way. He never asked me nothin' like that! I don't go 'round taxing no teachers... \nMR. GARCIA Okay.   Calm down. \nWith fervor now, Cesar turns his pockets inside out, emptying the contents (house keys and two dollars in change) onto Garcia's desk. \nCESAR ... I ain't got no watch, man. \nMR. GARCIA Mr. Littleton, may we see your pockets too? \nStevie empties his pockets now.

Can you do that for me? \nRITA (hiccups a sob) I jus' wan'ed to thank you. \nTREVOR You don't have to thank me, I'm your teacher. \nRita opens her notebook and begins to copy the rule. She wipes at the tears with the sleeve of her baggy sweat shirt. Trevor resists the urge to comfort her. \nTREVOR ...

Crosses over to the desk and sits down. \nELLEN ... Where'd you put the aspirin? \nLike an involuntary reflex she tugs on the center drawer of the desk, but it's locked. Now she pulls on one of the side drawers and it slides open. Ellen stops at what she sees... \n... a treasure-trove of homemade shivs, Bic lighters, Walkmen, pagers... and Benny Chacon's black rosary beads. \nRain lashes the faculty parking lot... \n110   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - CONTINUOUS ACTION                          110 \nHIP-HOP TRACK FADES now replaced by the buzz of cross-talk.

Uncharacteristically, his eyes are fixed on the book in front of him. \nTREVOR (addressing class) ...

(to class) Name some more? \nNow he picks on Rita... \nTREVOR Rita. \nRITA The wrist... and thumb. \nA flurry of thumbs go up as if on cue. \nTREVOR Good. (holding up all his fingers now) ... And don't forget the phalanges. \nFingers shoot up and wiggle on cue... \nCLASS (in unison) Phalanges, phalanges, phalanges... \nScattered laughter and groans at this embarrassing routine... \nCesar's beaten gaze remains riveted to his book. Now he slides a look at the \"R-U-DUN\" tatt on his right index finger. The severed finger has been sewn back on, supported by a finger brace. \nStevie openly stares at the back of Trevor's head as Trevor passes by in the aisle. \n111   INT.

I went for a run. (changes subject) Wanna get some Chinese later? There's a new place in the Valley Center. 'Spose to be pretty good. \nELLEN (an excuse) ... Can't tonight. Maybe another time. \nWeighs it, and... \nTREVOR (stands there for a moment) ... I should probably correct papers anyway. Some of these bungalow kids actually care about a grade.

Sometimes you gotta take responsibility for your actions. Have you ever been ready to die for a fundamental principle? They haven't. You think those punks would die protecting your Civil Rights? \nELLEN Trevor, don't. \nTREVOR Did you know Cesar hits his mother? Steals money from her purse? Did you know that? \nEllen blanches. \nTREVOR Did you know he was here that night? In the alley? \nELLEN (confused) What are you talking about? \nTREVOR Cesar. Jack was provoked.

You kill my friend?   Huh? \nTrevor's head begins to swim. His life's falling apart. Like a trapped animal, he back-pedals a step to escape... but then suddenly snaps. \nHe explodes into Stevie, crushing him against the bath- room wall. \nTrevor impales Stevie with a look that says it all. \nStevie immediately shrinks.

A desire to be part of it, she moves a little closer... \n... as Cesar notices her. His head races from Stevie's news. Eyes penetrating. Now galvanized. On a rampage, he shoves his way through the crowd. \nVictor Sifuentes... on the opposite side of the patio, snapping a look, spotting Cesar moving in for the kill. With a start, Victor barks something into his walkie- talkie and squeezes his way into the Quebradita crowd... \nCesar shoves Rita to the ground. \nCESAR School girl bitch! \n(CONTINUED) \n123   CONTINUED:                                                        123 \nSTEVIE (ranting) You're a fuckin' murderer, Garfield! \nMR.

Turning to Childress... \nTREVOR (testing his patience) What is it, Dave? How can I help you? \nUnintentionally in Trevor's face... \nCHILDRESS How 'bout a ride? (taking a step back) ... The wife wouldn't let me drive my own car. Ain't that a bitch? \nChildress is pitiful. Wears a grease-stained tie with his wrinkled Hawaiian shirt and a Windbreaker. \nTREVOR (with resignation) ... You smell like beer. \nCHILDRESS I only had two. That's all. Swear ta Christ. \nRaising his palms. Surrendering.

Garage door open. \nChildress chain smokes and drinks beer as he leans against the dented fender of his '66 Lincoln Continental. Trevor nurses a Diet Coke... \nCHILDRESS ... I had the same situation 'round the time of that 'Night Stalker' thing. Remember that? Whole city was scared shitless. My wife was convinced the frickin' mailman was the 'Stalker' for about a week there. (a tubercular chuckle) Some mental giant in my 4th period starts this rumor, see. Childress is the 'Night Stalker.' Right? (chug-a-lugs) ... Idiots. Even after they caught that Ramirez jerk, I'd still hear those fucks '... They got the wrong guy. Childress is the Stalker, ese.' \nHe finishes beer.    Crumples it. \nTrevor studies him, without expression. Now he notices something stapled to the tar paper wall... \nTrevor's POV of the \"Certificate of Excellence in Teaching,\" yellowed and dogeared, hanging obliquely by one staple. \n... as Childress opens another beer. \nTREVOR (excusing himself) I better get goin'. Thanks for the soda. \nCHILDRESS Wait, wait. Hold your horses. Just hold on... \n... Finding a key in a drawer. \nCHILDRESS (a twisted grin) ... Can't leave without meetin' the kids. \nChildress unlocks a particle board cabinet against the garage wall.

Cabinet door swings wide now, revealing a mini arsenal of handguns... \nCHILDRESS Ta-dah... Huh? \nTrevor's eyes remain expressionless. \nChildress rhapsodizes as he removes and handles some of the guns... \nCHILDRESS ... This one's from Czechoslovakia. It's a C-Z .22 automatic. Ten round clip. Glow- in-the-dark sights. (eyeing the sights) Ain't that a beauty? (next) ... Then we gotta custom Smitty, 9 'milli.' With extended grip. These Smith & Wessons kick like a mutha. (and next) Now this one's special. A Glock 21. Lightest gun in the world. The barrel and firing pin are metal. See. Everything else on it's plastic. (handing it to Trevor) Here, feel that. \nTrevor takes it, reluctantly weighs it in the palm of his hand. Sets it down. \nNow Childress removes a gun from a holster in the small of his back, under his Windbreaker... \n130   CONTINUED:                                                      130 \nIn a flicker, we're transported back to Roosevelt Whitney... Dennis Broadway's image SLOWLY COMING TOWARD us down the long corridor... \nBACK TO SCENE \nTrevor catches his breath and blinks... \n... Back to reality.    The mirror is empty. \nHe removes his Proventil inhaler from his shirt pocket. Suppressing gasps, he takes two hits. \nTwo girls at the magazine racks whisper to each other, eyes firmly fixed on Trevor. \nSuddenly there's a presence at Trevor's side... \nLIBRARIAN ...

Her three-year-old baby sister, Maricella (too big to be carried) straddles her hip as Rita yells at the boys... \nRITA Be nice to your brother, Antonio. Don't make me go get Mommie. \nTrevor's car pulls up.    Rita's taken aback. \nRITA (setting Maricella down) Go play wit' your brothers. \nRita attempts to thwart him at the sidewalk. \nRITA (almost defensive) Whatcha doin' here, maestro? \n(CONTINUED) \n131   CONTINUED:                                                       131 \nTREVOR (with fervor) I want you to come back to school, Rita. You can't afford to miss finals. They won't let you graduate. \nRITA (overlapping) No way. Forget it. I can't. What's wrong wit' you. \nTrevor really does looks like hell. \nTREVOR (beseeching her) Cesar and Stevie won't bother you. That's a promise. \nSomething stirs deep inside her. \nRITA (struggles with it) Why'd they have to kill Snowball? \nTREVOR ... They didn't. \nRITA (on the verge of tears now) What's it fuckin' matter?! 'At school shit's for other kids, not me! \nTREVOR That's not true. You're so smart, Rita. Don't you know that? You have an opportunity here to change your life. Please don't throw away everything we've worked for. \nTrevor just stares at her, incredulously. \nRita lowers her gaze, unable to look him in the eye.

That boy's fulla shit. What's he been sayin'? \nTREVOR Doesn't matter. \nRITA He ain't never touched me no ways. What's he sayin'? He say he fucked me?! He say dat?! (off Trevor's look) He's a damn liar! (erupting again; tears streaming down her face) Get the fuck outta here! I don't need yer damn pity and I don't need you! \nTREVOR (genuinely) But I need you, Rita. \nBeat. \nRITA (hardening) You made a mistake.

And Paco plays with a .38 caliber revolver that he hides in the deep front pocket of is County-Bens. \nThe interior of the Buick snaps with the hard sound of gun metal... cocking hammers, loading cartridges and spinning cylinder chambers... \n... As the gun preparations systematically stop. Cesar now flicks ON an ELECTRIC HAIR CLIPPER, sets it on 'NO CLIP,' and passes it back to Paco. Paco runs the clipper over his head. Hair tumbles off in chunks. Stevie fidgets, picks up a naked one-eyed doll off the floor, raises it INTO VIEW... \nSTEVIE Where'd you jack 'dis car from, homes?

So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and some attorney tells her she doesn't have to come in. (still can't believe) Garcia got cold feet and dropped the whole thing.

Benito. \nAs she comforts Mrs. Chacon... \nELLEN (to Assistant Coroner; sotto) Did you find any rosary beads with the body? \nASSISTANT CORONER No. \n120   INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                        120 \n... The digital clock next to Trevor's bed reads: 2:14 a.m. \nTrevor sleeps. HOLD for a portentous moment. Now the stillness is broken by a CLATTER at the front door. Someone enters the house. Trevor awakens. Jolts out of bed. Disoriented a beat. \n121   INT. TREVOR'S HALLWAY                                           121 \nIn boxer shorts and a T-shirt, adjusting his glasses, Trevor ventures through darkness... \n(CONTINUED) \n121   CONTINUED:                                                     121 \nTREVOR ... Who's there? \nA light flickers on in the living room. \nELLEN (O.S.) You should keep your door locked. \nADJUSTING the ANGLE now as the living room comes INTO VIEW... \nEllen paces back and forth, consumed by what's troubling her. \nTREVOR (still half asleep) What's the matter? \nEllen ignores his question. \nELLEN (impaling him with a look) I just want you to tell me one thing... \nNow something she sees stops her pacing... \n... The black rosary beads on the dinner table. \nTREVOR (off Ellen's puzzled look) What? \nFollowing her gaze, he picks up the rosary beads.    As he places them in a drawer in the credenza. \nTREVOR What is it? \nEllen's confused.     Lost in a fixated gaze. \nELLEN ... If you had any idea what I've been thinking lately... you'd think I was crazy. (running it through her mind) ... Remember that John Doe they found in the L.A. River. Turned out it was Benny. \n(CONTINUED) \n121   CONTINUED:                                                       121 \nTREVOR (impacted) Who told you that? \nELLEN ... Benny's mother identified the body. \nTrevor just looks at her, a bated pause.       Now he blinks. \nTREVOR Benny was no saint, Ellen. This is a kid who terrorized hald the school. He even broke into your house. Maybe we should think about that 'fore we shed any tears. \nEllen just looks at him. \nTREVOR ... Maybe he's better off. \nELLEN That's a horrible thing to say. \nTrevor accepts that it is. \nTREVOR Do you believe for every troubled kid like Benny there's one or two others just waiting to take his place? Like Cesar... or his friend Stevie. \nAn awkward moment of silence... \nELLEN You don't know anything about Cesar's finger, do you, Trevor? \nTREVOR Sometimes a person just runs out of bad choices. Then he's gotta pay a price. What happened to Cesar was inevitable. \nEllen flickers a terrified smile. \nELLEN You're scaring me. \n(CONTINUED) \n121   CONTINUED:                                                       121 \nTREVOR We make choices in life and we live by 'em. You and I chose to be teachers, to stand on principle. Benny and Cesar, they're takers. They want what they want, and they want it now. \n", "test3_id": 2084}

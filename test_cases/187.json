Don't know how to break it to you... (glancing at Trevor's name again) ... Garfield... but this is bungalow 84. \nChildress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds. \nCHILDRESS See, you zigged when you shoulda zagged.

The chaotic atmosphere centers around one student... Benny Chacon (18), the tagger we met earlier. \nTrevor's back to square one. He struggles with trepidation as he steps into the doorway of the bungalow and hesitates. \nA young black girl, LAKESIA STEWART (16), stands near the doorway. She cradles a realistic looking E.N.A.B.L. baby (Education Now And Babies Later). \nLAKESIA You our sub? \nTrevor takes a peek at the doll. \nLAKESIA It's not real.

Cesar has a buzz-cut, Stevie's an Anglo speed freak with a runny nose and a bleached one-clip haircut (roots showing) and Paco, a Latino. \nTREVOR Sit down, please. \nCesar, Stevie and Paco ignore Trevor and walk out of the bungalow. Their departure is accompanied by a tumultuous outburst of catcalls and whistles. \nLAKESIA (peeking Benny's hold card) Mr. G, those guys that jus' walked out aren't even in here this period.

A palpable beat. \nTREVOR Are you done? \nThere is dead silence as Benny stares Trevor straight in the eye. Trevor stares right back. \nBENNY Jus' gimme a referral.    Shit. \nTrevor turns and calmly walks back to the island counter, searches and finds a referral slip in one of the drawers, fills it out... \nTREVOR (cool deliberation) For future reference, anyone who disrupts a class, or in any way infringes on the rights of others to get an education, is subject to disciplinary action. (beat) When I'm here, ladies and gentlemen, I expect to be treated decently... (walks back to Benny) ... hopefully in an atmosphere of mutual respect. This classroom is our sanctuary, yours and mine. Respect it. (handing Benny the referral) For your information, I am a real teacher. \nBENNY Whatever you say, Opie. \nBenny has a smirk on his face as he sashays past Trevor with the referral slip. \nTREVOR Okay, who would like to help me pick up the books? \nBenny, a self-aggrandized exit, crumbles the referral slip and tosses it at Trevor, hitting him square in the back. \nLike a reflex, Trevor whirls and ducks.

Just keeps stirring his soup ... Now notices Ellen Henry as she enters and joins the food line. \nCHILDRESS Know what I think? I think that Chacon punk's the one who opened your bungalow this morning.

This kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity Transfer -- but nobody told me until it was too late. \nA beat. \nELLEN Did you know Benny's an O.T.?... In less than a year he's been convicted of felony assault and suspended twice. I even testified against him as a character witness. Now I get to see him every day in homeroom. I'm stuck with him. Condition of his probation is that he stay in school. \nTREVOR You talk to the principal? \nELLEN Many times... Three weeks ago, Garcia calls Benny's mother in for a conference, but she refuses to show up. She's afraid they'll deport her because she's illegal. So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and some attorney tells her she doesn't have to come in. (still can't believe) Garcia got cold feet and dropped the whole thing.

Someone's been phoning me at night and hanging up... Two weeks ago, my car was broken into... And last Friday, I think he was inside my house...

Yeah, well, here's some free advice. Cover your ass. \nTrevor slides him a glance. They stop in front of Hyland's office door. He unlocks the door with a key... \nHYLAND If Garcia asks, your main purpose is to observe you, not the students. Excuse me, I mean his `clients.' \nPHONE RINGS as they enter... \n61   INT. HYLAND'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                                61 \nHYLAND Some gangbanger might think we're violating his civil rights... \nTrevor weighs it as Hyland picks up the phone... \n(CONTINUED) \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                   58. \n61   CONTINUED:                                                       61 \nHYLAND (into phone) ... Yeah? \nSignals Trevor to take a seat. \nHYLAND (into phone) Sorry, Iris. Completely forgot. \nINTERCUT Trevor as his eyes idly fix on an index card box (on Hyland's desk) labeled, \"LOCKER COMBINATIONS.\" \nHyland hangs up. \nHYLAND (to Trevor) Yuh have a minute? Wanna talk to you about our discipline committee. Gotta run up to the office real quick first. \nTrevor shifts his gaze back to Hyland. \nTREVOR Yeah, fine, go ahead.   I'll wait. \nHyland rushes out and Trevor glances back at the index box. Momentous deliberation. Now he reaches over and carefully opens the small tin box. Methodically now, he flips through the file cards until he finds Cesar Sanchez's locker combination. Trevor's eyes scanning the information on the locker combination card. LOCKER #204. Combination sequence...08-24-53. \n62   EXT. TRAFFIC SIGNAL - AFTERNOON                                  62 \nTrevor's Rambler, with Ellen in the passenger seat, stops at a large intersection. \n63   INT./EXT RAMBLER - CONTINUOUS ACTION                             63 \nELLEN ... I have to fly up there for a computer conference. \nTREVOR When's that? \nELLEN Day after tomorrow. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                              59. \n63   CONTINUED:                                                  63 \nAs Trevor gets distracted by something he sees... \nTREVOR Never been to San Francisco. \n64   EXT. RITA'S BUS STOP - TREVOR'S POV                         64 \nAt a right angle to Lankershim, down Magnolia Blvd., Rita Nartinez sits alone on a bus stop bench. \nELLEN (V.O.) Oh, you should go sometime, Trevor. I think you'd like it. Really. It's only an hour by air. Maybe five or six by car. Completely different attitude from L.A. Much more like a real city... like Chicago or New York... \nAs Ellen continues talking we see a lowered blue Nissan mini-truck (with matching shell) pull up next to the bus stop. A cholo from the utility shed hangs out the passenger window and taunts Rita. Rita immediately stands and walks back down Magnolia. \n", "test3_id": 2084}

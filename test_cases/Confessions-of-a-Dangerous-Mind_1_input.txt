Young Barris watches happily from behind the cameras. He spots, Debbie, a pretty, bland young woman with headphones and a clipboard. He sidles over to her. 
BARRIS Hi. 
DEBBIE What? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Hi! 
DEBBIE Oh. 
BARRIS I wrote this song. 
DEBBIE Oh.    Uh-huh. 
BARRIS It's number three on the pop charts. 
Barris pulls out music magazine clipping as proof. 
DEBBIE Huh. 
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Barris and Debbie are having dinner. 
BARRIS See, I believe there's a great future in television. 
DEBBIE Uh-huh. 
BARRIS So I'm going to take my royalties and create a pilot. A pilot is what they call a test tv show. 
DEBBIE I work in tv. 
BARRIS Yeah. It's gonna be a game show. I believe there's a great future in game shows. 
DEBBIE That's good. 
BARRIS Everyone loves game shows, right? 
DEBBIE I don't know. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Well, they do. 
DEBBIE That's great then. 
BARRIS I'm on my way! 
There is a long, awkward silence.    They both saw away at their steaks. 
INT. DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Barris and Debbie are having sex, sort of mechanical. They're plowing through, kind of like sawing through their steaks. When it's over, they both just lie there. 
INT. DEBBIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Young Barris, in his underwear, sits alone in the semi- darkness and stares out the window. The front door unlocks and a woman enters, backlit from the hallway. She turns on the light. This is Penny Pacino, eighteen, a beatnik in a black leotard and skirt and black mascara. She has red hair. She sees Barris on the couch. 
PENNY Hello. 
BARRIS Hi.   Don't be alarmed    I'm with Debbie. 
PENNY Yeah, I figured. 
Penny walks past him, drops her keys and bag on the counter, and enters the kitchenette. Barris watches her ass. 
PENNY (CONT'D) You hungry? 
BARRIS Um, no thanks. 
PENNY Thirsty? 
BARRIS If you have a beer. 
Penny returns with two beers, hands one to Barris.      She sits in a chair across from him. They both drink. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PENNY So how was sex with Debbie?   I've always wondered. 
BARRIS (a little taken aback) It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking. 
PENNY No problem. I just got fucked by this drummer cat. A really righteous Negro hipster.

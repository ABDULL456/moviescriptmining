INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT 
A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling on. 
THE CODEX ROOM 
Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a pocket fisherman.... 
The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down the hall. 
OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM 
Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room. He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now empty mirror-frame then REALIZES. 
Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor deflecting mirrors. 
He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to be standing. 
Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk. 
The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window on the other side of the room. 
The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of shoulders to the fainting Guard three. 
Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the shattered window. 
The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving chase. 
EXT. THE ROOF 
Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS. His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof, landing against the antennae. 
INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM 
A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it. 
EXT. THE ROOF 
Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag. 
The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a warning shot. 
Hawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the Guard continues to bound forward. 
HAWK Please God, Please God.......let the guard shoot me. 
Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican Guard hovering over him on the roof. 
VATICAN GUARD The worm's on the other foot, yankee noodle candy. 
Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof. 
EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL 
Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his breathtaking ride. 
The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down. 
HAWK 
is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream... and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost. His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails down upon... 
EXT. A BUS 
and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes flying off... 
EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT 
Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas bag. 
ANNA Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by.... 
HAWK I never break a date.  Scout's honor.

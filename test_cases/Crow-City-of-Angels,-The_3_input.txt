You go back. 
ASHE 
What if I don't want to go back? 
Sarah looks away. 
SARAH 
Then you're damned 
INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON A VIDEO MONITOR. We're watching the tape documenting Ashe's death. We see Ashe's face sinking beneath the water's surface. The image freezes. 
CURVE (O.S.) 
It was him. It was that son of a bitch we dumped off the pier. I know it. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Judah, Curve, and Kali gathered around the monitor. Sibyl waits nearby. Curve is snapping open an envelope of Trinity, sniffing up the contents. 
JUDAH 
I thought you killed him. 
CURVE 
I shot him in the head! 
KALI 
He's a ghost. 
CURVE 
No such thing as ghosts. 
KALI 
(POINTEDLY) 
Then who killed Spider Monkey and Nemo? 
Curve starts pacing, growing more apprehensive. 
CURVE 
All I know is, he's fucking with us. The Crow's his symbol, right? That means I'm marked. It means he's coming for me now! 
KALI 
I thought you said you didn't believe? 
Curve turns on Kali, furious, ready to strike her. In a flash, Kali has one of her katanas out. 
Curve backs away, bristling. 
CURVE 
Look, you want to tell yourselves some bullshit fairytales, that's your business. But i'm not gonna sit here with a fucking target on my chest. I'm going to take this motherfucker out! 
SIBYL 
You won't stop him with bullets or knives. He doesn't feel pain. He doesn't bleed. Don't you see? His soul has crossed over. He's come back from the other side. 
Curve looks like he's going to be sick from fear. But Kali and Judah are listening intently.l 
JUDAH 
So how do you stop a man who's already dead? 
SIBYL 
Can you look destiny in the eye without flinching? 
Judah studies Sibyl's shadowed face. 
JUDAH 
You tell me. 
A stare-down ensues. Judah doesn't avert his gaze. 
SIBYL 
The Crow is the source of his power - his link between this world and the next. Sever that link and he's as vulnerable as the next man.

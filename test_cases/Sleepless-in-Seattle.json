{"train": "S L E E P L E S S   I N   S E A T T L E \nby Jeff Arch Rewritten: Nora Ephron & Delia Ephron May 10, 1992 \nFADE IN: \nCLOSE ON SAM BALDWIN \nA card: Chicago. \nHe's in his thirties.  His neck is pinched into a crisp \ndress shirt and tie.  His expression is vacant, faraway. \nA breeze blows but he doesn't react to it.  In the \ndistance the architecture of the Chicago skyline. \nSAM \nMommy got sick and it happened \njust like that and there was \nnothing anybody would do. \n(continued) \nAnd pull back to reveal: \nEXT. CHICAGO - A GRAVESITE - DAY \nNext to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.  Sam's hand is on \nhis shoulder.  As the mourners go past and each takes a \nturn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave -- \nSAM \nIf we start asking why we'll go \ncrazy.  So, rule number one. \nWe don't ask why. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON ANNIE REED \nPretty, blonde, animated.  Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore \nOrioles hat. \nANNIE \nWhy? I just want to know why? \nThat's my first rule.  I always \nask why.  Come on.  Tell me. \nC'mon, c'mon, c'mon -- \nAnd pull back to reveal: \nEXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - DAY \nAnnie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy \nnamed SETH.  They're carrying packing boxes into the \nhouse they share in the Old Town section of Chicago. \nThe same stunning architecture in the b.g.  They go up \nthe back wooden staircase to the house. \nSETH \nThere's no why, Annie.  I'm \njust not up for it.  I never \nsaid I was. \nANNIE \nIs there somebody else? \nSETH \nNope. \nANNIE \nYou don't love me, is that it? \nSETH \nNope. \nFollow them into: \nINT. KITCHEN - DUSK \nAs they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to \nassemble them. \nANNIE \nHow about ... you're too \nnarcissistic to commit to \nanother human being in a long- \nterm way. \nSETH \n(agreeably) \nThat's good. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SAM'S CHICAGO TOWN HOUSE - DAY \nAn attractive, thirtyish couple, SUZY and GREG are \nstocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a \nmonths.  A number of friends and relatives talk quietly \nin the living room beyond.  Sam stands alone by a window \nthat looks into the backyard.  We can see a garden of \nflowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife. \nSUZY \nFive minutes in the microwave. \nAny one of them, five minutes \nand done.  Ready to eat.  Do \nyou know how to make juice? \nSAM \nMicrowave.  Five minutes. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE'S KITCHEN - SEVERAL DAYS LATER \nPacking boxes.  Seth is moving out. \nANNIE \nYou take the microwave? \nSETH \nWhat am I going to do with a \nmicrowave? \nANNIE \nYou turn it on, you open it and \nyou stand in front of it for a \nvery long time. \nSETH \nSo you're angry.  Big deal. \nCUT TO: \nSAM'S OFFICE - DAY \nA large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high- \nrise.  Lake Michigan out the window.  A large space with \nseveral architects consulting, drafting, etc.  Sam is at \nhis desk, working.  An older colleague, ROB, comes over \nto him.  Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind \nbut a little stuffy. \nROB \nYoung man, it's none of my \nbusiness, but maybe you should \ntalk to someone.  I myself \nhave consulted a professional. \nI used to be up tight. \nOn Sam's face.  It's hard to imagine Rob being any more \nuptight than he is.  Sam takes some business cards out \nof his shirt pocket and reads them off. \nSAM \nHypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage... \nLoss of Spouse support groups... \nSingle parent discussion nights... \nParents without partners. \n(starts riffling, angry) \nPartners without parents. \nwears a hat so he won't catch a \ncold, and I'm going to marry \nhim and have three children \nand live happily ever after. \nI mean, I am not cut out for this \nDIANE \nFor what? \nANNIE \nFor life as we know it. \nLAURIE \nJust make sure he isn't fat \nlike my Michael or you'll spend \nyour whole life worrying he's \ngoing to drop dead. \nJUDITH \nGod, you guys are so romantic. \nANNIE \nDo you know how long romance \nlasts? \n(she snaps her fingers) \nThat long. \nDIANE \nSteven still brings me flowers \nevery Friday and we've been \nmarried 10 years. \nLAURIE \n(to Diane) \nHoney, nobody wants to hear \nthat. \n(to Annie) \nHere, darling, have some Tic \nTacs. \nKissing everyone.  Annie starts toward the plane, loaded \nwith stuff. \nANNIE \nThe next time you see me I am \ngoing to be incredibly happy. \nINT. PLANE - NIGHT \nSam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the \nrunway.  He notices his father's distractedness, reaches \nover and takes his hand.  Sam comes back into focus. \nSAM \nI'm your dad.  Don't ever \nforget that.  That's rule \nnumber two. \n(beat) \nIt's you and me, kid. \nINT. PLANE - NIGHT \nAnnie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the \nrunway. \nANNIE \n(to herself) \nI guess it's just us. \nShe gulps. \nEXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - NIGHT \nThe two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for \ninstructions. \nAnd now they both start to take off.  In opposite \ndirections. \nAnd we pull back back back back as the planes take off, \none flying east, the other flying west. \nAnd further and further back as they soar into the air \nand leave the frame. \nThe night sky. \nStars twinkle. \nAnd now tilt down to see the United States.  It looks \nlike a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by \nSaul Steinberg. \nA light goes on in Baltimore. \nA light goes on in Seattle. \nThey are the only lights on the map. \nEXT. BALTIMORE SUN BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - CHRISTMAS EVE \nAs Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER \nJACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.  They're \ncarrying an armful of Christmas presents.  They're \nwalking toward the parking lot. \nWALTER \nThe short one with black hair \nis your cousin Irene -- \nANNIE \n-- who's married to -- \nWALTER \nHarold, who ran away with his \nsecretary but came back -- \nANNIE \n-- because Irene threatened to \nput the dog to sleep if he \ndidn't -- \nWALTER \nAnd your brother Tom is a \npsychology professor and is \nmarried to...Betsy -- \nANNIE \n-- who is the most competitive \nwoman in the world -- \nThey put the presents in the backs of their two cars and \npull out together. \nEXT. A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE SUBURBS - NIGHT \nChristmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in \nfront of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park \ntheir cars.  They get out assembling presents. \nWALTER \nYour Uncle Milton lost all his \nmoney in a Puerto Rican \ncondominium that went belly up, \ndon't mention the IRS or the \nFederal prison system.  Your \nmother is Barbara, your father \nis Cliff -- \nANNIE \nI hope he doesn't get out his \nslides. \nWALTER \nAm I what they had in mind? \nANNIE \nThey're going to love you. \nWALTER \n(to Lou Gehrig line) \nToday I consider myself the \nluckiest man on the face of \nthe earth. \nIRENE \nWhat are you wearing? \nANNIE \nI don't know. \nBETSY \nI wish you would wear my dress. \nI only wore it once, and you'll \nbarely have to do anything to \nit except take it in in the \nbust -- \nBARBARA \nI have something that might do \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nWalter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides \nof cloud formations in Guatemala.  In the next room \nTom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas \ncarols. \nINT. BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS \nMAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to \nburp. \nINT. ATTIC - NIGHT \nThe sound of Christmas carols from below. \nThe attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with \nher mother.  They come to a dressmakers dummy with a \nsheet over it.  Barbara removes the sheet.  A beautiful \nantique dress.  A veil sitting on top of the dummy. \nBARBARA \nThe Historical Society wanted \nthis and I never would give it \nto them -- \nANNIE \nGranny's dress.  Oh, Mom. \nBARBARA \nI notice these things are back \nin fashion.  Oh, honey. \n(tears are rolling down \nher face as she tries \nthe veil on Annie) \nHe's a lovely man, Annie. \nANNIE \nI know.  He's wonderful, isn't \nhe? \nBARBARA \nAre his folks nice? \nANNIE \nYou'll love them.  We're going \ndown to D.C.  tonight to be with \nthem Christmas morning. \nBARBARA \nHow did it happen? \nBarbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back \nof the dress and remove it from the dummy. \nANNIE \nIt's silly, really.  I mean, \nI'd seen him at the office, \nobviously I'd seen him, he's \nthe associate publisher, and \nthen one day we both ordered \nsandwiches from the same place, \nand he got my lettuce and \ntomato sandwich on whole wheat, \nwhich of course he was allergic \nto, and I got his lettuce and \ntomato on white. \nBARBARA \n(utterly without irony) \nHow amazing. \nANNIE \nIt is, isn't it? You make \nmillions of decisions that mean \nnothing and then one day you \ndecide to order takeout and it \nchanges your life. \nBARBARA \nDestiny takes a hand. \nANNIE \nOh, please.  Destiny's just \nsomething we've invented \nbecause we can't stand the fact \nthat everything that happens is \naccidental. \nBARBARA \nThen how do you explain that \nyou both ordered exactly the \nsame sandwich except for the \nbread? How many people in this \nworld like lettuce and tomato \nwithout something else like \ntuna? \nANNIE \nIt wasn't a sign.  It was a \ncoincidence. \nBarbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie \nsteps into it. \nBarbra starts to button the dress on Annie. \nBARBARA \nI was in Atlantic City with my \nfamily.  Cliff was a waiter. \nHe talked me into sneaking out \nfor a midnight walk on the \nSteel Pier.  I've probably told \nyou this a million times, but \nI don't care.  And then he held \nmy hand.  I was scared.  All \nsorts of thing were going \nthrough my head.  But after a \nwhile I forgot about them.  At \none point I looked down, at our \nhands, and I couldn't tell \nwhich fingers were mine and \nwhich were his.  And I knew. \nyou can give yourself is a call \nto me.  The number is -- \nANNIE \nGive me a break. \nAnnie changes the station. \nRADIO VOICE \nThe subject of the evening's \nmedical update is You and Your \nSpleen and our host -- \nShe flips the dial back the other way. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nOur caller is from Seattle. \nAnnie changes the station. \nRADIO VOICE \nComing up, Jingle Bells \nbackwards, sung by the New \nJersey Cape Mayettes -- \nAnnie twists the dial back the other way.  We hear a \nYOUNG BOY's voice. \nBOY'S VOICE (V.O.) \nHello, this is Jonah -- \n(there's a bleep as \nJonah says his last \nname) \nAnnie's hand lingers on the dial. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nNo last names, Jonah.  Hello \nthere, you sound younger than \nour usual callers.  How come \nyou're up so late? \nJONAH (V.O.) \nIt's not that late in Seattle. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nGot me there.  What's your \nChristmas wish, Jonah? \nJONAH (V.O.) \nIt's not for me.  It's for my \ndad.  I think he needs a new \nwife. \nAnnie shakes her head. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nYou don't like the one he was \nnow? \nJONAH (V.O.) \nHe doesn't have one now. \nThat's the problem. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nWhere's your mom? \nJONAH (V.O.) \nShe died. \nAnnie closes her eyes for a moment. \nANNIE \nI don't believe this -- \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nAs the car drives along. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nI'm sorry to hear that, Jonah. \nJONAH (V.O.) \nI've been pretty sad, but I \nthink my dad is worse. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nAnd you're worried about him. \nJONAH (V.O.) \nI'm worried about him, he's \nworried about me, I ride my \nbike to school, he follows in \nthe car, like I'm not supposed \nto know he's there.  Now it's \nChristmas, and you know what \nhappens to people at Christmas. \nANNIE \nThey lose their minds and call \ncrackpot doctors on the radio -- \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nHave you talked to your dad \nabout this? \nJONAH (V.O.) \nNo. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nWhy not? \nJONAH (V.O.) \nIt's very hard for him to talk \nabout this stuff.  It's like it \nmakes him sadder. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nYou want me to talk to him? \nANNIE \nPerfect.  Sandbag the father. \nJONAH (V.O.) \nAnd you crazy? He thinks shows \nlike this are dumb.  If you \ndidn't have an 800 number I \ncould never get away with this \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nIs he home right now? \nJONAH (V.O.) \nYeah. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nWell, I think I can help a \nlittle more if I talk to him \ndirectly. \nJONAH (V.O.) \nI don't know -- \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nI'm sure he won't be angry once \nhe realizes how concerned you \nare about him. \nJONAH (V.O.) \nOkay, but if I get yelled at, \nI'm never gonna listen to this \nshow again. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nFair enough. \nINT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nJonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the \nsomething must be missing if \nJonah feels that you're still \nunder a cloud. \nJONAH \nTell her how you don't sleep at \nnight. \nSAM \nHow do you know that? \nSam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally \ntalking to each other on the phone within their own \nhouse, but also ON THE AIR. \nJONAH \nI can hear you walking around \nsometimes.  At first I thought \nit was a robber.  Go ahead, \ntell her, Dad. \nSAM \nI don't think I have to now. \nSam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts \ntoward him, both of them holding their phone receivers. \nOn the wall in the dining area is a pine bench. \nSAM \nLook, it's almost Christmas -- \n(as the two of them sit \ndown together on the \nbench) \nA kid needs a mother -- \nHe puts an arm around Jonah. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nAs Annie listens.  She's softened considerably. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nCould it be that you need \nsomeone just as much as Jonah \ndoes? \nANNIE \nYes. \nAnnie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment. \nANNIE \nI'm losing my mind. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nAs Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nWe've been talking to -- well, \nlet's just call him Sleepless \nin Seattle, and we'll be right \nback after this break with \nlistener response, your \nresponse, to the things we've \nbeen discussing.  The number to \ncall is... \nINT. BALDWIN HOUSE \nSAM \nWhat's she talking about? \nJONAH \nThis is where other people get \nto call in and dump on what you \nsaid. \nWe hear the beginning of a commercial. \nINT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nAnnie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio \nreverie.  She goes to the counter to order some coffee. \nThere's a commercial on the radio.  The counter WAITRESS \nLORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a \nTRUCK DRIVER at a booth.  HARRIET, a short-order-cook, \nis visible through an open window to the kitchen. \nLORETTA \nI'll bet he's tall, with a cute \nbutt. \nHARRIET \nI'll bet he hasn't shaved in a \nweek.  I'll bet he stinks. \nLORETTA \nShut up, Harriet. \n(to Annie) \nWhat'll it be? \nANNIE \nCoffee, please.  Black.  To go. \nLORETTA \nMaybe I should hustle myself \nout to Seattle.  Give him a \nlittle present for New Year's \nEve. \nHARRIET \nYou can go there if you want \nbut don't open his refrigerator. \nThey don't cover anything when \nthey put it in the fridge. \nThey just stick it in and leave \nit there till it walks out by \nitself. \nLORETTA \nHarriet, ever since you \ndivorced your last husband, \nyou've been no fun.  I'm \nlooking, and this guy pops my \ntarts. \nTRUCK DRIVER \nCome on, Loretta, you're going \nto have to jump-start this guy. \nHis battery's dead.  And look \nat me.  Mister Ever-Ready. \nEvery six minutes, another \ncharge. \nLORETTA \nI'm looking for someone \nsensitive. \nANNIE \nCome on, nobody wants a guy \nwho's sensitive on the radio. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nLet's take a call before we get \nback to Sleepless.  Knoxville, \nTennessee, you're on. \nSWEET SOUTHERN VOICE \nYes, I would just like to know \nwhere I could get this man's \nhis eyes well with \ntears) \nOh babe.  I miss you so much it \nhurts. \nHe reaches out for her.  She's gone. \nAnd we hear the television set now counting down to \nmidnight in New York. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY IN BALTIMORE - NIGHT \nThe same television show counting down to midnight. \nChampagne corks popping, etc. \nAnd we see Walter and Annie. \nWALTER \nHappy New Year, darling. \nANNIE \nHappy New Year. \nThey start to dance. \nWALTER \nI was thinking, I have to go up \nto Boston for the AAP \nconvention and then visit \nWinston-Hughes about switching \nover our computers.  Why don't \nwe meet in New York for \nValentine's Day weekend? \nANNIE \nWalter, I'd love to -- \nWALTER \nWe'll stay at the Plaza -- \nANNIE \nGo for a walk in Central Park -- \nWALTER \nGo to the Symphony -- \nA beat. \nANNIE \nWe will? \n(beat) \nThe Symphony? \n(beat) \nOkay. \n(beat) \nI'll take you to the Russian \nTea Room for pelmeni. \nWALTER \nWhat is it? \nANNIE \nIt's delicious, trust me. \nWALTER \nDoes it have wheat in it? \nANNIE \nI don't think so. \nThey go on dancing.  It's one of those parties where \neveryone looks so happy and so in love.  Annie, however, \nlooks thoughtful. \nET.  MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY \nSam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward \nhis houseboat.  He's carrying a bag of groceries. \nIn the parking lot is a U.S.  MAIL TRUCK. \nEXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY \nSam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over \nhis face. \nA MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the \nfront door of the houseboat.  Jonah is signing a receipt \nfor the mail. \nJONAH \nLook at this, Dad.  They're \nall for you -- \nSam picks up an envelop and looks at it.  It's \naddressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.  Marcia \nFieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.  He's \nstunned.  As he signs the receipt: \nMAILMAN \nIf you're having trouble \nsleeping, you might want to try \ndrinking a glass of water from \nthe other side. \nJONAH \nI thought that was for hiccups. \nMAILMAN \nDoes it work for hiccups? \nJONAH \nFor hiccups, a spoonful of \nsugar, you hold it in your \nmouth for a minute. \nMAILMAN \nReally? \nThe mailman starts back toward the mail truck. \nSam and Jonah start toward the door. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nSam is in the kitchen making dinner.  Jonah is sitting \nat the table, reading the letters from the stack they \nfound by the door. \nSAM \nJust out of curiosity, how did \nthey get our address? \nJONAH \nThey called and asked for it. \n(reading) \n\"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. \nYou are the most attractive man \nI've ever laid ears on.\" \nJonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of \nrejects, opens another. \nSAM \nHow did they get our phone \nnumber? \nJONAH \nYou have to give them your \nphone number or they won't let \nyou go on the air. \nSam nods as if this makes perfect sense. \nJONAH \n(continues, reading) \n\"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I \nam an SWF\"-- \n(to Sam) \ndown. \nPast a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles. \nPast another sign: Your nerves are shot. \nAnd another: Your feet are cold. \nAnd another: Will you find love. \nAnd another: Before you're cold? \nAnd another: Burma Shave. \nAnd Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running \nacross a map of the United States -- it's a little like \nthe one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's \nlike the famous map of the United States by Saul \nSteinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one \nis about Seattle. \nIn the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two \nindistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.  They start \nto wave at her, very slowly. \nAnnie's eyes widen. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnnie in bed, eyes open.  Walter fast asleep. \nShe gets out of bed, puts on her robe (just as she did \nin the dream sequence). \nINT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nAs Annie comes down the stairs. \nINT.

She sits back down with her corn \nflakes. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) \nUp next, \"You and Your \nEmotions\" with Dr.  Marcia \nFieldstone, clinical \npsychologist and the best \nfriend you never had. \n(the teaser continues) \nWOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) \nHe says he doesn't love me any \nmore. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nWhy do you want to be with \nsomeone who doesn't love you? \nANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.) \nEvery time I come close to \norgasm he stops and goes to \nmake himself a sandwich -- \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nWhy don't you make him a \nsandwich beforehand? \nSAM'S VOICE (V.O.) \nWhen I met my wife, it was so \nclear.  I jus knew. \nAnnie starts at hearing Sam's voice. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nWhat was it that made you know? \nSAM'S VOICE (V.O.) \nI don't think I could really \ndescribe it. \nDR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) \nWhy not? \nSAM'S VOICE (V.O.) \nAnd if I could describe it, it \nprobably wouldn't be on a radio \nshow. \n(he laughs to himself) \nBut what the hell.  It's not \none specific thing.  It's more \nof a feeling. \n(continuing) \nYou touch her for the first \ntime, and suddenly... you're \nhome.  It's almost like... \nmagic. \nAnnie closes her eyes. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) \nWe'll be back after this \ncommercial with Dr. Marcia \nFieldstone. \nEXT. BALTIMORE - PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY \nWe see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the \nPeabody Library.  Annie gets out of the car. \nINT.

We barely has time to look up. \nANNIE \nI think I'm going crazy, Tom. \nI really do.  Are you happily \nmarried? \nTOM \n(completely panicked by \nthe question) \nWhat? \nANNIE \nI mean, why did you get \nmarried? Was it all fireworks \nand trumpets and -- \nTOM \n(regaining composure) \nI got married because Betsy \nsaid we had to break up or get \nmarried.  So we get married. \nANNIE \nBut when you met her, did you \nbelieve she was the only person \nfor you? That in some mystical, \ncosmic way, it was fated? \nYou're worried we're going to \nbe all right.  We're going to \nbe all right. \n(Sam gives Jonah a \nsqueeze) \nI remember sometimes you'd have \nnightmares as a baby.  Your mom \nwould hold you and rock you and \nsing you a song. \nJONAH \nBye bye blackbird. \nSAM \nIs that what she used to sing? \nJONAH \nI miss her. \n(beat) \nWhat do you think happens to \nsomeone after they die? \nSAM \nI don't know. \nJONAH \nLike do you believe in heaven? \nSAM \nI never did.  Or the whole idea \nof an afterlife.  But I don't \nknow any more.  I have these \ndreams about... your mom... and \nwe have long talks about... \nabout you, and how you are, \nwhich she sort of knows but I \ntell her anyway.  So what is \nthat? It's sort of an afterlife, \nisn't it? \nJONAH \nI'm starting to forget her. \nSAM \nI know.  But she's here, Jonah. \nBecause I have you.  And as \nlong as I have you, I have your \nMom. \nHold on the two of them as music begins.  Bye Bye \nBlackbird. \nSAM \nI... uh... have a date with \nsomeone Friday night. \nJONAH \nGood. \nA beat. \nSAM \nDid I ever tell you about the \ntime I ate a dog biscuit? \nAs Jonah cuddles closer MUSIC COMES UP AS WE PULL BACK \nFROM THE BED AND... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

I know you're not \nsupposed to, but Laurie said \nyou might, and I'll plug the \nshow and everything -- \n(she winces in \nanticipation of a \nrejection, but then \nher face relaxes) \nCUT TO: \nAnnie dialing Sam's telephone number. \nJONAH (ON MACHINE) \nThis is Jonah Baldwin, we're \nnot in right now but you can \nleave -- \nAnnie hangs up. \nANNIE \nBaldwin. \nCUT TO: \nAnnie at her computer modem.  She's dialing a number. \n(husky voice) \nAbout two weeks. \nSam is coming down the stairs. \nCLARISE \n(to Jonah) \nPssst! \nJonah hits the remote control and the channel changes to \nthe Disney channel as Sam comes into the room, dressed \nfor his date. \nSAM \nClarise, I'll be back by \nmidnight I'm sure -- \nCLARISE \nWhenever. \nSam tosses Jonah a letter. \nSAM \nThis one's for both of us. \nJONAH \n(reading from the \nenvelope) \nSleepless and Son. \n(reading the postmark) \nBaltimore. \nHe starts to open the letter. \nSAM \nI left the number of the \nrestaurant I'll be at if \nthere's any emergency. \nCLARISE \nFine. \nSAM \n(to Jonah) \nHow do I look? \nJONAH \n(absently) \nGreat. \nSAM \n(looks in mirror) \nI look stupid.  I look stupid, \ndon't I? I look like I'm \ntrying too hard.  I was going \nto get a haircut but then I \nthought I'd look like I just \ngot a haircut. \n(checks his teeth, \npeers up his nose) \nJONAH \n(reading the letters) \nThis is a good letter, Dad. \nSAM \n(checks his fly, looks \ndown at his feet) \nThe heels on these shoes are \nvery large.  Why have I never \nnoticed this? The heels on \nthese shoes are grotesque. \nJONAH \nHer name is Annie.  Annie Reed. \nSAM \nNow I'm late.  Bye. \nHe starts toward the door. \nJONAH \nListen to this -- \nSAM \nNot now, Jonah -- \nJONAH \nJust this one part, okay? \n(reading) \n\"I have been an excellent \nthird-baseman for as long as I \nor anyone else can remember, \nand I guarantee you will not \nget one past me\" \nSAM \nJonah, I'm leaving -- \nJONAH \nWAIT!!! \n(Sam stops, amazed at \nJonah's vehemence; \nJonah continues \nreading) \n-- \"and while we're on the \nsubject, let's just say right \nnow that Brooks Robinson was \nthe best third baseman ever. \nIt's important that you agree \nwith me on that because I'm \nfrom Baltimore.\"  Dad, she \nthinks Brooks Robinson is the \ngreatest. \nSam goes out the door with Jonah behind him, waving the \nletter. \nEXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nJONAH \nDad! \nSAM \nEveryone thinks Brooks Robinson \nis the greatest. \nJONAH \nIt's a sign. \nSAM \nOh, right. \nSam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back \ninto the house. \nSAM \nCome here.  I want to show you \nsomething. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nAs Sam pulls down the map of the United States, which is \nhanging over one of the kitchen windows and stands Jonah \nin front of it. \nSAM \nHere is Seattle. \n(moves his finger \nacross the country) \nAnd here is Baltimore.  Case \nthat piece of information. \nWHEEDLE \nNo, that's free.  He's an \narchitect.  Used to do big \nhigh-profile projects.  He \nscaled it all back when his \nwife died.  Now he remodels \npeople's homes.  He works in \na small firm, makes a good \nliving. \nHe shows her a good picture of him. \nANNIE \nHe's real. \nShe goes to the next shot.  Sees a picture of Sam and \nVictoria in the restaurant, although all we see of \nVictoria is her back and mane of blond hair. \nHold on Annie's face. \nINT. SEATTLE MARKETPLACE \nWith its stalls of king crab, but otherwise almost \nidentical in design to the Baltimore marketplace. \nSam and Jonah walk past the fish stand, Sam looking \naround, slightly distracted. \nJONAH \nI figure we could go to New \nYork, catch the Knicks, and \nsince we'd be there anyway, \nobviously we'd go to the Empire \nState Building -- \nSAM \nThere she is. \nAs Victoria comes toward them, with a bag full of \ngroceries. \nJONAH \nWhy is she bringing that bag? \nSAM \nShe's going to cook something \nfor us? \nVICTORIA \nHi, Sam.  And let me guess -- \nyou must be Jonah. \nJONAH \nHi. \n(back to the subject) \nHe should book now because we \ncan get an excursion fare. \nJessica's parents are travel \nagents and -- \nSAM \nNot now, Jonah. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - LATER \nSam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table, \nfinishing the dinner that Victoria cooked. \nSAM \nWe can't finish the job.  She's \non her sixth painter, now she's \nthinking maybe she wants the \nfireplace rebricked -- \nVICTORIA \nI know her pretty well.  Maybe \nI could call her -- \nSAM \nI've already solved it.  I've \nhired a hit man. \nVictoria laughs a little too hard. \nVICTORIA \nOh that is so funny, you are so \nfunny. \nSam smiles.  Jonah is appalled. \nSAM \nEvery time she wants to change \nsomething, she talks in this \nlittle baby voice -- \n(in a little baby \nvoice) \n\"Couldn't you just move the \nstairway a teeny tiny bit?\"-- \nVictoria almost dies laughing.  Jonah's eyes narrow to \nslits. \nJONAH \nDo you like baseball? \nVICTORIA \nYes, I do.  In fact, my firm has \nbox seats for the Mariners. \nWhy don't we all go next week? \nJONAH \nWhat about camping? \nVICTORIA \nWhat about it? \nJONAH \nDo you like it? \nVICTORIA \nI went camping once. \n(to Sam) \nI love to brush my teeth in a \nbrook and floss with a weed. \nJONAH \nWe ought to start camping \nagain, Dad. \nSAM \nOkay, tiger.  Time for bed. \nJONAH \nIt's only ten o'clock. \nSAM \n(a little edgy) \nJonah! \nJONAH \nOkay. \nSAM \nThank Victoria for dinner. \nJONAH \nThanks for dinner.  I never saw \nanybody cook potatoes that way. \nSAM \n(gracious) \nI'm glad you liked it.  Good \nnight, Jonah. \nwork. \n(she hangs up, turns \noff radio) \nWalter, you scared me.  Don't \never do that again. \nINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT \nAs Sam holds Jonah by the shoulders. \nSAM \nDon't ever do that again. \nJONAH \nI thought I saw a black widow \nspider. \nSam looks at Victoria, shrugs.  Back to Jonah. \nSAM \nWhat are you doing up? \nJONAH \nI was thirsty. \nSAM \nThere's a bathroom upstairs. \nJONAH \nThe water tastes better in the \nkitchen. \nSAM \nThat's true.  Why is that? \nINT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAs she and Walter go upstairs to bed. \nANNIE \nBecky heard this woman on the \nradio complaining about this \nguy she was sure was Rick, \nwhich meant he was cheating on \nher.  She was completely \nhysterical.  Then it turned out \nthe woman lived in Duluth. \nWALTER \nThat doesn't make any sense. \nANNIE \nI know.  It makes no sense at \nall.  Thank God my life is in \nplace. \nINT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWalter asleep.  Annie stares up at the ceiling, wide \nawake.  Thinking. \nINT.

She's sitting \nat a computer in their travel agency, which is on the \nentrance level to a charming Seattle townhouse.  Jonah \nsitting there. \nJESSICA \nWrite her. \nJONAH \nYou think so? \nJESSICA \nIt's Y. O. H. \nJONAH \n(agreeing) \nYeah. \n(a beat) \nWhat's that? \nJESSICA \nYour only hope. \nINT. NEWSROOM - DAY \nAnnie, at her computer, talking to Becky. \nANNIE \nI thought I would look into \ndoing a story about those radio \nshows. \nBECKY \n(nods; after a beat) \nYou'd probably have to go \nsomewhere to really look into \nit. \nANNIE \nDefinitely. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER \nJonah and Jessica at the mailbox.  As Jonah opens the \nmailbox and drops the letter in, we hear a SQUEAL OF \nBRAKES.  It's Sam's car. \nSAM \n(angry) \nGet in the car right this \nminute. \nJonah, about to get in, looks at Jessica. \nJESSICA \nI'll call you later. \nJonah gets in. \nINT. SAM'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nSAM \nDid you call that radio station \nagain? \nJONAH \nNo. \nSAM \nEveryone at work heard you. \nJONAH \nI just called for a second. \nSAM \nLong enough to call Victoria a \nho. \nJONAH \nIt's a short word. \nSAM \nThis is not a joke.  Thank God \nVictoria doesn't know.  It \nwould really have hurt her \nfeelings. \nJONAH \n(really getting into \nit) \nIf she knew, she'd never \nforgive me.  It would be \nhopeless for the two of you. \nEXT. SEATTLE STREET - CONTINUOUS \nI'm never going to meet anyone \nwho's going to measure up to \nyour mom in your eyes? What do \nyou think? There's a perfect \nwoman walking around out there? \nAt that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next \nto the one Victoria went into and comes toward us. \nSAM \nThere's no such thing as a \nperf -- \nSam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by \nher looks, her fluidity, her poise. \nAnnie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches \nfrom him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit. \nSam continues to stare at her. \nSAM \n(to himself, referring \nto Annie) \nGod, she's beautiful. \nJONAH \n(unaware he's talking \nabout Annie) \nVictoria? She's okay. \nSam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to \nlose sight of Annie. \nJONAH \nDad, I was talking to Jessica \nabout reincarnation, and she \nthinks that probably you knew \nAnnie in another life. \nSAM \n(completely distracted) \nWho is Annie? \nJONAH \nThe one who wrote us. \nSam is preoccupied with Annie.  She takes a turn that he \ndoesn't expect.  He's having trouble keeping up, because \nhe has to wait for Jonah. \nJONAH \n(continuing) \nBut Jessica says you and Annie \nnever got together in that \nlife, and your hearts are like \npuzzles with parts out of them \nand when you get together the \npuzzle's complete. \nHe's lost Annie in the crowd.  She's nowhere in sight. \nSAM \nGod dammit. \nA beat, then Sam heads off to the exit.  Jonah follows. \nAs they walk into the distance -- \nJONAH \nThe reason I know this and you \ndon't is that I'm younger and \npurer so I'm more in touch with \ncosmic forces. \nSAM \nI sincerely hope you are not \ngoing to marry Jessica. \nEXT. AIRPORT CAR RENTAL AGENCY - DAY \nAs the shuttle bus drops Annie off at a rental car.  As \nshe gets in and starts the car. \nEXT/INT.

She looks \ninto the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in \ntheir van, anxious for her to move so they can pull into \ntheir driveway. \nRecognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and \nspeeds away, tires squealing. \nEXT. SEATTLE GAS STATION - DAY \nAnnie's car is parked just outside the rest room. \nINT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - DAY \nAnnie's in the Ladies' Room, splashing some water on her \nface.  She towels it off and looks into the mirror. \nANNIE \n(practicing) \nHello, Mr.  Baldwin?

Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious \nthan she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam \nand hugs them both. \nON SAM, JONAH AND SUZY. \nSAM \nGod, it's wonderful to see you. \nWhere's Greg? \nSUZY \nHe's over at the boat show. \nHe'll be by later. \n(she looks around) \nIt's so beautiful here. \nANNIE \nThere is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about \nthis homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the \nmiddle of the street.  A car HORN blares at her... all \nshe can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded. \nShe starts to back away -- and that's when she sees -- \nA TAXICAB \ncoming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING. \nAnnie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van \nbearing down from the opposite direction.  She steps \nback to the middle line. \nThe cab goes into a skid.  Annie freezes. \nSam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on. \nThe cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA. \nAnnie screams. \nThe cab stops inches from her body.  The van in the \nother oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well. \nON SAM \nresponding.  He runs from the gate toward the near- \naccident. \nON THE CAB DRIVER \ngetting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the \nsidewalk. \nDRIVER \nLady, what the hell are you \ndoing? \nAnnie, still in shock from her brush with disaster, \nhears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.  Stunned, she \nturns to see Sam on the other side of the street.  Their \neyes meet.  Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw \nin the airport. \nSAM \nHello. \nANNIE \nHello. \nAnnie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything \nthat's happened, bolts for her car. \nSam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is \ncoming past and he can't cross the street.  Annie gets \ninto her car, starts and pulls away.  Sam stands there, \ndeflated. \nEXT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT ACROSS THE U.S. - DAY \nANNIE (V.O.) \nHow could I have been such an \nidiot? \nEXT.

She looked just \nlike this -- \nThey met at the Empire State \nBuilding, only they didn't. \nNever mind. \nGREG \nWhat kind of person would write \nto someone they heard on the \nradio? \nSAM \nI got hundreds of letters from \nwomen all over the country -- \nGREG \nDesperate women -- \nSUZY \nJust because someone's looking \nfor a nice guy doesn't make \nthem desperate. \nGREG \nHow about rapacious and love- \nstarved? \nSUZY \nNo. \nGREG \nIt is easier to be killed by a \nterrorist -- \nSUZY \nIt is not -- \nGREG \nRight, right. \nSuzy's irritated. \nSAM \nAnyway, Victoria's nice. \nSUZY \nWould you follow her through an \nairport? \nSAM \nLook, I met somebody.

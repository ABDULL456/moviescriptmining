I never \nsaid I was. \nANNIE \nIs there somebody else? \nSETH \nNope. \nANNIE \nYou don't love me, is that it? \nSETH \nNope. \nFollow them into: \nINT.

Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind \nbut a little stuffy. \nROB \nYoung man, it's none of my \nbusiness, but maybe you should \ntalk to someone.  I myself \nhave consulted a professional. \nI used to be up tight. \nOn Sam's face.  It's hard to imagine Rob being any more \nuptight than he is.  Sam takes some business cards out \nof his shirt pocket and reads them off. \nSAM \nHypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage... \nLoss of Spouse support groups... \nSingle parent discussion nights... \nParents without partners. \n(starts riffling, angry) \nPartners without parents. \n", "test1_true": "who go into the woods, beat \ndrums and bond.

She wipes a tear from her face. \nANNIE \nOh, Walter.  I don't deserve \nyou. \nWALTER \nI think that's what I'm saying. \nSlowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off \nher finger and hands it to Walter. \nNo bitterness here.  Both of them trying to be gentle \nwith each other. \nANNIE \nYou okay? \nWALTER \nYes. \n(beat) \nSome people will do anything to \nget out of going to a symphony. \nThis breaks the tension.

Empty. \nAnnie slowly walks out. \nANNIE \nCan I take a minute? \nELEVATOR MAN \nGo ahead. \nShe sighs.  Heads for the telescopes.  Looks out at the \ntwinkling lights below. \nShe casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees \nsomething on the floor. \nJonah's Seattle Mariners backpack. \nShe picks it up.  She realizes that it might be... \ncould be... and opens it.  Inside is a toothbrush and \nJonah's teddy bear.  As she takes out the bear the other \nelevator DINGS. \nAnnie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator. \nJONAH \nI left it near the... \nAnd they stop.  There she is.  There they are.

No one knows what to do \nnext.  Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS \nHIS THROAT. \nSAM \nWe better go. \nAnnie nods. \nSam holds out his hand. \nSAM \nShall we? \nAnnie slips her hand into his.

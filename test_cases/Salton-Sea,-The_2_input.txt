DANNY My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a trumpet player. 
Danny smiles. 
VOICE (O.S.) Nah, you're Danny Flynne. 
He turns. 
COLETTE and QUINCEY standing there.  Quincey holds a nine millimeter with a muzzle suppressor. 
QUINCEY You're a motherfucking rat. 
He shoots Danny in the stomach.  Danny slumps to the floor.  His cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed. 
Colette freaks. 
COLETTE You said you wouldn't kill him! 
She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her. 
COLETTE You lied to me! 
QUINCEY Oops.  My bad. 
Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white shirt. 
DANNY Colette, what happened?  Didn't the cops ... 
QUINCEY The cops came.  But they didn't find nothing.  Turns out their C.I. game 'em some bad information. 
Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs. 
Danny looks from Quincey to Colette.  Colette looks away. 
QUINCEY (cont'd) You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this is what you get, homes. 
UNDER THE BED - the cigarette smoldering on the carpet. 
QUINCEY (cont'd) Domingo thought you might be the one who went rat on him. 
Quincey looks at Colette 
QUINCEY (cont'd) So I brought in a rat of my own. 
Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded. 
DANNY You set me up? 
QUINCEY Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo. 
Danny can't help from laughing at the irony.  Beads of sweat are forming on his blanched face.  He looks at Colette with a wry smile. 
DANNY You're good, princess. I'll give you that. 
COLETTE Danny, it's not what you think. 
Danny looks down at his bloody stomach. 
COLETTE I owed them money ... a lot of money ... they didn't give me a choice.  You know how it works.  When I got to know you, I tried to back out ... that's when they did this ... (she indicates the bruises) But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I didn't want to see you get hurt. 
Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe.  He looks over at Quincey. 
DANNY She selling me a bill, home boy? 
Quincey shakes his head. 
QUINCEY Nah, she ain't lying.  She took a pretty good beating from you, ace. I seen grown men crack after a lot less.  But not this bitch. (beat) It was very touching. 
DANNY Then why are we here? 
COLETTE They threatened to kill my daughter. (beat) I had no choice. (beat) I'm sorry, Danny. 
Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have taken. 
DANNY It's okay. It's okay. (Danny touches her face.) (beat) God damn, you're beautiful. 
UNDER THE BED - THE CARPET IGNITES.  The fire spreads quickly. 
QUINCEY Jesus. 
Quincey grabs her arm. 
QUINCEY (cont'd) Let's go. 
COLETTE No! 
The drapes go up in flames.  Quincey puts the gun to the back of her head. 
QUINCEY You wanna die here with him or come with me? 
DANNY Colette, go. 
COLETTE I don't want to leave you. 
DANNY Your daughter needs you.  Go. 
The fire continues to spread.  Colette kisses Danny on the lips. Quincey pulls her away. 
Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, cutting off any escape.

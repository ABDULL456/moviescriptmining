Fisher can't take it anymore... 
Tina relents... moves on... 
Michael reaches for her leg like a dog in heat. 
She passes over him, teasing, tormenting him, and settles onto Adam's lap. 
The guys roar in approval... Michael glowers... 
Adam turns bright red as Tina arouses and rides him... 
Michael starts to burn... 
The guys egg Tina on, she gets off on Adam's shyness, rubs her breasts in his face... 
The guys are howling... 
Tina sucks one of Adam's fingers into her mouth... 
Michael looks like he's going to explode... 
Adam's overwhelmed, he politely bails out... 
BOYD (whispers to Fish) She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party. 
FISHER I can't. 
MICHAEL (jumps up) I'll take a ride. 
FISHER Go for it. 
MICHAEL (to Tina) Come on. 
TINA (to Boyd) You said just dancing. 
BOYD (re: money) I'll take good care of you. 
TINA (dead flat; re: Michael) With him. (beat) Lucky me. 
Michael moves in on Tina. Hesitantly, she leads him into the master bedroom. 
MOORE She's fucking hot! 
ADAM I need a drink. 
BOYD Tequila... 
Boyd reaches for the bottle as the beat goes on. 
HOTEL SUIT - MONTAGE 
Distorted, a bit crooked. MUSIC and DIALOGUE constantly changing levels. We're not sure who's saying what. We're not sure of physical geography. The one thing we are sure of is that MICHAEL is fucking the hell out of Tina in the bathroom. 
SERIES OF SHOTS: 
MASTER BATHROOM: 
Michael works Tina from behind. 
SUITE: 
MOORE bouncing off the furniture. 
FISHER and ADAM, wildly high. 
BOYD sprays beer on Adam, who returns fire. Drunk they start wrestling, throwing each other around the room, knocking over furniture. 
BATHROOM: 
Michael, tightly, ties Tina's hands behind her back with her rubber hose. 
TINA Oh come on. 
MICHAEL I want to play. 
TINA It's gonna cost extra. 
MICHAEL I will pay. 
SUITE: 
Fisher spraying beer all over Adam and Boyd as they knock a table over and end up tangled and brawling on the floor.

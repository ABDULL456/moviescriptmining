GUMMY Fletch? 
FLETCH Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk. 
GUMMY What? 
FLETCH Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum. 
Gummy lies back down. 
GUMMY Why are they after you? 
FLETCH Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy. 
Gummy sits up. 
FLETCH Sit back down. 
Gummy lies down again. 
FLETCH Fat Sam is turning state's evidence. 
GUMMY What's that? 
FLETCH He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling. 
GUMMY I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam. 
FLETCH Sure you did. 
GUMMY Fletch, I never sold nothing. 
FLETCH Twenty years. 
Fletch gets up and adjusts his flowing robes. 
FLETCH Can't do a thing with this robe. One more question, Gum...don't look at me. 
Gummy lies back down. 
FLETCH Where does the Chief get the drugs? 
GUMMY I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget. 
FLETCH Rio de Janeiro, maybe? 
GUMMY Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil? 
FLETCH That's Brazil. 
GUMMY Yeah. Maybe. 
FLETCH Wait here for me, Gummy. 
Gummy looks questioningly at him. 
FLETCH It's the only way you'll be safe. Believe me. 
Fletch crosses the sand, heads for "Fat Sam's". 
238 "FAT SAM'S" 
Sam is reading the National Review. He looks up, sees Fletch approaching, and grins. 
FAT SAM Jesus. 
FLETCH You don't know me. 
FAT SAM (smiling) My pleasure. 
FLETCH I'm serious, Sam. 
FAT SAM What, the heat here? 
FLETCH Affirmative. 
FAT SAM The two surfer boys? 
FLETCH Affirmative.

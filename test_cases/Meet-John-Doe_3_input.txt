MAN 
(reading) 
"Federal investigation urged by Chamber of Commerce." 
Med. shot: Speaker's platform. SOURPUSS and BERT, reading paper. 
SOURPUSS 
How could he be a fake? 
(laughing) 
BERT 
It must be some kind of a gag. 
SOURPUSS 
A what? 
BERT 
A gag. A gag! 
Ext. : Somewhere inside ball park: Long shot: We hear the shrieking of sirens and almost immediately a limousine, escorted by Sheldon's motorcycle troops, pulls up. Directly behind it is a string of cars. 
Med. shot: The door of the limousine flies open and D. B. comes out. He immediately heads for the platform. 
Camera pans over and we see troopers pouring out of the cars with TED SHELDON directing them. 
TED 
Come on, come on, step on it! Step on it! Step on it! You all know your places now, so let's get going! Wait for the signal! 
Med. shot: DRUNK with a balloon. He holds balloon up to TED, getting in TED's way. 
DRUNK 
Hey, mister, will you autograph my balloon? 
TED 
Sure! 
(and breaks balloon) 
TROOPER 
(pushing drunk aside) 
Gangway! 
Ext.: Park. Med. shot: At Speaker's platform. JOHN is in front of the microphone trying to make himself heard over thousands of voices, all speaking at once. 
JOHN 
Ladies and gentlemen! This is exactly what I came down here to tell you about tonight. Please, if you'll all just be quiet for a few minutes I can explain this whole thing to you. As you all know, this paper is published by a man by the name of D. B. Norton . . . 
Med. shot: Shooting towards audience. Down an aisle stalks D. B., his hand waving in the air. 
D. B. 
(shouting) 
Don't listen to that man! He's a fake! 
Camera pans with him as he hurries down the aisle to the platformall eyes turned toward him. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. As he stares at D. B. approaching, too flustered to know what to do. 
Med. shot: Toward platform. As D. B. runs up the few steps and proceeds to the microphone, troopers clearing the way for him. 
TROOPER 
(drags John from mike) 
Stand back! 
D. B. 
Wait a minute! Everybody wait a minute! Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen! My name is D. B. Norton . . . you all know me! I accuse this man of being a faker! We've been taken for a lot of suckers! And I'm the biggest of the lot! 
I spent a fortune backing this man in what I believed to be a sincere and worthy cause, just as you all did! And now I find out it's nothing but a cheap racket! Cooked up by him and two of my employees for the sole purpose of collecting dues from John Does all over the country! 
JOHN breaks away from the troopers and gets to the mike. 
JOHN 
That's a lie! 
D. B. 
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there! 
JOHN 
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . . 
D. B. 
(overlapping above speech) 
Let go of me! This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so! 
(turning to John) 
Do you deny that? 
JOHN 
That's got nothing to do with it! 
D. B. 
Were you paid for itor weren't you? 
JOHN 
Yes! I was paid! But the 
D. B. 
(over-lapping above speech) 
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either! 
JOHN 
What difference does that make? 
D. B. 
Did you write itor didn't you? 
JOHN 
No, I didn't write it, but 
D. B. 
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it! 
JOHN 
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started 
D. B. 
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it! 
He leaves the platformfollowed by his troopers. 
Several shots: Of groups as they stare at JOHN, silent and stunned, waiting for him to speak. 
Full shot: The whole park full of people wait in breathless anticipation. From somewhere in the distance we hear a single voice of a man. 
VOICE 
Speak up, John! We believe you! 
Med. shot: Under the platform. We see several of D. B.'s troopers pulling at the cables of the public address system. 
Close shot: Of JOHN. He speaks into the microphone. 
JOHN 
Please listen, folks! Now that he's through shooting off his face, I've got a couple of things to tell you about 
Close shot: Under the platform. One of the troopers disconnects the public address system by cutting the cable. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He realizes the loud speaker is dead, and looks around helplessly. 
Med. shot: Somewhere in audience TED SHELDON directs troopers.

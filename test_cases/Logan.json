{"test1_input": "The MOTEL MANAGER flees to her office. \nGABRIELA (panicked, terrified) Don't let her call anyone. They will find us. They will kill us. \nINT. LIBERTY MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT \nLogan helps Gabriela to the bed. He takes in the mess of files, print outs, clippings, toys. He notices a medical kit. Cracks it open, fully stocked, looks at Gabriela. \nGABRIELA I`m a nurse. (THEN) Was. In Mexico City. \nLogan watches as Gabriela lifts her sleeve, takes things from the kit, ministering to her wound. \nLOGAN When did that happen? \nGABRIELA This morning. Near the border. I got away from them. But they know my car now. \nShe reaches for the NIGHT STAND, pries open its cheap side paneling, and pulls out a bloody envelope hidden there. Hands it to Logan. There's an address on the outside and a set of numbers beneath it. Inside, bundles of greenbacks. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                21. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) Take it. Please. Bring us to this address. It's twenty thousand. You can have thirty more when we get there. My friends will-- \nLOGAN Where did you get this? \nGABRIELA It doesn't matter. \nLOGAN Does to me. \nGABRIELA My boyfriend. He wants to kill me. And take her. \nHe eyes the girl standing in the door. \nLOGAN That's your daughter? \nGabriela and the girl exchange looks. \nGABRIELA ...yes. (QUIETLY) He wants to hurt her. (takes Logan's hand) I know you are still good inside. I know you want to help. (looks in his eyes) Please. There won't be any problems. Not if we leave now. \nLOGAN I can't leave right now. \nGABRIELA We have to be there Friday. \nLOGAN Or what? \nGABRIELA Or we miss our chance. To cross. (a coughing fit, then) Our... family. They will be there that day. No other day. \nLogan glances at the girl and back to Gabriela. The money in his hand. Enough to buy the boat. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   22. \nLOGAN I can get you there Friday. But I need to go home first, take care of some things. \nGABRIELA Bring us with you. Please. We can help with whatever you need to do. \nLogan moves to the door. Gabriela sobs, closes her eyes. \nLOGAN I'll be back in a few hours. (looks at the girl) Keep this locked. And tell your mommy I know she's lying. \nLogan exits and we move CLOSE ON-- THE GIRL. She crosses to the window, looking out like a sentinel, as Logan's limo drives away. \nEXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT -- NIGHT \nLogan pulls in. The trunk pops open and Logan walks around and grabs several bags from the back. Then slams it closed. \nINT. SMELTING PLANT -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nAs Caliban goes through all of the GROCERIES Logan has brought. Steaks. Ice Cream. Cereal. Bourbon. \nCALIBAN Tell me you didn't rob a bank. \nLogan tosses him a white paper bag. Caliban looks inside-- it's stuffed full of meds. \nCALIBAN (CONT'D) So you did rob a bank. \nLOGAN I got a job that's gonna pay enough to change things. But I have to go away. For a week. \nCaliban takes this in, watches as Logan opens a Tequila bottle and continue out the door. \nEXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT -- NIGHT \nCaliban pokes his head out into the desert night, watching Logan heading toward Charles' tank. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                23. \nINT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK -- MOMENTS LATER \nLogan finishes giving Charles his pills, lays him down on his bed. Charles is a bit dazed. Logan's phone buzzes. He pops on his new eyeglasses, looks down at it. \nTHE TEXT READS -- \"Please hurry.\" \nCHARLES I like those. They make you look younger. \nLogan types back, \"On my way.\" Caliban arrives in the hatchway, watching. \nLOGAN Charles. Listen. I gotta go for a few days. I got a long ride for some good money. When I get back, we're getting out of here, okay. Gonna drive down to Yelapa and get ourselves a boat. Live on the ocean. \nCHARLES And... you'll be safe there? From the people after you? \nLogan meets Charles' eyes. He looks to Caliban in the door. \nLOGAN Yeah. I'll be safe. \nCharles looks up at him, pleased. Logan considers his old friend, then heads for the hatch, moving past Caliban. \n", "test1_true": "Logan pulls into the lot. Everything peaceful and wet. A TV glows in the manager's office. Logan crosses to the door to Gabriela's room. He knocks. \nLOGAN Ready to go? \nBut he gets no answer, his eyes finding the splintered wood around the doorjamb. He pushes the door open... Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   24. \nINT. LIBERTY MOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nThe room has been trashed. Blood everywhere. The bed is empty. Gabriela is tied to a chair, eyes unblinking, face blue, body riddled with bullets and cuts. \nLOGAN ...Fuck. \nLogan makes a sweep of the room. Then recalls -- \nThe NIGHT STAND. Pries the side panel free. There, wedged in the gap-- A PHONE IN A PINK CASE. He takes it. \nSees her last text was to him. \"Please hurry...\" He pockets the phone. \nEXT. LIBERTY MOTEL - MORNING - RAIN \nLogan closes the door behind him and steps into the rain, scanning the lot. No sign of the girl anywhere. \nHe looks down, noticing gouges on the concrete, slashes, filling with rain and blood. Then he spots -- \nA BLOODY CYBORG FINGER on the pavement. High Tech. Severed at the knuckle, wires trailing. He picks it up. The fuck? \nSIRENS BEGINS TO RISE. He quickly crosses to his car, now noticing the MOTEL MANAGER DEAD BY THE VENDING MACHINES. \nEXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT -- DAY \nLogan barrels through the gate and screeches to a stop. Gets out and heads for the small structure behind the tank that contains his bedroom-- \nCALIBAN Hello! Logan! --What happened? \nCaliban rounds the corner in his big hat and goggles, approaching from his \"garden\" with a bunch of beets. Logan starts to climb the steps but turns as Caliban follows. \nCALIBAN (CONT'D) Did something go wrong? \nLOGAN (moving away again) The job was wrong to begin with. \nCaliban turns away with a sigh, heading to the main building. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                25. \nCALIBAN I'll close your trunk. --I'm making borscht for Charles if you want some. He got dressed for lunch \nThis is when Logan pauses and comes back down the steps looking out to his limo, TRUNK OPEN, Caliban approaching it. \nEXT. SMELTING PLANT -- A MOMENT LATER \nCaliban reaches, ABOUT TO SHUT THE TRUNK-- WHEN LOGAN'S HAND STOPS HIM. Logan peers inside. \nA CHILD'S BACKPACK. He grabs it. Unzips it. MEDICAL FILES. COMIC BOOKS. A PLASTIC HORSE. Other trinkets. Then he notices something in the trunk bed. A RUBBER BALL. The girl's ball. \nCALIBAN ...Who does that belong to? \nThat's when Logan hears a sound and looks to-- A JEEP APPROACHING ON THE HORIZON. Pierce's Jeep. \nCALIBAN (CONT'D) Who's that? \nLOGAN Aren't you supposed to see shit coming? \nCALIBAN I'm a glorified truffle pig, not a clairvoyant. \nLOGAN Go inside. Keep Charles quiet. (DEAD SERIOUS) Go. Inside. \nCaliban shuffles away as-- \nLogan watches the JEEP TURN ONTO THE GROUNDS and come to a stop in a dust cloud. Donald Pierce climbs out in a windbreaker. He approaches, taking in the property. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) You need to turn around, asshole. This is private property. \nPIERCE (laughs, comes closer) Yes, it is. In fact, I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company based in Shanghai. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 26. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) (SMILES) Where you keeping the old man? In there? Or there. I'd like to meet him. I'm told HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now. `Damned shame, what happened back east. \nLOGAN He's been dead for a year. \nPierce doesn't look convinced. Or all that interested. \nPIERCE I need the girl. \nLOGAN What girl. \nPIERCE One that goes with that ball you're holding. That's special rubber, you know. Coated with something called J-Tek. Gets in through the skin. (FAUX SERIOUS) Very calming. Like Magnesium but without the side effects. (SMILES) You feel calmer? \nLOGAN There's no girl here. \nAnother laugh, then-- \nPIERCE I know you went to the motel. \nLOGAN I was called there. There was no girl. Just the woman. \nPIERCE \"The woman\". (SIGHS) Such as she was. (LOOKS UP) So you saw Gabriela but you didn't call me? (sticks out lower lip) That hurts. Say, you didn't shoot the poor thing, did you? Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                27. \nLOGAN No. Did you? \nPIERCE I asked you first. \n", "test1_id": 2718, "test2_input": "CHARLES (rolls down window, loopy) Excuse me. I'm a nonagenarian, actually... \nPIERCE How about you tell me where the girl is first. Or maybe I ought to ask the cue ball. Seems friendly. \nLOGAN I told you, she's not here. Where's Caliban?! \nPierce smirks, amused by Logan's anger. \nPIERCE I left him in the same hole you were going to leave me. \nLogan loses it, lunges for him -- when someone hits Logan from behind. Hard. And again. As Logan falls to his knees and turns-- SNIKT-- AND SEPARATES A REAVER from his arm. \nLOGAN (TO PIERCE) You got extra barbecue tongs for this guy? \nTHE FEDERALE COMMANDER nods. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   34. \nAND A SWARM OF FEDERALES ATTACK LOGAN WITH RIFLE BUTTS AND BOOTS AND BEAT HIM TO THE GROUND. There are too many. \nPummeled, overwhelmed, his limbs all pinned, Logan turns over to find PIERCE'S FOOT TO HIS THROAT. Pierce leans down. \nPIERCE Jesus. Seeing you this way, Wolverine, it breaks my heart. \nLOGAN As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick. \nPierce smiles, then nods to one of the Reavers (Mohawk) who jumps off his bike and advances toward a side door of the Smelting Plant. He's carrying a STEEL RESTRAINING COLLAR. \nThe Federale Commander shouts to Pierce. \nFEDERALE COMMANDER (IN SPANISH) No one goes in without Federale escort. I am in charge. \nMohawk pauses. The Commander dispatches two of his Federales to lead him inside, weapons drawn. \nINT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - DAY \nTHE DOOR OPENS as MOHAWK AND THE TWO FEDERALES creep into the dark room adjacent to the kitchen, advancing toward-- \nLaura at the kitchen table, her back to them. She seems oblivious as she pours more cereal, eats with her spoon. \nOne of the Federales accidentally kicks a bottle and Laura pauses her spoon in the air. \nEXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY \nON LOGAN, watching. Charles, watching. \nSUDDENLY, THERE ARE SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE STRUCTURE. Men's screams. Then it is quiet. Everyone turns as -- \nCreeaaak. A STEEL DOOR OPENS WIDE. LAURA steps from the dark into the blazing light. She SQUINTS. \nPierce steps off Logan, having found his quarry. \nPIERCE That-a-girl. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   35. \n--and now LAURA BOOTS SOMETHING which rolls to Pierce's feet. \nPierce and the Federale Commander look down at-- A SEVERED HEAD. WITH A MOHAWK. \nTHEN SHE TOSSES THE STEEL RESTRAINT COLLAR TO THE DIRT. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) (SIGHS) ...Laura. \nON LOGAN -- Pulling himself up from the ground as-- \nLAURA-- continues walking toward Pierce. Hands at her sides. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) Laura. Stay where you are. You want to see your friends, right? \nON PIERCE-- as he nods to the REAVERS to prepare to take her. \nA CYBORG-LEGGED REAVER OPENS THE DOORS OF A CONTAINMENT TANK in back of one of their vehicles. Yet another REAVER (PRETTY BOY, not) assembles A SAVAGE HARPOON AND RESTRAINT SYSTEM. \nBut the Federale Commander suddenly orders his men to -- \nFEDERALE COMMANDER Tomar el mutante! \nAND THE CIRCLE OF FEDERALES MOVE IN ON LAURA. \nPIERCE Commander, stop! \nFEDERALE COMMANDER You said alive or dead. \nSNIKT! -- BLOODY CLAWS EXTEND FROM LAURA'S KNUCKLES. \nPIERCE Laura! NO! NO!! \nON LOGAN-- He reacts to the claws. In shock. Cannot believe what he's seeing. With the attention on Laura, Logan starts moving, limping, back to the limo. His eyes meet-- \nLaura's. A moment of mutual recognition. It breaks as she turns to face the Federales. \nON CHARLES-- who, struggling against the meds, presses himself against the glass, staring at Laura. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 36. \nCHARLES ...My Lord. \nBACK TO LAURA AS -- THE FEDERALES LUNGE AT HER and, sadly for them, Laura leaps in the air and becomes a whirling dervish of death. Limbs and weapons sliced from her attackers like a topiary. Guns fire to no effect as Laura evades the shots. \nThis little girl has been created, designed and trained for one thing and one thing only: killing. And she's a virtuoso. \nThis wave dispatched, LAURA FLEES, HIDES BEHIND THE CATWALK SUPPORTS. The armed Federales hunt for her among the supports and she starts picking them off, one by one, with her blades and even with their own guns. \n", "test2_true": "PRETTY BOY FIRES THE HARPOON GUN, retracts the cable and pins her to the ground. REAVERS AND FEDERALES SURROUND HER and PRETTY BOY is about to put on the restraints when-- \nSNIKT! -- LOGAN GUTS PRETTY BOY FROM BEHIND-- AND ENGAGES THE OTHERS as Laura pulls the harpoon from her side and runs. \nLaura is grabbed by THREE MORE REAVERS, WHO RESTRAIN HER AND STARTS TO DRAG HER AWAY -- BUT, SNIKT! -- \nTWO ADAMANTIUM FOOT CLAWS EMERGE FROM HER FEET dragging on the concrete, making a ringing sound, like chalk on a black board and -- suddenly -- with a double scissor-kick -- she stabs one Reaver in the thigh and the other in the throat, her gleaming foot claw sticking out the back of his neck. \nLogan stares, slack-jawed. Then notices-- \nPIERCE AND ANOTHER REAVER are moving on the limo, about to take Charles. Logan tosses them back and-- \nINT./EXT. LIMO - ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - CONTINUOUS \nLogan drops behind the wheel, watching through the windshield as Laura takes on six or seven more hostiles. \nCHARLES (drunk with the meds) ...As I said, Logan, she's a mutant... Like you. Very much like you, in fact. \nLogan grimly starts the engine. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                37. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Where are we going? \nLogan ignores Charles as he put the limo in gear, gaining speed, and then-- MAKES A HARD U-TURN AND -- \nWHAM! PLOWS INTO THE FEDERALES AND LAURA (WHO JUMPS ON THE HOOD TO AVOID IMPACT). \nLogan accelerates again, Laura clinging to the hood. Logan punches a button, opening the sunroof as gunfire starts to hit their limo. \nLaura leaps into the limo. Charles smiles at her, pleased and seemingly oblivious to the gunfire: \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Laura! \nAs they take a hard turn, a side window shatters and LAURA INSTINCTIVELY SHIELDS CHARLES FROM THE BULLETS. \nLAURA GETS HIT AND matter of factly sucks the slug out of her arm and spits it on the seat like Lee Marvin. \nLogan meets eyes with Charles in his rear view. And that's when they are hit with A BARRAGE OF BULLETS-- \nWIDER -- SMELTING PLANT \nTHE FEDERALES HAVE LEAPT INTO THEIR JEEPS and fire at Logan's limo as they spin out in the dirt, in pursuit. \nDisgusted, Pierce also gets behind the wheel and leads his Reavers in the opposite direction. \nTHE PLANT GATE BLOCKED BY THE ARMADA OF VEHICLES, Logan drives straight at the chainlink fence-- and we prepare for a classic action movie fence smash. \nLOGAN Hold on! \nBUT THE LIMO HITS THE FENCE, BENDS THE SUPPORTS AND GRINDS TO A PATHETIC HALT, TANGLED IN MESH. As it would in real life. \nFederales open fire at the limo as Logan guns the engine in reverse, trying to get traction on the dirt. Other Federales speed toward them on motorcycles. \nUnder massive fire, bullet-riddled, Logan's limo finds purchase, and he's backing out at high speed, ripping a long section of chain link from its posts and dragging this \"tail\" with him (driving backwards now). Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   38. \nLOGAN SWERVES HARD AND THE CHAIN LINK \"TAIL\" SWINGS OUT AND WIPES OUT THE REAVER BIKES. One of the riders tumbles and grabs onto the chain link tail, the limo dragging him. \nThe Reaver claws his way along the chain link toward the hood of the car, drawing his gun, firing at the windshield. \nLogan ducks and spins the car around. The dragging fence swings wide, LOSING THE REAVER ON THE FENCE. \nPierce angrily peels his truck in another direction. \nLogan sees the main gate ahead. As he guns for it, he notices THE FLASHING RED TRAIN-WARNING LIGHTS at the loading dock. \nTWO FEDERALE JEEPS reach the sides of the limo, guns aimed squarely at Logan. Laura and Charles react as-- \nLogan steers the limo through a series of concrete structures FORCING THE JEEPS INTO VIOLENT COLLISIONS. \nLogan guns his limo into-- \nEXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY \nLOGAN'S LIMO RACES FROM THE PLANT GROUNDS, APPROACHING-- \nA HULKING FREIGHT TRAIN arriving quickly from parallel tracks. The train is moving faster than the limo. \nLogan makes a hard left, cranking the wheel just clipping the front corner of Pierce's truck, spinning toward the tracks. \nTHE TRAIN HAS ALMOST CAUGHT UP WITH THEM AS-- \nTHE LIMO PLOWS STRAIGHT INTO THE SIDE OF A FEDERALE TRUCK which gets squeezed between the limo and train. Sparks fly. \nLOGAN SPINS THE WHEEL, PUSHING THE TRUCK (and the Federale Commander in it) INTO THE PATH OF THE TRAIN AS-- \nLOGAN GUNS HIS LIMO ACROSS THE TRACKS ITS REAR END PINGED BY THE LOCOMOTIVE-- AND THE FEDERALE TRUCK OBLITERATED. \nLOGAN'S LIMO COMES TO A STOP ON THE OTHER SIDE. Logan looks back through the moving freight cars at-- \nPierce and the remaining Reavers, stuck until it passes. It's a long train. \nEXT./INT. LIMO - RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY \nLogan's battered limo racing at 120 mph. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  39. \nLogan's eyes darting to his rearview, peeled for any sign of Reavers. He glances back at -- \nLAURA, beside Charles, her gaze fixed out the window. \n", "test2_id": 2719, "test3_input": "Caliban just looks back at him. Shudders. \nRED-HAIRED MAN (CONT'D) The girl is a rather small price to pay for that. Unlike you, she's not pure. She wasn't made by nature. She's a mistake of my own. A killer bee who's escaped from the hive. And I need to get her back before she stings. \nCALIBAN What do you want from me?! I did what I could and your human toaster ovens fucked it all up. \nThe man smiles. \nRED-HAIRED MAN I agree the Reavers have not been effective. I'm bringing new tools to bear. But I still need someone to point us in the right direction. \nCALIBAN No, no, no. I can't keep-- \nRED-HAIRED MAN Breathe. Breathe. What does he have, the old man, your friend? Alzheimer's? ALS? A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain. What a combo. \nThe man considers Caliban a moment, then reaches in his bag. \nDR. RICE You pay a high price for your gifts, my friend. Too bad you and I didn't meet years ago. I could have saved you some pain. I have something for your blisters.

RICE (CONT'D) (meets his eyes) You can call me Zander if you like. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThe Munson family and the \"Howlett\" family all sit around a table covered with food, heads bowed as the son says grace. All except Laura who looks around at the family pictures, the religious decorations (they are everywhere), the warm furnishings. Another strange place. \nNATE We thank you, Lord, for this food... and we also thank you, Lord, for sending our new friends, the Howletts to our aid today. Amen. \nThey all dig in. Laura eats like a wild animal, and the Munsons pause to watch. Charles puts a hand on her arm. \nCHARLES Slow down, child. \nShe looks around at the others, all of whom smile at her, then slows down. \nKATHRYN There's plenty more if you want. \nWILL Where are you all heading? \nLOGAN Oregon. \nCHARLES South Dakota. \nThey look at each other. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Oregon, then South Dakota. \nKATHRYN Vacation? \nCHARLES Yes. Long overdue. We're city folk. Always wanted to take a road trip, see the country. (smiles at them) Meet the people who live in it. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                73. \nLogan looks up at Charles. Watches him. The old man having himself a good time. \nKATHRYN That sounds lovely. I've been trying to get Will here to take a vacation for years now. \nWILL And if we go out traipsing around the country, who's gonna take care of this place? \nKATHRYN Exactly. I say, let it go. \nWILL And live off what? \nKATHRYN The Lord will provide. \nWILL Well, I'm still waiting for him to provide me with a new thresher. \nKATHRYN (smiles at Charles) All the same, I'd love to travel someday. \nCHARLES And I bet you will. \nNATE I could drop out of school. \nKATHRYN Let's not go that far. \nFriendly laughter around the table. THE SOUND FADES. PASSAGE OF TIME AS Laura watches the ritual of Family Dinner. Studies it. She's never really seen a family. Or, for that matter, a teenage boy. She keeps her eyes fixed on him. \nThen as DINNER FINISHES AND CLEAN UP BEGINS-- \nCHARLES Kathryn, that was easily the best meatloaf I've ever had. \nKATHRYN Thank you, Chuck. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                74. \nCharles gives Logan a look across the table. Kathryn turns to Logan now. Smiles. \nKATHRYN (CONT'D) What about you, James. Are you married? \nLOGAN Oh. I uh, I-- \nWILL Kathryn. \nKATHRYN What? It's a natural thing to ask. \nCHARLES He was. She passed. \nKATHRYN Oh, I'm so sorry. \nWill gives her a look that says, See? That's why you don't ask shit like that! \nCHARLES He killed her. \nLogan looks up at Charles. An awkward beat. Then they all burst out laughing. Logan considers Charles across the table. Was that Dementia? A joke? \n", "test3_true": "LOGAN (STANDS) Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for dinner.

Crack of dawn as it were. \nLogan grabs Charles' wheelchair. \nLOGAN Let's go wash up, Pop. \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- BATHROOM -- SAME \nLogan counts out two pills to Charles who finishes splashing water on his face, and grabs a towel. They whisper. \nCHARLES --two days on the road with one meal and hardly any sleep. She's eleven and I'm fucking ninety. \nLOGAN That's a hundred and one reasons to keep moving. \nCHARLES I'm not a box of avocados. \nLOGAN And then what. We stay the night and then what? \nCHARLES We take Laura to her friends in Eden and then... then we buy that Sunseeker. \nLogan just stares back at him, hands him his pills, goes to fill a cup of water. The faucet sputters and spits air. The pipes shudder all through the house. \nWILL (O.S.) Goddamnit. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   76. \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- HALLWAY \nLogan emerges from the bathroom, Charles follows. \nLOGAN What is it? \nWILL Nate, go fill up the tub before we lose pressure. \nNate dutifully rushes into the bathroom, starts the tub. \nKATHRYN (crosses to the window) They shut it off again. \nLOGAN Who's \"they?\" \nLaura steps into the hall. \nKATHRYN (TO WILL) You best deal with it now. \nWILL It can wait till morning. We got rain last night. \nKathryn gently touches Will's arm. Her hand slides down to his. Laura is fascinated by the simple gesture. \nKATHRYN Will. We have three guests in this house and sink full of dishes. \nWILL Alright. You're right. (explaining to Logan) The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here. Sometimes it gets itself shut off. \nNATE By assholes. \nWill gives his son a look. Charles gives Logan a look. \nCHARLES My son can go with you. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                77. \nWILL Oh, no. Thank you.

Nate passes them and stomps up the steps. Laura watches. \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nLaura comes to the top of the stairs and looks at Charles' empty wheel chair in the hallway. Logan carries Charles into a lit bedroom at the end of the hall. A sweet sight. \nLaura turns looking in the cracked door of Nate's bedroom. \nINT. GUEST BEDROOM -- SAME \nInside the guest room, Logan tucks Charles in. Charles looks out the window beside the bed. The moon over the silos. \nLOGAN There's a TV in here. \nCHARLES (SMILES GENTLY) I'm fine. \nLOGAN Okay... Get some rest. \n", "test3_id": 2720}

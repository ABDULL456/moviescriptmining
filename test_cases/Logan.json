{"train": "LOGAN \nStory by \nJames Mangold \nWritten by \nScott Frank, James Mangold & Michael Green \nFINAL SHOOTING DRAFT - August 23, 2016 \nAN LCD BILLBOARD WITH DEFECTIVE PIXELS \nA BEAUTIFUL COUPLE dance on a giant can of a Red-Bull-like drink-- HYPNO! The label morphs to different flavors. \nEXT. A VACANT LOT -- NIGHT \nColored light from the billboard flickers over a bullet riddled sign: ROUTE 85. U.S. BORDER, EL PASO, TEXAS. \nBeneath the sign is a LONG BLACK LIMOUSINE. \nCars whip past on the highway. Then A VAN passes, blasting some future version of Techno Latino Hip Hop. A SQUEAL OF TIRES OS. Now the music gets louder as the van returns, cruising slowly past the black limo before pulling into the lot. Five Bangers bail out and check out the black stretch. \nThe limo doors are locked, windows tinted, so they can't see what's inside, but they check out the tires and wheels and like what they see. With the speed of a pit crew, they open the back of the van and out come TOOLS AND A JACK. \nINT. LIMO -- SAME \nWe move over the back bench, past empty bottles, fast food wrappers as A SLEEPING MAN'S FACE ratchets into frame. He opens his red eyes. \nThe man is LOGAN aka The Wolverine or more accurately, Drunk Wolverine. He blinks, dazed, feeling the car lurching upward. Older than we've seen him, he clutches a Tequila bottle. \nEXT. LIMO -- EL PASO HIGHWAY TURNOUT - NIGHT \nAs the back door opens, the tequila bottle drops to the dirt and A BOOTED LEG STEPS OUT. \nLogan shuffles, stiff, to the other side of the stretch where the Bangers work, removing wheels, lit by colored light. \nLOGAN ...Uh. Please stop, guys. Those,.. those are chrome plated lugs. \nThey all five turn. Some pull guns on the drunk limo driver. He just keeps talking, slurring some... \nLOGAN (CONT'D) you're gonna strip `em. Plating flakes off, you know... \nA Jittery Banger cocks his shotgun. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  2. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) It's a lease, you know, and no one wants to pay to ride in a-- \n-- THE JITTERY BANGER FIRES. Blows Logan right off his feet. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Fuck. \nNow might be a good time to talk about \"fights\" described in the next 100 or so pages. Basically, if you're on the make for a hyper choreographed, gravity defying, city-block destroying, CG fuckathon, this ain't your movie. \nIn this flick, people will get hurt or killed when shit falls on them. They will get just as hurt or just as killed if they get hit with something big and heavy like, say, a car. Should anyone in our story have the misfortune to fall off a roof or out a window, they won't bounce. They will die. \nAs for our hero with his so-called eternal life and healing. Well, he's older now. If you keep reading, you'll discover Logan's about to get his ass kicked. But before we get to that, we should make it clear his abilities ain't what they were. Yes, he's a drunk, but he's also fading on the inside. Adamantium implants leeching into his system, causing chronic pain and diminished healing, hence booze as painkiller. \nSo by all means, go ahead and worry about him. Now where were we? Oh, yeah-- \nAs the smoke settles, a CROWBAR-toting Banger angrily chews out Jitters in Spanish for firing. The others resume their work... none aware of Logan slowly getting up, till -- \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Guys... seriously... (gets to his feet) You don't wanna do this. \nThe Bangers react to Logan with bafflement. Ad-lib Spanish reactions, nervous chuckles -- \nCROWBAR presses down JITTER'S gun as he moves to Logan. \nWe hear a familiar SNIKT! as claws slowly extend from one of Logan's hands, then mostly extend from the other. Logan is still frowning at his bad hand when-- \nCROWBAR THWACKS HIS SKULL. A metallic ring. \nOff balance and pissed, Logan swings at them as they converge, but he's drunk and soon they are pounding him with knives and guns and fists and a torque wrench. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    3. \nHe tries his best to keep them from the limo, catches one guy's bat an inch before it would dent the car. \nAnother one of them shoots in that direction, but Logan puts himself in front of the bullet. The pain from that little move stops him long enough for them to resume the pummeling. \nSuddenly, Logan's eyes go yellow, pupils dilating. He lets out a long, loud yell. Fury rockets up in him, like cocaine. \nHE STANDS AND RAMS HIS CLAWS INTO CROWBAR and kicks another Banger into the back of the open van. Yet another runs at Logan only to get gored in the neck and tossed. This is real work for Logan, not easy. And it is fueled by rage. \nJitters again raises his sawed-off, he will nail the car for sure, but Logan slices off his arm above the elbow. \nSadly for Logan, the hand, while disconnected from the body it once belonged to, is still holding the gun. So, as it hits the dirt, the gun goes off, putting several pellet-sized holes in the door of the limo. \nThis, more than anything else, doubles Logan anger-- \nLOGAN (CONT'D) MOTHERF-- \nWHO GETS HIT ONCE MORE --and then goes after the last banger who, seeing he had his chance, leaps into the van and spins out of the lot, his wounded compadre in back, spilling onto the dirt as the van bounces back onto the road. \nLogan picks up his keys, some loose change and a single silver bullet. He stands, staring at the holes in his otherwise pristine stretch as RAIN BEGINS TO FALL. \nHe sucks in deep breaths, forcing himself to regain control. His eyes return to normalcy. A PHONE VIBRATES OS. Logan takes out his, looks at it (he's got a fare), kicks the jack from the under the chassis. \nWE CRANE UP as Logan starts up the stretch and makes a loop in the lot, taking care to run over the three remaining Bangers before laying rubber onto the highway... \nWIDE AS-- Logan pulls his stretch into a spot at A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE. He hurries through the rain, meeting A LARGE MAN IN ORDERLY SCRUBS, smoking a vape under a canopy. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    7. \nThe two talk for a moment, Logan hands the man cash and the man toys with handing Logan a bag, pulls it away, demanding more money. They argue. \nREVERSE TO REVEAL-- A MAN IN A JEEP, WATCHING through the rain, HIS METAL HAND ON THE WHEEL. \nINT. LOGAN'S LIMO -- OUTSIDE HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER \nLogan, now carrying the bag, hurries through the rain to his Limo. He climbs inside starts it up but is startled by the back door opening and closing. Logan spins to face -- \nA SMILING MAN in the back of his stretch. This is Donald Pierce, 35. A southern boy, smooth and playful. \nPIERCE As I live and breathe. The Wolverine. And he's a junkie now. \nLOGAN Who the fuck are you? \nPIERCE Y'know, you got some buckshot in your door. (plays with the liquor bottles in back) I heard you were in Phoenix. Food's better there by the way. But then, last night, some friends in Texas H-P called, told me they found three dead cholos in a pullout out on 54. Not unusual, except one was missing a hand. Another a leg. Multiple parallel lacerations. Slashes, femoral, thoracic. So, they're thinking it was either an escaped Tiger or Freddy Krueger... but neither of those can drive, one being fictional the other extinct. And since the wheel lugs they found belong to a `24 Gauntlet-- \nLOGAN Get out. Now. \nPIERCE Has she found you yet? ...Gabriela? (off Logan's blank look) See, I'm not looking for you, mutey. Not really. I'm looking for someone who's looking for you. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 8. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) (THEN) She took something of mine. Something for which I am responsible. When I wasn't looking. Mexican lady. Long hair, long legs, Long gone. Has her sights on you. (off Logan's glare) No bells? \nLOGAN I don't know any Gabriela. So get the fuck out. \nPierce just smiles, unfazed, then shifts his gaze to Logan's bag of pills. Peering in, quasi-conspiratorial: \nPIERCE I know what you're hiding, amigo. Cue ball south of the border? \nLogan tenses, says nothing. \nLOGAN What do you want? \nPIERCE A little ...cooperation. \nFlicks a business card. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) If she does find you. \nThen Pierce exits. Crosses in the rain to a Custom Ram Truck, Logan looks to the card: \nDONALD PIERCE -- CHIEF OF SECURITY TRANSIGEN RESEARCH, A DIVISION OF ALKALI \nEXT. CORDOVA BRIDGE - BORDER - MORNING \nA HUGE FUCKING WALL. \"YOU ARE NOW LEAVING THE UNITED STATES\" says the sign mounted on top of it. Brown muted light pushes through the haze over the factories on the Mexican side. \nAn agitated Logan in border traffic, talking on his phone as he eyes the CAMERAS watching him: \nLOGAN Mr. Espiranza, yes, I know I said June, but I want the boat now. Yes. Why does that mean the price go up? (FRUSTRATED) (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    9. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Yes, I know you wanted seventy, but I am telling you I have 45 cash now. Just bring it to port in Baja. \nThe seller HANGS UP. Logan sighs. Logan squints at the Penny Saver on his seat, a listing for a Sunseeker circled when a CAR HORN blares. Logan inches forward moving past-- \nA semi pulling A LIVESTOCK TRAILER loaded with sad looking horses. EL RIO MEATS painted on the side. \nA BORDER AGENT nods cheerfully at Logan, recognizing him. Waves him on. And that's when we see -- \nTHE WOMAN FROM THE CEMETERY (GABRIELA) WATCHING HIM FROM BEHIND THE WHEEL OF HER FIAT. At a distance. She considers following him, then swings her car around. \nEXT. CIUDAD JUAREZ - HIGHWAY 45 -- MORNING \nLogan drives through littered Mexican streets. Cinderblock structures pocked with bullet holes, metal shutters pulled. \nHe merges onto Highway 45, heading for the desert. \nEXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY \nA vista of dirt, bisected by train tracks and fence. Logan slows as he approaches A GATE. Beyond the gate, AN ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT. Logan exits, pulls keys, unlocks the gate. \nA CART WITH A PROPANE TANK STOPS as the limo comes up the road. Camera reveals the cart is pushed by A TALL MAN in a wide hat, sunglasses and gloves. He wipes his ghost-pale brow. This is CALIBAN, an albino mutant in his 60's with more than a passing resemblance to Edvard Munch's THE SCREAM. \nINT. SMELTING PLANT -- \"KITCHEN\" - DAY \nTHE WINDOWS ARE PAPERED TO KEEP OUT SUNLIGHT. Caliban, glasses, hat and gloves off, prepares a tray of food as Logan enters. From somewhere, the sound of AN OLD MAN SHOUTING. \nCALIBAN He's having a bad day. \nLOGAN They're all bad days. \nLogan tosses Caliban the bag. He peers in. Logan crosses to find something to eat. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   10. \nCALIBAN He needed these six hours ago. This is not enough, you know. It won't last through the week. \nLOGAN I'm working on it. \nCaliban puts the bag of meds back in Logan's hand. \nCALIBAN Your turn. \nLogan sighs and crosses toward a cabinet. \nCALIBAN (CONT'D) You know, he told me last night he's communicating with someone. \nCaliban follows. The old man's voice getting louder. \nCHARLES They want your help, not mine. (off Logan's look) Oh, yes. That's how fucking stupid they are. They're waiting for you. At the Statue of Liberty. \nLOGAN The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago, Charles. A long time. \nLogan crosses to the old man. Takes in the worry on his face. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) There are no new mutants. Hasn't been a new one born in twenty-five years. Not anywhere. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  14. \nCharles looks off. The drugs mercifully tugging at him. \nCHARLES Impossible. \nLogan pulls the quilt over the old man. \nLOGAN You always thought we were part of God's Plan. Maybe we were just God's mistake. \nCharles touches Logan's face. A tender moment until-- \nCHARLES What a disappointment you are. \nLogan takes this in. Stung. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) When I found you, you were pursuing a career as a \"cage fighter\". \nLOGAN I'm not in the mood for bedtime-- \nCHARLES A warm capper to life as an assassin, hooked on barbiturates. (smiles, dark) You were an animal, but we took you in. I gave you a family. \nLOGAN (DARKENS) They're gone now. \nCHARLES What did you do? \nLogan eyes him a hard beat, then turns to go. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Answer me! Why are we here? \nBut Logan ignores him, moving for the hatch. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) No one should have to live this way! Drugged! In a fucking tank! \nLOGAN It's for your own good. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                15. \nCHARLES No. NO it's NOT! You're waiting for me to die! \nEXT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK -- CONTINUOUS \nLogan spins the hatch wheel, entombing the old man. He walks away as the yelling continues. \nCHARLES (O.S.) Drink new Hypno Plus! Fortified with seven nutrients and Extacine 5, for energy and vitality! \nINT. LOGAN'S BEDROOM -- SMELTING PLANT -- LATE DAY \nA SERIES OF SHOTS-- Logan on his back, unable to sleep, the sun hitting his face through a soot covered window as he stares hard at the Penny Saver boat listings: La Serenata. \nHe tosses the Pennysaver. Paces like a panther. Shirtless, scarred. He stops, looks at his right hand, flexes it, stiff, arthritic, knuckles swollen, the slits moist. \nHe forces his claws out. They come slow. Painfully. Middle one lagging. He grabs the middle claw with his other hand and pulls it hard, slicing into his palm, blood flowing. \nEXT. SMELTING PLANT -- SUNSET \nStumbling in fading light, his palm wrapped with a rag, Logan drinks from a bottle and stares at the fading light as he hears Charles calling his name in the great pitched tank. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM SHOWER - SMELTING PLANT - NIGHT \nLogan lets the water run over his scars and swollen joints. Bullet wounds are closed but still visible. \nINT. LOGAN'S BEDROOM - SMELTING PLANT - NIGHT \nLogan dresses in his chauffeur blacks. His hand shakes making it hard to button his shirt. \nINT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - NIGHT \nLogan enters, finds Caliban sorting laundry... Logan pours himself a coffee, falls in a chair. \nCALIBAN I don't want to fight but we need to talk about these things. There are things. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   16. \nLOGAN What things. \nCALIBAN Well. Would it be considered nagging if repeated my observation that the dose is too low. To suppress the seizures. \nHe shakes a near an empty pill bottle and puts it on the table. Logan examines it. \nLOGAN It's what the guy gave me. I wasn't in a position to make demands. \nCALIBAN I almost died this morning. That seizure was a-- \nLOGAN It wasn't even a minute. \nCALIBAN It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe. I was in a terrible state. You're less affected, Logan-- Please don't give me that look. You know he needs a higher dose. And I know you've got more money squirreled away. \nA red light blinks on the loading dock. Logan glares at Caliban as a rumble rises. \nLOGAN That money's to get us out of here. \nCALIBAN No. Not us. You and him. You're saving up for a bloody Sunseeker. I don't see myself hiding below deck like Nosferatu, doing laundry, do you? ...Folding your underwear. Making pigs in a blanket. \nOut another window we see-- A FREIGHT TRAIN PASSES. \nLOGAN I don't like guns. \nPIERCE Of course. (laughs; then dead serious) I wish you had called me, Logan. Like I asked. \nThe man takes a step closer and Logan grabs him by the arm. Feels something there and looks at the man who smiles... PIERCE HAS A CYBORG ARM. Ending in a gleaming, metal hand. A cyborg hand missing a finger. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) (SMILES) See. You're not the only one who's BEEN ENHANCED-- \nOut of nowhere A SOUND A LOT LIKE A BOOMERANG as A LEAD PIPE - -- THWAP -- HITS PIERCE IN THE HEAD-- AND DOWN HE GOES. \nLogan turns, stunned to see-- \nTHE GIRL standing by an out-building. \nLOGAN Hey! \nShe looks at Logan, THEN SUDDENLY WINGS ANOTHER PIPE AT HIM. Logan watches it come and CATCHES IT, about to wing it back WHEN-- \nCHARLES Logan. \nLogan turns to see Charles in his chair at the door of the main building. Looks better than usual. Caliban behind him. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Logan. Caliban. This is Laura. \nHe then smiles at the girl... \nCHARLES (CONT'D) (IN SPANISH) We've been waiting for you. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 28. \nHe motions for her to come inside. Caliban looks to Logan. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) This way, child. Come here, Laura. \nThe girl (LAURA) crosses, snatches her backpack from Logan, then steps over Pierce and crosses to Charles. \nBewildered, Logan kneels pulls a GUN from Pierce's waistband. He hands it to Caliban who lands beside him, taking in the cyborg hand and the tattoo on Pierce's neck. \nCALIBAN Looks like Ex-military. Maybe a bounty hunter? \nHe hands Caliban Don Pierce's business card. \nLOGAN Worse. \nCaliban reads Alkali on the card. \nCALIBAN He's by himself? \nLOGAN Not for long. (THINKING) Get him back in his ride. Drive him to the wash and dump him. Then take the car into Juarez, leave it for the vultures. \nCALIBAN What if he wakes up before I get there? \nHe hands Caliban the gun. \nLOGAN Text me where you are and we'll pick you up. \nINT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - LATER - DAY \nLogan enters with a duffle, shoving supplies in it. He WATCHES AS-- \nCharles sits beside \"Laura\" as she ravenously eats a bowl of cereal. Charles speaks to her gently. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                29. \nCHARLES You did what you could, Laura. (she looks at him) Well. Yes. Of course, it's painful. \nLogan eyes LAURA'S BACKPACK which she keeps close. He grabs it but Laura stands, holding the strap. Logan shoves her down. She grabs his arm. \nLOGAN You'll get it back-- after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into. \nCHARLES Logan. \nLOGAN What. \nLogan peers in her bag, notices files, a toy horse and comic book. He winces, looks up as Charles wheels over. \nCHARLES That wasn't her mother you met. \nLOGAN So she talks. \nCHARLES We're communicating. \nLOGAN (hands him pills) Take them-- Now. (goes back to packing) We have to go. Leave. It isn't safe here anymore. And you can't have an attack out there. Understand? \nCHARLES (swallows the pills) She's the mutant I told you about. The one we have to help. \nLOGAN She's not a mutant. \nCHARLES Yes, she is. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                30. \nLOGAN (crossing to a duffel) What's her gift, eating? Pipe throwing? \nLogan is interrupted by A LOUD RUMBLE AS THE NIGHTLY FREIGHT TRAIN APPROACHES. Laura bolts up from the table. Charles reaches out for her... \nCHARLES It's alright, Laura. It's only a train. A choo choo. \nHe nods to the monitor. We see the FREIGHT TRAIN passing in the distance. She stares at it. Like she's never seen one. \nLOGAN (EXITING) We gotta go. \nINT. CALIBAN'S CAR - DAY \nCHARLES (rolls down window, loopy) Excuse me. I'm a nonagenarian, actually... \nPIERCE How about you tell me where the girl is first. Or maybe I ought to ask the cue ball. Seems friendly. \nLOGAN I told you, she's not here. Where's Caliban?! \nPierce smirks, amused by Logan's anger. \nPIERCE I left him in the same hole you were going to leave me. \nLogan loses it, lunges for him -- when someone hits Logan from behind. Hard. And again. As Logan falls to his knees and turns-- SNIKT-- AND SEPARATES A REAVER from his arm. \nLOGAN (TO PIERCE) You got extra barbecue tongs for this guy? \nTHE FEDERALE COMMANDER nods. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   34. \nAND A SWARM OF FEDERALES ATTACK LOGAN WITH RIFLE BUTTS AND BOOTS AND BEAT HIM TO THE GROUND. There are too many. \nPummeled, overwhelmed, his limbs all pinned, Logan turns over to find PIERCE'S FOOT TO HIS THROAT. Pierce leans down. \nPIERCE Jesus. Seeing you this way, Wolverine, it breaks my heart. \nLOGAN As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick. \nPierce smiles, then nods to one of the Reavers (Mohawk) who jumps off his bike and advances toward a side door of the Smelting Plant. He's carrying a STEEL RESTRAINING COLLAR. \nThe Federale Commander shouts to Pierce. \nFEDERALE COMMANDER (IN SPANISH) No one goes in without Federale escort. I am in charge. \nMohawk pauses. The Commander dispatches two of his Federales to lead him inside, weapons drawn. \nINT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - DAY \nTHE DOOR OPENS as MOHAWK AND THE TWO FEDERALES creep into the dark room adjacent to the kitchen, advancing toward-- \nLaura at the kitchen table, her back to them. She seems oblivious as she pours more cereal, eats with her spoon. \nOne of the Federales accidentally kicks a bottle and Laura pauses her spoon in the air. \nEXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY \nON LOGAN, watching. Charles, watching. \nSUDDENLY, THERE ARE SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE STRUCTURE. Men's screams. Then it is quiet. Everyone turns as -- \nCreeaaak. A STEEL DOOR OPENS WIDE. LAURA steps from the dark into the blazing light. She SQUINTS. \nPierce steps off Logan, having found his quarry. \nPIERCE That-a-girl. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   35. \n--and now LAURA BOOTS SOMETHING which rolls to Pierce's feet. \nPierce and the Federale Commander look down at-- A SEVERED HEAD. WITH A MOHAWK. \nTHEN SHE TOSSES THE STEEL RESTRAINT COLLAR TO THE DIRT. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) (SIGHS) ...Laura. \nON LOGAN -- Pulling himself up from the ground as-- \nLAURA-- continues walking toward Pierce. Hands at her sides. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) Laura. Stay where you are. You want to see your friends, right? \nON PIERCE-- as he nods to the REAVERS to prepare to take her. \nA CYBORG-LEGGED REAVER OPENS THE DOORS OF A CONTAINMENT TANK in back of one of their vehicles. Yet another REAVER (PRETTY BOY, not) assembles A SAVAGE HARPOON AND RESTRAINT SYSTEM. \nBut the Federale Commander suddenly orders his men to -- \nFEDERALE COMMANDER Tomar el mutante! \nAND THE CIRCLE OF FEDERALES MOVE IN ON LAURA. \nPIERCE Commander, stop! \nFEDERALE COMMANDER You said alive or dead. \nSNIKT! -- BLOODY CLAWS EXTEND FROM LAURA'S KNUCKLES. \nPIERCE Laura! NO! NO!! \nON LOGAN-- He reacts to the claws. In shock. Cannot believe what he's seeing. With the attention on Laura, Logan starts moving, limping, back to the limo. His eyes meet-- \nLaura's. A moment of mutual recognition. It breaks as she turns to face the Federales. \nON CHARLES-- who, struggling against the meds, presses himself against the glass, staring at Laura. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 36. \nCHARLES ...My Lord. \nBACK TO LAURA AS -- THE FEDERALES LUNGE AT HER and, sadly for them, Laura leaps in the air and becomes a whirling dervish of death. Limbs and weapons sliced from her attackers like a topiary. Guns fire to no effect as Laura evades the shots. \nThis little girl has been created, designed and trained for one thing and one thing only: killing. And she's a virtuoso. \nThis wave dispatched, LAURA FLEES, HIDES BEHIND THE CATWALK SUPPORTS. The armed Federales hunt for her among the supports and she starts picking them off, one by one, with her blades and even with their own guns. \nLOGAN Who the fuck are you? \nLaura slowly turns, acknowledging Logan's existence. \nCHARLES You know who she is, Logan. \nLOGAN No. I don't. \nCHARLES Does she remind you of anybody? \nLaura holds Logan's glare with her own equally hard look. \nLogan flares, peers tensely back out the windshield as he takes a hard turn. \nEXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - MORNING \nDonald Pierce steps over a mangled Reaver as the remaining \"soldiers\" clean up after the fight. \nPIERCE Leave nothing behind fellas. We were not here! \nHe walks toward the main building, then looks back. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) Bring me the tracker. \nINT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - MORNING \nPierce steps inside and takes in the room. Picks up the RED SLICKER on the chair. Finds her ball in the pocket. \nHe turns as the DOOR IS OPENED and A SERIOUSLY INJURED CALIBAN is carried inside and shoved into a chair. He's hooked up to an IV, his head is covered with a HOOD. \nPierce rips off the hood and slaps Caliban's battered face. \nPIERCE Wakey wakey. \nCaliban blinks his pale eyes open. Pierce sits down across from him and smiles. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                40. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) You know, I read about you when I was a kid. You tracked that crazy gilled mutey fishy motherfuck, what was his name, Wave? (flutters his metal digits) Tracked him halfway `cross the Atlantic they said. And you was underwater. Inside a sub. And you found him anyway. Shit. That's a gift. That's trackin'! \nCALIBAN I'm sorry. I believe you're thinking of someone else. \nPierce grins. SUDDENLY STRIKES Caliban with his metal hand. \nPIERCE 'I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team, for the good guys. You were helping round up all the old mutes. \nCaliban says nothing. Pierce picks up Laura's ball. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) What changed? 'You got religion? \nPierce slides Laura's RED SLICKER onto the table. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) Gonna need you to help the good guys one more time, and track one more special for me. \nCALIBAN I will not. I will not help you. \nPierce turns toward the blacked out kitchen window. Starts to peel at the tar paper. \nPIERCE Of course that's what you'd say. But then I got this theory that people don't really change. \nPierce suddenly pulls the tar paper, RELEASING A SHARD OF BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. Caliban cries out, tries to turn away. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) Beware the light, Caliban. I bet that's what your Mommy said every day when you was a kid. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 41. \nCALIBAN PLEASE-- \nPIERCE Beware the light. \nTwo Reavers force his face into the bright light. The mutant's eyes open. It burns. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) Let's not bring out the worst in each other. The girl's not worth it. She's not a natural fuck-up like you. She's a business mistake. R & D gone bad. There's liability. They can't have things with patents running around hurting people. So we need to get her off board before she hurts anybody else, someone you care about maybe. \nPierce nods to his men and they put the hood back over Caliban's head and haul him out, crying. \nWHISPERED VOICE (V.O.) ...My name is Gabriela Lopez. \nCLOSE ON -- A PHONE, GABRIELA'S PHONE \nON THE SCREEN WE SEE-- A SHAKY SELFIE OF GABRIELA in a Mexico City apartment. She looks healthier but grim. \nGABRIELA I am a nurse and for ten years I have worked at Transigen research in Mexico City. \nOn screen, we are moving through corridors of a high end research facility. See flashes of Gabriela in reflections in glass, in a nurse's uniform, recording surreptitious video. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) Transigen is a owned by an American company. And they pay better than any Mexican hospital. \nA SHAKY SHOT -- CLOSE ON letterhead from a memo -- ALKALI. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) What I am about to show you is illegal in the U.S. and Canada-- \nCLOSE ON -- A NEW SELFIE OF GABRIELA, now in a stockroom. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  42. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) --and that is why they came here. \nCUT TO -- A BRIGHTLY LIT WARD. A SLOPPY PAN ACROSS A GROUP OF DRUGGED CHILDREN (ages 5-15) as they are prodded into kennel- like enclosures decorated with tattered stuffed animals. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) These children were born in this building. They were born here and they have never left. Never seen the sun or ocean, the rain or snow or any of God's creatures. \nSleeping mats on tile floors with exposed drains and hoses. Armed guards, some missing limbs, perhaps recognizable as Reavers, juxtaposed against the cheerful sound of musak. This place is a cross between a Children's hospital and a kennel. \nLogan crosses to the -- \nINT. TRUCK STOP MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nWe look at a half closed handicapped stall door as Logan and Charles shuffle about inside. \nCHARLES Stop it. For God's sake I can do that myself! \nLOGAN Well, you're not doing it! \nEXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY \nAs Logan wheels Charles back to the car, he looks over at the bucking bronco ride. LAURA'S GONE. \nINT. TRUCK STOP CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY \nLaura walks down an aisle, looking at the colorful products. She grabs a can of Pringles, starts in on it. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                46. \nThen she stops and looks at a floor display of Hypno, Mag and all the variations of \"energy drinks.\" Laura grabs a can, opens it and takes a long drink. She's bouncing as she walks now... \nA CLERK looks up from his phone at her eating snacks. \nLaura stops at a SUNGLASS RACK, munching. Notices a pair of shades. Puts them on, eats more, looking at herself. \nCLERK Yo. Girlie. You gotta pay for that. \nLaura looks up with her mouth full. She starts for the door. \nThe Clerk blocks her way. She just looks up at him. \nCLERK (CONT'D) Where's your mommy and daddy? \nShe continues staring. Shoves some Pringles in her mouth. \nCLERK (CONT'D) Alright, that's enough-- \nHe swipes the Pringles can from her hand, about to take the sunglasses from her nose, when, in a terrifyingly swift move, she throws the clerk to the floor, straddling him, hand on his throat the other raised-- SNIKT-- claws out. \nCLERK (CONT'D) Holy shit! Oh God Jesus, No! \nThat's when a hand again grabs Laura by the wrist. \nLOGAN Not okay. \nLogan pushes Laura to the door turns to the clerk-- \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Sorry. \n--then grabs a handful of CIGARS and A PHONE CHARGER, stealing a look at a security camera on his way out. \nINT. EXT LIMO -- OKLAHOMA -- NIGHT \nA great starry sky as the desert becomes the plains. The limo sits, parked along a flat stretch of Oklahoma highway. \nLaura and Charles are asleep in back. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                47. \nLogan sits up front in the darkness, legs across the bench, staring at the road ahead and then at the Pennysaver clipping for the boat on his visor. And the envelope of cash. \nA billboard up ahead hypes GAMBLING AND SHOWS IN OKLAHOMA CITY, 50 miles away. \nThere is a small beep. Logan sighs, looks down to Gabriela's pink phone plugged into the charger. It's come to life. He raises the partition and hits play. \nON THE PHONE SCREEN -- PART TWO OF GABRIELA'S VIDEO : \nWE SEE A \"STAFF MEMBER\" PINNED ON THE FLOOR, SKIN SMOKING, his neck being gripped by a 9 year old with glowing eyes. People scream. \"Leo! Basta! Basta!\" The boy leans back and starts crying. The staff member is dead. \nGABRIELA As the children became older, they became difficult to control. \nANOTHER SURREPTITIOUS VIDEO. A BUMPY SKINNED CHILD expertly shoots an automatic weapon into target dummies in an indoor range. SUDDENLY THEY TURN AND SHOOT THE INSTRUCTOR. SCREAMS. \nA MOVING SHOT. THE BOY WITH GLOWING EYES is chased by security up a staircase to a rooftop. An alarm whoops. The boy lands outside and, for a moment, breathes air and stares at Mexico City. Panicked staff yell to him in Spanish as -- \nTHE BOY THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE LEDGE. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) They taught them to kill-- but they did not remove their hearts. \nANOTHER CHILD IS FORCIBLY CUFFED IN A NOW FAMILIAR RESTRAINT SYSTEM, hissing, spitting, VIBRATING, loose objects flying around the room. OTHER CHILDREN WATCH. Some weep. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) They could not be controlled. \nANOTHER SHOT -- A trickle of blood runs to a drain. TILT TO FIND A YOUNG LAURA IN A SMOCK, seemingly drugged, SITTING on the floor of a tiled room. She stares at her arm as she cuts it with a metal claw, then watches it heal, then cuts again. \nThe camera/phone drops and we see a dutched image of Laura as Gabriela comforts her, saying \"What are you doing, baby?\" in Spanish. Laura cries on her shoulder. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  48. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) A soldier who cannot be controlled is not a good soldier. \nA LONG LENS GLIMPSE OF THE RED HAIRED MAN, temperamental, gesticulating, walking up a corridor, trailed by PIERCE. \nNOW A SHOT FROM A MOVING CAR-- OF A WINDOWLESS STRUCTURE. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Inside this building is something new. Something better than X-23. \nSTOLEN SHOTS FROM IN THE NEW BUILDING-- FLASHES OF TANKS CONTAINING ADULT HUMAN ORGANS, LIMBS submerged in liquids on collagen forms: arms, hearts, feet-- some being harvested. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) I got inside yesterday. \nTHE RED HAIRED MAN confers with technicians. A Reaver notices Gabriela who hides her camera/phone. She claims (in Spanish) to be lost. \nX23-22: Can FREEZE OBJECTS with her cryogenic breath. \nX23-20: Can TRANSFORM AND MOVE ORGANIC PLANT LIFE -- grasses, trees, plants, a sort of green \"Magneto\". \nX23-11: Can generate seismic energy in nearby objects... Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  52. \nLogan keeps flipping through the files, until he finds the one he's really looking for: LAURA. \n\"High IQ\" \"Volatile emotional swings\" \"Difficult to control\" \"Signs of Manic Depression in source genetics.\" \n\"SOURCE DNA: JAMES HOWLETT.\" \nClinical photos of Laura's Adamantium implant. Medical images of this little girl on a stainless table, in exquisite pain. \nLogan can't look anymore. They bring back his own dark memories. Closing it, he finds a WRINKLED PHOTO clipped to the back. It's of GABRIELA AND ANOTHER NURSE (MARIA) WITH OTHER YOUNG MUTANTS IN A LAB. On back is that address in North Dakota. And a list of names: \"Delilah, Rictor, Bobby, Rebecca, Laura and Charlotte.\" \nLogan tucks the file back in the backpack, then notices something else... wadded in a side pocket. \nSEVERAL COMIC BOOKS. X-MEN comic books. \nLOGAN ...For fuck's sake. \nEXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING \nAs Pierce and his Reavers show up and take over the place. They start sealing it off, and head in to the MINI MART... \nINT. TRUCK STOP MINI MART - MORNING \nThe clerk is scared/confused as Pierce and a Reaver enter and lock the door behind them... \nCLERK Who are you guys? More cops? Dude, I already told them everything. \nINT./EXT. VAN - TRUCK STOP - MORNING \nWhere a battered Caliban sits, guarded by a Reaver, the red slicker in his lap. The Reaver beside him reaches over and raises the SHADE. Caliban recoils and we now see the blisters on his face from the previous exposure to light. \nINT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - SUITE - DAY \nLaura finishes tying her NEW SHOES amid some clothing boxes. She also wears a new unicorn shirt, new skirt and leggings. The ones from the display. She's pleased and meets eyes with-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                53. \nLogan, who emerges from the bathroom with the backpack. He doubletakes at her, then grabs another bottle from the mini bar. We hear canned gunfire from the next room. \nLaura crosses to Charles in the bedroom and sits on the edge of the bed where he is watching \"Shane.\" On screen, the big \"shoot out\" grabs Laura's attention. \nLogan walks in, watching indifferently. \nLaura remains riveted as on-screen-- SHANE KNEELS DOWN AND SAYS GOODBYE TO LITTLE JOEY: \nSHANE (ON TV) A man has to be what he is, Joey. Can't break the mould. I tried and it didn't work. There's no living with a killing. There's no going back. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand that sticks. Now run on home to your mother, and you tell her... everything's alright and there aren't any more guns in the valley. \nLogan looks up as he hears a sigh from Charles. \nLogan clears his throat and they both turn his way. He holds up the THE X-MEN COMIC. \nLOGAN You read this in your spare time? \nShe sees the comic in his hand, backpack in the other--gets up and grabs them both from Logan and turns back to the film. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) You do know this is bullshit, right? A quarter of it happened. And none like this. In the real world, people die and no self promoting asshole in a leotard can stop it. This is just ice cream for BED-WETTERS AND-- \nCHARLES --Logan. \nLogan turns to Charles who forces a smile. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) I think Laura well understands life's impermanence. (BEAT) (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   54. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Didn't you say something about finding us a new ride? \nLogan looks at the two of them, all chummy now, and gets up. \nLOGAN Right. Fine. \nHe pauses at the door and tosses a pill vial to Charles. Laura catches it. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Take two more in an hour. \nCHARLES Good-bye, Logan. \nINT./EXT. LIMO - OUTSKIRTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY - DAY \nAs Logan drives past a USED CAR dealership. He goes around the corner, starts looking around, goes another few blocks until he sees what he's looking for-- \nEXT. OKLAHOMA CITY - SIDE STREET - DAY \nShitty block. Graffiti everywhere. A GANG OF YOUNG THUGS hang beneath the interstate overpass. \nLogan gets out of his limo, checks the back, sees a couple more of Laura's UNCANNY X-MEN COMICS lying on the bench. Grabs them. Checks that's everything. Then finds several of Charles pills wedged in the car seat. \nLOGAN ...Fuck. \nHe slams the door, walking past THE THUGS, tossing them the LIMO KEYS. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Knock yourselves out. \nWalking toward the car lot, Logan eyes the cars in the lot all with sale written on their windshields. \nBehind him, the thugs cross to the limo, glancing at Logan before getting in, and laying rubber in the other direction. Logan flips the liquor bottle in the trash. \nINT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - 12TH FLOOR - LATE DAY \nAS LOGAN LEAPS OFF THE ELEVATOR and fights his way through the rippling force, past A MAID, FROZEN beside her cart, struggling for air to make it around the corner and down the HALL TOWARD-- \nTHE CRACKED SUITE DOOR WHERE TWO ARMED REAVERS stand frozen and gurgling for air, their weapons pointed inward. \nSNIKT! -- LOGAN'S TARNISHED CLAWS EMERGE AND -- \nHE GUTS THE TWO FROZEN HELPLESS REAVERS IN TWO QUICK THRUSTS. Their blood and guts pour to the floor, their eyes wide as they perish in a standing rigor mortis. \nINT. REAVERS COMMAND TRUCK -- LATE DAY \nPIERCE, HIS ASSOCIATE AND CALIBAN, still paralyzed the wave. We see on their body cam monitors as Logan skewers the men, their life support monitors blinking -- AGENT TERMINATED. \nINT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL -- SUITE -- LATE DAY \nLogan pushes through THE DOOR TO FIND-- A SURREAL SCENE: THREE MORE REAVERS FROZEN IN MID ATTACK. The room service cart up-ended. \nCHARLES sits slumped in his chair, near the window, mouth in a rictus-like grimace, body quivering, rippling waves of force emanating from his skull. \nLAURA, HER CLAWS OUT, is on the floor, semi-paralyzed, struggling to pull herself toward Charles' meds. She reaches the hypodermic, attempts to hand it to -- \nLogan who falls to his knees from the shrieking wave. He fumbles, almost dropping it, eyes starting to roll up in his own head as he lunges and jams the needle into Charles' neck. \nAfter a moment, RINGING stops -- Logan falls back-- the remaining Reavers fall to the ground and, as they gasp for air, Laura and Logan kill them all. Brutal. \nCharles is spent dazed, gasping for air. \nLogan peers down at one of the dead Reavers, checking him out, peering into his BODYCAM. \nLOGAN We have to go. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   59. \nINT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL -- LOBBY - MINUTES LATER \nDealers, Bellhops, patrons all stumble about in a daze -- children crying -- some people are vomiting or clawing at their heads. SIRENS IN THE DISTANCE. \nAs Logan comes out of an elevator pushing a dazed Charles in his chair, Laura follows. Charles is horrified. \nCHARLES I'm so sorry. Oh God... \nINT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - CASINO FLOOR - DAY \nLogan pushes Charles, fast, and Laura follows, dragging her backpack, making their way toward the glass doors. \nThey zig zag through the crowd of recently unstuck patrons and employees, many sick and stumbling, choking, some crying, some scream for medical help. \nBouncing in his chair, Charles stares at the suffering around him, stricken with empathy-- and guilt. \nLaura lingers, watching A FAT MAN GET CPR FROM A PANICKED COCKTAIL WAITRESS. The man suddenly comes to life, sucking air. The waitress' face fills with wonder. Laura stares. \nLOGAN Hey! Now! \nEXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - VALET - TWILIGHT \nCatching up, Laura follows Logan and Charles out the casino doors. We hear the rising sirens of approaching first responders as the trio moves to the new pick up truck. \nLOGAN This way! \nLogan lifts Charles into the back seat, throws the chair in back bed and gets in. Laura climbs in beside Charles, who stares out the back window at the chaos as they pull away. \nThe camera pans with them as they depart, then finds-- \nSEVERAL REAVER VEHICLES parked at the side of the building. \nMOVING IN ON -- THE REAVER COMMAND TRUCK. THE BACK DOORS suddenly BURST OPEN. PIERCE stumbles out, dazed, sweaty. He looks to emergency trucks approaching, cherry topped. Then his eyes find-- FIVE REAVERS. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   60. \nPIERCE Get the bodies. \nRestrained in the back of the truck, Caliban, blistered and weak, watches PIERCE, who leans against the truck to support himself, chugs some water until he feels Caliban's stare and SLAMS THE DOOR. \nINT./EXT. PICK UP - FARM COUNTRY HIGHWAY -- DAWN \nCLICK. CLACK. CLICK. CLACK. Logan drives. A good distance from the Oklahoma City, topography has changed. \nThe sun breaks over the horizon. The radio chatters with breaking news reports on the event at the Casino-- speculation of a gas leak or food poisoning. \nREPORTER (ON RADIO) ...some noting a similarity to the incident last year in Westchester, New York that left 50 dead, and twice that many injured-- \nLogan SNAPS off the radio, quickly looks in back to see if Charles overheard it. Charles was sleeping. Opens his eyes. \nCLICK. CLACK. CLICK. Logan's eyes flit to Laura playing with the door lock. \nLOGAN Knock it off. \nShe stares at him in the mirror, CLICK, does it again. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) I said knock it off. \nCharles takes a breath, closes his eyes. \nCHARLES She's a child, Logan. In point of fact she's-- \nLOGAN How long has it been since you took your meds? (NO RESPONSE) Charles. How long? \nCHARLES ...I don't know. Two days. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                61. \nLOGAN You saw what happened last night. If that shit had gone on longer, everyone at that casino-- \nThe Trooper looks at Laura. \nTROOPER That your name, honey? (LAURA NODS) And is this man your father? \nLaura looks at Logan. A pause. Then... nods. \nCHARLES (LEANS FORWARD) My son has a bit of a lead foot. I try to tell him that Mount Rushmore will still be there and just as beautiful a day from now. \nThe Trooper finishes writing the ticket... \nTROOPER You got a nice family. Try to keep `em safe, James. \nEXT. REAVER CARAVAN -- OUTSKIRTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY -- DAY \nTHE CARAVAN OF REAVER VEHICLES is parked in a large paved pull out area, like a weigh station or rest stop. Local police wave traffic past, clearing the way for-- \nA FLATBED TRUCK approaching with a police escort. THERE IS A HUGE BOX STRAPPED IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   65. \nCLOSE ON -- PIERCE, looking from the arriving flatbed to -- \nA HELICOPTER growing larger in the sky. \nINT./EXT. REAVER CONTROL TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS \nBeaten, burned and shaking, confined in the back, Caliban hears the approaching chopper and peers out through a security window, watching-- \nThe helicopter land on the blacktop. He shifts to a second window to see a better view of-- \nTHE RED HAIRED MAN FROM THE LAB, as he steps out of the chopper and heads directly to Pierce. A silent movie as Pierce gets his ass handed to him. \nCaliban's attention shifts back to the first window as-- \nTHE FLATBED TRUCK pulls up next to the control truck. Its HANDLERS look nervous. Inside the big box strapped in back, there is some sort banging, then a low guttural screaming. \nNow, the Red Haired Man, carrying a medical case, approaches the flatbed and opens the back hatch, disappearing the big box. The screaming subsides. \nCaliban collapses to the floor. Closes his eyes. \nEXT. FARM COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY \nAs the pick-up truck passes a billboard that reads \nWELCOME TO CORN COUNTRY: HEART OF AMERICA. \nFields on either side of the endless ribbon of road. In the fields are HUGE AUTOMATED THRESHERS/HARVESTERS. The machines are several times bigger than what we see on farms today. \nINT./EXT. PICK UP - FARM COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY \nAs Logan navigates the pick-up through what looks like a canyon of big trucks. Laura, face pressed to the glass, stares up and out the window at all of them. \nOne of them inches over and Logan is almost run off the road. \nLOGAN HEY-- \nHe hits the HORN, looks up at the driverless truck cab as he pulls around. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                66. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) IN YOUR OWN LANE, ASSHOLE! \nCHARLES Language, Logan. And you're screaming at a machine. \nLogan flips off the truck anyway as he passes, gets clear of all of them. Logan sees Charles shake his head. \nLOGAN What, she can gut a man with her feet, but she can't hear naughty words? \nCHARLES She can learn to be better. \nLOGAN You mean, better than me. \nCHARLES Actually, yes. And by the way, Laura's foot claws are an obvious result of her gender. (off Logan's look) In a pride of lions, females are caregivers of the young and hunters of the pride, they have front claws to hunt and foot claws for defense. They use the foot claw to strike the belly or bladder of the attacker, thus ensuring their escape and survival. \nLaura takes this in, turns and looks out the other window. Logan sighs and drives on. \nLAURA'S POV - ANOTHER CAR An older farm pick up truck towing A HORSE TRAILER. Laura stares at the animals as they pass. \nIn the back seat of the pick up sits A TEENAGE BOY. He looks back at Laura. Up front are his MOTHER and FATHER. They also look this way, smile. A farm family. \nSoon Logan has left them behind, too. A moment of quiet in the car. Logan looks in the rearview at Charles and Laura. Both seem calm, even serene, as they gaze out their windows, Laura still looking back at the horses. ...Almost normal. \nBut then A LOUD HORN and Logan looks ahead as he's nearly run off the road by one of the GIANT HULKING VEHICLES coming in the other direction, crossing into his lane. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  67. \nLogan pulls the wheel one way then swerves back as LAURA'S CLAWS EXTEND AND PUNCH THROUGH THE ROOF with one hand, holds Charles with the other so they don't get thrown. \nLogan struggles to gain control of the pick-up, spins the truck around so it's facing on-coming traffic, avoids ANOTHER MEGA-TRUCK coming at them before he finally gets the pick-up onto the shoulder, facing in the direction they came from. \nThe three of them watch down the highway from the shoulder (looking in the direction of where they just came) as-- \nTHE FAMILY TOWING THE HORSE TRAILER ARE RUN OFF THE ROAD by one of the SAME CAREENING MEGA TRUCKS. Their horse trailer tipping onto its side at an angle, its doors swinging wide. \nLogan, Charles and Laura watch as -- FOUR HORSES now leap from the trailer, running free... \nLOGAN Shit. Oh well. \nLogan twists the wheel, prepares to pull back onto the highway and drive away. Charles puts a hand on his shoulder. \nCHARLES We have to help them. \nLOGAN We have to keep moving. Someone will come along. \nAs Logan turns away, Charles reaches for him. \nCHARLES You know, Logan. This is what life looks like. A house, people who love each other. A safe place. Take a moment and feel it. (BEAT) You still have time. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   78. \nLogan looks off, distant. Troubled. \nLOGAN Charles. The world is not the same as it was. We're taking a risk here. And where we're going. Eden. It doesn't exist. Her nurse got it from a comic book. \nCharles stays quiet. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) You just need to understand-- it's not real. \nCharles looks up at Logan, his tone gentle, and firm. \nCHARLES It is for Laura. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - DEN - NIGHT \nLogan passes Laura as he comes down the stairs. He follows Will down the hall. A GUN COCKS and Logan sees Will has opened A CABINET, tucking a pistol in his waistband. \nWILL (SMILES) Don't worry. We won't need it. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - DIRT ROAD - NIGHT \nAs Logan and Will carry tools along a dirt access road... \nWILL Canewood Beverage bought up everything out here. Except us. When we wouldn't sell, they tried eminent domain. Then screwing with our water. Couple months ago, someone poisoned our dogs. \nLOGAN So today, out on the highway-- \nWILL Who knows. Maybe. \nLooking at the giant harvesters working the dark fields. \nWILL (CONT'D) They're like dinosaurs. Twenty ton bodies with little tiny brains. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 79. \nWILL (CONT'D) They work day and night, no drivers, shucking their cloned up super-corn. Bears fruit in half the time. Taste like shit, though. \nLOGAN So why do people eat it? \nWILL They don't. They drink it. (off Logan's look) Corn syrup. Its in all those drugged up drinks everyone's having nowadays-- to stay awake, feel strong, cheer up, sexy, whatever. Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day, you know? \nLOGAN Mine still are. \nWill leads Logan to a PUMP HOUSE. A tangle of intersecting irrigation pipes under a canopy. The lock HAS BEEN BROKEN. \nLogan looks out into the night, cautious. \nINT. PUMP HOUSE - NIGHT \nWill sets his tools down and looks at the pump. Someone has opened up all the valves and the place is now flooding. \nWILL Looks like we'll be here a while. \nLogan finds a convenience store cigar in his pocket. Lights it. Enjoys the moment, wind blowing through the trees. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - NATE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nRodeo trophies, posters, etc. The room of a kid who loves everything about that world. Nate -- ear buds in -- does his homework while listening to music. He looks up and sees-- \nLAURA standing in the doorway watching his every move. She looks at the trophies, curious. \nHe glances at her, but tries to focus on his homework. Erases something on his electronic writing pad. \nShe looks at the pad's screen. A series of equations with blanks to fill in and chicken scratch in the digital margins. He pulls out one of the buds, waves a stylus, and explains-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                80. \nNATE I'm not too good at math. \nShe stares at the equations on the pad, the screen littered with scribbles, things crossed out, then looks once more at the trophies... \nNATE (CONT'D) Those two are for breakaway roping. Those for barrel racing. Those up there are for pole bending. But all second, third place. I'm not so good at it. My dad makes me do it. \nShe just looks at him. Stares at him, really. Hears music coming from the dangling bud and looks at it. \nNATE (CONT'D) You wanna listen? \nHe puts the bud in her ear so that they now each have one. \nNATE (CONT'D) It's called \"Devil's Whisper\". It's by Raury. \nShe listens to the music a moment, cuts her eyes at the older boy who can feel her looking at him. Takes a whiff of him. He finally pulls the bud from his own ear and gently passes her HIS PHONE-- \nNATE (CONT'D) Here. Take it for tonight. I'll get it back in the morning. \nShe just looks back at him. He holds up his stylus... \nNATE (CONT'D) I gotta do my homework. (holds out his hand) Good-night. \nShe stares at his extended hand. Then looks at the screen of the pad. She takes the stylus and hunches over him and quickly scrawls on the screen-- \nNATE (CONT'D) Hey, what are you-- \nThen he realizes that she's doing the equations. One after the other. Just like that. She finishes, then straightens up. \nNATE (CONT'D) How did you do that? Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                81. \nNOW she shakes his hand. He notices little ridges on her knuckles. Looks up at her as she puts the other bud in her ear and walks out. He sighs, goes back to his work. \nThey haul Jackson to his feet, throw him in the truck, turn around and drive back the way they came. \nLogan breaks the rifle over his knee and throws the pieces into the field. He turns to see Will staring at him. \nWILL You've had training. \nLOGAN Some. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nQuiet. A moment. As Logan and Will walk back up the road. Feeling good about what they've accomplished. \nWILL Wish I had you around all the time. (HALF JOKING) Sure you don't want to stay? \nLOGAN No, but I'll take a drink if you got one. \nWILL Kathryn doesn't like booze in the house. \nLOGAN (SMILES) Maybe I got something in the truck. \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- SPARE BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nCrickets buzz in the fields. A breeze blows. Charles lies awake, looking out at the crescent moon over the farm. His eyes travel downward to find-- Laura asleep on a hooked rug. \nThen: A FLOORBOARD CREAKS and Charles turns to see-- LOGAN, in the doorway, in silhouette. He looks at Laura asleep on the floor, curled like a shrimp. He takes a step toward her. \nCHARLES ...Don't wake her yet. Let her have another hour. \nLogan looks at Charles. Charles lays back on the pillow looking out the window at the farm. Something stirring him. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                85. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) ...This was, without a doubt, the most splendid night I've had in a long time. ...but then... \nAs Logan takes another step toward Laura, Charles trembles. He does not look away from the window. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) ...I don't deserve it, do I? (THEN) ...I did something... unspeakable. \nLogan turns. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) I remembered what happened in Westchester. This was not the first time I've hurt people. \n(pain fills his eyes) Until today, I didn't know. You wouldn't tell me. We just kept running from it. I'm done running. \nCharles turns to Logan. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) (ALMOST FUNNY) I think I finally understand you, Logan... (DEAD SERIOUS) ...the burden you carry... \nLogan arrives at Charles bedside. Puts his hand on Charles' shoulder. Charles cocks his head, perplexed, looking up at him in the shadows. Something is wrong. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Logan... \nLOGAN PRESSES HIS FIST INTO CHARLES' CHEST. \nCharles GASPS. Logan pulls his hand back and that's when we see his CLAWS ARE BLOODY. \nOn the floor, LAURA OPENS HER EYES. \nCharles LOOKS UP FROM HIS WOUND, blood coming. He tries to reach a bedside light and succeeds as again-- THE CLAWS PLUNGE INTO HIS CHEST. IN THE LIGHT WE SEE -- THIS IS A PERFECT DOUBLE OF LOGAN. \nFor simplicity's sake, let's call this creature BAD LOGAN. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 86. \nHe will also be referenced as \"X-24\", his model number. He is a younger, stronger, clone of The Wolverine. Feral, he moves in a slight crouch. He is not the absence of emotion but rather, the presence of it, most noticeably, rage. \nLAURA FLIES AT BAD LOGAN, SHRIEKING, landing on his back, gouging his flesh. He spins, trying to shake her, swiping at his back with his blades. He stumbles across the room and slams his back on the wall, crushing her, plaster cracking. \nLAURA DROPS TO THE GROUND. Dazed. \nNATE (O.S.) Hey! \nNATE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY, a Louisville Slugger in his hand. \nHis wide eyes take in Charles, bleeding, still moving, Laura on the floor, claws covered in blood. Then he looks to BAD LOGAN-- AND LUNGES-- \nA METALLIC THWACK as the bat connects with Bad Logan's head, but the clone hardly registers the impact AS WE CUT TO : \nINT. ALKALI COMMAND VEHICLE -- COUNTRY ROAD -- CONTINUOUS \nThe tinny transmitted sounds of the violence play off screen as we look at the Munson farmhouse a ways off through a windshield. PAN TO REVEAL-- \nWE'RE IN THE ALKALI COMMAND VEHICLE. PIERCE AND DR. RICE are riveted to a feed from Bad Logan's bodycam. \nPIERCE Your baby boy just took out the most wanted mutey in the world. \nDR. RICE He's fantastic. \nCaliban stares, stricken, his face pressed against the bars in his cage in the rear of the truck. \nCALIBAN You said you wanted the girl! You said you just wanted the girl! \nANOTHER REAVER SMACKS THE CAGE, knocking Caliban down. \nDR. RICE (BRIGHT EYED) I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear. He's just a baby and a bit of a blunt instrument. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                87. \nDR. RICE (CONT'D) But your friends had every chance. And so did you. \nWIDER -- EXT. FARMHOUSE / COUNTRY ROAD -- SAME \nWE SEE THE SEVERAL REAVER/ALKALI VANS nestled in an overgrown section of country road, among them the FLATBED WITH THE BIG BOX. Only the big doors are wide open... WE PAN TO -- \nIn back, Caliban lies on the corrugated steel floor, beaten and bruised. He rises, peering through a slot. He sees: \nLogan emerging from the front door, Charles in his arms. \nCaliban blinks back tears, overcome with guilt, sorrow... \nRice watches eagerly as Bad Logan nears their truck. \nRICE We learned the hard way with the X-23's. We assumed, because they were children, their emotional responses could be manipulated. But you can't nurture rage. You must simply design it. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   90. \nRICE (CONT'D) (SMILES) Like God did. \nPierce spots a SECOND SET OF HEADLIGHTS coming from the other direction, the high-beams bearing down on X-24. \nPIERCE Who the fuck is that? \nEXT. FARMHOUSE -- ON THE ROAD -- CONTINUOUS \nBad Logan now pauses, torn between competing headlights. \nJACKSON (O.S.) Will Munson! \nA broken-nosed JACKSON AND FOUR MEN jump out of his truck. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE -- LOGAN'S PICK UP -- CONTINUOUS \nLogan gently lays Charles in the back of the pick up. He tries to wrap him tighter in the quilt, pulls out his keys. \nLOGAN You need to keep this around you. Charles. Listen, you need-- \nCharles' eyes find Logan. He mutters something. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) --What? \nIn the bg., distant YELLING -- \nJACKSON (O.S.) Munson, goddammit! Come out here! \nEXT. FARMHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nJackson and his men come up the road, armed, pissed. \nJACKSON Come out here now, Munson! \nSome of the men direct Jackson's attention to Bad Logan standing there, staring at them. \nJACKSON (CONT'D) Oh. Hello, asshole. Look. \nINT./EXT. ALKALI TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS \nRice and Pierce react as Bad Logan reverses direction, moving toward Jackson, leaving Laura in the middle of the road. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  91. \nDR. RICE No. No, no. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE ROAD -- CONTINUOUS \nBad Logan keeps walking toward Jackson and his men. \nJACKSON I don't know what Munson's paying you, but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones. We could start you at 5G. A week that is. \nHe keeps walking. They cock their weapons. \nJACKSON (CONT'D) You best stop where you are, pal. We're the law out here. \nJackson fires a blast into X-24's chest but he keeps coming toward him -- SNIKT! -- claws emerging-- \nJACKSON (CONT'D) What in high holy-- \nJackson never completes the thought. X-24 DECAPITATES HIM. \nJACKSON'S MEN REACT IN HORROR, start to run, but he's on them like a sprung beast. \nINT. ALKALI TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS \nDR. RICE, PIERCE and THE REAVERS are fixated on what is happening but THE CAMERA FINDS -- \nCALIBAN, curled in a ball in the back, darkness in his eyes as he watches -- LOGAN at his truck. \nDR. RICE (TO PIERCE) He's confused. We need to intervene. \nPIERCE You're the one he listens to, Doc. \nCUT TO-- LOGAN AT THE PICK-UP \nCharles' finger taps the pick up bed. Logan leans close to hear him say with a trace of a smile... \nCHARLES ...our boat... ...our Eden... Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                92. \nCharles tenderly touches Logan ...and then he passes. \nLogan stares at Charles. Gone. \nWe hear the SHOUTS from Jackson's men as they fall, one by one. Only now does the sound of world seem to seep back in. \nLogan dimly aware of the blood-curdling SCREAMS... He pulls the blanket over Charles, his eyes filling with rage. \nBACK TO LAURA \nINT. CONVERTED HIGH SCHOOL -- SAME \nDr. Rice enters swiftly from a hallway, pushing through plastic drapes as if hoping to lose the collection of government types who follow him into this tented gymnasium. \nMAJOR --and we understand the importance of containment, Dr Rice. But we are in the continental United States. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               102. \nDR. RICE --Yes we are, and I terminated your goddam mutant most wanted. \nMAJOR We appreciate that but you can't just leave a war zone behind like you, like you did in Juarez. We-- \nThe Major and his companions suddenly realize they are moving through a makeshift morgue. TWO DOZEN BODIES laid out as a haz mat team tags them. The bodies are mostly children, slightly off looking mutants. A few we might recognize from Gabriela's video. Also among them, Will, Kathryn, and Nate. \nDR. RICE I'd appreciate it, Major, if your associates would stop staring at the dead assets. Try to remind yourselves these were all little killing machines, machines who would have happily disemboweled your family. \nMAJOR Not all. \nDR. RICE (spins, livid) I was told you want these assets off board, dead or alive. Are you changing my brief?! Are you? \nThe people stop walking. \nMAJOR ...No. \nDR. RICE (SMILES) Okay. Good bye. \nRice heads for a side door, pausing by another table where the BURNED CORPSE OF CALIBAN lies curled. \nDR. RICE (CONT'D) Save tissue from this one. He was a good tracker and had a high IQ. \nINT./EXT. SCHOOL EXIT / TENT INFIRMARY -- SAME \nRice walks out of the school building, blows past an MP and the fleshy nurse, crossing into the infirmary tent. He finds Pierce getting dressed, pulling the IV, grabbing a crutch. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               103. \nDR. RICE You're up? \nPierce hands Rice -- THE WRINKLED PHOTOGRAPH. \nPIERCE Look at that. Was found at the farmhouse. I know. It's her. But look at the other side. \nRice turns it to reveal-- The coordinates in North Dakota. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) Those are the coordinates of a fire road in the Badlands. A reservation near the Border. And, according to Wikipedia, its also this. \nHe hands a tablet with the \"EDEN EXODUS\" X-MEN COMIC cued on the screen. Rice regards it skeptically. Thousands of mutants in Exodus, headed for the Badlands. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) Gaby loved that shit. \nINT. CONVERTED HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM -- SAME \nA MEXICAN WOMAN looks up in terror as a door unlocks. She looks familiar, despite the bruises and blood. An armed guard looks up from a show on his phone. \nDR. RICE Hello, Maria. \nAnd now we recognize the name and face: Maria, the other nurse in Gabriela's video. \nDR. RICE (CONT'D) So I understand that your mother and son are safe at the holding center in Guadalupe. We're looking after them both of them. \nMaria is sickened by the notion. \nMARIA Wh-what more do you want from me? \nRice takes out the tablet containing the X-Men comic. Her blanching expression immediately betrays her: she knows this place, knows what it means... \nDR. RICE Connect the fucking dots, dear. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  104. \nShe looks up at him, gripped by fear. Rice just smiles. \nEXT. WINDING HIGHWAY - DAY \nAs the station wagon moves along winding road through the mountains. It starts to drift off the road... \nINT./EXT. STATION WAGON - HIGHWAY - BADLANDS - DAY \nLogan at the wheel. Laura shoves him and he wakes up, swerves back off the shoulder. She nods to the wheel, speaks Spanish: \nLAURA Let me drive. \nLOGAN No. Absolutely not. \nHe's barely awake. Barely alive, it seems. He's bruised and broken. Blood runs from his sleeve from some unseen cut or cuts on his arm. He turns to see Laura still looking his way. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Quit looking at me. \nLAURA (SPANISH) You're dying. \nLOGAN No comprende. \nLAURA You are dying. \nLogan turns to her. Looks away. To weary to say anything. \nLAURA (CONT'D) You want to die. (off Logan's look) Charles told me. \nLOGAN (REACTS) What else did he tell you? \nLAURA To not let you. \nShe grabs the wheel, pulls to the right, taking them onto the shoulder. Logan tries to fight it but can't. Hits the brakes. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               105. \nLAURA Por que? \nLOGAN I hurt people. \nLaura takes this in. Then pulls something from her pocket. Logan's Adamantium bullet. \nLAURA (IN SPANISH) What is this? \nLOGAN You know what it is. \nLogan nods, tries to sit up. In pain. She hands it to him. He rolls it in his fingers. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) It's made of Adamantium. Same thing they put inside us. That's why it can kill us. Probably killing me now. Anyway, I got that a long time ago. Kept it as a reminder of what I am. Now I keep it to-- (looks at her plainly) Actually, I was thinking about shooting myself with it. Like Charles said. \nLaura's smile fades. \nLAURA I've hurt people too. \nLogan looks off. \nLOGAN You're gonna have to learn how to live with that. \nLAURA They were bad people. \nLOGAN All the same. \nLogan closes his eyes. The bullet sits in his open palm. Laura takes it. \nBLACK. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               109. \nINT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- DAY \nLogan awakes to hear children playing outside. He watches as some of the kids play a simple game of soccer. Suddenly one of the girls wiffs and kicks right past a ball and then continues prancing, her legs kicking high, arms waving like a puppet. Some of the boys laugh. \nGIRL Jonah! Stop! STOP! \nLogan sees little Jonah manipulating the girl like a puppeteer. Everything he does, kicking out his legs, waving his arms, she is somehow forced to do, a mirror image. Some of the other kids come to her defense -- \nLIZARD BOY Jonah, let go! Now! \nIt all ends suddenly when Rictor steps up behind Jonah and slaps him upside the head. \nRICTOR Cut the shit. \nAnother kid kicks the loose ball off the edge of the cliff and REBECCA, runs right off the edge of the cliff to catch the ball, then returns, walking on air. \nLogan lies back in bed. Weak. But looking better. \nBLACK. \nINT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- NIGHT \nFrom across the darkened room, Bobby walks up to Logan. Logan considers him a moment. Bobby holds up an action figures, a vintage toy, the paint chipped. As if expecting a reaction from him. It's a Wolverine figure, then he holds up another. \nBOBBY ...Was Sabretooth real? \nLOGAN What. \nBOBBY Laura said you said all the stories in the comic books were lies. \nLOGAN Not all. Not completely. Sabretooth was real. He was in a program with me. Like what they did to you. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  110. \nBOBBY So you did mean things with him. \nLOGAN Yes. \nBOBBY But now you're doing good things. \nLogan looks at the kid a moment, then-- \nLOGAN Kid, I don't know what I'm doing. \nBLACK. \nINT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- DAY \nThe sound of snipping. Giggles. \nThen we see nearly all the kids standing around Logan's cot with glowing grins on their faces. Laura among them, although she slides into the back of the pack as he sits up. BOBBY AND REBECCA hide scissors behind their backs. \nAnd now we see why. They have cut Logan's beard. Strike that. They have shaped Logan's beard into mutton chops. They have snipped off his moustache and soul patch. He touches his face, guessing what they've done-- and crosses, limping to -- \nTO A MIRROR. They all squeal in joy as he takes in his reflection. Then he glares at them. \nLOGAN Not funny. Not funny at all. \nRictor suddenly hurries through the space, moving from one room to the next. Logan moves after him -- \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Hey, pal, how long have I been out? \nBut Rictor is already moving off outside-- \nEXT. CLIFF TOP -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS \nLogan hobbles after Rictor, who passes Jonah, packing a backpack. \nLOGAN Hey. \nLAURA Such a nice man. \nLOGAN Hey, I never asked for this. \nShe starts to move off again. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Look, I don't know what Charles put in your head, but I'm not... whatever it is you think I am. \nLaura looks off, defiant, hurt. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) You don't need me. You've got Rictor, Delilah, Rebecca, Bobby, blah blah whoever. Hey. It's better this way. I suck at this. Bad shit happens to people I care about. \nLaura meets his eyes. \nLAURA Then I will be fine. \nAnd she walks off. \nON LOGAN, watching her go. Resisting every urge to chase after her-- he SLAMS the door. \nON LAURA OUTSIDE, at the edge of the cliff, looking out at the stars as she wipes her eyes, the faint laughter and noise of the kids nearby. She glances back at Logan's door... then turns to join them. \nINT. TOP OF CLIFF -- BUNK AREA -- PRE-DAWN \nLogan asleep in his corner. He stirs awake. \nHe sees something near his face. A hypodermic and one last vial of the green fluid on top of a backpack. Beside it, a note: \"NOT ALL AT ONCE. - RICTOR\" \nEXT. TOP OF CLIFF -- DAWN \nLogan ventures out by first light. It's eerily quiet here now. All the kids are indeed gone. Laura too. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 115. \nLogan continues walking through the now-abandoned structure, reckoning with the choice he made. \nEXT. EDEN - TOP OF CLIFF - DAWN \nLogan is looking down at his station wagon still parked in the swale -- when he halts. Hears a buzzing, then looks upward and sees -- \nA flock of drones flying by overhead, fanning out. \nINT./EXT. EDEN -- LOOKOUT TOWER -- DAWN \nLogan bursts in, hurries to-- THE TELESCOPE -- the one that Rictor had Laura peer through yesterday. Logan brings his eye to the viewfinder... \nLOGAN'S POV THROUGH TELESCOPE: the same distant mountain and crevasse that Laura had seen, five miles away, looming like a beacon, haloed violet by the rising sun. \nLogan breathes, at once relieved and regretful. About to step away -- when he swings the telescope and sees -- \nLOGAN'S POV THROUGH TELESCOPE: something is moving toward the base of the mountain... black objects, rustling trees... Logan adjusts focus and sees-- \nA CONVOY OF MILITARY AND ALKALI VEHICLES... \nLogan drops back from the telescope-- \nINT. EDEN CLIFF TOP -- BUNK AREA -- MOMENTS LATER \nLOGAN GRABS that vial of green fluid and the needle. Throws them in the backpack, eyes fixed in alarm -- \nEXT. THE WOODS -- DAWN \nLogan bounding through the woods... but he is already out of breath... stumbling... \nUp ahead he starts to hear the echoed cracks of GUNFIRE, children crying out, shrieking-- \nLogan falls to the ground. Gasping, coughing, his wounds starting to reopen. About to lose consciousness, he reaches into the backpack, fumbling with the syringe and the vial. Draws everything in the container and injects himself... \nLogan's eyes go wide as the drug hits his bloodstream. He screams. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               116. \nEXT. DEEPER IN THE WOODS -- DAWN \nIt's a free-for-all as the Reavers descend on their prey -- the kids fleeing in all directions, desperately trying to find cover in the maze of trees, bullets spraying, among those running for their lives, Laura -- \nLIZARD BOY disappears like a chameleon into the bark of a tree to avoid a chasing Reaver. \nOnce the Reaver passes, Lizard Boy steps out from the tree, thinking he is safe, and turns to find Pierce standing there. He fires his side arm into the boy's chest. \nLIZARD BOY Ow. \nLizard boy drops to the ground and Pierce leaves his body to be dragged away by Reavers behind him. \nNOT FAR AWAY IN THE WOODS -- \nDR. RICE rides in a jeep with two soldiers. He watches the battle ahead from a safe distance. Behind him lumbers the Alkali Control Vehicle. \nRICE Move faster. We can't let them get to the border. \nELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS -- \nELLA is cornered by several soldiers, who advance on her. Her eyes roll up in her head as she draws on her powers and -- \nPINE NEEDLES LIFT FROM THE GROUND AND TEAR FROM THE TREES, swirling into a whirlwind. The needles envelope the soldiers in a vortex, blinding them, stabbing them, shredding their skin, filling their mouthes, gagging them. \nA SOLDIER GRABS ELLA from behind, covering her eyes. The needles fall to the ground. As he proceeds to shackle her wrists-- LAURA LEAPS UPON HIM, SPEARING HIM WITH HER CLAWS. \nLaura and Ella run away as other soldiers fire upon them. Laura tries to pull her friend, she is not fast enough. \nLAURA (IN SPANISH) Ella! Run faster! Run! \nRICE'S JEEP COMES TO A STOP BEHIND PIERCE. \nLaura looks to-- Logan, clutching for air. \nPIERCE Green juice is wearing down, huh? For an ol' mute, that a short high. Gonna be hard to keep those claws out soon. \nRICTOR (thrashing, to Logan) Waste this dick, Logan! \nPierce knocks Rictor unconscious with the butt of his gun, then aims the muzzle at Rictor's head. He looks back up at-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               120. \nLogan, weak, standing there. Dr. Rice steps up behind Pierce. \nDR. RICE Please stop, Mr. Howlett, or I am going to have to tell these men to fire on these children. You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off. You will not survive any further wounds. \nLogan glares at Rice, glances at Laura as she encircles the remaining Reavers guarding her friends. \nDR. RICE (CONT'D) It's an honor to meet you. I'm Zander Rice. I believe you knew my father on the Weapon X program. \nLogan's dark look goes darker. He holds up his bloody claws. \nLOGAN He's the asshole who put this poison in me. \nDR. RICE Yes he was. One of them. \nLOGAN I think I might have killed him. \nDR. RICE I think you're right. \nPIERCE Shit. Show some respect, mutey. You're lookin' at the man who wiped out your kind. \nDR. RICE My friend Donald overstates. The goal was not ending mutant-kind but controlling it. I realized we needn't stop perfecting what we eat and drink when we could use those products to perfect ourselves. \nLaura sneaks closer to two of the Reavers, poised to attack. \nDR. RICE (CONT'D) To distribute gene therapy discreetly, through, well, everything -- from sweet drinks to breakfast cereal. And it worked.

And we embarked on our next endeavor. \nLogan's eyes drift from Pierce to Rice to Laura, claws out. \nLOGAN Growing mutants of your own. \nPIERCE Dangerous times, James. We can't trust fate to-- \nHe lifts his pistol AND SHOOTS ZANDER RICE IN THE HEAD. The Doctor falls back, dead, in the grass. \nLOGAN Yeah. Dangerous. \nTwo Reavers lunge for their weapons but Laura surprises them, slitting their throats as-- \nLOGAN SHOOTS AGAIN, BLOWING OFF PIERCE'S CYBORG HAND-- and he is about to shoot a kill-shot on Pierce but the pistol clicks, its chamber empty. \nPierce turns and runs towards the Alkali control truck. \nLogan stumbles after him, claws out now. \nPierce grabs hold of the control van door, throws it open-- \nPIERCE It's showtime, boy! \nAND A HUGE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE VAN, BLIND-SIDING LOGAN. \nIt is X24 and he slashes at Logan mercilessly. The fight between them is bloody and feral. \nLaura watches, terrified. \nLogan struggles to stay on his feet, but there is fear in his eyes. He doesn't know if he can hold his own against this younger stronger version of himself. \nThe commotion distracts the two Reavers guarding the children who raise their weapons. \nA THIRD REAVER lines up a shot, putting Logan in his cross hairs, when he is suddenly taken out by Laura. \nSensing their attention is elsewhere, young Bobby shifts his weight, extending his finger, eyes rolling in his head as -- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               122. \nAN ELECTRICAL BOLT ARCS OFF HIS FINGER leaping to the jeep, ELECTROCUTING THE TWO REAVER GUARDS. \nLaura turns back as-- \nX-24 GRABS LOGAN AND TOSSES HIM LIKE A RAG DOLL into open door of the control van. \nBleary, Logan grabs the fallen door, summons his remaining strength and smashes X24 with it, knocking the monster to the dirt. Logan reaches deep, bringing the iron door down like a guillotine on X-24's throat. \nRictor come to consciousness in the grass, his eyes finding-- \nX24, pinned on the ground, struggling to breathe, the van door pressing against his neck. X24 catches sight of Dr. Rice, his fallen master. \nPierce watches, his survival riding on X24's ability to get up and defeat Logan. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) Get up! Get up, boy! That's right! He killed your Daddy! \nX24 howls in rage and breaks Logan's hold, leaping at Logan, mauling him and hurling his limp, bloody body beyond the jeeps. \nSatisfied with himself, X24 is shocked when-- \nRICTOR Laura! No! \nLAURA LEAPS ON X24'S BACK and slashes at him. \n", "test1_input": "The MOTEL MANAGER flees to her office. \nGABRIELA (panicked, terrified) Don't let her call anyone. They will find us.

In Mexico City. \nLogan watches as Gabriela lifts her sleeve, takes things from the kit, ministering to her wound. \nLOGAN When did that happen? \nGABRIELA This morning. Near the border. I got away from them. But they know my car now. \nShe reaches for the NIGHT STAND, pries open its cheap side paneling, and pulls out a bloody envelope hidden there. Hands it to Logan. There's an address on the outside and a set of numbers beneath it. Inside, bundles of greenbacks. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                21. \nGABRIELA (CONT'D) Take it. Please.

Logan crosses to the door to Gabriela's room. He knocks. \nLOGAN Ready to go? \nBut he gets no answer, his eyes finding the splintered wood around the doorjamb. He pushes the door open... Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   24. \nINT. LIBERTY MOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nThe room has been trashed. Blood everywhere. The bed is empty. Gabriela is tied to a chair, eyes unblinking, face blue, body riddled with bullets and cuts. \nLOGAN ...Fuck. \nLogan makes a sweep of the room. Then recalls -- \nThe NIGHT STAND. Pries the side panel free. There, wedged in the gap-- A PHONE IN A PINK CASE. He takes it. \nSees her last text was to him. \"Please hurry...\" He pockets the phone. \nEXT. LIBERTY MOTEL - MORNING - RAIN \nLogan closes the door behind him and steps into the rain, scanning the lot. No sign of the girl anywhere. \nHe looks down, noticing gouges on the concrete, slashes, filling with rain and blood. Then he spots -- \nA BLOODY CYBORG FINGER on the pavement. High Tech. Severed at the knuckle, wires trailing. He picks it up. The fuck? \nSIRENS BEGINS TO RISE. He quickly crosses to his car, now noticing the MOTEL MANAGER DEAD BY THE VENDING MACHINES. \nEXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT -- DAY \nLogan barrels through the gate and screeches to a stop. Gets out and heads for the small structure behind the tank that contains his bedroom-- \nCALIBAN Hello! Logan! --What happened? \nCaliban rounds the corner in his big hat and goggles, approaching from his \"garden\" with a bunch of beets. Logan starts to climb the steps but turns as Caliban follows. \nCALIBAN (CONT'D) Did something go wrong? \nLOGAN (moving away again) The job was wrong to begin with. \nCaliban turns away with a sigh, heading to the main building. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                25. \nCALIBAN I'll close your trunk. --I'm making borscht for Charles if you want some. He got dressed for lunch \nThis is when Logan pauses and comes back down the steps looking out to his limo, TRUNK OPEN, Caliban approaching it. \nEXT. SMELTING PLANT -- A MOMENT LATER \nCaliban reaches, ABOUT TO SHUT THE TRUNK-- WHEN LOGAN'S HAND STOPS HIM. Logan peers inside. \nA CHILD'S BACKPACK. He grabs it. Unzips it. MEDICAL FILES. COMIC BOOKS. A PLASTIC HORSE. Other trinkets. Then he notices something in the trunk bed. A RUBBER BALL. The girl's ball. \nCALIBAN ...Who does that belong to? \nThat's when Logan hears a sound and looks to-- A JEEP APPROACHING ON THE HORIZON. Pierce's Jeep. \nCALIBAN (CONT'D) Who's that? \nLOGAN Aren't you supposed to see shit coming? \nCALIBAN I'm a glorified truffle pig, not a clairvoyant. \nLOGAN Go inside. Keep Charles quiet. (DEAD SERIOUS) Go. Inside. \nCaliban shuffles away as-- \nLogan watches the JEEP TURN ONTO THE GROUNDS and come to a stop in a dust cloud. Donald Pierce climbs out in a windbreaker. He approaches, taking in the property. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) You need to turn around, asshole. This is private property. \nPIERCE (laughs, comes closer) Yes, it is. In fact, I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company based in Shanghai. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 26. \nPIERCE (CONT'D) (SMILES) Where you keeping the old man? In there? Or there. I'd like to meet him. I'm told HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now. `Damned shame, what happened back east. \nLOGAN He's been dead for a year. \nPierce doesn't look convinced. Or all that interested. \nPIERCE I need the girl. \nLOGAN What girl. \nPIERCE One that goes with that ball you're holding. That's special rubber, you know. Coated with something called J-Tek. Gets in through the skin. (FAUX SERIOUS) Very calming. Like Magnesium but without the side effects. (SMILES) You feel calmer? \nLOGAN There's no girl here. \nAnother laugh, then-- \nPIERCE I know you went to the motel. \nLOGAN I was called there. There was no girl. Just the woman. \nPIERCE \"The woman\". (SIGHS) Such as she was. (LOOKS UP) So you saw Gabriela but you didn't call me? (sticks out lower lip) That hurts. Say, you didn't shoot the poor thing, did you? Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                27. \nLOGAN No. Did you? \nPIERCE I asked you first. \n", "test2_input": "Caliban just looks back at him. Shudders. \nRED-HAIRED MAN (CONT'D) The girl is a rather small price to pay for that. Unlike you, she's not pure. She wasn't made by nature. She's a mistake of my own. A killer bee who's escaped from the hive. And I need to get her back before she stings. \nCALIBAN What do you want from me?! I did what I could and your human toaster ovens fucked it all up. \nThe man smiles. \nRED-HAIRED MAN I agree the Reavers have not been effective. I'm bringing new tools to bear. But I still need someone to point us in the right direction. \nCALIBAN No, no, no. I can't keep-- \nRED-HAIRED MAN Breathe. Breathe. What does he have, the old man, your friend? Alzheimer's? ALS? A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain. What a combo. \nThe man considers Caliban a moment, then reaches in his bag. \nDR. RICE You pay a high price for your gifts, my friend. Too bad you and I didn't meet years ago. I could have saved you some pain. I have something for your blisters. (pulling a vial of creme) My name is Dr. Rice, by the way. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  72. \nDR. RICE (CONT'D) (meets his eyes) You can call me Zander if you like. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThe Munson family and the \"Howlett\" family all sit around a table covered with food, heads bowed as the son says grace. All except Laura who looks around at the family pictures, the religious decorations (they are everywhere), the warm furnishings. Another strange place. \nNATE We thank you, Lord, for this food... and we also thank you, Lord, for sending our new friends, the Howletts to our aid today. Amen. \nThey all dig in. Laura eats like a wild animal, and the Munsons pause to watch. Charles puts a hand on her arm. \nCHARLES Slow down, child. \nShe looks around at the others, all of whom smile at her, then slows down. \nKATHRYN There's plenty more if you want. \nWILL Where are you all heading? \nLOGAN Oregon. \nCHARLES South Dakota. \nThey look at each other. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Oregon, then South Dakota. \nKATHRYN Vacation? \nCHARLES Yes. Long overdue. We're city folk. Always wanted to take a road trip, see the country. (smiles at them) Meet the people who live in it. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                73. \nLogan looks up at Charles. Watches him. The old man having himself a good time. \nKATHRYN That sounds lovely. I've been trying to get Will here to take a vacation for years now. \nWILL And if we go out traipsing around the country, who's gonna take care of this place? \nKATHRYN Exactly. I say, let it go. \nWILL And live off what? \nKATHRYN The Lord will provide. \nWILL Well, I'm still waiting for him to provide me with a new thresher. \nKATHRYN (smiles at Charles) All the same, I'd love to travel someday. \nCHARLES And I bet you will. \nNATE I could drop out of school. \nKATHRYN Let's not go that far. \nFriendly laughter around the table. THE SOUND FADES. PASSAGE OF TIME AS Laura watches the ritual of Family Dinner. Studies it. She's never really seen a family. Or, for that matter, a teenage boy. She keeps her eyes fixed on him. \nThen as DINNER FINISHES AND CLEAN UP BEGINS-- \nCHARLES Kathryn, that was easily the best meatloaf I've ever had. \nKATHRYN Thank you, Chuck. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                74. \nCharles gives Logan a look across the table. Kathryn turns to Logan now. Smiles. \nKATHRYN (CONT'D) What about you, James. Are you married? \nLOGAN Oh. I uh, I-- \nWILL Kathryn. \nKATHRYN What? It's a natural thing to ask. \nCHARLES He was. She passed. \nKATHRYN Oh, I'm so sorry. \nWill gives her a look that says, See? That's why you don't ask shit like that! \nCHARLES He killed her. \nLogan looks up at Charles. An awkward beat. Then they all burst out laughing. Logan considers Charles across the table. Was that Dementia? A joke? \n", "test2_true": "LOGAN (STANDS) Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for dinner. But we have a long drive ahead of us. \nKATHRYN You need to rest, don't you? \nLOGAN We'll find a motel. \nWILL Nearest is two hours from here and it's not very-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                75. \nKATHRYN They're gonna stay here. We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your daughter and father and you can sleep in the living room on the convertible. \nLOGAN Kathryn. That's very nice of you, but we really should hit the-- \nCHARLES We could leave first thing in the morning. Crack of dawn as it were. \nLogan grabs Charles' wheelchair. \nLOGAN Let's go wash up, Pop. \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- BATHROOM -- SAME \nLogan counts out two pills to Charles who finishes splashing water on his face, and grabs a towel. They whisper. \nCHARLES --two days on the road with one meal and hardly any sleep. She's eleven and I'm fucking ninety. \nLOGAN That's a hundred and one reasons to keep moving. \nCHARLES I'm not a box of avocados. \nLOGAN And then what. We stay the night and then what? \nCHARLES We take Laura to her friends in Eden and then... then we buy that Sunseeker. \nLogan just stares back at him, hands him his pills, goes to fill a cup of water. The faucet sputters and spits air. The pipes shudder all through the house. \nWILL (O.S.) Goddamnit. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   76. \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- HALLWAY \nLogan emerges from the bathroom, Charles follows. \nLOGAN What is it? \nWILL Nate, go fill up the tub before we lose pressure. \nNate dutifully rushes into the bathroom, starts the tub. \nKATHRYN (crosses to the window) They shut it off again. \nLOGAN Who's \"they?\" \nLaura steps into the hall. \nKATHRYN (TO WILL) You best deal with it now. \nWILL It can wait till morning. We got rain last night. \nKathryn gently touches Will's arm. Her hand slides down to his. Laura is fascinated by the simple gesture. \nKATHRYN Will. We have three guests in this house and sink full of dishes. \nWILL Alright. You're right. (explaining to Logan) The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here. Sometimes it gets itself shut off. \nNATE By assholes. \nWill gives his son a look. Charles gives Logan a look. \nCHARLES My son can go with you. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                77. \nWILL Oh, no. Thank you. But these men who did this, they can be-- \nNATE I'll come. \nKATHRYN No. You have homework. \nLOGAN I'll go. \nKathryn and Logan meet eyes. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Just let me get my dad... settled. \nLogan wheels Charles toward the stairs. Nate passes them and stomps up the steps. Laura watches. \nINT. FARMHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nLaura comes to the top of the stairs and looks at Charles' empty wheel chair in the hallway. Logan carries Charles into a lit bedroom at the end of the hall. A sweet sight. \nLaura turns looking in the cracked door of Nate's bedroom. \nINT. GUEST BEDROOM -- SAME \nInside the guest room, Logan tucks Charles in. Charles looks out the window beside the bed. The moon over the silos. \nLOGAN There's a TV in here. \nCHARLES (SMILES GENTLY) I'm fine. \nLOGAN Okay... Get some rest. \n", "test3_input": "EXT. WYOMING HIGHWAY - DAYS \nLogan and Laura head north under a sign that reads: \n\"WELCOME TO WYOMING.\" \nEXT. STAND OF TREES, OFF THE ROAD - WYOMING LAKE - MORNING \nOverlooking a small lake. LOGAN finishes covering CHARLES' GRAVE. Its physically hard for him to do this. Now he stands there, trying to think of what to say. He looks at-- \nLAURA, on the other side of the grave, a few steps back. She takes her sunglasses off. Takes the ear buds out of her ears. Ready to hear his words. \nBACK TO-- LOGAN. He looks back at the grave, then out at the lake. Clears his throat. His eyes are sallow, his skin pale. \nLOGAN Well. It's got water and... it's... \nLogan just halts. He looks down and sees-- Laura, taking his hand in hers, the same way that Kathryn did with Will at the farmhouse. She looks up at him. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) --its got water and it's -- \nUnable to contain himself, Logan pulls back his hand. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) ...Fuck this... \nHe starts away, limping, with the shovel. Only now do we realize just how ravaged Logan's body still is from his battle with X-24. Blood stains everywhere. \nLaura stands there, staring as-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                96. \nLogan stumbles to the equally ravaged pick up truck. He tosses the shovel in back and grunts something at Laura like \"come on!\" When she doesn't move, he curses and gets in the truck but it won't turn over. He starts cursing again and gets out and pops the hood. \nA dog barks. Laura looks out across the landscape. \nDownstream a quarter mile, A MAN crosses from a STATION WAGON with his labrador, pole on his shoulder, tackle box in hand. \nLaura looks back down to Logan. He has collapses in front of the car in a heap. \nINT. URGENT CARE CENTER - TREATMENT ROOM - DAY \nLogan lies, hooked to an IV on a small bed. He coughs and opens his eyes. He is in the examination room of some sort of small town walk-in clinic. The place is decorated in a Rocky Mountain style. Out the windows, granite peaks. An Old Doctor stands over him. He has a soulful face, a bolo tie and big belt buckle. Reminds one of Richard Farnsworth. \nOLD DOCTOR Welcome back. I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell that nice little girl out in the waiting room that her daddy's gone. \nLogan notices the EKG monitor connected to him. The Doctor sits down and smiles... \nOLD DOCTOR (CONT'D) I always hoped I would get a chance to meet someone like you. There's so few of you left. \nLOGAN ...Nice to meet you too, Doc, but I need to get on my-- \nHe tries to sit up, but the old doctor puts a hand on him. \nOLD DOCTOR What you need is rest... and treatment. You need to check yourself in somewhere and-- \nLOGAN --I'm alright. I'm fine. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  97. \nOLD DOCTOR No. You're not. I mean, I know you're different. But that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you. You need to check yourself into a hospital and run some tests, find out what it is. \nLOGAN ...I know what it is. \nLogan pulls off the wires and tubes and gets up. \nINT. URGENT CARE CENTER - WAITING ROOM - DAY \nLogan limps into the waiting area. Laura is sitting there. A Nurse looks up as the Doctor emerges, right behind him-- \nOLD DOCTOR Please. Mister. If you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can-- \nLOGAN --Doc. Look at me. You seem like a nice man. But you wanna save a life? Save yours. And everyone else's in this place. Let us get on our way. \nLogan turns to-- Laura. She meets his eyes. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Let's go. \nEXT. URGENT CARE CENTER - DAY \nLogan and Laura emerge from the Mountain clinic with a big sign with a red cross on it. Laura leads him, limping to-- \nTHE FISHERMAN'S STATION WAGON. Yet another commandeered vehicle. She hands him the keys with a lure fob. \nLOGAN You can't just take shit, you know. \nHe opens the driver's door and finds a booster seat made from bundled cardboard and a box of milkbones. Logan looks at Laura climbing in on the passenger side. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   98. \nINT./EXT. STATION WAGON - URGENT CARE CENTER - DAY \nLogan tosses the booster pile to the back and climbs in, brushing away dog hair. He starts the station wagon, but before pulling out, turns to her. \nLOGAN Look. I don't know how you got me here,.. but thank you. \nLAURA De nada. \nHe stares back at her. She stares back at him. Finally. \nLOGAN ...You can talk? \nLAURA (NODS) \nLOGAN You can talk. \n", "test3_true": "LOGAN What the fuck?! Why haven't you-- What's all this bullshit been for the last two thousand miles of-- \nBut she's already spitting out words in Spanish, fast. \nLAURA Tu espera que hable con tu cuando no mirarme? Tu espera que hable con tu cuando me insultas y tratar de dejarme atr\u00e1s!?-- \nLOGAN SHUT THE FUCK UP!!! \nShe stops. She stares at Logan a moment, then very slowly in accented English begins to recite: \nLAURA Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor. \nLOGAN Who is that? Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 99. \nLaura pulls out THE ENVELOPE OF CASH and points to the address and coordinates on it. \nLAURA North Dakota. (THEN) Por favor. (THEN REPEATS) Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor. \nLOGAN Okay. Look. This place. Your mom... she read too many... stories. \nLaura just ignores him, reaches into her backpack and takes out the comic, opens it.. Shows him an image of the idyllic Box Canyon... \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Yeah, I know... I saw it... \nShe holds up another picture from the page he'd read in the bar, another drawing showing \"Eden.\" \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Right. This place does not exist. No exist-o. It's fictional. (jabs the page) Eden does not exist. \nLAURA Si, Eden, por favor. \nLOGAN (STARTS COUGHING) No. I am saying that place is imaginary. It's a fantasy. See that RIGHT THERE-- (points at cover, authors) --those are the names of the people who made up these stories. Something happened once and these people made it into a big lie... \nLaura bursts out with more Spanish-- \nLAURA Le pagaron me llevo a este lugar! \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no puedes llevarme a este lugar! Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               100. \nThen, exasperated, rummages through her pack. He sits there, too tired to fight, watches as she comes up with a MAP. She points to where they are, and to where they need to go. \nLOGAN Yes, I know. It's a long way. \nShe punches him in the arm. Hard. \nLOGAN (CONT'D) Okay. First-- ow. Second, Look at me. I'm fucked up. That's two days driving from here. \nShe smacks the map. \nLAURA Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor. \nLOGAN Stop saying those names-- \nShe again punches him in the arm. \nLAURA Vaminos! \nShe goes to punch him again. He catches her fist. \nLOGAN Do. Not. Hit. Me. \nLAURA Jonah, Gideon-- \nLOGAN --And stop saying those-- \nLAURA --Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor. \nShe won't stop saying the names. A broken record. \nLOGAN Okay-- ENOUGH. Enough. \nShe puts his hand on the wheel. \nINT. TENTED INFIRMARY -- DAY \nFind Pierce in a gown, upright on a field hospital bed, hooked to an IV, skin covered with burn salve and gauze. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               101. \nHis stumped arm is exposed, doing its best to help his good hand repair A CYBORG HAND which sits on the overbed. As he glances out a side window, he tosses a screwdriver back to-- \nA FLESHY NURSE standing over him, fumbling with a tool box. \nPIERCE That ain't a torx, honey. That's a phillips head. I need a torx. \nPierce glances again out the side window -- into the parking lot of a rural high school, cordoned off, thick with military vehicles, issue sedans, a command trailer and dome tents. Outside the trailer, Dr. Rice is getting harangued by a group of MILITARY BRASS and INTEL / CONTRACTOR TYPES. \nNURSE This? Or this. They look the same. \nPierce snatches the tool he needs from the nurse and in two strokes, fixes his cyborg hand. Wiggles the fingers. Goes immediately to work, grabbing AN EVIDENCE FOLDER. \nInside is a collection of documents from the farmhouse, among them, Laura's wrinkled photograph. \nHE PULLS IT CLOSE-- Gabriela and the X-23 kids. And another nurse, Maria, the one who sang on birthdays. He turns the photo over to read the scrawl on the back, then sees something else, something that makes his eyes bright. \nMILITARY NURSE Wow. Responsive. \nPIERCE What? \nMILITARY NURSE Your hand. Its amazing. \nPIERCE Get the fuck out of here. This shit's classified. \n"}

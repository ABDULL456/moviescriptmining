The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS are stunned. Speechless. 
The YOUNG UNIFORMED COP rushes out of the MARKET, GUN raised in one hand, BEER CAN in the other. He's relieved that a cop wasn't shot, but the whole situation makes him uneasy. 
LT grabs the BEER, points to the KOREAN OWNER. 
LT (orders the Cop) Take this guy down to the Precinct. I need to talk to him. 
The OWNER protests wildly in Korean as the flustered COP ushers him into a waiting SQUAD CAR. They drive off.

LT Gimme the money! Now! 
The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS have regained some of their cool.

LT Give me the fucking money, assholes! 
They give LT the CASH. The KIDS stand there. 
LT What the fuck are ya standing there for? Be gone! 
The KIDS, stunned, split. 
LT swaggers around the store, GUN in hand, drinking the BEER, assessing the inventory with a proprietary air. He pretends to SHOOT at various products. Plays around. 
In the back aisle, LT aims his GUN at a BIG BOX of TOILET PAPER. 
While he holds the TOILET PAPER at bay, a THIRTEEN YEAR-OLD KOREAN KID rises up from behind it, his hands up, terrified. 
LT LAUGHS, then puts the GUN away. 
LT Take over until your boss gets back. Gimme a 6 of Diet Cokes and a 6 of Budweiser. 
On LT's smiling face, we --

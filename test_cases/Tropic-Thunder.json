AND YOU \nGOT ZERO 0' HUNDRED HOURS TO GET YOUR ASS \nON THIS CHOPPER BEFORE YOU JOIN HIM! Osiris, standing on the skid, motions for the chopper pilot to take off. \nTropic Thunder 6.

FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN from the \"Scorcher\" trailer, . burst through the treeline, half limping, half crawling heroically through the massive firefight in SLOW MOTION. He is being chased.by about-FIFTY _VIET...CONG SOLDIERS... Everyone on board seems mesmerized. Osiris sees it, and can't believe his eyes... nevertheless, he screams to the pilot. I \nOSIRIS \nGO! GO! Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs the chopper's runner, and in a superhuman show of strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might, preventing it from flying away. The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm, providing weak cover for Four Leaf. The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle with the helicopter. Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is fighting a losing battle to gain ground... He doesn't even have a gun... \nTropic Thunder 7. Osiris looks at the dejected faces of his men, then at Fats... a flash of anger and compassion comes over his face.. . FOUR\"LEAF, Christ-like and arms extended, sinks to his knees, his body now absorbing unbelievable amounts of lead... \nOSIRIS \nI HOPE YOU FAGGOTS LIKE HAMBURGER BECAUSE \nTHAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA BE \nCODY Is that the signal? \nTropic Thunder 11. The assistant doesn't appear to,understand English. He shrugs. Frustrated, Cody rips out an earpiece. \nCODY \nDAMIEN! IS THAT THE SIGNAL? \nBACK ON THE ACTORS 'IYd \"' Damien has his hands full with Speedman. \nSPEEDMAN (above the din of the \nCHOPPER) Dorf! Seriously, I think we should cut. I mean, Should Osiris be crying too? Maybe he shouldn't cry if I'm crying... Lazarus abruptly drops Speedman from his arms and gets up, shaking his head. \nLAZARUS I'm sorry, so, just keep crying or are'we cutting?? \nDAMIEN No, no, it's good. Portnoy is walking around massaging his butt. \nPORTNOY Damien, I think I broke my ass. Is it possible to break your ass? \nDAMIEN Get back in character Portnoy! Still rolling everyone! (to Lazarus) Great crying Kirk -- stay with that. Chris Michael, don't worry about where Kirk is at, just be Four Leaf crying right here and now and still rolling... and GO! \nSPECIAL EFFECTS PYRO COMMAND AREA Cody's crew buzzes around him in a countdown to Armageddon... \nCODY Did he say \"go\"?

I III I. 11h.\" \nLazarus gets back in position. He effortlessly turns.the waterworks back on, sobbing like .,a broken man. Speedman .starts to get back into position and then :-- \nSPEEDMAN Wait, hey, y'know, maybe- is it the line? \"You are my brothers\"? I don't think I would.say that. Four Leaf wouldn't say that. \nDAMIEN Yes, well-you see, Four Leaf was there and he did say that. So... Right. So let's just go... \nSPEEDMAN Is he here, or is he-'at the.hotel? Because I would love to run it by him. \n1ST AD Damien! The chopper! I got to let them go! We,need to pull the plug on the treeline burst if you're cutting! \nLAZARUS You know what, this is nuts. You got my take. I'm done. (to Speedman) Movie star. We'll be here till Chinese New Year waitin.' for my man to. cry. \nDAMIEN Kirk! Wait!

MOTOWN, who is played by rap superstar and budding media mogul REDYKULOUS, pulls the phone out and checks his text message. \nREDYKULOUS Hey, can we get this going? I got peeps coming to my room to rub me down at 4. Bitches, too. His phone rings again. \nINT. BANK - SCENE FROM \"CHITLIN AND THE DUDE\" \nSpeedman'and Martin Lawrence, both with guns, are holding up a bank -- Speedman in drag. They yell at each other in that uptight-white-guy/loose-cannon-black-guy action comedy style. \nJULIE (V:O.) The disappointing \"CHITLIN AND THE DUDE\", was followed.with last year's failed venture into serious dramatic territory... \nEXT. PONY FARM - SCENE FROM \"SIMPLE JACK\" - DAY \n:Speedman,..innoveralls and with a bad haircut, dressed as a farm hand. He holds a pony_by the reins as he \"talks\" to it by rubbing his nose on the pony's neck. \nJULIE (V.0.) .\"Simple Jack\", the story-of a mentally impaired farm hand who can \"talk\" to animals was a box office disaster that many critics called one of the worst movies of all time. \nSPEEDMAN (as Simple Jack) You mu-mu-muhhh make me'ha-aaaapy. \nTropic Thunder 17. \nEXT. TROPIC THUNDER SET -- DAY \nJULIE (to camera) But now, the question is can Speedman \"mu- mu-make\" audiences happy in the true life story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in \"Tropic Thunder\". And,' possibly a shot \u00e2\u0080\u009e 1. -4416 at that elusive gold statuette? \nEXT. TROPIC THUNDER SET -- DAY \nJulie sits with Speedman. With them is the real FOUR LEAF, a stoic, grizzled man of few words. \nSPEEDMAN (very serious) All I want is to make the real Four Leaf here proud. It's his story, he lived it and wrote it in his book. That's why we're here. But really, I mean, how cah we begin to understand what he-- what you --went through? Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only two HOOKS. Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying to \"get inside\" him as much as possible. \nFOUR LEAF \n(MYSTICAL) When I lost these... (holds his hooks up) It was as if I saw through these for the first time..'. (indicates his eyes) And it was only then that I really began to use these... (indicates his ears) \nSPEEDMAN That's great. He's like a... Buddha or something. Maybe I should rub his belly for luck! He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it funny. \n,Tropic Thunder 18. \nJULIE (to Speedman) Like for a lucky Oscar nod this time? Maybe you should rub Kirk Lazarus's belly! He already has three! Speedman laughs uncomfortably, trying to seem unperturbed. i \"I' 0, nM y \nL \nCUT TO: \nA SERIES OF SHOTS OF KIRK LAZARUS In his normal.look, CAUCASIAN and IRISH, much like he was in the \"Satan's Alley\" trailer... \n- JULIE (V.0.) Three time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus, reclusive, brilliant Irishman, considered by many.'the best actor of his generation, and also a known bad boy... Stills of a DRUNKEN LAZARUS outside a New York Bar, punching a paparazzo... \nJULIE . is famous for his total immersion into whatever role he plays. To.transform into the role of the African American Sergeant who saved_Four Leaf's life... \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE \nLazarus is examined by a doctor. \nAJULIE (V.0.) Lazarus-went - to shocking, and controversial lengths... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - A FEW WEEKS LATER \nLazarus lies in a hospital bed,, covered in bandages. \nJULIE After undergoing experimental pigmentation alteration procedures in a Singapore clinic, this was the startling result. \nTropic Thunder 19. A doctor dversees as nurses carefully peel the bandages off Lazarus's head. Lazarus is now Black. \nINT.''TROPIC THUNDER PRE-SHOOT PRESS CONFERENCE \nVOICE OF TODD We're shutting you down, Dorf. \nINT. PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY \nDamien sits behind his desk, looking scared. Vietnam photos, maps, and sketches cover the walls. Standing in the office are ASSORTED CREW, including Cody and Four Leaf, who whittles a stick with his hooks, never looking up. \nTropic Thunder 22. They are all staring at a speaker phone. \nDAMIEN You can't do that Todd. \nVOICE OF TODD I Yes we can.. The dailies are not good. \nDAMIEN Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good movie! Isn't that what they say? \nVOICE OF TODD I never heard that saying. Look, Damien. Fact: You're. three weeks behind and you've been shooting for five days. Fact: we greenlit this project at a very specific number, a number Walter and I could get in bed. with, and fact--. \nDAMIEN ,. _. (starting to lose it) Todd, it really isn't necessary for you to,keep saying \"fact\" before everything. It's kind of implied, that if you are saying.it-- \nVOICE OF TODD Alright.. I'm just.trying to keep the emotion out of it, so I thought I would say.\"fact\" before each fact, so it would be less-upsetting -- I \nVOICE OF WALTER Ok, Damien, this is Walter, I'm just gonna jump in.and bad-cop.it here for a second. Dude, I mean, 46,000 dollars for Chris Michael Speedman's masseuse's miscellaneous living expenses? It sounds like the inmates are running the asylum. \nDAMIEN Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if- you actually came out here you would see that .these actors are-- \nVOICE OF TODD (loud out of'nowhere) The actors didn't blow up the rainforest and forget to turn on the camera Damien! I have a lot of tolerance, but when. Lt comes to nature I lose it! \n(MORE) \nTropic Thunder 23. \nR \nIN \u00e2\u0096\u00ba VOICE OF TODD (cont'd) I will not be called an eco-terrorist, do you understand that? Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young assistant comes in with a cell phone. \nHOT YOUNG ASSISTANT Sorry. (whispering to Damien) It's Chris Michael, he says it's important. Damien, shaking now, steps out on to the balcony and slides the glass door shut. \nEXT. RUNDOWN BALCONY -- DAY \nThough the hotel is a shambles, the view out on to the bay is spectacular. \nDAMIEN (trying to seem calm) Yes, Chris!? \nEXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE \nIn stark contrast to the hotel where everyone else is living, Speedman is in what looks like an Asian presidential palace overlooking the ocean. SPEEDMAN is standing on the deck, trying hard to hold the, phone with his hook hands. \"Simple Jack\" plays on a flat screen inside. \nSPEEDMAN Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way. I know today was rough, and you're probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots, but that's the way these movies go. We all boot it from time to time, and today was just one of those days. Happens. \nDAMIEN (sickly sweet) Yes it does. It does. Though I do think you have to realize Chris, that you are somewhat responsi-- \nTropic Thunder 24. \nSPEEDMAN Oh, also needed to let you know, and I. .know you're like wrapped up with the movie, but I really need that new chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening. This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I \nDAMIEN' Right. well those things... those. 4, \nthings ...I'm dealing with bigger issues right now Chris -- \nSPEEDMAN Yeah, of course, I just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D. \nSPEEDMAN Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec, D? He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the hooks. \nTropic Thunder 34. SPEEDMAN (,cont'd) That's a quote from my children's book, \"The Boy Everybody-Was Jealous Of.\" I know it's just a book for. kids, but I think it applies to.making a movie as well. 'Course... I know a lot of the reason things are maybe messed up is ME. The guys look at each other -- maybe he's not so bad. \nSPEEDMAN I was looking-at it all backwards. You guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you, to help you gel, and straighten.up -- like a PLATOON! A long beat. \nPORTNOY (drunk out of his mind) Hey,. Speedman! That bullshit pep'talk made me.H-h-h-h-h-happy! The entire party cuts.up.in loud hysterics. Speedman looks hurt. The DJ puts on-a Redykulous track really loud, and the, place gets even crazier. \nEXT. BEACH - LATER \nDamien, drunk, walks along, illuminated by the light of the moon. He holds' a bottle of wine, which.he chugs..In the distance, the party rages. \nFOUR LEAF-CO .. S . ) When a herd loses its way, the shepherd must kill the bull that leads them astray.. Damien turns around., startled. FOUR LEAF is standing eerily in the bushes by the sand. \nFOUR LEAF You don't know which way is up, do you private`? You couldn't find a dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick. and showin' you the way... Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant. Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes. Damien's eyes widen in fear. \n,I \nI \u00e2\u0080\u009eTropic Thunder 35. \nFOUR LEAF A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest can cleave that mountain to make the valley, and an army of ants can fell the mighty buffalo. \nDAMIEN (seeing the wisdom of this) Yes... \nFOUR LEAF If the lion, although king of the jungle, is thrown into the sea, he will drown... but...if... \n(PAUSE) He...lives in the...water, for many years, he will.. .grow gills ... . do you understand? (long pause) \nDO YOU!? He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the collar with both hooks. ' \nDAMIEN (near tears now) I want to!!! But not really!! \n(BEAT) Someone's an ANT? Or something??? \nFOUR LEAF I put my story in your limp Brit hands and you will not fail me!! (long pause) My boys were worse pussies than these guys. But the shit is what made us a unit. A whole. You must put them in the \nSHIT. He releases Damien and takes a large draw on his cigarette... \nFOUR LEAF There's a place. About a hundred clicks from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties. Nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the size of melons. Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his weirdness. \nTropic Thunder 36. \nDAMIEN And...? \nFOUR LEAF Rig up your documentary cameras'in that jungle, give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they were in the middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them thinking they're getting shot at, and you'll have your movie. Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis. \nFOUR LEAF You must put them.under your thumb the way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR control. \nDAMIEN I see ...yes ...They would 'be under my total control... finally. I could shoot the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty. Away from their pampered pussy posses and helpers... \nFOUR LEAF Yes... yes... \nDAMIEN Put them in the real shit. Film them with real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR! \n.REAL EMOTION! YES! YES, FOUR LEAF, FUCK \nYES!! Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look. COOL MUSIC UP as WE PUSH IN and... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT \nA CHOPPER skimming the treetops, illuminated by a lonely moon... \nHIM TO BITS. The group stands absolutely stock still for several long beats until... \nSPEEDMAN Whoa. \nEXT. JUNGLE. -- A HALF MILE AWAY \nA group of about SIX ASIAN GUERILLA FIGHTERS, well armed and scary looking,,. notice the sound of the explosion. They begin talking very seriously in a foreign language. One of them grabs a radio: \nGUERILLAS \n(SUBTITLES) < We have heard an explosion, in the northern sector.> \nA UNKNOWN VOICE (crackling over walkie talkie), They lock and load, heading towards the actors... \nEXT. JUNGLE -- A.HILLTOP CLEARING \nFour Leaf scans the horizon while. Cody sets up high-tech equipment, including monitors and cameras and detonation devices. \nI Tropic Thunder 41. \nCODY So, I'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives us the go ahead, we'\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdust their cherry with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha till they come running right at, us, then a good of fashioned firefight, maintaining our distance. Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle, looking almost lost. \nCODY I been meaning to tell ya the whole shoot. I'm probably one-a your biggest fans. Your book was kinda my \"Catcher in the Rye\". It inspired me to become a gyro man. Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic stare. \nCODY I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I never was in the service, but for me blowing shit up in a war films is sort of my way of paying tribute to the real deal. And you sir, are the real deal. Nothing. \nCODY Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm you carry? Looks to me like a-- \nFOUR LEAF (very scary) I don't know what it's called. I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life. Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio. \nCODY Ok, we're ready to rock and roll. (to walkie-talkie) Damien, come in. Cameras are up, ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say so. \nTropic Thunder 42. \nEXT. JUNGLE - THE ACTORS \nWE are close on the seemingly broken.walkie talkie,.which has heard none of this. We PULL BACK to reveal the guys, staring at Damien's corpse in total shock. All except Speedman, who looks on with a smirk. \nPORTNOY I think he's like... dead. \nSPEEDMAN: (with a chuckle) Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice, wherever you're hiding! \nREDYKULOUS I don't think he's hiding.. I think he just died! Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse. pulls a wrist into frame. \nSANDUSKY He doesn't. have a pulse ...or a head. He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal. \nSANDUSKY Must've been one of those Claymore mines. This old Jungle must.be full of them., \nREDYKUZOUS You bet your ass it is. That's why a percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are helpin' solve the problem! Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle. Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him -- what the hell? Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent older brother. \nSPEEDMAN C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of the Nam! He's trying to get in our heads! \nTropic Thunder 43. \nGUERRILLAS P.O.V -- FROM THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE They are right behind the treeline, watching the guys from about thirty feet. \nSPEEDMAN That whole \"life and death\" speech in the chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do you think all that \"playing God\" was about? The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief -- except Lazarus. \nLAZARUS Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is dead!! Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides. \nSPEEDMAN Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor here, but, no offense, I've done a lot mote effects driven event films, and I think I can spot a prop body. \nBACK ON THE ACTORS Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now. \nSPEEDMAN Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped something. He mimes picking something , off, the ground. \nSPEEDMAN It's called your character. Don't worry, I won't tell the Academy! Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have seized the moment. The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and debris kicks up all around him. \nSPEEDMAN You happy now? We're out of position for the effect! Am I the only one who read .the script?! This is the ambush! A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks of wood and shrapnel everywhere. \nSANDUSKY I think they're really shooting at us! \nSPEEDMAN What are you guys worried about? These guys are pros. The unions would tear them a new ass-if any of us got hurt. The actors stay down, looking scared. \nSPEEDMAN Come on, you guys! Let's use this! \nTropic Thunder 47. No one follows Speedman's lead., Fine, he'll go it alone. Speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone, and doing a very good job of it, going through an assortment of absurd action style maneuvers throughout. Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and join him. Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what the heck -- and follow. They all fire at the unseen enemy, letting out very convincing WAR CRIES. \nON THE GUERRILLAS Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of the actors' automatic weapons, and the intensity of their screams, they drop back... \nGUERILLA LEADER \nThe guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up RPGs... \nEXT. JUNGLE - HILLTOP CLEARING \nFour Leaf looks out into the jungle below, he can hear the firefight, but, Cody can't. \nFOUR LEAF Hear that? Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives. \nCODY What? I still can't get Damien on the radio. I bet he forgot how to use the Walkie again. What do you say we get a little... pro-active? Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger. \nBACK ON THE ACTORS Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to blow them to kingdom come with RPGs. But before the guerillas have a chance-- \nI t' Tropic Thunder 48. \nON CODY He pushes down the plunger... \nON THE GUERILLAS \nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM!! Dirt flies, the guerillas don't know what the hell is going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the shit out of them. They beat a hasty retreat. \nEXT. JUNGLE HILLTOP CLEARING \nCody and Four Leaf watch Cody's handiwork with binoculars. A smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle. \nCODY Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!. Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine guns pointed straight at them. \nCODY Oh shit. \nFOUR LEAF Oh yeah. And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of consciousness... \nEXT. JUNGLE -- THE ACTORS \nSpeedman motions for everyone to \"cease fire\". \nSPEEDMAN \n(PUMPED) Aaaaand... CUT! Jesus!. Alright! That's the trailer 'right there! \nREDYKULOUS That was some sick shit! I wasn't even thinking bout the camera! The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the jungle, sensing that someone was out there. \nTropic Thunder 49. \nSANDUSKY You saying you don'tithink they're filming us? \nI \nLAZARUS Of course not! It's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin', at us. That muppet's going to get us all killed. I need to convince everyone.to turn around, but I .can't do it without the map. You're the only one who can read it. Can I count on you? \nSANDUSKY Well, yeah, I.guess. But \nLAZARUS Good man, Good man. Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing, shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group. Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to? Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see Speedman, right next to him. \nSPEEDMAN I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you. Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create a red pee.stream. \nSPEEDMAN Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and. he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all of us. The men respect you, because you went to boot camp and rehearsal. (patting his shoulder) And you're pretty handy with that map. I need you on my side, Kyle. \nSANDUSKY Kevin. \nTropic Thunder 53. \nSPEEDMAN- If you stick with the program, I'm gonna talk to some of the Dreamworks brass... there'll probably be a Teen Choice award in it for you. You have that potential. \nSANDUSKY Well, I -- \nSPEEDMAN Good man. Good man. Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look. \nEXT. JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - LATER \nThe guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown path. Speedman machetes through the overgrowth. \nSPEEDMAN If we stay on this trajectory we should be reaching the village any minute now. At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating from Portnoy. \nSPEEDMAN Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead of us... \nPORTNOY \n(SICK) No... its just that I don't feel so hot... I left my medication at the hotel. \nREDYKULOUS (to himself, snickering) Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those \"meds\" for my own self. Lazarus moves up to Speedman. \nLAZARUS Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a village don't you think we would have hit it by now? \nSPEEDMAN Quit your carping, we're right where we're supposed to be! \nTropic Thunder 54. WHUMP! All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of frame... We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a SLOW \nMOVING RIVER. \nLAZARUS .(laughing) Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that map? S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map. \nSPEEDMAN Yes! There is! Its just a little more' down to the... lefty-down part from the: village. (checking the scene list) Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat Raid at the end of the second act. \nLAZARUS I don't see a \"Sampan\" boat! \nSPEEDMAN Any second now one should come by. Alright men, into the water! Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water. They all hold their rifles above their heads. \nLAZARUS I - L-et-'-s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We need to quit faffin' about and turn. around NOW! And... Lazarus grabs Sandusky. \nLAZARUS Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you, Sandusky? Kevin is caught, not sure what to d \nSPEEDMAN Wait! First of all... Now Speedman grabs him. \nSPEEDMAN Kelvin believes in this movie. And, second, need I remind you,. I am your superior officer. \n(PAUSE) Ohhhhh-Maaaaaaannn...I'm cold. It's \nFREEEZING.. \nREDYKULOUS \nWOULD YOU PAH-LEEZE.SHUT THE FUCK UP!- \nPORTNOY (after a beat) Ohhh GOD! Is'anybody BOILING!? It's like a sweat lodge out here! \nLAZARUS Make a note gentlemen,. unwittingly, Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have suffered for art. (to Portnoy) A new frontier for you, Funny Man. When this is all over, you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience. Portnoy looks a little hurt. \nREDYKULOUS You know what? I think I actually liked you better when you were a nigga. \nLAZARUS You know, Redykulous', I respect what it is you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking -- invented by the Irish I might add. \n(MORE) \nTropic Thunder 59. LAZARUS (cont'd) Yet you ooze this hostility towards me. Why do you think that-is? \nREDYKULOUS \"Why\"?! I dunno...maybe because they had one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white guy. \nLAZARUS Oh...I see...Put another way -- you're mad because I can act \"black\" better than you can. \nSANDUSKY Take it easy guys... \nREDYKULOUS (to Sandusky) You better rein in 'black like me' over here, before I put a foot in his white ass... \nLAZARUS Niggaz always got to be niggaz. This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at Lazarus. They fight. Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw. Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart. \nSANDUSKY Okay! That's enough! Jesus Christ! It's not enough we have people shooting at us! Now we have to kill each other?! Let's pull it together! This place is full of land mines! Or doesn't anyone's sense memory recall our director being blown up by onel? That shut them up. \nLAZARUS Sandusky is right... we could all learn a little from his common sense approach. From now on we walk Indian style, footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you take first position. He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look. \nTropic Thunder 60. \nLAZARUS Your bravery shames us. Sandusky reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for land mines with the branch. The guys follow at a VERY safe distance. EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT AM l u I, I nhy CLOSE. ON Speedman's face. After a beat.a drop of water hits him in the.forehead. Then another. PULL BACK to reveal a pathetic shelter made. out of headphone. wire, and the In Style magazine.' The drip-is now becoming full on RAIN. He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick. Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule. He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and begins to stalk his prey. Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of. fur... Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness, and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is heard... \nQUICK SHOTS OF: FANGS, BLOOD, AN EYEBALL, A HUGE PAW... Speedman is slashed, SOMETHING has got him in a choke hold... He reels around screaming.and stabbing wildly, brutally pummeling his attacker. He is. covered in blood, but looks ecstatic. \nSPEEDMAN Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die! Speedman deals a death blow. And unleashes a primal VICTORY SCREAM. Spent, he finally gets a good look at his victim: A.small, cute, cuddly PANDA... Speedman looks horrified... \n,i ,Tropic Thunder 61. \nI\" 1 FLASH on a SERIES OF STILLS from SPEEDMAN'S PANDA PHOTO \nSHOOT... He stumbles back against a tree. Suddenly we hear an odd VIBRATING SOUND. He jumps, and - frantically jams his hands in his pants it is the forgotten satellite phone he hid there way back when. \nCLOSE ON PHONE -- CALLER ID SAYS \"RICK PECK\" Speedman answers... \nINT. AGENCY OFFICE -- L.A. --DAY \nRick is on a Pilates machine in is office with a HOT PILATES INSTRUCTOR working him out. \nRICK I got the personal attache of Bien Den Phu's ambassador to the United Nations of America delivering a TiVo directly to your bedroom. But the bad news is you gotta sit down and have monkey brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper. \nWE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM \nSPEEDMAN \n(FREAKED) I killed one rick. The thing I love more than anything in the world... \n(\"ACTING\") Corporal Four Leaf Tayback...Serial number 694529987. \n'Tropic Thunder 64. \nBYONG \n(CALMLY) Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing. a little easier? \nSPEEDMAN You bastard. \nBYONG What? just thought you might like. some... \nSPEEDMAN Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh. yeah. . .THIS is from my uncle... SAM! He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into the back wall. Beat. \nSPEEDMAN (under his breath) You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BAMBOO CAGE --.DAY \nA pissed off Byong and a couple of guards throw Speedman into a small cage that is suspended by rope over the edge of-a marsh. He looks around, impressed with the production design. He looks up,.sees another security camera observing him. He turns it on. \nSPEEDMAN May God protect you from the mighty arm of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My men will seek you out and mete. out a cruel justice!- Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RICE PADDY -- DAY \nLooking up we see a circle of faces. Our guys, looking down on something awful.. . .that thing is: \nTropic Thunder 65. PORTNOY, delirious and groaningt \nSANDUSKY I think he's dead. A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy. \nREDYKULOUS No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled \n44M like that all night. \nLAZARUS What's wrong with him? \nPORTNOY \n(LYING) Nothing! Probably just the beginning stages of some ... . kinda...jungle fever. More bad noises. \nPORTNOY If we can work out some rig to carry m\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd? I think it might subside in a little bit... No one touches him. \nLAZARUS Alright. Sandusky? Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious? \nSANDUSKY What? \nLAZARUS You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry Portnoy. God help you. He marches off. \nSANDUSKY God help me? \nREDYKULOUS God help him that bitch ever find his blackface minstrel show ass alone with me in the real world. Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up Portnoy on a make shift stretcher. \nTropic Thunder 66. \nEXT. HILLTOP \nOur guys are humping, with Fats in the makeshift stretcher. They look exhausted. As they crest. the ridge, Redykulous spots something. ''I , I n n4\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdN11 \nREDYKULOUS \nAWW JEEESUS MAN! \nSANDUSKY How did it get infected so fast? More ad libs of disgust... \nTropic Thunder 69. \nSANDUSKY' Okay Jeff...This is gonna hurt like hell, but I have to take my finger and see how deep the slug is, and if I can dig it out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his hand... Beat... Sandusky puts his hand off camera. \nI \nPORTNOY Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it out! That's not the bullet hole. The bullet hole is over here! It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at the bullet hole. Ad-libs of even MORE disgust. \nSANDUSKY OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're gonna be fine. \nEXT. BAMBOO CAGE -- DAY \nSpeedman is exhausted, slumped in his cage. He is covered in a few leeches. Byong appears with his usual cadre of guards. He nods, and they grab Speedman, and drag him out of the cage. \nEXT. FLAMING DRAGON HQ - COURTYARD \nByong leads Speedman to the center of the courtyard. A HUSH falls over the soldiers. They begin to part, as someone very important is arriving. Finally, the unseen leader emerges. He is a LITTLE BOY, no older than 12 years old, but has the eyes of a killer. He smokes a cigar. This is TRAN. He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down. Then, in a show of alpha male dominance, he tears his shirt off, revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos -- a flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a rat. He holds a stick. \nSPEEDMAN \n(WARILY) Uhhh..I don't think I got the new pages... \nTropic Thunder 70. \nTRAN \nYOU ARE A TRESPASSER IN MY POPPY FIELDS! \nYOU ARE D.E.A. SCUM! WE HAVE SHOT DOWN \nYOUR HELICOPTER, AND SOON WE WILL KILL \nYOUR COMPATRIOTS!. Tran points across the courtyard where... A\"4 Iv I. InM y CODY AND FOUR LEAF ARE MARCHED OUT. Cody looks scared out. of his mind. Speedman takes this in. Traci nods, and TWO GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out of Cody and Four Leaf. Then Tran gets out his own stick and starts to BEAT SPEEDMAN... \nTRAN \nDO YOU WANT THEM TO DIE? DO YOU WANT THEM \nTO DIE!! \nSPEEDMAN No! Puh-Puh-pulease don't h-h-h-hurt them... I Tran cocks his head curiously. He stops beating him..He signals.for the guards to stop beating the others. A long beat. \nTRAN Say that. again., \nSPEEDMAN Please don't hurt them?I \nTRAN No...like you did before! Silence. \nTRAN \nSAY IT! He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils. \nSPEEDMAN Puh-puh-puhlease don't h-h-hurt them? A hush falls over the crowd. Tran'seyes widen. \nTRAN \nTRAN Do the movie. \nSPEEDMAN The whole movie? \nTRAN Yes. Begin. \nSPEEDMAN Hey, I know you're big fans and that's \nGREAT-- Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt. Speedman crumples to the ground. The crowd cheers. \nSPEEDMAN \nOW!! Tran stands over him, screaming into his face: \nTRAN \nYOU WILL PERFORM, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?? \nYOU WILL PERFORM OR DIE11! MONKEY- \nSWINE!1 Speedman gets up, begins a scared, unenthusiastic \nPERFORMANCE: \nSPEEDMAN Aww, puh-puh-Pa!

HOLE -- DUSK \nThe actors look miserable. Portnoy-looks.like his face is going to fall off \nSANDUSKY It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I say we stay in here till it's dark. \nREDYKULOUS I can't believe this is how it ends for Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum recording artist., Shit. \nPORTNOY (shivering and wheezing) I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not gonna make.it... \nSANDUSKY Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're out'here. They'll be looking for us. Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And no one else knows but us. \nLAZARUS That's right. So here's the plan. Everyone leans forward expectantly. \nLAZARUS We sneak out of here, make our way back to the hotel and once we're safe, we alert the government of Speedman's situation. \nREDYKULOUS Sounds good. \nSANDUSKY Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just gonna leave him here? \nTropic Thunder 75. \nPORTNOY (O.S.) .I can't feel my legs!... \n'tropic Thunder 83. \nI\" 1 \nREDYKULOUS I'm just thinking about Lill Kantankerous Bitch. \nSANDUSKY Who? \nPORTNOY (O.S.) \n(DRY HEAVES) \nREDYKULOUS She's a rapper I'm producing, a twelve year old girl. Her first single drops tomorrow and I'm not even gonna be there to see it. \nPORTNOY (O.S.) Ohhhhh GOD! THERE'S BARBED WIRE IN MY \nURINE! \nREDYKULOUS I pulled her off the streets six months ago. \nSANDUSKY You did that? \nREDYKULOUS Well, not literally, she was trapped in a dead end record deal with Rick Rubin. Didn't even have a lawyer. Huh. And here I am on the other side of the world. About to die for a guy I barely even know. Makes Redykulous wonder what's it all about. \nSANDUSKY Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to think about. \nPORTNOY (O.S.) \n(TTTTTHHHHWWAAAAAPPP... GURGLE) \nREDYKULOUS You single? \nSANDUSKY Yeah,... .I guess. I dunno. I got a girl. But it's not too serious. \nPORTNOY (O.S.) \n(FFFAAAARRRRTTT... .

Ohh... . thank God...its Over ...it's finally over... \nSANDUSKY: It'.s kind of depressing. That feeling of not having anyone who really loves you.. Redykuloils. puts his arm around Sandusky to comfort him.. \nREDYKULOUS Hey, it's cool.. I think you're extremely lovable. Weird silence. \nSANDUSKY What? \nREDYKULOUS (removing his arm) I mean like ...like,. I know what you mean. I have love problems myself! \nPORTNOY.(O.S.) \nEXT.

Tropic Thunder on three, two, one... \nGUYS \nTROPIC THUNDER! They make their way down the hill. \nEXT. FENCE LINE -- PRE-DAWN \nThey reach the fence. The coast looks clear and they each scamper over... Finally, it's PORTNOY'S turn. He's clearly too heavy. The fence groans under'his weight. He launches himself -- and... THWANG!!! Slams painfully into the razor wire of the fence. GUARDS hear the noise. They raise their weapons and listen.. They see nothing in the pre-dawn darkness... The actors run to the wall and clumsily pull PORTNOY down, just in time. Everyone's inside the perimeter... they quickly make their way along the fence line to the entrance of the main building, ducking away to avoid a LONE GUARD. \nTropic Thunder 92. \nINT. MAIN BUILDING \nSandusky makes a series of hand gestures, indicating for them to'split up and search for Speedman. A beat. The guys all shrug, not understanding. Sandusky repeats the hand gestures. Finally he has to speak. i 1, 11 11^\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd% \nSANDUSKY I 4I4 (in a loud whisper, also signalling what.he's saying) FAN OUT! 'GO ROOM BY ROOM !

He peaks around a half opened door... \nA DARKENED ROOM .PORTNOY turns on his flashlight to reveal he is in fact in... HEROIN HEAVEN! Wall to wall packets, ready,for shipment.. PORTNOY is paralyzed. He spots a box with the words \"For U.S.A., 100% pure, dilute before ingesting\". His mouth LITERALLY waters, and'a drop. of .spittle oozes from his bottom lip. He doesn't know what to do. He gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box. marked \"pure\". It's like holding two grenades... \nHALLWAY Sandusky moves silently toward a door. He kicks it'open to reveal... \nSPEEDMAN Shackled to the floor. Delirious, he sits bolt upright. \nSPEEDMAN You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy. \nSANDUSKY Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I'll be right back! Sandusky runs off to get the guys. \nTropic Thunder 93. \nI\" 1 \nHALLWAY Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus, points to both of his eyes, signalling that he's got \"eyes\",on Speedman. They take a step in that direction. Redykulous stops them, and makes a made up, absurd signal for \"Where is Portnoy?\", somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy. No one knbws what he is doing. \nREDYKULOUS \n(FRUSTRATED) Where is Portnoy?! \nSANDUSKY Shhh! A muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards it. Redykulous kicks it in. \nHEROIN HEAVEN The 'gang flies in, to discover Portnoy holding the bags, crying. \nREDYKULOUS What are you doing, man! \nSANDUSKY Come on, let's go! We found Speedmani \nPORTNOY I don't care! It doesn't matter what I do! I'll always be a screw-up! No one will ever respect me... \nREDYKULOUS That's not true! Listen, back in the day, I used to think I couldn't produce a record simply because... \nSANDUSKY .he's gay. Uh-oh. That's not what Redykulous was about to say.

He tosses the guard's pistol to Four Leaf. \nCODY By the way, what's your name anyway? \nFOUR LEAF Marvin Kaminsky. \nCODY you ever been in this jungle? \nFOUR LEAF Nope.

How can I convince a man he is who we know he is, when I can't even convince myself of the same thing. He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down. \nTropic Thunder 98. \nREDYKULOUS Yo, c'mon, man! Why is everybody gettin'. so insecure alla a sudden?! You're Kirk Lazarus!

PORTNOY, not looking very sober, jumps up on the stage with the dancers and starts doing a striptease. \nENTRANCE TO THE DECK Damien walks in, watching this scene from Caligula going down. He looks in a deep funk. Portnoy STAGE DIVES straight onto the lawn, landing with a thud in front of Damien. \nDAMIEN, Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to talk -- as.a cast, as a platoon, right now. \nPORTNOY (sick and drunk) Dorfie-- did you happenito see that grip withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was supposed to meet him here. He has a- package of mine. Kevin Sandusky (\"Brooklyn\" from the movie) comes up to them, looking fresh faced and eager. \nSANDUSKY. Hey Mr. Dorfman. Jeff. You O.K? That was some hit you took today. \nPORTNOY \n(BEAT) Who are you? \nSANDUSKY I'm Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin Sandusky? I'm playing Brooklyn? \nTropic Thunder 29. \nPORTNOY Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that grip with the bandana? \nSANDUSKY Uh, no. I think-- But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug connection. They both watch him go. \nSANDUSKY Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find you. I know this is a party, but this afternoon after work I was breaking down my M-16, and I have to say, in the night watch scene, a minute and a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble it. \nDAMIEN \n(TOUCHED) You actually care, don't you? \nSANDUSKY Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge opportunity. To be working with all these great actors, and you. \nDAMIEN You're the only one who auditioned. You're the only one who did the two week boot camp, Sandusky. \nSANDUSKY Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird. Wasn't the point that we were all supposed to bond? \nDAMIEN \n(BITTERLY) Yes, that was the point. Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it. We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of food. Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS who is deeply uninterested. \nI \nI r Tropic Thunder 30. \nSPEEDMAN I guess I just watched some retarded people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time. with them... watching them.. Watching all the retarded stuff they did. \nLAZARUS Huh, I always found mere observation a little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram the source of the pain. Then live it. \nSPEEDMAN (trying. to keep up) Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the first time in-my life.. (searches for the word) Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer, retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth retarded. In a `weird way I had to unlearn what it was to be... .NOT retarded. \nLAZARUS Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded. So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman is lost: \nSPEEDMAN About what? \nLAZARUS (with 'a chuckle) Are you serious? Everyone knows you don't ever go fully retarded! \nSPEEDMAN How do you mean? Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session. \n", "test1_true": "(MORE) \nTropic Thunder 31. LAZARUS (cont'd) Retarded? Maybe. Had braces on his legs, he charmed the pants bff Nixon, and won a ping-pong competition. Peter Sellers, \"Being There\", infantile? Yes. Retarded? No. He claps a hand on Speedman's shoulder. \nLAZARUS You went full retard, man. You never go 14 full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard. Went home empty handed. Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be so stupid? \nLAZARUS (cruelly, driving it home) But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose the hook hands though... cripples don't give the Academy wood either. \nSPEEDMAN \n(DAZED) Oh. Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass and heading for the bar. Speedman stands hurt, delicately holding the spring,roll in his hook. \nON THE OTHER SIDE,OF THE ROOM Damien paces the party. He looks more miserable and high strung than ever. He discovers Redykulous, surrounded by his posse and a CAMERA CREW. \nDAMIEN Redykulous... I need to talk to you. \nREDYKULOUS What up, money. \nDAMIEN (in a hushed tone, aware of the cameras) We're having a cast meeting, right now We need to come together as a unit -- The camera crew moves in for the close-up. . .making Damien uncomfortable ... Redykulous takes it in stride. Throughout the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone. \nTropic Thunder 32. \nREDYKULOUS Uh-huh... Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch style camera move... DAMIEN i Do you mind if we step away for a moment? \nREDYKULOUS From what? Damien tries to indicate the crew. \nDAMIEN (whispering even lower now) From the...uh...you know... .this area.. \nREDYKUL:OUS Oh, I see...sure They take a few steps away from the bar... The entire camera crew follows. \nDAMIEN Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the cameras. you understand?. Away from (indicating the crew) them... \nREDYKULOUS No. \nDAMIEN What? \nREDYKULOUS No. I can't do that. If Redykulous steps away from the cameras then my .people don't get to see the real Redykulous. The show is called \"Utterly Redykulous\". \nDAMIEN Well this is about work ...my show so to. .speak. Do you understand? \nREDYKULOUS I guess. But not really. Your show and my show are the same thing. This is gonna help your show, trust me. \n(MORE) \nTropic Thunder 33.

He then notices the chmera crew pushing in k I , 1 '144% for a close up He awkwardly tries to get away from them... \nDAMIEN Excuse me, everyone! If I could have your attention! Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together. \nDAMIEN Sorry to break up the party, but I just wanted to call your attention to a cast meeting tonight! Big meeting! Future of the film depends on it! \n(UNRAVELING) Not to mention my entire bloody life! Damien in a final cry of frustration, SMASHES a bottle on the bar. He succeeds only in cutting his hand. \nDAMIEN \nGODFUCKITI SHIT! Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's shoulder. He steps to the fore. \nSPEEDMAN (slowly, deliberately) \"When... we.'.. put... aside... our... differences... we see we're kind of the same.\" Within moments, the place settles completely. \nSPEEDMAN (Long beat...-then almost quietly.) \"When we put aside our differences, we see we're kind of the same.

Anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girls' camp. So we did it by building a catapult. They shot us over the wall and we parachuted down. The guys all look at each other... then finally: \nLAZARUS That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. \nSANDUSKY Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence. Take our chances. You guys ok with that? The group nods in approval. \nSANDUSKY Good. Then let's get some rest.

Seriously, I think we should cut. I mean, Should Osiris be crying too? Maybe he shouldn't cry if I'm crying... Lazarus abruptly drops Speedman from his arms and gets up, shaking his head. \nLAZARUS I'm sorry, so, just keep crying or are'we cutting?? \nDAMIEN No, no, it's good. Portnoy is walking around massaging his butt. \nPORTNOY Damien, I think I broke my ass. Is it possible to break your ass? \nDAMIEN Get back in character Portnoy! Still rolling everyone!

Four Leaf wouldn't say that. \nDAMIEN Yes, well-you see, Four Leaf was there and he did say that. So... Right. So let's just go... \nSPEEDMAN Is he here, or is he-'at the.hotel?

BANK - SCENE FROM \"CHITLIN AND THE DUDE\" \nSpeedman'and Martin Lawrence, both with guns, are holding up a bank -- Speedman in drag. They yell at each other in that uptight-white-guy/loose-cannon-black-guy action comedy style. \nJULIE (V:O.) The disappointing \"CHITLIN AND THE DUDE\", was followed.with last year's failed venture into serious dramatic territory... \nEXT. PONY FARM - SCENE FROM \"SIMPLE JACK\" - DAY \n:Speedman,..innoveralls and with a bad haircut, dressed as a farm hand. He holds a pony_by the reins as he \"talks\" to it by rubbing his nose on the pony's neck. \nJULIE (V.0.) .\"Simple Jack\", the story-of a mentally impaired farm hand who can \"talk\" to animals was a box office disaster that many critics called one of the worst movies of all time. \nSPEEDMAN (as Simple Jack) You mu-mu-muhhh make me'ha-aaaapy. \nTropic Thunder 17. \nEXT. TROPIC THUNDER SET -- DAY \nJULIE (to camera) But now, the question is can Speedman \"mu- mu-make\" audiences happy in the true life story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in \"Tropic Thunder\". And,' possibly a shot \u00e2\u0080\u009e 1. -4416 at that elusive gold statuette? \nEXT. TROPIC THUNDER SET -- DAY \nJulie sits with Speedman. With them is the real FOUR LEAF, a stoic, grizzled man of few words. \nSPEEDMAN (very serious) All I want is to make the real Four Leaf here proud. It's his story, he lived it and wrote it in his book. That's why we're here. But really, I mean, how cah we begin to understand what he-- what you --went through? Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only two HOOKS. Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying to \"get inside\" him as much as possible. \nFOUR LEAF \n(MYSTICAL) When I lost these... (holds his hooks up) It was as if I saw through these for the first time..'. (indicates his eyes) And it was only then that I really began to use these... (indicates his ears) \nSPEEDMAN That's great. He's like a... Buddha or something. Maybe I should rub his belly for luck! He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it funny. \n,Tropic Thunder 18. \nJULIE (to Speedman) Like for a lucky Oscar nod this time? Maybe you should rub Kirk Lazarus's belly! He already has three! Speedman laughs uncomfortably, trying to seem unperturbed. i \"I' 0, nM y \nL \nCUT TO: \nA SERIES OF SHOTS OF KIRK LAZARUS In his normal.look, CAUCASIAN and IRISH, much like he was in the \"Satan's Alley\" trailer... \n- JULIE (V.0.)

HOSPITAL ROOM - A FEW WEEKS LATER \nLazarus lies in a hospital bed,, covered in bandages. \nJULIE After undergoing experimental pigmentation alteration procedures in a Singapore clinic, this was the startling result. \nTropic Thunder 19. A doctor dversees as nurses carefully peel the bandages off Lazarus's head. Lazarus is now Black. \nINT.''TROPIC THUNDER PRE-SHOOT PRESS CONFERENCE \nVOICE OF TODD We're shutting you down, Dorf. \nINT. PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY \nDamien sits behind his desk, looking scared. Vietnam photos, maps, and sketches cover the walls. Standing in the office are ASSORTED CREW, including Cody and Four Leaf, who whittles a stick with his hooks, never looking up. \nTropic Thunder 22. They are all staring at a speaker phone. \nDAMIEN You can't do that Todd. \nVOICE OF TODD I Yes we can.. The dailies are not good. \nDAMIEN Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good movie! Isn't that what they say? \nVOICE OF TODD I never heard that saying. Look, Damien. Fact: You're. three weeks behind and you've been shooting for five days. Fact: we greenlit this project at a very specific number, a number Walter and I could get in bed. with, and fact--. \nDAMIEN ,. _. (starting to lose it) Todd, it really isn't necessary for you to,keep saying \"fact\" before everything. It's kind of implied, that if you are saying.it-- \nVOICE OF TODD Alright.. I'm just.trying to keep the emotion out of it, so I thought I would say.\"fact\" before each fact, so it would be less-upsetting -- I \nVOICE OF WALTER Ok, Damien, this is Walter, I'm just gonna jump in.and bad-cop.it here for a second. Dude, I mean, 46,000 dollars for Chris Michael Speedman's masseuse's miscellaneous living expenses? It sounds like the inmates are running the asylum. \nDAMIEN Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if- you actually came out here you would see that .these actors are-- \nVOICE OF TODD (loud out of'nowhere) The actors didn't blow up the rainforest and forget to turn on the camera Damien! I have a lot of tolerance, but when. Lt comes to nature I lose it! \n(MORE) \nTropic Thunder 23. \nR \nIN \u00e2\u0096\u00ba VOICE OF TODD (cont'd) I will not be called an eco-terrorist, do you understand that? Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young assistant comes in with a cell phone. \nHOT YOUNG ASSISTANT Sorry. (whispering to Damien) It's Chris Michael, he says it's important. Damien, shaking now, steps out on to the balcony and slides the glass door shut. \nEXT. RUNDOWN BALCONY -- DAY \nThough the hotel is a shambles, the view out on to the bay is spectacular. \nDAMIEN (trying to seem calm) Yes, Chris!? \nEXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE \nIn stark contrast to the hotel where everyone else is living, Speedman is in what looks like an Asian presidential palace overlooking the ocean. SPEEDMAN is standing on the deck, trying hard to hold the, phone with his hook hands. \"Simple Jack\" plays on a flat screen inside. \nSPEEDMAN Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way. I know today was rough, and you're probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots, but that's the way these movies go. We all boot it from time to time, and today was just one of those days. Happens. \nDAMIEN (sickly sweet) Yes it does. It does. Though I do think you have to realize Chris, that you are somewhat responsi-- \nTropic Thunder 24. \nSPEEDMAN Oh, also needed to let you know, and I. .know you're like wrapped up with the movie, but I really need that new chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening. This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I \nDAMIEN' Right. well those things... those. 4, \nthings ...I'm dealing with bigger issues right now Chris -- \nSPEEDMAN Yeah, of course, I just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D. \nSPEEDMAN Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec, D? He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the hooks. \nCUT TO: \nTropic Thunder 28. \nEXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE -- NIGHT \nIt is an APOCALYPSE NOW theme party. Vegas style. Tiki torches,, buffets. PLAYBOY PLAYMATE DANCERS circa 1967 are dancing on a deck in front of a banner that reads \"ONE WEEK DOWN!\". The crew and cast are partying their asses off. i n \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd i nM\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd'al WAITERS, dressed like bald Marlon Brandos in full face camo, serve hors d'oeuvres. PORTNOY, not looking very sober, jumps up on the stage with the dancers and starts doing a striptease. \nENTRANCE TO THE DECK Damien walks in, watching this scene from Caligula going down. He looks in a deep funk. Portnoy STAGE DIVES straight onto the lawn, landing with a thud in front of Damien. \nDAMIEN, Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to talk -- as.a cast, as a platoon, right now. \nPORTNOY (sick and drunk) Dorfie-- did you happenito see that grip withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was supposed to meet him here. He has a- package of mine. Kevin Sandusky (\"Brooklyn\" from the movie) comes up to them, looking fresh faced and eager. \nSANDUSKY. Hey Mr. Dorfman. Jeff. You O.K? That was some hit you took today. \nPORTNOY \n(BEAT) Who are you? \nSANDUSKY I'm Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin Sandusky? I'm playing Brooklyn? \nTropic Thunder 29. \nPORTNOY Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that grip with the bandana? \nSANDUSKY Uh, no. I think-- But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug connection. They both watch him go. \nSANDUSKY Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find you. I know this is a party, but this afternoon after work I was breaking down my M-16, and I have to say, in the night watch scene, a minute and a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble it. \nDAMIEN \n(TOUCHED) You actually care, don't you? \nSANDUSKY Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge opportunity. To be working with all these great actors, and you. \nDAMIEN You're the only one who auditioned. You're the only one who did the two week boot camp, Sandusky. \nSANDUSKY Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird. Wasn't the point that we were all supposed to bond? \nDAMIEN \n(BITTERLY) Yes, that was the point. Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it. We follow A WAITER as he passes Speedman with a tray of food. Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a spring roll off the tray. He resumes talking to LAZARUS who is deeply uninterested. \nI \nI r Tropic Thunder 30. \nSPEEDMAN I guess I just watched some retarded people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time. with them... watching them.. Watching all the retarded stuff they did. \nLAZARUS Huh, I always found mere observation a little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram the source of the pain. Then live it. \nSPEEDMAN (trying. to keep up) Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the first time in-my life.. (searches for the word) Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer, retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth retarded. In a `weird way I had to unlearn what it was to be... .NOT retarded. \nLAZARUS Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded. So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman is lost: \nSPEEDMAN About what? \nLAZARUS (with 'a chuckle) Are you serious? Everyone knows you don't ever go fully retarded! \nSPEEDMAN How do you mean? Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session. \nTropic Thunder 34. SPEEDMAN (,cont'd) That's a quote from my children's book, \"The Boy Everybody-Was Jealous Of.\" I know it's just a book for. kids, but I think it applies to.making a movie as well. 'Course... I know a lot of the reason things are maybe messed up is ME. The guys look at each other -- maybe he's not so bad. \nSPEEDMAN I was looking-at it all backwards. You guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you, to help you gel, and straighten.up -- like a PLATOON! A long beat. \nPORTNOY (drunk out of his mind) Hey,. Speedman! That bullshit pep'talk made me.H-h-h-h-h-happy! The entire party cuts.up.in loud hysterics. Speedman looks hurt. The DJ puts on-a Redykulous track really loud, and the, place gets even crazier. \nEXT. BEACH - LATER \nDamien, drunk, walks along, illuminated by the light of the moon. He holds' a bottle of wine, which.he chugs..In the distance, the party rages. \nFOUR LEAF-CO .. S . ) When a herd loses its way, the shepherd must kill the bull that leads them astray.. Damien turns around., startled. FOUR LEAF is standing eerily in the bushes by the sand. \nFOUR LEAF You don't know which way is up, do you private`? You couldn't find a dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick. and showin' you the way... Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant. Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes. Damien's eyes widen in fear. \n,I \nI \u00e2\u0080\u009eTropic Thunder 35. \nFOUR LEAF A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest can cleave that mountain to make the valley, and an army of ants can fell the mighty buffalo. \nDAMIEN (seeing the wisdom of this) Yes... \nFOUR LEAF If the lion, although king of the jungle, is thrown into the sea, he will drown... but...if... \n(PAUSE) He...lives in the...water, for many years, he will.. .grow gills ... . do you understand? (long pause) \nDO YOU!? He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the collar with both hooks. ' \nDAMIEN (near tears now) I want to!!! But not really!! \n(BEAT) Someone's an ANT? Or something??? \nFOUR LEAF I put my story in your limp Brit hands and you will not fail me!! (long pause) My boys were worse pussies than these guys. But the shit is what made us a unit. A whole. You must put them in the \nSHIT. He releases Damien and takes a large draw on his cigarette... \nFOUR LEAF There's a place. About a hundred clicks from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties. Nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the size of melons. Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his weirdness. \nTropic Thunder 36. \nDAMIEN And...? \nFOUR LEAF Rig up your documentary cameras'in that jungle, give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they were in the middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them thinking they're getting shot at, and you'll have your movie. Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis. \nFOUR LEAF You must put them.under your thumb the way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR control. \nDAMIEN I see ...yes ...They would 'be under my total control... finally. I could shoot the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty. Away from their pampered pussy posses and helpers... \nFOUR LEAF Yes... yes... \nDAMIEN Put them in the real shit. Film them with real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR! \n.REAL EMOTION! YES! YES, FOUR LEAF, FUCK \nYES!! Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look. COOL MUSIC UP as WE PUSH IN and... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT \nA CHOPPER skimming the treetops, illuminated by a lonely moon... \nBACK ON THE ACTORS Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now. \nSPEEDMAN Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped something. He mimes picking something , off, the ground. \nSPEEDMAN It's called your character. Don't worry, I won't tell the Academy! Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have seized the moment. The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and debris kicks up all around him. \nSPEEDMAN You happy now? We're out of position for the effect! Am I the only one who read .the script?! This is the ambush! A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks of wood and shrapnel everywhere. \nSANDUSKY I think they're really shooting at us! \nSPEEDMAN What are you guys worried about? These guys are pros. The unions would tear them a new ass-if any of us got hurt. The actors stay down, looking scared. \nSPEEDMAN Come on, you guys! Let's use this! \nTropic Thunder 47. No one follows Speedman's lead., Fine, he'll go it alone. Speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone, and doing a very good job of it, going through an assortment of absurd action style maneuvers throughout. Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and join him. Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what the heck -- and follow. They all fire at the unseen enemy, letting out very convincing WAR CRIES. \nON THE GUERRILLAS Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of the actors' automatic weapons, and the intensity of their screams, they drop back... \nGUERILLA LEADER \nThe guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up RPGs... \nEXT. JUNGLE - HILLTOP CLEARING \nFour Leaf looks out into the jungle below, he can hear the firefight, but, Cody can't. \nFOUR LEAF Hear that? Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives. \nCODY What? I still can't get Damien on the radio. I bet he forgot how to use the Walkie again. What do you say we get a little... pro-active? Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger. \nBACK ON THE ACTORS Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to blow them to kingdom come with RPGs. But before the guerillas have a chance-- \nI t' Tropic Thunder 48. \nON CODY He pushes down the plunger... \nON THE GUERILLAS \nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM!! Dirt flies, the guerillas don't know what the hell is going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the shit out of them. They beat a hasty retreat. \nEXT. JUNGLE HILLTOP CLEARING \nCody and Four Leaf watch Cody's handiwork with binoculars. A smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle. \nCODY Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!. Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine guns pointed straight at them. \nCODY Oh shit. \nFOUR LEAF Oh yeah. And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of consciousness... \nEXT. JUNGLE -- THE ACTORS \nSpeedman motions for everyone to \"cease fire\". \nSPEEDMAN \n(PUMPED) Aaaaand... CUT! Jesus!. Alright! That's the trailer 'right there! \nREDYKULOUS That was some sick shit! I wasn't even thinking bout the camera! The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the jungle, sensing that someone was out there. \nTropic Thunder 49. \nSANDUSKY You saying you don'tithink they're filming us? \nI \nLAZARUS Of course not! It's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin', at us. That muppet's going to get us all killed. I need to convince everyone.to turn around, but I .can't do it without the map. You're the only one who can read it. Can I count on you? \nSANDUSKY Well, yeah, I.guess. But \nLAZARUS Good man, Good man. Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing, shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group. Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to? Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see Speedman, right next to him. \nSPEEDMAN I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you. Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create a red pee.stream. \nSPEEDMAN Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and. he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all of us. The men respect you, because you went to boot camp and rehearsal. (patting his shoulder) And you're pretty handy with that map. I need you on my side, Kyle. \nSANDUSKY Kevin. \nTropic Thunder 53. \nSPEEDMAN- If you stick with the program, I'm gonna talk to some of the Dreamworks brass... there'll probably be a Teen Choice award in it for you. You have that potential. \nSANDUSKY Well, I -- \nSPEEDMAN Good man. Good man. Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look. \nEXT. JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - LATER \nThe guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown path. Speedman machetes through the overgrowth. \nSPEEDMAN If we stay on this trajectory we should be reaching the village any minute now. At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating from Portnoy. \nSPEEDMAN Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead of us... \nPORTNOY \n(SICK) No... its just that I don't feel so hot... I left my medication at the hotel. \nREDYKULOUS (to himself, snickering) Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those \"meds\" for my own self. Lazarus moves up to Speedman. \nLAZARUS Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a village don't you think we would have hit it by now? \nSPEEDMAN Quit your carping, we're right where we're supposed to be! \nTropic Thunder 54. WHUMP! All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of frame... We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a SLOW \nMOVING RIVER. \nLAZARUS .(laughing) Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that map? S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map. \nSPEEDMAN Yes! There is! Its just a little more' down to the... lefty-down part from the: village. (checking the scene list) Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat Raid at the end of the second act. \nLAZARUS I don't see a \"Sampan\" boat! \nSPEEDMAN Any second now one should come by. Alright men, into the water! Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water. They all hold their rifles above their heads. \nLAZARUS I - L-et-'-s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We need to quit faffin' about and turn. around NOW! And... Lazarus grabs Sandusky. \nLAZARUS Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you, Sandusky? Kevin is caught, not sure what to d \nSPEEDMAN Wait! First of all... Now Speedman grabs him. \nSPEEDMAN Kelvin believes in this movie. And, second, need I remind you,. I am your superior officer. \n(\"ACTING\") Corporal Four Leaf Tayback...Serial number 694529987. \n'Tropic Thunder 64. \nBYONG \n(CALMLY) Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing. a little easier? \nSPEEDMAN You bastard. \nBYONG What? just thought you might like. some... \nSPEEDMAN Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh. yeah. . .THIS is from my uncle... SAM! He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into the back wall. Beat. \nSPEEDMAN (under his breath) You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BAMBOO CAGE --.DAY \nA pissed off Byong and a couple of guards throw Speedman into a small cage that is suspended by rope over the edge of-a marsh. He looks around, impressed with the production design. He looks up,.sees another security camera observing him. He turns it on. \nSPEEDMAN May God protect you from the mighty arm of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My men will seek you out and mete. out a cruel justice!- Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RICE PADDY -- DAY \nLooking up we see a circle of faces. Our guys, looking down on something awful.. . .that thing is: \nTropic Thunder 65. PORTNOY, delirious and groaningt \nSANDUSKY I think he's dead. A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy. \nREDYKULOUS No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled \n44M like that all night. \nLAZARUS What's wrong with him? \nPORTNOY \n(LYING) Nothing! Probably just the beginning stages of some ... . kinda...jungle fever. More bad noises. \nPORTNOY If we can work out some rig to carry m\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd? I think it might subside in a little bit... No one touches him. \nLAZARUS Alright. Sandusky? Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious? \nSANDUSKY What? \nLAZARUS You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry Portnoy. God help you. He marches off. \nSANDUSKY God help me? \nREDYKULOUS God help him that bitch ever find his blackface minstrel show ass alone with me in the real world. Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up Portnoy on a make shift stretcher. \nTropic Thunder 66. \nEXT. HILLTOP \nOur guys are humping, with Fats in the makeshift stretcher. They look exhausted. As they crest. the ridge, Redykulous spots something. ''I , I n n4\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdN11 \nREDYKULOUS \nAWW JEEESUS MAN! \nSANDUSKY How did it get infected so fast? More ad libs of disgust... \nTropic Thunder 69. \nSANDUSKY' Okay Jeff...This is gonna hurt like hell, but I have to take my finger and see how deep the slug is, and if I can dig it out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his hand... Beat... Sandusky puts his hand off camera. \nI \nPORTNOY Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it out! That's not the bullet hole. The bullet hole is over here! It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at the bullet hole. Ad-libs of even MORE disgust. \nSANDUSKY OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're gonna be fine. \nEXT. BAMBOO CAGE -- DAY \nSpeedman is exhausted, slumped in his cage. He is covered in a few leeches. Byong appears with his usual cadre of guards. He nods, and they grab Speedman, and drag him out of the cage. \nEXT. FLAMING DRAGON HQ - COURTYARD \nByong leads Speedman to the center of the courtyard. A HUSH falls over the soldiers. They begin to part, as someone very important is arriving. Finally, the unseen leader emerges. He is a LITTLE BOY, no older than 12 years old, but has the eyes of a killer. He smokes a cigar. This is TRAN. He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down. Then, in a show of alpha male dominance, he tears his shirt off, revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos -- a flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a rat. He holds a stick. \nSPEEDMAN \n(WARILY) Uhhh..I don't think I got the new pages... \nTropic Thunder 70. \nTRAN \nYOU ARE A TRESPASSER IN MY POPPY FIELDS! \nYOU ARE D.E.A. SCUM!

Cody looks scared out. of his mind. Speedman takes this in. Traci nods, and TWO GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out of Cody and Four Leaf. Then Tran gets out his own stick and starts to BEAT SPEEDMAN... \nTRAN \nDO YOU WANT THEM TO DIE? DO YOU WANT THEM \nTO DIE!! \nSPEEDMAN No! Puh-Puh-pulease don't h-h-h-hurt them... I Tran cocks his head curiously. He stops beating him..He signals.for the guards to stop beating the others. A long beat. \nTRAN Say that. again., \nSPEEDMAN Please don't hurt them?I \nTRAN No...like you did before! Silence. \nTRAN \nSAY IT! He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils. \nSPEEDMAN Puh-puh-puhlease don't h-h-hurt them? A hush falls over the crowd. Tran'seyes widen. \nTRAN \nTRAN Do the movie. \nSPEEDMAN The whole movie? \nTRAN Yes. Begin. \nSPEEDMAN Hey, I know you're big fans and that's \nGREAT-- Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt. Speedman crumples to the ground. The crowd cheers. \nSPEEDMAN \nOW!!

HOLE -- DUSK \nThe actors look miserable. Portnoy-looks.like his face is going to fall off \nSANDUSKY It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I say we stay in here till it's dark. \nREDYKULOUS I can't believe this is how it ends for Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum recording artist., Shit. \nPORTNOY (shivering and wheezing) I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not gonna make.it... \nSANDUSKY Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're out'here. They'll be looking for us. Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And no one else knows but us. \nLAZARUS That's right. So here's the plan. Everyone leans forward expectantly. \nLAZARUS We sneak out of here, make our way back to the hotel and once we're safe, we alert the government of Speedman's situation. \nREDYKULOUS Sounds good. \nSANDUSKY Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just gonna leave him here? \nTropic Thunder 75. \nINT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND -'COMMAND CENTER \nByon,g stares at the phone, amazed. He looks to Tran. \nTRAN \n(BEAT) \nEXT.

GUARpS. \nEXT. HILLTOP -- NIGHT \nLAZARUS Jaysus! We're too late. They brained him! REDYKULOUS grabs the binoculars. Sees for himself. \nREDYKULOUS He's right, man, that ain't right. Messin' with a man's brain. \nSANDUSKY We gotta get him outta there... \nEXT. HILLTOP -- NIGHT -- LATER \nThe guys have set up a camp, with.a small fire. Everyone watches as Sandusky diagrams a plan in the dirt. \nSANDUSKY' Here's us. Here's the compound.Here's where Speedman was. It looks like they move him at night, cause he's not here now. Unfortunately we have no idea what the layout of that place is. \n(MORE) \nTropic Thunder 79. SANDUSKY (cont'd) But Speedman does. If we can get in there, and find him, maybe he can help us sneak him out. \nPORTNOY (sweating and in pain) I got an idea. Everyone turns to Portnoy. \n11 N 0 6 III4\" \nPORTNOY It might be a little crazy, but... \nREDYKULOUS Crazy is better than nothin'. \nSANDUSKY What is it? \nPORTNOY (intermittent pain noises) Back in '98, I did a low budget titty comedy for skinemax, \"Sex Camp\". Anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girls' camp. So we did it by building a catapult. They shot us over the wall and we parachuted down. The guys all look at each other... then finally: \nLAZARUS That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. \nSANDUSKY Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence. Take our chances. You guys ok with that? The group nods in approval. \nSANDUSKY Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and Redyk are on first watch. (to Lazarus) I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll switch. They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely freaked out. \nI Tropic Thunder 80. \nPORTNOY I'm not gonna make it. \nSANDUSKY Yes you are. \nPORTNOY Then you gotta tie me up. I'm serious. Tie me to a tree. No matter how much I scream, or however much-I plead, you.must not untie me. I will be cunning, I will be in pain, and Iwill lie. The devil works this way. I will say, do, and excrete many regrettable things. But.no matter what.. .you must leave me alone. Beat.. \nSANDUSKY Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him up. We'll get you through it. \nEXT.

Her first single drops tomorrow and I'm not even gonna be there to see it. \nPORTNOY (O.S.) Ohhhhh GOD! THERE'S BARBED WIRE IN MY \nURINE! \nREDYKULOUS I pulled her off the streets six months ago. \nSANDUSKY You did that? \nREDYKULOUS Well, not literally, she was trapped in a dead end record deal with Rick Rubin. Didn't even have a lawyer. Huh. And here I am on the other side of the world. About to die for a guy I barely even know. Makes Redykulous wonder what's it all about. \nSANDUSKY Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to think about. \nPORTNOY (O.S.) \n(TTTTTHHHHWWAAAAAPPP...

Redykuloils. puts his arm around Sandusky to comfort him.. \nREDYKULOUS Hey, it's cool.. I think you're extremely lovable. Weird silence. \nSANDUSKY What? \nREDYKULOUS (removing his arm) I mean like ...like,. I know what you mean.

Redykulous pulls back, and collects himself. \nREDYKULOUS Aww shit... (sniff sniff) I can't. believe it's possibly the last day of my life, and I'm not even gonna be able to let my fans know how truly 'Utterly Redykulous I really am. \nSANDUSKY (with total sincerity) Listen, I know how utterly Redykulous you are. Even for just.thisone moment. . .and sometimes that enough. \nPORTNOY (O.S.) \n(SOUND LIKE A GALLON OF SQUID BEING \nDUMPED INTO AN ALUMINUM PAIL) \nI Tropic Thunder 87. \nREDYKULOUS Thanks man. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- NIGHT \nCody, still awkwardly holding the hooks, is yelling at Four Leaf. \nCODY So all of \"Tropic Thunder\" is bullshit? \nFOUR LEAF No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it happened! \nCODY Are you even a VET!? \nFOUR LEAF YES! Well ...no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not exactly. I served honorably in what they called the \"forced service\". Sanitation Detail at the United States Pentagon. \nCODY So you were some two bit criminal who got caught and sentenced to clean toilets at the Pentagon? I IDOLIZED YOU MAN! \nFOUR LEAF God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a fuckup, sure, but one day as I was cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big- wig, I came across a file headed for the shredder marked top secret. It was Four Leaf Tayback's file. A nobody. No family. Nothing. Killed in Action. They were gonna bury the whole thing. Total black op. \nCODY So you decided to take his identity? \nFOUR LEAF NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story And I gave the American people a hero! Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf, but if I didn't pretend to be him then nobody woulda ever known who he was! See what I'm sayin'? \nTropic Thunder 88. \nCODY And you cashed in! \nFOUR LEAF I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy had a story worth-telling, and nobody woulda ever known!

JUNGLE -- PRE-DAWN \nPORTNOY wakes up, still tied to. the tree, looking like shit. But realizes something-that makes him ecstatic: \nPORTNOY I'm clean! I'M CLEAN!!!!!

He immediately gets nauseous again and heaves. \nPORTNOY (still sick, but cheery) My ' life .be_gins today! \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON THE FLAMING DRAGON INSIGNIA Pull back to reveal that it is on a piece of paper being pulled from a fax machine.

The coast looks clear and they each scamper over... Finally, it's PORTNOY'S turn. He's clearly too heavy. The fence groans under'his weight. He launches himself -- and... THWANG!!! Slams painfully into the razor wire of the fence. GUARDS hear the noise. They raise their weapons and listen.. They see nothing in the pre-dawn darkness... The actors run to the wall and clumsily pull PORTNOY down, just in time. Everyone's inside the perimeter... they quickly make their way along the fence line to the entrance of the main building, ducking away to avoid a LONE GUARD. \nTropic Thunder 92. \nINT. MAIN BUILDING \nSandusky makes a series of hand gestures, indicating for them to'split up and search for Speedman. A beat. The guys all shrug, not understanding. Sandusky repeats the hand gestures.

He spots a box with the words \"For U.S.A., 100% pure, dilute before ingesting\". His mouth LITERALLY waters, and'a drop. of .spittle oozes from his bottom lip. He doesn't know what to do. He gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box. marked \"pure\". It's like holding two grenades... \nHALLWAY Sandusky moves silently toward a door. He kicks it'open to reveal... \nSPEEDMAN Shackled to the floor. Delirious, he sits bolt upright. \nSPEEDMAN You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy. \nSANDUSKY Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I'll be right back! Sandusky runs off to get the guys. \nTropic Thunder 93. \nI\" 1 \nHALLWAY Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus, points to both of his eyes, signalling that he's got \"eyes\",on Speedman. They take a step in that direction. Redykulous stops them, and makes a made up, absurd signal for \"Where is Portnoy?\", somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy. No one knbws what he is doing. \nREDYKULOUS \n(FRUSTRATED) Where is Portnoy?! \nSANDUSKY Shhh! A muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards it. Redykulous kicks it in. \nHEROIN HEAVEN The 'gang flies in, to discover Portnoy holding the bags, crying. \nREDYKULOUS What are you doing, man! \nSANDUSKY Come on, let's go! We found Speedmani \nPORTNOY I don't care! It doesn't matter what I do! I'll always be a screw-up! No one will ever respect me... \nREDYKULOUS That's not true! Listen, back in the day, I used to think I couldn't produce a record simply because... \nSANDUSKY .he's gay. Uh-oh. That's not what Redykulous was about to say.

CODYAND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT -- CONTINUOUS \nFour Leaf wedges one of the hooks in the. door jamb, and Cody does the same with the other. In one fell swoop, :they bust. the door off its hinges. \nE-X-T . DE-T-EN-T-ION-HU-T----DAWN- They emerge into the chaos. IT IS DAYLIGHT NOW. A GUARD runs by, Four Leaf uses the hook to trip him up. Cody knocks him out and grabs his machine gun. He tosses the guard's pistol to Four Leaf. \nCODY By the way, what's your name anyway? \nFOUR LEAF Marvin Kaminsky. \nCODY you ever been in this jungle? \nFOUR LEAF Nope. First time outta the states actually. He shoots off a round and they run for cover. \nTropic Thunder 97. \nINT. SPEEDMAN'S CELL -- CONTINUOUS \nLazarus is right in Speedman's face.

Speedman registers this. \nLAZARUS \n(FRUSTRATED) \nC'MON CHRIS! DAMMIT! YOU MUST KNOW WHO \nYOU ARE! Lazarus's own words make him stop and think. \nLAZARUS (almost to himself) You know who you are... . you do Chris. Long beat. \nLAZARUS Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do this. How can I convince a man he is who we know he is, when I can't even convince myself of the same thing. He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down. \nTropic Thunder 98. \nREDYKULOUS Yo, c'mon, man! Why is everybody gettin'. so insecure alla a sudden?! You're Kirk Lazarus!

JUNGLE. -- A HALF MILE AWAY \nA group of about SIX ASIAN GUERILLA FIGHTERS, well armed and scary looking,,. notice the sound of the explosion. They begin talking very seriously in a foreign language. One of them grabs a radio: \nGUERILLAS \n(SUBTITLES) < We have heard an explosion, in the northern sector.> \nA UNKNOWN VOICE (crackling over walkie talkie), They lock and load, heading towards the actors... \nEXT. JUNGLE -- A.HILLTOP CLEARING \nFour Leaf scans the horizon while. Cody sets up high-tech equipment, including monitors and cameras and detonation devices. \nI Tropic Thunder 41. \nCODY So, I'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives us the go ahead, we'\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdust their cherry with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha till they come running right at, us, then a good of fashioned firefight, maintaining our distance. Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle, looking almost lost. \nCODY I been meaning to tell ya the whole shoot. I'm probably one-a your biggest fans. Your book was kinda my \"Catcher in the Rye\". It inspired me to become a gyro man. Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic stare. \nCODY I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I never was in the service, but for me blowing shit up in a war films is sort of my way of paying tribute to the real deal. And you sir, are the real deal. Nothing. \nCODY Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm you carry? Looks to me like a-- \nFOUR LEAF (very scary) I don't know what it's called. I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life. Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio. \nCODY Ok, we're ready to rock and roll. (to walkie-talkie) Damien, come in. Cameras are up, ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say so. \nTropic Thunder 42. \nEXT. JUNGLE - THE ACTORS \nWE are close on the seemingly broken.walkie talkie,.which has heard none of this. We PULL BACK to reveal the guys, staring at Damien's corpse in total shock. All except Speedman, who looks on with a smirk. \nPORTNOY I think he's like... dead. \nSPEEDMAN: (with a chuckle) Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice, wherever you're hiding! \nREDYKULOUS I don't think he's hiding.. I think he just died! Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse. pulls a wrist into frame. \nSANDUSKY He doesn't. have a pulse ...or a head. He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal. \nSANDUSKY Must've been one of those Claymore mines. This old Jungle must.be full of them., \nREDYKUZOUS You bet your ass it is. That's why a percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are helpin' solve the problem! Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle. Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him -- what the hell? Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent older brother. \nSPEEDMAN C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of the Nam! He's trying to get in our heads! \nTropic Thunder 43. \nGUERRILLAS P.O.V -- FROM THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE They are right behind the treeline, watching the guys from about thirty feet. \nSPEEDMAN That whole \"life and death\" speech in the chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do you think all that \"playing God\" was about? The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief -- except Lazarus. \nLAZARUS Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is dead!! Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides. \nSPEEDMAN Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor here, but, no offense, I've done a lot mote effects driven event films, and I think I can spot a prop body. \n", "test2_true": "ON THE ACTORS Suddenly, The walkie-talkie lying on Damien's body crackles to life: \nCODY (ON WALKIE) -- I repeat, we are now go for mission! \nDAMIE-- The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman picks it up, showing it to the guys. See? \nSPEEDMAN \n(SMIRKING) Alright, can we start the scene now? Or do you need a formal invitation?! (checking the list) Scene 12A, ext. Jungle. Day. Ambush. \nTropic Thunder 44. Speedman closes his eyes, taking a second to get into character. He opens them, and grabs. his gun and creeps towards the bushes, stealthily.. \nSPEEDMAN (as Four Leaf) I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats. The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM \"c'mon!\" type look. Portnoy doesn't know what he means... \nSPEEDMAN I said, I got a baaad feeling on this one, Brooklyn... Oh! He's acting! Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking. stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie. Swinging his gun unpredictably. \nON THE GUERILLAS They are a mere ten or fifteen feet from Sandusky on the other side of the. trees... they back off as. he waves his gun... \nBACK ON THE ACTORS' \nSANDUSKY (-as Brooklyn) Me too, cap'n. \n(BEAT) Hey, cap?: If.I told you something, something kinda personal, you wouldn't think I was crazy, right? \nSPEEDMAN Naw, man. I know you ain't crazy Brooklyn... \nSANDUSKY Well,. if I told you that I, I never actually, well, been with a girl...you wouldn't, like, think I was, like, queer .or nothin'... would you.? \nSPEEDMAN .Naw, man... I wouldn't think you was a queer. \n,I Tropic Thunder 45. \nI\" \u00e2\u0096\u00ba Redykulous shrugs and joins in, too: \nREDYKULOUS (acting really \"black guy\" \nSCARED) Sh...sh...shit ...When I get back to the world, I'm gonna find me the finest piece of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it till I broke its back. \nPORTNOY The last \"mugambo\" you ever tasted was in your momma's soup bowl. I wouldn't mind slurpin' on a little of that -- \nSPEEDMAN That's enough outta you Fats. Don't you worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a fucking ahead of you and I for one ain't gonna let Charlie... Lazarus can't handle it anymore. \nLAZARUS What the FUCK is wrong with you people?! Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back. He addresses the treeline. \nSPEEDMAN Sorry Damien! Back to one... action! (he gets back in character) Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta \nLOTTA-- \nLAZARUS Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED! Speedman sighs, annoyed. \nSPEEDMAN How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some of us are taking this seriously. Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive transformation -- Everything except for his skin color returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick. \nLAZARUS (Heavy Irish) Jaysus! There isn't going to be any movie, ya gobshite! \n(MORE) \nTropic Thunder 46. LAZARUS (cont'd) Damien is dead, Speedman. Yes,_the show must go on, but this is feckin' madness. \nPORTNOY (re: Lazarus transformation) i Wow. That was really cool. \nTHE GUERILLAS Are watching this, poised to attack. \n", "test3_input": "(PAUSE) Ohhhhh-Maaaaaaannn...I'm cold. It's \nFREEEZING.. \nREDYKULOUS \nWOULD YOU PAH-LEEZE.SHUT THE FUCK UP!- \nPORTNOY (after a beat) Ohhh GOD! Is'anybody BOILING!? It's like a sweat lodge out here! \nLAZARUS Make a note gentlemen,. unwittingly, Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have suffered for art. (to Portnoy) A new frontier for you, Funny Man. When this is all over, you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience. Portnoy looks a little hurt. \nREDYKULOUS You know what? I think I actually liked you better when you were a nigga. \nLAZARUS You know, Redykulous', I respect what it is you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking -- invented by the Irish I might add. \n(MORE) \nTropic Thunder 59. LAZARUS (cont'd) Yet you ooze this hostility towards me. Why do you think that-is? \nREDYKULOUS \"Why\"?! I dunno...maybe because they had one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white guy. \nLAZARUS Oh...I see...Put another way -- you're mad because I can act \"black\" better than you can. \nSANDUSKY Take it easy guys... \nREDYKULOUS (to Sandusky) You better rein in 'black like me' over here, before I put a foot in his white ass... \nLAZARUS Niggaz always got to be niggaz. This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at Lazarus. They fight. Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw. Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart. \nSANDUSKY Okay! That's enough! Jesus Christ! It's not enough we have people shooting at us! Now we have to kill each other?! Let's pull it together! This place is full of land mines! Or doesn't anyone's sense memory recall our director being blown up by onel? That shut them up. \nLAZARUS Sandusky is right... we could all learn a little from his common sense approach. From now on we walk Indian style, footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you take first position. He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look. \nTropic Thunder 60. \nLAZARUS Your bravery shames us. Sandusky reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for land mines with the branch. The guys follow at a VERY safe distance. EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT AM l u I, I nhy CLOSE. ON Speedman's face. After a beat.a drop of water hits him in the.forehead. Then another. PULL BACK to reveal a pathetic shelter made. out of headphone. wire, and the In Style magazine.' The drip-is now becoming full on RAIN. He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick. Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule. He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and begins to stalk his prey. Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of. fur... Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness, and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is heard... \nQUICK SHOTS OF: FANGS, BLOOD, AN EYEBALL, A HUGE PAW... Speedman is slashed, SOMETHING has got him in a choke hold... He reels around screaming.and stabbing wildly, brutally pummeling his attacker. He is. covered in blood, but looks ecstatic. \nSPEEDMAN Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die! Speedman deals a death blow. And unleashes a primal VICTORY SCREAM. Spent, he finally gets a good look at his victim: A.small, cute, cuddly PANDA... Speedman looks horrified... \n,i ,Tropic Thunder 61. \nI\" 1 FLASH on a SERIES OF STILLS from SPEEDMAN'S PANDA PHOTO \nSHOOT... He stumbles back against a tree. Suddenly we hear an odd VIBRATING SOUND. He jumps, and - frantically jams his hands in his pants it is the forgotten satellite phone he hid there way back when. \nCLOSE ON PHONE -- CALLER ID SAYS \"RICK PECK\" Speedman answers... \nINT. AGENCY OFFICE -- L.A. --DAY \nRick is on a Pilates machine in is office with a HOT PILATES INSTRUCTOR working him out. \nRICK I got the personal attache of Bien Den Phu's ambassador to the United Nations of America delivering a TiVo directly to your bedroom. But the bad news is you gotta sit down and have monkey brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper. \nWE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM \nSPEEDMAN \n(FREAKED) I killed one rick. The thing I love more than anything in the world... \n", "test3_true": "SPEEDMAN No! A Panda! I killed a panda! \nRICK You WHAT? Uhy. Heavy shit National Park. Oh jeesus...take a breath.. .did anybody see you? \nSPEEDMAN \nYOU HAVE TO HELP ME RICK! \nTropic Thunder 62. \nRICK Chill zone, buddy, 1im thinking. Did anyone see you do this? \nI \nSPEEDMAN I don't think so. I'm out in.the bush. Alone. \nRICK Alright. Listen to me. I want.you to.get your hands on some-bleach, some hydrogen peroxide and some lime. Your gonna wanna cut the body in quarters ... the femurs are gonna be a bitch... that's normal... Speedman'nods eagerly, absorbing it all, not noticing a \nPIANO. WIRE BEING SLIPPED AROUND HIS NECK... Suddenly, he'is being choked.-He drops the phone, gasping for.air... \nRICK (O.S.) Chris? Breathe.! It's gonna be ok.. I'm calling that publicist right now, the one J Lo hired when she was'hammered and killed that kid with her Jetski. A guerilla shoots the phone. They quickly tie Speedman.up and whisk him'off into the jungle. \nEXT. FLAMING DRAGON COMPOUND -- DAWN \nSpeedman is being led through the courtyard in:shackles. He looks up to the guard towers. There are security cameras everywhere. In Speedman''s mind, movie cameras. He nods, into it. \nSPEEDMAN (under his breath) Alright. P.O.W camp. Scene 67..Bring it on Dorf. \nINT. CODY AND FOUR LEAF'S DETENTION HUT \nCody is just coming to. Four Leaf is already at the slatted window, watching... \nCODY Where are we? \nTropic Thunder 63. \nFOUR LEAF In a detention hut. And they got Speedman... \nFOUR LEAF'S P.O.V. -- A guard shoves Speedman hard with a rifle butt. Speedman over \"acts\" the pain. \nBACK ON CODY AND FOUR LEAF Cody gets up, starting to freak out \nCODY What? Why? We gotta get outta here! Are they gonna kill us? Four Leaf turns on him, grabbing him with one of his hooks. \nFOUR LEAF Pull it together private! Shut your trap before you get us killed! You understand me , lilydick? ! Cody backs off, still scared. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER \nSpeedman is in a windowless hut, his feet and hands tied to a chair. There are security cameras in the corners of the room, which Speedman continually plays to. Byong stands across from him, watching him calmly. \nA \nBYONG What were you doing in our poppy fields? \nSPEEDMAN \n(CONFUSED) Poppy fields? \nBYONG Who sent you here? \nSPEEDMAN \n"}

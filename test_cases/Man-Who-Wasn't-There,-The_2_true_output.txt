We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment. It is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests too big for the space and all going too seed. Surface areas are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its feeble light. 
Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of the murmuring. Her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration as she mumbles. 
ED (V.O.) I visited a woman who was supposed to have powers in communicating with those who had passed across, as she called it. She said that people who passed across were picky about who they'd communicate with, not like most people you run into on this side... 
The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed. 
WOMAN Giff me your hant. 
Ed places his hand in the center of the table. 
ED (V.O.) ...so you needed a guide who they didn't mind talking to, someone with a gift for talking to souls... 
Ed looks at the woman's spotted and vein-lined hand as it rests upon his. Her mumbling resumes. 
ED (V.O.) ...Well, first she told me that my wife was in a peaceful place, that our souls were still connected by some spiritual bond, that she had never stopped loving me even though she'd done some things she wasn't proud of... 
Ed looks up at the old woman. 
ED (V.O.) ...She was reading me like a book. 
She is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction. 
ED (V.O.) ...And then she started talking about 'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that and was there anything I wanted to tell 'Dolores,' and I knew I'd just be telling it to the old bat. And even if somehow Doris could hear, it wouldn't be on account of this so- called medium. 
APARTMENT HALLWAY 
Ed is leaving. 
ED (V.O.) She was a phony. Just another gabber. 
EXT. TENEMENT 
Ed emerges from the building. 
ED (V.O.) I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger, Big Dave's wife. I had to turn my back on the old lady, on the veils, on the ghosts, on the dead, before they all sucked me in... 
Ed disappears into the night. 
ABUNDAS HOUSE 
It is night. We are looking through the screen door. Walter Abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the side of the staircase, over which papers are strewn. He is murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers, glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand. 
Ed's hand enters to rap on the door. Walter looks up, sets the phone down and comes to the door. 
WALTER Ed, how're you holding up? 
ED I'm OK, Walter, thanks. 
Walter opens the door to him. 
WALTER I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible. 
ED Yeah. 
WALTER Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here. 
ED Sure, Walter. Thanks. 
PARLOR 
Birdy also has papers spread across a table in front of her: homework. She looks up at Ed's entrance. 
BIRDY Hello, Mr Crane. 
ED Hello, Birdy. 
BIRDY We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry. 
Ed sits across from her.

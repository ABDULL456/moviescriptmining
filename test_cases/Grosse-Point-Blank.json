Boatman & John Cusack NEW CRIME PRODUCTIONS Registered WGA --address deleted --for privacy -- phone deleted MAY 4, 1994 \nFADE IN: \nROLL CREDITS OVER: \nEXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN \nVARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of brilliant greens: \nA POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD \npops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew- soaked lawn. \nFLEET OF DUCKLINGS \nNo mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes. \nGRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER \nAt the bottom of a water hazard. \nPALM FRONDS \nAfter a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt Cobain suet of \"WHAT I DID FOR LOVE,\" as we CRANE DOWN the palms to \nA BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL. \nJust on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips it out. The trousers walk out after it. \nHANDS \nDigging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black. \nYELLOW TROUSERS \nIn a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green and into the hole. \nTHE GLOVED HAND \nSets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half- squat. He is MARTIN BLANK. \nWe SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, another green is barely visible through groves of trees and rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He could be an investment banker, or an arms trader. \nMARTIN'S ARM \nFlinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second later in the distance, the \nRED SWEATER'S HEAD \nSeems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His body crumples to the green. \nMARTIN \nReturns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers absently... \nMARTIN Hooked it. \nINT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER \nThe outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk. \nCLUB MEMBER #1 I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning. \nCLUB MEMBER #2 (to Martin) He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five. \nCLUB MEMBER #1 It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value. \nCLUB MEMBER #3 That's the way life is. The only meaning and value is what we create. Through structure, and discipline. Though they seem to limit our freedom, they actually give us great comfort. Your problem is you're looking for some great answer. Some ultimate truth. When what you really should do is go to work and go home. \nMARTIN I work alone. \nDRIVER That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, \"Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!\" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right? \nMARTIN You understand the psychology of the job. \nDRIVER I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it. \nINT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER \nThe car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror. \nDRIVER You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I? \nMARTIN No. \nDRIVER Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are. \nMARTIN Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural. \nDRIVER (laughs to himself at this great truth) It's only natural.... \nThe Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis \nDRIVER I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you. \nMARTIN Okay. \nDRIVER Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind. (beat) I am part of what I call a brain syndicate. \nNo reaction from Martin. \nDRIVER I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain. \nMARTIN (indicates) Up on the right. \nDRIVER And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it? \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nA sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for a moment. \nMARTIN If it's not there, I can't proceed. Tell them. \nMartin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying on the bed. \nMARTIN Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. I'm only in town tonight. \nHe breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a silencer. \nMARTIN What's different this time than the last time? I have to be down front... \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME \nMartin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the scope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests across the arm of a chair. \nMARTIN ...I don't bother to call anyone else because you always take care of me. \nHe glances over to a second window to his left, which offers a view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the scope and sees \nMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2 \nA few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING. \nMARTIN Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands full here. \nHe sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching the messenger. \nMARTIN Good. Account number 3649367, transfer to account number 96-546-38739-47825. Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's Mr. Duckman. If there are any problems, access file 673594638-IO- 98, and look at it. \nMartin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the rifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the high-rise. \nnow wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off. \nINT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY \nMartin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again on the cellular. \nMARTIN ...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella. \nMARCELLA Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you. \nMARTIN Patch him through.... \nMartin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is GROCER. \nMARTIN What do you want? \nGROCER I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts. \nMARTIN Like a union? \nGROCER Like a club. Work less, make more. \nMARTIN Thank you, no. \nGROCER We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor. \nMARTIN And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me.... \nGrocer ignores this. \nGROCER It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in. \nMARTIN Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild. \nGROCER I'm gonna get you, kid. \nMartin hangs up and pulls away. \nINT. AIRLINER - DAY \nMartin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with an airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. He looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon... \nINT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT \nMartin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nMartin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin bottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes them down with a reddish-orange beverage. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nMartin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps his chest. \nWOMAN (V.O.) \"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's been ten years? Where are you now...? \nAfter a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones. \nCLOSE-UP: WIRE \nfrom the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with one unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a walkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the box, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to the floor. \nWOMAN (V.O.) ...Are you guiding an Outward Bound canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or perhaps in charge of appearances for the NFL like Leslie Gunther....? \nMARTIN - A MINUTE LATER \ndraws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil and twice as long, by a string. \nVIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER \nThe greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY MAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread snakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. We PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. KEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers the thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole in the floor. \nINT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY \nA small suite of dry-walled offices. \nEAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY \nis stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She is MARCELLA MAYES. \nMARCELLA ...So come on back to the old oak tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion committee.\" \nMarcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For the first time, Martin looks scared. \nMARTIN Throw that away. \nMARCELLA This? \nMARTIN Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living. \nMARCELLA It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip? \nMARTIN Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail. \nMARCELLA All of it? \nMARTIN And not show it to me. Ever again. \nMARCELLA That's going to cost. \nMARTIN I'll pay. \nMartin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella stops him. \nMARCELLA They're not happy, sir. \nMARTIN I'm not happy. \nMARCELLA They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep. \nMARTIN He didn't. \nMARCELLA They blame you for the compromise. \nMARTIN And they want me to make up for it. \nMARCELLA In Detroit. This weekend. \nMARTIN Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time. \nMARCELLA They were very upset. \nMARTIN Would you describe their position as inflexible? \nMARCELLA Intractable, sir. You leave tonight. \nMarcella looks concerned. \nMARCELLA And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one.... \nMARTIN There's nothing to be done about it. \nMARCELLA I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia. \nMARTIN Good. What else? Anything interesting? \nMARCELLA Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one. \nShe hands him a piece of paper. He scans it. \nMARCELLA Enough? \nMARTIN Never enough. \nDR. OATMAN How do you know? \nMARTIN I just know. \nDR. OATMAN Say more. \nMARTIN They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say? (sarcastic) \"I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork.\" \nOatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee. \nDR. OATMAN You needn't be so frank with me about your work. \nMARTIN Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be \"withholding\"... and I know where you live. \nDR. OATMAN You know where I live? \nMARTIN We're both professionals, Oatman. \nDR. OATMAN I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, \"Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens.\"  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families. \nMARTIN So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around? \nDR. OATMAN Yes. \nMARTIN Mmm. \nBeat. \nDR. OATMAN And how have you been feeling about your... work lately? \nMARTIN Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me. \nINT. CHURCH - \nSERIES OF QUICK SHOTS: \nMARTIN \nFrom the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount the altar.  A priest in fact. \nMARTIN'S HANDS \nopen the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He returns the chalice to the cabinet. \nMARTIN (V.O.) The church seems to be purging itself of it's pedophile. \nMARTIN \nSits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He watches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a prayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the altar. \nMARTIN (V.O.) It's a bull market. \nC.U. OF ALTAR CARPET \nThe chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits the ground. \nMARTIN (V.O.) Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys. \nDR. OATMAN (V.O.) Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed. \nINT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMARTIN If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway. \nDR. OATMAN What stuff? \nMARTIN (dismissive) Morality. \nOatman's glad the session's just about over. \nDR. OATMAN Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel. \nMartin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car. \nWIDE SHOT \nof Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the clerk inside. \nMARTIN What are you doing here? \nCARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question. \nCARL A double shift. What's it look like? (softening) Can I help you with something? \nMartin's head pans the room, processing. \nMARTIN I don't think so. \nEXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING \nMartin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar landscape. \nMARTIN (into phone) Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick up if you're there... It's Martin Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not here. My house is gone and now there's a 7-11 here... And that's unfortunate... You can never go home again, Dr. Oatman. \nMartin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go. \nMARTIN (to himself) But I guess you can shop there. \nINT. NURSING HOME - DAY \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. \nof a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating. \nNURSE Mary, your son's here. \nThe nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They start out of the room. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY \nThey walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes and hacks. \nMARY I bought a new rug. \nMARTIN That's wonderful, Mom. \nMARY What's a revival tent? \nMARTIN It's a place where religious people-- \nMARY (knowingly) Marlin Perkins and Jim! \nMARTIN Jim? \nMARY His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass! \nMary coughs horribly. \nMARTIN It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing. \nMARY I spoke to your father the other day. \nMARTIN I imagine that'd be rather difficult. \nMARY Nature made him then broke the mold. \nMartin decides to change the subject. \nMARTIN They told me you're taking lithium, mom. \nMARY Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache. \nMARTIN You have a headache? \nLARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V. \nof Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the radio station. He gets out, looking nervous. \nINT. RADIO STATION - DAY \nDebi flips on the \"ON-AIR\" switch and prepares to speak into the microphone. Martin walks in. Debi sees him. They stare at each other. The song ends. Dead air. After a moment... \nDEBI (on air, groping) WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. Oldies from the eighties. That was ah... the Specials. Doing... one of their songs... \nDebi turns to turntable B and finds it empty. She turns back to turntable A and lets the record roll on. \nDEBI ...and here's another. \nDebi swivels around to face Martin. \nMARTIN \"Oldies from the eighties?\" \nAfter a long pause.... \nDEBI I just play my own collection. \nMARTIN It's nice to see you again. \nDebi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock. \nMARTIN How long has it been? \nDEBI Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word? \nMARTIN Ten years, I think. What I miss? \nDebi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense. \nDEBI Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months. \nMARTIN Here is now there. There is here. \nTheir eyes lock on each other... \nDEBI Those are the headlines. \nThe request line buzzes. \nDEBI Hold that thought. (into phone) WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, all the... (pauses) No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years. \nBeat. Debi makes the move. \nDEBI Tell me about yourself. \nMARTIN I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really. \nDEBI That's it? \nMARTIN Not much else. \nDEBI What's your business? \nMARTIN I'm a professional killer. \nDEBI Professional killer. Do you get dental with that? \nBeat. \nMARTIN Well, I'm in town for a few days, anyway. \nThey run out of words, the moment too big for small talk. Martin gets the fear, breaks it off. \nMARTIN Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back. \nDEBI Okay. \nSOUTHTEC GUARD Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer. \nThe woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back. \nMARTIN So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me. \nSOUTHTEC GUARD To shoot you. Correct. \nMARTIN How did you get this job? \nSOUTHTEC GUARD Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course... \nMARTIN (pleasantly) Wow. \nPaul walks the happy couple down the steps. \nPAUL (to couple) ...What more can I say. \nHUSBAND (smiling) We'll talk soon. \nPAUL (much hand gesturing) You'll be raising your new family in a work of art. A work of art in a work of art. \nPaul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the sell. \nSOUTHTEC GUARD I'm sure you'll be very happy. \nAll look to Martin.... \nMARTIN (heartfelt) When my time comes, if it ever does, I want a beautiful, normal place like this... and a wife like you... \nAll are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard. \nMARTIN ...and you'll be safe here... \nPaul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders. \nEXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE \nLardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house in the distance. \nINT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER \nMartin and Paul cut through a particularly charming neighborhood. \nPAUL Now. I don't make a habit of pimping my friends, but there is one prime little piece of land that you must see... \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. \nA sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the house. \nMARTIN (V.O.) Debi's house. \nPAUL (V.O.) Kind of crept up on you, didn't it? \nC.U. OF MARTIN \nMARTIN No. You drove us here. \nPAUL Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it? \nMARTIN No. \nMartin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the window. \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. \nof the mansion. \nThey roll slowly by Debi's house. \nThey drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin. \nMARCELLA Hey there, how'd it go? \nINT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT \nMartin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel. \nMARTIN It isn't done. \nMarcella pauses, taking this in. \nMARCELLA This is not good. \nMARTIN I'll do it tomorrow. \nMarcella considers this. \nMARCELLA What's it look like? \nMARTIN It's fine. \nMARCELLA You haven't looked at the dossier. \nMARTIN (a little defensive) I've looked at it. \nMartin eyes the vent. \nMARCELLA You have. \nMARTIN Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all. \nMARCELLA I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late. \nMARTIN Tell them my house exploded. \nBeat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this. \nMARCELLA I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional. \nMARTIN Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great. \nMARCELLA Will do. \nMartin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over in his hands, and tosses it on the bed. \nBRIEFCASE \nWe catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the envelope and is about to tear the seal when \nTHE PHONE RINGS \nMartin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver. \nDEBI (filtered) Are you there? \nMARTIN Yes. \nDEBI Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time. \nBeat. \nDEBI Hello...? \nMARTIN This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship. \nDEBI You're fucking psycho. \nMARTIN Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in. \nShe hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed. \nGUNS, BULLETS, ETC. \nGrocer looks a little hurt. \nMARTIN (easing up) Look, this is a one-on-one business... Every time you get to know people, bad things happen. If it'll make you feel any better, this is my last job. So what do you say we put our guns away and forget the whole damn thing. \nGrocer loses it. \nGROCER Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, everything's regulated! \nLong beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself. \nMARTIN No deal. \nGROCER Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job... \nMARTIN (Wry) Is that right? \nGROCER Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole. \nMARTIN Nice talk, Sugarmouth. \nINT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nMartin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile... \nMARTIN (trying on smile) Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell couch insurance. I test-market positive thinking. I lead a weekend men's group, actually. We specialize in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh. (sarcastic) Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me? I'm not married, I have no kids and I'd blow your brains out if someone paid me enough... So how've you been? Where do you stand on The Issues? Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, shamed, blahblahblahblah-- \nEXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING \nMartin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers. \nDEBI Flowers. That's funny. \nMARTIN As long as I get the laugh. \nDEBI (taking them) Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol. \nShe backs into the house, and he follows. \nINT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nMartin follows Debi into the hall. Both are enjoying this atavistic ritual. \nMARTIN You look beautiful. \nDEBI Okay... Hold on... \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. \nthrough a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of MR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a Barcolounger. \nDEBI (V.O.) ...Let me get my coat. \nMARTIN I'll just help myself to a cocktail. \nDEBI \nmoves up the stairs and disappears. \nMARTIN \nlooks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the den. \nINT. DEN - CONTINUOUS \nMr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of hair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to Martin. \nMARTIN Good evening, Mr. Newberry. \nMR. NEWBERRY Good evening, Mr. Blank. \nMARTIN How are you? How's business? \nMARTIN This is me breating. \nMartin takes in a few breaths. \nMARITN Alright, look. I gotta go. \nDR. OATMAN And don't kill anyone. \nMARTIN Right. Don't kill anyone... \nINT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME \nFelix rummages delicately around the room. He goes to the \nNIGHTSTAND \nThe reunion invite. \nFELIX \npicks it up and scans it. \nEXT. GROSSE POINT HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK \nLardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch Martin and Debi pull into a space. \nLARDNER He's falling for her. Look at him. \nMCCULLERS He using her. \nLARDNER You're wrong. Look at his face. \nMCCULLERS One cannot love and kill. \nLARDNER (defensive) I love. I kill. \nMARTIN AND DEBI \nclimb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym. \nMARTIN (to himself) Shoulda brought my gun. \nDEBI What? \nHe pulls himself off the car and heads toward \nGROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL \nA sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It is topped by church-like towers. It's scary. \nINT. GYM - NIGHT \nMartin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. A benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball nets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low and the music is loud. Alumni are dancing. \nARLENE Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph. \nMARTIN I'm Martin Blank. \nDEBI Debi Newberry. \nDebi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands Martin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to say. Martin wasn't part of her crowd. \nARLENE Marty, you haven't changed a bit! \nMARTIN Don't say that. \nArlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags have YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag uncomfortably. \nARLENE We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was! \nMARTIN Wonderful. \nMARTIN (remembering) Drafting. \nTERRY Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking class. But I appreciate you helping me out, man. \nMARTIN Don't mention it. \nTERRY Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try and get out of here, man. I'll see you later. \nTerry slinks off. \nBAR - SAME \nBob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns to leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN KORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy. \nDAN Bob. Bob Destephano. \nBOB What? \nDAN I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky. \nBOB Computer guy. \nDAN Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day. \nBOB I sell BMW's. What do you do? \nDAN Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really. \nThere's a sudden lull in the conversation. Bob tries his drunken hand at relating... \nBOB Remember high school? \nDAN Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands? \nDan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. Bob walks off shaking his head and smiling bitterly. \nINT. GYM - LATER \nDebi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others in an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are arriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, is in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of Martin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non- stop sports conversation. \nMIKE ...You gotta hold the fans responsible, though, Dennis, because they're the ones putting up with the mediocre product. \nDENNIS I guess, though, you know, if you look at it Mike, that park is a beautiful park, I've gone to that park many times - I've had the greatest time of my life at that ballpark and let's face it, I tell you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, if you're having the fun you should be having at Tigers Stadium, you don't even know what the hell's going on anyway... \nThey both crack up at this. \nANGLE ON DARIUS, MARTIN, & DEBI \nDARIUS Have you two been together since high school? \nDEBI No-- \nMARTIN --Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna-- \nDEBI We haven't seen each other since high school. \nDARIUS I figured. You two look too happy together. I shouldn't say that though, I'm married... So, Martin-- what are you up to these days? What do you do for a living? \nDebi perks up; this should be interesting. \nMARTIN I'm in pro-active international relations. It's a very specialized company. We execute economic investment opportunities. Sort of economic clean-up... with an emphasis on personnel. It's boring, you know, it's boring. I don't like to talk about it because I don't think what a man does necessarily reflects who he is... \nMartin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. Martin may be in trouble. \nMARTIN ...I've always tried to refrain from a black-and-white moral lexicon--you know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've been more interested in the gray areas. \nSilence. Martin pushes on. \nMARTIN But that's no way to live. I guess you've got to just take the leap of faith. Believe in something. Fuck it. \nDARIUS Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you happy? \nMartin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene. He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back. \nGROUP OF MEN \nDAN Look at her. There it is. Jenny Slater. The finest thing that ever walked these halls. \nFORMER-SQUARE #2 I believe she married the state of Maine. \nDAN Yeah, he's around here somewhere. What a shame. She would have looked great in my fucking Bentley. \nFORMER-SQUARE #3 No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only was she as fine, if not finer, than Slater, but she had the \"bad girl\" thing going for her. And the red hair. C'mon. \nDAN She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois. \nFORMER-SQUARE #2 You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti was the finest. No question about it. \nFORMER-SQUARE #3 The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. All named Jenny... \nDAN You know what I'm really hoping? That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And she's twenty-eight-- \nFORMER-SQUARE #3 --she's got half the state of Maine-- \nDAN She's twenty-eight years old, with two kids, she's still really really fine, and I see her at a bookstore or something, and she sees me for what I was then, and what I am now: the redemption for all her failure. \nFORMER-SQUARE #3 You mean the redemption for all your failure. \nThey ponder this. Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating on Debi. \nBOB DESTEPHANO \nDancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GYM - DEEJAY BOOTH - LATER \nMartin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay booth, on a raised stage. They are playing an old sophomoric game. \nDEBI Which would you rather...? \nMARTIN Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week? \nDEBI Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller-- \nMARTIN --She's not dead--- \nDEBI It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth? \nMARTIN Wow. I have to give this some thought. \nDEBI No time. \nMARTIN Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller. \nSTACEY breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified and unsure at what she's heard. \nSTACEY Marty! Debi! How are you! So many people came, but I never expected to see you Marty. Or you Debi... I mean... because of what your divorce... I didn't mean to say that. I just meant you look so good. \nDEBI Thank you. \nSTACEY Do you think you could play \"Too Shy'\" by Kaja Goo Goo? \nDEBI Stacey, why don't you come up here and take over for a little while? \nSTACEY I'd love to. \nStacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as Martin and Debi make their way down. \nDEBI (to Martin) Everybody thinks they know me now that I'm divorced. \nShe leads Martin toward the exit. \nBob crumbles. \nBOB Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it... \nMARTIN You could've been a contender, huh? \nBob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without the use of cliches. \nBOB Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how smart you are with my foot up your ass! I'm gonna kick your ass! \nMartin steps to Bob. \nMARTIN Why would you want to hit me, Bob? Do you really believe that there's some stored up conflict that needs resolution between us? We don't exist. There's nothing between us. So who do you want to hit, Bob? It's not me. \nBob slumps against the lockers, deflated. \nBOB What am I gonna do? \nMARTIN What do you want to do? \nBOB I want to be an actor. \nMARTIN Then express yourself, Bob. \nBob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself. \nMARTIN (catching him) Be honest... \nBob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, then stops abruptly, and smiles. \nBOB Later, Martin. \nBob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight. Martin watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the doors of a stairwell, disappearing. \nINT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS \nBob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the stairs. He encounters Debi, on her way up. He glances at her but does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and quickens her pace up the stairs... \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nMartin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and relaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of his attacker-- \nFELIX \nimpaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back. \nMARTIN AND FELIX \nare frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The stairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the sound. His eyes lock onto \nDEBI \nwho is frozen, horrified for a moment. She flees. \nMARTIN \nlooks back at \nFELIX \nDead. \nTHE FLOOR \nA growing pool of blood. \nMARTIN \nLooks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers. Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming \n\"SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1\" \nMARTIN I have to get my head back into my work. \nPAUL Work's good for the soul. \nMartin gets up to leave. \nMARTIN When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry. \nPAUL See you in ten years. \nPaul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better of it. \nINT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT \nMartin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed. \nMARTIN PULLS \nTHE DOSSIER from the briefcase. It's seal is broken, but the contents remain enclosed... He withdraws the package and dumps the contents on the bed. His face registers muted shock. \nMARTIN Dumb fucking luck... \nTHE CONTENTS \ninclude various photos of MR. NEWBERRY, Mr. Newberry with Debi, and the house. The photos are mingled with official- looking papers including credit reports, medical records, etc... Newberry's life. \nHe cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet... \nDebi moves past him into the room. She is completely calm. \nDEBI He was trying to kill you, right! \nMARTIN Yes. \nDEBI Not the other way around...? \nMARTIN No. \nDEBI Is it something you've done? \nMARTIN It's something I do... \nBeat. \nMARTIN ...Professionally... \nBeat. \nMARTIN ...About five years now. \nDEBI (stunned) Get the fuck outta here. \nMARTIN Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain \"Moral flexibility\" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called \"mechanical operations.\" We sort of found each other... \nDEBI You're a government spook? \nMartin says nothing. \nMARTIN I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work. \nDEBI Jesus Christ! \nMARTIN Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life. \nDEBI Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm.... \nMARTIN Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things. \nDEBI Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath! \nMARTIN (defensive) A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money. \nMARTIN Don't worry. I left you a little something under your desk. \nMartin hangs up. \nMarcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink- wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so. \nMARCELLA All right!! \nINT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR \nMartin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, away from him. \nINT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME \nGrocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them. A SNIPER prepares to blow Newberry's head off. \nINT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR - SAME \nAs he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, he accelerates. \nINT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME \nGrocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry. \nGROCER Oh shit... \nEXT. ROAD - SAME \nNewberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed. \nINT. TOWN CAR - SAME \nMartin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As the distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, Newberry opens the passenger door. \nNEWBERRY What the fuck is the matter with you?! \nMARTIN Well, I was hired to kill you. It's what I do, and come to think of it, I told you that, but... Okay. I'm not going to do it. Get in the car. \nHe does. They drive on. \nMARTIN It's either because I'm in love with your daughter, or because I have a new-found respect for life. Or both. But I don't know. \nINT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME \nGrocer and company watch in amazement. \nGROCER'S P.O.V. \nof Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded driveway. \nGROCER That punk is either in love with that guy's daughter or he has new found respect for life... Let's go. \nEXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME \nMartin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element. \nNEWBERRY Why? I build cars! They're paying you to kill me? Why? \nMARTIN It was a cost-cutting effort. They can't afford a recall. \nNEWBERRY It was a leaky sunroof! A design flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! You want to kill me because of that? \nMARTIN It's not me! Why does everybody think it's personal?! \nThey go through the front door and shut it behind them. \nINT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME \nGrocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway. \nINT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME \nMARTIN I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving. \nGROCER (O.S.) Don't listen to him, he's a professional. \nMartin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled voice coming from the vent. Grocer continues... \nGROCER (O.S.) You're breaking my heart down here, Blank. I can't shoot through the tears. \nMartin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead man. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze firefight... \nEXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME \nLardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window. \nLARDNER Did you see Blank in there? \nMCCULLERS No... \nLARDNER Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble. \nINT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nMARTIN \nreaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading up the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to FIRE, when they hear... \nLARDNER AND MCCULLERS \npower through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, ala Butch and Sundance. \nMartin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and FIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls out of view. \nKITCHEN - INTERCUT \nGROCER \nheads up the back stairs. \nMARTIN \nworks his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the kitchen. \nGROCER \nhears him and starts back down. \nMartin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes out of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, crouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining room, still firing. \nC.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION \nThe last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and the slide on the auto locks back-- empty. \nNORMAL SPEED \nGROCER \nFlying through the air disappearing through the shuttered serving window, his flight carrying him past a television that sits on a lazy susan. \nMARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT \nMartin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in the dining room. The hulking old television sits on the counter above and between them. \nMartin looks up and spies the TELEVISION \nGROCER ...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece? \nMARTIN Okay. \nMartin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter. \nBALLED CHECK \n", "test1_input": "Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer beeps. \n\"confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471\" \nGrocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A graphic appears: \n\"Connection is terminated/ Status idle\" \nGrocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast. \nINT. PLANE - NIGHT \nMartin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, he sets the book down and takes up Iron John. \nINT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING \nAt the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing crowd. \nLARDNER You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man. \nMCCULLERS Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though. \nLARDNER Lisbon? \nMCCULLERS In Portugal, yes. \nIn the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave. \nLARDNER Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man? \nMCCULLERS In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn. \nLardner can neither confirm nor deny this. \nLARDNER You always say that. You always have to know everybody. Why don't I just take the weekend off and let you kill him. Since you two are so close. \nThey exit. \nEXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING \nINSIDE MARTIN'S CAR \nMartin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news. \nBROADCAST (V.O.) ...with highs today in the upper seventies. Related stocks on Wall Street today as scandal continues to rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech Center... \nMARTIN'S CAR \nblows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid- eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied by two figures. \nINSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE \nare Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast. \nBROADCAST (V.O.) ...An unknown \"whistle-blower\" has leaked a number of critical flaws in the safety designs of next year's models to authorities that could cost millions in recalls.... \nMARTIN \nflips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes fascistically. \nMARTIN Mein hero. \n...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on \"Armageddon Time,\" slow reggae vibe by The Clash. \nEXT.

RADIO STATION - DAY \nMartin leaves the station, alone and beaten down. \nMARTIN Dammit. Never trust my instincts. \nHe scans the main strip. \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. \nA MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head.

PAUL'S BMW - DAY \nMartin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide streets lined with huge, shady oaks. Castle-like homes on golf-course green lawns. A comfortable, Midwestern Beverly Hills. They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a joint. \nPAUL This won't take but a minute. I just gotta hold their hands for a final walk-through. I'll take them in, get 'em out, then you and I can grab a little quality time. \nMartin looks out the window, breathing in the past. \nPAUL Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was afraid you joined a cult or something. I half-expected you to come back to town in a fennel wreath and paper pants. \nPaul offers Martin the joint. He declines. \nMARTIN There was no money in it. \nMartin regards Paul archly. \nMARTIN (grinning) So what happened to you? \nPAUL Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team.

He grabs the shoulder or the Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed-- \nSKATEBOARDER What the fuck, man?! \nThe video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of the double doors. \nEXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS \nThe Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell. \nINT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nMartin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style. \nEXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT \nMartin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi looks up from some reading. \"Na\u00efve Melody\" by the Talking Heads plays in the studio. \nMARTIN Are you going to the reunion? \n", "test3_true": "MARTIN That's part of it. \nDEBI Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view... \nMARTIN It's always the little things. \nDEBI Yep. \nBeat. \nMARTIN I'm wondering how you've been. How you are. I'd like to catch up with you. If it's possible. \nBeat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him. \nDEBI Okay. Let's catch up. You go first. \nMARTIN Well, there's not much to tell. \nDEBI I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences. \nMARTIN Bad experiences. \nDEBI You met people. \nMARTIN Bad people. \nDEBI Watched television? \nMARTIN Bad television. \nDEBI (amused) Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku. \nMARTIN What's that? \nDEBI It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever. \nMARTIN That'd be good. \nBeat. \nDEBI What do you want? \nThe question is open. \nMARTIN I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock. \nDEBI Let me get this straight, are you asking me out? \nMARTIN Yes. \nDEBI Unbelievable. \nMARTIN Seven it is. \nDEBI I'll think about it. \nEXT. JOSHUA TREE CAMPSITE - NIGHT \nUnder a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is Marcella reading, \"Women Who Run With Wolves.\"  She tends to s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off. \nMONTY Baby, it's eight o'clock. \nMarcella gets up. \nMARCELLA Thanks, Monty. \nShe tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck. \nINT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS \nMarcella gets in. She shuts the door and dials the phone. \n", "test3_id": 224}

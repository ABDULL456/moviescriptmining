MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT \nMartin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel. \nMARTIN It isn't done. \nMarcella pauses, taking this in. \nMARCELLA This is not good. \nMARTIN I'll do it tomorrow. \nMarcella considers this. \nMARCELLA What's it look like? \nMARTIN It's fine. \nMARCELLA You haven't looked at the dossier. \nMARTIN (a little defensive) I've looked at it. \nMartin eyes the vent. \nMARCELLA You have. \nMARTIN Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all. \nMARCELLA I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late. \nMARTIN Tell them my house exploded. \nBeat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this. \nMARCELLA I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional. \nMARTIN Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great. \nMARCELLA Will do. \nMartin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over in his hands, and tosses it on the bed. \nBRIEFCASE \nWe catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the envelope and is about to tear the seal when \nTHE PHONE RINGS \nMartin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver. \nDEBI (filtered) Are you there? \nMARTIN Yes. \nDEBI Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time. \nBeat. \nDEBI Hello...? \nMARTIN This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship. \nDEBI You're fucking psycho. \nMARTIN Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in. \nShe hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed. \nGUNS, BULLETS, ETC. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. DINER - DAY \nLardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire across the street. \nMCCULLERS I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job. \nLARDNER We can't do our job unless he does his job. \nMCCULLERS Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here. \nLARDNER Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer. \nMCCULLERS Wait a minute-- \nLARDNER -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy. \nMCCULLERS So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys. \nLARDNER Yup. \nThey both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is caught short by the sight of \nLARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV \nGROCER moving into the diner. \nINT. DINER - LATE MORNING \nMartin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets into an apple juice and looking out the window. \nGROCER \nslides into the booth, across from Martin. \nMARTIN AND GROCER \nMartin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican breakfast stand-off. \nGROCER Easy, tiger. \nA waitress approaches. \nWAITRESS Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My name is Melanie and I'll be your server this morning. Let me tell you about some of our specials. Today we have the \"Alfalfa on My Mind,\" our feature omelette. And there's our \"Gatsby's West Egg Omelette.\" And if you're in the mood for something different there's the \"I left my heart in San Franchezie.\" \nMartin and Grocer's eyes remain locked. \nGROCER I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee. \nMARTIN Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette. \nWAITRESS What would you like in the omelette? \nMARTIN Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at all. \nThe waitress nods pertly and leaves. \nGROCER (re: the omelette) Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday. \nMARTIN No harm no foul. \nGROCER A little misunderstanding among my associates. \nBeat. \nGROCER I told them to kill you and they didn't. \nMARTIN Hard to get good help these days. \nGROCER But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship. \nMARTIN I didn't get into this business to have \"associates.\" And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. \"Loner-- \" \"Loner gunman.\" Get it? \"On my own.\" That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something.

He goes to the \nNIGHTSTAND \nThe reunion invite. \nFELIX \npicks it up and scans it. \nEXT. GROSSE POINT HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK \nLardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch Martin and Debi pull into a space. \nLARDNER He's falling for her. Look at him. \nMCCULLERS He using her. \nLARDNER You're wrong. Look at his face. \nMCCULLERS One cannot love and kill. \nLARDNER (defensive) I love. I kill. \nMARTIN AND DEBI \nclimb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym. \nMARTIN (to himself) Shoulda brought my gun. \nDEBI What? \nHe pulls himself off the car and heads toward \nGROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL \nA sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It is topped by church-like towers. It's scary. \nINT. GYM - NIGHT \nMartin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. A benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball nets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low and the music is loud. Alumni are dancing. \nARLENE Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph. \nMARTIN I'm Martin Blank. \nDEBI Debi Newberry. \nDebi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands Martin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to say. Martin wasn't part of her crowd. \nARLENE Marty, you haven't changed a bit! \nMARTIN Don't say that. \nArlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags have YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag uncomfortably. \nARLENE We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was! \nMARTIN Wonderful. \n", "test2_true": "MARTIN Whatever I can get away with. \nShe smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the next arrival. Martin moves off... \nARLENE (to the next person) Isn't it cute. It's so everybody knows who everybody was! \nHe circles the crowded gym. Looking for familiar faces. He stops at the open bar. \nBATENDER What can I make you? \nMARTIN Beer. \nThe bartender gets him a beer. Martin recognizes a guy at the bar. He is well-appointed and shiny. He is KEN ALDRIDGE. \nMARTIN Hey, Ken. How have you been? \nKEN (glancing at Martin's name tag) Hello Martin. How have you been? \nMARTIN Not bad. You? \nBob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. Eye contact is made. \nKEN Hello, Bob. \nMARTIN Hey, Bob. \nBob turns slightly toward them. They continue in their conversation. \nKEN I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer. \nMARTIN That sounds pretty interesting... \nBob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how. \nKEN Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury. \nMARTIN Those all seem kind of related... \nBob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him go. \nMARTIN Tragedy makes you thirsty. \nKen chuckles. The bartender arrives with the bottle. Martin grabs it and begins to move off. \nMARTIN Well... I have to take this over to Debi. \nKEN Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients. \nKen hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and business address printed on the shaft. Martin reads it and puts it in his kerchief pocket. \nMARTIN Thanks. \nKen goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar. \nMARTIN \nmakes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers. TERRY emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts Martin. His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to Martin. \nTERRY I don't know, Blank, all these fucking people, driving me crazy. Look at them over there, memorializing old times, acting all like it was something \"life-changing.\" And the people in the National Honor Society? The name tags? \nMartin shrugs. \nTERRY They have special blue starts on them like it fucking matters now that they were in the honor club ten years ago. I'm getting fucking nauseous from all this sentimental bullshit. It's making me sick. \nTerry stops suddenly as if he's finished. Martin reads this man's nametag. \nMARTIN Why are you here... Terry? \nTerry turns on a dime. \nTERRY I wanted to see a couple people. But I don't want to talk about the old days... What did we have together, Martin? Typing? \n", "test2_id": 223, "test3_input": "MARTIN I have to get my head back into my work. \nPAUL Work's good for the soul. \nMartin gets up to leave. \nMARTIN When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry. \nPAUL See you in ten years. \nPaul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better of it. \nINT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT \nMartin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed. \nMARTIN PULLS \nTHE DOSSIER from the briefcase. It's seal is broken, but the contents remain enclosed... He withdraws the package and dumps the contents on the bed. His face registers muted shock. \nMARTIN Dumb fucking luck... \nTHE CONTENTS \ninclude various photos of MR. NEWBERRY, Mr. Newberry with Debi, and the house. The photos are mingled with official- looking papers including credit reports, medical records, etc... Newberry's life. \nHe cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet... \nDebi moves past him into the room. She is completely calm. \nDEBI He was trying to kill you, right! \nMARTIN Yes. \nDEBI Not the other way around...? \nMARTIN No. \nDEBI Is it something you've done? \nMARTIN It's something I do... \nBeat. \nMARTIN ...Professionally... \nBeat. \nMARTIN ...About five years now. \nDEBI (stunned) Get the fuck outta here. \nMARTIN Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain \"Moral flexibility\" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called \"mechanical operations.\" We sort of found each other... \nDEBI You're a government spook? \nMartin says nothing. \nMARTIN I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work. \nDEBI Jesus Christ! \nMARTIN Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life. \nDEBI Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm.... \nMARTIN Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things. \nDEBI Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath! \nMARTIN (defensive) A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money. \n", "test3_true": "MARTIN I was leaving. \nDEBI That's probably a good idea. \nMARTIN Will you come with me? \nDEBI I'm staying here. \nMARTIN What if I come back? \nDEBI I'll hide. \nShe goes for the door. \nMARTIN Don't go. \nShe stops at the door. Slowly, she turns. \nDEBI You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate. \nMARTIN You don't understand... \nDEBI That's because I speak human, and you speak monster. \nDebi bolts out of the room. Martin is left alone. \nMartin looks over at his gear on the bed. After a beat, he walks slowly over and surveys his tools. He picks up a cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently singing to himself... \nMARTIN \"What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's up Doc, are you lookin'...? \nINT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAWN \nMorning light comes through the slit in the curtains, picking up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the bed, almost geometrically spaced. Martin lifts one at a time, checking their bores and actions... \nINT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - MORNING \nLardner and McCullers gear up. They each finish loading the last of many clips... \nEXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - MORNING \nGrocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off onto an exit ramp. Grocer has assembled a team of about nine. They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin loading... \nINT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME \nLardner and McCullers jam clips into their service autos and knock the slides... \nINT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME \nMartin finished loading his guns, and puts them in his case. He shuts it and moves for the door. On the way out he stops and looks himself in the mirror before exiting. \nEXT. THREE DIFFERENT ROADS - INTERCUT \nEach car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable... \nINT. EASTWEST HOLDING COMPANY - INTERCUT \nMarcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, and holds a two-gallon gas can. She moves from room to room pouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of paper stacked on the floor. She adds a splash to her copy of \"Women Who Run With the Wolves.\" \nMARCELLA I'm bringing down the office now. \nShe picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor. It's cathartic. \nINTERCUT WITH MARTIN IN THE TOWN CAR - \nMARTIN I'll put things right. Then I'll find you. \nSilence on the line. \nMARCELLA (apprehensive) Uh... why? \nMartin finishes his weapons check, and pulls out the dossier. \n", "test3_id": 224}

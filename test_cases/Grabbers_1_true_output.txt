Eggs piled high like a fun fare ball pit. He barely has time to process this as O'Shea and Lisa come bounding towards him. 
PADDY The eggs are buried on the beach! There's feckin' loads of 'em! 
LISA Run! 
Paddy regards the egg then takes off after O'Shea and Lisa. And in the gouged out sand beneath their feet more exposed EGGS flutter with life. These things are close to hatching. 
INT. LAB - DAY 
O'Shea, Lisa and Paddy stumble in, making a beeline for the Grabber female on the table. Smith looks up from his laptop to see O'Shea who has a petrol can and a plan in mind. 
SMITH Good, you're back. I have a theory! Those whales were killed as a food source for their spawn -- 
O'SHEA The eggs are buried at the beach. 
SMITH Exactly. 
LISA We know. 
SMITH Oh. 
PADDY Well done. 
SMITH What are you doing? 
O'SHEA Everywhere that's been, the other one's followed. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         50. 
SMITH You found another one?     Where? 
O'SHEA It tried to eat us! And it's HUGE and looking for her ... but this will be the last place it looks. 
He pours petrol all over it.    Lisa hands him the lighter. 
SMITH Are you mad? Don't do that! 
Lisa takes a fire extinguisher off the wall. 
SMITH No, stop, you'll -- 
LISA Smith, it's for the best. 
SMITH No, you muppet! If he lights that in here you'll-- 
O'Shea drops the lighter and BOOM!    It flashes up in flames. 
WHOOSH! The sprinklers blast to life and water rains down on them, the lab and the dormant amphibious bloodsucking alien. 
SMITH -- get it wet. 
O'SHEA Shit. 
SMITH You really are Irish. 
Lisa drops the fire extinguisher. 
LISA Shut it off! 
PADDY See ya later, lads. 
Paddy scampers out as O'Shea, Lisa and Smith scramble for the mains under the sink. Six hands fighting to shut it off. Once they do, every surface drips. A fish-tank overflows. 
They rise slowly from the slick floor. It's eerily quiet. Smith picks up a stool. Lisa grabs a scalpel. O'Shea rolls up a magazine. They creep forward. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       51. 
SMITH Careful. Once it's wet I don't know what it can do. 
O'Shea edges closer.    It's unscathed from the fire. 
O'SHEA It didn't burn. 
LISA Is it dead? 
O'SHEA I -- 
BOOM! It launches to life, sprays O'Shea with goo and dives onto him, wrapping around his face, head and neck. 
Lisa and Smith leap to his aid and battle what looks like a dozen boa constrictors working as one, choking him. 
O'Shea flails and smashes into lab units, knocking a utility closet open. Brooms and mops fall out as O'Shea slumps onto the wet floor. 
Lisa and Smith pull tentacles loose and O'Shea gasps for air. His drained, ashen skin pocked with bleeding bite wounds. 
Smith flings the limp Grabber across the lab and it hits the wet floor, flopping woozily and vomiting blood. 
It bears down on its tentacles and springs itself onto the ceiling like an octopus shot out of an air cannon. SPLAT! It hits the fluorescent light and hangs from it, upside down. 
Smith blinks, agog.

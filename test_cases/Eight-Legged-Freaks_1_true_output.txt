BRET So the female's around here? 
Bret looks around nervously. 
The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull. He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid drained away. 
Mike hides his eyes.     Ashley comforts him. 
SAM That one just moved! 
Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete.       The web comes away to reveal a human hand. 
CHRIS There's somebody in here! 
Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help. They finally reveal Gladys. 
CHRIS Gladys! 
The woman's body begins to spasm. 
CHRIS Gladys, please... (to the others) Can anybody help her?! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward. 
ASHLEY Her breathing is shallow.       She's going into arrest. 
Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV. Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air. 
CHRIS It's okay.    It's okay. 
Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris. From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo. 
GLADYS Am I... dead? 
CHRIS You're okay. 
GLADYS I'm not in heaven? 
CHRIS No... 
GLADYS Then what's with all the gold? 
Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the cavern walls. 
WADE Gold! Gold!     Look!    It's everywhere! 
SAM Is it real? 
Chris checks it out. 
CHRIS Jesus... it's the mother lode... He was right. My dad was right... 
Chris helps Gladys to her feet.         They share an emotional look of recognition. 
GLADYS So were you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Wade chips away at the gold. 
WADE Get as much as you can! 
Bret looks at Ashley. 
BRET Nice work, Doc. 
Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade.           Sam puts her hand on Ashley's shoulder. 
SAM You saved my life. 
Ashley smiles. 
Gladys leans over to Norman.

GOEBBELS ENTERS LAUGHING. 
GOEBBELS Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts. 
LSD What did you tell the people? 
GOEBBELS I told them we invaded England. 
LSD Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out? 
GOEBBELS We won. 
LSD Groovy! 
THEY SMACK HANDS. 
LAUGH FROM AUDIENCE. 
CUT TO BACKSTAGE.  LIEBKIND COMES CHARGING IN LIKE A LUNATIC. 
LIEBKIND Bring down the curtain!  Bring down the curtain! 
HE RUSHES FOR THE CURTAIN ROPE.  A STAGEHAND ATTEMPTS TO STOP HIM.  HE RIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND BANGS HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH IT.  AS HE SLUMPS TO THE GROUND, LIEBKIND UNDOES THE CURTAIN ROPE. 
CUT TO ACTORS ON STAGE. 
LSD Goebbels, you're the only one... 
THE CURTAIN DROPS WITH A THUD.  FROM BENEATH IT CRAWLS LIEBKIND.  HE JUMPS UP AND ADDRESSES THE AUDIENCE. 
LIEBKIND I am the author of this play.  You are the victims of a hoax.  These are not my words.  The Fuhrer never said baby.  The Fuhrer was sweet, the Fuhrer was kind, the Fuhrer was good. 
STAGE MANAGER (off camera) Get that curtain up. 
CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE.  LIEBKIND HURLS HIMSELF IT, AND HOLDS IT DOWN. 
LIEBKIND NO!  No!  The curtain must not go up! 
DESPITE HIS EFFORTS, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES.  LIEBKIND DOES NOT RELEASE HIS HOLD ON IT.  HE STARTS TO GO UP. 
LIEBKIND Stop!  Stop! 
AS THE CURTAIN RISES, WE SEE A BEWILDERED GROUP OF ACTORS AND STAGE HANDS WATCHING LIEBKIND'S ASCENT.  THE AUDIENCE, THINKING LIEBKIND'S BEHAVIOR PART OF THE SHOW, ENJOYS THE PROCEEDINGS TREMENDOUSLY.  THEY BREAK INTO APPLAUSE. 
CUT TO CRITIC.  HE IS LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY AND TEARING UP HIS NOTES. 
CUT BACK TO LIEBKIND. 
LIEBKIND We have been betrayed!  I will return!  I will returnnnnn... 
LIEBKIND DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLIES. 
DISSOLVE TO ANTEROOM OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM'S OFFICE.  DAY. ULLA, WEARING A BELTED RAINCOAT, SITS AT THE TYPEWRITER. MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER SOFTLY ROCKS IN THE BACKGROUND. IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HOLDS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, FROM WHICH SHE SIPS, WHILE HER RIGHT HAND, INDEX FINGER EXTENDED, STABS AT THE FUNNY LITTLE KEYS.  SHE IS HAPPY, IT IS THE RIGHT ONE. THE DOOR FLIES OPEN.  THE DESPERATE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER.  ULLA LEAPS UP, QUICKLY UNDOES HER RAINCOAT, EXPOSING HER DELICIOUS BODY, CLOTHED ONLY IN BLACK LACE UNDERTHINGS. 
ULLA We make love? 
BIALYSTOCK No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work. 
ULLA IMMEDIATELY TURNS UP RECORD PLAYER TO A CRASHING BLARE AND DOES HER GROOVY DANCE.  BIALYSTOCK HOWLS IN DESPAIR AND FLEES INTO HIS OFFICE TOGETHER WITH BLOOM. 
HE CLOSES THE DOOR, SHUTTING OUT THE NOISE.  THE OFFICE IS FILLED WITH FLOWERS AND CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAMS.  BIALYSTOCK SWOOPS DOWN ON THE TELEGRAMS.  HE RIPS ONE OPEN AND BEGINS READING.

SAM And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! (he laughs) 
MARY It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here... 
SAM (interrupting, seriously) You can't laugh at it, huh? 
MARY Can you? 
SAM Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but... 
He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it. 
It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor again. 
SAM And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal. 
MARY (having to smile) You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime. 
SAM I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal. (goes close to mary, touches her) Next best thing to no conscience at all. 
MARY (pulling away) I have to go, Sam. 
SAM I can come down next week. 
MARY No. 
SAM Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public? 
MARY We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three! 
SAM And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall? 
MARY Sam! No! 
SAM (after a pause, simply) All right. 
She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and simple sincerity. 
SAM Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions. (a smile) Even respectability. 
MARY You make respectability sound... disrespectful. 
SAM (brightly) I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work. (a pause) But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind. 
He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment. 
SAM I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere. 
MARY (a smile) I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms. 
SAM A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then... 
MARY I haven't even been married once yet! 
SAM Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing. 
MARY (smiling, then with a terrible urgency) Sam, let's go get married. 
SAM And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps. 
MARY (a deep desperation) I'll lick the stamps. 
He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, looks out the window and stares at the wide sky. 
SAM You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like. (he moves away, suddenly serious) Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available. 
MARY I'm thinking of it. 
SAM (a cheerful shout) How can you even think a thing like that! 
MARY (picking up handbag, starting for door) Don't miss your plane. 
SAM Hey, we can leave together can't we? 
MARY (at door) I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.

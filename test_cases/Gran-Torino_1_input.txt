PAGE 102 Father Janovich grabs four beers, two for each of them. He opens a Pabst and takes a big swig. 
FATHER JANOVICH Damn all this. It just isn't fair. 
WALT Nothing's fair, Father. Father Janovich and Walt sit for awhile. 
FATHER JANOVICH So, what are you going to do, Mr. Kowalski? 
WALT Call me Walt. Father Janovich nods. 
FATHER JANOVICH Alright, what are you going to do, Walt? 
WALT Not sure yet. All I do know is they don't have a goddamned chance. 
INT. WALT'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
Walt sits at the kitchen table in his robe, drinking coffee. Tao comes in without even knocking on the door. 
TAO What are you doing? 
WALT I'm thinking. 
TAO Thinking time is over. Now it's time to knock the ass out of those pricks. 
WALT I know you don't want to hear this, but you have to calm down. 
TAO What?!

WALT You have to have a clear head, otherwise mistakes get made. Back away from what's happened, Tao. 
TAO No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not you. This is going to end, today. Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in. 
WALT Sit down. 
TAO I don't want to sit. 
WALT I SAID SIT DOWN! Just listen up for a second and don't say anything. Tao sits down. Walt rubs his hands together. 
WALT I know what needs to be done. I need to prepare, this needs to be carefully planned. You know I'm the right man for this. So cool down for a little while and meet me back here at 4 P.M. I promise you, what needs to be done, will be done. 
TAO I say we go now. Right now. 
WALT And do what? You want to go kill your cousin and those other Zips. Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is out for blood. What do you even know about it? Tao is furious, but says nothing. 
WALT Trust me, Tao. Cool down and we'll meet back here at four. Okay? Tao doesn't answer.

WALT I said okay?' You won't do anything without me. You meet me back here at four? Say okay.' 
TAO Okay. Tao storms out the back door. Walt pours more coffee. 
INT. BATHROOM 
Walt soaks in the tub. It's filled with bubbles. Walt looks over at Daisy who rests on a towel in the corner. Walt lights a CIGARETTE and exhales. Daisy curls up her lips at the smoke. 
WALT I know, I know. Give me a break, it's the first time I've ever smoked in the house. 
EXT. WALT'S YARD - DAY 
Walt meticulously mows his lawn. He carefully trims around the fence and birdbath. 
INT. OLD SCHOOL BARBERSHOP 
Martin finishes cutting Walt's hair. 
BARBER There, all done. Ten bucks American. 
WALT I don't suppose you still have steady enough hands to give a guy a straight shave, you withered, old Italian mummy? 
BARBER You? A straight shave? You've never ordered a straight shave, ever.

PINDELLA I'm a psychiatrist. 
SHARON And Mr. Lambert... 
PINDELLA My relationship with Mr. Lambert is confidential. 
She's dying inside -- but covering, lying, forcing her way into this. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHARON He's your patient. He's your patient we... know all this. This is police business. I'm officer Sharon Pogue -- L.A.P.D. 
PINDELLA Look... I want to help Mr. Lambert but I can't tell you anything that isn't public record. 
SHARON In general. In general.   He's your patient, and he... 
PINDELLA He's not my patient. He walked away from treatment. That was... nearly a year ago. 
SHARON Why did he walk away? 
PINDELLA I can't discuss that, but if you know how to reach him, I would appreciate being able to talk to him. 
SHARON (desperate) You can help by just   telling me what's in the public   record. It'll take me half a   day to do a search. Can you tell    me? Just... 
She is unable to play this out as a "cop," her emotions coming through. Pindella sees this. She sits on the edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly. 
SHARON Can you please tell me what's in the record? 
He stares a moment, sympathetic -- and realizing... 
PINDELLA You were with him -- in the car. Your uniform threw me. Are you his friend? 
She looks at him, nods. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHARON More. 
He takes that in, leans back on the desk. 
PINDELLA I can tell you he was in an accident, hospitalized, referred to me as an outpatient... 
SHARON What accident? 
PINDELLA A bus... a city bus hit his vehicle. That was a couple of years ago. It was... an awful thing. His family was in the van. His wife and child. His wife's parents... 
SHARON A bus... and a van. Where?        On... the freeway? 
Something is pulling at her memory. Her vision turns inward, and she stops breathing for a moment -- remembering. She was there. And here we get a... 
FLASHBACK - CARNAGE 
A glimpse of the carnage -- what she saw, first on the scene -- with Catch lying there. All the while Pindella is speaking. 
PINDELLA (V.O.) I think so. Yes. Near Santa Monica.  On the freeway. He was severely injured but... thrown clear.  The others were trapped in the van. 
BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT) 
still in shock, looks at Pindella again. 
SHARON Survivors?   Only him?      I... don't remember. 
PINDELLA Remember? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHARON (quietly) Yes.   I was there. I was there. 
Pindella stares, then... 
PINDELLA His wife's mother survived, but... she was paralyzed. 
She takes a moment, absorbing this. 
PINDELLA Elanora Chu.   She's still in town, I believe. 
SHARON Does he... still see her? 
PINDELLA He used to. I don't know. (pause) I'm glad to see... he has someone else who cares about him. I know he's running from this. He left all his friends, his home, his whole life. 
SHARON He says... he doesn't remember the accident. 
PINDELLA He lost a lot of memory. I tried to help him with that. He resisted. Walked away. 
She stares. 
SHARON I think he remembers me. 
Very subdued now, she asks... 
SHARON How does he live? 
PINDELLA He received a large settlement from the city, but he...barely touches it. He was a professional musician.

There is a free-standing porcelain tub in the center of the room. Mariachi places his guitar halfway between the entrance and the tub. The camera is tracking backwards with him as he walks, making th room look endless. He removes his jacket as he makes his way to the tub. He drops his jacket onto the floor and gently climbs into the tub. The camera faces him as he settles back. The camera slowly dollies into him as he lays back, crosses his fingers, and gives a relaxed smile. 
INT. AMADEUS - DAY 
Domino is washing a glass. She the then remembers she has the gun in her waist belt, so she removes it and sticks it back under the counter. Wounded Mean Dude #5 comes in limping. She takes out a towel and drops it on the counter. 
MEAN DUDE #5 Good morning, Domino. 
DOMINO What happened? 
MEAN DUDE #5 Give me the phone. I have to call Moco. 
She brings up the phone and sets it down where the cloth was. He picks up the cloth and wraps his arm with it. 
MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D) It's not as bad as it looks. Domino, has anyone come through here? A stranger, maybe? 
DOMINO This is a border town. I get strangers all the time. 
MEAN DUDE #5 Dressed all in black, carrying a guitar case? 
DOMINO No. 
MEAN DUDE #5 Well, he shot me... and has killed ten of Moco's men... all in one day. 
Domino looks a little upset. She slides the phone towards him a bit. 
DOMINO Aren't you gonna call your boss? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MEAN DUDE #5 (nodding) I have to tell Moco that he got away again... So, you better give me a drink first. 
Domino smiles and pours him half a beer mug with tequila. He laughs and drinks. As he's dialing, the camera is on Domino as she cleans up a few things, every once in a while glancing upstairs. 
MEAN DUDE #5 (CONT'D) (into phone) Moco, he got away. Shot me in the arm. Killed La Palma. Pepino, Sunday. This guy is one slick maricon. Yeah. Also, I didn't get a look at him. So, unless he's still carrying that guitar around and hasn't changed clothes, I won't even spot him, and I don't think he'll be that obvious... 
MOCO (V.O.) Don't worry. If there's one thing I know, it's that he'll always wear black and he'll always carry that guitar with him. It's his signature. Besides, that's not a guitar he's carrying. It's a guitar case full of weapons. Find him.

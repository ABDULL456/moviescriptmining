The crowd, Fiona, Puss and Donkey look on, shocked. 
CUT TO: Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 7. 
EXT. BOAT DOCKS - DAY 
Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal Navy. 
Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks. 
Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their heads as they leave. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of them. 
DONKEY Well, since you're filling in for one, you might as well look like a real King. Can somebody come in here and work on Shrek please? 
Raul stares at Shrek. Shrek raises his eyebrow. 
RAUL (AHEM) I will see what I can do. 
He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools. 
Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair. 
A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes. 
We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash. 
Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked. 
FIONA Ow! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 8. 
Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to reveal that the lips are Shrek's. 
A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and tighten up the zipper all the way. 
A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn, Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP! 
A collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is tightened. 
A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's belt. A mole is placed on his cheek. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER 
REVEAL: Shrek and Fiona standing awkwardly in outrageous Renaissance outfits. 
Donkey gasps. 
DONKEY Oh! 
Puss rolls his eyes. 
PUSS Yeah, wow. 
Fiona is uncomfortable. 
FIONA Uh, is this really necessary? 
RAUL (TO SHREK) Ho, ho. Quite necessary, Fiona. 
SHREK I'm Shrek, you twit. 
RAUL Whatever. 
PUSS Okay peoples! This isn't a rehearsal. Let's see some hustle. 
DONKEY Smiles everyone, smiles! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 9. 
Off-screen, the Master of Ceremonies announces the couples arriving at the party. 
Fiona turns to Shrek and sees he is not in a good mood. 
SHREK I don't know how much longer I can keep this up Fiona. 
FIONA I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please just try to grin and bear it? It's just until Dad gets better. 
Shrek lets out another frustrated sigh. 
FIONA Shrek? 
SHREK Yeah. 
FIONA You look handsome. 
SHREK Ah. Come here, you. 
She gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles back.

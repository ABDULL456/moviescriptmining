Paul and Jacob are beyond hearing. 
PAUL All you care about is her -- SAM (commanding) Paul, back off. 
PAUL -- and she doesn't give a crap about you -- 
Jacob flashes anger, PUSHES Paul, hard.   Paul FLIES backward. 
SAM Jacob. 
Paul rises, outraged, throws his head back in a growl, vibrating violently -- 
JARED Too late. 
SAM Bella, get back! Paul FALLS FORWARD but halfway to the ground there's a loud RIPPING noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring! 
Bella, horrified, grabs Jacob's arm, pulling him -- 
BELLA Run, Jacob! -- 
But he yanks away from her, runs directly at the Paul-wolf -- 
BELLA Jake, no!   Stop -- ! 
Jacob DIVES headfirst into the air - with another sharp TEARING sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur BURSTS from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf. 
Bella reels as the two wolves CRASH into each other, snarling and RAMMING one another. The sound is DEAFENING. Their teeth flash at each other's throats. 
Bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves beyond the clearing and into the woods -- 
CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM, as they fight deeper and deeper into the darkness... until they disappear. The horrible SOUNDS of the fight still ECHO -- BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Sam starts after them, kicking off his shoes. 
SAM Take Bella to Emily's place. 
Sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet.    A long silence... 
EMBRY Guess the wolf's out of the bag. 
Off Bella, stunned. 
EXT. LA PUSH - EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Bella's truck, driven by Embry, pulls up to a tiny, weathered house with a window box full of marigolds. Jared, in the back, jumps out, opens Bella's door. He and Embry head toward the house. She doesn't move. 
EMBRY (to Jared) Pay up. She didn't puke. 
Jared, annoyed, hands Embry five bucks. 
EMBRY Told you she was tough.     She does run with bloodsuckers. 
BELLA Wait. We should go back, make sure Jacob's okay. 
JARED I hope Paul gets some teeth in him. Serve him right. 
EMBRY No way. Jake's a natural. You see him phase on the fly? I gotta fiver says Paul doesn't touch him. 
JARED Easy money.    Paul's been at it longer. 
Bella looks at them, appalled.      They realize she's not following them. 
EMBRY Come on in.    We won't bite. 
JARED Speak for yourself. Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them.     Embry pauses at the door -- 
EMBRY Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance - just try not to stare. It bugs Sam. 
BELLA Why would I stare? -- 
-- But the guys are already entering -- 
INT. EMILY'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 
Bella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry. She sees EMILY, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin. SEE only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long black hair. 
EMILY You guys hungry? Like I have to ask... Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines that pull down her eye and twist her mouth. 
EMILY Who's this? 
As Jared and Embry beeline for the muffins -- 
JARED Bella Swan.    Who else? 
EMILY So you're the vampire girl. 
BELLA And you're a... you're all... 
EMILY Werewolves? I'm just engaged to one. But these animals -- (slaps Embry's hand) Save some for your brothers.

Anne continues to keep her lips sealed. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Please, darling. A bit more. 
Anne doesn't move. He puts the muesli on the night stand and holds the sipping cup to her lips. She drinks slowly, one sip after the other. He pulls the cup back between each sip, to give her more time. Suddenly she says: 
ANNE ...Mom to the concert... 
GEORGES Yes? 
ANNE ...Mom to the concert... no dress... 
GEORGES Mom has no dress for the concert? 
ANNE ...Mom to concert... no ... uuu... no... 
GEORGES Yes? 
Long PAUSE. Georges waits. 
SCENE 42 - INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Georges and the nurse install Anne on a metal armchair in the shower. 
As she does so, the nurse keeps talking reassuringly to Anne. Finally, she turns on the tap. 
ANNE (in a monotone) Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!... 
Without being phased, the nurse continues to speak reassuringly. Georges remains standing there, helpless. 
SCENE 43 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY 
Kitchen. 
Georges and the nurse are seated at the table with a cup of coffee. In front of the nurse, on the table, is a sum of money. As they speak, we hear, coming from the room, Anne's CALLS FOR HELP. 
NURSE ... we could take turns. She'd come from 8 till 12 and I'd do 2 until 6, or 3 to 7. That would certainly relieve the pressure on you. 
GEORGES I'll think about it. 
NURSE She just has to know in time so she can arrange it in her schedule. 
GEORGES Yes, of course, I'll let you know in the next few days. 
NURSE Very well. I have to go now...

HARKEN It's me. 
Everyone's head snaps back to Harken. 
NICK What? 
(CONTINUED) 28 CONTINUED: (2) 28 
HARKEN I've decided to absorb the responsibilities of the Senior VP position into my own. I realized if you want something done right, you do it yourself. So, I'm going to be knocking down the wall between my office and what would've been the Senior VP's to create a single, enormous office. However, as a cost-cutting measure, I will only be taking 85% of the additional salary I'm entitled to. It's called self- sacrifice, people. Learn from this. 
Harken heads out. 
29 INT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 29 
Nick hurries to catch up with Harken. 
NICK Mr. Harken, can I speak to you? 
HARKEN What is it? 
NICK You've been hinting for months that I was in line for that promotion. 
HARKEN And look how hard you've worked. 
NICK So you've just been lying to me? 
HARKEN Not lying. Motivating. We're all on the same team here, Nick. We're all trying to find Lorenzo's oil before it's too late for little Lorenzo. Besides, I'm the one who's taking on a lot more work. 
(CONTINUED) 29 CONTINUED: 29 
NICK (barely keeping it TOGETHER) Last month you kept me working so late I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam! 
HARKEN What? 
NICK My grandmother. I told you I needed to see her but you said I'd be fired if I left early. She died before I could get to the hospital. (VOICE QUIVERING) She taught me how to swim -- 
HARKEN Oh, my God. I had no idea... that you called your grandmother Gam Gam. (CHUCKLING) I don't mean to laugh, but that's adorable. (off Nick's outraged LOOK) Look, Nick, I'm sorry you didn't get to say bye-bye to Gam Gam. I make you work late because you're an invaluable part of this operation. And I need you in your current position. 
NICK I've been in that position for eight years now. Why would I stay here after being treated like this?! 
HARKEN Because I will see to it that no one else in our industry will hire you. 
NICK What? 
HARKEN Anyone who interviews you will want my letter of recommendation. And I'm prepared to tell them that you are a dishonest, insubordinate drunk. (CONTINUED) 29 CONTINUED: (2) 29 
NICK But that's not true! You can't do this! 
Harken gets directly in Nick's face, speaking softly but intensely. 
HARKEN Let me make this clear, you weak, little fuck. I own you. You're my bitch. Don't make the mistake of thinking you have free will. Because I can crush you any time I like. (stepping back, FRIENDLY AGAIN) Settle in, friend. You're here for the long haul. 
Harken slaps him hard on the back and continues on his way, leaving a stunned Nick. 
30 INT. PELLIT CHEMICAL CO. - DAY 30 
Kurt somberly heads to his desk. He's wearing a dark suit. 
PELLIT (O.S.) Yo, dickwall! What the fuck? 
Kurt sees Bobby Pellit standing in the doorway of what was Jack's office. 
KURT What? 
PELLIT You're three hours late. What's the deal? 
KURT I was at your father's funeral. 
PELLIT Maybe that excuse would've flown when my dad was here, but I'm in charge now. 
KURT That excuse wouldn't have made any sense when your dad was here. 
PELLIT In my office. Now. 
31 INT. PELLIT'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 31 
Kurt enters. He notices that the "Jack Pellit" nameplate has been partially taped over with the name "Bobby" scribbled in magic marker. 
PELLIT Sit. 
Kurt sits. Bobby quickly slips a small mirror and rolled up dollar bill into a drawer. Kurt sees Bobby has tossed most of Jack's mementos, achievement awards and photos with luminaries in the trash. 
PELLIT I've been looking over the books. You're the accountant. Tell me why this company is in the crapper. 
KURT It's not in the crapper. It's a recession. But we're still profitable.

RIEDENSCHNEIDER And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money... 
He is looking at Doris. 
RIEDENSCHNEIDER ...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch! 
ED So... who... who actually-- 
RIEDENSCHNEIDER Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try. 
He chuckles as he heads for the door. 
RIEDENSCHNEIDER ...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees daylight. We got a real shot at this, folks. Let's not get cocky. 
The door shuts behind him. 
Doris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene. 
A silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her mouth. 
ED Honey...? 
The smile twitches, and then stays. Doris starts to laugh. Ed frowns. 
ED ...Honey? 
Her laughter builds, almost to hysteria. Finally it subsides and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes her head: 
DORIS What a dope. 
ABUNDAS LIVING ROOM 
Ed sits listening as Birdy plays. She talks, after a moment, her eyes on the sheet music: 
BIRDY He was deaf when he wrote this. 
ED Who? 
BIRDY Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow. 
Over her continued playing: 
ED (V.O.) So maybe Riedenschneider could get Doris off. Maybe it would all work out. And I thought--I hoped--that maybe there was a way out for me as well... 
A SIGN 
The cardboard sign on an easel says "COME ONE, COME ALL / PETALUMA HIGH SCHOOL TALENT SHOW / WEDNESDAY APRIL 29, 1949, 8:00 P.M. 
ED (V.O.) The girl had talent, anyone could see that. And *she* wasn't some fly- by-nighter, she was just a good clean kid... 
SCHOOL GYMNASIUM 
A young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift stage to a smattering of applause. Birdy walks out to the baby grand that has been set out center stage. 
ED (V.O.) ...If she was going to have a career she'd need a responsible adult looking out for her... 
We track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents, many of whom fan themselves with programs. We come to rest on Ed. 
ED (V.O.) ...some kind of... manager. She'd have contracts to look at, be going on tours, playing on the radio maybe. I could help her sort through all of that, without charging her an arm and a leg, just enough to get by... 
Birdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience. 
EXT. SCHOOL 
Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm summer night. He looks around the parking lot. 
ED (V.O.) ...I could afford to charge less than the usual manager, not having to put up a big front like a lot of these phonies. And I could be with her, enough to keep myself feeling OK... 
A trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car, laughing, passing a cigarette back and forth with another student--a boy. 
ED (V.O.) ...Why couldn't that work?... Why not?... 
Birdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy's drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults.

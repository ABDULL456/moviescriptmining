{"test1_input": "ROXANNE I keep trying to tell people it wasn't really like that. Uberman and I - We were kinda having problems. We broke up. \nThe waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice. \nFRIEND #1 You broke up with Uberman! \nFRIEND #3 You must have REALLY, REALLY high standards. I mean, you were dating a god. I mean, what's it take? \nROXANNE Maybe someone who's a little more aware of his faults. Someone a little more sensitive. \nFRIEND #3 Right. Someone who listens, sexy but attainable with cute little cheeks like a hamster and heartbreak in his eyes. \nShe turns to Friend one and two to explain. \nFRIEND #3 She wants John Cusack. \nFRIEND #2 The actor? \nFRIEND #3 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes, the actor. Ever since we were teenagers, Roxanne's totally had the hots for him. \nROXANNE Well, until he miraculously comes walking into my life, I'm just going to take a little reflection time for myself. \nThe waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away. \nEXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY \nThe waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS WRIST. \nHis image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: MASTER MIND! \nMASTER MIND Who the hell is John Cusack? \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nA YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building construction site. \nACROSS THE STREET \nA local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the sidewalk, including Roxanne. \nPOLITICIAN The Fifth Avenue Renovation Project, which I championed, will breath new life into the downtown area. New life means new jobs and new revenue. \nROXANNE Councilman, is it true that your brother-in-law's construction company won the contract for this project? \nPOLITICIAN Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not here to answer a lot of crazy questions... \nYOUNG MOTHER \nThe young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby. \nAbove her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to an upper floor. \nHal comes around the corner and heads in her direction. \nCRANE \nThe crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to fix the problem. \nHal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie his shoe. \nCRANE \nThe operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL. \nHAL AND THE WOMAN \nThe woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing her and her baby. She screams. \nHal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the way and crashes into the woman and stroller. \nACROSS THE STREET \nThe reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND. \nHAL AND MOTHER \nTears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and kisses it. \nHal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him. \nYOUNG MOTHER Thank you! Thank you for saving me and my baby! \nShe hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy. \nHAL (not knowing what she's talking about) Huh? \nHe's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display of affection and the small child in-between their embrace. \nHAL (CONT'D) There, there. \n", "test1_true": "HAL (CONT'D) Okay, we better...well, I hear these little guys smother easy. \nThe reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother. \nROXANNE What's it feel like to be a hero? \nHal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he's captivated by her beauty. \nHAL Well...I'm just a man doing what men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi, aren't you? \nThey're suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his way in between them. \nREPORTER Were you scared? \nHAL Scared? Who had time? \nThe reporters eat this up. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT \nTELEVISION \nJohn Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and \"In Your Eyes\" by Peter Gabriel begins to play. \nFrom the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch. \nMASTER MIND John Cusack, huh? So all I have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS. \nHe turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear from his cheek. \nMASTER MIND Please, get a hold of yourself. \nINT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT \nRoxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER. \nROXANNE Shit. \nShe goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it up for her. \nLooking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned speechless - It's popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Oh the humanity - it was a Venti. \nROXANNE (stunned) You're...you're. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the actor. \nHe notices the book she's reading. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think remember something from that one - Let's see: \"My head is screaming `I want you and need you' - my heart it keeps reaching to see you and feel you - yet in the end, I'm alone once again.\" Wow, I scare even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just really into poetry. Probably because I'm so sensitive and always going to great lengths to express myself. But enough about me. Can I fill you up? \nROXANNE (captivated) ...Yes. (catching herself) I mean, excuse me? \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Can I fill you up? Your coffee. \nROXANNE Right. \nINT. BOOKSTORE CAFE' - LATER \nRoxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word intently. \nROXANNE I did have a boyfriend - until fairly recently. \nShe suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers- by being to notice who she's with. \nROXANNE I'm sorry - this is so surreal! \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Yeah, they charge way too much at these places - Now back to your boyfriend. I'm interested and compassionate. I want to know about you. \nROXANNE Things were complicated. He was a man married to his work. There was...there was a lot of competition in his line of business. I'm sure you know what that's like. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Sure. In my business, one thing I have is RIVALS. For example, mine is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno. \nROXANNE ...The body-builder who used to play The Hulk on TV? \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Did he? Well, we're always up for the same roles. Did your boyfriend have someone like that? A particular rival that was always getting his goat - so to speak? \nROXANNE Well...one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than I ever did. But enough about my problems. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" NO, TELL ME MORE!!! \nSuddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask it. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough. Had it ever since Serendipity. I WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!! (fakes cough) See, there it goes again. Please, go on. \nROXANNE Right, well, he seemed to need him more than he needed me. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" How do you mean? \n", "test1_id": 1797, "test2_input": "ROXANNE It was conflict he thrived on. He always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if Master - I mean, this guy were gone. It was like he needed it, like oxygen. \nThe answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" (almost to himself) I think I finally understand...The only logical answer is to recreate that rivalry - or if that's impossible, create one of equal structure. That's it! \nROXANNE What? \nJohn Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's heard every word. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing for a part...where I play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate times. \nIn a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" I have to go right now, but I'd really like to see you again - if that's alright. \nRoxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the craziness of the situation. \nROXANNE I'd love that. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY \nMaster storms in the office to find Plato and Einstein playing darts with the original Mona Lisa. \nEINSTEIN Got her nose! \nMASTER MIND I've got it! \nEveryone stops what they're doing upon seeing that their master has returned. \nMASTER MIND I've got it! \nMASTER MIND It's plain and simple. Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: I must create a new superhero. \nEINSTEIN Yeah, maybe that's not such hot idea... \nMASTER MIND (ignoring him) Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis! \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY \nThe lab is slick, white and ultra modern. \nDressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly. \nMASTER MIND Prepare the subject. \nHe glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a huge vat dangles precariously. \nMaster Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and Einstein. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Plato, pour the toxic waste. \nPlato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of gallons of green and brown goo into the hole. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Drainage. \nThe slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo- soaked Severs. \nMaster Mind looks into the pit. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Well, Severs? \nSEVERS I feel fine. Just a little sticky, but aside from that everything's completely - \nBOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves an inch. Finally... \nMASTER MIND Okay then. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - LABORATORY - DAY \nThrough a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally. \nMASTER MIND And this one? \nPLATO We attached gills to him. He can breath under water. \nMASTER MIND Ah. Does he have extraordinary strength? \nPLATO Well...no. \nMASTER MIND Can he fly? \nPLATO No. \nMASTER MIND Resilient to weapons fire? \nPLATO No. \nMASTER MIND He just breathes under water, then. \n", "test2_true": "Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY \nThe next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass tube not much wider than himself. \nMASTER MIND Plato, the radioactive spider, please. \nPlato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto Stenwick's arm. \nStenwick looks and winces as it bites him. \nSTENWICK Ow! \nHe brushes the spider off. \nMASTER MIND Anything, Stenwick? \nSTENWICK (shaken) No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this was about spiders. I have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia. \nMaster Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato. \nMASTER MIND We're gonna need more venom. \nPlato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he's engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) How `bout now, Stenwick? ....Stenwick? \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY \nMaster Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in the background. \nMASTER MIND This has proven to be a challenge. I just don't know what I want. What do I want? \nHe stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no advice. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) I want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong. Someone who doesn't seek power - instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion. \nEinstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's attention. \nEINSTEIN Yeah, well, it sounds like what you want is Uberman. \nMaster Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand. \nMASTER MIND That's it! Why make a copy when the real thing will do? \nThe lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what they're hearing. \nEINSTEIN I was just kidding, sir. In case you forgot, you actually burned Uberman alive. \nMASTER MIND Then we'll make a new one. Plato, bring me the box! \nMINUTES LATER \nMaster Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small table. \nPlato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center. \nAs Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE GLOW emanating from inside. \nMASTER MIND Behold - Uberessence. The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers. \nEINSTEIN Where the hell did you get that? \nMASTER MIND Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never got around to following up with that. \nPLATO I believe he defeated you before you could, master. \nMASTER MIND ...Right. Man, he was good! \nDA VINCI You want another volunteer, sir? \nMASTER MIND Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure. \nMaster Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with white lettering that reads: \"Hal Stewart - Metro City's Newest Hero?\" \nNEWS REPORTER ...who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and her child. \nHAL Please, please, you're embarrassing me. I saw someone in need and I helped them. What more can we ask of ourselves. I ask you, what more? \nA smile creeps across the evil one's face. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Somebody like him! \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nPlato is sitting in the van, staring into a pair of binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone. \nPLATO Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece of work. He used to teach bowling at Kingpin's. \n", "test2_id": 1798, "test3_input": "TITAN Well, I'm going to make something that can't be taken away from me. I'm going to create a permanent monument to my greatness. One that won't be so easily forgotten or erased. \nThe camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING BALL from Kingpin's. \nTITAN I intend to create a new category in the Guinness Book of World's Records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling. \nHe grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS. We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN FORMATION. \nTITAN My thanks to the city planning commission. This wouldn't have been possible without them. \nTitan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again. \nTITAN Tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow. \nBACK TO SCENE \nROXANNE My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy the whole business triangle. \nMaster Mind seems to be contemplating something - something bad. \nROXANNE What? \nMASTER MIND My lair is in the direct path of the ball. \nROXANNE Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want anything to happen to your hideout, would we? \nMASTER MIND You don't understand. I have certain equipment that's - that's highly unstable. \nROXANNE What do you mean? \nMASTER MIND I sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay? \nROXANNE A HYDROGEN reactor? \nMASTER MIND It's experimental - only one in the world...Well, how do you think I power all my inventions? Someone like me can't pay for electricity. The bills would be outrageous. \nROXANNE A REACTOR? \nMASTER MIND It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one...If destroyed it could... \nROXANNE - Vaporize the entire city! \nMASTER MIND (proudly) Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard, actually. That little baby is amazing. I'm quite proud of it. (MORE) MASTER MIND(cont'd) (off her deadpan reaction) I mean...we'd better find a way to stop him. \nMaster Mind thinks a moment. \nMASTER MIND Did Uberman have a hideout? \nROXANNE What? \nMASTER MIND A cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. C'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. Roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance. \nROXANNE It's under his house. \nMASTER MIND Whose house? \nRoxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him. \nROXANNE Wayne Scott's. \nMaster Mind shoots up out of his chair. \nMASTER MIND Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist? But he disappeared - \nROXANNE (interrupting) He disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him. Not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous man. \nPerhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head. \nMaster Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds. \nRubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the door. \nROXANNE (CONT'D) Looks like you got what you always wanted. Uberman is out of the picture and Metro City is doomed. \nHe grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words. \nMASTER MIND \"Metro City doomed.\" You know, I never thought I'd say something like this, but here it goes - \nHe slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Not if I have anything to say about it. \nEXT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT \nMaster Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe. \nMASTER MIND Such a dark place for one such as you. I wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice? \nHe walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear them off with his metal hand. \n", "test3_true": "The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the manor. \nMaster Mind enters. \nCovered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic crypt. \nMASTER MIND Good lord, man. You've only been dead for two months. \nMaster Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his fallen foe. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) A disguise so simple, it's ingenious. No wonder I never caught on. \nBesides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he's even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists on his hips. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Two lives, yet in both you were an ideal. Perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end, old friend. \nA BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls. \nMaster Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a gigantic BOOKCASE. \nOn the twelfth bong it falls silent. \nMaster Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he hears a loud CLICK. \nThe bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN PASSAGE. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) I'll miss how predictable you were. \nThe passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR. \nMaster Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with stone walls. \nHe begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway. \nMaster Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the door. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Hello? Anyone here...besides..all the BIG MEN who are with me now? \nNothing. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) (to himself) What's the worst you're gonna find? (MORE) MASTER MIND(cont'd) The man was a boy scout, not a serial killer. \nHe opens the door to his immediate amazement. \nIt's some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR. \nMaster Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen. \nSCREEN \nA woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt sticking out. \nDOMINATRIX IN FILM YOU ARE A WORM! \nShe whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain. \nFAT MAN IN FILM PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!! \nMaster Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery. \nThe door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open. \nWAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP. \nMaster Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes. \nMASTER MIND Ahhhhhh! \nWayne Scott is just as startled. \nWAYNE SCOTT Jesus! \nHe drop his drink and snack to the floor. \nThe two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain their normal breathing patterns. \nWayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick layer of chip crumbs, and sits down. \nWAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D) What the hell are you doing here? \nMASTER MIND I might just ask you the same question. I had thought I incinerated you. \nWAYNE SCOTT You scared the bejesus out of me. How'd you figure out I was still alive? Wait, how do you know my identity!? \nMASTER MIND Roxanne told me. As for your ruse, I forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently. Figured if they could do it, so could you. But one thing I couldn't figure out - \nWAYNE SCOTT The skeleton? Something I \"borrowed\" from a medical school a few months before. \nMASTER MIND A few months? How long had you been planning this? \n", "test3_id": 1799}

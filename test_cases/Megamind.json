{"train": "MEGAMIND \nWritten by \nAlan Schoolcraft & Brent Simons \nCREDITS SEQUENCE \nNEWSPAPER HEADLINE MONTAGE: \nHEADLINES flash before us, displaying their accompanying photographs. \n\"UBERMAN - METRO CITY'S HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND! \nPHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of METRO CITY. \n\"UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MIND'S GIANT ROBOT!\" \nPHOTO: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings. \n\"MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST!\" \nPHOTO: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a METALLIC GAUNTLET. \nThe images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored glove. \nWe ZOOM IN to the last headline. \n\"MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!\" \nPHOTO: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his hips, obviously trying to accentuate the \"U\" insignia on his chest. \nEND OF CREDITS SEQUENCE \nEXT. BUILDING - DAY \nWe DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the exact same position. \nWE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city below. A perfect view for our guardian hero. \nHe watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as people happily go about their day. \nYet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's expression. \nUBERMAN You look so peaceful from up here. \nHis serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND coming from his wrist. \nHe looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm. It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter \"U\". \nUBERMAN (CONT'D) Looks like Roxanne's in trouble again. \nUberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off into the distance like a speeding bullet. \nEXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT \nGrime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and wonder - now home to a great evil. \nINT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY \nThe inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have an obvious function FLASH and HUM. \nA STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM- SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP. \nHe's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE WITH A GIANT GREEN \"M\" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES. \nMaster Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS. \nA man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI. The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board, is dressed as the philosopher PLATO. \nEINSTEIN I hate the outfits. I mean, I get it: we're all supposed to be \"masterminds\" - very clever. (MORE) EINSTEIN(cont'd) I just feel stupid. I mean, what the hell did Einstein really do anyway? \nPLATO Theory of relativity. \nEinstein starts feverishly scratching his side. \nEINSTEIN Well, you'd think he'd invent a wool sweater that didn't itch so much. \nDa Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein. \nEinstein notices his colleague's staring over his right shoulder and turns around. \nHe turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with his metal gauntlet. \nMASTER MIND The real Einstein once said, \"God does not play dice with the world.\" He was right, because the world is MY dice. Is that understood? \nDA VINCI & PLATO Sir! Yes, sir! \nEINSTEIN (gasping for air) Yes, sir. \nMASTER MIND (ON MONITOR) Actually, I wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend. \nA MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping Metro City's protector. \nTotally unfazed, our hero stares on. \nUBERMAN You can't possibly believe this will work. \nMaster Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED BUTTON on it. \nMASTER MIND (ON MONITOR) Oh, can't I? I have attained control of the Earth's most abundant energy source. I doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED POWER OF THE SUN!!! \nHe presses the button. \nEXT. OUTER SPACE \nA sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS. \nThe panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the burning star's power. \nThe front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power. \nINT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nFrom the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from the observatory. \nPLATO We're now at minimum safe distance, master. \nMaster Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and puts down the control box. \nMASTER MIND Excellent. Stop here, I like this view. \nPLATO Twenty seconds until impact. \nMaster Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored. \nDisappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage. \nMASTER MIND Any last words? \nUberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile. \nUBERMAN (ON MONITOR) Yes: there's no caging the power of justice. \nPLATO Ten seconds to impact. \nOn the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in his hands. He yanks...NOTHING. \nPLATO (CONT'D) Nine... \nMaster Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused. \nPLATO (CONT'D) Eight... \nUberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as leverage. \nMASTER MIND (genuinely concerned) What's going on? \nUBERMAN (straining) Hold...on...a second. \nMaster Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness. \nPLATO Seven... \nUberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS. \nUBERMAN SON OF A BITCH!! \nMaster Mind and the minions all cringe in unison. \nDa Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears. \nDA VINCI What did he just say? \nPLATO Six......Five... \nMaster Mind begins to laugh. \nMASTER MIND What kind of trick is this? \nUberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression. \nUBERMAN Like you don't know. These bars are made of copper, aren't they? \nPLATO Four... \nMASTER MIND Yeah, so? \nUberman tries to shield his grief with his hand. \nSPINNING HEADLINE: \"UBERMAN'S DEATH IGNITES CITY WIDE CRIME WAVE!\" \nARMORED TRUCK \nIt's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice something - THEY'RE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS. \nWe PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER. \nInside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh maniacally. \nSPINNING HEADLINE: \"CHAMPION-LESS CITY AT THE MERCY OF HOOLIGANS.\" \nMETRO CITY BANK \nDa Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding BAGS OF MONEY. \nTwo beat officers see them and take chase after them around the corner and into an alley. \nAfter a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after them. \nThe robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the driver's wheel. \nThey smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done. \nSPINNING HEADLINE: \"MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!\" \nA VICIOUS TORNADO \nIt's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the lackeys coolly look on. \nThree large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with bricks of CASH. \nThe DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in the three trucks. \nMaster Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward the tornado. \nMASTER MIND (absentmindedly) Oh, right. \nMaster Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and aims it at approaching windstorm of death. \nHe presses the button marked \"Tornado Off.\" \nThe tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the city. \nAs they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it melancholy? \nEND OF MONTAGE \nEXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY \nIt's Metro City's premier bowling alley. On top of the neon lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL. \nINT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY \nHAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING BALL. \nHAL It's a sport of honor, focus and grace. Honor the ball, focus on the pins, release the ball not hard and fast, but as if you were releasing a baby dove. \nHe takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball, following it with his eyes. \nIt's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL. \nAn aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth looks over at him. \nHAL Okay, do something like that - but center it more. \nShe picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim. \nATTRACTIVE BLOND Tell me how my form looks, honey. \nHal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson administration era derriere. \nHAL Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin' REAL good. \nIt doesn't get anymore clear. This man is a pig. \nVINNIE (O.S.) Hal, I want to see you in my office! \nHal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling him. \nVINNIE Now! \nINT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nHal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk. \nVINNIE You're fired. Leave your shirt and locker key. \nThis bit of news hits Hal like a freight train. \nFrank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the arm. \nFRANK Come on into my office, sweetie. \nINT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nHe sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns toward his door. \nFRANK Can we get this woman some water for God's sake? (to Rebecca) I gave you two months off. What're you doing back? People are gonna think I'm a slave driver. \nROXANNE Aren't you? \nFRANK Yeah, but I don't want people to think it. \nROXANNE Frank, listen. I want to go back to work. I NEED to go back to work. \nFRANK ...You're hysterical, aren't you? \nFrank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM EMBRACE. \nROXANNE What're you doing? \nFRANK Keeping you warm before you go into shock. (toward the open door) DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND HERE? \nA SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it on the table in front of them and leaves. \nRoxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to face him. \nROXANNE It was a traumatic experience. Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were...close. But what I really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work. \nThere's a sudden awkward silence from Frank. \nFRANK Well, that's going to be... \nROXANNE I thought you'd be happy to have me back. \nFRANK Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back, but... \nROXANNE Yes? \nFRANK Things have sorta...changed. \nROXANNE In three weeks? \nFRANK Listen, I'm not one who likes to open up wounds - especially ones that are just starting to scab, but you were sorta our go to girl for the exclusive on Uberman. And now that he's gone...I moved Brad into your anchor spot. \nROXANNE (disgusted) Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an idiot. \nFRANK It's the suits. They think it's time to switch things up. \nROXANNE Oh, because they can't use me to get the big story. \nFRANK C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the nature of what we do. They used you, you used Uberman. Everybody's happy. \nROXANNE (defensive) I didn't use him. \nFRANK Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you two were in love or something. My bad. \nROXANNE We were. \nFRANK And that's great. \nROXANNE Very in love. \nThere's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if she's failed to convince even herself of this. \nROXANNE Okay. So, where are they going to move me if Brad has my spot? \nFRANK ...Human interest. \nROXANNE Bake sales and pet stories. \nFRANK I told them I wouldn't be surprised if you just upped and quit. You busted your ass for that desk. \nRoxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her pride \nROXANNE I'll take it. \nFrank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing. \nFRANK What? \nEXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT \nAmongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century Gothic architecture. \nLIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT \nROXANNE I keep trying to tell people it wasn't really like that. Uberman and I - We were kinda having problems. We broke up. \nThe waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice. \nFRIEND #1 You broke up with Uberman! \nFRIEND #3 You must have REALLY, REALLY high standards. I mean, you were dating a god. I mean, what's it take? \nROXANNE Maybe someone who's a little more aware of his faults. Someone a little more sensitive. \nFRIEND #3 Right. Someone who listens, sexy but attainable with cute little cheeks like a hamster and heartbreak in his eyes. \nShe turns to Friend one and two to explain. \nFRIEND #3 She wants John Cusack. \nFRIEND #2 The actor? \nFRIEND #3 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes, the actor. Ever since we were teenagers, Roxanne's totally had the hots for him. \nROXANNE Well, until he miraculously comes walking into my life, I'm just going to take a little reflection time for myself. \nThe waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away. \nEXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY \nThe waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS WRIST. \nHis image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: MASTER MIND! \nMASTER MIND Who the hell is John Cusack? \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nA YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building construction site. \nACROSS THE STREET \nA local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the sidewalk, including Roxanne. \nPOLITICIAN The Fifth Avenue Renovation Project, which I championed, will breath new life into the downtown area. New life means new jobs and new revenue. \nROXANNE Councilman, is it true that your brother-in-law's construction company won the contract for this project? \nPOLITICIAN Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not here to answer a lot of crazy questions... \nYOUNG MOTHER \nThe young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby. \nAbove her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to an upper floor. \nHal comes around the corner and heads in her direction. \nCRANE \nThe crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to fix the problem. \nHal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie his shoe. \nCRANE \nThe operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL. \nHAL AND THE WOMAN \nThe woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing her and her baby. She screams. \nHal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the way and crashes into the woman and stroller. \nACROSS THE STREET \nThe reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND. \nHAL AND MOTHER \nTears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and kisses it. \nHal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him. \nYOUNG MOTHER Thank you! Thank you for saving me and my baby! \nShe hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy. \nHAL (not knowing what she's talking about) Huh? \nHe's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display of affection and the small child in-between their embrace. \nHAL (CONT'D) There, there. \nINT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY \nMaster Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console as he speaks to Plato. \nMASTER MIND (into phone) A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. I love it. \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nPLATO Then you are absolutely going to love this - \nWe follow Plato's line of sight across the street where we see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN. \nPLATO - He volunteers at a school for the blind. \nINT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY \nIntrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair. \nMASTER MIND He volunteers. He doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul. \nEXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY \nFrom a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child who's sitting on a rock. But up close... \nHAL You greedy little bastard. I already gave you a twenty. \nBLIND KID Hey, you want me to play along? Then pay up, bitch! \nHAL Fine, but you better be convincing. \nHe gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them. \nHAL Here she comes, go to work. \nLike a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his hands and begins to cry. \nBLIND KID (weeping) Why can't I see! Why God? \nHal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder. \nHAL Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me look at you. \nThe Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance. \nThe boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark sunglasses - he should get an Oscar. \nHAL You know, in life we're all given no more than we can bear. This happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it - Maybe to be an inspiration to the other little Peteys out there. \nBLIND KID You really think so, Hal? \nHAL Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying? Now c'mon, go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended. \nThe boy stands up and is about to take off. \nHAL Petey, wait a minute. \nHal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the boy's face before sending him on his way. \nThe Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to absolutely melt. \nHAL Don't run into anything! \nEXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS \nPlato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should be next in line for popehood. \nPLATO I think I've seen enough, sir. This is your guy. \nMASTER MIND (O.S.) (over radio) Then return to base. We have much work to do. \nPlato starts up the van and pulls away. \nINT. BAR - DAY \nIt's a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting pool as the bartender slings drinks. \nHal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him. \nAs he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly catches himself on the bar's TELEVISION - it's a story about how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site. \nHe turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back to the TV. A plan of attack is forming. \nHAL (obviously playing it up for the woman's benefit) Oh, there it is again. This is really getting embarrassing now. \nThe woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take. \nATTRACTIVE   WOMAN Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man who saved that woman   and her baby the other day! It is   you, isn't it? \nTRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them, OVERHEARS. \nHal backs away and trips over a box. \n\"PAT MORITA\" Calm. All things must be filtered through calmness. \nHAL Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to freak out. \n\"PAT MORITA\" I think we must work on your attitude first. \nHAL Look I'm gonna call the cops in about two seconds if you don't get out of here. \nPat rises and walks to Hal. He's so calm it makes Hal calm. \n\"PAT MORITA\" Are you calm now? \nHAL Yeah, I'm okay. \nPat slaps him across the face hard. \n\"PAT MORITA\" Good, because we've got a lot of work to do. \nHal grabs his jaw. \nHAL What the hell was that for? \n\"PAT MORITA\" Rule number one: expect the unexpected. \nHAL Can you just tell me what this is all about? \n\"PAT MORITA\" The heavens are not in the habit of bestowing a gift such as this to just anyone. You are being rewarded for being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in humanity. \nHAL That's me alright. \n\"PAT MORITA\" I am to train you so you may fulfill your destiny to defeat the great menace to Metro City: Master Mind. \nPat gets up and walks toward the door. \n\"PAT MORITA\" (CONT'D) Come. \nHAL We're are we going? \n\"PAT MORITA\" To train. \nEXT. PAT'S CAR - DAY \nPat is sitting in the driver's seat. The car is bumping up and down. \n\"PAT MORITA\" Strength is just as much in the mind as it is the muscle. Remember, both need to be exercised. \nWe PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head. He's hardly straining. \nHAL I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!! \nPat leans on the HORN. \n\"PAT MORITA\" Hey, Corky? You listening? \nTwo highly attractive female joggers run by. They're clearly impressed with Hal's show of strength. He smiles and mouths a \"hello.\" \nHAL Yeah, work both muscles. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nPat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up and carefully takes aim...at Hal's chest. \n\"PAT MORITA\" Trust me. \nHAL What are you doing!? \n\"PAT MORITA\" An invulnerability test. Something wrong? \nHAL Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to get shot. Do not fire that thing! \nFrustrated, Pat lowers the gun. \n\"PAT MORITA\" You're bulletproof. \nHAL Okay, do you know that for sure? \nPat quickly aims and fires. \nHal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets off his chest. \n\"PAT MORITA\" I do now. \nHal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch. \nHAL You suck. \nEXT. SKY - DAY \nShe tosses it in a nearby garbage can. \nROXANNE (CONT'D) Of course I already ate half of it. I wonder what that says about my character? \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" It means you don't give up on a sandwich. You see that it has potential, and you give it every chance to be all it can be. \nRoxanne smiles at his analogy. \nROXANNE Thanks, but knowing me, I was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. It might have been okay at first, but I just made it bitter. \nJohn Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Is that what happened with your last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend? \nROXANNE When I look back, I probably shouldn't of expected so much from him. He was already a giving person. You know, one of those go out and save the world types. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" I've run into a few. \nROXANNE I was selfish, I guess. I didn't want to share him with anybody else. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" It sounds like he was a special man. \nROXANNE They broke the mold. \nJohn Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Perhaps not. \nINT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY \nHal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It's not unlike Uberman's except for a giant \"T\" on his chest. (From here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN) \nTITAN What's the \"T\" stand for? \n\"PAT MORITA\" Titan. \nTITAN What's that supposed to mean? \n\"PAT MORITA\" It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's father...oh, just go with it. You look perfect. \nTITAN I don't think this mask is big enough. Are you sure no one is gonna recognize me? \n\"PAT MORITA\" It's fine, just don't slouch. It's all in the posture. \nHe grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa. \n\"PAT MORITA\" (CONT'D) It is time. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nThere is a long line of people snaked around the velvet ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open teller window. \nFour men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank. \nJohn fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an immediate panic. \nJOHN Alright folks, this is a robbery. Nobody moves - yadda, yadda, yadda... \nRingo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills into a bag. \nAs John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER'S head. \nGEORGE The safe. Let's go. \nBANK MANAGER Okay, just don't hurt anyone. \nGEORGE Yeah, yeah, yeah. \nGeorge leads him out by the collar. \nCRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold superhero stance with hands on hips. \nTITAN Well, boys, there's no need for all this just to get the free toaster. \nPaul cocks his gun. \nPAUL What are you suppose to be? \nWe move in for a nice dramatic close up. \nTITAN Justice. \nGEORGE Well, justice, suck on this... \nGeorge, John and Paul open fire on Titan. \nHe just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him. \nWith their guns empty the three just stare at him in amazement. \nMaster Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads \"Metro's New Hero: Tighten.\" \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) No matter, I suppose. \nMaster Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace around the room with his arms folded behind his back. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) We've now fully established Titan as Metro City's hero. They will love him just as they loved Uberman. Everything is going according to plan. \nEinstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear. \nEINSTEIN (whispering) Yeah, if the plan is getting us in jail. \nMaster Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over, standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen. \nMASTER MIND You know, Einstein, maybe I should have called you Socrates. He also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself. \nEINSTEIN I just fail to see the point in all of this. I mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one? I mean, Uberman is destroyed, we should be using this opportunity to...to... \nMASTER MIND To what? \nEINSTEIN I don't know. To take over the weather, space, the world - whatever super villains are SUPPOSED to do. \nMASTER MIND The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth, like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over. \nEinstein throws up his hands. He's had enough. He pulls off his wig and throws it to the floor. \nEINSTEIN That's it! This balance of the force bullshit is getting way too Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's with me? \nMASTER MIND You dare? \nEINSTEIN Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing stupid costumes, and I'm sick of working for a super villain who's turning into a softie. \nPlato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor. They turn to Master Mind for his rebuttal. \nMASTER MIND What - did - you - call me? \nEINSTEIN You heard me. You used to be an inhuman monster, now look at you. You're creating super heroes, you don't go with us on robberies anymore, it's been days since you threatened anyone, oh, and not to mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing. \nMASTER MIND THAT is none of your business, knave! \nEINSTEIN Hey, you guys haven't sealed the deal yet, have you? \nMASTER MIND Silence! \nEINSTEIN (In a woman's voice) Oh, Master, your head is so big. \nMASTER MIND I'm warning you, Einstein. \nEINSTEIN (In a woman's voice) Take me! \nMASTER MIND I said silence! \nWith his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the throat and lifts him into the air. \nEinstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of Master Mind's grip. \nMaster Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the floor. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Get out of my sight. \nEXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nRoxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a fancy restaurant. \nROXANNE Don't get me wrong, I love being a reporter. I don't think I could do anything else. It's the consequences of what we do that I'm having a problem with. \nHe listens intently as he refills her glass with wine. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" That's where journalistic responsibility comes in, no? \nROXANNE It's supposed to. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Sounds to me like you're running from something. \nROXANNE I got someone I cared about killed. If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been involved. \nJohn suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing what she's talking about. \nHe reaches across the table and takes her hand. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" You can't blame yourself. My father used to say each of us must answer the great call to truly feel alive. \nROXANNE Was he an actor? \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a horrible one. I mean he would fail time and time again at his...landscaping. And sometimes he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown in jail - \nROXANNE Jail? \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" My point is he took the good with the bad. He grew a little each time. Improved, learned. \nINT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nShe pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty. \nROXANNE Damn. \nShe grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe. \nEXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING \nRoxanne steps outside. \nROXANNE Please be open. \nAcross the street is a liquor store. The light is still on. \nROXANNE (CONT'D) Thank God. \nShe walks across the street, passing in front of Master Mind's car. \nSpotting her, he sinks down in his seat. \nRoxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence. \nRelieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into the store. \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT \nRoxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the counter. \nROXANNE A pack of Lady Strikes, please. \nEXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT \nMaster Mind is talking on his cell phone. \nMASTER MIND Hello, Triple A? \nHe suddenly spots something across the street. \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT \nA HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out a gun from under his coat. \nEXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT \nMaster Mind stares in shock. \nMASTER MIND I'll call you back. \nHe hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the store. \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT \nThe Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full of cash from the register. \nSHOPKEEPER Hey! \nSHOTGUN HOODLUM Shut up, Gramps. \nHe turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her neck. \nSHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT'D) Gimme that necklace! \nROXANNE I don't think so. \nThe Hoodlum cocks his shotgun. \nSHOTGUN HOODLUM I said give it to me! \nMASTER MIND (O.S.) The lady said no. \nThe hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs and blinking lights. \nThe hoodlum starts to laugh. \nSHOTGUN HOODLUM What the hell's that? A super soaker? \nMASTER MIND No, it's a goo gun. \nThe hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind. \nSHOTGUN HOODLUM Yeah, what's it do? \nMASTER MIND It goos. \nMaster Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store in a cloud of SMOKE. \nThe smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL, covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK. \nMOMENTS LATER \nTitan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN. Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run around in chaos. \nTITAN Man, what the hell happened down there? Wait a sec - \nHe stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization. \nTITAN (CONT'D) THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!! \nEXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nTitan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home. Reporters stand just beyond the police line. \nTITAN Crap. \nFrom the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita. \nTITAN (CONT'D) PAT! \nTitan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms. \nTITAN (CONT'D) You okay? \n\"PAT MORITA\" I'm dying, kid. There is just one last lesson I have for you. It is the most important of all. \nTITAN What's that? \n\"PAT MORITA\" Master Mind did this, you must avenge me. \nTITAN Master Mind? Why? \n\"PAT MORITA\" Because he's evil. You must stop the evil Hal - stop the... \nPat's body goes limp. \nThe cameras begin to pop and flash around them. \nTitan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully over him. The reporters rush over. \nREPORTER 1 Tighten, Is this the work of Master Mind? \nREPORTER 2 How will the death of your mentor affect your resolve? \nREPORTER 3 Was that Pat Morita? \nTitan walks up to one of the cameras. \nTITAN This injustice will not go unpunished. Master Mind, if you can hear me, Tighten is coming for you. \nIn the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS PARAMEDICS, load pat's body onto a stretcher. \nPLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing dead. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT \nMaster Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy. \nMASTER MIND Alright, people, we don't have much time. Titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out. \nThere is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall being tinkered with by Da Vinci. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) How's the death ray coming? \nDA VINCI Nearly up to full power, sir. \nMASTER MIND Hum. Let's turn it down a few notches. It's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we? \nPlato enters the room. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Anything on the radar yet? \nPLATO Not yet, sir. \nMASTER MIND I see. Well, he must be planning something big. Are the flame androids deployed? \nPLATO All twelve. \nMaster Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on his throne. \nMASTER MIND Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da Vinci, take your places next to me. \nThey move to either side of the chair. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) No slouching. \nDa Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut. \nThey remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no Titan. \nMASTER MIND What do I think? \nMaster Mind shakes his head tiredly. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) I think you're probably the biggest idiot I've ever met. I mean, I can't believe you. All your gifts, all your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment. You know what? Your kind of people make me sick. \nTitan puts down his drawing. \nTITAN I worked hard on this. \nMASTER MIND Oh - gee - I am so sorry! \nMaster Mind looks to Heaven in disgust. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) (under his breath) Of all the people to pick, it had to be this loser. \nThis strikes a cord with Titan. \nTITAN Now, hold on. You're going a little too far. \nMASTER MIND I wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache. \nTITAN Hey, I mean it. \nMaster Mind gets right in his face. \nMASTER MIND Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? \nEXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nWe see Master Mind's body CRASH through the building and land in a DUMPSTER across the street. \nA car pulls up. The driver's door opens. Da Vinci gets out and runs to help his master. \nDA VINCI Master! \nMASTER MIND (O.S.) It hurts. \nDa Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind's body cushioned by a stack of trash bags. \nDA VINCI What hurts? \nMASTER MIND It! \nThe overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall. \nTITAN I don't need you, I don't need anybody. I have the power to do and take anything I want. And now, I'm gonna take back everything this city owes me. Beware Metro City, it's time for Titan to collect. \nTitan shoots up into the air. \nTITAN (CONT'D) Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY THE WAY I WANT TO FLY! \nHe takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were piloting an invisible jet. \nMaster Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan disappear into the distance. \nDA VINCI How'd the plan go, boss? \nMASTER MIND I just made myself redundant, old friend. \nDa Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff. \nDA VINCI It's not that bad. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nTitan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks nostalgic. \nA SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his TV idol. \nSECURITY GUARD Morning, Tighten. \nTITAN Morning. \nSECURITY GUARD Is there something we can do for you? \nTITAN Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just here to make a withdrawal. \nTitan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration from all. \nA little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good- natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault. \nThe security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK OF CASH. \nSure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out the door. \nThe bank manager comes over to the guard. \nBANK MANAGER Say, did he just rob us? \nMASTER MIND There can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's me. \nTITAN Really? \nTitan melodramatically throws up his arms. \nTITAN (CONT'D) I guess I should leave town then, huh? \nMASTER MIND I have a better idea - NOW! \nTwo floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan. \nTitan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars, tries to pull them apart but can't. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) That's copper my good man. Your one weakness. (MORE) MASTER MIND(cont'd) For all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect. \nTitan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW. \nAs he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from under the street in front of him. \nMaster Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded. \nTitan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops. \nTITAN You know what? You're nothing but a bug. Not even worth my effort. \nHe turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the street. \nPlato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They watch Titan shrink into the distance. \nMASTER MIND He's not as dumb as I thought. \nPLATO I guess not...Funny, though. \nMASTER MIND What's funny? \nPLATO Funny Uberman didn't think of the same thing. \nEXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY \nAs Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city below. \nSuddenly, something catches his attention. \nHAL That's it! \nHe stops, hovering in place as he looks down below. \nThe buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane. \nHAL Hello, Legacy. \nEXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY \nVinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a COMMOTION. \nThey look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL from the top of the establishment. \nVINNIE Hey, that's my ball! \nINT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nRoxanne enters the building's elevator. Just before the door closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in. \nELDERLY WOMAN That was a close one. Sixth floor, please. \nRoxanne smiles and goes to press the button. \nThe elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the floor unconscious. \nINT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nRoxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her living room. \nWe hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to adjust her vision. \nSlowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear. \nIt's Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks to be some kind of JOURNAL. \nMASTER MIND Wow, I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college. \nROXANNE That's my diary. \nMASTER MIND So it is. \nROXANNE It's personal. \nMASTER MIND Well, then I wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find. \nTITAN Well, I'm going to make something that can't be taken away from me. I'm going to create a permanent monument to my greatness. One that won't be so easily forgotten or erased. \nThe camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING BALL from Kingpin's. \nTITAN I intend to create a new category in the Guinness Book of World's Records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling. \nHe grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS. We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN FORMATION. \nTITAN My thanks to the city planning commission. This wouldn't have been possible without them. \nTitan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again. \nTITAN Tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow. \nBACK TO SCENE \nROXANNE My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy the whole business triangle. \nMaster Mind seems to be contemplating something - something bad. \nROXANNE What? \nMASTER MIND My lair is in the direct path of the ball. \nROXANNE Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want anything to happen to your hideout, would we? \nMASTER MIND You don't understand. I have certain equipment that's - that's highly unstable. \nROXANNE What do you mean? \nMASTER MIND I sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay? \nROXANNE A HYDROGEN reactor? \nMASTER MIND It's experimental - only one in the world...Well, how do you think I power all my inventions? Someone like me can't pay for electricity. The bills would be outrageous. \nROXANNE A REACTOR? \nMASTER MIND It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one...If destroyed it could... \nROXANNE - Vaporize the entire city! \nMASTER MIND (proudly) Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard, actually. That little baby is amazing. I'm quite proud of it. (MORE) MASTER MIND(cont'd) (off her deadpan reaction) I mean...we'd better find a way to stop him. \nMaster Mind thinks a moment. \nMASTER MIND Did Uberman have a hideout? \nROXANNE What? \nMASTER MIND A cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. C'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. Roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance. \nROXANNE It's under his house. \nMASTER MIND Whose house? \nRoxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him. \nROXANNE Wayne Scott's. \nMaster Mind shoots up out of his chair. \nMASTER MIND Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist? But he disappeared - \nROXANNE (interrupting) He disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him. Not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous man. \nPerhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head. \nMaster Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds. \nRubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the door. \nROXANNE (CONT'D) Looks like you got what you always wanted. Uberman is out of the picture and Metro City is doomed. \nHe grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words. \nMASTER MIND \"Metro City doomed.\" You know, I never thought I'd say something like this, but here it goes - \nHe slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Not if I have anything to say about it. \nEXT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT \nMaster Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe. \nMASTER MIND Such a dark place for one such as you. I wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice? \nHe walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear them off with his metal hand. \nWAYNE SCOTT I always planned to retire - eventually. I mean, come on, you can't do this sort of thing in your fifties. You'd just look ridiculous. \nThe pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in Master Mind's head. \nMASTER MIND I see it all so clearly now. \nINT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK \nMaster Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the observatory explodes. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.) You must have done it just seconds before the observatory exploded. \nINT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK \nSimilar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the cage. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.) You bore out from under the cage. Then, using your Uber-Speed, - \nEXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK \nRunning in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in front of some bushes. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.) - you made your way to safety, where you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere. \nEXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY \nUberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D) Then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion, then... \nJust as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the SKELETON like a javelin. \nIt soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the windshield of Master Mind's hydrofoil. \nEND OF FLASHBACK \nWayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed. \nWAYNE Man, you ARE smart. \nMASTER MIND But why fake your death? Why go through all of it? You could have just quit. \nWAYNE SCOTT But the responsibility would still be there. (MORE) WAYNE SCOTT(cont'd) A cop can retire and stop handing out speeding tickets - but people expect more from superheroes. I tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt in Zimbabwe without everyone expecting me to do something about it. I figured, out of sight, out of mind. \nMASTER MIND And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to disappear? \nWAYNE SCOTT Both of my lives have so much baggage. It's time for new baggage, you know? \nMaster Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted. \nMASTER MIND I just can't believe it. This whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart? \nWayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to say no more. \nWAYNE SCOTT I don't want to hear about it. That's why I don't have a television in here to remind me of all the things I SHOULD be doing. Hell, I could get a wife to do that. \nMASTER MIND There's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean, your city. \nWayne shrugs indifferently. \nMASTER MIND You're really going to do nothing? \nWAYNE SCOTT Good and evil have a way of balancing themselves out. If this guy is as bad as you say, somebody will rise up to fight him. It's just the order of things. You found me, didn't you? \nWayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind's shoulder. \nWAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D) I know it's hard, but you'll find someone else someday. \nHe then starts walking to the door. \nMASTER MIND You're the only one who can stop him. \nWayne turns around. \nWAYNE SCOTT Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a plane to catch. \nMASTER MIND A plane? \nWAYNE SCOTT Going to Barbados for a little change in climate. Now, if you'll excuse me, I got to go pack. \nHe reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face. \nWAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D) You were a good foe. I'm sorry if I've let you down. If it makes a difference, you were the best foe a hero could ask for. \nMASTER MIND Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap. \nWAYNE SCOTT Well, you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper. Now that made me sweat a little. Took me way too long to drill out from under that cage. \nMASTER MIND I got lucky. \nTitan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine- gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a nearby car. \nHe looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It's nose- mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him. \nTitan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The bottom of it was blown apart in the blast. \nTITAN (CONT'D) Didn't mean to get you involved in all of this. \nHe stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun gets a bead on him. \nTITAN (CONT'D) Hey, man! You killed my suds! \nTitan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his hand. \nIt flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like a car dropped off a building. \nTITAN (CONT'D) That's one was for you, beer. \nTitan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and Frank still hiding behind the building. \nTITAN Guys, please tell me you got that last bit. \nBRAD HELMS Huh? \nTITAN You're kidding me. I give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing? \nBRAD HELMS We were afraid something might hit us. \nTITAN Looks like I've given the story of the century to the wrong man. \nHe thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him. \nTITAN Wait. What about that other reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs. \nBRAD HELMS Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a much better reporter than I am. You want her. \nTITAN Where can I find her. \nFRANK We're actually not supposed to give out that sort of information. \nBRAD HELMS 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe she lives in a penthouse. \nTITAN You've been very helpful. \nHe tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream cone. \nIn the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of the Metro City river. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY \nMaster Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb. \nMASTER MIND Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible. \nDA VINCI Master, why must we flee? \nMASTER MIND I told you, Titan is too powerful. If he's set on destroying us, there's precious little we could do about it. \nDA VINCI Where are we going? \nMASTER MIND To another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight. We'll start over, we'll go back to doing what we do best. \nPLATO With our tails between our legs? \nThe old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man. \nMASTER MIND Plato, do you have a better plan?! \nMaster Mind's cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his men and answers it. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Hello...Roxanne? \nINT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT \nRoxanne paces back and forth on the phone. \nROXANNE What are you going to do about Tighten? \nINTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone. \nMASTER MIND Right now I'm packing, later I'll have a snack on the train. \nROXANNE You're running away? \nMASTER MIND In a word - yes. \nROXANNE You created this monster... \nMASTER MIND I didn't create this - the god's of irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve. \nBYSTANDER 2 Uberman's alive! \nBYSTANDER 3 We're saved! \nAs the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro City's newly resurrected champion. \nMASTER MIND I thought. \nUBERMAN So did I. \nHe puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder. \nUBERMAN Thank you, old enemy. \nMASTER MIND For what? \nUBERMAN Showing me the error of my ways, Showing me I'm meant to be this city's savior, showing me that, while we can try, there is no running away from our true destiny. \nWith that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON. \nMaster Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING EYES. \nTITAN Oh...Did I interrupt something? \nMaster Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him. \nTITAN Where you going, buddy? \nTitan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across the street into a parked car. \nTITAN (CONT'D) Welcome to Paintown. Population: you. \nMaster Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a daze, unable to move. \nTitan flies up in the air. \nTITAN (CONT'D) Time to finish this. \nWith his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master Mind. He's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing blow. \nMaster Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands. \nMASTER MIND WAIT!!! \nTitan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like an old Warner Bros cartoon. \nTITAN What? \nMASTER MIND Quick joke - What's the capital of Thailand? \nTITAN Huh - I don't know. \nMASTER MIND It's bang cock! \nIn a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN THE GROIN. \nThe once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching, with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the pain suddenly surging through his member. \nTITAN (CONT'D) Ow. \nBaffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER. \nMASTER MIND So, I guess pennies are good for something. \nHe punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold. \nMaster Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE. \nRoxanne comes up to him. \nThe crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He's not sure what to make of it. \nROXANNE Pretty strange, huh? \nMASTER MIND They're cheering for me. \nROXANNE You saved them. You saved everybody. How's it feel? \nMaster Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to well up a little. \nMASTER MIND It's a...it's nice, you know? I usually don't get a lot of feedback. (whispering) But I also kind of caused all this. What happens when they find that out I was the cause of some of this? \nRoxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master Mind. \nROXANNE What they don't know won't hurt them. \nMASTER MIND I guess that is all in the past. \nROXANNE You're the hero. \n", "test1_input": "ROXANNE It was conflict he thrived on. He always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if Master - I mean, this guy were gone. It was like he needed it, like oxygen. \nThe answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" (almost to himself) I think I finally understand...The only logical answer is to recreate that rivalry - or if that's impossible, create one of equal structure. That's it! \nROXANNE What? \nJohn Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's heard every word. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing for a part...where I play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate times. \nIn a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair. \n\"JOHN CUSACK\" I have to go right now, but I'd really like to see you again - if that's alright. \nRoxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the craziness of the situation. \nROXANNE I'd love that. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY \nMaster storms in the office to find Plato and Einstein playing darts with the original Mona Lisa. \nEINSTEIN Got her nose! \nMASTER MIND I've got it! \nEveryone stops what they're doing upon seeing that their master has returned. \nMASTER MIND I've got it! \nMASTER MIND It's plain and simple. Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: I must create a new superhero. \nEINSTEIN Yeah, maybe that's not such hot idea... \nMASTER MIND (ignoring him) Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis! \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY \nThe lab is slick, white and ultra modern. \nDressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly. \nMASTER MIND Prepare the subject. \nHe glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a huge vat dangles precariously. \nMaster Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and Einstein. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Plato, pour the toxic waste. \nPlato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of gallons of green and brown goo into the hole. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Drainage. \nThe slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo- soaked Severs. \nMaster Mind looks into the pit. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Well, Severs? \nSEVERS I feel fine. Just a little sticky, but aside from that everything's completely - \nBOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves an inch. Finally... \nMASTER MIND Okay then. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - LABORATORY - DAY \nThrough a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally. \nMASTER MIND And this one? \nPLATO We attached gills to him. He can breath under water. \nMASTER MIND Ah. Does he have extraordinary strength? \nPLATO Well...no. \nMASTER MIND Can he fly? \nPLATO No. \nMASTER MIND Resilient to weapons fire? \nPLATO No. \nMASTER MIND He just breathes under water, then. \n", "test1_true": "Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away. \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY \nThe next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass tube not much wider than himself. \nMASTER MIND Plato, the radioactive spider, please. \nPlato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto Stenwick's arm. \nStenwick looks and winces as it bites him. \nSTENWICK Ow! \nHe brushes the spider off. \nMASTER MIND Anything, Stenwick? \nSTENWICK (shaken) No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this was about spiders. I have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia. \nMaster Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato. \nMASTER MIND We're gonna need more venom. \nPlato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he's engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) How `bout now, Stenwick? ....Stenwick? \nINT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY \nMaster Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in the background. \nMASTER MIND This has proven to be a challenge. I just don't know what I want. What do I want? \nHe stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no advice. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) I want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong. Someone who doesn't seek power - instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion. \nEinstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's attention. \nEINSTEIN Yeah, well, it sounds like what you want is Uberman. \nMaster Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand. \nMASTER MIND That's it! Why make a copy when the real thing will do? \nThe lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what they're hearing. \nEINSTEIN I was just kidding, sir. In case you forgot, you actually burned Uberman alive. \nMASTER MIND Then we'll make a new one. Plato, bring me the box! \nMINUTES LATER \nMaster Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small table. \nPlato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center. \nAs Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE GLOW emanating from inside. \nMASTER MIND Behold - Uberessence. The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers. \nEINSTEIN Where the hell did you get that? \nMASTER MIND Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never got around to following up with that. \nPLATO I believe he defeated you before you could, master. \nMASTER MIND ...Right. Man, he was good! \nDA VINCI You want another volunteer, sir? \nMASTER MIND Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure. \nMaster Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with white lettering that reads: \"Hal Stewart - Metro City's Newest Hero?\" \nNEWS REPORTER ...who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and her child. \nHAL Please, please, you're embarrassing me. I saw someone in need and I helped them. What more can we ask of ourselves. I ask you, what more? \nA smile creeps across the evil one's face. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Somebody like him! \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nPlato is sitting in the van, staring into a pair of binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone. \nPLATO Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece of work. He used to teach bowling at Kingpin's. \n", "test1_id": 1797, "test2_input": "MASTER MIND Follow him. \nINT. HAL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIt's a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a minefield. \nHal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights wobble and streak like a hallucination. \nHe shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks worse. \nHal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a chair. The room begins to swim. \nHis CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him. \nFrom Hal's POV the cat's face looks like we're seeing it through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it. \nCAT You don't look so good, man. \nHAL I don't feel good. I was struck by freaking lightening. \nSuddenly Hal realizes his cat's talking to him. \nHAL (CONT'D) AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk? \nCAT No, you're just hallucinating. By the way, we're out of orange juice. \nHAL AAAAAAHHHHH! \nHal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself out on the coffee table. \nINT. HAL'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nHal lies in the same position we left him last night. \nHe sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst hangover in the world. \nFinally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not really sure what he's looking for. \nHAL Man... \nShaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator. \nHe pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his mouth. It's empty. \nAs if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself. \nHe shakes the thought from his mind. \nBATHROOM \nHal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants. \nHAL'S FACE \nHe stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content look washes over his face. \nThere is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and SPLINTERING. \nThe sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM SMASHING THE TOILET. \nHAL (CONT'D) Oh, God! \nHe whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL. \nHAL (CONT'D) Oh, God! \nHe freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window. \nHAL (CONT'D) Oh, God! \nHe aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now, to see the floor give way. \nFinally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole. \nHe sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the smashed toilet on his pancakes. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nHal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the stop. \nHAL Wait! \nHe starts running after it. \nZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING. \nHAL (CONT'D) Whoa, whoa, whoa! \nUnable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls back to the ground. \n", "test2_true": "Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet. \nHAL (CONT'D) Something's not right here. \nHe slaps himself in the face as hard as he can. \nHAL (CONT'D) Wake up! Wake up, Hal! \nHONK! \nHal spins around to see a car barreling toward him. \nHe goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the sidewalk. \nHal sits up, disheveled and scared. \nHAL (CONT'D) Okay, okay. Let's get it together, man. \nHe closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity. \nHAL (CONT'D) This is just some sort of...episode. It will pass, it will pass. \nHe opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him. \nHAL (CONT'D) Well, not too fast I hope. \nAs she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one. \nHAL (CONT'D) Yes, fast, fast! \nHe turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business. \nHe rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone has returned to a clothed state. \nHe relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's floating a foot off the ground. \nHAL (CONT'D) I think I need to go home. \nINT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nHal's front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master Mind. \nHe walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he notices the giant hole in the floor. \nMASTER MIND Welcome to your second birth, Hal Stewart. \nMaster Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look over a \"KARATE KID\" POSTER on Hal's living room wall. \nHe focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a young Ralph Macchio to kick. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Instruction is very important in the formative years. Every hero needs a mentor, a father figure to look up to. \nHe presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA. \n\"PAT MORITA\" Perfect. \nINT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nHal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge and takes a long pull from it. \nVOICE (O.S.) A man will usually find that if he drinks from a bottle, eventually, the bottle drinks from him. \nHal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands. \nHAL Who are you!? \nVOICE I am the guide on your journey. Fate has chosen you to be it's champion. \nPat Morita steps out from the shadows. \nHal passes out again. \nLATER \nWe are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He appears to be lying on the couch. \nHe hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is as it seems. \nHe lays his head back down. \nHAL Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I must be losing it. \nA voice sounds right next to his ear. \n\"PAT MORITA\" (O.S.) You know you're out of orange juice? \nHal leaps up to find he's been resting his head on Pat's lap. \nHAL Jesus! This isn't happening, this isn't happening. \n", "test2_id": 1798, "test3_input": "TELEVISION \nA news report shows an aerial shot of Titan setting the giant ball down in the middle of a vacant city street. \nREPORTER We interrupt your regular afternoon programming to show you live footage of a potential dangerous situation in downtown Metro.

We now go to her with a live report. \nDA VINCI Sir, I think you should see this! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nRoxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her hand. \nROXANNE I'm here with the cause of the destruction in Metro City. He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall \"Asskickiness.\" He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown Metro City as his pins. \nTitan suddenly steps into the shot. \nTITAN And I'm going for the biggest strike ever. \nHe leans into the camera. \nTITAN And you, Metro City, have a ringside seat as I cement my name in the anal of history. \nROXANNE Annals. \nTITAN What? \nROXANNE Nevermind. \nEXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nTitan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot. \nTITAN (in quiet professional bowler announcer voice) Like Tiger before him, a young savior has come to raise a sport from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart, a young man with a dream, realizing that dream here today, folks. (MORE) TITAN(cont'd) One might click there heels and say \"There's no place like home\" upon finding themselves in such a fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much at home right were he is - with a ball in hand and glory in his sights. \nINT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nIn the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR glows and HUMS MENACINGLY. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRoxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away. \nROXANNE Hal, I know everyone treated you like shit, but you don't have to do this. \nTITAN You're right. I don't HAVE to do anything. Isn't that cool? \nTitan lines up his shot. \nTITAN Here's one for the record books! \nTitan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main street. \nROXANNE \nHer face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable destruction of Metro City. \nAs the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake; cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete sphere brushes along side buildings. \nTITAN \nHe smiles in anticipation and uses \"body English\" to direct the ball. \nGIANT BOWLING BALL POV \nIt's nearly halfway to its target. \nROXANNE \nShe closes her eyes. \nTitan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something we don't. \nAbout two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a defensive barrier. An enormous letter \"M\" is etched in the web's center. \nTITAN (CONT'D) What the...? \nThe ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly reduced. \nFRANK Look, what's that flying in the air? \nWe suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A JET PACK. \n", "test3_true": "MASTER MIND C'mon, slow down \nMaster Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to empty. \nMASTER MIND C'mon. \nThe ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.

What other trailer park sports can you play? \nTITAN You are becoming a real pain in my ass. I should have done this a long time ago. \nTitan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the city with Titan in hot pursuit. \nMASTER   MIND (CONT'D) (into walkie   talkie) Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne, he's falling for   it. \nELSEWHERE \nA flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight. \nHe turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left. \nSitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange collar. It smiles at him. \nTITAN What the hell? \nFrom behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO CONTROLLED APES. \nTITAN (CONT'D) GODAMNIT! \nThe critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one off two more jump him. \nTitan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their sight they begin to attack the fruit. \nMASTER MIND \nHe's a block away frantically hitting his remote. \nMASTER MIND Shit! Stupid monkeys and their fruit. \nTitan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with only his head sticking out. \nTITAN (CONT'D) No more games. \nTitan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND's CHEST. \nMaster Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT. Titan's EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high pressure stream of water. \nMaster Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of CEMENT mix into the truck. \nThe crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan doesn't emerge. \nMaster Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck cautiously. \nMASTER MIND Could it really be that easy-- \n- BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged Titan. \nMASTER MIND (CONT'D) Didn't think so. \nAs the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to give Master Mind the killing blow. \nTITAN If you don't mind, I'm going to punch trough your face now. \nPreparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP. \nAS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY. \nStunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to make sure everything's still in place. \nMASTER MIND I'm alive. \nHe turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him. \nMASTER MIND Uberman? \nThe terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing next to Master Mind. \nBYSTANDER 1 It's Uberman! \n", "test3_id": 1799}

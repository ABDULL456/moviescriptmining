{"train": "\"YOU CAN COUNT ON ME\" \nScreenplay by \nKenneth Lonergan \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nINT./EXT. A CAR (MOVING). NIGHT \nThe shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the faces of MR. and MRS. PRESCOTT, a pleasant-looking couple in their late thirties, dressed up for a night out. Mr. Prescott drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway. \nMRS. PRESCOTT Why do they always put braces on teenage girls at the exact moment when they're the most self-conscious about their appearance? \nPause. \nMR. PRESCOTT I don't know. \nUP AHEAD, near the top of the oncoming hill, a RED PICKUP TRUCK is poking its nose out of the short exit lane. \nMRS. PRESCOTT Tom -- \nMR. PRESCOTT I see him... \nThe PICKUP LURCHES into the road, with not nearly enough time to spare. \nMRS. PRESCOTT Tom! \nMR. PRESCOTT Jesus! \nMr. Prescott swerves OVER the DOUBLE SOLID WHITE LINE and clears the truck as -- \nAnother pair of HEADLIGHTS from an oncoming truck RISES UP over the HILL directly in FRONT of them -- \nMRS. PRESCOTT (Screams) Tom! \nMr. Prescott's FOOT STOMPS on the BRAKE. We BLACK OUT and there is the SOUND of a terrible CRASH. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE PRESCOTTS' FRONT DOOR. NIGHT \nThe SHADOW of a big man looms up onto the front door. A big finger RINGS the BELL. \nA moment. \nAMY, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the door and looks up. In the b.g. we see TWO CHILDREN, SAMMY (Samantha) and TERRY PRESCOTT, in their pajamas, lying on their stomachs in the living room, watching television. Sammy is eleven. Terry is eight. \nREVERSE: DARRYL, the SHERIFF, a portly fellow with glasses and a mustache, looks down at AMY. \nSHERIFF Hello, Amy. \nAMY (Puzzled) Hi, Darryl. \nSHERIFF (Thinking) Amy, would you please tell the kids you'll be right back, and then shut the door and come outside to talk to us for a minute? \nAMY OK. (To kids) Be right back, you guys! \nSAMMY You're not supposed to go out, Amy. \nTERRY She's going to smoke a cigarette. \nAMY closes the door and looks expectantly up at Darryl. Darryl doesn't know how to start. \nEXT. CHURCH. DAY \nCREDITS BEGIN OVER a blustery April day. The steeple of the little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky. \nINT. TOWN CHURCH. DAY \nIt's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full. There's a CHOIR of mostly SENIOR CITIZENS arrayed in the back. TWO CLOSED CASKETS are laid out in front of the MINISTER, a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and- pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy MOS. \nMABEL Guess who's been asking for you? \nSAMMY Oh no, really? \nMabel nods and passes by. \nSAMMY KNOCKS on a big door that says \"Manager\" and has half the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off it. \nBRIAN (Inside) Yeah, come in! \nSammy swings open the door. BRIAN EVERETT, the new branch manager, is unpacking a box. Sammy is surprised to see he is in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring. \nSAMMY Mr. Everett? \nBRIAN Yeah: Brian. \nSAMMY Brian. Hi. I'm Samantha Prescott -- I'm the lending officer? \nBRIAN Yeah, hi, how are you? Come on in. Sit down. \nSammy comes into the office and sits. \nSAMMY I am so sorry I was late... \nBRIAN Yeah, we missed you before... \nSAMMY I got held up. Believe me, it is not something I make a habit of... \nBRIAN I'm sure it's not. Actually -- could you just, could you close that door for me? Thanks. \nSammy gets up and closes the door. \nINT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. LATER \nSammy sits in front of Brian's desk. Brian is behind the desk listening. \nSAMMY -- so I always just run out at 3:15 to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter's house. Anyway, Larry never minded about it and I was just hoping it would be OK with you too... \nBRIAN Well -- Samantha -- I realize that Scottsville is not exactly a major banking center... \nSAMMY No it's not... \nBRIAN No -- I know it's not... But it's kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we'd be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state. And that means I don't want anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30, or whenever the bus happens to come in that day. Now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school? Does your husband work in the area? Do you -- \nSAMMY Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't \"on the scene.\" So to speak. \nBRIAN Well, I can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement, but... \nSAMMY Well -- Brian? I understand what you're saying, and I think it's great. I do. Because there's a lot of things around here that could use some attention. Believe me. But I've honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes, and if I take the time out of my lunch hour... \nBRIAN I'd really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement. OK? \nSAMMY (Brightly) I'll do my best...! \nBrian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his head. \nBRIAN How old's your son? \nSAMMY He's eight. \nBRIAN That's a terrific age. \nINT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DUSK \nSammy and Rudy drive home in silence. The orange sunlight flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive along. \nEXT. PRESCOTT (SAMMY'S) HOUSE. DUSK \nThe same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years' more wear on it. \nSammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail. \nINT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DUSK \nSAMMY All right. \nBOB I'd be glad to give it some thought... \nSAMMY OK. \nHe is smiling at her. \nSAMMY What? \nBOB Nothing... I'm just glad to see you... I'm glad you called me. \nSAMMY I bet you were surprised...! \nBOB Um -- a little. \nBob drains his wineglass. Sammy cuts at her steak. \nINT. BOB'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nSammy and Bob lie in Bob's bed, a few minutes after having made love. They are very far away from each other, but trying with difficulty not to let on. \nSAMMY I should get going... \nBOB Really? \nSAMMY Yeah... I've got the baby-sitter... But... Thanks for a lovely evening. \nBOB Oh. Thank you. \nShe kisses him. She tries to make it sexy, but he's not into it anymore and he politely restricts the kissing. \nINT. SAMMY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT \nSammy stands in her slip brushing her teeth in front of the mirror. She brushes vigorously, looking at herself while she brushes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STREET CORNER -- WORCESTER, MASS. DAWN \nThe corner window of a grim little apartment building on a very grim street in a grim little city. \nINT. TERRY'S APARTMENT -- WORCESTER, MASS. NIGHT \nA tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not much else. One window has a broken pane and an old sheet neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out. \nTERRY PRESCOTT comes in. He is twenty-five years old: a real mess with a certain natural appeal. He wears old jeans, very old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat. He takes a wool hat off his head. His hair is longish and dirty. \nSHEILA SADLER is sitting at the table by the fridge. She is barely eighteen, frail and damaged. \nSHEILA Hey, Terry. \nTERRY Hey. \nTerry looks at her and smiles encouragingly. She smiles back. \nSHEILA Where'd you get the hat? \nTERRY Oh, I got it on the street for a dollar. \nSHEILA It's nice. \nTERRY Well, you know, it's pretty much your standard woolen hat. \nSHEILA Yeah, I had a very similar reaction to it. \nSheila looks away. Silence. \nTERRY Can I get that money from you? \nSHEILA Yeah. Sorry. \nAs she opens her purse, Terry takes a few vague steps toward her. She takes out a tiny hippie-ish woven wallet and gives Terry all the money in it: a twenty and two ones. \nEXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DAY \nSammy practically bursts out the front door. She has changed into nice clothes. \nEXT. ALLEY. DAY \nTerry secrets himself in a small dark alley. He takes out his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it. SMOKING, he looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley. \nEXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nTerry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street. A skinny man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake hands. Terry says \"Hi,\" but keeps on walking. He passes some other people. \nHe almost runs right into SHERIFF DARRYL, sixteen years fatter and grayer. \nSHERIFF Whoa there! \nTERRY Sorry. \nThe Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile. \nSHERIFF God damn! Terry Prescott! How you doin'? Gimme a cuddle! \nThe Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug. Terry is wasted and selfconscious but smiling. He pats the Sheriff's back. \nTERRY How you doin', Darryl? \nSHERIFF Which way you headed? \nTERRY I'm just goin' to see Sammy at Dawson's... \nSHERIFF Can I walk with you a little? \nTERRY Sure, yeah -- \nSHERIFF So Sammy says you been out in Alaska...? \nTERRY Yeah, I was workin' out there for a little while... \nEXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nThe Sheriff walks along with Terry. Terry, very self-conscious about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. The Sheriff does not seem to notice. \nSHERIFF -- Sammy says she's gettin' postcards from all across the country. \nTERRY Yeah, I've been all over the place... \nThey stop outside Dawson's. \nSHERIFF Well, it's good to have you back here, I'll tell you that. \nTERRY Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the peace. \nSHERIFF Well, that'll be a little harder now that you're home, but I'll do what I can. \nTERRY No, man, I'm reformed. \nSHERIFF Oh, yeah. Good to see you, kid. \nTERRY Thanks, Darryl. \nDarryl walks away. Terry stands outside the restaurant looking for Sammy. \nBehind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table, talking to the waitress. \nShe sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy as she threads her way through the tables toward the door. \nTerry turns and sees her. He breaks into a big smile, tosses his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. Through the window we see them make their way toward each other. \nSammy throws her arms around him. He hugs her back with a big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES. \nINT. DAWSON'S -- AT THEIR TABLE. A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nTerry is studying the menu, over-intently. Sammy is beaming at him. \nSAMMY You just keep looking around, that's all. \nTERRY No, I was just wondering if we could get some more refreshments, actually. \nHe laughs. Looks down. Silence. He looks up at her. \nTERRY I've actually got to confess to you, Sammy... that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that I've been kind of unable to write... on account of the fact that I was in jail for a little while. \nSAMMY You were what? \nA couple of people in the restaurant look at them. Terry notices but Sammy does not. \nTERRY Well, I did a little time, I guess, in Florida. For, uh, just for bullshit... \nSAMMY What?! \nTERRY It was just bullshit... \nSAMMY What did you do? \nTERRY I didn't do anything. Does it occur to you that maybe I was wronged? \nSAMMY No! \nTERRY Well, could I please -- \nSAMMY Oh my God! -- \nTERRY Would you please let me -- \nSAMMY -- What happened?! \nTERRY I got into a fight in a bar down in Florida. Which I was not the one who instigated it, at all. But they worked up all this bullshit against me and they threw me in the pen for three months. I didn't write you because I didn't want you to get all upset about it. I just figured you'd figure I was on the road for a little while. I know it was stupid and I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to make you worry. But you know what? I can't run around all the time doin' stuff or not doin' stuff because it's gonna make you worry! Because then I come back here, and I tell you about my fuckin'... traumas, and I get this wounded little \"I've Let You Down\" bullshit, over and over again, and it really just -- cramps me! Like I just want to get out from under it!... And here I am back in this fuckin' hole explaining myself to you again! \nSAMMY OK -- Can you please stop cursing at me? \nTERRY I mean, I realize I'm in no position to, uh, basically say anything, ever -- But it's not like I'm down there in some redneck bar in Florida having an argument with some stripper's boyfriend and I suddenly think, \"Hey! Maybe this'd be a good time to really stick it to Sammy and get myself locked up for a few months.\" \nSAMMY I'm sorry. \nTERRY Me too, man. I mean \"welcome home.\" \nSAMMY Hey -- You don't write me for six months, I have no idea where you are -- \nTERRY I'm sorry -- \nSAMMY -- I don't know if you're alive or dead -- \nTERRY I'm sorry -- \nSAMMY -- and then you show up out of nowhere and tell me you were in jail? \nTERRY I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Sammy, I'm really sorry...! \nThe patrons are all either looking at them or trying not to look. Silence. \nTERRY Sammy... \nSAMMY What? \nTERRY Um... I'm in the midst of a slight predicament... \nSAMMY What do you need? Money? \nTERRY Um... Yeah... I'm broke. I gotta get back to Worcester tomorrow. I got this girl there, and she's kind of in a bad situation...? I just need to borrow some money. Whatever you can spare. (Pause) I'll pay you back... I'll pay you back, man. \nSAMMY I really wish Mom was here. \nTERRY So do I, man. \nSAMMY Nobody knows what to do with you. \nTERRY I know how they feel, man. \nTERRY (Into phone) When?... Well -- Is she all right?... Well, could I talk to her?... Well, could you give her a message that I -- \nCLICK. He is hung up on. He slowly HANGS UP. \nSammy notices that something's wrong. He looks at her from across the room. \nTERRY That girl I'm with tried to kill herself. \nSAMMY What? \nTERRY She tried to kill herself. \nINT. TERRY'S ROOM. NIGHT \nTerry is sitting on the bed, addressing an envelope to SHEILA. He puts the $300 in the ENVELOPE and seals it. He sees Sammy standing in the doorway. He starts to unlace his boots. \nSAMMY Do you have everything you need? \nTERRY I think so. \nSammy comes into the room and sits next to him. He is very busy with his laces. \nSAMMY What are you going to do? \nTERRY I don't know. Send the money I guess. \nSAMMY Maybe you should stay home for a little while, Terry. \nTERRY Yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea. \nHe starts crying. Sammy pats him. \nEXT. SCOTTSVILLE CHURCH. DAY \nA bright, clear, blue-skied Sunday morning in Scottsville. Inside the little white church they're singing. \nEXT. CHURCH. DAY \nPeople are filing out of the church. We also see a couple of the bank employees, including BRIAN and his very pretty six months' PREGNANT wife, NANCY. We find SAMMY and RUDY. Sammy is chatting to some neighbors. Rudy is bored out of his mind, waiting for her. \nINT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY \nTerry is lying on the sofa, smoking, with his feet up and boots on, watching Sunday morning TV. On the coffee table are his dirty ashtray, dirty bowl and spoon, Rice Krispies box and a milk carton. \nEXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT \nCrickets buzz loudly outside the house. \nINT. STAIRS. NIGHT \nSammy, in her bathrobe, comes down the stairs into the living room. Terry is on the sofa playing with Rudy's Game Boy. He barely looks up when she speaks to him. \nSAMMY I'm going to bed. Do you have everything you need? \nTERRY Yeah. Thanks. \nSAMMY Good night. \nTERRY Good night. \nPause. \nSAMMY Terry, I'm really glad you're home. \nTerry tries to smile at her. \nTERRY Yeah, me too, Sammy. \nHe goes back to his game. She hesitates, then heads back up the stairs. \nINT. SAMMY'S KITCHEN. DAY \nSammy, Terry and Rudy sit at the kitchen table. Sammy is dressed for work. Rudy is dressed for school. Terry is also fully dressed, drinking the last dregs of a mug of coffee. He is tired, but listening to Sammy very carefully, as if receiving difficult and critical instructions. \nRUDY They are? \nTERRY Well, yeah. Your mom is my sister. \nRUDY Yeah, I know. \nTERRY So that means we have the same parents. \nRUDY Oh yeah. \nThey drive in silence for a moment. Terry glances down at Rudy. \nINT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY \nSammy, laden with files, plops down at her desk as Mabel is passing by. Mabel puts a phone message down in front of her. \nMABEL Um -- Carol just called. She said Terry and Rudy never showed up at her house? \nSAMMY You've got to be kidding me. \nA MOMENT LATER: Brian, talking to an employee, sees Sammy, across the bank, hurrying out the employees' exit. \nBRIAN Hey, Sammy? \nSammy doesn't hear and exits. \nEXT. ORRIN'S BACKYARD. DAY \nTerry and Rudy are banging nails with RAY, a young guy Terry's age. Terry, hammering with swift, accurate blows, glances up and watches Rudy for a second. Rudy is hammering away with no great skill. \nTERRY Hey. Look. \nHe moves Rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle. \nTERRY You hold it further down, you're gonna get a lot more power. You should be able to put that nail down with two or three hits. Look: \nWith two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the wood. \nTERRY Try it. \nRUDY That's not the way I hold it. \nTERRY Well, the way you hold it is wrong. \nRUDY Why can't I just do it my own way? \nTerry looks at him unsympathetically for a moment. \nTERRY (Shrugs) You can. \nHe goes back to work. Rudy resumes hammering. After a moment he switches his grip and starts hammering Terry's way. Terry looks up and watches him. \nEXT. IN FRONT OF ORRIN'S HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER \nSammy pulls up, fast, and gets out of the car. Hearing the hammering from the backyard, she walks quickly around the side of the house and stops short when she sees Rudy hammering happily away with Terry and Ray. \nShe watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a very cheerful sight. \nINT. BANK. DAY \nHalf the staff has gone home. Sammy, in her coat, picks a NOTE up off her CHAIR. It reads: \n\"SAMMY, PLEASE SEE ME A.S.A.P!!! -- BRIAN\" \nINT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER \nSammy stands in front of Brian's desk. \nSAMMY Brian? Did you want to see me? \nBRIAN Yeah. I was kind of wondering what happened to you today. \nSAMMY Oh -- Didn't Mabel -- I had a false alarm about my son... \nSAMMY (To TERRY) So lights out at ten... and don't spend the whole night watching TV. \nTERRY Nice to meet you, Bob. \nBOB You too. \nTERRY (To SAMMY) What's your idea of the whole night? \nSAMMY Two hours tops. \nBob holds the door for Sammy and smiles at her. There is some confusion about who should go out first. Finally she goes and Bob follows. The atmosphere between them is fairly awkward. \nINT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT \nTerry and Rudy are watching TV from the sofa. \nTERRY What's your feeling about Bob? \nRUDY I don't really know him that well. \nTerry looks at his watch. \nTERRY I have bad news for you. \nHe picks up the remote... \nRUDY No...! \n...and turns off the TV. They sit there in the sudden silence. \nRUDY Great. What are we supposed to do now? \nTERRY Do you know how to play pool? \nRUDY I've played it. \nEXT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT \nThe Wild Moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the stars. Terry and Rudy get out of the car. Rudy looks apprehensive. \nRUDY I don't think they let kids in there. \nTERRY Well, we're not allowed to watch any more TV, so it's this or nothing... But if we run into any trouble, let me do the talking. \nRUDY OK. \nTerry swings the door open. \nINT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT \nPOV RUDY: A lot of men and women at the bar or in booths, eating and drinking. Smoky, crowded and very loud. As he follows Terry through the crowd various patrons notice him -- some of the looks are friendly, some blank, some cold, i.e., what's a kid doing in here? \nAT THE POOL TABLE: Terry and Rudy stand side by side facing the players and waiting players gathered around the table. Terry waves a few bills. \nTERRY I got a hundred bucks here says me and my nephew can beat anybody in here. Only we gotta get the next game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by ten o'clock. \nA MOMENT LATER: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player are side by side shooting for break. Terry is behind Rudy coaching him. \nTERRY Just hit it nice and soft... Nice and soft. \nThey hit the balls. Rudy just clips his ball and it doesn't go anywhere. 1st Pool Player's ball hits the opposite bank and comes almost all the way back. \nRUDY (To TERRY) Sorry. \nTERRY God damn, Rudy. I thought you said you could play. \nRudy doesn't answer. Terry winks at him. \nA MOMENT LATER: 1ST POOL PLAYER BREAKS -- WHACK! -- The balls scatter. Nothing drops. TERRY steps up to the table, chalking up his cue. \nTERRY Boys, it's all over but the cryin'. \nQUICK CUTS: Of Terry running the table and everyone watching. Three-ball in the side. One-ball in the corner. Nine-ball off three cushions and into the corner, and the eleven-ball into the side. Rudy watches him. \nRudy runs up the stairs. \nTERRY Wait a minute, gimme your jacket! \nRudy tries to take his jacket off fast but gets his arm caught in the sleeve. He tries to shake it off. \nTERRY What are you doing? \nRUDY I can't get my sleeve out...! \nThey HEAR Bob's CAR DOORS SLAM. Terry makes a comic panicked face and leaps up the stairs two at a time. \nOUTSIDE THE HOUSE: Sammy waves to Bob. Bob waves back as he drives off. Sammy goes to the front door, opens it: \nTerry and Rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the top of the stairs, shaking Rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically trying to get the jacket off. \nSammy comes in. They freeze. \nSAMMY What is going on in here? \nTERRY Um -- We were just out doing some star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track of the time. Which I totally warned him about. (To Rudy) You are a bad kid. \nINT. BATHROOM. LATER \nRudy is brushing his teeth. Terry pokes his head in. \nTERRY (In a low voice) Hey: I think it's OK. Just don't tell her where we went, 'cause she'll be really mad at me. OK? \nRUDY I won't. \nTERRY (Suddenly dark) Hey -- I'm not kidding, Rudy. \nRUDY I won't! \nTerry gives him a \"You better not\" look, then leaves. Rudy continues brushing his teeth. \nINT. RUDY'S ROOM. NIGHT \nSammy is tucking Rudy in, stroking his hair. \nSAMMY Did you know my Mommy used to take me and Uncle Terry out at night to look at the constellations? \nRUDY Yeah. \nSAMMY Did you see that one, what's the one -- It looks like a big \"W\"? Cassiopeia? \nRUDY Yeah. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nSammy comes out of Rudy's room, smiling. It's dark. She sees a LIGHT on under TERRY'S DOOR. She walks toward it and steps into the TRENCH, falling down violently. \nSAMMY Ow! Shit! \nINT. BATHROOM. NIGHT \nTerry is putting a butterfly Band-Aid on Sammy's wound. It's a nasty, bloody gash, just shy of needing stitches. \nSAMMY I've got a great idea. Why don't you let me call the plumber? \nTERRY Do whatever you want. \nSAMMY Oh, does that make you mad? \nTERRY No... \nINT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT \nRAIN patters on the ROOF as Sammy LIMPS back and forth across the room changing into her nightgown. \nEXT. TERRY'S WINDOW. NIGHT \nTerry is smoking pot with his head and shoulders stuck outside the window. RAIN FALLS on his HEAD. \nEXT. BUS STOP. DAY \nRUDY is WAITING in a doorway for Terry. He is wet and cold. The RAIN pours down. \nINT. BANK. DAY \nBrian is showing his wife, NANCY, the bank. He is very solicitous of her, nervously introducing her to the employees, who are not responding very warmly. Nancy is not in a warm mood either; she's very testy with Brian. \nBRIAN This is Chuck. Chuck, this is my wife, Nancy. \nCHUCK Hello. \nNANCY Nice to meet you. \nBRIAN This is Mabel... \nMABEL Hi. \nNANCY Nice to meet you. \nSAMMY, at her desk, watches Brian and Nancy make their progress through the bank. Nobody is being very friendly, and Brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable. Brian and Nancy reach Sammy's desk. \nBRIAN This is Sammy, our lending officer. Sammy, this is my wife, Nancy. \nSAMMY (Friendly) Hi. It's nice to meet you. \nNANCY Brian -- I gotta sit down. \nBRIAN Sure -- Let's go in my office. \nHe glances nervously at Sammy as he leads Nancy away from her desk and toward his office. He murmurs something to Nancy, who responds in a low but very testy voice: \nNANCY I'm fine...! \nShe roughly pulls her arm away from his. Sammy watches them go into his office. \nEXT. MAIN STREET. DAY \nRudy trudges resolutely through the pouring rain toward the center of town. He is completely drenched. \nINT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY \nSammy knocks on Brian's open door. \nSAMMY Brian...? \nBRIAN Yeah. \nRUDY (O.C.) Mom! \nSammy sees to her left, down the hallway -- \nSAMMY Rudy! \nRudy is at the end of the hall, drenched and shivering, but cheerful. \nEXT. EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT. DAY \nRudy is in the car, somewhat dried off, waiting. Sammy and Terry stand in the employee entrance doorway. \nSAMMY Look, I'm glad you guys are getting along so well -- like, you have no idea -- but if I can't rely on you to remember to get him once a day... \nTERRY You can! \nSAMMY -- And what are you doing taking him to play pool in the middle of the night, and then telling him to lie to me about it? \nPause. \nTERRY I don't know. \nINT./EXT. SAMMY'S CAR/CAROL'S DRIVEWAY. DAY \nTerry and Rudy pull up in front of the driveway. Terry is in a silent rage. The rain has let up. \nShe leaves. Sammy and Brian pick up their shots. \nBRIAN Well, here's to improved employee- management relations. \nSAMMY Amen. \nThey click shot glasses and drink. \nSAMMY You can't judge all of Scottsville by the people in that bank, believe me. \nBRIAN Well -- Let's -- Let's not talk about the bank. \nSAMMY OK. \nBRIAN Let's just forget about the bank for tonight. \nSAMMY Good idea. \nThey sip their drinks, smiling. Sammy looks at him appraisingly. \nINT./EXT. BRIAN'S CAR/WOODED ROAD. NIGHT \nSammy and Brian are making out in the front seat of his car. This goes on for a while, getting heavier and heavier. \nBRIAN Sammy? \nSAMMY Yeah? \nBRIAN I want you to tell me who changed the colors on my computer screen. \nSAMMY I'll never tell. \nThey start kissing again in the cramped space. Brian bangs his head. They laugh. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR. CONTINUOUS \nWe pull back and away from the car. The sodden trees spout faucets of water down on the car. \nINT. KITCHEN. NIGHT \nThe kitchen is dark. Sammy comes in, her hair a little wet, and turns on the light. She goes to the telephone. \nThere's a NOTE in Terry's handwriting: \n\"BOB CALLED.\" \nTERRY (O.C.) Where were you? \nSammy jumps, startled. Terry is in the kitchen doorway. \nSAMMY Nowhere. I had dinner with my boss. \nTERRY Kind of a late dinner, ain't it? \nSAMMY Yeah. How was Rudy? \nTERRY Fine. \nSAMMY Did the plumber come? \nTERRY Yes, the fucking plumber came. \nSAMMY Terry -- Give me a break!!! \nPause. \nTERRY What's the matter with you? \nSAMMY Nothing. I'm just tired. \nTERRY You want to smoke some pot? \nSAMMY No I don't. Why, you got some? \nThe SUN SHINES on Main Street. \nINT. SPORTING GOODS STORE. DAY \nRudy watches wide-eyed as Terry places on the sales counter two rods and reels, a bunch of lures, two fishing hats, a box of swivels, a knife and a fish scaler. \nTERRY You know who this is for? \nRUDY Me! \nTERRY That's right, my little friend. (To the saleslady) Hello. We're going fishing. \nINT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN. DAY \nSammy, Terry and Rudy are all putting away the groceries. Everybody seems to be getting along. \nRUDY I got a new rod and reel, five lures, I got a hat, I got a knife and I got a fish scaler. \nSAMMY That's great, honey. \nO.C., the DOORBELL RINGS. Sammy starts to move toward the door, but Terry is closer. \nTERRY I'll get it. \nSammy watches him go. \nINT./EXT. FRONT DOOR. DAY \nTerry opens the door. It's Ron, the minister, in his civvies. \nEXT. FRONT YARD. DAY \nRudy is playing basketball by himself. \nINT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY \nTerry, Sammy and RON sit in the living room. Sammy and Ron are drinking coffee. Through the window we see occasional glimpses of Rudy playing basketball in the backyard. There is a heavy silence in the room. \nTERRY Well... I'm not really sure why you're here, Ron. I mean, I realize I haven't exactly been a model citizen since I got here, but compared to how things have been goin' for me lately, I thought I was doing pretty well. \nHe turns to Sammy. \nTERRY And I also find it kind of discouraging that you seem to think I need some kind of spiritual counseling or what have you, so much so that you're willing to disregard the fact that I don't believe in any of this stuff at all -- \nSAMMY Well... I didn't mean to discourage you -- \nTERRY I mean it's really kind of insulting. \nRON Can I say something here? (Pause) Sammy asked me to come and talk to you, because it's her opinion that you're not gonna find what you're looking for the way you're looking for it -- \nTERRY How would she know? \nRON But I'm really not here to try to get you to do anything, or to believe anything. And I'll tell you the same thing I told her, which is that as far as I'm concerned the only way she can help you is by her example -- by trying to be a model for you, by the way she lives her life... \nTerry smiles. \nRON And that doesn't mean she's supposed to be a saint, either, if that's what you're smiling about. \nTERRY I didn't realize I was smiling. \nA moment. \nRON You know, Terry, a lot of people come to see me with all kinds of problems. Drugs, alcohol, marital problems, sexual problems, health problems -- \nTERRY Great job you got. \nRON Well... I like it. Because even in this little town, I feel like what I do is very connected with the real center of people's lives. I'm not saying I'm always Mr. Effective, but I don't feel like my life is off to the side of what's important. You know? I don't feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people. I don't feel like a negligible little scrap, floating around in some kind of empty void, with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies I can scrape together on my own... \nTERRY Well -- \nRON Can I ask you, Terry: Do you think your life is important? \nTERRY You mean -- Like, me personally, my individual life? \nShe throws the sheets at him and storms away. Terry walks through the living room and OUT the front door, SLAMMING it behind him. \nINT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT \nSammy sits by the phone in her bathrobe. She picks it up and DIALS. \nINTERCUT: BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM. NANCY, watching TV on the sofa with Brian, picks up the RINGING PHONE. \nNANCY (Into the phone) Hello? \nSAMMY HANGS UP. She gets up, walks around, sits down again. Picks up the phone and DIALS. It RINGS. \nINTERCUT: BOB'S KITCHENETTE. Bob, making a sandwich for himself, picks up the phone. \nBOB (Into the phone) Hello? \nSAMMY HANGS UP. Pause. She sweeps the TELEPHONE and ANSWERING MACHINE OFF the nightstand. Pause. She calms down and puts them back. The ancient answering machine is CLICKING convulsively. She WHACKS IT and it stops. \nEXT. CHURCH. DAY \nThe congregation is coming out of the church and milling around at the steps. SAMMY, with Rudy at her side, is saying good-bye to some neighbors. She watches pregnant NANCY and BRIAN go down the steps. \nPOV SAMMY: Beyond Brian and Nancy, TERRY pulls up at the curb in her car. He rummages around and produces FISHING RODS which he waves, somewhat sheepishly. \nREVERSE: At top speed, Rudy runs away from Sammy and the church, toward Terry and the car. Terry and Sammy exchange a look from the distance. \nEXT. RECTORY. DAY \nServices are over. Everyone has gone home. \nINT. RON'S OFFICE. LATER \nSammy sits with Ron. \nSAMMY Anyway... I don't know what the church's position is on adultery and fornication these days, but I felt really hypocritical not saying anything to you about it before, so... What is the official position on that stuff these days? \nRON Well... it's a sin. \nSAMMY Good: I think it should be. \nRON ...but we don't tend to focus on that aspect of it, right off the bat -- \nSAMMY Why not? \nRON Well -- \nSAMMY I think you should. \nRON Well -- \nSAMMY Maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss, and were really mean to you, and told you what a terrible thing it was. Maybe it'd be better if you told me how I'm endangering my immortal soul, and if I don't quit I'm going to burn in hell. Don't you ever think that? \nRON Um... No. \nSAMMY Well, it's a lot better than all this \"Why do you think you're in this situation\" psychological bullshit you hear all the time. \nRON Well... Why do you think you're in this situation? \nSAMMY With which one? \nRON All of them. \nPause. \nSAMMY I feel sorry for them. (Pause) Isn't that ridiculous? \nRon shrugs: i.e., \"not necessarily.\" \nEXT. STREAM -- BRIDGE. DAY \nTerry and Rudy are side by side on a small footbridge over a wide running stream, fishing. The sunlight slants through the canopy of trees; the birds are chattering; it's gorgeous and peaceful. \nRUDY I've never been so bored in my life. \nSAMMY Well -- I don't know... \nBOB I don't know. Sammy, I love you. I wish I could say it in a more interesting way. I just -- I love you. \nSAMMY Well -- I mean -- I love you too -- \nHe puts his arms around her and kisses her. She responds very warmly. Just as things are heating up, she suddenly remembers something and jolts away. \nSAMMY Oh shit. \nBOB What's the matter? \nSAMMY I gotta go. I'm sorry -- \nBOB Where do you have to go? \nSAMMY (Off the top of her head) I'm supposed to -- I gotta get Mabel back her car. \nBOB Well... I don't understand. How are we leaving things? \nSAMMY Oh God, I don't know. Call me later. \nINT. MOTEL. DAY \nBrian sits on the edge of one of the beds watching some daytime Sunday show on the motel TV. There is a knock at the door. He gets up, turns off the TV and opens the door. It's Sammy. \nSAMMY Sorry I'm so late. \nBRIAN Yeah, I was just about to give up on you. \nSAMMY Well -- maybe it would've been better if you had... \nShe comes into the room and starts walking around briskly and nervously. \nSAMMY I mean -- Look, I don't mean to be unsympathetic about your domestic situation, whatever it is, but I'm just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to stick to their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their actions, they might end up having a lot less trouble generally. That's all. \nBRIAN Hey, that's what I've been trying to tell you guys at the bank. \nSAMMY Well, I really don't think I can do this anymore. \nBRIAN OK. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM. LATER \nBrian and Sammy lie under the starchy sheets. Brian's eyes are shut. Sammy is very upset with herself. \nSAMMY This is incredible. \nBRIAN Mmmm. \nSAMMY That is not what I mean. \nINT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY \nTerry and Rudy drive along. Terry looks down at Rudy and smiles. Rudy is tense and won't look at him. \nOVER TERRY AND RUDY'S SHOULDERS as Terry drives slowly past dilapidated little houses in a very depressed residential area. Terry is scanning the house numbers. \nRUDY Maybe we should call first. \nTERRY Well -- We're right here. \nHe pulls up outside a small, plain, run-down ranch-style house with a lot of junk out front, and gets out of the car. Rudy stays in. \nTERRY Come on. \nRudy gets out of the car and comes around. Terry waits for him, and then they walk up to the front door. The buzzer says \"KOLINSKI.\" \nTERRY There he is. \nRUDY His last name is Kolinski? \nTERRY Yeah. Ring the bell. \nTERRY I just wanna -- \nRUDY SR. Do you know what you're doin'? Just get outta here! \nTERRY You know what, man? You're still a fuckin' asshole. \nRUDY SR. I'm an asshole? Get outta here! \nRudy Sr. shoves Terry. Terry belts him, and suddenly they are throwing wild punches at each other. Rudy goes sprawling in the dirt. \nTerry knocks Rudy Sr. down and starts pummeling him brutally. Janie comes out of the house and jumps on his back, trying to pull him off. \nJANIE Get your fuckin' hands off him...! \nTerry throws Janie off him, grabs Rudy Sr. again and resumes beating him up. Janie jumps back on top of him. \nTwo neighbors run toward the melee to break it up. \nCUT TO: \nA FEW MOMENTS LATER: The cops have arrived. The 1ST COP is talking to Rudy and Janie. The 2ND COP is talking to Terry. Rudy Sr.'s face looks puffy and beaten up. A 3RD COP stands apart with Rudy, who is watching the whole thing. WE CUT rapidly and jerkily through this section: \n1ST COP And you're not the boy's legal guardian? \nRUDY SR. I don't even know if that's my kid! \nJANIE They just showed up! We never seen them before... \nRUDY SR. I used to know his sister -- \nTERRY I just came down here to talk to the guy and all of a sudden he starts shovin' me! \n2ND COP Listen up. Listen up. You're gonna have to step back and just calm down -- \nTERRY (To RUDY SR.) You're a lyin' fuckin' piece of shit. \n2ND COP (To TERRY) You're gonna have to step back. \nJANIE We have a right to protect ourselves. What else do you need to know? \nA MOMENT LATER: The 2ND COP puts handcuffs on Terry. Rudy watches. \n2ND COP Now give me your right hand... \nTERRY This is such bullshit. He started the whole thing and you're arresting me? \n2ND COP Listen up. Now -- Listen up! Stop talkin'. Terry, stop talkin'. \nCUT TO: \nA MOMENT LATER: As the 3RD COP walks Rudy to one cop car, Rudy watches the 2ND COP guide the HANDCUFFED TERRY into the other car. \nRudy gets in the back of the car and looks out at RUDY SR. and JANIE talking to the 1ST COP. Rudy Sr. is looking at him over the 1st cop's shoulder. \n2ND COP -- idea where we might be able to contact his mother? \nRUDY SR. No, because he's not my Goddamn kid. \nThe cop cars' doors slam first on Terry and then on Rudy. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT \nThe room is dark. Sammy and Brian are asleep, half under the covers. SAMMY WAKES with a START. \nSAMMY What time is it? \nBRIAN (Startled awake) What's the matter? \nSammy looks at the clock radio. 9:20. \nSAMMY Oh my gosh. \nA FEW MOMENTS LATER: Sammy and Brian are on opposite sides of the bed, getting dressed. \nBrian walks through the morning bank activity and stops at Mabel's desk. \nBRIAN Anyone hear from Sammy this morning? \nMABEL I didn't. \nBRIAN Uh huh. Well, if anyone ever hears from her ever again, will you let me know? \nMABEL Yes. \nEXT. AUBURN POLICE STATION. DAY \nOn the steps of the police station, Sammy, Rudy and Bob wait as Sheriff Darryl shakes hands with the Auburn Sheriff. The Auburn Sheriff goes inside. Darryl comes over to Sammy. \nSHERIFF It's gonna be all right... We got on the phone and talked to Rudy Sr. a little bit and he's calmed down, just wants to forget about the whole thing... \nSAMMY Darryl, I really appreciate this... \nThe Sheriff nods, but he's not thrilled to be here. \nINT. SAMMY'S LIVING ROOM. DUSK \nThe PHONE IS RINGING. Sammy comes in the front door, Terry and Rudy behind her. She snaps on the lights, hurries to the phone and picks up. \nBehind her, Rudy goes upstairs and Terry plunks down on the sofa and turns on the TV. \nSAMMY Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH BRIAN, AT THE BANK. \nBRIAN Yeah, it's Brian. \nSAMMY Brian -- \nBRIAN What the hell happened to you today, lady? \nSAMMY is about to answer, but she just HANGS UP instead. \nBRIAN is stunned into sheer gaping fury. Feverishly he hangs up and dials again. It RINGS. \nSammy picks up. \nSAMMY Hello? \nBRIAN You're fired! \nSAMMY GOOD! \nShe hangs up again. \nINT. RUDY'S ROOM. NIGHT \nSammy is tucking Rudy into bed. \nSAMMY Rudy? \nRUDY Yeah? \nSAMMY Is there anything you want to ask me, about your father? \nRUDY Oh, that wasn't my father. \nSAMMY What? \nRUDY That wasn't him. I heard him tell the cops. \nSAMMY No -- Rudy -- that was him. But that was him. I wish it wasn't, but it was. \nRUDY (Very quiet) No it wasn't. \nSAMMY Rudy. Yes it was. Your father's name is Rudy Kolinski. He lives in Auburn... \nINT. HALLWAY. NIGHT \nSAMMY I didn't know if you left yet. \nTERRY No -- I'm leavin' tomorrow. \nSAMMY Well -- What time? \nTERRY There's a bus at nine. \nSAMMY Well -- Can I -- I'd like to see you before you go. I mean, can I give you a lift? Or do you want to have breakfast or anything? And I think Rudy would really like to say good- bye. \nTERRY Yeah -- I don't know... I mean -- \nSAMMY Terry, you can't just leave like this. I -- \nTERRY All right, all right. I'll come by in the morning. \nSAMMY All right -- But just -- We have to be out of the house by eight, so -- I don't want to tell Rudy you're coming unless you really think you can make it -- \nTERRY Yeah -- No -- I'll be there. \nSAMMY All right. \nTERRY All right. \nINT.

A MOMENT LATER \nSammy comes out and looks up and down the road. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nRudy sits in the living room in his baseball jacket. His knapsack is on the floor beside him. He looks at the CLOCK: 8:06. Sammy comes into the living room and looks at him. \nSAMMY Sweetie, I'm sorry, we have to go. \nRUDY Why can't I miss school one day? \nThey HEAR the PICKUP PULL UP OUTSIDE, O.C. Rudy gets up immediately. \nEXT. THE HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER \nTerry jumps out of RAY'S PICKUP. Sammy opens the front door and Rudy runs out toward Terry. \nRUDY Hi! \nTERRY Hey, how's it goin', man? \nRudy stops short in front of Terry. Terry looks at Sammy, in the doorway. \nTERRY Sorry I'm late. \nEXT./INT. CAR. DAY \nThe car stops across the street from the BUS. The LAST KIDS are getting in. SAMMY HONKS for the bus driver, and Sammy, Terry and Rudy all get out. \nTERRY So Rudy... If I write you a letter, will you write me back? \nRUDY Yeah. \nTERRY OK, well, that's gonna be pretty nice for you, because I write a pretty Goddamn interesting letter. \nRUDY Yeah, we'll see. \nTERRY All right. Well, say good-bye. \nRUDY Bye. \nRudy hugs Terry. Terry hugs him back. He is suddenly overcome and presses his lips to the top of Rudy's head. \n", "test1_input": "RUDY I won't. \nTERRY You know this used to be my room? \nRUDY Yeah... (Pause) Do you want it back? \nTERRY No. \nRudy is very relieved. Terry keeps reading. Rudy watches him. \nRUDY Did you fight in Vietnam? \nTERRY No. I wasn't even born yet. \nRUDY Were you ever in the army? \nTERRY No. \nRUDY My father was in the army. \nTERRY I know. Unfortunately he didn't fight in Vietnam either. \nRUDY Were you friends with him? \nTERRY Not really. We had some friends in common, I guess... I didn't like him very much. \nRUDY Why not? \nTERRY Well, he wasn't very likable. \nRUDY Why do you say that? \nTERRY I don't know. He was always -- He always had to be better than you at everything. You know. Like if you were all playing basketball or something, everybody's havin' like a friendly game and he's like ready to kill somebody if his team didn't win. Or like if you told like a joke or a story, he always had to tell a better one? Kinda gets annoying after a while. Plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you... He was a prick. Probably still a prick. Fortunately for you though, your mom is like, the greatest. So you had some bad luck and you had some good luck. (Pause) You mind if I ask you a personal question? \nRUDY I don't know. \nTERRY Do you like it here? I mean, in Scottsville? \nRUDY Yeah...? \nTERRY Why? \nRUDY I don't know. My friends are here... I like the scenery... I don't know. \nTERRY I know, I know, but it's so... There's nothing to do here. \nRUDY Yes there is. \nTERRY No there isn't, man! It's narrow. It's dull. It's a dull, narrow town full of dull, narrow people who don't know anything except... what things are like right around here. They have no perspective whatsoever. No scope. They might as well be living in the nineteenth century because they have no idea what's going on, and if you try to tell 'em that, they wanna fuckin' kill you. \nRUDY What are you talking about? \nTERRY I don't know... \nTerry lies on his back and smokes. \nTERRY You're a good kid. \nINT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. MORNING \nThere's a NOTE on Sammy's chair. \n\"SAMMY, PLEASE SEE ME -- BRIAN\" \nSammy, just arrived at work and still in her coat, looks down at the note. \nINT. BANK -- BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY \nSammy listens to Brian. \nBRIAN Yeah. This doesn't apply to you directly, Sammy, but I've noticed that some of the employees have their PC monitors set with all kinds of crazy colors... Purple and polka dots or what have you. And it's not a big deal, but really, this is a bank. You know? It's not really appropriate. So I'm just asking that people stick to a more quote unquote normal range of colors in future... \nSammy looks at him blankly. \n", "test1_true": "SAMMY No, my computer palette's pretty conservative. \nINT. BANK -- MABEL'S DESK. DAY \nMabel is typing angrily at a GRAY SCREEN with BLACK LETTERS. Sammy walks by. Mabel is so mad she doesn't even look up. \nINT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK.

NIGHT \nTerry is holding a broom looking up at the ceiling. Sammy passes by and stops. \nSAMMY What's up? \nTerry taps the broom handle against the ceiling. \nTERRY Do you know you have an enormous leak from the upstairs hall? \nHe pokes again. A portion of the ceiling collapses on his head in wet chunks of plaster and muck. \nSAMMY Um, yeah, thanks, I did. \nINT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT \nSammy, in front of the mirror, finishes dolling herself up for her date. O.C. we hear loud banging. Sammy puts on her earrings and goes into -- \nINT. HALL. CONTINUOUS \nSAMMY Are you guys sure you're gonna be OK? \nTERRY Yes. Yes. \nSammy approaches RUDY and TERRY. They are bent over a big nasty trench in the floorboard. There are wood shavings and greasy pipe segments all over, and black smeary smudges on the walls nearby. \nSAMMY What is happening here? \nTERRY It's just -- The problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall. So every time I put in a new piece it starts leaking further down. \nSAMMY Why don't I just call the plumber? \nTERRY Why? He's not gonna do anything different than what I'm doing. \nRUDY (Happily) Yeah. We're making it worse! \nTERRY No we're not. Shut up. \nTerry yanks the wrench and a SPRAY of FILTHY WATER comes out of the pipe and splatters the wallpaper and pictures and Sammy with gritty gray water. She looks at them. \nSAMMY Thank you. Thank you both. \nINT. HALLWAY. NIGHT \nBob and Sammy -- cleaned up and wearing a different outfit -- are bustling out the front door. Terry stands by. \nSAMMY Now, call if there's any problem, and if I'm not there, I'm either on my way or on my way back home. \nTERRY OK. \nSammy gets into her coat.

Mabel exchanges a quiet word with Chuck. \nINSIDE THE OFFICE: Brian has Sammy pressed against the wall with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their underwear out of the way. It's not so easy in their office clothes. Sammy tears away. \nSAMMY Brian, that's enough. \nBRIAN falls back, breathless. \nBRIAN OK. Sorry. \nHe lunges at her again. They kiss some more. \nOUTSIDE THE OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER: Sammy comes out of the office, more or less composed, carrying her folders. She heads down the hall past the other employees, including Mabel, and surreptitiously readjusts her scrunched-up underwear. \nINT. DAWSON'S. DAY \nSammy and Bob sit at lunch. Sammy is picking at her food. \nBOB You're awfully quiet. \nSAMMY I'm sorry. \nBOB Um... Have you thought at all about what I said? \nSAMMY Of course I've been thinking about it. \nBOB So... Any decisions? Or -- do you still want to think about it some more...? \nSAMMY Well -- I mean -- I don't know, Bob. I mean, we haven't exactly been going steady the last few months, if you know what I mean -- \nBOB Yeah, no, I know -- \nSAMMY -- and then we see each other twice and you suddenly say you want to get married? I mean... \nBOB No, you're right, you're right -- \nSAMMY What are you talking about? \nPause. \nBOB I don't know... I... Maybe this is... Last year I sort of thought you were possibly interested in that... idea... but I was the one who, you know, wasn't \"ready\" at that point -- So that's why I thought things kind of slowed down with us... \nSAMMY Don't make me feel bad for you. \nBOB (Bristling) I don't want you to feel bad for me. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nSammy, Terry and Rudy are all watching TV. Sammy and Rudy are in pajamas. Nobody's happy and nobody's talking. \nThe PHONE RINGS.

Where are you? \nEXT. GAS STATION. SIMULTANEOUS \nBrian is on the pay phone outside a gas station. \nBRIAN I'm buying milk. I just thought I'd say hello. \nWE CUT BETWEEN THEM.

It's personal. This is a personal matter that has to do with Mabel. I just have to go see her for a little while. \nTerry gives Sammy a look like, \"You've got to be kidding.\" Sammy tries to shush him with a conspiratorial look back. She goes out. \nLATER. Terry and Rudy sit in front of the TV, alone. \nTERRY Listen. Listen. I'm sorry I said you squealed on me. I was totally out of line, and I really owe you an apology.

And whatever might have passed between us after hours doesn't mean you just walk away from that commitment -- yeah, even when you have a legitimate family emergency. \nSAMMY I'm really sorry I didn't -- \nBRIAN Which is why I think in the calm cold light of day, we should both think real hard about whether or not you really want to continue on here at Merchants National Trust. \nSAMMY You're not serious. \nBRIAN ...you're not happy, I'm not happy, it's not good for you and it sure as heck isn't good for the bank. \nPause. \nSAMMY You know you're the worst manager we've ever had? \nBRIAN Come on, Sammy... \nSAMMY By far the worst. \nBRIAN ...I don't wanna trade insults with you. \nSAMMY Well, I don't want to be fired, Brian.

Are you not speaking to me? \nRudy doesn't answer. \nSAMMY Well, I'm sorry you're so mad at me, but I only did what I thought I had to do, and I hope you don't stay mad at me for the rest of your life. \nHe opens the maple syrup and pours it on the pancakes. \nSAMMY Rudy, that's too much. \nHe keeps pouring. She grabs the bottle from him and upsets some of the dishes on the table. \nSAMMY You gotta cut this out! \nRUDY What did I do? \nSAMMY You don't know what you're talking about! There was nothing else I could do! I can't explain it better than that, but you can't go on like this because you don't know anything about it and you don't know what you're doing! \nRUDY (Frightened) OK, I'm sorry! \nSAMMY I don't want you to be sorry, I just want you to STOP IT! \nRUDY I will! I will! I'm stopping, I'm sorry. \nHe comes around the table to her. \nRUDY See? I'm stopping! I'm not doing it. See? I'm not. \nHe's very alarmed. Sammy looks at him for a long moment. \nEXT. CEMETERY. DAY \nTerry walks through the little cemetery gate and makes his way up the hill through the tombstones. He reaches his parents' graves. He looks at the tombstones for a moment. He puts his hand on top of one headstone, then the other. \nHe sits down and smokes. He looks up at the SKY. It's a beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds. \nHe looks out over the hilly scenery. After a moment he shakes his head a few times. He doesn't even know he's doing it. He sits there. \nINT. RAY'S HOUSE. DAY \nThe PHONE IS RINGING as Terry walks into the house. He walks past it, to the fridge, gets a beer and opens it. It KEEPS RINGING. He picks it up. \nTERRY (Into phone) Ray's house. \nINT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY \nSammy is at her desk on the phone. \nSAMMY Hi. \nWE CUT BETWEEN THEM. Terry doesn't say anything. \n", "test3_id": 167}

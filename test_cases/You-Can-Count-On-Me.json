{"test1_input": "MABEL Guess who's been asking for you? \nSAMMY Oh no, really? \nMabel nods and passes by. \nSAMMY KNOCKS on a big door that says \"Manager\" and has half the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off it. \nBRIAN (Inside) Yeah, come in! \nSammy swings open the door. BRIAN EVERETT, the new branch manager, is unpacking a box. Sammy is surprised to see he is in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring. \nSAMMY Mr. Everett? \nBRIAN Yeah: Brian. \nSAMMY Brian. Hi. I'm Samantha Prescott -- I'm the lending officer? \nBRIAN Yeah, hi, how are you? Come on in. Sit down. \nSammy comes into the office and sits. \nSAMMY I am so sorry I was late... \nBRIAN Yeah, we missed you before... \nSAMMY I got held up. Believe me, it is not something I make a habit of... \nBRIAN I'm sure it's not. Actually -- could you just, could you close that door for me? Thanks. \nSammy gets up and closes the door. \nINT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. LATER \nSammy sits in front of Brian's desk. Brian is behind the desk listening. \nSAMMY -- so I always just run out at 3:15 to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter's house. Anyway, Larry never minded about it and I was just hoping it would be OK with you too... \nBRIAN Well -- Samantha -- I realize that Scottsville is not exactly a major banking center... \nSAMMY No it's not... \nBRIAN No -- I know it's not... But it's kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we'd be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state. And that means I don't want anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30, or whenever the bus happens to come in that day. Now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school? Does your husband work in the area? Do you -- \nSAMMY Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't \"on the scene.\" So to speak. \nBRIAN Well, I can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement, but... \nSAMMY Well -- Brian? I understand what you're saying, and I think it's great. I do. Because there's a lot of things around here that could use some attention. Believe me. But I've honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes, and if I take the time out of my lunch hour... \nBRIAN I'd really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement. OK? \nSAMMY (Brightly) I'll do my best...! \nBrian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his head. \nBRIAN How old's your son? \nSAMMY He's eight. \nBRIAN That's a terrific age. \nINT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DUSK \nSammy and Rudy drive home in silence. The orange sunlight flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive along. \nEXT. PRESCOTT (SAMMY'S) HOUSE. DUSK \nThe same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years' more wear on it. \nSammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail. \nINT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DUSK \n", "test1_true": "RUDY You got a letter from Uncle Terry. \nSAMMY What?! \nHer whole face lights up and she grabs the letter. She tears it open and reads it with growing excitement. \nINT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER \nSammy opens her FILE DRAWER. Inside are tax files, household files, miscellaneous files. \nShe puts Terry's letter away in a very full file marked \"Terry -- Correspondence.\" The folder is stuffed with other letters, on all different kinds of stationery from all over the country, all from Terry. \nINT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT \nSammy and Rudy are eating dinner. It's a biggish house for just two people. \nRUDY Whose room is he gonna stay in? \nSAMMY He can stay in the little room. (Pause) But you know what? He's not going to live here. He's only gonna stay for a little while... And it's OK if you don't remember him, because you were only six the last time he was here... But it'll be nice if you got a chance to get to know each other a little bit. Don't you think? \nRudy looks worried and doesn't answer. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. LATER \nRudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition notebook. Sammy comes downstairs. \nSAMMY Rudy? Would it distract you if I put on some music? \nRUDY No. \nShe puts on a CD, sits down and picks up a book. She looks at Rudy, who is writing away. \nSAMMY Did you think of a story? \nRUDY Uh huh. \nSAMMY What's it about? \nRUDY My father. \nPause. \nSAMMY What about your father? \nRUDY It's just a made-up story about him. \nSAMMY Can I read it when you're done? \nRUDY It's not very good. \nSAMMY Don't say that. \nRudy keeps writing. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. LATER \nSammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine and reading Rudy's story. It upsets her. \nINT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER \nSammy sits on the edge of her bed, not dialing the phone. She catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor-length mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame. Against her better judgment she picks up the phone and dials. \nINT. DAWSON'S GRILL. NIGHT \nSammy and BOB STEEGERSON are eating dinner at Dawson's, the only fancy restaurant in town. Bob is in his mid-thirties, a Realtor, a decent, ordinary guy. \nSAMMY Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this adventure story, and Rudy's father is this secret agent or something, working for the government... And it just made me feel weird. You know? Because I never really say much to him about Rudy Sr., because I don't know what to say. And I don't know whether I should just let him imagine whatever he wants to imagine, or whether I should sit him down sometime and tell him, you know, that his father is not such a nice person. You know? \nBOB Well... I don't know, Sammy. What have you told him already? \nSAMMY Not much. He knows I don't have the highest opinion of him. And he knows I don't want to see him or know anything about him, ever. But I tried to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway... I could go into a lot more detail, believe me. \nBOB Well... It's an interesting problem. But I don't really know what to tell you... It's a little outside my personal field of expertise... \n", "test1_id": 165, "test2_input": "TERRY (Into phone) When?... Well -- Is she all right?... Well, could I talk to her?... Well, could you give her a message that I -- \nCLICK. He is hung up on. He slowly HANGS UP. \nSammy notices that something's wrong. He looks at her from across the room. \nTERRY That girl I'm with tried to kill herself. \nSAMMY What? \nTERRY She tried to kill herself. \nINT. TERRY'S ROOM. NIGHT \nTerry is sitting on the bed, addressing an envelope to SHEILA. He puts the $300 in the ENVELOPE and seals it. He sees Sammy standing in the doorway. He starts to unlace his boots. \nSAMMY Do you have everything you need? \nTERRY I think so. \nSammy comes into the room and sits next to him. He is very busy with his laces. \nSAMMY What are you going to do? \nTERRY I don't know. Send the money I guess. \nSAMMY Maybe you should stay home for a little while, Terry. \nTERRY Yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea. \nHe starts crying. Sammy pats him. \nEXT. SCOTTSVILLE CHURCH. DAY \nA bright, clear, blue-skied Sunday morning in Scottsville. Inside the little white church they're singing. \nEXT. CHURCH. DAY \nPeople are filing out of the church. We also see a couple of the bank employees, including BRIAN and his very pretty six months' PREGNANT wife, NANCY. We find SAMMY and RUDY. Sammy is chatting to some neighbors. Rudy is bored out of his mind, waiting for her. \nINT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY \nTerry is lying on the sofa, smoking, with his feet up and boots on, watching Sunday morning TV. On the coffee table are his dirty ashtray, dirty bowl and spoon, Rice Krispies box and a milk carton. \nEXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT \nCrickets buzz loudly outside the house. \nINT. STAIRS. NIGHT \nSammy, in her bathrobe, comes down the stairs into the living room. Terry is on the sofa playing with Rudy's Game Boy. He barely looks up when she speaks to him. \nSAMMY I'm going to bed. Do you have everything you need? \nTERRY Yeah. Thanks. \nSAMMY Good night. \nTERRY Good night. \nPause. \nSAMMY Terry, I'm really glad you're home. \nTerry tries to smile at her. \nTERRY Yeah, me too, Sammy. \nHe goes back to his game. She hesitates, then heads back up the stairs. \nINT. SAMMY'S KITCHEN. DAY \nSammy, Terry and Rudy sit at the kitchen table. Sammy is dressed for work. Rudy is dressed for school. Terry is also fully dressed, drinking the last dregs of a mug of coffee. He is tired, but listening to Sammy very carefully, as if receiving difficult and critical instructions. \n", "test2_true": "TERRY OK. \nSAMMY Rudy knows where she lives. \nTerry glances at Rudy, then back at Sammy. \nTERRY OK. \nINT. BANK -- MABEL'S DESK. DAY \nSammy walks past MABEL'S DESK, carrying a big stack of files. She drops three of them on the desk. MABEL is typing away at her PC. The colors are a garish PURPLE background with GREEN letters. \nSAMMY God, Mabel, don't those colors hurt your eyes? \nMABEL Oh no, they keep me fresh. \nSammy proceeds down the hall and into -- \nINT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY \nBrian is at his desk, busy working between stacks of papers. She knocks on the open door. \nBRIAN Yeah! (Looks up) Hi, Sammy. What can I do for you? \nSAMMY Um, Brian? Did you want us to turn this time sheet in at the end of the day, or do you want it at the end of the week...? \nBRIAN Oh, yeah, end of the day'll be fine. \nSAMMY Seems like an awful lot of extra paperwork... \nBrian hesitates, shrugs and smiles. \nBRIAN I like paperwork. \nSammy looks at him with a blank smile. \nINT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. A MOMENT LATER \nSammy sits down at her desk and notices the time: 3:30. She reaches for the phone, then decides not to call. \nEXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY \nThe CLOCK on the front of the TOWN HALL reads 3:31. \nThe SCHOOL BUS pulls up across from the town hall and disgorges a handful of kids. Rudy comes out with his knapsack, looking around... \nPOV RUDY: Terry, across the street, sits on the hood of Sammy's car, smoking. \nRudy walks over to him. \nRUDY You showed up. \nTERRY Looks that way. \nINT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY \nTerry and Rudy drive in silence. Terry glances at Rudy. \nTERRY Put on your seat belt. \nRUDY It pushes on my neck. \nTERRY What? \nRUDY It pushes on my neck. It's uncomfortable. \nTERRY Well, when somebody slams into us and you go sailin' through the windshield, that's liable to be uncomfortable too. So put on your seat belt. \nRudy puts on his seat belt. \nRUDY Mom's parents died in a car accident. \nTERRY I know. They're my parents too. \n", "test2_id": 166, "test3_input": "Sammy is flipping channels on the TV. The DOORBELL RINGS. She is surprised. She gets up. Terry comes thundering down the stairs, carrying his backpack. \nSAMMY Is that for you? \nTERRY Yeah, I'm just gonna stay at Ray's till I take off. \nSAMMY You don't have to do that. \nTERRY Yeah. Well, that's what I wanna do, so -- \nSAMMY Well but -- Are you gonna come back to say good-bye? \nTERRY No -- I'm just gonna take off. I'll see you later. \nSAMMY Well -- \nTerry opens the door. RAY is there. Terry closes the door behind him. Sammy listens to the PICKUP TRUCK DRIVE OFF. The sound FADES. \nINT. RAY'S HOUSE. NIGHT \nTerry is bunked down on Ray's horrible sofa. In the b.g., there is a light on in the bedroom. Terry fluffs his pillow and shuts his eyes. \nEXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DAY \nDressed for work and school, Sammy and Rudy walk to the car. \nSAMMY Look. I know you're upset about Uncle Terry leaving, and so am I. But he's just not in control of himself, and I don't want him hurting your feelings anymore -- or mine. And you may not like it, but that's how it's gotta be. OK? \nRUDY I don't care. \nSAMMY You don't care. I don't care either. \nINT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY \nSammy sits in front of Brian's desk. \nBRIAN Well... I'm sorry you're havin' all this trouble... \nSAMMY Thank you. \nBRIAN But you made a pretty good speech to me yesterday about people sticking to their commitments... \nSAMMY Yeah...? \nBRIAN Well... you made a commitment to this bank, Sammy. To this job. \nSAMMY I know I'd -- \nBRIAN And to working things out with this tough new son of a bitch boss of yours. And whatever might have passed between us after hours doesn't mean you just walk away from that commitment -- yeah, even when you have a legitimate family emergency. \nSAMMY I'm really sorry I didn't -- \nBRIAN Which is why I think in the calm cold light of day, we should both think real hard about whether or not you really want to continue on here at Merchants National Trust. \nSAMMY You're not serious. \nBRIAN ...you're not happy, I'm not happy, it's not good for you and it sure as heck isn't good for the bank. \nPause. \nSAMMY You know you're the worst manager we've ever had? \nBRIAN Come on, Sammy... \nSAMMY By far the worst. \nBRIAN ...I don't wanna trade insults with you. \nSAMMY Well, I don't want to be fired, Brian. I've been working here for seven years. \nBRIAN Well -- \nSAMMY And if I were you I'd be a little nervous about firing an employee I just had an affair with. OK? \n", "test3_true": "SAMMY I'm not thr -- You explore it. I'm going back to work. \nShe heads for the door, stops. \nSAMMY Oh, and I have to pick up Rudy today because there's no one else to do it. But I'll find someone as soon as I have time. \nBRIAN Yeah. Fine. Why don't you just take over the whole bank? \nSammy hesitates in the doorway. This thought has never occurred to her before. She goes out. \nINT. LUNCH PLACE. DAY \nTHROUGH THE WINDOW we see Sammy and Bob having lunch. Sammy watches him eat, full of mixed feelings about him. \nINT. KITCHEN. DAY \nSammy is at the stove, making pancakes. She puts a last pancake onto Rudy's plate and brings it to him. \nSAMMY Well, I called where Uncle Terry said he was gonna stay, and there was no answer, so I don't know if he's still in town or not. \nRudy doesn't answer. \nSAMMY Rudy? Are you not speaking to me? \nRudy doesn't answer. \nSAMMY Well, I'm sorry you're so mad at me, but I only did what I thought I had to do, and I hope you don't stay mad at me for the rest of your life. \nHe opens the maple syrup and pours it on the pancakes. \nSAMMY Rudy, that's too much. \nHe keeps pouring. She grabs the bottle from him and upsets some of the dishes on the table. \nSAMMY You gotta cut this out! \nRUDY What did I do? \nSAMMY You don't know what you're talking about! There was nothing else I could do! I can't explain it better than that, but you can't go on like this because you don't know anything about it and you don't know what you're doing! \nRUDY (Frightened) OK, I'm sorry! \nSAMMY I don't want you to be sorry, I just want you to STOP IT! \nRUDY I will! I will! I'm stopping, I'm sorry. \nHe comes around the table to her. \nRUDY See? I'm stopping! I'm not doing it. See? I'm not. \nHe's very alarmed. Sammy looks at him for a long moment. \nEXT. CEMETERY. DAY \nTerry walks through the little cemetery gate and makes his way up the hill through the tombstones. He reaches his parents' graves. He looks at the tombstones for a moment. He puts his hand on top of one headstone, then the other. \nHe sits down and smokes. He looks up at the SKY. It's a beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds. \nHe looks out over the hilly scenery. After a moment he shakes his head a few times. He doesn't even know he's doing it. He sits there. \nINT. RAY'S HOUSE. DAY \nThe PHONE IS RINGING as Terry walks into the house. He walks past it, to the fridge, gets a beer and opens it. It KEEPS RINGING. He picks it up. \nTERRY (Into phone) Ray's house. \nINT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY \nSammy is at her desk on the phone. \nSAMMY Hi. \nWE CUT BETWEEN THEM.

{"test1_input": "NEFF Sure he signed it. You saw him. \nPhyllis opens the door a crack. Both look at the stairs, where Dietrichson is going up. Phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm. \nNEFF (Looking up) Watch it, will you. \nPhyllis slowly drops her hand from his arm. Both look up as Dietrichson goes across the balcony and out of sight. \nNEFF Listen. That trip to Palo Alto When does he go? \nPHYLLIS End of the month. \nNEFF He drives, huh? \nPHYLLIS He always drives. \nNEFF Not this time. You're going to make him take the train. \nPHYLLIS Why? \nNEFF Because it's all worked out for a train. \nFor a second they stand listening and looking up as if they had heard a sound. \nPHYLLIS It's all right. Go on, Walter. \nNEFF Look, baby. There's a clause in every accident policy, a little something called double indemnity. The insurance companies put it in as a sort of come-on for the customers. It means they pay double on certain accidents. The kind that almost never happen. Like for instance if a guy got killed on a train, they'd pay a hundred thousand instead of fifty. \nPHYLLIS I see. (Her eyes widen with excitement) \nNEFF We're hitting it for the limit, baby. That's why it's got to be a train. \nPHYLLIS It's going to be a train, Walter. Just the way you say. Straight down the line. \nThey look at each other. The look is like a long kiss. Neff goes out. Slowly Phyllis closes the door and leans her head against it as she looks up the empty stairway. \nB-4 EXT. DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT) \nNeff, briefcase under his arm, comes down the steps to the street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens the door and stops, looking in. \nSitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the steering wheel, is Lola. She wears a coat but no hat. \nLOLA Hello, Mr. Neff. It's me. \nLola gives him a sly smile. Neff is a little annoyed. \nNEFF Something the matter? \nLOLA I've been waiting for you. \nNEFF For me? What for? \nLOLA I thought you could let me ride with you, if you're going my way. \nNeff doesn't like the idea very much. \nNEFF Which way would that be? \nLOLA Down the hill. Down Vermont. \nNEFF (Remembering) Oh, sure. Vermont and Franklin. North- west corner, wasn't it? Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson. \nNeff gets into the car. \nB-5 INT. COUPE - (NIGHT) - (TRANSPARENCY) \nNeff puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the driver's seat. He closes the door and starts the car. They drift down the hill. \nNEFF Roller skating, eh? You like roller skating? \nLOLA I can take it or leave it. \nNeff looks at her curiously. Lola meets his glance. \nNEFF Only tonight you're leaving it? \nThis is an embarrassing moment for Lola. \nLOLA Yes, I am. You see, Mr. Neff, I'm having a very tough time at home. My father doesn't understand me and Phyllis hates me. \nNEFF That does sound tough, all right. \nLOLA That's why I have to lie sometimes. \nNEFF You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin. \nLOLA It's Vermont and Franklin all right. Only it's not Anne Matthews. It's Nino Zachetti. You won't tell on me, will you? \n", "test1_true": "LOLA Nino's not what my father says at all. He just had bad luck. He was doing pre-med at U.S.C. and working nights as an usher in a theater downtown. He got behind in his credits and flunked out. Then he lost his job for talking back. He's so hot- headed. \nNEFF That comes expensive, doesn't it? \nLOLA I guess my father thinks nobody's good enough for his daughter except maybe the guy that owns Standard Oil. Would you like a stick of gum? \nNEFF Never use it, thanks. \nLola puts a stick of gum in her mouth. \nLOLA I can't give Nino up. I wish father could see it my way. \nNEFF It'll straighten out all right, Miss Dietrichson. \nLOLA I suppose it will sometime. (Looking out) This is the corner right here, Mr. Neff. \nNeff brings the car to a stop by the curb. \nLOLA There he is. By the bus stop. \nNeff looks out. \nB-6 CORNER VERMONT AND FRANKLIN - (NIGHT) \nZachetti stands waiting, hands in trouser pockets. He is about twenty-five, Italian looking, open shirt, not well dressed. \nB-7 INT. COUPE - (NIGHT) - LOLA AND NEFF \nLOLA He needs a hair-cut, doesn't he. Look at him. No job, no car, no money, no prospects, no nothing. (Pause) I love him. \nShe leans over and honks on the horn. \nLOLA (Calling) Nino! \nB-8 ZACHETTI \nHe turns around and looks towards the car. \nLOLA'S VOICE Over here, Nino. \nZachetti walks towards the car. \nB-9 THE COUPE \nNeff and Lola. She has opened the door. Zachetti comes up. \nLOLA This is Mr. Neff, Nino. \nNEFF Hello, Nino. \nZACHETTI (Belligerent from the first word) The name is Zachetti. \nLOLA Nino. Please. Mr. Neff gave me a ride from the house. I told him all about us. \nZACHETTI Why does he have to get told about us? \nLOLA We don't have to worry about Mr. Neff, Nino. \nZACHETTI I'm not doing any worrying. Just don't you broadcast so much. \nLOLA What's the matter with you, Nino? He's a friend. \nZACHETTI I don't have any friends. And if I did, I like to pick them myself. \nNEFF Look, sonny, she needed the ride and I brought her along. Is that anything to get tough about? \nZACHETTI All right, Lola, make up your mind. Are you coming or aren't you? \nLOLA Of course I'm coming. Don't mind him, Mr. Neff. \nLola steps out of the car. \nLOLA Thanks a lot. You've been very sweet. \nLola catches up with Zachetti and they walk away together. \nB-10 INT. COUPE \nNeff looks after them. Slowly he puts the car in gear and drives on. His face is tight. Behind his head, light catches the metal of the zipper on the briefcase. Over the shot comes the COMMENTARY: \nNEFF'S VOICE She was a nice kid and maybe he was a little better than he sounded. I kind of hoped so for her sake, but right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all, with that briefcase right behind my head and her father's application in it. Besides, I had other problems to work out. There were plans to make, and Phyllis had to be in on them... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nB-11 EXT. SUPER MARKET - (DAY) \nThere is a fair amount of activity but the place is not crowded. Neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot. He passes in front of the fruit and vegetable display and goes between the stalls into the market. \n", "test1_id": 1074, "test2_input": "NORTON -- that just because a man has a large office he must be an idiot. I'm having a visitor, if you don't mind. \nKeyes and Neff start to get up. \nNORTON No, no. I want you to stay and watch me handle this. \nThe secretary has opened the door. \nSECRETARY Mrs. Dietrichson. \nNeff stands staring at the door. He relaxes with an obvious effort of will. Phyllis comes in. She wears a gray tailored suit, small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carries a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr. Norton goes to meet her. \nNORTON Thank you very much for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson. I assure you I appreciate it. \nHe turns a little towards Keyes. \nNORTON This is Mr. Keyes. \nKEYES How do you do. \nPHYLLIS How do you do. \nNORTON And Mr. Neff. \nPHYLLIS I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do. \nNorton has placed a chair. Phyllis sits. Norton goes behind his desk. \nNORTON Mrs. Dietrichson, I assure you of our sympathy in your bereavement. I hesitated before asking you to come here so soon after your loss. \nPhyllis nods silently. \nNORTON But now that you're here I hope you won't mind if I plunge straight into business. You know why we asked you to come, don't you? \nPHYLLIS No. All I know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent. \nKeyes sits quietly in his chair with his legs crossed. He has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in the armholes of his vest. He looks a little bored. Neff, behind him, stands leaning against the false mantel, completely dead-pan. \nNORTON Your husband had an accident policy with this company. Evidently you don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson. \nPHYLLIS No. I remember some talk at the house -- \nShe looks towards Neff. \nPHYLLIS -- but he didn't seem to want it. \nNEFF He took it out a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson. \nPHYLLIS I see. \nNORTON You'll probably find the policy among his personal effects. \nPHYLLIS His safe deposit box hasn't been opened yet. It seems a tax examiner has to be present. \nNORTON Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't want you to think you are being subjected to any questioning. But there are a few things we should like to know. \nPHYLLIS What sort of things? \nNORTON We have the report of the coroner's inquest. Accidental death. We are not entirely satisfied. In fact we are not satisfied at all. \nPhyllis looks at him coolly. \nKeyes looks vaguely interested. \nNeff is staring straight at Phyllis. \nNORTON Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect suicide. \nPhyllis doesn't bat an eyelash. \nNORTON I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water? \nPHYLLIS Please. \nNORTON Mr. Neff. \nHe indicates a thermos on a stand near Neff. Neff pours a glass of water and carries it over to Phyllis. She has lifted her veil a little. She takes the glass from his hand. \nPHYLLIS Thank you. \nTheir eyes meet for a fraction of a second. \nNORTON Had your husband been moody or depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson? Did he seem to have financial worries, for instance? \nPHYLLIS He was perfectly all right and I don't know of any financial worries. \nNORTON There must have been something, Mrs. Dietrichson. Let us examine this so- called accident. First, your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy. Why? Because he doesn't want his family to suspect what he intends to do. \n", "test2_true": "NORTON Commit suicide. Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone. He has to be alone. He hobbles all the way out to the observation platform, very unlikely with his leg in a cast, unless he has a very strong reason. Once there, he finds he is not alone. There is a man there. What was his name, Keyes? \nNorton flips his fingers impatiently at Keyes who doesn't even bother to look up. \nKEYES His name was Jackson. Probably still is. \nNORTON Jackson. So your husband gets rid of this Jackson with some flimsy excuse about cigars. And then he is alone. And then he does it. He jumps. Suicide. In which case the company is not liable. (Pause) You know that, of course. We could go to court -- \nPHYLLIS I don't know anything. In fact I don't know why I came here. \nShe makes as if to rise indignantly. \nNORTON Just a moment, please. I said we could go to court. I didn't say we want to. Not only is it against our practice, but it would involve a great deal of expense, a lot of lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years. \nPhyllis rises coldly. \nNORTON So what I want to suggest is a compromise on both sides. A settlement for a certain sum, a part of the policy value -- \nPHYLLIS Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in here I had no idea you owed me any money. You told me you did. Then you told me you didn't. Now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it, whatever it is. You want to bargain with me, at a time like this. I don't like your insinuations about my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't like your methods. In fact I don't like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen. \nShe turns and walks out. The door closes after her. There is a pregnant pause. Keyes straightens up in his chair. \nKEYES Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure carried that ball. \nNorton pours himself a glass of water and stands holding it. \nKEYES Only you fumbled on the goal line. Then you heaved an illegal forward pass and got thrown for a forty-yard loss. Now you can't pick yourself up because you haven't got a leg to stand on. \nNORTON I haven't eh? Let her claim. Let her sue. We can prove it was suicide. \nKeyes stands up. \nKEYES Can we? Mr. Norton, the first thing that hit me was that suicide angle. Only I dropped it in the wastepaper basket just three seconds later. You ought to take a look at the statistics on suicide sometime. You might learn a little something about the insurance business. \nNORTON I was raised in the insurance business, Mr. Keyes. \nKEYES Yeah. In the front office. Come on, you never read an actuarial table in your life. I've got ten volumes on suicide alone. Suicide by race, by color, by occupation, by sex, by seasons of the year, by time of day. Suicide, how committed: by poisons, by fire-arms, by drowning, by leaps. Suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison, such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, alkaloid, protein, and so forth. Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places, under wheels of trains, under wheels of trucks, under the feet of horses, from steamboats. But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on record there's not one single case of suicide by leap from the rear end of a moving train. And do you know how fast that train was going at the point where the body was found? Fifteen miles an hour. Now how could anybody jump off a slow moving train like that with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself? No soap, Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we're going to pay through the nose, and you know it. May I have this? \nKeyes' throat is dry after the long speech. He grabs the glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big gulp. \nNorton is watching him almost stupefied. Neff stands with the shadow of a smile on his face. Keyes puts the glass down noisily on Norton's desk. \nKEYES Come on, Walter. \nNorton doesn't move or speak. Keyes puts his hat on and crosses towards the door, Neff after him. With the doorknob in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at his own shirt sleeves. \nKEYES Next time I'll rent a tuxedo. \nThey go out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nC-5 NEFF - AT DICTAPHONE - (NIGHT) \nThere is a tired grin on his face as he talks into the horn. \nNEFF I could have hugged you right then and there, Keyes, you and your statistics. You were the only one we were really scared of, and instead you were almost playing on our team... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nC-6 NEFF'S APARTMENT - EVENING - ALMOST DARK IN THE ROOM \nThe corridor door opens letting light in. Neff enters with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the door, puts the key in his pocket. At this moment the telephone rings. He picks up the phone. \nNEFF'S VOICE That evening when I got home my nerves had eased off. I could feel the ground under my feet again, and it looked like easy going from there on it. \nNEFF Hello... Hello, baby.... Sure, everything is fine... You were wonderful in Norton's office. \nC-7 INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH IN A DRUG STORE \nPhyllis is on the phone. She is not dressed as in Norton's office. \nPHYLLIS I felt so funny. I wanted to look at you all the time. \nC-8 NEFF ON TELEPHONE IN HIS APARTMENT \nNEFF How do you think I felt? Where are you, baby? \nC-9 PHYLLIS ON PHONE \nPHYLLIS At the drug store. Just a block away. Can I come up? \nC-10 NEFF'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT) - NEFF ON PHONE \nNEFF Okay. But be careful. Don't let anybody see you. \nHe hangs up, takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase on the davenport. He looks around the room and crosses to lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste-paper basket. \n", "test2_id": 1075, "test3_input": "NEFF I wanted to straighten out that Dietrichson story for you. \nKEYES So I gather. \nNEFF How long have you been standing there? \nKEYES Long enough. \nNEFF Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it. One you didn't quite figure out. \nKEYES You can't figure them all, Walter. \nNEFF That's right. You can't, can you? And now I suppose I get the big speech, the one with all the two- dollar words in it. Let's have it, Keyes. \nKEYES You're all washed up, Walter. \nNEFF Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway. \nThey stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse. \nKEYES Walter, I'm going to call a doctor. \nNEFF (Bitterly) What for? So they can patch me up? So they can nurse me along till I'm back on my feet? So I can walk under my own power into that gas chamber up in San Quentin? Is that it, Keyes? \nKEYES Something like that, Walter. \nNEFF Well, I've got a different idea. Look here. Suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders till tomorrow morning, when the office opens. From then on you can play it any way you like. Would you do that much for me, Keyes? \nKEYES Give me one good reason. \nNEFF I need four hours to get where I'm going. \nKEYES You're not going anywhere, Walter. \nNEFF You bet I am. I'm going across the border. \nKEYES You haven't got a chance. \nNEFF Good enough to try for. \nKEYES You'll never make the border. \nNEFF That's what you think. Watch me. \nNeff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, holding himself upright with great effort. \nKEYES (In a voice of stony calm) You'll never even make the elevator. \nNeff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable face. \nNEFF So long, Keyes. \nNeff goes out, leaving the door wide open. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR LOBBY. The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that for a moment it dominates the scene. Finally he reaches the swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them open. At this moment he collapses. He clutches the edge of the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the floor. He tries to struggle up but cannot rise. \nIn background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed. \nKEYES' VOICE Hello... Send an ambulance to the Pacific Building on Olive Street... Yeah... It's a police job. \nThere is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. Then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony and Keyes walks slowly into the shot. He kneels down beside Neff. \nKEYES How you doing, Walter? \nNeff manages a faint smile. \nNEFF I'm fine. Only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away. \nKEYES They're on the way. \nNEFF (Slowly and with great difficulty) You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy you were looking for was too close. He was right across the desk from you. \nKEYES Closer than that, Walter. \nThe eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence. \nNEFF I love you too. \nNeff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it. The handkerchief drops from his hand. He gets a loose cigarette out of his pocket and puts it between his lips. Then with great difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is too weak. Keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it for him and lights his cigarette. \nFADE OUT: \nTHE END \nThe following pages are for an alternate ending that director Billy Wilder actually shot but later decided against. \nKEYES They're on the way. \nNEFF (Slowly and with great difficulty) You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy you were looking for was too close. He was right across the desk from you. \n", "test3_true": "The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence. \nNEFF I love you too. \nNeff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it. Then, clutching the handkerchief against his shoulder, he speaks to Keyes for the last time. \nNEFF At the end of that... trolley line... just as I get off... you be there... to say goodbye... will you, Keyes? \nFADE OUT: \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"D\" \nSEQUENCE \"E\" \nFADE IN: \nE-1 WITNESS ROOM IN DEATH CHAMBER - SAN QUENTIN (DAY) \nShowing the witness room and approximately one-half of the gas chamber. BOOM SHOT towards guard standing BACK TO CAMERA at entrance door. Except for this guard the room is empty. \nGuard opens the door. Two other guards enter, followed by a group of witnesses and newspaper men, each of whom removes his hat as he enters the room. They form a group around the outside of the gas chamber, some looking in through the glass windows, some standing in the background on low platforms against the wall. \nTHE CAMERA SLOWLY BEGINS TO MOVE IN AND DOWN, AND CENTERS ON Keyes, as he enters the room and stands behind the door. His face is seen through the bars of the door, which is then closed, and CAMERA MOVES TO A CLOSEUP. His eyes follow the action of the closing door, then slowly look towards the gas chamber. \nE-2 THE GAS CHAMBER, EMPTY \nOn its windows show reflections of the spectators, including the face of Keyes. \nThe door to the gas chamber opens in the background, and beyond that another door opens. Neff comes in between two guards. He is wearing a white open-necked shirt, blue denim pants, and walks barefooted on a cocoanut matting. He moves into the gas chamber, looks through the windows in the direction of Keyes and nods quickly, recognizing him. The guards turn him around and seat him in one of the two metal chairs, with his back to the witnesses. They strap his arms, legs and body to the chair. The guards go out. \nE-3 THE DOOR TO THE GAS CHAMBER \nIt is open. The three guards come out of the gas chamber into the ante-chamber, where stand the warden, executioner, two doctors, the minister and the acid man, and possibly several guards. \nThe executioner and one guard close the door. The guard spins the big wheel which tightens it. The wheel at first turns very quickly, then, as it tightens, the guard uses considerable force to seal the chamber tight. The guard steps out of the shot. The gas chamber is now sealed. \nE-4 THE WITNESSES AND KEYES \nThey are intently watching Neff in the gas chamber. \nE-5 THE ANTE-CHAMBER \nThe warden looks slowly around the room, sees that everyone is in his proper place and that the stethoscope, which one doctor holds, is connected with the outlet in the wall of the gas chamber. Also that the man in charge of the acid is ready. The warden makes a motion to the acid man. The acid man releases the mixed acid into a pipe connecting with a countersunk receptacle under Neff's chair. (This action is only suggested). The warden looks at the clock, then turns to the executioner and nods. \nE-6 THE EXECUTIONER - MED. SHOT - CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN FROM HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS EXECUTIONER \nHe pushes a metal lever. (This immerses the pellets of cyanide in the acid under the chair.) \nE-7 INT. GAS CHAMBER - MED. SHOT \nCAMERA IS SHOOTING ABOVE Neff's head (just out of shot), towards spectators standing outside the gas chamber, Keyes in the center. Gas floats up into scene between CAMERA and spectators. Keyes, unable to watch, looks away. \nE-8 THE FIRST DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT \nas he listens on stethoscope connected with the gas chamber. He glances at the clock above his head. \nE-9 THE SECOND DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT \nHe stands to right of the gas chamber door, taking notes on a pad. He glances towards First Doctor (out of scene) and looks through venetian blinds into the gas chamber. The acid man stands near him. \nE-10 THE FIRST DOCTOR \nCAMERA SHOOTING FROM HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS HIM as he listens on stethoscope. The doctor glances at the clock again. He takes his stethoscope from his ears. He nods to the warden, This indicates that the man is dead. CAMERA PANS with warden as he turns to open the door connecting the ante-chamber with the witness room. \nE-11 THE WITNESS ROOM - LONG SHOT FROM HIGH ON BOOM DOWN ON WITNESSES GROUPED AROUND GAS CHAMBER \nThe door connecting with the ante-chamber opens. A guard comes through. \nGUARD That's all, gentlemen, Vacate the chamber, please. \nThe guard withdraws and closes the door by which he entered. The witnesses slowly start to file out. A guard has opened the outer door. The witnesses put their hats on as they pass through. A few go close to the windows of the gas chamber to look in at the dead man before they leave. \nAll the witnesses have now left, except Keyes, who stands, shocked and tragic, beyond the door. The guard goes to him and touches his arm, indicating to him that he must leave. Keyes glances for the last time towards the gas chamber and slowly moves to go out. \nE-12 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE DEATH CHAMBER \nCAMERA SHOOTING IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AT KEYES, who is just turning to leave. Keyes comes slowly out into the dark, narrow corridor. His hat is on his head now, his overcoat is pulled around him loosely. He walks like an old man. He takes eight or ten steps, then mechanically reaches a cigar out of his vest pocket and puts it in his mouth. His hands, in the now familiar gesture, begin to pat his pockets for matches. \nSuddenly he stops, with a look of horror on his face. He stands rigid, pressing a hand against his heart. He takes the cigar out of his mouth and goes slowly on towards the door, CAMERA PANNING with him. When he has almost reached the door, the guard stationed there throws it wide, and a blaze of sunlight comes in from the prison yard outside. \nKeyes slowly walks out into the sunshine. stiffly, his head bent, a forlorn and lonely man. \nFADE OUT: \nTHE END \nDouble Indemnity Writers : \u00a0\u00a0James M.

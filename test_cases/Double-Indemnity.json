{"train": "\"DOUBLE INDEMNITY\" \nScreenplay by \nBilly Wilder and Raymond Chandler \nBased on the novel \n\"Double Indemnity In Three Of A Kind\" \nby \nJames M. Cain \nCHARACTERS \nWALTER NEFF PHYLLIS DIETRICHSON BARTON KEYES LOLA DIETRICHSON MR. DIETRICHSON NINO ZACHETTI MR. NORTON MR. JACKSON SAM GORLOPIS \nSEQUENCE \"A\" \nFADE IN: \nA-1 LOS ANGELES - A DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION \nIt is night, about two o'clock, very light traffic. \nAt the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore traffic signal stands at GO. Approaching it at about thirty miles per hour is a Dodge 1938 coupe. It is driven erratically and weaving a little, but not out of control. \nWhen the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to STOP. Car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through. \nA-2 A LIGHT NEWSPAPER TRUCK \nis crossing the intersection at right angles. It swerves and skids to avoid the Dodge, which goes on as though nothing had happened. The truck stops with a panicky screech of tires. There is a large sign on the truck: \"READ THE LOS ANGELES TIMES\". The truck driver's infuriated face stares after the coupe. \nA-3 THE COUPE \ncontinues along the street, still weaving, then slows down and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office building. \nA-4 THE COUPE \nstops. The headlights are turned off. For a second nothing happens, then the car door opens slowly. A man eases himself out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the open door to support himself. He's a tall man, about thirty- five years old. From the way he moves there seems to be something wrong with his left shoulder. \nHe straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into his jacket pocket. He leans into the car. He brings out a light-weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. He shuts the car door and walks toward the building. \nA-5 ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING \nAbove the closed, double-plate glass doors is lettered: \"PACIFIC BUILDING\". To the left of entrance there is a drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back. The man comes stiffly up to the doors. (CAMERA HAS MOVED UP WITH HIM). He tries the doors. They are locked. He knocks on the glass. Inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. One elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark lobby. \nThe man knocks again. The night watchman sticks his head out of the elevator and looks toward entrance. He comes out with a newspaper in one hand and a half-eaten sandwich in the other. He finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors, looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door and pulls it open. \nNIGHT WATCHMAN Hello there, Mr. Neff. \nNeff walks in past him without answering. \nA-6 INT. LOBBY \nNeff is walking towards elevator. Night watchman looks after him, relocks door, follows to elevator. Neff enters elevator. \nA-7 ELEVATOR \nNeff stands leaning against wall. He is pale and haggard with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him. \nNIGHT WATCHMAN Working pretty late aren't you, Mr. Neff? \nNEFF (Tight-lipped) Late enough. \nNIGHT WATCHMAN You look kind of all in at that. \nNEFF I'm fine. Let's ride. \nNight watchman pulls lever, doors close and elevator rises. \nNIGHT WATCHMAN How's the insurance business, Mr. Neff? \nNEFF Okay. \nNIGHT WATCHMAN They wouldn't ever sell me any. They say I've got something loose in my heart. I say it's rheumatism. \nNEFF (Scarcely listening) Uh-huh. \nNight watchman looks around at him, turns away again and the elevator stops. \nNIGHT WATCHMAN (Surly) Twelve. \nThe door opens. Across a small dark reception room a pair of frosted glass doors are lettered: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE. There is a little light beyond the glass doors. \nNeff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, across reception room to doors. He pushes them open. The night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, elevator doors start to close. \nPHYLLIS I guess so. I usually am. \nNEFF Same chair, same perfume, same anklet? \nPHYLLIS (Opening the door) I wonder if I know what you mean. \nNEFF I wonder if you wonder. \nHe walks out. \nA-28 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (DAY) \nShooting past Neff's parked car towards the entrance door, which is just closing. Neff comes towards the car, swinging his briefcase. He opens the car door and looks back with a confident smile. \nNEFF'S VOICE (Over scene) She liked me. I could feel that. The way you feel when the cards are... \nA-29 ENTRANCE DOOR, DIETRICHSON HOME \nIn the upper panel the peep window opens and Phyllis looks out after Neff. \nNEFF'S VOICE falling right for you, with a nice little pile of blue and yellow chips in the middle of the table. Only what I didn't know then was that I wasn't playing her. She was playing me -- with a deck of marked cards -- and the stakes weren't any blue and yellow chips. They were dynamite. I went back to the office that afternoon to see if I had any mail. It was the same afternoon you had that Sam Gorlopis on the carpet, that truck driver from Inglewood, remember, Keyes? \nA-30 NEFF \nHe sits in his car, presses the starter button, looking back towards the little window in the entrance door. \nA-31 ENTRANCE DOOR \nThe peep window is quickly closed from inside. \nA-32 STREET \nNeff makes a U-turn and drives back down the block. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA-33 LONG SHOT - INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - (DAY) - CAMERA HIGH \nActivity on the eleventh floor below. Typewriters working, adding machines, filing clerks, secretaries, and so forth. Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase, enters from the vestibule. He walks towards his office. He passes a few salesmen, etc. There is an exchange of greetings. Just as he reaches his office a secretary comes out. She stops. \nSECRETARY Oh, Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see you. He's been yelling for you all afternoon. \nNEFF Is he sore, or just frothing at the mouth a little? Here, park these for me, sweetheart. \nHe hands her his hat and briefcase and continues right on, CAMERA WITH HIM, to a door lettered: \nBARTON KEYES - CLAIMS MANAGER \nKeyes' voice is heard inside, plenty loud. Neff grins as he opens the door and goes in. \nA-34 KEYES: OFFICE - (DAY) \nA minor executive office, not too tidy: large desk across one corner, good carpet, several chairs, filing cabinet against one wall, a dictaphone on the corner of the desk. \nKeyes is sitting behind the desk with his coat off but his hat on. A cigar is clamped in his mouth, ashes falling like snow down his vest, a gold chair and elk's tooth across it. On the other side of the desk sits Sam Gorlopis. He is a big, dumb bruiser, six feet three inches tall -- a dirty work shirt and corduroy pants, rough, untidy hair, broad face, small piggish eyes. He holds a sweat-soaked hat on his knee with a hairy hand. He is chewing gum rapidly. As Neff opens the door, Keyes is giving it to Gorlopis. \nKEYES Wise up, Gorlopis. You're not kidding anybody with that line of bull. You're in a jam and you know it. \nGORLOPIS Sez you. All I want is my money. \nKEYES Sez you. All you're gonna get is the cops. \nHe sees Neff standing inside the door. \nKEYES Come in, Walter. This is Sam Gorlopis from Inglewood. \nNEFF Sure, I know Mr. Gorlopis. Wrote a policy on his truck. How are you, Mr. Gorlopis? \nGORLOPIS I ain't so good. My truck burned down. \nHe looks cautiously sideways at Keyes. \nKEYES Yeah, he just planted his big foot on the starter and the whole thing blazed up in his face. \nGORLOPIS Yes, sir. \nKEYES And didn't even singe his eyebrows. \nGORLOPIS No sir. Look, mister. I got twenty- six hundred bucks tied up in that truck. I'm insured with this company and I want my money. \nKEYES You got a wife, Gorlopis? \nGORLOPIS Sure I got a wife. \nKEYES You got kids? \nGORLOPIS Two kids. \nA-35 EXT. OFFICES - TWELFTH FLOOR \nNeff comes out of Keys' office and walks back along the balcony. Activity of secretaries going in and out of doors, etc. Neff enters his own office. \nNEFF'S VOICE (Over scene) I really did, too, you old crab, always yelling your fat head off, always sore at everyone. But behind the cigar ashes on your vest I kind of knew you had a heart as big as a house... Back in my office there was a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson about the renewals. She didn't want me to come tomorrow evening. She wanted me to come Thursday afternoon at three-thirty instead. I had a lot of stuff lined up for that Thursday afternoon, including a trip down to Santa Monica to see a couple of live prospects about some group insurance. But I kept thinking about Phyllis Dietrichson and the way that anklet of hers cut into her leg. \nA-36 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE \nAnderson, a salesman, sits at one of the desks, filling out a report. Neff enters, goes to his own desk. He looks down at some mail. On top there is a typewritten note. He reads it, sits down and leafs through his desk calendar. \nA-37 INSERT - CLOSEUP - CALENDAR PAGE \nShowing date: THURSDAY 23 May and five or six appointments penciled in tightly on the page. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA-38 DIETRICHSON HOME - ENTRANCE HALL - (DAY) \nTHE CAMERA PANS with Phyllis Dietrichson's feet and ankles as she comes down the stairs, her high heels clicking on the tiles. The anklet glistens on her leg as she moves. THE CAMERA PANS ON. Phyllis has reached the entrance hall, and as she walks toward the front door her whole body becomes visible. She wears a gay print dress with a wide sash over her hips. She opens the door. Outside is Neff, wearing a sport coat, flannel slacks. He takes his hat off. \nPHYLLIS Hello, Mr. Neff. \nHe stands there with a little smile. \nPHYLLIS Aren't you coming in? \nNEFF I'm considering it. \nHe comes in. \nPHYLLIS I hope you didn't mind my changing the appointment. Last night wasn't so convenient. \nNEFF That's okay. I was working on my stamp collection. \nShe leads him toward living room. \nA-39 DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM \nPhyllis and Neff come through archway. She heads toward a low tea table which stands in front of the davenport, with tall glasses, ice cubes, lemon, a pot of tea, etc. \nPHYLLIS I was just fixing some iced tea. Would you like a glass? \nNEFF Unless you have a bottle of beer that's not working. \nPHYLLIS There might be some. I never know what's in the ice box. (Calls) Nettie!... \nShe pours herself a glass of tea. \nPHYLLIS About those renewals, Mr. Neff. I talked to my husband about it. \nNEFF You did? \nPHYLLIS Yes. He'll renew with you he told me. In fact, I thought he'd be here this afternoon. \nNEFF But he's not? \nPHYLLIS No. \nNEFF That's terrible. \nPHYLLIS (Calls again, impatiently) Nettie!... Nettie!... Oh, I forgot, it's the maid's day off. \nNEFF Don't bother, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'd like some iced tea very much. \nPHYLLIS Lemon? Sugar? \nNEFF Fix it your way. \nShe fixes him a glass of tea while he is looking around. He slowly sits down. \nNEFF Seeing it's the maid's day off maybe there's something I can do for you. \nShe hands him the tea. \nNEFF Like running the vacuum cleaner. \nPHYLLIS Fresh. \nNEFF I used to peddle vacuum cleaners. Not much money but you learn a lot about life. \nPHYLLIS I didn't think you'd learned it from a correspondence course. \nNEFF Where did you pick up this tea drinking? You're not English, are you? \nPHYLLIS No. Californian. Born right here in Los Angeles. \nNEFF They say native Californians all come from Iowa. \nPHYLLIS What crown block? \nNEFF Only sometimes they have to have a little help. They can't quite make it on their own. \nPHYLLIS I don't know what you're talking about. \nNEFF Of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block. It can be a car backing over him, or he can fall out of an upstairs window. Any little thing like that, as long as it's a morgue job. \nPHYLLIS Are you crazy? \nNEFF Not that crazy. Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson. \nHe picks up his hat. \nPHYLLIS What's the matter? \nNEFF Look, baby, you can't get away with it. \nPHYLLIS Get away with what? \nNEFF You want to knock him off, don't you, baby. \nPHYLLIS That's a horrible thing to say! \nNEFF Who'd you think I was, anyway? A guy that walks into a good-looking dame's front parlor and says \"Good afternoon, I sell accident insurance on husbands. You got one that's been around too long? Somebody you'd like to turn into a little hard cash? Just give me a smile and I'll help you collect.\" Boy, what a dope I must look to you! \nPHYLLIS I think you're rotten. \nNEFF I think you're swell. So long as I'm not your husband. \nPHYLLIS Get out of here. \nNEFF You bet I will. You bet I'll get out of here, baby. But quick. \nHe goes out. She looks after him. \nA-40 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (DAY) \nNeff bangs the front door shut, walks quickly to his car and drives away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nNEFF'S VOICE (Over scene) So I let her have it, straight between the eyes. She didn't fool me for a minute, not this time. I knew I had hold of a redhot poker and the time to drop it was before it burned my hand off. I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer, the one I had wanted all along, only I wanted it worse now, to get rid of the sour taste of her iced tea, and everything that went with it. I didn't want to go back to the office, so I dropped by a bowling alley at Third and Western and rolled a few lines to get my mind thinking about something else for a while. \nA-41 DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - (DAY) \nShooting past Neff sitting behind the wheel of his car The car hop hangs a tray on the door and serves him a bottle of beer. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA-42 INT. BOWLING ALLEY \nNeff bowling. He rolls the ball with an effort at concentration, but his mind is not really on the game. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA-43 EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - (DUSK) \nIt is late afternoon. The apartment house is called the LOS OLIVOS APARTMENTS. It is a six-story building in the Normandie- Wilshire district, with a basement garage. THE CAMERA PANS UP the front of the building to the top floor windows, as a little rain starts to fall. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nNEFF'S VOICE (Continuing) I didn't feel like eating dinner when I left, and I didn't feel like a show, so I drove home, put the car away and went up to my apartment. \nA-44 INT. NEFF'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - (DUSK) \nIt is a double apartment of conventional design, with kitchen, dinette, and bathroom, squarecut overstuffed borax furniture. Gas logs are lit in the imitation fireplace. Neff stands by the window with his coat off and his tie loose. Raindrops strike against the glass. He turns away impatiently, paces up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws the club on the couch, paces again. \nNEFF'S VOICE (Continuing) It had begun to rain outside and I watched it get dark and didn't even turn on the light. That didn't help me either. I was all twisted up inside, and I was still holding on to that red-hot poker. And right then it came over me that I hadn't walked out on anything at all, that the hook was too strong, that this wasn't the end between her and me. It was only the beginning. \nThe doorbell rings. \nNEFF'S VOICE (Continuing) So at eight o'clock the bell would ring and I would know who it was without even having to think, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. \nNeff goes to the door and opens it. \nPHYLLIS Hello. \nNeff just looks at her. \nPHYLLIS You forgot your hat this afternoon. \nShe has nothing in her hands but her bag. \nNEFF Did I? \nHe looks down at her hands. \nPHYLLIS Bourbon is fine, Walter. \nHe lets her go and moves toward the dinette. \nA-45 THE DINETTE AND KITCHEN \nIt contains a small table and some chairs. A low glass-and- china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen, leaving a space like a doorway. The kitchen is the usual apartment house kitchen, with stove, ice-box, sink, etc. It is quite small. \nNeff goes to the ice-box and Phyllis drifts in after him. \nNEFF Soda? \nPHYLLIS Plain water, please. \nNEFF Get a couple of glasses, will you. \nHe points at the china closet. He has taken a tray of ice cubes from the refrigerator and is holding it under the hot- water faucet. \nNEFF You know, about six months ago a guy slipped on the soap in his bathtub and knocked himself cold and drowned. Only he had accident insurance. So they had an autopsy and she didn't get away with it. \nPhyllis has the glasses now. She hands them to him. He dumps some ice cubes into the glasses. \nPHYLLIS Who didn't? \nNEFF His wife. \nHe reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet. \nNEFF And there was another case where a guy was found shot and his wife said he was cleaning a gun and his stomach got in the way. All she collected was a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi. \nPHYLLIS Perhaps it was worth it to her. \nNeff hands her a glass. \nNEFF See if you can carry this as far as the living room. \nThey move back toward the living room. \nA-46 LIVING ROOM \nPhyllis and Neff go toward the davenport. She is sipping her drink and looking around. \nPHYLLIS It's nice here, Walter. Who takes care of it for you? \nNEFF A colored woman comes in twice a week. \nPHYLLIS You get your own breakfast? \nNEFF Once in a while I squeeze a grapefruit. The rest I get at the corner drugstore. \nThey sit on the davenport, fairly close together. \nPHYLLIS It sounds wonderful. Just strangers beside you. You don't know them. You don't hate them. You don't have to sit across the table and smile at him and that daughter of his every morning of your life. \nNEFF What daughter? Oh, that little girl on the piano. \nPHYLLIS Yes. Lola. She lives with us. He thinks a lot more of her than he does of me. \nNEFF Ever think of a divorce? \nPHYLLIS He wouldn't give me a divorce. \nNEFF I suppose because it would cost him money. \nPHYLLIS He hasn't got any money. Not since he went into the oil business. \nNEFF But he had when you married him? \nPHYLLIS Yes, he had. And I wanted a home. Why not? But that wasn't the only reason. I was his wife's nurse. She was sick for a long time. When she died, he was all broken up. I pitied him so. \nNEFF And now you hate him. \nPHYLLIS Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me. Every-time I buy a dress or a pair of shoes he yells his head off. He won't let me go anywhere. He keeps me shut up. He's always been mean to me. Even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his. That Lola. \nNEFF Nothing for you at all, huh? \nPHYLLIS No. And nothing is just what I'm worth to him. \nNEFF So you lie awake in the dark and listen to him snore and get ideas. \nPHYLLIS Walter, I don't want to kill him. I never did. Not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face. \nNEFF Only sometimes you wish he was dead. \nPHYLLIS Perhaps I do. \nNEFF And you wish it was an accident, and you had that policy. For fifty thousand dollars. Is that it? \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"A\" \nSEQUENCE \"B\" \nFADE IN: \nB-1 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT) \nNeff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone. On the desk next to him stands a used record. The cylinder on the dictaphone is not turning. He is smoking a cigarette. He kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the record which is on the machine and stands it on end on the desk beside the other used record. He reaches down painfully to take another record from the rack beneath the dictaphone, looks at it against the light to make sure it has not been used, then slides it into place on the machine and resets the needle. He lifts the horn and resumes his dictation. \nNEFF The first thing we had to do was fix him up with that accident policy. I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted was his signature on an application. So I had to make him sign without his knowing what he was signing. And I wanted a witness other than Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk. I was trying to think with your brains, Keyes. I wanted all the answers ready for all the questions you were going to spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead. \nNeff takes a last drag on his cigarette and kills it by running it under the ledge of the dictaphone stand. He drops the stub on the floor and resumes. \nNEFF A couple of nights later I went to the house. Everything looked fine, except I didn't like the witness Phyllis had brought in. It was Dietrichson's daughter Lola, and it made me feel a little queer in the belly to have her right there in the room, playing Chinese checkers, as if nothing was going to happen. \nDISSOLVE: \nB-2 A BOARD OF CHINESE CHECKERS CAMERA WITHDRAWS AND GRADUALLY REVEALS THE DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and Lola. Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair. His coat and tie are over the back of the chair, and the evening paper is lying tumbled on the floor beside him. He is smoking a cigar with the band on it. He has a drink in front of him and several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair. He holds his rate book partly open, with a finger in it for a marker. He is going full swing. \nNEFF I suppose you realize, Mr. Dietrichson, that, not being an employee, you are not covered by the State Compensation Insurance Act. The only way you can protect yourself is by having a personal policy of your own. \nDIETRICHSON I know all about that. The next thing you'll tell me I need earthquake insurance and lightning insurance and hail insurance. \nPhyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the dialogue. Lola listens without much interest. \nPHYLLIS (To Dietrichson) If we bought all the insurance they can think up, we'd stay broke paying for it, wouldn't we, honey? \nDIETRICHSON What keeps us broke is you going out and buying five hats at a crack. Who needs a hat in California? \nNEFF I always say insurance is a lot like a hot water bottle. It looks kind of useless and silly hanging on the hook, but when you get that stomach ache in the middle of the night, it comes in mighty handy. \nDIETRICHSON Now you want to sell me a hot water bottle. \nNEFF Dollar for dollar, accident insurance is the cheapest coverage you can buy, Mr. Dietrichson. \nDIETRICHSON Maybe some other time, Mr. Neff. I had a tough day. \nNEFF Just as you say, Mr. Dietrichson. \nDIETRICHSON Suppose we just settle that automobile insurance tonight. \nNEFF Sure. All we need on that is for you to sign an application for renewal. \nPhyllis throws a quick glance at Neff. As she looks back she sees that Lola is staring down at her wrist watch. \nLOLA Phyllis, do you mind if we don't finish this game? It bores me stiff. \nPHYLLIS Got some thing better to do? \nLOLA Yes, I have. \nShe gets up. \nLOLA (To Dietrichson) Father, is it all right if I run along now? \nDIETRICHSON Run along where? Who with? \nLOLA Just Anne. We're going roller skating. \nDIETRICHSON Anne who? \nLOLA Anne Matthews. \nPHYLLIS It's not that Nino Zachetti again? \nDIETRICHSON It better not be that Zachetti guy. If I ever catch you with that --- \nLOLA It's Anne Matthews, I told you. I also told you we're going roller skating. I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont and Franklin -- the north- west corner, in case you're interested. And I'm late already. I hope that is all clear. Good night, Father. Good night, Phyllis. \nShe starts to go. \nNEFF Good night, Miss Dietrichson. \nLOLA Oh, I'm sorry. Good night, Mr. -- \nNEFF Neff. \nLOLA Good night, Mr. Neff. \nPHYLLIS Now you're not going to take my car again. \nLOLA No thanks. I'd rather be dead. \nShe goes out through the archway. \nNEFF Sure he signed it. You saw him. \nPhyllis opens the door a crack. Both look at the stairs, where Dietrichson is going up. Phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm. \nNEFF (Looking up) Watch it, will you. \nPhyllis slowly drops her hand from his arm. Both look up as Dietrichson goes across the balcony and out of sight. \nNEFF Listen. That trip to Palo Alto When does he go? \nPHYLLIS End of the month. \nNEFF He drives, huh? \nPHYLLIS He always drives. \nNEFF Not this time. You're going to make him take the train. \nPHYLLIS Why? \nNEFF Because it's all worked out for a train. \nFor a second they stand listening and looking up as if they had heard a sound. \nPHYLLIS It's all right. Go on, Walter. \nNEFF Look, baby. There's a clause in every accident policy, a little something called double indemnity. The insurance companies put it in as a sort of come-on for the customers. It means they pay double on certain accidents. The kind that almost never happen. Like for instance if a guy got killed on a train, they'd pay a hundred thousand instead of fifty. \nPHYLLIS I see. (Her eyes widen with excitement) \nNEFF We're hitting it for the limit, baby. That's why it's got to be a train. \nPHYLLIS It's going to be a train, Walter. Just the way you say. Straight down the line. \nThey look at each other. The look is like a long kiss. Neff goes out. Slowly Phyllis closes the door and leans her head against it as she looks up the empty stairway. \nB-4 EXT. DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT) \nNeff, briefcase under his arm, comes down the steps to the street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens the door and stops, looking in. \nSitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the steering wheel, is Lola. She wears a coat but no hat. \nLOLA Hello, Mr. Neff. It's me. \nLola gives him a sly smile. Neff is a little annoyed. \nNEFF Something the matter? \nLOLA I've been waiting for you. \nNEFF For me? What for? \nLOLA I thought you could let me ride with you, if you're going my way. \nNeff doesn't like the idea very much. \nNEFF Which way would that be? \nLOLA Down the hill. Down Vermont. \nNEFF (Remembering) Oh, sure. Vermont and Franklin. North- west corner, wasn't it? Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson. \nNeff gets into the car. \nB-5 INT. COUPE - (NIGHT) - (TRANSPARENCY) \nNeff puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the driver's seat. He closes the door and starts the car. They drift down the hill. \nNEFF Roller skating, eh? You like roller skating? \nLOLA I can take it or leave it. \nNeff looks at her curiously. Lola meets his glance. \nNEFF Only tonight you're leaving it? \nThis is an embarrassing moment for Lola. \nLOLA Yes, I am. You see, Mr. Neff, I'm having a very tough time at home. My father doesn't understand me and Phyllis hates me. \nNEFF That does sound tough, all right. \nLOLA That's why I have to lie sometimes. \nNEFF You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin. \nLOLA It's Vermont and Franklin all right. Only it's not Anne Matthews. It's Nino Zachetti. You won't tell on me, will you? \nNEFF'S VOICE (Continued) ...but we couldn't be seen together any more and I had told her never to call me from her house and never to call me at my office. So we had picked out a big market on Los Feliz. She was to be there buying stuff every day about eleven o'clock, and I could run into her there. Kind of accidentally on purpose. \nB-12 INT. MARKET \nNeff stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of cigarettes. As he is opening the pack he looks back casually beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market. \nB-13 ROWS OF HIGH SHELVES IN MARKET \nThe shelves are loaded with canned goods and other merchandise. Customers move around selecting articles and putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them, standing by the soap section. Her basket is partly filled. She wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large envelope pocketbook under her arm. \nB-14 INT. MARKET \nNeff has spotted Phyllis. Without haste he passes through the turnstile towards the back. \nB-15 THE SHELVES \nPhyllis is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket. Neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards her, very slowly, pretending to inspect the goods. A customer passes and goes on out of scene. Phyllis and Neff are now very close. During the ensuing low-spoken dialogue, they continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other \nPHYLLIS Walter. \nNEFF Not so loud. \nPHYLLIS I wanted to talk to you, Walter. Ever since yesterday. \nNEFF Let me talk first. It's all set. The accident policy came through. I've got it in my pocket. I got his check too. I saw him down in the oil fields. He thought he was paying for the auto insurance. The check's just made out to the company. It could be for anything. But you have to send a check for the auto insurance, see. It's all right that way, because one of the cars is yours. \nPHYLLIS But listen, Walter --- \nNEFF Quick, open your bag. \nShe hesitates, then opens it. Neff looks around quickly, slips the policy out of his pocket and drops it into her bag. She snaps the bag shut. \nNEFF Can you get into his safe deposit box? \nPHYLLIS Yes. We both have keys. \nNEFF Fine. But don't put the policy in there yet. I'll tell you when. And listen, you never touched it or even saw it, understand? \nPHYLLIS I'm not a fool. \nNEFF Okay. When is he taking the train? \nPHYLLIS Walter, that's just it. He isn't going. \nNEFF What? \nPHYLLIS That's what I've been trying to tell you. The trip is off. \nNEFF What's happened? \nHe breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in a walker, comes into sight and approaches. She stops beside Neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. Phyllis puts a few cakes of soap into her basket. \nWOMAN (To Neff) Mister, could you reach me that can of coffee? (She points) That one up there. \nNEFF (Reaching up) This one? \nShe nods. Neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and hands it to her. \nWOMAN I don't see why they always have to put what I want on the top shelf. \nShe moves away with her coffee and her child. Out of the corner of his eye Neff watches her go. He moves closer to Phyllis again. \nNEFF Go ahead. I'm listening. \nPHYLLIS He had a fall down at the well. He broke his leg. It's in a cast. \nNEFF That knocks it on the head all right. \nPHYLLIS What do we do, Walter? \nNEFF Nothing. Just wait. \nPHYLLIS Wait for what? \nNEFF Until he can take a train. I told you it's got to be a train. \nPHYLLIS We can't wait. I can't go on like this. \nNEFF We're not going to grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with. \nPHYLLIS There are other ways. \nNEFF Only we're not going to do it other ways. \nPHYLLIS But we can't leave it like this. What do you think would happen if he found out about this accident policy? \nNEFF Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in that death-house. \nB-20 NEFF - ON PHONE \nHis eyes are on Keyes. He speaks into the phone as calmly as possible. \nNEFF I'm listening. Only make it short... Margie. \nB-21 PHYLLIS - ON PHONE \nPHYLLIS He's on crutches. The doctor says he can go if he's careful. The change will do him good. It's wonderful, Walter. Just the way you wanted it. Only with the crutches it's ever so much better, isn't it? \nB-22 NEFF'S OFFICE \nNeff on phone. \nNEFF One hundred percent better. Hold the line a minute. \nHe covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who is now standing at the window. \nNEFF Suppose I join you in your office, Keyes -- \nHe makes a gesture as if expecting Keyes to leave. Keyes stays right where he is. \nKEYES I'll wait. Only tell Margie not to take all day. \nNeff looks at Keyes' back with a strained expression, then lifts the phone again. \nNEFF Go ahead. \nB-23 PHYLLIS, ON PHONE \nPHYLLIS It's the ten-fifteen from Glendale. I'm driving him. Is it still that same dark street? \nB-24 NEFF, ON PHONE \nHe is still watching Keyes cautiously. \nNEFF Yeah -- sure. \nB-24A CLOSEUP - PHYLLIS - ON PHONE \nPHYLLIS The signal is three honks on the horn. Is there anything else? \nB-24B CLOSEUP NEFF, ON PHONE \nNEFF What color did you pick out? \nB-25 PHYLLIS, ON PHONE \nPHYLLIS Color? (She catches on) Oh, sure. The blue suit, Walter. Navy blue. And the cast on his left leg. \nB-26 NEFF, ON PHONE \nNEFF Navy blue. I like that fine. \nB-27 PHYLLIS, ON PHONE \nPHYLLIS This is it, Walter. I'm shaking like a leaf. But it's straight down the line now for both of us. I love you, Walter. Goodbye. \nB-28 NEFF'S OFFICE \nNeff on the phone. \nNEFF So long, Margie. \nHe hangs up. His mouth is grim, but he forces a smile as Keyes turns. \nNEFF I'm sorry, Keyes. \nKEYES What's the matter? The dames chasing you again? Or still? Or is it none of my business? \nNEFF (With a sour smile) If I told you it was a customer -- \nKEYES Margie! I bet she drinks from the bottle. Why don't you settle down and get married, Walter? \nNEFF Why don't you, for instance? \nKEYES I almost did, once. A long time ago. \nNeff gets up from his desk. \nNEFF Look, Keyes, I've got a prospect to call on. \nKeyes drives right ahead. \nKEYES We even had the church all picked out, the dame and I. She had a white satin dress with flounces on it. And I was on my way to the jewelry store to buy the ring. Then suddenly that little man in here started working on me. \nHe punches his stomach with his fist. \nB-37 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT) - LONG SHOT - NO TRAFFIC \nSome windows are lit. Neff comes into the shot and approaches cautiously. He looks around and then slides open the garage door. \nB-38 INT. GARAGE \nNeff closes the garage door. Very faint light comes in at a side window. He opens the rear door of the sedan, gets in and closes the door after him. The dark interior of the car has swallowed him up. \nNEFF'S VOICE Then I was in the garage. His car was backed in, just the way I told Phyllis to have it. It was so still I could hear the ticking of the clock on the dashboard. I kept thinking of the place we had picked out to do it, that dark street on the way to the station, and the three honks on the horn that were to be the signal... About ten minutes later they came down. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nB-39 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOUSE \nThe front door has opened and Dietrichson is half-way down the steps. He is walking with crutches, wearing the dark blue suit and a hat. The cast is on his left leg. There is no shoe on his left foot. Only the white plaster shows. Phyllis comes after him, carrying his suitcase and his overcoat. She wears a camel's-hair coat and no hat. She catches up with him. \nPHYLLIS You all right, honey? I'll have the car out in a second. \nDietrichson just grunts. She passes him to the garage, CAMERA WITH HER, and slides the door open. \nB-40 INT. GARAGE \nTHE CAMERA IS VERY LOW INSIDE THE SEDAN, shooting slightly upwards from Neff's hiding place. The garage door has just been opened. Phyllis comes to the car, opens the rear door. She looks down, almost INTO THE CAMERA. A tight, cool smile flashes across her face. Then, very calmly, she puts the suitcase and overcoat in back on the seat (out of shot). She closes the door again. \nB-41 EXT. GARAGE \nDietrichson stands watching Phyllis as she gets into the car and drives out to pick him up. She stops beside him and opens the right-hand door. Dietrichson climbs in with difficulty. She helps him, watching him closely. \nPHYLLIS Take it easy, honey. We've got lots of time. \nDIETRICHSON Just let me do it my own way. Grab that crutch. \nShe takes one of the crutches from him. \nDIETRICHSON They ought to make these things so they fold up. \nFor a moment, as he leans his hand on the back of the seat, there is danger that he may see Neff. He doesn't. He slides awkwardly into the seat and pulls the second crutch in after him. He closes the door. The car moves off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nB-42 INT. CAR \nPhyllis driving and Dietrichson beside her, face TOWARDS THE CAMERA. Dietrichson has a partly smoked cigar between his teeth. They are in the middle of a conversation. \nDIETRICHSON Aw, stop squawkin' can't you, Phyllis? No man takes his wife along to a class reunion. That's what class reunions are for. \nPHYLLIS Mrs. Tucker went along with her husband last year, didn't she. \nDIETRICHSON Yeah, and what happened to her? She sat in the hotel lobby for four days straight. Never even saw the guy until we poured him back on the train. \nB-43 CLOSEUP ON NEFF'S FACE LOW DOWN IN THE CORNER BEHIND DIETRICHSON \nHis face is partly covered by the edge of a traveling rug which he has pulled up over him. He looks up at Dietrichson and Phyllis in the front seat. \nPHYLLIS' VOICE All right, honey. Just so long as you have a good time. \nDIETRICHSON'S VOICE I won't do much dancing, I can tell you that. \nB-44 HEADS & SHOULDERS OF DIETRICHSON & PHYLLIS - AS SEEN BY NEFF \nPHYLLIS Remember what the doctor said. If you get careless you might end up with a shorter leg. \nDIETRICHSON So what? I could break the other one and match them up again. \nPHYLLIS It makes you feel pretty good to get away from me, doesn't it? \nB-45 PHYLLIS & DIETRICHSON - FACING CAMERA \nDIETRICHSON It's only for four days. I'll be back Monday at the latest. \nPHYLLIS Don't forget we're having the Hobeys for dinner on Monday. \nDIETRICHSON The Hobeys? We had them last. They owe us a dinner, don't they? \nPHYLLIS Maybe they do but I've already asked them for Monday. \nDIETRICHSON Well, I don't want to feed the Hobeys. \nB-46 CLOSEUP - PHYLLIS' FACE ONLY \nThere is a look of tension in her eyes now. She glances around quickly. The car has reached the dark street Neff and she picked out. \nDIETRICHSON'S VOICE And I don't want to eat at their house either. The food you get there, and that rope he hands out for cigars. Call it off, can't you? \nPhyllis does not answer. She doesn't even breathe. Her hand goes down on the horn button. She honks three times. \nDIETRICHSON'S VOICE What are you doing that for? What the -- \nPORTER Yes, sir. \nNEFF I'm going back to the observation car for a smoke. \nPORTER This way, sir. Three cars back. \nHe holds the vestibule door open. Neff hobbles through. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nB-55 INT. PULLMAN CAR - DIM \nMost of the berths are made up. As Neff hobbles along, another porter and some passengers make way for the crippled man solicitously. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nB-56 PLATFORM BETWEEN TWO CARS - VERY DIM \nThe train conductor meets Neff and opens the door for him. Neff hobbles on through. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nB-57 INT. PARLOR CAR - MOVING TRAIN \nFour or five passengers are reading or writing. As Neff comes through on his crutches they pull in their feet to make room for him. One old lady, seeing that he is headed for the observation platform, opens the door for him. He thanks her with a nod and hobbles through. \nB-58 OBSERVATION PLATFORM \nDark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor car. The train is going at about fifteen miles an hour between Glendale and Burbank. Neff has come out and hobbled to the railing. He stands looking back along the rails. SUDDENLY A MAN'S VOICE speaks from behind him. \nMAN'S VOICE Can I pull a chair out for you? \nNeff looks around. He sees a man sitting in the corner smoking a hand-rolled cigarette. He is about fifty-five years old, with white hair, and a broad-brimmed Stetson hat. He looks like a small town lawyer or maybe a mining man. Neff does not like the man's presence there very much. He turns to him just enough to answer. \nNEFF No thanks, I'd rather stand. \nMAN You going far? \nNEFF Palo Alto. \nMAN My name's Jackson. I'm going all the way to Medford. Medford, Oregon. Had a broken arm myself once. \nNEFF Uh-huh. \nJACKSON That darn cast sure itches something fierce, don't it? I thought I'd go crazy with mine. \nNeff stands silent. His mind is feverishly thinking of how to get rid of Jackson. \nJACKSON Palo Alto's a nice little town. You a Stanford man? \nNEFF Used to be. \nHe starts patting his pockets as if looking for something. \nJACKSON I bet you left something behind. I always do. \nNEFF My cigar case. Must have left it in my overcoat back in the section. \nJackson takes out a small bag of tobacco and a packet of cigarette papers. \nJACKSON Care to roll yourself a cigarette, Mr. --? \nNEFF Dietrichson. Thanks. I really prefer cigars. (Looking around) Maybe the porter -- \nJACKSON I could get your cigars for you. Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson. \nNEFF That's darn nice of you. It's car nine, section eleven. If you're sure it's not too much trouble. \nJACKSON Car nine, section eleven. A pleasure. \nHe rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly swings his body over the rail. \nB-59 EXT. MOVING OBSERVATION CAR - CAMERA FOLLOWING \nNeff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets go and drops to the right-of-way. THE CAMERA STOPS. The train recedes slowly into the night. Neff has fallen on the tracks. He picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the line of the tracks and off to one side. \nB-60 DARK LANDSCAPE - RAILROAD TRACKS \nClose beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of a dump shows up. Beside it looms the dark bulk of the Dietrichson sedan. The headlights blink twice and go out. \nB-61 NEFF \nHe starts running towards the car. He runs a little awkwardly because of the improvised cast on his left foot. \nB-62 CAR IN THE DARK \nThe front door opens and Phyllis steps out. She closes the door and looks in the direction of the tracks. The uneven steps of Neff running towards her are heard. She opens the back door of the car and leans in. She pulls the rug off the corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug. The running steps grow louder and Neff comes into the SHOT breathing hard. He reaches her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nB-72 B-73 INSERTS \nTelephone bell box and the door bell. The cards are still in position. Neff's hand takes them out. \nNEFF'S VOICE (Cont'd) In the apartment I checked the bells. The cards hadn't moved. No calls. No visitors. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nB-74 LIVING ROOM - NEFF'S APT. NIGHT - ELECTRIC LIGHTS ON \nNeff comes from the bedroom, wearing the light grey suit he wore before the murder, only with out a tie. He buttons his jacket, looks around the room, and opens the corridor door. \nNEFF'S VOICE I changed the blue suit. There was one last thing to do. I wanted the garage man to see me again. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nB-75 BASEMENT GARAGE - (NIGHT) \nFifteen or twenty cars are parked now. Charlie, the attendant has washed Neff's car and is now polishing the glass and metal work. Neff comes from the elevator. Charlie sees him. He straightens up. \nCHARLIE You going to need it after all, Mr. Neff? I'm about through. \nNEFF It's okay, Charlie. Just walking down to the drug store for something to eat. Been working upstairs all evening. My stomach's getting sore at me. \nHe walks up the ramp towards the garage entrance. \nB-76 STREET OUTSIDE APT. HOUSE - (NIGHT) - SHOOTING TOWARDS GARAGE ENTRANCE \nNeff comes out at the top of the ramp and starts to walk down the street, not too fast. CAMERA PRECEDES HIM. He walks about ten or fifteen yards. At first his steps sound hard and distinct on the sidewalk and echo in the deserted street. But slowly, as he goes on, they fade into utter silence. He walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the silence. He stops rigidly and looks back. CAMERA STOPS WITH HIM. He stands like that for a moment, then turns toward the CAMERA again. There is a look of horror on his face now. He walks on, CAMERA AHEAD OF HIM again. Still his steps make no sound. \nNEFF'S VOICE That was all there was to it. Nothing had slipped, nothing had been overlooked, there was nothing to give us away. And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down the street to the drug store, suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong. It sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, so help me: I couldn't hear my own footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man. \nFADE OUT: \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"B\" \nSEQUENCE \"C\" \nFADE IN: \nC-1 NEFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nNeff sits before the dictaphone. There are four cylinders on end on the desk next to him. He gets up from the swivel chair with great effort and stands a moment unsteadily. The wound in his shoulder is paining him. He is very weak as he slowly crosses to the water cooler. He takes the blood stained handkerchief from inside his shirt and soaks it with fresh water. \nThe office door opens behind him. He turns, hiding the handkerchief behind his back. In the doorway stands the colored man who has been cleaning up downstairs. He is carrying his big trash box by a rope handle. \nCOLORED MAN Didn't know anybody was here, Mr. Neff. We ain't cleaned your office yet. \nNEFF Let it go tonight. I'm busy. \nCOLORED MAN Whatever you say, Mr. Neff. \nHe closes the door slowly, staring at Neff with an uneasy expression. Neff puts the soaked handkerchief back on his wounded shoulder, then walks heavily over to his swivel chair and lowers himself into it. He takes the dictaphone horn and speaks into it again. \nNEFF That was the longest night I ever lived through, Keyes, and the next day was worse, when the story broke in the papers, and they were talking about it at the office, and the day after that when you started digging into it. I kept my hands in my pockets because I thought they were shaking, and I put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes, and then I took them off again so people wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them. I was trying to hold myself together, but I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces.... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nC-2 INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - DAY \nNeff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He walks towards his office, but half way there he runs into Keyes. Keyes is wearing his vest and hat, no coat. He is carrying a file of papers and smoking a cigar. \nKEYES Come on, Walter. The big boss wants to see us. \nNEFF Okay. \nHe turns and walks beside Keyes, CAMERA AHEAD of them \nNEFF That Dietrichson case? \nKEYES Must be. \nNEFF Anything wrong? \nKEYES The guy's dead, we had him insured and it's going to cost us money. That's always wrong. \nHe stops by a majolica jar full of sand and takes a pencil from his vest. He stands over the jar extinguishing his cigar carefully so as not to damage it. \nNEFF What have you got so far? \nKEYES Autopsy report. No heart failure, no apoplexy, no predisposing medical cause of any kind. He died of a broken neck. \nNEFF When is the inquest? \nKEYES They had it this morning. His wife and daughter made the identification. The train people and some passengers told how he went through to the observation car.. It was all over in forty-five minutes. Verdict, accidental death. \nNORTON -- that just because a man has a large office he must be an idiot. I'm having a visitor, if you don't mind. \nKeyes and Neff start to get up. \nNORTON No, no. I want you to stay and watch me handle this. \nThe secretary has opened the door. \nSECRETARY Mrs. Dietrichson. \nNeff stands staring at the door. He relaxes with an obvious effort of will. Phyllis comes in. She wears a gray tailored suit, small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carries a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr. Norton goes to meet her. \nNORTON Thank you very much for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson. I assure you I appreciate it. \nHe turns a little towards Keyes. \nNORTON This is Mr. Keyes. \nKEYES How do you do. \nPHYLLIS How do you do. \nNORTON And Mr. Neff. \nPHYLLIS I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do. \nNorton has placed a chair. Phyllis sits. Norton goes behind his desk. \nNORTON Mrs. Dietrichson, I assure you of our sympathy in your bereavement. I hesitated before asking you to come here so soon after your loss. \nPhyllis nods silently. \nNORTON But now that you're here I hope you won't mind if I plunge straight into business. You know why we asked you to come, don't you? \nPHYLLIS No. All I know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent. \nKeyes sits quietly in his chair with his legs crossed. He has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in the armholes of his vest. He looks a little bored. Neff, behind him, stands leaning against the false mantel, completely dead-pan. \nNORTON Your husband had an accident policy with this company. Evidently you don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson. \nPHYLLIS No. I remember some talk at the house -- \nShe looks towards Neff. \nPHYLLIS -- but he didn't seem to want it. \nNEFF He took it out a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson. \nPHYLLIS I see. \nNORTON You'll probably find the policy among his personal effects. \nPHYLLIS His safe deposit box hasn't been opened yet. It seems a tax examiner has to be present. \nNORTON Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't want you to think you are being subjected to any questioning. But there are a few things we should like to know. \nPHYLLIS What sort of things? \nNORTON We have the report of the coroner's inquest. Accidental death. We are not entirely satisfied. In fact we are not satisfied at all. \nPhyllis looks at him coolly. \nKeyes looks vaguely interested. \nNeff is staring straight at Phyllis. \nNORTON Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect suicide. \nPhyllis doesn't bat an eyelash. \nNORTON I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water? \nPHYLLIS Please. \nNORTON Mr. Neff. \nHe indicates a thermos on a stand near Neff. Neff pours a glass of water and carries it over to Phyllis. She has lifted her veil a little. She takes the glass from his hand. \nPHYLLIS Thank you. \nTheir eyes meet for a fraction of a second. \nNORTON Had your husband been moody or depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson? Did he seem to have financial worries, for instance? \nPHYLLIS He was perfectly all right and I don't know of any financial worries. \nNORTON There must have been something, Mrs. Dietrichson. Let us examine this so- called accident. First, your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy. Why? Because he doesn't want his family to suspect what he intends to do. \nThe door bell rings. \nNeff stops in sudden alarm. It can't be Phyllis. The time is too short. For a second he stands there motionless, then crosses to the door and opens it. \nIn the open door stands Keyes. \nNEFF Hello, Keyes. \nKeyes walks past him into the room. His hands are clasped behind his back. There is a strange, absent-minded look in his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off Keyes. \nNEFF What's on your mind? \nKeyes stops in the middle of the room and turns. \nKEYES That broken leg. The guy broke his leg. \nNEFF What are you talking about? \nKEYES Talking about Dietrichson. He had accident insurance, didn't he? Then he broke his leg, didn't he? \nNEFF So what? \nKEYES And he didn't put in a claim. Why didn't he put in a claim? Why? \nNEFF What the dickens are you driving at? \nKEYES Walter. There's something wrong. I ate dinner two hours ago. It stuck half way. \nHe prods his stomach with his thumb. \nKEYES The little man is acting up again. Because there's something wrong with that Dietrichson case. \nNEFF Because he didn't put in a claim? Maybe he just didn't have time. \nKEYES Oh maybe he just didn't know he was insured. \nHe has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for a tense moment. Neff hardly breathes. \nKeyes shakes his head suddenly. \nKEYES No. That couldn't be it. You delivered the policy to him personally, didn't you, Walter? And you got his check. \nNEFF (Stiff-lipped, but his voice is as well under control as he can manage) Sure, I did. \nKeyes prods his stomach again. \nKEYES Got any bicarbonate of soda? \nNEFF No I haven't. \nKeyes resumes his pacing. \nKEYES Listen, Walter. I've been living with this little man for twenty-six years. He's never failed me yet. There's got to be something wrong. \nNEFF Maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was suicide, Keyes. \nKEYES No. Not suicide. (Pause) But not accident either. \nNEFF What else? \nThere is another longer pause, agonizing for Neff. Finally Keyes continues: \nKEYES Look. A man takes out an accident policy that is worth a hundred thousand dollars if he is killed on a train. Then, two weeks later, he is killed on a train. And not in a train accident, mind you, but falling off some silly observation car. Do you know what the mathematical probability of that is, Walter? One out of I don't know how many billions. And add to that the broken leg. It just can't be the way it looks, Walter. Something has been worked on us. \nNEFF Such as what? \nKeyes doesn't answer. He goes on pacing up and down. Finally Neff can't stand the silence any longer. \nNEFF Murder? \nKEYES (Prods stomach again) Don't you have any peppermint or anything? \nNEFF I'm sorry. (Pause) Who do you suspect? \nKEYES Maybe I like to make things easy for myself. But I always tend to suspect the beneficiary. \nNEFF The wife? \nKEYES Yeah. That wide-eyed dame that didn't know anything about anything. \nNEFF You're crazy, Keyes. She wasn't even on the train. \nKEYES I know she wasn't, Walter. I don't claim to know how it was worked, or who worked it, but I know that it was worked. \nHe crosses to the corridor door. \nKEYES I've got to get to a drug store. It feels like a hunk of concrete inside me. \nLOLA Could I talk to you, just for a few minutes? Somewhere where we can be alone? \nNEFF Sure. Come on into my office. \nHe pushes the swing door open and holds it for her. As she passes in front of him his eyes narrow in uneasy speculation. \nD-2 TWELFTH FLOOR - BALCONY \nNeff comes up level with Lola and leads her towards his office, CAMERA WITH THEM. \nNEFF Is it something to do with -- what happened? \nLOLA Yes, Mr. Neff. It's about my father's death. \nNEFF I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson. \nHe opens the door of his office and holds it for her. She enters. \nD-3 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (DAY) \nLou Schwartz, one of the other salesmen, is working at his desk. Lola enters, Neff after her. \nNEFF (To Schwartz) Lou, do you mind if I use the office alone for a few minutes? \nSCHWARTZ It's all yours, Walter. \nHe gets up and goes out. Lola has walked over to the window and is looking out so Schwartz won't stare at her. Neff places a chair beside his desk. \nNEFF Won't you sit down? \nAt the sound of the closing door she turns and speaks with a catch in her voice. \nLOLA Mr. Neff, I can't help it, but I have such a strange feeling that there is something queer about my father's death. \nNEFF Queer? Queer in what way? \nLOLA I don't know why I should be bothering you with my troubles, except that you knew my father and knew about the insurance he took out. And you were so nice to me that evening in your car. \nNEFF Sure. We got along fine, didn't we. \nHe sits down. His face is grim and watchful. \nLOLA Look at me, Mr. Neff. I'm not crazy. I'm not hysterical. I'm not even crying. But I have the awful feeling that something is wrong, and I had the same feeling once before -- when my mother died. \nNEFF When your mother died? \nLOLA We were up at Lake Arrowhead. That was six years ago. We had a cabin there. It was winter and very cold and my mother was very sick with pneumonia. She had a nurse with her. There were just the three of us in the cabin. One night I got up and went into my mother's room. She was delirious with fever. All the bed covers were on the floor and the windows were wide open. The nurse wasn't in the room. I ran and covered my mother up as quickly as I could. Just then I heard a door open behind me. The nurse stood there. She didn't say a word, but there was a look in her eyes I'll never forget. Two days later my mother was dead. (Pause) Do you know who that nurse was? \nNeff stares at her tensely. He knows only too well who the nurse was. \nNEFF No. Who? \nLOLA Phyllis. I tried to tell my father, but I was just a kid then and he wouldn't listen to me. Six months later she married him and I kind of talked myself out of the idea that she could have done anything like that. But now it's all back again, now that something has happened to my father, too. \nNEFF You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train. \nLOLA Yes, and two days before he fell off that train what was Phyllis doing? She was in her room in front of a mirror, with a black hat on, and she was pinning a black veil to it, as if she couldn't wait to see how she would look in mourning. \nNEFF Look. You've had a pretty bad shock. Aren't you just imagining all this? \nLOLA I caught her eyes in the mirror, and they had that look in them they had before my mother died. That same look. \nNEFF You don't like your step-mother, do you? Isn't it just because she is your step-mother? \nLOLA I loathe her. Because she did it. She did it for the money. Only you're not going to pay her, are you, Mr. Neff? She's not going to get away with it this time. I'm going to speak up. I'm going to tell everything I know. \nNEFF You'd better be careful, saying things like that. \nLOLA I'm not afraid. You'll see. \nShe turns again to the window so he won't see that she is crying. Neff gets up and goes to her. \nLOLA I'm sorry. I didn't mean to act like this. \nNEFF All this that you've been telling me -- who else have you told? \nLOLA No one. \nNEFF How about your step-mother? \nLOLA Of course not. I'm not living in the house any more. I moved out. \nNEFF And you didn't tell that boy-friend of yours? Zachetti. \nLOLA I'm not seeing him any more. We had a fight. \nNEFF Where are you living then? \nJACKSON Are these photographs of the late Mr. Dietrichson? \nKEYES Yes. \nJACKSON Then my answer is no. \nKEYES What do you mean no? \nJACKSON I mean this is not the man that was on the train. \nKEYES Will you swear to that? \nJACKSON I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon. And if I say it, I mean it, and if I mean it, of course I'll swear it. \nKEYES Thank you. \nKeyes turns to Neff. \nKEYES There you are, Walter. There's your proof. \nKeyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson. \nKEYES Oh, Mr. Jackson, this is Mr. Neff, one of our salesmen. \nJACKSON Please to meet you, Mr. Neff. Pleased indeed. \nNEFF How do you do. \nJACKSON Very fine, thank you. Never was better. \nKEYES Mr. Jackson, how would you describe the man you saw on that observation platform? \nJACKSON Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger man, about ten or fifteen years younger than the man in these photographs. \nKEYES Dietrichson was about fifty, wasn't he, Walter? \nNEFF Fifty-one, according to the policy. \nJACKSON The man I saw was nothing like fifty- one years old. Of course, it was pretty dark on that platform and, come to think of it, he tried to keep his back towards me. But I'm positive just the same. \nKEYES That's fine, Jackson. Now you understand this matter is strictly confidential. We may need you again down here in Los Angeles, if the case comes to court. \nJACKSON Any time you need me, I'm at your entire disposal, gentlemen. Expenses paid, of course. \nKeyes picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it. \nKEYES Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office. \nMeanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff and, during the ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low voice on the phone in background. We do not hear what he says. \nJACKSON (To Neff) Ever been in Medford, Mr. Neff? \nNEFF Never. \nJACKSON Wait a minute. Do you go trout fishing? Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way. \nNEFF Nope. Never fish. \nJACKSON Neff. Neff. I've got it! It's the name. There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis. \nNEFF No relation. \nJACKSON Let me see. This man's an automobile dealer in Corvallis. Very reputable man, too, I'm told. \nKeyes rejoins them at this point. \nKEYES All right, Mr. Jackson. Suppose you go down to the cashier's office -- room twenty-seven on the eleventh floor. They'll take care of your expense account and your ticket for the train tonight. \nJACKSON Tonight? Tomorrow morning would suit me better. There's a very good osteopath down here I want to see before I leave. \nKeyes has opened the door for Jackson. \nKEYES Okay, Mr. Jackson. Just don't put her on the expense account. \nJackson doesn't get it. \nJACKSON Goodbye, gentlemen. A pleasure. \nHe goes out. \nKEYES There it is, Walter. It's beginning to come apart at the seams already. A murder's never perfect. It always comes apart sooner or later. And when two people are involved it's usually sooner. We know the Dietrichson dame is in it, and somebody else. Pretty soon we're going to know who that somebody else is. He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet. Their emotions are all kicked up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter. They can't keep away from each other. They think it's twice as safe because there are two of them. But it's not twice as safe. It's ten times twice as dangerous. They've committed a murder and that's not like taking a trolley ride together where each one can get off at a different stop. They're stuck with each other. They've got to ride all the way to the end of the line. And it's a one-way trip, and the last stop is the cemetery. \nHe puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets for matches. \nKEYES (Continued) She put in her claim and I'm going to throw it right back at her. (Pats his pockets again) Have you got one of those? \nNeff strikes a match for him. Keyes takes the match out of his hand and lights his cigar. \nNEFF I wanted to straighten out that Dietrichson story for you. \nKEYES So I gather. \nNEFF How long have you been standing there? \nKEYES Long enough. \nNEFF Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it. One you didn't quite figure out. \nKEYES You can't figure them all, Walter. \nNEFF That's right. You can't, can you? And now I suppose I get the big speech, the one with all the two- dollar words in it. Let's have it, Keyes. \nKEYES You're all washed up, Walter. \nNEFF Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway. \nThey stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse. \nKEYES Walter, I'm going to call a doctor. \nNEFF (Bitterly) What for? So they can patch me up? So they can nurse me along till I'm back on my feet? So I can walk under my own power into that gas chamber up in San Quentin? Is that it, Keyes? \nKEYES Something like that, Walter. \nNEFF Well, I've got a different idea. Look here. Suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders till tomorrow morning, when the office opens. From then on you can play it any way you like. Would you do that much for me, Keyes? \nKEYES Give me one good reason. \nNEFF I need four hours to get where I'm going. \nKEYES You're not going anywhere, Walter. \nNEFF You bet I am. I'm going across the border. \nKEYES You haven't got a chance. \nNEFF Good enough to try for. \nKEYES You'll never make the border. \nNEFF That's what you think. Watch me. \nNeff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, holding himself upright with great effort. \nKEYES (In a voice of stony calm) You'll never even make the elevator. \nNeff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable face. \nNEFF So long, Keyes. \nNeff goes out, leaving the door wide open. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR LOBBY. The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that for a moment it dominates the scene. Finally he reaches the swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them open. At this moment he collapses. He clutches the edge of the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the floor. He tries to struggle up but cannot rise. \nIn background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed. \nKEYES' VOICE Hello... Send an ambulance to the Pacific Building on Olive Street... Yeah... It's a police job. \nThere is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. Then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony and Keyes walks slowly into the shot. He kneels down beside Neff. \nKEYES How you doing, Walter? \nNeff manages a faint smile. \nNEFF I'm fine. Only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away. \nKEYES They're on the way. \nNEFF (Slowly and with great difficulty) You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy you were looking for was too close. He was right across the desk from you. \nKEYES Closer than that, Walter. \nThe eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence. \nNEFF I love you too. \nNeff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it. The handkerchief drops from his hand. He gets a loose cigarette out of his pocket and puts it between his lips. Then with great difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is too weak. Keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it for him and lights his cigarette. \nFADE OUT: \nTHE END \nThe following pages are for an alternate ending that director Billy Wilder actually shot but later decided against. \nKEYES They're on the way. \nNEFF (Slowly and with great difficulty) You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy you were looking for was too close. He was right across the desk from you. \n", "test1_input": "A-19 PHYLLIS \nPHYLLIS Is there anything I can do? \nA-20 NEFF \nNEFF The insurance ran out on the fifteenth. I'd hate to think of your getting a smashed fender or something while you're not fully covered. \nA-21 PHYLLIS \nShe glances over her towel costume. \nPHYLLIS (With a little smile) Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. Neff. I've just been taking a sun bath. \nA-22 NEFF \nNEFF No pigeons around, I hope... About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson -- I hate to take up your time -- \nA-23 PHYLLIS \nPHYLLIS That's all right. If you can wait till I put something on, I'll be right down. Nettie, show Mr. Neff into the living room. \nShe turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a wrapper.] \nA-24 ENTRANCE HALL \nNeff watches Phyllis out of sight. He speaks to the maid while still looking up. \nNEFF Where would the living room be? \nMAID In there, but they keep the liquor locked up. \nNEFF That's okay. I always carry my own keys. \nHe goes through the archway. Maid goes off the other way. \nA-25 LIVING ROOM \nNeff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it. He looks around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet photographs standing in a staggered position on top. Neff glances them over: Mr. Dietrichson, age about fifty-one, a big, blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look about him; Lola Dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. Neff walks away from the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the rug. His eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. He carefully straightens it out with his foot. His back is to the archway as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. He turns and looks through the arch. \nNEFF'S VOICE The living room was still stuffy from last night's cigars. The windows were closed and the sunshine coming in through the Venetian blinds showed up the dust in the air. The furniture was kind of corny and old-fashioned, but it had a comfortable look, as if people really sat in it. On the piano, in couple of fancy frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter by his first wife They had a bowl of those little red goldfish on the table behind the davenport, but, to tell you the truth, Keyes, I wasn't a whole lot interested in goldfish right then, nor in auto renewals, nor in Mr. Dietrichson and his daughter Lola. I was thinking about that dame upstairs, and the way she had looked at me, and I wanted to see her again, close, without that silly staircase between us. \nA-26 STAIRCASE (FROM NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW) \nPhyllis Dietrichson is coming downstairs. First we see her feet, with pom-pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left ankle. CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY as she descends, until we see all of her. She is wearing a pale blue summer dress. \nPHYLLIS' VOICE I wasn't long, was I? \nNEFF'S VOICE Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK WITH HER INTO THE LIVING ROOM. \nPHYLLIS I hope I've got my face on straight. \nNEFF It's perfect for my money. \nPHYLLIS (Crossing to the mirror over the fireplace) Won't you sit down, Mr. -- Neff is the name, isn't it? \nNEFF With two f's, like in Philadelphia. If you know the story. \nPHYLLIS What story? \nNEFF The Philadelphia story. What are we talking about? \nPHYLLIS (She works with her lipstick) About the insurance. My husband never tells me anything. \nNEFF It's on your two cars, the La Salle and the Plymouth. \nHe crosses to the davenport to get the policies from his briefcase. She turns away from the mirror and sits in a big chair with her legs drawn up sideways, the anklet now clearly visible. \nNEFF We've been handling this insurance for three years for Mr. Dietrichson... (His eyes have caught the anklet) That's a honey of an anklet you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson. \nPhyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dress. \nNEFF We'd hate to see the policies lapse. Of course, we give him thirty days. That's all we're allowed to give. \nPHYLLIS I guess he's been too busy down at Long Beach in the oil fields. \nNEFF Could I catch him home some evening for a few minutes? \nPHYLLIS I suppose so. But he's never home much before eight. \nNEFF That would be fine with me. \nPHYLLIS You're not connected with the Automobile Club, are you? \nNEFF No, the All-Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson. Why? \n", "test1_true": "NEFF If your husband's a member. \nPHYLLIS No, he isn't. \nPhyllis rises and walks up and down, paying less and less attention. \nNEFF Well, he'd have to join the club and pay a membership fee to start with. The Automobile Club is fine. I never knock the other fellow's merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson, but I can do just as well for you. I have a very attractive policy here. It wouldn't take me two minutes to put it in front of your husband. \nHe consults the policies he is holding. \nNEFF For instance, we're writing a new kind of fifty percent retention feature in the collision coverage. \nPhyllis stops in her walk. \nPHYLLIS You're a smart insurance man, aren't you, Mr. Neff? \nNEFF I've had eleven years of it. \nPHYLLIS Doing pretty well? \nNEFF It's a living. \nPHYLLIS You handle just automobile insurance, or all kinds? \nShe sits down again, in the same position as before. \nNEFF All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft, public liability, group insurance, industrial stuff and so on right down the line. \nPHYLLIS Accident insurance? \nNEFF Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson. \nHis eyes fall on the anklet again. \nNEFF I wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet. \nPHYLLIS Just my name. \nNEFF As for instance? \nPHYLLIS Phyllis. \nNEFF Phyllis. I think I like that. \nPHYLLIS But you're not sure? \nNEFF I'd have to drive it around the block a couple of times. \nPHYLLIS (Standing up again) Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow evening about eight-thirty. He'll be in then. \nNEFF Who? \nPHYLLIS My husband. You were anxious to talk to him weren't you? \nNEFF Sure, only I'm getting over it a little. If you know what I mean. \nPHYLLIS There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff. Forty-five miles an hour. \nNEFF How fast was I going, officer? \nPHYLLIS I'd say about ninety. \nNEFF Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket. \nPHYLLIS Suppose I let you off with a warning this time. \nNEFF Suppose it doesn't take. \nPHYLLIS Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles. \nNEFF Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder. \nPHYLLIS Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder. \nNEFF That tears it. \nNeff takes his hat and briefcase. \nNEFF Eight-thirty tomorrow evening then, Mrs. Dietrichson. \nPHYLLIS That's what I suggested. \nThey both move toward the archway. \nA-27 HALLWAY - PHYLLIS AND NEFF GOING TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE DOOR \nNEFF Will you be here, too? \n", "test2_input": "DISSOLVE TO: \nD-11 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT) \nNeff is dictating into the dictaphone. \nNEFF Yeah, I remembered it all right. Just as I remembered what you had told me, Keyes, about that trolley car ride, and how there was no way to get off until the end of the line, where the cemetery was. And I got to thinking what cemeteries are for. They're to put dead people in, I guess that was the first time I ever thought about Phyllis that way. Dead, I mean, and how things would be if she was dead. Because the way it was now she had me by the throat. She could hang me higher than a kite any day she felt like it. And there was nothing I could do, except hold my breath and watch that day come closer and closer, and maybe pray a little, if I still knew how to pray... I saw Lola three or four times that week. I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, after what I had done, but it was only with her that I could relax and let go a little. Then one night we drove up into the hills above Hollywood Bowl... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nD-12 HOLLYWOOD HILLS (NIGHT) (TRANSPARENCY) \nNeff and Lola are climbing over a low hill in the foreground. The sky is starlit and music from the Bowl comes over the scene from below (Cesar Franck D Minor Symphony). As he helps her climb up, CAMERA PANS with them and shows the expanse of the Bowl below, a packed audience, and the orchestra on the lighted shell. \nThey sit down on the grass. Neff sits near her, not too close. It is very dark and they are silhouetted against the shell lights. Neff puts a cigarette in his mouth and strikes a match. The flame lights up Lola's face. Neff glances at her. She is crying. He lights his cigarette and blows out the match. A pause follows. \nNEFF Why are you crying? \nLola doesn't answer. \nNEFF You won't tell me? \nLOLA (In a choked voice) Of course I will, Walter. I wouldn't tell anybody else but you. It's about Nino. \nNEFF Zachetti? What about him? \nLOLA They killed my father together. He and Phyllis. He helped her do it. I know he did. \nNEFF What makes you say that? \nLOLA I've been following him. He's at her house, night after night. It was Phyllis and him all the time. Maybe he was going with me just for a blind. And the night of the murder -- \nNEFF You promised not to talk that way any more. \nLOLA -- he was supposed to pick me up after a lecture at U.C.L.A. -- but he never showed up. He said he was sick. Sick! He couldn't show up, because the train was leaving with my father on it. \nShe begins to cry again. \nLOLA Maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe it's all just in my mind. \nNEFF Sure, it's all in your mind. \nLOLA I only wish it was, Walter, because I still love him. \nOver Neff's face, as he listens to the music, comes the commentary. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nD-13 LOBBY OF PACIFIC BLDG. (DAY) \nNEFF'S VOICE Zachetti. That's funny. Phyllis and Zachetti. What was he doing up at her house? I couldn't figure that one out I tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere. But the real brain-twister came the next day. You sprang it on me, Keyes, after office hours, when you caught me down in the lobby of the building. \nAbout 5:00 P.M. or a little later. A stream of office employees is coming out of an elevator; a second elevator reaches the lobby and some more office employees come out, among them Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase. \nCAMERA PRECEDES HIM as he walks toward the entrance doors. He is stopped by Keyes' voice, off to one side. \nKEYES' VOICE Oh, Walter, just a minute. \nNeff stops and looks towards the cigar counter, as he moves towards him. Keyes is standing there buying cigars. He is stuffing them into his pockets. \nNEFF Hello, Keyes. \nKEYES Hang onto your hat, Walter. \nNEFF What for? \nKEYES Nothing much. The Dietrichson case just busted wide open. \nNEFF How do you mean? \nKEYES The guy showed. That's how. \nNEFF The somebody else? \nKEYES Yeah. The guy that did it with her. \nNEFF No kidding? \nKEYES She's filed suit against us, and it's okay by me. When we get into that courtroom I'll tear them apart, both of them. Come on -- I'll buy you a martini. \nNEFF No thanks, Keyes. \nKEYES With two olives. \nNEFF I've got to get a shave and a shoeshine. I've got a date. \nKEYES Margie. I still bet she drinks from the bottle. \n", "test2_true": "NEFF They give you matches when they sell you cigars, Keyes. All you have to do is ask for them. \nKEYES I don't like them. They always explode in my pockets. So long, Walter. \nKeyes goes toward the street and OUT OF SCENE. Neff moves back into the lobby, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. As he reaches the elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure Keyes is gone, then steps into the empty elevator. \nNEFF'S VOICE You sure had me worried, Keyes. I didn't know if you were playing cat- and-mouse with me, whether you knew all along I was the somebody else. That's what I had to find out, and I thought I knew where to look... \nNEFF (To elevator operator) Twelve. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nD-14 ENTRANCE - OFFICE. 12TH FLOOR RECEPTION ROOM (DAY) \nNeff comes out of the elevator. The receptionist is just tidying up her desk. She has her hat on and is preparing to leave. Neff passes on through the swinging doors to the twelfth floor balcony. \nNEFF'S VOICE Upstairs, the last of the people were just leaving. \nD-15 12TH FLOOR BALCONY \nNeff enters from the reception room. A couple of belated employees are leaving for the day. Neff goes toward Keyes' office, looks around to make sure he is unobserved, enters. \nNEFF'S VOICE I made sure nobody saw me go into your office. \nD-16 KEYES' OFFICE (DAY) \nNeff has just come in. He goes over to Keyes' desk and searches the papers on it. He tries the desk drawers and finds them locked. His eye falls on the dictaphone on the stand beside the desk. A record is on it, the needle is about two-thirds of the way towards the end. He lifts the needle and sets it back to the beginning of the record, sets the switch to playback position. He lifts the arm off the bracket and starts the machine. Keyes' voice is heard coming from the horn: \nKEYES' VOICE (From Dictaphone) Memo to Mr. Norton. Confidential. Dietrichson File. With regard to your proposal to put Walter Neff under surveillance, I disagree absolutely. I have investigated his movements on the night of the crime, and he is definitely placed in his apartment from 7:15 P.M. on. In addition to this, I have known Neff intimately for eleven years, and I personally vouch for him, without reservation... \nNeff stops the machine. He sits down slowly, still holding the horn. He is deeply moved. After a moment, he presses the switch again. \nKEYES' VOICE (From Dictaphone) ...Furthermore, no connection whatsoever has been established between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson, whereas I am now able to report that such a connection has been established between her and another man. This man has been observed to visit the Dietrichson home on the night of July 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th. We have succeeded in identifying him as one Nino Zachetti, former medical student, aged twenty-eight, residing at Lilac Court Apartments 1228\u00bd N. La Brea Avenue. We have checked Zachetti's movements on the night of the crime and have found that they cannot be accounted for. I am preparing a more detailed report for your consideration and it is my belief that we already have sufficient evidence against Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson to justify police action. I strongly urge that this whole matter be turned over to the office of the District Attorney. Respectfully, Barton Keyes. \nNeff sits, staring blankly at the wall. The cylinder goes on revolving, but no more voice comes -- only the whir of the needle on the empty record. At last he remembers to replace the horn. He hangs it back on its hook. The machine stops. Neff gets up from the chair, walks slowly to the door and goes out. \nD-17 12TH FLOOR, BALCONY \nNeff has just come out of Keyes' office. He walks slowly back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there looking out through the glass doors. All the employees have now left. Neff is entirely alone. He moves as if to go out, then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of a sudden idea. He turns quickly and walks on to his own office and enters. \nD-18 NEFF'S OFFICE (DAY) \nNeff walks across to his desk, lifts the telephone and dials a number. (During the ensuing telephone conversation, only what he says is heard. The pauses indicate speeches at the other end of the line). \nNEFF Phyllis? Walter. I've got to see you... Tonight... Yes, it has to be tonight... How's eleven o'clock? Don't worry about Keyes. He's satisfied... Leave the door on the latch and put the lights out. No, nobody's watching the house... I told you Keyes is satisfied. It's just for the neighbors... That's what I said. Yeah. Eleven o'clock. Goodbye, baby. \nNeff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim expression on his face, takes a handkerchief out and wipes perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands. The gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to wipe away the murder. Over his face comes the commentary. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nNEFF'S VOICE I guess I don't have to tell you what I was going to do at eleven o'clock, Keyes. For the first time I saw a way to get clear of the whole mess I was in, and of Phyllis, too, all at the same time. Yeah, that's what I thought. But what I didn't know was that she was all set for me. That she had outsmarted me again, just like she always had... \nD-19 HALL STAIRWAY OF DIETRICHSON HOME (NIGHT) \nThe lights are turned on. Phyllis is coming down the stairs. She wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right hand. She reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. She switches off the porch light and the hall light. She moves towards the living room, where there is still light on. \nNEFF'S VOICE She was all set and waiting for me. It could have been something in my voice when I called her up that tipped her off. And it could have been that she had the idea already. And an idea wasn't the only thing she had waiting for me. \nD-20 LIVING ROOM \nOn the long table behind the davenport, one of the lamps is lit. The only other light in the room is a standing lamp beside the desk. A window toward the back is open, and through it comes the SOUNDS OF MUSIC, probably a neighboring radio. \nPhyllis enters and crosses to the table. She puts out the lamp, then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp there. The room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at the windows. \nPhyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace (the one she sat in the first time Neff came to the house). She lifts the loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it. As she withdraws the scarf, there is a brief glint of something metallic before she covers the hidden object with the cushion again. \nShe turns to the low table in front of the davenport and takes a cigarette from the box. She takes a match and is about to strike it when, just then, she hears a car coming up the hill. She listens, motionless. The car stops. A car door is slammed. \nCalmly, Phyllis strikes the match and lights her cigarette. She drops the match casually into a tray, goes back to the chair, sits down and waits, quietly smoking. There are footsteps outside the house. \nOver the chair in which Phyllis is sitting, the hallway is visible through the arch. The front door opens. Neff comes in, he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he stands there. He closes the door again. \nPHYLLIS (In foreground) In here, Walter. \nNeff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards her. \nNEFF Hello, baby. Anybody else in the house? \nPHYLLIS Nobody. Why? \nNEFF What's that music? \nPHYLLIS A radio up the street. \nNeff sits down on the arm of the davenport, close to her. \nNEFF Just like the first time I was here. We were talking about automobile insurance. Only you were thinking about murder. And I was thinking about that anklet. \n", "test3_input": "PHYLLIS And what are you thinking about now? \nNEFF I'm all through thinking. This is goodbye. \nPHYLLIS Goodbye? Where are you going? \nNEFF It's you that's going, baby. Not me. I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner. \nPHYLLIS Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is. \nNEFF I have a friend who's got a funny theory. He says when two people commit a murder they're kind of on a trolley car, and one can't get off without the other. They're stuck with each other. They have to go on riding clear to the end of the line. And the last stop is the cemetery. \nPHYLLIS Maybe he's got something there. \nNEFF You bet he has, Two people are going to ride to the end of the line, all right. Only I'm not going to be one of them. I've got another guy to finish my ride for me. \nPHYLLIS So you've got it all arranged, Walter. \nNEFF You arranged it for me. I didn't have to do a thing. \nPHYLLIS Just who are you talking about? \nNEFF An acquaintance of yours. A Mr. Zachetti. Come on, baby, I just got into this because I knew a little something about insurance, didn't I? I was just a sucker. I'd have been brushed-off as soon as you got your hands on the money. \nPHYLLIS What are you talking about? \nNEFF Save it. I'm telling this. It's been you and that Zachetti guy all along, hasn't it? \nPHYLLIS That's not true. \nNEFF It doesn't make any difference whether it's true or not. The point is Keyes believes Zachetti is the guy he's been looking for. He'll have him in that gas chamber before he knows what happened to him. \nPHYLLIS And what's happening to me all this time? \nNEFF Don't be silly. What do you expect to happen to you? You helped him do the murder, didn't you? That's what Keyes thinks. And what's good enough for Keyes is good enough for me. \nPHYLLIS Maybe it's not good enough for me. Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea. Maybe I'd rather talk. \nNEFF Sometimes people are where they can't talk. Under six feet of dirt, for instance. And if it was you, they'd just charge it up to Zachetti, wouldn't they. One more item on his account. Sure they would. That's just what they're going to do. Especially since he's coming here, tonight... Oh, in about fifteen minutes from now, baby. With the cops right behind him. It's all taken care of. \nPHYLLIS And that'd make everything lovely for you, wouldn't it? \nNEFF Right. And it's got to be done before that suit of yours comes to trial, and Lola gets a chance to sound off, and they trip you up on the stand, and you start to fold up and drag me down with you. \nPHYLLIS Listen, Walter. Maybe I had Zachetti here so they won't get a chance to trip me up. So we can get that money and be together. \nNEFF That's cute. Say it again. \nPHYLLIS He came here the first time just to ask where Lola was. I made him come back. I was working on him. He's crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered. I kept hammering into him that she was with another man, so he'd get into one of his jealous rages, and then I'd tell him where she was. And you know what he'd have done to her, don't you, Walter. \nNEFF Yeah, and for once I believe you. Because it's just rotten enough. \nPHYLLIS We're both rotten, Walter. \nNEFF Only you're just a little more rotten. You're rotten clear through. You got me to take care of your husband, and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola, and maybe take care of me too, and then somebody else would have come along to take care of Zachetti for you. That's the way you operate isn't it, baby. \nPHYLLIS Suppose it is, Walter. Is what you've cooked up for tonight any better? \nNeff gets up from the davenport. He listens to the music for a moment. \nNEFF I don't like this music anymore. It's too close. Do you mind if I shut the window? \nPhyllis just stares at him. He goes quietly over to the window and shuts it and draws the curtain. Phyllis speaks to his back: \nPHYLLIS (Her voice low and urgent) Walter! \nNeff turns, something changes in his face. There is the report of a gun. He stands motionless for a moment, then very slowly starts towards her. CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER HIS SHOULDER at Phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand. Neff stops after he has taken a few steps. \nNEFF What's the matter? Why don't you shoot again? Maybe if I came a little closer? \nNeff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again. \nNEFF How's that. Do you think you can do it now? \nPhyllis is silent. She doesn't shoot. Her expression is tortured. Neff goes on until he is close to her. Quietly he takes the gun out of her unresisting hand. \nNEFF Why didn't you shoot, baby? \nPhyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender. \nNEFF Don't tell me it's because you've been in love with me all this time. \nPHYLLIS No. I never loved you, Walter. Not you, or anybody else. I'm rotten to the heart. I used you, just as you said. That's all you ever meant to me -- until a minute ago. I didn't think anything like that could ever happen to me. \nNEFF I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying. \nPHYLLIS I'm not asking you to buy. Just hold me close. \n", "test3_true": "NEFF Goodbye, baby. \nOut of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp against his shoulder. Slowly he lifts her and carries her to the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat and it comes out with blood on it. Only then is it apparent that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly goes out of the room, the way he came. \nD-21 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT) \nNeff comes out of the house. He closes the front door with his right hand. His left arm hangs limp. He takes a few steps down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. He moves behind the palm tree near the walk. \nA man comes up the steps towards the front door -- Zachetti. Just as he reaches the door, Neff calls to him. \nNEFF Hey you. Come here a minute. I said come here, Zachetti. \nZachetti turns and approaches him slowly. \nNEFF The name is Neff. \nZACHETTI Yeah? And I still don't like it. What do you want? \nNEFF Look, kid, I want to give you a present. \nHe takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a coin. \nNEFF Here's a nice new nickel. \nZACHETTI What's the gag? \nNEFF Suppose you go back down the hill to a drug store and make a phone call. \nNeff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away. \nZACHETTI Keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice cream cone. \nNEFF The number is Granite 0386. Ask for Miss Dietrichson. The first name is Lola. \nZACHETTI Lola? She isn't worth a nickel. And if I ever talk to her, it's not going to be over any telephone. \nNEFF Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel. Take it and call her. She wants you to. \nZACHETTI Yeah? She doesn't want any part of me. \nNEFF I know who told you that, and it's not true. She's in love with you. Always has been. Don't ask me why. I couldn't even guess. \nZachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him to do it. \nNEFF Now beat it. Granite 0386, I told you. \nHe motions toward the street below. \nNEFF That way. \nZachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot. The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him. Then, far off in the distance, the SIREN OF A POLICE CAR is heard. \nNeff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where he parked his car. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nD-22 NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT) \nThe desk lamp is still lighted. Outside the windows, the dawn is slowly breaking. \nNeff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. There are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him. A widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his gray jacket. He is very weak by now, and his voice holds a note of utter exhaustion. \nNEFF It's almost four-thirty now, Keyes. It's cold. I wonder if she's still lying there alone in that house, or whether they've found her by now. I wonder a lot of things, but they don't matter any more, except I want to ask you to do me a favor. I want you to be the one to tell Lola, kind of gently, before it breaks wide open... Yes, and I'd like you to look after her and that guy Zachetti, so he doesn't get pushed around too much. Because... \nSuddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling that he is not alone in the room. \nAs he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly. The office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the room over Keyes' shoulder. \nSlowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes reaches back and pushes the door shut. \nNeff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly. \nNEFF Hello, Keyes. \nKeyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without answering. \nNEFF Up pretty early, aren't you? I always wondered what time you got down to work. \nKeyes, staring at him, still does not answer. \nNEFF Or did your little man pull you out of bed? \nKEYES The janitor did. Seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here. \nNEFF Wouldn't be surprised. \nNeff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing on the desk. \n"}

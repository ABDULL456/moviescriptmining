KATE How do I look? 
Leopold and Charlie stand. Kate poses in the gown picked out by Leopold. Leopold smiles brightly. 
LEOPOLD You look exquisite, Katherine. 
KATE (almost sadly) Thank you, Leopold. 
She looks at Leopold not knowing what to say. Finally 
CHARLIE This is a tie I'm wearing. 
KATE You look very nice, Charlie. 
CHARLIE Yes. I know. 
The doorbell rings. 
KATE That must be him. 
LEOPOLD Your bland date? 
KATE Blind date. 
CHARLIE Remember to breathe, Kate. And don't use to many big words. You'll scare the poor slob away. 
KATE (moving to the door) This is always the scary part. (she sings) "Open the door to my, Mystery Date." 
She opens the door and looks straight up. Leopold and Charlie peer in closer to get a better look. In the doorway stands LARRY, great looking, very tall, a winner. 
LARRY Hi. Kate? 
KATE Larry? 
Kate turns back to the others with a frozen smile. 
KATE Well, I'm off. 
LEOPOLD (giving Larry the once over) Kate, may I have a word with you? 
KATE Now? 
LEOPOLD Yes. (as they cross the room) I DON'T like the look of him. 
KATE What are you talking about? 
LEOPOLD Cad. I can spot one a mile away. (he helps her with her coat) I shall escort you out myself. I will act as your chaperone. 
KATE That isn't necessary. I'll be fine. 
LEOPOLD It is no trouble. 
KATE Goodnight, Leopold. 
LEOPOLD But... 
KATE Goodnight. 
She is gone. Leopold stares after her, dejected. 
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT 
Kate and Larry are led to their table. Larry sits down. Kate remains standing. 
LARRY (friendly) Sit down. 
KATE (sighs) Thank you. (she sits) 
LARRY So. How am I doing? 
KATE I beg your pardon? 
LARRY How am I doing? First date. You pleased? You disappointed? 
KATE Undecided. 
LARRY I see. 
He snaps his fingers to get the waiters attention startling Kate. She laughs nervously. 
LARRY So. What did Jeannie say about me?

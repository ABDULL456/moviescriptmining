Valerian wrestles the amulet away from Galen. It falls to the ground. 
VALERIAN You heard what he said. 
She lifts the chunk of stone. Galen grabs for it. 
GALEN No! You can't! 
THE LAST ATTACK 
Vermithrax spirals up into the storm, then drops earthward. Ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him. He folds his arms and bows his head. Leathery wings humming, the creature levels out, swoops up past the crag and lifts the master magician away in its huge hind claw. 
ULRICH Galen! 
Galen and Valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip. As the monstrous thing flies high over them, they can hear Ulrich's faint screams. 
DEATH 
Now Galen understands. He seizes the granite block from Valerian and raises it with both hands over his head. He takes a final look at the amulet, glowing at his feet, then brings the rock down with all his might. There is a blinding flash as it shatters into a million fragments. 
Far above there is another blinding flash as Ulrich's earthly body explodes against the belly of the beast. The darkened sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the dragon's gut. Wings fluttering uselessly, this reptilian torch plummets to the ground. 
LAKE 
Below, a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures. Trailing a wake of flame, Vermithrax plunges like a comet into the water. There is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam. 
GALEN & VALERIAN 
They stare down from their lofty perch, watching as further explosions boil the water from the pond. 
ECLIPSE 
Behind a tattered wrack of cloud, the moon slowly uncovers a pale sun. 
DISSOLVE: 
THE CARCASS - DAY 
Grey misty light reveals the beast's mangled remains. Galen and Valerian emerge from the fog, walk under a blackened wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to the huge charred head. The death agony has twisted it upside down. The mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise. The eyes are glazed. Now the sound of voices floats toward them, chanting an ancient hymn. A moment later a mob of Christians, led by Greil, crests a hill and moves toward the hulk. The song ends. 
GREIL Let us pray. 
The members of the congregation fall to their knees. 
GREIL We thank thee, Lord, for this divine deliverance. Verily is thy presence amongst us, fully manifest in this, thy great work. 
Galen and Valerian look at each other. She takes his hand. 
GREIL Arise, children of the Lord and forsake evermore the pagan mysteries. Rejoice in the true power of the Christian God! 
Galen turns and leads Valerian away. They disappear into the mist.

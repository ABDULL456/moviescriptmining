CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY \nA monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant. Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough. At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds flat. \nANGLE \nRight now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white intern's coat from his paper bag. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CEDARS-SINAI CORRIDOR - TRAVELING TWO SHOT - DAY \nWe DOLLY on Neil as he crosses through the long crowded corridor. Patients, nurses, interns and doctors pass by. A P.A. broadcasts occasional messages. \nPROFILE \nNail crosses under an \"EMERGENCY\" sign and keeps going towards the exit doors. \nTRAVELING - FRONTAL \nNeil APPROACHES THE CAMERA. From the other direction two ambulance attendants wheel an old man under oxygen and pass by Neil. \nCUT TO: \nWIDE REAR SHOT \nWithout breaking his stride from the moment he got off the bus, Neil exits through the doors, examines four ambulances parked in the slots, climbs into one and drives off. Maybe he's stolen it. We don't know. \nCUT TO: \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org            2. \nEXT. R & C CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES - ON CHRIS - DAY \nCHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red, Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves. He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made. Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to 1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and the Clerk exit to the sales counter. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SALES COUNTER - TWO SHOT \nAs they approach, the Clerk goes behind it. \nCLERK What you working on? \nCHRIS Drillin' some post holes into concrete ... \nCLERK (re: toolcase) With that you can ream solid steel.

He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a \"cowboy\": his natural inclination towards a score is \"...get the guns and let's go.\" He's been off smack and everything else for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you were talking about. \nCLOSE OR DOLL HOUSE DETAILS \nIt's 3 x 6 and two feet high. Miniature room sets are inside. Cerrito's thick fingers close the door. He picks it up. WIDEN. He crosses to a counter and MIDDLE-AGED CLERK. \nCERRITO Wrap this here up. \nCLERK Yessir. You're going to have a happy little girl. \nCERRITO Two.   I got two girls. \nCLERK That's nice. \nCERRITO Yeah.

The driver staggers out   from behind the wheel and tries to shake clarity into his   head. He sits on the pavement. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAX PARKING LOT - WIDE BETWEEN THE CARS - DAY \nPlanes ROAR overhead in landings or takeoffs. Yellow vapor lamps glare. It's gaudy with lights. Neil and a man named NATE are parked next to each other facing opposite directions. Nate's 50 - an ex-prize fighter with his nose all over his face in a silver Mercedes. His big muscles have gone to flab. He wears a yellow rayon shirt. He's deeply tanned and pock-narked. \nNate functions as a middleman and fence for Neil. All calls from people who want to contact Neil come to Nate. Right now he examines the manila envelope from the armored truck.

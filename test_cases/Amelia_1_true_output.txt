Through a window, a dry, wintered garden. Snow falling, at once soft and heavy. Beyond, Morgan Point Lighthouse, Fisher's Island Sound, Long Island Sound. One lonely fishing boat braves the cold water. PULL BACK to see... ...Amelia at the breakfast table in a windowed room.     She is writing, and as she does... 
S 
UPERIMPOSE:    WEDDING DAY.   CONNECTICUT, 1931. ...her eyes are swimming with tears.     She brushes at them. Stares down at her work. Continues. ANGLE. The parlor. George, his MOTHER, the MINISTER, a small number of close FRIENDS. From the doorway, Amelia beckons George. The letter is in her hand. 
EXT. HOME - MOMENTS LATER 
Amelia holds tight to George's hand, leading him out into the falling snow. She turns, fixes him with a look. Hands him the letter. And steps back. As if giving him space. At first, he smiles. What is this? She gestures for him to read. As he begins, there is nothing for a few seconds. Then... 
AMELIA (V.O.) ...I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me. Nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly. Snow falling.    Absolute silence. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) If we can be honest I think the difficulties which may arise may best be avoided should you or I become interested deeply, or in passing, with anyone else. She gazes intently, her heart in her eyes.     He never looks up. 
M 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Please let us not interfere with the other's work or play, nor let the world see our private joys or disagreements. And then... 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
I must exact a cruel promise. And that is you will let me go in a year if we find no happiness together. He stops on this.    His thoughts unreadable. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I will try to do my best in every way. And give you that part of me you know and seem to want. He folds the letter carefully.    Places it in his pocket.       And smiles. 
GEORGE y Amelia. Brutal in her frank- ness. Beautiful in her honesty. He steps to her.    Looks in her eyes.   They kiss. 
INT. PARLOR - LATER 
LONG ANGLE. The minister reading the vows. The witnesses standing silent. Two black cats rubbing against George's ankles. 
DISSOLVE TO... 
INT. KITCHEN, RYE - MORNING 
George at the breakfast table. His eggs and toast ignored for the moment, he's reading a magazine article. PAN to Amelia, sipping her coffee. Watching him. GEORGE (reads aloud) `Why I Believe Women Pilots Can't Fly The Atlantic. An outspoken warning by Lady Heath.' 
(READING) `...pure suicide for any woman today...it is madness for them to attempt it and...' He looks up to her. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) `...at least the first dozen will be drowned.' And we're reading 
A this, because...? 
MELIA I might fly to Paris. Silence. 
GEORGE Which is actually across the Atlantic. 
AMELIA Hence, the article. Ah.   He nods. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) I'm thinking of doing it solo. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Would you mind? He butters his toast. 
GEORGE Not at all. When would you like to go? 
EXT. GARDEN, RYE - DAY 
CLOSE on Amelia as she kneels, carefully putting new plants into the ground. We see patience, concentration. Contentment. After a moment... 
AMELIA I'm surprised you're all right with this... WIDEN ANGLE.     George kneeling beside her.   Happily planting his own. 
GEORGE Really. 
AMELIA Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the lecture. Five years since Lindbergh, no one's made it solo, so many of them died. He looks at her work. Reaches over. Starts packing the earth HARDER around her plant. She just watches, then... 
D 
W 
GEORGE ell, they were only men.   This is different. She reaches to his plant and starts LOOSENING the soil... 
AMELIA I was waiting to hear that I'm only doing this because I was just a passenger last time, and I'd rather die than go on living as a fraud.. No one cracks a smile. It's like Laurel and Hardy in a food fight where each lets the other take his best shot. George

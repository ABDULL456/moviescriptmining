THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Accepted. 
They continue breathing... 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Ready? 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Yes. 
The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle each other for their final attack. 
With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall... 
...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their Samurai hearts out... 
UNTIL... 
They both SWING... 
...can't tell who got who... 
A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in the white snow. 
CU O-REN ISHII facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops. The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just ended with one swing, stares off into space. 
O-REN (ENGLISH) That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword... 
Her sword FALLS from her grip...in the snow by her feet. 
O-REN (ENGLISH) I always dreamed of owning one... 
O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward. 
Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says; 
O-REN (ENGLISH) Did he make it for you? 
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Yes. 
The Last thing she says before she dies; 
O-REN (ENGLISH) ...He must of liked you. 
With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and she's gone. 
The BRIDE removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list, off her Hanzo Steel. 
EX CU THE HANZO SWORD 
is returned back to its sheath. The LION'S HEAD that Hanzo carved into the wood seems pleased. 
CUT TO: 
The BRIDE now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT. 
SOFIE FATALE Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO. 
The BRIDE slams the trunk, SCREEN BOES BLACK... 
The MAZDA driving down the road at supersonic speed. 
The BRIDE behind the wheel wearing her crash helmet. It looks like an insert from "GRAND PRIX." 
POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD car speeding...then stopping. 
BLACK SCREEN The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly Viper syringe in her hand. 
When she speaks it comes out of a VOICE BOX at the bottom of the helmet. Turning her voice deeper and electronically spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) I've kept you alive for one reason. Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer, I take it you're familiar with Bill? 
SOFIE (JAPANESE) Yes. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) In fact, I'd guesstimate, you worked for Bill before O-Ren, and that's how it is you came to work for O-Ren. Am I correct? 
SOFIE (JAPANESE) Yes. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) I thought so. Give me the arm you have left. 
SOFIE (JAPANESE) Why? 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) I want information. Now gimme your arm. 
Sofie offers up her remaining arm. 
She injects Sofie with the gold syringe. 
THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE) The cocktail racing    through your bloodstream at this    moment is Bill's own recipe.    He calls it "The Undisputed Truth." 
Sofie is injected. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Okay, first things first. Where was the other Yubari sister? Yuki? 
SOFIE (JAPANESE) Yuki's sick. She went home early. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Do tell? What's wrong with her? 
SOFIE (JAPANESE) She has a cold. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Awwww poor baby. What do you think she'll do when she finds out what happened? 
SOFIE (JAPANESE) 
She'll wail with grief. 
SHOCK CUT TO 
YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death... 
She SCREAMS! 
BACK TO SOFIE 
SOFIE She'll drink excessively. 
BACK TO YUKI Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up. 
BACK TO SOFIE 
SOFIE She'll start trouble. 
BACK TO YUKI sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the make on her. 
BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE) Do you like Ferraris? 
Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice; 
YUKI (JAPANESE) Ferrari...Italian trash. 
She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the business suit. 
YUKI (JAPANESE) Do you find me hot? 
The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she gets annoyed; 
YUKI (JAPANESE) Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck me, yes or no? 
BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE) Yes. 
THEN... 
He lets out a GRUNT coming from below. 
We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen, creating a big red grin across his mid-section.

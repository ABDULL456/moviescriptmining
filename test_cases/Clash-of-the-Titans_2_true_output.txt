VERDANDI You've brought a thief into our nest! 
URD A villain! 
SKULD Scum! 
AMOUN No, good Sisters... the son of Zeus. The Strix react in horror and all land on the same monolith. 
PERSEUS Since you cannot see, let me tell you what's about to happen. I'm about to throw this evil Eye to the rocks far below. I fear its journey will be a taxing one. The members of the Expedition are impressed; Vidalia, too: the young demigod shows growing leadership. The Strix are panicked -- 
URD We can't tell you. We don't dare betray Tiamat again. 
VERDANDI She sees all! Her touch is felt in every evil thing! 
SKULD A second offense and she will 
DESTROY USL 
PERSEUS You don't have to tell us the secret. But you will have to live as blind as she made you. 
SKULD No! Give us the Eye and we'll tell. 
PERSEUS Tell me first. If I like the answer, you get your Eye. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VERDANDI We need the Eye to see the answer! 
AMOUN You know the answer sure as you already knew the question. The Norn Sisters confer, enclosed in a curtain of wings. 
THEN -- 
SKULD Leviathan can be destroyed... 
VERDANDI The beast has one weakness. 
SPYROS Tell us now! The Strix are torn, frightened. Finally -- 
URD The stare of Medusa. No creature can look directly in her eyes and still survive. The answer hangs in the silence of the stunned Expedition. 
AMOUN They're lying, Perseus. Perseus studies the Sisters, weighing his response. 
PERSEUS I believe them. (tosses the Eye high) Here's your second sight. Verdandi launches and catches it in her beak, pops it in her socket. 
PERSEUS (to the Norns) And Medusa! Where does she abide? 
SKULD In Tartaros, beyond the frozen Tethys Sea. Only Charon's ferry dare challenge the ice. 
PERSEUS How can she be slain? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VERDANDI With extraordinary cunning and unimaginable luck. Skuld flaps to the pitch-black portal to an UNDERGROUND 
VAULT. 
SKULD And the proper tools. Explore our cache of spoils. You may find such a tool. Perseus stares into the black entrance. 
DRACO Don't go in there, Perseus. It's a trap. 
VERDANDI No. We have guaranteed the rage of Tiamat with this revelation... 
SKULD . we ask only that the young God mention our aid... 
URD ... to his Father. 
PERSEUS

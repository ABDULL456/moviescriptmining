ANGLE: FROM ABOVE- 
we see Ripley crawling toward the hatch, and the huge outer airlock door opening beneath the ship.  Blue sky and wind the screen below. 
ANGLE: RIPLEY 
Struggling to get to the hatch. 
RIPLEY 
God'... 
And above her, through a window into the docking bay, we see the newborn appear. 
CUT TO: INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS 
CALL 
Almost there... 
JOHNER 
We got about forty seconds till we kiss the ground! 
Go full thrust on the downdraft!  We'llget clear! 
JOHNER 
It's gonna be fucking close. 
CALL\SHIP 
Warning.  Procedural interruption.  Ship not leveling for vertical drop.  Braking 
system nonfunctional.  Collision imminent. 
JOHNER 
No shit. 
CALL 
Almost there. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS 
The airlock doors are almost.. completely open.  Ripley has reached the hatch, but cannot get it open.  She pounds on it frustration -- and the newborn SMASHES through the window, 
JUMPS DOWN onto the ship. 
RIPLEY 
NOO!!  NOOO! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BETRY - CONTINUOUS 
CALL 
NOW!!! 
Vriess punches it 
CUT TO: 
INT.  AIRLOCK\EXT.  SKY CONTINUOUS 
and the Betty SHOOTS DOWN out of the airlock -- Ripley and the newborn just barely hold on, Ripley's body thrown straight up as she grips the hatch door for dear life. 
The newborn has a better grip -- it has more things to grip with but it too struggles with the sudden drop. 
ANGLE: THE ATJRIGA 
Speeding toward the earth.  The Betty SHOOTS out the airlock and nearly smashes into the bottom of the ship as it passes, like trash thrown out of a speeding car. 
INT.  BETTY 
The Akiriga passes, huge above them 
VRIESS 
Look out! 
CALL 
I am! 
EXT.  THE BETTY 
The ship swerves as Call expertly avoids the Auriga -- and see Ripley and the newborn on top, still fighting for purchase 
The Betty gets clear, leveling out -- 
The Auriga still heads straight for earth, as the terrain below becomes clear - 
- deserted, snow covered mountains 
ANGLE: RIPLEY 
Hanging on 
ANGLE: CALL 
Fighting to control the Betty 
ANGLE:	INSIDE THE AURIGA 
Deserted halls, passageways bodies, and,aliens milling here and there 
CALL\SHIP 
Collision in six seconds ... five... four... 
(softly) 
Here we go... 
ANGLE: THE ATJRIGA 
SMASHES INTO THE GROUND, a deafening exposion eating the massive ship in seconds, utter cacophony. 
ANGLE: THE BETTY 
Flying away, the thundering firestorm behind it. 
ANGLE: CALL 
An instrument panel suddenly SPARKS beside her warning lights flash, the ship shaking as if under massive turbulence 
CALL 
Johner!  Fire! 
VRIESS 
Vector control's fucked! we gotta put down! 
CALL 
Find me a path!

CLAIRE stands before the Core. She is naked. Her skin is pale and beautiful and cold and wet. Her hair hangs in her face, covering her milk-white eyes... 
INT. STUDIO APARTMENT 
Claire stands naked before the bathroom mirror. Behind her, the tub steams... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - (SEX AND SUICIDE INTERCUT) 
Weir stares at Claire in shock. She walks to him. Slowly. 
She stops in front of him. Her arms hang at her sides. He must reach for her. 
He does, putting his hands on her hips. He slides from his chair to the floor to his knees. He presses his face to her pale belly and cries. SOBS wrack his body... 
INT. STUDIO APARTMENT 
...and in the bathroom, she clutches Weir's straight-razor... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT 
She reaches down. Slowly, her arms cradle his head. She slides down on him. Straddles him. 
INT. STUDIO APARTMENT 
...Claire slips into the steaming water... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT 
He raises his head to her breasts. His eyes, closed. She remains unnaturally still, only her hips rocking back and forth. 
Weir's mouth opens, GASPS as he enters her... 
INT. STUDIO APARTMENT 
...and the razor bites her skin... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT 
She caresses his face. Lifts his face to hers. Her mouth is slack. Her hair hangs in front of her eyes. 
INT. STUDIO APARTMENT 
...Claire floats dead in the red water, eyes open, hair billowing around her head like a halo... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT 
Weir gazes up at her, transfixed. He takes her hand and raises it to his face. She caresses his cheek. And reaches for his eyes... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT 
A MUFFLED SCREAM rips through the Second Containment Seal. It begins as a human sound and ends as something else, an alien CRY of rage. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS 
The CRY echoes down the Main Corridor. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE 
Starck GASPS as the CRY resounds through the bridge. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION 
Cooper examines the weld on the baffle plate. It's solid. 
COOPER Solid as a rock. (into his radio) Hey, Smith... 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK 
COOPER (O.S.) (intercom) Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in. 
SMITH Roger that. 
Smith carries another load of supplies. Movement out of the corner of his eye... 
He turns in time to see Weir disappear around a corner inside the Event Horizon. 
SMITH Dr. Weir! Hey, get your ass back on board! Dr. Weir! 
No response. 
Smith keys the radio. 
SMITH Skipper, come in... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS 
Miller jogs down the Main Corridor. An INTERCOM gets his attention: 
SMITH (O.S.) (intercom) Skipper... 
MILLER (into intercom) What is it, Smith?

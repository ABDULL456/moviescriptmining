{"test1_input": "Galt makes like he's handing the plant to Keltner, who reaches for it, and as he does Galt slowly stands up making Keltner reach and reach and reach... and as Keltner gets closer and closer, Galt stands to his fullest height... making it literally impossible for Keltner to get it... Franz, Ludwig, Adolf, Herman and the Stout Prisoner (more than likely provoked by Helmut's stand, now circle Galt)... \nGALT (still holding the plant up high) Go on, little man, reach for it! \nKeltner, torn between seeing that Helmut is alright, and getting his plant back, tries to get it, and still looks to see that Helmut isn't hurt too bad... \nHERMAN (in a low menacing voice) Give it to him! \nGalt looks at him with a menacing stare... \nADOLF You heard him... give it to him! \nFRANZ You've had your fun... give it to him... NOW! \nSTOUT PRISONER (closing in on Galt) RIGHT NOW!! \nGalt realizes this is no time for a showdown... and with a childlike smile... grits his teeth... \nGALT Sure, here's your stupid flower or whatever you call it... \nKeltner takes it from him. \nKELTNER Thank you... \nKeltner leans down and picks Helmut up and walks him to his bunk, helps him onto it, and puts the plant on his own bunk... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe four men:  Ludwig, Adolf, Franz and Herman stay with Galt, as does the Stout Prisoner... They are clustered around Galt. \nGALT What's the matter with you guys? Can't you take a joke? \nADOLF What joke? \nGALT Hell, all I was doing was trying to have a little fun. \nLUDWIG Have it with someone else! \nGALT What's so special about him? \nADOLF That's the Reverend.  Even when they came and dragged him from his church...  he kept right on preaching against them until they knocked him unconscious. \nGalt is silent for a beat. \nGALT Well, how the hell was I supposed to know? \nHERMAN NOW you know! \nGalt shoves his way through the five men and walks beaten, for the moment, to his own bunk... as the men disperse and walk back to their respective bunks... \nCLOSE - GALT AND UHLMANN \nGalt walks over and sits at the edge of his bunk, while Uhlmann swings his legs back and forth from his perched position on the top of his bunk... Galt gives him a stare... \nGALT You and your posies... \nUHLMANN That was close... \nGALT Where were you when I need you? \nUHLMANN I make love, not war! (goes giggly over what he just said) Hey, that's pretty good... I made that up... Make love, not war!  I bet that would make a good slogan someday... \nGALT Aw, shut up! \nAnd he smacks his legs up and onto the bunk. \nTWO SHOT - KELTNER AND HELMUT \nKeltner with a wet towel in his hand cleaning the blood- dripping mouth of Helmut... \nKELTNER That was really very nice of you, Helmut... \nHELMUT Yeah, nice and STUPID! \nHelmut grabs the towel and throws it to the floor and turns on his side away from Keltner.  Keltner bends down, gets the towel, sits on the edge of his bunk... looks up, wonders and ponders Helmut as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT \nThe door to Barracks H slowly opens and Helmut peeks through the opening to see that all is clear... he slips out and walks along the dark, dreary alleyway towards the Guard's shack... he moves like a prisoner trying to miss the spotlights in a jail break... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHelmut gets to the Guards hut... he looks into the window, and sees the Guard he wants... sitting at his desk eating off a tray that has a meal fit for a king on it... including the \"doilies\"... wine, and a steak that would satisfy six men in Barracks H... Helmut looks around to be sure no one notices him and slowly slips up to the front door of the shack and knocks on the door... \nINT. GUARD'S SHACK - NIGHT \nGUARD (annoyed at being bothered) Come in! \nThe meek and frightened Helmut enters the shack and walks over to the Guard's desk, and his eyes go immediately to the tray of food.  While the Guard just stares at him... somewhat shocked at his presence in the shack. \nGUARD (breaking the silence) What the hell are you doing here? Who gave you permission to leave your quarters? \nHelmut tries to talk as the guard gets louder and louder. \n", "test1_true": "Helmut nods no... \nGUARD Then what are you doing out of the barracks? \nThe frustration of not being able to answer, and the frustrations of being hungry... and the child-like treatment Helmut is getting from this Pig becomes emotionally too much... as he screams... \nHELMUT (turning red) If you'll shut your stupid mouth maybe I can answer one of your questions! \nThe Guard looks at Helmut in disbelief... but at the same time a little delighted at this chance to show his German superiority... as he slowly gets up from behind the desk and crosses to Helmut, with a sneer that would frighten Rommel... \nGUARD (nose to nose with Helmut) I have a STUPID MOUTH? \nHelmut backs away towards the door, and the Guard moves closer and closer to him... backing him up against the door. \nHELMUT (meekly) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to raise my voice... \nHe bows his head in fear, as well as concern for what he might have done to his chances of release. \nGUARD The volume of your voice isn't the issue...  it's what comes out of your mouth that disturbs me...  maybe you need a little lesson in respect and courtesy... \nAnd he smacks Helmut across the face with his black glove... \nGUARD ... and maybe I've been a little too soft with you... \nHe smacks him again, harder... the glove now feels like a sword to Helmut... and his hands hang limp down by his sides. \nGUARD You see, Doork, I knew why you came in here...  I knew why you left your barracks without permission... It's just that I hadn't heard you mention your release papers for so long I had hoped I could hear you begging once more... \nHELMUT (in a whisper) I'm sorry... \nGUARD (mimicking him) I'm sorry, I'm sorry... You're a sorry specimen of a human being... that's what you are... \nAnd he smacks him this time with all the force he can muster... \nGUARD Now, I will help you to your quarters, Herr Doork, here you will stay, and pray for release papers that may, or may not, ever come... \nThis wakes Helmut's soul and he becomes erect and stonefaced at the words the guards just said... this look infuriates the guard even more... he grabs Helmut by the scruff of the neck... like grabbing a wet cat to be thrown out of the house... and he opens the door and pulls Helmut by the back of the office... out the door, down the three steps and onto the ground... and pulls him like a sack of potatoes to the barracks doorway... \nEXT. BARRACKS H - DOORWAY - NIGHT \nHelmut is just about beaten at this point as the guard opens the door of the barracks and pulls Helmut into the doorway, and his body stops on the threshold. \nINT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT \nSHOOTING OVER the men onto the doorway... in the deep b.g. the sad body and figure of the man lays in the doorway, as the Guard kicks him in the ribs, unmercifully... \nGUARD Now, get inside where you belong and don't ever let me catch you doing anything without permission again. \nHelmut slowly gets up... in pain and practically crawls to his bunk... having to pass all the men, almost as though he were ashamed .. he gets to his bunk, and tries vainly to get up to the top where he lives... Keltner helps him... and as he settles in his place... \nCLOSE - THE GUARD \nGUARD (yelling across the barracks) Reverend!  If you don't watch that idiot, we may have to get him a keeper! \nThe guard storms out the door... slamming it shut. \nCLOSE - KELTNER AND HELMUT \nKeltner leaning over the side of Helmut's bunk whispering... as the other men go back to their respective chores and whatever they were doing when the guard stormed in... \nKELTNER Helmut, Helmut, how could you think of doing such a thing? I begged you not to irritate him...  and that I would ask him about your papers... that wasn't smart, Helmut... not smart at all...  as a matter of fact... \nHELMUT (gritting his teeth) Leave me alone!  ... and mind your own business... Just leave me be... \nKeltner knows this is nothing more than Helmut's dismay and pain in his heart talking... The kindly man drops down to his own bunk... just shaking his head... as if to say, how can I help him?  as we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BARRACKS H - DAY \nThe same Guard is motioning for the men to hurry and get outside... he is standing at the doorway to the barracks and the men are moving out into the ice cold morning as briskly as they can... the Guard moves inside after the last man has made his exit... \nINT. BARRACKS - DAY \nSHOOTING OVER the Guard as he looks around, we see Keltner coming out of the toilet area, rushing because he's late... he throws his towel on his bunk, and as he does... he sees what stops him in his tracks... \nKELTNER'S POV \nIt is Helmut still sound asleep in his bunk... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nKeltner moves towards Helmut to wake him... \nGUARD (in a sotto voice) Reverend, let him sleep... you move out, I'll take care of this... \nKeltner reluctantly starts to move out towards the front door, as the Guard passes him on his way to Helmut's bunk... Keltner goes out the door... the Guard sneaks over towards the bunk where Helmut is asleep and very sneakily slips the cover off Helmut's body... then proceeds to open the window above his head and the window alongside... and across the way and opens the back door... which is adjacent to the toilet area... and walks out of the barracks leaving the front door wide open... \nEXT. BARRACKS H - DAY \nAll the men are lined up for inspection, they are all looking straight ahead as the Guard walks down the line. \nAll except Keltner who can't help but look in the direction of the barracks where he knows Helmut is still sleeping.  He throws a glance at the guard as if to say... why?  Why are you doing this?  Why did he leave Helmut sleeping, usually the one thing that would send the guard up a wall... why is he allowing this to happen? \n", "test1_id": 2277, "test2_input": "BESTLER Not his clown name, you idiot.  His number.  His identification. \nSCHARFF If I have the Colonel's permission to leave, I will check it at once. \nBESTLER Later.  Right now I want these performances halted.  Understand? \nSCHARFF Yes, sir. \nBestler begins shuffling papers from the folder.  Scharff, uncertain whether he has been dismissed or not, hesitates. Bestler glances up. \nBESTLER (shouting) Immediately! \nSCHARFF Yes, sir ! \nHe salutes and bolts from the room, almost crashing into the door in his flight. \nCUT TO: \nPRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY \nShooting past the children in f.g. to Helmut through the fence, as he bows to the applauding youngsters.  Behind him we can see a number of soldier-guards coming through the cordon of watching prisoners, and waving them to disperse. They do so reluctantly, as the guard from Helmut's barrack moves forward to Helmut, who is just about to start another routine. \nGUARD (shouting) That's all.  Show's over.  Everybody clear out. \nHelmut stops, startled. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD \nANGLED to include children across the fence. \nHELMUT What's wrong? \nGUARD (to Helmut) Get back to the barrack. (to children) You heard me.  Show's over. \nThe children don't move, but stand staring at Helmut as if waiting for him to tell them what to do.  This frustrates the guard, who isn't accustomed to being questioned. \nGUARD Go on.  Get away. \nStill the children refuse to budge.  Angry, the guard goes close to the fence, waving his arms at them. \nGUARD Move, damn it, before I come over there and... \nThe youngsters scuttle back a few feet fearfully, but there they stop, their eyes still on Helmut.  The guard turns to Helmut. \nGUARD Get them moving before somebody gets hurt. \nHelmut goes up to the fence and speaks to the children softly. \nHELMUT That's all the show for today.  Go back inside. \nThe children back away with long faces.  Finally convinced that Helmut is through, they turn and wander back toward their barracks, but with many a backward look at him.  Helmut continues to encourage them, as the guard looks on. \nHELMUT That's right now, go along.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye. Until tomorrow. \nMany of the children wave to him.  The guard takes Helmut by the arm, turns him toward the barrack and hustles him off. \nMED. TWO SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD \nThe CAMERA MOVES BACK as they come toward it, the guard firmly propelling Helmut along. \nGUARD Get inside and take that stuff off your face. \nHELMUT I don't understand.  What's the matter? \nGUARD Orders.  No more shows. \nHELMUT You mean... not ever? \nGUARD That's right. \nHELMUT But we weren't doing any harm. \nGUARD The Commandant thinks you are. \nHELMUT The Commandant? \nGUARD The new Commandant.  He minds. \nHELMUT Just because I make them laugh a little... \nGUARD You know the rule... no mixing with Jews. \nHELMUT I wasn't mixing!  I was only... \nThe guard stops him and turns him so that they are face to face.  The CAMERA MOVES UP TO -- \nTIGHT TWO SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD \nGUARD (quietly, threatening) Look, it's not my order.  It's the Commandant's. (more kindly) Now do what I tell you and save yourself a lot of grief. \nHe pushes Helmut toward his barrack and then turns and walks off, the CAMERA PULLING BACK to -- \nWIDER ANGLE \nHelmut watches the guard go, then, dejectedly, shuffles toward his barrack.  As he nears it, Keltner, Franz, Adolf, Herman, Ludwig, and the other regulars intercept him. \n", "test2_true": "They crowd around Helmut, anxious to know what's happened. \nFRANZ What happened? \nHELMUT (still bewildered) He says I've got to stop -- with the children. \nKELTNER (nodding) I've been expecting it. \nLUDWIG Because they're Jews? \nKELTNER Because of the laughing. \nHELMUT Why should that bother them? \nKELTNER When you rule by fear, laughter is the most frightening sound in the world. \nSilently the men walk up the steps and into the barrack, the CAMERA PANNING with them until we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY \nIt is a warm, sunny afternoon and most of the prisoners on both sides of the fence, are out warming their weary bones. On the Aryan side, a number of prisoners, including Ludwig and Herman, are having a makeshift soccer game using a bound bundle of rags for a ball.  They play with fierce rigor for such emaciated men, yelling at each other and kicking up clouds of dust as they try to work off their frustrations. On the non-Aryan side of the fence, the children, now about 50 in number, are grouped near the wire barricades staring across it, their faces dour.  It appears they are watching the game. \nMED. LONG SHOT - CHILDREN \nShooting past the soccer players in f.g. toward the fence. Through the men we can see the children, but the play moves away from them.  They continue to stare straight ahead, obviously watching something else.  Suddenly many of them press close to the fence straining to see. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BARRACK \"H\" - CHILDREN'S POV \nHelmut can be seen standing in the doorway.  After a beat, he quickly retreats back into the barrack. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARRACK \"H\" - DAY \nThe CAMERA MOVES BACKWARD down the aisle between the bunks as Helmut walks dejectedly down the aisle, nervously fingering his white ascot.  The barrack is empty except for Keltner, who is arranging the sprouts of his potato plant over a little trellis of sticks.  Helmut turns and walks back up the aisle to stand in front of Keltner. \nHELMUT I can't go out there.  I can't take another day of them staring at me. \nKELTNER They'll get over it.  Disappointment is no stranger to those children. \nHELMUT They look at me as though it was all my fault.  Haven't they been told why I can't... \nKELTNER I'm sure they have. \nHELMUT Then why do they stare? \nKELTNER (holding up the plant) It's amazing how a thing like this can feed off itself.  Think how lucky we would be if we could do that. \nHelmut glances disinterestedly at the plant as he reaches up to his bunk and brings down the coat belonging to Franz.  He holds coat up for Keltner to see. \nHELMUT I sewed a button on.  Look all right? \nKELTNER (inspecting coat) Fine. \nHelmut gently pats the coat, then folds it and puts it back on his bunk. \nHELMUT I did make them laugh.  Didn't I? \nKeltner nods. \nHELMUT (angrily) I wish they'd get them out of here. Prison is no place for little children. \nKELTNER We've been all over that before. You've got to stop thinking about them. \nHELMUT (trying to convince himself) You're right!  I've got to think of myself. \nKeltner puts the plant under his bunk and gets up. \nKELTNER It's too hot in here.  I'm going to get some air. \nHELMUT Johann... do you think there's any possible way I could talk to the Commandant.  Maybe I could make him understand... \nThe sentence trails off as Helmut realizes how useless his suggestion is. \nKELTNER There's nothing you can do... but forget. \nHELMUT How can I!  They were my own very special audience.  And now they stare at me as if I had betrayed them. \nKELTNER They're children, Helmut.  You can't expect them to understand the madness of adults. \nHELMUT (sudden thought) If I could talk to them.  To the children themselves -- that would help, wouldn't it? \nKeltner doesn't answer but he watches Helmut with new interest. \nHELMUT If I explain it to them -- then they'll know I am not mad at them. \nKELTNER (very deliberately) You go near that fence once again... and you're taking your life in your own hands.  You know that as well as I do. \nHELMUT (pleading) I would just need a minute.  A minute to talk to them. \n", "test2_id": 2278, "test3_input": "The prisoners are still rooting for the soccer players, but as Helmut looks, Adolf, in the middle of the cheering section, turns and sees him. \nADOLF (a hushed call) Hurry up. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN \nHelmut nods to Adolf and then turns back to the youngsters, afraid but still unable to tear himself away. \nHELMUT Here.  Look.  I'll show you... No noise now. \nIn pantomime, he pretends to pull a hair from his head and threads it through an imaginary needle.  Finally accomplishing this, he pretends to be sewing a button on his jacket, holding the thumb of his left hand under the button while he sews with his right.  When he has finished, he pantomimes that he has sews his thumb to the jacket.  He pretends to be embarrassed and tries to hide his hand in his trouser pocket, but in order to put his hand in his pocket the jacket goes too.  The children giggle, then roar with laughter at his frantic efforts to detach his thumb from his jacket. \nThe silent children press closer to watch Helmut's antics. Some look at each other and smile, then grin.  Suddenly the entire group is laughing.  Helmut holds up his hands for silence, but the grin on his face says he loves it. \nHELMUT No, no, be quiet.  Be quiet.  Shhh. Shhhh. \nThe children go on laughing as if this is just part of the game. \nMED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS \nThe SOUND of the children's laughter floats up to two guards in a tower on the non-Aryan side of camp.  One of them, who has been watching the soccer game below, nudges his partner and points down to Helmut. \nLONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - GUARDS' POV \nBetween the children at the fence and the line of soccer spectators we can see only the top of Helmut's head bobbing up and down.  But that is enough. \nMED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS \nAfter a long look, one of the guards picks up a telephone and starts to make a call. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN \nHelmut seems to have thrown caution away under the stimulus of the children's laughter.  He is on his feet trying a hand spring.  He lands flat on his back, but rolls over on his side and grins broadly at his audience, which laughs appreciatively.  This is the old Doork.  Their Doork.  Again Helmut tries the hand spring and again he flops. \nFULL SHOT - PRISON YARD \nA HIGH ANGLE with Helmut and the children in f.g. and beyond them the Aryan side of the yard.  The soccer game is still in progress, with the spectators on both sides of the action whooping it up.  Then in b.g. we see two soldiers, two SS officers, and the guard in charge of barracks \"H\", come bursting through the spectators near the huts and into the game itself.  The players slowly subside as they realize what is happening.  They watch the guard cross the yard. The cheering trails off, and the yard becomes strangely quiet, the prisoners' warning to Helmut. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN \nOblivious to all this in his joy at performing for the children again, Helmut is just pretending to slip on something underfoot.  His arms flay the air as he tries to regain his balance, but he falls.  Through this, however, the children seem to be watching something behind Helmut, and when he lands on the ground, they do not laugh. \nAgain their faces are frightened as they look o.s.  Helmut looks at them, puzzled.  Then, realizing that something is wrong, he turns and looks up from the ground. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING PAST Helmut in f.g. toward the guard, SS men, and soldiers, who have come through the line of spectators and stand glowering at him.  The prisoners have moved back, warily watching for the next move. \nGUARD You wouldn't listen, would you? \nAlmost wearily, he goes to the fence.  This isn't something he likes, but his authority is at stake here, and he has no choice.  As the CAMERA PANS him to the fence we see that some non-Aryan adults have drifted over to see what the disturbance is. \nGUARD (to the children) Go on.  Get back. \nThe children don't move.  Their eyes are on Helmut.  The guard shouts over to the adults standing behind the children. \nGUARD You back there, get them out of here. \nThe adults begin to gather up the children. \nHELMUT They had nothing to do with it.  It was all my doing. \nThe guard turns and comes up to face Helmut.  He studies him for a moment, then hits him a vicious backhand slap across the face.  Taken by surprise, Helmut staggers backward and falls.  A murmur runs through the prisoners.  The children still near the fence, cry out with alarm.  Seeing their terror, Helmut is determined to make it look like just another act.  With a painful effort he gets to his feet, smiles at the children, turns and salutes the guard, knocking himself down again.  A couple of children giggle.  The FIRST SS OFFICER quickly steps forward to stand behind the guard. \nHe holds a swagger stick in his right hand, which he repeatedly whacks into the palm of his left hand.  He looks down at Helmut. \nFIRST SS OFFICER Get up. \nHelmut struggles to his feet.  He glances over at the children.  They are all watching him.  He takes a deep breath, winks at the little ones, then salaams before the SS Officer and the guard.  Some of the children giggle.  This infuriates the SS officer.  He raises the swagger stick and brings it down hard on Helmut's head knocking him to his knees.  The children scream with terror.  The SS Officer raises the stick to hit Helmut again, but Keltner, in an almost instinctive reaction, catches hold of his arm. \nKELTNER The children! Not in front of the children! \nTWO SHOT - FIRST SS OFFICER - KELTNER \nThe SS Officer turns and brings the stick down on Keltner. He hits him over and over, each blow more vicious. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT - FRIGHTENED CHILDREN IN B.G. \nHelmut turns away from the beating, pulls his jacket up over his head and starts to walk around like a headless man stumbling and falling over his own feet.  The children, many still screaming, turn their eyes away from the SS Officer to watch Helmut's antics. \nFULL SHOT - FRANZ, GALT, UHLMANN, LUDWIG, ADOLF, HERMAN AND OTHER PRISONERS \nThe horror-stricken men stand frozen as the SS Officer continues to hit Keltner until he drops to the ground. Suddenly Franz breaks away from the men and charges at the First SS Officer. \nMED. SHOT - SS OFFICER - FRANZ \nFranz runs INTO CAMERA and attempts to stop the First SS Officer.  The Second SS Officer whips his pistol out, aims carefully and FIRES a shot into Franz's head. \nVARIOUS SHOTS OF THE PRISONERS \nUhlmann stands speechless and dumbfounded.  Galt cowers. Beads of perspiration pour from his brow.  Adolf weeps bitter tears as Herman places his arm around his shoulder to comfort him, and himself as well.  Ludwig, dead to any emotion, simply turns and walks away into the crowd. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT \nHelmut is now, more than ever, the clown, as he goes into a frenzied version of the \"Clap Dance\".  The complete incongruity of his behavior leaves the spectators stunned. \n", "test3_true": "The children are no longer screaming, instead they are watching Helmut as though they are hypnotized. \nFULL SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD, SS MEN, OTHER GUARDS \nThe guard, fully aware that the sadist SS men may take action against Helmut, quickly motions for two of the other guards to take Helmut away.  The First SS Officer, still panting with exhaustion, shows his approval of the action taken by the guard.  The two guards seize Helmut by the arms and begin dragging him off toward the administration building.  The prisoners move away before the guards holding Helmut, forming a sort of line of march for them.  As they drag Helmut along, he waves back at the children, makes a funny face and moves his feet in something approaching a dance step. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL - NO LIGHT \nSHOOTING FROM THE BACK of the cell toward the door.  The cell is about eight feet long and four feet wide with a steel door at the far end.  The cell is bare.  We HEAR men approaching, and a guard opens the door letting in a shaft of bright light.  Two guards hoist the unconcious Helmut into the cell and drop him onto the floor. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nHe lies in a heap on the floor, his face swollen from a severe beating. \nMED. SHOT - CELL \nThe guards walk out, slamming the door shut leaving the cell pitch dark. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE SHOT - WINDOW WITH WINDOW SHADE \nWindow shade quickly rolls up letting in a steam of blinding sunlight. \nINT. COLONEL BESTLER'S OFFICE - DAY \nLt. Scharff is by the window, having just rolled up the window shade.  Colonel Bestler is on the phone and obviously exasperated by what he is hearing. \nMED. SHOT - BESTLER, SCHARFF \nBESTLER (on phone) Yes. (pause) Yes.  Yes, I understand perfectly. However, I don't see how we can be held responsible. (pause) Our orders were very clear.  We were to have the freight car ready to be picked up at midnight. (pause) Of course, I'm aware the operation must be kept secret. (pause) I just don't have the staff to send down there now and... Yes, I'll wait. \nHe puts hand over mouthpiece to talk to Scharff. \nBESTLER The freight car wasn't picked up. \nSCHARFF It's still down there on the siding! \nBESTLER Some stupid mix up.  If they think... \nThe SOUND of the voice coming over the phone causes him to literally snap to attention. \nBESTLER Yes, General. (pause) Yes, I'm as distressed about the situation as you are. (long pause during which he nods his head) Yes.  Personally!  Immediately! Yes, General.  You can leave it in my hands. (pause) Heil Hitler! \nHe puts down the instrument and turns at once to Scharff. \nBESTLER Who did you leave in charge down there? \nSCHARFF Sergeant Hoffman.  Very reliable. \nBESTLER Apparently not reliable enough.  The cargo seems to be raising quite a fuss. \nSCHARFF (explanatory) Fifty children, sir!  In a boxcar! \nBESTLER I know.  I know.  But the siding isn't far from town.  The General doesn't want unauthorized persons getting curious.  Understand? \nSCHARFF I'll get some men down there right away. \nBESTLER Men!  You'll get yourself down there. And take at least a dozen guards with you.  Don't let anyone get close to that boxcar...  under any circumstances.  No one ! \nSCHARFF Yes, sir. \nScharff turns to leave the office, but after a few steps he stops and turns back toward Bestler, a look of concern on his face. \nSCHARFF Sir? \nBestler looks up. \nSCHARFF I wondered, sir, if you might have any suggestions as... well...  how do we quiet children? \nBESTLER Use any method you can, but shut them up.  That's an order. \nScharff is disappointed at not getting some help from Bestler. Suddenly his face brightens. \nSCHARFF Sir, the clown! \nBestler looks at him quizzically. \nSCHARFF The one who amused the children \nBESTLER Out of the question.  The man's being disciplined for that very thing.  We can't change our position now. \nSCHARFF No one need know. \nBESTLER He'd know. \nScharff thinks this over.  Suddenly his face brightens. \nSCHARFF Sir, if I could guarantee he'd never say anything. \nBestler looks interested. \n", "test3_id": 2279}

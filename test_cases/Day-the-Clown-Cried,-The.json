{"train": "The Day the Clown Cried \nTHE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY By JOAN O'BRIEN And CHARLES DENTON Based on a Story Idea by JOAN O'BRIEN Additional Material by Jerry Lewis \nI TOOK A CHILD BY THE HAND... TO LEAD HIM ON HIS WAY. I TOLD HIM OF THE LOVE OF GOD... AND TAUGHT HIM HOW TO PRAY. AND AS I SEARCHED FOR BETTER WAYS HIS GUIDE AND HELP TO BE... I FOUND, AS WE WALKED HAND IN HAND, THAT HE WAS LEADING ME. \"THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED\" \nCOLD OPENING \nEXT. PARIS CIRCUS - NIGHT \nThe normal activity and excitement of showtime around the circus is in evidence where we see the half dark street and alley directly adjacent to the circus tent which (in Paris is an enclosure)... the animals, the midgets, the people and the roustabouts moving with a fixed speed and getting faster as we now know showtime is momentarily due. \nWe MOVE TOWARD the action, slowly but definitely picking up SOUNDS and actions of the busy people as we go. \nSTRAIGHT CUT TO: \nEXT. CIRCUS - FRONT OF CIRCUS - PEOPLE ENTERING - NIGHT \nWe see barkers, children, people, pushing... buying tickets, hats, candy... SOUNDS of children laughing, MUSIC playing from o.s. within the tent area... and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BACK OF CIRCUS - NIGHT \nA continuation of the animals, trainers, clowns INTERCUT with the action of the circus customers jamming the entranceway to get in... (complimented CUTS from backstage to out front... building to the final crescendo... as we see the alley empty and clear out vs. the front area clearing and also becoming empty.) \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CIRCUS PROPER - NIGHT \nThe fully dressed orchestra playing the oncoming people to their respective seats as we PAN ALONG the happy faces and excited children... DOWN and BACK within the circus backstage and SLOWLY COME TO A STOP OUTSIDE: \"CLOWN ALLEY\". \nCLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT \nThe heartbeat of any circus... The long row of unkempt, yet beautifully neat trunks where the clowns make up, with many of the clowns just coming in and setting their clothes and things around their own little areas... midgets running and playing, like the little children they are about to entertain... MUSIC is in the deep background... as we COME TO A STOP at the large trunk with the letters clearly printed ...'GUSTAV - EUROPE'S PREMIER CLOWN.\" \nWe PULL BACK and AWAY from the lettering on the trunk and REVEAL the face of a gentle but drawn man, a man whose body and movements indicate he has been at this for a long time. As he sits, the little midgets run close to see what they can do to help; one pulls the chair for him to sit on; another brings a hot cup of coffee; another takes his coat and hangs in on the hattree, adjacent to his trunk... as we PUSH PAST HIM to introduce the other clowns... some half made up, others finishing their make-up... and some just sitting and rapping together, smoking, drinking coffee, waiting for showtime... and in the very distant b.g., almost against the wall of clown alley, we see the trunk and the body of a \"CLOWN\" in silhouette... we CRAWL TOWARDS the body and the trunk... and COME TO A STOP... HOLDING FULL FRAME.  The clown, already made-up and dressed in his tramp outfit, has his head in his hands, leaning down on the trunk table top, a depressed and sad looking hulk of a man... an o.s. voice: \nMIDGET Coffee?  It's nice and hot. \nThe MIDGET slides the cup in front of the clown's face... as he picks up his head and smiles and nods yes... he sips the coffee and we see the clown is HELMUT DORQUE (pronounced Doork). \nHe is a depressed and very unhappy clown... the frown on his face shows years of knocking around... plus fear that those years are now over.  From o.s. we HEAR the SOUND of a small air horn being blown and carried by one of the midgets.  He is yelling through an old megaphone. \nMIDGET 15 Minutes to circus... 15 minutes to circus. \nUpon hearing this, \"Clown Alley\" really gets busy... all the clowns get up and put their last minute touches together... touching up their make-ups... getting their coats and props together... and as they get themselves up and ready, they exit the clown alley area and start for the arena.  The last one to go is Helmut, lingering behind intentionally as we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. CIRCUS ARENA - CLOSEUP RINGMASTER - NIGHT \nRINGMASTER Ladies and gentlemen, we proudly present... \"The Clowns\"! \nINT. CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT \nHelmut hangs back until the very last clown exits Clown Alley, as we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. CIRCUS PROPER - NIGHT \nThe MUSIC is really going strong... and the clowns come on like all forty.  They explode in the ring... doing all their bits and pieces which ultimately brings them back to the entrance area they just came from and they make the \"West Point\" arch for the TIMPANI DRUM ROLL and the grand entrance of \"Gustav\" the Great. \nCLOSER SHOT \n\"Gustav\" makes his famous comedy walk into the tent with the longest pair of tails ever seen (at least 75 feet long) and at the end holding them from dragging on the floor is Helmut, the \"Tramp Clown\". \nWIDER SHOT \nWe see Gustav taking the applause, and it is tremendous.  He stops center of the ring, but Helmut keeps walking and doesn't see the post in front of him as he walks around the post, still holding the tails and goes on his butt, pulling Gustav down as well.  The audience screams with laughter, believing this all part of the act, as we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT \nAll the clowns are sitting around their respective trunks and there is a sense of gloom permeating the air, as Gustav and MR. SCHMIDT pace back and forth behind Helmut, both going at him unmercifully. \nMR SCHMIDT (in the middle of his tirade) Not to mention how unprofessional that was... \nHELMUT But it was an accident... \nGUSTAV Oh, sure it was... A very well planned and calculated accident! \nHELMUT I swear to you... it was an accident! \nGustav stops and grabs Schmidt's arm, and with a threatening, pointing finger... \nGUSTAV I don't want to hear any more... You will get me another stooge. I don't want this man!! \nSCHMIDT Don't get excited, Gustav, you shall have it. \nGUSTAV You bet I will, or you shall have no show. \nGustav walks away, sits at his trunk, starts taking his make- up off. \nHelmut hears it all and it sounds so good and right. \nHELMUT I will go now and see Schmidt... I will tell him I won't take any more degradation... I will tell him I am a \"clown\" not a stooge...  A \"clown\"... A special person...  A special clown... \nAda happily gets his hat. \nADA (placing the hat on his head) Go, my love... Go and fight for what you know is right... I will warm your dinner and wait for you to come home. \nShe kisses him, opens the door for him and he goes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THE EMPTY CIRCUS - NIGHT \nThe low key light and the silence of the circus is almost ominous and a little frightening for Helmut as he walks across the empty arena... with a small light burning from up high. All the equipment is tied off.  Slight ANIMAL SOUNDS in the deep background... and the faintest SOUND of circus music is heard.  Helmut is now center of the main ring and stops and looks around. \nHIS POV - THE EMPTY STANDS \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nHis face tense, then eases as he looks around. \nHIS POV \nThe stands are full, the lights come up, and the audience is standing, applauding thunderously! \nMED. CLOSE - HELMUT \nIn his clown outfit bowing and acknowledging the ovation. \nHIS POV - THE AUDIENCE \nas they stop applauding and sit down. \nWIDE SHOT \nHelmut -- the chair and the trombone -- \nTHE TROMBONE PANTOMIME \nAs the completion of the \"Trombone Pantomime\" Helmut walks away from the position he was in with the trombone and bows and milks the crowd for reactions and as he bows the second time... WE SHIMMER: \nBACK TO: \nCLOSE - HELMUT \nIn bowing position as he looks at the crowd. \nHIS POV - THE EMPTY STANDS \nCLOSE - HELMUT \nHis face shows signs of utter despair and dejection... the dream is gone and the memory of what was really hurts deep down.  He looks around making sure he hasn't been noticed by anyone and takes that deep sigh and strolls towards the back of the circus tent area on his way to find Schmidt. \nWIDE ANGLE \nTRUCK WITH HIM, HOLDING the many empty seats in the b.g. as he walks... trying to muster up the courage he's going to have to call... something that has now become totally foreign to him. \nHIGH SHOT - THE EMPTY CIRCUS \nWe see Helmut as the tiny figure he feels like, walking out of the tent area and into the backstage section. \nCUT TO: \nBACKSTAGE OFFICE AREA - NIGHT \nHelmut enters the section of the circus where Schmidt has his \"Temp\" office quarters.  It is a tent-like arrangement with the canvas flap as his door and we see light streaming from the half open canvas flap. \nHIS POV - THE TENT OFFICE \nHelmut looks and sees a shadow of a body moving around in the tent office area and starts for it. \nINT. TENT OFFICE - NIGHT \nSchmidt pacing up and down... thinking, as we PULL BACK to see Gustav seated in one of the fold-up chairs with a \"I am waiting\" look on his face. \nSCHMIDT Naturally, I agree... Doork is a nuisance, but to just let him go seems a little unfair. \nGUSTAV Schmidt!  Don't make me put it on a \"either him or me basis\". \nSCHMIDT All right... all right... I'll give him -- \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE OFFICE TENT - HELMUT - NIGHT \nlistening. \nSCHMIDT (V.O.) -- his two weeks notice tomorrow. Will that satisfy you? \nGUSTAV (V.O.) Perfectly!!  Let's have a drink... \nHelmut drops his head, completely discouraged and saddened by what he knows is a losing battle.  As he starts to walk away we can HEAR the tinkling of glasses and the slight laughter of the two men as we watch Helmut slowly scuff his way towards the backstage circus exit, as we: \nDISSOLVE (12-ft) HOLDING his walk over his limp body at bar. \nThe corporal clicks his heels, thrilled that he can go. \nCORPORAL Yes sir!!!! \nHe exits, and returns with Helmut and one more guard.  Helmut stands in the doorway, frightened and unsure, Reicher still pacing behind his desk feels Helmut's presence... \nREICHER Alright, come in, sit down! \nHelmut walks to the chair in front of Reicher's desk... The spineless corporal moves towards the door... turns... and takes his position on the opposite side of the door that the guard is standing at... \nReicher picks up the folder again, fingers through it.  As he looks through the folder, he looks at Helmut and looks and fingers pages and the silence and the anxiety is getting to Helmut as he sweats and waits. \nReicher is toying with him, and each time Reicher looks up the sick, little-boy smile crosses Helmut's face, hoping to endear himself to this Prussian pig! \nReicher finally sits down beside his desk in a chair that resembles a throne.  It is high and it looks down on Helmut. \n(Props:  This chair must be higher and taller than Helmut's chair... for POV shots diminishing Helmut seated there. \nOVER REICHER ON HELMUT \nREICHER (soft spoken) Are you Helmut Doork? \nHELMUT (nervously) Doork, yes sir, Helmut Doork!  I am he!  Yes sir, that is correct, Doork! \nREICHER And are you a clown in the circus? \nHELMUT (ego setting in and forgetting for a moment his trouble and danger) Not JUST A CLOWN!  I am Helmut Doork, Premier Clown!  I've clowned for the royal heads of many of our finest countries, why there were times when I had to... \nREICHER (breaking in) That was years ago... According to these papers you are now just a helper in the circus with little or no importance!! \nThis stuns Helmut, his facade destroyed... His face drops along with his fear... \nHELMUT (meekly) Some things are only temporary... Lt. Reicher!  Only yesterday, I had calls from one of the great circus owners in all of Europe... he... \nREICHER (breaking in, strong and angry) You are NOTHING!!  You are a HAS BEEN!!  You WERE A CLOWN... \nREICHER (continuing) You are now a prisoner of the State and that's not funny... Can you make something funny out of that, Clown? \nHelmut sinks even lower in the over-stuffed chair, despair in his eyes and a weight on his heart... the truth slashing at his very being. \nHELMUT (softly) No!  Lt. Reicher, I can't make anything funny from that thought... \nREICHER It is no thought... It is fact, Clown, unquestionable fact!!  Now down to the issues at hand...  Did you willfully and with malice attack the State and impersonate the Fuhrer? \nHELMUT (softly) I was drunk!  It was a mistake!  I meant no disrespect... Sir... Honestly, I was drunk and not responsible for my actions and thoughts!  And my actions were subconscious! \nREICHER (screaming) Subconscious??  Meaning it was all motivated by truth that came out under the influence of alcohol! \nHELMUT (still softly) I am a LOYAL German! \nREICHER And what kind of commendation would you expect for being a loyal German? \nHELMUT I want nothing!  But I'm more loyal than most Germans I know... \nREICHER Like who? \nHelmut realizes this was the wrong thing to say... he sweats... \nHELMUT Ah, like... re... \nREICHER Names!   Names!!!  Who? \nHELMUT I don't know... \nREICHER Sir!!! \nHELMUT I don't know, sir... \nREICHER But you said other Germans... What OTHER Germans...  Who are they?  Why aren't they loyal?  Who? \nHELMUT (trying desperately to cop out) I'm not responsible for what I say now... \nREICHER Why?  You're not drinking... you said you weren't responsible last night because you were drunk!  Are you drunk now? \nHELMUT No, sir! \nREICHER Then why are you not responsible now? \nHELMUT I don't know!! \nREICHER SIR!!! \nHELMUT I don't know -- sir !!! \nREICHER Why are you not responsible?  Why? Why?  Why?  Why? \nOn each attack of the word \"why\", Reicher creeps up closer and closer to Helmut, really intimidating him... and the sound of his voice echoes and becomes monotone and ominous... \n[THE NEXT TWO PAGES OF THE SCRIPT ARE MISSING AS THEY ARE IN THE ORIGINAL] \nThe corporal gets Reicher's point and marks his notebook, flips the cover closed, snaps to attention as we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT RAILWAY STATION - DAY \nHelmut digs the knife into the table top and buries his head in his hands... totally shook from the encounter... \nGUARD Your release? \nHe begins to laugh, but hysterically. \nGUARD Release?  They told me you were funny...  but I never realized just how funny you are...  RELEASE ???? \nAnd the hysterical laughter really echoes throughout the mess hall as the Guard makes his way towards the exit.  The men at the table slowly get up and exit the scene, as do the others at the surrounding tables... leaving Helmut just sitting there... we PULL BACK to reveal the empty mess hall, and the lonely sad body of Helmut, as he looks around realizing he's alone, gets up and slowly creeps out of the hall like a puppy with his tail between his legs... as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY \nThere are two rows of prisoners quarters, wooden buildings, weather beaten each row consists of about a dozen barracks each... joined at the ends, farthest from the CAMERA by the administration building, a two story type making a \"U\" shape of the compound... The entire yard is surrounded by two high wire fences about ten yards apart and fifteen feet high. At intervals of about twenty-five yards, in the area between the fences, are the guard towers, each about eighteen feet above the ground equipped with searchlights, sirens, machine guns, with three Guards on duty.  Along outer fence, also about twenty-five yards apart, other powerful lighting equipment mounted on high poles. \nIt is morning and although the sun shines brightly it doesn't in any way alter the drabness of the compound... nor does it help change the look of the men... \nThere are about three hundred men milling about, some still chewing what was their breakfast, some pulling brown bread from their shirt fronts and exchanging bread for cigarettes or just making deals, one with another... some sit along the barracks walls trying to get some sun... others walking in circles... some talking, laughing, even playing cards... doing whatever they can to kill time... \nPAN the entire camp.  At completion of the long PAN introducing the prison camp, we pick up the sixtyish JOHANN KELTNER (formally ANDERLICH), a warm, sensitive looking greying man, thin but with a dignity and a serenity about him... He walks briskly (and we know he'd love to walk slowly and tiredly, but we can see he knows his attitude and conduct will help those that can't help themselves...) \nHis face tells us he is good, kind and the reason men want to live, he is special and he smiles at all those he passes, greets the men and is generally what man wishes he could be under the same circumstances... \nHe walks into the building, which we learn is the barracks... \nINT. BARRACKS - DAY \nThe barracks are empty... Keltner enters the huge room and looks around and sees Helmut at the other end of the barracks just walking back and forth like a caged lion... angry, hurt, sad, and generally out of sorts... he can't even hear Keltner approaching him... he finally stops at the back wall of the barracks and lays his head against the barracks wall... \nHELMUT (not aware Keltner is behind him) Dear God, please hear me! \nKELTNER He hears you, my son... \nHelmut jumps, scared... throwing his back against the wall, like a man who fears being attacked at any time... \nKELTNER (sympathetically) Here, here, easy, you can't do this to yourself... \nHELMUT You frightened me, Johann, I'm sorry... \nKELTNER (softly) You have nothing to be sorry for... Fear isn't something controlled by man...  fear can not be conferred with...  there isn't anyway known to mankind where man can say to himself...  \"I will not be afraid\"... Oh, certainly man can try to fight it... but faith and believing are man's only chance...  You must have faith... you must! \nHELMUT I have faith... but not always... sometimes it eludes me...  I can't remember to remember it. \nKELTNER But that's natural... you can't expect to be perfect in what you try to do... \nHELMUT I don't know... \nHe starts pacing again. \nKELTNER I heard what happened at breakfast this morning with ROTHMAN, the guard... \nHelmut spins around, frightened again... \nHELMUT Will they do something to me? What have you heard? \nKELTNER (putting his arm around him) Nothing, absolutely nothing... don't worry about it... I just wanted you to know that I believe you handled yourself admirably... \nHELMUT That was one time I didn't care for the laughs I was getting from some of the men... \nKELTNER Of course you didn't... but I'm sure you know man laughs for two reasons... one because something is funny... two, because they fear showing fear... they laughed because \"there but for the grace of God go I!\" \nHELMUT Do you really think so? \nKELTNER I'm certain of it! \nHelmut smiles and takes Johann's hand, tenderly, and warmly: \nHELMUT Thank you, Johann.  I always feel so much better after you talk to me... \nKELTNER I'm glad, Helmut, I'm very glad... you know you can always talk to me, about anything... \nHELMUT (remembering) Oh!  I almost forgot... \nHelmut puts Johann around the back of the barrack area near the wall out of sight of anyone coming in... \nHELMUT Before breakfast this morning,  I spoke to one of the guards, a very intelligent one, and he seems quite nice and friendly too.  Well, he said that the Gestapo has set up a special review board to handle cases just like mine.  And he said he would get me a form, a special form.  Just been printed up.  And I'm to fill it out.  Isn't that good? \nKeltner looking at him, like a child that believes in the boogie man: \nKELTNER How many times since you've been here, have you filled out forms? Twenty?  Thirty times?? \nHELMUT (in fast) But this is different.  It's entirely new. \nHelmut takes out a set of papers from his back pocket to show Keltner. \nHELMUT See?  These are made up by the Gestapo itself... and the form will go directly to Berlin, to Gestapo headquarters.  That's the important thing about this... the Gestapo's in on it.  That's a very good sign. (a beat) Isn't it a good sign? \nKELTNER (sympathetically) Yes, my son, it is a good sign. \nHELMUT (in fast, excited; scanning the papers) And I have to be very careful of everything I put down on the form. The tiniest detail could make the difference.  Don't you agree? \nHelmut looks up and notices Johann is looking up towards the ceiling of the barracks... watching something... Helmut looks up, too. \nTHEIR POV - THE BIRDS \nGUARD ATTENTION ! \nThe men jump, but quickly, to their feet, and stand at attention at the front of their bunks, ala inspection in the army.  They are rigid and waiting to hear what's up.  The Guard takes a few steps into the barracks... behind him we see several prisoners carrying bunks waiting to enter the barracks. \nGUARD All the prisoners from the other side of the camp are being moved over to this side of the camp over to this side of the camp.  Barracks \"H\" will make room for three additional bunks. \nHe takes a few steps down the aisle... \nGUARD I want all the bunks moved down toward the far end.  Get them as close together as possible. Now! GET MOVING! \nLONG SHOT \nThe men scramble back to their own bunks and immediately begin pulling, shoving, and grumbling comments about being too overcrowded as it is... \nTHE MEN (ad lib) Gotta have more room... We need more space...  Hey, watch where you're going. This is stupid! \nGUARD (yelling) YOU!  You down there at the end... get those bunks right up against the wall. \nCLOSE - HELMUT AND KELTNER \nAs bunks are moved towards the far end of the barracks, Keltner and Helmut prepare to move their bunks, the last ones on their side.  Helmut and Adolf, who have already made their move, come up to Keltner to help him with his bunk... Helmut sees that Keltner has help so he decides to back off and hide in his little corner with his pencil and scrap of paper... totally involved with his own pain and his undying fantasy about his ultimate release... \nWIDER SHOT - THE ENTIRE BARRACKS \nThe guard looks down the barracks as the men just about finish the moving job... \nGUARD Hurry it up!  Come on, get moving! \nThe guard turns towards the door and motions for the SIX PRISONERS to enter the barracks... they enter by pairs, each pair carrying a double-tier bunk. \nTheir personal belongings are piled on the bunks and slung over their shoulders in sacks (barracks bags)... the Guard motions for the two bunks to be placed next to Helmut's and one on the opposite side... next to the Stout Prisoner... NOTE:  This arrangement leaves space for one additional bunk right by the door. \nThe guard motions for the Stout Prisoner and Herman to give the new arrivals a hand with the placement of their bunks. \nGUARD Get them close. (he looks around the barracks) You're all going to be nice and cozy in here. \nSTOUT PRISONER (in a loud voice) Yeah, like triplets before they are born to a mother weighing 98 pounds... \nHERMAN That's what I call cozy! \nThe guard smiles, and all the men laugh... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe guard starts for the door, satisfied with the arrangements... as he gets the door open, Helmut runs over to catch him before he makes his exit... \nHELMUT (anxiously) Excuse me, sir, the papers...  Did they arrive yet? \nGUARD (annoyed) They'll have to wait! \nHe exits, closing the door behind him.  Helmut, with a look of despair on his face, goes back to his bunk. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT AND KELTNER \nHELMUT You'd think, since he was coming over here anyway, the least he could do was bring the papers with him. \nKELTNER This moving men around has undoubtedly kept him very busy... don't worry, he'll bring them. \nHELMUT I'm sure if I asked him again he'd really become annoyed with me.  Would you remind him for me, please? \nKELTNER (kindly) Of course I will. \nHelmut climbs up to his bunk and goes back to his precious paper work. \nWIDER ANGLE \nAs the new prisoners make up their bunks and arrange their belongings, the regulars of Barracks H, among them Adolf, Ludwig, Herman and Franz, begin moving towards them to meet them.  Keltner turns to the new white-haired prisoner whose bunk is directly next to his. \nKELTNER I've seen you around the yard, but the others... \nWHITE-HAIRED MAN About thirty of them got here yesterday from the prison outside of Frankfurt. \n1ST NEW PRISONER (who occupies the bunk above the white- haired prisoner) For the last three months we've been shuttled from one camp to another. \n2ND NEW PRISONER (his bunk is the lower bunk on the direct opposite side) Now they're shuffling us from one side to another.  I think they're trying to lose us. \nHERMAN Do you think they're bringing in war prisoners? \nLUDWIG I don't know why they're sending them here...  we're overcrowded as it is. \nKELTNER No, no... it's got to be something else...  Otherwise they would have left the bunks. \nADOLF It could be possible that he is fixing up the barracks for some of his lady friends. \nKELTNER That many women? \nHERMAN (standing at attention) Reverend, we Germans are SUPERMEN! \nAll the men break out in laughter at Herman's comment and his actions... but the laughter is cut short as they HEAR the door open again, and they all look in that direction. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING OVER the men onto the door, entering is the same guard that was just there... this time he enters with two more prisoners carrying their bunks.  One of them is JOSEF GALT, a burly bully like man, who knows all the tricks of survival, and ERNST UHLMANN, a think little man with a face like a weasel... they follow the Guard into the barracks proper. \nGUARD ATTENTION ! \nGalt makes like he's handing the plant to Keltner, who reaches for it, and as he does Galt slowly stands up making Keltner reach and reach and reach... and as Keltner gets closer and closer, Galt stands to his fullest height... making it literally impossible for Keltner to get it... Franz, Ludwig, Adolf, Herman and the Stout Prisoner (more than likely provoked by Helmut's stand, now circle Galt)... \nGALT (still holding the plant up high) Go on, little man, reach for it! \nKeltner, torn between seeing that Helmut is alright, and getting his plant back, tries to get it, and still looks to see that Helmut isn't hurt too bad... \nHERMAN (in a low menacing voice) Give it to him! \nGalt looks at him with a menacing stare... \nADOLF You heard him... give it to him! \nFRANZ You've had your fun... give it to him... NOW! \nSTOUT PRISONER (closing in on Galt) RIGHT NOW!! \nGalt realizes this is no time for a showdown... and with a childlike smile... grits his teeth... \nGALT Sure, here's your stupid flower or whatever you call it... \nKeltner takes it from him. \nKELTNER Thank you... \nKeltner leans down and picks Helmut up and walks him to his bunk, helps him onto it, and puts the plant on his own bunk... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe four men:  Ludwig, Adolf, Franz and Herman stay with Galt, as does the Stout Prisoner... They are clustered around Galt. \nGALT What's the matter with you guys? Can't you take a joke? \nADOLF What joke? \nGALT Hell, all I was doing was trying to have a little fun. \nLUDWIG Have it with someone else! \nGALT What's so special about him? \nADOLF That's the Reverend.  Even when they came and dragged him from his church...  he kept right on preaching against them until they knocked him unconscious. \nGalt is silent for a beat. \nGALT Well, how the hell was I supposed to know? \nHERMAN NOW you know! \nGalt shoves his way through the five men and walks beaten, for the moment, to his own bunk... as the men disperse and walk back to their respective bunks... \nCLOSE - GALT AND UHLMANN \nGalt walks over and sits at the edge of his bunk, while Uhlmann swings his legs back and forth from his perched position on the top of his bunk... Galt gives him a stare... \nGALT You and your posies... \nUHLMANN That was close... \nGALT Where were you when I need you? \nUHLMANN I make love, not war! (goes giggly over what he just said) Hey, that's pretty good... I made that up... Make love, not war!  I bet that would make a good slogan someday... \nGALT Aw, shut up! \nAnd he smacks his legs up and onto the bunk. \nTWO SHOT - KELTNER AND HELMUT \nKeltner with a wet towel in his hand cleaning the blood- dripping mouth of Helmut... \nKELTNER That was really very nice of you, Helmut... \nHELMUT Yeah, nice and STUPID! \nHelmut grabs the towel and throws it to the floor and turns on his side away from Keltner.  Keltner bends down, gets the towel, sits on the edge of his bunk... looks up, wonders and ponders Helmut as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT \nThe door to Barracks H slowly opens and Helmut peeks through the opening to see that all is clear... he slips out and walks along the dark, dreary alleyway towards the Guard's shack... he moves like a prisoner trying to miss the spotlights in a jail break... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHelmut gets to the Guards hut... he looks into the window, and sees the Guard he wants... sitting at his desk eating off a tray that has a meal fit for a king on it... including the \"doilies\"... wine, and a steak that would satisfy six men in Barracks H... Helmut looks around to be sure no one notices him and slowly slips up to the front door of the shack and knocks on the door... \nINT. GUARD'S SHACK - NIGHT \nGUARD (annoyed at being bothered) Come in! \nThe meek and frightened Helmut enters the shack and walks over to the Guard's desk, and his eyes go immediately to the tray of food.  While the Guard just stares at him... somewhat shocked at his presence in the shack. \nGUARD (breaking the silence) What the hell are you doing here? Who gave you permission to leave your quarters? \nHelmut tries to talk as the guard gets louder and louder. \nGalt doesn't like no for an answer... \nGALT (gritting his teeth) Now, me and these... gentlemen... we don't expect you to do your \"act\", just a little something that'll give us a laugh, that's all. \nKeltner moves in from o.s. and stands at the back of the group watching and listening. \nLUDWIG (to all the men) Aw, forget it... and that's probably his problem...  he's forgotten how! \nGALT (trying to suck him in) Wait a minute, you guys... show people have to be in a mood... (to Franz) Play a little music, like in a circus... \nFranz starts playing his harmonica... slowly... \nGALT There!  Ain't that nice?  Don't it put you in a mood? \nHELMUT (getting fed up) I TOLD YOU!  I need things to do my act. \n2ND NEW PRISONER Hey, Doork, what about that drunk routine... that was funny... \nHelmut looks at him puzzled... he can't think or remember anything at this point... certainly not anything relating to any of the previous lies he's told... \nGALT (pacifying his head off) Yeah, that drunk thing...  that does sound funny... \nHELMUT I still need many things... props and... \n2ND NEW PRISONER (puzzled) I don't remember you using anything in that drunk routine. \nGALT (starting to fume) Hey... are you trying to fool us? \nWith this Keltner moves in and up to Galt. \nKELTNER Leave him alone! \nGALT Stay out of this, Reverend. We're not doing anything... We just want him to join in the fun. \nUHLMANN (to the men) Right!  If a Reverend can give us a laugh, why not a clown? \nAll the men ad lib their agreement with what Uhlmann just said; it appears that they are all on Galt's side, and Keltner knows it. \nKELTNER (to Helmut, softly) It doesn't have to be anything special... a little dance, maybe? \nHELMUT (taking it all out on Keltner) Like that disgusting exhibition you did?  Oh, no... not me! \n4TH NEW PRISONER Go on, Doork, so I can tell my kids. \nHELMUT Can't you get it through your heads, I need... \nGALT (firmly) WE need you to give us a laugh. \nGalt grabs Helmut's jacket and pulls him off the bunk, nose to nose to him... \nGALT So... TRY! \nGalt has Helmut by the neck portion of the jacket, practically choking him to death... his vice-like hands are closing in on his throat and Helmut's trying vainly just to breathe... \nOne of the prisoners starts pounding his feet and making a march-like noise yelling from the other end... \"So try!\"... \"So try!\"... \"So try!\"... \"So try!\"... the other prisoners in the barracks pick up the chant and the stomping... Keltner doesn't even hear the racket they've started because of his concern for Helmut being choked to death... He tries to loosen Galt's hands from Helmut's throat. \nKELTNER That's enough, leave him alone! \nGALT Stay out of it, Reverend! \nGalt spins Helmut around so that his back is facing the aisle and he walks him into the center area... the other men feeling this violence happening, and watching.  Helmut being choked, triggers all of their venom and their hate and they really come on strong... stomping, yelling... \nTHE MEN (ad lib) Choke him harder...  see if that's funny!  Make him dance! Hey, Doork!... be funny now! He don't look so funny to me!  He sure as hell looks funny to me!  Hey, Galt, pull his string and make the dummy funny! \nAnd they stomp and they stomp and they stomp... \"So try!\"... \"So try!\"... They get louder and louder... Helmut is kicking his legs, which are off the ground, and Galt won't let go. \nCLOSE - HELMUT \nHis face is turning color... he hasn't a lot of air left in his lungs... and Keltner is practically hanging onto Galt trying to get his hands loose... and Galt could carry another three men without batting an eye.  Galt puts him down slowly, in the middle of the aisle, so that just his feet touch the ground, but he keeps his hands around his throat. \nGALT Your public is calling, clown... now, clown! \nWIDER SHOT \nSHOOTING OVER Galt, Keltner and Helmut, we see the door of the barracks slam open and bang against the wall making more noise than anything all the men made together, and they all freeze... \nMED. CLOSE - THE GUARD \nHe stands in the doorway, legs spread apart, hands on his waist... and he is wearing a raincoat, the barracks has become totally silent... all that is heard is the rain pecking away on the roof.  Galt has let go of Helmut who just lays on the floor with Galt and Keltner on both sides of him... \nGUARD (walking slowly into the barracks) What is going on here? (to Helmut) On your feet! \nHelmut gets up, dizzily, just about getting oxygen back into his system... \nGALT (like a little boy) He was showing us some of his funny clown falls... \nThe Guard surveys the faces of the others as they stare back. \nGUARD Because of all the noise coming from in here -- I have been called up front to explain...  I don't like to be called up front...  I don't like to have to explain... (menacingly) And, you might not like it, either. (a beat) Back to your bunks, all of you... Turn out the lights, and keep it QUIET ! \nAs the guard turns to the door to go, Helmut takes a step forward about to stop the guard, Keltner grabs his arm and turns him the other way... the Guard exits closing the door, quietly behind him... The men start to disperse... Galt gives Helmut a \"I'll get you for this\" look and returns to his own bunk with Uhlmann almost up his ass following... Keltner leads Helmut back to their bunk. \nHELMUT (whispering) I was just going to ask him about the forms... my release... \nKELTNER (shaking his head) That was not the time, believe me! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING ACROSS the prisoners in f.g. toward the new fence. Guards move among the men, herding them into lines.  On the other side of the fence, we can see the new arrivals lining up, being prodded into place by Guards. \nLONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - DAY \nOn both sides of the fence, the prison inmates have assembled in the wet, forbidden yard.  On one side are the regular prisoners, who watch the guards warily as they straighten their lines.  On the other side are the new prisoners -- about two hundred frightened Jews of all ages, including thirty or forty children and a number of very old men and women.  They stand in absolute silence as the loudspeakers blare again, except for the crying children. \nLOUDSPEAKER Attention!  The Commandant issues the following special order:  the north side of the camp is now temporary quarters for non-Aryan prisoners.  Fraternizing between Aryan and non-Aryan prisoners is strictly prohibited.  Any violation of this order will be severely punished.  Heil Hitler... Repeating... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING THROUGH the booted, outspread legs of a soldier guard in f.g. toward the line of prisoners behind him.  One woman holds a child of about three who cries inconsolably. \nLOUDSPEAKER The Commandant issues the following special order: \nAs the announcement is read, the guard's legs turn around, and he walks away from the CAMERA toward the woman.  He stands before her menacingly, and she clutches the child closer to her in a futile attempt to hush its crying. \nLOUDSPEAKER The north side of the camp is now temporary quarters for non-Aryan prisoners.  Fraternizing between Aryan and non-Aryan prisoners is... \nMED. SHOT - PRISONERS \nSHOOTING along line of prisoners from barracks H to show their various reactions as the announcement continues -- disdain, surprise, sympathy and relief.  The guard stands with his back to the line at the end farthest from the CAMERA. Galt is near the CAMERA. \nGALT (under his breath) Jews! \nPrisoners nearest to Galt eye him questioningly. \nLOUDSPEAKER ... strictly prohibited.  Any violation of this order will be severely punished.  Heil Hitler. \nThe loudspeakers go dead.  The prisoners stand silently studying the new arrivals across the yard.  The new prisoners self-consciously file back into their huts on the other side of the fence.  As the prisoners begin to break rank -- \nGUARD Prisoners from barracks H remain in line.  Barracks H will remain in line. \nThe prisoners turn and look in direction of the Guard as they straighten their lines.  The guard paces slowly along the line inspecting it silently.  On the fringes of the scene, we can see prisoners from other barracks gathering to see what their fellow convicts are in for. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - GUARD \nFinally he stops and contemplates his shabby charges with disgust. \nGUARD I said last night I didn't think I would enjoy being called up to account for the noise coming from barracks H.  I can tell you this morning I didn't enjoy it. \nHe walks down the line, looking at each man. \nGUARD I don't know what caused the trouble last night, but I'm not blaming you entirely. (fatherly) I failed you.  I should have seen that you all have much too much energy for the confined life you lead here. (he smiles benevolently) \nGUARD We're going to correct that.  I've been told that energy comes from food. \nMED. SHOT - PRISONERS \nTheir faces reflect that they know what is coming. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING PAST the line of prisoners in f.g. to the Guard, who has paused to let his words sink in. \nGUARD So... to help you... all rations are canceled for the next... forty-eight hours. \nA hushed ripple of ad lib grumbling and growling rolls along the line of prisoners. \nGUARD And, if that doesn't quiet you down, I'll think of some other ideas you'll like even less. I'm going to make this barracks the quietest in the camp. (roaring) Is that clear? \nThe prisoners are silent but their faces register their resentment. \nGUARD Now, don't blame me. (with sly meaning) I didn't start the trouble last night. \nThe truth of what he has said is reflected in the faces of the men. \nGUARD Fall out. \nANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT, KELTNER \nAs they stand with the other prisoners, watching the guard move off.  Keltner looks worried, the others are angry, Helmut seems undecided as his eyes follow the guard. \nHERMAN Bastard! \nSTOUT PRISONER I can't go without food. I'll starve. \nSuddenly Helmut makes up his mind and starts off after the Guard.  Keltner, sensing the mood of the men, puts a restraining hand on his arm, whispers to him hoarsely. \nKELTNER Helmut, don't. \nBut Helmut shakes him off and hurries away. \nThe other prisoners notice where he is headed and exchange looks.  Keltner shakes his head.  Galt's eyes narrow as he watches Helmut run off after the guard. \nGALT (loudly) He's the one we can thank for the diet. \nMED. SHOT - GUARD - MOVING \nThe CAMERA MOVES BACKWARD as the Guard strides toward it, his face sour.  Behind him we can see Helmut running to catch up to him.  When he is close enough... \nHELMUT Sir?  Corporal... \nThe guard stops and turns so abruptly that Helmut almost runs into him. \nFULL SHOT - HELMUT, MEN \nGalt takes his hand away from Helmut's mouth.  Helmut doesn't utter a sound.  He knows that Galt and the men mean business and he now must do something.  He nods his head. \nHELMUT All right... all right. \nThe men move back to give him room.  Frantically, he tries to think of something to do... he knows it must be great... or else his myth will explode.  He walks around in a little circle, trying, trying to think of something.  Finally he faces them.  He bows his legs and pretends he's a bow-legged man trying to walk a high wire, but he's so frightened the result is pathetic, not funny. \nPAN SHOT - PRISONERS \nThe camera works across their faces, which are expressionless. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT \nSeeing that he is getting no reaction from his \"audience\", Helmut tries something else. \nHe pulls his shirt over his head and walks around like a headless man.  He pretends to trip over some unseen object, peers through the front of his shirt at it, and stamps on the object.  Again he tries to walk over it, and again he slips. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, MEN \nas Helmut starts to repeat the same routine, many of the men are openly contemptuous.  Galt wears a smirk.  Keltner, unable to watch Helmut's degradation, moves away.  Others express their disappointment, their disdain. \nMEN If he's Germany's greatest clown, God help the Fatherland.  Doork, the Great!  You got paid for that?  To go without food is bad enough, but to have to watch that! \n2ND NEW PRISONER (accusingly) You're not the clown I saw.  You lied.  You're big all right.  A big liar. \n4TH NEW PRISONER (contemptuously) And I was going to tell my kids! \nUHLMANN He's no clown.  Not even a bad one. \nHELMUT I am.  I am a clown! \nThey move away from him. \nHELMUT (continuing) Give me a chance.  I just got started. \nBut the men continue to walk away.  Helmut tries to do a hand stand, but his hands slip in the mud, and he lands ignominously on all fours.  When he looks up, only Adolf, Galt and Uhlmann remain. \nADOLF (sadly) That's what we've been eating our hearts out to see! (a beat) You stink.  You really stink. \nHELMUT I... I slipped.   I can do it. \nSeeing the disbelief on their faces, Helmut becomes almost hysterical.  He is still on his knees. \nHELMUT I am a clown.   I am.  I am. \nHe pounds on the ground in frustration.  Galt spits contemptuously, and the three start to leave.  Galt turns back, looks down at Helmut.  Very deliberately, he comes forward to stand at a mud puddle. \nGALT Doork the Great. \nWith that he kicks a shower of mud directly into Helmut's face. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nThe mud splatters over his face.  He cries out.  His hands go to his eyes instinctively.  he kneels there, rocking back and forth in misery.  Then from o.s., we HEAR a tiny, tentative laugh -- the tiniest laugh ever heard.  Helmut looks up quickly.  He isn't sure that he heard it. \nThen it comes again, a little stronger.  He looks around quickly to see who has come back to taunt him, to ridicule him. \nLONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - HELMUT'S POV \nThe yard is empty except for a few prisoners from other barracks way off on the other side. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nHe is puzzled.  Then again he hears the laugh o.s.  He turns slowly to look behind him. \nMED. SHOT - BOY - HELMUT'S POV \nOn the other side of the fence stands a wide-eyed boy of about eight, who is watching Helmut timidly.  The ragged youngster laughs again, hesitantly, as if unsure what Helmut is doing is supposed to be funny, but finding it so nevertheless. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nHe looks uncertainly at the youngster.  Is the child ridiculing him, too?  He leans over the mud puddle and looks at his reflection.  He likes what he sees.  The mud on his face looks almost like a primitive clown mask.  Very deliberately Helmut scoops up more mud and puts a blob of it on the end of his nose.  He waits for the child's reaction. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOY \nHis eyes are laughing, but his little lips are pressed tight together.  He has been taught not to make sounds... not even sounds of laughter.  But finally what he is looking at becomes too much for him and the laughter spills out between his lips as they form a smile.  He laughs delightedly now, satisfied that Helmut is being purposely amusing. \nTWO SHOT - HELMUT, BOY \nHelmut gets to his feet, bows slightly and stiffly to the child, and then attempts another hand stand.  This time he holds himself up for a moment and then deliberately allows himself to fall on his back in the mud. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nAs he lands, he quickly glances off towards his barracks, but from the look of disappointment on his face, we know that none of his barracks mates are watching.  When he hears more laughter from o.s., he quickly rolls on his side to look. \nMED. SHOT - CHILDREN - HELMUT'S POV \nTwo more youngsters have joined the first, and all are laughing excitedly.  The first child jumps up and down, clapping his hands. \nWIDER ANGLE - FROM THE FENCE - FAVORING HELMUT \nHelmut gets up and bows, more deeply this time, a tribute to the children's vindication for his claim that he is a clown. He turns toward the direction of his barracks. \nHELMUT (screaming at top of voice) Come back, damn you, come back.  The children... they're laughing.  They're laughing.  I am a clown.  I am a clown. \nHelmut shakes his head \"yes\", turns and quickly hustles off in the direction of his own barracks, the CAMERA MOVING with him.  After a few steps. \nBIG PRISONER'S VOICE Doork! \nMED. SHOT - BIG PRISONER - HELMUT'S POV \nThe Big Prisoner looks at Helmut, then at the piece of bread Helmut had given him.  His manner is self-conscious.  He tosses the piece of bread to Helmut. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, BIG PRISONER, OLD PRISONER \nHelmut catches the bread, his smile expressing his thanks. The Old Prisoner puts his arm around the Big Prisoner's shoulder, while the Big Prisoner tries not to show that he is pleased with himself for his \"generous\" act. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT \nTaking bites of the bread, Helmut, rather jauntily, lopes off toward his own barracks.  As he moves among the other prisoners, the CAMERA MOVING with him, we see many of them point or nod toward Helmut and smile good-naturedly.  Helmut is completely unaware of them, so lost is he in his own thoughts. \nEXT. BARRACKS H - MED. SHOT - KELTNER, FRANZ, HERMAN - DAY \nThey sit in the shade beside their barracks.  Herman is using his empty bowl as a fan.  Keltner is just finishing his food. Franz is examining his jacket, his empty bowl beside him on the ground. \nFRANZ (IRRITATED) I mean it this time. \nKELTNER Don't tell us.  Tell him. \nFranz holds up the tattered jacket to show that a button is missing. \nFRANZ What am I supposed to do? Use pins? \nHERMAN Who has a pin? \nKeltner chuckles. \nFRANZ You can laugh.  He isn't always after you for something. \nKELTNER No? \nHe fishes in a pocket and pulls out a large piece of chalk, holds it up. \nFRANZ What's that? \nKELTNER Chalk. \nFRANZ What for? \nKELTNER (SHRUGS) Says he can mash it into a powder and put it on his face. \nHerman stops fanning along enough to ask... \nHERMAN Where'd you get it? \nKELTNER From a guard. \nAstonished, Herman and Franz look at him questioningly. \nKELTNER (lowers his voice) A very bad Nazi.  Still has a heart. \nHerman and Franz smile.  Then Franz holds up his tattered coat. \nFRANZ I wish he'd have a heart and use someone else's coat. Or better yet -- his own. \nKELTNER (looking o.s. and nodding) Ask him. \nWIDER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT \nAs he comes flapping up, still munching on the piece of bread given to him by the Big Prisoner.  Keltner holds out the chalk to him. \nKELTNER Finally got it. \nHelmut takes it and examines it in a very professional manner. Herman and Franz exchange looks.  Keltner waits for Helmut to speak. \nKELTNER (a little annoyed) Isn't that what you wanted? \nHELMUT (holding up the chalk) This will do more for the act than anything.  Wait'll you see! \nKELTNER (a sigh of relief) For a moment there you had me worried. \nFRANZ (indicating bread Helmut's nibbling on) I see you got smart. \nHELMUT His conscience bothered him. \nKELTNER I thought he would kill you when he saw what you had done to his shoes. \nHELMUT (sheepishly) So did I. \nThe men laugh. \nFRANZ I don't know what I'm laughing at... look at what he's doing to my coat. (holds it up) Look at it!  Yesterday a button off. \nAnd you've got it ripped here under the arm.  Besides all that falling down isn't doing it any good. \nHELMUT (firmly) I've got to have it.  It is the only one I can get on and still is tight enough to look funny. \nFRANZ At the rate you are tearing it up, it's going to look a lot funnier. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThey arrive at the steps to the barracks.  Helmut swings Franz's coat over his shoulder as he starts up the steps. \nHELMUT If you have time later, I'd like you to see something I've been working on.  I hunch down and do a tiny soldier parading.  Think they'll like it? \nKELTNER (pointedly) Who?  The adults? \nHELMUT (matter of fact) The children, of course. \nKELTNER I thought the smart clown only played to the adults. \nHelmut, caught in a contradiction of his own \"theory\" of clowning, gives Keltner an annoyed look, then goes into the barracks letting the door slam behind him. \nCLOSE SHOT - KELTNER \nAs he stands at the bottom of the steps -- he shakes his head and smiles as he marvels at the change taking place in the pompous Helmut as the little gentle clown within him struggles to emerge. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PRISON YARD - PAN SHOT - CHILDREN - DAY \nThe CAMERA is PANNING across the faces of about forty children behind the fence as they watch Helmut o.s.  Some of them are laughing; some clapping; some squealing with glee, and a few just watching quietly, but with laughter in their eyes. Behind them, near the barracks on the non-Aryan side, a number of adults also are looking on, but they hang back, fearful that getting too close to the fence might provoke the always anticipated wrath of the guards. \nEXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY \nWe see now that Helmut on his side of the fence is performing for the children on the other side of the menacing barbed wire fence.  Behind him, also at a safe distance because they still aren't certain of the official reaction to all of this, a number of his fellow political prisoners are watching his antics.  But, in spite of his talk about the importance of playing to the adults -- it is the children that Helmut plays to -- and it is for their laughter that he listens. The CAMERA MOVES IN to -- \nMED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT \nAnd we see that he has used the chalk to whiten his face. With charcoal he has blackened his eyebrows, formed a wide black mouth and drawn lines down over his eyelids to his cheekbones, giving him the appearance of a clown at once sad and happy.  At the moment he is coatless, but Franz's coast lies nearby on the ground.  For the stunt he is doing now Helmut carries the remains of an old broom and a piece of cardboard.  He is trying to sweep a small heap of dirt he has gathered onto the cardboard, but each time he tries, the dirt goes over the cardboard and he must sweep it into a pile again.  After a few attempts he feigns exasperation and ponders the problem.  Inspiration comes.  He sweeps the dirt into a pile again, bends over and very carefully sweeps it into the front of one of his shoes, holding up the split top to let it in.  This accomplished, he is very proud of himself, but when he tries to take a step, some of the dirt comes out.  Frustrated, he ponders again, and again has an inspiration.  He removes the shoe and puts it under his arm. But as he walks away with it, all the dirt slides out through the open toe.  The children roar with delight. \nCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL \nShe is a flaxen-haired youngster of about five who holds a weathered rag doll as she jumps up and down for sheer joy at Helmut's performance. \nCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY \nHe is a completely delighted boy of perhaps seven.  Each time Helmut does something he particularly enjoys he hugs himself and spins around. \nCLOSE SHOT - BROTHER AND SISTER \nThe girl is no more than four; the boy about eight.  He clings to her hand as they watch Helmut, unsmiling, perhaps not understanding.  The boy looks at his sister, and a tiny smile tugs at her mouth.  The boy smiles back.  The girl giggles. The boy laughs outright.  They have re-discovered happiness. \nThey look back at Helmut, both laughing. \nCLOSE SHOT - SISTERS \nThe older girl is ten or eleven; her sister five or six, tugs at her arm, and the older girl bends down to her.  The younger girl whispers to her, pointing to Helmut, and the older girl picks her up.  The little one puts her arms tightly around her sister's neck.  Both laugh merrily. \nMED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT \nHe is putting on Franz's too-small jacket.  He tries to button it, but it won't go around him.  He sucks in his belly, but then his pants begin to slip, and he grabs at them with an embarrassed look at the laughing children. \nDeciding that the only way to button the coat is to hunch his shoulders, he tries that, but now his shoulders must remain hunched.  He manages to pick up the broom and puts it over his shoulder, playing soldier.  But when he tries to snap to attention, the coat pops open again, bringing another roar of laughter from Helmut's audience. \nNow he marches a few steps toward the CAMERA, stops, snappily puts the rifle down at rest position and salutes -- knocking himself flat.  Another roar of laughter.  As it swells, we -- \nPAN SHOT - JEWISH PRISONERS \nThe laughter o.s. continues to swell as the CAMERA PANS across the faces of the adult Jewish prisoners huddled near their huts.  They smile, fearfully at first, then break into timorous laughter. \nARYAN PRISONERS - PAN SHOT \nAs the laughter swells even more, the CAMERA MOVES over the faces of the political prisoners on Helmut's side of the camp.  They, too, are laughing -- some tolerantly; some at Helmut rather than with him, but they are laughing. \nAs the laughter continues to SWELL, the CAMERA PANS over to yard-guard.  He is trying very hard not to laugh.  The result is a self-conscious giggle. \nAs the laughter grows even louder, the CAMERA PANS as though wafted on the waves of laughter, up to a guardtower, and we see two rifle-armed soldiers in the tower watching the performance below them.  They gesture in Helmut's direction and laugh. \nThe CAMERA continues to PAN over to the administration building and UP to an open window on the second floor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - FULL SHOT - DAY \nLT. SCHARFF, handsome, mid-30's, stands with his back to CAMERA at an open window in a small, but luxuriously furnished office.  The window through which he is looking opens onto the prison yard.  An AIDE pokes his head in the doorway. \nAIDE (in a loud whisper) He's coming back down the hall. \nScharff nods, quickly closes the window, gives a look around the room, and follows the Aide out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMMANDANT'S OUTER OFFICE - FULL SHOT \nAs Scharff comes through the door from the adjoining room. The Aide is standing in front of a small desk.  Scharff takes his position beside the door into the outer office.  They wait.  After a beat, the room's other door opens and in comes COL. HEINRICH BESTLER, a slightly built, pinch-faced SS officer in his 50's.  Scharff and Aide spring to attention and give him the salute. \nSCHARFF AND AIDE Heil Hitler. \nBESTLER Heil Hitler. (striding into his inner office as he passes Scharff) \nBESTLER (continuing) Come in. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - FULL SHOT \nBESTLER Not his clown name, you idiot.  His number.  His identification. \nSCHARFF If I have the Colonel's permission to leave, I will check it at once. \nBESTLER Later.  Right now I want these performances halted.  Understand? \nSCHARFF Yes, sir. \nBestler begins shuffling papers from the folder.  Scharff, uncertain whether he has been dismissed or not, hesitates. Bestler glances up. \nBESTLER (shouting) Immediately! \nSCHARFF Yes, sir ! \nHe salutes and bolts from the room, almost crashing into the door in his flight. \nCUT TO: \nPRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY \nShooting past the children in f.g. to Helmut through the fence, as he bows to the applauding youngsters.  Behind him we can see a number of soldier-guards coming through the cordon of watching prisoners, and waving them to disperse. They do so reluctantly, as the guard from Helmut's barrack moves forward to Helmut, who is just about to start another routine. \nGUARD (shouting) That's all.  Show's over.  Everybody clear out. \nHelmut stops, startled. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD \nANGLED to include children across the fence. \nHELMUT What's wrong? \nGUARD (to Helmut) Get back to the barrack. (to children) You heard me.  Show's over. \nThe children don't move, but stand staring at Helmut as if waiting for him to tell them what to do.  This frustrates the guard, who isn't accustomed to being questioned. \nGUARD Go on.  Get away. \nStill the children refuse to budge.  Angry, the guard goes close to the fence, waving his arms at them. \nGUARD Move, damn it, before I come over there and... \nThe youngsters scuttle back a few feet fearfully, but there they stop, their eyes still on Helmut.  The guard turns to Helmut. \nGUARD Get them moving before somebody gets hurt. \nHelmut goes up to the fence and speaks to the children softly. \nHELMUT That's all the show for today.  Go back inside. \nThe children back away with long faces.  Finally convinced that Helmut is through, they turn and wander back toward their barracks, but with many a backward look at him.  Helmut continues to encourage them, as the guard looks on. \nHELMUT That's right now, go along.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye. Until tomorrow. \nMany of the children wave to him.  The guard takes Helmut by the arm, turns him toward the barrack and hustles him off. \nMED. TWO SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD \nThe CAMERA MOVES BACK as they come toward it, the guard firmly propelling Helmut along. \nGUARD Get inside and take that stuff off your face. \nHELMUT I don't understand.  What's the matter? \nGUARD Orders.  No more shows. \nHELMUT You mean... not ever? \nGUARD That's right. \nHELMUT But we weren't doing any harm. \nGUARD The Commandant thinks you are. \nHELMUT The Commandant? \nGUARD The new Commandant.  He minds. \nHELMUT Just because I make them laugh a little... \nGUARD You know the rule... no mixing with Jews. \nHELMUT I wasn't mixing!  I was only... \nThe guard stops him and turns him so that they are face to face.  The CAMERA MOVES UP TO -- \nTIGHT TWO SHOT - HELMUT, GUARD \nGUARD (quietly, threatening) Look, it's not my order.  It's the Commandant's. (more kindly) Now do what I tell you and save yourself a lot of grief. \nHe pushes Helmut toward his barrack and then turns and walks off, the CAMERA PULLING BACK to -- \nWIDER ANGLE \nHelmut watches the guard go, then, dejectedly, shuffles toward his barrack.  As he nears it, Keltner, Franz, Adolf, Herman, Ludwig, and the other regulars intercept him. \nHelmut goes to the door and looks out. \nCUT TO: \nLONG SHOT - CHILDREN AT THE FENCE - HELMUT'S POV \nThe children are still pressed against the fence, still trying to get a glimpse of Helmut \nCUT TO: \nMED. SHOT - BARRACK \"H\" \nHelmut stands just inside the doorway... looking out. \nHELMUT I wish to God I didn't care.  I wish to God I could forget them. \nHelmut walks back to Keltner. \nHELMUT But I can't. \nHelmut looks at Keltner, his eyes pleading for help. \nKELTNER I'm going to ask you a question, Helmut, and I want you to think carefully before you answer. \nHelmut nods. \nKELTNER The reason you can't get them out of your mind -- is it because you need them -- for you audience? \nHelmut drops his eyes as he attempts to find the right answer. \nKELTNER I want the truth. \nHELMUT (after a moment) I know I can't perform for them anymore.  I know that. (a beat) I really don't know what the reason is.  I think it's got something to do with... well, I don't want those little ones to think I've turned against them, too.  That's why I've got to do something.  Something. \nKeltner studies Helmut for a moment. \nKELTNER You'll be taking a chance.  A great chance. \nHelmut nods that he know this. \nKELTNER (very definite) All right!  Come on then. \nHELMUT Where are you going? \nKELTNER You want to talk to the children? Well, I think I can help you. \nHELMUT There's no reason for you to get involved in this. \nKELTNER Reason?  When war is waged against children!  That is reason enough for the whole damn world to get involved. And it will, believe me, it will. \nKeltner puts his arm around Helmut's shoulder.  Helmut grins, a broad grin of thanks. \nKELTNER So, come on, Doork the Great, let's start getting involved. \nThey both walk quickly to the door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HELMUT'S BARRACK - DAY \nAs Keltner and Helmut come out.  In the b.g. we can see the soccer game still going on, the players shouting excitedly at each other.  Keltner surveys the scene for a moment. \nKELTNER Wait here. \nHe moves down the line of barracks toward the mess hall. \nEXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY \nAs Keltner moves among the men lounging around the barracks, talking and watching the soccer game.  Trying to appear as nonchalant as possible, we whispers something to a group of prisoners.  They glance back at Helmut and then nod.  Keltner moves on to another group, taking care to avoid the two yard guards, one of which is the guard in charge of Barrack \"H\". Again Keltner murmurs something to the other prisoners, and again they look at Helmut and nod assent.  Keltner goes on to another group.  As he does, the men in the first group casually disperse and start across the yard toward the fence, moving around the soccer players.  One of them goes up to Ludwig, who is playing in the match, and whispers something to him.  Ludwig nods, and the other prisoners move away. Ludwig runs off chasing the \"ball\". \nMED. SHOT - LUDWIG \nas he storms into a clutch of players, including Galt, all kicking at the \"ball\". \nLUDWIG (low to Galt) Kessler is going to talk to the children. Cover him. \nGALT (mean) Who says so? \nLUDWIG (evenly) The Reverend says cover him... so we cover him. \nThe players around Galt give him a meaningful look and he gets their message. \nGALT All right!  I was just asking. \nFULL SHOT \nAs Keltner's plot takes shape, we see a dozen or so prisoners wander, apparently aimlessly, across the yard and form a spectator's section for the soccer game with their backs to the fence, thus providing a shield between the children and the guards.  The game picks up tempo, but the play somehow stays in the center of the yard, strengthening the shield. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT \nAs he watches the plan in action.  Keltner rejoins him. \nKELTNER You know what to do? \nHelmut nods. \nThe prisoners are still rooting for the soccer players, but as Helmut looks, Adolf, in the middle of the cheering section, turns and sees him. \nADOLF (a hushed call) Hurry up. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN \nHelmut nods to Adolf and then turns back to the youngsters, afraid but still unable to tear himself away. \nHELMUT Here.  Look.  I'll show you... No noise now. \nIn pantomime, he pretends to pull a hair from his head and threads it through an imaginary needle.  Finally accomplishing this, he pretends to be sewing a button on his jacket, holding the thumb of his left hand under the button while he sews with his right.  When he has finished, he pantomimes that he has sews his thumb to the jacket.  He pretends to be embarrassed and tries to hide his hand in his trouser pocket, but in order to put his hand in his pocket the jacket goes too.  The children giggle, then roar with laughter at his frantic efforts to detach his thumb from his jacket. \nThe silent children press closer to watch Helmut's antics. Some look at each other and smile, then grin.  Suddenly the entire group is laughing.  Helmut holds up his hands for silence, but the grin on his face says he loves it. \nHELMUT No, no, be quiet.  Be quiet.  Shhh. Shhhh. \nThe children go on laughing as if this is just part of the game. \nMED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS \nThe SOUND of the children's laughter floats up to two guards in a tower on the non-Aryan side of camp.  One of them, who has been watching the soccer game below, nudges his partner and points down to Helmut. \nLONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - GUARDS' POV \nBetween the children at the fence and the line of soccer spectators we can see only the top of Helmut's head bobbing up and down.  But that is enough. \nMED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS \nAfter a long look, one of the guards picks up a telephone and starts to make a call. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN \nHelmut seems to have thrown caution away under the stimulus of the children's laughter.  He is on his feet trying a hand spring.  He lands flat on his back, but rolls over on his side and grins broadly at his audience, which laughs appreciatively.  This is the old Doork.  Their Doork.  Again Helmut tries the hand spring and again he flops. \nFULL SHOT - PRISON YARD \nA HIGH ANGLE with Helmut and the children in f.g. and beyond them the Aryan side of the yard.  The soccer game is still in progress, with the spectators on both sides of the action whooping it up.  Then in b.g. we see two soldiers, two SS officers, and the guard in charge of barracks \"H\", come bursting through the spectators near the huts and into the game itself.  The players slowly subside as they realize what is happening.  They watch the guard cross the yard. The cheering trails off, and the yard becomes strangely quiet, the prisoners' warning to Helmut. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN \nOblivious to all this in his joy at performing for the children again, Helmut is just pretending to slip on something underfoot.  His arms flay the air as he tries to regain his balance, but he falls.  Through this, however, the children seem to be watching something behind Helmut, and when he lands on the ground, they do not laugh. \nAgain their faces are frightened as they look o.s.  Helmut looks at them, puzzled.  Then, realizing that something is wrong, he turns and looks up from the ground. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING PAST Helmut in f.g. toward the guard, SS men, and soldiers, who have come through the line of spectators and stand glowering at him.  The prisoners have moved back, warily watching for the next move. \nGUARD You wouldn't listen, would you? \nAlmost wearily, he goes to the fence.  This isn't something he likes, but his authority is at stake here, and he has no choice.  As the CAMERA PANS him to the fence we see that some non-Aryan adults have drifted over to see what the disturbance is. \nGUARD (to the children) Go on.  Get back. \nThe children don't move.  Their eyes are on Helmut.  The guard shouts over to the adults standing behind the children. \nGUARD You back there, get them out of here. \nThe adults begin to gather up the children. \nHELMUT They had nothing to do with it.  It was all my doing. \nThe guard turns and comes up to face Helmut.  He studies him for a moment, then hits him a vicious backhand slap across the face.  Taken by surprise, Helmut staggers backward and falls.  A murmur runs through the prisoners.  The children still near the fence, cry out with alarm.  Seeing their terror, Helmut is determined to make it look like just another act.  With a painful effort he gets to his feet, smiles at the children, turns and salutes the guard, knocking himself down again.  A couple of children giggle.  The FIRST SS OFFICER quickly steps forward to stand behind the guard. \nHe holds a swagger stick in his right hand, which he repeatedly whacks into the palm of his left hand.  He looks down at Helmut. \nFIRST SS OFFICER Get up. \nHelmut struggles to his feet.  He glances over at the children.  They are all watching him.  He takes a deep breath, winks at the little ones, then salaams before the SS Officer and the guard.  Some of the children giggle.  This infuriates the SS officer.  He raises the swagger stick and brings it down hard on Helmut's head knocking him to his knees.  The children scream with terror.  The SS Officer raises the stick to hit Helmut again, but Keltner, in an almost instinctive reaction, catches hold of his arm. \nKELTNER The children! Not in front of the children! \nTWO SHOT - FIRST SS OFFICER - KELTNER \nThe SS Officer turns and brings the stick down on Keltner. He hits him over and over, each blow more vicious. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT - FRIGHTENED CHILDREN IN B.G. \nHelmut turns away from the beating, pulls his jacket up over his head and starts to walk around like a headless man stumbling and falling over his own feet.  The children, many still screaming, turn their eyes away from the SS Officer to watch Helmut's antics. \nFULL SHOT - FRANZ, GALT, UHLMANN, LUDWIG, ADOLF, HERMAN AND OTHER PRISONERS \nThe horror-stricken men stand frozen as the SS Officer continues to hit Keltner until he drops to the ground. Suddenly Franz breaks away from the men and charges at the First SS Officer. \nMED. SHOT - SS OFFICER - FRANZ \nFranz runs INTO CAMERA and attempts to stop the First SS Officer.  The Second SS Officer whips his pistol out, aims carefully and FIRES a shot into Franz's head. \nVARIOUS SHOTS OF THE PRISONERS \nUhlmann stands speechless and dumbfounded.  Galt cowers. Beads of perspiration pour from his brow.  Adolf weeps bitter tears as Herman places his arm around his shoulder to comfort him, and himself as well.  Ludwig, dead to any emotion, simply turns and walks away into the crowd. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT \nHelmut is now, more than ever, the clown, as he goes into a frenzied version of the \"Clap Dance\".  The complete incongruity of his behavior leaves the spectators stunned. \nBOY W-I-L-L-I-E. \nHELMUT Fine.  I'll just write that on top of your head. \nUsing the eraser end of the pencil, Helmut carefully traces the letters on top of the boy's head.  The youngster peers upward, wondering. \nHELMUT There.  See, this way we'll all be able to tell everybody else's name just by looking at his head. \nCLOSE SHOT - BOY \nstill looking up, but now doubtful. \nBOY Did you really? \nMED. SHOT - THE GROUP \nHELMUT Of course I did.  Here... \nHe pulls an older boy to his feet, winks at him and points to the first boy's head. \nHELMUT (to the older boy) Tell him what it says. \nOLDER BOY (giggling) It says Willie. \nBOY (impressed) Really?  Truly? \nHe puts his hand to his head. \nHELMUT Be careful.  Don't smear it. (he glances around) Let's see now... Yes.  You shall be next. \nHe points to a Czech girl of about six.  He motions for her to come over to him.  She shyly bows her head.  Her friends push her forward. Helmut holds out his hand to her, she grabs it. \nHELMUT What is your name? \nShe looks at him, then at the other Czech children.  They all giggle. \nHELMUT (squatting down beside her) Forgive me.  I don't speak your language. \nHe gently plants a kiss on her cheek and she puts an arm around his neck. \nHELMUT (to others) See!  We understand each other. Now... (he points to Willie) Willie. (he points to himself) Doork. (points again to Willie) Willie. (pointing to himself) Doork. \nThe child's eyes light up and she whispers into Helmut's ear. \nHELMUT A beautiful name!  Now you tell all the children. \nCZECH GIRL (almost a whisper) Inga. \nHELMUT It's such a pretty name... say it again. \nCZECH GIRL (more sure of herself) Inga! \nShe quickly bows her head for Helmut to outline her name on the top of it. \nHELMUT (with a flourish of his pencil) I-N-G-A.  There it is. \nThe little girl gives a quick curtsy and hurries back to her group.  Helmut glances around at the children. \nHELMUT Let's see now.  Who wants to be next. \nThe little girl with the doll presses forward. \nHELMUT You? \nShaking her head she holds up the doll. \nHELMUT Her? \nLITTLE GIRL So the little children will know her name. \nHELMUT Of course.  That way she can't get lost, can she?  What's her name? \nLITTLE GIRL Frederika. \nHELMUT (mock dismay) Frederika? \nHe studies the top of doll's tiny head.  Then he holds up his hand and measures off a distance of about three inches in the air with thumb and forefinger. \nHELMUT Frederika! \nNext he puts the doll's head between his thumb and forefinger, illustrating that the head is too small for the name. \nHELMUT Couldn't we just make it Freda? \nLITTLE GIRL (solemnly) Oh, no!  Frederika. \nHelmut shrugs, closes one eye and begins writing in tiny letters on the doll's head.  The children laugh delightedly. \nEXT. RAILROAD SIDING - FULL SHOT - DAY \nSergeant Hoffmann is walking his post beside the open door of the boxcar.  Inside we can see Helmut and the children and HEAR their laughter. \nThe CAMERA PANS over to the staff car, where Scharff sits in the front seat smoking a cigarette and waiting. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMED. SHOT - SERGEANT HOFFMAN \nWith a cautious look around, he reaches under the waiting boxcar and brings out a box-type, battery operated lantern. He goes to the boxcar door and peers inside. \nSERGEANT HOFFMAN (calling) All right, clown, time to get off. \nHelmut appears at the door and looks down. \nHELMUT What is it? \nSERGEANT HOFFMAN Train is here.  They are hooking it up now. (he hoists the lantern inside) Here.  Tell them not to light it up until the doors are closed. \nHelmut gives him a look of deep gratitude. \nSERGEANT HOFFMAN (curtly) And get off right now. \nJust then the boxcar is jolted as the locomotive makes contact and Hoffman runs off toward the front of the car. \nINT. BOXCAR - EVENING \nThe jolt has awakened several of the children, who gather around Helmut in the dimness of the car, frightened and bewildered. \nCHILDREN We're moving.  What's happening? What was the noise?  Doork, where are we going? \nHELMUT (forced gaiety) It's nothing.  You're going for a train ride.  What do you think of that?  A real train ride. \nCHILDREN (pressing close -- sensing his anxiety) Is it far?  Are you coming, too?  I don't want a train ride. \nHELMUT Oh, it'll be fun.  I would like to come, but I don't think I can. \nCHILDREN (pleading) Please come, Doork.  Please.  Please. Please. \nHELMUT I can't.  They want me to stay here. \nThere are cries from the children, whose pleading eyes make Helmut terribly uncomfortable.  He backs toward the door. \nHELMUT But... I'll come to see you.  Soon as I can. And, I want you all to promise me to be very good.  No crying. \nThe children stare at him silently, their eyes unconsciously accusing.  With him goes all their security.  Helmut knows it, but he has no choice.  When he reaches the door... \nHELMUT If you want me...  remember, just close your eyes. \nCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL WITH THE DARK EYES \nWordlessly, she shuts her eyes -- tight. \nPAN SHOT - CHILDREN \nFollowing the dark-eyed girl's example, the smaller children one by one, close their eyes. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nNear tears with emotion, he wavers.  Then with great control.. \nHELMUT (huskily) Goodbye. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT \nHe turns and sits down on the floor of the car with his feet hanging outside.  He is just about to jump down when he is stopped by a LOUD WAIL of anguish from one of the children behind him.  He turns and looks back at them. \nMED. SHOT - CHILDREN - HELMUT'S POV \nA BOY of about six, one of the Czech youngsters, is crying with the dejection of a lad who has just lost everything. The other little Czechs and the older girl who first recognized Helmut at the boxcar door are trying unsuccessfully to console him.  Between cooing and patting the boy's shoulder, the girl throws accusing looks at Helmut. \nWIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE HELMUT \nUncertain what to do, Helmut glances around outside. Satisfied that the train isn't going to move at once, he gets up and goes to the children. \nHELMUT What's this now?  Crying?  After all the fun we've had? \nThe boy only looks at Helmut and goes right on crying.  Helmut looks helplessly at the older girl. \nGIRL It's his birthday.  He thought there would be presents. \nHELMUT (to girl) He's a Czech.   Do you speak... \nGIRL (annoyed) Of course not! \nHelmut is angry with the girl because he really wants to get off the train and yet can't because of the accusing look in her eyes. \nHELMUT (pointedly) Then how do you know it's his... birthday? \nGIRL (with typical child logic) He told me. \nHELMUT He speaks German? \nGIRL No. \nHELMUT But he told you it's his birthday? \nThe girl nods firmly as do the other children.  The boy watches it all, wide-eyed.  Helmut figures to put an end to this. \nHELMUT What date is this? \nGIRL (after thinking it over) Why, it's his birthday! \nSCHARFF Kessler in the car? \nSERGEANT HOFFMAN Kessler? \nSCHARFF The clown? \nSERGEANT HOFFMAN (looking around) I... I guess he is, sir. \nSCHARFF You GUESS! \nScharff races to the car with Sergeant Hoffman right behind him. The CAMERA FOLLOWS them. \nScharff peers inside and finds the car empty.  With an angry glance at Hoffman, he hurries to the truck and looks in the cab.  It too is empty. \nSCHARFF (moving back toward Hoffman) I told you to get him off the train. \nSERGEANT HOFFMAN I told him, sir.  HE was standing right by the door.  I'm sure he got off. \nSCHARFF Did you see him? \nSERGEANT HOFFMAN Why, I... \nSCHARFF DID you? \nSERGEANT HOFFMAN You told me to see that the car was coupled on.  When I came back... Why wouldn't he get off? \nSCHARFF Idiot! (shouting) Guards.  GUARDS! \nThe other soldiers come running from o.s. \nSCHARFF The clown prisoner is missing.  He may have escaped.  Search the area. If he got off the train he must be around here someplace. \nThe soldiers rush o.s. into the deepening darkness. \nCLOSE TWO SHOT - SCHARFF, HOFFMAN \nSCHARFF You know what happens if he gets away. \nSERGEANT HOFFMAN (hopefully) He can't get very far. \nScharff looks o.s. after the disappearing train. \nSCHARFF If he's on that train -- he's going farther than you know --- \nCUT TO: \nLONG SHOT - TRAIN - EVENING (STOCK) \nThe rear of the boxcar is just disappearing from sight in the darkness. \nCLOSEUP - SCHARFF \nSCHARFF ... or he knows. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BOXCAR - MOVING - DAY \nIt is the next morning.  Light is coming from the vents and the lantern which hangs from a peg in the middle of the right side of the car.  Helmut is asleep on the floor with the children huddled around him.  He lies on his side with one arm thrown protectively over the little Czech girl, Inga, and Willie.  Behind him, the Czech birthday boy and the girl with the doll are cuddled close to him.  Other youngsters have their heads on his legs and feet, and all are as close to him as they can get. \nHe is, in fact, a sort of human bed.  From the train NOISES o.s. we can tell that the freight train is slowing down. Then, with a jolt, it stops, and o.s. we HEAR a truck engine approaching.  Helmut stirs and sits up, trying to get his bearings.  This arouses some of the children and they too sit up and look around. \nCHILDREN What is it?  Are we there, Doork? Where are we?  Why are we stopping? \nHELMUT I don't know. \nHe untangles himself, rises and stretches his numbed arms and legs.  He starts toward the door, but it slides open suddenly and a BURLY GUARD vaults inside.   Behind him we see a truck similar to a moving van being backed up to the boxcar.  Helmut blinks uncertainly at the light pouring through the door. \nBURLY GUARD Everybody up.  No noise. \nThe children are too startled to move.  The guard notices Helmut and reacts. \nBURLY GUARD Who the hell are you? \nHELMUT Where are we? \nBURLY GUARD How the devil did you get in here? \nHELMUT I... I'm from the other prison.  Got locked in -- by accident. \nBURLY GUARD Ah, for... (shouting out the door) Sergeant! \nCUT TO: \nEXT BOXCAR - DAY \nWe see now that the train has stopped at an isolated siding. The truck has backed up almost to the door of the boxcar.  A SERGEANT climbs down from the cab of the van and hurries to the boxcar door, the CAMERA PANNING him there. \nSERGEANT What's the matter? \nBURLY GUARD Look at this.  He's from the other camp.  Got in here with the shipment. \nSERGEANT How did that happen? \nHELMUT I... I was taking care of the children back there and... accidentally got locked in. \n", "test1_input": "GUARD (as he finishes his walk) You are a sick looking group of things...  I can't even call you human...  because you're not... you're all lice...  DISMISSED! \nThe men break up and go about their business, they move in all directions, but Keltner starts for the doorway to the barracks and is detoured by the guard who knew he would, as he stands in the way of Keltner who has to turn away and go about his business... the Guard peeks into the barracks. \nINT. BARRACKS - GUARD'S POV - DAY \nHelmut still sleeping... \nEXT. BARRACKS - CLOSE - GUARD - DAY \nHe is delighted... he grabs the door and slams it shut with a bang that would wake the dead... then opens it again and walks off... \nINT. BARRACKS - CLOSE - HELMUT - DAY \nHe jumps from out of his hard sleep... foggy and unsure about where he is, what time it is and he looks around and sees the barracks are empty... and he panics... but he is also shivering... the barracks feel like the inside of a meat truck refrigerated somewhat below zero... \nHelmut grabs his pants from the front of his bunk, pulls the cover over him and tries to get the pants on under the cover... It is cold!  (Photographically, we can show \"cold\"... Props:  vapor/smoke.) \nHe gets his pants on and jumps down onto the cold floor and dances from the ice-like floor, he bends down looking for his socks and shoes... he wears just a tee-shirt... \nHaving trouble finding both shoes, he grabs the blanket again and covers himself with it, while searching for the other shoe... \nHe finds the other shoe and proceeds to put them on... takes a beat and sees he has no socks on... reaches under the bank and pulls out the pair of socks... which stand straight up (from the cold ... he holds them in the air, and drops one at a time and they sound like \"pans\" hitting the floor... he takes one and blows warm air from his mouth into the socks, one at a time, which warms them... (Props:  the socks need discussion!) \nHe then proceeds to put his shoes on and puts one on, and then the other... now wearing both shoes he starts to tie the laces... he pulls them straight away to tie and they stand straight up!  (Props:  this is done with leather laces, pure leather... it works without any unnecessary rigging!) \nINSERT - THE STANDING STRAIGHT LACES \nBACK TO SCENE \nHe finally gets them tied and starts, still sleepily, into the toilet area... (We can go for a great sound joke here.) He steps into the latrine, closes the door and we HEAR the SOUND of crushed ice being poured into the bowl... he flushes and we HEAR what might sound like an ice crusher... he steps out of the latrine and walks over to the basin and turns the water on. \nINSERT \nThe water spigots... they both read \"COLD\". \nBACK TO SCENE \nAnd as he takes some water on his hands to his face... it is \"cold\" and his face just freezes from the pain of the cold... he looks around and sees the little metal ashtray, that looks like a small bowl or a tin from a used shaving cream lather soap... he fills it with water.. and to show his ingenuity, he takes a lighter from his pocket, places the tin on the edge of the sink and lights the fire under the tin (which couldn't possibly hold more than a handful of water) and proceeds to heat same... \nOnce he is satisfied that it is at least warmer than the spigot supplied, he grabs for the tin which is so hot from the burning, he screams in another type pain... the pain of \"HOT\" hurting... he decides to flick his fingers in the tin bowl and splash some of the water on his face (which is by now, just drips of water)... brushes his teeth with his finger and soap... straightens his hair and exits the toilet to his bunk to get his shirt... another \"ICE COLD\" item... he feels how cold it is, and doesn't have the courage for another climate blast... he rolls up his shirt and places it under his armpit to warm it... as it hits under his arm... the cold just about wipes him out... he decides to sit on it... and he does. \nCLOSE - THE GUARD - AT THE DOOR \nHe's been peeking all the while... He figures he's had his laugh, and it's the first time we see he can laugh... he steps into the barracks area, and yells: \nGUARD Doork!  Move it out, and on the double!! \nHelmut jumps with fright, unravels his shirt, runs towards the open door putting on his shirt as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT \nMost of the men are clustered around their bunks, and in the dull light we see some of them in the aisles, talking, playing cards... while most of the others are whistling, clapping, and laughing as Uhlmann does his silly little clog dance... it is apparent the ugly episode between Galt and Uhlmann has been forgotten for the moment. \nThe lights are hung from cords down off the ceiling and for a complex this size it could use ten... there are but two. \nUhlmann is having the time of his ignorant life... the more the men applaud, the more he \"clog dances\". \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - LUDWIG AND ADOLF \nThey are both seated on their top bunk, Adolf enjoying the poor dance Uhlmann is giving as Ludwig looks down the aisle towards Helmut's bunk. \nLUDWIG (nudging Adolf) It looks like Helmut found some new ears to listen to his Super Star fantasies... \nAdolf takes a look, shrugs his shoulder, as if to say I couldn't care less... and goes on watching the action of Uhlmann and the other men... \nLUDWIG (to himself, but for Adolf to hear as well; a la Shakespeare, mimicking Helmut) Ringling Brothers would have done anything for me to appear with them but I had to do what was best for me! \nCLOSE - HELMUT AND THE FOUR NEW PRISONERS \nThe four new men are surrounding Helmut on the top of his bunk listening to his bragging. \nHELMUT So I told Mr. Ringling if he wanted \"Helmut\" he'd have to bring his circus to Germany... I am a German, I told him, and my responsibility is to my own people who are my biggest fans. \n1ST PRISONER (NEW ONE) Did you really say that? \nHELMUT (proudly) Of course I did... they offered me anything...  anything I wanted to go with them. \n2ND NEW PRISONER Hey! I saw the circus in Berlin about four years ago...  Didn't  you make your entrance in a long tail coat with a pair of tails on the jacket about fifty feet long?  Sure!  And a funny Little clown at the very end carrying the tails like a woman's train? \nHelmut studies the prisoners glare and decides he couldn't even remember the clown he saw was Gustav the Great, why not?  No one would ever know... and he nods with a kind of studied humility... yes. \n2ND NEW PRISONER You were great! \nHelmut eats it up. \n2ND NEW PRISONER You should have seen him... You'd never know it was him... with the long tails  and white tie... red nose...  long hair...  and a battered top hat... with the hair hanging way down to his shoulders...  and, ah, let me see... oh, yeah... your mouth went from ear to ear. \nHELMUT (softly) Right! \n3RD NEW PRISONER How do \"clowns\" ever come up with such ideas for faces and make-up? \nHELMUT It doesn't happen overnight... it takes years and years... You try many faces, then finally you hit the one that's just right for you. \n", "test1_true": "His voice trails off as he realizes the hopelessness of what he was about to say.  This puts a damper on the discussion and the men start to break up and get down off the bunk. Helmut, seeing his captive audience leaving... panics. \nHELMUT (emotionally) Wait, let me tell you some other things...  I mean things that are really exciting and...  please! Please... let me just have a few more... \n1ST NEW PRISONER (ignoring Helmut completely) What's going on with those guys? \nHe's looking off down the aisle where Uhlmann has his audience... The four prisoners move out into the aisle to get a better look, leaving Helmut perched on his bunk with a pleading and broken look of despair... \nHELMUT (a last attempt) Did you know \"clowns\" literally bequeath their faces to their sons, or sometimes to... \nHe realizes it's futile as the four new prisoners move towards Uhlmann and the others down the aisle... \n3RD PRISONER Come on, let's see what's such fun... \nHe moves and the others move along with him.  Helmut thinks about joining them, and starts to move off his bunk but his body won't respond... he just hangs there limply... his head lowered, a sad man. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSHOOTING OVER the men placing Helmut in the very deep  b.g. as we see the four new prisoners walk over to watch the action... \nMED. CLOSE - UHLMANN, GALT, KELTNER, AND OTHERS \nUhlmann is just finishing his dance with a spin, when he finally gets dizzy and topples over on one of the bunks. All the men applaud wildly.  Uhlmann laying half down and half up on the lower bunk he landed on, breathing heavily... yells over to Galt... \nUHLMANN Hey, Galt, it's your turn, how about doin' one of your belly dances for us? \nAll the men agree and start yelling for Galt to do it... Galt moves out into the center of the aisle in the clearing made by the men, and holds up his hands for silence... they quiet down and Galt looks around until he spots Keltner. \nGALT Reverend? \nThe men become very still, they look from Galt to Keltner and back to Galt, their eyes reflecting suspicion of him, wondering what he's up to now.  Galt is fully aware of this. \nGALT Well, Reverend, what do you think? Would a little belly-dancing be too much for the boys? \nKeltner studies Galt for a beat, then accepts his offer of a truce. \nKELTNER (moving over towards Galt) A little fun is what we need... so... if you'll all hold the noise down, I'll join in. \nA hushed cheer goes up from the men as Keltner stands besides Galt.  Galt holds his hands over his head and nods for Keltner to do the same thing.  The Reverend does, and now Galt begins undulating his hips.  Keltner studies the move for a beat and then does the same thing but with comical awkwardness. Franz starts playing a slow sensuous rhythm on his harmonica. The men clap and whistle softly. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nHe is sitting upright on top of his bunk, watching what Galt has Keltner doing, a look of disgust passes his face as he turns away from what he'd been watching and gets busy with his papers and figuring again. \nMED. SHOT - GALT, KELTNER \nThey are just finishing their dance.  The men applaud wildly but softly... Keltner, puffing, moves over to the side and sits on one of the bunks to catch his breath.  Galt takes a few bows, and the men react with applause and whistling that's beginning to take on \"noise\" proportions... Keltner motions for the men to hold it down... and they do. \n4TH NEW PRISONER Say, why don't we get the clown to do something? \nGALT A clown?  Who's a clown?? \nHERMAN You've heard of \"Helmut Doork\". That's him down there! \nLUDWIG Don't waste your time.  You'll never get the Great Doork to do anything. \nWIDER SHOT \nas he starts walking towards Helmut's bunk... \n1ST NEW PRISONER Oh, I'm sure he will! \nThe others follow right behind.  There is a look on Keltner's face like he would like to stop them, but between his puffing and his certainty that Helmut will be alright, he stays where he is. \nCLOSE - ADOLF \nas he walks with the others. \nADOLF You're wasting your time.  He doesn't perform for the likes of us... he'll turn you down. \nLUDWIG He's right, we've been asking him for three years...  I have a feeling he only does his little routines for the crowned heads of Europe. \nADOLF And, of course, the BIG heads of Berlin. \nThere is general laughter... as the group arrives at Helmut's bunk. \nCLOSE - HELMUT \nHe sees something's going to happen, he puts his papers away and sits upright... waiting... his eyes catch Galt's eyes peering at him. \nGalt tells it all with his eyes... This one isn't \"sacred\" to the men... he might just be the pigeon Galt's been hoping for... the one every bully looks for, for his own brand of fun. \n1ST PRISONER How about it, Doork? \nHELMUT (swinging his legs around ready to jump down) I'd like to, but I can't... really... I can't. \nGALT (strongly) Can't?  Did I hear you say you can't? \nHELMUT (it stops him in his tracks; he stays up on the bunk) I'd like to do something... but... (pointing to the 2nd New Prisoner) He can tell you... He's seen me work...  I need props... make-up... I work with a lot of different things... \n2ND NEW PRISONER That's right... I did... and he does! \nHELMUT (in fast) Sure, tell them... I can't just do anything...  I need lights, props, my costume. \n", "test2_input": "SCHARFF You see, sir, he's been trying to get a review of his case.  Claims he's here by mistake.  I could tell him you would recommend the review. \nBESTLER A man who wants something.  Good. Very good strategy, Lieutenant. (he turns to face Scharff) However, when you bring him back here, return him to solitary and keep him there. (a beat) I've seen the best of men, after several years in solitary, unable to remember even their own names. \nSCHARFF Then I have your permission to take the clown. \nBESTLER Permission granted. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLONG SHOT - OPEN ROAD - DAY \nA small open truck with 12 soldiers in the back, followed by a staff car, move along the road. \nINT. STAFF CAR - MOVING - DAY \nDRIVER is in the front seat, Helmut and Scharff in the back. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT - SCHARFF \nHelmut has been cleaned up, but still shows the effects of the beating and his stay in solitary.  Holding a small mirror, he is applying his makeup.  He occasionally closes or tries to shade his eyes from the light.  They ride on in silence. Scharff stares straight ahead. \nHELMUT Wish you could've gotten the big shoes.  The children laugh so when they see them flopping up and down. \nScharff makes no reply.  Helmut starts to put on his big black mouth. \nHELMUT (a touch of the old arrogance) The Commandant, himself, asked for me! (a beat) You say he's personally requesting a review of my case!  Why, that means I'm practically on my way back to Berlin. (studies mouth in mirror) Should be red.  Mouth looks better in red. (a beat) Know the first thing I'm going to do when I get to Berlin?  Buy an overcoat with a fur collar.  Had such a coat. Very elegant. Very elegant. (finishing the up- turned corners of mouth) It's a good idea... moving the children. \nScharff reacts to this.  He looks sharply at Helmut. \nHELMUT Prison's no place for children. I said all along that it was some kind of mistake. \nSCHARFF (uncomfortable) Finish your makeup.  We're almost there. \nHELMUT Know what Johann Keltner said? \nSCHARFF Who? \nHELMUT Keltner.  From my barracks.  The minister. He said... Let me think. He said... men who wage war on children. That's it. Men who wage war on children... commit such a crime... (a beat as he thinks) ... such a heinous crime.  That's it.  Men who wage war on children commit such a heinous crime that even the devil damns their souls. \nScharff looks as though he'd just been slapped across the face.  He quickly turns toward the window.  Helmut inspects his reflection in the mirror as he draws black vertical lines down over each eye -- giving him a very lost, sad, dejected look. \nEXT, RAILROAD SIDING - LONG SHOT - DAY \nas the truck and staff car leave the highway and jolt down a short roadway to a railroad siding where a boxcar sits on the tracks.  Uniformed GUARDS stand watch on both sides of the car, which has the door nearest the CAMERA, partially open.  The truck and staff car pull up to the nearest boxcar. The soldiers jump from the rear of the truck, one of them carrying a large burlap sack. \nMED. SHOT \nas Scharff gets out of the car, from the boxcar comes the SOUND of children crying. \nSCHARFF (to Helmut in car) Wait here. \nScharff strides purposefully over to Sergeant Hoffman, the guard beside the open door.  Hoffman salutes Scharff. \nSCHARFF Any word about the train yet? \nHOFFMAN No, sir.  The last we heard -- it won't get here until evening. \nSCHARFF Anyone been around? \nHOFFMAN No, sir. \nSCHARFF With all that wailing, it's a wonder. Couldn't you keep them quiet? \nHOFFMAN I didn't know what to do, Lieutenant. I was afraid to close both doors. \nSCHARFF (to other soldiers) Keep a tight guard on the whole area. No one gets near here.  Understand? (to Hoffman) You post them. \nHOFFMAN (saluting) Yes, sir. \nHoffman moves over to soldiers and begins giving them their orders. \nSCHARFF (to soldier holding the sack) Leave that here. \nThe soldier puts down the sack, and hurries off after the others with Hoffman leading the way.  Scharff turns toward the staff car. \nSCHARFF (calling to Helmut) Over here, Clown. \nHelmut quickly gets out of the car and moves over to Scharff. He looks toward the partially open door. \nHELMUT They're crying. \nSCHARFF (indicating the sack) Take that in to them. \nHelmut picks up the sack and peers into it. \nHELMUT What is it? \nSCHARFF Bread.  They won't wait so loud with their mouths full. \nHELMUT (shocked) How... how long have they been here? \nSCHARFF You just get in there and keep them quiet.  You can do that, can't you? \nHelmut nods.  Scharff puts his hand on Helmut's shoulder. Helmut stiffens under his touch. \n", "test2_true": "HELMUT Yes, sir. \nHelmut moves over to the half open door of the boxcar, the CAMERA MOVING with him.  Just before he looks inside, he puts a wide grin on his face.  But when he does peer into the car, his eyes cease to smile. \nINT. BOXCAR - HELMUT'S POV - DAY \nIn one end of the car the children are huddled together in one frightened, wailing mass.  They do not even notice Helmut at first, so great is their sorrow.  The little ones cling to the larger youngsters, who, in turn, cling together.  The small ones weep hysterically , as children do when they have been crying for a very long time.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK so that Helmut is in f.g.   He slides the boxcar door open fully, throwing more light on the children.  This brings renewed walls of anguish from the youngsters, who cluster together more fiercely.  But one little boy sneaks a look at the door, expecting to see more guards.  When he sees Helmut, his tear- filled eyes widen.  He can scarcely believe what he sees, much less verbalize it.  He tugs frantically at an OLDER GIRL he has been clutching.  She looks first at him, then at Helmut.  She, too, can hardly believe it. \nOLDER GIRL (tentatively) Doork? (shrill with recognition) It's Doork.  It is!  It is! \nThe children begin untangling quickly.  Faces appear between legs, around skirts and over shoulders.  For a moment they can only stare at Helmut, speechless with wonder. \nHELMUT (gently) So this is where you've been hiding? \nThat breaks the silence, and the children begin squealing ad- libbed expressions of greeting and relief.  They repeat his name time and again:  \"Doork, Doork, Doork.\"  As one... the youngsters surge toward him.  The little boy who first saw him reaches him first.  He drops to his knees and puts his arms around Helmut's neck, hugging him furiously.  Helmut returns the embrace. \nBOY I want to go home.  Take me home. \nHELMUT Now, now, there's nothing to cry about.  We're going to have fun. (disengaging himself and picking up the sack) Here.  I brought you something. (he tosses it into the car) The children pounce on the sack and tug at it, unsure what it is except that it's a gift from Helmut. \nHELMUT Wait now.  Don't open it yet.  Wait'll I get in.  You help me. \nHe backs up a few steps, the CAMERA PULLING BACK with him. Then he runs toward the car and, with strength he really doesn't have, jumps up so that he gets his arms on the floor of the boxcar.  He heaves himself forward partially into it, and the children grab his clothes to help him inside.  A couple of the older boys seize the seat of his pants and finally pull him in. \nINT. RAILROAD CAR - DAY \nFAVORING Helmut as he rolls over and jumps up, waggling his head from side to side in the manner of a Jack-in-the-box. The children watch him big-eyed.  A few giggle. \nHELMUT Look, I'm a Jack-in-the-box. \nHe gestures around to indicate that he is, indeed, in a box. \nHELMUT We're all Jacks-in-the-box -- the same box. \nThe children laugh, and some begin imitating Helmut's head movements.  Others do the same, and still others, including the Czech youngsters, until all are waggling their heads at each other and loving it.  Then, out of sheer adoration, the youngest of the children close in on Helmut and hug him around his legs.  Slowly he stops waggling his head and stretches out his arms to embrace as many of them as he can -- almost as if trying to protect them.  Suddenly the gaiety dissolves, and the children go solemnly silent.  Helmut reacts. \nHELMUT Well... who's hungry. \nAlmost in unison, the children shout \"I am\", again forgetting their unhappiness. \nHELMUT All right, I want everybody to sit down.  When I count three, everybody sit.  Ready?   One, two... \nOn the count of two, many of the youngsters sit down.  Helmut feigns surprise. \nHELMUT Oh, you're too fast.  Three! \nThis brings a burst of giggles, and the remaining children, sit down... the Czechs following the example of the others. Helmut opens the burlap sack and begins handing out pieces of black bread.  The children grab at the chunks and gnaw it voraciously.  When all of the youngsters have been given the bread, Helmut takes a piece and bites into it with great relish.  After a few chews on the bread: \nHELMUT Now... what'll we do? \nThere is a long moment of silence, then the little blonde girl with the rag doll speaks up timidly. \nLITTLE GIRL I want to see my Mommy. \nHelmut is brought up short.  For a beat he searches his brain frantically for an answer.  Then he goes to the child and kneels beside her. \nHELMUT You would?  All right. \nLITTLE GIRL You know where she is? \nHELMUT She's right here with you. \nLITTLE GIRL I don't see her. \nHELMUT That's because you don't know how to look.  I'll show you.  Close your eyes. (to the other children) All of you... close your eyes. \nThe little girl closes her eyes and one by one the other youngsters do also.  The Czech children look at each other, then at the other children, then they too close their eyes. \nHELMUT Everybody's eyes shut?  Now, think about your mommys and Daddys... There, don't you see them?  Can't you see their faces? \nThe children, marvelling at this feat, ad lib expressions of assent. \nHELMUT So you see!  They're right here with you.  All you have to do is look in your hearts. \nLITTLE GIRL (putting her hand over her heart) Does Mommy see me, Doork? \nHELMUT (deeply touched) Yes, she does.  She has you safe in her heart, too. \nThe silence in the car tells Helmut that sadness has returned to the children.  He brightens quickly and rises. \nHELMUT I've got an idea.  You all know my name, but I don't know yours.  So let's find out everybody's name, shall we? \nHe points to a boy of about ten in the group. \nHELMUT You... come here and I'll show you what we'll do. \nThe boy, honored at being singled out, rises and comes to Helmut, who takes a stubby pencil from his pocket. \nHELMUT What's your name? \nBOY (timidly) Willie. \nHELMUT Willie.  That's a good name.  How do you spell it? \n", "test3_input": "Runkel smiles, moves away from Helmut. \nRUNKEL You misunderstand completely.  The Judas goat is never killed.  He isn't worth killing. (moves to cell door) I'm just asking you to lead them. \nANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT \nHis eyes plead, \"No.  I can't do it.  No.\" \nRUNKEL Not... even to save your own life? \nFor a brief moment, Helmut struggles to find the courage to stand up to Runkel -- but he has no courage and he sinks slowly to his knees, his head bowed. \nCLOSE SHOT - RUNKEL \nRUNKEL (victorious) I'm glad to see you're not a self- appointed martyr. \nTWO SHOT - HELMUT, RUNKEL \nRunkel towers above Helmut who sits back on his haunches, leaning against the wall. \nRUNKEL Just think!  Now you're really one of us. \nThe truth of Runkel's remark hits Helmut like a devastating blow.   He turns his face to the wall in shame.  Runkel walks to the door, raps on it, the guard outside swings it open. \nHELMUT (attempting to get to his feet) Sir... Sir... could I... could I have a little time with them before ... before... \nHis voice trails off.  Runkel looks at Helmut while he thinks it over.  He moves back to the middle of the cell. \nRUNKEL Yes.  Yes, of course. (he looks at his watch) I can give you about half an hour. (a little smile lights his face) You see, we're not heartless men here. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY \nANGLE to the door as Helmut and the Sergeant approach from o.s.  Helmut has freshened his make-up. \nSERGEANT Remember what I told you. \nHELMUT There won't be any trouble. \nHelmut goes to the door and starts to open it.  The CAMERA MOVES UP to -- \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nWith a great effort, he composes himself and throws open the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY \nANGLE to the door, where Helmut stands wearing an enormous grin.  The children are about the barren room in little groups.  When they see Helmut, they leap up and run to him, clinging to him as he closes the door behind him and moves into the room. \nCHILDREN Doork, Doork, you came back.  You came back.  We thought you'd left us.  Don't leave us, Doork. \nThe children continue to ad lib expressions of mingled fear and delight at his return.  Helmut goes among them, patting their heads comfortingly. \nHELMUT There.  There.  It's all right. It's all right.   Everything is going to be all right. \nWhen the youngsters are calmed, Helmut holds up his hands for silence. \nHELMUT Now I want everyone to put on a big smile and sit down, because we're going to have more fun than we've ever had. \nSlowly, still unconvinced that they have nothing to fear, the children sit on the floor. \nHELMUT Good.  We'll start by seeing that we all have our names on our heads. \nThe children begin to lower their heads so Helmut can check to see if their names are still there. \nHELMUT (as he moves among them) Yes, yes.  There's Fritz, Maria, Sadie, Inga, Josef, Nathan, Helga, Willie... \nThe little girl with the rag doll holds up the doll for Helmut to see. \nHELMUT Ah, yes, Frederika!  Good.  I see all of your names. \nThis is almost too much for Helmut, but he manages to control himself by turning away for a beat.  Then he turns back to the children, his big smile back in place. \nHELMUT Now... on with the show.  Just watch this. \nCUT TO: \nPAN SHOT - CHILDREN \nTheir little faces are troubled, worried. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPAN SHOT - CHILDREN \nIt is a half hour later, and now the children are laughing at something Helmut is doing o.s.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to -- \nMED. SHOT - THE GROUP \nHelmut is walking an imaginary tightrope.  Every few steps he almost loses his balance, but with comical gyrations he manages to complete the walk.  He bows deeply to the children -- and falls flat on his face.  The youngsters laugh, applaud and squeal delightedly. \nTWO SHOT - HELMUT, WILLIE \n", "test3_true": "WILLIE Doork!  Doork... you're great ! \nHelmut grabs Willie and holds him close while he fights back his tears.   Willie plants a big kiss on his cheek.  Helmut scrambles to his feet, the CAMERA PULLING BACK to -- \nWIDER ANGLE \nSHOOTING PAST Helmut to the door as it opens, revealing the Sergeant, his face expressionless.  Helmut reacts. \nSERGEANT (to Helmut) It's time. \nHELMUT Just a few more minutes? \nThe sergeant shakes his head. \nHELMUT I'll bring them. \nThe children are watching him, puzzled. \nCHILDREN What's the matter, Doork?  Where are we going?  You come with us this time.  Where're they taking us. \nHELMUT (trying to think what to say) They... they want us to move to another building... where we'll have more room... to play. (a beat) Tell you what.  Let's make it a big circus parade.  Everybody get in a line behind... \nHe picks up Willie and stands him near the door. \nHELMUT (continuing) ... behind Willie here. \nThe children scramble up and begin forming a line behind the very proud Willie.  Helmut looks around for the boy with the harmonica. \nHELMUT Now, where's our band?  The harmonica? \nHe sees the boy and goes to him.  Helmut pantomimes playing the harmonica and points to himself.  The boy smiles widely, fishes the harmonica out of his pocket and holds it up. \nHELMUT There we are?  Everybody ready? Here we go. \nHelmut takes his place at the head of the line, like the Pied Piper, leads the youngsters out the door, playing a crude sort of circus parade music.  The little children giggle excitedly as they troupe out.  The older ones seem less certain, but as long as Helmut is with them, they feel secure. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PRISON YARD - DAY \nAs the procession of youngsters emerges from the barracks with Helmut dancing along at its head.  The Sergeant and the other two Guards stand watching in disbelief as the line turns and moves along toward the first of the windowless buildings. \nMED. SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS \nThey look at each other incredulously.  What they are seeing surpasses their imagination. \nFULL SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN \nSHOOTING from a HIGH ANGLE as the procession moves toward the CAMERA.  Helmut looks back at his charges from time to time, smiling and waving and always puffing away on the harmonica.  The children smile back, some timidly and some a bit fearfully, but all smile. \nPAN SHOT - PARADE \nCAMERA PANS in on the children as they march behind Helmut. We see some of them strutting, their little arms swinging freely.  Some of the little ones have to skip to keep up with the others.  They are all smiling. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nWith each step, Helmut looks about, his eyes searching heaven, praying for the miracle that will save the children... the sudden blast of thunder, the striking down of the guards. \nCLOSE SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS \nAs they follow the parade warily, almost as if expecting a trick.  They wear scowls worn into their faces by long use. \nMED. SHOT - BUILDING - HELMUT'S POV \nIts steel door gapes open.  Through the open doorway we can see a bare room in which what appears to be shower heads jutting from the wall.  A single ceiling light gives the room a stark appearance.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK and UP as the procession comes up toward the building. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT \nDespair fills his eyes as he realizes that there is to be no miracle.  He looks ahead into the room, his courage fails him and he stops so abruptly that the children behind him run into his legs.  He turns and looks at them, then back to the door. \nWIDER ANGLE \nAlmost reluctantly, Helmut stands aside.  He tries to smile, but the result is almost grotesque.  He tries to speak, but no words come.  The Sergeant and the guard drift up toward him, scowling.  Gently, Helmut tousles the hair of little Willie and steers him through the door into the room.  The other children follow him hesitantly.  Helmut puts the harmonica to his lips and begins playing again. \nANOTHER ANGLE - TAKING IN SERGEANT AND GUARDS \nFIRST GUARD Their clothes!  They've got to undress. \nThe sergeant starts to move toward the line of children, the Sergeant grabs his arm and stops him. \nSERGEANT Leave them alone. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN \nSHOOTING over Helmut's shoulder down at the children as they file past him.  Each one hesitates a beat before him and looks up at him. \nTheir faces are wondering, but trusting.  They smile tentatively.  Only the little girl with the doll hangs back, waiting for something rather than fearful of entering.  When all of the other children have gone in, she goes up to Helmut and wordlessly holds out her hand in a silent request to enter with him.  In her eyes is the absolute certainty that he will. \nCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT - LITTLE GIRL'S POV \nHe looks down at her hand for a long beat. \nMED. SHOT - HELMUT, LITTLE GIRL \n"}

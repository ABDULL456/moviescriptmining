Bock turns and heads back for... 
EIGHTH FLOOR, WEST CORRIDOR 
...and down that through the kitchen workers and strolling patients to... 
ROOM 806 
...which he enters. He is startled to find Milton Mead and Hitchcock leaning over William Mead, who is up on one elbow and in a state. 
WILLIAM MEAD I'm telling you, Milton, he pulls out all the wires and the tubes, and he gets up and puts on a doctor's uniform, and he goes out, and he murders doctors! He just went out ten seconds before you came in! 
Indeed, there is no Drummond to be seen. His bed is empty. Bock nods to Milton Mead and Hitchcock, who nod back, and crosses quickly to look into the bathroom which is likewise empty. 
WILLIAM MEAD And I'll tell you something else about this crazy place you got here! There was a naked Indian in here last night doing a war dance! That's the kind of crazy place you're running here, Milton! You got to get me out of here, Milton. This is a crazy place, Milton! 
Milton Mead's pocket-beeper BEEPS. Milton Mead reaches for the phone. 
WILLIAM MEAD (appealing to Bock) I wake up last night, there's a goddam Indian in here, a naked Indian! What kind of hospital is this? 
MILTON MEAD (on phone) This is Mr. Mead, are you paging me? 
WILLIAM MEAD A couple of hours later I wake up again, and the guy in that bed there is getting out of the bed... 
MILTON MEAD (to Hitchcock) Are the police still in the building? 
HITCHCOCK Yes. 
MILTON MEAD You'd better get them up here. Yes. 
WILLIAM MEAD All day long, he lays there like a dead man. All of a sudden, in the middle of the night, he gets out of bed! I thought I was going crazy! 
MILTON MEAD (on phone) Yes, this is Mead... Oh, dear. When?... 
WILLIAM MEAD You know what he says to me? He says, you're hallucinating. Listen, I just saw a naked Indian. Now, I'm seeing a ghost. I got to figure he's right, I'm hallucinating, right? 
MILTON MEAD I'll be down directly. (hangs up) Never rains but it pours. A fire just broke out in one of those condemned buildings. The squatters in the building came out. The police tried to arrest them and, apparently, the situation has erupted into a riot. (to Bock as he heads for the door) I'm sure you're wondering what this is all about, Herb. 
WILLIAM MEAD You're not going to leave me alone in this crazy place, Milton! 
MILTON MEAD (at the door with Bock) Mr. Hitchcock is staying with you. (to Hitchcock) You better call the cops, Tom. 
WILLIAM MEAD Milton! Milton! Milton!!! 
The door slams. 
WEST CORRIDOR AND NURSES' STATION 
Bock and Milton Mead stride up the corridor through the linen wagons and kitchen carts. 
MILTON MEAD I haven't the time now, and I'm not even going to try to tell you this curious story my brother just told me. I'll fill you in on it at lunch some time. 
He waves his hand helplessly to indicate the utter incredulity of it all. 
MILTON MEAD (rushes not to miss the elevator) Hold it! 
They reach an open elevator. Mead goes in, the doors close. The doors of a second elevator then open, and Barbara comes out. She and Bock stare at each other. In background, Welbeck is on the phone at the Nurses' Station. 
BARBARA The ambulance is here. 
BOCK Yeah, but your father isn't. He's disappeared. He put on Schaefer's uniform and has gone out to do God's work, presumably the murder of Dr. Welbeck. Except, that fellow on the phone over there is Dr. Welbeck.

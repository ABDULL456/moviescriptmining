JEWISH PHYSICIAN Look...I'm sorry...calling for help in the middle of an operation...but I just lost my nerve...I panicked...again. 
Buckaroo picking a NIKON up off a table, snapping some pictures of his handiwork... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI You've got the God-given tools to be a success in any field of endeavor, Dr. Zwibel.  Ever thought about joining me full-time?

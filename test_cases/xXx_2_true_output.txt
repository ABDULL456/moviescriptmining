Another TEAM of BLACK OPS SOLDIERS bursts from the weeds, the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape. 
They fall on him like a curtain. 
XANDER'S P.O.V. - Soldiers hold him down while a BLACK HOOD is pulled over his head. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - DAY 
As the MASSIVE HANGER DOORS CLOSE we can see CHOPPERS taking off and landing. MEXICAN SOLDIERS load Jefe and his Narcos onto a FEDERALE BUS. Virg resists and is BEATEN. T.J. can be seen being loaded into an AMBULANCE. 
The hanger doors slide shut with a THUD. 
We see Xander's HANDS as the CHAINS are cut away. 
Xander sits in a chair with the BLACK HOOD still over his head. He blinks when the hood is torn off. A Black Ops Soldier smirks as he walks away. 
Xander looks around, sees the Black Ops Team unpacking some STRANGE GEAR. Two of them are dumping bottles of a CLEAR LIQUID into a RUSTY CLAWFOOT BATHTUB. 
XANDER Nice of you to draw me a bath. Is it Saturday already? 
The Black Ops guys grin knowingly. 
On the other side, Xander sees a FLIGHT CREW readying a GULFSTREAM for travel. Gibbons steps up from behind him. 
GIBBONS Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class. 
XANDER You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there. 
GIBBONS Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me. 
Xander gets up and Gibbons leads him on a stroll around the 
GIBBONS You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution. 
XANDER You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy. 
GIBBONS You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help. 
XANDER I'm not interested. I've already got a job. 
GIBBONS You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger. 
XANDER I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead. 
GIBBONS That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge. 
As they walk by the Black Ops guys, Xander sees they're getting busy. One spreads out a plastic DROPCLOTH. Another plugs in a BONE SAW. 
XANDER What's this? You're gonna try to scare me now? 
Gibbons grabs a CHICKEN LEG from a guy eating lunch. 
GIBBONS Do you know the reason why I try to recruit guys like you? There's no risk. 
He tosses it into the tub. Instantly it starts to SIZZLE and BUBBLE. The tub is full of ACID. 
GIBBONS There's nobody back home who's gonna ask questions if you just... disappear for a while. 
In seconds the entire leg has been consumed, leaving only a oily cloud of residue. 
Gibbons eyes him coldly, nailing the point home. 
XANDER Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for? 
GIBBONS There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people. 
XANDER What do I get out of it? 
GIBBONS If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath. 
XANDER You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along. 
Gibbons kicks the back of Xander's leg and dumps him on his ass. Gibbons was so quick, Xander never saw it coming. 
The Black Ops guys clap and cheer, always interested in a fight. 
XANDER Not bad for a gimp. 
GIBBONS What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head. 
Xander gets up. 
XANDER I'll take that under advisement. Maybe I can be like you and lose a leg for the old Stars and Bars. I bet the flag's a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs.

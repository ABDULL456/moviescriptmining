Twenty 10th grade boys are sitting in desks in geometry class. They are dressed in school uniform, light blue shirts and khakis. The boys look dazed and sleepy. \nThe teacher, MR. ADAMS, is at the front of the room, finishing a complicated equation on the chalkboard. \nMR. ADAMS \nExcept when the value of the x coordinate is less than or equal to the value of the -- Yes, Isaac? \nA boy named ISAAC has raised his hand \nISAAC \nWhat about that problem? \nIsaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge numbers and strange symbols filling up a forgotten corner of the chalkboard. The heading above it says Extra Credit. \nMR. ADAMS \nOh, I really just put that up there as a joke. That's probably the hardest geometry problem in the world. \nISAAC \nHow much extra credit is it worth? \nMR. ADAMS \nWell, I've never seen anyone get it right before, including my mentor, Dr. Leaky at MIT. So I guess if anyone here can do it, \n(pause) \nI'd see to it that none of you ever have to open another math book again for the rest of your lives. \nThere is some quite murmuring. The name Fischer is repeated over and over. The boys begin to look to a student in the back row. \nUnlike his classmates, he wears the Rushmore school blazer with insignia on the breast pocket and a Rushmore rep tie knotted tightly. His hair is smartly parted and swept back. He is extremely skinny and pale. He is MAX FISCHER. \nMax has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the Wall Street Journal. \nMR. ADAMS \nMax ? You want to try it ? \nMax looks up. \nMAX \nI'm sorry. Did someone say my name? \nEveryone laughs. Max smiles slightly. He buttons his blazer and straightens his tie. He picks up his cup of coffee and takes a sip. He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work. \nThe boys watch with nervous anticipation. Mr. Adams compares Max's progress with e notes in his book. Max's equations quickly fills up most of the chalkboard. He finishes it with a flourish, throws his piece of chalk in the trash, and turns to face the \nclass. \nEveryone looks to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams raises an eyebrow. He nods. \nThe classroom erupts into wild, ecstatic applause. Everyone surrounds Max, cheering, as he walks calmly back to his desk. They hoist him into the air. \nCUT TO: \nMax with his eyes closed, smiling serenely, listening to the applause. He mutters: \nMAX \nGentlemen, gentlemen, please. \nA little hand grabs Max's arm and shakes him. Max opens his eyes. The person shaking him is his chapel partner, DIRK CALLOWAY, a fourth grader with neatly white hair. Max looks around. \nThey are in chapel, surrounded by rows of boys in school uniforms. Dirk puts his finger to his lips. \nDIRK \nShh. \nMax rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew. The applause dies down and Max looks to the pulpit as the guest chapel speaker, HERMAN BLUME, steps up to the microphone. \nMr. Blume is a tough looking guy about fifty years old in a black suit. He begins his chapel speech. \nMR. BLUME \nYou guys have it real easy. I never had it like this where I grew up. But I send my kids here. Because, the fact is, whether you deserve it or not: you go to one of the best schools in the country. \nMax's eyes light's up. \nMR. BLUME \nRushmore. You lucked out. \nMax leans forward to the railing and begins to listen intently. \nMR. BLUME \nNow, for some of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich, and you're going to stay rich. But here's my advice to the rest of you: take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs. And take them down. \nSome of the students and faculty begin to look at each other with puzzled expressions. Max is nodding and taking notes on the flypage of a hymnal. \nINSERT HYMNAL: \nRushmore -- best school in country. \nrich kids -- bad? \nMR. BLUME \nJust remember: they can buy anything. But they can't buy backbone. Don't let them forget that. Thank you. \nMr. Blume leaves the podium. Max leaps to his feet and leads the applause. The organ starts and everyone stands up. \nEXT. QUADRANGLE DAY \nMr. Blume and the headmaster, DR. GUGGENHEIM, come out of the chapel among the throng of students. \nDr. Guggenheim wears a wool coat and smokes a pipe. He is very dashing with silver hair and a warmly patronizing manner. He walks with his hands clasped behind his back. \nTwo Jack Russell terriers follow quickly at his heels. \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \nAre you free for graduation, Herman? Maybe you could give us an encore. (whistles to the dogs) Nicholas! Copernicus! \nMR. BLUME \n(lighting a cigarette) \nI don't give a shit. I paid for the whole damn natatorium. The least these little pricks can do is hear me out. \nMAX \nMr. Blume. \nMax has appeared beside them. Dirk tags along behind him. \nMAX \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \nYou're not dyslexic. \nMAX \nWell, I'm a terrible speller. \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \nJust bring up the grades. \nMax sighs. He looks out the window and says quietly: \nMAX \nDo you remember how I got into this school? \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \nYeah, I do. You wrote a play. \nMAX \nThat's right. A little one act. And my mother read it and felt I should go to Rushmore. And you read it, and you gave me a scholarship, didn't you ? \nDr. Guggenheim nods. \nMAX \nDo you regret it? \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \nNo, I don't regret it. But I still might have to expel you. \nMax nods. He smiles sadly and whispers: \nMAX \nCouldn't we just let me float by? For old times' sake? \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \n(grimly) \nCan't do it, Max. \nEXT. QUADRANGLE. DAY \nMax and Dirk come out the door into the cold. They head across the grass. \nMAX \nThey want to kick me out, Dirk. \nDIRK \n(concerned) \nOh, no. Not again. What are you going to do? \nMAX \nThe only thing I can do. Try and pull some strings with the administration, I guess. \nDIRK \n(pause) \nMaybe you ought to get a tutor. \nMAX \nI don't have time for a goddamn tutor. You know my schedule. \nINSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY: \nBACKGAMMON CLUB. \nFounder: Max Fischer. \nINT. LIBRARY DAY \nA long table in the Rushmore library. Max is reading a library copy of a book about Jacques Cousteau. He is also playing backgammon with a freshman named ALEX. \nALEX \nDid you hear they're teaching Japanese next year? \nMAX \nThat's the rumor. \nALEX \nAnd they're canceling Latin. \nMAX \nWhat? I tried to get Latin canceled for five years. \"It's a dead language,\" I'd always say. \nALEX \nWell, I guess they finally heard you. \nMax shakes his head as this sinks in. \nMAX \nAt least I saved Dirk from the horror. \nMax turns the page of his book. There is a little note written in the margin in pencil with an arrow pointing to the text. Max frowns. He turns the book sideways to read it. \nINSERT FRAGMENT OF NOTE IN BOOK: \nwhich reminds me of a quote from Henry James: Try to be one of the people whom nothing is lost. \nMax's frown disappears. A change comes over his face. His eyes glaze over dreamily. He looks to Alex. \nMAX \nWho's Henry James? \nALEX \nI don't know. \nMax looks back at the book. He studies the quote. He gets up and goes to the check-out counter. He shows the book to the LIBRARIAN. \nMAX \nWhat does this mean? \nThe librarian reads the Henry James quote. \nLIBRARIAN \nIt means try to be worldly. \nMAX \nYou mean like smart. \nMAX \nMr. Blume! \nMax goes over to Mr. Blume's car. \nMAX \nIt's Max Fischer. \nMR. BLUME \n(weary) \nHi, Max. \nThey shake hands through the open car window. \nMAX \nHow's the concrete business? \nMR. BLUME \nOh, I don't know. By the time you hit 45 you're been fucked over so many times you don't really care anymore. \nMAX \nI'm sorry to hear that. \nMr. Blume sighs deeply. He stares out the windshield. \nMR. BLUME \nWhat's the secret, Max? \nMAX \nThe secret? \nMR. BLUME \nYeah. You look like you've got it all figured out. \nMAX \n(pause) \nI don't know. I think you just gotta find something you love to do, then do it for the rest of your life. \n(shrugs) \nFor me, it's going to Rushmore. \nMax looks very serious. Mr. Blume smiles and nods. \nMAX \nHey, Ronny. Hey, Donny. \nMr. Blume's red-headed twins RONNY and DONNY come over to the car. They're Max's age but much more thick and solid. \nRONNY \nShotgun. \nDonny gets in the front seat anyway. Ronny hollers: \nRONNY \nI said shotgun, Donny! \nMR. BLUME \nGet in the back, Ronny. \nRONNY \nI said, \"Shotgun.\" Get in the back, Donny. \nDonny punches three different buttons on the dash that crank up the AC full blast. Mr. Blume's hair dances in the cold burst of air. He shuts off the AC. \nMAX \nSee you tomorrow, Mr. Blume. \n(looks off) \nMrs. Reynolds! \nMax goes over to shake hands with somebody else's parents. Mr. Blume looks at Max fondly. \nMR. BLUME \nDid you invite that kid to your party? \nDONNY \n(shocked) \nMax Fischer? \nRONNY \nCome on, Dad. There's gonna be girls there. \nDONNY \nI'd rather die. Pull your head out of your ass. \nMr. Blume turns Donny quickly like he is going to attack him. Donny cowers grinning in the backseat with his fists up. Ronny pipes in: \nRONNY \nRemember what Mom said. Hugs not hits. \nINT. AUDITORIUM. DAY \nThe school auditorium. The stage is bare except for two folding chairs. A tall senior plays FRANK. He is wearing a stocking cap and sunglasses. A fat kid plays WILLIE. \nFRANK \nWait a second. What time did the old lady place the 911 call? \nWILLIE \nTen-fifteen. \nFRANK \n(snaps his fingers) \nThat's it. \nFrank jumps out of his seat. \nFRANK \nMeet me on the corner in ten minutes. \nWILLIE \nWhere are you going? \nMAX \nYou think I'm spending too much of my time starting up clubs and putting on plays? \nMR. FISCHER \nI don't know. It's possible. \nMAX \nI should probably be trying harder to score chicks. That's the only thing anybody really cares about. (sighs deeply) But it's not my forte, unfortunately. \nMR. FISCHER \nIt'll happen, Max. It's just. You're like one of those clipper ship captains. You're married to the sea. \nMAX \nYes, that's true. \n(pause) \nBut I've been out to sea for a long time. \nEXT. SOCCER FIELD. DAY \nMiss Cross is sitting on the bleachers watching her class play Capture-the-Flag. She opens a book. It is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and searches in her pocket for a lighter. \nA lit match appears in front of her. Max is holding it. He is wearing a maroon beret, Miss Cross looks at him curiously. \nMAX \nHello. \nMISS CROSS \nHi. \nMiss Cross lights her cigarette on Max's match. \nMISS CROSS \nI like your hat. \nMAX \nThank you. You're a teacher here, aren't you? \nMISS CROSS \nUh-huh. \nMAX \nWhat subject do you teach? \nMISS CROSS \nWell, I teach first grade, so I do all the subjects. Except music. \nMAX \nAnd this is your first year at Rushmore, I take it. \nMiss Cross nods. \nMAX \nI see. How long have you been a smoker, if you don't mind me asking? \nMISS CROSS \n(surprised) \nHm. Let's see. How old are you? \nMAX \nFifteen. \nMISS CROSS \nSince I was your age. \nMAX \n(shocked) \nYou're kidding. \nMiss Cross shakes her head. Max can't believe this. \nMAX \nYou should quit. \nMISS CROSS \nYou're right. \nMAX \n(going back to his book) \nAnd I should mind my own business. \nMiss Cross laughs. Max looks back up. \nMAX \nWhere'd you go to school, by the way? \nMISS CROSS \nHarvard. \nMAX \nReally? That's a coincidence. My top schools where I want to apply to are Oxford and The Sorbonne. But my safety is Harvard. \nMISS CROSS \n(smiles) \nThat's very ambitious. \nMAX \nThank you. \nMISS CROSS \nWhat are you going to major in? \nMAX \nWell. I haven't decided for sure. But probably a double major in Mathematics and Pre-Med. What was your major? \nMISS CROSS \nLatin-American studies. \nMAX \nI like them. \nMR. BLUME \n(surprised) \nReally? \nMAX \nSure. \nRonny flips his opponent on the mat and flattens him with his body. Donny screams encouragement. \nMR. BLUME \nNo. You're right. They're good kids. \nMax nods solemnly. \nWRESTLER \nSee you Sunday, Mr. Blume. \nA stocky Wrestler with an ice pack on his arm walks by on his way to the showers. Mr. Blume nods to him without looking up. \nMAX \nWhat's Sunday? \nMr. Blume looks to Max. Silence. \nMR. BLUME \nThe twins are having a birthday party. And I'd love it if - \nMAX \nOh, that's right. Yeah. I'm not going to be able to make it to that one. \nMax smiles very sincerely. Silence. \nMR. BLUME \nCome work for me. \nMAX \n(stiffens) \nWhat do you mean? \nMR. BLUME \nI mean, I could use somebody like you. I could - \nMAX \nI may not be rich, Mr. Blume. And my father may only be a doctor. But we manage. \nMR. BLUME \n(hesitates) \nI didn't mean it like that. I just - \nMAX \nNo, thank you. I mean, I appreciate the offer. But I've got everything I need right here at Rushmore. Besides, it wouldn't be fair. \nREFEREE \n110s! \nMAX \nExcuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking with you. \nMax pulls off his blazer. He is wearing wrestling tights underneath. Mr. Blume looks surprised. \nMR. BLUME \nYou're on the team? \nMAX \n(shrugs) \nI'm an alternate. \nMax heads out to the mat, pulling on his headgear. Mr. Blume calls after him: \nMR. BLUME \nWhat wouldn't be fair, Max? \nMAX \n(smiles crookedly) \nWe'd make way too much money working on the same team. \nMr. Blume smiles faintly. He watches as Max begins his match. Max is outclassed and quickly gets pinned. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nMiss Cross is shepherding her class into her classroom. They are singing a song as they walk down the corridor. Across the hall, a fourth-grade teacher, Mrs. Guggenheim, comes out of her classroom. She is a handsome woman in her late sixties with black and silver hair. \nMISS CROSS \nHello, Mrs. Guggenheim. \nMRS GUGGENHEIM \nHi, Rosemary. Did you find a place? \nMISS CROSS \nWell, I'm just staying over at Edward's parents' house for now. They're out of town. \nMRS GUGGENEHIM \nOh. That's good. \n(pause) \nEdward was one of my students, you know. \nMiss Cross smiles and nods. Silence. Miss Cross points to a photograph in a collage on a wall. \nMISS CROSS \nI think I met that boy yesterday. \nMrs. Guggenheim looks at the picture. \nINSERT PHOTOGRAPH: \nIt is black and white of Max in fifth grade singing a show tune. His arms are opened wide and he has a top hat in one hand and cane in the other. \nMRS GUGGENHEIM \n(frowns) \nHow did you decide to teach at Rushmore? \nMISS CROSS \nMy husband went here. \nMax drops the can of fish food into the tank. He quickly fishes it out. \nHe picks some little bits of fish food out of the water and throws them away. Pause. \nMAX \nI didn't know you were married. \nMISS CROSS \nWell, he's dead now. So I'm not actually married. \nMAX \nWhen did he die? \nMISS CROSS \nLast year. \nMax nods. Silence. \nMAX \nMy mother's dead. \nMISS CROSS \nOh. I'm sorry to hear that. \nMAX \nShe died when I was seven. (raising an eyebrow) \nSo we both have dead people in our families. \nThey look at each other for a minute. \nMAX \nNow what's going on in here? \nMax kneels down and looks into one of the fish tanks. There are a hundred little seahorses swimming around in it. \nMISS CROSS \nThose were just born. \nA look of wonder comes across Max's face. He stares into the blue water. \nMAX \nYou really love fish, don't you? \nMiss Cross nods. Max puts his fingers to the glass. \nMAX \nHow much do these cost? \nINT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE - DAY \nMr. Blume's office. HE is talking on the telephone. Max sits in a chair across from him. \nMR. BLUME \nI don't want any alloys. I want steel. \n(pause) \nI don't give a rat's ass if he did. (pause) Steel, Harry. \nHe hangs up. \nMR. BLUME \nYou change your mind? You want the job? \nMAX \nNo. But I've got an idea. And need some money. \nMr. Blume's secretary buzzes him on the speakerphone. \nSECRETARY \nMr. Blume, they're ready for you in Hydraulics. \nMR. BLUME \nCome with me. Let's hear your idea. \nINT. FACTORY - DAY \nMax, Mr. Blume, and a big foreman named Ernie race across the factory in a souped-up golf cart. They're squeezed together with Max in the middle. \nMAX \nRushmore deserves an aquarium. A first class aquarium where scientists can lecture, and students can study marine life in their natural - \nMR. BLUME \nI don't know. What do you think, Ernie? \nERNIE \n(skeptical) \nAn aquarium? \nMAX \nA huge aquarium. An entire building. \nMR. BLUME \nWhat kind of fish? \nINT. FACTORY - DAY \nMr. Blume and Max, wearing hard hats, stand on a scaffolding overlooking a huge cat of bubbling concrete. \nMAX \n(shouting) \nElectric eels. Barracudas. Stingrays. Hammerheads. Piranhas. \nMR. BLUME \nPiranhas? \nMAX \nThat's right. Piranhas. I talked to a man in South America. \nMR. BLUME \nMISS CROSS \nYes. And that's all we're going to be. \nMAX \nThat's what I meant by relationship. You want me to grab a dictionary? \nMISS CROSS \nI just want to make sure we understand each other. \nMAX \nI understand. You're not attracted to me. C'est la vie. I'm a big boy. \nMISS CROSS \nMax. You're fifteen. Attraction doesn't enter into it. \nMAX \nIf you say so. All I'm getting at is I've never met anyone like you. Take that for whatever it's worth. \nShe thinks about this for a minute. \nMISS CROSS \nI think I can safely say I've never met anyone like you, either. \nMAX \nYou haven't, have you? \nMiss Cross shakes her head. Max says quietly: \nMAX \nYou want to shake hands? \nShe puts out her hand and they shake hands across the desk. But they don't let go. They just look at each other. \nMAX \nI'm glad we had this conversation. \nMISS CROSS \nMe too. \nThey finally let go of each other's hands. Miss Cross looks away. She's not exactly sure what they just decided. \nMAX \nBy the way. Are you free? Thursday night? \nMISS CROSS \nFree for what? \nMAX \nDinner. \nShe looks at Max strangely. \nMAX \nWe're getting a group together after the play. \nINSERT PLAYBILL: \nSERPICO \nA new play by Max Fischer. \nINT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \nA very realistic set for a New York tenement apartment. \nFour men sit at a table. Three wear dark suits: O'Reilly, Burnum and Fields. One has long hair, a beard, leather pants and a big silver crucifix around his neck. This is Frank Serpico. They are all played by high schoolers. \nFRANK \nI can't wear a wire! They're feeling me up every day! \nO'REILLY \nCome on, Frank. You'll have complete protection. \nFRANK \n(walking off) \nI've heard that one before. I got to go put a dime in the meter. \nBURNUM \nLook, Officer Serpico. If you agree to testify in open court - \nFrank wheels around and knocks the clipboard out of O'Reilly's hands. He grabs O'Reilly by both arms. Fields instinctively draws his firearm. \nFRANK \nPromise me one thing, O'Reilly. You're going to follow this all the way. To the end (snaps) Of the line, (snaps) where I got to be. \nO'REILLY \n(looking Frank right in the eye) \nSo help me, God. \nThe audience is deeply engrossed. A row of small kids are sitting on the floor very front. \nMax watches from the wings. He looks out at the audience. \nHe sees Mr. Blume smiling proudly in the third row. \nHe sees Miss Cross sitting next to a big, curly-haired Medical Student in surgical scrubs. She leans close to him and whispers something in his ear. He smiles and nods and whispers something back. \nMax stares at them blankly as a shoot-out erupts onstage. \nINT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nFrank comes offstage with a bandage of his cheek and a cane in his hand. Max is waiting for him backstage. Max has on a headset and carries a clipboard. He is extremely keyed-up. \nMAX \nWhat happened to the cannoli line? \nMax follows Frank as Frank walks quietly toward the dressing room. \nMAX \nYou're supposed to say, \"Forget about it, Sanchez -\" \nFRANK \n(very angry) \nI made a mistake, all right? It doesn't make any difference, anyway. \nMAX \nTerrible. Tell me something. When you talk to Miss Cross the other \nday, did you get the feeling- \nThe hall monitor Mr. Holstead comes down the hall toward Max. He is a big, sturdy man about fifty years old. He wears a striped tie and his sleeves rolled up. \nMR HOLSTEAD \n(loudly) \nDo you have a telephone pass? \nMax holds up his hand for Mr. Holstead to wait a minute. He covers his ear so he can hear Mr. Blume. \nMr. Blume is looking in the windows of different classrooms. Kids look out at him curiously. \nMR. BLUME \nI got to tell you, Max. I don't know what you see in her. I don't think she's right for you. \nMAX \nWhat's that supposed to mean? \nMr. Blume sees Miss Cross inside teaching her class. He stares at her in a glance. He whispers: \nMR. BLUME \nWell, she's not that beautiful. She's not that interesting. I mean, sure, there's something about her. But I see you with someone- \nMAX \nLook, Mr. Blume. Your comments are valuable, but let's get to the point. Will she see me again? Yes or no? \nMR. BLUME \n(pause) \nNo. \nMAX \nI'm going to go see her. Hang on. \nMax looks to Mr. Holstead. \nMAX \nI'm talking on the telephone. \nMr. Holstead reaches over and hangs up the phone. \nMAX \nCome on, man. That's rude. \nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nMrs. Whitney watches from her classroom window at: \nMax opens a red metal door on to the empty concrete courtyard. He looks left and right. He sneaks across the courtyard to the bike racks, quickly unlocks his bike, and rides away. \nEXT. RUSHMORE - DAY \nMax rides full speed through the gates on to the Rushmore campus. He flips one leg off his bike and glides in toward the bike racks standing on one pedal. \nMax locks up his bike and walks across the lawn. \nMAGNUS \nYou better beat it, laddie. \nMax looks up at Magnus Buchan sitting in a tree smoking a cigarette, hacking at a branch with a pocketknife. \nMAX \nI hope you fall out of that tree and get stick in the ass, Buchan. \nMAGNUS \nYou know, I've watched you, Fischer. Showboat, always talking, picking a kid like Dirk cause his mother's a great piece and then getting nowhere. Like everything you do. Big show. No results. \nMAX \nAnd what do you call getting a hand job from Mrs. Calloway in her Jaguar? \nMAGNUS \nA bloody lie. \nMAX \nYou think I got kicked out for just the aquarium? Nah. That ain't it. It was the hand job. And I'll tell you another thing. It was worth it. So eat your heard out, mick. I got business to attend to. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nMiss Cross comes out the door of the lower school with a basket of books and papers. She stops in front of her wagon and digs in her bag for the keys. \nMAX \nOr do you want me to go? \nMISS CROSS \n(looks around, sighs) \nYou can talk to me. \nMiss Cross goes over to him. She stops a few feet away and they stand there in silence. \nMAX \nI'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner. \nMISS CROSS \nThat's OK. \nMAX \nNo, it's not. And please apologize to what's his name for me. \nMISS CROSS \nI will. Are you OK? \nMAX \nI'm fine. But I miss Rushmore. I miss the seasons. And watching the leaves change. \nMISS CROSS \nBut it's only three blocks away. \nMAX \nI know. I miss seeing you. \nMISS CROSS \n(pause) \nI miss you, too. \nYou'd take time out of your business to do that? \nMR. BLUME \nBusiness schmizness. \nOCTOBER MONTAGE: \nMax and Miss Cross ride in the backseat of a van full of first graders. Max is telling a story and everyone is laughing. Mr. Blume is up front quietly driving the van. One of the first graders sits in the passenger seat staring at him. They go through the front gates of the zoo. \nMiss Cross stands at the front of her classroom drawing a complicated geometric proof on the chalkboard. Max sits alone across from her nodding earnestly and taking notes. \nMax and Miss Cross play doubles against Mr. Blume and Dirk on the court in the Blume's backyard. Max coaches Miss Cross on her backhand. Mr. Blume watches her from across the net. Mrs. Blume watches all of them from an upstairs window. \nThe Grover Cleveland Science Fair. Max sits proudly in front of his project. It is a paper mache tidal wave looming over a little coastal village with screaming peasants. \nMargaret Yang is across the aisle being photographed with a trophy for Best of Show. Her project is called Light, Color, Sound and Magnetism. She is staring at Max, but he doesn't notice her. \nMrs. Whitney hands Max a geometry test. It has a C+ on it. Max looks quickly to Mrs. Whitney, surprised. She smiles and shakes his hand. \nA huge banner for the Grover Cleveland Owls is stretched across the endzone of the football field. Max, dressed in a shiny blue and grey jumpsuit, bursts through the banner and onto the field doing cartwheels and flips. The football teams scrambles out behind him. \nMax points out to different parts of the crows and yells football cheers. Dirk is sitting in between Mr. Blume and Miss Cross in the stands. Mr. Blume stares at Miss Cross. Miss Cross looks back and Mr. Blume and smiles. Dirk says significantly: \nDIRK \nWhere's Mrs. Blume tonight, Mr. Blume? \nAnd your sons Ronny and Donny? \nMR. BLUME \nI haven't the slightest idea, Dirk. \nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. DAY \nMax burst through a doorway followed by a little ENTOURAGE of underclassmen that includes a sophomore named WOODY. Woody has long hair and a Led-Zepplin shirt. He is carrying a clipboard. \nThey go down the hallway and quickly pass Margaret Yang. She is very nicely dressed in a grey turtleneck. \nMARGARET \nHi, Max. \nMAX \nHi. \nMax keeps walking. \nHe stops. He turns back to Margaret Yang. He looks her up and down. She is slightly uneasy. Max looks to Woody. Woody shrugs. Max looks back to Margaret. \nMAX \nWhat was your name again? \nMARGARET \nMargaret Yang. \nMAX \nAre you free seventh period? \nMARGARET \nWell, I'm supposed to have guitar lessons. \nMAX \n(pause) \nClassical? \nMARGARET \nRock. \nMAX \nYou can get out of it. \n(to Woody) \nput Margaret down for 3:30 in the auditorium, Woody. \nMax turns away and walks briskly down the hall with his entourage. He calls back to Margaret: \nMAX \nAnd bring a headshot. \nEXT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. DAY \nA nice two story house with a wide lawn and lots of trees. Mr. Blume knocks on the front door and waits nervously. He looks around the yard with his hands in his pockets. \nThe door opens. Miss Cross is holding a plate of sliced carrots. She looks at Mr. Blume curiously and smiles. \nMISS CROSS \nHi, Herman. \nMR. BLUME \nHow are you, Rosemary? \nMISS CROSS \nFine, thanks. I just got home and I'm having a little snack. \nMR. BLUME \nHaving some carrots. \nMiss Cross nods. Mr. Blume looks up at the house. \nMR. BLUME \nNice house. \nMISS CROSS \nYeah, This isn't mine. I'm' just kind of housesitting. \n(pause) \nWere you in the neighborhood? \nMr. Blume nods. There is an awkward silence. \nMR. BLUME \nDidn't Max have anything planned for us today? A trip to the museum or something? \nMISS CROSS \nDid he? I thought he was rehearsing this evening. \nMR. BLUME \nOh. That's right. His new play. He's going to be in this one, isn't he? \nMiss Cross nods. Mr. Blume shakes his head. \nDIRK \nWho sold you that crock? \nMAGNUS \nHe told me himself. He says she gave him a hand job in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar. \nDIRK \nMax would never say that. \nMAGNUS \n(smiles) \nYeah. You're probably right. After all, the son of a brain doctor doesn't need to impress anybody. \nBuchan laughs wickedly and fires off another throwing star. \nINT. GROVE CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. NIGHT \nThe school auditorium . Max is onstage dressed as a South Central lowrider called Little Juan. He is opposite a senior named 40 OUNCE and Margaret Yang, who plays Blue Eyes. While they are rehearsing the scene a MESSENGER comes in with an envelope for Max. \nLITTLE JUAN \nThe killing has got to stop, esse. It's getting too loco. No more gats. \n40 OUNCE \nNigger, you're the crazy one. Motherfuckers be wanting to kill you. Are you talking about getting rid of your gun? \nLITTLE JUAN \nIt's time, homey. \nBLUE EYES \nKiss me, Little Juan. \nMAX \n(suddenly out of character) \nThen he kisses her and we're out. OK. \n(pointing to the messenger) \nIs that for me? \nThe messenger gives Max the envelope. Max opens it. \nINSERT LETTER: \nWritten neatly in blue crayon on paper torn from a spiral notebook. Dirk reads in VOICEOVER dripping with sarcasm. \nDear Max, \nI'm sorry to say that I have secretly found out that Mr. Blume is having an affair with Miss Cross. My first suspicions came when I saw them frenching at the museum, and then I knew for sure when they went skinny dipping in Mr. Blume's swimming pool, giving each other hand jobs while you were taking a nap on the front porch. Why am I telling you this now? Because you're such a good friend. Take care, pal. \nFondly, \nDirk Calloway \nEXT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. NIGHT \nMr. Blume puts on his jacket as he walks down the front path from Miss Cross' house. He gets in his Bentley and starts the engine. He looks in the rearview mirror and sees the glowing red tip of a cigarette. He wheels around fast. \nMax is sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette. \nBLUME \nMax! \nMAX \nHow was she, Herman? \nBLUME \nJesus Christ! \nMAX \nWas she good? I bet she was. Although I wouldn't know cause I never screwed her. \nBlume flicks on the lights. Max has tears all over his face. \nMAX \n(with bitter contempt) \nGoing skinny-dipping while I took a nap. Are you comfortable, Max? I'll just be out nude getting hand jobs from the woman you love. \nMR. BLUME \n(frowns) \nWe never went skipping dipping. \nMAX \nSure, you didn't. And next you're going to tell me you didn't just walk out of her house at two o'clock in the morning. \nMR. BLUME \n(pause) \nI'm in love with her. \nMAX \nWell, I was in love with her first. And all that crap about, I don't think she's that great, I don't think she's right for you, Max. That was all bullshit, wasn't it? \nSilence. \nMAX \nDo you think she's in love with you? \nMR. BLUME \nI don't know. \nMAX \nWell, I guarantee you she's not. \nAnd she never will be. \nMR. BLUME \nLook, Max - \nMAX \nI saved Latin! \nMax glares at Mr. Blume. He shakes his head. \nMAX \nWhat'd you ever do? \nYou need any help? \nMISS CROSS \nNo. I have it. \nShe pricks her finger and holds it to her mouth. \nMISS CROSS \nDammit. \nMax starts to go in the room to help her. \nMAX \nHere. Let me see. \nMISS CROSS \nNo. Please, don't come in here. Look. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry I love your friend instead of you. But just. Please, Max. \nMiss Cross has tears in her eyes. Max goes slowly toward her. \nMAX \nYou honestly believe you love Blume instead of me? \nMISS CROSS \nYes. \nMAX \nYou'll forgive me if I won't take your word for that. \nMISS CROSS \nStop. If you don't stop with that ping-pong talk, I'm going to lose it. Do you understand me? \nMax takes Miss Cross' hand and kisses it. She pulls her and away. Max tries to embrace her. They struggle and Miss Cross overpowers Max. She holds his arms behind his back. \nMAX \nLet me go! \nMax struggles some more. Miss Cross pushes him hard across the room. Max smashes into some chairs and knocks over a desk. He yells at her: \nMAX \nI got kicked out because of you! \nMISS CROSS \nYou got kicked out because - \nMAX \nRushmore was my life. Now you are! \nMISS CROSS \nThat's bullshit! \nSilence. \nMISS CROSS \nWhat do you really think is going to happen between us? You think we're going to have sex? \nMax looks shocked. \nMAX \nThat's kind of a cheap way to put it, don't you think? \nMISS CROSS \n(pause) \nNot if you've never fucked before, it isn't. \nMAX \n(stunned) \nOh, my God. \nMISS CROSS \nHow would you put it to your friends? Do you want to finger me? Or maybe I could give you a hand job in the back of a Jaguar. Would that put an end to all of this? \nMiss Cross moves towards Max with her hand outstretched. Max retreats backwards, banging into desks and chairs. Miss Cross stops. \nMISS CROSS \nPlease. Get out of my room. \nMax walks out of the room and stands in the doorway. \nMiss Cross turns away and goes back to taking down her maps from the wall. Max watches her for a minute. \nMax leaves. \nEXT. QUADRANLGE. DAY \nMax comes out the door of the lower school in a daze. Magnus Buchan is sitting on a bench eating some candy. He is wearing the uniform of the Green Beret. He sees Max and laughs. \nMAGNUS \nFischer, ya spotty fucker! \nMAX \nHello, Magnus. \nMAGNUS \nGot any hand jobs lately? \nMAX \nNo, I haven't. \nDirk appears with some of his friends. \nMAGNUS \nHey, Dirk! Look who's here. Your stepfather! Waitin' for your mum so he can get a piece. \nDirk is very embarrassed. He frowns and looks at the ground. Max stares at Magnus with bitter contempt. \nMAX \nYour mind is as warped as your ear, Buchan. \nMAGNUS \n(standing up) \nDon't get nasty, brother. \nMax breaks into a sprint straight at Magnus. \nHe comes back into the room carrying a broom. He stops. \nDirk is sitting in one of the barber's chairs across the room. Silence. Max starts sweeping the floor. \nMAX \n(not looking at him) \nHello, Dirk. \nDIRK \nHi, Max. \nMAX \nWhat can I do for you? \nDIRK \nI thought I might get a haircut. \nMAX \nWe're closed. \nDirk nods. Max keeps sweeping. \nDIRK \nWell, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry I threw rocks at you the other day. \n(getting up) \nBut I guess I'll go now. \nDirk sets a little gift-wrapped present on the counter. \nDIRK \nMerry Christmas. \nMAX \nMax stops sweeping and looks over at Dirk. \nMAX \nWhat in the hell is that? \nDirk shrugs. Max goes over to the counter and picks up the present. He unwraps it. It is a Swiss Army Knife with an inscription on it. \nINSERT SWISS ARMY KNIFE: \nMax Fischer \nRushmore Yankee \nMax looks at the knife for a minute. He says wearily: \nMAX \nOK. Sit down. \nDirk sits back down in the barber's chair. Max puts his white jacket back on and starts giving Dirk a haircut. There is just a sound of scissors snipping for a minute. \nDIRK \nHave you heard the news? \nMAX \nI doubt it. I don't really follow the news anymore. \nDIRK \nDr. Guggenheim had a stroke. \nMAX \nI'll send him a box of candy. \nDIRK \nMaybe you ought to go visit him. \nMax stops snipping. Pause. \nMAX \nNo, thanks. \nMax starts snipping again. \nEXT. BARBERSHOP. EVENING \nDirk comes out of the barbershop in a terrible haircut. He waves to Max and rides off in his three-speed. \nINT. BARBERSHOP. EVENING \nMax waves back to Dirk. He reaches into the cooler and takes out a bottle of Schlitz. He pops it open with the bottle opener on the Swiss Army Knife. He drinks a sip and looks out into the lightly falling snow. He says quietly to himself: \nMAX \nI always thought I'd be the one to give him a stroke. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM. NIGHT \nDr. Guggenheim is in his hospital bed with his eyes half-shut and a bunch of plastic tubes sticking out of him. Mrs. Guggenheim sits in a chair at the foot of the bed reading a biography on Churchill. She looks exhausted. \nMax appears in the open doorway. He has a bouquet of violets in his hand. He knocks. \nMAX \nMrs. Guggenheim? \nMrs. Guggenheim looks up. Her face brightens and she goes to greet Max. \nMRS. GUGGENHEIM \nHello, Max. How are you? \nMAX \n(desolate) \nFine, thanks. \nMax starts to shake hands, but Mrs. Guggenheim hugs him and kisses him on the cheek. Max is caught a little offguard by this. There is lipstick on his cheek. \nMRS. GUGGENHEIM \nThese are glorious. Let me put them in some water. Sit down. \nShe takes the flowers and points to a chair beside the bed. Max sits down and stares at Dr. Guggenheim while Mrs. Guggenheim puts the violets in a vase. \nMAX \nShould I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim? Or can he not hear anything? \nMRS. GUGGENHEIM \nOh, no. He can hear you. \nMR. BLUME \nI wouldn't know. \nMAX \nWhy not? \nMR. BLUME \nBecause I haven't seen her in six weeks. \nMAX \n(frowns) \nWhat happened? \nMr. Blume shrugs. \nMAX \nShe left you? \nMr. Blume nods. \nMAX \nHow come? I thought she loved you. \nMR. BLUME \nSo did I. I guess maybe I am too old for her after all. \nMAX \n(sadly) \nMaybe so. Maybe so. \nMR. BLUME \nShe's still in love with the dead guy, anyway. \nMAX \nYou mean Edward Appleby. \nMR. BLUME \nOh, yeah. She's fucked up. \nMr. Blume lights a new cigarette. Max points to Mr. Blume's first cigarette, balanced on the handrail. \nMAX \nYou've already got one going, Mr. Blume. \nMr. Blume picks up his first cigarette and puts it in the opposite corner of his mouth from the second. He smiles at Max through the smoke. They get off to the 14th floor and the doors open. \nMR. BLUME \nAdios, amigo. \nMax waves good-bye. But Mr. Blume does not get off the elevator. He bends over and puts his hands on his knees and takes a series of deep breaths. The door starts to close. He reaches out and holds them open. Max looks concerned. \nMAX \nAre you OK? \nMr. Blume looks up at Max. He laughs and shakes his head. \nMR. BLUME \nI'm kind of lonely these days. \nMr. Blume sighs. He gets off the elevator. The doors close behind him as Max watches him walk down the hall. \nCUT TO DIRK'S BINOCULARS: \nMax comes out of the hospital and stands quietly in the cold for a minute. He gets on his mother's old bicycle. He rides off down the street. \nEXT. THE FISCHERS' HOUSE. DAY \nMax opens the Fischer's garage door. His smashed-up ten-speed hangs from a peg on the wall. He takes is down and carries it out off the garage. \nINT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. NIGHT \nMiss Cross is sitting up in her bed reading Treasure Island and listening to the radio. She is wearing pale blue pajamas. There is a knock on her windowpane. She looks up. \nShe hears someone trying to open the window. She gets up and pulls open the blinds. Max is outside on the roof wearing his parka and ski cap in the falling snow. He waves. \nMISS CROSS \nMax! \nMiss Cross opens the window. \nMISS CROSS \nWhat are you doing here? \nMAX \n(dazed) \nI don't know. Jesus. They came at me out of no where. It was - \nMISS CROSS \nWhat? \nMAX \nSo sudden. I just - \n(pause) \nI'm sorry. Can I use your phone? I just got hit by a car. \nMax points down at his destroyed ten-speed in the street under a street lamp. Parts are scattered all around it. \nMISS CROSS \nOh, my God. Are you OK? \nMAX \n(disoriented) \nWhat? \nMiss Cross notices a little cut over Max's eye. She lifts up the front of Max's ski cap. There is blood all over his forehead. She looks shocked. \nMISS CROSS \nCome inside. \nMAX \n(climbing in) \nThank you. \nShe got cancer. \nMiss Cross nods. She sighs. \nMISS CROSS \nLie still for a minute, OK? \nMAX \nOK. \nMiss Cross pushes Max's hair back with her hand. She looks at him for a minute. She touches the blood on his forehead with a cotton ball. She stops. \nMISS CROSS \nIs this fake blood? \nMAX \n(pause) \nYes, it is. \nMISS CROSS \nYou know, you and Herman deserve each other. You're little children. Let me show you to the door. \nMax gets up and goes over to the window. He climbs out onto the roof. He looks back to Miss Cross. \nMAX \nThat wasn't a very satisfying conversation. \nMiss Cross shrugs. Silence. \nMAX \nAll right. Goodbye, Miss Cross. \nMISS CROSS \nGoodbye, Max. \nMax disappears into the darkness. \nEXT. FROZEN POND. DAY \nA few ICE SKATERS race around and do figure-8's on the little frozen pond at the edge of town. Dirk is sitting on his tackle box, fishing from a hole in the ice. He stomps his feet, and even with his mittens on he has to blow into his hands to keep warm. \nMax sits with his bare hands resting on the ice. \nMAX \nPeople hate me. \nDIRK \nThat's not true. \nMAX \nGuggenheim tried to spit on me. \nPoor old guy couldn't even spit. \nAnd Blume and Cross? \n(shakes his head) \nThey can't stand me. \nI ruined their whole relationship. \nDirk looks down at Max's red hands. \nDIRK \nYou should put your mittens on. \nMAX \n(absently) \nOh. They're already numb. I'm surprised you don't spit on me, Dirk. \nDIRK \nYou're my friend, Max. \nTear's starts streaming down Max's face. Dirk looks worried. \nMAX \nI'm sorry about what I said about your mother giving me a hand job. I just -- \nDIRK \nI know, Max. Listen. I'm sorry I didn't take your hand when Buchan kicked your ass. \nMAX \n(pause) \nI got a few licks in. At the very least, he'll think twice about spreading that kind of garbage. \nDIRK \nYou should stand up. \nMAX \nI'm awfully comfortable. \nSilence. One of the skaters begins to circle around Max and Dirk closer and closer. She suddenly scratches to a halt right in front of them. \nThe skater is a girl in white skates and grey tights and a short camel's hair coat. She has a scarf over the lower half of her face. She says to Max: \nSKATER \nIs this your handwriting? \nShe holds out a little piece of paper torn out from a spiral notebook. Max stands up and takes it. There is a note written on it in blue crayon. \nINSERT PIECE OF PAPER: \nPlease come to the frozen pond at 3:30 PM this afternoon. Thank you very much. \nMax looks to Dirk. Dirk is putting a new worm on his hook. \nMAX \nNo. But it looks familiar. \nMax gives the piece of paper back to the girl. She lowers her scarf and we see she is Margaret Yang. \nMAX \nDo you know Dirk Calloway? \nMARGARET \nI don't think so. \nMAX \nThanks for meeting me, Mr. Blume. \nMR. BLUME \nWhat can I do for you? \nMax hands Mr. Blume a little white cardboard box. Mr. Blume frowns. \nMR. BLUME \nWhat's this? \nMax shrugs. Mr. Blume starts to open the box. Max flinches away like the box is going to explode. Mr. Blume stops. Max smiles and motions for Mr. Blume to go ahead. Mr. Blume opens the box. There are two little pins inside. \nMAX \nThat's the Perfect Attendance awards and the Punctuality Award. I got those at Rushmore. I thought you could choose which one you like more, and you could wear that one and I could wear the other. \nMr. Blume's face softens. He nods slowly. He studies the pins and says quietly: \nMR. BLUME \nI'll take punctuality. \nMAX \nOK. \nThey put their pins in their lapels. \nMR. BLUME \nThank you. \nMax nods. He smiles. \nMAX \nCome on. Let's go inside. \nMax motions to the barbershop. Mr. Blume looks confused. \nINT. BARBERSHOP. DAY \nMr. Blume follows Max into the barbershop. Mr. Fischer looks up from his newspaper. \nMR. FISCHER \nWell, looks what the cat dragged in. \nMAX \nSorry, I'm late. I want you to meet somebody. \n(looks to Mr. Blume) \nMr. Blume, this is my father, Bert Fischer. \nSilence. Mr. Blume nods slowly. \nMR. BLUME \nNice to meet you, Mr. Fischer. \nMR. FISCHER \n(smiles) \nMr. Fischer's my father's name. Call me Bert. \nMR. BLUME \n(pause) \nOK, Bert. \nMR. FISCHER \nMax tells me you could use a haircut. \nMr. Blume hesitates. \nMR. FISCHER \nLet's have a look at you. \nMr. Blume sits down in one of the barber's chairs and looks in the mirror. Max and Mr. Fischer stand on either side of him. Mr. Blume looks terrible. He sighs deeply. \nMR. BLUME \nI don't know, Bert. \nMR. FISCHER \nDon't worry. We might have to throw in a shave, too. Max? Why don't you get Mr. Blume a cup of coffee? \nEXT. BARBERSHOP. DAY \nMax and Mr. Blume come out of the barbershop and walk quickly down the sidewalk. Mr. Blume's hair is crisply cut and neatly combed, but his clothes still look very disheveled. \nMAX \nHow much are you worth, by the way? \nMR. BLUME \nI don't know. \nMAX \nOver ten million? \nMR. BLUME \nYeah. I guess so. \nMAX \nGood, good. \nMR. BLUME \nWhy? \nMAX \nCause we're going to need all of it. \nDECEMBER MONTAGE: \nChristmas decorations are evident throughout the following scenes. \nMax and Mr. Blume watch a Jacques Cousteau film on 16mm in Mr. Blume's office. Ernie runs the projector. \nMax and Mr. Blume visit a marine research facility. Mr. Blume holds up a fish at the edge of a pool. A killer whale jumps out of the water and takes it in its teeth. \nMax and Mr. Blume sprint down the street and through the park in warm-up suits. They hurdle bushes and dodge traffic. They run into an empty football stadium and race up the bleachers. \nMax's young architect shows Max and Mr. Blume a miniature baseball diamond field. The architect slides over the diamond an inch and puts model of a building labeled The Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory in its place. \nMax and Dirk skate around on the frozen pond during complicated tricks and jumps. \nI'll see you at 3:15. \nMax starts walking away down the sidewalk. \nDIRK \nWhere you going? \nMAX \n9without stopping) \nRushmore. I got one last piece of unfinished business I got to attend to. \nEXT. RUSHMORE. DAY \nMax pumps his pellet gun shot about twenty times. He raises the stock to his shoulder as Magnus Buchan walks onto the quadrangle. He draws a bead on him and follows him in his sight as he passes be. He fires. \nMagnus screams and grabs his only good ear. He spins around and sees Max cocking a pellet gun. \nMAGNUS \nFischer! Ya fuck! \nMAX \nHello, Magnus. I'd have shot you in the other ear, but it got blown off a long time ago. \nMagnus starts to come at Max. Max points his weapon at him. \nMAX \nNot so fast. \nMagnus stops. \nMAX \nI owed you that one. Now we're even. \nMAGNUS \n(smiles crookedly) \nNot for long, kemosabe. \nMAX \n(shrugs) \nWe'll see. \nSilence. Max holds Magnus at gunpoint. \nMAX \nI got a proposition for you. \nMAGNUS \nShove it up your mother's arse, ya little prick. \nMAX \nI've got to hand it to you, Magnus. You've got a way with words. You want to be in a play? \nMAGNUS \n(puzzled) \nDon't piss with me, Fischer. \nMAX \nI'm not pissing with you. \n(reaching in his backpack) \nI brought you a script. \nMax hands Magnus a script with a red cover. \nMAGNUS \nWhat's all this shite? \nMAX \nNothing. I just think you're right for the part. \nMagnus stares at Max. He says quietly: \nMAGNUS \nI always wanted to be in one of those frickin' plays of yours. \nMAX \nI know you did, mate. \nMagnus looks at the script. \nINSERT COVER OF PLAY: \nHEAVEN AND HELL \na new play by Max Fischer \nrevised draft \nDramatists Guild registered \nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. NIGHT \nThe school auditorium. \nWe see many familiar faces in the audience: Mr. Fischer, Dr. Guggenheim in his wheelchair, Mrs. Guggenheim, Mrs. Calloway, Mrs. Whitney, the Indian groundskeeper, the yearbook photographer, Coach Beck, Ernie, Mr. Holstead, Mr. Adams, the police who arrested Max, some old men from the barbershop. They are all dressed nicely in evening clothes. \nMiss Cross' friend John, whom Max humiliated at dinner after the Serpico play, is seated in the third row. He is dressed in a coat and tie. \nAn USHER directs Miss cross to her seat. She is surprised to see that it is right nest to Mr. Blume's. She reluctantly sits down beside him. Mr. Blume sees her. \nMISS CROSS \nHi, Herman. \nMr. Blume nods. He pulls his ticket out of his inside pocket and checks the seat number. He looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross smiles. \nMISS CROSS \nLooks like Max pulled a fast one on us. \nMr. Blume nods. \nMISS CROSS \nHow's your aquarium coming along? \nMR. BLUME \nNot too bad. It should be finished in October. \nMiss Cross nods. \nMAGNUS \nTag 'em and bag 'em, cherries! We're moving out! Let's DD! \nMax throws down his rifle into a foxhole and begins to cry quietly. Someone moves slowly toward him out of the settling smoke. Max wheels around and whips out his Swiss Army knife. \nBut then he sees it is Margaret Yang as a Vietnamese villager. She has been through hell. \nMARGARET \nHello, Esposito. \nMax drops his knife and it stabs into the floor. He puts out his hand. Margaret takes it. He pulls her in and hugs her. \nMiss Cross smiles sadly. \nMax looks into Margaret Yang's eyes. \nMAX \nWill you marry me, Le-Chahn? \nMARGARET \n(instantly) \nYou bet I will. \nWagner's Flight of the Walkyries begins to play loudly from behind the stage as Max kisses Margaret and the curtain drops to wild applause. \nMrs. Guggenheim looks on in amazement as Dr. Guggenheim stands up out of his wheelchair and leads the ovation. The rest of the audience quickly follows suit. \nThe Indian groundskeeper is laughing hysterically. \nINT. GYMNASIUM. NIGHT \nThe gymnasium has been filled with palm trees and decorated like an Army barracks. Flares burn in circles around the tables. A banner at the entrance says The Heaven and Hell Cotillion. \nDirk and a couple of his CLASSMATES are looking at some vintage Playboy centerfolds taped-up on the wall as part of the Army barracks motif. \nMiss Cross and John are talking at the punchbowl. \nMISS CROSS \nMax sent you an invitation? \nJOHN \nYeah. And he told me to wear a tie. \nMax and Margaret are drinking ginger ales and chatting with Mr. Fischer and MR. and MRS. YANG. \nMAX \nThank you, Mrs. Yang. I actually wrote a different version of the play two years ago. But I couldn't get it done over at Rushmore. \nMRS. YANG \nWhy? Too political? \nMAX \nNo. A kid got his finger blown off during rehearsals. \nMax sees Mr. Blume and Miss Cross approaching. \nMAX \nMiss Cross, this is my father Bert Fischer. He's a barber. \n(to Mr. Fischer) \nThis is my friend Rosemary Cross. \nMr. Fischer smiles as they shake hands. \nMR. FISCHER \nHi, Rosemary. \nMISS CROSS \nNice to finally meet you, Bert. \nMAX \nAnd, of course, you know Mr. Blume. I also want everyone to meet Mr. and Mrs. Yang. And this is Margaret. \nMiss Cross and Margaret smile at each other. \nMISS CROSS \nHello, Margaret. \nMARGARET \nHello, Miss Cross. \nThe Indian groundskeeper is talking with Coach Beck and Mr. Blume's foreman, Ernie. \nCOACH BECK \nI'm surprised they let him build a real campfire onstage. That's a safety hazard. \nERNIE \nWell, last year he tried to raise piranhas. \nCOACH BECK \nWhat'd you think of the play, Mr. Littlejeans? \nGROUNDSKEEPER \nBest play all year, man. \nMr. Blume, Magnus Buchan, and the Rushmore yearbook photographer are having a conversation. \nMAGNUS \nWell, Fischer stepped on half of my bleedin' lines. \nMR. BLUME \nReally? I didn't notice. \nPHOTOGRAPHER \nAre Ronny and Donny having a good time at military school? \nMR. BLUME \n(instantly) \nThey love it. \nMAGNUS \nLucky bastards. \nMr. Fischer is talking with John. \nJOHN \n", "test1_input": "MISS CROSS \n(angry) \nYou're the one who ordered him a Scotch and soda. \nMAX \nWhat's wrong with that? I can write a hit play. Why can't I have a drink when I want to unwind a little? So tell me, Curly. How do you know Miss Cross? \nJOHN \nWe went to Harvard together. \nMAX \n(shrugs) \nAnd I wrote a hit play. And directed it. So I'm not sweating it, either. \nMR. BLUME \n(signaling the waiter) \nI'm going to get the check. \nMAX \nWhat do you think you're doing? \nMR. BLUME \nI'm getting the - \nMAX \nNo, you're not. \nThe Waiter comes over. Max intercepts him: \nMAX \nI just wanted to thank you again for accommodating us. We only expected to be a party of three, but somebody invited himself along. I apologize. \nWAITER \nThat's perfectly all right. \nThe waiter walks away. Miss Cross frowns. \nMISS CROSS \nYou're being rude, Max. \nMAX \nNo I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out why you brought this gentleman to my play. And my dinner, which was invitation only. \nJohn reaches in front of Max for the butter. Max grabs his spoon and swats John on the back of the hand. \nMAX \nWould you like me to pass you the butter? \nMax hands John the butter. \nMISS CROSS \nWhat's wrong with you? \nMAX \n(raising his voice) \nWhat's wrong with YOU? \nMax is making a scene. People all over the restaurant are watching. Max stares at Miss Cross. \nMAX \nYou hurt my feelings. This night was important to me. \nMISS CROSS \nHow did I hurt your feelings? \nMAX \nI wrote a hit play! \n(pause) \nAnd I'm in love with you. \nJohn looks to Miss Cross. She doesn't know what to say. Max looks drunk and dejected. \nMAX \nHow do you like that, Curly? \nEXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY \nMiss Cross and her pupils are out on the playground painting pictures. Each kid has an easel. \nMiss Cross sees Mr. Blume standing under a tree at the edge of the playground. He is wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette. He moves slightly behind the tree. She stares at him. \nHe waves. She waves back. He comes over. \nMR. BLUME \nHi. \nMISS CROSS \nWere you hiding over there? \nMr. Blume shrugs. He points at one of the paintings. \nMR. BLUME \nWhat's that? \nThe artist looks up at Mr. Blume. He is a small boy with jet- black curly hair and piercing eyes. \nARTIST \n(makes a swimming gesture) \nIt's a little swimming snake. \nMr. Blume nods. \nMISS CROSS \nWhat can I do for you, Mr. Blume? \nMr. Blume turns to Miss Cross and takes off his sunglasses. Silence. \nMR. BLUME \nMax wants to see you. \nMISS CROSS \n", "test1_true": "MR. BLUME \nTo apologize, I guess. \nMISS CROSS \nHe sent you here? \nMR. BLUME \nYeah. \nShe frowns and studies Mr. Blume for a minute. \nMISS CROSS \nAre you his messenger? \nMR. BLUME \nNo. He's my friend. \n(pause) \nYou were right. I shouldn't have let him drink. \nMiss Cross nods. Silence. \nMISS CROSS \nI don't think I should see Max anymore. \nMR. BLUME \nHe's not going to like the sound of that. \nMISS CROSS \nI know. But I think I let him get too attached. \nMr. Blume nods. Miss Cross looks uncertain. \nMISS CROSS \nDon't you think? \nMR. BLUME \n(shrugs) \nI don't know. You did your best. \nMiss Cross smiles sadly to Mr. Blume. He puts his hands in his pockets. \nMISS CROSS \nTell him I'm sorry. \nMR. BLUME \nOK. \nThey look at each other for a long minute.

BLUME \nOh, yeah. He wrote you a letter. \nHe hands her a letter in a sealed envelope. She takes it. \nMISS CROSS \nThanks. \nThey stand there in silence for another minute. \nMR. BLUME \nOK.

Max stands with his architect, smiling for the yearbook photographer. They are holding a banner that says 'Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory Fund-raiser'. Max has on a hard hat. There are two pick-up trucks and a porta-can at the back of the vacant lot. \nMax digs into the ground with a gold shovel. The shovel has a ribbon around it. Flashbulbs go off. Everyone claps. Max waves Dirk over. \nMAX \nDid you see her? \nDIRK \n", "test1_id": 1233, "test2_input": "She's not here. \nMAX \nWell, see if she's in her classroom. \nThe Contractor walks over to Max. \nCONTRACTOR \nShould we go ahead and take care of this tree? \nMAX \nLet's wait a few minutes. \nCoach Beck goes over to Max. He is six four and wears a John Newcombe mustache and an Adidas warm-up. He is frowning. \nCOACH BECK \nWhat's going on here, Maxie? \nMAX \nCoach Beck. Good to see you. This is where they're building the new aquarium. I'm in charge of the committee, if you can believe it. \nCOACH BECK \nThis is the baseball diamond. \nMAX \nI believe it's being relocated a few feet over. \nCOACH BECK \n(frowns) \nI should've been informed about that. \nCoach Beck walks off. Max answers some questions for the School Reporters. \nREPORTER \nIs it true the aquarium will have piranhas? \nMAX \n(smiles) \nWhere'd you hear that? \nREPORTER \nMy source indicated that it was a possibility. \nMAX \nYes, it's true. Excuse me, George. \nDirk has returned. \nMAX \nWhat's the story? \nDIRK \n(a little wary) \nShe has a substitute teacher today. \nMAX \nWhy? \nDIRK \nShe probably got sick. \nMAX \n(looks away) \nYou know she's not sick. Give me the phone. \nMax dials on a cellular phone. \nMAX \nHi, Janet. It's Max Fischer. \nIs Mr. Blume there? \n(pause) \nWell, where is he? \n(pause) \nGoddammit, he's supposed to be here. \nLet me know if you find him, please. \nMax hangs up. He looks off and says in a steely voice: \nMAX \nI'm going anyway. \nMax goes over to the contractor. \nMAX \nChop it down, Mr. Chandler! We've got an aquarium to build. \nMax talks to another reporter. \nMAX \nI don't give a shit about barracudas. But fuck it. I'm building it anyway. \nThe sound of power saws fills the air as Dr. Guggenheim appears at the edge of the lot with Coach Beck and a Security Guard with a walkie-talkie. DR Guggenheim screams: \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \nMax! \nDR. Guggenheim sees the chopped-down trees and mangles baseball field as he strides on to the lot. \nMAX \nNice to see you, Dr. Gugg- \nDR.

GUGGENHEIM \nShut those damn things off! \nThey turn off the power saws. \nDR.

QUADRANGLE - DAY \nDirk waits nervously on the steps in front of DR. Guggenheim's office. He holds a hamster in his hands. \nHe gets up and goes to the windows. He looks inside. \nMax is sitting in a little chair in the middle of the room with his hard hat on. DR. Guggenheim and several other faculty members sit around him. DR. Guggenheim is screaming at him across his desk. Max is crying. \nDirk looks scared. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nMax kneels on the floor in the hallway, emptying out his locker. Papers and trash are scattered all around him. There is a trashcan beside him. He is throwing away his books, one at a time. \nMr. Blume opens the door at the end of the hallway. Max looks up at him. Silence. Max looks up back to his locker and starts throwing his books in the trash again. \nMr. Blume walks over to Max. He looks very sad. He kneels down beside Max. He starts helping him pick up the trash off the floor and put it in the trashcan. \nTITLE: \nOctober. \nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nGrover Cleveland is a public high school with two thousand five hundred students. \nMax sits in a front row of a math classroom. He is dressed in his Rushmore uniform, with coat and tie, but his clothes are wrinkled and his head has been shaved like a marine's. His eyes have dark circles around them. He has a little stack of index cards in his hand. \nThe teacher, Mrs. Whitney, stands at the front of the room. She is about fifty with a horn-rimmed glasses and a slight English accent. She has a bemused expression on her face. \nMRS WHITNEY \nWe have a new student with us today. His name's Max Fischer and he's actually asked to say a few words to the class. Max? You want to take it away? \nMAX \n(standing up) \nSure. Thanks very much. I just wanted to introduce myself. \nMax looks quickly at his notecards. \nMAX \nI'm Max Fischer. I'm a former student of Rushmore Academy, which I recently got expelled from. \nMax flips to the next notecard. \nMAX \nThis is my first time in a public school. And I know you probably think I was born with a silverspoon in my mouth. But I'm no elitist. I think you've got some great facilities, and I'm really looking forward to making the best of it over here at Grover Cleveland. \nMax sighs deeply. He rubs his eyes. His Classmates have no idea what to make of him. However, one Asian girl in the back row is smiling faintly. She has short-cropped hair. The spine of one of her book covers says Margaret Yang. \nMAX \nOne footnote: I noticed you don't have a fencing team. I'm going to start one up. Let me know if you'd like to join. Thanks. \nINT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nThe wide halls of Grover Cleveland High School are lined with orange lockers. A banner stretched down the wall says 'Murder the Mustangs'. A bustling throng of high schoolers rush to class. \nMax walks slowly, alone, down the middle of the hall. A blonde cheerleader-type Girl asks him: \nGIRL \nWhy are you so dressed up? \nMax looks down at his clothes. Max looks back to the girl. \nMAX \nAre you insane? \nThe girl walks off. Margaret Yang catches up to Max. \nMARGARET \nMax? \nMAX \nYes? \nMARGARET \nHi. I'm Margaret Yang. I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class. I just wanted to tell you I liked your speech. I don't think I've ever heard of anyone asking to give a speech in class before. \nMAX \nHow unfortunate. \nMARGARET \nThe silver spoon remark might rub some people the wrong way. But I think I know how you meant it. \nMAX \nGlad to hear it. Goodbye, Miss Chang. \nMax ducks into the men's room. Margaret walks quietly away. \nINT. GYMNASIUM - DAY \nA tiny figure dressed all in white stands alone at the far end of the huge gymnasium with a fencing oil. He lunges, parries, and thrusts. \nThe basketball team suddenly floods dribbling into the gymnasium, throwing passes and taking free throws. Max stops fencing as they take over the room. He watches them in silence. He shakes his head. He walks off the court. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nMax puts a quarter in a pay phone. He is still wearing his fencing costume. \nMAX \nJanet. Max Fischer. Is he in? \nEXT. RUSHMORE - DAY \nMr. Blume answers on his cellular phone as he gets out of his car and walks across the lawn at Rushmore. \nWe intercut the two of them. \nMR. BLUME \nHey, Max.

THE BILBY-FLICKENGER HOTEL. NIGHT \nThe vast lobby of the Bilby-Flickenger. Mr. Blume is leaning against the counter at the front desk. His luggage fills up two carts behind him. A faint smile plays across his lips as he stares off into space. The CONCIERGE is checking him in. \nCONCIERGE \nAnd how long will you be staying with us, Mr. Blume? \nMR. BLUME \nIndefinitely. I'm getting a divorce. \nCONCIERGE \n(typing away) \nVery good, sir. \nMr. Blume yells to the BELLMAN. \nMR. BLUME \nYo! \nThe bellman looks up. Mr. Blume waves. The bellman waves back. The concierge gives Mr. Blume his room key. \nCONCIERGE \nHere you are Mr. Blume. Charles will show you to your room. \nMR. BLUME \nWonderful. Where's the pool, by the way? I might want to take a dip before dinner. \nCONCIERGE \nIt's on the roof, sir. \nMR. BLUME \nTerrific! \nMr. Blume gets on the elevator with the bellman. The bellman looks at him and smiles. \nBELLMAN \nYou certainly seem happy today, sir. \nMR. BLUME \nYou bet your little ass I am, shorty. I lost my family. But I gained a woman I love. \nBELLMAN \nNot a bad tradeoff. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY \nThe living room of Mr. Blume's suite. Mr. Blume is dressed in a bathrobe with the Bilbly-Flickenger stitched on the pocket. He sits at his table having breakfast and reading the newspaper. There is a little basket in front of him with a jar of hone in it. A note attached to the jar says, \"Enjoy your stay.\" \nA little bug flies around Mr. Blume's head. He swats it away and keeps reading. \nTwo more bugs come buzzing around him. Mr. Blume looks up and frowns. They're bees. Mr. Blume slaps at his neck and jumps to his feet as he gets stung. \nMR. BLUME \nShit! \nBees are circling all over the room. Mr. Blume looks around frantically. He sees something at the bottom of the front door. It is a little plastic tube with bees crawling out of it and taking off. \nINT. BASEMENT. DAY \nMax comes out of the freight elevator wearing a red room service jacket with the Bilby-Flickenger stitched on the pocket. He has a wooden box with Rushmore Beekeepers stenciled on it. Max throws the jacket in a laundry cart and goes out the back door. \nEXT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. DAY \nMr. Blume gets out of his car in the driveway at Grover Cleveland. He opens the trunk and takes out a set of steel cable cutters. He goes over to the bike racks and cuts the lock off Max's ten-speed. \nMr. Blume lays the bicycle on the ground in front of his car and runs over it. Then he throws the car in reverse and goes over it again. He picks up the destroyed bicycle and takes it back to the bike racks and wraps the lock back around it. \nThe small Indian groundskeeper we saw earlier on the roof is driving by in a Volkswagen Beetle. He frowns at Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume hurries back to his car. \nEXT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE. DAY \nThe front gates of the concrete plant. Max rides up on an old grandmothers' bicycle with fenders and a handlebar basket. He's got a black duffel bag strapped to his back. \nMax waves to the SECURITY GUARD. The guard waves back: \nMax rides onto the lot and pulls over next to Mr. Blume's Bentley. He leans his bike against the car door. He unzips his duffel bag and slides underneath the car. \nEXT. RUSHMORE. DAY \nMr. Blume pulls into the driveway to pick-up the twins from school. There is a lot of traffic and kids are running around everywhere. Mr. Blume taps the brakes. Nothing happens. He flies toward the back of a parked station wagon. \nHe jerks the steering wheel and bounces up onto the sidewalk. The car pops through a wooden fence and rolls across the grass into the quadrangle. \nThe Indian groundskeeper is raking leaves as the car goes past him. He watches as it crunches over some bushes and scrapes against a stone wall. It rolls to a stop in the middle of the quad. \nMr. Blume gets out of the car and looks at the damage. He looks over at the white-haired Indian groundskeeper. \nThe groundskeeper goes back to raking. \nEXT. PARKING LOT. DAY \nKids watch from classrooms up and down the hall as Max is escorted away in handcuffs by the POLICE. Max has a hardened expression on his face. \nINT. POLICE STATION. DAY \nThe county lock-up. Mr. Fischer watches through bulletproof glass as Max walks down a long, lonely corridor. \nThe door buzzes open. Max comes into the waiting room. \nMAX \nThanks for bailing me out, Dad.

DAY \nMax walks into the quadrangle with cold expression on his face. It is Halloween and there is a jack-o-lantern on the steps. Lots of kids are dressed in costumes. \n", "test3_true": "Dirk is dressed as a sorcerer. Tommy has on a karate outfit with a black belt. Max runs for cover behind some bushes. \nMAX \nWhat are you doing? Are you crazy? \nDIRK \nYou're trespassing! This is private property! \nMore rocks sail past Max. A pinecone hits him on the head. \nMAX \nWait a minute! Stop! \nMax raises his hands in the air. Dirk motions for Tommy to hold his fire. Max slowly stands up. \nMAX \nLet's have a truce for a second. I want to talk. \nThey meet out in the open. Tommy follows with a rock in each hand. Silence. \nMAX \nWhat's this all about? \nDirk stares at Max or along minute. \nDIRK \nDid you say my mother gave you a hand job? \nMAX \n(shocked) \nWhat? \nDIRK \n(steely) \nDid you say it? \nMAX \nWho told you that goddamn lie? \nSilence. \nMAX \nNever mind. I know who said it. And I'm going to stick a knife in his heart. And I'm going to send him back to Ireland in a bodybag. \nTOMMY \nHe's from Scotland. \nMAX \nWell, tell that stupid mick he just made my list of things to do today. I'm going to pop a cap in his ass. \nINT. TEAROOM. DAY \nA little salon with Persian rugs. There is a fire in the fireplace and a harpsichord plays softly on the radio. Dr. Guggenheim is sitting at a little table having tea with Max. \nDr. Guggenheim has several bottles of prescription medicine in front of him and a blanket wrapped around him like a shawl. He stares at Max stonily. There is a manila envelope on the table in between them. \nMAX \nDid you receive the package? \nDr. Guggenheim motions to the envelope. Max nods. \nMAX \nGood. I just wanted to inform you about what's going on. \nDr. Guggenheim stares at Max with contempt. \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \nI never took you for an informer, Max. \nMAX \n(frowns) \nWhat's that suppose to mean? \nSilence. Max reaches out to take the envelope. Dr. Guggenheim slams his hand on it and leans across the table at Max. \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \n(fiercely) \nShe resigned this morning. \nBefore I even got your little snapshots. So your latest attempt at sabotage has backfired. \nMAX \n(pause) \nBut she's one of the best teachers you've got. \n(yelling) \nHow could you let her resign? \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \nWhy are you trying to get her fired? \nMAX \nYou stupid old fool! I'm trying to win her back! \nDr. Guggenheim starts coughing and turning red. He knocks the envelope off the table and the pictures spill out all over the floor. \nINSERT PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE FLOOR: \nThey're of Mr. Blume and Miss Cross kissing in the window of a Chinese restaurant. \nINT.

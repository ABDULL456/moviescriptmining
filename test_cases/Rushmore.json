By the time you hit 45 you're been fucked over so many times you don't really care anymore. \nMAX \nI'm sorry to hear that. \nMr. Blume sighs deeply. He stares out the windshield. \nMR. BLUME \nWhat's the secret, Max? \nMAX \nThe secret? \nMR. BLUME \nYeah. You look like you've got it all figured out. \nMAX \n(pause) \nI don't know. I think you just gotta find something you love to do, then do it for the rest of your life. \n(shrugs) \nFor me, it's going to Rushmore. \nMax looks very serious. Mr. Blume smiles and nods. \nMAX \nHey, Ronny. Hey, Donny. \nMr. Blume's red-headed twins RONNY and DONNY come over to the car. They're Max's age but much more thick and solid. \nRONNY \nShotgun. \nDonny gets in the front seat anyway. Ronny hollers: \nRONNY \nI said shotgun, Donny! \nMR. BLUME \nGet in the back, Ronny. \nRONNY \nI said, \"Shotgun.\" Get in the back, Donny. \nDonny punches three different buttons on the dash that crank up the AC full blast. Mr. Blume's hair dances in the cold burst of air. He shuts off the AC. \nMAX \nSee you tomorrow, Mr. Blume. \n(looks off) \nMrs. Reynolds! \nMax goes over to shake hands with somebody else's parents. Mr. Blume looks at Max fondly. \nMR. BLUME \nDid you invite that kid to your party? \nDONNY \n(shocked) \nMax Fischer? \nRONNY \nCome on, Dad. There's gonna be girls there. \nDONNY \nI'd rather die.

He is followed by Dirk who is holding a script. \nMAX \nExcellent. Irving? \nThe stage manager is a wavy-haired sophomore named IRVING. He comes out from the backstage.

I need a signature on this geometry test, by the way. \nMax leaves his test on the counter and rolls his bike into the back room. Gordon gives Mr. Fischer ten dollars. \nGORDON \nThank you very much. \nGordon goes out the door. Mr. Fischer looks at the geometry test. Max comes out of the back room drinking a glass of chocolate milk with a straw. \nMR. FISCHER \nHm. \nMAX \nI know. \nMR. FISCHER \nA 37. \nMAX \nPathetic. Just pathetic. \nMR. FISCHER \nWell. It could have been worse. You were right more than a third of the time. \nMAX \n(exploding) \nCome on, Dad! That stinks! I can do better than that! \nMR. FISCHER \nOf course, you can. \nMAX \nFor once, will you please try not to look on the bright side? \nMR. FISCHER \nSit down and let me give you a trim. \nMax sighs deeply. He sits down. Mr. Fischer signs the geometry test. He puts a pale blue smoke over Max and gives him a haircut. \nMAX \nDo you think I'm stupid? \nMR. FISCHER \nNo! You're just not very good at math. \nMAX \nBut I'm failing English and History, too. \nMR. FISCHER \n(pause) \nWell. Maybe you'd be better off at a school where there's not so much emphasis on academics. \nMAX \nWhat, like barber college? \nMr. Fischer is stricken. Max says quietly: \nMAX \nNo, I love Rushmore. I don't want to go someplace second rate. Besides, it would ruin my chances of getting into Oxford. \nSilence. Mr. Fischer looks very sad. \nMR. FISCHER \nI wish I knew how to help you.

Max keeps sweeping. \nDIRK \nWell, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry I threw rocks at you the other day. \n(getting up) \nBut I guess I'll go now. \nDirk sets a little gift-wrapped present on the counter. \nDIRK \nMerry Christmas. \nMAX \nMax stops sweeping and looks over at Dirk. \nMAX \nWhat in the hell is that? \nDirk shrugs. Max goes over to the counter and picks up the present. He unwraps it. It is a Swiss Army Knife with an inscription on it. \nINSERT SWISS ARMY KNIFE: \nMax Fischer \nRushmore Yankee \nMax looks at the knife for a minute. He says wearily: \nMAX \nOK. Sit down. \nDirk sits back down in the barber's chair. Max puts his white jacket back on and starts giving Dirk a haircut. There is just a sound of scissors snipping for a minute. \nDIRK \nHave you heard the news? \nMAX \nI doubt it. I don't really follow the news anymore. \nDIRK \nDr. Guggenheim had a stroke. \nMAX \nI'll send him a box of candy. \nDIRK \nMaybe you ought to go visit him. \nMax stops snipping. Pause. \nMAX \nNo, thanks. \nMax starts snipping again. \nEXT. BARBERSHOP. EVENING \nDirk comes out of the barbershop in a terrible haircut. He waves to Max and rides off in his three-speed. \nINT.

He knocks. \nMAX \nMrs. Guggenheim? \nMrs. Guggenheim looks up. Her face brightens and she goes to greet Max. \nMRS. GUGGENHEIM \nHello, Max. How are you? \nMAX \n(desolate) \nFine, thanks. \nMax starts to shake hands, but Mrs. Guggenheim hugs him and kisses him on the cheek. Max is caught a little offguard by this. There is lipstick on his cheek. \nMRS. GUGGENHEIM \nThese are glorious. Let me put them in some water. Sit down. \nShe takes the flowers and points to a chair beside the bed. Max sits down and stares at Dr. Guggenheim while Mrs. Guggenheim puts the violets in a vase. \nMAX \nShould I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim? Or can he not hear anything? \nMRS. GUGGENHEIM \nOh, no.

Max hesitates. \nMAX \nI just came to pay my respects. \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \n(frowns) \nNo, you didn't. You don't respect anybody. \nDr. Guggenheim tries to spit at Max, but his mouth is too dry. Mrs. Guggenheim comes over to him. \nMRS. GUGGENHEIM \nNelson? \nDr. Guggenheim mutters deliriously. \nDR. GUGGENHEIM \nDammit. Goddammit. \nMrs. Guggenheim takes Dr. Guggenheim's hand and holds it. He calms down. His eyes close and he relaxes. Silence. \nMrs. Guggenheim looks to Max. \nMRS. GUGGENHEIM \nThat's the first thing he's said in ten days. \nMAX \nYou think he recognized me? \nMRS. GUGGENHEIM \nI'm not sure. \nCUT TO: \nDirk hidden in the bushes across the street from the hospital. He checks his watch.

ELEVATOR. NIGHT \nMax rides down in the elevator with a NURSE and a wheezing OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair. The doors open in the lobby and Max waits while the nurse wheels out the old woman. \nThen he sees Mr. Blume in front of him, waiting for the elevator. He has a bouquet of carnations in one hand and a diet Coke in the other. He has a black eye under his sunglasses. He is very disheveled. \nMR. BLUME \nHey, amigo. \nMAX \nYou look horrible. \nMR. BLUME \nYou don't look too great yourself. Good to see you. \nMAX \nYou here to see Guggenheim? \nMR. BLUME \nYeah.

Max flinches away like the box is going to explode. Mr. Blume stops. Max smiles and motions for Mr. Blume to go ahead. Mr. Blume opens the box. There are two little pins inside. \nMAX \nThat's the Perfect Attendance awards and the Punctuality Award. I got those at Rushmore. I thought you could choose which one you like more, and you could wear that one and I could wear the other. \nMr. Blume's face softens. He nods slowly. He studies the pins and says quietly: \nMR.

Why don't you get Mr. Blume a cup of coffee? \nEXT. BARBERSHOP. DAY \nMax and Mr. Blume come out of the barbershop and walk quickly down the sidewalk. Mr. Blume's hair is crisply cut and neatly combed, but his clothes still look very disheveled. \nMAX \nHow much are you worth, by the way? \nMR. BLUME \nI don't know. \nMAX \nOver ten million? \nMR.

Mr. Blume is holding a gold shovel with a ribbon around it. \nMR. BLUME \nShe's not coming, is she? \nMAX \n(pause) \nIt doesn't look good. \nMR. BLUME \nAh, shit, man.

It's kind of a shame, since he's building it for you. \nMISS CROSS \nWell, you know, I never asked anybody to build me an aquarium. I'm not sure how that rumor got started. \nMAX \nHm. Me, neither. You think Edward Appleby would've built you one? \nMiss Cross thinks for a minute. She sounds surprised at her on response. \nMISS CROSS \nYeah. He probably would've. If he had the money. \nMAX \n(smiles) \nThat's what I thought. Blume's got a little more spark and vitality than you expected, doesn't he? \nMISS CROSS \nBut the aquarium was your idea. \nMax smiles and shrugs his shoulder. \nMAX \nWell, I gave it to my friend. \nMax turns and starts walking away.

Behind her down the hall, Duncan appears. He watches her, starts to move silently forward. Tracy gets the door open, then turns and sees him. Duncan stops. 
TRACY Oh, it's you! (beat) What do you want? 
DUNCAN (moving forward) ...Came to apologize. I... 
TRACY Look, I'm the one who should be sorry. I didn't want that to happen. (she sees his face; shudders) Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all right. 
Duncan half shrugs, half smiles. Tracy edges into her door- way. Duncan stands opposite her. 
DUNCAN I'm new in town. Don't know anybody... 
TRACY (uncomfortable) Where're you from? 
DUNCAN (coughs) New York. Ever been there? 
TRACY Sure. Sure I've been there. 
They look at each other. Duncan coughs again. 
DUNCAN Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone cold, unfriendly... 
Inside Tracy's apartment, the telephone rings. Tracy turns vaguely, indecisively, and goes to answer it. 
TRACY (over her shoulder) Excuse me. 
She disappears into the apartment. O.S. she picks up the ringing phone. 
TRACY (O.S.) Hello?... 
INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT 
As she sits with the telephone. 
TRACY (nervous) ...No, I just got in... I don't know if I can... Listen, I can't talk now. Can I call you back?... Okay... Goodbye. 
She hangs up the phone, stands and turns back toward the door. Duncan is standing right behind her. 
DUNCAN I'm not from New York, actually. But I'm very, very far from home. 
He sits down. 
TRACY Look, you can't come in here. 
Duncan looks at her for a moment, then looks about the apartment. 
DUNCAN (mumbling) I thought we might get some coffee. Can I buy you -- ? 
TRACY I don't think so. 
DUNCAN Someplace nearby? 
TRACY Not tonight. You'd better go. 
DUNCAN I got no place to go. 
TRACY (anxious) You can't -- 
DUNCAN Just, just a little coffee? 
TRACY Maybe tomorrow. 
DUNCAN Okay, tomorrow. When? 
TRACY I said maybe. I don't know. (beat) Listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon. I really am. All right? That was my boyfriend on the phone. He's coming over. So please leave. Now. 
Duncan doesn't move. He smiles at her. 
DUNCAN I like you. 
TRACY (her voice rising) Look, do you want me to call the cops? 
DUNCAN (standing) It's okay. It's okay.

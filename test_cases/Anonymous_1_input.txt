OXFORD I... don't know. 
SHAKESPEARE (O.S.) "Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene" 
53   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                    53 
Shakespeare and Jonson are walking along London Bridge-- the only bridge that spanned the Thames at the time, it is a street lined with multi-storied buildings-- almost like a mall. 
Shakespeare caries and reads from a manuscript of "Romeo and Juliet" 
SHAKESPEARE "From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean." (no longer reading) Incredible!! The whole bloody thing in verse?! 
JONSON (nonchalant) It's really not that difficult, if you try. 
SHAKESPEARE And have you ever tried? 
Jonson gives him a sharp look, and pauses to pick some onions from a stand. 
Shakespeare notices a BUXOM BLONDE women selling apples at the next stand.

SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) (performing for the Blonde) "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she." 
The Buxom Blonde smiles at Shakespeare seductively. 
SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) (to Jonson) I'll have little trouble parting the legs of barmaids after that performance! 
JONSON You can't play Romeo. 
Jonson leaves the stall, and continues down the street. Shakespeare hesitates, then gives the girl a dazzling smile. She smiles back, then Shakespeare runs after Jonson. 
SHAKESPEARE (to Jonson) Why not? I won't let that oaf Spencer have another go at one of my roles. No-- only Will Shakespeare can pump the life into Romeo's veins. (grins at another passing girl) And his cod piece! (beat, desperate) Ben-- Ben! I'm an actor, every inch of me, down to my very toes... I want- - no, I need, crave-- to act. I can't just idle the day by with-- 
JONSON So bloody well act like a writer! And for God's sake, keep off the stage. Writers don't have time to act.

54   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                  54 
A performance of "Romeo and Juliet". About a dozen actors are dancing. It is Act 1, Scene 5. "ROMEO", played by Spencer, is staring longingly at "Juliet". "Romeo" turns to his servant. 
"ROMEO" What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight? 
"SERVANT" I know not, sir. 
"ROMEO" O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear; beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! 
The actor playing Romeo plays to the women in the audience. And 
THE WOMEN 
respond, eye lashes twittering. 
THE WITS 
Watch in awe!   Now they're all taking swigs of ale. 
BACKSTAGE 
Shakespeare mouthing silently the lines of "Romeo". 
IN OXFORD'S BOX 
Oxford watches the dance carefully. 
"ROMEO" (CONT'D) Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

55   INT. RICHMOND PALACE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT                    55 
Twenty-eight years earlier. A dance is taking place. 
YOUNG OXFORD-- now 20 is dancing with Young Anne.     But his eyes are on: 
pg. 61 
Young Elizabeth, who is dancing with the Spanish AMBASSADOR. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH 
seems less than interested in her dancing partner.    She STARES intently back at Young Oxford. 
WIDER 
There is a natural change in the music, and all the dancers switch partners-- it's part of the dance. Young Oxford goes to Young Elizabeth, the Spanish Ambassador goes to Anne. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH AND YOUNG OXFORD 
stare into each others eyes as they dance the intricate moves. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH My lord of Oxford. 
Elizabeth smiles. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We liked your play tonight very much. Your young King Henry reminded us of you. 
OXFORD Did he? 
YOUNG ELIZABETH Rash, yet brave. A boy-- and yet a man. Fair on the eyes, fairer to the ear... 
WIDER 
Much of the Court is watching this.   They can tell there are sparks between them. 
All the dancers change partners, including Elizabeth and Oxford. A few dance moves, and Oxford once again finds himself with Elizabeth. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We are glad of your return from the continent. Two years is far too long to be without such excellent amusements.

A pause. 
KIMBALL Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? (He checks his notebook) Which was on the twentieth of December? 
BATEMAN God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes. 
He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his diary. 
BATEMAN I had a date with a girl named Veronica. 
KIMBALL Wait. That's not what I've got. 
BATEMAN What? 
KIMBALL That's not the information I've received. 
BATEMAN Well...I...Wait...What information have you received? 
KIMBALL Let's see... (He flips through his notebook) That you were with- 
BATEMAN Well, I could he wrong. 
KIMBALL Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen? 
BATEMAN (Clearly nervous and under pressure) We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's. 
Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens his briefcase to put away his notebook. 
KIMBALL Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman. 
BATEMAN Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered. 
KIMBALL Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information? 
BATEMAN Great, yes, I'd like that. 
KIMBALL And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier. 
BATEMAN Absolutely. I'm with you on that one. 
Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up. 
KIMBALL Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I just bought it on my way here. 
Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified. 
BATEMAN Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers. 
KIMBALL Not a big music fan, eh? 
BATEMAN No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me. 
KIMBALL Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations. 
BATEMAN I'll be there. 
EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before. The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a half-opened window. 
CHRISTIE I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time... 
BATEMAN Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise. 
CHRISTIE I don't think so. 
He hands her a $500 bill. 
BATEMAN Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. 
The driver's here, you'll be safe. 
Christie gets in hesitantly. 
BATEMAN Nothing like last time, promise.

INT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUS - DAY 
Ordell sits at the bar in Sam's drinking a screwdriver and watching a stripper strip. 
BARTENDER There a Ordell here? 
ORDELL That's me. 
The bartender hands him the phone. 
BARTENDER Don't talks all day. 
Ordell takes the receiver. 
INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY 
A stressed Louis drives the Toyota, calling Ordell on Ordell's tiny cellular. 
LOUIS It's Louis. 
ORDELL (now into phone) Did you get it? 
LOUIS I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you. 
ORDELL When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money? 
LOUIS I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag. 
ORDELL Melanie must be dyin' to see it. (pause) Louis. 
LOUIS That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time - 
ORDELL - Not now, pick me up. 
Louis hears the phone disconnect. 
EXT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUR - DAY 
The Toyota pulls up to the back of the bar. Ordell hops in, the car takes off. 
INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY 
Oredell in the passenger seat, bends over to the backseat, grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his lap. He looks like a kid at Christmas. 
ORDELL You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about. (pause) Hey, where's Melanie? 
LOUIS That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves. 
ORDELL So what, you left her there. 
LOUIS I shot her. 
Ordell just looks at him. 
LOUIS (CONT'D) I expect she's dead. 
Ordell still doesn't say anything... then says; 
ORDELL You shot Melanie? 
LOUIS Twice. In the parking lot. 
ORDELL Couldn't talk to her? 
LOUIS You know how she is. 
ORDELL You couldn't just hit her? 
LOUIS Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno... 
ORDELL You shot her twice? 
LOUIS Uh-huh. 
ORDELL So you're sure she's dead. 
LOUIS Pretty sure. 
ORDELL Where did you shoot her? 
LOUIS In the chest and stomach. 
ORDELL Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman. 
Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just looks inside the bag for the longest time. 
Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma. 
ORDELL (CONT'D) (quiet) Louis? 
LOUIS (not looking at him) What? 
ORDELL Where's the rest of it? 
LOUIS (looking at him) How much it there? 
ORDELL Maybe forty, maybe not that much. 
LOUIS You said five hundred and fifty! 
ORDELL (calm) So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million. 
LOUIS Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I. 
ORDELL Came outta where? 
LOUIS The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to. 
ORDELL How long was she in there? 
LOUIS Maybe a minute. She came right out. 
ORDELL Louis, You tellin' me the truth? 
LOUIS Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her. 
ORDELL Then what? 
LOUIS We went to the parking lot. 
ORDELL Where you shot her. 
LOUIS That's right. 
ORDELL You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn? 
Louis looks at Ordell; 
LOUIS (quietly) Fuck you for asking me that.

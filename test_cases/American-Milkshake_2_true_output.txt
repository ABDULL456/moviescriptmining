Haroon's Dad emerges from the house. 
HAROON'S DAD Good one, Adreseis!! 
Haroon turns. 
HAROON'S DAD I've made some grill cheeses! Come and get it! 
HAROON Sweet! Now that Mom moved out we always eat American. You wanna eat with us? 
JOLIE I do but there's something I gotta do. 
HAROON Oh yeah. That's right.   Well, good luck with it all. 
INT. HENRIETTA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Henrietta lies on the bed studying. 
Mr. Aaronson enter. 
MR. AARONSON Hey Henrietta. Jolie is here. He brought over a gift. 
HENRIETTA Oh yeah. Let him in. 
JOLIE Hey. What's up? Uh. I brought over my Super Nintendo. I thought the baby might want it. 
HENRIETTA Did Jaguar 64 finally come out? 
JOLIE No. Come on. I'm just trying to show you I actually care. 
Mr. Aaronson smiles and leaves, closing the door lightly behind him. 
Jolie hands over the Nintendo. 
JOLIE And I brought this too. 
Jolie pulls a jersey out of a paper bag. 
HENRIETTA Your practice Jersey! 
JOLIE Yeah. I'm not gonna need it anymore so. 
HENRIETTA Really? Why not? 
JOLIE I'm not playing next year. I want to focus on my studies. 
HENRIETTA Jolie. Thank you. (SMELLS IT) It smells like you. Someday little Benny will wear it. That's what I've decided to name him, Benny. 
JOLIE Oh. Wow. Well. Uh, before you name him, I was kinda thinking maybe we could discuss, uh, 
HENRIETTA What? 
JOLIE Well, (Jolie sits next to her) (MORE) 
JOLIE (CONT'D) I was also thinking maybe we could talk about the possibility of you giving up your baby for adoption? 
HENRIETTA Jolie. How could you even say that? I've wanted a family of my own, a real family, since as long as I can remember. There is no way I could ever give little Benny away. Ever. In a million years. Do you understand that? 
JOLIE Well. Yeah. I guess so. But at the same time, it just doesn't seem like the smartest thing. I've already found a really wealthy, well educated, good meaning couple who'd like to meet up with you about it. 
HENRIETTA Never. No way Jolie. End of discussion. 
JOLIE Don't you even want to think it over for a few days? I mean, look how lucky your parents are to have you. You'd be making some couple just as happy. And your child would have more opportunities. I mean you're still in High School, know what I mean? 
HENRIETTA Jolie, I can't even believe you're suggesting that? Dont you see how racist that is? 
JOLIE What? 
Jolie is silent. 
HENRIETTA Now do something to cheer me up. I am totally offended you wanted to give away my baby. 
Jolie sits in silence for a moment, pondering his situation. 
He stands up and heads to the door, demoralized. 
Then he turns and looks at Henrietta on the bed.

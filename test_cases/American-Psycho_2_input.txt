JEAN (O.S.) Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong? 
BATEMAN I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean. 
Pause. 
BATEMAN ...to the office this afternoon. 
JEAN (O.S.) Why? 
BATEMAN (Screaming) Just...say...no! 
JEAN (O.S.) What is it, Patrick? Are you alright? 
BATEMAN Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus! 
He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his jacket. 
INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY 
Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it. 
INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING 
Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, still breathing heavily. 
Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations. 
McDERMOTT Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough day at the office? 
They all laugh. 
McDERMOTT Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't get a reservation to save his life. 
Bateman sits down silently. 
McDERMOTT Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them. 
BATEMAN (On automatic) I'm not going anywhere unless we have a reservation. 
VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, faggots-just get a res. 
PRICE Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders. 
Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses. 
BATEMAN (He downs his drink) Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously. 
CARNES Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s. 
Bateman approaches, trying to act casual. 
BATEMAN Shut up, Carnes, they will not. 
Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused. 
BATEMAN So, Harold, did you get my message? 
Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs. 
CARNES Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it? 
BATEMAN (Waving smoke out of his face) Yes, naturally. 
CARNES Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich... 
Pause 
CARNES It was a pretty long message, wasn't it? 
BATEMAN What exactly do you mean? 
CARNES The message you left. 
Carnes is distracted, waving at people.

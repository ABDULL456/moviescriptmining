CHARLIE The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The board of directors, the trustees and Mr. Nolan. Do you think for one moment they're gonna let this thing just blow over? Schools go down because of things like this. They need a scapegoat. 
The door opens. All the boys except Charlie hurry to put their cigarettes out and wave the smoke away. A light comes on and Cameron enters. 
CAMERON What's going on, guys? 
CHARLIE You finked, didn't you, Cameron? 
Charlie gets up and approaches Cameron, tossing his cigarette away. 
CAMERON Finked? I didn't know what the hell you're talking about. 
CHARLIE You told Nolan everything about the club is what I'm talking about. 
CAMERON Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, there's something called an honor code at this school, all right? If a teacher asks you a question, you tell the truth or you're expelled. 
CHARLIE You little- 
Charlie lunges at Cameron but Knox and Meeks hold him back. 
MEEKS Charlie! 
CHARLIE He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, so he rattled to save himself. 
KNOX Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and you're out. 
CHARLIE I'm out anyway! 
KNOX You don't know that, not yet. 
CAMERON He's right there, Charlie. And if you guys are smart, you will do exactly what I did and cooperate. They're not after us. We're the victims. Us and Neil. 
CHARLIE What's that mean? Who are they after? 
CAMERON Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The "Captain" himself. I mean, you guys didn't really think he could avoid responsibility, did you? 
CHARLIE Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is that what they're saying? 
CAMERON Well, who else do you think, dumb ass? The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. Keating put us up to all this crap, didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, Neil would be cozied up in his room right now, studying his chemistry and dreaming of being called doctor. 
TODD That is not true, Cameron. You know that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil loved acting. 
CAMERON Believe what you want, but I say let Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives? 
Charlie lunges at Cameron again and punches him in the face. Cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull Charlie away. Cameron lifts a hand to his bloody nose. 
CAMERON You just signed your expulsion papers, Nuwanda. 
Cameron rises to his feet. 
CAMERON And if the rest of you are smart, you'll do exactly what I did. They know everything anyway. You can't save Keating, but you can save yourselves. 
Cameron walks away, closing the door behind him. 
INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY 
Todd looks out the window and watches as Hager escorts Meeks back to the dorm. Inside the room, Neil's bed has been stripped of all its bedding. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Meeks walks slowly to his room. Hager remains standing at the end of the hallway. 
HAGER Knox Overstreet. 
Knox emerges from his room and goes to joing Hager. He gives a thumbs up to Todd as he passes his door. Once he leaves with Hager, Todd goes over to Meeks' door. 
TODD Meeks? 
MEEKS Go away. I have to study. 
TODD What happened to Nuwanda? 
MEEKS Expelled. 
TODD What'd you tell 'em? 
MEEKS Nothing they didn't already know. 
HAGER (O.S.) Todd Anderson.

12. EXT. GARDEN. EVENING 
Evening is falling. At the back of the garden are a home- made pen and doghouse. Four puppies come running. Sam touches them through the chicken wire. 
ANNA You want to pet them? She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh. 
ANNA Careful. Don't step on their tiny paws. They're just babies. Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up. 
ANNA (to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next month. Brings in some money. Otherwise, Richard and I were thinking 300 a month for you and the kid... That okay? 
ALI Yeah. 
ANNA "Yeah" what? Is that too much? 
ALI It's not too much, but I don't have it. I had to pay for the train... 
ANNA So what are you going to do? 
ALI I don't know. Find a job. Whatever. 
ANNA Yeah, whatever... You think there's any work around here? You think there's any more here than there? Where has that ever been the case? When you told me you were coming down, 
I said we couldn't afford houseguests! 
ALI What should I have done with the kid? Where should I have gone? 
ANNA I have no idea, but if you stay here you have to pay your share, or else go somewhere else. As far as we're concerned, it's easy: we can't! How long were you thinking of staying? 
ALI I don't know. She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house, calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel, giggling in delight. He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special 50 moped, plastic junk, etc. Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights shining. 
13. INT. BASEMENT. NIGHT 
In the cluttered basement, Sam is rolled up in a sleeping bag arranged on a pallet and watches his father repair the antique Special 50 moped by the light of a flashlight. 
14. INT. ELECTRONIC GOODS SHOP. DAY 
Ali wanders through an electronic goods shop, pretending to be interested in cameras. Through the shop window, he can see Sam waiting outside in the sun. 
15. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY 
Suddenly, Sam sees his father run out of the shop, trying to shake a security guard hot on his tail. Sam watches them disappear into a tiny lane. Sam looks around a bit frightened. 
Farther off, in a busy shopping districtâ¦ Ali forces his way through hordes of tourists. The security guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a wall. They are both dripping with sweat and out of breath. 
SECURITY GUARD Unzip your jacket! Empty your pockets! Ali keeps his cool. 
ALI Unzip it yourself! Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges: The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off. 
16. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY 
Sam is walking along the street by the beach amid the terraces and ice-cream stores, looking for his father. Then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot where they had left it chained up. He walks toward it. A voice calls out. 
ALI Hey! Here I am! Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who is sniffling, tears in his eyes. 
ALI No need to cry. I wouldn't have left you all alone. Ali unlocks the moped. 
17. EXT. ALLEYWAY. DAY 
In a small side street, Sam watches Ali sell a camera for a few 20 Euro notes.

PARRISH How did you know? 
SUSAN Drew told me. 
PARRISH Does Drew tell you everything? 
SUSAN I hope so. 
PARRISH You like him, don't you? 
SUSAN Yeah.  I guess so. 
A moment. 
PARRISH I don't like to interfere. 
SUSAN ...Then don't. 
The helicopter CHOPS in overhead. 
SUSAN (cont'd) -- Here comes our boy now -- Shall we? 
EXT. COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING 
A BUTLER and May carry the overnight bags for the family as led by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter.  En route they pass QUINCE, 38, Allison's husband, who is perched at a portable bar with AMBROSE, the head caterer, tasting wines. 
QUINCE ...This shit's not bad. 
AMBROSE -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert. 
QUINCE (pointing to another bottle) And that? 
AMBROSE Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer. 
Ambrose takes a sip, swishes the wine in his mouth, spits it in a bucket. 
QUINCE What do you do that for? 
AMBROSE Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning. 
QUINCE 9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit. 
Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is hailed by Allison. 
ALLISON Quince!  Everybody's waiting! 
Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as DREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it, approaches Parrish and Susan. 
DREW (to Susan) Hello, Beautiful. 
SUSAN Hi. 
Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish. 
PARRISH Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out. 
DREW Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations? 
PARRISH 'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night. 
DREW A voice? 
PARRISH In my sleep. 
DREW What'd it say? 
PARRISH 'Yes'. 
DREW 'Yes' to the deal? 
PARRISH Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go. 
Quince comes running up now. 
QUINCE Hi, Bill -- 
PARRISH Good morning, Quince. 
QUINCE How're you doing--? 
PARRISH I'm doing great.  You ready? 
QUINCE I am, this is it.  B Day. 
PARRISH How's that, Quince? 
QUINCE Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants. 
ALLISON (to Quince) Honey, please. 
QUINCE Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York! 
ALLISON Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends -- 
PARRISH Not my birthday again? 
SUSAN You're only six-five once. 
PARRISH Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started. 
Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him As Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors. 
INT. ASTAR HELICOPTER - DAY 
The configuration of seats has Drew beside Parrish, in front of them Quince and Susan opposite each other in single seats. Just as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache case and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own. He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into her carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it. 
SUSAN I thought you were in a meeting--? 
PARRISH I am.  With you. 
He peers up ahead at Drew, on the telephone and gesticulat- ing intensely, right at home in the cockpit despite the CHOP of the blades and the pilot pressed up against him. 
PARRISH (cont'd) Do you love Drew?

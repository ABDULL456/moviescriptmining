WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT 
WITHERSPOON By the way, you've had the papers signed by your brother and the doctor, of course ? 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Mortimer seems surprised by the question. 
MORTIMER Oh, the doctor ? Oh, holy mackerel ! I forgot the doctor ! Mortimer takes a piece of paper from the inside pockets of his jacket and puts it on the desk. Elaine is still whining at his side. ELAINE Mortimer ! 
MORTIMER (yelling to Elaine) Please, be quiet ! Can't you see I've got to get a doctor ? (to Witherspoon on the phone) Hello ? What kind of a doctor ? A family doctor ? 
ELAINE You can take your honeymoon, your wedding ring, your taxi, your window-seat, and put them in a barrel, and push them all over Niagara Falls ! 
She walks away 
MORTIMER (to the departing Elaine) Thank you, darling. Thank you. (to Witherspoon on the phone) Oh, look, why don't you come down here anyway ? While you're getting here, I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures both. 
The front door slams violently. Mortimer turns around. 
MORTIMER Yeah. Elaine ! Elaine ! (to Witherspoon) Yeah, I'll get both signatures. Yeah, well, come right away. 
He puts the phone down. 
MORTIMER Elaine ? What's the matter with her ? 
He stands up and runs across the room to the window-seat. 
MORTIMER Oh, dear ! 
He kneels on the window-seat and looks through the open window. 
MORTIMER Elaine ! Elaine ! 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Large shot of Reverend Harper's residence. Elaine enters the front door, and slams the door behind her. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Mortimer is still looking through the open window. 
MORTIMER Elaine ! 
He enters back into the room, and sits on the window-seat. 
MORTIMER (whispering to himself) Oh, let me sit down. Let me think about this thing. Doctor, Teddy, signature... 
He looks at the seat. 
MORTIMER Hoskins ! 
He remains seated a few seconds in deep thought, then he gives a quick look outside the window, stands up and starts lifting the lid. The lid creaks. Mortimer seems very surprised by what he sees inside the seat. He opens the lid completely and let it rest on the bottom of the window. 
MORTIMER Ye gods ! There's another one ! He closes the lid and walks across the room toward the kitchen door. 
MORTIMER Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha ! Come in here ! 
ABBY (voice over from the kitchen) We're busy. 
MORTIMER No, you come in here now ! 
Abby, still in funeral clothes, enters the room through the kitchen door. 
ABBY Yes, dear, what is it ? Where's Elaine ? 
MORTIMER Wait a minute. Didn't you promise me not to let anyone in the house while I was gone ? 
ABBY Jonathan just walked in. 
MORTIMER I don't mean Jonathan ! 
ABBY And Doctor... 
MORTIMER And I don't mean Doctor Einstein ! Who is that in the window-seat ? 
ABBY We told you. Mister Hoskins. 
MORTIMER He is not Mister Hoskins ! 
He opens the window-seat wide and let the lid rest on the bottom of the window. 
MORTIMER There ! 
Abby walks to the window-seat and looks inside, surprised. 
ABBY Who can that be ? 
MORTIMER You're trying to tell me you've never seen that man before ? 
ABBY I certainly am. Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do ! It's getting so anyone thinks he can walk in this house ! 
MORTIMER Now, you look here, Aunt Abby. Don't you try to get out of this ! That's another one of your gentlemen, and you know it ! 
ABBY Mortimer, how can you say such a thing ? That man's an impostor. And if he came here to be buried in our cellar, he's mistaken. 
MORTIMER You admitted to me you put Mister Hoskins in the window- seat. 
ABBY Yes, I did. 
MORTIMER Well, this man couldn't have got the idea from Mister Hoskins ! 
ABBY Oh, no. 
MORTIMER By the way, where is Mister Hoskins ? 
Mortimer starts looking around the room. 
ABBY He must have gone to Panama. 
MORTIMER What ? You buried him ? 
ABBY No, no, not yet. He's just down there waiting for the services, poor dear. We haven't had a minute, what with Jonathan in the house. 
Mortimer suddenly realizes the corpse could be a «friend» of Jonathan. He quickly closes the lid. 
ABBY Oh, dear. We've always wanted to hold a double funeral. But I will not read services over a total stranger ! 
She walks back to the kitchen. Mortimer catches her. 
MORTIMER A total stranger. Aunt Abby, how can I believe you ? There are twelve men down there, some you admit you poisoned them !

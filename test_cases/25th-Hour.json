Look at me--- they'll eat me alive up there. Monty finally stands and walks toward the man, closer and closer until their faces are inches apart. \nMONTY \nYou need to leave me alone, friend. I told you, I'm out of business. Doyle sniffs Simon's boots, then raises his head, snout climbing the man's leg. Simon dances a half-step, trying to keep away from the pit bull without provoking him. \nSIMON \nYou worried about me narking you out? You know who I am. \nMONTY \nYou're not listening to me. I got touched. Game over. Simon blinks, tries to JLaugh, looks behind him,,,looks down at Doyle, rubs his nose with the back of his hand. \nSIMON \nFive years I've been coming to you. All right, all right, I'm leaving. There's no need to be nasty. Monty and Doyle watch the man go; they begin walking in the opposite direction. They pass the concrete chessboards, the sandboxes, and pause for a moment by a basketball court. Six TEENS play -- with little skill -- one last game before school. Monty shakes his head disdainfully, watching one player dribble at the top of the key. \nMONTY \nYou got no left. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nThe player drives right and misses an open lay-up. Monty spits and continues walking, Doyle leading the way. \nEXT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL -- LATER \nMonty looks up at the old private school, tucked away on a leafy street on the Upper East Side. Two TENTH GRADE GIRLS look at Monty as they pass by. People are always looking at Monty. Both girls take long final drags on their cigarettes before crushing them out and entering the school. \nINT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL \nMonty walks down a corridor of the school building, Doyle padding along beside him. STUDENTS, hurrying to their classes, stare at the dog and then at Monty. The bells ring and within moments the corridor is empty. Monty stops before a row of framed photographs. He examines one photograph and smiles. \nINSERT PHOTOGRAPH \nThe Campbell-Sawyer basketball team. The players stand in a semi-circle with their coaches. We move in closer on one face in particular: Monty, when he was sixteen, free and easy. We move closer still and the black-and-white face begins to blur. \nADMINISTRATOR (O.S.) \n,,..   .... Excus.e-.me-,- sir, can I help_ you? \nMonty, lost in a reverie, looks up. The ADMINISTRATOR, a tall, harried-looking woman in her mid-fifties, squints at him through her glasses. \nMONTY \nWhat? \nADMINISTRATOR \nCan I help you with something? \nMONTY \n(smiling) No, I don't think so. \nADMINISTRATOR \nThere are no dogs allowed on school grounds. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nf~\\                         MONTY                                         -^ U               Okay. ..

Monty nods and continues on his way. The administrator watches man and dog walk down the long corridor. \nINT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER CLASSROOM \nJAKOB ELINSKY stands at the blackboard, facing three rows of uninspired teenage faces. He wears a tweed jacket that seems a few sizes too large, with chalk stains on the sleeves. Jakob is the same age as Monty but he seems younger. There is something adolescent in his slouch, in the way he chews his lip. One of his students, MARY D'ANNUNZIO (17), stands at her desk, reading from a poetry textbook. Her eyes drown in pools of painted shadow, her hair is dyed black, tattooed roses garland her wrist. \nMARY \n-\u00ab=\u00b7-------\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7: .\u00b7    (reading)      - \u00b7\u00b7     --    \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \n\"Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball, And tear pur pleasures with rough strife, Through the iron gates of life.\" Jakob watches her. We don't know the Campbell-Sawyer dress code, but we can guess that she's violating it . We can also guess that Jakob is watching her a little too avidly. Her pierced navel is visible below her Donnas tee-shirt. \nMARY (CONT'D) \n(reading) \"Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run.\" Mary shrugs and sits down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJAKOB \nGood, good, excellent reading.

He's a fierce-looking ma n with a thick black beard, powerful hands, and no tolerance for incompetence. It's hard to determine his age -- anywhere from forty to sixty. Valghobek, his lieutenant, looks at first glance like an overweight suburban dad. But on closer inspection there is something absolutely mirthless in his smile, a meannes s around his eyes. He's in his late forties. Gedny, mid-thirties, Uncle Blue's lawyer, wears a shiny suit, a gold bracelet, and a deep , artificial-looking tan .

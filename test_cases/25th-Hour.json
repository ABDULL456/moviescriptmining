{"train": "THE 25th HOUR \nby \nDavid Benioff \nINDUSTRY ENTERTAINMENT \nEXT . WES T SIDE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT \no    A blac k dog sleeps on the shoulder of the highway, head between his paws , curled up next to the barricad e that separates the north and southbound lanes . \nTraffic rumbles past him: yellow cabs , blu e polic e cruisers , white limousines with tinted glass and Jersey plates . \nWe hea r the squeal of brakes. A black *65 Ford Mustang, min t condition, pulls onto the shoulder, ten yard s past the dog , and back s up . Th e dog raises its head. \nTwo me n step out of the car.          The driver , MONT Y BROGAN, mid - twenties , is pale-skinned in          the flickering light . A small silver crucifix hangs from a           silver chain around his neck ; his fingers are adorned with           silver rings . \nThe passenger , KOSTYA NOVOTNY, a hulking ma n in his late thirties , blow s his nose in his handkerchief. It's a cold night . Monty wears a camel's hai r overcoat, Kostya an old blue Soviet Navy coat . \nMONTY \nHe's alive. \nKOSTYA \n(Ukrainian accent) This dog, how do you call it? \nMONTY \nPit bull . Must have lost somebody some money . The dog stares at them and they stare at the dog . \nKOSTYA \nWhat d o w e do , Monty, w e watch hi m rot ? \n\u00b7\u00b7 ' .\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7- \u00b7 ' ? -. : \u00b7 \u00b7- \u00b7' MONTY : . \u00b7' \u00b7\u00b7 '' ' ' ;:; '' ' \nI was thinking of shooting him . \nKOSTYA \nShooting him? Ar e you sick in the head ? \nThe dog continues to stare at them impassively, his face lit by the passing headlights. The pavement by hi s paws is littered with broken glass, twisted scraps of metal , black rubber from blow n tires. \no \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMONTY \nThey just left him here to die. They threw him out the window and kept driving. A ship's horn sounds from the Hudson. \nKOSTYA \nCome, my friend, it is cold. Come, people wait for us. \nMONTY \nThey're used to waiting. Monty squats near the dog and inspects him. From this angle it is clear that the pit bull has been badly abused. One ear has been chewed to mince; his hide is scored with cigarette burns; flies crawl in his bloodied fur. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nI think maybe his hip -- The dog pounces, jaws snapping,; lunging for Monty's face. Monty stumbles backwards. The dog, too badly injured to continue the attack, remains in his crouch, growling. Monty sits on the pavement, shaking his head. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nChrist. (beat) He's got some bite left. \nKOSTYA \nI think he does not want to play with you. Come, you want police to pull over? You want police looking through your car? \nMONTY \nLook what they did to him. Used him for a fucking ashtray. Monty stands and dusts his palms on the seat of his pants. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nLet's get him in the trunk. \nKOSTYA \nWhat? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED :    (2 ) \nMONTY \nThere's a vet emergency room on the East Side. I like this guy. \nKOSTYA \nYou like him? He tries to bite your face off. Look at him, he is meat. You want some dog, I buy you.nice puppy tomorrow. Monty is not listening. He walks back to his car, opens the trunk, pulls out a soiled green army blanket. Kostya holds up his hands: stop. \nKOSTYA    (CONT'D) \nWait one minute,    please. Please stop one minute? I do not    go near pit bull. Monty? I do not go near    pit bull. Monty, carrying the army blanket, walks back toward the dog. \nMONTY \nThis is a good dog. I can see it in his eyes. He's a tough little bastard. \nKOSTYA \nSometimes I think you are very stupid man. The dog has slumped back to the pavement. His breath, comes in. shorts rasps and wheezes. But he never takes his eyes off the two men. \nMONTY \nWe wait much longer, he'll be dead. \nKOSTYA \nOne minute ago you want to shoot him. \nMONTY \nThat was a mercy thing. But he's not ready to go yet. \nKOSTYA \nYes? He told you this? Monty slowly circles behind the dog, holding the blanket the way a matador wields his cape. \n^V- ^       Doyle snarls. Simon repockets the money. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSIMON \nOkay, okay. I'm just saying, I'm not looking for a mercy pop. \nMONTY \nI'm over, man. Simon points at a line of scabs that run along his throat. \nSIMON \nCut myself shaving this morning -- four times. Can't keep my hands steady. Come on, Monty, help me out. I can't go to Harlem. Look at me--- they'll eat me alive up there. Monty finally stands and walks toward the man, closer and closer until their faces are inches apart. \nMONTY \nYou need to leave me alone, friend. I told you, I'm out of business. Doyle sniffs Simon's boots, then raises his head, snout climbing the man's leg. Simon dances a half-step, trying to keep away from the pit bull without provoking him. \nSIMON \nYou worried about me narking you out? You know who I am. \nMONTY \nYou're not listening to me. I got touched. Game over. Simon blinks, tries to JLaugh, looks behind him,,,looks down at Doyle, rubs his nose with the back of his hand. \nSIMON \nFive years I've been coming to you. All right, all right, I'm leaving. There's no need to be nasty. Monty and Doyle watch the man go; they begin walking in the opposite direction. They pass the concrete chessboards, the sandboxes, and pause for a moment by a basketball court. Six TEENS play -- with little skill -- one last game before school. Monty shakes his head disdainfully, watching one player dribble at the top of the key. \nMONTY \nYou got no left. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nThe player drives right and misses an open lay-up. Monty spits and continues walking, Doyle leading the way. \nEXT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL -- LATER \nMonty looks up at the old private school, tucked away on a leafy street on the Upper East Side. Two TENTH GRADE GIRLS look at Monty as they pass by. People are always looking at Monty. Both girls take long final drags on their cigarettes before crushing them out and entering the school. \nINT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL \nMonty walks down a corridor of the school building, Doyle padding along beside him. STUDENTS, hurrying to their classes, stare at the dog and then at Monty. The bells ring and within moments the corridor is empty. Monty stops before a row of framed photographs. He examines one photograph and smiles. \nINSERT PHOTOGRAPH \nThe Campbell-Sawyer basketball team. The players stand in a semi-circle with their coaches. We move in closer on one face in particular: Monty, when he was sixteen, free and easy. We move closer still and the black-and-white face begins to blur. \nADMINISTRATOR (O.S.) \n,,..   .... Excus.e-.me-,- sir, can I help_ you? \nMonty, lost in a reverie, looks up. The ADMINISTRATOR, a tall, harried-looking woman in her mid-fifties, squints at him through her glasses. \nMONTY \nWhat? \nADMINISTRATOR \nCan I help you with something? \nMONTY \n(smiling) No, I don't think so. \nADMINISTRATOR \nThere are no dogs allowed on school grounds. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nf~\\                         MONTY                                         -^ U               Okay. ..

The administrator bends forward and squints at the photo. \nADMINISTRATOR \nI guess you weren't, the center. \nMONTY \n, Ha ha. Starting point guard. Started on varsity from my first game, freshman year. I still hold the all-time assist record. \nADMINISTRATOR \nMm, no, Marvin Ray broke the record last                  ^V year.                                                    mm^ Monty stares at her. She shrugs. \nADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) \nI coach the girl's team. Monty turns back to the photo. \nMONTY \n\u00b7- we* Weire undefeated that\" year. \nADMINISTRATOR \nReally? \nMONTY \nUntil I got kicked off the team. After that, they fell apart. Do you know where Jakob Elinsky is? \nADMINISTRATOR \nProbably in his classroom.

Jakob turns and sees Mary staring at them. He quickly turns back to Monty , wh o is smiling at Mary. Jako b grab s the door knob. \nJAKOB \nOkay, so I'll see you later? Monty nods . \nMONTY \nTel l Frank we'll meet up after midnight . He leads Doyle away and Jakob closes the door , the n turns to look at his silent class.

He went here, too. \nMARY \nHe doesn't look like you. \nJAKOB \nActually, I have many friends who don't look like me. \nMARY \nNo, I mean, he doesn't look like someone you'd be friends with. \nJAKOB \nWe grew up together.

Don't start -- \nJAKOB \nDon't worry about everyone else. \nMARY \nVince Miskella writes a story about his grandmother dying and you give him an A? What is that, a charity A? Everyone's always writing about their grandmother dying. You know why? Not because it's so traumatic. Because it's a guaranteed A. And you're all sentimental, like, \"Oh, Vince, that was very powerful, very moving.\" No it wasn't. You didn't care, I didn't care, nobody cared. That's what grandmothers do, they die. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : (2) \nMary has worked herself into a lather and Jakob watches her admiringly. \nJAKOB \nWhat did your mother say when you go t that? \nMary stares at him, not comprehending. \nMARY \nWhat? When I got what? \nJAKOB \n(pointing at her wrist) The tattoo. \nMARY \nShe said, \"Where'd you get the mone y for that. \" \nJAKOB \nOh . And? \nMARY \nAnd what did I say or where did I get the money? \nYou were born in America, you lived in America your whole life, you've been to Puerto Rico twice, for vacation. What is that? I should get an Irish flag tattooed on my ass cause my grandparents are from there? \nNATURELLE \nYou,don!t have room on your ass for an Irish flag. Monty dips his hands into the warm water, reaches below her, grabs her butt. Naturelle shrieks and Monty laughs. \nMONTY \nBetween you and me the kids will be just right. Loud pounding on the apartment door startles them. They stare at each other. Doyle barks from the other room. Naturelle gets out of the tub, pulls on a bathrobe, and goes to answer the door. Monty waits, listening. He knows who it is. He stares out the bathroom's open window. \nC)    INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM -- STILL IN FLASHBACK \nMonty, wearing sweatpants and no shirt, walks into the living room. Four D.E.A. AGENTS, all wearing D.E.A. windbreakers and shoulder holsters, wait for him. Doyle, ears back, growls at the agents. Monty scratches Doyle's head and the dog relaxes a bit. Naturelle, panicked, stares at Monty. She's still holding the apartment door open. \nMONTY \nClose the door, baby. She closes the door. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI \nMontgomery Brogan? \nMONTY \nYeah. Brzowski flips open a badge and hands a paper to Monty, who looks it over. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI                                    ^^ \nI'm Agent Brzowksi with the Drug Enforcement Agency. We've got a warrant to search your apartment. Brzowksi walks over to the sofa and sits down. The other three agents stroll around the apartment. One looks out the window; one starts flipping through a magazine on the coffee table; one stares at a photograph on the wall. \nAGENT CUNNINGHAM \nYou take this picture? \nMONTY \nYeah. \nAGENT CUNNINGHAM \nNice picture. When one of the agents steps too close to Doyle, the dog growls and the agent jumps back. \nMONTY \nEasy, Doyle. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI                                    I) \nI don't see any tags on that dog.                         ^\"^^ \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : \no                            MONTY He's inside. He doesn't have to wear tags. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI \nHe better stay calm or I'll have the pound come get him. I've seen too many men bit by these little bastards . Monty whistles and Doyle stands and walks over to him. Monty crouches, one hand stroking Doyle's thick neck. \nNaturelle, uncomfortable wearing only the bathrobe, begins heading back to the bedroom. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) \nMs . Rosario? That's your name , right? I need you to stay right here, ma'am. \nHe winks at her. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) \nCan't have you sneaking around. Naturelle leans against the wall, looking for a sign from Monty, who gives her none. The agents don't seem to be searching very hard. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) \nHm. He stares down at the sofa he's sitting on . \nAGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT-?D) \nThis sofa is not very comfortable. Monty stares at the agent for a second and then exhales. He turns and looks carefully at Naturelle. \nAGENT CUNNINGHAM \nMaybe it's your posture. Posture's very important. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI \nNo , it's this sofa. It's very uncomfortable. It's lumpy. \nMONTY \nGet it over with. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nyj                           AGENT BRZOWSKI I just don't understand. It looks like such a nice sofa. How much did you pay for this sofa, Ms . Rosario? Brzowksi stands and looks down at the cushion. Monty is still staring at Naturelle, who meets his eye for a second and then quickly turns away. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) \nMaybe it's the padding? \nAGENT CUNNINGHAM \nCould be the padding. Brzowski picks up the center cushion, turns it in his hands, and unzips it. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI \nProbably the padding. He pulls out handfuls of white fiber filling and lets them drift to the floor. Monty and Naturelle watch. \n,                          AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) \nrsS*f              Yeah, there's something lumpy in here, v-v              Mr. Brogan. It's a good thing I found this, you know. It'll make your sofa much more comfortable to sit on. The other agents laugh. Brzowski pulls out a package the size of a bottle of wine from the cushion, a bundle of plastic wrap and masking tape. Brzowski raises his eyebrows in mock shock while the other agents poh and. cluck*        -- --,      --\u00b7 -~ -- --- \nAGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) \nMr. Brogan, I do believe you're fucked. \nEND FLASHBACK \nINT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM \nMonty sits on the sofa, running his hand over the sofa cushion. Outside it's dark and Monty hasn't turned on the lights. \nNATURELLE (O.S.) \nBaby? V_/     Monty looks up. Naturelle stands in the bathroom's doorway, wearing a bathrobe. \nWhy would she? \nKostya shrugs again. \nKOSTYA \nMaybe her aunt is illegal alien. \nMONTY \nWhat if she is? \nKOSTYA \nMaybe the Federals threaten her. Monty shakes his head and walks down the stairs. \nMONTY \n.        You're insane. She wouldn't do that. \nKOSTYA \nNo? Did you ask her? Monty--stares--up--at- Kostya for a few seconds before-walking -- away. Kostya stands at the top of the stoop. He feels something and raises his palms to the air. The snow has begun to fall. \nHe looks up into the sky. Something catches his eye -- in one of the fourth floor windows, Naturelle is staring down at him. Kostya watches her. She lets the curtain close. Kostya takes another slug from his flask. \nINT. SUBWAY STATION \nMonty waits for the 6 train. Two BOYS (12), wearing winter parkas and knit caps, crouch near the edge of the platform, pointing down at the tracks and laughing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMONTY \nWhat's down there? The boys point and Monty looks. We follow his gaze. We can't see anything at first, but then, as if our eyes were adjusting to the dark, we begin to pick out movement. A gang of large RATS crawls through the tracks, nosing through balled-up paper bags, candy wrappers and orange peels. \nBOY 1 \nThese ones, they eat rat poison like chocolate. The biggest rat of all sniffs around the base of an upright wax-paper coffee cup that sits just outside the third rail. Monty reaches into the pocket of his camel's hair coat and pulls out a handful of change. \nMONTY \nWatch this. He selects a quarter and -- with a free throw motion as smooth as Hersey Hawkins's-- tosses it into the empty cup, a ten- foot shot. The big rat, startled, hustles into the alcove below the lip of the platform. The boys, impressed, whistle. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nHere -- He offers his palmful of change. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nTake a shot at it. The boys look at each other for a moment before each takes a coin. They stare up at Monty. He nods at them. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nLet's see what you got. Boy 1 takes careful aim at the coffee cup. His shot is way off target, though -- it pings off the tile on the far side of the tunnel. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nYour release is too high. Look -- He mimics the boy's shooting motion. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : (2) \no \n^^                        MONTY (CONT'D) \nSee? You're letting go way up here, so it's floating on you. It's like -- you play basketball? \nBOY 1 \nNo. \nMONTY \nBaseball? \nBOY 1 \nNo . \nMONTY \nNo? What do you play? \nBOY 1 \nSoccer. \nMONTY \n(disgusted) Soccer? All right, forget it. (turning to the other boy) Your turn, little man . Boy 2 toes the edge of the yellow danger line and practices his motion . When he finally releases the coin, it flashes through the air and drops neatly into the cup. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nThataboy! He raises his fist and the boy taps knuckles, grinning \nBOY 1 \nYou see that! You see that! Charlie got mad skills! Charlie says nothing, just grins and hops around on one foot. \nMONTY \nMake a wish. \nCHARLIE \nI get a wish? \nMONTY               ' \nHell , yes . A shot like that deserves a wish. \nMonty and Charlie stare at the coffee cup and concentrate. \nINT . 6 TRAI N \nMont y rest s wit h hi s eye s close d a s th e trai n shudder s throug h th e tunnels . \nTRE Y (O.S.) \nMonty ?

She makes eye contact with Monty. Brzowski shuts the door. He smiles at Monty. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI \nGood looking girl you got there. Monty glares at him. Brzowski pretends to sh,iver. \nOoh, that's a scary look. Yikes. You see the look he gave me? Cunningham laughs. Both agents take seats at the table. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D) \nNaturelle Rosario. What a name. You see the body on that girl? Cunningham laughs again. \nMONTY \nYou fucking touch her -- \nAGENT BRZOWSKI \nNo, no, you've got it all wrong. She fucking touched you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : \nMonty is silent for a few seconds. When he does speak, his tone is very quiet and deliberate -- he is trying to restrain his temper. \nMONTY \nYou're lying to me . \nAGENT BRZOWSKI \nAm I? That's sweet, you really trust her . All I know is, she's walking away. We just signed her release. Bye bye , Naturelle. \nAGENT CUNNINGHAM \nShe's probably having a big party tonight. \nAGENT BRZOWSKI \nSure, why not? Big celebration. She's got that whole big apartment to herself now. \nAGENT CUNNINGHAM \nShe's a smart girl. You on the other hand... \nAGENT BRZOWSKI \nYou're supposed to be smart. Got yourself a scholarship to a fancy private school, huh? Not bad for a kid from Bensonhurst. \nAGENT CUNNINGHAM \nAnd then you get yourself thrown out for dealing.

ELEUTHERIA GREEK RESTAURANT -- NIGHT \nUNCLE BLUE, SENKA VALGHOBEK, and VICTOR GEDNY sit on the private balcony that overlooks the restaurant's mai n room. \nThe place is furnished in classic Outer Borough Greek fashion: whitewashed walls , clay-tiled floors, poster s of the Parthenon at dawn and Santorini at sunset. \nUncle Blue owns the place . He's a fierce-looking ma n with a thick black beard, powerful hands, and no tolerance for incompetence. It's hard to determine his age -- anywhere from forty to sixty. Valghobek, his lieutenant, looks at first glance like an overweight suburban dad. But on closer inspection there is something absolutely mirthless in his smile, a meannes s around his eyes. He's in his late forties. Gedny, mid-thirties, Uncle Blue's lawyer, wears a shiny suit, a gold bracelet, and a deep , artificial-looking tan . Gedny busily eats his shrimp and feta while the other two watch him. Gedny gestures toward the windows. \nGEDNY \nStarting to snow. \nUNCLE BLUE \nYou met with Brogan this morning.            \u00b7\u00b7- Uncle Blue's accent, like his age, is difficult to pi n down.

Doyle, a little confused, licks Monty' s face. \nNATURELLE (CONT'D) \nYeah, keep laughing, you fuck. I'll carve your heart out and feed it to Doyle. She continues kicking while Monty laughs and Doyle, mystified, begins to bark, and finally Naturelle starts laughing too. Monty grabs her wrist and pulls her down on top of him . She drops the knife to the side and bites Monty, hard, oh the lips. \nCUT TO : \nINT. MONTY'S KITCHEN -- PRESENT \nNaturelle, in her silver dress, stares at the carving knife.

BUG BAR -- NIGHT \nSlatter.y. and Jakob sit on bar stools. Slattery sips from a glass of whiskey; Jakob nurses a bottle of beer. The Bug Bar gets its name from the exotic insects in glass jars behind the bar. A television above the bar shows the entertainment news. A VETERAN in an army jacket practices trick shots on the pool table, JODY, the young, zaftig bartender, runs a rag over the bartop. \nJODY \nHow you doing, Frank? You want another one? \nYou don't have to come! I was just saying. Monty raises his glass and Slattery and Jakob grab their glasses and raise them too . \nMONTY \nFuck Sunday. He drinks. Slattery and Jakob hesitate and then follow suit . \nEXT . VELVET -- NIGHT \nMonty steps out of a taxi, followed by Slattery and Jakob . A roiling MOB occupies half the block, crowding in front of the entrance to the dance club . Most are teenagers. They clot together in groups of fours and fives, smoking cigarettes and stomping their feet to keep warm. Almost none are dressed for the snow. \nMONTY \nThe whole city came out to say goodbye . \nSLATTERY \n\u00abJto-u'^ve\u00bbjgot a lot of yojxng _f an.s.

KHARI GREENE , a pillar of a ma n wearing the exact same camel's hair coat as Monty, stands by the door, checking names off a clipboard. \nTwo pale scars run in parallel lines down Khari's left cheek. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nNice coat , you bastard.

Mary opens her mouth and speaks, but we might not be able to hear it over the music. \nMARY \nTruth. \nINT. VELVET VIP ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nMonty leads Jakob and Mary into the VIP room. Naturelle is already there, speaking with Slattery. The walls of the VIP room are covered with crushed red velvet. The couches are upholstered in red velvet, the small bar in the corner is draped with red velvet, the carpet is red faux velvet. ----^   DJ Dusk's music pours from speakers bolted into the corners. s His beats are impossible to sit still for, incorporating elements of bossa nova, techno, hip hop, and jazz. Slattery has a hard time keeping his eyes off Naturelle. His gaze tends to slide her way, and his desire for her is apparent to everyone. Naturelle smiles when she sees Monty and goes to him. She looks beautiful in-the silver dr.ess_...-_Sh .hugs him. Monty e stands awkwardly in her embrace. When she realizes he's not returning the hug, she quickly releases him. He's watching her carefully. She sees Jakob and smiles at him. \nNATURELLE \nHey, Jake. She hugs Jakob.

Are. you somebody famous? \nMONTY \nDo us a favor, D'Annunzio. Don't talk too much . Mary grins, tears off her fake fur coat, and hides it underneath a sofa. She wears a white tank-top with Tweety Bird emblazoned on the front. Tweety Bird looks scared. \nDAPHNE, a young waitress in a green dress , comes over with a tray of champagne flutes. Naturelle kisses Daphne on the cheek and the two women exchange greetings. Everyone takes a glass. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \n\u00b7-\"\"    '    (raising his glass~) Champagne for my real friends, real pain for my sham friends. Everyone takes a sip except for Mary, who guzzles hers in one giant gulp, then belches and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. Jakob stares at her, horrified. \nMARY \nAnyone want to go dance? \nNaturelle glances at Monty. \nMONTY \nDo what you want to do . \nJakob and Slattery hear the coldness in Monty's voice and are surprised by it . \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2)                          ~ \"\"\"           , ^TM <----. \nMary grabs Naturelle's hand and leads her out the door. \nSLATTERY \n(to Daphne) You have any whiskey? \nDAPHNE \nWhat kind do you want?

He was lying there off the highway when I found him, waiting to die. He knew he was going to die. And he didn't make a sound. The best thing I ever did, my whole life, was rescue that black little son-of-a-bitch. Every day he's had since then is because of me . Every time he runs through the park, that's me .

(beat) I'm not going to let the pound have him. Doyle's the ugliest fucking dog in the five boroughs. Who's gonna adopt him? And I'm telling you now, I will not let a vet stick a needle in him and end him. I saved his life, right? I'm responsible for him. I didn't go through all that just so some vet can put hi m to sleep. If it comes to that, I'll do it myself. I'll put a bullet in his ear tonight. So I'm asking you, Jake -- for me , as a favor for me , and it's a big favor but I'm asking you -- will you take him? Will you take him home with you? Jakob is quiet, rubbing his palms over the red velvet sofa cushions. \nJAKOB \nYou know what? It would be an honor. \nMONTY \nI was hoping you'd say that. I really was. \nJAKOB \nAfter that speech, Jesus Christ, how could I refuse? Slattery returns with a glass of whiskey. He sits next to his friends and sighs. \nSLATTERY \nThere's some talent here tonight. \nMonty raps Slattery's knee. \nMONTY \nWhat do you think, Jake's girl's looking pretty good, huh? \nSLATTERY \nWho, the little one? Who is she? \nJAKOB \nShe's my student. MY STUDENT. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED': (6) \nThe lights go off. The room is completely dark. \nWhen the lights come on again, a few seconds later, Monty is crouching in front of the sofa, his .40 caliber automatic in his hand . \nKostya stands just inside the doorway of the room, hands on the light switch. \nKOSTYA \nThe party begins without me ? \nMONTY \nI should have shot you, you fat Russian fuck. Kostya ambles over to the sofa, wagging his finger. \nKOSTYA \nUkrainian. Fat Ukrainian fuck. \nHe bea r hugs Monty and kisses both his cheeks . \nKOSTYA (CONT'D) \nMontgomery, my friend!

When it becomes obvious that Kostya will not provide the rest -- \nMONTY \nWhy is it funny I should say that? \nKOSTYA \nIt was funny, what you said. Monty looks at Slattery for a second. \nMONTY \nWait, when you say, \"Funny you should say that,\" it's like saying, \"That reminds me of this other funny story.\" \nKOSTYA \nNo , no , I am saying what you say was funny. \"Funny you should say that. \" You see? It was funny, the thing you said. \nNobody speaks for a moment. \nYeah. \nHOODLUM 2 \nNothing but a catnap. Be good, brother. \nThe hoods nod at Slattery and walk away.

VELVET VIP ROOM -- LATER \nThe room is beginning to crowd with Monty's friends and acquaintances. Jakob sits alone on the sofa, sipping champagne. He clearly recognizes no one . The men speak loudly, holding their- champagne flutes in ringed fists. Lean women stand in clusters, heads bowed together. We hear snippets of banter in four different languages. \nJakob dips his head against the sofa's velvet armrest. He's clearly exhausted. He begins slipping into sleep. \nMary walks into the room. The men standing nearby turn to look at her, then whisper to each other and laugh. Mary sees Jakob curled up on the sofa and dances over to him. \nShe pulls off his Yankees cap and puts it on her own head, where it sits, crookedly. She climbs on top of him, her knees straddling his chest, and bends close to whisper in his ear. \nMARY \nJakey... Jakey... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED,: \nO     She runs her fingernail down his side. Jakob, half-sleeping, smiles and caresses her hand. Then his eyes pop open. He jerks upright and Mary slides off him. \nJAKOB \nWhoa, what are you doing? What are you doing? Mary, now standing and slightly swaying, laughs. \nMARY \nDon't panic. Nobody here gives a shit. \nJAKOB \nI give a shit. Do you know what happens if somebody sees me -- us -- like that? Mary sits on the far side of the sofa, knees primly clasped together, exaggerating the role of good girl. \nMARY \nBeg your pardon, Mr. Elinsky. \nJAKOB \nAre you drunk?

He turns and rams through the bathroom door . \nINT . VELVE T VI P ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nHe shoves past cigar smokers and dancing women . He runs from the VI P room. The partiers watch him go and then turn to look at the bathroom, a drop of blue in the overwhelming redness of the VIP room. Mar y stands in the blue light, still looking at the floor . \nINT. WHITE ROOM -- LATER \nThe Whit e Room got its name for obvious reasons . Everythin g is white : the shag carpet, the walls , the overstuffed furniture. Monty sits on a large whit e bea n bag in a corner of the room. He holds a champagne bottle in one hand, and takes occasional sips .

CARL SCHURZ PARK PLAYGROUND -- AFTERNOON \nSpringtime. Monty sits on a park bench. This is several years ago , and he looks younger, less exhausted. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : \nHe is watching two high school girls on the swings. One blonde -- LINDSAY JAMISON -- and one brunette -- a younger Naturelle . Both girls wear the uniform of their private school: white blouses embroidered with the school's initials and green plaid skirts over black tights. Both girls are smoking. But while Lindsay keeps the cigarette clenched in one hand as she swings higher, Naturelle continues taking reckless drags., the crook of her elbow holding the chain lightly as she soars skyward. Monty stands and approaches the swings. The girls pretend not to notice him. \nMONTY \nHey! The girls keep swinging. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nCould I bum a smoke? \nNATURELLE \nWhat? \nMONTY \nA smoke. \nNATURELLE \nThis is my last one . Lindsay brakes with her feet and stares at Monty . \nLINDSAY \nI've met you before, haven't I? Monty nods slowly. It's obvious he doesn't recognize her , but he doesn't want to be rude. \nMONTY \nYeah, you look familiar. Naturelle has stopped swinging now. Lindsay jumps off he r swing. \nLINDSAY \nI know wh o you are . Come on , Nat , we've got practice. \nMONTY \nYou know wh o I am? Who am I? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLindsay picks up her bookbag and strides quickly away, looking back once or twice to see if Naturelle is following. Naturelle is not following. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nSo you're Natalie? \nNATURELLE \nNaturelle. \nMONTY \nReally? Naturelle. I like that. Naturelle. So what's your friend's problem? \nNATURELLE \nYou're the one that got thrown out of Campbell-Sawyer, right? \nMONTY \nYeah, well, lots of people got thrown out of Campbell-Sawyer. How come you didn't follow Blondie to practice? \nNATURELLE \nI want to finish my cigarette. He smiles and sits on the swing next to her. He tries swinging a little. \nMONTY \nI never really got the hang of these things. \n- \u00b7-- \" \" NATURELLE  -          --       -- \nIt's all in the legs. She starts swinging again and he watches her, her long black hair falling beneath her, her legs straight and then bent, straight and then bent. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE ROOM \nMonty's eyes are still closed. Now he opens them. His hands are in Marguerite's hair, but now they drop by his side. Finally he taps Marguerite on the shoulders. She backs away from him, looking up at his face for a moment before blinking and licking her lips. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMONTY \nSLATTERY \nWe've got to wait for Monty. What's the matter? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : (3) \nJAKOB \nI kissed her. \nSLATTERY \nWho? \nJAKOB \nMary D'Annunzio. I kissed her . \nSlattery grins . \nSLATTERY \nYeah? \nJAKOB \nI kissed my student. My seventeen year old high school student. (beat) They'll fire me . \nSLATTERY \nJake. \nJAKOB \nYeah? Slattery hands him the glass of whiskey. \nSLATTERY \nHave a drink. \nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY -- LATER \nMonty and Kostya walk slowly down the corridor that leads to the manager's office. \n- -\u00b7\u00b7  KOSTYA \nSo? You like her? \nMONTY \nShe's very nice. \nKOSTYA \nDoes she have three teeth? Eh ? No , I think she has many teeth. I think you like her. \nMONTY \nI said so, didn't I? \nKOSTYA \no Very nice . \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n0\u00b7^ They stop outside the office and knock on the steel-plated door. MUSTAFAYEV, a balding man smoking a cigarette, opens the door and closes it behind him. He nods. Monty and Kostya pull out their guns and hand them to him. Checking the safeties, he shoves the guns under his belt and, cigarette clenched between his teeth, carefully pats both men down. When Mustafayev finishes searching them he raps on the door and it opens again. He gestures, and Monty and Kostya enter. \nINT. VELVET MANAGER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS \nMustafayev follows them inside, hands their guns to one of the ZAKHAROV twins, and goes back outside, closing the door. The twins are Russian redheads who speak very little English. Their faces are blunted and pitiless. Uncle Blue sits behind Volandes' desk, reading the paper. Valghobek sits on a corner of the desk. The twin with the guns places them carefully in front of \"     Uncle Blue, then returns to stand by his brother, both of them standing behind Monty and Kostya. DJ Dusk's music can barely be heard down here, the thump of bass and drum sounding like distant bombshells. Uncle Blue folds his paper neatly and sets it aside. \nUNCLE BLUE \nMontgomery. How is the party? \nMONTY \nIt's all right. Thanks for setting it up. \nUNCLE BLUE \nThe first time I went to prison I was fourteen years old, a skinny little boy. Very afraid. By the time I came out I had my beard. I was a grown man. I went back to my hometown, I found my mother, I kissed her. And she screamed. (smiling) She did not recognize me . I have been in three different prisons, Montgomery, in three different countries. You know what I learned? Monty shakes his head and waits. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \no                        UNCLE BLUE (COM\" D) I learned that prison is not a good place to be . \nKOSTYA \n(laughing) I knew that before I went. \nVALGHOBEK \nNobody's talking to you. Keep your mouth shut. \nUNCLE BLUE \nSeven years is a long time. Some men would do anything to avoid seven years in prison. Monty waits. \nVALGHOBEK \nYour father's a hardworking man . Where's his bar? In Bay Ridge? 86th Street and 6th Avenue, am I right? \nMONTY \nYes . \nVALGHOBEK \nAt least he has a short commute. He can practically walk to work. Where does he live, 17th Avenue? And what was the cross- street? 81st? 8002 17th Avenue. Is that right? The first floor. That must be noisy, living on the first floor. But he doesn't walk to work, does he? He drives. -A 1987 Honda. Should-I tell you how many miles he has on the car? Monty stares at the floor. \nUNCLE BLUE \nYour father, I like your father. A hard- working man. He has had bad luck, some very bad luck. Everyone in the neighborhood loved your mother. You remember her, Senka? \nVALGHOBEK \nSure. She was a beautiful woman. A real sweetheart. \nQ \n(CONTINUED )     f \nCONTINUED: (5) \nMonty flicks off the safety and presses the muzzle against Kostya's skull. Everyone in the room is quiet, watching. The only sound is DJ Dusk's mix, an accelerating industrial heartbeat. \nVALGHOBEK \nDo it. Kostya weeps, softly, his big body shuddering. Uncle Blue, face impassive behind his heavy beard, watches carefully. \nZAKHAROV \nHe is cockroach. Kill him. Monty's face is very close to Kostya's. \nMONTY \n(quietly) You were my friend. f=*5                        KOSTYA ^                 Monty -- Monty closes his eyes. When he opens his eyes, he flicks the safety back on. He stands. He tosses the gun to Uncle Blue, who catches it and frowns. \n_   MONTY, \nIt doesn't matter to me . Not a goddamn thing matters to me , except this: if you hurt my father, I'll kill you both. The Zakharov twins grab Monty and hold him. Monty doesn't struggle; he and Uncle Blue stare at each other. Uncle Blue drums the desktop with his fingers. Everyone waits. A glass of water on the table trembles from the distant bass. Finally Uncle Blue nods at Valghobek, who opens the office door. The twins release Monty. Everyone (except for Kostya, who is face down on the floor) watches him. \no V'     Monty walks out of the room, never looking back. \nEXT. 14TH STREET -- LATER \nMonty trudges down the sidewalk, followed by Slattery and Jakob. The snow continues to fall, and lies thickly drifted on the crookedly-parked cars, on the parking meters, on the spears of the church gate they pass. They reach the Union Square subway station and walk down the stairs, disappearing from our view. \nCLOSE ON FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW \nWe slowly follow their path backward. In the yellow shine of the streetlights the footprints fill with snow, until finally (the camera still moving backward) they disappear. \nINT. UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION \nMonty, Frank, and Jakob sit with their backs against the \"\"'corrugated shutters of a closed newspaper stand. An OLD MAN,    wearing   a garbage bag with a hole cut out for his head, leans    against   a blue I-beam that helps support the ceiling. He    holds a   small radio to his ear; we can hear fragments of    Puerto   Rican Jibaro music. Jakob chews on his fingernails. He cranes his neck to look down the subway tunnel -- still no train in sight. He looks at Monty. \nJAKOB \nWhat time is it? But Monty is jnot present, he is elsewhere, lost in whatever feveFie occuples\"\"his mind. Slattery's eyes are clo~sed;-he- seems to be sleeping. \nJAKOB {CONT'D) \nMonty? Monty looks up, dazed. \nMONTY \nWhat? \nJAKOB \nDo you know what time it is? Another long pause. \nMONTY \nIt's getting late. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED:                              .   -     - -*.\u00ab.-., ,..-, \nThe lights of the train come around the bend in the tunnel. \nINT. 4 TRAIN -- LATER \nThe three men sit side by side as the train shudders through the darkness. Slattery seems to be sleeping again. Jakob stares at his reflected face in the far window. Monty pulls out his wallet and finds the photograph that his father gave him earlier in the night. \nINSERT PHOTO \nMonty in his fireman's helmet, standing before his parents. \nEXT. MONTY'S BUILDING -- NIGHT \nMonty, Slattery and Jakob wade through the snow to the stoop steps. \nINT. MONTY'S BUILDING \nThey climb the narrow staircase, their footfalls echoing off the tiled walls. \nINT. MONTY'S APARTMENT                                                ,-~^ \nThey enter the apartment. Doyle is excited to see them; he             - pants and spins in little circles, sniffing at their boots. Jakob and Slattery fall onto the sofa and lie there like corpses. Monty opens the bedroom door, steps inside, and closes it behind him. \nINT- MONTY'S BEDROOM \nNaturelle sleeps on her side, facing the window. Monty kneels beside her and takes her hand. Her eyes open. She smiles for a second and then quickly sits up. \nNATURELLE \nWhat time is it? Both of them turn to look at the digital clock on the nightstand. \nMONTY \nI've got an hour left. Listen -- Naturelle waits as Monty stares down at the bed.                      ^J \n(CONTINUED) \nIOO, \nCONTINUED:             , \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nI was wrong. About you, about -- She runs her hand through his hair. \nNATURELLE \nIt doesn't matter right now. \nMONTY \nIt matters to me. (beat) I don't want you to hate me. \nNATURELLE \nHow could I ever hate you? \nMONTY \nJesus, Nat, I blew it. I really blew it. He stands. \nNATURELLE \nStay with me, baby. We have another hour. \nMONTY \nThere's one last thing I gotta do. Naturelle doesn't like the sound of this remark. She leans forward and takes his wrist. \nMONTY \nYou think I don't see you staring at her all the time? You've wanted to fuck her for years. He shoves Slattery hard. Slattery's eyes narrow for a moment, but he shakes his head. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : (3) \nSLATTERY \nAll right. Al l right. \nHe turns stiffly and walks away. \n'                    JAKOB \nCome on. Come on , Monty, what are you doing? Tell him you're kidding. Monty pivots and punches Jakob hard on the cheek, the crack of gloved knuckle on bone echoing on the empty esplanade. Jakob falls back against the balustrade, clutching his face. \nJAKOB (CONT'D) \nMonty I \nMonty steps closer and punches Jakob again, this time in the gut, and Jakob sinks to his knees, gasping. He covers his face with his hands, to protect himself. Slattery tackles Monty, pinning him to the ground. For a moment everything is still. Doyle, leashed to the baluster, whines, unsure if his master is playing or fighting. Jakob, stunned by the violence, watches. Slattery stares at Monty and Monty stares back . All :of them in the snow, their breath coiling and rising into the sky. Finally Slattery looks away, looks past the East River , past Queens. He clenches his eyes shut. When he opens them, we see the first tears forming. Slattery grabs Monty's throat with his left hand and punches him in the face with his right, again and again and again. Doyle howls. He tries to jump on Slattery bu t the leash keeps yanking him back. He strains forward, fangs bared , bu t his master is three feet too far. \nJakob touches his cheek and examines his fingers: no blood. \nDoyle, barking madly, keeps jumping for Slattery, keeps being yanked back by the leash. \nJakob grabs hold of the balustrade and pulls himsel f to his feet. \nJAKOB (CONT'D) \nFrank... Frank! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : (4) \nThe bloo d puddles by Monty's head, melting through the snow and steaming in the air. Slattery, lost in hi s anger , his frustration, continues swinging. \nJakob stumbles over to Slattery and pushes him. \nJAKOB (CONT'D) \nStop! \nSlattery looks up , his face wet with tears , a webbin g of saliva between his lips . \nJAKOB (CONT'D) \nOkay. Enough. \nJakob grabs the bi g man under the armpits and help s hi m rise . Slattery looks down at Monty, who is not moving . \nSLATTERY \nOh Jesus . Jakob crouches and turns Monty onto his stomach . Monty coughs, a thick ribbon of blood falling from hi s mouth . Jakob scoops up a handful of snow and begins gentl y pressing it to Monty's brutalized face. Doyle continues to bark, the collar digging into his throat as he struggles to reach his master. Slattery watches , speechless, his bloodied hand s by his side. Finally Monty shakes his head clear of the snow and begins crawling forward. \nHold still for a minute. Hold still . When Monty tries to stand his legs collapse beneat h him. Jakob wraps his arms around him before he falls an d lowers him to the snow. \nJAKOB (CONT'D) \nDon't try to move yet. \nMonty pushes himsel f off the ground again and thi s time manages to keep hi s balance, though he sways lik e a drunk. \nMONTY \n(slurring) It's okay . \nCONTINUED : <5) \nBlood leaks from his nose, from his mouth, from a deep gash bisecting one eyebrow. The entire left side of his face is bright red, already swelling. \nSlattery looks at him and moans , sits down heavily in the snow, his chin tucked against his chest, his right hand, slick with blood, covering his face. \nSLATTERY \nOh Jesus. \nJAKOB \nHospital.. We need to take you to the hospital. \nMONTY \nNo . He staggers toward them. Doyle is mewling now, stomping his paws, confused. Monty bends down unsteadily and scratches behind the dog's ear. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \n(to Doyle) Be a good boy. He walks over to Slattery, wh o sits in the snow, sobbing. Monty leans over and kisses his forehead. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nI'm sorry. Slattery rocks back and forth, hands over his face, his forehead marked with blood. Monty turns to Jakob and touches his shoulder. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nI'm sorry, Jake. \nJakob is stunned by what's happened in the last few minutes . He has no idea what to say. \nJAKOB \nOkay. \nMONTY \nTake care of my dog. \nHe grabs his coat from the park bench and walks away from them. \nEXT. MONTY' S BUILDING -- DAWN                                     ( \nNaturelle, in her down parka, sits on the stoop steps. She sees him when he's a block away, and we see him from that distance, limping through the snow. Naturelle stands and breathes in deeply. She starts walking toward him but stops after a few steps. She can see his face now. His eyes are so badly swollen that he doesn't notice her until he's almost upon her. When he does see her he smiles, and Naturelle has to look away for a moment. He tries to say something but chokes, leans over, hands on his knees, and spits up blood. Naturelle takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps. \nINT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM \nHe sits on the sofa while Naturelle dabs at his face with a wet washcloth. A bowl of soapy water sits beside her on the coffee table. When she wrings the washcloth above the bowl, drops of blood       ,\"***S \nfall into the water and bloom.                                      W-- / \nMONTY \nI don't want you to visit. His voice is rough and slurred, his split lip impeding his diction. She opens a bottle of rubbing alcohol, wets a cotton ball, presses the cottpn lightly against the gash in his forehead.       -- He shudders, his fingers gripping the edges of the sofa cushions. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nOkay? \nShe grabs him and holds him very hard, clutching him, sobbing into his neck. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nI'm sorry for everything. \nNATURELLE \nNo . . . \nMONTY \nFo r everything . \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nHe kisses her again and releases her, walks out the apartment door and closes it behind him. \nINT. HALLWAY \nMonty unknots the plastic bag and dumps the ice down the stairwell. The cubes glitter and disappear before clattering on the linoleum three floors below. \nEXT. MONTY'S BUILDING \nMr. Brogan's car is double-parked. The roof of the old Honda is crowned with snow but the windshield and rear window have been swept clean. \nINT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA \nMr. Brogan opens the passenger door and Monty eases carefully into the seat, then leans over to unlock the driver's door. After Mr. Brogan starts the engine, they wait for a moment for the windows to defrost. \nMR. BROGAN \nFDR is closed. I figured we'd go up First, take the Triborough, catch 87 up to Route 17, and then 211 takes us right into Otisville. Easy drive, except for the snow. Monty says nothing, and Mr. Brogan studies his savaged face. \nMR. BROGAN (CONT'D) \nJesus, look what they did to you. I'll tell you what, Monty, you're gonna be okay. It looks bad now, I know it, but when all the swelling goes down it's -          \u00b7 - gonna be okayr     ~ ~\"    \u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7-\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7 \n(beat) They sure gave you a licking, though. How many were there? \nMONTY \nI don't know, Dad. A bunch of them. \nMR. BROGAN \nWell, give it a month and you'll be better looking than ever. A fire truck rolls slowly past, chains on its massive tires. Monty and his father sit in silence, letting the engine warm. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMONTY \nYou were right, Dad. It wasn't Naturelle. Mr. Brogan shifts into drive. \nMR. BROGAN \nOf course it wasn't Naturelle. \nEXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE -- DAWN \nSlattery sits on a park bench overlooking the river. It's the same bench Monty sat on the day before. Slattery is alone on the snow-covered esplanade. His knuckles are covered with dried blood. His forehead is marked with blood. He watches the sun rise over Queens. \nEXT. EAST END AVENUE -- DAWN \nJakob and Doyle walk south along the western edge of Carl Schurz Park. A SKIER, an attractive young woman in her mid- twenties, schusses toward them on cross-country skis. She smiles at Jakob as she passes. \nSKIER \nCool dog. \nJAKOB \nThanks. He turns and watches her glide down the hill toward 86th Street. He looks down: at Doyle. Doyle looks-iap- at ~hifff. TM   - \nJAKOB (CONT'D) \nCool dog. Jakob shakes his head and smiles, and they continue walking south. \nINT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA -- MORNING \nThey drive up First Avenue. Monty looks out the window and watches the city roll by. It's his last look for a long time, and he wants to remember everything. A WOMAN wearing a man's overcoat sprinkles salt in front of a shuttered butcher shop. Two YOUNG BOYS drag their sleds behind them, huffing and puffing with exaggerated fatigue. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA NEWSPAPER VENDOR sits on a blue milk crate, sipping coffee from a paper cup, while his CURLY-HAIRED SON snaps icicles from the kiosk's eaves. A POLICE OFFICER, hands on his hips, stares under the opened hood of his cruiser, while his PARTNER leans against the driver's-side door and laughs into his walkie-talkie. At a red light, Monty looks up at the city bus idling noisily alongside them. A LITTLE BOY in the backseat waves. Monty waves back. The boy points at his window: letters have been finger-drawn on the frosted glass. T-O-M. Monty smiles as well as he can and draws his own name on his own frosted window: M-O-N- Before he can cross the T the bus pulls away. They drive north. \nMONTY \nI always thought I'd make you proud of me . M r . Brogan turns to look at Monty and then turns back to the road. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nI pictured it, you know? I pictured you sitting at the bar with all your friends, poker night, and you'd say, \"Did I tell you what my boy's been up to?\" And your friends would be like, \"Goddamnit, _ Brogan,,_all you ever talk about-is your     ,,...      _, __,, _ boy.\" \nMR.

They raised your limit a week ago, and you're already maxing out. \nSLATTERY \nI'm telling you, we're in for a low number. One-forty, maybe one-thirty-five. \nLICHTER \nCut your stake in half,    all right? You've been doing a great job,    everyone knows that, but I'm still you   r boss and I'm telling you: sell those    contracts. Lichter grips Slattery's shoulder for a moment and then walks toward his office (a real office, with walls and a door) , exchanging hellos with other traders on the floor. PHELAN, fresh from college, walks down the row, handing fax sheets to all the traders. He hands a sheet to Slattery, wh o looks-at--it briefly before crumpling it .         ........ \nPHELAN \nSollie's looking for a high number.

Marcuse sits down again, disappearing behind the partition. Slattery glowers at his desk. He picks up his phon e and holds the receiver to his ear, never dialing a number. Lichter calls to Slattery from his office door. \nLICHTER \nSlattery! We're good? Slattery nods and gives a thumbs up. As soon as Lichter returns to his office, Slattery hangs up the phone .

Every monitor in the room flashes the same number. Slattery stares at his computer screen. There it is again, displayed prominently in the largest window: 138, 112. Slattery raises his eyebrows. He juggles the crumpled fax sheet a few times and then tosses it over the partition, where Marcuse is sitting. \nMARCUSE (O.S.) \nFuck you, Slattery. Slattery grins and leans back in his chair, hands behind his head. \nEXT. MONTY'S BUILDING -- LATE AFTERNOON \nA four-story walk-up on a quiet street in Yorkville. NATURELLE ROSARIO sits on the stoop steps, reading a book. Naturelle, in her early twenties, has the lean body of a runner. It's cold outside but she doesn't seem to mind. When she sees Monty coming she closes the book and stands. \nNATURELLE \nHow long have you guys been walking? I woke up at seven and you were already gone.                             _           _ Monty, digging in his pocket for his keys, kisses her for an answer. Naturelle closes her eyes and tries to embrace him but Monty abruptly ends the kiss and climbs the stairs. Doyle wags the stump of his tail. \nNATURELLE (CONT'D) \nHow you doing, Mr. Doyle? She bends down to scratch him behind his mangled ear. \nMONTY \nWhy you waiting down here? \n,            ' NATURELLE \nI had my book. It was a beautiful day. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nc     Monty smiles. \nMONTY \nOf course it was a beautiful day. He holds the door open for her and Doyle. \nINT. MONTY'S APARTMENT \nMonty closes the apartment door behind Naturelle and Doyle, then locks it. There are five locks and a heavy steel deadbolt. Despite the ominous security, it's a nice one-bedroom apartment, with hardwood floors and tall windows facing the brownstones across the street. Black-and-white photographs line the walls: shots of the Manhattan skyline, of Bensonhurst, of Doyle. The largest photo, hanging above the sofa, is of Brogan's Bar. Doyle curls up next to the radiator and quickly falls asleep. Monty sits on the sofa and flicks on the television with the remote. \nWEATHERMAN \nThe first major storm of winter is heading our way -- Monty turns off the television. He stares at the dead screen. Naturelle comes out of the kitchen carrying a jar of honey and a spoon. She hands the jar to Monty, who opens it for her. She sits \u00b7 beside him and begins eating\" the honey, watching him. He sees her watching. \nMONTY \nWhat? \nNATURELLE \nWhat are you thinking about? \nMONTY \nWhat am I thinking about? He leans forward and unclips a hand-tooled leather holster from the back of his belt. A \"B\" for Brogan is tooled into the leather, stylized like the old Brooklyn Dodgers' logo. A .40 caliber automatic, squat and black, rests in the holster. Monty drops the holster onto the coffee table and runs his fingers over the B. Naturelle stares at the gun. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nI'm thinking I want to be like that girl from the X-Men, the one who can walk through walls. He's still tracing the holster's \"B \" with his fingertips. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nAnd if I can't do that, if I can't figure out how to walk through walls, I'm thinking one shot through the roof of the mouth, boom, problem solved. Naturelle hits him on the shoulder. \nNATURELLE \nDon't joke about that. \nMONTY \nYou think I'm joking? \nNATURELLE \nSo what are we doing tonight? Before you shoot yourself. Monty reclines, arms spread wide and resting on the sofa's back cushions. \nMONTY \nUncle Blue's throwing me a party at Velvet. \nNATURELLE \nI thought it was over with him. \n...MONTY. --                -     .-- \nAlmost. He watches her eat another spoonful of raw honey. \nMONTY (CONT'D) \nThat's a nasty habit you have. She leans forward and kisses him on the lips. \nNATURELLE \nCome take a bath with me. \nMONTY \nNot right now. She caresses his jaw but Monty is distant, his mind                   J elsewhere.                                                         ^--^ \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \no    She sets the honey jar on the table and walks out of the living room. Monty listens to her in the bathroom, drawing the bathwater. He listens to the sound of running water. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MONTY'S BATHROOM -- SIX MONTHS AGO \nNaturelle sits on Monty's lap in the narrow bathtub. He's massaging her shoulders. Music plays from a radio on the windowsill. She is laughing at something he just said. He leans closer and kisses the back of her neck, behind her ears. She stretches back, lifting one leg out of the bath. He runs his hand down her thigh and then stops, looking at the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on her ankle. She follows his gaze to the tattoo and then groans. \nNATURELLE \nNot this again. \nMONTY \n", "test2_input": "You think I have time for guitar lessons?

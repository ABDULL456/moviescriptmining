{"test1_input": "JONS Why do you paint such nonsense? \nPAINTER I thought it would serve to remind people that they must die. \nJONS Well, it's not going to make them feel any happier. \nPAINTER Why should one always make people happy? It might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while. \nJONS Then they'll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting. \nPAINTER Oh, they'll look. A skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman. \nJONS If you do scare them ... \nPAINTER They'll think. \nJONS And if they think ... \nPAINTER They'll become still more scared. \nJONS And then they'll run right into the arms of the priests. \nPAINTER That's not my business. \nJONS You're only painting your Dance of Death. \nPAINTER I'm only painting things as they are. Everyone else can do as he likes. \nJONS Just think how some people will curse you. \nPAINTER Maybe. But then I'll paint something amusing for them to look at. I have to make a living -- at least until the plague takes me. \nJONS The plague. That sounds horrible. \nPAINTER You should see the boils on a diseased man's throat. You should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings -- like the man I've painted over there. \nThe PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in the grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain. \nJONS That looks terrible. \nPAINTER It certainly does. He tries to rip out the boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere. Does that scare you? \nJONS Scare? Me? You don't know me. What are the horrors you've painted over there? \n", "test1_true": "JONS Do they really whip themselves? \nPAINTER Yes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a ditch and hide when they pass by. \nJONS Do you have any brandy? I've been drinking water all day and it's made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert. \nPAINTER I think I frightened you after all. \nJONS sits down with the PAINTER, who produces a jug of brandy. \nThe KNIGHT is kneeling before a small altar. It is dark and quiet around him. The air is cool and musty. Pictures of saints look down on him with stony eyes. Christ's face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of anguish. On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil spying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the confession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the grille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn't see him. \nKNIGHT I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but my heart is empty. \nDEATH doesn't answer. \nKNIGHT The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my own face. I see myself in it, and I am filled with fear and disgust. \nDEATH doesn't answer. \nKNIGHT Through my indifference to my fellow men, I have isolated myself from their company. Now I live in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies. \nDEATH And yet you don't want to die. \nKNIGHT Yes, I do. \nDEATH What are you waiting for? \nKNIGHT I want knowledge. \nDEATH You want guarantees? \nKNIGHT Call it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles? \nDEATH doesn't answer. \nKNIGHT How can we have faith in those who believe when we can't have faith in ourselves? What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to? And what is to become of those who neither want to nor are capable of believing? \nThe KNIGHT stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. There is complete silence. \nKNIGHT Why can't I kill God within me? Why does He live on in this painful and humiliating way even though I curse Him and want to tear Him out of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, is He a baffling reality that I can't shake off? Do you hear me? \n", "test1_id": 2274, "test2_input": "JOF Oh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing to do. \nPLOG I'm also going to kill the actor. \nJOF The actor? \nPLOG Of course, the one she eloped with. \nJOF What has he done to deserve that? \nPLOG Are you stupid? \nJOF The actor! Now I understand. There are too many of them, so even if he hasn't done anything in particular you ought to kill him merely because he's an actor. \nPLOG You see, my wife has always been interested in the tricks of the theatre. \nJOF And that turned out to be her misfortune. \nPLOG Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person who's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune. Isn't that true? \nNow RAVAL enters the discussion. He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill and evil. \nRAVAL Listen, you! You sit there and lie to the smith. \nJOF I! A liar! \nRAVAL You're an actor too and it's probably your partner who's run off with Plog's old lady. \nPLOG Are you an actor too? \nJOF An actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that! \nRAVAL We ought to kill you; it's only logical. \nJOF (laughs) You're really funny. \nRAVAL How strange -- you've turned pale. Have you anything on your conscience? \nJOF You're funny. Don't you think he's funny? (to Plog) Oh, you don't. \nRAVAL Maybe we should mark you up a little with a knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your kind. \nPLOG bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. He gets up. \n", "test2_true": "The room becomes silent. JOF looks around, but there is no exit, no way to escape. He puts his hands on the table. Suddenly a knife flashes through the air and sinks into the table top between his fingers. \nJOF snatches away his hands and raises his head. He looks half surprised, as if the truth had just become apparent to him. \nJOF Do you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked someone, or got in the way? I'll leave right now and never come back. \nJOF looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or come to his defense. \nRAVAL Get up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder. \nTrembling, JOF rises. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a word comes out. \nRAVAL Stand on your head so that we can see how good an actor you are. \nJOF gets up on the table and stands on his head. A hand pushes him forward so that he collapses on the floor. PLOG rises, pulls him to his feet with one hand. \nPLOG (shouts) What have you done with my wife? \nPLOG beats him so furiously that JOF flies across the table. RAVAL leans over him. \nRAVAL Don't lie there moaning. Get up and dance. \nJOF I don't want to. I can't. \nRAVEL Show us how you imitate a bear. \nJOF I can't play a bear. \nRAVAL Let's see if you can't after all. \nRAVAL prods JOF lightly with the knife point. JOF gets up with cold sweat on his cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. He begins to jump and hop on top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces. Some laugh, but most of the people sit silently. JOF gasps as if his lungs were about to burst. He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him. \nRAVEL Up again! Be a good bear. \nJOF I haven't done any harm. I haven't got the strength to play a bear any more. \nAt that moment the door opens and JONS enters. JOF sees his chance and steals out. RAVAL intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. JONS and RAVAL look at each other. \nJONS Do you remember what I was going to do to you if we met again? \nRAVAL steps back without speaking. \n", "test2_id": 2275, "test3_input": "JONS I'm a man who keeps his word. \nJONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers towards the wall. \nThe hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. In a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and the shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness. \nThe players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse grazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son in her arms. They play together and laugh happily. \nNow, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the red clouds over the sea. \nNot far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He lifts his head. \nThe evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and the child. The KNIGHT gets up. \nMIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the KNIGHT. \nKNIGHT What's his name? \nMIA Mikael. \nKNIGHT How old is he? \nMIA Oh, he'll soon be two. \nKNIGHT He's big for his age. \nMIA Do you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big. \nShe puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red skirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer. \nKNIGHT You played some kind of show this afternoon. \nMIA Did you think it was bad? \nKNIGHT You are more beautiful now without your face painted, and this gown is more becoming. \nMIA You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, so we're in real trouble now. \nKNIGHT Is that your husband? \nMIA (laughs) Jonas! The other man is my husband. His name is Jof. \nKNIGHT Oh, that one. \n", "test3_true": "KNIGHT Do you do tricks also? \nMIA We certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful juggler. \nKNIGHT Is Mikael going to be an acrobat? \nMIA Jof wants him to be. \nKNIGHT But you don't. \nMIA I don't know. (smiling) Perhaps he'll become a knight. \nKNIGHT Let me assure you, that's no pleasure either. \nMIA No, you don't look so happy. \nKNIGHT No. \nMIA Are you tired? \nKNIGHT Yes. \nMIA Why? \nKNIGHT I have dull company. \nMIA Do you mean your squire? \nKNIGHT No, not him. \nMIA Who do you mean, then? \nKNIGHT Myself. \nMIA I understand. \nKNIGHT Do you, really? \nMIA Yes, I understand rather well. I have often wondered why people torture themselves as often as they can. Isn't that so? \nShe nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously. Now the shrieks and the noise from the inn become louder. Black figures flicker across the grass mound. Someone collapses, gets up and runs. It is JOF. MIA stretches out her arms and receives him. He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like a child, and his body sways. He kneels. MIA holds him close to her and sprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done? How are you? What is it? Does it hurt? What can I do? Have they been cruel to you? She runs for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's dirty, bloody face. \n", "test3_id": 2276}

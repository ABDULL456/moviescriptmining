{"train": "The Seventh Seal \nThe night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of wind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are wide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep. \nNearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly. He has fallen asleep where he collapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. His open mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat. At the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles towards the sea. They are as thin and worn as their masters. \nThe KNIGHT has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his sunburned face and blistered lips. JONS rolls over to face the forest and the darkness. He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on his head. A scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning against the grime. \nThe KNIGHT returns to the beach and falls on his knees. With his eyes closed and brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. His hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently. His face is sad and bitter. He opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. The sky is gray and immobile, a dome of lead. A cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. High up, barely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. Its cry is weird and restless. The KNIGHT'S large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. Antonius Block turns around. \nBehind him stands a man in black. His face is very pale and he keeps his hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak. \nKNIGHT Who are you? \nDEATH I am Death. \nKNIGHT Have you come for me? \nDEATH I have been walking by your side for a long time. \nKNIGHT That I know. \nDEATH Are you prepared? \nKNIGHT My body is frightened, but I am not. \nDEATH Well, there is no shame in that. \nThe KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place it around the KNIGHT'S shoulders. \nKNIGHT Wait a moment. \nDEATH That's what they all say. I grant no reprieves. \nKNIGHT You play chess, don't you? \nA gleam of interest kindles in DEATH'S eyes. \nDEATH How did you know that? \nKNIGHT I have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads. \nDEATH Yes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player. \nJONS Not exactly. \nKNIGHT What did he say? \nJONS Nothing. \nKNIGHT Was he a mute? \nJONS No, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent. \nKNIGHT Oh? \nJONS He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing. (sings) One moment you're bright and lively, The next you're crawling with worms. Fate is a terrible villain And you, my friend, its poor victim. \nKNIGHT Must you sing? \nJONS No. \nThe KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a while. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle down their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. They ride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby and is answered by the KNIGHT'S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the road. \nIn his sleep, JOF the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer from a distance. He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the wagon. The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light across the face of JOF'S wife, MIA, and their one-year-old son, MIKAEL, who are sleeping deeply and peacefully. Near them, JONAS SKAT, an older man, snores loudly. \nJOF crawls out of the wagon. There is still a spot of shade under the big trees. He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny old horse. \nJOF Good morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't eat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? We're a little hard up. People aren't very interested in juggling in this part of the country. \nHe has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he stands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down with a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to sway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and the grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long warble. \nJOF'S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and bees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing. \nSuddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF'S smile fades, the flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies. \nJOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake. \nJOF Mia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen something. I've got to tell you about it! \nMIA (sits up, terrified) What is it? What's happened? \nJOF Listen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a vision. It was real, absolutely real. \nMIA Oh, so you've had a vision again! \nMIA's voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by the shoulders. \nJOF To make one of the balls stand absolutely still in the air. \nMIA But that's impossible. \nJOF Impossible for us -- but not for him. \nMIA You're dreaming again. \nShe yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass. JOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders. \nJOF I've composed a song. I made it up during the night when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to hear it? \nMIA Sing it. I'm very curious. \nJOF I have to sit up first. \nHe sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and sings in a loud voice. \nJOF (sings) On a lily branch a dove is perched Against the summer sky, She sings a wondrous song of Christ And there's great joy on high. \nHe interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife. \nJOF Mia! Are you asleep? \nMIA It's a lovely song. \nJOF I haven't finished yet. \nMIA I heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little longer. You can sing the rest to me afterwards. \nJOF All you do is sleep. \nJOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also sleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely made death mask. \nSKAT Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If the priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no thank you. \nJOF Are you going to play Death? \nSKAT Just think, scaring decent folk out of their wits with this kind of nonsense. \nJOF When are we supposed to do this play? \nSKAT At the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going to perform right on the church steps, believe it or not. \nJONS Why do you paint such nonsense? \nPAINTER I thought it would serve to remind people that they must die. \nJONS Well, it's not going to make them feel any happier. \nPAINTER Why should one always make people happy? It might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while. \nJONS Then they'll close their eyes and refuse to look at your painting. \nPAINTER Oh, they'll look. A skull is almost more interesting than a naked woman. \nJONS If you do scare them ... \nPAINTER They'll think. \nJONS And if they think ... \nPAINTER They'll become still more scared. \nJONS And then they'll run right into the arms of the priests. \nPAINTER That's not my business. \nJONS You're only painting your Dance of Death. \nPAINTER I'm only painting things as they are. Everyone else can do as he likes. \nJONS Just think how some people will curse you. \nPAINTER Maybe. But then I'll paint something amusing for them to look at. I have to make a living -- at least until the plague takes me. \nJONS The plague. That sounds horrible. \nPAINTER You should see the boils on a diseased man's throat. You should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs look like knotted strings -- like the man I've painted over there. \nThe PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in the grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain. \nJONS That looks terrible. \nPAINTER It certainly does. He tries to rip out the boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open with his fingernails and his screams can be heard everywhere. Does that scare you? \nJONS Scare? Me? You don't know me. What are the horrors you've painted over there? \nDEATH Yes, I hear you. \nKNIGHT I want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, but knowledge. I want God to stretch out His hand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to me. \nDEATH But He remains silent. \nKNIGHT I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there. \nDEATH Perhaps no one is there. \nKNIGHT Then life is an outrageous horror. No one can live in the face of death, knowing that all is nothingness. \nDEATH Most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life. \nKNIGHT But one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness. \nDEATH When that day comes ... \nKNIGHT In our fear, we make an image, and that image we call God. \nDEATH You are worrying ... \nKNIGHT Death visited me this morning. We are playing chess together. This reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an urgent matter. \nDEATH What matter is that? \nKNIGHT My life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, a great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no bitterness or self-reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this. But I will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed. \nDEATH Is that why you are playing chess with Death? \nKNIGHT He is a clever opponent, but up to now I haven't lost a single man. \nDEATH How will you outwit Death in your game? \nKNIGHT I use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the next move I'll shatter one of his flanks. \nDEATH I'll remember that. \nDEATH shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but disappears instantly. \nKNIGHT You've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet again, and I'll find a way. \nDEATH (invisible) We'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue playing. \nJONS Neither can I. \nJONS walks over towards the horses. The KNIGHT stands for a few, moments looking at the young girl. She is almost a child. Slowly she turns her eyes towards him. \nKNIGHT Have you seen the Devil? \nThe MONK stops reading and raises his head. \nMONK You must not talk to her. \nKNIGHT Can that be so dangerous? \nMONK I don't know, but she is believed to have caused the pestilence with which we are affected. \nKNIGHT I understand. \nHe nods resignedly and walks away. The young woman starts to moan as though she were having a horrible nightmare. The sound of her cries follows the two riders for a considerable distance down the road. \nThe sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. The waterskin is empty and JONS looks for a well where he can fill it. \nThey approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. JONS ties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the path towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and almost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when no one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft object. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying with her face to the ground. \nAt the sound of approaching steps, JONS quickly hides behind the door. A man comes down a ladder from the loft. He is broad and thick-set. His eyes are black and his face is pale and puffy. His clothes are well cut but dirty and in rags. He carries a cloth sack. Looking around, he goes into the inner room, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the walls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his bag. \nSlowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully slips a ring from her finger. At that moment a young woman comes through the door. She stops and stares at the stranger. \nRAVEL Why do you look so surprised? I steal from the dead. These days it's quite a lucrative enterprise. \nThe GIRL makes a movement as if to run away. \nRAVEL You're thinking of running to the village and telling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each of us has to save his own skin. It's as simple as that. \nGIRL Don't touch me. \nRAVAL Don't try to scream. There's no one around to hear you, neither God nor man. \nSlowly he closes the door behind the GIRL. The stuffy room is now in almost total darkness. But JONS becomes clearly visible. \nJONS I recognize you, although it's a long time since we met. Your name is Raval, from the theological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis. \nRAVAL smiles uneasily and looks around. \nJONS Am I not right? \nThe actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. Dressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce. \nThe spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. There are merchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands and milkmaids. A whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon. \nThe KNIGHT and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. They drink beer and doze in the midday heat. The GIRL from the deserted village sleeps at JONS'S side. SKAT beats the drums, JOF blows the flute, MIA performs a gay and lively dance. They perspire under the hot white sun. When they have finished SKAT comes forward and bows. \nSKAT Noble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your interest. Please remain standing for a little longer, or sit on the ground, because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and the handsome lover -- that's me. \nMIA and JOF have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. They bow, to the public. \nSKAT Here is the husband. Here is the wife. If you'll shut up over there, you'll see something splendid. As I said, I play the lover and I haven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to hide behind the curtain for the time being. (he wipes the sweat from his forehead) It's damned hot. I think we'll have a thunderstorm. \nHe places his leg in front of JOF as if to trip him, raises MIA's skirt, makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains. \nSKAT is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin washbowl. His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks are flushed rose red. \nHe sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and whistling to himself. \nIn the meantime JOF and MIA play their tragedy; it is not, however, received with great acclaim. SKAT suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. A woman stands there, stately in both height and volume. \nSKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but fiery glance at the beautiful visitor. She suddenly discovers that one of her shoes doesn't quite fit. She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her generous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity allow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here. \nNow she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. JONAS SKAT manages not to fall off the wagon in his excitement. Standing on the steps of the wagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows. \nThe woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. At this moment the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites. \nWhen he sees this look, SKAT makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel. \nShe becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy glance and breathes heavily. SKAT doesn't neglect to press kisses on her small, chubby hands. The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in the bushes. \nNow she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any longer. Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack of food and holds it up in front of SKAT with an appealing and triumphant expression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize. \nSKAT hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. He lets the chicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear. \nHis words seem to please her. She puts her arms around the actor's neck and pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance and tumble down on the soft grass. The small birds take to their wings with frightened shrieks. \nJOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. MIA pretends to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage. \nJOF Night and moonlight now prevail Here sleeps my wife so frail ... \nVOICE FROM THE PUBLIC Does she snore? \nJOF May I point out that this is a tragedy, and in tragedies one doesn't snore. \nJOF Oh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing to do. \nPLOG I'm also going to kill the actor. \nJOF The actor? \nPLOG Of course, the one she eloped with. \nJOF What has he done to deserve that? \nPLOG Are you stupid? \nJOF The actor! Now I understand. There are too many of them, so even if he hasn't done anything in particular you ought to kill him merely because he's an actor. \nPLOG You see, my wife has always been interested in the tricks of the theatre. \nJOF And that turned out to be her misfortune. \nPLOG Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person who's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune. Isn't that true? \nNow RAVAL enters the discussion. He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill and evil. \nRAVAL Listen, you! You sit there and lie to the smith. \nJOF I! A liar! \nRAVAL You're an actor too and it's probably your partner who's run off with Plog's old lady. \nPLOG Are you an actor too? \nJOF An actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that! \nRAVAL We ought to kill you; it's only logical. \nJOF (laughs) You're really funny. \nRAVAL How strange -- you've turned pale. Have you anything on your conscience? \nJOF You're funny. Don't you think he's funny? (to Plog) Oh, you don't. \nRAVAL Maybe we should mark you up a little with a knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your kind. \nPLOG bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. He gets up. \nJONS I'm a man who keeps his word. \nJONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers towards the wall. \nThe hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. In a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and the shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness. \nThe players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse grazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son in her arms. They play together and laugh happily. \nNow, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the red clouds over the sea. \nNot far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He lifts his head. \nThe evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and the child. The KNIGHT gets up. \nMIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the KNIGHT. \nKNIGHT What's his name? \nMIA Mikael. \nKNIGHT How old is he? \nMIA Oh, he'll soon be two. \nKNIGHT He's big for his age. \nMIA Do you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big. \nShe puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red skirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer. \nKNIGHT You played some kind of show this afternoon. \nMIA Did you think it was bad? \nKNIGHT You are more beautiful now without your face painted, and this gown is more becoming. \nMIA You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, so we're in real trouble now. \nKNIGHT Is that your husband? \nMIA (laughs) Jonas! The other man is my husband. His name is Jof. \nKNIGHT Oh, that one. \nKNIGHT I humbly thank you. \nMIA These are wild strawberries from the forest. I have never seen such large ones. They grow up there on the hillside. Notice how they smell! \nShe points with a spoon and smiles. The KNIGHT nods, as if he were pondering some profound thought. JOF eats heartily. \nJOF Your suggestion is good, but I must think it over. \nMIA It might be wise to have company going through the forest. It's said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard. \nJOF (staunchly) Yes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I have to think about it. Now that Skat has left, I am responsible for the troupe. After all, I have become director of the whole company. \nMIA (mimics) After all, I have become director of the whole company. \nJONS comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the GIRL. MIA points with her spoon. \nMIA Do you want some strawberries? \nJOF This man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, and let us be together. \nMIA (stretches herself) Oh, how nice this is. \nKNIGHT For a short while. \nMIA Nearly always. One day is like another. There is nothing strange about that. The summer, of course, is better than the winter, because in summer you don't have to be cold. But spring is best of all. \nJOF I have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps you'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre. \nHe sprints towards the wagon. \nMIA Not now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by your songs. \nJONS (politely) By all means. I write little songs myself. For example, I know a very funny song about a wanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet. \nThe KNIGHT looks at him. \nJONS You'll not get to hear it either. There are persons here who don't appreciate my art and I don't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive soul. \nJOF has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the instrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. JONS yawns and lies down. \nKNIGHT People are troubled by so much. \nMIA It's always better when one is two. Have you no one of your own? \nDEATH Have you tricked me? \nKNIGHT Of course. You fell right in the trap. Check! \nDEATH What are you laughing at? \nKNIGHT Don't worry about my laughter; save your king instead. \nDEATH You're rather arrogant. \nKNIGHT Our game amuses me. \nDEATH It's your move. Hurry up. I'm a little pressed for time. \nKNIGHT I understand that you've a lot to do, but you can't get out of our game. It takes time. \nDEATH is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. The KNIGHT smiles. \nDEATH Are you going to escort the juggler and his wife through the forest? Those whose names are Jof and Mia and who have a small son? \nKNIGHT Why do you ask? \nDEATH Oh, no reason at all. \nThe KNIGHT suddenly stops smiling. DEATH looks at him scornfully. \nImmediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn. There is the KNIGHT, JONS and the GIRL, JOF and MIA in their wagon. Their son, MIKAEL, is already asleep. JONAS SKAT is still missing. \nJONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a last mug of beer. The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands and maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. At one of the small windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his hands. His expression is very sad. Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic sob. It is PLOG, the smith, who sits there and whimpers. \nJONS God in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith? \nPLOG Good evening. \nJONS Are you sitting here sniveling in loneliness? \nPLOG Yes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a rabbit. \nJONS If I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get rid of a wife in such an easy way. \nJONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down by his side. \nPLOG Are you married? \nJONS Believe! Who said that I believed it? But I love to give good advice. If you ask me for advice you'll get two pieces for the price of one, because after all I really am an educated man. \nJONS gets up from the table and strokes his face with his hands. PLOG becomes very unhappy and grabs his belt. \nPLOG Listen, J\u0088ns. May I go with you through the forest? I'm so lonely and don't want to go home because everyone will laugh at me. \nJONS Only if you don't whimper all the time, because in that case we'll all have to avoid you. \nPLOG gets up and embraces JONS. Slightly drunk, the two new friends walk towards the door. \nWhen they come out in the yard, JOF immediately catches sight of them, becomes angry and yells a warning to JONS. \nJOF J\u0088ns! Watch out. That one wants to fight all the time. He's not quite sane. \nJONS Yes, but now he's just sniveling. \nPLOG steps up to JOF, who blanches with fear. PLOG offers his hand. \nPLOG I'm really sorry if I hurt you. But I have such a hell of a temper, you know. Shake hands. \nJOF gingerly proffers a frightened hand and gets it thoroughly shaken and squeezed. While JOF tries to straighten out his fingers, PLOG is seized by great good will and opens his arms. \nPLOG Come in my arms, little brother. \nJOF Thank you, thank you, perhaps later. But now we're really in a hurry. \nJOF climbs up on the wagon seat quickly and clucks at the horse. \nThe small company is on its way towards the forest and the night. \nIt is dark in the forest. \nFirst comes the KNIGHT on his large horse. Then JOF and MIA follow, sitting close to each other in the juggler's wagon. MIA holds her son in her arms. JONS follows them with his heavily laden horse. He has the smith in tow. The GIRL sits on top of the load on the horse's back, hunched over as if asleep. \nThe footsteps, the horses' heavy tramp on the soft path, the human breathing -- yet it is quiet. \nThen the moon sails out of the clouds. The forest suddenly becomes alive with the night's unreality. The dazzling light pours through the thick foliage of the beech trees, a moving, quivering world of light and shadow. \nThe wanderers stop. Their eyes are dark with anxiety and foreboding. Their faces are pale and unreal in the floating light. It is very quiet. \nPLOG Now the moon has come out of the clouds. \nJONS That's good. Now we can see the road better. \nWhen they have fastened her, they walk over to light the pyre. The KNIGHT steps up and leans over her. \nJONS For a moment I thought of killing the soldiers, but it would do no good. She's nearly dead already. \nOne of the soldiers approaches. Thick smoke wells down from the pyre and sweeps over the quiet shadows near the crossroads and the hill. \nSOLDIER I've told you to be careful. Don't go too close to her. \nThe KNIGHT doesn't heed this warning. He cups his hand, fills it with water from the skin and gives it to TYAN. Then he gives her a potion. \nKNIGHT Take this and it will stop the pain. \nSmoke billows down over them and they begin to cough. The soldiers step forward and raise the ladder against a nearby fir tree. TYAN hangs there motionlessly, her eyes wide open. \nThe KNIGHT straightens up and stands immobile. JONS is behind him, his voice nearly choked with rage. \nJONS What does she see? Can you tell me? \nKNIGHT (shakes his head) She feels no more pain. \nJONS You don't answer my question. Who watches over that child? Is it the angels, or God, or the Devil, or only the emptiness? Emptiness, my lord! \nKNIGHT This cannot be. \nJONS Look at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has just made a discovery. Emptiness under the moon. \nKNIGHT No. \nJONS We stand powerless, our arms hanging at our sides, because we see what she sees, and our terror and hers are the same. (an outburst) That poor little child. I can't stand it, I can't stand it ... \nHis voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away. The KNIGHT mounts his horse. The travelers depart from the crossroads. TYAN finally closes her eyes. \nThe forest is now very dark. The road winds between the trees. The wagon squeaks and rattles over stones and roots. A bird suddenly shrieks. \nJOF lifts his head and wakes up. He has been asleep with his arms around MIA's shoulders. The KNIGHT is sharply silhouetted against the tree trunks. \nHis silence makes him seem almost unreal. JONS and PLOG are slightly drunk and support each other. Suddenly PLOG has to sit down. He puts his hands over his face and howls piteously. \nPLOG Oh, now it came over me again! \nJONS Don't scream. What came over you? \nPLOG My wife, damn it. She is so beautiful. She is so beautiful that she can't be described without the accompaniment of a lyre. \nLISA He is only a false beard, false teeth, false smiles, rehearsed lines, and he's as empty as a jug. Just kill him. \nLISA sobs with excitement and sorrow. PLOG looks around, a little confused. SKAT uses this opportunity. He pulls out a dagger and places the point against his breast. \nSKAT She's right. Just kill me. If you thought that I was going to apologize for being what I am, you are mistaken. \nLISA Look how sickening he is. How he makes a fool of himself, how he puts on an act. Dear Plog, kill him. \nSKAT My friends, you have only to push, and my unreality will soon be transformed into a new, solid reality. An absolutely tangible corpse. \nLISA Do something then. Kill him. \nPLOG (embarrassed) He has to fight me, otherwise I can't kill him. \nSKAT Your life's thread now hangs by a very ragged shred. Idiot, your day is short. \nPLOG You'll have to irritate me a little more to get me as angry as before. \nSKAT looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes towards the night sky. \nSKAT I forgive all of you. Pray for me sometimes. \nSKAT sinks the dagger into his breast and slowly falls to the ground. The travelers stand confused. PLOG rushes forward and begins to pull at SKAT'S hands. \nPLOG Oh dear, dear, I didn't mean it that way! Look, there's no life left in him. I was beginning to like him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too spiteful. \nJOF leans over his colleague. \nJOF He's dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact, I've never seen such a dead actor. \nLISA Come on, let's go. This is nothing to mourn over. He has only himself to blame. \nPLOG And I have to be married to her. \nJONS We must go on. \nSKAT lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast. The travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on the other side of the meadow. When SKAT is sure that no one can see him, he sits up and lifts the dagger from his breast. It is a stage dagger with a blade that pushes into the handle. SKAT laughs to himself. \nSKAT Now that was a good scene. I'm really a good actor. After all, why shouldn't I be a little pleased with myself? But where shall I go? I'll wait until it becomes light and then I'll find the easiest way out of the forest. I'll climb up a tree for the time being so that no bears, wolves or ghosts can get at me. \nHe soon finds a likely tree and climbs up into its thick foliage. He sits down as comfortably as possible and reaches for his food pouch. \nSKAT (yawns) Tomorrow I'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll go to the saints' feast in Elsinore. We'll make lots of money there. (yawns) Now, I'll sing a little song to myself: (sings) I am a little bird Who sings whate'er he will, And when I am in danger I fling out a pissing trill As in the carnal thrill. (speaks) It's boring to be alone in the forest tonight. (sings) The terrible night doesn't frighten me ... \nSKAT Perhaps you'll take a bribe. \nDEATH saws. \nSKAT Help! \nDEATH saws. \nSKAT Help! Help! \nThe tree falls. The forest becomes silent again. \nNight and then dawn. \nThe travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss. They lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the wind in the tree tops. Here the forest is wild and impenetrable. Huge boulders stick up out of the ground like the heads of black giants. A fallen tree lies like a mighty barrier between light and shadow. \nMIA, JOF and their child have sat down apart from the others. They look at the light of the moon, which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and unstable. The KNIGHT sits bent over his chess game. LISA cries quietly behind PLOG'S back. JONS lies on the ground and looks up at the heavens. \nJONS Soon dawn will come, but the heat continues to hang over us like a smothering blanket. \nLISA I'm so frightened. \nPLOG We feel that something is going to happen to us, but we don't know what. \nJONS Maybe it's the day of judgment. \nPLOG The day of judgment ... \nNow, something moves behind the fallen tree. There is a rustling sound and a moaning cry that seems to come from a wounded animal. Everyone listens intently, all faces turned towards the sound. A voice comes out of the darkness. \nRAVAL Do you have some water? \nRAVAL'S perspiring face soon becomes visible. He disappears in the darkness, but his voice is heard again. \nRAVAL Can't you give me a little water? (pause) I have the plague. \nJONS Don't come here. If you do I'll slit your throat. Keep to the other side of the tree. \nRAVEL I'm afraid of death. \nNo one answers. There is complete silence. RAVAL gasps heavily for air. The dry leaves rustle with his movements. \nRAVEL I don't want to die! I don't want to! \nMIA What do you see? \nJOF The knight is sitting over there playing chess. \nMIA Yes, I can see that too and I don't think it's so terrible. \nJOF But do you see who he's playing with? \nMIA He is alone. You mustn't frighten me this way. \nJOF No, no, he isn't alone. \nMIA Who is it, then? \nJOF Death. He is sitting there playing chess with Death himself. \nMIA You mustn't say that. \nJOF We must try to escape. \nMIA One can't do that. \nJOF We must try. They are so occupied with their game that if we move very quietly, they won't notice us. \nJOF gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees. MIA remains standing, as if paralyzed by fear. She stares fixedly at the KNIGHT and the chess game. She holds her son in her arms. Now JOF returns. \nJOF I have harnessed the horse. The wagon is standing near the big tree. You go first and I'll follow you with the packs. See that Mikael doesn't wake up. \nMIA does what JOF has told her. At the same moment, the KNIGHT looks up from his game. \nDEATH It is your move, Antonius Block. \nThe KNIGHT remains silent. He sees MIA go through the moonlight towards the wagon. JOF bends down to pick up the pack and follows at a distance. \nDEATH Have you lost interest in our game? \nThe KNIGHT'S eyes become alarmed. DEATH looks at him intently. \nKNIGHT Lost interest? On the contrary. \nDEATH You seem anxious. Are you hiding anything? \nKNIGHT Nothing escapes you -- or does it? \nJOF It's probably rain. \nMIA No, it isn't rain. He has seen us and he's following us. He has overtaken us; he's coming towards us. \nJOF Not yet, Mia. In any case, not yet. \nMIA I'm so afraid. I'm so afraid. \nThe wagon rattles over roots and stones; it sways and creaks. Now the horse stops with his ears flat against his head. The forest sighs and stirs ponderously. \nJOF Get into the wagon, Mia. Crawl in quickly. We'll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us. \nThey crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child. \nJOF It is the Angel of Death that's passing over us, Mia. It's the Angel of Death. The Angel of Death, and he's very big. \nMIA Do you feel how cold it is? I'm freezing. I'm terribly cold. \nShe shivers as if she had a fever. They pull the blankets over them and lie closely together. The wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind. The roar outside is like a giant bellowing. \nThe castle is silhouetted like a black boulder against the heavy dawn. Now the storm moves there, throwing itself powerfully against walls and abutments.  The sky darkens; it is almost like night. \nAntonius Block has brought his companions with him to the castle. But it seems deserted. They walk from room to room. There is only emptiness and quiet echoes. Outside, the rain is heard roaring noisily. \nSuddenly the KNIGHT stands face to face with his wife. They look at each other quietly. \nKARIN I heard from people who came from the crusade that you were on your way home. I've been waiting for you here. All the others have fled from the plague. \nThe KNIGHT is silent. He looks at her. \nKARIN Don't you recognize me any more? \nThe KNIGHT nods, silent. \nKARIN You also have changed. \nShe walks closer and looks searchingly into his face. The smile lingers in her eyes and she touches his hand lightly. \nKARIN Now I can see that it's you. Somewhere in your eyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and frightened, is that boy who went away so many years ago. \nKNIGHT It's over now and I'm a little tired. \nKARIN I see that you're tired. \n", "test1_input": "KNIGHT (yawns) Yes, yes. \nJONS Even the ghost stories about God the Father, the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost -- all these I've accepted without too much emotion. \nHe leans down over the GIRL as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the head. The KNIGHT drinks his beer silently. \nJONS (contentedly) My little stomach is my world, my head is my eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My legs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my philosophy. Everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the only difference being that a belch is more satisfying. \nThe beer mug is empty. Sighing, JONS gets to his feet. The GIRL follows him like a shadow. \nIn the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. He stops JONS with a roar. \nJONS What are you screaming about? \nPLOG I am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire J\u0088ns. \nJONS That's possible. \nPLOG Have you seen my wife? \nJONS No, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she looked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd seen her. \nPLOG Well, in that case you haven't seen her. \nJONS Maybe she's run off. \nPLOG Do you know anything? \nJONS I know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go to the inn. Maybe they can help you. \nThe smith sighs sadly and goes inside. \nThe inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their newly aroused fears of eternity. In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns on an iron spit. The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays piercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and perspiration. \nMERCHANT Yes, it's true! The plague is spreading along the west coast. People are dying like flies. Usually business would be good at this time of year, but, damn it, I've still got my whole stock unsold. \nWOMAN They speak of the judgment day. And all these omens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands and other monstrosities began pouring out of an old woman, and down in the village another woman gave birth to a calf's head. \nOLD MAN The day of judgment. Imagine. \nFARMER It hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely lose our crops. \nMERCHANT And people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee the country and carry the plague with them wherever they go. \n", "test1_true": "FARMER If it's as they say, I suppose a person should look after his house and try to enjoy life as long as he can. \nWOMAN But there have been other things too, such things that can't even be spoken of. (whispers) Things that mustn't be named -- but the priests say that the woman carries it between her legs and that's why she must cleanse herself. \nOLD MAN Judgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse stand at the bend in the village road. I imagine they'll come on judgment night, at sundown. \nWOMAN There are many who have purged themselves with fire and died from it, but the priests say that it's better to die pure than to live for hell. \nMERCHANT This is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out loud, but all of us know that it's the end. And people are going mad from fear. \nFARMER So you're afraid too. \nMERCHANT Of course I'm afraid. \nOLD MAN The judgment day becomes night, and the angels descend and the graves open. It will be terrible to see. \nThey whisper in low tones and sit close to each other. \nPLOG, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to JOF, who is still dressed in his costume. Opposite him sits RAVAL, leaning slightly forward, his face perspiring heavily. RAVAL rolls an armlet out on the table. \nRAVAL Do you want this armlet? You can have it cheap. \nJOF I can't afford it. \nRAVAL It's real silver. \nJOF It's nice. But it's surely too expensive for me. \nPLOG Excuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife? \nJOF Has she disappeared? \nPLOG They say she's run away. \nJOF Has she deserted you? \nPLOG With an actor. \nJOF An actor! If she's got such bad taste, then I think you should let her go. \nPLOG You're right. My first thought, of course, was to kill her. \n", "test1_id": 2274, "test2_input": "Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. Blood runs from a bruise on his forehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise JOF seems unhurt. \nJOF Ouch, it hurts. \nMIA Why did you have to go there? And of course you drank. \nMIA's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. She pats him a little harder than necessary. \nJOF Ouch! I didn't drink anything. \nMIA Then I suppose you were boasting about the angels and devils you consort with. People don't like someone who has too many ideas and fantasies. \nJOF I swear to you that I didn't say a word about angels. \nMIA You were, of course, busy singing and dancing. You can never stop being an actor. People also become angry at that, and you know it. \nJOF doesn't answer but searches for the armlet. He holds it up in front of MIA with an injured expression. \nJOF Look what I bought for you. \nMIA You couldn't afford it. \nJOF (angry) But I got it anyhow. \nThe armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. MIA now pulls it across her wrist. They look at it in silence, and their faces soften. They look at each other, touch each other's hands. JOF puts his head against MIA'S shoulder and sighs. \nJOF Oh, how they beat me. \nMIA Why didn't you beat them back? \nJOF I only become frightened and angry. I never get a chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know that. I roared like a lion. \nMIA Were they frightened? \nJOF No, they just laughed. \nTheir son MIKAEL crawls over to them. JOF lies down on the ground and pulls his son on top of him. MIA gets down on her hands and knees and playfully sniffs at MIKAEL. \nMIA Do you notice how good he smells? \nJOF And he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy one. A real acrobat's body. \nHe lifts MIKAEL up and holds him by the legs. MIA looks up suddenly, remembering the knight's presence. \n", "test2_true": "JOF Good evening. \nKNIGHT Good evening. \nJOF becomes a little embarrassed and rises. All three of them look at one another silently. \nKNIGHT I have just told your wife that you have a splendid son. He'll bring great joy to you. \nJOF Yes, he's fine. \nThey become silent again. \nJOF Have we nothing to offer the knight, Mia? \nKNIGHT Thank you, I don't want anything. \nMIA (housewifely) I picked a basket of wild strawberries this afternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh from a cow ... \nJOF ... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you would like to partake of this humble fare, it would be a great honor. \nMIA Please be seated and I'll bring the food. \nThey sit down. MIA disappears with MIKAEL. \nKNIGHT Where are you going next? \nJOF Up to the saints' feast at Elsinore. \nKNIGHT I wouldn't advise you to go there. \nJOF Why not, if I may ask? \nKNIGHT The plague has spread in that direction, following the coast line south. It's said that people are dying by the tens of thousands. \nJOF Really! Well, sometimes life is a little hard. \nKNIGHT May I suggest ... (JOF looks at him, surprised) ... that you follow me through the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go along the east coast. You'll probably be safer there. \nMIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it between them and gives each of them a spoon. \nJOF I wish you good appetite. \n", "test2_id": 2275, "test3_input": "SOLDIER Well, we've been paid. And this is a volunteer job. \nThe SOLDIER speaks in whispers while glancing anxiously at the WITCH. \nKNIGHT (to the WITCH) What's your name? \nTYAN My name is Tyan, my lord. \nKNIGHT How old are you? \nTYAN Fourteen, my lord. \nKNIGHT And is it true that you have been in league with the Devil? \nTYAN nods quietly and looks away. Now they arrive at the parish border. At the foot of the nearby hills lies a crossroads. The pyre has already been stacked in the center of the forest clearing. The travelers remain there, hesitant and curious. \nThe soldiers have tied up the cart horse and bring out two long wooden beams. They nail rungs across the beams so that it looks like a ladder. TYAN will be bound to this like an eelskin stretched out to dry. \nThe sound of the hammering echoes through the forest. The KNIGHT has dismounted and walks closer to the cart. Again he tries to catch TYAN'S eyes, touches her very lightly as if to waken her. Slowly she turns her face towards him. \nKNIGHT They say that you have been in league with the Devil. \nTYAN Why do you ask? \nKNIGHT Not out of curiosity, but for very personal reasons. I too want to meet him. \nTYAN Why? \nKNIGHT I want to ask him about God. He, if anyone, must know. \nTYAN You can see him anytime. \nKNIGHT How? \nTYAN You must do as I tell you. \nThe KNIGHT grips the wooden rail of the cart so tightly that his knuckles whiten. TYAN leans forward and joins her gaze with his. \nTYAN Look into my eyes. \nThe KNIGHT meets her gaze. They stare at each other for a long time. \nTYAN What do you see? Do you see him? \n", "test3_true": "He falls silent. The soldiers work at the stakes; their hammering echoes in the forest. \nTYAN No one, nothing, no one? \nKNIGHT (shakes his head) No. \nTYAN Can't you see him behind your back? \nKNIGHT (looks around) No, there is no one there. \nTYAN But he is with me everywhere. I only have to stretch out my hand and I can feel his hand. He is with me now too. The fire won't hurt me. He will protect me from everything evil. \nKNIGHT Has he told you this? \nTYAN I know it. \nKNIGHT Has he said it? \nTYAN I know it, I know it. You must see him somewhere, you must. The priests had no difficulty seeing him, nor did the soldiers. They are so afraid of him that they don't even dare touch me. \nThe sounds of the hammers stops. The soldiers stand like black shadows rooted in the moss. They fumble with the chains and pull at the neck iron. TYAN moans weakly, as if she were far away. \nKNIGHT Why have you crushed her hands? \nSOLDIER (surly) We didn't do it. \nKNIGHT Who did? \nSOLDIER Ask the monk. \nThe soldiers pull the iron and the chains. TYAN'S shaven head sways, gleaming in the moonlight. Her blackened mouth opens as if to scream, but no sound emerges. They take her down from the cart and lead her towards the ladder and the stake. The KNIGHT turns to the MONK, who remains seated in the cart. \nKNIGHT What have you done with the child? \nDEATH turns around and looks at him. \nDEATH Don't you ever stop asking questions? \nKNIGHT No, I'll never stop. \nThe soldiers chain TYAN to the rungs of the ladder. She submits resignedly, moans weakly like an animal and tries to ease her body into position. \n", "test3_id": 2276}

{"train": "P R E T T Y   W O M A N \nby Jonathan Lawton &  Stephen Metcalfe \nEXT. A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT \nThe view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house is extraordinary.  A small outdoor dinner party is in progress. \nA MAGICIAN is entertaining guests.  Playing cards and coins appear and disappear in his nimble hands. \nINT. HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT \nEDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down at the party.  Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around forty.  He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured by a night's sleep. \nEDWARD (a murmur) Left pocket. \nAnd indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer.  More laughter and applause. \nThe study is in keeping with the rest of the house.  Luxurious. Everything the best.  WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary, is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host.  VANCE is an investment banker.  His assistant JAKE, is a financial researcher.  The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS.  They are in dark suits and power ties.  On the table are stacks of documents and folders, the name \"KROSS INDUSTRIES\" is prominent on many of the folders. \nINVESTMENT BANKER 1 Our banks certainly doesn't want to discourage Harris Enterprises from investing in California. We think this is a great new venue for you but you've got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing. With the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk. \nVANCE Look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. We have over a thousand man hours in this deal. \nSTUCKEY (losing patience) This is a \"no brainer\".  There's no risk for you.  No one has ever lost money backing Mr. Harris. \nINVESTMENT BANKER 2 Not yet.  But ship building is a new endeavor for you... \nSTUCKEY (cuts him off) Come on.  You know we're not going to go into ship building. Besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us! \nINVESTMENT BANKER 3 Bill, be reasonable.  If you're really going to digest Kross Industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem. Besides, I don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have. \nEDWARD It's unacceptable. \nEdward turns from the window.  He hasn't miss a thing.  All eyes are on him. \nEDWARD Draymen Heux has offered me seventy-five in the pool at sixteen and a half.  I can secure the other half personally.  You have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer. \nThe bankers speechlessly stare at him. \nEDWARD The meeting is over, gentlemen. \nHe turns away.  The bankers look at one another.  They rise. Silence as they exit.  When the door closes.  Stuckey explodes with laughter. \nSTUCKEY Hah!  Did you see the look on their faces? \nVANCE You don't think we pushed too hard? \nSTUCKEY NO way!  They'll come back.  They can't afford not to.  Edward, that bluff was beautiful. \nEDWARD Maybe I should have made it rhyme. \nThe others stare at him, uncertain.  Stuckey laughs.  The others follow suit. \nEDWARD (looking at his watch) Well!  It's late.  We've been at this long enough. \nStuckey rises.  Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door. \nEDWARD Gentlemen, enjoy the party.  The magician's wonderful. \nVance and Jake exit. \nEDWARD (calling after them) Watch your left pocket. \nA BUTLER has entered the room. \nBUTLER Phone call, Mr. Harris.  It's Miss Charles. \nSTUCKEY Cynthia?  Is she coming out? \nEDWARD We're about to find out.  Go on. Take care of your guests. \nStuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone. \nEDWARD (into phone) Where are you, Cynthia? (beat) I see. (pausing, getting angry) No, I don't expect you to be at my beck-and-call.  Are you coming or not? \nINT. HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nEdward descends the long, curved stairway.  He has Vance in tow. \nEDWARD (all business) Prepare the filing papers.  Have them ready by the middle of the week.  I'll tell you when to submit them. \nThe PEOPLE talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate toward Edward. \nKIT I will.  I'm trying. (a beat) Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high? \nVIVIAN No, let's go to work.  Okay? \nKIT Okay. (then touches her hand) I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT \nEdward's Ferrari turns onto Hollywood Blvd., finally out of the Hollywood Hills. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT \nVivian and Kit are out trying to hustle John's in passing cars. Vivian strikes a sexy pose at the bus stop.  Kit is talking to another prostitute, RACHEL. \nKIT No no, honey.  You see these stars on the sidewalk.  Me and Vivian work from Don Ameche all the way up to Roy Rogers. This is our office.  We got seniority.  Get off our corner. \nRACHEL I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's new. (points to Vivian) \nKIT But I'm old.  Go rest up by Monty Hall or Debra Paget where you belong. \nRachel walks off. \nVIVIAN (looks at passing cars) Looks slow tonight. \nKIT Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and -- \nVIVIAN Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it. \nThey keep hustling. \nKIT I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home. \nVIVIAN (stares at her) That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on -- \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - ANGLE ON FERRARI - NIGHT \nKIT (O.S.) (suddenly) Hey, hey -- There's a rent. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - BACK TO SCENE - NIGHT \nVIVIAN He's not gonna want us. \nThe Ferrari goes by and stops. \nEDWARD (calls out to Vivian) Excuse me. \nKIT (excited) Don't take less than a hundred. You look hot tonight.  And remember, don't mouth off.  They don't like that. \nVIVIAN Okay.  Go home.  But take it easy on that shit. \nKit gives Vivian a quick hug. \nKIT You're the greatest.  I'll wait up for you. \nAnd then Kit is off, moving quickly away.  Vivian turns.  She stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents.  And then it's as if Vivian turns a switch.  She fluffs her mane of hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face. \nIn the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious and distracted.  Vivian leans over the passenger window. \nVIVIAN Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date? \nEDWARD What's that? \nVIVIAN You looking' for some company? \nEDWARD Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills? \nVIVIAN What? (dropping the come on) You gonna tell me you're lost? \nEDWARD Yes. \nVIVIAN Great.  What do I look like a tourguide? \nEdward takes a good look at her. \nEDWARD (a beat) No, you look like a hooker. \nVIVIAN Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk. \nEDWARD Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills? \nVIVIAN Sure.  For five bucks. \nEDWARD That's ridiculous. \nEdward hangs up.  He pours a glass of orange juice and takes a sip, thinking.  Something makes him turn.  Vivian, wearing a monogrammed hotel terry robe, is standing uncertainly in the bedroom doorway. \nEDWARD Good morning. \nVIVIAN You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute. \nEDWARD No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast? \nShe's hungry and the breakfast looks great. \nVIVIAN Only if you do. \nEdward sits.  Waits.  Vivian sits across from him.  Edward serves them breakfast. \nEDWARD Did you sleep well? \nVIVIAN Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was. \nEDWARD Occupational hazard? \nShe looks at him sharply, sees that he means no offense, relaxes. \nVIVIAN Where'd you go? \nEDWARD I took the couch.  I had some work to do. (hesitating) About last night... \nVIVIAN Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself. \nEDWARD Mmm, I could tell. \nVIVIAN I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks. \nEDWARD I'd say you give a good dollar value. \nThey share a small smile.  They eat. \nEDWARD Do you ever... enjoy it? \nVIVIAN I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm. \nEDWARD No?  Why's that? \nVIVIAN \"Occupational hazard\". \nA moment.  Edward chuckles.  Vivian grins. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) what do you do anyway? \nEDWARD I buy companies. \nVIVIAN No shit.  They expensive? \nHe almost smiles.  She almost smiles back. \nEDWARD The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million. \nVIVIAN ... dollars? \nHe nods.  This time Vivian is impressed. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) You are major league, baby.  Your mother must be very proud. \nEdward is oddly pleased at her reaction. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY \nThe closet door is open.  Edward reaches for a tie.  In the closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits, shirts, shoes, etc.  She follows him in. \nVIVIAN So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm? \nEDWARD (fumbling with the tie) I sell them. \nVIVIAN What?  Why? \nShe undoes his knot and starts over. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) At ease, let me do that.  Part of the all night services. \nEDWARD By breaking up a company's assets \nVIVIAN What are assets? \nEDWARD Vivian -- \nEDWARD Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500. \nVIVIAN But you want days too. \nEDWARD All right, two thousand. \nVIVIAN Three. \nEDWARD Done. \nVIVIAN Holy shit. \nAnd then, quickly getting herself back together, she flips on the sexy smile. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) Sugar, you got it.  I will treat you like a prince.  Anything, anyway you want. \nEDWARD I'm not just talking about sex. \nVIVIAN Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay? \nEDWARD Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING \nEdward comes out into the bedroom.  Vivian quickly follows. They move through the bedroom into the living room. \nEDWARD I'll be out most of the day. \nHe reaches into his pocket for a money clip.  He peels off bills.  He hands the cash to Vivian. \nEDWARD I want you to go out and buy some decent clothes. \nVivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money. \nEDWARD Nothing too flashy, not too sexy. Conservative.  Understand? \nINT. PENTHOUSE ENTRANCE WAY - DAY \nThey're at the front door. \nVIVIAN Yeah, you want me to dress like your high class girlfriend. You're wasting your money though. All I'm gonna do is hang around the hotel.  As a matter of fact, I may never get out of that bathtub. \nEdward opens the door, he starts to exit.  He turns back. \nEDWARD Think again.  I'm taking you out to an important dinner with me tonight. \nThe door closes in her face. \nINT. OUTSIDE THE PENTHOUSE DOOR - DAY \nVIVIAN (O.S.) (from inside) What?  Are you crazy? \nEdward smiles to himself. \nEDWARD Probably. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY \nVivian is stretched out in the hot bubble bath.  The TV is on. She clicks the remote control in her hand. \nVIVIAN Three thousand... \nShe lies back into the soapy water and disappears.  She suddenly pops back up, laughing. \nVIVIAN Three thousand! \nA thought occurs to her.  She reaches for the cordless phone. She dials.  She waits.  She is about to disconnect when the phone is answered. \nKIT (O.S.) 'Lo. \nVIVIAN Kit!  Where've you been? \nKIT (O.S.) I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay? \nVIVIAN Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything! (silence) Kit?  Hey, you there? \nKIT (O.S.) Why'd he want you? \nThat hurts.  Perhaps because Vivian's been wondering the same thing. \nVIVIAN He... he just does. \nKIT (O.S.) I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back. (a beat) Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'? \nMR. THOMAS And who is that? \nVIVIAN I... Edward... \nVivian's face is filled with confusion.  She doesn't know his name.  The elevator doors open behind them.  She spots the Operator. \nVIVIAN (blurting it out) He knows me. \nMr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously.  The Operator looks back at them innocently.  With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas waves the Operator over. \nMR. THOMAS Do you know this young lady? \nThe Operator nods. \nOPERATOR She's with Mr. Harris. \nMR. THOMAS (surprised) Mr. Harris? \nOPERATOR She apparently joined him last night. \nMr. Thomas waves the Operator away. \nMR. THOMAS Why don't you come with me.  We'll chat for just a moment. \nHe takes Vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off. \nINT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY \nIn a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk. \nMR. THOMAS What's your name? \nVIVIAN Vivian. \nMR. THOMAS Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. \nVivian says nothing. \nMR. THOMAS (cont'd) Mr. Harris, however, is a very special customer.  And we like to think of our special customers as friends.  As a customer, we would expect Mr. Harris to sign in any additional guests.  But as a friend, we're willing to overlook it, I'm assuming you're a... relative? \nVivian finds herself nodding. \nMR. THOMAS (cont'd) I thought so.  You must be his...? \nVIVIAN Niece? \nMR. THOMAS Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again. \nVivian bites her lower lip, nods. \nMR. THOMAS (cont'd) Good.  We understand one another. (as a gentle afterthought:) I would also encourage you to dress in a more appropriate manner. \nVivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry. \nVIVIAN That's what I was trying to do. \nShe can't help it, the tears come.  Vivian pulls out the money Edward gave her.  She drops it on the desk.  It's a moist- looking wad now. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) I was trying to get some other clothes... but... they wouldn't... they made me feel like shit... \nShe can't go on.  Mr. Thomas politely glances at the money. He unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her.  He sighs. He picks up the phone.  He dials. \nMR. THOMAS (into the phone) Women's clothing. (beat) Bridget, please. \nVivian is staring at him. \nMR. THOMAS (cont'd) Bridget, hello, this is Barnard Thomas over at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.  Well, thank you, that's flattering.  I'd like to ask a favor of you.  I'm going to send someone over.  Her name is Vivian. She's a guest of ours.  A very special guest. \nHe glances at Vivian.  With those simple words, he'd made her feel better. \nMR. THOMAS (cont'd) She's from out of town and she needs a little help in dressing. Perhaps you could help her out. Thank you very much.  She'll be right over. \nHe sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at Vivian. \nMR. THOMAS (cont'd) There you are.  If you have any other problems, come ask for me personally.  I'm Mr. Thomas. \nVIVIAN Barney. \nShe smiles mischievously. \nEXT. FORT OF LOS ANGELES - DAY \nA sleek corporate helicopter flies over the port. \nBridget leads Vivian towards the racks of clothes.  She pulls out a dress. \nBRIDGET Your uncle will like this. \nVIVIAN He's not really my uncle. \nBRIDGET They never are, dear. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON \nMr. Thomas is behind the desk.  He looks up.  Vivian is standing there, a happy look on her face.  She holds up a garment bag. \nVIVIAN I got a dress. \nMR. THOMAS (dryly) I rather hoped you'd be wearing it. \nVIVIAN I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see? \nMR. THOMAS That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely. \nVIVIAN They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney. \nMr. Thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity. \nMR. THOMAS You're very welcome, Miss Vivian. \nShe smiles at him.  He watches as Vivian turns and walks toward the elevator.  The provocative way her hips move just naturally attracts the attention of a MALE PASSERBY.  And the white gloved ELEVATOR MAN literally leaps to press the elevator button for Vivian who rewards him with a happy smile.  Mr. Thomas sighs. \nINT. PENTHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe phone is ringing Vivian enters.  She hurries to pick it up. \nVIVIAN Hello? \nThe phone keeps ringing -- it has more than one line.  Vivian frantically punches buttons. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) Hello?  What?  Hello? \nINT. STUCKEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON - INTERCUT \nEdward is in a private office. \nEDWARD Never answer the phone.  Ever. \nVIVIAN Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time. \nEDWARD Did you buy some clothes? \nVIVIAN I got a dress, yeah. \nEDWARD Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate. \nVIVIAN It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch. (silence) I'm -- joking. \nEDWARD Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it? \nVIVIAN No, I don't \"got it\".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date. \nEDWARD This isn't a date. \nVIVIAN Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway? \nEDWARD The Rex. \nVIVIAN Any good? \nEDWARD I think you'll approve. \nVIVIAN ... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to. \nEDWARD Thank you very much. \nVivian slowly sets the phone down.  The phone rings again. Vivian, very carefully, punches the flashing button and picks it up. \nVIVIAN Hello? \nEDWARD I thought I told you not to answer the phone. \nVIVIAN Oooh! \nEdward hangs up.  He smiles to himself. \nVivian bites her fingernails, looking nervous.  The doorbell RINGS.  Vivian looks up, startled.  She rises, moves to answer it. \nVIVIAN What if they serve soup? \nMR. THOMAS They will serve salad. \nVIVIAN But what if they serve soup? \nMR. THOMAS Then you use your soup spoon. \nVIVIAN (smiles) I like steak. \nMR. THOMAS (picking up the appropriate utensil) Then you would use your-- \nVIVIAN Steak spoon! (laughs) \nMr. Thomas swallows his exasperation. \nWE PULL BACK from their table to reveal the cavernous, empty banquets room, each table is set and ready for the dinner service. \nMR. THOMAS Miss Vivian -- \nVIVIAN Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands. \nMR. THOMAS Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead? \nVIVIAN Professionally? \nINT. SALON - LATE AFTERNOON \nVivian sits in a salon chair.  The last customer, THANE, a young man of about twenty with his long hair pulled back in a pony tail, tilts her head one way and then another, eyeing her professionally. \nVIVIAN I have a friend who has a friend who does Cher's wigs. \nTHANE I hate him already. (a beat) All set? \nVIVIAN Yeah... what a ya say we chop it all off and bleach the tips. \nTHANE Darling?  Trust me. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING \nEdward enters and looks around the lobby.  No Vivian.  Annoyed. Edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up.  He's about to dial when: \nMR. THOMAS Good evening, Mr. Harris. \nEdward looks at him blankly. \nMR. THOMAS Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel. \nEDWARD Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment -- \nMR. THOMAS I have a message for you from your \"niece\", sir. \nEDWARD My what? \nMR. THOMAS The young lady staying in your room? \nEdward's eyes narrow.  He hangs up the phone. \nEDWARD I think we both know she's not my niece. \nMr. Thomas looks uncomfortable. \nEDWARD (cont'd) Does this hotel have any problem with that? \nMR. THOMAS Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge. \nEDWARD Thank you. \nHe starts towards the lounge. \nMR. THOMAS Very intriguing young woman, Miss Vivian. \nHis tone stops Edward in his tracks. \nMR. THOMAS (cont'd) Have a good evening, sir. \nAnd off he goes, leaving Edward to wonder what the hell transpired during the afternoon. \nINT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT \nEdward enters the lounge.  He looks around, not seeing Vivian. And suddenly his eyes go back to... the beautiful girl with the beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress at the piano bar.  Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian rises, moves elegantly towards him.  She smiles. \nVIVIAN You're late. \nVivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table.  Everyone looks to her. \nVIVIAN Slippery little suckers... \nKross rises. \nKROSS If you'll excuse me young lady, Mr. Harris... (turns to David) Deal with this, David, you know where we stand.  I need to go someplace and puke. \nHe rises.  He exits. \nDAVID (to Edward and Vivian) Men like my father built this country.  He was no saint.  He screwed people.  But for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job. \nEdward is silent. \nVIVIAN He seems like a nice man. \nDavid looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time. \nEDWARD We can reach an understanding on this. \nDAVID I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have. \nEDWARD Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally. \nDAVID I do.  I take it all very personally. (to Vivian) Very nice meeting you, Vivian. \nDavid Kross gets up and leaves.  Vivian and Edward sit in silence. \nEDWARD (a beat) And that's the way the game is played. \nVIVIAN Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement. \nEdward says nothing.  But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve. \nVIVIAN Snails for dinner.  No wonder everybody is in such a bad mood. \nA Waiter appears at the table. \nWAITER Are we ready for the next course, sir? \nEDWARD No.  Bring a check, please. \nINT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEdward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of the glass window down at the city lights.  He quickly drains his champagne glass.  Vivian moves to stand next to him. She refills his glass from the bottle. \nEDWARD Thank you. \nHe drinks.  Silence. \nVIVIAN You're upset, huh? \nEDWARD Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business. \nVIVIAN You liked the guy, though. \nEDWARD Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive. \nVIVIAN (excited) We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it. (realizing what she's saying and quickly recovers) Except with you.  At your price I give my all... \nEdward laughs. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) Let's not talks about this heavy stuff.  Come on, relax. \nVivian comes up behind him.  She begins to rub his shoulders. \nEDWARD That... is very good. \nA moment.  Edward is silent.  Turns him, unknots his tie, unbuttons his collar. \nVIVIAN Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television. \nEDWARD Television? \nVIVIAN Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all. \nEDWARD I have work to do. \nVIVIAN Uh-uh.  No work. \nSmiling, she softly kisses his throat. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) See... what you haven't figured out yet... \nVANCE Kross came out of his corner swinging.  He started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened. \nEDWARD (almost to himself) He's a tough old son of a bitch... \nEdward is watching Vivian.  She pulls the hem of her skirt up to mid thigh.  She looks hopefully over to Edward.  Edward shakes his head. \nVANCE It's up to ten and a quarter. \nEDWARD Offer nine and a half.  Bring them back down to earth. \nSTUCKEY Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight? \nEDWARD Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away. \nSTUCKEY Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry. \nThere is a sudden hesitation in Edward's eyes.  He watches as Vivian tries on a hat.  She preens for him.  He smiles. \nEDWARD (to Vance & Stuckey) Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise. \nSTUCKEY (surprised) We're letting them slide? \nEDWARD I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now. \nSTUCKEY But, Edward... \nEDWARD Do it. \nEdward hangs up and takes a long look at Vivian.  She moves to him. \nEDWARD (looks at his watch) You're on your own now, Vivian. I've got to get to work.  Be sensible and you can keep everything.  Spend too much and it all goes back. \nVivian hugs him again. \nEXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY \nVivian walks along Rodeo Drive.  She looks lovely in the pink dress and new, white shoes.  A pretty, white hat is the final touch.  She carries a bag containing her old clothes.  She stops at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away. \nINT. TORIE STEELE BOUTIQUE - SHOPPING MONTAGE \nWe SEES Vivian in each department within the store with different SALESPEOPLE.  She happily and confidently tries on a variety of dresses, hats, shoes, accesarries, etc. \n1)  Vivian is in a dressing stall.  She tosses a dress out to a waiting SALESWOMAN. \nVIVIAN Not me! \n2)  A SALESWOMAN holds a long, purple evening gown. \nVIVIAN (imitating Bridget) Horrid! \n3)  Vivian is admiring a pair of beautiful suede dress pumps. Her attention is drawn to the SALESMEN'S exotic hand-painted tie. \nVIVIAN Where'd you get your tie? \n4)  Vivian stands in front of an enormous tie rack with the Salesman, a dozen wild, swirling designed ties are hanging over his outstretched arm.  Vivian picks out the brightest one and smiles. \nEXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY \nVivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags.  She feels like she owns the block.  A well-dressed MAN passes by, smiling politely.  Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores him. \nSuddenly Vivian stops.  She's about to pass the shop she was thrown out of.  Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop. \nINT. BOUTIQUE - DAY \nVivian enters.  The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's courage leaves her. \nThe saleswoman is waiting on a CUSTOMER. \nSALESWOMAN (to the customer) Isn't this lovely?  I think it would look wonderful on you. \nVivian musters her courage.  She takes a deep breath and starts forward. \nSALESWOMAN (to her customer) Would you like to try it on? \nVIVIAN 'Scume me. \nBoth the saleswoman and her customer look up.  The saleswoman smiles pleasantly. \nSALESWOMAN Yes? \nVIVIAN Do you remember me? \nSALESWOMAN No, I'm sorry, I don't. \nVivian softly traces small patterns on Edward's shoulders with a finger. \nVIVIAN You still mad at'm? \nEDWARD He died a long time ago. \nShe gently rests her head on his back. \nEXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nPANNING BELLIES  People are sunbathing by the pool. Overweight... lobster red... old and stretch-marked... fishy white... and then gorgeous.  The gorgeous is Vivian.  She is wearing a miniscule bikini and sunglasses. \nWAITER (O.S.) Miss Vivian? \nShe looks up.  A young WAITER, looking a little dry-mouthed at the sight of her, is holding a telephone. \nWAITER You have a call.  Mr. Harris. \nVIVIAN (taking the phone) Hi, baby. (a moment) I'll be ready.  Bye. \nShe hangs up.  She looks at the Waiter, confused. \nVIVIAN What do you wear to polo? \nEXT. THE LOS ANGELES EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON \nHorses and riders crash and careen on the playing field.  An enthusiastic crowd cheers. \nDOWN OFF THE EDGE OF THE FIELD \na tailgate party using Cadillacs and Rolls Royces is in progress.  Horses and riders thunder by a crowd of very well-dressed, successful-looking people -- celebrities, execs, socialites, aficionados -- most of whom ignore the game.  They are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo match. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATER AFTERNOON \nVivian and Edward make their way towards the party.  Edward is wearing his new tie.  Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful in one of her new outfits.  Not that it's helping -- the place, the people, the wealth -- everything here suddenly has her overwhelmed.  She suddenly stops. \nVIVIAN You're really pushing it, bringing me here. \nEDWARD I think it's exciting. \nVIVIAN What id we run into someone I know? \nEDWARD I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard. \nVIVIAN You did. \nA VOICE calls out. \nSTUCKEY (O.S.) Edward! \nThey turn.  William Stuckey is with a group of people.  He waves them over. \nSTUCKEY (cont'd) Come on!  Over here! \nEdward takes Vivian's arm and leads her forward. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON \nStuckey grins and shakes Edward's hand. \nSTUCKEY (looking at Vivian) Well, well, well... \nVivian dislikes this guy on sight.  Dislikes the frosty looking woman at his side. \nEDWARD Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian. \nSTUCKEY (holding out a hand; smiling) Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth. \nVIVIAN Hi. \nElizabeth Stuckey stretches her thin lips in a cold smile. \nSTUCKEY Lots of fun people here.  Let me get you two some champagne. \nHe moves quickly away. \nELIZABETH STUCKEY Excuse me. \nShe moves to greet someone else.  Vivian and Edward survey the milling CROWD. \nVIVIAN (sarcastic) Real genuine guy. \nEDWARD He's good at what he does. \nDAVID Thunder's a horse.  Come on. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThey approach the sweating mount.  David Kross caresses the horses muzzle. \nDAVID Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian. (a beat; and then:) You two been together long?  You and Edward? \nVIVIAN No. \nDAVID Hope to be? \nTo Vivian's surprise, the question causes a pang inside. \nVIVIAN It's... it's not like that. \nDAVID I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then. \nVivian is suddenly silent.  She looks away. \nDAVID (cont'd) I'm sorry, am I being too forward? \nVIVIAN You don't know anything about me. \nDAVID I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch. \nBut something holds Vivian back, a feeling. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - IN THE CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON \nWilliam Stuckey turns... stops... stares.  He sees Vivian and David Kross standing together.  He stares, his mind racing, and anxious, angry look on his face. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON \nStuckey has Edward off to the side.  He is talking to him in a low, earnest voice. \nSTUCKEY Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet? \nEDWARD We just did. \nSTUCKEY (grinning) Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this. \nEDWARD The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions. \nSTUCKEY And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work? \nEDWARD Yes... \nSTUCKEY Doing what? \nEDWARD Vivian's in sales. \nSTUCKEY Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell? \nEdward's eyes narrow. \nEDWARD Why do you want to know? \nSTUCKEY Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN \nVivian turns away from the bar, now holding two glasses of champagne.  She scans the crowd for Edward. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON EDWARD AND STUCKEY \nEDWARD She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie. \nSTUCKEY So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient. \nEDWARD You're being ridiculous. \nSTUCKEY Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information? \nEDWARD Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN \nas she hear loud sudden LAUGHTER.  She turns.  She sees that it's Stuckey laughing.  Smiling, Vivian starts towards them with two glasses of champagne. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON STUCKEY AND EDWARD \nSTUCKEY I swear to God, you are the only millionaire I ever heard of who'd go looking for a goddam bargain streetwalker! \nVivian stands quietly for a moment.  And then she turns and walks into the bedroom. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT \nVivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light of the bedroom.  As she does she starts crying.  With each item of clothing the tears come down harder.  Edward appears at the doorway.  His face is genuinely concerned. \nEDWARD Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you. \nVIVIAN I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off. \nEDWARD I really am sorry. \nVivian lets the clothes fall from her arms.  Sobbing, she stands limply. \nVIVIAN You hurt me. \nEdward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders. She touches his hand.  He sits on the bed.  He pulls her to him and wraps his arms around her, holds her tight. \nEDWARD I'll make it up to you. \nINT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY \nEdward, carrying a briefcase, moves jauntily down a long hallway.  Stuckey trails after him. \nSTUCKEY This is no time to disappear. We're in too far. \nEDWARD Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow. \nSTUCKEY Promise me you'll read those contracts by then. \nEDWARD Goodbye, Bill. \nStuckey stops.  He calls after Edward. \nSTUCKEY Shit... By tomorrow, Edward! \nEdward hurries on. \nEXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY \nEdward exits out of his limo and walks to the front doors. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nEdward smiles, moving jauntily to the elevators.  Mr. Thomas at the front desk notices Edward's happy mood. \nMR. THOMAS Good afternoon, Mr. Harris. \nEDWARD Afternoon. \nEdward's attention is taken by the glittering jewelry display in the hotel jewelry store window.  He detours from the elevators and moves to the window for a closer look.  He thinks a moment and enters the jewelry store. \nINT. PENTHOUSE - AFTERNOON \nVivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing an elegant red sequined evening dress.  She looks incredibly beautiful.  She sees the phone.  A thought occurs to her and going to it, she picks it up.  Waits. \nVIVIAN C'mon, Kit... \nNo answer.  She hears someone at the door.  She hangs up. Edward enters.  He is carrying a small case.  He stops at the sight of Vivian. \nVIVIAN Do I look okay? \nEDWARD (a small smile) Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing. \nHe holds up the small case. \nVIVIAN What's that? \nEDWARD I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however... \nVivian's jaw drops.  Edward is holding a diamond and ruby necklace in his hands, holds it as if it might melt if he breathed too hard.  Edward behind Vivian, fastens the necklace around her neck. \nEDWARD This is made for a princess. I think she'd approve of you wearing it tonight.  There. Come look. \nHe leads her to a mirror.  She stares at her reflection. \nVIVIAN Edward, I can't. \nEDWARD Shush.  Of course you can. \nVIVIAN What if I lose it? \nEDWARD You won't. \nINT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT \nEdward puts his hand on Vivian's elbow as they walk through the elegant lobby. \nEDWARD Some people say that opera is an acquired taste, but I don't believe it.  You can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time.  They either love it or hate it.  Those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate it, but they'll never truly love it. \nVivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit fountain with several graceful statues in its center. Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and prosperous looking MEN.  It makes her nervous.  Without realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace. She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and steal it. \nEDWARD Viv?  I really doubt if anyone here is going to try and grab it. \nVivian reluctantly lowers her hands. \nINT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT \nA crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading toward their seats.  Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes -- curious, even envious looks from the WOMEN, appreciative glances from the MEN.  Her hands again rises nervously to her necklace. \nEDWARD They all think you look very beautiful, Vivian. \nVivian gives him a grateful look.  Relaxing, she lowers her hand from the necklace.  With a flourish, he offers his arm.  She takes it.  They start forward. \nINT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT \nEdward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the stage. \nVIVIAN If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying? \nEDWARD I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words. \nVIVIAN But don't they have it in English? \nEDWARD Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it. \nThe lights dim. \nVIVIAN (resigned) Okay.  Even if I hate it, I'm glad you brought me. \nThe orchestra begins to play.  Vivian's eyes focus intensely on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her. \nINT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHT \nIN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed. \nThe lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face.  Edward leans over to translate the tenor's aria. \nEDWARD What am I?  I am a poet.  Not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams.  You have come to replace my vanished dreams.  I dwell now only in your eyes. \nThe MUSIC ebbs and swells.  The sets and costumes change.  The story continues. \nEdward again leans close to Vivian. \nEDWARD And now she asks Rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful -- \nVivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth.  Her eyes are fixed on the stage.  She doesn't need his help. \nThe emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is reaching its tragic climax.  Her lips tremble.  Her eyes fill with tears.  Edward glances at her.  He studies her a long moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face. Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand. \nAs the opera ends, they are both swept away by it. \nINT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT \nAs the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined mascara.  She sighs, happy.  The WOMEN in the next box smile at her. \nOLDER WOMAN Did you enjoy the opera, dear? \nVIVIAN (tearfully) It was so beautiful I just about pissed my pants. \nEdward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he and the still misty Vivian exit. \nINT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT - LATER \nEdward and Vivian sit side by side. \nEDWARD If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you. \nVIVIAN I more than liked it. \nEDWARD I know.  I'm glad. \nVIVIAN Did you? \nEDWARD Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you. \nVivian looks at him a moment.  And then, leaning slowly forward she kisses him gently on the mouth.  He looks at her surprise. He puts his arms around her and kisses her back.  It is the first time they've kissed and they make it very special. \nEDWARD (cont'd) What is it? \nVIVIAN (not unkindly) What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town? \nEDWARD It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that? \nVIVIAN I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it... \nShe is silent. \nEDWARD Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution. \nVIVIAN (shakes her head \"no,\" then continues tying his tie) When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, \"Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo.\" \nShe finished his tie. \nEDWARD Vivian, life's not a fairy tale. \nVIVIAN (softly; to herself) I know. (a beat) Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid. (more) I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore. \nEDWARD I've never treated you like a whore. \nVIVIAN (not mean) You just did. \nThe doorbell suddenly rings in the living room. \nINT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY \nEdward enters the living room.  Vivian slowly enters behind him.  Edward opens the front door.  Mr. Kross slowly enters. He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask his surprise. \nKROSS Mr. Harris. \nEDWARD How are you, Mr. Kross. \nKROSS Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it. \nAn angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father. Stuckey brings up the rear.  Edward and David give one another perfunctory nod.  Stuckey smugly winks at Edward.  Edward closes the door and leads them all down the stairs. \nVivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance.  He gently nods at Vivian. \nKROSS Young lady. \nVIVIAN Hello. (to David) Hi. \nDAVID Hello, Vivian. \nSTUCKEY Let's not waste time here, shall we?  Mr. Kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with Mr. Harris.  Mr. Harris is now listening. \nKross has to fight down his humiliation at Stuckey's tone.  He turns to Edward. \nKROSS Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer. \nEDWARD Expected... offer. \nKROSS Of course, yes.  After the expected filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid. \nEDWARD (a moment) You're making the right decision, sir. \nStuckey glances triumphantly at Edward.  He is surprised to see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face. Edward is silent.  Kross interprets his silence as second thoughts. \nKROSS I'll see you on one condition. I'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me... \nVivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man. \nSTUCKEY (quickly) They'll be taken care of.  Won't they, Edward? \nKross ignores Stuckey.  He looks to Edward.  Edward slowly nods. \nKROSS I'll sign anything you want then. \nSTUCKEY Today. \nKross nods tiredly.  His voice is very soft. \nKROSS Today. \nVivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom, obviously upset.  The men all watch her go.  Edward hesitates. He turns to Kross: \nEDWARD Excuse me, please? \nHe heads to the bedroom. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY \nVIVIAN Kit... \nKIT Everybody keeps starin' at me. \nVIVIAN Yeah... I know what you mean. \nKIT What do you know?  You look good. All dressed up. (meaning it) You clean up real nice. (giggling) You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway. \nVIVIAN You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you? \nKIT Where do you fit? \nVivian is silent, then. \nVIVIAN (suddenly) I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth. \nKIT Honey, you're not supposed to do that. \nVIVIAN I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real. \nKIT Oh, my god, you mean it was good? \nVIVIAN (miserably) It was great. \nKIT Dummy. \nVIVIAN He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money. \nKIT I pray for that. \nVIVIAN (nods) All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit? \nKIT Go for the bucks. \nVIVIAN I don't care about bucks. (a beat) I might love this guy. \nKIT Wow, are you in deep shit. (a sigh) You know he'll break your heart. \nVivian is silent again. \nKIT (cont'd) I blame myself here.  First time I laid eyes on ya', I knew you were too complicated to be a whore. \nVivian nods.  Her face is filled with confusion. \nINT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nEdward stands at the window looking out.  There is something about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of the story. \nJake enters, a pile of papers under his arm.  He begins laying them out on the conference table. \nJAKE Congratulations, sir. \nEDWARD What? \nJAKE Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won. \nEdward says nothing. \nJAKE Who are you going after next, sir? \nEDWARD Who indeed... \nHe turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter the room.  They surround a conference table.  Kross sits, the papers laid out in front of him.  Stuckey hands Kross a pen. A SECRETARY lays out finger food.  They wait for her to leave before they speak. \nSTUCKEY If we can get these letters of intent out of the way now... Mr. Harris and I would like to ask you some questions about your company. \nDAVID Dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate.  You're under no obligation to answer any questions at all. \nKROSS Could we at least wait till after the filing period? \nStuckey glances to Edward for help.  Edward is silent; indeed it's as if something is twisting inside of him.  Stuckey plunges ahead. \nSTUCKEY Mr. Harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth.  The price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid.  The more we know, the higher our bid can be. \nKROSS It's in my best interest to cooperate, David. \nDAVID If he throws himself on your sword, you promise to take care of him and his family, huh? \nDavid stares at him. \nSTUCKEY That's unfair! \nDAVID You bed it is. (to Edward) You're everything he said you were. (to his father) Do what you have to do, Dad. Just don't expect me to watch it. \nThere is a bar set up.  Stuckey sets his briefcase down.  He crosses to the bar. \nSTUCKEY (cont'd) Mind if I have a drink? \nVIVIAN No. \nHe pours liquor in a glass.  He fires it down.  It seems to calm him a bit. \nSTUCKEY Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why? (pours another drink) What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities. \nVIVIAN I think it's great. \nStuckey glares at Vivian. \nSTUCKEY I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal. \nVIVIAN (mocking) Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business. \nHe looks at her a moment. \nSTUCKEY But what do I know, maybe you're worth it.  Come on, show me. Let's see your act. \nHe grabs her wrist. \nVIVIAN Get out! \nSTUCKEY Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are you a fifty dollar whore? \nHe tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top of him. \nVIVIAN Are you crazy? \nShe bites his hand.  Stuckey slaps her.  Vivian starts flailing back.  But Stuckey is too strong.  Vivian staggers back at the force of another slap.  Stuckey slams her up against a wall and starts rubbing up against her. \nSTUCKEY You got a mean streak in you, don't you. \nHe tries to kiss her again. \nSTUCKEY (cont'd) Is that what he likes about you? Huh?  Answer me! \nAnd suddenly a HAND lands on Stuckey's shoulder.  Stuckey turns his head, startled. \nINT. PENTHOUSE - REVERSE ANGLE - STUCKEY'S P.O.V. \nEdward, murder in his eyes, belts Stuckey across the room. \nINT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT - BACK TO SCENE \nStuckey falls on the ground.  Edward rushes forward, berserk with rage, to hit Stuckey again.  His fist hits the top of Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull. \nVivian rushes out of room to bathroom.  Again Stuckey tries to rise.  Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into the bar.  Glasses and bottles CRASH to the floor.  Stuckey again tries to rise.  And collapses.  Edward rubs his fist.  They're not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting. \nSTUCKEY You broke my nose. \nEDWARD I think I broke my hand. (a beat) You're fired. \nSTUCKEY Edward, we've been together ten years. \nEDWARD And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole! \nSTUCKEY All this because of that whore! \nEDWARD Yes. \nEdward pushes Stuckey out the door and throws his briefcase after him. \nSTUCKEY Edward, think about what you're \nEdward slams the door in his face.  Edward stands there, reflecting on what he's done. \nEDWARD (to himself, almost proud) Well, I didn't plan that! \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nEdward holds an icepack to Vivian's cheek. \nVIVIAN Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off! \nEDWARD Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore. \nVIVIAN Right. (softening) You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'? (a beat) I heard what you did with Kross. \nEDWARD It was a business decision. \nThe driver, confused, watches her hurry up the steps to the apartment building.  He drives off. \nINT. APARTMENT LOBBY - DAY \nVivian walks toward her apartment.  The Landlord is sitting at the front desk in a dirty undershirt. \nLANDLORD Hey, we announce guests here. You a relative of somebody? \nVivian lowers her sunglasses. \nLANDLORD (cont'd) Viv -- is that you? \nVIVIAN Yeah, it's me. \nShe keeps walking. \nLANDLORD You lookin' good, Viv'.  Nice threads.  I gotta find time to shop. \nINT. PENTHOUSE - DAY \nEdward stands at the penthouse window, looking out.  He is dressed now, ready for travel.  There is something about his expression, his somber demeanor that suggests the way we saw him at the very top of the story.  A BELLMAN enters from the bedroom, rolling a luggage loaded dolly along in front of him. \nBELLMAN Is that everything, sir? \nEDWARD (turning from the window) That's everything. \nThe Bellman exits, closing the door behind him.  The phone rings.  Edward crosses to it, picks it up.  The Maid comes in, looks around. \nMAID The lady, she go? \nEDWARD Yes.  She go. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nEdward with the Bellhop heads to the front door.  He's leaving. \nBELLHOP Do you have a car taking you to the airport, sir? \nEDWARD Yes. \nINT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY \nVivian, looking fresh scrubbed without make-up, is wearing clean jeans, a nice looking shirt and a suit jacket.  Her bureau's are open.  She is packing.  Kit is watching.  She takes the photo of her and Kit dressed up hot in hooker clothes and packs it. \nKIT So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco? \nVIVIAN Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be. \nKIT What kind of school? \nVIVIAN School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know. \nKIT So did I.  I made it with the principal. (recites) Study hard And get a \"B.\"  Lift your dress and an \"A\" you'll see. \nThey both laugh but too hard. \nVIVIAN Want a pair of boots? \nKIT Do I!?  Momma! \nTaking them, she sits on the bed and puts them on. \nVIVIAN You sure you won't come with me? \nKIT And leave all this?  Not in a million. \nThey laugh together. \nKIT (cont'd) What time's your bus? \nVIVIAN Couple a hours. \nKIT Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy. \nVIVIAN Cool your jets a second. (going to her purse) Here's some money. \nKIT No.  You took care of rent, that's enough. \nVIVIAN I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away. \nKIT I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day. \nThey hug. \n", "test1_input": "EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT \nThe Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN, stops.  Edward gets out of the car.  He looks at the street signs.  He has no idea where he is.  He signs.  He gets back in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East. \nEXT. A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT \nA crumbling old apartment building.  Dark alley ways, deserted parking lot. \nThe Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building, looking very out of place on the street. \nPANNING UP  A building facade of lit windows and metal fire escape.  One window in particular.  A GIRL stands there in a short kimono, looking down.  And then she turns away. \nINT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA SERIES OF SHOTS to see her dressing. \nINT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nVIVIAN turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom mirror.  She is twenty years old and a prostitute.  Make-up applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed. She'd be innocently beautiful without it.  She is wearing tiny shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots.  She stares at herself, not really liking what she sees.  A moment.  She signs, turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT \nFaded, peeling walls.  Thread bare, dirty carpet.  Vivian locks the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway. A door suddenly opens, startling her.  An unshaved, enormously pot bellied MAN in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig eyes. \nLANDLORD Vivian. \nVivian turns some \"tough\" on him. \nVIVIAN Yeah, what? \nLANDLORD Rent.  You're late. \nVIVIAN Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash. \nLANDLORD Kit give me nothin'. \nVIVIAN (suddenly uncertain) You bullshittin' me? \nLANDLORD Of rent I do not bullshit. \nVivian hurries at a run back down the hallway. \nLANDLORD By the end of the week or you're otta here. (a beat) By the way, you look very nice tonight! \nINT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN \nVivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf.  She pulls off the top. It's empty.  She tosses the can away, starts for the door.  She opens it. \nINT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nDown the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open doorway, talking to a FAT WOMAN.  They both glance up. \nVivian quickly closes the door.  She doesn't want to deal with them. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nVivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk.  She hurried away. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT \nVivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone. \nA BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself. He wears an \"I Love Hollywood\" t-shirt. \nVivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle in a doorway. \nA LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little bags to various STREET-TYPES. \nA BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie star.  Some go in. \nVivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS. A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her.  A car passes.  The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest.  She ignores him.  The black prostitute approaches the car. \nPROSTITUTE Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date? \nThe Driver looks her over.  The Black Prostitute gets in the car and it drives away. \nA GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night coffee shop.  They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS as Vivian hurries by.  She ignores them and goes next door into a falafel stand.  Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside. \nINT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT \nBehind the counter are a MAN and a WOMAN, Vietnamese cooks frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the shop. \nVIVIAN Chan, you seen Kit tonight? \n", "test1_true": "VIVIAN You do, tell her I'm looking for her. \nCOOK 2 Looking good, bay-bee. \nVIVIAN Yeah, you too, D'Nai.  If Kit comes in here, tell her stay. \nBoth of them nod and smile at Vivian.  Vivian exits. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT \nSkateboard zips by a GROUP.  We SEE a police car parked at the entrance to an alcove.  Also, an ambulance.  The bubblegum lights are going.  A CROWD has gathered.  The happy man with the \"I Love Hollywood\" t-shirt and a POLICE OFFICER are engaged in tense conversation. \nCOP They just pulled her out of a dumpster in the back.  Now talk to me. \nMAN I tell you, man, I don't know who she hang with. \nCOP She have a pimp? \nMAN Cocaine her pimp, man.  She a strawberry.  She be out on these streets, day in, day out, tradin' her sorry ass for crack.  And now she dead from it. \nVivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body of a YOUNG GIRL is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried towards the waiting ambulance.  For a moment Vivian thinks it's... no, Vivian turns grimly away. \nVivian surveys the dark street.  And suddenly sees who's she's looking for.  Walks. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIG SHOP - NIGHT \nWe SEE a young, tough-looking MAN and WOMAN trying on wigs. The STOREKEEPER is a man wearing a dress and wild wig.  The girl, KIT, is around 18, is dark haired and thin.  The young man, CARLOS, has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder. They giggle about something, both obviously high.  Kit looks up, bleary-eyed.  She stops.  Vivian is standing in front of her. \nVIVIAN You spent it on drugs, didn't you? \nKIT Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv. \nCARLOS Lookin' good, baby. \nVIVIAN (ignoring him) Did you blow it all, Kit?  Is it all gone? \nKIT Carlos had some great rock. \nVIVIAN I bet. (beat) That was our rent! \nCarlos attempts to put an arm around Vivian's shoulders. \nCARLOS Calm down, Chica. \nVivian throws him off. \nCARLOS Ey!  What is it you wan', baby? I can fix you up. \nVIVIAN Beat it, scum bucket! \nCARLOS You kiss your mother with that mouth?  Your frien' still owes me 200. \nVIVIAN (to Kit) Let's go. \nSkateboard appears suddenly, blocking Vivian and Kit's path. \nVIVIAN Get out of my face or I'll have those cops on your ass in two seconds. \nCarlos glares at her.  He looks down toward the lights of the cop cars.  One of the POLICEMEN looks towards them, curiously. Vivian waves at the cop. \nCARLOS (threatening to Vivian) Don't take no dates tonight, chica, you got one with me. \nVivian grabs Kit by the arm and pulls her across the Boulevard. \nINT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT \nVivian and Kit sit at a table sipping tea.  Vivian is still mad at her. \nVIVIAN We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street. \nKIT Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores. \nVivian looks like she wants to weep.  Or scream.  She does neither.  She slowly nods.  Kit's sorry she said that. \nKIT (cont'd) So I blew our stash.  We could make it all back with one good night on the streets. \nVIVIAN I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight? \nKIT Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise. \nVIVIAN I thought you were giving up that drug shit. \n", "test1_id": 981, "test2_input": "VIVIAN (a moment) If you're making fun of me, I don't like it. \nEDWARD Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to. \nVivian unconsciously bites her fingernails. \nEDWARD Ugly habit, biting your nails. \nVIVIAN You don't know habits, you think this is ugly. \nBut she puts her hands in her lap.  She looks out the window. She's safe from Carlos. \nVIVIAN Okay, pull over.  Let me out. I've got to get back to work. \nEdward pulls the Ferrari to the curb and stops. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) Stay on this street and you'll hit Beverly Hills. \nEDWARD What do you charge for company, Vivian? \nVIVIAN Company would cost you... a hundred dollars. \nEDWARD For the whole night? \nVIVIAN For an hour. \nEDWARD You're joking. \nVIVIAN I never joke about money. \nEDWARD Neither do I. (a moment; amused) A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff. \nShe reaches across the seat.  Her hand goes in his lap. \nVIVIAN No, but it's getting there. \nEDWARD Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night? \nVIVIAN You couldn't afford it. \nVivian starts to get out of the car. \nEDWARD Try me. \nA moment.  Vivian's sexy smile comes on. \nVIVIAN Three hundred. \nEDWARD Fine. \nVIVIAN What's your name, lover. \nEDWARD Edward.  My name is Edward. \nVIVIAN Edward... you got it! \nEdward gets out of the car.  Vivian looks at him confused. \nEDWARD Get in.  This side. \nVIVIAN What? \nEDWARD You know how to drive a stick? \nVivian moves around the car. \nVIVIAN Better believe it. \nEDWARD Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive. \nThey get in the car. \nINT. FERRARI - NIGHT \nShe starts the car, revs it. \nVIVIAN Here we go Edward. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT \nThe Ferrari peels out, fishtails madly and SCREAMS up the street. \nEXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "INT. FERRARI - NIGHT \nEdward takes a moment to get his breath.  He gestures toward the back. \nEDWARD My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on. \nVIVIAN Why? \nEDWARD You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour. \nVIVIAN You mean they don't have hookers. \nEDWARD Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're... \nVIVIAN Off the boulevard. \nEDWARD Exactly. \nINT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT \nAs they walk in, Vivian is tying the trenchcoat. \nVIVIAN Great.  Now I took like a hooker in a trenchcoat. \nShe looks up.  She stops in her tracks.  The lobby is bright and spacious, filled with thick carved wood paneling.  Even at this hour there is a great deal of activity.  MEN in business suits and WOMEN in furs and jewels are passing by.  Vivian's face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of all this luxury.  Vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes Edward's arm. \nVIVIAN So let's go. \nEdward guides them across the lobby.  They reach the elevators and go inside. \nINT. HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nThe young ELEVATOR OPERATOR is dressed in a clean red uniform that seems just a bit too tight.  As the elevator doors close he nods toward Edward. \nOPERATOR Evening, sir. \nEDWARD Good evening.  Penthouse. \nVIVIAN Penthouse.  My, my. \nShe sees the operator glancing at her. \nVIVIAN The penthouse.  And step on it. \nINT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nEdward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway leading to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors.  Edward pulls out his key and unlocks the doors.  With a gentle push the door slide open in unison.  Edward gestures to Vivian to go inside.  She does.  Edward closes the doors behind her. \nINT. HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nAs Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling off the top of the building.  In front of her is a sunken living room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the city below.  For the first time, she is speechless.  Edward closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living room.  Edward picks up a phone.  Vivian checks out the room. \nEDWARD (into the phone) Room service. (to Vivian) What do you drink? \nVIVIAN Diet coke. \nEDWARD (into the phone) Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne. \nVIVIAN Can I have some chips? \nEDWARD (into the phone) -- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you. \nVivian makes her way down the steps to the living room.  She stares at the view. \nEDWARD (to Vivian) Impressed? \nVivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it. \nVIVIAN You kidding?  I come here all the time.  As a matter of fact they do rent this room by the hour. \nEdward smiles.  He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans back.  Vivian looks at him. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) Well, now that you have me for the night, what are you going to do with me? \nEDWARD Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this. \nVIVIAN Do you plan everything? \nEDWARD (a small smile) Always. \nVIVIAN Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance. \n", "test2_id": 982, "test3_input": "EDWARD Fair enough. \nHe rises.  Takes out his wallet.  Standing over her, he drops THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap.  She picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed. She puts the money in her jacket.  She realizes Edward is standing over her as if waiting. \nShe leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants.  He abruptly turns away. \nEDWARD Let's talk some more first. \nVIVIAN Right. (brightly) So!  In town on business? \nEDWARD (taking off his jacket) Uh-huh. \nVIVIAN Let me guess, you're a... lawyer. \nEDWARD (loosening his tie) And why do you say that? \nVIVIAN (a small smile) I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look. \nEdward almost smiles.  He sits across from her again. \nEDWARD Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers. \nVIVIAN I've known a lot of everybody. \nA chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door. \nEDWARD Champagne. \nHe starts to sit up.  Vivian motions for him to stay put. \nVIVIAN Hey.  I might as well make myself useful. \nEdward sits back down.  Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the front door.  A WAITER comes into the room with a silver cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl. \nWAITER Where would you like it? \nVIVIAN Where would we like it? \nEDWARD Where would we like it?  Here'll be fine. \nThe Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle of the living room.  He turns and heads back up the stairs and pauses near Vivian, staring.  Vivian stares back at him. \nVIVIAN What are you looking at? \nThe Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits.  Vivian closes the door behind him.  Vivian marches back down the stairs. \nEDWARD I think he wanted you to tip him. \nVIVIAN Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred. \nEdward crosses to the silver stand.  Vivian watches with interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) You have a wife?  Girlfriend? \nEDWARD I have both. \nEdward lifts the bottle out.  He deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop of champagne. \nVIVIAN Where are they?  Shopping together? \nEDWARD They should be.  They're both good at it. \nEdward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and hands one to Vivian. \nEDWARD (cont'd) My ex-wife lives in London in what used to be my home. My girlfriend is in New York moving out of my apartment even as we speak.  Cheers. \nHe drinks, nods approvingly. \nEDWARD It's a very good year. \nVIVIAN Oooh, thank god. \nEdward laughs softly.  She sips it.  To her surprise, really likes it.  Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries. \nEDWARD Try a strawberry. \nVIVIAN Why? \nEDWARD Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne. \nVIVIAN Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club. \nEDWARD Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate. \n", "test3_true": "EDWARD (softly) You really are a very beautiful girl. \nVIVIAN (husky-voiced) Just a romantic, that's you. \nEDWARD Yes... \nHer mouth is so wet and inviting... he leans closer... \nVIVIAN Me too. \nHe's about to kiss her... \nVIVIAN (cont'd) Not on the lips. \nHe freezes.  She pulls his head down to her breast. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEdward and Vivian on the bed.  He is on his back, his shoulder and head resting against the headboard.  She is astride him, hands resting on his chest, rocking... in control, confident... very much liking the fire she's kindled in his eyes. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - CLOSE ANGLE ON THEIR FACES - NIGHT \nEDWARD (touching her breasts) What do you like? \nVIVIAN If I want you to turn me on I'll pay you three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive. \nSmiling, Vivian reaches behind her, touching him.  He tries not to groan.  She's moving faster now.  Edward suddenly pulls her violently to him, he rolls her over... \nINT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHT \nA heavy spray of water comes down upon Edward.  He stands there quietly letting it wash over him.  He turns off the shower, steps out of the stall, picks up a towel and dries himself. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEdward stares.  His expensive clothes are on the floor, haphazardly dropped everywhere.  Vivian's clothes, as tattered as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair.  The incongruity of it touches Edward in a sad way.  He looks toward the bed.  Vivian is fast asleep.  Her heavy makeup has long since been rubbed off.  Asleep, her wary, smart-ass attitude is gone. \nShe looks like a sweet, gentle girl.  He stares at her a moment longer.  He turns, goes into the living room.  Vivian opens her eyes.  Through the open door she sees Edward sitting in a living room chair.  He is reading contracts. \nEXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MORNING \nThe sun is coming up as HOTEL EMPLOYEE hoses down the sidewalk in front of the hotel. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - MORNING \nA WOMAN EMPLOYEE is vacuuming the lobby.  She sees something and pauses.  She pulls a dead leaf from one of the potted plants. \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING \nThe elevator doors open and A WAITER rolls a cart out into the hallway.  He takes it to the doors of the penthouse.  He rings the bell. \nEDWARD (O.S.) It's open. \nINT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nThe Waiter wheels in a table of food, coffee, champagne and orange juice.  Edward dressed in suit pants, white shirt and suspenders, stands in the living room talking into a cordless phone.  Edward points the Waiter to the dining table. \nEDWARD (into the phone) Sorry.  Go ahead. \nINT. STUCKEY'S HOUSE - MORNING - INTERCUT \nWilliam Stuckey is behind his desk. \nSTUCKEY Kross knows we're after his company.  He wants to talk with you.  I don't think you should. \nINT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nThe Waiter returns.  Edward signs the bill.  The Waiter exits. \nEDWARD I want to. \nSTUCKEY Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal. \nEDWARD I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it. \nSTUCKEY You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him. \nEDWARD Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car... \nSTUCKEY Oh, god, what? \nEDWARD (smiling) I'll bring it back. \n", "test3_id": 983}

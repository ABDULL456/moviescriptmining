{"test1_input": "Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table.  Everyone looks to her. \nVIVIAN Slippery little suckers... \nKross rises. \nKROSS If you'll excuse me young lady, Mr. Harris... (turns to David) Deal with this, David, you know where we stand.  I need to go someplace and puke. \nHe rises.  He exits. \nDAVID (to Edward and Vivian) Men like my father built this country.  He was no saint.  He screwed people.  But for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job. \nEdward is silent. \nVIVIAN He seems like a nice man. \nDavid looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time. \nEDWARD We can reach an understanding on this. \nDAVID I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have. \nEDWARD Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally. \nDAVID I do.  I take it all very personally. (to Vivian) Very nice meeting you, Vivian. \nDavid Kross gets up and leaves.  Vivian and Edward sit in silence. \nEDWARD (a beat) And that's the way the game is played. \nVIVIAN Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement. \nEdward says nothing.  But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve. \nVIVIAN Snails for dinner.  No wonder everybody is in such a bad mood. \nA Waiter appears at the table. \nWAITER Are we ready for the next course, sir? \nEDWARD No.  Bring a check, please. \nINT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nEdward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of the glass window down at the city lights.  He quickly drains his champagne glass.  Vivian moves to stand next to him. She refills his glass from the bottle. \nEDWARD Thank you. \nHe drinks.  Silence. \nVIVIAN You're upset, huh? \nEDWARD Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business. \nVIVIAN You liked the guy, though. \nEDWARD Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive. \nVIVIAN (excited) We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it. (realizing what she's saying and quickly recovers) Except with you.  At your price I give my all... \nEdward laughs. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) Let's not talks about this heavy stuff.  Come on, relax. \nVivian comes up behind him.  She begins to rub his shoulders. \nEDWARD That... is very good. \nA moment.  Edward is silent.  Turns him, unknots his tie, unbuttons his collar. \nVIVIAN Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television. \nEDWARD Television? \nVIVIAN Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all. \nEDWARD I have work to do. \nVIVIAN Uh-uh.  No work. \nSmiling, she softly kisses his throat. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) See... what you haven't figured out yet... \n", "test1_true": "VIVIAN (cont'd) Is that while you're the boss everyplace else... I'm the one in charge here. \nShe kisses his chest. \nVIVIAN (cont'd) You... just think you are. \nShe starts to kneel down.  He stops her.  They stare at one another for a moment.  He releases her.  She smiles.  She starts to undress him. \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING \nVivian is asleep.  She turns over, slowly waking.  Her hand goes out to touch Edward and encounters nothing but empty bed. Vivian comes awake with a sudden start.  She look around momentarily frightened, not sure where she is.  Sighing with relief, she lies back down.  She sees Edward's American Express card on the pillow next to her. \nEDWARD (O.S.) Wake up, Vivian.  Time to shop. \nEdward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed. He is tying his tie.  Vivian sits up and ties it for him.  He smiles at her. \nEDWARD I still don't understand why you only bought one dress. \nVIVIAN I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be. \nEDWARD Why not? \nVIVIAN Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works. \nEDWARD Was someone rude to you? \nVIVIAN I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool. \nEDWARD Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you. \nEdward sits on the bed. \nEDWARD (cont'd) People aren't going to respect you unless you respect yourself. (a beat) The next time someone is rude to you, you stare at them right here. \nHe softly touches her, right between the eyes. \nEDWARD (cont'd) It's an old trick I use, especially with bankers.  Works every time.  Will you try it? \nVIVIAN (confidently) Okay. \nEDWARD Good. \nVIVIAN (a beat) Come with me? \nEdward looks at his watch.  Vivian covers it with her hand. \nVIVIAN Please. \nINT. BOUTIQUE - DAY \nA beautiful, chic women's shop.  The haughty SALESGIRL approaches Vivian near a rack of dresses.  Edward hovers in the b.g. \nVIVIAN (nervous) Hello.  Can you help me? \nThe Salesgirl looks Vivian up and down.  A Pause.  Vivian gives her \"the stare\" and straightens up.  We see the Salesgirl's reaction change. \nVIVIAN (confidently) I'm looking for a dress, nothing too flashy, not too sexy, conservative.  In a size six. \nSALESGIRL (uncomfortable under Vivian's stare) Do... do you have a charge account with us? \nVivian smiles and draws out Edward's American Express card. The Salesgirl nods and quickly moves to a rack of dresses to find Vivian's size. \nINT. BOUTIQUE - DAY - IN A SERIES OF CUTS \nVivian tries on different clothes under Edward and the Salesgirl's supervision. \nVivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low cut, spangled and fringed outfit.  Edward shakes his hand.  The Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit. Vivian scowls. \nVIVIAN (sighing) I look like fucking Nancy Reagan. \nINT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE \nThe Salesgirl shows Edward clothes by Ann Taylor.  He turns to find Vivian happily holding up a tiny, low cut leather dress. Edward shakes his head in mock disapproval.  Vivian scowls. \nINT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER \nVivian is wearing an elegant pastel dress.  Edward is standing at the store's bar, watching and talking on the telephone. \nINT.  STUCKEY'S OFFICE - DAY - INTERCUT WITH EDWARD \nStuckey and Vance are pouring over stock reports, talking to Edward on the speaker phone. \n", "test1_id": 981, "test2_input": "Vivian softly traces small patterns on Edward's shoulders with a finger. \nVIVIAN You still mad at'm? \nEDWARD He died a long time ago. \nShe gently rests her head on his back. \nEXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nPANNING BELLIES  People are sunbathing by the pool. Overweight... lobster red... old and stretch-marked... fishy white... and then gorgeous.  The gorgeous is Vivian.  She is wearing a miniscule bikini and sunglasses. \nWAITER (O.S.) Miss Vivian? \nShe looks up.  A young WAITER, looking a little dry-mouthed at the sight of her, is holding a telephone. \nWAITER You have a call.  Mr. Harris. \nVIVIAN (taking the phone) Hi, baby. (a moment) I'll be ready.  Bye. \nShe hangs up.  She looks at the Waiter, confused. \nVIVIAN What do you wear to polo? \nEXT. THE LOS ANGELES EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON \nHorses and riders crash and careen on the playing field.  An enthusiastic crowd cheers. \nDOWN OFF THE EDGE OF THE FIELD \na tailgate party using Cadillacs and Rolls Royces is in progress.  Horses and riders thunder by a crowd of very well-dressed, successful-looking people -- celebrities, execs, socialites, aficionados -- most of whom ignore the game.  They are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo match. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATER AFTERNOON \nVivian and Edward make their way towards the party.  Edward is wearing his new tie.  Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful in one of her new outfits.  Not that it's helping -- the place, the people, the wealth -- everything here suddenly has her overwhelmed.  She suddenly stops. \nVIVIAN You're really pushing it, bringing me here. \nEDWARD I think it's exciting. \nVIVIAN What id we run into someone I know? \nEDWARD I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard. \nVIVIAN You did. \nA VOICE calls out. \nSTUCKEY (O.S.) Edward! \nThey turn.  William Stuckey is with a group of people.  He waves them over. \nSTUCKEY (cont'd) Come on!  Over here! \nEdward takes Vivian's arm and leads her forward. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON \nStuckey grins and shakes Edward's hand. \nSTUCKEY (looking at Vivian) Well, well, well... \nVivian dislikes this guy on sight.  Dislikes the frosty looking woman at his side. \nEDWARD Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian. \nSTUCKEY (holding out a hand; smiling) Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth. \nVIVIAN Hi. \nElizabeth Stuckey stretches her thin lips in a cold smile. \nSTUCKEY Lots of fun people here.  Let me get you two some champagne. \nHe moves quickly away. \nELIZABETH STUCKEY Excuse me. \nShe moves to greet someone else.  Vivian and Edward survey the milling CROWD. \nVIVIAN (sarcastic) Real genuine guy. \nEDWARD He's good at what he does. \n", "test2_true": "EDWARD (a small smile) Shall we mingle? \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON \nA goal is scored. \nIN A SERIES OF CUTS \nEdward watches and guides her, Vivian sips champagne and meets and chats and wins over different PEOPLE. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA group of PEOPLE. \nWOMAN I simply love your dress, Vivian. \nVIVIAN This old thing? \nWOMAN Of course, a figure like yours can wear anything.  You must work out constantly. \nVIVIAN I lead a very physical life. \nOLDER MAN Are you into running, Vivian? \nVIVIAN I'm into walking.  I walk a lot. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON \nIn another group of PEOPLE. \nANOTHER MAN You look awfully familiar, Vivian. Haven't we run into one another at the spa in La Costa? \nVIVIAN Well, I do often spa there. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON \nEdward and Elizabeth Stuckey watch Vivian laugh and chat with a group of WOMEN. \nELIZABETH STUCKEY Edward, she's marvelous.  Warm and witty and down to earth. \nEDWARD (with pleasure) She is, isn't she. \nELIZABETH STUCKEY So unlike your usuals.  Where on earth did you find her? \nEdward smiles enigmatically.  Taking an hors d'oeuvres off a passing WAITERS's tray, he starts forward. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA WOMAN We're good together.  He has to admit it.  I've been just what he wants me to be.  I say the right things, I know the right people, I give wonderful parties. No question, no arguments, no embarrassments.  It works for both of us. \nThat makes Vivian think.  And then she smiles as she sees Edward approaching.  Vivian moves to him. \nVIVIAN Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money. \nEDWARD I'm sure that's true for some of them. \nVIVIAN I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur. \nEDWARD (a beat) Ready to stomp sod? \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON \nIN A SERIES OF SHOTS TO MUSIC \nThe CROWD engages in sod stomping.  They drink champagne.  They make a dance out of it.  They laugh.  Shoes get stuck in the mud.  It's ludicrous -- these people in their suits and fancy clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit. In a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in disbelief. \nVivian is having a wonderful time.  And then, as she moves towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses. David Kross smiles at Vivian.  She hesitates... and then she crosses towards him. \nEXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON \nDAVID KROSS Hi. \nVIVIAN Hi.  I never thought stomping in grass could be so much fun. \nDAVID (laughs) I like your hat. \nVIVIAN Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?

I gotta find time to shop. \nINT. PENTHOUSE - DAY \nEdward stands at the penthouse window, looking out.  He is dressed now, ready for travel.  There is something about his expression, his somber demeanor that suggests the way we saw him at the very top of the story.  A BELLMAN enters from the bedroom, rolling a luggage loaded dolly along in front of him. \nBELLMAN Is that everything, sir? \nEDWARD (turning from the window) That's everything. \nThe Bellman exits, closing the door behind him.  The phone rings.  Edward crosses to it, picks it up.  The Maid comes in, looks around. \nMAID The lady, she go? \nEDWARD Yes.  She go. \nINT.

She takes the photo of her and Kit dressed up hot in hooker clothes and packs it. \nKIT So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco? \nVIVIAN Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be. \nKIT What kind of school? \nVIVIAN School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know. \nKIT So did I.  I made it with the principal.

Kit nods at her. \nKIT Hey, how you doin'.  You new, huh? \nGIRL Yeah.  Got a cigarette? \nKIT Sure. \nShe passes the girl down the pack.  She strikes a match, lights her cigarette for her.  The girl inhales deep, lets it out with a sigh.  She looks towards the window. \nGIRL Jeez, did the wacko in the suit. \nKit turns to look. \nKIT'S P.O.V. - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. \nOutside, across the street, Edward has accosted two PROSTITUTES; one blonde, one a red haired black one. \nINT. FALAFEL STAND - DAY - BACK TO SCENE \nKit rises. \nKIT Chan?  Keep the sandwich warm, I'll be back. \nShe heads out the door. \nEXT.

VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nVivian sits on her bed, lost in thought.  Her bags are packed, ready to go.  With a sigh she rises.  She picks up the bags, exits the room. \nVivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking it all in for the last time.  She suddenly looks more than a little bit frightened to be leaving.  She musters resolve.  She goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her. Silence.  Vivian suddenly comes back in.  She puts down her bags.  She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee can/piggy bank from the shelf.  She puts some more bills into it, places it back where Kit will find it. \nShe turns and starts again for the door. \nShe stops.  She hears something.  MUSIC.  An aria from La Boheme.  Faint.  Seemingly coming from nowhere.  She dismisses it -- she's hearing things.  She opens the door.  Stops.  The music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her imagination.  She hurries over to the window. \n", "test3_id": 983}

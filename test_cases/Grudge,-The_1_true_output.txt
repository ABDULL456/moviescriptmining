-- someone's KNOCKING on the front door. 
64   INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                64 
They're still KNOCKING. 
65   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                            65 
Apparently, whoever's KNOCKING isn't going to give up -- 
-- the DOOR HANDLE jiggles.   But it's locked. 
EXT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Karen's CELL PHONE lays on the table in the foreground. Beyond is the hallway, and the front door. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       40. 
The knocking has stopped.    Silence. 
Then Karen's cell phone suddenly LIGHTS UP, ringing. 
It rings four times, then goes to voice mail. 
67   INT. THE HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                              67 
A new SOUND breaks the silence: movement outside. Crunching footsteps on gravel, someone brushing past tree limbs. 
A SHADOW falls over the window.   A face looks inside -- 
-- it's ALEX, Karen's boss. He walks away from the window and continues down the side of the house -- 
-- we TRACK down the hallway, past the bathroom, through the kitchen, following his progress into -- 
THE BACK ROOM: Alex is visible through the sliding door leading to the back porch. He peers inside. 
HIS POV: A FIGURE covered head-to-toe in a white sheet lies on the mattress. Unmoving. 
Alex tries the sliding door -- it's open.     He steps inside. 
ALEX Karen? 
Silence greets him.   He stares down at the figure in the bed. 
Alex licks his lips, nervous.   Finally walks to the mattress, kneeling down next to it. 
Raises a hand and grabs the sheet.      Raises it over the head -- 
-- it's Emma. As we last saw her, eyes on the ceiling, mouth and eyes wide open in fear. 
But now it's clear, from the tache noire in the eyes, the blanched skin, the rigidity of her body: she's dead. 
Alex falls back onto his butt, staring at Emma.     He pulls himself away from the corpse -- 
-- and freezes.    There's something right behind him. He whirls around -- 
-- it's KAREN.    In the corner, looking pale and dazed.

68   EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT                                       68 
Two POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are parked out front. 
An UNMARKED CAR pulls up, and DETECTIVE NAKAGAWA (40s) exits the passenger side. He looks up at The House with dread. 
The driver, DETECTIVE IGARASHI (30s), moves next to him. 
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE) I can handle this myself, you know. It's just a routine call. I don't know why you wanted to come. 
He turns to Nakagawa, awaiting a response. He doesn't get one. Nakagawa just stares up at The House. 
INT. THE HOUSE - LATER The house feels completely different: all the interior lights are on, a few POLICE OFFICERS mill about, two EMTs wheel EMMA'S BODY out the front door on a gurney. 
Alex sits at the kitchen table, frazzled.   He turns to -- 
-- KAREN. She's sitting in the living room, wrapped in a blanket, being attended to by a FEMALE NURSE and speaking with Nakagawa and Igarashi, who is taking notes on a pad. 
Karen says something and the Detective looks over at Alex. Then he speaks to the Nurse, who helps Karen to her feet. 
Nakagawa and Igarashi enter the kitchen.    In perfect English: 
NAKAGAWA I am Detective Nakagawa. This is Detective Igarashi, my assistant. 
ALEX Is Karen okay?

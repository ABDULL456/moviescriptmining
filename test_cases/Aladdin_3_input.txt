GENIE:  Me?  No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in my case, ah, forget it. ALADDIN:    What?  No, tell me. GENIE:  Freedom. ALADDIN:    You're a prisoner? GENIE:  It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig. (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic powers!  (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.) Itty bitty living space ALADDIN:    Genie, that's terrible. GENIE:  (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?"  To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and smell the hummus ALADDIN:    Why not? GENIE:  The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's happened. ALADDIN:    I'll do it. I'll set you free. GENIE:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh huh, right.  Whoop! ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free.   (He holds out his hand) GENIE:  Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.) O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want most? ALADDIN:    Well, there's this girl-- GENIE:  Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't make anybody fall in love, remember? ALADDIN:    Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and... GENIE:  Pretty? ALADDIN:    Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and this hair, wow...and her smile. GENIE:  (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.) Ami.  C'est l'amour. ALADDIN:    But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince? GENIE:  Let's see here.  (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Uh, chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab? (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from "The Little Mermaid"  clamped on.)  Ow, I hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu, Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the words! ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince! GENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century. These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No! Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and he flies over.) ABU:        Uh oh! GENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with "AL" on it.)  And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out, it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.) Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need? (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1."   (That one's a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!! (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk space, check this action out! 
(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree. The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.) 
ALADDIN:    Abu, you look good. GENIE:  He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but we're not through yet.  Hang on to your turban, kid, cause we're gonna make you a star! 
(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys. (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top, then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the pile collapses.) 
JAFAR:  Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with your daughter. IAGO:   Awk!  The problem with your daughter! SULTAN: Oh, really? JAFAR:  (Unrolling a scroll) Right here.  "If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her." SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to stuff a cracker into IAGO's mouth.  IAGO backs away.  The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker back.)  How could I choose someone she hates? (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth.) JAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess must then be wed to...hmm...interesting. SULTAN: What?  Who? JAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me! SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess, I'm quite sure. JAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the SULTAN with it.) SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures... JAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me. SULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell breaks momentarily)...but you're so old! JAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry me! SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince Ali".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha. Jafar., you must come and see this! 
(We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in human form as a MAJOR.) 
MARCHERS:   Make way for Prince Ali! SWORDSMEN: Say hey!  It's Prince Ali! MAJOR:  Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar, Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star, Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye! Make way, here he comes, Ring bells, bang the drums. You're gonna love this guy 
(The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.) 
Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa! Genuflect, show some respect Down on one knee 
(ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.) 
Now try your best to stay calm Brush up your Sunday Salaam And come and meet his spectacular coterie.

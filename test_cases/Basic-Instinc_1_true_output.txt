NICK You should do something about this lock. 
BETH She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick. 
He looks at her. 
EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT 
He gets out of his Porsche.  He walks toward the door. 
INT. HIS APARTMENT HOUSE - THE STAIRWAY 
He starts going up the dark stairway.  There is a hand on his neck.  He spins. 
CATHERINE (smiles) Do I scare you, Nick? 
He looks at her, doesn't say anything. 
CATHERINE (smiles) I just thought I'd surprise you. (a beat) What's the matter? 
NICK (after a beat) I found Lisa Henderson. 
CATHERINE Did you?  What's she doing? 
He looks at her, doesn't say anything. 
CATHERINE You're not going to tell me what she's doing. (a beat) I thought we weren't playing games anymore. 
NICK (after a beat) I did, too. (a beat) She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did. 
Catherine looks at him a beat, then smiles. 
CATHERINE And you believed her?  I even went down to the campus  police and made out a report about her. 
He just looks at her. 
CATHERINE You still think I kill people, don't you? 
NICK (after a beat) No. 
CATHERINE Liar. 
And she's gone. 
INT. CAMPUS POLICE RECORDS ROOM - BERKELEY - DAY 
He stands with an old CAMPUS COP.  He is going through files. 
CAMPUS COP Who'd you say you were with? 
NICK Homicide.  San Francisco. 
He stops at a file, opens it. 
CAMPUS COP Don't you guys communicate over there?  You must be the same way we are. 
Nick doesn't get it. 
CAMPUS COP There was a report about Lisa Henderson -- January, 1977 -- the file's not here. 
NICK What do you mean it's not here? 
CAMPUS COP San Francisco P.D. Detective Nilsen. Internal Affairs.  You know him? Tell him we want it back.  He's had it a whole year. 
Nick says nothing. 
INT. HIS APARTMENT - DAY 
He and Gus sit there -- they look tired, upset. 
GUS So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it? 
NICK Catherine told me what was in it. 
GUS If she's telling  you the truth. 
NICK Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen. 
GUS How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened? 
NICK He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.

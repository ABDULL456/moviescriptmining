Who am I to question either? How you feel today? \nHAVEN Like I crawled here from Kansas City. \nORVILLE Well, it figures to make you pretty famous. Fact, people been askin' for you already. \nHAVEN Who? \nORVILLE That gold mine lady -- Mrs. Caslon. \nHAVEN That's nice. \nORVILLE Couldn't do better. And Charlie. \nHAVEN Charlie? \nORVILLE No. less. \nHAVEN You seem impressed. \nORVILLE Why not? Charlie owns a piece of everything, includin' the undertaker and the sheriff. \nHAVEN The stage line too? \nORVILLE Everything but the Wednesday Bible Class. Even owns a piece of me. (grins) Takes your money while you're here, and makes you pay to leave. \nHAVEN (putting down the cup) When you get the next verse I'd like to hear it. \nORVILLE Can't find no word to rhyme with Mick Marion. \nHAVEN (as he turns away) Carrion. \nHe walks off. Orville ponders this, scowling into space. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN \nIles is pacing the floor. Mrs. Caslon is occupied with some minor domestic chore. Stellman is standing by the door. Iles is a ball of fire. \nILES Of all the stupid bonehead plays! What did he fight about -- don't tell me a woman? \nSTELLMAN That's what they tell me. \nILES Who started it? \nSTELLMAN I don't know, but Haven finished it. \nILES That probably strikes you as a very admirable thing. \nStellman shrugs. \nILES Well, I don't think so! I have men who can use their fists. Why didn't they send a man who could use his brains! \nThere is a knock at the door. Iles gives her a look; then glares at Stellman. \nILES Well -- open it up! \nStellman opens the door and Haven walks in. He pauses, glances around and smiles. Mrs. Caslon smiles at him. \nHAVEN Hello, Mrs. Caslon. \nShe smiles and nods. Irons. Haven can feel the surcharged air. Deliberately he assumes that casual manner that so burns the Captain. \nHAVEN Captain... Lieutenant... \nILES (coldly) Mr. Haven, we may not have very much around here that pleases you, but we do have a strict post regulation against brawling in the town. Now would you like to explain what happened last night? \nHAVEN (smiling) I came here to return Mrs. Caslon's call. \nIles glances sharply at Mrs. Caslon, and then to Haven. \nILES (indicating a chair) Sit down. \nHaven sits, wincing a little. But he beams at Iles, who now picks a book off the table. \nILES This book I have in my hand is the Army Register, 1882. \nHaven inspects his knuckles. \nILES I am now going to read from it. (finds the place; reads) \"Haven, John Martin, born Ohio 1852. Appointed Second Lieutenant. Promoted First Lieutenant 20th Infantry, March 1880; reduced in rank to 2nd Lieutenant January 12, 1881.\" \nHe tosses the book on the table, glaring at Haven. \n", "test1_true": "HAVEN It's the Army Register. \nILES Haven, you've lost your rank once. It may very well happen again. \nHAVEN To almost anybody. \nMRS. CASLON Maybe if you'd let him explain... He might have a good reason. \nILES Even a bad reason would delight me. \nHAVEN What would you like to know? \nILES Did you pick that fight? \nHAVEN Those things can become very vague. \nIles scowls to him. \nILES (shrewdly) And where do you expect all this to get you? \nHAVEN (rising wearily) That is a question I prefer not to answer. \nILES (snaps it) I think you're trying to carry your authority too far. \nHaven goes to the door, gently touching his sore jaw. At the door he turns. \nHAVEN Perhaps, but there's one thing, Captain Iles... We had an arrangement that we wouldn't meet -- you and I -- except through Mrs. Caslon... I think it's important to keep it that way... (one more glance back) And I like it better. \nHe smiles and leaves, closing the door as he goes. Iles stands there frozen with rage a moment. Then his face relaxes in a grim smile. He glances at Stellman as he takes a cigar out and bites it off. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. SALOON - DAY \nBusiness is slack. Girls drink coffee and knit at a table. Ernie polishes glasses at the bar. A colored man cleans a crap table. All look up with curiosity and esteem as Haven enters; all but Sam, the piano player, who goes on playing. Haven goes to the bar. Ernie nods at him. \nHAVEN Doesn't he ever stop playing? \nERNIE Sam? It don't bother him. He's deaf. \nHAVEN Where do I find the boss? \nERNIE First door top of the stairs. \nHAVEN Mick been around? \nERNIE He's undisposed. \nHaven goes to the stairs. The eyes of the girls follow him. \nTop of the stairs -- as Haven reaches the door, wincing at the climb. He KNOCKS with the heel of his hand, hurts it, then uses his boot toe. \nPRINCE'S VOICE Come in. \nHaven opens the door. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThis is a big corner room, the windows of which look out over the main street. The chairs are big and there is a roll- top desk in the corner, a big leather sofa, and on the walls some framed pictures. At a table Prince sits. He has six dice stacked on top of each other and he is lifting the column. Charlie is seated behind the desk smiling. Haven looks from one to the other. \nHAVEN (to Prince) You wanted to see me? \nCHARLIE I did. \nHAVEN They said Charlie -- \nCHARLIE Yes. \nShe seems to enjoy Haven's momentary confusion. Prince is indifferent. \nHAVEN You're Charlie? \nCHARLIE That's right. (nods toward Prince) This is Prince. Don't ever gamble with him. \nHAVEN You mean with his equipment? \nPrince gives him a thin smile and rises. \nPRINCE She means either. (he crosses to door) See you later, Charlie. \nPrince saunters out. \nHaven sits in a big chair, very gingerly; takes out his pipe and tobacco. \nHAVEN You surround yourself with very affable characters. \nCHARLIE It makes me feel at home. \n", "test1_id": 1488, "test2_input": "MRS. CASLON George -- you're getting to be a hard man to deal with. \nILES I'm getting to deal with some hard men. \nIron-faced, he starts out, remembers again, softens against his will, comes back from the door and kisses her cheek and then leaves. CAMERA stays on Mrs. Caslon as she watches him go. She smiles slightly, puts the envelope in the safe, and then from it takes a six-gun, looks at it and begins dusting it with her handkerchief as we \nDISSOLVE \nBRISTOW You certainly are a careful man. \nHAVEN I have to be. I live a careless life. \nHaven begins washing his face in the washbowl, and then combing his hair and readjusting his somewhat rumpled shirt. Mark watches him. \nHAVEN What about the deposition? \nBRISTOW She has it. It's in her safe. \nHAVEN Good. \nBRISTOW What do we do now? \nHAVEN We call on Charlie. \nThere is a little nervous sweat on Mark's hands; he wipes them on his coat. \nBRISTOW It's a dangerous play, Haven. \nHAVEN Is it? \nBRISTOW What if she doesn't believe you? \nHAVEN Then she'll have to believe you. \nBRISTOW That deposition could be a lie. It might not stand up in a court. \nHAVEN You're sure of that? \nBRISTOW Well -- not exactly. \nHAVEN That's it. You're a lawyer and you're not sure. Then how can she gamble on it, either? \nBRISTOW Because she's a gambler. \nHAVEN No, she isn't. (ready to go) We're the gamblers, Mark. Lot's go. \nA little shaken and uncertain, Mark obeys. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. HOTEL - EVENING \nAs Haven and Mark come out. They walk towards the saloon. People look at them curiously. Suddenly, down the street, the sheriff appears, approaching Haven slowly and ominously. Sensing a gun fight, people vanish. Purely from instinct, Mark deserts Haven's side in a hurried walk towards the saloon, eyeing both. Haven comes on leisurely. The sheriff has stopped in his tracks and has his gun out. A woman clutches her child to her skirt. Men stand stockstill, watching. A crowd forms at the entrance to Charlie's. Haven walks slowly forward until he reaches the waiting sheriff. He looks him over with a smile of contempt. \nSHERIFF You're under arrest! \nHAVEN (pausing) For what? \nSHERIFF For the murder of James Goddard -- and robbery under arms! \nHAVEN (casually) I've heard about you. You don't appear to understand the functions of your office. (taking sheriff's gun and breaking it open) You've missed the whole point of your profession. (showing him) Even your gun isn't loaded. (Haven loads it as it goes on) I suggest that you start all over again, with this point in mind: the duty of a peace officer is to arrest the culprit of a crime -- not the victim. \nHaven hands him back the now loaded gun and walks away towards the saloon, leaving the sheriff standing there, a completely dumbfounded and bepuzzled man. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - NIGHT \nThe place is roaring. Haven enters, followed by Mark. The guy at the piano is playing as always. Haven and Mark go slowly to the bar, eyes following them. The noise softens almost to silence, except the piano, Cowering, Mark sticks close to Haven. \nAt the dice table, Prince stares coldly, hands another man the stick and walks away to the stairway, his eyes seeking Mick Marion who is also staring at Haven. Prince nods to Mick as he goes. \nMED. SHOT at bar -- as Haven and Mark loan against it. Ernie is looking at him curiously; then towards Mick. Haven doesn't follow the glance, but Mark does. \nERNIE Rye? \nHAVEN Two. \nErnie gets them. Haven glances at the piano. Mick who had stood there has now vanished. Haven smiles. The drinks arrive. \nBRISTOW (gulping his drink) This is no good. \nHAVEN The bourbon is just as bad. \nBRISTOW I don't mean that. \nHAVEN You want to leave? \n", "test2_true": "HAVEN That's right. \nBRISTOW Then why don't we do something. \nHAVEN We're doing something. \nBRISTOW What? \nHAVEN Waiting for something to happen. (smiling at Mark) \nMark finishes off his second. A stickman comes up. Nudges Haven. \nSTICKMAN Charlie wants to see you. Upstairs. \nHAVEN (to Mark) See? \nThe stickman moves away. Mark looks at Haven. \nBRISTOW Do I go with you? \nHAVEN Can you make it? \nHaven turns away towards the stairs. Mark hesitates, bites his lip, swallows another drink and then grimly follows. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nCharlie is behind her desk, as Haven walks in. Behind him, sweating now, comes Mark. As the two are in the room the door behind them slams shut. Mick is there with a gun. Prince moves slightly out of a shadow. Mark backs against a wall. Charlie looks up from her fingernails. Haven smiles and glances around. His eyes fix on Mick and the gun. \nHAVEN I see you found the difference. \nMick says nothing, his face a blank hatred. Haven sits down in a big chair. \nHAVEN Looks like a board meeting. \nAnother door opens and Pete, the sawmill foreman, enters, stands silently. Haven glances at him, then at Charlie who smiles thinly back. \nCHARLIE (indicating Mark) What's he doing with you? \nHAVEN I thought I might need a lawyer. \nCHARLIE I doubt it. \nHAVEN I can realize how seldom legal technicalities annoy you -- but I have one that might. (taking out his pipe) Besides, he knows all about it. \nPRINCE About what? \nHAVEN About a gear box I failed to deliver. \nBRISTOW I don't know anything! I merely -- \nPRINCE Shut up! \nMark relapses into a perspiring silence. \nHAVEN (quietly) Mark is right. He doesn't know anything. He just knows what I dictated to him in a deposition. \nCHARLIE And what was that? \nHAVEN It was just a story. About a man who got murdered, a thief who got shot, and a gear box that got lost. Probably nobody would believe it -- (glancing up) ...unless I got killed for it. \nCharlie stares at him a moment. Then she glances at Pete. \nCHARLIE Go downstairs, Pete. Watch the stairway. \nPete walks out. \nCHARLIE (to Haven) Who else have you told? \nHAVEN No one. Mark I had to have. He's a witness and a notary. He makes it stick. He stands it up in court. \nCHARLIE (always watching his face) What keeps it from getting to a court? \nHAVEN A cut. \nMICK He's running a bluff! \nHAVEN I ran one on you. \nMick burns in silence. Charlie smiles. \nCHARLIE You brought your lawyer. Ask him if this doesn't sound like blackmail. \nHAVEN He can't think very clearly in the presence of a gun. \nPRINCE But it doesn't bother you? \nHAVEN (coldly) No, it doesn't. \n", "test2_id": 1489, "test3_input": "As Mrs. Caslon looks out the window. Her face, tense, as she watches the lonely figure go; her hand waves slightly. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nCharlie is standing by the desk and window. Prince is sitting there, talking, the inevitable dice in his fingers. \nPRINCE There's seventy men ready for any kind of play. I say we can still swing it -- and get out of town. \nTHERE is SOUND of massed horses outside and Charlie looks out. Prince walks to the window. They look in silence. \nCHARLIE Can we? \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nAs Iles rides by at full gallop, followed by a troop of cavalry, headed for the sawmill. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nAs they watch. Prince turns away. \nPRINCE You wanted to give Haven time. Well, he took it. \nCHARLIE You better get out before he takes you. \nPRINCE By that I presume you intend to remain. \nCHARLIE (wistfully) I've been here as long as I remember. \nPrince crosses to the window and stands looking at Charlie. \nPRINCE I asked you once if Haven moved me out. (he smiles) I think he's moved us both out -- together. \nCharlie looks at him but does not answer and then she turns to the window, and smiles slightly. Prince follows her gaze to the street. His face is grim. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nHaven, mounted, is coming up the street. Slowly and carefully he progresses to the front of the saloon. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nAs Charlie glances at Prince. \nPRINCE (softly) This is the way I wanted it... and when I've finished you will too... as though Haven had never been here. \nHe turns and goes quietly and swiftly from the room. Charlie stands thoughtfully. There is nothing in her look or manner to indicate that what Prince has said has made the slightest impression on her. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nAs Haven comes up to the saloon door. \nINT. SALOON DAWN \nAs Prince moves into a shadowy corner. \nANGLE ON the door as Haven enters and looks around. He sees no one. The place seems utterly deserted. It is soundless. CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven as he moves slowly. He has replaced the gun, but he is alert. \nANGLE ON Prince as he watches Haven, now a perfect target, not looking in his direction. Prince raises the gun a little, but the dice in his over hand click ever so faintly. \nSHOT OF Haven as he stops dead in his tracks, hand on the gun again, alert at the slight sound of the dice. Now facing towards the shadow where Prince is hidden. He stands ready and rigid for a long still moment. When there is no further sound or movement, he goes on towards the stairs. \nANGLE ON Prince as he moves slightly from the shadow as Haven goes to the stairs. Prince is ready to shoot again, but now the angle on Haven up the stairs is no good. He lowers the gun with disgust, then moves softly out of the shadow. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nShe gets a gun out of the drawer, looks at it, smiles, drops it back into the drawer, moves around the desk and faces the door, composing herself and waiting. \nEXT. CHARLIE'S DOOR \nAs Haven pauses, pushes it open. Then walks slowly in. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nShe is standing with her back to the desk, her fingers tight on the edge of the desk as Haven walks in. He stops and looks around and then at her. There is a slight smile on her face. \nCHARLIE You cause me an awful lot of trouble. \nHAVEN Yeh... but I finally brought you something. \nHe hands her the little derringer she had given to Mark. \nHAVEN You didn't really think Mark would use it, did you? \nCHARLIE Maybe I just wanted to send you a gun. \nHAVEN (thoughtfully) Maybe. \n", "test3_true": "HAVEN It's pretty late. \nCHARLIE Why? \nHAVEN I have to arrest you. \nCHARLIE For what? \nHAVEN Murder. \nCHARLIE I could have killed you from the window -- but I didn't. And I didn't kill the two men -- or Goodard. \nHAVEN Who did? \nCHARLIE Maybe Mick -- maybe Prince -- who knows. \nHAVEN You know. \nShe puts the little gun on the desk. \nCHARLIE You'd almost as soon be killed as arrest me, wouldn't you? \nHAVEN Almost. \nCHARLIE Which are you -- Wells Fargo or Army? \nHAVEN Army. \nHe hands her the paper he showed Iles. She just glances at it without touching it. Smiles at him. \nCHARLIE I guess it's my turn to wish you'd gone to China. \nHAVEN I wish I had too. \nCHARLIE (quietly) If you still have that gold, and I think you do, we might make it yet. You see I believe that every man has his price. \nHAVEN Some men don't believe that. \nCHARLIE But every woman knows it. \nHer eyes pass him towards the door behind him. \nHAVEN Only there wouldn't be any women on my jury. (taking out his pipe) And that's why you're not as bad off as you might think... I could find twelve men who might think you capable of almost anything -- but I wouldn't bet they'd vote that way after staring at you through a trial. (he notes her eyes go past him) Mick is dead for the murders and Prince can be hung for the rest of it... \nAt the bare rustle of SOUND behind him (and the memory of her eyes going past him) Haven whirls, stopping aside and drawing as he does so. And just as he does so, Prince, in the doorway, fires. Haven shoots so that the shots RING OUT almost simultaneously. Prince topples forward on his knees and then his face. The dice roll out of his unclenched left hand. \nMED. SHOT of Haven and Charlie as their eyes read the dice. Haven puts away the gun. Charlie is still leaning against the desk, but there is a strange look on her face. A thin smile for Haven. Now she sags a little and Haven realizes she has been hit. He starts to her and she turns away towards the couch. He catches her as she sags again, and helps her down gently on the couch. \nANGLE on couch as Haven kneels beside her. He starts to pull away the top of her dress, but the wound is close to the heart. She shakes her head. \nCHARLIE It's no good... \nHaven knows it. He takes her hand and squeezes it. \nHAVEN I'll get someone -- \nCHARLIE Stay here. \nHaven stares grimly at her face. She gives him a faint smile. \nCHARLIE Tell me something... \nHAVEN Sure. \nCHARLIE This gets us all. This doesn't count. \nHAVEN (softly) No... \nCHARLIE Tell me something -- on the square. \nShe holds herself tight a moment; then looks at him again, the faint smile returning. \nCHARLIE Did you ever -- love me? \nHAVEN All the time. \nCHARLIE (a whisper) Tell it. \nHAVEN From the first night and the first time of the song. I tried to get away from it, but every time it came back. Every time I tried to get it out of my brain I just pushed it deeper into my heart. It had to be either you or me. \nCHARLIE It's all right. I love you... (as he looks hard at her) Well -- say it. \nHAVEN (softly) I love you. \nShe starts to die. He takes her shoulders in his hands as though to kiss her or hold her back to life. Her voice is almost a whisper. \nCHARLIE See you... in China. \n", "test3_id": 1490}

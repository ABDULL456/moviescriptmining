{"train": "CROUPIER There's a sucker getting hot with the dice at Ed's table. \nHe turns away. Prince sits still, his eyes on Charlie, his slim fingers at an habitual trick, that of idly stacking dice in a little pillar and then picking the pillar aloft by holding the lowest dice pinched between the thumb and forefinger, NOT by the edges, but by the sides. Now he does it as he watches Charlie's face. Her eyes glance again at the disappearing back of Haven. The sense of fascination seems to have gotten her, too. Then she realizes the presence of Prince and his shrewd gaze. She looks at him coolly. \nCHARLIE Well -- cool him off. \nPrince flips the dice into his palm and rises... \nEXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT \nThe board sidewalk has given way to a rutty dirt road. Now the racket of the saloon street is just a ghost of noise, the road dark and silent. Haven has emerged from the saloon. He glances up the street. Fifty yards ahead, Stellman is walking slowly. Stellman pauses, shoots a quick glance backwards, then goes on. Haven follows, going leisurely up the street after Stellman. \nANGLE on a corner as Stellman turns it, pauses and waits. When Haven reaches it, Stellman goes on in silence. \nEXT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT \nAs Stellman reaches it, pauses and glances behind him. Then he rings a bell. Haven comes up and waits in silence, glancing at the dark interior. A woman's face now peers through the door window and then the door opens. Stellman enters quickly and Haven follows. \nINT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT \nAs Stellman and Haven follow Mrs. Caslon to a rear door. Looking around, Haven notes in the shadows a desk and in a corner the big safe. (This room is described in a subsequent scene.) So as to emit the least light, Mrs. Caslon lets Stellman and Haven go through, then quickly follows them and quickly shuts the door. \nINT. MRS. CASLON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nIt is remarkably neat and elegant inside. As Haven, glancing around, pauses inside, he finds himself facing a burly uniformed cavalry officer, captain's bars gleaming on the side of his collar. The captain is big and broad and scowling. He is standing by the fireplace and his eyes are boring into Haven's with curiosity and perhaps, suspicion. Stellman steps forward as Haven and the captain are measuring each other. \nSTELLMAN Captain Iles -- the Commanding Officer of the Post. \nHaven gives a casual nod. \nSTELLMAN Mr. Haven -- sir. \nIles looks him up and down. Haven hands him an envelope which he slips into his tunic without removing his gaze from Haven. \nILES I see you finally got here. \nHAVEN (pleasantly) I seem to finally get everywhere. \nThey eye each other, Iles scowling, Haven thinly smiling. The sense of conflict is already between them. \nILES (introducing) Mrs. Caslon, -- Mr. Haven. \nShe nods and smiles warmly. \nILES You've met Mr. Stellman. \nHaven nods. \nSTELLMAN It came off beautifully. He picks a very good fight. In fact, I think I'm still a little sore at him. \nILES (grunting) Sit down, Mr. Haven. \nHAVEN Thank you, Captain. \nHe sits down. Iles is still studying Haven. \nILES So you're operating under sealed orders. \nHaven nods agreeably. \nILES (disgruntled) All this mumbo jumbo is characteristic of the Military Information Department. \nHAVEN We use it as sparingly as possible. \nIles pulls out a cigar, lights it, sizing Haven up. \nILES I've been in this territory for a number of years -- and I think it might be a little rougher here than a suburb of Washington, D.C. \nHAVEN Very possibly. \nILES Then why is M.I.D. sending you out here? \nHAVEN Because two soldiers have been murdered. \nILES And they think I can't handle that? \nHAVEN They merely know you haven't. \nThere is a tight little silence, while Iles formulates his dislike for this newcomer. \nILES I have only ninety-four men on the post, with Indian trouble up north. The War Department has refused to send reinforcements, or am I boring you? \nHAVEN (looking bored) I'm not the War Department. \nILES (explaining) The two soldiers were killed while escorting one of the gold stages. \nHAVEN (quietly) Is escorting gold a function of your command? \nHaven nods and they sip. \nHAVEN What mine did the two soldiers try to convoy the gold from? \nMRS. CASLON My mine -- The Argus. \nHAVEN (smiling a little) That brings me to a question I decided not to ask. \nMRS. CASLON (smiling back at him) Then I'll answer it first. Captain Iles has asked me to marry him. \nHAVEN I can understand that. \nMRS. CASLON (quietly) But you can't understand why Captain Iles should be involved in the gold business. \nHAVEN (smiling) I do now. \nMRS. CASLON It isn't just mine. You must realize there's a lot of gold from all over the territory stored at the post warehouse. \nHAVEN How much. \nMRS. CASLON Perhaps as much as half a million. (worried now) In fact, I have about fifty thousand in my safe now. \nHAVEN Who is doing all this? \nMRS. CASLON I don't know... that's the worst part of it... not knowing. \nHAVEN (puts down the glass, pats her shoulder with casual reassurance) I might find out. \nHe starts for the door and she follows him. At the open door he pauses. \nMRS. CASLON Don't get into trouble -- \nHAVEN That's why I'm here. \nMRS. CASLON I know, but -- \nHAVEN Don't worry about it. Trouble and I are old enemies. We understand each other. (he grins at her) Goodnight. \nMRS. CASLON (smiling again) Good luck. \nHaven walks out and she closes the door thoughtfully and turns away. In a moment the door opens and Haven reenters and crosses to her much in the manner that we have seen Captain Iles do so. Haven stops. \nHAVEN You didn't tell me your husband's name. \nMRS. CASLON Ben. \nHAVEN (repeating it) Ben. \nHe turns and goes out the door. Mrs. Caslon stands smiling after him. The smile fades for a moment -- then she dismisses it with a shrug. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nAs Haven saunters along. He pauses, glances up at a sign that reads: HOTEL. Then he enters the dingy building. \nINT. HOTEL - NIGHT \nAs Haven enters the small dismal lobby, and goes over to the desk, where a little man, Orville Weekly sits, singing to himself softly and strumming an accompaniment on a battered guitar. As Haven stands there the clerk finishes the verse about the stranger. Haven nods approval. The clerk looks at him shrewdly. \nORVILLE Evenin' stranger. \nHAVEN You must know everybody in town. \nORVILLE Everybody but one. I don't know you. \nHAVEN What's your name? You seem to be a pretty clever fellow. \nORVILLE Orville Weekly, and I can't be a total blank. I been here six years and I ain't dead yet. \nHAVEN Have you got a vacant room? \nORVILLE Day, week, month? \nHAVEN I don't always know. And the way you talk a man couldn't be very sure. \nORVILLE Then it's eight bucks, cash in advance. \nHaven puts down the money; the clerk spins the registry to him, watches as Haven signs it. And he can read that way. \nORVILLE From Arizona, huh? \nHAVEN No -- I always put down where I'm going next -- so I won't forget. \nThe clerk spits, hands him a key. \nORVILLE Room ten -- end of the hall. Make your own bed. Furnish your own towels. Your bag's over there. \nMick is not quite sure. \nMICK What's keeping him? \nPRINCE I think he's wondering if he couldn't do more good here. \nHaven senses now it is a little game they're playing together on him. His smile remains. He reaches for the bottle, his hand grasping the base of it, just as Mick reaches for it too, clenching the top. Mick lifts at it; Haven's hand holds. They look at each other as this little game of strength goes on. \nMICK You aren't very friendly, are you, mister? \nHAVEN (quoting) A friend to all is a friend to none. \nPRINCE You ought to learn not to pick 'em so easy, like you do your cousins. \nHAVEN (indicating Charlie) Ask her? \nCHARLIE (coolly) I never saw him before in my life. \nThat does it. Mick wrenches at the bottle, and as he does so, Haven releases his grip. The bottle shoots up. The wine spills over Mick's face and clothes. Infuriated, Mick flings the bottle at Haven, but Haven ducks as he comes out of the chair. The bottle crashes against the wall, and Haven's fist crashes against Mick. The big man grunts and staggers back, but he doesn't drop. As Haven sets himself, he is suddenly pinned from behind by two bouncers. Mick stands still, staring at him, his cut lip bleeding. \nMICK (icily) You're too little to make that big a mistake. \nHAVEN You want to correct me or just bleed at the mouth? \nThere is a dead silence. At the crap table the dice read seven but no one looks at them, all turning toward the scene. A minor rises and the girl on his lap hits the floor. A drunk steals a drink and no one sees him. (Business with glass) Prince looks on coldly. Mark Bristow, moving up from the dice table, pauses and stares. \nMICK (coldly) Bring him outside. \nThe two bouncers start with Haven toward the door, Mick following. A rear rises and men begin following in their silent wake. Only the guy at the piano keeps on playing: he never stops. \nANGLE on Charlie as she rises. Bristow and Prince have sauntered over to her as the place empties, leaving only the piano player. \nBRISTOW What happened? \nCHARLIE (casually) A misunderstanding. \nPRINCE Did you find out what he wants? \nCHARLIE (starting out) He wanted to be my cousin. (they follow her) Only I haven't any aunts or uncles. (still casually) But you never know -- and the least I can do is bury him. \nPrince lets go with one of his rare smiles as he looks admiringly at Charlie. They reach the door. The crowd opens for them a little. \nEXT. SALOON - NIGHT \nAs Mick and Haven come out; the crowd makes a noisy clearing. There are bets going down. As soon as the crowd has formed an open space, Haven wheels and smacks Mick across the face hitting with the heel of the hand, so that Mick rocks back almost going down. There is dead silence. Mick sets himself for the Kill, as he peels his coat. \nBristow is shaking with excitement. \nBRISTOW Mick will kill him. \nCHARLIE That's ten to one. \nBRISTOW (grinning) I don't like the other fellow's chances, but I'm a sucker for odds. \nCHARLIE You should always bet on a champion. Then you can only lose once. \nBRISTOW You give ten to one...? (she nods) I'll take it. \nCHARLIE You're down. A thousand to a hundred. \nAs they stare at the fight -- \nFULL SHOT - fight scene. As Mick is slowly advancing toward Haven. He suddenly swings a haymaker which Haven easily ducks, another and another that Haven evades. \nHAVEN Don't miss so much. You'll got tired. \nMick misses again, fiercely and Haven cracks him one in the midriff. Then steps out fast and waits. \nMick charges and Haven catches him full in the mouth. It stops Mick, and then Haven socks him again, this time with the butt of his hand -- open palm -- on the nose. Mick is surprised, tasting the blood on his hurt lips. \nANGLE on Charlie, Mark and Prince, as they watch. Charlie's eyes are fixed with a kind of admiration on Haven. Prince watches without interest. Mark is tense and excited. \nBRISTOW He can fight a little. \nCHARLIE A little won't be enough. \nBut you feel she wishes it might... \nANGLE on the fight. \nMICK Stand still and fight. \nAs Mick closes again, Haven stops quickly to one side, clipping him behind the ear as he goes by. But this time Mick keeps after Haven and finally connects. It is more of a push than a clean hit, but even so the force of it drives Haven off balance and he sprawls on his back. As Mick, sensing victory, charges, Haven knows he can't get to his feet in time, so he turns his body and springs at Mick's knees shoulder first. The impact spills Mick on his face; before he can recover, Haven dives on him, hands flat on his own chest and palms turned out. His body crashes heavily, angling across Mick's head, and Haven's savagely pushing hands mash the other man's face into the hard ground. Then he rolls clear and comes to his feet, breathing easily, waiting. Mick gets up, shaking his head to clear it, mad and hurt. As he closes ponderously in on Haven, his booted foot suddenly shoots out. Haven twists his knee cap away but takes the blow on the inside of his thigh, numbing the leg so that he almost goes down. And now Mick gets to him. His great arms close around Haven's waist, his hands locked in the small of Haven's back. Haven braces himself against the crushing squeeze, tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spine, but there is nothing he can do against the implacable brute power of the other man. \nThe sweat stands out on Haven's face as Mick's great strength bends him over farther and farther. He must do something, and soon, or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave. Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off the ground. Mick, suddenly finding Haven's full weight pulling him forward, crashes down on top of him. With all the strength left in him, Haven brings his knee to the pit of Mick's stomach; as Mick's hold breaks, Haven rolls clear. \nNow they are both hurt. Haven's ribs and chest are so bruised that it is agony to take a breath. He knows it has to end quickly or he is done for, and he goes all out. As Mick tries to close with him again, he stands his ground and throws pile-driver punches to Mick's midsection; as Mick finally lowers his arms to cover his body, Haven shifts his attack to the face. This is not Mick's style of fighting, but as he lashes back clumsily and angrily, each time he touches Haven it is with punishing power. Toe to toe, they slug it out, the belt now unwound and dangling from Mick's fist, both men groggy but both refusing to go down. Finally Mick is helpless to protect himself, but Haven hasn't got power left to knock him off those sturdy legs. Gathering himself, Haven hurls his body shoulder first at Mick's chest but he miscalculates, glances off and falls flat on his face. As he rolls over, dogged and slow with exhaustion, he sees that his weight has staggered Mick; the big man has taken a step back, and now he starts to walk forward. Dazed and blind with pain, he passes Haven, staggers forward until the tie-rail stops him. There he stands, his hands on the rail, moving his head from side to side like a wounded animal. \nOrville strums the strings as Haven drinks, having a little trouble with his sore hands. \nHAVEN The way you run this dump I knew you must be good at something else. \nORVILLE Some call me the town poet -- and some the village idiot. Who am I to question either? How you feel today? \nHAVEN Like I crawled here from Kansas City. \nORVILLE Well, it figures to make you pretty famous. Fact, people been askin' for you already. \nHAVEN Who? \nORVILLE That gold mine lady -- Mrs. Caslon. \nHAVEN That's nice. \nORVILLE Couldn't do better. And Charlie. \nHAVEN Charlie? \nORVILLE No. less. \nHAVEN You seem impressed. \nORVILLE Why not? Charlie owns a piece of everything, includin' the undertaker and the sheriff. \nHAVEN The stage line too? \nORVILLE Everything but the Wednesday Bible Class. Even owns a piece of me. (grins) Takes your money while you're here, and makes you pay to leave. \nHAVEN (putting down the cup) When you get the next verse I'd like to hear it. \nORVILLE Can't find no word to rhyme with Mick Marion. \nHAVEN (as he turns away) Carrion. \nHe walks off. Orville ponders this, scowling into space. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN \nIles is pacing the floor. Mrs. Caslon is occupied with some minor domestic chore. Stellman is standing by the door. Iles is a ball of fire. \nILES Of all the stupid bonehead plays! What did he fight about -- don't tell me a woman? \nSTELLMAN That's what they tell me. \nILES Who started it? \nSTELLMAN I don't know, but Haven finished it. \nILES That probably strikes you as a very admirable thing. \nStellman shrugs. \nILES Well, I don't think so! I have men who can use their fists. Why didn't they send a man who could use his brains! \nThere is a knock at the door. Iles gives her a look; then glares at Stellman. \nILES Well -- open it up! \nStellman opens the door and Haven walks in. He pauses, glances around and smiles. Mrs. Caslon smiles at him. \nHAVEN Hello, Mrs. Caslon. \nShe smiles and nods. Irons. Haven can feel the surcharged air. Deliberately he assumes that casual manner that so burns the Captain. \nHAVEN Captain... Lieutenant... \nILES (coldly) Mr. Haven, we may not have very much around here that pleases you, but we do have a strict post regulation against brawling in the town. Now would you like to explain what happened last night? \nHAVEN (smiling) I came here to return Mrs. Caslon's call. \nIles glances sharply at Mrs. Caslon, and then to Haven. \nILES (indicating a chair) Sit down. \nHaven sits, wincing a little. But he beams at Iles, who now picks a book off the table. \nILES This book I have in my hand is the Army Register, 1882. \nHaven inspects his knuckles. \nILES I am now going to read from it. (finds the place; reads) \"Haven, John Martin, born Ohio 1852. Appointed Second Lieutenant. Promoted First Lieutenant 20th Infantry, March 1880; reduced in rank to 2nd Lieutenant January 12, 1881.\" \nHe tosses the book on the table, glaring at Haven. \nHAVEN You're not that sinister. Last night with the wet towels you were Florence Nightingale in silk stockings. (stretching his legs, looking at her) Have you got a match? \nShe comes over with one and lights his pipe. \nHAVEN There's one in my pocket but I hate to reach for it... thanks. \nShe takes his hand and looks at the cut knuckle. \nCHARLIE Sit there. \nShe walks out of the room and he watches her; then around the room. In a moment she returns, pulls up a chair in the front of him and sits down. She has bandages and a little jar of ointment. \nHAVEN (smiles) Now you're Florence Nightingale again. \nShe takes one of his bruised hands, and as she bandages his hands slowly, carefully and rather expertly, they talk. \nCHARLIE Why did you pick that fight? \nHAVEN I thought you did. \nCHARLIE (smiling) Really? \nHAVEN You could have insisted I was your cousin. \nCHARLIE Perhaps that isn't the way I felt about you. \nHAVEN (as his knuckle hurts) Ouch! \nShe smiles at him and then goes on. \nHAVEN Where did you get the name of Charlie? \nCHARLIE It was my father's. My name is Charlene, but -- \nHe watches her face. \nHAVEN I like that better... Charlene... (she doesn't answer) This'll be the first time I ever worked for a woman. \nCHARLIE (giving him a glance) What makes you think you're going to work for me? \nHAVEN You sent for me. \nCHARLIE (finishing the bandage) How's that? \nShe stands up. Haven looks at her and ignores his bandaged hands. \nHAVEN Beautiful. \nCHARLIE (walking towards the window) All right, I sent for you. I was doing a nice quiet business. That was because everybody was afraid of Mick. Now every time a man has enough drinks in him to feel rugged he'll try to do what you did. \nHAVEN I wouldn't. \nCHARLIE But they will. \nHAVEN That's not the job I want. I don't intend to start at the bottom. I've been there. It's too crowded. \nCHARLIE (coolly) Where do you want to start? \nHAVEN With the money. \nCHARLIE And what will you do for it? \nHAVEN Anything -- except hang. How did you get -- all this? \nCHARLIE I learned one thing from my father. As long as men think they can beat the tables, all you have to do is get a table. Sometimes they run out of cash and I find myself with new responsibilities. \nHAVEN Such as -- \nCHARLIE A couple of stores for one thing. \nHAVEN I can't see myself behind a counter. \nCHARLIE A sawmill, and a logging camp. The logging camp's a long way from town. \nHaven gets the meaning and shakes his head. \nCHARLIE I own the stage line from here to West Rim City, but that's a dud. \nHAVEN Why? \nCHARLIE Outlaws. The money was in gold shipments. Now the mines won't ship it. \nHAVEN I'll take that job. \nCHARLIE You mean ride shot-gun? \nHAVEN I mean run the line. \nCHARLIE (absently) Four to one. \nHAVEN Pass -- (he flips the pebble, misses) What's the army got to do with Mrs. Caslon? \nCHARLIE She's engaged to Captain Iles. \nHAVEN Iles? \nCHARLIE He's the army boss here. \nHAVEN (smiling) If you're going to frighten me, the least you can do is hold my hand. \nHe holds out his hand and takes hers. Abruptly she starts to rise, very piqued and unable to disguise it. Haven rises too. Takes her hand to help her from the boulder. Then stops and gazes at her, smiling. \nHAVEN This is where you ought to slip -- and I should catch you and kiss you. \nCHARLIE No chance. \nShe starts down; Haven moves too, but it is he who slips and she who has to catch him. Her arms go automatically around him. His around her. Before he can act himself, she holds him tight and kisses him. It is a long kiss and on it we: \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING \nOrville is strumming the guitar as Haven enters. He pauses as Haven comes near on the way to his room. \nORVILLE Hey. \nHaven halts, walks over. \nHAVEN You finish that song? \nORVILLE Never do. \nHAVEN Why not? \nORVILLE It's my fatality. I never finish nothin'. \nHAVEN Maybe it's just as well. \nORVILLE Maybe so. I thought I'd tell you. Goin' back to your room will be a waste of time. \nHAVEN It will? \nORVILLE I don't know what happened on that buggy ride, but somebody came and took all your truck. \nHe strums the strings. \nHAVEN And, naturally, you didn't do anything about it? \nORVILLE What could I do? \nHAVEN You could have called the sheriff. \nORVILLE Set a thief to catch a thief, eh? \nHAVEN I paid my rent and I think I'm entitled to know who stole my clothes. \nHe starts to his room. \nORVILLE (calling after him) A man couldn't ask for no prettier thief. \nINT. HAVEN'S ROOM \nHaven enters, glances around, sees the bag is missing. He goes to the window, sees Charlie at saloon window across the areaway. He leans out. \nHAVEN Hey! \nCharlie moves the window, smiling. \nCHARLIE (leaning out) Hello... I've been wondering where you were. \nHAVEN I lost my shirt. \nCHARLIE You didn't imagine that I'd let you live in that hotel, did you? I want you available -- in case of trouble. \nHAVEN Where did I move? \nCHARLIE In a very nice room upstairs. \nHAVEN (taking out his pipe) When can you get my things back to the hotel, Charlie? \nShe stares at him, the smile fading on her face. \nCHARLIE Why don't you take them yourself? \nHAVEN What makes you so anxious to take this chance? \nGODDARD What makes you? \nHAVEN I'm on commission. With me it's a matter of money. \nGODDARD And you think it's something else with me? \nHAVEN I can't think of anything else -- except curiosity. \nGODDARD (gazing out drily) Some moonlight after all... \nFULL SHOT as the stage rockets off into the darkness. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRY - NIGHT \nThe stage is now heading uphill, the gentle slope at the beginning of the foothills. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRY - NIGHT \nThe road is steeper now, and winding. \nANOTHER ANGLE. The road is cut out of the side of the mountain, leaving a sheer slope on one side, and high, thick trees and brush on the other. As the stage follows a bend in the road, a rider leaps out and grabs the lead horse. The stage lurches crazily and almost overturns as it slows to a stop. Before Haven can free his hands from the reins to go for his gun, two shadowy figures, handkerchiefs helping the darkness mask their faces, have jumped out onto the road ahead and have him covered. \nBANDIT All right -- stretch! \nHaven and Goddard raise their arms. Another bandit, from the hillside, calls out: \nSECOND BANDIT Pile out with the hands up. \nTwo shotgun barrels cover the side of the stags. Goddard gets off, hands in air. \nFIRST BANDIT (to Haven) Get down. \nHaven obeys, to join Goddard in the road, as the bandits converge on the stage. There are five or six of them. Two come up behind Haven and Goddard. \nFIRST BANDIT Turn around and keep 'em high. \nThe sacks are being loaded on a pack horse. Haven turns around. \nHAVEN Take it easy. They hang you just the same. \nSECOND BANDIT You, Goddard, start walking. \nHe gives Goddard a none too gentle shove. Goddard moves on up the road in the darkness. \nA FEW YARDS UP THE ROAD. Mick is waiting by his horse, his gun drawn. We hear the steps of Goddard and the bandit. \nSECOND BANDIT'S VOICE That's far enough. \nThe footsteps halt. Mick aims and fires. \nBY WAGON. There is a half grunt, half groan from Goddard. Haven turns as if to protest and then crumples as a gun fells him. \nCLOSE SHOT - Haven, lying face down on the ground, unconscious. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. SKY \nAs day breaks. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN \nCLOSE SHOT - Haven. Haven comes to, gradually clearing the cobwebs. Then suddenly he remembers Goddard and the shot. He makes his way to where Goddard's body lies a few feet up the road. Goddard's right hand is half in his hip pocket, as if in his last dying moment he was reaching for something. As Haven pulls the hand out, he sees that Goddard's fingers have closed around his wallet. Puzzled, Haven opens the wallet. There is a stiff-backed daguerreotype of his wife, an expired Union Pacific Railroad pass, an express receipt, a souvenir bank-note of the Confederacy, and a small, closely- folded piece of paper. Unfolding this, Haven sees the top line: \n\"To Whom It May Concern\" \nHE READS FURTHER: \n\"This certifies that the bearer, James Goddard, is operating as a legally deputized detective for Wells Fargo Stage and Express Company.\" \nHaven replaces the papers and lifts Goddard's body, carries it to the stage and places it on the floor. He removes Goddard's gun and shell belt and straps it on, closing the stage door. Haven's face is grim as he studies the ground nearby. The sticky mud shows clearly the new tracks of the bandits' horses. As he starts unhitching one of his horses from the wagon traces, we \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRY - MORNING \nA tiny clearing on a brush-filled knoll, where the remains of a cooking fire are still visible, the ashes scattered over the tamped-down ground. CAMERA PANS OVER TO Haven, on horseback, as he studies the scene. This is where he evidently made camp for the night. He dismounts, sifts the ashes through his fingers to feel their warmth. He cannot be far behind. Then he turns his attention to the trail loading away. Inspection reveals that it divides, one group of fresh tracks heading towards town, another smaller group further into the mountains. He decides to follow the latter. As he mounts and rides off: \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRY - MORNING \nAs Haven's wagon lumbers in. He looks curiously at the main office. No one is in sight, but as he draws nearer, the swarthy hard-faced man, Pete, comes out on to the porch. \nPETE Hey, you! \nHaven looks at him. \nPETE You see a rider comin' up? \nHAVEN Nope. \nPETE You sure? \nHAVEN Haven't even seen a lizard. Where do I put this stuff? \nPETE Where did you put it before? \nHAVEN I never did. I'm a new driver. I think it's grub. \nPETE Take it to the cook shack. \nHaven flicks the reins, moves on. Pete watches suspiciously. Haven moves on to the cook shack outside of which the cook is busy dumping a pail of slop. \nHAVEN (pulling up) You the cook? \nCOOK Nah. I just wear this hat to keep the flies out of my hair. \nHAVEN It don't matter to me, brother. I just haul this grub. I'd just as soon haul it back. \nCOOK Take it next door. \nHaven pulls up by the warehouse next door and gets down. There is nobody around, so he starts wrestling with the food crates himself, taking the first one into the warehouse. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nIt is big, barnlike, piled with provisions and equipment. Haven stares around; carries the crate to where a similar stack of crates are piled. Lowering the crate he notes a shiny object, picks it up. It is a button from an army uniform. He pockets it as his attention is distracted by two horsemen passing outside. Haven goes out to continue unloading. \nEXT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY \nAs the two horsemen ride up to Pete and dismount. Ben and Sam are standing there. \nPETE (to the horsemen) Any luck? \nBEN No sign of Joe. But there's the tracks of another horse, circling the mill and coming back on the road just north. (he points) \nPETE That's bad. \nHe glances toward the wagon where Haven is working. \nPETE Let's go and look at this guy again. \nThe five men move down to Haven's wagon. \nANGLE ON wagon and Haven, as he sees them come. His lip tightens; then he relaxes and goes on lifting a crate. He pauses as they come up and stand around him, their eyes fixed on: \nPETE You -- \nHaven looks at him. \nPETE You sure you didn't see no rider? \nHAVEN Look -- you want me to say I saw a rider? I'll say it. I'll say I saw a ghost. It don't make any difference to me. \nPETE When did you get this job? \nHAVEN Yesterday. \nPETE What for? \nHAVEN It's the system. If I don't work I don't eat. I never been able to find any way to beat it. \nPETE Who hired you? \nHAVEN (blandly) Mr. Haven. \nPETE The guy that had the fight? \nHAVEN Same fellow. \nIt is a risky little moment; Haven eases both bruised hands into his coat pockets. \nPETE Friend of yours? \nHAVEN (innocently) Who? \nPETE This Haven. \nHAVEN Any man who gives me a job is my friend. Look, I'm working, I haul this stuff out here. Nobody wants to tell me where to dump it. Everybody wants to know what I'm doin' and what I haven't seen. I don't know. I get thirty cents an hour. How smart does that have to make me? \nHAVEN Not many of the hands here, are there? \nCOOK All up at the logging camp. \nHAVEN Much obliged. That was real fine mulligan. \nThe cook isn't interested; he spits as he slices a potato. \nEXT. SAWMILL OFFICE - DAY \nPete, Sam and Ben are waiting beside the gear box as we see Haven bringing the wagon up. \nBEN Maybe this isn't such a good idea. \nPETE Who said it was? I just want that gold outa here the easiest and quickest way. \nThey watch Haven as he pulls up the wagon. Pete looks hard at his face. Haven has the pipe in his mouth again, looking very blandly at them. \nPETE You see this box? \nHAVEN Sure. \nPETE It goes to Prince. Know who Prince is? \nHAVEN Nope. \nPETE He runs things for Charlie. Know who Charlie is? \nHAVEN Sure. \nHaven climbs aboard. They look hard at him. He has stuck his pipe in his mouth. He smiles at them and he picks up the reins. \nPETE One thing... \nHaven pauses. \nPETE That's a gear box you're hauling back and it's got to be repaired. And you tell Charlie that if it ain't repaired we might have to shut down quick. You got that? \nHAVEN I got it. \nPETE All right -- then get out of here! \nHaven flicks the reins, grins at them and drives off. Ben is still worried and stares after the departing wagon. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY \nThis is deserted country on the way to town. When the land slopes steeply from the road down into a kind of wash, Haven halts the wagon. He glances around. No sign of life. He takes a hammer and chisel out of the tool box beside the seat, crawls to the crate and prys it open. His cargo is gold. Satisfied, he replaces the pried board, then pushes the crate over the side. It topples down the bank, vanishes in the brush at the bottom of the wash. With one more glance around, Haven resumes his seat in the wagon, puts a match to his pipe, and sends the horses forward at a faster clip. \nDISSOLVE \nLONG SHOT OF POST - DAY \nDISSOLVE \nINT. CAPTAIN ILES' OFFICE - POST \nIles is pacing up and down as Stellman enters quietly. Iles promptly faces him. \nILES Well -- what have you found out? \nSTELLMAN Goddard's body -- shot in the back. \nILES And no sign of Haven? \nSTELLMAN One horse was missing. They might have taken him away on that. They wouldn't kidnap him if they'd killed him. \nILES Why would they kill Goddard? \nSTELLMAN He was a Wells Fargo Detective. \nILES I see... he was a man they couldn't handle, so they shot him. But Haven wasn't killed. \nSTELLMAN He may have followed them on the missing horse. \nILES And he may be fishing for trout in the Verde River. Why do I always learn everything last? Why must everything be common gossip by the time it reaches me? \nSTELLMAN I don't know, sir. \nILES Neither do I, but I'll find out. The Army didn't banish me out here to set up a listening post. Bring the man in, dead or alive. If he's alive, arrest him. \nSTELLMAN But can you arrest him? \nILES No, but I can take any living human being into custody -- or am I mistaken in this too? \nSTELLMAN No, sir. \nMark stares in amazement. \nHAVEN Put it down. (as Mark obeys) I then followed the horses bearing the gold to a sawmill -- \nEXT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - EVENING \nMick is standing outside, holding the arm of Jerry as he talks to the kid. Beside him stands Pete Yore's man, Ben. \nMICK You sure it was Haven you met? \nJERRY Don't I know my own boss? \nMICK (giving him a shove) Go in and get a beer. \nINT. MARK'S OFFICE - EVENING \nAs Haven finishes his statement. He is again at the window, glancing out. Perhaps he has seen the incident with Mick and Jerry across the crowded street. \nHAVEN ...After I left there, I opened the crate. The gold was in it. \nHe turns back into the room. Mark is looking at him with puzzled wonder, his face drawn and tense. \nHAVEN That's all. \nHe smiles slightly. The wonder leaves Mark's face. Urbane cunning replaces it. \nBRISTOW Not quite. \nHAVEN No. \nBRISTOW What did you do about the gold? \nHAVEN I came to the conclusion that I finally had enough money to need a lawyer. \nMark smiles thinly, licking his lips. \nBRISTOW (needing a drink again) Have you seen the sheriff? \nHAVEN I've heard about him, and I still came to you. \nBRISTOW I see. Well, as a lawyer, my advice would be -- \nHAVEN I didn't come here for advice. \nBRISTOW I'm wondering what you get out of this. \nHAVEN It makes me more valuable to somebody alive than dead. \nBRISTOW Who? \nHAVEN I don't know... yet. \nBRISTOW (levelly) Now I'm wondering what I get out of it. \nORVILLE They been here lookin' for you, the men. \nHAVEN I thought they might. \nORVILLE I told them you was out. \nHAVEN I was. I just came in the back way. \nHaven lights the pipe. \nHAVEN You finish that song? \nORVILLE I had her finished, but what good is it? It was about your death. \nHAVEN Keep it a couple of days -- may be you can still use it. \nHe strolls back towards his room and CAMERA FOLLOWS him, the strumming of the guitar again SOUNDING in the b.g. \nINT. HAVEN'S ROOM - EVENING \nHaven shuts the door, pulls off his boots and gun belt, lies on the bed and stares at the ceiling. His face is sad and he looks tired. The MUSIC from the saloon comes over, Charlie's song... he closes his eyes and in a moment falls asleep... \nWIPE \nEXT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - EVENING \nAs iles rides up. He is just about to enter, after dismounting, when Mark Bristow comes out of the office. Mark smiles and nods at the officer. \nBRISTOW Good evening, Captain. \nILES (grimly) Any news about Haven in town? \nBRISTOW I just saw Haven. \nMRS. CASLON George -- you're getting to be a hard man to deal with. \nILES I'm getting to deal with some hard men. \nIron-faced, he starts out, remembers again, softens against his will, comes back from the door and kisses her cheek and then leaves. CAMERA stays on Mrs. Caslon as she watches him go. She smiles slightly, puts the envelope in the safe, and then from it takes a six-gun, looks at it and begins dusting it with her handkerchief as we \nDISSOLVE \nBRISTOW You certainly are a careful man. \nHAVEN I have to be. I live a careless life. \nHaven begins washing his face in the washbowl, and then combing his hair and readjusting his somewhat rumpled shirt. Mark watches him. \nHAVEN What about the deposition? \nBRISTOW She has it. It's in her safe. \nHAVEN Good. \nBRISTOW What do we do now? \nHAVEN We call on Charlie. \nThere is a little nervous sweat on Mark's hands; he wipes them on his coat. \nBRISTOW It's a dangerous play, Haven. \nHAVEN Is it? \nBRISTOW What if she doesn't believe you? \nHAVEN Then she'll have to believe you. \nBRISTOW That deposition could be a lie. It might not stand up in a court. \nHAVEN You're sure of that? \nBRISTOW Well -- not exactly. \nHAVEN That's it. You're a lawyer and you're not sure. Then how can she gamble on it, either? \nBRISTOW Because she's a gambler. \nHAVEN No, she isn't. (ready to go) We're the gamblers, Mark. Lot's go. \nA little shaken and uncertain, Mark obeys. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. HOTEL - EVENING \nAs Haven and Mark come out. They walk towards the saloon. People look at them curiously. Suddenly, down the street, the sheriff appears, approaching Haven slowly and ominously. Sensing a gun fight, people vanish. Purely from instinct, Mark deserts Haven's side in a hurried walk towards the saloon, eyeing both. Haven comes on leisurely. The sheriff has stopped in his tracks and has his gun out. A woman clutches her child to her skirt. Men stand stockstill, watching. A crowd forms at the entrance to Charlie's. Haven walks slowly forward until he reaches the waiting sheriff. He looks him over with a smile of contempt. \nSHERIFF You're under arrest! \nHAVEN (pausing) For what? \nSHERIFF For the murder of James Goddard -- and robbery under arms! \nHAVEN (casually) I've heard about you. You don't appear to understand the functions of your office. (taking sheriff's gun and breaking it open) You've missed the whole point of your profession. (showing him) Even your gun isn't loaded. (Haven loads it as it goes on) I suggest that you start all over again, with this point in mind: the duty of a peace officer is to arrest the culprit of a crime -- not the victim. \nHaven hands him back the now loaded gun and walks away towards the saloon, leaving the sheriff standing there, a completely dumbfounded and bepuzzled man. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - NIGHT \nThe place is roaring. Haven enters, followed by Mark. The guy at the piano is playing as always. Haven and Mark go slowly to the bar, eyes following them. The noise softens almost to silence, except the piano, Cowering, Mark sticks close to Haven. \nAt the dice table, Prince stares coldly, hands another man the stick and walks away to the stairway, his eyes seeking Mick Marion who is also staring at Haven. Prince nods to Mick as he goes. \nMED. SHOT at bar -- as Haven and Mark loan against it. Ernie is looking at him curiously; then towards Mick. Haven doesn't follow the glance, but Mark does. \nERNIE Rye? \nHAVEN Two. \nErnie gets them. Haven glances at the piano. Mick who had stood there has now vanished. Haven smiles. The drinks arrive. \nBRISTOW (gulping his drink) This is no good. \nHAVEN The bourbon is just as bad. \nBRISTOW I don't mean that. \nHAVEN You want to leave? \nPRINCE What you want is money. \nHaven nods. \nCHARLIE I don't see how going to the law will get it for you. \nHAVEN If you did see how, I'd never get there, would I? \nCHARLIE I'm afraid not. \nHAVEN So it boils down to this: we can make a deal, and all be happy together. \nPRINCE Not as long as you always have something on us. \nHAVEN Unless you also have something on me. \nCHARLIE And how would that be? \nHAVEN When I deliver the gold to you. \nCHARLIE You mean the gear box? \nHAVEN I can even forget I looked inside. So I stole a gear box... I'm still a thief. \nCharlie is silent a moment. Haven lights his pipe. Charlie looks at Mark, pale by the wall. \nPRINCE (indicating Mark) What does he get? \nHAVEN He gets even with you. \nPRINCE Have you lost your mind! \nHAVEN It was all right when he lost his money. \nCHARLIE All right... I'll give him the IOU's... when the gear box is delivered. \nPRINCE (smiling) You don't realize how important it is when a piece of machinery breaks down. It could close the entire sawmill. \nHAVEN I guess I didn't realize it. \nShe looks coolly at Mick and Mark. \nCHARLIE I think that's all. \nMark glances at Haven who nods and Mark leaves in the wake of the grimly departing Mick. Prince lingers. \nCHARLIE (to Haven) You can stay. \nHAVEN (to Prince) I think she was talking to me. \nPrince gets up grimly, his lips tight, the dice held hard in his fingers. He stares at Haven. \nPRINCE You roll nice dice and you bet them jamb up, but some day you'll slip. And when you do, I'll be around to catch you. \nHe turns and walks out. Haven watches him go. \nHAVEN You know, I think he will. \nCHARLIE Then you should be more careful. \nHAVEN The poorhouses are filled with careful men... (knocking out his pipe) ...And so are the graveyards. \nCharlie comes around and sits on the arm of his chair. \nHAVEN You've got a nice perfume. \nCHARLIE Carnation. (she ruffles his hair with her hand) I almost had to have you killed. I'd have hated it. \nHAVEN So would I. \nCHARLIE I'd have missed you... too much. \nHAVEN And too long. \nShe brushes his cheek with her lips. \nCHARLIE (she smiles at him) Did you ever tell a woman you loved her? \nHAVEN All of them. \nCHARLIE How did you get away? \nHAVEN I was always in the doorway when I said it. \nCHARLIE You never said it to me. \nHAVEN Let's go over to the doorway. \nIles picks up the deposition, extends it. \nILES Right here in your own statement! \nHaven glances at him, then at the statement, and then tosses it on the desk and inhales. \nHAVEN I see you did what I expected. \nILES You've gotten a man killed and Mrs. Caslon's gold stolen. Is that far enough? \nHAVEN Not quite. \nILES (rising slowly) Haven -- as far as I'm concerned, this deposition is good enough for me. (indicates the deposition) I want these people arrested. This is all the evidence we need. \nHAVEN I need more. \nILES For what reason? \nHAVEN For the reason I came here... to get the murderers of two soldiers -- not to save somebody's gold. That's a mistake you made. I still don't know who killed them, but I'm going to find out. And when the net is hauled in, they're all going to be in it. (rising) That's my fish -- and you can have the minnows. \nILES (demandingly) When are you returning Mrs. Caslon's gold? \nHAVEN (firmly) That's a matter between myself and Mrs. Caslon. \nThey look hard at each other in silence. \nILES I don't particularly like you -- but I see no reason why you should get yourself deliberately killed. \nHAVEN (smiling again) It won't be deliberate. \nILES What difference does it make how you get killed? Where does it leave me? \nHAVEN Where does it leave me? \nILES (meaning it) Understand this, Haven. You're heading for bad trouble -- and when it comes don't expect any help from me. Is that clear? \nHAVEN (smiling thinly) From the beginning. \nHaven turns and walks out; the door closes behind him. Iles slumps down into his chair. Stellman is smiling faintly at him. \nSTELLMAN Anything else, Sir? \nILES (glumly) Yes, three cigars, a pint of whiskey, and a copy of that confounded Blue Book. \nAs Stellman turns away. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT \nAs Haven saunters in. Orville is, as always, behind the desk. Haven nods at him. \nHAVEN What's the good word? \nORVILLE For you it's not good. You're in bad trouble. \nHAVEN I don't know how you can know so much and move so little. (turning to go) I think I'll try it myself. \nORVILLE Want to leave a call? \nHAVEN That's very nice of you. \nORVILLE What time? \nHAVEN When you're sure everybody in town is in bed -- call me. And if anybody asks for me -- I went to jail. \nHe goes and Orville strums a little jail song. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. COUNTRY - DAY \nHaven, driving a wagon and team of horses, is retracing the road he took back from the sawmill looking for the place where he dumped the bullion. \nCLOSER VIEW of Haven, as he looks for the landmarks. He is whistling softly the tune that Charlie always sings. At last he stops, alights and makes his way down the steep slope, a couple of gunny sacks slung across his shoulder. \nBottom of the gulley as Haven gets there and locates the crate at rest in a clump of brush. The crate has broken from the fall. Haven loads the buckskin bags of gold into the gunny sack and scrambles back up the slope. \nSide of slope as Haven scrambles to the top, he finds himself looking into a six-shooter held in the unwavering hand of Mrs. Caslon. Her eyes are hard and a grim smile plays at the corners of her mouth. \nMRS. CASLON Drop it. \nHaven obeys. \nMRS. CASLON Turn around with your hands up. \nCHARLIE Alone? \nHAVEN No... she had a gun with her. \nPRINCE Did you have one too? \nHAVEN The one she had was in her hand. \nThere is a silence. Prince stares idly at the dice cubes in his hand. Charlie stares straight at Haven. Haven glances at Prince. \nHAVEN This could be that slip you mentioned. \nPrince just stares at him. \nCHARLIE (to Haven) So this nice lady held you up and took the gold, is that it? \nHAVEN It's like saying I got robbed at Sunday school. It's no good, is it? \nPRINCE (looking at him) No, it isn't. \nHAVEN I even had to walk back to town. I think that may be one of the longest walks I ever took. \nPRINCE And one of the last. \nHaven takes a sip of the champagne, Charlie's whole manner has now changed. It is cold and very quiet. \nPRINCE Mick might have killed you, but you fought him with your fists. The sheriff had a gun but you took it away from him. Ben had a gun last night but it didn't seem to scare you. Now this genteol petticoat waves a pistol and you run for your life. \nHAVEN (twirling the wineglass, glancing at Charlie) He makes it sound very silly. \nPRINCE Or I make it sound like what it is: a lie! (he rises) \nHaven reaches in his pocket for a match. Prince, mistaking the gesture, swiftly extracts a small pistol from his belt, covers him. \nPRINCE No. \nHaven extracts the match, with a glance of contempt at Prince; then lights the pipe again. \nHAVEN (smiling faintly) My word doesn't seem very good around here. \nPRINCE You've only got one thing left that's any good here - and that's some gold. \nHAVEN (to Charlie) Is that all I've got? \nCHARLIE Not quite. You've got some time. You've got two hours to get it here. \nThere is a brief silence that punctuates this statement. It has an air of fatal finality, marked by the idle MUSIC of the deaf pianist. Haven puts his pipe away, carefully so that Prince won't get any mistaken ideas. \nHAVEN You want me to fatten you up before you kill me? Is that what you mean? \nCHARLIE I said what I meant -- two hours. \nHaven rises. He brushes some dust off his coat, smiles thinly at Charlie. \nHAVEN I once knew a guy who stole a dime tip from a lunch counter and parlayed it into fifty thousand. I might try that -- but not in two hours. \nShe says nothing; her face carved out of ice. Prince smiles thinly. Haven looks at him, shrugs. He hesitates; then pats Charlie's frigid shoulder. \nHAVEN (to Charlie) You're sweet. \nHe turns and walks slowly out. The dirge of the piano follows him. Prince fingers his pistol a little, tempted. At a look from Charlie he puts it away. Haven goes out. Charlie suddenly leaves the tables and goes quickly up the stairs. Prince watches her with a slow smile, picks up Haven's gun and pockets it... \nWIPE \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nAs Haven leaves the saloon. He pauses, looks around, up at the sky, then down the street. He takes out his pipe and beginning filling it slowly with tobacco, as Mark Bristow comes hurrying across the street. \nMOVING SHOT of Haven as he walks very slowly, filling the pipe, and Mark comes alongside and walks with him. Haven hardly glances at him. \nBRISTOW I've been looking for you. Where have you been? \nHAVEN I took a walk in the country. \nBRISTOW Did you get it for her? \nHAVEN No. (pausing in front of the hotel) Sorry. \nMED. SHOT of Haven and Mark outside the hotel. Mark is afraid and puzzled. He keeps staring at Haven's face. \nBRISTOW But that was the deal. You agreed to -- \nHe pauses as two men walk by. \nBRISTOW If you're trying to pull something -- \nHAVEN (finished with the pipe) You want to listen? \nBRISTOW Why? Did Haven -- \nPRINCE No, he didn't. \nBRISTOW Then I don't understand -- \nPRINCE We don't think they're going to be any good. \nMark stands there. The papers slip from his fingers. He knows what Prince means. But his mouth hardens in an effort. \nBRISTOW I didn't have anything to do with it. All I did was write it. I'm not in on this. I can still make them good. (he puts a couple back on the desk) Or I can -- \nCHARLIE What? \nBRISTOW I can do business. (fumbling in his pocket) I got it somewhere. I -- Here -- take a look at this -- the deposition -- (bringing out the deposition) The only copy. \nCHARLIE (coldly) Let's have it. \nBRISTOW (eagerly) Here. \nHands it to her. \nPRINCE What do you want? \nBRISTOW (as Charlie opens the envelope) Nothing. I just want to get out of it. I never had any part of it. This ought to prove that! \nCHARLIE This? \nShe hands him the paper from the envelope. Marks takes it and stares at it. It is absolutely a blank piece of paper. He stands there, bites his lips. He looks wearily around at them, fear making him weak, making him unable to hold the piece of paper, so that it floats to the carpet. \nBRISTOW (at last) It's -- it's a trick. I -- (trying to pull himself together) I'll see about this! He can't do this to me! (moving back towards the door) I'll go and see about this! \nCHARLIE Sure, you see about it. \nHe stops dead in his tracks as Charlie moves towards him with a little pistol, pearl-handled. But she only gives it to him. She has to take his hand and put it in his palm. \nCHARLIE Take this along. \nHe backs out, the little gun in his hand. Mick opens the door. In sudden relief and haste Mark barrels out. They can hear his quick feet on the stairs outside. Prince looks at Charlie. \nPRINCE Something left to wait for? \nCHARLIE (slowly) No. \nPrince gets up and leaves, and Mick, with a grim smile of anticipation follows. Charlie sits slowly down in the chair. The music comes up the stairs and through the door. \nINT. HAVEN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nHaven is lying on the bed, his arms under his head, his eyes on the ceiling. There is a SOUND in the hallway and then a hurried knock at the door. Haven slowly rises, walks to the door. He stands there. The knock SOUNDS again. \nHAVEN Who is it? \nMARK'S VOICE It's me -- Bristow -- let me in. \nHaven opens the door. Mark enters swiftly, the little gun in his hand. Haven shuts the door and locks it. He turns and faces Mark, now pointing the gun. Without a word Haven walks over to the bed and lies down again, looking at the ceiling. Mark follows him with the gun. \nHAVEN You going to shoot me, Mark? \nBRISTOW You double crossed me, Haven. \nHAVEN I did? \nBRISTOW I got the deposition back. I took it to them. \nHaven leans on one elbow, looking at him. \nBRISTOW It wasn't there! It was a piece of blank paper! \nHaven lies back with a short laugh. Mark stares at him in fury. \nBRISTOW Don't you laugh at me! I ought to kill you! \nHAVEN They want you to, Mark. \nHaven again leans on one elbow, looking at Mark and the trembling hand that holds the gun. \nHAVEN And it may be your only out, if you do. But I doubt it. You know why? Because even if you took them my scalp, it wouldn't buy your life. You're in debt and you're broke and you're scared -- and you know far too much. There isn't any way they use you -- alive. Can you think of one? \nMark sits slowly back in the chair, beaten. \nBRISTOW They're going to do it. I know it. They're going to kill me -- (his hand trembles) Why do they have to kill me? \nHAVEN Us, Mark... \nHaven gets up slowly, reaches over and takes the little gun, smiles at it. \nHAVEN This must be hers. \nANGLE on Mick as down the street, with disgust, he lowers his gun. \nANGLE on Prince as from a doorway he watches. Stopping with a shake of his head the intent of a man beside him to shoot. \nFULL SHOT -- street -- as Haven surrenders to the sheriff. \nSHERIFF All right, you -- march. \nHaven obeys, walking up the street -- the sheriff and the sheriff's horse behind him. People watch, appearing now in safety. The sheriff is pretty pleased. \nMOVING SHOT -- of Haven and Sheriff. As they go, Haven's hands still aloft. \nHAVEN You loaded your gun for this? \nSHERIFF No -- you did. \nBack of them can now be seen the figures of Mick and Prince and the other gunman, following at a little distance. Going leisurely, now Haven slows his pace so that the sheriff is closer behind him. \nSHERIFF Come on, you! Keep moving! \nHaven suddenly drops to his knees. The sheriff almost walks over him. The sheriff stumbles with an oath. Haven grapples with him. Haven snatches his gun, drags him by a headlock to the horse, flings him aside and then mounts. A second later he is away. Shots RING OUT as Mick and Prince and the gunman shoot. Haven rides on, bent low, out of town. The sheriff hides his bulk in the dust as the bullets fly. \nANGLE from Charlie's office -- as she goes to the window, stares out at the flying form of Haven. A slow smile comes over her face, bitter and grim, yet somehow faintly admiring... She sees Mick mount a horse and start after Haven. Then she turns abruptly away. \nWIPE \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nAs Haven slows down his horse, but goes on at a fair clip after looking warily back. He breaks open the sheriff's gun, finds it loaded. He reacts and whistles softly. As he swings his horse off the travelled road to head crosscountry for the sawmill. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. NEAR SAWMILL - NIGHT \nAs Haven sits on his horse at a point in the woods where he can look down on the sawmill. Around the mill office there seems to be signs of unusual activity. Haven sees Mick Marion going by on the road towards the mill. Mick passes not far away and is riding hard. Haven watches as Mick arrives and Pete can be seen in conference with him. Other men -- too many -- are gathered around. At last Haven dismounts and makes his way carefully on foot towards the warehouse. \nEXT. WOODS IN BACK OF WAREHOUSE \nAs Haven leaves his horse in the brush and trees and then approaches the building. He finds a window in back, breaks it with a stone; then waits tensely to see if the sound has attracted any attention, gun in hand now. It doesn't. Haven replaces the gun in his holster, opens the window and crawls inside. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nHaven surveys the piles of crates, boxes and equipment. He starts his search methodically and swiftly. Suddenly a shaft of light comes from the front doors opened now by two men. Haven shrinks back, drawing his gun. The men start to enter when Pete's voice is heard. \nPETE'S VOICE Where you guys goin'? \nMAN You want them uniforms out, don't you? \nPETE'S VOICE I'll tell you when. \nThe men turn and leave. Haven relaxes. He goes back to work, pulls back a big canvas tarpaulin one of the men had approached, and there before him is revealed the army uniforms, stacked in neat piles. He looks and smiles grimly. Outside is the SOUND of horses and more men arriving. Haven goes slowly around the warehouse now, looking for something. At last he finds it: a can of kerosene. He takes it over to the uniforms, pours it liberally on them. At just this moment a figure appears at the door. \nMAN What you think you're doin'? \nHaven lights a match and tosses it on the soaked bales of uniforms. They blaze up instantly. The man shoots as Haven ducks away. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nAs the shot RINGS out. Pete and Mick, surrounded by many men, turn swiftly. Flame and smoke emerge from the warehouse. They start swiftly across, drawing guns. The man at the door shoots again into the smoking interior. An answering SHOT from Haven fells him. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nAs Haven makes his way back to the open window. He crawls out swiftly. Now the building is in flames. He can hear shouting and, as he moves away, the useless attempt of men to put out the blaze, working with buckets of water. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nAs Haven starts for the woods. The flames now light the ground around, and Pete appears around the side of the building. Pete fires and Haven draws and shoots. Pete whirls away, hit but still on his feet, driving forward, trying to shoot again and this time Haven drills him clean and Pete goes down to stay. Other men come up as Haven makes for the woods, disappears. \nMick Marion and a dozen men appear, shooting. Mick suddenly changes his mind, turns past the body of Pete, gets his horse and heads back to town full tilt. \nINT. WOODS - NIGHT \nAs Haven watches the flaming building. The slowly approaching figures of the men are illumined in the big light of the fire. Haven smiles, turns to the horse and moves slowly through the trees to a place where he can mount; then mounts and rides for it, SHOTS following him as he breaks into the clear some hundred yards away and heads for the road that Mick Marion took back to town. Bent low, Haven rides for his life -- and makes it... \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. ARMY POST - DAWN \nAs Haven rides up, a detachment of men supervised by Stellman is forming beside mounts in the parade ground. Haven dismounts and starts inside. He glances at his wagon parked outside. It is the one Mrs. Caslon took from him. He smiles slightly as he notes it. \nINT. ARMY POST - ILES' OFFICES - DAWN \nHaven walks in, brushes past the desk sergeant with a cursory nod and enters Iles' sanctum. \nAs Mrs. Caslon looks out the window. Her face, tense, as she watches the lonely figure go; her hand waves slightly. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nCharlie is standing by the desk and window. Prince is sitting there, talking, the inevitable dice in his fingers. \nPRINCE There's seventy men ready for any kind of play. I say we can still swing it -- and get out of town. \nTHERE is SOUND of massed horses outside and Charlie looks out. Prince walks to the window. They look in silence. \nCHARLIE Can we? \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nAs Iles rides by at full gallop, followed by a troop of cavalry, headed for the sawmill. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nAs they watch. Prince turns away. \nPRINCE You wanted to give Haven time. Well, he took it. \nCHARLIE You better get out before he takes you. \nPRINCE By that I presume you intend to remain. \nCHARLIE (wistfully) I've been here as long as I remember. \nPrince crosses to the window and stands looking at Charlie. \nPRINCE I asked you once if Haven moved me out. (he smiles) I think he's moved us both out -- together. \nCharlie looks at him but does not answer and then she turns to the window, and smiles slightly. Prince follows her gaze to the street. His face is grim. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nHaven, mounted, is coming up the street. Slowly and carefully he progresses to the front of the saloon. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nAs Charlie glances at Prince. \nPRINCE (softly) This is the way I wanted it... and when I've finished you will too... as though Haven had never been here. \nHe turns and goes quietly and swiftly from the room. Charlie stands thoughtfully. There is nothing in her look or manner to indicate that what Prince has said has made the slightest impression on her. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nAs Haven comes up to the saloon door. \nINT. SALOON DAWN \nAs Prince moves into a shadowy corner. \nANGLE ON the door as Haven enters and looks around. He sees no one. The place seems utterly deserted. It is soundless. CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven as he moves slowly. He has replaced the gun, but he is alert. \nANGLE ON Prince as he watches Haven, now a perfect target, not looking in his direction. Prince raises the gun a little, but the dice in his over hand click ever so faintly. \nSHOT OF Haven as he stops dead in his tracks, hand on the gun again, alert at the slight sound of the dice. Now facing towards the shadow where Prince is hidden. He stands ready and rigid for a long still moment. When there is no further sound or movement, he goes on towards the stairs. \nANGLE ON Prince as he moves slightly from the shadow as Haven goes to the stairs. Prince is ready to shoot again, but now the angle on Haven up the stairs is no good. He lowers the gun with disgust, then moves softly out of the shadow. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nShe gets a gun out of the drawer, looks at it, smiles, drops it back into the drawer, moves around the desk and faces the door, composing herself and waiting. \nEXT. CHARLIE'S DOOR \nAs Haven pauses, pushes it open. Then walks slowly in. \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN \nShe is standing with her back to the desk, her fingers tight on the edge of the desk as Haven walks in. He stops and looks around and then at her. There is a slight smile on her face. \nCHARLIE You cause me an awful lot of trouble. \nHAVEN Yeh... but I finally brought you something. \nHe hands her the little derringer she had given to Mark. \nHAVEN You didn't really think Mark would use it, did you? \nCHARLIE Maybe I just wanted to send you a gun. \nHAVEN (thoughtfully) Maybe. \n", "test1_input": "STATION WEST \nWritten by \nFrank Fenton & Winston Miller \nBased on a novel by \nLuke Short \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nJULY 22, 1947 \nEXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY \nFADE IN \nThe sky is pure blue, exquisitely blemished by huge cumulus clouds, floating lazily. A single bird sails past. From the sky the CAMERA MOVES TO earth. Here, too, all is tranquil. The trees, bright green in the sunlight, move only to the slight but constant breeze. Now the CAMERA MOVES DOWN, revealing a wagon to which is hitched a team of horses beside the road. The wagon is at an awkward angle, but upright. It is wedged between two rocks where the horses have pulled it as they tried to reach some forage. Its seat is empty. In the bed of the wagon several sacks lie, bearing the legend: \nFrom: Argus Mine - Rock Pass To: U.S. Assay Office San Francisco \nThe sacks are empty and slashed as by a knife. The ropes that bound them are cleanly severed. The disorder in the wagon indicates haste. Two horses are hitched to it, munching grass or the high leaves of a tree overhead. All that is odd or unnatural is that the reins have fallen askew and trail the ground. \nNow the CAMERA MOVES AWAY and ALONG tracks made by the wagon when it left the road. ON THE ROAD two horses stand. These are saddled, but riderless. The rifle holsters are empty. \nCAMERA MOVES TO the ground. There on the road lies the rifle. The dust is slightly blowing across it, moved by the persistent summery little breeze. From the rifle, the CAMERA MOVES ON A LITTLE and STOPS ABRUPTLY ON the sprawled dead figure of a soldier, then another, face down in the road. \nCLOSE SHOT of the dead soldiers, as the CAMERA HOLDS ON them. Near the hand of one a revolver lies, the fine dust coating it. Dust blowing over the uniforms, as though seeking to hide the shame of a murder. As it blows over their still figures, the SOUND of BIRDS coming over: \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nROCK PASS - NIGHT \nThis is a western mining town of the Eighties that has mushroomed up around a gold strike. On the streets prospectors and miners mingle with merchants. As the CAMERA PICKS UP the scene, a lumber wagon passes, bearing logs, a ten team wagon, its trailer filled with ore from the stamp mills and bearing the legend: ARGUS MINE. A stage coach comes in as we: \nDISSOLVE \nINT. HOTEL - NIGHT \nOn the hotel clerk, as he sits behind the desk, playing a guitar and singing pensively the ballad of the story. As he sings, JOHN HAVEN, newly arrived on the stagecoach, walks in, gazes at the clerk with a slight smile, finding the clerk completely indifferent to the arrival of anybody, at last leaves the bag and saunters out. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. SALOON - NIGHT \nAs Haven leaves the hotel and has reached the saloon, a well- lighted, plush-looking spot, illumined by kerosene flares. Sticking a pipe in his mouth, Haven saunters in. \nINT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - EVENING \nIt is a huge elaborate room, lit by overhead chandeliers. A long mahogany bar runs the length of it. To one side there is a big stove and the gambling tables. Beyond can be seen pool tables in an alcove. To another side, a man grinds away at a piano. A stairway near the end of the bar leads to an upper floor. The place is crowded and noisy with people. Haven saunters towards the dice table, pauses, watches; he is looking the crowd over carefully -- missing no detail of the place or the people in it. When his turn comes, he picks up the dice, bets all over the place -- on the line, on the odds, on the seven, then on the come, the hard way, etc. His point is eight. \nSTICKMAN Eight the hard way! Pay the line! \nHaven bets again, doubling all over the table. \nSTICKMAN Seven a winner. \nPlayers glance at the newcomer. Prince appears from nowhere, standing behind the stickman, watching. Prince is slender, black-haired, handsome and impassive. Haven throws again. Stellman, an Army officer, watches curiously. There is a little rising murmur as Haven tosses another natural. He does it without enthusiasm or any lost movement. The bettors get down on him. Prince touches the stickman's arm; the man stands aside and Prince takes his place with the stick. Prince tosses the dice back to Haven. Haven's eyes are fixed on him. With a little smile, Haven throws the dice to the next man, picks up his winnings. \nHAVEN No, thanks... \nHis eyes meet Prince's again and then he turns away, Prince's gaze following him curiously, Stellman looks at Prince. \nSTELLMAN Know him? \nPRINCE No. Why? \nSTELLMAN He just seems kind of free with that money. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS Haven, as still smiling slightly, he heads towards the bar, searching the faces of the crowd as he goes. Two miners are squared off for a fight and Haven, going his way, walks between them, very indifferent, not even glancing back at the SOUND of scuffle behind him. \nAT THE BAR - Haven alone is not watching the fight. All the others have turned to see it; even the barman is busy watching. But Haven's eyes are resting on the figure of a woman now at the piano, singing. Softly, as if to herself and for her own enjoyment. He is near the end of the bar and near the piano, and since no one else listens to her at this moment, she sings, half smiling, directly for him, and then, self-consciously, she stops and turns to sit at a table, as Haven watches her. Behind them the fight is being stopped and Charlie's eyes follow the huge bouncer, Mick Marion, as he drags the offenders out to the door and the street. All is as usual. The bartender is back at work. As Haven turns, he finds that the place beside him is now occupied by the young Lieutenant (Phil Stellman). Haven glances at the uniform, then at the pleasant face of the officer, as the barman comes up. \nHAVEN (to barman) Whiskey -- like you'd pour it for yourself. \nA girl sidles up to him, blonde, brash and pretty. \nBLONDE Don't you know it's no fun to drink alone? \nHAVEN Not till after the first one. \nHe turns his back to her; she gives him a look and saunters off. The barman produces the drinks -- a beer for Stellman, the young officer. The barman folds his arms. Stellman looks at Haven. \nSTELLMAN You a stranger here? \n", "test1_true": "BARMAN On the bottle it says Rye -- but the way you take it, I don't see what difference it makes. \nHaven smiles at him. \nHAVEN Another Rye. \nThe barman turns to get it. Stellman is still looking at Haven. \nSTELLMAN (easily) You didn't answer my question. \nHAVEN I'm a stranger everywhere. \nSTELLMAN Got a job? \nThe barman gives Haven another Rye. \nHAVEN Listen, soldier. I know that one, too. Got a job, stranger? No? Why don't you join the Army? Three meals a day, a place to sleep, a nice warm uniform -- \nSTELLMAN It has a little more than that. \nHAVEN (deliberately) Yeah, it has one thing more, and that's what I could never take -- (looking at Stellman's stripes) It's got Second-Lieutenants. \nThe barman, listening, senses trouble and signals with his eyes to a big bouncer down the bar. The bouncer moves up quietly. \nSTELLMAN If you want to make it a personal matter -- \nHAVEN (coldly) I don't make it anything, soldier. You tried to sell something and I didn't buy it -- so why don't you just beat it? \nThey stare at each other for a long second, then Stellman speaks icily: \nSTELLMAN If I weren't in uniform, I might teach you some manners. \nHAVEN If you could teach me anything, you wouldn't be in a uniform. \nStellman's jaw tightens; then he turns and exits abruptly. The barman sighs with relief; the bouncer turns away. \nBARMAN You couldn't be looking for trouble, could you? \nHAVEN I could, but I'm not. \nBARMAN That's fine, because this is one of the best places West of the Atlantic Ocean to find it. \nHAVEN That was my first impression. \nBARMAN (as Haven looks at him) That Lieutenant's a nice young boy. \nHAVEN I don't doubt it, but his mouth is too big -- like your ears. \nHe turns away from the bar, after flipping a coin on to it, while the barman stands there not knowing whether to be angry or philosophical. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS Haven, as he threads his way through the tables towards the door. His eyes catch sight of the girl who sang at the piano, Charlie. She is sitting at a table with Prince. Prince murmurs to her and she glances at Haven, then looks away again. Haven notes it. As he comes near the table, the blonde who spoke to him at the bar, accosts him again. \nBLONDE How is it now? \nHAVEN What? \nBLONDE Drinking alone? \nHAVEN (flipping her a coin) It's all right -- try it. \nHaven is looking at Charlie. She is checking a stack of coins the blonde has turned in to her. She glances up with a fleeting smile at Haven. \nCHARLIE It's not a good habit if it makes you pick fights. \nHAVEN Only with Second Lieutenants. \nCHARLIE We like Second Lieutenants here. \nTheir gazes meet and Prince notes it with narrowing eyes. The gaze holds like a spell, and then Charlie's smile comes back, from nowhere. \nCHARLIE You see -- here everybody fights, except the Army. \nHaven looks at her, fascinated. She can feel a fascination herself. Now Haven smiles a little. \nHAVEN I wouldn't know -- \nCHARLIE (still smiling) So anyone who doesn't like the Army -- \nHAVEN I know what you mean, but I'm afraid I'll have to come back. I like the way you sing. \nShe looks at him in a second's silence. Haven turns and leaves. She watches him go. Prince studies her face, his own grim. A croupier comes up and places a paper before her. She hardly notices it. \nCROUPIER Okay, Charlie? \nCharlie snaps out of it long enough to initial the paper. \nCHARLIE That's his limit. \n", "test1_id": 1488, "test2_input": "HAVEN Let's not talk about it. Right now it hurts my hands to listen. \nJERRY Yes, sir. \nHe walks out, looking back with an awesome smile. Haven looks curiously at Goddard, who has been standing in silence, a thin smile on his lips. \nHAVEN What happened to you? \nGODDARD My last run. I stopped a bullet. \nHAVEN Did you get a look at them? \nGODDARD I wish I had. \nHAVEN I think I'm going to need you and not on one leg. So sit down and give it a rest. \nGODDARD (slowly smiling) Yes, sir. \nHe obeys. Haven watches and then turns to the manager. \nHAVEN I'm coming back later and sit behind your desk. I'll need the keys. \nMANAGER (taking keys from his pocket) Only things here that work. \nThe manager, gives them to him. Then looks at him. \nMANAGER Son, I waste my time. I might as well waste some advice. You're full of blood and vinegar, but this whole thing has got something wrong with it. Goddard only got nicked in the shin. You might not be so lucky... \nHAVEN I might depend on something besides luck. \nMANAGER Like for instance? \nHAVEN Well the fact that they don't seem to shoot too straight. \nMANAGER They don't need to when they shoot so often. \nHe turns, takes a few steps -- and turns back to Haven. \nMANAGER Worry it over. \nThe manager turns to go, shaking his head. \nEXT. OFFICER COMPOUND \nHaven, whistling softly, crosses to the colored boy who is polishing the last specks of dust off the buggy. It is a beautiful buggy attached to a beautiful horse. Haven pauses and gazes at it. \nHAVEN What's this? \nThe colored boy steps back and admires his work. \nCOLORED BOY Sumpin', ain't it? \nHAVEN Who's it for? \nCOLORED BOY Miss Charlie, Mr. Haven. \nHAVEN Where do you drive her? \nCOLORED BOY Same places. Around the hills, down the river, every afternoon. \nHAVEN I think I'll give you this afternoon off. \nCOLORED BOY I shouldn't let you do this, suh... (looking Haven over, especially the bandaged hands) But ah am. \nHaven climbs in the buggy, and the Colored Boy watches him go. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAY \nCharlie is dressed to go somewhere. She looks much nicer in these clothes than in her show garments of the night. She is listening to Prince who sits in a chair, the inevitable dice in his fingers, two this time. There is a silence except the rattle of the cubes. Then Prince speaks coldly. \nPRINCE Does this Haven move me out? Is that the plan? \nCHARLIE Prince, you know I wouldn't part with you. \nPRINCE But I always come up empty. \nCHARLIE Not quite empty. I gave you what is probably the one honest feeling you ever had in your life. \nPRINCE I keep forgetting that. Pardon me. \nCHARLIE What's the matter, Prince? \nPRINCE I don't like John Haven or anything about him. \nCHARLIE You've said that. \n", "test2_true": "CHARLIE You want me to have him looked up in the Social Register? \nShe gets up, goes to the window testily. Prince looks at her coldly as she gazes at the street. \nPRINCE A man walks in out of nowhere -- \nCHARLIE (turning) And went against your table. Did he play like a gambler? \nPRINCE He knew something. \nCHARLIE Yes -- and he took Mick. \nPRINCE So he can fight. (shrewdly) You like that part, don't you? \nHe looks straight at her and she stares back, staring him down at last. As his eyes lower, she turns again to the window. \nCHARLIE I'll tell you one thing, Prince, I don't like this part. \nShe is silent and Prince gets up and walks out. She does not turn. Down in the street she can see Haven riding up in the buggy, and the hard look on her face softens to a smile as Haven climbs out of the buggy. Some people passing stare at him, and whisper together. His fame has spread. He walks inside, smiling a little. \nINT. SALOON - DAY \nAs Haven enters. There is no play at the tables. Some at the bar. The deaf pianist is pounding the keys softly. Prince has just descended the stairs and gone to the dice table, where he leans, his cold eyes fixed on Haven as the latter goes to the foot of the stairs. At this moment Charlie appears and descends the stairs, adjusting her hat. Haven stares at her with admiration, as she descends, smiling at him. \nMED. SHOT - Haven and Charlie, as she reaches the last step. \nHAVEN Stand there a second. \nShe looks at him. \nHAVEN Every time I see you, you look different, but you always look beautiful. Why is that? \nCHARLIE I always have somebody to lie to me. \nHAVEN Take my hand -- (offering it) But don't squeeze it. \nShe takes his arm instead and they walk towards the door. \nMOVING SHOT - Charlie and Haven, as they go. \nCHARLIE Tell me what you're doing with my buggy. \nHAVEN My work. I'm the new transportation boss. You hired me. \nMED. SHOT of Prince, as he stands at the table, watching them go. \nEXT. CHARLIE'S BUGGY - DAY \nAs Haven helps Charlie into the carriage. \nHAVEN I presume you're going shopping? \nCHARLIE I wouldn't wear anything sold this side of Chicago. I'm going to call on a gentleman. \nHAVEN At this hour? \nCHARLIE His name is Mark Bristow -- and any hour, it would be strictly business. \nHe glances at her. \nHAVEN The way you say it -- he may need a lawyer. \nCHARLIE He's a lawyer himself, but it won't help him. \nHAVEN No? \nCHARLIE (with a smile) What good is a lawyer if he never gets in a court? \nHAVEN Like a doctor in a graveyard. Where is this unlucky man? \nCHARLIE Across the street. \nAs Haven shrugs and turns the carriage to front of Bristow's office. \nEXT. BRISTOW'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe letters on the window read: \nMark Bristow, Lawyer \nAs Haven pulls up in front of it with the carriage. He goes around and helps Charlie alight, making it a little slow for the sake of added intimacy and causing her to smile as though she didn't resent it. \nHAVEN Shall I take the horses back and rub them down? \nCHARLIE Do you think they've gone far enough? \nHAVEN I haven't. \n", "test2_id": 1489, "test3_input": "CHARLIE Then maybe you better wait and come with me. \nAs Charlie starts in, Mrs. Caslon comes out and they pass. Mrs. Caslon pauses to smile and Haven tips his hat. Charlie, flashing a backward look, sees this. \nEXT. BRISTOW'S OFFICE - DAY \nMED. SHOT of Haven and Mrs. Caslon. Haven is talking to her with apparent casualness because he realizes that Charlie can see him. \nHAVEN I wonder if you'd do me a favor? \nMRS. CASLON Why, surely. \nHAVEN It's a big favor, and I wouldn't blame you if you refused. \nMRS. CASLON What is it? \nHAVEN I want to haul some gold from your mine. \nMRS. CASLON That IS a big favor. \nHAVEN I know it seems impossible to you, but that's one reason why I'm here -- to find cut what makes it impossible. \nMRS. CASLON Isn't that very risky? \nHAVEN That's why I couldn't go to anyone but you. \nMRS. CASLON (hesitating) I'm just wondering if we shouldn't speak to Captain Iles first. \nHAVEN You know what he'd say. (she smiles grimly and nods) He'd advise against it -- but if it works my way, it may clear everything up -- for all of us -- and for Iles too. The War Department doesn't like all that gold around an Army Post. \nHe watches her face as she thinks it over. \nHAVEN (softly) We're working too much in the dark. This may be the only way to see something. It's a risk -- but someone has to take it... \nMRS. CASLON (firmly) Who else will know of it? \nHAVEN Just us. That'll be all who know -- and that's the idea. \nMRS. CASLON (simply) I'll arrange it. \nHAVEN (grinning) Don't look so grim. It's only your gold and my skin. And smile when you walk away as though we'd been talking about what a dry summer it's been. \nShe smiles and Haven pats her shoulder. \nINT. OFFICE - DAY \nAs Bristow is talking. Charlie, looking through the window, sees Haven and Mrs. Caslon part, Haven patting her shoulder with that familiar gesture of his, then coming into the office door. \nBRISTOW ...You know I'll always cooperate -- as much as possible. But I haven't the money. \nHaven has entered in silence, seated himself in a chair. Charlie does not look at him; her face, hard now, looks straight at Bristow. He pauses as he glances at Haven with a little nod Haven doesn't return. \nCHARLIE (rising and going to the desk with a sheaf of papers, which she places on his desk) These are I.O.U.s for gambling. They add up to six thousand dollars. Do you want to count them? \nBRISTOW No. \nCHARLIE (returning them to her pocket) Your credit's over, Mark. \nBRISTOW My luck can turn, can't it? \nCHARLIE Not on my tables. \nBRISTOW I've seen other people fall in this trap -- but I didn't think it would get me. \nHe is sweating a little. \nCHARLIE Nobody does. I'll have Prince drop in and go over your books. Maybe we can work something out. \nBRISTOW But I told you -- \nCHARLIE That's the way it is, Mark. I pay off on the line and I expect to get paid. Give it some thought. \nShe whirls and walks out the door. Haven, fumbling for his pipe and putting it in his teeth, follows her with a parting glance at Bristow. For a long minute Bristow sits there alone, his eyes staring at nothing; then as he mops the mildew of sweat from his forehead: \nWIPE \nINT. CHARLIE'S CARRIAGE - DAY \nAs Charlie and Haven drive in the country. The road winds between hills now and a stream tumbles along beside the winding road. The horse is moving at a snail's pace and Charlie is gazing around at the scenery, relaxed and thoughtful. \nHAVEN You know, you remind me a little -- back there -- of a character I once read in a book. \nCHARLIE I had an idea you'd read a book. What was the character? \nHAVEN Simon Legree. \nCHARLIE Mark is mixed up. He's either crooked without being smart, or honest without being lucky. And that's no good. \n", "test3_true": "CHARLIE Even? \nHAVEN When I was seven I robbed my own piggy bank. \nCHARLIE It's hard to imagine you being seven. \nHAVEN I was very fat and ate a lot of candy. \nCHARLIE Is that why you robbed your bank? \nHAVEN No... I robbed it to run away from home. \nCHARLIE Did you do it? \nHAVEN Yeah, but I had to go back. \nCHARLIE Why? \nHAVEN It got dark. \nShe laughs. They stop and get out. \nDISSOLVE \nSTREAM BANK - DAY \nFULL SHOT as Haven helps her down the bank to the edge of the water. She sits on the edge of a huge flat boulder and Haven stretches out beside her. \nMED. SHOT of Haven and Charlie. As she looks at the stream and then at him. \nCHARLIE This is my favorite place in the world... I always come here to think about it. \nHAVEN What? \nCHARLIE The rook here and the stream. The stream is always running away and the rock is always watching it go. It's two ways to be -- and I always wonder which is the best. \nHAVEN They probably envy each other. \nCHARLIE Do you suppose any woman could envy me? \nHAVEN I know it. \nCHARLIE But not a good woman? \nHAVEN Nobody is any good. You mean respectable. \nCHARLIE Maybe. \nHAVEN Respectable people are very useful -- but they bore me. \nCHARLIE With certain exceptions. \nHAVEN (curiously) Like who? \nCHARLIE Like Mary Caslon... \nHAVEN I thought we might get to that. \nCHARLIE How did you happen to know her? \nHAVEN I knew her husband. \nCHARLIE That's curious, considering -- \nHAVEN Considering what? \nCHARLIE Ben Caslon was a very upright citizen. \nHAVEN Meaning I'm not? \nCHARLIE (adds thoughtfully) She's certainly not hard to look at -- and now she has the money and is -- (looking away) -- also very respectable. \nHAVEN Then why would she be interested in me? \nCHARLIE Because you're no good. And good women like men who are bad for them. \nHAVEN Flattery will get you nowhere. \nCHARLIE Fooling with her will get you nowhere too -- except in trouble. \nHAVEN With whom? \nCHARLIE The army. Why is it you're always getting mixed up with the army? \nHaven has been idly flipping pebbles into the stream. He sees a leaf float by. \nHAVEN (idly) What are the odds I hit the leaf? \n", "test3_id": 1490}

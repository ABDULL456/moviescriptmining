BATHROOM 
Amid a shower of plaster dust and lath. Hi has landed, groggily, against the toilet. 
Evelle enters now with his hands free, apparently having set the baby down somewhere. 
He yanks the cord off the bathroom blinds. 
LIVING ROOM 
Hi is seated in a straight-back chair, still violently struggling but Gale's arms are wrapped around him from behind. 
Evelle is just finishing tying off his wrists behind the chair. 
No one talks; there is nothing left to say. 
Finished, Gale goes to the door and Evelle goes to the bedroom. He emerges with the baby and precedes Gale out the door, Gale slamming it behind him. 
Hi starts bucking and struggling, weeping tears of rage and frustration. He succeeds only in tipping forward, face down into the carpet, the strapped-on chair pressing down on top of him. 
His profile is pressed into the carpet. 
Offscreen we hear the door of the trailer opening. 
HI'S POV 
At carpet level. Gale's shoes enter his field of vision. They stride over to a mess of debris in the corner of the living room. 
OBJECTIVE SHOT 
As Gale paws through the wreckage to expose the copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. He grabs the book. 
HI'S POV 
The feet walk away and leave his field of vision. 
CLOSE ON HI 
As we hear the door slam shut with horrible finality. 
Hi's mouth stretches wide. He ROARS with grief and frustration. 
WIDE SHOT 
Moving down the road toward an oncoming car. As the oncoming car gets closer we can see Gale and Evelle in its front seat. 
As the car passes we pan with it, to reveal that we have been shooting from the inside of another car, and we hold on the profile of its driver: Ed. She has just watched the other car shoot past. 
ED ...Good. 
QUICK FADE OUT 
INT. DEVASTATED TRAILER 
As Ed sits heavily into frame, apparently in shock, her frozen profile to the camera as she stares straight ahead into space. 
Her foreground hand absently holds a length of cord. 
Beyond her in the middle background Hi is rummaging in the debris. He stands up, cropped from the chest down and starts loading bullets into the chamber of Ed's .38 police special. 
HI (frantically) I know you're worried honey but believe me, there ain't a thing to worry about. We're gonna get him back, there just ain't no question about that... 
He snaps the chamber shut and leaves frame, still talking. 
HI ...We'll get him back, that's just all there is to it. And you wanna know another thing? 
He is walking back into frame holding another handgun now in addition to the .38, this one an automatic. 
HI ...I'm gonna be a better person from here on out. And that's final, I mean that's absolutely the way it's gonna be, that's official. You were right and I was wrong... 
He snaps a clip into the automatic. 
HI ...A blind man could tell you that. Now they ain't gonna hurt him, they're just in it for the score... 
Hi is leaving frame again, continuing to talk as we hear him rummaging offscreen. 
HI ...But I ain't like that no more, I'm a changed man. You were right and I was wrong. We got a family here and I'm gonna start acting responsibly... 
Hi enters frame with the two handguns stuck in his belt, holding his pump-action shotgun. 
HI ...So let's go honey... 
He primes the shotgun: WHOOSH-CLACK. 
HI ...Let's go get Nathan Jr. 
TRACKING SHOT 
From the front bumper of an automobile. Beautiful desert stretches to the horizon. The road rushes under the camera. 
GALE AND EVELLE'S CAR 
Gale drives, gazing out at the road. Evelle holds Nathan Jr., occasionally bouncing him. 
Contemplatively: 
GALE I luuuuv to drive. 
EVELLE You said somethin' there, partner. 
GALE ...Yessir, I figure with the ransom and this bank, you'n I'll be sittin' in the fabled catbird seat. 
Evelle is looking down at the baby, shifting him in his lap. 
EVELLE Uh, Gale... Junior had a, uh, accident.

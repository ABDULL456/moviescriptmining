Marylin and Sarah giggle, but reproachful looks from the other students force them to affect concerned looks. \nMARYLIN (Whispers) Every week -- \nSARAH I'm dying. \nThe two Instructors and the Mugger try to coax the sobbing woman back into the room. They clasp her in an empathic group hug. \nMARYLIN Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination. \nSARAH So where are you now? \nMARYLIN Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court. \nSARAH Shit. \nMARYLIN Get this! He called and invited me to dinner. \nThe INSTRUCTOR, a vivacious phys ed major, approaches Marylin. \nINSTRUCTOR Marylin? Ready. \nMARYLIN Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure. \nMarylin gets up and coolly walks to center stage, passing the traumatized Lilly. \nSARAH That's completely odd. \nMarylin begins the Victim walk. The Mugger quickly moves up from the rear. \nMARYLIN (To Sarah) I know. That's why I accepted. Find out what's up with this clown. \nThe Mugger is upon her. He grabs her hair. She stomps his foot, and smoothly wheels around SMASHING him in the nose with her elbow, while KNEEING HIM in the groin. \nThe women Cheer. \nINSTRUCTOR That was excellent, Marylin. But you forgot to yell \"no.\" \nMARYLIN Ah. (Calmly, to the Mugger) No. \nCUT TO: \nELEGANT RESTAURANT - EVENING \nMiles rises from his seat as Marylin enters. \nMILES Mrs. Rexroth. Thank you for coming. \nThe Maitre d' is pulling out a chair for her. \nMARYLIN I have to admit. I was curious. And hungry. \nMAITRE D' Something to start? Some wine, perhaps? \nMiles glances at the wine list. \nMILES French? (She smiles) Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57. \nMiles nods at the maitre d' who returns the nod and withdraws. \nMARYLIN I assume this is on Rex? \nMILES Isn't everything? \nMiles regards her. \nMILES Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared. \n", "test1_true": "Miles leans back, props his chin on one fist, and considers her. \nMILES Simon & Garfunkel? \nShe laughs. \nMILES Do you have a hard heart, Marylin. \nMARYLIN Did you see the tape? \nMILES Not yet. \nMARYLIN See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart. \nA waiter appears and pour a taste of wine which Miles sips and -- He nods at the waiter who pours two glasses. \nMARYLIN Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon? \nMILES What does your lawyer think? \nMARYLIN Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down. \nMILES But you don't agree? \nMARYLIN How do you know? \nMILES Why would you be here? \nMARYLIN I told you. I was hungry. \nFLAP a menu enters frame. It is handed to Marylin; another is handed to Miles. \nMILES I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same? (To Marylin) I assume you're a carnivore. \nMARYLIN I know you do. \nShe addresses the waiter. \nMARYLIN Risotto with white truffles, please. \nMiles looks at her with appreciation. \nMILES \"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?\" \nMARYLIN You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that. \nMILES Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend? \nMARYLIN Have you ever been married, Miles? \nMILES No. \nMARYLIN You don't believe in it. \nMILES As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan. \nMARYLIN You just haven't met the right person. \nMILES No. I haven't. Have you? \nShe regards him for a moment. \nMARYLIN All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that? \nMILES He wants a reconciliation. \nMARYLIN See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after. \nMILES Gotcha. \nMARYLIN What is it you're after, Miles? \nMILES Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount. \n", "test1_id": 1197, "test2_input": "She picks up an antique Chinese bowl. \nMARYLIN Is this Ming? \nSARAH It's not Ming. It's Tong. \nRAMONA Is Tong older than Ming? \nMARYLIN I think Ming is older than Tong. (To the Salesman hovering nearby) What is this? \nSALESMAN That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl. It's Chen dynasty. \nMARYLIN Ok. I'll take it. \nHe sets it aside next to the formidable pile of loot the girls have accumulated. \nMARYLIN I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch. \nSARAH What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour? \nMARYLIN Right. \nSALESMAN (To Marylin) And will this be check or --? \nShe hands him the Platinum Visa. \nSALESMAN (Glances at it) Very good, Mrs. Massey. \nHe trots off with the card. \nMarylin absently fingers an antique guided candelabra. \nMARYLIN (Sigh) Well. He said to \"make the house mine.\" \nRAMONA Oh boy. If he only knew. \nMARYLIN Yeah. I guess. You know -- \nSARAH What? \nMARYLIN He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy. \nSARAH But you're going through with it? \nMARYLIN Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me. \nSARAH So what? \nMARYLIN Miles is different. He's still so idealistic. \nSARAH Well, that's about to change big time. \nMARYLIN He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman. \nSARAH Soon, you'll have your own rage! \nMARYLIN I guess. \nINT. FLOWER STORE - EVENING \nMiles is buying a huge bouquet of flowers. As he exits he is stopped by a WOMAN. She is in her 40's but looks older. \nWOMAN Wait. I know you. \nMILES Yes? \nWOMAN You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair. \nMILES Excuse me? \nWOMAN You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those. \nShe grabs the flowers. Pulls petal off one of the roses and eats it. \nWOMAN But my brother got you. He got you, you slimeball. \n", "test2_true": "NURSE Emily! \nMILES What are you... (To the nurse) Is she yours? \nWOMAN Howard Doyle is my brother? You know my brother, Howard Doyle. You do know my brother, don't you? \nNURSE I'm sorry, Sir. Emily. Give the man back. \nMILES Yes, I know Howard Doyle. \nWOMAN He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you. (singsong) Neener neener neener. \nINT. RUTH RABINOW'S OFFICE \nRuth calmly watches Miles ranting around her office. \nMILES He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick -- \nRUTH Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her. \nMILES He never ate the pre-nup, did he! \nRUTH I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician. \nMILES Did Marylin end up with money? \nRUTH She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup. \nMILES I don't have a pre-nup \nMiles hangs his head. Ruth sighs sympathetically. \nRUTH ...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars... \nMILES Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap. \nRUTH And it's good! \nMILES I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred. \nRUTH Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal. \nMILES ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why? \nRUTH That's attorney client privilege. (As she goes back into her work) Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose -- \nINT. MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT \nMarylin greets him at the door. \nMARYLIN Hi. \nMILES Hello Marylin. \nMARYLIN I have a surprise for you. \nMILES I bet. \nShe brings him inside. The place has been massively accessorized. Antiques, rugs, lamps and assorted tasteful chatchkies. There is a new Biedermeyer couch in the den. \nMARYLIN Ta Da. \nMiles looks at it, expressionless. \nMARYLIN You don't like it? \nHe stares at her -- a very dark look. \nMARYLIN You don't like me? \nMILES (Flatly) I love you. I want to have your baby. \nMARYLIN What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much? \n", "test2_id": 1198, "test3_input": "She retrieves all the receipts from her purse. \nMARYLIN Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything. \nMILES Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just... (Bitterly) SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT? \nMARYLIN Miles? You're scaring me. \nMILES (Pulls himself together) I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU. \nINT. KITCHEN \nMarylin is on the phone with Ruth. \nMARYLIN But Ruth -- things have changed -- yes -- yes I understand. But you see -- I couldn't file, did I? And maybe I wasn't going to file. Maybe -- maybe Ruth -- Yes. Okay. \nOUTSIDE BEDROOM - MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe bedroom door is closed. Marylin knocks repeatedly. \nMARYLIN Miles? Open the door, Miles. Please open the door. I want to talk to you. Miles? I'm coming in. Here I come. \nShe pushes the door open. No Miles in sight. On the bed, scrawled on a piece of mMm stationery, taped to one of the mMm Frette pillows -- a note which reads -- \"If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? AND IF YOU WRONG US SHALL WE NOT REVENGE?\" \nINT. KENNETH'S HOUSE \nKenneth stares at the chessboard. Court TV is on the background. \nTV SCREEN \nCOURT TV REPORTER \nWe are back at the Trial of New Jersey v. Medrano. Mr. Medrano is accused of killing his wife, Alicia in 1992. He claims it was suicide. Let's return to the courtroom. \nSee the action in the courtroom -- \nThe Prosecutor shows the jury an extremely large handgun. \nPROSECUTOR How far would this gun have to be in order to inflict a wound without leaving powder burns on the scalp. \nEXPERT WITNESS Approximately three feet. \nPROSECUTOR And how could Mrs. Medrano shoot herself in the back of the head from a distance of three feet? \nKENNETH Really long arms? \nHe moves a piece. \nMILES They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised. \nKENNETH It's your move, Miles. \nMILES (Sadly) I already made my move, Kenneth. \nINT. MASSEY HOUSE \nA private yoga class. Marylin, Sarah and Ramona are in the plow position. The yuppie Sikh instructor places his weight on Sarah. \nSARAH Vishu! Knock it off. That hurts. \nVISHNU Breathe through it. \nSarah tries a few deep breaths. Marylin concentrates hard. \nVISHNU That's good, Marylin. \nMARYLIN I don't even know where he is. He looked so devastated. If I could just talk to him for a few minutes. \nSFX DOORBELL \nMARYLIN Was that the bell? \nRAMONA It sounded like a bell. \nMARYLIN I'll be right back. \n", "test3_true": "Marylin walks to the door.

POLICE STATION - MONTAGE - DAY \nMarylin is photographed front and profile. She is finger printed; she is searched and relieved of her jewelry; and finally, she is throw into a holding tank with several other women -- trapped. She clings despondently to the bars. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nRuth is admitted to the holding area. \nINT. HOLDING TANK - DAY \nA Police Officer walks down the hall. Unlocks the door. \nPOLICE OFFICER You can go now, Mrs. Massey. Someone made bail. \nMarylin exits. \nINT. RUTH'S CAR \nMarylin sits next to Ruth. \nMARYLIN Forgery and Fraud? \nRUTH You used his credit card. \nMARYLIN He told me to -- he said he wanted me to -- \nRUTH Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything. \nMARYLIN Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention? \nRUTH Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter? (Sighs) I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit. \nMARYLIN He never even asked. He just assumed -- \nRUTH He was right, wasn't he? \nMARYLIN So. Now what? \nRUTH Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her. \nINT. MASSEY HOUSE - DAY \nMiles opens the door. Marylin is standing there. \nMILES Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail! \nMARYLIN May I come in? \nMILES I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with \"the criminal mind.\" \nMARYLIN I'd just like to pick up a few of my things \nMILES I don't believe you have \"things.\" \nMARYLIN On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine. \nMarylin walks into the den. Sits on the new sofa. \nMARYLIN Comfy! \nMILES What do you want? \n", "test3_id": 1199}

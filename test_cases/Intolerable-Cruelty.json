{"train": "\"INTOLERABLE CRUELTY\" \nScreenplay by \nRobert Ramsey, Matthew Stone \nEthan Coen & Joel Coen \nBased on a story by \nRobert Ramsey, Matthew Stone \nand John Romano \nFIRST DRAFT \nBEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT \nIt is late night, and deserted. Engine noise approaches; headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing. \nIt is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing -- a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with it. \nWe hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative sedan, whose occupant does not sing. \nINSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE \nThe middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt and cocked bow tie. He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing over his forehead, and he merrily sings \"Casey Jones\" along with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus. \nANOTHER EMPTY STREET \nThe convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and approaches with its singing. \nREVERSE \nThe car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the conservative sedan enters and recedes. \nBEACH \nWe are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing, squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a halt. \nThe young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a half-empty bottle of champagne. \nThe man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag. \nMAN Number Seven. \nShe trots away. \nThe man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself. He straightens his bow tie. He puffs his bounding forelock with one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection. \nMAN Zing! \nMOTEL ROOM \nThe man enters and looks around. The young woman's dress is tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen. \nThe man pulls an imaginary train whistle. \nMAN Choo! Choo!... \nHe looks around, in a closet, under the bed. \nMAN I'm a locomotive, baby! I'm the Wabash cannonball! I'm a hunka-hunka burninnnnn' love! I got fire in my boiler and a fuh -- a fuh -- \nHe is reacting to a long leg which pokes out from behind the window curtain. \nA salacious smiles spreads across his lips. He pulls on the cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young woman in red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductor's cap. \nYOUNG WOMAN Tickets, please. \nThe man is stripping off his clothes. \nMAN Excuse me, Miss, is this the train to Ecsssstasy? \nYOUNG WOMAN Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're comin' to a tunnel! \nWe hear distant chimes. \nREX Honey! ...Honey?! \nFinally, through the intercom: \nMARYLIN Rex. Get away from the door. \nREX Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this? \nMARYLIN We are. And it's winding down. \nREX But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life. \nMARYLIN Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe? \nREX Marylin? \nMARYLIN Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you. \nREX Dogs? \nFrom inside the house we hear the menacing sound of LARGE DOGS BARKING. \nLETTERING \nOn an interior wall; it says MASSEY, MEYERSON, SLOAN & GURALNICK. \nA pull back shows that we are in a waiting room, and a receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Rex Rexroth. \nRECEPTIONIST Mr. Massey will be right with you. \nINT. MASSEY MEYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nMiles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm. \nMILES The problem is that everyone is willing to compromise. That's the problem with the institution of marriage -- it's based on compromise. Even through its dissolution. One attorney will try to score some points, the opposition will try to impeach. The process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers, and then each party will walk away with their portion of the \"goodies.\" Some say, \"Life is compromise.\" But at Massey Myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent. \nThe Receptionist pokes her head into the conference room. \nRECEPTIONIST Your eleven o'clock is here. \nMILES Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will continue this at the Associates Meeting next Friday. In the meantime, I want you to consider this... Ivan the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila the Hun -- what did they have in common? \nAs he exits. \nASSOCIATE Middle names? \nMILES MASSEY'S OFFICE \nYou may have seen it in the issue before last of \"World of Interiors.\" There's a Rothko on the wall, an Elle Bleu humidor on the desk, peonies in the vase, and the diploma is from Yale. \nMILES Mr. Rexroth. \nREX Rex, please. \nMILES Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign. \nREX Thank you. \nMILES Now Rex. \nHe leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk, makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest concern. \nMILES -- Tell me your troubles. \nRex, nervous, laughs ruefully. \nREX Jeez. Where do I start? \nMiles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return. \nREX ...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place. \nMILES That's her job. You have to respect that. \nSARAH Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us. \nRAMONA Three is not Farrow. \nSARAH Who's Rex's guy? \nMARYLIN Miles Massey. \nSARAH Of Massey Myerson? \nMARYLIN Do you know him? \nSARAH By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's. \nRAMONA George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second. \nSARAH Muriel Rumsey. \nMARYLIN Who's she? \nSARAH Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds. \nRAMONA You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position. \nMARYLIN No. \nRAMONA You like kids. \nMARYLIN I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce. \nSARAH It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys. \nRAMONA Maybe next time. \nMARYLIN Maybe. \nSARAH We do have a man for you. \nRAMONA Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish. \nSARAH She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children \nRAMONA And only two are hers. \nMARYLIN Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time. \nSARAH I wish I had your discipline. \nA COURTROOM \nWe are close on the person on the witness stand, a woman in her 60's. \nLAWYER Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married -- \nWITNESS Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea. \nLAWYER Prior to your marriage, what was your profession? \nWITNESS I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines. \nLAWYER What is your husband's profession? \nWITNESS He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful. \nJUMP BACK \nAt the counsel's table in the foreground Miles chats, voice lowered with WRIGLEY, a boyish, bespectacled junior associate. Beyond them we see the woman on the witness stand continuing her testimony. \nWRIGLEY Wait... He wants to give her...? \nMILES Nothing. \nWRIGLEY And she has...? \nMILES Video. \nREX My whole metabolism is -- off. \nMiles has been staring at Marylin. She notices this, and smiles shyly. He snaps out of it. \nMILES So, Ruth. How's Sam? \nRUTH Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana. \nMILES A yert. (To Rex) Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert. \nREX What's a yert? \nRUTH (Dryly) I ran into your mother at the radiologist last week. \nMILES What?! \nRUTH Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family. \nA tight, terse smile from Miles. \nMILES How nice. \nMARYLIN Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff? \nREX Yeah. \nThey drift for a moment. \nRUTH So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it. \nMILES At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation. \nRUTH My client has ruled that out. \nMILES My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice. \nRUTH That's delusional. \nMILES My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period. \nRUTH My client feels sufficiently dispassionate. \nMILES My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order. \nRUTH Ha Ha. \nMILES (conceding the point) Heh heh. \nREX What's so goddamn funny? \nMiles lays a hand on his arm. \nMILES Please -- let me handle this. \nHe puts the clipboard away and looks carefully at Ruth. \nMILES -- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth? \nRUTH My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets. \nMILES Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent? \nRUTH Oh brother. Here we go. \nMILES Why not a hundred and fifty percent? \nRUTH Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent. \nRex winces. Rubs his stomach. Marylin leans forward and whispers to him. \nMARYLIN Do you need a Tagamet? \nREX You have some? \nShe removes a pack of the tablets from her purse, along with several vials of prescription drugs. \nMARYLIN Well, don't look at mine! \nVOICE (O.S.) Oyez. Oyez. Family court for the fifth district of Los Angeles County is now in session. \nCOURT ROOM \nA large black woman in judicial robes and raiment enters from behind the Solomonic Platform. \nCLERK -- The Honorable Marva Munson presiding. All rise. \nMassey, Wrigley, and Rex Rexroth in between, rise. Rex and Wrigley remain respectfully standing, facing forward, as they whisper out of the side of their mouths: \nREX Have you sat before her before? \nWrigley considers. \nWRIGLEY -- the judge sits. We argue. We argue before her. She sits before us. \nREX Okay. Has she sat before you before? \nWRIGLEY You can't sit before her. That's the rule! She sits before we argue! \nMiles glances over and hisses: \nMILES Shut! Up! \nA GAVEL CRASHES \nLATER \nWe are on a close lateral track of the jurors faces as they sit, with earphones on, in the darkened courtroom, illuminated by a flickering TV monitor. \nLeaking tinnily through the headsets we hear a very faint: \nVOICE I'm gonna nail your ass. \nThe track ends over at Marylin's table, where Marylin also wearing headphones, looks on with studied stoicism. Ruth lays a consoling hand on her shoulder. \nLATER \nMarylin Rexroth now struggles to maintain her composure on the witness stand. She is modestly dressed and her attitude is one of shocked, wounded innocence. \nMARYLIN I was devastated. Of course. \nRUTH Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth. \nJUDGE Mr. Massey, any questions? \nMiles soberly rises. \nMILES Mmmm -- \nHe paces, hands clasped behind his back, affecting to be lost in thought. \nMarylin watches him. \nFinally Miles, still pacing, declaims: \nMILES \"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery...\" \nMarylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled irritation. Miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a faint smile. \nMILES Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth? \nMarylin examines him with guarded eyes. Ruth sensing something unscripted going on, tries to cut it off. \nRUTH Objection, your honor! \nJUDGE Grounds? \nRUTH Uh... poetry recitation. \nMILES Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, how high is that wall around your heart? \nMarylin eyes him suspiciously. \nMarylin sighs. \nMILES Her Mother? \nPatricia smiles coyly. Gives Marylin a silly little wave by way of greeting. \nPATRICIA Hi, Sweetie. \nMILES Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters. \nMARYLIN (Mumbles) He'll regret this. \nMILES Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth? \nPATRICIA No. I haven't. But I've been out of town. (Little girlish wave) Hello, Rex. Hello there. \nMILES You were never invited to meet your son-in-law? \nPATRICIA No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no. \nRUTH Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations. \nJUDGE Sustained. \nMILES Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married? \nPATRICIA Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so. \nShe laughs merrily at some private joke between her and her psyche. \nPATRICIA Let me tell you something about Patty. \nMILES Who's \"Patty.\" \nPATRICIA Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing \"Some Like It Hot.\" To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe. \nMILES I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin? \nPATRICIA When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said -- (Very Shirley Temple) \"When I grow up, I want to be divorced.\" \nShe laughs happily at the memory. \nMILES Divorce was her childhood aspiration? \nPATRICIA Well, not just divorce. She used to say \"I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy...\" And I guess her dream is coming true. (To Marylin) I'm happy for you Patty \nINT. SARAH SORKIN'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT \nPasta being cooked. Salad being tossed. Wine glasses are filled. It's Girl's Night at the beach. \nMARYLIN It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her. \nRAMONA Why do you think she did it? \nMARYLIN (Shrugs) Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows. \nRAMONA Maybe they put a horse head in her bed? \nSARAH That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King. \nMARYLIN They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any. \nRAMONA That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented. \nSARAH Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans? \nMARYLIN Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon. \nSARAH So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl? \nMARYLIN Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist? \nRAMONA I begged you to have a baby! \nMARYLIN In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub. \nA squawk box interrupts with a female voice. \nVOICE Mr. Massey, Mr. Meyerson would like to see you when you have a moment. \nMiles is surprised. \nMILES Herb wants to see me? \nVOICE When you have a moment. \nINT. OFFICE \nSlatted shades are drawn against the sun. It is dim, gloomy. We can just make out the shape of an ancient man -- small, hunched -- seated behind an enormous desk. A gallows shape next to him is hard to make out; it is tall, rail thin and fixed with a swinging, glinting appendage. \nA voice -- old, dry, rasping, lightly accented of a long- gone Brooklyn boyhood -- seems disembodied and sourceless, as if it is the voice of the gloom itself. \nVOICE Thoity-six objections sustained, tree overruled; fawteen summary judgements sought, toiteen ranite, eighteen movments to voice fuh respondent's prejudice, eighteen ranite which is a hunnut pissent \nAn arm is being extended toward us and the glinting appendage swings with it: we see that it is an IV which snakes down and into the hunched man's suit sleeve. \nVOICE -- Twelve cawt days on the Rexrawt case alone; tree hunut'n twenty billable hours paralegal soivicies; four hunnut'n two billable associate counsel and consultative; six hunnut'n eighty billable at full attorney rate and eightyfive lunches charged. \nMiles takes the man's offered hand, withered and roped with veins, and accepts its clammy shake. \nVOICE -- Counseluh, you are the engine that drives this foim -- \nHe leans back in his chair, breathing heavily, and runs a tongue over his sandpapery lips. He is wearing oversize Swifty- Lazar style glasses, heavily tinted in spite of the dark. \nAt length \nMILES Thank you Herb. \nINT. MILES OFFICE \nMiles sits behind his desk, fingers steepled, staring at nothing, a haunted look on his face. \nHis intercom SQUAWKS: \nVOICE Mr. Massey -- \nMILES Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile. \nVOICE I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you. \nMILES Marylin Rexroth? When does she -- \nVOICE She's here now. \nINT. PRIVATE BATHROOM \nMiles runs his fingers through his hair, carefully examining himself in the mirror. Suavely smiling. \nMILES Marylin! How nice. \nHe clears his throat, begins again with lower pitch, suave smile still in place \nMILES Marylin! How lovely, uh -- \nHe runs a finger across his teeth, which squeak, then puts back the suave smile \nMILES -- Marylin! What a pleasure -- \nDOORWAY \nOn Miles as he opens the door, suavely smiling. \nMILES Marylin, what a pleas -- who the fuck are you? \nFacing him in the doorway is a large roughly handsome middle aged man in a business suit. \nJust behind him is Marylin Rexroth, looking as coolly beautiful as ever. She smoothly puts in: \nMARYLIN Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil. \nDOYLE I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser? \nDOYLE She said \"penetrate.\" Heh heh heh. \nHe gropes her. She giggles like a teenager. \nMILES Oh, for the love of... \nMARYLIN That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is? \nMILES That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law. \nDOYLE Harvard? Whoa, Daddy! \nMILES I just want to make sure that you both -- \nHe eyes Marylin. \nMILES -- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party. \nDOYLE Well -- at the moment, that'd be me. \nMILES And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room. \nDOYLE A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room! \nMILES (slightly sickened) -- and we are sure... \nEyes boring into Marylin. \nMILES -- we are both sure that's what we want? \nMARYLIN Absolutely. \nDOYLE Course I can't do much \"wriggling\" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl. \nMARYLIN (laughing) We'd better go before we get thrown out. \nELEVATOR BANK \nMarylin and Howard wait for an elevator as Miles trots out to catch them. \nMILES Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment. \nDOYLE What part? \nMILES I'd just like to have a word with her. \nDOYLE Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime. \nMiles drags her to the side as Doyle checks his Sports Pager. \nMILES What are you doing? \nShe backs up as he tries to close the space between them. \nMARYLIN Getting married. \nMILES To him? He's a sick freak. \nMARYLIN He's passionate. \nMILES Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves. \nMARYLIN All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time. \nMILES Marylin! Listen to me. \nMARYLIN No. You listen to me. (Very quiet and deliberate) You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that. \nMILES But why him? \nMARYLIN We told you. We realized we've always been in love. \nHe has backed her against the wall of an alcove which shelters a flowering ficus. \nMILES The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged. \nDOYLE I do. \nRABBI BOLENSKY And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel? The stock in your sauce? \nMARYLIN I do. \nMILES Argh. \nHeads turn. Miles bites a knuckle. Birds twitter. \nRABBI BOLENSKY Then, by the power vested in me by the state of California, and as the maitre'd in the Prix Fixe Four Star Restaurant of Life, I now pronounce you -- man and wife... \nA kiss. Cheers. Applause. \nA RECEPTION ON THE GROUNDS \nRabbi Bolensky strolls through the crowd with a heaping platter of smoked salmon. \nMiles is darkly brooding as Wrigley opens a Tiffany box to show him the contents. \nWRIGLEY What do you think? \nMILES What are they? \nWRIGLEY Berry spoons. \nMILES Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever -- \nWRIGLEY Miles -- why so angry? \nMiles sounds wistful: \nMILES Why couldn't we be the club sandwich? \nDing Ding -- Howard D. is tapping a knife against his wine glass. The crowd quiets. \nDOYLE Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: I have something to say to my bride. \nHoward D. turns to one side to address Marylin, taking one of her hands between his paws, as she beams up at him. \nDOYLE -- Darling, like the rabbi said... life is a banquet, A Grand Bouffe, and Marylin, darling... I just want you to know that I am IN the kitchen and I CAN STAND THE HEAT! \nLaughter from the gallery. \nDOYLE And I'm going to start this marriage by EATING MY WORDS. Because the hot hors d'oerve of this love story is -- Pre-nup Primavera! \nHe reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a piece of paper. \nDOYLE Carmine! Bring on the Pesto! \nA Caterer places a plate and a bowl of sauce in front of Doyle. Marylin looks on, surprised and bemused. \nDOYLE -- This is for you, darling. \nHe starts tearing strips off the piece of paper, dipping them into the sauce, and eating them. His mouth stuffed with paper, Doyle repeats: \nDOYLE -- this is for you, Darling. \nThe crowd is murmuring--the murmurs grow in volume -- a smattering of applause -- cheers -- more applause -- wild cheers. Slowly rhythmically, Miles starts thumping his hand together, nodding comprehension. \nMILES Brilliant. \nNext to him Wrigley is puzzled. \nWRIGLEY Why is he doing that? \nMiles' hand-clapping accelerates. \nMILES Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating the pre-nup. \nWrigley's eyes widen. He looks back at Doyle eating the paper. \nDOYLE This is for you, Darling! \nWrigley bursts into tears. \nWHOOOSH -- the plane roars away. \nINT. MILES OFFICE \nMILES And of course we shall have to litigate. Sentence. Paragraph. \nWIDER \nA secretary seated by his desk is taking notes. \nMILES -- Naturally the first concern for both parties is the welfare of little Wendell junior. Nevertheless, we question whether the continuing expenses for his special ed classes are truly justified given the great strides -- \nWrigley enters. \nWRIGLEY I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced! \nMILES (Delighted) HA! \nWRIGLEY ...and I hear she's richer than Croesus. \nMILES Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus? \nWRIGLEY She could buy and sell you ten times over. \nMILES She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power. \nHe hits the call button. \nMILES Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle. \nWRIGLEY What...? \nMILES She owes me a meal. \nWRIGLEY I'd stay away from her, Miles. \nMILES I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer? \nWe hear the Receptionist Voice: \nRECEPTIONIST Mrs. Doyle for you. \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT \nWe move in on one of the tables where Marylin and Miles sit as a waiter pours them champagne. \nWAITER Le Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, 1982. \nMILES Thank you. I'll take care of it. \nAs he fill Marylin's glass: Raises his own in a toast. \nMILES To victory. \nMARYLIN I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman... \nMILES More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery. \nMARYLIN Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs. \nMILES No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you -- \nMARYLIN (Reproachfully) You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You -- (With difficulty) sound like my mother. \nThe Waiter hands Miles a menu. \nWAITER Should we order? \nMARYLIN Yes, I -- well, I'm not really... \nMILES Not hungry, huh? Neither am I. \nA long pensive moment. \nMiles reaches across the table and takes her hand. She lets him. He strokes it. \nMILES You do? \nMARYLIN Do you want me to sleep on it? \nMILES No. \nMARYLIN Do you want to sleep on it? \nMILES No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me? \nMARYLIN Yes. Again. \nThey kiss. \nMILES I don't have a ring! \nMARYLIN I know. \nMILES I have a watch. \nShe laughs. Kisses him. \nMARYLIN I'm happy. \nINT. CHAPEL \nMiles and Kenneth wait. Dressed in suits. Miles looks nervous. \nKENNETH I'm happy for you, pal. \nMILES Thanks, buddy. \nKENNETH Is she Asian? \nMILES Asian? No. \nKENNETH Well... I'm still... \nWrigley, rushes in, carrying a briefcase. \nMILES Wrigley? \nWRIGLEY Miles. \nMILES Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck. \nWRIGLEY The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style. \nMILES Do you have it? \nKENNETH I have it. \nMILES You have the pre-nup? \nKENNETH No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup? \nMILES No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup. \nKENNETH Oh. I thought maybe -- (He sees someone) Gee! \nMarylin enters. She looks outstanding. Her friends, Sarah Sorkin and Ramona Barcelona (who is now visibly pregnant) accompany her. \nSARAH Dr. Beck! \nKENNETH Sarah! How are you? \nMILES You know each other? Of course you do. \nRAMONA You're Dr. Beck? I have an appointment to see you in March. Right after I lose the babyweight. Which of course, will be after I have the baby... \nMARYLIN Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey. \nSARAH Hello Miles. \nRAMONA Congratulations Miles. \nRAMONA You're vulnerable. \nMARYLIN It's about time. \nJUDGE You're a sitting duck. \nMARYLIN (To Miles, with great affection) Quack. \nINT. CHAPEL \nMiles and Marylin stand before the alter. \nJUDGE MUNSON Do you, Miles Herbert Massey of Massey Meyerson take Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth- Doyle? \nMARYLIN Yes. \nJUDGE MUNSON \"Doyle\", to be your lawful wedded wife to -- \nMILES I do, yah I do, uh huh -- \nJUDGE MUNSON Let me finish! \nShe glares at Miles. \nJUDGE MUNSON -- Jesus! Haven't you ever been married before? \nChastened, Miles bows his head. \nJUDGE MUNSON -- To have and hold, to love and to cherish, till death do you part? \nThere is a long beat, through which Miles stares at his shoes. \nMarylin looks at him. \nMILES -- I do. \nJUDGE MUNSON And do you, Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth Doyle, take Miles Herbert Massey of Massey Meyerson, to be your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do you part? \nMARYLIN I do. \nJUDGE MUNSON I now pronounce you man and wife. \nWrigley bursts into tears. \nTHE MARRIED MASSEY MONTAGE \nCUT TO: \nINT. MASSEY HOUSE - MORNING \nMiles and Marylin asleep in bed. The ALARM RINGS. Miles wakes, turns to his beautiful wife -- kisses her good morning. \nShe gives him a sleepy Smile. \nMiles dressing for work. Marylin, in a Sabia Rosa bathrobe places a tray with coffee next to him. He holds up two ties for her-approval. She selects one. He puts it on. \nMiles and Marylin reading Newspapers while eating breakfast. She serves him a bowl of fruit and indicates Wrigley's berry spoons. They laugh heartily. \nMarylin waves good bye as Miles backs drives to the office. She waves at the gardeners who blow palm fronds around the lawn. \nMILES OFFICE \nHe has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married life. Due to its brevity -- these pictures are uneventful, the Massey's wear the same outfit in most of them. \nMiles works. He is interrupted by the voice of his SECRETARY. \nSECRETARY I have Mrs. Massey on line one for you. \nMiles picks up. \nMILES Mom...? \nHe laughs and laughs. We hear Marylin's laughter coming through the receiver. \nMiles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips. Marylin at the doorway, greets Miles as he arrives home. \nShe picks up an antique Chinese bowl. \nMARYLIN Is this Ming? \nSARAH It's not Ming. It's Tong. \nRAMONA Is Tong older than Ming? \nMARYLIN I think Ming is older than Tong. (To the Salesman hovering nearby) What is this? \nSALESMAN That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl. It's Chen dynasty. \nMARYLIN Ok. I'll take it. \nHe sets it aside next to the formidable pile of loot the girls have accumulated. \nMARYLIN I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch. \nSARAH What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour? \nMARYLIN Right. \nSALESMAN (To Marylin) And will this be check or --? \nShe hands him the Platinum Visa. \nSALESMAN (Glances at it) Very good, Mrs. Massey. \nHe trots off with the card. \nMarylin absently fingers an antique guided candelabra. \nMARYLIN (Sigh) Well. He said to \"make the house mine.\" \nRAMONA Oh boy. If he only knew. \nMARYLIN Yeah. I guess. You know -- \nSARAH What? \nMARYLIN He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy. \nSARAH But you're going through with it? \nMARYLIN Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me. \nSARAH So what? \nMARYLIN Miles is different. He's still so idealistic. \nSARAH Well, that's about to change big time. \nMARYLIN He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman. \nSARAH Soon, you'll have your own rage! \nMARYLIN I guess. \nINT. FLOWER STORE - EVENING \nMiles is buying a huge bouquet of flowers. As he exits he is stopped by a WOMAN. She is in her 40's but looks older. \nWOMAN Wait. I know you. \nMILES Yes? \nWOMAN You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair. \nMILES Excuse me? \nWOMAN You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those. \nShe grabs the flowers. Pulls petal off one of the roses and eats it. \nWOMAN But my brother got you. He got you, you slimeball. \nMARYLIN I want to nail you ass. \nMILES Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail. \nMARYLIN I'm reporting you to the IRS. \nMILES The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund. \nHe laughs. She looks at him, dead serious. \nMILES I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend. \nMARYLIN I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about -- \nShe opens a humidor and takes out a Cigar. \nMARYLIN STUFF. (Chomping on the Cigar) Got a light? \nMILES What kind of \"stuff?\" \nShe reaches into her purse. Pulls out a Dunhill and expertly lights the cigar. \nMARYLIN Arty Farty stuff. (Pointing to the Hockney) Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients. \nMILES Those are gifts. \nMARYLIN Salary. Unreported income. (Glancing at his watch) By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road? \nMILES You can't prove anything. \nMARYLIN I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH. (Puffing on the cigar) What is this? A Romeo and Julieta? \nMILES You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional. \nMARYLIN I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague. (She stands to leave) I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house. \nMILES Meaning my house. \nMARYLIN I believe the residence will be part of the settlement. \nMILES Did our marriage ever mean anything to you? \nMARYLIN Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients. \nMILES That's blackmail. \nMARYLIN That's marriage. \nShe gives him a peck on the cheek. As she leaves: \nMARYLIN You'll always be my favorite husband. \nMiles sits dejectedly on the new sofa looking at the paintings. He looks at the watch. And the cigars. And the picture of his mother. \nMILES Pity you can't be here. You'd enjoy this. \nCLOSE ON A BAG OF FLUIDS \nWe pull back from the milky yellowish bag of fluid to show that a nurse is unhooking and removing it from under Herb Meyerson's wheelchair where it collects drainage. \nShe now places it up on the IV gantry and connects, and swaps the now empty drip under the wheelchair to collect drainage. We are once again in Herb Meyerson's gloomy office, its venetians blocking most of the light and making Herb a dark, enigmatic figure. \nHERB This woman has humbled, shamed and disgrazed the entire foim. \nA reverse shows Miles standing in front of Herb's desk. \nMILES Yes Herb, \nHERB Counseluh, this foim deals in powuh. This foim deals in p'seption. This foim cannot prospuh... nor long endowwa. if it is p'seeved as dancin' to the music.. \nHe waves his free arm to the beat of music unheard. \nHERB -- of the hoidy-goidy. \nMILES I understand Herb... I just... for the first time in my career -- I don't know what to do. I'm a patsy. A sitting duck. I'm lost. \nGANGSTER You're in a rush. \nMILES Mr. Dumbarton is, yes. \nA long beat. Finally, Miles explodes \nMILES She won't suffer, will she? \nHe bites a knuckle, gazing fearfully at the gangster. The gangster stares impassively back. \nGANGSTER ...not unless you pay extra. \nINT. REX REXROTH MANSION \nAn enormous oak paneled room. Furnished with chairs sofas and a huge circular bed. A fire roars in the far corner. On the wall above the bed a film loop is being projected -- soft core pornographic images. \nOn the bed, Rex is surrounded by three naked beauties, smeared in cola dust and wearing conductor caps. \nREX I've been working on the railroad -- \nTARTS All the livelong day! \nREX I've been working on the railroad \nTARTS Just to pass the time away! \nREX Can'tcha hear the whistle... the whistle... AWWWWWWW. \nRex hunches over, clutching his left arm. \nOne by one, the girls stop dancing and stare. There is a somber silence, broken by another. \nREX Awwwwwww -- \nThe girls are all watching now. One of them steps forward. \nTART -- Whatsa matter, Rexie? \nINT. KENNETH'S HOUSE \nA guest room. Dark, dirty and filled with empty bottles of expensive French wine. \nWe hear a phone ringing in a different room. It rings several times. \nThe figure on the bed stirs, rolls over, moans, clamps a pillow over his head. \nThe ring of the distant telephone is interrupted and we hear a muffled voice: \nVOICE Hello. Yes, he's here. Just a minute -- \nWe hear approaching footsteps and Kenneth enters the background, knotting a bathrobe. He turns on the light in the room. \nKENNETH Miles. It's for you. \nThe figure on the couch pulls away the pillow. It is indeed Miles Massey. He blearily takes the offered phone. \nMILES Hello. Yes -- what?! Yes -- I see -- \nAfter another listening beat he drops the phone away. He remains staring dully out into space. \nMILES My God. \nKENNETH What? \nMILES That was Marvin Untermeyer. \nKENNETH Yes? \nMILES He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney. \nKENNETH What do you mean, was. \nMILES Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead. \nKenneth is mildly puzzled. \nMarylin hangs up the phone. \nShe walks slowly around the room, pausing at the mantelpiece to pick up a framed picture of Miles, which she contemplatively regards. \nWe pan with her continued walk to bring Joe into frame. He stands with his back pressed to the wall. She's started for a moment, but quickly recoups: \nMARYLIN Whoever sent you, I'll pay double. \nJOE Mr. Dumbarton. \nShe shows him the picture of Miles. \nMARYLIN Is this Mr. Dumbarton? \nJOE No... \nShe cocks an eye at him. \nJOE That's his lawyer. \nMARYLIN Triple! \nJOE Who's the pigeon? \nWe faintly hear a car screeching to a halt. \nEXT. MASSEY MANSION \nMassey exits the car. He clutches a can of mace. \nINT. MANSION \nWe hear a key scrape in the lock. The front door swings open onto a dark foyer as Miles tiptoes in. \nMILES (Whispers) Marylin? \nDINING ROOM \nMiles tiptoes through, looking warily about. He backs through the swinging doors connecting to the kitchen. Finds himself face to face with Joe. \nMILES Joe! Thank God you're in time. You're not in time. I'm in time. Thank God I'm in time. \nJoe stares at him. \nMILES It's a no go! Get it? No one any the wiser. Okay! \nHe makes a cow-herding motion with his hands. \nMILES You can go home now! Goodbye! Thanks so much! \nJoe takes out his gun. \nMILES No no! No contract! It's all over. \nThis has no effect on Joe who is unscrewing his silencer. \nMiles is exasperated. Suddenly -- Marylin appears. \nMARYLIN It's a no go, Joe. \nMILES Marylin! \nMARYLIN It's okay Joe. \nJoe glances at both of them with barely concealed contempt. \nMILES Wait! He works for YOU? \nMARYLIN Now. But first, he worked for you. \nMILES You were going to have this thug...? \nMARYLIN Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence. \nJOE You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot! \nWRIGLEY Ruth. \nMiles and Marylin are looking at each other. Quietly: \nMILES Hello Marylin. \nMARYLIN Hello Miles. \nMILES Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us. \nMARYLIN It's not something I wanted either. \nMILES But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me. \nMARYLIN Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill... \nRUTH Now you both wait a minute. Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone. \nWRIGLEY Hear, hear. \nThere is an uncomfortable shifting in seats. Wrigley looks at Miles. \nWRIGLEY Apparently, from what I can gather, a burglar broke into your house -- became despondent over his lifestyle and shot himself. \nMiles is still looking at Marylin. \nMILES Where does that leave us? \nRUTH We've outlined a settlement... \nShe pushes a piece of paper across the table. \nRUTH We think it's more than generous. \nMiles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle of the table. He looks at Marylin. \nWRIGLEY My client is prepared to consider a reconciliation. \nMarylin looks a Miles. \nMARYLIN How could I trust you, after... after all of this. \nMiles, staring at Marylin, cuts in: \nMILES You wounded me first, Marylin. \nMARYLIN Your forgetting Rex Rexroth? \nMILES You're forgetting Howard Doyle? \nMARYLIN Forgery? Fraud? \nMILES Income tax evasion? \nMARYLIN Murder? \nMILES Murder! \nMARYLIN I don't see how we can ever find our way back from... \nMiles, with his eyes still on Marylin, reaches into his suit coat. He withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the table in front of him and, still gazing at her: \nMILES You know... there's nothing in the Massey pre-nup that says it can't be executed after the parties wed. \nHe decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name. \nHe pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin. \nGazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently picks up the paper. \nThere is a long silence. We hear only the hum of ventilation, and Wrigley's quiet snuffling. \nRuth is looking down her nose through her glasses -- over Marylin's shoulder -- at the sheet of paper. Marylin however, looks only at Miles. \nRUTH It's the Massey pre-nup -- \n", "test1_input": "SARAH He has a reputation for being tough. \nMarylin watches as a new \"victim\" begin her walk across the gym. \nMARYLIN (Grinning) Lilly's up. \nSARAH Oh, God! \nThe mugger emerges from his station and makes his way toward the \"victim.\" She glances over her shoulder, and at the sight of the monster bearing down on her, screams and runs to the exit. Marylin and Sarah giggle, but reproachful looks from the other students force them to affect concerned looks. \nMARYLIN (Whispers) Every week -- \nSARAH I'm dying. \nThe two Instructors and the Mugger try to coax the sobbing woman back into the room. They clasp her in an empathic group hug. \nMARYLIN Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination. \nSARAH So where are you now? \nMARYLIN Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court. \nSARAH Shit. \nMARYLIN Get this! He called and invited me to dinner. \nThe INSTRUCTOR, a vivacious phys ed major, approaches Marylin. \nINSTRUCTOR Marylin? Ready. \nMARYLIN Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure. \nMarylin gets up and coolly walks to center stage, passing the traumatized Lilly. \nSARAH That's completely odd. \nMarylin begins the Victim walk. The Mugger quickly moves up from the rear. \nMARYLIN (To Sarah) I know. That's why I accepted. Find out what's up with this clown. \nThe Mugger is upon her. He grabs her hair. She stomps his foot, and smoothly wheels around SMASHING him in the nose with her elbow, while KNEEING HIM in the groin. \nThe women Cheer. \nINSTRUCTOR That was excellent, Marylin. But you forgot to yell \"no.\" \nMARYLIN Ah. (Calmly, to the Mugger) No. \nCUT TO: \nELEGANT RESTAURANT - EVENING \nMiles rises from his seat as Marylin enters. \nMILES Mrs. Rexroth. Thank you for coming. \nThe Maitre d' is pulling out a chair for her. \nMARYLIN I have to admit. I was curious. And hungry. \nMAITRE D' Something to start? Some wine, perhaps? \nMiles glances at the wine list. \nMILES French? (She smiles) Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57. \nMiles nods at the maitre d' who returns the nod and withdraws. \nMARYLIN I assume this is on Rex? \nMILES Isn't everything? \nMiles regards her. \nMILES Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared. \n", "test1_true": "Miles leans back, props his chin on one fist, and considers her. \nMILES Simon & Garfunkel? \nShe laughs. \nMILES Do you have a hard heart, Marylin. \nMARYLIN Did you see the tape? \nMILES Not yet. \nMARYLIN See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart. \nA waiter appears and pour a taste of wine which Miles sips and -- He nods at the waiter who pours two glasses. \nMARYLIN Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon? \nMILES What does your lawyer think? \nMARYLIN Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down. \nMILES But you don't agree? \nMARYLIN How do you know? \nMILES Why would you be here? \nMARYLIN I told you. I was hungry. \nFLAP a menu enters frame. It is handed to Marylin; another is handed to Miles. \nMILES I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same? (To Marylin) I assume you're a carnivore. \nMARYLIN I know you do. \nShe addresses the waiter. \nMARYLIN Risotto with white truffles, please. \nMiles looks at her with appreciation. \nMILES \"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?\" \nMARYLIN You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that. \nMILES Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend? \nMARYLIN Have you ever been married, Miles? \nMILES No. \nMARYLIN You don't believe in it. \nMILES As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan. \nMARYLIN You just haven't met the right person. \nMILES No. I haven't. Have you? \nShe regards him for a moment. \nMARYLIN All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that? \nMILES He wants a reconciliation. \nMARYLIN See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after. \nMILES Gotcha. \nMARYLIN What is it you're after, Miles? \nMILES Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount. \n", "test1_id": 1197, "test2_input": "MILES Marylin? When did I say...? \nMARYLIN I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck! \nWe hear the SCREECH of Tires. \nMARYLIN (yelling at someone) Screw you, asswipe! \nMILES Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk? \nMARYLIN A little. (Scream) You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you! \nMILES You shouldn't be driving. Where are you? \nMARYLIN I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...? \nMILES I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here. \nMARYLIN Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for -- \nMILES No. Don't stop. \nMARYLIN Okay Miles. \nINT. DEN - MASSEY MANSION \nMarylin sits in the den. She's had some coffee and, although teary and disheveled, is no longer psychotic. \nMARYLIN I just cried when I got home. Somehow, your disdain for me -- I'm pretty tough Miles, but I'm human. All my life people have been ascribing these terrible motives to me. I used to think they were jealous, or they didn't understand, but... I dunno. Maybe others see something in me. Something I'm not even aware of. Anyway, thank you for letting me come here. I guess I was a little drunk. \nShe takes the coffee cup and has a sip. She looks like a lost waif. \nMARYLIN You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting. \nMILES Thank you. \nMARYLIN You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney? \nMILES Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift. \nMARYLIN From a -- girlfriend. \nMILES No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client. \nMARYLIN No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you? \nMILES Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans. \nMarylin looks at a photograph Miles has on a side table. \nA WOMAN AND TWO SMALL BOYS. \nThe Woman has her arm around one of them. The other stands close to her. Smiling, but awkward and tentative. \nMARYLIN Is that you? \nMILES Me. Yes. \nMARYLIN Oh. And that is -- mom? \nMILES Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother. \nMARYLIN You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes. \nMiles walks over to look at the picture. \nMILES Hmmm... \nMARYLIN And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you. \nMILES She never particularly cared for me. \nMARYLIN She didn't love you? \nMILES No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her \"type.\" She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup -- \n", "test2_true": "MILES Apparently she was very disappointed. \nMARYLIN Boy. Boy, oh boy. \nMarylin looks at the picture again. And yes -- you can see how hesitant Miles was. Marylin is moved. A flash of something genuine crosses her face. \nMARYLIN And here I thought my mother was... \nMILES Your mother was. \nMARYLIN Oh right. You met Patricia. \nShe takes a sip of coffee. Regards Miles. \nMARYLIN We're damaged goods. \nMILES No, we're not! \nMARYLIN We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something \"off\" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our \"deficiencies\" very early on. Maybe... \nMILES That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us. \nMARYLIN I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing. \nMILES No. \nMARYLIN Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust. \nShe stands. Picks up her purse. Walks over to him with an outstretched hand. \nMARYLIN Friends? \nMILES Don't go. Stay with me for a while. \nHe doesn't release her hand. Instead he draws her to him, and kisses her. She kisses him. He kisses her back. She... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMile and Marylin -- making love. \nLATER \nThey are in post coital wrap. \nMILES I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless. \nMARYLIN I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume. \nMILES And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you. \nMARYLIN What is it Miles? \nMILES I want... I want to... \nShe waits, puzzled. \nMILES I want to be your -- your wife. \nMARYLIN Huh? \nMILES No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife. \nMARYLIN Did you just propose to me? \nMILES Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do. \nMARYLIN Yes. \nMILES Yes? Yes, you do have more experience? \nMARYLIN Yes, Miles. I accept. \n", "test2_id": 1198, "test3_input": "She retrieves all the receipts from her purse. \nMARYLIN Miles.

It's you, Marylin. It is YOU. \nINT. KITCHEN \nMarylin is on the phone with Ruth. \nMARYLIN But Ruth -- things have changed -- yes -- yes I understand. But you see -- I couldn't file, did I? And maybe I wasn't going to file. Maybe -- maybe Ruth -- Yes. Okay. \nOUTSIDE BEDROOM - MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe bedroom door is closed. Marylin knocks repeatedly. \nMARYLIN Miles? Open the door, Miles. Please open the door. I want to talk to you. Miles? I'm coming in. Here I come. \nShe pushes the door open. No Miles in sight. On the bed, scrawled on a piece of mMm stationery, taped to one of the mMm Frette pillows -- a note which reads -- \"If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? AND IF YOU WRONG US SHALL WE NOT REVENGE?\" \nINT. KENNETH'S HOUSE \nKenneth stares at the chessboard. Court TV is on the background. \nTV SCREEN \nCOURT TV REPORTER \nWe are back at the Trial of New Jersey v. Medrano. Mr. Medrano is accused of killing his wife, Alicia in 1992. He claims it was suicide. Let's return to the courtroom. \nSee the action in the courtroom -- \nThe Prosecutor shows the jury an extremely large handgun. \nPROSECUTOR How far would this gun have to be in order to inflict a wound without leaving powder burns on the scalp. \nEXPERT WITNESS Approximately three feet. \nPROSECUTOR And how could Mrs. Medrano shoot herself in the back of the head from a distance of three feet? \nKENNETH Really long arms? \nHe moves a piece. \nMILES They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised. \nKENNETH It's your move, Miles. \nMILES (Sadly) I already made my move, Kenneth. \nINT. MASSEY HOUSE \nA private yoga class. Marylin, Sarah and Ramona are in the plow position. The yuppie Sikh instructor places his weight on Sarah. \nSARAH Vishu! Knock it off. That hurts. \nVISHNU Breathe through it. \nSarah tries a few deep breaths. Marylin concentrates hard. \nVISHNU That's good, Marylin. \nMARYLIN I don't even know where he is. He looked so devastated.

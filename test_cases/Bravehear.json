{"train": "HAMISH With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm! \nWILLIAM It's up to us, Hamish! \nHamish leans forward for a look, but William pulls him back. \nWILLIAM Not yet! Here he comes, be ready! \nThey wait; heavy FOOTSTEPS. Then from around the edge of the grove three enormous, ugly hogs appear. The boys hurling rotten eggs. The eggs slap the snouts of the pigs, who scatter as the boys charge, howling. We PULL BACK... as the sun goes down on their play. \nEXT. THE WALLACE HOUSE - SUNDOWN \nThe boys walk toward the house, beneath a lavender sky. \nHAMISH Wanna stay with me tonight? \nWILLIAM I wanna have supper waitin'. \nHAMISH We'll get those English pigs tomorrow. \nWILLIAM Aye, we'll get 'em. \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nWilliam's face appears at the window, looking toward \nTHE DISTANT HILLS \nof trees and heather, where there is no sign of life. \nINT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT \nWilliam has cooked stew in a pot, and now spoons up two steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table. But he is only hoping. He looks out the window again; he is still all alone. So he leaves a candle burning on the table beside the stew, and moves up the stairs. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN \nThe house is silent, fog rolling around it in the dawn. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN \nWilliam has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. He rises, and in QUICK CUTS: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed bed. He moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, also unrumpled. \nIN THE KITCHEN \nHe finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted candle. He spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nWilliam is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the hogs, while he glimpses something coming. \nTHE BOY'S POV \nAn ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers glance up at William, their faces grim... \nFrom his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact. \nCAMPBELL William... Come down here, lad. \nWilliam looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... but the bodies are still there. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nIt's now surrounded by horses, wagons, and neighbors. The undertaker arrives in his hearse. \nINT. THE SHED - DAY \nOn a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes. \nSoftly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work. \nWilliam approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood. \nThe undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the blood. But the wounds remain. \nEXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY \nCLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy, standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken. \nThe local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin. \nOnce again the boy stands in the doorway of the barn, looking at the garish, hanged faces in his nightmare. Then a mangled hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder, William gasps, but the hand holds him gently. He turns to see his father, and his brother! They are wounded, bloody, but they smile at him; they're alive! Weeping in joy, William reaches to hug them, but his father stretches forth a forbidding hand. \nWilliam keeps reaching out helplessly. His father and brother move past him to the hanged knights. Two empty nooses are there. Before the boy's weeping eyes they put their heads into the nooses, and hoist themselves up. \nWilliam's grief explodes; his tears erupt and \nHE WAKES IN HIS BEDROOM \ntears flooding down his face. A dream! Still upset, still grieving, he gets up and goes looking for his uncle. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nWilliam moves down to the room where his uncle would be sleeping. He opens the door. The bed has been slept in -- but his uncle is not there. He moves downstairs to \nTHE KITCHEN \nBut his uncle is not there either. Then William hears a strange, haunting sound-distant, carried by the wind. He moves to the window and sees only moonlight. He opens the window and hears it more clearly: bagpipes. William lights a candle and throws open the door. Wind rushes in, blowing out his candle. But he hears the pipes, louder in the wind. \nEXT. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT \nWilliam is barefoot and in only his nightshirt; but the sound of the pipes is growing louder. He moves through the moonlight, drawn toward -- the graveyard! He stops as he realizes this, then forces himself on. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT \nWilliam moves to the top of the hill where his ancestors are buried, and discovers a haunting scene: two dozen men, the farmer/warriors of his neighborhood, are gathered in kilts -- and among them, a core of bagpipers. The pipes wail an ancient Scottish dirge, a tune of grief and redemption, a melody known to us as \"Amazing Grace.\" Uncle Argyle has heard them and walked out too; he stands at the fringes of the torchlight, still holding the massive broadsword. He glances down, noticing William as the boy moves up beside him. William whispers... \nWILLIAM What are they doing? \nARGYLE Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes. \nThe farmers file by the graveside, crossing themselves, each whispering his own private prayer. Argyle whispers, half to William, and half to himself... \nARGYLE Your Daddy and I, we saw our own father buried like this, dead from fighting the English. \nWilliam takes the sword from his uncle, and tries to lift it. \nSlowly, Argyle takes the sword back. \nARGYLE First learn to use this. \nHe taps William on the temple with the tip of his finger. \nARGYLE Then I will teach you to use this. \nWith an expert's easy fluidity, he lifts the huge sword. It glistens in the torchlight. The music plays, the notes hanging in the air, swirling in the Scottish breeze as if rising towards the stars... \nEXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY \nWilliam and his uncle ride off in a farm wagon. William has a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back. But he does glance back just once, to see the deserted farmhouse. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - ROYAL WEDDING - DAY \nAmid the scarlet and ermine robes of officiating lords, with gemstones sparkling everywhere, we hear... \nVOICE OVER Twelve years later, Longshanks supervised the wedding of his eldest son, also named Edward, who would succeed him to the throne. \nLONGSHANKS, King of England, stands in the jeweled light of the ancient Abbey. Known as Longshanks because of the spindly legs that make him almost seven feet tall, he has a hawk's nose and a snake's eyes, punctuating a face of distinct cruelty. Historians of his day considered him and the line of Plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers. \nVOICE OVER As bride for his son, Longshanks had chosen a relative of his rival, the king of France. \nGENEVIEVE, a nineteen-year-old virgin of stupendous beauty moves down the aisle, the light in her face outshining her blindingly white wedding gown. As she reaches the altar her hands tremble, but she maintains her poise and control. \nShe looks toward EDWARD, Prince of Wales. Pampered young men surround him as his retinue. He takes her hand coldly and goes through the ceremony under his father's stare. \nVOICE OVER It was widely whispered that for the Princess to conceive, Longshanks would have to do the honors himself. That may have been what he had in mind all along. \nThe ceremony concluding, attendants lift back the bride's veil. Her wedding day, the ultimate moment -- and Prince Edward ignores her, to turn back to his friends. But prompted by one of the sour lords, he leans over and pecks his new Princess on the cheek. For an instant, we see in her eyes that her heart is dying. But she keeps her poise. \nVOICE OVER Having seen to his obligations to provide for a successor, Longshanks set about his fondest business -- to crush Scotland, and turn his power against France... \nCLOSE - A MAP OF THE BRITISH ISLES \nLongshanks' narrow finger jabs Scotland. \nLONGSHANKS Scotland! Scot-land! \nWe are in the -- \nEDWARD You may. \nShe starts to leave, as quietly as she came. But her husband calls after her. \nEDWARD Don't worry, m'Lady, it is my royal responsibility to breed. And I assure you, when the time comes, I shall... manage. \nShe closes the door softly, on her husband and his lover. \nVOICE OVER Now in Edinburgh were gathered the council of Scottish nobles... \nESTABLISHING COUNCIL - DAY \nThe picturesque heart of Scotland, with its CASTLE on a fairy tale plateau above the Firth of Forth. \nINT. EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY \nThe nobles are gathered around a huge table. They rise at the entrance of young ROBERT THE BRUCE, a handsome young man, full of intelligence and power. \nVOICE OVER Among these was Robert, the 17th Earl of Bruce, a leading contender for the crown of Scotland. \nRobert strides to his seat in the center of the table, and the others settle in respectfully. MORNAY, another young warrior, gives him a bow, as does CRAIG, a grizzled noble. \nCRAIG Young Robert, we are honored -- \nROBERT My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes. \nCRAIG Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here. \nMORNAY The Balliol clan has endorsed the right, licking Longshanks' boots so he will support their claim to the throne. If we make a show of opposition, the commoners will favor us. \nROBERT It is too soon to step out alone. My father believes we must lull Longshanks into confidence, by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it. \nCRAIG A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council. \nROBERT He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland. \nEXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE, AT THE EDGE OF TOWN - DAY \nFlutes and dancing; laughter and garlands; village families have gathered for a wedding celebration -- we see the happy bride and groom. Farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of cheese; villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of smoked fish. \nAnd watching the people are ubiquitous English soldiers, battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears. \nRiding along the road comes William Wallace. Grown now, a man. He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, his hands relaxed on the reins. He has a look of lean, rippled power. He looks dangerous. \nAnd the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes. \nHe carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the scene. Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters of marriageable age. \nAmong those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough. William dismounts and ties his horse to a willow. One of the English SOLDIERS shoves William from behind. \nSOLDIER Hey boy! You hunt this bird? \nWilliam's eyes fix themselves on the soldier. \nSOLDIER It's against the law for Scots to own bows. You shot this bird? \nHis buddies, enjoying their role as intimidators, grab the bird and begin to search it for evidence. \nWILLIAM I hit it in the head. With a rock. \nThey don't believe that -- but they can't find any puncture wound on the bird. William reaches his hand out for the return of the bird. The soldiers drop it onto the ground. \nSlowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing. \nThe farmers watch him come. \nAmong those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her back. Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a wildflower. She's the most beautiful girl in the village, maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William notice her too. \nWilliam reaches the food table and contributes his goose to the feast. FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one. \nWILLIAM Miz MacDougal. You look well. \nFARM WOMAN ...William? It's William Wallace, back home! -- Have you met my daughter? \nThe daughter mentioned is missing teeth. William nods to her. It's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment. But then raises her face in surprise as William takes her hand and gives her a respectful bow. \nHe moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like a stranger. Then he glances toward the knot of girls. He sees Marion. She sees him, then looks away. Do they remember each other? He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him. \nThey move closer and closer together. Just as they are about to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth at Williams' feet. \nGrinning, they embrace. MUSIC plays, the dancing begins. \nWilliam walks to the knot of young ladies... but passes Marion, and moves to the girl with the missing teeth. \nWILLIAM Would you honor me with a dance? \nShe's thrilled to accept; they begin to dance. \nGIRL You've taken over your father's farm? (beat) They say he died long ago. Fighting the English. \nWILLIAM He died in an accident, with my brother. Their cart turned over. \nThe musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, reining their horses into the middle of the celebration. In the middle of the group is an English NOBLEMAN; he is gray, in his fifties, and stops in front of the BRIDE and groom. \nNOBLEMAN I have come to claim the right of prima noctes. As the lord of these lands, I will bless this marriage by taking the bride into my bed on the first night of her union. \nStewart, father of the BRIDE, lunges forward. \nSTEWART No, by God! \nThe horsemen point their lances at the unarmed Scots -- who see that the English soldiers from the village have moved to the edge of the gathering, as if to dare any resistance. \nNOBLEMAN It is my noble right. \nEven unarmed, Stewart is about to attack -- but the bride intervenes. She grabs her father and whispers to him. She moves to her husband and does the same. Holding back tears, she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen. Marion MacClannough is looking on, sobered by her friend's courage and sickened by her fate -- and Marion is even more unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers, a particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face, is leering at her. William Wallace sees this too. \nThe noble and his escorts ride away, and as they do it begins to rain. The celebration destroyed, the Scots gather the food and disperse to their homes. But Wallace remains, standing in the downpour, keeping his thoughts to himself. \nEXT. THE WALLACE FARMHOUSE - MAGIC HOUR \nThe farmhouse looks lonely and forlorn. William stands at the open door, and gazes out at the rain; it leaks on him, through his roof; he doesn't seem to notice. \nEXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR \nA thatched cottage, lit with a cozy fire, beneath the rain. \nA hand KNOCKS on the door, and MacClannough opens it to find William, on a horse! MacClannough frowns. \nWILLIAM Good evening, sir. May I speak with your daughter? \nMrs. MacClannough shoulders up beside her husband, and Marion appears behind her scowling parents. \nWILLIAM Marion... Would you like to go for a ride on this fine evening? \nMOTHER The boy's insane! \nWILLIAM It's good Scottish weather, Madam, the rain is fallin' straight down. \nMOTHER She absolutely may not, she'll -- Marion! \nMarion has grabbed a cloak off the back of the door; she runs out to hop up behind William, and they gallop away. \nTHE RIDE - MAGIC HOUR \nWilliam and Marion race along the heather, up and down hills, through swollen streams. The rain stops, as the sun sets; the Scottish mists lift, revealing stunning natural beauty. \nWilliam stops the horse and they look out over it all together. He speaks, without turning to face her. \nWILLIAM Your father doesn't like me, does he? \nMARION It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long. \nWILLIAM Thank you for accepting. \nMARION Thank you for inviting. \nWILLIAM I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy. \nMARION You are. And I'll come again. \nHe lingers; he wants to say something, or maybe he just doesn't want the moment to end. Finally he spurs the horse. \nEXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT \nThey reach the door. William hops off the horse and reaches up to help her down the moment she touches the ground, they look into each other's eyes... but the door is snatched open so quickly by her mother that there is not time for a kiss. \nMOTHER Marion, come in! \nHe walks her closer to the door. They turn and look at each other again. She waits for him to kiss her... \nINSERT - HIS NOTE \nTonight. By the trees. \nEXT. MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMarion slips out of the house and runs to the trees, where William waits with horses. She fetches a bundle she's stashed in the crook of a tree, and they mount and ride off. \nEXT. RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CHURCH - NIGHT \nThe church is at the base of the precipice, beside the loch. \nINT. THE CHURCH - NIGHT \nThis ancient Gaelic place of worship has been destroyed by the occupying army, and yet it looks devoutly holy this way, lit only by candles and moonlight through the open roof. The village PRIEST whom we saw at the wedding celebration is waiting at the altar. Marion steps into the confessional, as William moves to the altar and kneels in prayer. \nMarion emerges; she's changed into the wedding dress she made from the cloth she bought. William stands and watches her float down the aisle; his whole life was worth this moment. \nTogether, the two lovers turn to the priest. \nPRIEST You have come to pledge, each to the other, before Almighty God. \nFrom within his shirt, William withdraws a strip of cloth woven in his family tartan. He and Marion each lift a hand to the priest, and he binds their wrists with the cloth. \nWILLIAM I will love you my whole life. You and no other. \nFrom her dress she takes a handmade handkerchief, embroidered with a thistle to look like the one she first gave him those years ago. \nMARION And I you. You and no other. Forever. \nThe Priest waits for them to go on, but neither can; they're too taken with emotion, looking at each other. The Priest intones holy phrases... \nPRIEST Agus bhayd lauch... The Lord bless and keep thy love, now and forever. \nThe lovers kiss. As they break their embrace, a figure carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes. \nPRIEST I trust him -- or I'd'a killed him me'self. A weddin' needs pipes. \nThe piper begins to play, and the tune from his primitive chanter is wispy, ethereal, beautiful. The lovers look into each other's eyes, as the single melody of the pipes merges into a swell of music, UNDERSCORING MONTAGE \nWilliam and Marion ride the path to the top of the precipice, where, in the shelter of the grove, they spend their honeymoon. The MUSIC CONTINUES as, still sweaty from their love-making, he returns her to her house just before dawn. \nShe waves from her window, as William rides away, as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. VILLAGE OF LANARK - DAY \nIt's Market Day in the village, busy with Highlanders, merchants of all kinds, and a few special attractions like jugglers and fortune tellers. Marion moves along a table full of flowers and fruit... William, concealed behind hanging baskets, watches her unseen, savoring the beauty of his beloved, bathing his soul in the sight of her. Then she looks up and spots him, her smile sudden and luminous, before she remembers to conceal it. He moves up beside her. \nWILLIAM I've missed you. \nMARION Shush. It's only been a day. (beat) And it's seemed like forever. \nWILLIAM Tonight then. \nMARION My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night! \nPlayfully he pokes his finger under the collar of her dress, pulling up the strip of checked cloth he gave her at their wedding, which she now wears hidden around her neck. \nWILLIAM Then when? \nMARION ...Tonight! \nTucking in the cloth strip, she hurries away, smiling. \nANGLE - DRUNKEN ENGLISH SOLDIERS - BY AN ALE CASK - DAY \nThey spot Marion moving through the fair, glowing, beautiful. \nThe soldiers smirk at each other; as Marion passes, one of them grabs her wrist. It's the soldier with the scar, the one who's been staring at her. \nSOLDIER Where are you going... lass? \nMARION Let go. \nA second drunken SOLDIER pipes up. \nSOLDIER #2 Why don't you marry my friend here? Then I'll take the first night! \nMAGISTRATE So why is this strip concealed? (beat) He fought for you, eh? \nEXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY \nThe Magistrate and his men bring Marion into the village center, and tie her to a post of the well. The townspeople don't want to be near the soldiers, but they hang on the fringes of the square, too curious to pull away. \nMAGISTRATE An assault on the king's soldiers is the same as assaulting the king! \nHe looks down at Marion, her mouth bound, her eyes defiant. \nHe jerks out his dagger and slices Marion's throat! \nHer eyes spring open like a doe's; then she sags, dead. The townspeople are speechless; even some of the soldiers are shocked. The Magistrate turns calmly to his men. \nMAGISTRATE Now. Let this scrapper come to me. \nLONG SHOT - EXT. THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY \nFrom a distance, we see Hamish approaching the grove, the same one where he and William played as boys. Hamish moves reluctantly, forcing himself forward; as he reaches the grove, William appears, hurrying out to him. \nWe STAY IN THE LONG SHOT, seeing William asking anxiously for any news, and seeing Hamish's great shoulders as he tells him something that makes William step backwards... \nEXT. LANARK VILLAGE - DAY \nAt a barrier across the main road into the center of the village are twenty professional soldiers, entrenched, fully armed -- bows, pikes, swords. They hear A HORSE'S SNORT... \nTHE ENGLISH SOLDIERS' POV - WALLACE, ON HIS HORSE \nHe has stopped, rock still. The soldiers hush; there is something unsettling about this man alone, staring at the twenty of them, as if to steel himself for the butchery. \nWallace raises his sword, screams... and charges! \nEXT. VARIOUS ANGLES - LANARK VILLAGE - DAY - THE FIGHT \nWe FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their eyes white with fear... They stand to shoot at him with their bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past... \nThe arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catch his flesh. He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head! \nThe soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers. \nWALLACE RACES THROUGH THE VILLAGE - FAVORING HIS POV \nHe dodges obstacles in the narrow streets -- chickens, carts, barrels. Soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over; the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next chops down on his left side; every time he swings the broadsword, a man dies. \nWallace gallops on; his farmer neighbors, and people from the village, follow in his wake. \nEXT. IN THE VILLAGE - DAY \nThe Magistrate hears the APPROACHING SHOUTS. He and thirty more of his men are barricaded around the village square. \nMAGISTRATE Don't look surprised! We knew he'd bring friends! \nThe see Wallace gallop into sight; but he stops, then heads down a side street. \nThe Magistrate and his men don't like this; where did he go? \nWhich way will he come from? And then they hear the horses, and see the other Scots, at the head of the main street. The soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them. \nThey are loading to fire again when Wallace runs in -- on foot! -- and cuts down two soldiers! The other Scots charge! \nThe startled soldiers break and run in every direction. \nThe Magistrate, abandoned, runs too. Wallace pursues. \nNot far along a twisting lane, the bulky Magistrate falters. \nHe turns to fight, and Wallace slashes away his sword. \nMAGISTRATE No! I beg you... mercy! \nIN THE TOWN SQUARE \nAs the Scots see Wallace, they break off pursuing the English soldiers and stop to watch; dragging the Magistrate by his hair, Wallace hauls him back into the village square, slams him against the well, and stands over him with heaving lungs and wild eyes, staring at Marion's murderer. \nMAGISTRATE Please. Mercy! \nWallace's eyes shift, falling on \nTHE STAIN OF BLOOD \nWALLACE Today we will spare you, and every man who has yielded. Go back to England. Tell them Scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more. Tell them Scotland is free. \nAs the Scots cheer, Wallace throws Lord Bottoms onto the nag's back and slaps the horse's rear. IT shambles away, followed by the English survivors, as the Scots chant... \nSCOTS Wal-lace, Wal-lace, Wal-lace!... \nCLOSE - A GRAVESTONE - EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY \nThe marker is carved with the name MARION MacCLANNOUGH, and beneath her name A THISTLE is chiseled into the stone. \nBagpipes wail like banshees and the Priest who married Marion and William now mutters ancient prayers as her body, wrapped in burial canvas, is lowered into the earth, under the sad eyes of those who just fought in the battle. \nOpposite William stands old MacClannough; he stares across the open hole that accepts the body of his daughter, his eyes full of pain, and then staggers away. \nWallace kneels at the graveside in unspeakable grief. From within his shirt he withdraws the embroidered handkerchief she gave him, and the bloodstained strip of cloth he gave her. He places the strip over her heart, and as the gravediggers fill the hole her returns the handkerchief to its spot over his own heart. \nEXT. LONDON PALACE - DAY \nPrince Edward is in his garden, playing the medieval version of croquet with his friend. The Princess, ignored, sits watching. Longshanks marches through the game, furious. \nLONGSHANKS Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms! \nEDWARD I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more. \nLongshanks slaps his son, knocking him down among the colored balls and wickets. Everyone gasps, stunned. \nLONGSHANKS You weak little coward! Stand up! \nLongshanks jerks him to his feet. \nLONGSHANKS I go to France to press our rights there! I leave you to handle this little rebellion, do you understand? DO YOU?! \nLongshanks grabs his son by the throat. \nLONGSHANKS And turn yourself into a man. \nThe king leaves. The friends of the humiliated Prince hurry to him and lift him; as the Princess moves to him too... \nEDWARD Get away from me! \nHe slaps her! Her personal guards, Frenchmen in distinctive uniforms, jump from their seats at the edge of the garden, but the Princess raises a hand to show she needs no assistance, and curtseys to Edward, who shouts -- \nEDWARD Convene my military council! \nAs Edward marches off with his entourage, NICOLETTE, a beautiful raven-haired Handmaiden, rushes to the Princess, who is wobbly, hurt more than she let show. Nicolette whispers to her in French, with subtitles... \nNICOLETTE They say this Wallace killed thirty men to avenge the death of his woman. I hope your husband goes to Scotland. Then you'll be a widow. \nINT. BRUCE'S CASTLE - BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT \nRobert the Bruce is in bed with a young Nordic beauty with vacant blue eyes. She drowses; but the lovemaking has not defused the restlessness of Robert's spirit. He lies on his stomach, turned away from her on the bed. Stirring, she kisses his neck; but he doesn't respond. \nWOMAN I wanted to please you. \nROBERT You did. \nBut he is numb as she nuzzles him again. She sags back, and he still stares away, lost in thought. Realizing her hurt, he explains... \nROBERT In Lanark village, the king's soldiers killed a girl. Her lover fought his way through the soldiers and killed the magistrate. \nShe looks at him blankly. \nROBERT He rebelled. He rebelled. He acted. He fought! Was it rage? Pride? Love? Whatever it was, he has more of it than I. \nWOMAN (hurt) You might have lied. \nROBERT I'm too arrogant to lie. \nCLOSE - ROBERT THE BRUCE \nOn his FACE as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase. \nHe follows a servant who carries a candle against the gloom. \nThey reach a door, which the servant unlocks. Young Robert takes the candle, and enters -- \nA DARKENED ROOM \nRobert wills himself forward, and places the candle on a table in the center of the room. A SHUFFLE in the dark; then moving into the light is a LEPER whose once-noble features are decaying with the disease. Isolated in his disfiguration, he looks at his visitor -- his son -- with the eyes of the condemned. Young Robert forces himself not to look away. \nWALLACE The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them. \nSTEPHEN Who would do such a thing? \nWALLACE Exactly. \nWallace pulls out his dagger... \nTHE DOGS \nbark frantically now; they smell a kill; they tug so hard at their leashes that the handlers are almost dragged along. \nHANDLER Be ready! We have them! \nThe soldiers grip their weapons, ready to take their prisoners. They burst into the little clearing; the dogs find a body, stabbed, his throat cut; the dogs plunge their snouts into the gore, yipping wildly. The handlers must fight furiously to tear the dogs from the body. \nLord Pickering approaches the body and looks down. It is Faudron, mangled now but clearly identifiable -- with the scarf he gave William, in place of William's own, tucked into his shirt. \nLORD PICKERING Damnation! Damnation! \nAs Pickering rants, his men look at the darkness all around. \nLORD PICKERING After him! Get them going again! \nHANDLER Their noses are drowned in new blood, they'll follow nothing now! \nAnd just as the realization hits Pickering that he can't pursue Wallace any further, a cloaked figure mixed in among his men leans in from behind him to whisper... \nSTEPHEN OF IRELAND The Almighty says for you to give His regards to the Devil. \nPickering's eyes go wide, then roll back as Stephen's dagger slides expertly through his back ribs and into his heart. As Pickering falls and his men realize what has happened, Stephen has already run back into the trees. \nPickering's men freeze at this sudden turn of events. Even the dogs whimper, picking up the rising fear of the men around them. Then from the darkness all around them comes a chorus of demonic, bloodcurdling yells -- \nWALLACE/HAMISH/STEPHEN ARRRRRGGGGGGGHHHH! \nThree wild men tear out of the darkness from different directions, their swords slashing. Pickering's men panic and run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by their torches, fell with them in all directions. \nWallace, Hamish and Stephen are left alone in the heart of the woods, howling, barking like dogs, snarling like wolves -- and then laughing like hyenas! \nSTEPHEN I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger! \nWALLACE No English lord would trust an Irishman! \nHAMISH Let's kill him anyway. \nThey laugh again; then Wallace's laughter leaks away, and he stares into the trees, where he saw Marion in his dream. \nVARIOUS SHOTS - THE STORY SPREADS THROUGH SCOTLAND... \nTwo men are talking in A VILLAGE... \nVILLAGER ...and William Wallace killed fifty men! Fifty, if it was one! \nThe same tale is exchanged by two farmers AT A CROSSROADS... \nFARMER A hundred men! With his own sword! He cut a through the English like -- \nThe tale is repeated IN A TAVERN... \nDRINKER -- Moses through the Red Sea! Hacked off two hundred heads! \nDRINKER #2 Two hundred?! \nDRINKER Saw it with my own eyes. \nAnd the rumors are discussed even INSIDE THE PALACE GROUNDS IN LONDON, where the Prince and his friends are trying on elaborate attire presented them by fawning tailors, and the Princess, ignored by her husband, strolls and chats with her Handmaiden, Nicolette (in subtitled French). \nNICOLETTE When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north. \nPRINCESS How do you know this? \nNICOLETTE Last night I slept with a member of the War Council. \nPRINCESS He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed. \nNICOLETTE Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for. \nThe Princess blushes, whacks her with her fan, and smiles. \nWallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen men, now frightened, ready to desert. We play this picture, Wallace sitting his horse, looking down in awe at this thing that has grown beyond anyone's imagination. \nHe glances at his friends: Campbell, Hamish, Stephen. \nThey've got no suggestions, they're just as awed as he is. \nSCOTTISH VETERAN We didn't come to fight for them! \nSHOUTS FROM MOB Home! The English are too many! \nWallace raises his hand, and the army falls silent. \nWALLACE Sons of Scotland!... I am William Wallace! \nSOLDIER William Wallace is seven feet tall! \nWALLACE Yes, I have heard! He kills men by the hundreds! And if he were here, he would consume the English with fireballs from his eyes, and bolts of lightning from his ass! \nMany laugh -- all get the point. \nWALLACE I am William Wallace. And my enemies do not go away. I saw our good nobles hanged. My wife... I am William Wallace. And I see a whole army of my countrymen, here in defiance of tyranny. You have come to fight as free men. And free men you are! What will you do with freedom? Will you fight? \nVETERAN Two thousand, against ten? We will run -- and live! \nWALLACE Yes. Fight and you may die. Run and you will live, at least awhile. And dying in your bed many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that, for one chance to come back here as young men, and tell our enemies that they make take our lives, but they will never take our freedom? \nDown on the plain, English emissaries in all their regal finery gallop over the bridge, under a banner of truce. \nVETERAN Look! The English comes to barter with our nobles for castles and titles. And our nobles will not be in the front of the battle! \nWALLACE No! They will not! \nHe dismounts, and draws his sword. \nWALLACE And I will. \nSlowly, the chant begins, and builds... \nSCOTS Wal-lace! Wal-lace! WAL-LACE! \nBAGPIPERS play, pulling the mob back into companies. But through the lifting mists they see the overwhelming enemy army. Hamish, Campbell and Stephen move up beside William. \nSTEPHEN Fine speech. Now what do we do? \nWALLACE Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field. \nCampbell, Hamish and Stephen ride off. Mornay reins his horse over, lifts the reins of Wallace's horse, and extends them to him: an invitation to join the pre-battle talks. \nWallace mounts up and rides out with the Scottish nobles to meet the English contingent. \nOUT ON THE FIELD, THE TWO GROUPS OF RIDERS \nmeet like the captains of football teams before the kickoff. CHELTHAM, head of the English contingent, glares at Wallace. \nCHELTHAM Mornay. Lochlan. Inverness. \nMORNAY Cheltham. This is William Wallace \nCHELTHAM Here are the King's terms. Lead this army off the field, and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire, including hereditary title, from which you will pay him an annual -- \nWALLACE I have an offer for you. \nCHELTHAM ...From which you will pay the King an annual duty... \nWallace pulls his broadsword and snaps it at Cheltham, whose eyes flash in disbelief at the bad manners. \nLOCHLAN You disrespect a banner of truce?! \nWALLACE From his king? Absolutely. Here are Scotland's terms. Lower your flags and march straight to England, stopping at every Scottish home you pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred years of theft, rape, and murder. Do that, and your men shall live. Do it not, and every one of you will die today. \nCheltham barks at the Scottish nobles... \nCHELTHAM You are outmatched! You haven't even any cavalry! In two centuries no army has won without it! \nWALLACE I'm not finished. Before we let you leave, your commander must cross that bridge, stand before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own ass. \nThe outraged Englishman gallops back to his lines. \nMORNAY I'd say that was rather less cordial that he was used to. \nWALLACE Tell Mornay to ride to the flank and cross upstream. Wait! Tell him to be sure the English see him ride away! \nHamish hurries off with the message. \nThe English infantry keeps moving across the little bridge. \nThe Scottish nobles watch from their positions on horseback. \nThey have a few dozen mounted riders, none heavily armored. \nLOCHLAN If he waits much longer -- \nHamish hurries up. \nHAMISH Ride around and ford behind them! \nMORNAY We should not divide our forces! \nHAMISH Wallace says do it! And he says for you to let the English see you! \nMORNAY (understanding) They shall think we run away. \nMornay leads his riders away. \nLORD TALMADGE \nsees the Scottish nobles ride off, and shouts to Cheltham... \nTALMADGE See! Every Scot with a horse is fleeing! Hurry! Hurry! \nHe drives half his army across the river. \nWALLACE \nlifts his sword. \nWALLACE For Scotland! \nHe charges down the hill... \nTHE FIGHT AT STIRLING BRIDGE - VARIOUS SHOTS \nThe Scots follow Wallace on foot, charging into the English. \nThe English leaders are stunned by the ferocious attack. \nTALMADGE Press reinforcements across! \nThe English leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers onto the bridge, which only hams them up. Meanwhile, on the other side of the bridge, Wallace and his charging men slam into the English infantry with wild fury. The English fall back on each other, further blocking the bridge. \nUP ON THE HILLTOP \nThe nobles look back with grudging admiration. \nMORNAY He's taking the bloody bridge! The English can't get across! He's evened the odds at one stroke! \nWith rising desire to join the bandwagon, the nobles spur... \nDOWN ON THE PLAIN, Wallace and the attacking men drive the English back, killing as they go. The Scots reach the bridge itself. The waters below it run red with blood. \nTalmadge has begun to panic. \nTALMADGE Use the archers! \nGENERAL They're too close, we'll shoot out own men! \nON THE BRIDGE \nthe Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; nothing can stop them. Wallace is relentless; each time he swings, a head flies, or an arm. Hamish and Stephen fight beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. Old Campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an English swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but Campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs him. Reaching the English side of the bridge, the Scots begin to build a barrier with the dead bodies. \nThe English are not without courage. Cheltham leads a desperate counterattack. The Scots make an impenetrable barrier of slashing blades. Still Cheltham keeps coming; Wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, his hair, and his brain. \nTALMADGE has seen enough; he gallops away. The remaining English General tries to save the army. \nGENERAL We are still five thousand! Rally! \nThe English try to form up; but the Scottish horsemen, fording the river high upstream, come crashing into the English flank and ride over the surprised English infantry. \nAT THE BRIDGE, WALLACE \nWALLACE LISTEN TO ME! Longshanks understands this! This! \nHe brandishes the broadsword. \nWALLACE There is a difference between us. You think the people of this country exist to provide you with position. I think your position exists to provide the people with freedom. And I go to make sure they have it. \nWallace bangs through the door. Suppressing smiles, his friends file out behind him. \nINT. EDINBURGH CORRIDOR - DAY \nWallace and his men are marching away, as Robert the Bruce runs out after them. \nROBERT Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk. \nWALLACE And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less? \nROBERT No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead. \nWALLACE We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why. \nWallace walks; Robert catches up and speaks to him in an urgent half whisper, so that no one else can hear. \nROBERT I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles. \nWALLACE Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I. \nWallace walks away, leaving Robert the Bruce alone. \nTHE SCOTTISH ARMY - DAY \nWallace rides at the head of his army, moving through the countryside of northern England. It is autumn, the foliage is beautiful, the wheat fields gold with harvest. \nEXT. ESTABLISHING YORK CITY - DAY \nA medieval city guarded by a fortress. \nINT. THE FORTRESS - MAP ROOM - DAY \nThe ROYAL GOVERNOR is a spoiled young man, Longshanks' nephew. He is studying maps and written appeals for help; his CAPTAIN of defenses strides in with another note. \nCAPTAIN Message from your cousin, the Prince. He says London has no more troops to send. \nGOVERNOR Every town in Northern England is begging for help! Where will Wallace strike first? \nCAPTAIN I should think these smaller settlements along the border... \nThey hear shouts as a rider arrives and dismounts. They look out to see a panicked RIDER, who shouts up... \nRIDER He advances! \nGOVERNOR To what town? \nRIDER He comes here! \nSMASH TO: \nCARTS, RUMBLING IN PANIC DOWN A ROAD \nas civilians flee the walled city in the distance. \nTHE SCOTTISH ARMY \nhas cut a huge tree and placed it on wheels. It rumbles ominously TOWARD CAMERA... \nTHE CIVILIAN PANIC CONTINUES as more people join the swell of those leaving York. \nTHE SCOTTISH ARMY keeps coming on. \nINSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY - DAY \nThe governor is furious and confused. \nGOVERNOR We will not allow a bandit to panic the greatest city in Northern England! Close off the escapes! Let no one leave! \nCAPTAIN The city has emptied already, Sire. Only the Scottish civilians remain. \nThe Governor turns to his captain with a look worthy of his uncle, Longshanks the King. \nON THE BATTERING RAM \nThen Longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury; he grapples with Edward, knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the floor; then Longshanks kicks his son, again and again. He exhausts his fury on him. \nEdward is a bloody mess; Longshanks coughs up a bit of blood. \nHe ignores it and his son's wreckage, and goes back to the discussion, as if this fight was normal business. \nLONGSHANKS We must sue for a truce, and buy him off. But who will go to him? Not I. If I came under the sword of this murderer, I would end up like my nephew. And not you, the sight of my faggot son would only encourage an enemy to take over this country. So whom do I send? \nLongshanks calculates. \nEXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY \nA full encampment, across an English field; campfires chase the dawn chill. Soldiers sharpen swords and spear points. \nWallace is huddled with his inner circle, all except Campbell, who receives a report from a scout. \nCAMPBELL A royal entourage comes, flying banners of truce, and the standards of Longshanks himself! \nWallace buckles on his sword. \nAN ENGLISH PAVILION TENT - YORKSHIRE - DAY \nSet up for a meeting in a sunny meadow. Wallace and his men ride in, wary, ready for ambush. They surround the tent. \nThere are two dozen royal soldiers there, but they make no threatening moves. \nNo sound from the tent. Wallace rests his hand on the handle of his broadsword, ready. \nWALLACE Longshanks! I have come. \nServants pull back the sides of the tent door, and a tall, slender, shapely female figure appears there. There in the shadows, she looks just like Marion! William is not the only one who notices the resemblance; he glances at Hamish and Campbell and sees them haunted by it too. Is this another dream? He pales, as she steps into the morning sun. She moves toward him, her face lowered. It is Marion! \nShe reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the Princess! \nWilliam is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair. \nThe Princess is struck with Wallace, too -- tall, powerful, and commanding. Wallace dismounts, and moves to face her. \nTheir eyes hang on each other. She sees something that she has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life. \nShe surprises him by bending at the knee, in a half-submissive yet proud curtsey. \nPRINCESS I am the Princess of Wales. \nWALLACE Wife of Edward, the king's son? \nShe nods; somehow she is already ashamed. \nPRINCESS I come as the king's servant, and with his authority. \nWALLACE It's battle I want, not talk. \nPRINCESS But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman? \nShe leads him under the pavilion, a purple canopy shading rich carpets laid on the bare ground. Watching the gorgeous walk, Stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg like a horny dog. Hamish backhands him; Campbell, Hamish and Stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, shouldering their way in beside the Princess's French guards, so they can watch Wallace's back. The rest of the Scots surround the tent, ready for ambush. \nNicolette is among the royal attendants there; seeing Wallace, she shoots a glance at the Princess that says Ooo-La-La! The servants have brought a throne for the Princess, a lower chair for Wallace. She sits; he refuses the chair. \nShe studies him, taking in his anger and his pride. \nPRINCESS I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight. \nWALLACE I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are. \nPRINCESS Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin? \nWALLACE York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls. \nPRINCESS That is not possible. \nBut knowing Longshanks' family, she glances at a richly dressed Advisor, a CRONY of the king, who averts his eyes. \nWALLACE Longshanks did far worse, the last time he took a Scottish city. \nThe Crony mumbles to her in LATIN, WITH SUBTITLES... \nCRONY (Latin) He is a murdering bandit, he lies. \nWALLACE (Latin!) I am no bandit. And I do not lie. \nPRINCESS Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule. \nLONGSHANKS My greatness is better demonstrated with this. \nFrom a box at his feet the king withdraws a crossbow and throws it onto the table. Most of those there are shocked. \nEDWARD The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself! \nLONGSHANKS So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand. \nLongshanks smiles. No one notices that the Princess is deadly pale. \nEXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY \nThe Scots are lining up to leave their encampment. Wallace is about to give the signal to start the march when Hamish, beside him, comes alert; a small group of riders in distinctive attire are coming toward them; what can this be? \nHAMISH William -- French guards? \nThe riders stop at a distance, and out from their ranks comes a single rider, sitting sidesaddle. It is Nicolette. \nWallace and Hamish recognize her from the Princess's visit. \nShe trots her horse the rest of the way, while the French guards stay back. Hamish helps her from her horse. She moves to Wallace, and opens the heavy folds of her heavy riding cape. \nSecreted there, hung from a rope at her neck, is a crossbow. \nEXT. A FIELD IN SCOTLAND - DAY \nWallace has gathered the nobles, among them Robert the Bruce, Mornay, and old Craig, for a demonstration. Hamish and Stephen have placed a spearman's chestplate against a bale of hay. As William cranks the crossbow to its full cocked position and places a bolt in its slot, Stephen tucks a melon behind the armor. \nWilliam aims... and fires. The bolt slashes through the air and punches through the armor and the melon, leaving no doubt what it would do to a man's heart. The nobles pale. \nCRAIG That is why the Pope outlawed the weapon! It makes war too terrible. \nMORNAY How many does Longshanks have? \nWALLACE A thousand. (beat) You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face. \nCRAIG We must sue for peace. \nWALLACE Peace?! \nCRAIG We cannot defeat this -- \nWALLACE With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen! \nCRAIG It is suicide. \nROBERT Sir William -- \nThe Bruce sees Wallace about to explode, and tries to intervene -- but Wallace's anger is too great. \nWALLACE We won at Stirling and still you quibbled! We won at York and you would not support us! Then I said nothing! Now I say you are cowards! \nThe nobles grip their weapons; Wallace, Hamish and Stephen are ready to finish this quarrel right here. Robert the Bruce, backed by Mornay, steps between the two sides. \nROBERT Please, Sir William! Speak with me alone! I beg you! \nThe nobles stalk away, and Robert draws Wallace away, to the target Wallace shot, so they are alone. \nROBERT You have achieved more than anyone dreamed. But fighting these odds looks like rage, not courage. Peace offers its rewards! Has war become a habit you cannot break? \nThe question strikes deep. \nWALLACE War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you. \nROBERT I am trying. \nWALLACE Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it. \nROBERT I must... consult with my father. \nWALLACE And I will consult with mine. \nRobert the Bruce walks off the field, heading the way the other nobles went. Wallace rejoins Hamish and Stephen. They look to him; what do we do now? \nWALLACE Remember when the English turned their hounds on us? Maybe we should introduce them to our dogs. \nINT. THE DARKENED ROOM OF BRUCE THE ELDER, THE LEPER \nMornay, in an opulent bedchamber hung with tapestries and carpeted with eastern rugs, lies in bed, tossing in the restless sleep of a tortured soul. \nHe thinks he hears galloping. In SUBLIMINAL FLASHES he DREAMS of Wallace riding toward him. \nHe wakes, and listens to a strange noise. It is hoofbeats! \nComing closer. He hears shouts too, screams from below -- and those strange, approaching hoofbeats... \nWALLACE, ON HORSEBACK \nrides up the circular stairs inside Mornay's castle! His horse bounds up the stone -- Mornay's guards are behind him, on foot, pursuing. \nAt a landing, Wallace cuts down a guard, and gallops higher. \nIN HIS BED, MORNAY \nsits up gawking as the door explodes inward and Wallace rides through! Mornay is frozen. Wallace slashes him down. \nOut in the corridor, the guards gather; they have Wallace trapped. He covers the horse's eyes with a cloth and spurs his flanks. The blind animal runs through the window! \nEXT. CASTLE - NIGHT - SLOW MOTION \nThe horse and rider plunge past the sheer walls of the castle... and into the loch! Mornay's guards and the castle servants cluster at the windows to see Wallace and the horse surface, and swim to the shore, escaping! \nEXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE - DAY \nThe news has spread through the countryside. In the town square, drunken Scotsmen chant... \nPEOPLE Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace! \nOld Craig rides past them, heading toward the Bruce's castle on the hill above the town. \nINT. BRUCE CASTLE - DAY \nRobert is in his central room; he hears the chanting from far below. Old Craig enters. \nROBERT Is it true about Mornay? \nCraig hands him the bloody nightshirt Mornay was wearing. \nROBERT And he rode through the window? My God. \nHe can't hide his admiration. From below, he still hears the people CHANTING... \nEXT. LONDON - GARDENS - DAY \nLongshanks and Edward are in the royal gardens, resplendent with spring. Longshanks pulls a new flower, and crushes it. \nLONGSHANKS His legend grows! It will be worse than before! \nEDWARD You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this. \nLongshanks glowers at his son; the Princess arrives. \nPRINCESS Good day to you, M'Lords. \nEDWARD You mock us with a smile? \nPRINCESS I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion. \nEDWARD Wallace's followers. \nPRINCESS Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way. \nEdward snickers in derision -- but his wife is steel. \nPRINCESS I have faced him. Have you? \nLONGSHANKS Let her speak. \nPRINCESS He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them. \nEDWARD The little cow is insane -- \nPRINCESS Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush. \nLONGSHANKS You see, my delicate son? I have picked you a Queen. \nEXT. THE PRINCESS' SCOTTISH CASTLE - DAY \nShe wants to say something -- but instead she says something else. \nPRINCESS There will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month. Food and weapons. They will trav -- \nWILLIAM No. Stop. I didn't come here for that. \nPRINCESS Then why did you come? \nWALLACE Why did you? \nPRINCESS Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met. \nHe turns his face away. Gently, she pulls it back. \nPRINCESS I know. You looked at me... and saw her. \nHe twists back toward the window. \nPRINCESS You must forgive me what I feel. No man has ever looked at me as you did. \nSurprised, he looks at her now. \nWALLACE You have... you have a husband. \nPRINCESS I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises. \nSlowly, it starts to dawn on him what she's asking, and an unexpected smile plays at his lips. Her smile lights too. \nPRINCESS You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king? \nWALLACE I cannot love you for the sake of revenge. \nPRINCESS No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you? \nSlowly, he reaches to the candle flame, and pinches it out. \nIN THE SHADOWS OF THE COTTAGE BED \nwe see the surging, pent-up passion... and \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE LOVERS \nTheir bodies limp, they lie asleep, entwined. The first rays of morning spread yellow light through the room and across their faces. \nWallace wakes suddenly; sunlight! He grabs for his clothes, as she wakes, covers herself in the blanket and jumps out of bed, rushing to the window to look out. \nPRINCESS No one! Hurry! \nHe reaches her, throws the window open, and sees a clear path down the wall to safety. He stops and looks at her, and touches her face in gratitude. She has to ask... \nPRINCESS When we... did you think of her? \nPausing to look straight into her eyes, he kisses her -- her, not Marion -- and climbs out. She watches him go. \nEXT. GROVE OF TREES - NIGHT \nWallace stands alone in the grove where Marion lies. \nMONTAGE \n-- Wallace and fifty men gallop through a village on the way to an English fortress; the villagers drop what they're doing and run to follow them; we see Wallace's face, relentless, as he hacks men down in the attack; with the fortress sacked and smoking in the background, we see Wallace lead his men away, the people cheering him... \nEXT. FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nOnce again, Wallace stares at the fire, beside his friends. \nHAMISH Rest, William. \nWALLACE I rest. \nHAMISH Your rest is making me exhausted. \nStephen offers the jug; Wallace declines. \nSTEPHEN Come, it'll help you sleep. \nWALLACE Aye. But it won't let me dream. \nWilliam, Hamish, and Stephen are on their horses, looking down at the road leading into the city. Wallace hands his dagger to Stephen, and unbuckles his broadsword and gives it to Hamish. \nHAMISH Keep these. We're going too. \nWALLACE No. One of us is enough. \nWallace hugs them, first Stephen, then Hamish. Tears roll down Hamish's cheeks. With one last look at his friends, Wallace rides away. \nEXT. LARGE ESTATE HOUSE - SUNSET \nThe house looks quiet as Wallace rides toward it. \nINT. ESTATE HOUSE - DAY \nRobert the Bruce and Craig stand at the hearth, tense. \nCRAIG He won't come. \nROBERT He will. I know he will. \nThey hear the approach of a single horse. The Bruce looks out to see Wallace arriving. \nROBERT Here. And unarmed. My God, he has a brave heart. \nOUTSIDE THE HOUSE \nWallace dismounts and enters. \nINT. THE HOUSE \nWallace appears at the doorway into the main room, and stops. \nBruce faces him. The eyes of BOTH MEN meet, saying everything. Wallace steps into the room. He sees something flicker onto Bruce's face -- shame -- just as henchmen in the rafters drop a weighted net and it envelopes Wallace. \nEnglish soldiers spring from the closets, run down the stairs, and tumble over him, ripping at his clothes, searching as if broadswords might spring from his boots. \nThey bind Wallace hand and foot. He stares at Robert the Bruce, who averts his eyes. The soldiers hurry Wallace out the back, where others are bringing up horses. Robert grabs the English Captain of the soldiers. \nROBERT He is not to be harmed. I have your king's absolute promise that he will be imprisoned only! \nThe Captain looks at Bruce the way the High Priest must have looked at Judas, and leaves. \nCRAIG Now we will have peace. \nRobert the Bruce spots something on the floor that must have fallen from Wallace's clothes as they grabbed him; Bruce lifts the white handkerchief, and sees the familiar thistle embroidered on it. \nEXT. ROAD - NORTHERN ENGLAND - DAY \nA procession of heavily armed English soldiers winds its way toward London, Wallace strapped to an unsaddled horse, his head bare to the sun. Country people come out to jeer... \nPEOPLE Don't look so fearsome, does he?! \nA thrown rock careens off Wallace's check; rotten fruit slaps his shirt. His lips are so parched they bleed. \nINT. ROYAL PALACE - LONGSHANKS' BEDROOM - DAY \nEdward inspects his father, who lies semiconscious in bed, breath rattling ominously in his chest. Edward approves. \nINT. THE PALACE HALLWAY - DAY \nThe Princess hurries up to her husband as he leaves the king's bedroom, and follows him down the hall to his own. \nPRINCESS Is it true? Wallace is captured? \nEDWARD Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation. \nPRINCESS When will his trial be? \nEDWARD Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed. \nWith a faint smile, he shuts his bedroom door in her face. \nINT. ROBERT THE BRUCE'S CASTLE - DAY \nThe Bruce is incredulous, yelling at Craig. \nROBERT Longshanks promised! \nCRAIG You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king. \nPRINCESS I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it! \nOn the verge of hysteria, she presses the vial to the air hole at his mouth and pours in the drug. The jailers, seeing suspicious movement, shift inside the cell; she backs up, her eyes wide, full of love and goodbye. From inside the mask, he watches her go. When the door CLANGS shut, he spits the purple drug out through the mouth hole. \nINT. LONGSHANKS' BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT \nLongshanks lies helpless, his body racked with consumption. \nEdward sits against the wall, watching him die, glee in his eyes. The Princess enters, and marches to the bedside. \nPRINCESS I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace. \nEDWARD You fancy him. \nPRINCESS I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people. \nLongshanks shakes his head. \nPRINCESS Even now, you are incapable of mercy? \nThe king can't speak. But hatred still glows in his eyes. \nThe princess looks at her husband. \nPRINCESS Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love. \nEDWARD Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead. \nShe leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair. The guards flanking the door start forward but the Princess's eyes flare at them with more fire than even Longshanks once showed -- and the guards back off. She leans down and hisses to Longshanks, so softly that even Edward can't hear... \nPRINCESS You see? Death comes to us all. And it comes to William Wallace. But before death comes to you, know this: your blood dies with you. A child who is not of your line grows in my belly. Your son will not sit long on the throne. I swear it. \nShe lets go of the old king. He sags like an empty sack back onto his satin pillows. Without even a look at her husband she strides out of the room, with the rattling breath of the dying king rasping the air like a saw. \nEXT. LONDON TOWN SQUARE - EXECUTION DAY \nThe crowd is festive; hawkers sell roast chickens, and beer from barrels. Royal horsemen arrive, dragging Wallace strapped to a wooden litter. As they cut him loose and lead him through the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him: chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards. \nWe see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek. \nWallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing his soul. The soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest of the crowd jeers more. \nGrim magistrates prod Wallace and he climbs the execution platform. On the platform are a noose, a dissection table with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an enormous axe. Wallace sees it all. \nMAGISTRATE We will use it all before this is over. Or fall to your knees now, declare yourself the king's loyal subject, and beg his mercy, and you shall have it. \nHe emphasizes \"mercy\" by pointing to the axe. Wallace is pale, and trebles -- but he shakes his head. The CROWD grows noisier as they put the noose around Wallace's neck... \nWE INTERCUT: \n-- THE PRINCESS, in helpless agony, hearing the DISTANT NOISE from her room in the palace... \n-- Hamish and Stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd, helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain. \n-- Longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as Edward watches. \n-- Robert the Bruce paces along the walls of his castle in Scotland. His eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered handkerchief that belonged to Wallace. \nON THE EXECUTION STAND \na trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around Wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole. \nCROWD That's it! Stretch him! \nIn the SCORE, AMAZING GRACE, wailed on bagpipes, carries through all that happens now... Ties hand and foot, Wallace is strangling. The Magistrate watches coldly; even when the executioner gives him a look that says they're about to go too far, he prolongs the moment; then the Magistrate nods and the executioner cuts the rope. Wallace slams to the platform; the Magistrate leans to him. \nMAGISTRATE Pleasant, yes? Rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and you will feel no more. \nWith great effort, Wallace rises to his knees. The Magistrate assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak. \nWallace struggles all the way to his feet. \nMAGISTRATE Very well then. Rack him. \nThe executioners slam Wallace onto his back on the table, spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. Goaded by the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. They crowd grows quiet enough to hear the groaning of Wallace's limbs. Hamish and Stephen feel it in their own bodies. \nMAGISTRATE Wonderful, isn't it, that a man remains conscious through such pain. Enough? \nWallace shakes his head. The executioners cut off his clothes, take hot irons from a fire box. The crowd grows silent; we see them, not Wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, but we hear the burning of flesh. Then the Magistrate signals; Wallace wants to say something. \n", "test1_input": "\"BRAVEHEART\" \nby \nRandall Wallace \nEarly Draft \nFADE IN: \nEXT. THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nEpic beauty: cobalt mountains beneath a glowering purple sky fringed with pink, as if the clouds were a lid too small for the earth; a cascading landscape of boulders shrouded in deep green grass; and the blue lochs, reflecting the sky. We hear a voice, husky, Scottish... \nVOICE OVER I will tell you of William Wallace. \nEXT. MACANDREWS FARM - DAY \nA farmhouse and a large barn lie nestled in a Scottish valley. Riding down the roads that lead in from opposite sides are Scottish noblemen in full regalia: eye-popping tartans, sparkling chestplates. Even the horses are draped in scarlet. Behind each nobleman rides a single page boy. \nVOICE OVER Historians from England will say I am a liar. But history is written by those who have hung heroes. \nAnother noble rides in from the opposite side. Two more appear down the road, converging on the barn. \nVOICE OVER The King of Scotland had died without a son, and the king of England, a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks, claimed the throne for himself. Scotland\u0092s nobles fought him, and fought each other, over the crown. So Longshanks invited them to talks of truce. No weapons, one page only. \nThe nobles eye each other cautiously, but the truce holds. \nThey enter the barn, with their pages... \nEXT. SCOTTISH FARM - DAY \nNestled in emerald hills are the thatched roof house and barn and outbuildings of a well-run farm. The farmer, MALCOLM WALLACE, and his nineteen-year-old son JOHN, both strong, tough men, are riding away from the farm. They hear hooves behind them and turn to see a boy riding after them. \nVOICE OVER Among the farmers of that shire was Malcolm Wallace, a commoner, with his own lands and two sons: John... \nWe FAVOR JOHN WALLACE, the nineteen-year-old sitting easily on his horse, beside his father... \nVOICE OVER ...and William. \nWILLIAM, a skinny eight-year-old riding bareback, catches up to his father and older brother. \nFATHER Told ya to stay. \nWILLIAM I finished my chores. Where we goin'? \nFATHER MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit when the truce was over. \nThey ride on, over the lush hills. \nEXT. THE MACANDREWS FARM - DAY \nThe horses are all gone; the place looks deserted. UP ON THE HILL we see the three Wallaces, looking down. \nFATHER Stay here. \nHe means William. He and his elder son spur their horses. \nAT THE BARN - DAY \nThe Wallaces ride up, looking around. \nFATHER MacAndrews!... MacAndrews!? \nMalcolm finds a pitchfork, John the woodpile axe... \nINT. THE BARN \nPOV from within as the door opens and a widening block of sunlight illuminates the dusty shadows. Malcolm and John Wallace step in, and are shocked to see... \nPOV THE WALLACES \nHanging from the rafters of the barn are thirty Scottish noblemen and thirty pages, their faces purple and contorted by the strangulation hanging, their tongues protruding. \nMalcolm stabs the pitchfork into the ground in useless anger; John still grips the axe as he follows his father through the hanging bodies of the noblemen to the back row, to see the one man in commoner's dress, like theirs... \nFATHER MacAndrews. \nA SHUFFLE; John spins; William has entered the back door. \n", "test1_true": "WILLIAM Why would MacAndrews make so many scarecrows? \nBefore his father and brother can think of anything to say, William, with a boy's curiosity, touches the spurred foot of the hanged noblemen we first saw riding in. It's too solid; he takes a real look at the face, and suddenly -- \nWILLIAM R -- real!!!... Ahhhhhgggg!... \nHe turns to run, but knocks back into the feet of the hanged man behind him! In blind panic he darts in another direction, and runs into another corpse, and another; the hanged men begin to swing, making it harder for William's father and older brother to fight their way to him. \nFATHER William! William! \nThen, worst of all, William sees the pages, boys like himself, hanged in a row behind their masters! \nFinally his father and brother reach William and hug him tight. There in the barn, among the swinging bodies of the hanged nobles, Malcolm Wallace grips his sons. \nFATHER Murderin' English bastards. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WALLACE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe cottage looks peaceful, the windows glowing yellow into the night. From outside the house we see John rise and close the shutters of the kitchen, where men are gathered. We PAN UP to the upper bedroom window... \nINSIDE THAT BEDROOM \nYoung William is in nightmarish sleep. He mumbles in smothered terror; he twitches. We see \nHIS NIGHTMARE \nIn the blue-grays of his dream, William stands at the door of the barn, gazing at the hanged knights. We WHIP PAN to their faces, garish, horrible... Then one of the heads moves and its eyes open! William wants to run, but he can't get his body to respond... and the hanging nobleman, his bloated tongue still bursting through his lips, moans... \nGHOUL Will--iam...! \nWILLIAM tears himself from sleep; looking around, swallowing back his tears and panic. \nIN THE KITCHEN \nA dozen strong, tough farmers have huddled. Red-headed CAMPBELL, scarred and missing fingers, is stirred up, while his friend MacCLANNOUGH is reluctant. \nCAMPBELL Wallace is right! We fight 'em! \nMACCLANNOUGH Every nobleman who had any will to fight was at that meeting. \nMALCOLM WALLACE So it's up to us! We show them we won't lie down to be their slaves! \nMACCLANNOUGH We can't beat an army, not with the fifty farmers we can raise! \nMALCOLM WALLACE We don't have to beat 'em, just fight 'em. To show 'em we're not dogs, but men. \nYoung Wallace has snuck down and is eavesdropping from the stairs. He sees his father drip his finger into a jug of whiskey and use the wet finger to draw on the tabletop. \nMALCOLM WALLACE They have a camp here. We attack them at sunset tomorrow. Give us all night to run home. \nEXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY \nMalcolm and John have saddled horses; they are checking the short swords they've tucked into grain sacks when William comes out of the barn with his own horse. \nMALCOLM William, you're staying here. \nWILLIAM I can fight. \nThese words from his youngest son make Malcolm pause, and kneel, to look into William's eyes. \nMALCOLM Aye. But it's our wits that make us men. I love ya, boy. You stay. \nMalcolm and John mount their horses and ride away, leaving William looking forlorn. They wave; he waves back. \nEXT SCOTTISH HILLS, NEAR THE WALLACE FARM - DAY \nIt's strangely quiet, until William and his friend HAMISH CAMPBELL, a red-headed like his father, race up the hillside and duck in among a grove of trees. Breathless, gasping, they press their backs to the tree bark. William peers around a tree, then shrinks back and whispers... \nWILLIAM They're coming! \nHAMISH How many? \nWILLIAM Three, maybe more! \nHAMISH Armed? \nWILLIAM They're English soldiers, ain't they? \n", "test2_input": "WALLACE We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long. \nHAMISH Fourteen? -- \nSENTRY (O.S.) Volunteers coming in! \nThey look to see a half dozen new volunteers being led in, blindfolded. When the guides remove the blindfolds, the new recruits see Wallace and rush to him, bowing. \nRECRUIT (FAUDRON) William Wallace? We have come to fight and die for you! \nWALLACE Stand up, man, I'm not the Pope. \nFAUDRON I am Faudron! My sword is yours! And I brought you this tarta -- \nAs he reaches into his cloak, both Hamish and Campbell instantly draw their swords and put the points to his neck. \nSENTRY We checked them for arms. \nCarefully, Faudron pulls out a beautiful tartan scarf, and replaces Wallace's tattered old one. \nFAUDRON It's your family tartan! My wife wove it with her own hands. \nWALLACE Thank her for me. \nA loud voice interrupts... \nVOICE Him? That can't be William Wallace! I'm prettier than this man! \nThey all look at a slender, handsome young man, STEPHEN, who is talking to himself -- or more accurately, seems to listen to some unheard voice, then answer it... \nSTEPHEN All right, Father, I'll ask him! (to William) If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen? \nHAMISH Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty? \nSTEPHEN In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God. (quickly) Yes, Father!... (to Wallace) The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question. \nCAMPBELL Insane Irish -- \nStephen whips a dagger from his sleeve and puts it at Campbell's throat. \nSTEPHEN Smart enough to get a dagger past your guards, old man. \nWallace jerks his sword to the Irishman's throat, and grins. \nWALLACE That's my friend, Irishman. And the answer's yes. You fight for me, you kill the English. \nStephen grins, and happily tucks away the dagger. \nSTEPHEN Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity. \nHAMISH A common thief. \nSTEPHEN A patriot! \nWallace shakes his head and moves back to the fire, as the sentries take the newcomers to find their own spaces. \nEXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nA column of English light cavalry -- a hundred riders -- moves through the picturesque beauty of the Highlands. \nEnglish LORD DOLECROFT is in command, wearing a hat with a pompous white plume. UP AHEAD, the English SCOUT sees five Scots, including Hamish, walking out of the forest. The Scots run; the Scout rides back to Dolecroft. \nSCOUT Scotsmen, Sire! Headed west! \nDOLECROFT They've blundered at last! After them! \nThe English force charges off. Hamish and his men changed direction but the English spot them crossing a hilltop and ride after them. The Scots run for their lives; the English horses gallop. The Scots run down one slope, up another; the English follow, find their horses stumbling, and see... \nSCOUT We're in a bog! \nDOLECROFT Here, it's firm this way -- \nBut as they move toward the firm ground, fifty Scots appear on the crest of the hill. Hamish leads them, smiling. \nDolecroft wheels and looks to his rear; Wallace appears there, with fifty more, and more Scots appear to the left and right of the English, who are surrounded in the bog. Too late, Dolecroft realizes his blunder. Wallace lifts his broadsword, screams, and leads the charge... \nEXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - DAY \nThe Scots are moving through deep woods; they are laden with the booty they took from the English cavalry: extra weapons, clothing, food -- and one man even wears the late Dolecroft's plumed hat. Wallace is leading them, traveling with his heavy sheathed broadsword across his shoulders. \n", "test2_true": "They collapse to the leaves and loam, greedily squeezing water from sheep belly canteens. \nINT. STIRLING CASTLE - DAY \nLORD PICKERING, English commander, is handed news of the disaster. He reads the message, and pales. \nPICKERING Another ambush! My God! ...What about our infiltrator? \nASSISTANT He has already joined them, M'lord. \nEXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - NIGHT \nThe moon is high above the Scots, encamped for the night. \nMost everyone is sleeping, but William sits leaning against a tree, lost in lonely thoughts. Suddenly William freezes; a shaft of moonlight illuminates a cloaked woman standing twenty feet ahead of him. Something about her is familiar -- and then she pulls off the hood, revealing her auburn hair, cascading in the moonlight... It is Marion! \nWALLACE Marion! Is... is it you? \nJoy explodes on his face, and he runs to her, but stops before he touches her, as if she might evaporate. \nWALLACE I'm dreaming. \nMARION Yes, you are. And you must wake. \nWALLACE I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you. \nMARION And I with you. But you must wake. \nWALLACE I need you so much! I love you! \nMARION Wake up, William. Wake up! \nHAMISH'S VOICE Wake up, William!... \nMARION/HAMISH Wake up!... \nWilliam clutches at Marion, but his arms can't enclose her. \nHE WAKES \nlying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, William's arms clutched empty to his chest. \nHAMISH William! Hounds! \nWallace jumps up, hearing the DISTANT BARKING that alarmed Hamish. Stephen, the new Irish recruit, races up. \nSTEPHEN We must run in different directions! \nHAMISH We don't split up! \nSTEPHEN They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way! \nWALLACE He's right, Hamish! Campbell! Divide them and run! \nShoving groups of men in different directions, Wallace then takes off. His group is about a dozen; they race through the woods, dodging trees, running aimlessly. They stop and listen. The BARKS are getting closer. \nWALLACE Split again! \nAgain they divide, and race in different directions. \nBut no matter how they run and dodge, the BARKS grow nearer. \nWe INTERCUT with the approaching of the dogs -- a large PACK OF HOUNDS, with keepers like on a fox hunt, and behind the dogs, Lord Pickering, with his soldiers, prepared for a long chase, cloaked against the wet darkness, carrying torches. \nWallace and others pause, hear the dogs, and run again, in a new direction. The hounds are relentless. Wallace's group is down to Hamish, Stephen, and Faudron. \nWALLACE No matter how we go, they follow. They have our scent. My scent. \nFAUDRON Run! You must not be caught! \nFaster now, faster. The barks are getting very close. \nWallace and his friends are starting to panic. The blood beats in their ears, their breath scalds their lungs. And we MOVE IN on Wallace's eyes. He stops, gasping. \nSTEPHEN We can't stop! \nWALLACE They've tricked us. \nSTEPHEN What's the crazy man saying, Lord? \n", "test3_input": "WALLACE, WITH STEPHEN \nThey see the Scottish army abandoned. \nSTEPHEN Betrayed! \nWallace glances to the other hilltop; still no sign of Bruce. \nHe looks on in agony as the crossbowmen unleash another volley. The Scottish spearmen, bunched in a tight group, are helpless. The bolts fall, cutting through their helmets and breastplates like paper. Wallace has no cavalry -- and his men are being slaughtered! He spurs his horse, and Stephen and the infantrymen race behind him. \nThe English heavy cavalry surge to meet them, but Wallace weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with the broadsword, cutting down on knight, another, another... \nThe Scottish infantry claws in, dragging down the horses, hacking the knights as they run by. \nThe English bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the armor of Wallace's left shoulder. He wobbles on his horse, regains his balance, and keeps up the charge. \nAT THE ENGLISH COMMAND \nLongshanks and his generals are watching the action. \nGENERAL My God, and still they come! \nLONGSHANKS Use the reinforcements! But take Wallace alive! \nThe General signals and the English reinforcements surge into the battle. \nIN THE THICK OF THE BATTLE \nOn horseback, Wallace fights his way into the watery edge of the field, where English infantry is now overrunning the schiltron. He hacks men down left and right, reaches the Scottish center, and finds Hamish bending over another soldier. Wallace dismounts. \nWALLACE Hamish! Ham -- \nAnd Wallace sees that Hamish is holding his father, fallen in battle. Wallace has no time to react; he cuts down and English swordsman moving in to hack Hamish's back. Wallace lifts Campbell across the saddle, and shouts at Hamish... \nWALLACE Get him away! \nHamish obeys, jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward the rear. Wallace fights with new vengeance, swinging the double-edged broadsword with deadly accuracy. \nRallied by Wallace's presence, the Scots surge back. Then Wallace sees the English reinforcement cavalry coming. \nWALLACE A charge! Form up! Form up! \nThe Scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron. \nThe spears bristle out, ready... the English horsemen thunder in. But before the spears impale the horses, another flight of crossbow bolts cuts down half the Scots still fighting. \nHamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp body of his father to the Scottish monks who are attending to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying... \nStill Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams into him, William also unseats the rider. \nThe rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce. \nThe shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it. \nBruce is horrified at the sight of Wallace this way. He batters at Wallace's sword, as if its use would give him absolution. \nROBERT Fight me! Fight me! \nBut Wallace can only stagger back. Bruce's voice grows ragged as he screams. \nROBERT FIGHT ME! \nAll around, the battle has decayed; the Scots are being slaughtered. Another bolt glances off Wallace's helmet; a third rips into his thigh plate, making his legs collapse. \nSuddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse! \nHe hits Robert from behind, knocking him down, and jumps to the ground to try and lift William onto the horse! \nRobert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up, sighting out Wallace, taking careful aim! Bruce leaps up and helps Stephen sling Wallace onto the back of the horse, even covers him with his shield, deflecting another bolt fired at Wallace, as Stephen mounts too. \nAs the horse plunges away into the smoke, Robert falls to the water. His own troops reach him, realize who he is, see the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the Scots. \nRobert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have died along with his heart. \nLONGSHANKS \nLooks over the battlefield, strewn with the bodies of the Scottish dead. For now, he is satisfied. \nEXT. ROAD - SUNSET \n", "test3_true": "CAMPBELL Son... I want to die on the ground. \nBut as they tilt old Campbell onto the ground, he grabs at something that starts to fall from the wound in his stomach. \nCAMPBELL Whew. That'll clear your sinuses. Goodbye, boys. \nHAMISH No. You're going to live. \nCAMPBELL I don't think I can do without one of those... whatever it is... \nHamish is too grief-stricken to speak. \nWALLACE You... were like my father... \nOld Campbell rallies one more time for this. \nCAMPBELL ...And glad to die, like him... So you could be the men you are. All of ya. \nThe last three words to Hamish, telling him he's a hero too. \nCAMPBELL I'm a happy man. \nHamish is weeping. When he looks up again, his father has died. We PULL BACK from them in tableaux, with the army, the people of Scotland, the whole gray world in defeat. \nINT. EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY \nWallace, still bloody and in his battered armor, removes the chain of office from beneath his breastplate, lays it onto the table in front of Craig and the other nobles, and walks from the room. Hamish and Stephen see the satisfaction on the nobles' face, and follow William out. \nINT. CASTLE CORRIDOR - DAY \nHamish and Stephen move out into the hallway after Wallace -- but he is gone. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nWallace is in the woods, in the grove of trees, looking at Marion's hidden grave. The rain falls on his face, like tears. But he has no tears of his own. The cold, the icy rain, the wounds, nothing seems to touch him. \nWith his fingertips he carefully draws her embroidered cloth from beneath his breastplate; hanging in his trembling hands, filthy with the grime and gore of battle, it looks impossibly white, something from a better, purer world. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PALACE IN LONDON - NIGHT \nThunder, the sound of driving rain. Snug by a massive fire are Longshanks, his son Edward, and other advisors. On the far side of the room, away from the fire, the Princess stands at the window and watches the rain against the panes. \nADVISOR Their nobles have sworn allegiance, M'lord. Every last one. \nLongshanks savors the victory -- and gloats to his son. \nLONGSHANKS Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France. \nEDWARD The Scots will fight for us? \nLONGSHANKS What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve. \nEDWARD But if we have not caught Wallace -- \nLONGSHANKS (exploding) He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower? \nFrom the other side of the window, we see the Princess as she hears him, but doesn't turn around. She looks at the window, we snow swirling among the raindrops outside. Her eyes glisten, and her breath fogs the glass. \nINT. BRUCE'S DARKENED CHAMBER \nThe elder Bruce, his decaying features sagging from his face, stares across the table at his son. \nLEPER I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine. \nROBERT He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won. \nLEPER So more men were slaughtered uselessly! \nROBERT He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight. \nLEPER We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve. \nROBERT In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break. \nLEPER All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make. \nINT. MORNAY'S CASTLE - NIGHT \n"}

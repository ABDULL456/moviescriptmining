{"test1_input": "HAMISH With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm! \nWILLIAM It's up to us, Hamish! \nHamish leans forward for a look, but William pulls him back. \nWILLIAM Not yet! Here he comes, be ready! \nThey wait; heavy FOOTSTEPS. Then from around the edge of the grove three enormous, ugly hogs appear. The boys hurling rotten eggs. The eggs slap the snouts of the pigs, who scatter as the boys charge, howling. We PULL BACK... as the sun goes down on their play. \nEXT. THE WALLACE HOUSE - SUNDOWN \nThe boys walk toward the house, beneath a lavender sky. \nHAMISH Wanna stay with me tonight? \nWILLIAM I wanna have supper waitin'. \nHAMISH We'll get those English pigs tomorrow. \nWILLIAM Aye, we'll get 'em. \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nWilliam's face appears at the window, looking toward \nTHE DISTANT HILLS \nof trees and heather, where there is no sign of life. \nINT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT \nWilliam has cooked stew in a pot, and now spoons up two steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table. But he is only hoping. He looks out the window again; he is still all alone. So he leaves a candle burning on the table beside the stew, and moves up the stairs. \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN \nThe house is silent, fog rolling around it in the dawn. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN \nWilliam has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. He rises, and in QUICK CUTS: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed bed. He moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, also unrumpled. \nIN THE KITCHEN \nHe finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted candle. He spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nWilliam is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the hogs, while he glimpses something coming. \nTHE BOY'S POV \nAn ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers glance up at William, their faces grim... \nFrom his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact. \nCAMPBELL William... Come down here, lad. \nWilliam looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... but the bodies are still there. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nIt's now surrounded by horses, wagons, and neighbors. The undertaker arrives in his hearse. \nINT. THE SHED - DAY \nOn a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes. \nSoftly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work. \nWilliam approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood. \nThe undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the blood. But the wounds remain. \nEXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY \nCLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy, standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken. \nThe local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin. \n", "test1_true": "Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of death and might suck her parents in too. \nPRIEST ...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen. \nWith the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies. \nThe boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand. \nWilliam looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies. \nThen a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, he looks like the grim reaper. \nThe girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, permanently furious. \nPRIEST You must be the relative of the deceased... William, this is your Uncle Argyle. \nArgyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at William. \nWilliam stares up at this frightening figure. They are interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a dozen mounted English soldiers, armed with lances, are approaching. Argyle rattles to the priest... \nARGYLE You were wise to hurry. \nThe soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down from their saddles, haughty, menacing, their LEADER brusque. \nLEADER Someone dead from this household? \nARGYLE We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well? \nLEADER What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away. \nARGYLE My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over. \nLEADER Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds. (to his men) Dig 'em up! \nARGYLE They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it. \nOutmaneuvered, the leader reins his horse away. Several of the farmers spit on the ground. Argyle glares at them. \nARGYLE Funeral's over. Go home. \nINT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT \nWilliam and Argyle are sitting at the table, eating. Argyle has laid out a proper meal, with exact place settings. \nARGYLE Not that spoon, that one's for soup. Dip away from you. And don't slurp. \nArgyle sits down and begins to dine with the boy. \nARGYLE We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors. \nWILLIAM I don't want to leave. \nARGYLE Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened. \nArgyle pushes his food away; he has no appetite now. \nARGYLE Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment? \nWILLIAM It was in Latin, sir. \nARGYLE Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we? (beat) Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et -- (beat) ...It was Malcolm's favorite. \nINT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nArgyle knows nothing about tucking a boy in bed; he stands awkwardly idle as William scrubs his face at the washstand and crawls into bed. \nWILLIAM Good night, Uncle. \nArgyle grunts and starts out. Then he stops, turns back, leans down over William... and with great tenderness the grizzled old uncle kisses his nephew on his hair. \nINT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT \nArgyle sits by the hearth, staring at the embers. He holds the huge broadsword that belonged to his brother. He looks at the handle, like a cross. He whispers... \nARGYLE \"The Lord bless thee and keep thee...\" \nTears of grief spill down the old man's cheeks. \nINT. THE HANGING BARN - IN WILLIAM'S DREAM \n", "test1_id": 1344, "test2_input": "William, Hamish, and Stephen are on their horses, looking down at the road leading into the city. Wallace hands his dagger to Stephen, and unbuckles his broadsword and gives it to Hamish. \nHAMISH Keep these. We're going too. \nWALLACE No. One of us is enough. \nWallace hugs them, first Stephen, then Hamish. Tears roll down Hamish's cheeks. With one last look at his friends, Wallace rides away. \nEXT. LARGE ESTATE HOUSE - SUNSET \nThe house looks quiet as Wallace rides toward it. \nINT. ESTATE HOUSE - DAY \nRobert the Bruce and Craig stand at the hearth, tense. \nCRAIG He won't come. \nROBERT He will. I know he will. \nThey hear the approach of a single horse. The Bruce looks out to see Wallace arriving. \nROBERT Here. And unarmed. My God, he has a brave heart. \nOUTSIDE THE HOUSE \nWallace dismounts and enters. \nINT. THE HOUSE \nWallace appears at the doorway into the main room, and stops. \nBruce faces him. The eyes of BOTH MEN meet, saying everything. Wallace steps into the room. He sees something flicker onto Bruce's face -- shame -- just as henchmen in the rafters drop a weighted net and it envelopes Wallace. \nEnglish soldiers spring from the closets, run down the stairs, and tumble over him, ripping at his clothes, searching as if broadswords might spring from his boots. \nThey bind Wallace hand and foot. He stares at Robert the Bruce, who averts his eyes. The soldiers hurry Wallace out the back, where others are bringing up horses. Robert grabs the English Captain of the soldiers. \nROBERT He is not to be harmed. I have your king's absolute promise that he will be imprisoned only! \nThe Captain looks at Bruce the way the High Priest must have looked at Judas, and leaves. \nCRAIG Now we will have peace. \nRobert the Bruce spots something on the floor that must have fallen from Wallace's clothes as they grabbed him; Bruce lifts the white handkerchief, and sees the familiar thistle embroidered on it. \nEXT. ROAD - NORTHERN ENGLAND - DAY \nA procession of heavily armed English soldiers winds its way toward London, Wallace strapped to an unsaddled horse, his head bare to the sun. Country people come out to jeer... \nPEOPLE Don't look so fearsome, does he?! \nA thrown rock careens off Wallace's check; rotten fruit slaps his shirt. His lips are so parched they bleed. \nINT. ROYAL PALACE - LONGSHANKS' BEDROOM - DAY \nEdward inspects his father, who lies semiconscious in bed, breath rattling ominously in his chest. Edward approves. \nINT. THE PALACE HALLWAY - DAY \nThe Princess hurries up to her husband as he leaves the king's bedroom, and follows him down the hall to his own. \nPRINCESS Is it true? Wallace is captured? \nEDWARD Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation. \nPRINCESS When will his trial be? \nEDWARD Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed. \nWith a faint smile, he shuts his bedroom door in her face. \nINT. ROBERT THE BRUCE'S CASTLE - DAY \nThe Bruce is incredulous, yelling at Craig. \nROBERT Longshanks promised! \nCRAIG You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king. \n", "test2_true": "Wallace stands in medieval restraints worthy of Hannibal Lecter. Before him are six scarlet-robed royal magistrates. \nROYAL MAGISTRATE William Wallace! You stand in taint of high treason. \nWe PUSH IN on the iron mask that binds his face. We can only see his eyes -- but they are bright. \nWALLACE Treason. Against whom? \nMAGISTRATE Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say? \nWALLACE Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king -- \nMAGISTRATE It matters not, he is thy king! \nWALLACE -- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject! \nMAGISTRATE Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?! \nWALLACE I do not confess. \nMAGISTRATE Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe. \nEXT. ESTABLISHING - THE TOWER \nThe stone prison, and the wretched stone section known to this day as the Wallace Tower. \nINT. PRISON - NIGHT \nWallace is alone in his cell, still in the garish restraints. \nWe can only see his eyes, as he prays. \nWALLACE I am so afraid... Give me strength. \nOUTSIDE THE CELL DOOR \nThe jailers jump to their feet as the Princess enters. \nJAILER Your Highness! \nPRINCESS I will see the prisoner. \nJAILER We've orders from the king -- \nPRINCESS The king will be dead in a month! And his son is a weakling! Who do you think will rule this kingdom? Now OPEN THIS DOOR! \nThe jailer obeys. The Princess can barely contain her shock at the sight of Wallace; the jailers snatch him upright. \nJAILER On your feet, you filth! \nPRINCESS Stop! Leave me! (they hesitate) There is no way out of this hell! Leave me with him! \nReluctantly the jailers shuffle out of the cell, but they can still see her back and hear her. Looking at Wallace's eyes through the mask, she can't quite hold back her tears -- dangerous tears, that threaten to say too much. Wallace tries to distract her. \nWALLACE M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger. \nPRINCESS Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy. \nWALLACE Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves? \nPRINCESS Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live. \nWALLACE If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already. \nShe wants to plead, she wants to scream. She can't stop the tears. And the jailers are watching. \nWALLACE Your people are lucky to have a princess so kind that she can grieve at the death of a stranger. \nShe almost goes too far now, pulling closer to him -- but she doesn't care. She whispers, pleading... \nPRINCESS You will die! It will be awful! \nWALLACE Every man dies. Not every man really lives. \nShe pulls out a hidden vial, and whispers... \nPRINCESS Drink this! It will dull your pain. \nWALLACE It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me. \n", "test2_id": 1345, "test3_input": "PRINCESS I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it! \nOn the verge of hysteria, she presses the vial to the air hole at his mouth and pours in the drug. The jailers, seeing suspicious movement, shift inside the cell; she backs up, her eyes wide, full of love and goodbye. From inside the mask, he watches her go. When the door CLANGS shut, he spits the purple drug out through the mouth hole. \nINT. LONGSHANKS' BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT \nLongshanks lies helpless, his body racked with consumption. \nEdward sits against the wall, watching him die, glee in his eyes. The Princess enters, and marches to the bedside. \nPRINCESS I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace. \nEDWARD You fancy him. \nPRINCESS I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people. \nLongshanks shakes his head. \nPRINCESS Even now, you are incapable of mercy? \nThe king can't speak. But hatred still glows in his eyes. \nThe princess looks at her husband. \nPRINCESS Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love. \nEDWARD Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead. \nShe leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair. The guards flanking the door start forward but the Princess's eyes flare at them with more fire than even Longshanks once showed -- and the guards back off. She leans down and hisses to Longshanks, so softly that even Edward can't hear... \nPRINCESS You see? Death comes to us all. And it comes to William Wallace. But before death comes to you, know this: your blood dies with you. A child who is not of your line grows in my belly. Your son will not sit long on the throne. I swear it. \nShe lets go of the old king. He sags like an empty sack back onto his satin pillows. Without even a look at her husband she strides out of the room, with the rattling breath of the dying king rasping the air like a saw. \nEXT. LONDON TOWN SQUARE - EXECUTION DAY \nThe crowd is festive; hawkers sell roast chickens, and beer from barrels. Royal horsemen arrive, dragging Wallace strapped to a wooden litter. As they cut him loose and lead him through the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him: chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards. \nWe see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek. \nWallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing his soul. The soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest of the crowd jeers more. \nGrim magistrates prod Wallace and he climbs the execution platform. On the platform are a noose, a dissection table with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an enormous axe. Wallace sees it all. \nMAGISTRATE We will use it all before this is over. Or fall to your knees now, declare yourself the king's loyal subject, and beg his mercy, and you shall have it. \nHe emphasizes \"mercy\" by pointing to the axe. Wallace is pale, and trebles -- but he shakes his head. The CROWD grows noisier as they put the noose around Wallace's neck... \nWE INTERCUT: \n-- THE PRINCESS, in helpless agony, hearing the DISTANT NOISE from her room in the palace... \n-- Hamish and Stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd, helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain. \n-- Longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as Edward watches. \n-- Robert the Bruce paces along the walls of his castle in Scotland. His eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered handkerchief that belonged to Wallace. \nON THE EXECUTION STAND \na trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around Wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole. \nCROWD That's it! Stretch him! \nIn the SCORE, AMAZING GRACE, wailed on bagpipes, carries through all that happens now... Ties hand and foot, Wallace is strangling. The Magistrate watches coldly; even when the executioner gives him a look that says they're about to go too far, he prolongs the moment; then the Magistrate nods and the executioner cuts the rope. Wallace slams to the platform; the Magistrate leans to him. \nMAGISTRATE Pleasant, yes? Rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and you will feel no more. \nWith great effort, Wallace rises to his knees. The Magistrate assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak. \nWallace struggles all the way to his feet. \nMAGISTRATE Very well then. Rack him. \nThe executioners slam Wallace onto his back on the table, spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. Goaded by the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. They crowd grows quiet enough to hear the groaning of Wallace's limbs. Hamish and Stephen feel it in their own bodies. \nMAGISTRATE Wonderful, isn't it, that a man remains conscious through such pain. Enough? \nWallace shakes his head. The executioners cut off his clothes, take hot irons from a fire box. The crowd grows silent; we see them, not Wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, but we hear the burning of flesh. Then the Magistrate signals; Wallace wants to say something. \n", "test3_true": "Everyone hears; Hamish smiles, even through his tears. \nRebuffed, the Magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift the terrible instruments of dissection. \nWe are spared seeing the cutting: we are ON WALLACE'S FACE as the disembowelment begins. The Magistrate leans in beside him. \nMAGISTRATE It can all end. Right now! Bliss. Peace. Just say it. Cry out. \"Mercy!\" Yes?... Yes? \nThe crowd can't hear the magistrate but they know the procedure, and they goad Wallace, chanting... \nCROWD Mer-cy! Mer-cy! Mer-cy! \nWallace's eyes roll to the magistrate, who signals QUIET! \nMAGISTRATE (booming) The prisoner wishes to say a word! \nSILENCE. Hamish and Stephen weep, whisper, pray... \nHAMISH AND STEPHEN Mercy, William... Say Mercy... \nWallace's eyes flutter, and clear. He fights through the pain, struggles for one last deep breath, and screams... \nWALLACE FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM! \nThe shout RINGS through the town. Hamish hears it. The Princess hears it, at her open window, and touches her tummy, just showing the first signs of her pregnancy. Longshanks and his son seem to hear; the cry STILL ECHOES as if the wind could carry it through the ends of Scotland; and Robert the Bruce, on the walls of his castle, looks up sharply, as if he has heard... \nIN THE LONDON SQUARE \nthe crowd has never seen courage like this; even English strangers begin to weep. The angry, defeated magistrate gives a signal. They cut the ropes, drag Wallace over and put his head on the block. The executioner lifts his huge axe -- and Wallace looks toward the crowd. \nTHE CROWD, WALLACE'S POV \nHe sees Hamish, eyes brimming, face glowing... \nSLOW MOTION - THE AXE \nbegins to drop. \nWALLACE'S POV \nIn the last half-moment of his life, when he has already stepped into the world beyond this one, he glimpses someone standing at Hamish's shoulder. She is beautiful, smiling, serene. \nShe is Marion. \nCUT TO BLACK: \nROBERT THE BRUCE \nHis face has changed. He is standing AT THE OPEN GRAVE WHERE MARION LAY, the headstone carved with the thistle still there. He holds the handkerchief. As he tucks it into his own pocket, and we MOVE IN on his eyes, we realize the VOICE OVER belongs to him. \nROBERT (V.O.) After the beheading, William Wallace's body was torn to pieces. His head was set on London bridge, where passerby were invited to jeer at the man who had caused so much fear in England. (beat) His arms and legs were sent to the four corners of Britain as warning. \nEXT. SCOTTISH TOWNS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY \nWe see the people, as the remains of William Wallace are displayed in a box. The faces of the young men are fiery. \nROBERT (V.O.) It did not have the effect that Longshanks planned. \nMore young men put on tartans, take up their weapons, and gather into fighting units. Among them is Hamish, carrying a shield emblazoned with a cocked arm holding a broadsword, and the words \"For Freedom.\" \nEXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY \nRobert the Bruce, flanked by the noblemen and the banners of the Scottish throne, and backed by a ragtag army of Scots, sits on his horse and looks down at the English generals in their martial finery. The English are haughty, victorious, at the head of their colorful, polished army, awaiting the ceremony of submission from Scotland's new king. \nROBERT (V.O.) And I, Robert the Bruce, backed by a body of Scottish veterans, rode out to pay homage to the armies of the English king, and accept his endorsement of my crown. \nFROM BELOW, ON THE OPEN PLAIN - DAY \nThe Scots -- the remains of William Wallace's army -- look so ragged and defeated that it hardly seems worth the wait. One ENGLISH COMMANDER turns and jokes with another... \nENGLISH COMMANDER I hope you washed your ass this mornin -- it's never been kissed by a king before. \nUP ON THE HILL, Robert the Bruce sits on his horse, and waits. He looks down at the English generals, at their banners, their army. He looks down the ranks at his own. \nHe sees Hamish. Stephen. Old MacClannough is there, his eyes watery, his weapon sharp. The Scottish bride Lord Bottoms took is there, among the ragtag archers, her husband beside her. Robert knows none of them -- yet he knows them all. \nOld Craig, among the other Scottish nobles mounted beside the Bruce, grows impatient. \nCRAIG Come, let's get it over with. \n", "test3_id": 1346}

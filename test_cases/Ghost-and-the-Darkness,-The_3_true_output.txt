CUT TO 
THE BRIDGE up ahead of them. There are some holes. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL slowing. 
CUT TO 
THE HOLES. The nearest one is the largest. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole. 
CUT TO 
THE HOLE. It seems empty. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. One step forward. Another. They hold their breaths. 
CUT TO 
THE HOLE. It seems empty. 
CUT TO 
A SHOT FROM BELOW BRIDGE LEVEL- The Darkness is there. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, firing. 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, going down through another level of scaffolding. 
CUT TO 
PATTRSON AND SAMUEL, trying to track it. 
CUT TO 
THE SCAFFOLDING. Nothing is visible. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL- Frozen. They listen- 
-nothing but their breathing. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, looking around everywhere. 
CUT TO 
THE HOLE. Nothing. 
CUT TO 
THE FIRST LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing. 
CUT TO 
THE SECOND LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing. 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL, looking this way, that way. 
SHOCK CUT TO 
THE HOLE AS THE DARKNESS JUST FUCKING FLIES OUT OF IT- Patterson falls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it gets up and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, turning for Samuel's rifle- 
-only Samuel isn't there- 
-he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS ROARING AND 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON and he turns, starts running too, running across the narrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without slipping or falling and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it takes off after Patterson and 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL, making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the nearest tree and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON running for his life across the bridge and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a dead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary speed, it's still faster than Patterson and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, and he's never gone this fast in his life and 
CUT TO

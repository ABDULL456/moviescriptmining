The bongo player stands. 
ROBERTA You will be the first student who will NOT be in my violin class. Out! 
The child looks stunned. 
ROBERTA I said OUT! 
With a sheepish expression, he exits. The room is finally quiet -- and Roberta's amazed that something worked. She puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control. 
ROBERTA Who else would like to be kicked out of my class? 
The students stare at her, afraid of her now. DE SEAN, a small but tough Black boy, raises his hand. 
ROBERTA Are you raising your hand because you want to be kicked out? 
DE SEAN Yeah. 
ROBERTA Why? 
DE SEAN I don't wanna learn no stupid violin. It's for wimps. 
ROBERTA Who told you that? 
DE SEAN I just know. 
ROBERTA What's your name? 
BOY De Sean. 
ROBERTA Well, De Sean -- you haven't given me a good enough reason, so you're staying. 
She looks around the room. 
ROBERTA Anyone else? 
Silence. 
INT. MUSIC ROOM - LATER 
In front of the class, Roberta helps NAEEM, a graceful Black boy, hold the violin. He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek. Roberta controls the bow and fingerboard, but it appears that the boy is playing music. He smiles. 
NAEEM Hey, I play pretty good. 
Roberta laughs. 
ROBERTA (to Naeem) See how easy it is? (to the class) Maybe in the spring, we could have a big concert for your families and for the whole school. (to the boy) What's your name? 
NAEEM Naeem. 
Roberta writes in a notebook and we see that she's measuring for violin sizes. 
ROBERTA (to class) If you listen to me and do exactly what I say, you're gonna sound beautiful at the concert and you're gonna be so proud of yourselves. (to Naeem) Good, Naeem. Your hand's staying soft. (to the class) But if you don't listen to me, you'll sound so bad that your own parents will feel sick when they hear you. They might even throw up. 
ON THE KIDS, not used to a teacher speaking like that. 
INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A funky apartment on the Upper West Side. Nick and Lexi are both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor, their suitcases nearby. Brian tiptoes past them, carrying two glasses of champagne. He knocks on his office door. 
ROBERTA (O.S.) Come in. 
INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Roberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her hair. She's tidying up her suitcase, etc., next to an old couch that's been made up as a bed. Leftist political books line a shelf above Brian's desk, including copies of his own, TO HELL AND BACK: INTERVIEWS WITH VIETNAM VETS by BRIAN TURNER. His desk is covered with files and books pertaining to MIGRANT WORKERS. Brian enters. 
ROBERTA (referring to champagne) What's this? 
BRIAN It's a toast. (giving her a glass, holding his up) To Roberta, who's made it through her first week. 
They clink glasses and drink. 
ROBERTA I don't know, Brian. I'm hanging on by a thread there. Out of fifty kids, maybe six are listening to me. 
BRIAN Look at the progress. Didn't you say no one was listening to you on Monday? 
Roberta laughs. 
ROBERTA I really appreciate all you've done for us. And I promise -- this weekend I'll start looking for a place. 
BRIAN There's no rush. 
ROBERTA No, we've put you out enough. You're supposed to be writing, not babysitting for us. (crosses to his desk, flips through his Vietnam book) I've started your book. It's very powerful. 
BRIAN Thank you. 
Brian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck. Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening. 
ROBERTA So what made you choose migrant workers for your next book? I mean, how do you know what to write about? 
BRIAN (kissing her neck) I follow my gut, pay attention to what I'm being drawn to...

VALTAN Mona! Where Mona?! And then MONA -- aging actress with fake boobs -- teeters in wearing a flimsy nightgown and six inch heels. 
MONA I'm here! 
VALTAN Okay guys, here scene: Mitch, you enter with gun -- where gun?! A P.A. runs in with a huge MACHINE GUN WITH ROCKET LAUNCHER ATTACHMENT and gives it to Dave, who takes it limply... 
VALTAN (CONT'D) Guard try to stop you, line-line- line, knock him the fuck out, you see Mona asleep in bed, you wake her up and start fuck time, okay? Dave stammers, his head spinning. 
MONA What's my motivation? 
VALTAN Your motivation? Your motivation is show big tit to business traveler in hotel room too scared to order real porno, okay? (blocking the scene) Okay, here shot list: start makeout here, nightgown fall, close-up of titty, candles burning, bouncing titty close-up, moaning, fake sex- in-mouth obscured by hair, more candle, fake backdoor sex obscured by blowing curtain, more candle, her buttock, his buttock, wind blow out candle and finito, okay? 
MONA It's like a poem. 
VALTAN I know, baby, I crush this shit big time. Let's lock it up! 
P. A. Locking it up! As the crew bustle about, Mona turns to a shell-shocked Dave. 
MONA You wanna bump? Mona snorts a fingernail of coke into her nose. 
DAVE A bump--? Of drugs? 
MONA You're cute. But if you try to actually fuck me I'll set your dick on fire with one of these fucking candles, y'understand me? 
DAVE Is this actually happening? 
MONA Pound away on my upper thigh all you want, that's what it's there for, okay? And no, you can't pay me to give you a real BJ, I don't do that shit anymore. Dave's mouth opens, but nothing comes out. A P.A. guides him out of the room. He's still in a trance... 
VALTAN 
ANNNND ACTION: Dave stands there, frozen. Behind the camera, Valtan gestures, go! Dave stumbles into the bedroom, holding the huge machine gun like, well, like a corporate lawyer. A BLOW-DRIED GOON appears with a gun. 
BLOW-DRIED GOON No entry! Dave looks around at the bright lights, the camera, the crew watching him -- and he freezes up. The goon tries again: 
BLOWDRIED GOON I said: No entry! 
Then Dave sees a P.A. waving at him, holding up a huge board with his lines written on them. Shielding his eyes from the lights, Dave reads his lines, monotone: 
DAVE If you let me don't in...don't let me in...If you don't let me in, Paco, I will fuck you dead. That doesn't sound right. If you don't let me Taco-- is his name Paco or Taco? Your penmanship is illegible-- 
VALTAN Fuck it, we fix in post! Just knock out guard, wake up girl, and make fuck time! Keep rolling! 
P.A. Still rolling! Dave very effeminately "karate chops" the goon in the neck once, and the guy dramatically throws himself against the wall and drops, unconscious. Then Dave crosses and pretends to suddenly see Mona in the bed. His acting is atrocious. 
DAVE Oh my goodness it is Lola my long lost lover Lola who...I love. Her. 
VALTAN More sexy! Too stiff! Annnd Mona wake up, surprised! Mona, not much of a better actor than Dave, wakes up -- and SCREAMS deafeningly, like some 1950's horror queen. 
DAVE 
(COVERING EARS) 
HOLY SHIT-- 
MONA Steve Action?! You perfect bastard! 
VALTAN And now kiss her like savage! Dave, totally grossed out by her, very reluctantly leans in for the kiss. Just before their lips meet, he pulls away. 
DAVE I'm sorry! I can't! 
VALTAN 
CUT! CUT. 
(BEYOND PISSED) What the fuck, man?! She ready for first class trip to fuck town! 
DAVE Look, I can't, I'm married. 
VALTAN No no no, Steve Action throw wife off cliff in last scene. 
DAVE No, I mean, me, in real life. I'm married. 
VALTAN So am I! Mona my wife! Yeah, how stupid is that shit, man?! Now go fake-fuck my wife before owners of house come back from ski vacation to find film crew in master bedroom! Dave just stands there, hopelessly out of place...

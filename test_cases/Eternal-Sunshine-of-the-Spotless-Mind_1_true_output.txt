INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT 
Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  It's a jarring transition, visually and emotionally.  Joel is in the midst of some traumatic state of mind. He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches Clementine stack books on shelves.  Her hair is bright orange now. 
JOEL I should maybe talk to you. 
VOICE-OVER Clementine.  I should just maybe talk to her. 
Joel rises and heads toward Clementine. 
JOEL I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened...  I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together.  You'll know everything again and... 
VOICE-OVER Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and... 
Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man approaches Clementine.  Joel stops, watches.  The young man seems out of breath.  He glances over at Joel, then taps Clementine on the shoulder.  She turns, annoyed, sees who it is and her face lights up. 
JOEL Clementine. 
VOICE-OVER That's your look for me. 
Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the ribs. 
PATRICK I just thought I'd say hi.  I was in the neighborhood. 
CLEMENTINE You were not. 
PATRICK I was not. 
Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity.  As he stands there, the scene starts to dry out. Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines.  The bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy. 
CLEMENTINE Come over after I'm done here? 
PATRICK I can't.  I want to, but I have to study. 
CLEMENTINE You rat. 
PATRICK I really want to, but tonight's important.  Test tomorrow. 
JOEL How could she have done this to me?  How could anyone do this to anyone? 
CLEMENTINE (to Patrick) You didn't say anything about my hair. 
PATRICK It's so cool.  You're by far the most sensational person in the room. 
CLEMENTINE In the room? 
PATRICK In the world. 
Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd. 
JOEL What's happening here? (looks at watch; it's 9:30) Oh, God!  I have to go home.  They'll be there soon. 
Joel turns to leave. 
INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT 
Joel drives fast, recklessly.  The intensity is back.  He's weeping as he drives. 
JOEL Gotta get home.  How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other.  What a fuck!  What a fucking monster she is! 
VOICE-OVER Oh, God.  I miss her.  I can't believe she's with that guy now!  I'm never going to see her again.  I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is! 
The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment building, and gets out of the car.  Joel spots the parked van.  We've seen this before, but it's dried out now. 
JOEL Them. 
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY 
Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff. He's been crying.  He looks behind him and finds himself looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on the snowy street.  He turns back to the New York Street and spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY 
Joel sits in the small room with his bags.  A woman across from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap.  Her eyes are red from crying.  Mary, the receptionist, pokes her head through her window into the waiting room. 
MARY Hello again, Mr. Barish.  Good, you've got your stuff. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Joel walks with his bags behind Mary. 
MARY (not looking back) How are you today? (at lab) Here we are. 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
Joel enters.  Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab coat. 
MIERZWIAK Ah, Mr. Barish.  This is Stan.  He'll be in charge of your procedure tonight.

It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV. 
CARSON (OS) Oh, Jesus, those're explosives! (beat) Look at the TV -- this was just taken. 
BACK TO SCENE 
A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does, the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han picks up the phone on his desk. 
JAVAL (VO) (thru phone) There must surely be several people in the room; you may put me on the speakerbox if you wish. 
Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions. 
JAVAL (VO) (continuing; thru speakerbox) I am not a terrorist. Your countries' political posturing means nothing to me. So do not waste time trying to negotiate. (beat) The Federal Reserve Bank of Los Angeles can furnish ten million dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The required denominations are in the instructions, as is the method of packaging. Be in your car at 3:00 PM, and drive north on Highland Avenue. I will call with where to leave the money, which you will do at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will call again at 4:00 with the family's location and the method for removing them from their... predicament. Could you please refer to page one? (they look at the photo) Any deviation from these instructions and my device will fulfill its function at exactly 5:00 PM. 
CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless. Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels. 
AMBASSADOR HAN (to Walther) P'y√öngyang must approve the ransom... 
WALTHER Of course. The FBI's top Hostage Negotiator is on the way -- 
CARSON -- Goddamn Negotiator's the last thing we need! This asshole sound like he was interested in bargaining? 
Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han: 
WALTHER We have people who are experts in these situations. We really feel it would be best if you let them coordinate everything... 
Numb, Ambassador Han nods. 
WALTHER (continuing; to Carson) Let's get on it... 
INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY 
Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter. 
CARSON ...You're gonna just pay up, count on his good nature to return the family?! 
WALTHER It's the President's intention to keep this quiet, move forward with the Summit, and work with the North Koreans. Jesus, you've already embarrassed the shit out of us over the phone surveillance -- 
CARSON -- They know their phones are tapped! They tap our fucking phones! 
WALTHER That's not the point! The point is not acknowledging it! (beat) We got an international incident brewing, with a country we were practically at war with last year! Our best Negotiator is gonna run point. If you got a problem, you can take the goddamn rest of the day off. 
CARSON This Consulate is my responsibility. 
WALTHER Not any more. 
Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching. 
WALTHER (continuing) That's the Negotiator. You do the briefing. 
Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him. 
Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.) 
CARSON ...Our worst enemy'll be the city. There are events gearing up all around town, and a dozen world leaders arriving. Add the Friday rush hour and usual L.A. bad behavior and it'll be a nightmare out there by 3 PM. It all works to the advantage of the kidnapper, hinders our pursuit efforts... (frowns) You don't agree? 
WIDER 
The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson. 
It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over the breast pocket of her jacket. 
MIRANDA I'm wondering whether to believe him when he says he's strictly motivated by money. 
CARSON (grabs faxes back) You see one word of Peoples'- Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about- this-week bullshit in this entire letter? 
MIRANDA I still want to check the MO against known politicals, terrorists -- 
CARSON -- Already doing it. We're coordinating with the Secret Service, the NSA and the CIA. 
MIRANDA Have someone talk to the LAPD, give them a cover story for the media about the crash on La Cienega. 
Walther comes in and looks at Carson. 
WALTHER Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll is your wife?! 
This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee. 
CARSON (while looking at Miranda) If she'd changed her name when we got married, I wouldn't have to. 
MIRANDA (to Carson) I'm so enjoying this opportunity to finally work together... 
WALTHER Jesus, forget I asked. (beat) The cash will be here in an hour. (to Miranda) Any thoughts on the kidnapper's thoughts? 
MIRANDA Everything indicates he's working alone. And his concerns do seem to be solely about the money... so I agree that he's only using the Summit and the tension with North Korea to create extreme motivation to pay the ransom. 
COLONEL LEE I will bring the money to him. 
CARSON My ass.

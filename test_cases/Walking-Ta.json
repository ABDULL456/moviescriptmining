{"train": "WALKING TALL \nWritten by \nMort Briskin & David Klass \nTranscribed by IMSDb \nINTRO \nInspired by a true story. \nWe home in on a boat coming in to shore. Off walks a man, he is carrying a backpack and wearing shades. \nEXT. TOWN \nHe walks through a town, passing various stores and the general bustle of the people there. He notices a baby in a pram left out on the sidewalk, then sees the mother is in an alleyway doing what looks like a drug deal. \nEXT. LUMBER YARD \nChris reads a closure notice on the door. A police car rolls up. \nSHERIFF WATKINS How ya doin'? \nCHRIS Ok. When'd the mill close? \nSHERIFF WATKINS Ahh 3 years this August. If ya lookin for work you might wanna try Aberdeen, that's the closest mill work you're gonna find around here. \nCHRIS That's too bad. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Nah just simple economics. Y'know we have a really nice casino here, the wild cherry. You wanna make some money maybe you wanna go on down there and try your luck at the blackjack tables. \nChris raises his hands and the sheriff chuckles. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Did I scare ya with that one? \nCHRIS Lil bit. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Ya. Let's go. \nINT. POLICE CAR \nSHERIFF WATKINS You were gone a while huh? \nCHRIS 8 years. Harstad was sheriff back then. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Harstad, yeah. Sad story.

THE FAMILY HOME \nCHRIS Thanks for the ride. \nSHERIFF WATKINS No problem, and uh Chris (hands him a piece of paper). It's election month... I'm your man. \nChris takes the paper and smiles. He walks up the lane toward the house, a simple white building clad in wood. A lady dressed in a police uniform comes out. \nMICHELLE Can I help you? \nChris laughs. \nMICHELLE Lil' brother.. You come over here and gimme a hug. \nThey laugh together. \nCONNIE I wish you would have told me you were coming I would've cooked. \nCHRIS This is great. \nMICHELLE So what are you gonna do now that you're home? \nCHRIS Well I was planning on working at the mill, your letters never mentioned that it was closed. \nCONNIE We didn't wanna bother you with our problems when your father got laid off. \nDAD I got my business, you saw the furniture outside. \nCONNIE I substitute at the elementary school, Michelle pitches in. We try to keep things simple. \nA kid walks in. \nMICHELLE Pete! This is your Uncle Chris. \nCHRIS Hey Pete. \nMICHELLE Sit down, say hello. Last time he saw you you were barely walking. \nPETE And now I'm camping. \nMICHELLE I said you could sleep on the couch. It was Chris' room first. \nCHRIS Your tent's gonna take on water.

Jay steps out of his vehicle. \nJAY Cause I opened my Casino. \nCHRIS Still got a gut huh Jay? \nJAY Still got your reflexes. What, you get tired of being all that you can be? \nCHRIS I'm still all I can be. \nJAY Really? I'll just have to see about that. What brings you home? \nCHRIS I just wanna relax, catch my breath. \nJAY You? Relax? \nAnother truck with a few guys on it pulls up \nJAY Not today. \nA football game ensues, there are two teams. Jay's guys vs Chris' guys. On the sidelines Pete pulls up on a small motorcycle. Chris notices Pete hanging around with kids smoking. It comes down to the last play, the teams are huddled into two groups talking. \nRAY If we score here we win right? \nCHRIS Alright boys, last play. We need to put this to rest. \nRAY Just give me the ball. \nCHRIS Don't you have to be native american to own a casino? \nJIMMY Oh Hamilton's one sixteenth black man now. \nFRIEND 2 Just so you guys know, I'm gonna triple my money tonight. \nFRIEND 3 Yea, like last time. Wound up selling your body for bus fare. \nFRIEND 4 He had to walk! \nThey all laugh. \nCHRIS Nobody's gonna have any problems finding this place. \nRAY It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive, blends in with the mountains SO nicely. \nINT. WILD CHERRY CASINO \nThe place is packed with gambling tables and attractive women. \nFRIEND Not bad huh? \nCHRIS Not bad. \nRAY Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling needs under one great big roof. You got your ATM machine, tellers to cash your paycheck, and when you're here you don't gotta worry about those lil things like child support, rent, the laws of mathematical probability. \nWORKER Gentlemen, Mr Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge. \nRAY Oh, 'Mister' Hamilton. \nINT. VIP LOUNGE \nChris puts a load of money on the table. \nCHRIS Bet you I'll roll a seven. \nCROUPIER It's not your roll sir. SIR! It's not your roll.

These dice are comin up seven. \nJIMMY Chris, why don't we just let it go? \nCHRIS No, we gonna let it ride Jimmy. The dice are comin up seven. \nCROUPIER It's not your roll sir. \nChris rolls the dice and sure enough it's a seven. \nCOMMISSIONER No folks, no payout. \nCHRIS (To croupier) Why don't you just take care of that bet and we're even. \nCROUPIER Well I would but it wasn't a legitimate bet, you're not the shooter. It's not your (Chris shoves him) ROLL sir. \nSECURITY GUY Is there a problem? \nCHRIS Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded. Does your boss know about this? Just gimme my money. \nThe security guy grabs Chris around the neck. Chris elbows him and throws him onto the table. The croupier takes a fighting stance. Jimmy taps Chris on the shoulder. \nJIMMY Come on, let's go! let's go! \nMICHELLE Oh come on you need to be out arresting whoever tried to kill my brother not testing his BLOOD. \nSHERIFF WATKINS I'm just doing my job Michelle. Ok? I understand how you feel. But we still don't know yet who started all of this. \nCONNIE Well it wasn't Chris. \nDAD Just find out who did this to him Stan. \nSHERIFF WATKINS I'll do my best Mr Vaughn. I really will.

First of all I wanna say thanks. \nCHRIS For what? \nJAY He's been fired, and his gaming permit's been pulled. I don't know how my security cameras didn't catch that. \nJay starts to help Chris taking wood off the truck but Chris throws it back on. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Well hey Chris. Good to see you up and about, you're lookin spiffy. \nCHRIS I'm here to press charges. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Well this isn't about that incident at the casino a while back is it? \nCHRIS Yea, it is. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Cause that matter's closed. \nCHRIS Did you look into it? \nSHERIFF WATKINS They did an internal investigation. That's good enough for me. \nCHRIS An internal investigation. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Chris, I know you're familiar with the term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's what the casino is.

He finds Jay sitting. \nJAY Hey Chris. \nCHRIS Get up Jay. \nJAY Just a sec.

Chris listen to me. If you go outta here with that gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris! \nChris drives to the casino, he cocks the shotgun but decides to leave it in the truck. Instead he takes a piece of wood from the back of his truck. He enters the casino with it. He smashes a fruit machine. A guard comes up and Chris beats him. A fight scene breaks out with Chris beating the guards and generally trashing the place. He takes back his special forces dogtag from the guard who stole it. Chris hurls his piece of wood at the VIP lounge window, smashing it to pieces. Jay emerges from behind it. \nJAY Guess that changes our relationship a bit huh? \nChris leaves.

Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now Chris! NOW! \nINT. POLICE STATION ROOM \nLAWYER I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought. If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years. This is a sweet plea, normally they wouldn't even put it on the table but your military record can't be ignored. Three months home arrest, some community service. Pretty generous offer Chris. \nCHRIS But I'd have to plead guilty. \nLAWYER Look at it from the other side. There's over a dozen witnesses, none of em are gonna paint a very flattering picture. \nWe see a montage of casino workers badmouthing Chris. \n", "test2_true": "GIRL There was a gunshot.. \nWORKER Went crazy... \nGIRL Complete psychopath. \nCHRIS They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet. \nLAWYER Well I still say you should take it. \nCHRIS I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was. \nINT. COURTROOM \nCASINO GUARD Our job is to keep order. But there was no chance of that. Me and my men we were just tryin to control him. He was highly trained, violent, very dangerous person. \nPROSECUTOR So dangerous, so violent, so highly trained that he despatched six of the casino staff single handedly. His weapon of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which in his hand became a devastating force with one aim, to hurt people, destroy property. \nWORKER He went directly for everything. He just came in and took over the place. \nPROSECUTOR You said he broke your arm. \nWORKER Yea that's correct, my right forearm. Both bones with a single shot. It was crazy. \nCASINO GUARD 2 You know, toss out a coupla drunks now and then. Guys try to grope the girls, but ah nothing with this sort of violence. \nPROSECUTOR Did he give you any kind of advanced warning? A chance to defend yourself. \nCASINO GUARD 2 We tussled, but he's a big guy. He was on a mission. Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see. \nPROSECUTOR So from what you saw, it seemed like he had some kinda purpose? \n", "test3_input": "RAY Oh now you're a CROOKED cop doing favours for friends. That's how it starts. See next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks, frisking dudes crotches. \nCHRIS Are you done? Ray I need your help. \nRAY Oh don't do that. \nCHRIS I need you to take me to drugs school. \nRAY I get to wear a uniform? \nA montage ensues, with Chris and Ray busting various drug dealers. \nEXT.

FAMILY HOUSE \nChris is in the room with a shotgun. \nDAD Why does it always have to be your fight? \nCHRIS You might need this. \nDAD No. I put my guns down a long time ago. \nCHRIS You're just being stubborn. \nDAD You and me both boy. Chris, listen. You be careful. \nCHRIS I will. \nINT. POLICE STATION \nBooth is locked up, Ray is taunting him through a loudspeaker. \nRAY Please step away from the vehicle. Now Mr Booth are you still upset over that body cavity search? WOOOOOOOO! I forgot, you got no vehicle. Please disperse, there is nothing to s... \nChris has walked in. \n"}

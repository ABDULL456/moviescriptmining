{"train": "WALKING TALL \nWritten by \nMort Briskin & David Klass \nTranscribed by IMSDb \nINTRO \nInspired by a true story. \nWe home in on a boat coming in to shore. Off walks a man, he is carrying a backpack and wearing shades. \nEXT. TOWN \nHe walks through a town, passing various stores and the general bustle of the people there. He notices a baby in a pram left out on the sidewalk, then sees the mother is in an alleyway doing what looks like a drug deal. \nEXT. LUMBER YARD \nChris reads a closure notice on the door. A police car rolls up. \nSHERIFF WATKINS How ya doin'? \nCHRIS Ok. When'd the mill close? \nSHERIFF WATKINS Ahh 3 years this August. If ya lookin for work you might wanna try Aberdeen, that's the closest mill work you're gonna find around here. \nCHRIS That's too bad. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Nah just simple economics. Y'know we have a really nice casino here, the wild cherry. You wanna make some money maybe you wanna go on down there and try your luck at the blackjack tables. \nChris raises his hands and the sheriff chuckles. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Did I scare ya with that one? \nCHRIS Lil bit. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Ya. Let's go. \nINT. POLICE CAR \nSHERIFF WATKINS You were gone a while huh? \nCHRIS 8 years. Harstad was sheriff back then. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Harstad, yeah. Sad story. About 5 months back he fell asleep at the wheel and uhhh... hit a tree. Good man, good man and a good sheriff. \nEXT. THE FAMILY HOME \nCHRIS Thanks for the ride. \nSHERIFF WATKINS No problem, and uh Chris (hands him a piece of paper). It's election month... I'm your man. \nChris takes the paper and smiles. He walks up the lane toward the house, a simple white building clad in wood. A lady dressed in a police uniform comes out. \nMICHELLE Can I help you? \nChris laughs. \nMICHELLE Lil' brother.. You come over here and gimme a hug. \nThey laugh together. \nCONNIE I wish you would have told me you were coming I would've cooked. \nCHRIS This is great. \nMICHELLE So what are you gonna do now that you're home? \nCHRIS Well I was planning on working at the mill, your letters never mentioned that it was closed. \nCONNIE We didn't wanna bother you with our problems when your father got laid off. \nDAD I got my business, you saw the furniture outside. \nCONNIE I substitute at the elementary school, Michelle pitches in. We try to keep things simple. \nA kid walks in. \nMICHELLE Pete! This is your Uncle Chris. \nCHRIS Hey Pete. \nMICHELLE Sit down, say hello. Last time he saw you you were barely walking. \nPETE And now I'm camping. \nMICHELLE I said you could sleep on the couch. It was Chris' room first. \nCHRIS Your tent's gonna take on water. I could show ya how to rig it. \nPETE Doesn't look like it's gonna rain to me Colonel. \nMICHELLE Pete, cmon sit down, have somethin to eat. \nPete looks at him. \nCHRIS Ok, I'll crash on the floor, you crash on the bed. \nPETE uh uh. (starts walking out) \nCHRIS Pete. (hands him a towel). Keep ya dry. \nPETE Did you really kill people? \nChris looks at him. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE \nA crappy camper van rolls up. A man steps out. \nCHRIS Ray Ray! Ahaaa. \nRAY Hello puddin'. \nThey hug. \nCHRIS How ya doin? \nRAY I'm alright. \nCHRIS What is that? (points to the van) \nRAY That's the lovemachine. \nCHRIS Girls actually get in there? \nJIMMY His parents hadn't left him the mill more than 2 minutes before he shut it down. \nCHRIS Why? \na voice shouts 'HEADS UP' Chris catches a fast ball thrown from behind. Jay steps out of his vehicle. \nJAY Cause I opened my Casino. \nCHRIS Still got a gut huh Jay? \nJAY Still got your reflexes. What, you get tired of being all that you can be? \nCHRIS I'm still all I can be. \nJAY Really? I'll just have to see about that. What brings you home? \nCHRIS I just wanna relax, catch my breath. \nJAY You? Relax? \nAnother truck with a few guys on it pulls up \nJAY Not today. \nA football game ensues, there are two teams. Jay's guys vs Chris' guys. On the sidelines Pete pulls up on a small motorcycle. Chris notices Pete hanging around with kids smoking. It comes down to the last play, the teams are huddled into two groups talking. \nRAY If we score here we win right? \nCHRIS Alright boys, last play. We need to put this to rest. \nRAY Just give me the ball. \nSTRIPPER So you've seen all the old faces. \nCHRIS Could say that. \nSTRIPPER Your voice sounds very familiar. \nThe lights come on. \nSTRIPPER Chris... \nCHRIS Deni.. \nThe screen goes down again, Chris leaves the booth. \nINT. CASINO \nFRIEND 1 Look who's back. \nFRIEND 2 So, good surprise? \nFRIEND 1 Told you it was better than gambling. You met Candy? (A girl is dancing on their table) \nCHRIS Hey Candy. (to the guys) Let's go. \nINT. CRAPS TABLE \nCROUPIER 6! Easy 6 for a win! \nJIMMY (To some girls) We can do a 6. \nJIMMY (To Chris) We're gettin killed out here. I need you to put 200 down for the bet. \nChris puts a load of money on the table. \nCHRIS Bet you I'll roll a seven. \nCROUPIER It's not your roll sir. SIR! It's not your roll. Call security. \nChris has taken the dice. \nCHRIS Put your bets down on the pass line. These dice are comin up seven. \nJIMMY Chris, why don't we just let it go? \nCHRIS No, we gonna let it ride Jimmy. The dice are comin up seven. \nCROUPIER It's not your roll sir. \nChris rolls the dice and sure enough it's a seven. \nCOMMISSIONER No folks, no payout. \nCHRIS (To croupier) Why don't you just take care of that bet and we're even. \nCROUPIER Well I would but it wasn't a legitimate bet, you're not the shooter. It's not your (Chris shoves him) ROLL sir. \nSECURITY GUY Is there a problem? \nCHRIS Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded. Does your boss know about this? Just gimme my money. \nThe security guy grabs Chris around the neck. Chris elbows him and throws him onto the table. The croupier takes a fighting stance. Jimmy taps Chris on the shoulder. \nJIMMY Come on, let's go! let's go! \nMICHELLE Oh come on you need to be out arresting whoever tried to kill my brother not testing his BLOOD. \nSHERIFF WATKINS I'm just doing my job Michelle. Ok? I understand how you feel. But we still don't know yet who started all of this. \nCONNIE Well it wasn't Chris. \nDAD Just find out who did this to him Stan. \nSHERIFF WATKINS I'll do my best Mr Vaughn. I really will.

CAR \nDAD Ya whole life, all you wanted to do was get outta here. What made you come back. \nCHRIS You gonna think I'm crazy. I been thinking about the mill. When I was a kid goin to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar. You remember that smell. \nDAD Mmm I remember a lotta nice things before the mill closed. \nCHRIS When did they go outta business? (Nods to a closed supply store). \nDAD Closed about six months ago. There's a home depot about fifteen minutes up the road. \nCHRIS And that? (Nods to an adult XXX shop) \nDAD Don't ask. \nThey laugh. \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE \nJay pulls up in his car. \nJAY Hey. First of all I wanna say thanks. \nCHRIS For what? \nJAY He's been fired, and his gaming permit's been pulled. I don't know how my security cameras didn't catch that. \nJay starts to help Chris taking wood off the truck but Chris throws it back on. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Well hey Chris. Good to see you up and about, you're lookin spiffy. \nCHRIS I'm here to press charges. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Well this isn't about that incident at the casino a while back is it? \nCHRIS Yea, it is. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Cause that matter's closed. \nCHRIS Did you look into it? \nSHERIFF WATKINS They did an internal investigation. That's good enough for me. \nCHRIS An internal investigation. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Chris, I know you're familiar with the term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's what the casino is. Since the mill closed down that casino is the main source of revenue in this town. So, case closed basically. I'll see ya. \nCHRIS I'm not gonna let this stand. \nSHERIFF WATKINS Excuse me? What did you say to me? \nCHRIS I said I'm not gonna let this stand. \nSHERIFF WATKINS You're lucky to be alive right now, that's all you need to be concentrating on. This is my town ok, I'm the sheriff here. I'll tell you what will stand, not the other way around. Now please get out of my building. \nINT. FAMILY HOUSE \nDeni is at the door. \nDENI Hey. \nDENI I have my moments. \nCHRIS So the casino huh? \nDENI Yep. Been there almost a year. \nCHRIS Treatin you good? \nDENI Lot better than it treated you. \nCHRIS I like that. Jay Hamilton's done well for himself hasn't he. \nDENI Yea, he's a real go-getter that one. \nCHRIS Must be. I heard he got you. \nDENI Lasted about 8 minutes, a long long time ago. \nCHRIS You still work for him though. \nDENI Rent's gotta be paid Chris. \nCHRIS Suppose so. \nDENI Hope to see you around. \nCHRIS Do you? \nShe begins to drive off. \nCHRIS Thanks for the jacket. \nChris speeds off. He pulls up at their home and enters the garage. \nDAD Is Pete ok? \nCHRIS He'll be fine. \nChris is searching about and forces open a cupboard. \nDAD What are you doin? \nChris pulls out a shotgun and loads it. \nDAD Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen to me. If you go outta here with that gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris! \nChris drives to the casino, he cocks the shotgun but decides to leave it in the truck. Instead he takes a piece of wood from the back of his truck. He enters the casino with it. He smashes a fruit machine. A guard comes up and Chris beats him. A fight scene breaks out with Chris beating the guards and generally trashing the place. He takes back his special forces dogtag from the guard who stole it. Chris hurls his piece of wood at the VIP lounge window, smashing it to pieces. Jay emerges from behind it. \nJAY Guess that changes our relationship a bit huh? \nChris leaves. As he drives off in his truck, police cars appear with sirens going. He pulls over. \nSHERIFF WATKINS You should NOT have come looking for trouble. Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now Chris! NOW! \nINT. POLICE STATION ROOM \nLAWYER I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought. If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years. This is a sweet plea, normally they wouldn't even put it on the table but your military record can't be ignored. Three months home arrest, some community service. Pretty generous offer Chris. \nCHRIS But I'd have to plead guilty. \nLAWYER Look at it from the other side. There's over a dozen witnesses, none of em are gonna paint a very flattering picture. \nWe see a montage of casino workers badmouthing Chris. \nCHRIS Watkins. \nWATKINS Well you won the election, congratulations. We do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here, and I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men. They're good deputies. \nCHRIS You're all fired. \nINT. POLICE STATION \nChris takes a look around. \nEXT. A COUNTRY ROAD \nJay is speeding along in a sportscar. He is pulled over by a police truck. \nJAY Hey Chris. \nCHRIS License and registration please. \nJAY You're joking right? \nCHRIS License and registration. \nJay hands it over. \nJAY What's the problem sheriff? \nCHRIS You. And the drugs you're pedalling out of your casino. \nJAY Oh. Only thing that's going on in my casino right now is reconstruction. You took care of that. \nCHRIS Yea that's right and I plan on taking care of everything else too. \nRAY Oh now you're a CROOKED cop doing favours for friends. That's how it starts. See next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks, frisking dudes crotches. \nCHRIS Are you done? Ray I need your help. \nRAY Oh don't do that. \nCHRIS I need you to take me to drugs school. \nRAY I get to wear a uniform? \nA montage ensues, with Chris and Ray busting various drug dealers. \nEXT. DEALER'S HOUSE \nCHRIS You're SURE you're not carrying anything. \nBOOTH I don't have shit. \nCHRIS Officer. \nRAY Yeah. \nCHRIS Search him. \nRAY Oh. Spread your legs, arms down. Been workin out? Nothin there. Ohhhh somebody needs a BATH! \nBOOTH Now you read me my rights and take me in. And I call my lawyer. \nRAY K.

I need you to take care of my parent's place. \nRAY You think they're gonna take it that far? \nChris hands him the shotgun. \nRAY I'm with you man, I'll check in later. \nCHRIS Kay. \nNIGHT TIME \nDeni comes into the police station. \nDENI Don't shoot. \nCHRIS Hey \nDENI Hi. How's the food around here? Brought you special treats. Salmon, Fried Chicken, Potato Salad. You got cups? \nCHRIS Don't you have to work tonight? \nDENI Hmm I quit. I figured you know, you were making some changes around here, I could make a few myself. \nCHRIS What's it worth to you? Where's the lab? \nBOOTH Screw you! \nGunshots hit near booth. \nBOOTH Ok! Ok! Hamilton's operation is at the mill ok! It's at the mill now get me outta here. \nINT. FAMILY HOUSE \nThe gunman enters a room, Ray is there pointing a shotgun at him. \nRAY Drop it! \nINT. POLICE STATION \nCHRIS Stay down! \nBooth is standing and gets shot dead. \nINT. FAMILY HOUSE \nRay shoots the gunman, who falls to the floor. \nUPSTAIRS \nMICHELLE Ray! \nGUNMAN 2 Stay down! \nINT. POLICE STATION \nThe injured gunman from the kitchen appears brandishing a pistol. \nGUNMAN You stabbed me... with a potato peeler?? \nChris and Ray hold up their hands. He aims at Ray but he's shot in the back of the head by Dad who is approaching down the stairs. \nCHRIS You gonna be ok? \nDad nods. \nEXT. THE MILL \nChris is in a police car driving at speed. He approaches the mill and busts through the locked gates. \nINT. THE MILL \nThe mill is dark, Chris is finding his way around using a torch. He finds Jay sitting. \nJAY Hey Chris. \nCHRIS Get up Jay. \nJAY Just a sec. Remember we used to play hide n seek up here? \nJay hits a metal saw which resonates making a metallic sound. \nJAY That was my favourite sound. \nCHRIS Get up! \nJay stands up and holds up his hands. \n", "test1_input": "CHRIS Don't you have to be native american to own a casino? \nJIMMY Oh Hamilton's one sixteenth black man now. \nFRIEND 2 Just so you guys know, I'm gonna triple my money tonight. \nFRIEND 3 Yea, like last time.

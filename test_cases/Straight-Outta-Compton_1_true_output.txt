Establish MANHATTAN, in winter, after hours. Dirty snow on the sidewalks. Cold-as-shit wind blowing off the Hudson. A line of CLUB KIDS on the 12th Avenue sidewalk, in front of the massive brick edifice of the legendary -- 
118   INT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - VIP - NIGHT                      118 
ICE CUBE sits in a BOOTH, surrounded by friends, label-execs, and hangers-on. It's pretty clear that Cube is a huge celebrity at this point. He even has some big, unsmiling THUGS (The Lench Mob) standing close. 
Cube, mid-conversation, suddenly STOPS talking... Because he SEES that EAZY-E is entering the VIP with 2 HUGE SAMOANS, making his way over. 
CUBE (to his crew) Heads up y'all. This lil nigga might wanna do something. 
Cube stands up -- ready for whatever. 
Eazy and his Bodyguards arrives at the booth. There's a tense silence -- almost a stand off before anyone speaks. Everybody looks to them, seeing how they're gonna react. After all, these two have dissed each other, ferociously and publicly, for years. Still, Eazy gives Cube a friendly, vaguely submissive smile. 
EAZY Relax everybody. Just came in the club-- heard you were over here. 
CUBE (Still ready) Yeah. I'm over here. (beat) What you need? 
EAZY I don't need shit. Out here with Bone Thugs-- Was just in the neighborhood. Wanted to say wassup. 
The tension between the sides eases up a bit, but not completely. They both stand there, neither sure what to say to the other. 
EAZY (CONT'D) Saw your movie. It was good. 
Cube slowly smiles. Knows that wasn't easy for Eazy. 
CUBE Thought you said it was an after- school special. 
They both smile, laugh. Give each other a pound. In truth, they missed each other. Homie hug. 
EAZY Missed you, boy. 
CUBE Missed you too, E. Wish we could've work shit out. 
EAZY Guess it all happened like it was supposed to. You a movie star-- I'm a music mogul. Dre. Well Dre is tripping right now, but he's doing his thang. Just wanted to come over here and put something on your mind.. 
Cube is curious. 
119   INT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - VIP - AFTER HOURS                119 
The club has mostly emptied out. Only a few die-hards remain as we find Cube and Eazy slumped over their table, loose with alcohol. The vibe is cool, friendly, like the old days. But we notice Eazy has a subtle, persistent COUGH... 
EAZY I wish all that bullshit never happen between us. (MORE) 
EAZY (CONT'D) Definitely never wanted it to get physical-- we should've kept it on wax. 
CUBE Never should've dissed each other in the first place. Made our fans choice between us. That ain't cool. 
EAZY Yeah you right. (After a few beats) Ever though we was going to be this big? 
CUBE Nope. I was reminiscing with my wife the other day. What it felt like-- In the beginning. We were so young and ferocious. Doing music straight for the hood. Trying to be ghetto stars... I thought I knew everything back then -- But I didn't know shit. 
EAZY Me neither. I'm still trying to figure this stuff out. One minute I'm slangin' in a crack house -- next thing I know, they invite me to the White House. 
Cube laughs, shakes his head. 
CUBE Yeah. I get it. Everything changes so fast. Feels like it was 20 years ago. If we were still together do you know how large we'd be? 
They both sit there, thinking about that shit, amazed. 
EAZY You ever think about fuckin' with some new NWA shit? 
Cube frowns, contemplates for a moment. 
CUBE I'd be lyin' if I said I never thought about it. 
Eazy's eyes flash. That's what he was hoping to hear. 
EAZY Me too, Cube. Been thinkin' about it a lot. (beat) Be like 1989 again. We changed the world forever. Mothafuckas can never go back to that fake shit after us. It gets no realer then NWA. No matter what... 
After a quick thought. 
CUBE If you can get Dre to do it, I'm in. But check this out homie-- I ain't doin' it if Jerry's around. He done made enough off us. 
EAZY I hear you. 
An EMPLOYEE walks by, pushing a broom, glaring at them. It's time to go. They both stand up. 
CUBE Cool. We done talked til the damn club closed -- I got a car coming. You need a ride back to your hotel? 
EAZY Naw, I'm cool. I wanna walk. 
CUBE (really?) Walk? It's cold as fuck Eric, this ain't L.A. 
EAZY I'm good. Hit me up later. 
Another HUG, this one last a little longer then normal. Eazy doesn't say anything else. Just heads for the exit, without looking back. Cube watches him go off into the cold night... 
120   EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT                            120 
Eazy walks back to his hotel in the freezing cold, his hands jammed in his pockets. The wind blows mercilessly. Eazy is shivering like crazy. But he keeps walking. 
It's a longer walk than he thought. He tries to hail a cab, but of course, none stop. He keeps trudging along, his breath making clouds, through the lonesome pre-dawn City -- 
121   EXT. JAIL - DAY                                             121 
Dre emerges from the JAIL, shielding his eyes from the suddenly-blinding SUNSHINE. Interestingly, this is the SECOND TIME we've seen him get picked up from jail. 
NICOLE is there, waiting by her car. He wraps her in his arms, and they stand that way, together, for a long time.

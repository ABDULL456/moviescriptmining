She knows.  He trails off.  Sue looks at him. 
REED (CONT'D) You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted. 
SUE I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted you to be that man. 
Someone SHUSHES them.  They slump down further.  Closer. 
SUE (CONT'D) When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me. 
REED Why didn't you say something? 
SUE That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed... (closer, emotional) I'm saying it now. 
Their eyes lock.  A heated beat.  No more secrets.  Their faces are close.  A kiss is coming.  Closer, closer.  Sue disappears. 
SUE (CONT'D) (quiet, playful) Come find me. 
Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and... 
SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D) That's my nose, genius... These are my lips. 
Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible hands.  She pulls him into a KISS.  Lips touch.  Soft, tender.  Stars twinkle.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO -- 
EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT 
Ben and Alicia step out together.  The crowd quiets, turns. A few whispers flutter.  Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips her arm into his.  The party goes back to normal. 
ALICIA Look around.  I'll get us drinks. They always let blind girls cut the line. 
She walks off.  He watches her go.  The way her hair moves. The lines of her neck.  The light on her skin.  This woman is the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.  He's falling hard. 
Ben steps through the crowd.  The swanky guests give strained smiles, polite.  Ben is starting to feel comfortable here. He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests. 
Ben hangs back, happy to watch her.  A few patrons pass him, thinking he's just an inanimate statue. 
PATRON I don't know about this one.  It lacks a certain...realism. 
Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia.  He overhears two BOHEMIAN GIRLS, who assume he's a statue. 
BOHEMIAN GIRL #1 She's always had a thing for runaways and strays, but this is ridiculous. 
BOHEMIAN GIRL #2 I know.  Did she really think these sculptures would sell? 
BOHEMIAN GIRL #1 Like anybody would want this thing in their house.  That girl's a one-woman charity. 
Ben just stands there, frozen.  His eyes dart around the room, paranoid now.  Aware of people staring, laughing.  He glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.  Now it's damning. 
We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging where she left Ben.  She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for him.  But Ben is gone.  She looks disappointed, hearing his heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance. 
THUNDER booms on the CUT TO -- 
EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT 
A pitstop in Queens.  Heavy RAIN swims down windows.  BEN sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. Nobody sits within four chairs of him.  He sips coffee in a metal bowl.  A long beat.  Then... 
VICTOR (O.S.) This seat taken? 
Ben turns to see...VICTOR. 
BEN What are you doing here? 
VICTOR I'm worried about you. 
BEN About me?  How sweet. 
VICTOR Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company. 
Ben considers.  A man deeply alone.  A beat. 
INT. DINER - LATER 
Victor and Ben sit in a window booth.  A waitress sets a foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge plates he's just cleared.  Victor's aware of the other customers in the diner staring at Ben.  Ben burps: it rattles the plates. 
THE THING 'Scuse me. 
VICTOR I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back... 
THE THING If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job -- 
VICTOR I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back. 
The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth. 
THE THING Reed's gonna fix me up -- 
VICTOR For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical. 
THE THING Skeptical...? 
Ben doesn't trust him.  But Victor is hitting pressure points. 
VICTOR Look, he's a brilliant man, we should trust he's working as hard as he can. You're his best friend.  So what possible reason could he have for taking his time? (a beat) I mean, other than getting close to Sue? 
Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  He can't help but find truth in the words.  And we CUT TO --

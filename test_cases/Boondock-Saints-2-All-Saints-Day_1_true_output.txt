DOLLY Game time.   How are we playing this? 
DUFFY Feds love to pull the divide and conquer routine. We hard line her. Stick together on this. Agreed? 
DOLLY Agreed.   We're a brick wall. 
They all nod and stiffen their resolve. 
GREENLY Let's rock this bitch. 
Rockin' music fades in as a uniform opens the squad door. 
SLO-MO:   EUNICE BLOOM (32yrs) exits the squad and moves toward. 
She is simply delicious: sexy, blonde hair, a woman's business suit, short skirt, brass rimmed specs. Each detective's face drops. Soon she is before them. Music cuts. She smiles and speaks with a southern drawl a la Doc Holiday. 
EUNICE 
(POINTING) You hafta be Detectives Dolly and Duffy. Am I right? (extending hand) Eunice Bloom. A pleasure. 
Dolly and Duffy shake and manage a nod.    Greenly is still enamored. 
EUNICE (CONT'D) And you must be Greenly. Smecker always said you were the funny one. 
GREENLY T'sup...I mean, what? Yeah, well, funny as in ha ha, though not like funny as in gay cuz...I'm not...played high school football. 
She chuckles.   Dolly and Duffy fume. 
DOLLY Look, with all due respect, Agent Bloom... 
EUNICE Special. 
DOLLY Excuse me? 
EUNICE You see there's a "special" before my "agent." If we are going to address each other formally, I'd prefer if you popped it in there. Makes me feel, I don't know...special. Of course, I'd hoped we could be a little more personable. In fact, I'd like you to call me Eunice. 
The cops are dumbfounded.      Duffy snaps out of it. 
DUFFY O'kay, Eunice. I don't see why the fuck the Fed is... 
EUNICE Whoa, whoa, "fuck?" This isn't a "fuck" situation, is it? I can see a "God Damn" or two but why skip all the way to "fuck" right off the bat? Let's start slow and work our way up to it. 
DUFFY What is the Fed's interest in this? The detectives harden, brick wall.     Eunice furrows her brow. 
EUNICE Their interest, Detective, is capturing the men responsible for the murders of 22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see public perception is that these boys stepped in, did our jobs for us and then disappeared into thin air as we fecklessly searched for them. The FBI tends to take exception to such things. They coulda sent anyone. They sent me. Why do you think that is? 
(BEAT) Well, since we've broken the "Fuck Barrier," allow me to be blunt. 
(MORE) 
EUNICE (CONT'D) It is because I am so fucking smart that I make smart people feel like retards. Now, we seem to be getting off on the wrong foot here. I'd appreciate a bit of cooperation. Let's chalk it up to paying respect to the memory of a dearly departed mutual friend. A man who taught me everything I know. 
After a moment of consideration, the cops concede with nods. 
EUNICE (CONT'D) Lovely. (re: crowd) Now what's with the circus? 
DUFFY The victim was killed late last night. When people gathered for morning mass, they found the front entrance chained and padlocked. A locksmith came out, cut the chain and surprise, surprise. Cell phones. Half of them called the cops. Half of them called the media. But regardless...word's out. 
Eunice turns and looks over the crowd. 
EUNICE And it looks like that's just the way somebody wanted it. What say we scrape the shit off this cow's ass, fellas? Detective Greenly? Escort a lady onto the crime scene? 
GREENLY What?   No, yeah, no.   Of course. 
Greenly escorts her as Dolly and Duffy walk behind, mystified. 
GREENLY (CONT'D) Do you want a cup of coffee or something? 
EUNICE Never touch the stuff. 
INT. VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Eunice stands, looking down the aisle at the altar. Behind her, the Detectives are curios as Eunice slides on pink latex gloves. 
She puts in ear plugs and all ambient sound ceases.   She starts slowly down the aisle... 
TOTAL SILENCE AS...Eunice inspects the smashed door of a confessional booth. She looks over the body closely then turns from the altar and walks to the detectives. She pulls her earplugs and all sound returns. 
EUNICE It wasn't them...but I'm sure you boys already knew that. 
The detectives nod. 
DUFFY The two "V's." The victim and venue don't add up.

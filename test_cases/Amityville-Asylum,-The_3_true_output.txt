amnesia. Often we find out who they are. Not so with this man. 
LISA Why is he down here? 
DELANEY They first brought him in about six months ago. No one knows where he came from, he literally just turned up late one night. An orderly found him wandering the grounds. First of all he was like Missus Hardesty upstairs-catatonic. Then a few weeks later he started to respond to Doctor Mixter and the nurses through facial expressions and gestures. But soon, he got violent. Very violent. He'd have bursts of rage and beat other patients. One day he appeared to have a seizure and collapsed. A young doctor tried to take his vital signs. Patient X here throttled him so hard he crushed his larynx. It took six orderlies to restrain him. Now they won't even let him out for the obligatory hour a day exercise. We still don't know who he is. 
LISA Oh God. 
Delaney stares at Lisa. 
DELANEY God has nothing to do with this man. Delaney slams the hatch shut. Lisa looks disturbed. 
DELANEY I haven't put you off have I? 
LISA I guess not... it's just a lot to take in. I've obviously never been around stuff like this before. 
DELANEY This is the reality of this place. We don't deal with these people directly but we may have to clean up their mess. If you can't handle 
that then I understand. You know that it's not too late to back out? 
Lisa considers for a moment. 
LISA I'm not a quitter. 
CUT TO: 
24.EXT. HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL ­ NIGHT The hospital is bathed in moonlight. 
CUT TO: 
25.INT. WARD B ­ CONTINUOUS 
Lisa hoovers the carpet in the empty communal room. She then empties the bins. A Clock on the wall ticks towards 3:15am. 
CUT TO: 
26.INT. HALLWAY ­ A LITTLE LATER 
Lisa is mopping. As she reaches the end of the hallway a young girl walks around the corner carrying a teddy bear. Lisa is STARTLED. LISA Ooh, you made me jump! Should you be out of bed this late? 
GIRL I don't know. 
The girl has flowing blonde hair and an angelic face, yet there is a haunting sadness in her eyes. 
LISA I don't think you should be. 
GIRL Do you want to play with me? 
LISA I'd love to sweetheart, but it's very late now. I think you better go back to bed. 
GIRL Okay.

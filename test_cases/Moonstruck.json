{"train": "\"MOONSTRUCK\" \nby \nJohn Patrick Shanley \nFinal Draft \nFADE IN: \nINT. ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAY \nSeveral dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse. \nWe leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter, in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE WHITE BACKGROUND. \nMOONSTRUCK \nNow WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL. \nZITO'S VOICE (barely discernable) Three times they cancel the order with me, and three times they come back. Who they kidding? They cheap, cheap, cheap. The other bread they get is no good. They save pennies. Everybody complain and they come back. \"Zito, your bread is the best.\" They're like children stupid in school who cannot learn. The water. It's the water. You buy bread in Hoboken, you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask your father. He knows. \nDuring Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger. \nNOW WE SEE ZITO \nHe's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's early in the day, and he's already been working for hours, so he's a little tired and disgruntled. \nZITO You want me to make you some coffee? \nNOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME \nShe's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes of a dark color. \nLORETTA What d'you know about coffee? Gimme a loaf of bread. \nEXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAY \nLoretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She moves off briskly. \nEXT. A.J. CONTI FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAY \nThis is a little Italian funeral parlor. \nINT. THE \"WAKE\" ROOM\" \nA generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes, many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front, the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises. \nShe goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over and says. \nOLD WOMAN He looks great. \nRUBY That Al Conti is a genius. \nINT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLOR \nFirst WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE. \nCONTI'S VOICE I am a genius. \nThe SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's tabulations. \nLORETTA'S VOICE If you're such an artistic genius, why can't you keep track of your receipts? How am I going to do your income tax? \nCONTI'S VOICE I am an artistic genius. \nThe SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger. \nLORETTA If you're an artistic genius, how come you got butter on your tie? \nHe looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss. \nLORETTA Give it here. I'll give you this, Al, you make good coffee. \nShe downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has taken off, and slams the ledger shut. \nINT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL \nWe are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift. He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame, heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and \nThey turn and look. The man's name is PERRY. \nPERRY AND PATRICIA FROM LORETTA'S POV \nPerry is a university professor. PATRICIA is his girlfriend/student. He's in his 50's. She's about 25 years younger. She's getting her coat on in a huff. \nPERRY Patricia, please don't go! \nPATRICIA What do you think I am, a talking dog? \nPERRY I was just making a point about the way you said... the way you stated your aspirations. \nPATRICIA You can kiss my aspirations! Professor! \nShe storms out, leaving Perry muttering to himself. \nPERRY Kiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever. The height of cleverness. Waiter! \nAn abnormally SHY WAITER stops. \nSHY WAITER Yes? \nPERRY Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka? \nSHY WAITER But absolutely! \nTHE SHY WAITER begins to efficiently clear. \nMR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA EXCHANGE A GLANCE \nMr. Johnny is amused. Bobo serves them their salad. \nMR. JOHNNY A man who can't control his woman is funny. \nLORETTA She was too young for him. \nMr. Johnny considers this a point well taken. \nBOBO AND HIS NEPHEW EDDIE STAND NEAR THE KITCHEN \nWhich can be seen through a serving window. They can look out over the restaurant tables. Bobo is melancholy and philosophical. EDDIE is a young waiter. \nEDDIE What'samatter, Uncle Bobo? \nBOBO Tonight Mr. Johnny's gonna propose marriage. \nEDDIE How you know that? \nBOBO He arranged it with me. When he asks her, then he'll wave to me and I'll bring champagne. Good bachelor customer for twenty years. But who knows? Maybe he'll lose courage. \nEDDIE Heavy duty stuff. \nPERRY, FEELING NO PAIN, COLLARS THE SHY WAITER \nHe holds out his empty glass. \nPERRY Can I get another one of these? \nSHY WAITER Definitely! \nPerry takes his arm. \nPERRY May I presume to ask you a question? \nSHY WAITER Sure! \nPERRY Do you have a girlfriend? \nSHY WAITER I am alone in the world. \nPerry lets go of his arm. He and the Shy Waiter commiserate a moment. Then, wordlessly, the Shy Waiter goes. \nPERRY That's very sad. \nBOBO IS CLEARING THE REMAINS OF MR. JOHNNY'S DINNER. He's already cleared Loretta's. \nBOBO How's things? \nLORETTA Fine, Bobo. We'll take the check. \nLORETTA AND MR. JOHNNY \nLORETTA You could use your pinky ring. \nMR. JOHNNY I like this ring. \nLORETTA You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement. \nMr. Johnny takes off the ring and holds it out to her. \nMR. JOHNNY Loretta. Loretta Castorini Clark. On my knees. In front of all these people. Will you marry me? \nShe meekly accepts the ring from him and takes his hands. \nLORETTA Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony Cammareri. I will marry you. I will be your wife. \nMr. Johnny slowly stands up, brushes off his knees. The restaurant has fallen utterly silent. Loretta smiles. They embrace. Loretta kisses him quickly. \nA MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, SUSAN, IS MAUDLIN FROM THE PROPOSAL \nBobo stands very near her table. She is about to applaud the proposal. She brings her hands together. Bobo's hand flashes out and neatly captures her hands before they can part again. The single sound dies abruptly in the silent room. \nLORETTA AND MR. JOHNNY \nMr. Johnny is in control now. He looks around once, regally. \nMR. JOHNNY Bobo! The check! \nPERRY AND THE SHY WAITER LOOK AT MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA \nPERRY I feel like I have just witnessed a car accident. \nThe Shy Waiter sits down at Perry's table. \nSHY WAITER When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips. \nPERRY What happened? \nSHY WAITER She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor. \nMR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA \nHe's helping her on with her coat. \nLORETTA What time is it? \nMR. JOHNNY Seven-thirty. \nLORETTA So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time. \nMr. Johnny puts on his coat. \nMR. JOHNNY My mother will be happy I'm getting married. \nBobo approaches with the bucket of champagne. He's flustered. \nBOBO I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny. \nMR. JOHNNY I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding. \nEXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - A CREAM COLORED LTD SPEEDING - NIGHT \nINT. THE CREAM LTD - NIGHT \nLoretta driving and Mr. Johnny sitting beside her. In the back seat are two suitcases. \nLORETTA What about the wedding? \nMR. JOHNNY My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married. \nLORETTA How near is she to death? \nMR. JOHNNY A week. Two weeks. No more. \nLORETTA Then let's set the date. \nLORETTA How about a month from today? \nMR. JOHNNY Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back? \nCRONE (smiles) Neither do I. \nThe plane takes off. Loretta looks after it anxiously. All her hopes are on that plane. \nINT. A PARKING GARAGE IN LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT \nThe LTD pulls into the entrance and Loretta gets out. An ATTENDANT appears. \nATTENDANT Mr. Johnny's, right? \nLORETTA Right. The key's in it. \nATTENDANT Good night. \nLORETTA Night. \nLoretta walks of into the night. \nEXT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT \nCamera frames the window with a sweetheart in neon. \nEXT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT \nLoretta walks up the street and enters the store. \nINT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT \nLoretta walks in. IRV and LOTTE, the middle-aged couple who own and run the place, are having an argument. \nLOTTE I've seen how you look at her and it isn't right. \nIRV How do I look at her? (to Loretta) Can I help you? \nLORETTA A split of Moet. \nLOTTE (to IRV) Like a wolf. \nIRV (getting the split) Like a wolf, huh? You never seen a wolf in your life. \nIRV (to Loretta) That's seven-fifty-seven. \nLoretta pays and waits for her change. \nLOTTE I seen a wolf in everybody I ever met and I see a wolf in you. \nIRV (giving the change) That makes ten. Thanks. Have a nice night. \nLORETTA You, too. \nLoretta walks out. \nIRV You know what I see in you, Lotte? \nLOTTE What? \nIRV The girl I married. \nLotte, caught off-guard, blushes. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT \nIt's a big, old eccentric, three-story corner house. To one side, it's got a qated arch that leads to an inner courtyard where three cars could park. It's got two cast-iron balconies. About a third of the windows in the house are lit. \nFrom within can be HEARD the faint strains of VICKI CARR SINGING and one DOG BARKING. Loretta appears, carrying champagne, approaches the front door, unlocks it, and goes in. \nINT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nMUSIC \nVICKI CARR is SINGING \"IT MUST BE HIM.\" \nThe front hall is typical of big old brownstones. There's a big old oak coat rack with a built-in mirror and an umbrella stand. There are several coats hanging from it. The floor is littered with boots. There's also a side table. \nOn the table is a large cut-glass bowl filled with a couple of pounds of hard candy. \nLoretta comes in and takes off her coat. A single MAD HOWL is HEARD, followed by a PANDEMONIUM OF BARKING. FIVE DOGS charge into the hall to greet Loretta. They are totally cockeyed, crackpot mutts. Their names are JUDAS, LUCY, LEO FATBOY, AND JONES. \nLORETTA Hello, boys and girls. Guess what happened to me? \nAs Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta, who's at the stove. \nROSE Will you live here? \nLORETTA No. \nROSE Why not? \nLORETTA Pop don't like Johnny. \nLoretta returns with the coffeepot to the table, and pours. \nThen she takes the pot back to the stove. \nROSE So we'll sell the house. \nLORETTA I got married before, you didn't sell. \nLoretta comes to the table. They sit down to breakfast. \nROSE Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby... \nLORETTA I'm thirty-seven years old. \nROSE What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over. \nLORETTA Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there. \nROSE And we'll sell the house. \nLORETTA I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny. \nROSE No. He don't. \nThe WALL PHONE in the kitchen RINGS. Loretta goes and answers it. \nLORETTA Hello? Yea, this is Loretta Castorini - yeah. Is that you Johnny? \nINT. A DARKENED BEDROOM IN PALERMO - DAY \nMr. Johnny is calling on an old European-style phone. In the b.g. is the sickbed. In the sickbed lies VESTA, Mr. Johnny's mother, her grey hair spread out on a golden pillow. \nBy the bed are THREE MOURNERS, old crones dressed in black. \nOne clutches a missal, the other two clutch rosaries. All three are grieving in a steady low wordless whine. Mr. Johnny speaks into the phone in a confidential manner. There is some long-distance CRACKLE. \nMR. JOHNNY Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother. \nLORETTA ON THE PHONE \nLORETTA How was your plane ride? \nMR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE \nMR. JOHNNY The waitresses were very nice. (glances over at his mother) My mother is slipping away. \nLORETTA ON THE PHONE \nVESTA (calling to the Heavens) Quanto tempo devo aspettare? (now she aims more at Johnny) How long must I wait?! \nMR. JOHNNY I can't talk long. \nLORETTA Have you told her we're getting married? \nMR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE \nMR. JOHNNY Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful. \nWe HEAR Loretta's VOICE over his receiver. \nLORETTA'S VOICE Just don't wait until she's dead. \nMR. JOHNNY Have you called my brother? \nLORETTA'S VOICE Not yet. \nMR. JOHNNY Will you do it today? Call him, make him come to the wedding. Five years is too long for bad blood between brothers. Nothing can replace your family. I see that now. \nLORETTA ON THE PHONE \nRocco slides back the door all the way. Chrissy and Loretta make their way past him. He slides the door three quarters shut behind them. \nINT. THE BASEMENT OVEN ROOM - DAY \nThere are two coal-fired ovens, one at either end of the room. There is a large wooden table roughly center. And various pieces of baking equipment, dough-mixers, etc., scattered willy-nilly. And everywhere there is bread. \nPIETRO, a baker, is working at one of the ovens with a long wooden spatula. RONNY is working at the other oven. \nActually, he is just staring in the open door at the baking bread and burning coals. He's dressed in black jeans streaked with flour, a white restaurant shirt, white cotton gloves, and around his neck, a red handkerchief. He is black-haired, handsome and intense. \nROCCO Ronny! \nRONNY What! \nROCCO Somebody here to see you. \nRonny turns and takes in Loretta. \nRONNY Have you come from my brother? \nLORETTA Yes. \nRONNY Why? \nLORETTA I'm going to marry him. \nRONNY You are going to marry my brother? \nLORETTA Yes. Do you want... \nRONNY I have no life. \nLORETTA Excuse me. \nRONNY I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me. \nLORETTA I don't understand. \nEverything in the oven room has stopped and everyone is watching. \nRONNY And now he's getting married. He has his, he's getting his. And he wants me to come? What is life? \nHe picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven. \nLORETTA I didn't come here to upset you. \nRonny slides a bunch of loaves out of the oven on the spatula, turns them around, and slides them back in. \nRONNY They say bread is life. So I bake bread, bread, bread. (He's picking up loaves of bread from one of the boxes on the floor, and casually tossing them across the room.) And the years go by! By! By! And I sweat and shovel this stinking dough in and outta this hot hole in the wall and I should be so happy, huh, sweetheart? You want me to come to the wedding of my brother Johnny?!! Where is my wedding? Chrissy! Over by the wall! Gimme the big knife! \nCHRISSY No, Ronny! \nBarbara appears in the doorway and comes down the stairs into the room. \nRONNY Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat! \nLORETTA Maybe I should come back another time. \nRONNY No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife! \nCHRISSY I tell you I won't do it! \nRONNY (to Loretta) Do you know about me? \nBARBARA Oh, Mr. Cammareri! \nRONNY Nothing is anybody's fault, but things happen. (holds up his left hand to Loretta) Look. \nHe pulls off the glove. The hand is made of wood. \nRONNY It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc\u00e9 saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man. \nLORETTA That's the bad blood between you and Johnny? \nRONNY That's it. \nLORETTA But that wasn't Johnny's fault. \nRONNY I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget? \nRONNY Loretta. What's that smell? \nLORETTA I'm making you a steak. \nRONNY You don't have to help me. \nLORETTA I know that. I do what I want. \nRONNY I like it well done. \nLORETTA You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood. \nINT. RONNY'S APARTMENT -DINING ROOM - DAY \nCU of Ronny's artificial hand, holding a fork stuck in a steak. With his right he is cutting his steak. He switches hands and eats hungrily. Loretta watches. \nRONNY This is good. Uhh... \nLORETTA Loretta. \nRONNY Where'd Johnny find you? \nLORETTA He knew my husband who died. \nRONNY How'd he die? \nLORETTA Bus hit him. \nRONNY Fast. \nLORETTA Instantaneous. \nRONNY When you get engaged? \nLORETTA Yesterday. \nRonny drops his knife and fork and turns away. Loretta is not surprised and does not move. \nRONNY Why? \nLORETTA Why what? \nRONNY I don't know. \nLORETTA (smiles) So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then? \nRONNY No. \nLORETTA Stupid. \nRONNY When your husband get hit by the bus? \nLORETTA Seven years ago. \nRONNY How many men since then? \nLORETTA Just Johnny. \nRONNY Stupid yourself. \nLORETTA No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky. \nRONNY I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that. \nLORETTA What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear? \nRONNY Why you talking to me? \nLORETTA You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey? \nEXT. STREET NEAR BAKERY - DAY \nSHOT OF COSMO & MONA IN THE BUICK \nThe car has just come to a stop. We see Cosmo & Mona kiss. \nShe exits car. Cosmo glances around with a slightly guilty look and pulls away. \nLORETTA AND RONNY AT THE TABLE WITH A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY \nThey kiss. When they part there is a drop of blood on Loretta's lips. \nRONNY Your blood. \nLORETTA All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny. \nRONNY Loretta. \nLORETTA I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me. \nRONNY I've got you. \nLORETTA Get all of me. Take everything. \nRONNY What about Johnny? \nLORETTA You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry! \nRONNY Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left. \nTheir eyes are boiling with fierce animal tears. They have opened their souls to each other and they are coming together. \nThe MUSIC SWELLS to a terrible triumph. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT \nDog whines over exterior. \nINT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - AN UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWith five beds for dogs. Four of the beds are empty and on the fifth Judas is whining. He looks around at the other beds. Where is everybody? He goes out the bedroom door. \nTHE CASTORINI STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nJudas is running down the stairs and into the hall. We FOLLOW HIM down the hall. The hall is only dimly lit. He finds the four other dogs. They are crowded at a narrow doorway. \nFrom the doorway comes a golden light. \nINT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nTHE PLEASED FACE OF COSMO THROUGH A VEIL OF STEAM \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK. \nWe are in the Castorini dining room. Cosmo sits at the head of the table, a napkin tucked into his shirt. \nRose has just laid down a massive platter of steaming baked fish. Already on the table is a platter of pasta, loaves of bread, a big bowl of salad, two bottles of wine, and an appetizer plate of salami and pimento. Seated at the table is COSMO, the Old Man, and RAYMOND and RITA CAPPOMAGGI. \nRaymond is rotund, moon-faced, bald, somewhere in his fifties. \nHe has a pencil-thin mustache over his small mouth. His wife, Rita, looks very like him, except she has hair on her head and none on her lip. Raymond is Rose's brother. There are two empty places at table, for Rose and Loretta. \nCOSMO Where's Loretta? We're gonna start without her. \nONE OF THE ENTRANCE WAYS TO THE DINING ROOM \nThere is an accordion gate across it. Behind the gate, the Five Dogs stare at the people having dinner. \nROSE'S VOICE She must be eating out. \nRAYMOND'S VOICE She don't know what she's missing. \nROSE'S VOICE It's not like her not to call. \nRITA'S VOICE Well, she's got a lot on her mind. \nTHE DINING TABLE - RITA IS LOADING UP HER PLATE \nRITA I mean, can we talk about it, Rose? Everybody's heard. She's getting married again. \nCOSMO I don't wanna talk about it. \nRAYMOND Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married? \nCOSMO I don't wanna talk about it. \nThe Old Man has piled his plate high with food. Now he stands up, walks over to the Dogs, and puts the plate down in their midst. The Dogs attack the food and each other. The Old Man walks back to the table and sits down. He looks down at the empty place in front of him, a little sad. \nCOSMO My father needs a plate. \nLORETTA Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession. \nPRIEST What sins have you to confess? \nLORETTA Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc\u00e9, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident. \nPRIEST Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta? \nLORETTA I... a... slept with my fianc\u00e9's brother. \nPRIEST That's a pretty big sin. \nLORETTA I know. \nPRIEST You should think about this. \nLORETTA I know. \nPRIEST Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life. \nLORETTA Alright. \nPRIEST I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nLoretta comes out of the confessional and enters a pew. She crosses herself. Then she recognizes the back of a woman's head a few pews down. She gets up, walks down the aisle, and kneels down next to her mother, Rose. \nLORETTA Hi. \nROSE (looking up from her prayers) Where you been? \nLORETTA I don't wanna talk about it. \nROSE Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night. \nLORETTA Thanks. What's the matter with you? \nROSE Cosmo's cheating on me. \nLORETTA What! How do you know? \nROSE A wife knows. \nLORETTA Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old. \nRose starts to reply, but then decides it's not worth the argument. \nLORETTA I won't be home for dinner. \nLoretta crosses herself quickly, gets up, and leaves. Rose looks after, and then goes back to her prayer. \nINT. CAMMARERI'S BAKERY - DAY \nFeminine hands apply the final decorative touches of blue icing to a wedding cake. Then the hands set the plastic bride and groom on the pinnacle. The CAMERA PULLS BACK. \nBarbara is viewing her handiwork, a wedding cake on a stainless steel wheeled cart. She's in the back part of the bakery. Barbara is pleased with her creation. We TRAVEL WITH HER as she rolls the cart out to the front of the store where Chrissy is waiting on a huge man named HARVEY. She hands him a tiny box, which he takes meekly. \nHARVEY See you tomorrow, Chrissy. \nCHRISSY Okay, Harvey. \nHarvey lumbers off as Barbara enters the front of the store with the cake on its cart. Barbara calls Chrissy's attention to the cake. \nBARBARA So what do you think? \nCHRISSY About what? \nBARBARA The cake! \nCHRISSY (without enthusiasm) Where's Ronny? How come he ain't come down? \nBARBARA How should I know? \nThe PHONE RINGS. Chrissy answers it. \nCHRISSY Hello, Cammareri's? Hi. Uh-huh. Okay. \nShe hangs up. \nINT. A CHURCH BASEMENT \nIt's been set up for a church bazaar. There are several wheels of fortune, many stuffed animals, coffee urns, cakes, a game of ring toss, etc. AS THE CAMERA inventories the contents of the various stands -- a LITTLE NUN sleeps in one of them -- we HEAR the Old Man's VOICE. \nOLD MAN'S VOICE I've got a lot on my mind. Things are getting bad in my house. My daughter-in-law is mad at my son because he will not pay for the wedding. \nA TUB OF APPLES FLOATING IN WATER \nAn old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it with a towel. The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING that the hand belongs to Lucy, who is standing behind a table with the Old Man and Felix. She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer. \nThen the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process. But the Old Man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever to drive the stake into the apple. This frustrates Felix. \nOLD MAN At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house. \nFELIX Hurry up. \nLUCY Don't fight. \nOLD MAN If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick. \nFELIX We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done. \nOLD MAN I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous. \nLUCY Don't make yourself sick. \nOLD MAN Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner. \nLUCY Talk to him. \nOLD MAN I will. But I must find the right moment. \nLUCY Did you see the moon last night? \nThe Old Man's eyes light up. He looks at Lucy. \nOLD MAN Yes! \nFELIX (in despair) Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes. \nINT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY \nEIGHT NEAT STACKS OF MONEY BEING RUBBERBANDED \nBy a woman's hands. The last stack is topped with a filled out deposit slip. The banded stacks are then stuffed into a night-deposit bag. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a bit to INCLUDE a ledger. A last entry is made, and the ledger is shut. The CAMERA PULLS BACK more, and now WE SEE Loretta reaching for her coat. She puts it on, picks up the deposit bag, and sees Rita. \nLORETTA Bye, Aunt Rita. \nRITA Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow? \nLORETTA Yeah, I'll be in. \nLoretta goes out the door, with Rita looking after, thoughtful. \nEXT. THE CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY \nLoretta walks-down the street and comes to the CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP, fidgets a moment, looks around to see if anybody's looking, and goes in. \nWE SEE her through the window talking to MILDRED, who handles appointments. Mildred nods, points, and Loretta goes back into the store. \nINT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY \nWE DISCOVER an uneasy Loretta sitting in a beauty chair with BONNIE, her hairdresser about to start. Bonnie is a little bored. \nBONNIE So? You want the usual? \nLORETTA I want you to get rid of the grey. \nTRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC STARTS HERE AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SCENES. This music should convey that Loretta is turning from a frumpy pumpkin into a sleek and beautiful coach. Bonnie wakes up upon hearing this startling news and gets very excited. \nBONNIE I've been wanting to do this for three years! Let me show you some magazines! You've got to get a manicure! And your eyebrows! Sheila! I'm gonna need help! \nSHEILA, another beautician, joins Bonnie, and they both get very excited and start showing Loretta and each other magazines. They argue merrily about what they should do, leaving Loretta far behind. A MANICURIST joins them, with her stuff and starts soaking Loretta's nails. \nA MONTAGE FOLLOWS \nThey're plucking her eyebrows. \nThey're cutting and dying her hair. \nBobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument goes on. \nSHEILA'S VOICE I really do hate it though, when you take that tone with me. Like you're above it all and isn't it amusing. \nMAN'S VOICE But it is, isn't it? \nSHEILA'S VOICE Not to me! This is my life, no matter how damned comical it may seem to you. I don't need some man standing above the struggle while I roll around in the mud! \nMAN'S VOICE I think you like the mud and I don't. That's fair, isn't it? If I don't care to... \nSheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds. \nWhen she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his 50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables. \nPERRY Sorry about that, folks. She's a very pretty mental patient. \nThe Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself. \nPERRY Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka? \nSHY WAITER Absolutely! \nThe Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry notices Rose. \nThey are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now. \nPERRY I'm sorry if we disturbed you. \nROSE I'm not disturbed. By you. \nPERRY My lady friend has a personality disorder. \nROSE She was just too young for you. \nThe Shy Waiter serves Perry his drink. \nPERRY (to the Waiter) Thanks, comrade. \nSHY WAITER It's nothing! \nThe Shy Waiter goes. \nPERRY (Rose's comment strikes home) Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you? \nROSE None of your business. \nHe drops his posturing. \nPERRY Sorry. That was rude. \nROSE Will you join me for dinner? \nPERRY Are you sure? \nShe nods. \nPERRY Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that. \nROSE AND PERRY ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR DINNER \nROSE What do you do? \nPERRY I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U. \nROSE That woman was a student of yours? \nPERRY Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was. \nROSE There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it? \nPERRY Yes. \nROSE Don't shit where you eat. \nPERRY (taken aback, then recovering) I'll remember that. What do you do? \nROSE I'm a housewife. \nPERRY Then why are you eating alone? \nThe door opens, and the Old Man comes out, in his great coat and hat, with the Five dogs. He strikes off to the right. \nEXT. STREET I - NIGHT \nRose and Perry come around a corner and pass a store. They pause and look at the Christmas decorations in the window. \nThey continue walking. \nEXT. STREET II - NIGHT \nThe Old Man and the Dogs have stopped by a big tree. Which the dogs adore. \nEXT. STREET I - NIGHT \nRose and Perry walking. They exit camera left. \nEXT. STREET II - NIGHT \nThe Old Man drags the Dogs away from the tree and sets off camera right. \nEXT. STREET I - NIGHT \nRose and Perry walking to the left. \nEXT . STREET II - NIGHT \nThe Old Man and the Dogs walking to the right. \nEXT. STREET I - INTERSECTION \nOUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT \nRose and Perry are walking towards camera. Rose stops short, stunned and alarmed by what she sees before them. \nEXT. STREET II - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE OF LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT \nThe Old Man pulls up the Dogs. Aghast by what he sees before him. \nEXT. STREET III - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT \nPerry and Rose face the Old Man and the dogs. \nIn a silent standoff. Perry is puzzled, but has the sense to say nothing. After a long moment, the Old Man silently steers his dogs past them. He walks away down the dark street, silently disappearing into the gloom. Perry and Rose never move, but follow his slow progress until he disappears. \nPERRY You knew that man? \nROSE Yes. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT \nTHE STAGE - THE OPERA IS IN PROGRESS \nIt's the SCENE in which MIMI is standing in the falling snow. \nShe SINGS to RUDOLPH. It is a beautiful, poignant moment. \nThe snow is falling, falling. Mimi is SINGING her heartbreaking aria of farewell. The lighted tavern window is behind them, glowing with a golden light. \nWE SEE RONNY'S FACE \nHe's staring intently at the stage with shining eyes. He wants to share this moment with Loretta, but he is timid she will not feel as he does. \nWE SEE LORETTA'S FACE \nA single tear trails down her cheek. Otherwise, she is almost succeeding in hiding that the opera is moving her. She notices Ronny's hand creeping towards hers, but makes no move towards it. \nTHE STAGE - MIMI STILL SINGING SADLY IN THE SNOWFALL \nShe and Rudolph join hands. \nRONNY AND LORETTA \ngrab each other's hand fiercely. \nAt last, they look at each other. She is admitting that she is affected by the opera. He is grateful that she admits it. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE - AUDIENCE \u0097 NIGHT \nAudience exits. \nRONNY Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a drink. \nLoretta, still looking after, slowly shakes her head. \nLORETTA That wasn't my mother. \nEXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT \nRose and Perry stand on a sidewalk under a street light dimly shining. About half a block away stands the Castorini house. \nThey regard it. Over the house hangs the moon, cut through now with a sharp grey cloud. Rose and Perry's VOICES can be heard. \nROSE'S VOICE That's my house. \nPERRY'S VOICE You mean the whole house? \nROSE'S VOICE Yes. \nPERRY'S VOICE My God, it's a mansion! \nROSE'S VOICE It's a house. \nPERRY'S VOICE I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do? \nROSE'S VOICE He's a plumber. \nPERRY'S VOICE Well. That explains it. \nThe SOUND of the WIND can be heard rising up. \nNOW WE SEE ROSE AND PERRY CLOSE UP \nThe rising cold wind stirs their hair. They both shiver slightly. \nPERRY Temperature's dropping. \nROSE Yes. \nPERRY I guess you can't invite me in? \nROSE No. \nPERRY People home. \nROSE No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking. \nPERRY I'm a little cold. \nROSE You're a little boy and you like to be bad. \nPERRY We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives. \nROSE I'm too old for you. \nPERRY I'm too old for me. That's my predicament. \nROSE Good night. \nShe kisses him on the cheek. \nPERRY Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too? \nROSE Sure. \nHe kisses her on the cheek. \nPERRY I'm freezing \nROSE Good night. \nShe walks away, towards the house. Perry, shivering, looks after. \nINT. THE BOERUM CAFE - A BROOKLYN BAR - NIGHT \nRonny and Loretta sit at the bar. They are just finishing a couple of Old-Fashions. The barman, AL, inspects their drinks. \nAL Another Old-Fashion? \nRONNY Loretta? \nLORETTA Let me go home. \nRONNY No. \nLORETTA Let me go home. \nRONNY No. \nLORETTA I'm freezing to death. \nRONNY Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on! \nLoretta follows Ronny into his building. \nNOW WE SEE THE STREET \nJust as the door shuts. A moment passes. Lights go on in Ronny's apartment. Out of a doorway on the opposite side of the street steps the figure of a woman. She walks to the middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted windows. \nNOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY \nHer heart is about to break. She loves this man. She looks up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one slender, slender thread. \nMUSIC \nIt's \"MIMI'S ARIA\"- from the snow scene in LA BOHEME. \nWE SEE THE STREET WITH THE FIGURE LOOKING \nAt the lighted window above. \"MIMI'S ARIA\" PLAYS. This tableau reminds us of the scene in the opera where MIMI stands in the snow. The MUSIC PLAYS and the WOMAN SINGS for a long moment. Then, the lights in the apartment go out. Chrissy shudders almost imperceptibly. Her heart has broken. She hangs her head. Then she lifts her head and slowly walks away down the street. \nEXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - RUNWAY - NIGHT \nWith a great and abrupt ROAR, a big jet is landing. \nINT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT \nPASSENGERS are pouring into the terminal from the plane. \nMost of them are Italian or Italian-Americans. Suddenly, Mr. Johnny appears out of the shifting crowd, up very CLOSE to the CAMERA. He looks alert, determined, geared up for action. \nMR. JOHNNY AT THE LUGGAGE CAROUSEL \nHe pulls his two suitcases off the carousel with one quick powerful jerk. \nEXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT \nMr. Johnny sticks out his hand and a cab immediately rushes to him. \nINT. OF THE CAB \nMr. Johnny leans forward to the DRIVER and says in a very definite, determined way. \nMR. JOHNNY 19 Cranberry Street. \nEXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT \nThe cab rushes off into the night. \nEXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe cab pulling up to the Castorini house. The living room windows are all lit up. VICKI CARR can be made out SINGING \"IT MUST BE HIM\". Mr. Johnny gets out of the cab, gets his luggage, and heads for the front door. He RINGS THE BELL. \nThe door opens. It's Rose. MUSIC floods out around her. \nMR. JOHNNY Hello. I'm sorry to call so late... \nRose is a little tipsy. \nROSE Moving in? \nMR. JOHNNY I came right from the airport. \nROSE Come on in. \nShe holds the door open for him and he goes in past her carrying his suitcases. She closes the door. \nINT. CASTORINI HOUSE \u0097 THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nMR. JOHNNY Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her. \nMR. JOHNNY You haven't said anything. \nCOSMO And that's how much I'm saying. \nROSE Cosmo? \nCOSMO What? \nROSE I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else. \nCOSMO Thank you, Rose. \nROSE You're welcome. \nCOSMO I'm going to bed now. \nMr. Johnny stands up. Cosmo walks off, out of view. \nMR. JOHNNY I'm going. \nCOSMO'S VOICE (from top of stairs) Good! \nROSE (to Mr. Johnny) He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question. \nMR. JOHNNY You don't know where Loretta is? \nROSE No idea. \nMR. JOHNNY Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk. \nROSE Okay, I'll tell her. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAWN \nWe watch the effect of the sun coming up on the house. It begins in darkness, and goes through the many graduations of light very quickly until it's lit by the light of bright morning. \nTHE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND THE OLD MAN AND THE DOGS COME OUT \nHe's got them on their leashes and, over his head, he carries the black umbrella. He walks off toward the park and disappears. \nEXT. STREET - DAY - LORETTA IS WALKING \nAlong a sidewalk a couple of blocks away. She is a wreck. \nShe's still in her clothes of the night before. She hasn't slept. Her hair's a bit funny. And she's tormented by the complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING. We follow her as she SINGS and walks. \nWE WATCH LORETTA WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW \nShe's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt. She comes to it again. She kicks it again. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY \nLoretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and enters the house. \nINT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nRose is at the stove. The kitchen is filled with steam and sunlight. Rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal. \nAnother range has the coffeepot heating. Loretta shuffles into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down. \nThere are red roses on the table. Rose sees Loretta. \nROSE What the hell happened to you? \nLORETTA Well. I don't really know where to start. \nROSE Your hair's different. \nLORETTA Everything's different. \nROSE Are you drunk? \nLORETTA No. Are you drunk? \nROSE No. But I have a hangover. \nLORETTA Where's pop? \nROSE Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night. \nThe SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away. \nTHE OLD MAN WALKS IN \nHe looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him. \nHe points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his hand opens in a gesture of supplication. \nOLD MAN I am old. The Old are not wanted. And what they say has no weight. But, my son, I must speak. You should pay for the wedding of your only daughter. You are breaking your house through pride. There. I've said it. \nCOSMO It's okay, Pop. If she gets married, I'll pay for the whole thing. \nThe Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal. \nHe is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish. \nThe others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking to Cosmo. \nROSE Have I been a good wife? \nCOSMO Yes. \nROSE I want you to stop seeing her. \nEveryone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this. Then slowly, he sits down. \nCOSMO Okay. \nROSE And go to confession. \nCOSMO (still not looking at her) A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day. \nROSE Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo. \nShe puts her hand across the table to him. \nCOSMO Ti amo. \nHe slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been able to hold her gaze in this whole story. The DOORBELL RINGS. \nLORETTA It's Johnny. I'll get it. \nLoretta's tone is fatal. \nRONNY I'll get it. \nRose gets up. \nROSE I'll get it. \nShe goes to answer the door. \nRONNY (goes for the door) No, I'll tell him. \nLORETTA No, I'll tell him. (to her father) What am I going to tell him? \nCOSMO Tell him the truth, Loretta they find out anyway. \nLoretta looks at her father. \nLORETTA I love you Pop. \nIt's a private moment. \nBut who appears at the kitchen door is not Johnny. It's the CAPPOMAGGIS. \nThey have their coats on and they look very serious and concerned and timid. \nRITA Hi Loretta. \nLORETTA Hi. \nRAYMOND Hi, Loretta. \nLORETTA Hi. Why ain't you at the store? \nRITA Is there anything you want to tell us, honey? \nLORETTA You? No. \nRONNY I'm sure she did. \nMR. JOHNNY It was a miracle! \nLORETTA Johnny, I have something to tell you. \nMR. JOHNNY I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone. \nLORETTA I have no secrets from my family. \nMR. JOHNNY Loretta, I can't marry you. \nLORETTA WHAT? \nMR. JOHNNY If I marry you my mother will die. \nThe Old Man laughs a loud sudden laugh, and then subsides. \nLORETTA What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged. \nRONNY Loretta, what are you talking about? \nLORETTA I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me! \nMR. JOHNNY Because my mother was dying! But now she's not. \nRONNY You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life. \nMR. JOHNNY And you are a son who doesn't love his mother! \nLORETTA And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here! \nMR. JOHNNY I must ask for that back. \nLoretta struggles and pulls off the ring. \nLORETTA Here! Take your stupid pinky ring. (she throws it at Johnny) Who needs it? The engagement's off. \nMr. Johnny retrieves the ring. \nMR. JOHNNY In time, you will see that this is the best thing. \nLORETTA In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress. \nRONNY Loretta? \nLORETTA What! \nRONNY Will you marry me. \nMR. JOHNNY What? \nLORETTA Where's the ring? \nRonny looks to Mr. Johnny a little sheepishly. \nRONNY Could I a... borrow that ring. \nMr. Johnny, in shock, hands it over to Ronny. \nRONNY Thanks. \nHe kneels down before Loretta. He presents the ring to her. \nRONNY Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark? \nLORETTA Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri! \nShe takes the ring. Ronny and Loretta kiss. \nROSE Do you love him, Loretta? \nLORETTA Yeah, Ma, I love him awful. \nROSE Oh God, that's too bad. \nRonny and Loretta enter into a long kiss. The Old Man starts to cry. Cosmo leans forward to the Old Man solicitously. \nCOSMO What's the matter, Pop? \n", "test1_input": "COSMO He did? \nLORETTA Yeah. \nCOSMO That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring? \nLoretta shows it. \nCosmo examines it. \nLORETTA Here. \nCOSMO It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring. \nLORETTA It's temporary. \nCOSMO Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing. \nLORETTA So you'll come to the wedding, right? \nCOSMO Let's go tell your Mother. \nShe smiles. He doesn't. They rise from the table. \nTHE CASTORINI HOUSE - DARKENED MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe door to the hall opens, and the light from without dimly illuminates a massive four-poster bed. Cosmo enters, followed by Loretta. He speaks into the dark a calm and measured summons. \nCOSMO Rose. Rose. Rose. Rose. \nA lamp is switched on by the bed. By ROSE. Rose is in her 60'S, and is very, very beautiful. Her abundant white tresses frame a face of porcelain delicacy. \nShe's wearing an old and richly beautiful white nightgown. \nROSE Who's dead? \nCOSMO Nobody. Loretta is getting married. \nROSE Again? Johnny Cammareri. \nCosmo goes and sits on the bed. \nCOSMO I don't like him. \nROSE You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta? \nLORETTA No. \nROSE Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him? \nLORETTA Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception. \nROSE And who's gonna pay for that? \nLORETTA Pop. \nCOSMO WHAT? \nRose starts laughing. \nLORETTA Father of the bride pays. \nCosmo walks out. \nCOSMO I have no money! \nROSE You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo. \nCosmo shouts from the stairs. \nCOSMO I won't pay for nothing. \nROSE He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die. \nLORETTA It's his duty as a father to pay for my wedding, Ma ... \nMUSIC \nVICKI CARR, SINGING \"IT MUST BE HIM\", starts playing. Rose looks weary. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - MORNING \nThe first golden rays of sunlight touch the great old house. \nThe front door opens. Close shot of dogs coming into camera as door opens. The OLD MAN comes out. The Old Man, who is Cosmo's father, is 83 years old. He is taking the Five Dogs out for their morning walk. He has their five leashes bundled in one hand. In the other hand, even though it is a cloudless November morning, he open black umbrella. He walks off down the block with the dogs. \nEXT. A SMALL CITY PARK SURROUNDED BY HURRICANE FENCE - DAY \nThe Old Man and the Five Dogs appear and enter the park. He approaches a park bench where FELIX and LUCY are already sitting. Felix and Lucy are about the same age as the Old Man. They each have a well-behaved DOG. When the Old Man sits down, he lets the Five Dogs go. The Dogs run off, BARKING like mad. \nFELIX It's wrong to just let them go. \nOLD MAN (ignoring Felix) Good morning, Lucy. \nLUCY Good morning. \nFELIX They run around, they mess up the whole park. \nOLD MAN What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs. \nFELIX You have too many dogs. \nThe dogs can be HEARD in the distance. It sounds like they're killing each other. \nOLD MAN (goes back to ignoring Felix) Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time. \nLUCY I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her. \nOLD MAN My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby. \nFELIX You should have one dog. Like Lucy. Like me. I wish I hadda gun. If I hadda gun, I would shoot four of your dogs. \nThe Old Man makes a low, threatening noise. \nLUCY Don't fight. \nOLD MAN My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay. \nLUCY He should pay. \nOLD MAN I don't know. \nLUCY He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none. \nOLD MAN Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say. \nThe SOUND of the DOGS becomes intense again. \nFELIX I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other. \nOLD MAN You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY \nThe gates in the big archway are opened from the inside. \nIt's Cosmo. He's wearing a good but old-fashioned suit, an overcoat, and a homburg. He's pulled his car, a 1965 black Buick, up to the gate. Now that he has the gates open, he gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella. \nThe Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house. \nCosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion. \nThen they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car. \nINT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nA RED-HOT, WELL-SEASONED CAST IRON FRYING PAN \nReceives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of satisfaction. A wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan. \nTwo circles of green pepper land next to the bread. A spatula flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the cooked side. \nTwo eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in the bread. \nThe circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula, scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs. \nA WOMAN'S HAND garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash of red pimento. The spatula reappears and lifts the results from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates. \nNow WE SEE that Loretta is just finishing setting the tin table for two. In the b.g., Rose is turning away from the big, old-fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled coffee pot is steaming up a sun-drenched window. Rose comes toward the table with the laden blue plates. She's wearing a nice old apron over a blue housedress. She's thoughtful. \n", "test1_id": 2166, "test2_input": "Ronny looks up at the moon. \nRONNY Yeah. Looks like a big snowball. \nEXT. THE CAPPOMAGGI HOUSE NIGHT \nShot of the house with the moon overhead. \nINT. RAYMOND AND RITA CAPPOMAGGI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThere is a big window right by the bed, and in the window is the moon. Raymond and Rita are in their bed, asleep. Raymond wakes up, and sees the moon in the window. He's stunned and excited, but he too speaks in this low voice of respect. \nRAYMOND Rita. Rita. \nRITA (waking up) What? What? \nRAYMOND Look. \nRITA Oh. \nRAYMOND It's Cosmo's moon. \nRITA What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon. \nRAYMOND I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner. (looks through the window, down into the street) Is he down there? No. \nRITA Is who down there? \nRAYMOND Cosmo. \nRITA What would he be doing down there? \nRAYMOND I don't know. \nRITA You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old. \nRaymond smiles at her meekly. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT \nOver the house is still the great big full moon. The front door opens and out comes the Old Man with the five Dogs. \nThe Old Man is in a greatcoat and a felt hat, and he's smoking a cigar. He stops on the top step and lets go a huge plume of cigar smoke. Then he starts off with the Dogs down the street. \nEXT.. EAST RIVER - NIGHT \nThe moon and nothing else. Then a cigar is thrown into it and sends it shimmering. It was the moon reflected in water. \nNow the CAMERA PULLS BACK and WE SEE the Old Man and the Five Dogs are standing on a ruined pier. The moon gleams up from the Hudson River. The Old Man speaks to the Dogs. \nOLD MAN Alright now. Howl. Howl. \nThe Dogs do not howl. So the Old Man, by way of demonstration, howls at the moon. He looks to the Dogs to follow suit. They do nothing. He howls at the moon again. \nThe Dogs do nothing. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until WE CAN SEE the whole pier, with the Old Man and the Dogs on it, and the moon above them. The Old Man, frustrated now, cries out. \nOLD MAN How long must I wait? Quanto tempo devo aspettare! \nThe Dogs start to HOWL. The Old Man, pleased as the Mad Hatter he is, laughs and laughs. \nEXT. EAST RIVER - DAY \nTransition from moon reflecting in the water to dawn. \nINT. RONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY \nMorning sun floods the room. Close on Loretta, she wakes up. \nLORETTA Oh my God. \nRONNY What? \nLoretta jumps from bed, grabs her clothes to cover herself, and backs into closet. \nLORETTA What? What have we done? \nRONNY (perturbed) Take it easy. \nLORETTA (from closet as she hurriedly gets dressed) This time I was trying to do everything right. \n", "test2_true": "LORETTA I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again. \nRONNY You're trying to make me feel guilty. \nLORETTA I'm marrying your brother! \nRONNY All right, I'm guilty. I confess! \nLORETTA You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo? \nRONNY She didn't like me. \nLORETTA You don't get along with anybody! \nRONNY What did you do? \nLORETTA What did I do? \nRONNY You ruined my life. \nLORETTA That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life! \nRONNY Oh no I didn't! \nLoretta emerges from the closet, tucking in her blouse. \nLORETTA Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him! \nRONNY What? \nLORETTA Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins! \nRONNY I can't do that! \nLORETTA Why not? \nRONNY I'm in love with you! \nLoretta stares at him in alarm, slaps his face, then studies his face to see the effect of the slap. She is dissatisfied and slaps him again. \nLORETTA Snap out of it! \nRONNY I can't! \nLORETTA Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding. \nRONNY I'll come to the wedding. \nLORETTA I'm telling you you can't. \nRONNY But he wants me to come! \nLORETTA But that's cause he don't know! \nRONNY Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing. \nLORETTA What? \nRONNY That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera. \nLORETTA What are you talking about? \nRONNY I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life. \nLORETTA Alright. \nRONNY Alright. Meet me at the Met. \nLORETTA Alright. Where's the Met? \nCATHOLIC CHURCH IN LITTLE ITALY - DAY \nCamera moves from stained glass windows to confessional. \nLoretta is next in line of THREE SINNERS waiting to go into the confessional. A FORGIVEN WOMAN emerges from the curtained booth and walks off to pay her penance. Loretta goes into the booth. \nINT. CHURCH - CONFESSIONAL - DAY \nLoretta kneels. The slide opens and an OLD PRIEST'S FACE can be seen in outline through the screen. \n", "test2_id": 2167, "test3_input": "The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river. \nBut then something starts to replace Jersey. It's a huge white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the \nMUSIC PLAYS \nEND OF MUSIC \nEXT. LINCOLN CENTER PLAZA - NIGHT \nLINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV \nCROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House. Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left, inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous color. \nLORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN \nThe fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled. \nShe remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger jets. \nThen with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water, like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon. \nFROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER \nForming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite side of the fountain, is Ronny. \nHe's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her attempt at composure from, Ronny. \nRonny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her. \nRONNY Hi. \nLORETTA Hi. \nRONNY You look beautiful. Your hair... \nLORETTA I thought I'd try it. (qrudgingly) You look good. \nRONNY Thank you. \nHe goes to kiss her. She takes a step back. \nLORETTA I said I'd go to the opera with you. Nothing else. \nRonny immediately relents, gently takes her arm, and they walk off in the direction of the opera house. \nONE OF THE CHAGALL'S FROM IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE MET \nRonny and Loretta looking up at it. \nLORETTA Who painted that? \nRONNY Marc Chagall. A Russian. \nLORETTA Kinda gaudy. \nRONNY He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead. (he smiles) Come on, let's go in. \nRonny and Loretta join the crowd streaming into the building. \nINT. THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT \nRonny and Loretta enter, giving tickets to usher. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT \nRonny and Loretta checking their coats. Ronny's coat is already off, and he's helping Loretta off with hers. He hands her coat to the CHECKER and pockets the check. Then he turns and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time. \nHe's stunned by her beauty. He's at a loss. He mumbles. \nRONNY Thank you! \nLORETTA For what? \nRONNY I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera. \nHis eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself. \nLORETTA So. Where are we sitting? \n", "test3_true": "He takes her arm. They pass under the great chandelier and go into the house. \nTHE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT \nTHE CAMERA PICKS OUT A SERIES OF COUPLES \nThe first couple is PEGGY and CLIVE, a very distinguished pair of silver-haired lovers dressed magnificently. They are in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands. \nNext is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son, John. They are seated and people are looking at them. \nNext is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down, something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes her look like a big piece of hard candy. \nNext is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats. \nThey are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program. \nTHE OPEN PROGRAM - LORETTA'S POV \nThe opera is LA BOHEME. But then the page fades away into the dark as the house lights go down. \nWE SEE RONNY AND LORETTA FROM BEHIND \nRonny leans his head toward her and whispers. \nRONNY Here we go. \nAs the lights come up in the orchestra pit. The CONDUCTOR takes his place. The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. He bows and turns to the orchestra. The OVERTURE begins and PLAYS UNDER NEXT. \nEXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT \nThe OVERTURE PLAYS THROUGH this ESTABLISHING SHOT and then FADES AWAY at the start of the NEXT SHOT. WE SEE Rose enter the restaurant. \nINT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT \nThe dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied. \nThe entranceway door opens and Rose enters. \nShe's got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly approaches her. She's very dignified. \nJIMMY Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming? \nROSE It's just me. I want to eat. \nJIMMY Okay. \nJIMMY I got a table for you right now. \nJimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall. \nJIMMY This alright? \nROSE Fine. \nHe seats her. \nJIMMY Enjoy your meal. \nJimmy breezes off. There's another table-for-two against the wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV, and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA, is having an argument with the man across from her. \nBut the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose's table. \nBOBO Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You eating alone tonight? \nROSE Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a martini, no ice and two olives. \nBOBO Very good. \nBobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a little louder. \nSHEILA'S VOICE I'm trying to explain to you how I feel. Every time I try to explain how I feel, you explain how you feel. I don't think that's really much of a response. \nUNSEEN MAN'S VOICE Well, its the only response I've got. \nBobo reappears with the martini and serves it. \nBOBO You wanna see a menu? \nROSE Not yet. I'll wave. \n", "test3_id": 2168}

RAYMOND AND RITA CAPPOMAGGI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThere is a big window right by the bed, and in the window is the moon. Raymond and Rita are in their bed, asleep. Raymond wakes up, and sees the moon in the window. He's stunned and excited, but he too speaks in this low voice of respect. \nRAYMOND Rita. Rita. \nRITA (waking up) What? What? \nRAYMOND Look. \nRITA Oh. \nRAYMOND It's Cosmo's moon. \nRITA What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon. \nRAYMOND I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner. (looks through the window, down into the street) Is he down there? No. \nRITA Is who down there? \nRAYMOND Cosmo. \nRITA What would he be doing down there? \nRAYMOND I don't know. \nRITA You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old. \nRaymond smiles at her meekly. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT \nOver the house is still the great big full moon. The front door opens and out comes the Old Man with the five Dogs. \nThe Old Man is in a greatcoat and a felt hat, and he's smoking a cigar. He stops on the top step and lets go a huge plume of cigar smoke. Then he starts off with the Dogs down the street. \nEXT.. EAST RIVER - NIGHT \nThe moon and nothing else. Then a cigar is thrown into it and sends it shimmering. It was the moon reflected in water. \nNow the CAMERA PULLS BACK and WE SEE the Old Man and the Five Dogs are standing on a ruined pier. The moon gleams up from the Hudson River. The Old Man speaks to the Dogs. \nOLD MAN Alright now. Howl. Howl. \nThe Dogs do not howl. So the Old Man, by way of demonstration, howls at the moon. He looks to the Dogs to follow suit. They do nothing. He howls at the moon again. \nThe Dogs do nothing. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until WE CAN SEE the whole pier, with the Old Man and the Dogs on it, and the moon above them. The Old Man, frustrated now, cries out. \nOLD MAN How long must I wait? Quanto tempo devo aspettare! \nThe Dogs start to HOWL. The Old Man, pleased as the Mad Hatter he is, laughs and laughs. \nEXT. EAST RIVER - DAY \nTransition from moon reflecting in the water to dawn. \nINT. RONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY \nMorning sun floods the room. Close on Loretta, she wakes up. \nLORETTA Oh my God. \nRONNY What? \nLoretta jumps from bed, grabs her clothes to cover herself, and backs into closet. \nLORETTA What? What have we done? \nRONNY (perturbed) Take it easy. \nLORETTA (from closet as she hurriedly gets dressed) This time I was trying to do everything right. \n", "test1_true": "LORETTA I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again. \nRONNY You're trying to make me feel guilty. \nLORETTA I'm marrying your brother! \nRONNY All right, I'm guilty. I confess! \nLORETTA You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo? \nRONNY She didn't like me. \nLORETTA You don't get along with anybody! \nRONNY What did you do? \nLORETTA What did I do? \nRONNY You ruined my life. \nLORETTA That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life! \nRONNY Oh no I didn't! \nLoretta emerges from the closet, tucking in her blouse. \nLORETTA Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him! \nRONNY What? \nLORETTA Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins! \nRONNY I can't do that! \nLORETTA Why not? \nRONNY I'm in love with you! \nLoretta stares at him in alarm, slaps his face, then studies his face to see the effect of the slap. She is dissatisfied and slaps him again. \nLORETTA Snap out of it! \nRONNY I can't! \nLORETTA Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding. \nRONNY I'll come to the wedding. \nLORETTA I'm telling you you can't. \nRONNY But he wants me to come! \nLORETTA But that's cause he don't know! \nRONNY Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing. \nLORETTA What? \nRONNY That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera. \nLORETTA What are you talking about? \nRONNY I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life. \nLORETTA Alright. \nRONNY Alright. Meet me at the Met. \nLORETTA Alright. Where's the Met? \nCATHOLIC CHURCH IN LITTLE ITALY - DAY \nCamera moves from stained glass windows to confessional. \nLoretta is next in line of THREE SINNERS waiting to go into the confessional. A FORGIVEN WOMAN emerges from the curtained booth and walks off to pay her penance. Loretta goes into the booth. \nINT. CHURCH - CONFESSIONAL - DAY \nLoretta kneels. The slide opens and an OLD PRIEST'S FACE can be seen in outline through the screen. \n", "test1_id": 2166, "test2_input": "The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river. \nBut then something starts to replace Jersey. It's a huge white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the \nMUSIC PLAYS \nEND OF MUSIC \nEXT. LINCOLN CENTER PLAZA - NIGHT \nLINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV \nCROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House. Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left, inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous color. \nLORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN \nThe fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled. \nShe remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger jets. \nThen with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water, like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon. \nFROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER \nForming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite side of the fountain, is Ronny. \nHe's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her attempt at composure from, Ronny. \nRonny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her. \nRONNY Hi. \nLORETTA Hi. \nRONNY You look beautiful. Your hair... \nLORETTA I thought I'd try it. (qrudgingly) You look good. \nRONNY Thank you. \nHe goes to kiss her. She takes a step back. \nLORETTA I said I'd go to the opera with you. Nothing else. \nRonny immediately relents, gently takes her arm, and they walk off in the direction of the opera house. \nONE OF THE CHAGALL'S FROM IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE MET \nRonny and Loretta looking up at it. \nLORETTA Who painted that? \nRONNY Marc Chagall. A Russian. \nLORETTA Kinda gaudy. \nRONNY He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead. (he smiles) Come on, let's go in. \nRonny and Loretta join the crowd streaming into the building. \nINT. THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT \nRonny and Loretta enter, giving tickets to usher. \nINT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT \nRonny and Loretta checking their coats. Ronny's coat is already off, and he's helping Loretta off with hers. He hands her coat to the CHECKER and pockets the check. Then he turns and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time. \nHe's stunned by her beauty. He's at a loss. He mumbles. \nRONNY Thank you! \nLORETTA For what? \nRONNY I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera. \nHis eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself. \nLORETTA So. Where are we sitting? \n", "test2_true": "He takes her arm. They pass under the great chandelier and go into the house. \nTHE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT \nTHE CAMERA PICKS OUT A SERIES OF COUPLES \nThe first couple is PEGGY and CLIVE, a very distinguished pair of silver-haired lovers dressed magnificently. They are in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands. \nNext is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son, John. They are seated and people are looking at them. \nNext is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down, something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes her look like a big piece of hard candy. \nNext is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats. \nThey are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program. \nTHE OPEN PROGRAM - LORETTA'S POV \nThe opera is LA BOHEME. But then the page fades away into the dark as the house lights go down. \nWE SEE RONNY AND LORETTA FROM BEHIND \nRonny leans his head toward her and whispers. \nRONNY Here we go. \nAs the lights come up in the orchestra pit. The CONDUCTOR takes his place. The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. He bows and turns to the orchestra. The OVERTURE begins and PLAYS UNDER NEXT. \nEXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT \nThe OVERTURE PLAYS THROUGH this ESTABLISHING SHOT and then FADES AWAY at the start of the NEXT SHOT. WE SEE Rose enter the restaurant. \nINT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT \nThe dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied. \nThe entranceway door opens and Rose enters. \nShe's got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly approaches her. She's very dignified. \nJIMMY Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming? \nROSE It's just me. I want to eat. \nJIMMY Okay. \nJIMMY I got a table for you right now. \nJimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall. \nJIMMY This alright? \nROSE Fine. \nHe seats her. \nJIMMY Enjoy your meal. \nJimmy breezes off. There's another table-for-two against the wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV, and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA, is having an argument with the man across from her. \nBut the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose's table. \nBOBO Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You eating alone tonight? \nROSE Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a martini, no ice and two olives. \nBOBO Very good. \nBobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a little louder. \nSHEILA'S VOICE I'm trying to explain to you how I feel. Every time I try to explain how I feel, you explain how you feel. I don't think that's really much of a response. \nUNSEEN MAN'S VOICE Well, its the only response I've got. \nBobo reappears with the martini and serves it. \nBOBO You wanna see a menu? \nROSE Not yet. I'll wave. \n", "test2_id": 2167, "test3_input": "MR. JOHNNY You haven't said anything. \nCOSMO And that's how much I'm saying. \nROSE Cosmo? \nCOSMO What? \nROSE I just want you to know.

Cosmo walks off, out of view. \nMR. JOHNNY I'm going. \nCOSMO'S VOICE (from top of stairs) Good! \nROSE (to Mr. Johnny) He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question. \nMR. JOHNNY You don't know where Loretta is? \nROSE No idea. \nMR. JOHNNY Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk. \nROSE Okay, I'll tell her. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAWN \nWe watch the effect of the sun coming up on the house. It begins in darkness, and goes through the many graduations of light very quickly until it's lit by the light of bright morning. \nTHE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND THE OLD MAN AND THE DOGS COME OUT \nHe's got them on their leashes and, over his head, he carries the black umbrella. He walks off toward the park and disappears. \nEXT. STREET - DAY - LORETTA IS WALKING \nAlong a sidewalk a couple of blocks away. She is a wreck. \nShe's still in her clothes of the night before. She hasn't slept. Her hair's a bit funny. And she's tormented by the complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING. We follow her as she SINGS and walks. \nWE WATCH LORETTA WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW \nShe's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt. She comes to it again. She kicks it again. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY \nLoretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and enters the house. \nINT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nRose is at the stove. The kitchen is filled with steam and sunlight. Rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal. \nAnother range has the coffeepot heating. Loretta shuffles into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down. \nThere are red roses on the table. Rose sees Loretta. \nROSE What the hell happened to you? \nLORETTA Well. I don't really know where to start. \nROSE Your hair's different. \nLORETTA Everything's different. \nROSE Are you drunk? \nLORETTA No. Are you drunk? \nROSE No. But I have a hangover. \nLORETTA Where's pop? \nROSE Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night. \n", "test3_true": "LORETTA What? He's in Sicily! \nROSE No more he's not. \nLORETTA He's with his dying mother! \nROSE She recovered. \nLORETTA WHAT!! She was dying! \nROSE It was a miracle. \nLORETTA A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more! \nROSE I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning. \nWith a long low MOAN, Loretta lowers her head to the table. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nRonny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as Loretta just was. He looks like hell, too. His hair is wild and he hasn't slept. He's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts to SING \"O SOAVE FANCIULLA\". He SINGS it any old way, occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just muttering his way through. SINGS as much of it as he remembers, which is a lot. \nWE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW \nHe's SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along. He passes an ITALIAN COUPLE of middle age. They smile as they recognize what he is singing. They start to SING along with him. \nThey SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT. \nEXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY \nRonny appears and approaches the door. HE KNOCKS, waits, and then RINGS THE BELL. Rose answers the door and invites him in. \nINT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN \nRose walks in with Ronny behind her. There's no one in the kitchen. Rose calls out. \nROSE It's not Johnny. \nLoretta comes out of a closet, where she was hiding. She's very surprised to see Ronny. \nLORETTA Ronny! \nRONNY Is Johnny here? \nLORETTA He's coming. \nRONNY Good! We can get this out on the table. (to Rose) I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. (Shakes her hand) \nROSE Nice to meet you. You've got a love bite on your neck. Your mother's recovered from death. \nRONNY Oh. Good. We're not close. I'm not really moved. \nLORETTA You've gotta get outta here. \nRONNY No. I'm gonna wait. \nLORETTA (arguing with Ronny) Ronny, please... \nROSE Would anyone like some oatmeal? \nLORETTA continues arguing. \nRONNY (ignores Loretta) Yes, I would like some oatmeal. \nRonny and Loretta sit down and Rose serves them oatmeal. \nCOSMO WALKS IN dressed for business. He regards the trio, puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again. \nROSE Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother. \nCOSMO His brother. \nCosmo sits down. Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he puls down his spoon. \nCOSMO You're Johnny's brother? \nRONNY Yeah. \nCosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more. \n", "test3_id": 2168}

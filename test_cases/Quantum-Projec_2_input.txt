The RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE is unleashed.   Here it comes, rolling in with a giant WHOOSHING SOUND... 
POV PENTCHO: WATCHING REALITY SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE 
The ships, the dock, the harbor OBLITERATED by an onrushing, transparent cloud of NOTHINGNESS, EMPTINESS, a tabula rasa superimposed upon the disappeared wharf. 
ON PENTCHO, FALLING TO HIS KNEES 
hammered by his own victory, numb from shock and ecstasy, staring into the void as we surge forward 
48     INT.  THE BRAIN FIELD                                   48 
It's completely blank, just like the void.  The VITALS are flatlined. A single piece of thought text floats across the emptiness, almost like a screen saver: Say Uncle.... Say Uncle... 
49     EXT.  THE WHARF - (A VOICE) - NIGHT                     49 
VOICE Uncle, hey... 
A face, peering down at Pentcho.  The face belongs to the MAGIC MAN, in a mad hatter hat, and a potpourri of found item clothing.  Like a Baptist preacher on his sidewalk pulpit: 
MAGIC MAN Can you feel it, uncle?  Can you feel it right down to your bones?! 
ON PENTCHO: EXTREME CLOSE UP

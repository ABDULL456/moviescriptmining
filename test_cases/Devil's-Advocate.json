And when all that evidence is laid before you, when all these pieces weave together, you will conclude -- you will know -- that Alexander Cullen is guilty of murdering three people in cold blood with malice aforethought. \nDone.   The courtroom is silent.   The jury liked him. \nJUDGE POE Mr. Lomax... (checking his watch) We can break for lunch now, or you can do a stop and start... \nKEVIN If it's a choice, I'll go now. I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo. \nJUDGE POE Proceed. \nKEVIN We just spent our morning listening to Mr. Broygo talk about his 'evidence'. What he neglected to tell you is what this case is really about. He left out the most important fact of all: Alex Cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place. Now, Alex Cullen has done a lot of things I don't like. He's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives. He's been a destructive force in the lives of his step-children. He's cheated the city. His partners. His employees. He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines over the years. I don't like those things. I don't expect you to like them. There will be other things during the course of this trial that you will hear about and like even less. But this isn't a popularity contest. It's a murder trial and Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.

But right now -- this moment -- you need immediate representation. \nCULLEN I've got a fourteen-year-old stepdaughter who I care more about than anything in the world.

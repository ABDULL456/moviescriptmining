CONTRACTOR/SCREEN It cost us. 
Rath jumps out of his chair, screaming at the screen. 
RATH I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone! 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN He stole another contract. 
Rath turns from the monitor, pacing.  Trying to collect himself. 
RATH I'm being set up.  Fucking set up! 
He looks at the chess board.  He hovers over it, the pattern completely familiar. 
RATH Is this how it went, Nick? 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Robert?  Robert? 
Rath turns back to the screen, speaking as he types. 
RATH/SCREEN How did he know? 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Know what? 
RATH/SCREEN The fucking contract!  How in the fuck did he know. 
A long beat. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Such language in front of a lady. 
Rath still talking and typing. 
RATH/SCREEN I don't know what the fuck you are. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN I know.  It was a joke. 
Rath stands, no longer typing. 
RATH A joke?  A joke? 
Rath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the screen. 
RATH You think this is a fucking joke? 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN 
Rath looks at the number. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN That's the bonus on the contract. 
Rath puts the gun down. 
RATH/SCREEN Deadline? 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus. 
The FAX MACHINE COMES TO LIFE, printing an inky image. 
RATH/SCREEN Who is the mark? 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist. 
RATH A player? 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.' 
Rath looks at the fax; almost entirely black except for the wide, slit-iris cat eyes. 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY 
There is a SCREECH and BLAST of ENGINES as a 747 touches down, heat rising off the tarmac. 
INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY 
Several passengers walk through the gate into the terminal. 
Across from the gate, Rath sits in a grungy airport cafeteria, reading a folded paper. 
He is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstered to his side. 
Taped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph of a Japanese man wanted for "industrial espionage." 
At the gate, five Japanese men emerge.  Leading the group is the man in Rath's photo.  The other four are obviously muscle. 
Rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall. When they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper and begins to follow. 
His pace and manner is that of a cautious predator.  His focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to find Bain's. 
His hand hovers near his gun. 
Ahead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench coat, stops.  Rath cannot see his face. 
The man starts toward a drinking fountain. 
Rath catches a glimpse of his face.  It could be Bain, but he isn't sure. 
The young man bends over and slurps at the stream of water.  He rises into the barrel of Rath's .22. 
A mouthful of water coughs from his mouth. 
It is not Bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone.

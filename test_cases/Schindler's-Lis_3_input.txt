Except for the clothes of the working class clientele, the scene is reminiscent of the SS nightclub in Cracow: 
Schindler, the great entertainer, working his way around the tables making sure everybody's got enough to drink, making sure everybody's happy. A guy at a table with a girl gestures him over. 
BRINNLITZ GUY 2 Oskar - my friend Lena. 
SCHINDLER How do you do? (to them both) What can I get you, what're you drinking? 
BRINNLITZ GUY 2 Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it? 
SCHINDLER Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good. 
BRINNLITZ GUY 2 Now you're back. 
SCHINDLER Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now? I'm going to have a good time. So are you. 
He gestures to the bartender to refill his friend's and his date's drinks, pats the guy on the shoulder and wanders over to the next table. 
GIRL Who is he? 
The guy has to think; not because he doesn't know, but because his old friend Oskar is so many things it's hard to know which description to use. Finally -- 
BRINNLITZ GUY 2 He's a salesman. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT 
A woman asleep in the bed. The girl from the bar. In his robe, at the window, Schindler calmly smokes as he stares out at the NIGHT 
EXT. BRINNLITZ - DAWN 
The town, off in the distance, nestled against the mountains. 
The sun, just coming up. Closer, here, ramshackle structures, a long abandoned factory of some kind. 
Schindler, in leather riding gear, climbs down off a Moto- Guzzi motorcycle. He slowly wanders around, peers in through broken windows, wanders around some more. 
Tight on his face, torn between conflicting choices, or realizing there's no choice, or only one choice, and hating it. 
SCHINDLER Goddamn it. 
EXT. BALCONY, GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - DAY 
Schindler and Goeth on the balcony of the villa, drinking. 
GOETH You want these people. 
SCHINDLER These people, my people, I want my people. 
Goeth considers his friend, greatly puzzled. Below them lies the camp, still operating, at least for now, until the shipments can be arranged. 
GOETH What are you, Moses? What is this? Where's the money in this? What's the scam? 
SCHINDLER It's good business. 
GOETH Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia -- it doesn't make any sense. 
SCHINDLER Look -- 
GOETH You're not telling me something. 
SCHINDLER It's good for me -- I know them, I'm familiar with them. It's good for you -- you'll be compensated. It's good for the Army. You know what I'm going to make? 
SCHINDLER Artillery shells. Tank shells. They need that. Everybody's happy. 
GOETH Yeah, sure. 
Goeth finds this whole line of reasoning impossible to believe. He's sure Schindler's got something else going on here he's not telling him. 
GOETH You're probably scamming me somehow. If I'm making a hundred, you got to be making three. 
Schindler admits it with a shrug. 
GOETH If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. But how? 
SCHINDLER I just told you. 
GOETH You did, but you didn't. 
Goeth studies him, searching for the real answer in his face. 
He can't find it. 
GOETH Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out. 
SCHINDLER All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you. What's a person worth to you. 
Goeth thinks about it in the silence. Then a slow nod to himself. He's going to make some money out of this even if he can't figure it out. He smiles. 
GOETH What's one worth to you? That's the question.

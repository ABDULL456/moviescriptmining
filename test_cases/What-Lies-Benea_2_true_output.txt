The trailer starts to weave from side to side, swerving the pickup.  Claire chokes, then blacks out. 
EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT 
The Pickup and trailer smash through the railing, barreling over bumpy terrain straight toward the BOAT RAMP. 
The truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled through the rear window and into the passenger side dashboard. 
INT.  PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER 
Claire is unconscious in the driver's seat, a trickle of blood runs from her nose.  Norman stirs briefly as Claire groggily comes to.  She hears the hissing of the smashed radiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on the floor of the cab. 
She leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and realizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND TRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper into the water. 
Before she can get the door open, the truck is half submerged.  She frantically manages to lower her window halfway and starts to pull herself out. 
Her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks onto her ankle and yanks her inside.  Norman pulls her down until they're face to face. 
CLAIRE Norman...NO... 
She yanks the emergency brake, but it's too late...the submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp. The truck is nearly submerged. 
CLAIRE (desperately) Norman, please... 
The water is up to the windows.  Norman shakes his head slowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes. 
CLAIRE Think of Caitlin... 
Water sprays in through the hole in the rear window and momentarily blinds Norman.  Claire jerks free and scrambles out of the driver's side window as the truck sinks. 
Just as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop.  She looks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one hand clamped onto her ankle. 
There is a wrenching metallic creak.  The truck lurches downward...then silence.  IT DOESN'T SINK.  The boat buoys it like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake. 
The headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater drop off.  Claire tries to swim free, but Norman's not letting go. 
Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer. It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights reveal... 
MADISON'S SUBMERGED MUSTANG 
SMASH! 
When the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car, the Mustang's windshield shatters.  A PALE SHAPE FLOATS UPWARD. 
Norman is suddenly entangled by something.  He tries to brush it free but comes face-to-face with MADISON'S GHASTLY, DECOMPOSED FACE.  The last of his air bellows out of him in a scream as he releases Claire's ankle. 
His dead staring face separates from Madison's as the truck slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom. 
EXT.  LAKE - DAWN 
Claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air. 
CUT TO: 
UNDERWATER - DAWN 
The sound of a furious cello solo. 
COLD STARING EYES 
Norman, half out of the truck, arms floating. 
Follow his eyes to THE PALE CORPSE, drifting above, tethered to the Mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle. 
Move through the murky water toward the corpse's clothed back.  As she twists into view... 
MORPHS INTO:  MADISON'S PALE BEAUTIFUL FACE...at peace. 
Camera drifts, moves upward and breaks the surface as the distant lights of EMERGENCY VEHICLES approach. 
CUT TO: 
FINGERS 
...filled with moist earth.  A hand tosses the clump of dirt onto... 
EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY 
A CASKET 
Widen to reveal Claire, dressed in black, stepping away from the grave.  A tiny arm snakes around her waist.  She glances down to see Caitlin, her eyes shining, clasping her mother tightly.  Claire takes a last look into the grave. 
CLAIRE Rest in peace.

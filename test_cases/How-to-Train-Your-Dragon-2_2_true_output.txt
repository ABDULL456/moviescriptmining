Astrid smiles and adopts Hiccup's sloppy slouch. 
ASTRID 
(APING HICCUP) Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day of goofing off to get started. 
Hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him. 
HICCUP Okay, first of all, I don't sound like that. What is this character? And second... what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders? 
Astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 12. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) A truly flattering impersonation. Anyway, he goes... (resuming Stoick's brogue) You're the pride of Berk, son, and I couldn't be prouder... 
ASTRID (continuing her impression 
OF HICCUP) Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty impressed with myself, too. 
HICCUP WHEN have I ever done that with my hands? 
ASTRID You just did. 
She laughs, playfully. 
HICCUP Okay... just... (holding her arms, mock- 
STERN) Hold still. It's very serious. 
She giggles, trying to hold a straight face. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) (resuming Stoick's brogue) You're all grown up, and since no chief could ask for a better successor, I've decided-- 
Astrid straightens, her face brightening. 
ASTRID --TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods! 
She jumps to her feet, beaming... 
ASTRID (CONT'D) Hiccup, that's amazing! 
And socks Hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. She laughs as Hiccup reels it back in, self-consciously. 
HICCUP You're gonna wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very sensitive! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 13. 
They're suddenly BOWLED OVER by Toothless and Stormfly. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Yeah, so... this is what I'm dealing with. 
Astrid helps him up and dusts him off. 
ASTRID 
(EXCITED) What did you tell him? 
HICCUP I didn't. By the time he turned around, I was gone. 
Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him, processing it all. 
ASTRID Well, it's a lot of responsibility. The map will have to wait for sure, and I'll need to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy... 
She pauses, wincing in sympathy. She turns to Hiccup. He nods knowingly, taking the map from her. 
HICCUP It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing. 
ASTRID I think you're missing the point. I mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be pretty excited. Hiccup shakes his head. 
HICCUP I'm not like you. You know exactly who you are. You always have. But... 
He shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) I'm still looking. I know that I'm not my father... and I never met my mother... so, what does that make me? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 14. 
He sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless. Astrid approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out at the distant horizon. She weaves another braid into his hair as she speaks. 
ASTRID What you're searching for... isn't out there, Hiccup.

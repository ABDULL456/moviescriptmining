DEVARONA Married but separated, ex-LAPD.  The fam doesn't live here, but they're coming up today.  I got his address there. 
MANELLI The cops I talked to, they said Talley was a hostage negotiator in LA. 
DEVARONA His last three years on the job.  Before that, he was SWAT. 
Mike Ruiz joins in -- 
RUIZ How's a SWAT negotiator make it up here to this shithole? 
DEVARONA I make him for a stress release. 
HOWELL Good work, Gayle--everybody.  Now stay ahead of the curve.  I want to know everything that happens before it happens.  I'll cover Talley. 
Howell tears Talley's address off the yellow pad.  This meeting is over -- 
SEYMORE What if it goes south? 
HOWELL What do you mean? 
SEYMORE If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end. 
HOWELL You worry about your end.  I got my side covered. 
Howell tucks the address in his pocket and goes to the door. 
EXT. DONUT SHOP -- NEWHALL, CALIFORNIA -- NIGHT 
The sun has set.  The donut shop glows greasily at the end of a strip mall.  It is empty except for the overweight woman behind the counter and a lone man seated at a window booth -- 
INT. THE DONUT SHOP -- NIGHT 
The man in the booth is named Marion Clewes.  He's an average looking guy, more or less, except for the strange cant to his right eye and the thin black tie he wears over his white J. C. Penney shirt.  His jacket doesn't fit quite right, but not so much as you'd notice.  Marion could disappear into a crowd just by being so ordinary.  That's the point. 
A fat black desert fly, heavy with juice and thorny with coarse hair, buzzes past -- 
Marion watches it, only his eyes moving -- 
The fly lands in the sprinkles of sugar on the table -- 
Marion watches it, then, suddenly, with no warning, his hand flashes out, slamming down on the table. 
He holds his hand in place, feeling for movement, then slowly peeks under his hand -- 
The fly oozes sideways, legs kicking, trying to walk.  One wing beats furiously; the other is broken -- 
Marion examines his hand.  A smear of fly goo and a single black leg streaks his third finger.  Marion touches his tongue to the smear -- 
The woman behind the counter watches this, her eyes widening with disgust -- 
Marion holds the fly in place with his left index finger, and uses his right to break away another leg.  He eats this leg, too -- 
The woman disappears into the rear -- 
Headlights flash across the glass, and Marion swivels around to see Howell's Mercedes pull up -- 
Marion carefully pushes the still-alive fly aside as Glen Howell takes a seat across from him.  Howell puts the yellow slip with Talley's address on the table -- 
HOWELL Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not. 
MARION It won't be a problem. 
HOWELL He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him. 
MARION Okey-doke. 
HOWELL We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him. 
Marion puts Talley's address into his pocket. 
MARION Can we make him dead after we use him? 
Glen Howell slides out of the booth without answering. Marion creeps him out -- 
HOWELL Whatever you want.  Page me when you're done. 
Howell starts away, then turns back -- 
HOWELL (CONT'D) Donuts here any good? 
MARION I don't eat junk food. 
Howell frowns like he might've known, then walks away. Marion turns back to the fly -- 
It lays there, still, until Marion prods it.  The remaining wing flutters -- 
Marion breaks off the remaining wing and eats that, too. 
EXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT 
Talley and Leigh Metzger stride through a pool of street light as she reports -- 
METZGER PacBell shows six lines into the house. They blocked all six like you wanted.

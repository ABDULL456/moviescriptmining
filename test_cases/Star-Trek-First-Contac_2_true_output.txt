He points to the sky. 
PICARD Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...? 
SCRIMM Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force. (beat) And you are? 
PICARD Jean-Luc Picard. 
SCRIMM Great name. French? 
PICARD Yes. 
SCRIMM You don't sound French. 
Scrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never leave Picard. 
PICARD I was raised in England and here in the States. Thank you for the... no zone. 
Picard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any citizens of the town. Scrimm falls in next to him. 
SCRIMM Where in the States? 
PICARD Oh... here and there. You know how it is. 
SCRIMM Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel. 
He casually steps in front of Picard, blocking his way. 
SCRIMM Where are you from most recently? 
PICARD (thinking fast) California. San Francisco. 
SCRIMM Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there. 
PICARD There's a few of us left. 
Picard steps around him and continues walking down the street. Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him again. 
SCRIMM That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it? 
PICARD It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer. 
SCRIMM Huh. 
He steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but a little bit of a smile fading from his face. Picard realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily. 
SCRIMM And what were you doing out at the missile silo? 
PICARD I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing. 
SCRIMM Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now. 
PICARD Yes. 
SCRIMM Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning... 
PICARD I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst. 
Scrimm eyes him evenly. 
SCRIMM You seem to have an answer for everything. 
PICARD Something wrong with that? 
SCRIMM Not yet. 
A tense beat. Then Scrimm smiles easily. 
SCRIMM (re: balm) Be sure you put that on. You need a lot of protection around here. 
He holds Picard's eyes for a moment. 
PICARD Thank you. But I've never had much trouble protecting myself. 
Now it's Picard's turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm. Picard walks around him and heads for the gates. Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression -- clearly, he's more than a little suspicious...

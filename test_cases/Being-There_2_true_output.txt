PRESIDENT (CONT'D) ... So what does all that add up to? 
KAUFMAN Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer. 
PRESIDENT (with sarcasm) I would appreciate that. 
The Aides quickly leave the office. 
INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING 
Chance is in bed, a bed tray on his lap, eating breakfast. A pile of the morning's newspapers lies at the foot of the bed, untouched. The TV is playing, Chance watches as he eats. There is a knock at the door. 
CHANCE (without turning from TV) Come in! 
Eve enters, wearing a robe over her nightgown. 
EVE Chauncey! Have you seen the papers? 
CHANCE No, Eve. I don't read the papers. 
EVE (moving to bed) Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's. 
CHANCE I like the President. He is a very nice man. 
EVE (sits on bed) I know... (a moment) ... So are you, Chauncey ... (another moment, Chance watches TV) ... Do you mind my being here, like this? 
CHANCE (a bite of toast) No, Eve. I like you to be here. 
Eve smiles, moves a little closer to Chance. 
EVE ... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be... (with difficulty) I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...? 
CHANCE Yes, Eve. I know that. 
Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then losing control, the tears flowing freely. To comfort her, Chance puts his arm around her shoulder, nearly tipping his breakfast tray. Eve responds to his touch, draws closer, holds Chance tightly. Chance does his best to avoid spilling his breakfast, keep an eye on the TV, and to comfort Eve. She gives in to her desires, begins to caress Chance, running her hand over his body. She kisses him, his eyes, his neck, his lips, his ears. Chance does not return the lovemaking, and Eve eventually catches hold of herself, stops. She lies quietly beside Chance for a time, regains her demeanor, then speaks. 
EVE ... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that... (Chance,confused, turns to her) ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint... 
CHANCE Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open. 
EVE I know you are, Chauncey... (a pause) ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love. 
CHANCE (another bite of toast) Yes. That could be true. 
EVE (sits up) ... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until... 
Eve cannot bring herself to finish the sentence. She rises, straightens her robe and moves toward the door. 
EVE (CONT'D) (stopping by door) ... I do love you, Chauncey. 
A knock at the door startles Eve. She turns, opens it to MAGGIE, the seam tress. Maggie carries one of Rand's tuxedos. 
EVE (CONT'D) Oh, come in, Maggie. 
MAGGIE (entering) Yes, ma'am. 
EVE Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben's tuxedo for you now. 
CHANCE Fine. 
Eve leaves. Maggie stands by patiently as Chance eats his once-warm scrambled eggs and watches"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood" on TV. 
INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S ROOM - DAY 
Allenby is at his desk, searching through the Washington, D.C. telephone book. He finds a number, dials. 
ALLENBY (into phone) Mr. Thomas Franklin, please. (a wait) Is Thomas Franklin in? (a beat) Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby, would you please tell Mr. Franklin that I would like to talk to him? It concerns Chauncey Gardiner. 
INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK 
Teresa and Constance work in a corner of the room. Rand is in bed, very still, deep in thought. 
EXT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING 
The RAND 1 limousine pulls up to Sophie's house. Jeffrey opens the door for Eve and Chance. He wears Ben's tuxedo, Eve is in a formal gown. The press is waiting, a couple of reporters, 5 photographers and a mini-cam crew from local TV station gather around Eve and Chance. 
REPORTER #1 Mr. Gardiner, what did you think of the Post's editorial on the President's speech?

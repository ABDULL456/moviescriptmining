Now we have a fight! \nValka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper, commanding swarms of dragons to swoop down and attack Drago's army. A swarm of Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and destroying war machines. \nOne of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter, but Hiccup and Toothless double-back for a rescue. \nHICCUP There! Come on, Toothless! Show them what you got, bud. Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a plasma bolt, freeing the dragon. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Thatta boy! \nBACK TO VALKA, on Cloudjumper as they pry Drago's armored dragons off of the flailing wild ones.

Take down the alpha! \nValka attacks Drago with her bullhook, trying to stop his commands, but Drago strikes back, knocking her forcefully onto her back. He pins her as she struggles, removing her mask and staff. He's about to finish her off, when WHAM! He's knocked to the ground. He looks up, fuming, to see Stoick helping Valka to her feet. \nVALKA Thank you. \nSTOICK For you, my dear... anything. HTTYD 2 (D.

Come on, Cloudjumper! \nValka cuts the nets away and hops onto Cloudjumper, flying off toward the Bewilderbeasts as they charge each other, \nCLASHING TUSKS. \nDrago LUNGES at Stoick, SWIPING his bullhook. \nDRAGO You...

Berk's now commandeered dragons circle in a huddle behind him, joining Valka's flock, and corralled by Drago's armored dragons. \nHICCUP No... \nFISHLEGS He took all the dragons! \nHICCUP \n(FUMING) Distract the alpha.

Hiccup clamps his hands over Toothless' ear plates, muffling the alpha's commands. \nHICCUP Shut it out, Toothless! \nDRAGO \nSTOP THEM! \nThe Bewilderbeast BLASTS! \nHICCUP \nNOW! \nToothless suddenly PULLS UP, ARCING over Drago's head! Drago LAUGHS, victorious, then pauses in shock. \nDRAGO'S POV: as Toothless climbs inverted through the sky, the blindfold falls free, revealing an EMPTY SADDLE. \nDrago WHIRLS around, wide-eyed, to see... \nHICCUP ZOOMING TOWARD HIM, his wing-suit deployed, and his Dragon Blade trailing Zippleback gas. Drago SWIPES but misses him. Hiccup clicks the lighter and ignites the gas, blasting Drago off his Bewilderbeast with a SCREAM. \nDrago PLUMMETS, BREAKING HIS FALL against the massive dragon's spines and landing hard on the ground, his bullhook landing just out of reach. \nThe Bewilderbeast WHIPS its tail, trying to SWAT down Hiccup.

No... \nON ASTRID and GOBBER, watching from a distance, horrified. As Valka POUNDS at the ice, a GLOWS forms from deep within. She realizes what is about to happen and backs away. \nA BLAST thunders from inside the ice, SHATTERING it.

He leaps out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire, roaring ferociously. \nThe Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront.

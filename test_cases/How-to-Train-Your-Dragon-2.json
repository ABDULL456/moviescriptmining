{"train": "HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2 \nWritten by \nDean DeBlois \nInspired by the novels by \nCressida Cowell \nFinal Draft May 5th, 2014 \nEXT. OPEN SEA - DAY \nHiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST, leaving a wake that leads... \nEXT. BERK - DAY \n(Sequence 0200 - New Berk) To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline. \nHICCUP (V.O.) This... is Berk. The best kept secret this side of, well, anywhere. Granted, it may not look like much, but this wet heap of rock packs more than a few surprises. \nON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one, receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air! \nHICCUP (V.O.) Life here is amazing, just not for the faint of heart. See, where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer a little something we like to call-- \nWHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by. DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE, KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk. \nHICCUP (V.O.) \nDRAGON RACING! \nIt's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race. Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff faces and perched over the sea. \nFISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG, who carries the sheep in her claws, until... \nSNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 2. \nSNOTLOUT Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you want that? \nFISHLEGS Snotlout! That's mine! Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH. \nSNOTLOUT Here ya go, babe. With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut. She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE. \nSNOTLOUT (CONT'D) Did I tell you that you look amazing today? `Cause you do. \nRUFFNUT Come on, Barf. It's starting to stink around here. Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout with a mugging grin. \nTUFFNUT Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow this place, Belch! Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke. As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep. Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd. \nSTOICK That's nine for the Twins, Astrid lags with three, Fishlegs and Snotlout trail with NONE! Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard painted with an image of Toothless. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) And Hiccup is... nowhere to be found. Hmmm. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3. \nGOBBER Scared him off with the big talk, didn't ya, Stoick? WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY -- spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite herself. \nASTRID What are you doing, Snotlout?! They're going to win now! \nSNOTLOUT She's my princess! Whatever she wants, she gets. \nASTRID Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury you alive?! \nSNOTLOUT Only for a few hours! BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed. \nHICCUP (V.O.) Dragons used to be a bit of a problem here. But that was five years ago. Now they've all moved in. And, really, why wouldn't they? The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon stables. They exit through the far side and circle back through the village, blasting past many of its dragon- friendly additions. \nHICCUP (V.O.) We have custom stables... all-you- can-eat feeding stations... a full service dragon wash... \nIn the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting one of the Viking houses aflame. \nHICCUP (V.O.) Even top-of-the-line fire prevention, if I do say so myself. Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4. \nBACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods. \nSTOICK It's time, Gobber. \nGOBBER Righty-ho! (aloud, to the crowd) Last lap! A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Ready? Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically. Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets. \nToothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face- to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself. Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS... and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily. But he's flying! Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup. The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline. Independently together. They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then crossing paths again. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8. \nImpressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle. Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him higher with the expanding heat bursts. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) This is amazing! A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK FORMATION, dead ahead. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) No longer amazing! Toothless! Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail. Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Oh, no! At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them. Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau. Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and stows his leather wings. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) That really came out of nowhere. The blown up sea stack collapses. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) We gotta work on your solo gliding there, bud. That locked-up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh? Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet, revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete with a Viking braid. He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea- stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the dappled afternoon sunlight. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Looks like we found another one, bud. Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and pebbles like a wet dog. Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Oh, what? Do you want an apology? Is that why you're pouting, big baby boo? Well... try this on! Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up on all my heartfelt remorse? Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a \nONE-LEGGED-- \nHiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) You're right! You're right! You win! You win! WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground. Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons and Vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter -- URFFF! Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup, lapping at his face and covering him in slobber. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Gaaaaagh! \nHiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and shaking off the viscous saliva. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 10. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) You KNOW that doesn't wash out. \nToothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself. \nShifting his attention back to the new land stretched out before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and produces a leather-bound book. \nHe unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new dragons. Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick. Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge, then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his forearm. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) So what should we name it? Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \"Itchy Armpit\" it is. Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might find a few Timberjacks in those woods? The odd Whispering Death or two in the rocks? Who knows... maybe we'll finally track down another Night Fury. \n(BEAT) Wouldn't that be something? \n(BURDENED) So, whaddya say? Just keep going? Toothless' ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP. He ROARS, and his call is answered by a familiar SCREECH. Hiccup turns to see... \nEXT. SEA STACK/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY \n(Scene 0325 - AWOL Part Two) \nASTRID rising into view, astride Stormfly. Stormfly grabs talon-fulls of rock to slow her landing. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 11. \nHICCUP `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you been? \nAstrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless rushes up to greet them. \nASTRID Winning races. What else? The real question is... where have YOU been? \nHICCUP Avoiding my dad. \nASTRID Oh, no. What happened now? \nAstrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a play fight. \nHICCUP Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop. I saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world, and I get... \nHe gets to his feet and puffs out his chest. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \nShe places a hand on his chest. \nASTRID (CONT'D) It's in here. \n(BEAT) Maybe you just don't see it yet. \nShe kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless' slobber. She grimaces, wiping it off. \nDistracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly. \nHICCUP Maybe. But, y'know... there is something out there. \nASTRID \n(EXASPERATED) Hiccup... \nHe turns her face to the horizon. A distant smoke plume rises from a misty valley. \nEXT. LAPLAND WOODS/TRAPPER'S FORT - MOMENTS LATER \n(Scene 0400 - Shot Down!) Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through undulating crimson and gold forests. \nAstrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly give way to charred timbers. They fly deeper, through ash and wafting smoke. Ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPER'S \nFORT. \nHICCUP Stay close. \nThey fly through the suspended remains of the buildings, splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) What happened here? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 15. \nIt's at once harrowing and puzzling. Toothless spots an enormous DRAGON FOOTPRINT in the muddy shoreline below, leaving him uneasy. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Easy, bud. \nAs they crest the ice formations, Astrid spots a CREW OF MEN at the stern of a moored ship below. \nASTRID Hiccup! \nERET (O.S.) Fire! \nThe men fire a stern-mounted cannon. The projectile unfurls into a NET. Hiccup and Toothless dart out of its way. \nHICCUP Astrid! Look out! \nIt HITS Stormfly, TANGLING her wings and causing her to spin uncontrolled. Astrid struggles to free her as they HURTLE toward a collision. \nASTRID \nHICCUP! \nAstrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at the last second. \nStormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She whips her tail, sending spikes flying. \nERET Watch the tail! \nA large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes and lands upon Stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her down like a rodeo cowboy. \nERET (CONT'D) Tie those legs up! \nEret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into submission -- clearly a pro among pros. He looks up, revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that search the sky as Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream rings out. \nERET (CONT'D) Is that what I think it is? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 16. \nToothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and landing with a FEROCIOUS ROAR. \nHICCUP \nSTOP! \nASTRID \nSTORMFLY! (to the trappers) What are you doing? \nAstrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward Stormfly. \nYOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE \nDRAGONS, YOU HEAR ME?! DRAGO IS \nCOMING FOR THEM ALL! \nI/E. BERK/BLACKSMITH STALL - SUNSET \n(Sequence 0500 - Lock-Down!) HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 19. \nThe GANG joyrides past GOTHI'S house, scattering her assortment of terrible terrors. She waves a fist at them as they sweep past, WHOOPING AND CHORTLING, leading us down to... \nTHE UPPER PLAZA, where a GATHERED CROWD of Vikings and their dragons are cued up outside of Gobber's BLACKSMITH STALL, awaiting their turns. Stoick maneuvers through the crowd, spouting JOVIAL GREETINGS in passing. \nHe makes a bee-line for GOBBER, who is busily grinding a metal dragon tooth into shape. A Zippleback waits patiently, his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head watches, sympathetically. \nSTOICK Any sign of him? \nGobber flips up his welding guard, revealing a matching area of unsoiled skin. \nGOBBER Ah, he's probably flown off the edge of the world by now. You sure you want that kid running the village? You can still delay your retirement. \nSTOICK Oh, he's ready. You'll see. \nA SUDDEN EXCITEMENT in the crowd heralds Hiccup and Astrid's return. They touch down on Toothless and Stormfly. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Haha! There he is! (to Gobber, proving his \nPOINT) Huh? The pride of Berk! \nHiccup stows his helmet and heads toward Stoick with urgency. \nGOBBER Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay. \nHICCUP Sorry. Got held up. (privately, to Stoick) Hey, Dad, could I have a word? \nSTOICK Something you're itching to tell me? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 20. \nHICCUP Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes. \nStoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk. \nSTOICK Good man! Now, lesson one. A chief's first duty is to his people. So... \nStoick changes the rune on the \"being served\" placard. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Forty one? Forty -- \nHICCUP Could we just talk in private for-- \nSTARKARD --That's me! That's me! I'm next! (pushing his way through) I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've been here all day! \nSTARKARD reaches the counter, giddy with excitement. \nSTARKARD (CONT'D) Okay, I want one of those high seaters, with lots of spikes and a big stowage compartment. \nSTOICK Absolutely! You got it, sir! \nStoick spins Hiccup around, steering him back into the shop. \nHICCUP Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles. \nSTOICK Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too small when it comes to serving your people. Excuse us, Grump. \nThey step over the tail of a large, snoring oaf of a dragon, stirring him awake with a fussy start. \nGOBBER Grump! You let the forge die down again! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 21. \nGrump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge. It splatters everywhere, igniting a rash of fires. Hiccup side- steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall. Gobber pulls the fire extinguisher, dumping water everywhere. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) That's it, Grump. You're going up for adoption! \nStoick fills a toolbox with tools from Hiccup's workbench. \nSTOICK One of these. And this... \nHICCUP \nToothless paws at the embers. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Once they see you as one of their own, even the testiest dragons can be trained, right, bud? \nToothless gurgles and falls over. \nERET Give me that! \nEret snatches the dragon blade and HURLS it overboard. Stormfly bolts after it... \nERET (CONT'D) What game are you playing? \nHICCUP No game. We just want to meet Drago. \nAnd returns in a flash, dropping it at Eret's feet like a fetching dog, tongue wagging. Eret throws it again, frustrated. Stormfly returns with it just as quickly. \nERET Why? \nHICCUP Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons. \nEret and his crew LAUGH. Astrid pokes out of the well. \nASTRID He can be really persuasive. \nHiccup pets Toothless, thoughtfully. \nHICCUP Once you've earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won't do for you. \nERET Puh! You won't be changing any minds around here. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 29. \nHICCUP I can change yours. Right here. Right now. \nHiccup sets Toothless' tail in the locked, splayed position. Eret sneers, suspicious. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) May I? \nSuddenly, Hiccup is snatched into the air! Dragons blur past. \nI/E. OPEN SEA - SHIP - SUNSET \n(Scene 1000 - Botched Rescue) \nThe crewmen SCRAMBLE to the NET CANNONS as a FLURRY OF WINGS streak past, GASHING holes in the sails and SLICING through rigging. \nERET Dragon riders! \nToothless SHRIEKS and bounds up the mast, spotting Hiccup in the talons of a Monstrous Nightmare. Toothless relaxes, realizing that it's Hookfang. \nHICCUP Put me down! Snotlout! What are you doing? \nSnotlout looks back to see if Ruffnut witnessed the save. \nSNOTLOUT See how well I protect and provide? Ruffnut GRUMBLES at the incessant courting. A FLYING NET whizzes past her head. \nTUFFNUT Aggh! What is with all the nets?! \nRUFFNUT Hey watch it! That was close... \nRuffnut spots Eret, FIRING nets from the deck of the ship. \nTRANSITION TO: \nA SLOW MOTION, sexy POV of Eret's glistening biceps, shuddering as he BLASTS the net cannon, aimed directly at her. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 30. \nRUFFNUT (CONT'D) Oh, my. \nThe net unravels in SLOW MOTION... \nRUFFNUT (CONT'D) Me likey. \n... enveloping Ruffnut as she yields to it, blissfully. \nRUFFNUT (CONT'D) Take me. \nBACK TO REAL TIME \nAs Hiccup FLIPS upside-down in the Hookfang's talons and KICKS off, pulling his wing-suit flaps. \nRUFFNUT Stupid. \nTUFFNUT Good one. \nSTOICK Aye. We laughed, too... \nBACK TO FLASHBACK \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Until he wrapped himself in his cloak and cried out, \"Then see how well you do without me!\" \nDrago Bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and marches toward the door. Above, dragon fire rips through the ceiling, bringing down flaming timbers, followed by dragons covered in heavy metallic armor. They BLAST FIRE as panic ensues. \nSTOICK (V.O.) The rooftop suddenly burst into flames, and from it, armored dragons descended, burning the hall to the ground. \nBACK TO PRESENT HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 33. \nSTOICK \n(STINGING REGRET) I... was to only one to escape. \nThe Twins, Snotlout, and Fishlegs exchange spooked glances. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) \n(TO HICCUP) Men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with. \nHICCUP Maybe. \nHiccup turns and stomps toward Toothless, determined. Eret watches intently. \nSTOICK Hiccup... \nHICCUP I'm still going to try. \nHiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) This is what I'm good at. And if I could change your mind... I can change his, too. \n(TO TOOTHLESS) Come on. \nToothless and Hiccup TAKE TO THE AIR, leaving everyone stirring in awkward silence. \nAstrid mounts Stormfly, about to go after him. \nASTRID Let's go. \nSTOICK NO! Lead the others back to Berk. I've had enough mutiny for one day. \nAstrid stirs, conflicted, as Stoick stomps toward Skullcrusher, fuming. He passes Ruffnut, who's busily fondling Eret's biceps as he lays crushed under Grump. \nRUFFNUT Ooh, I like that. \nSTOICK Ruffnut! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 34. \nRUFFNUT \n(PETULANT) Ugh! Okay! \nEXT. SKY - NIGHT \n(Scene 1100 - Ambushed!) Hiccup stares ahead, frustrated, as Toothless glides over a bed of clouds, glowing in the low, Arctic sun. Hiccup YELLS, then slumps back onto the saddle. Toothless recoils, sensitive to Hiccup's upset. The steam from their breath mixes in the frigid air. \nHICCUP Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise. Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds. A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds, standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in the buffeting turbulence. The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery and sits up, flustered. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \nAW, COME ON, DAD! REALLY?! He whirls around expectantly then FREEZES, mouth agape. The warrior stares blankly, tilting his head in curiosity while cutting a menacing silhouette. Then, just as gradually as he rose, the warrior dips back beneath the clouds, disappearing. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \n(ALARMED) Okay. \n(TO TOOTHLESS) No sudden moves. Suddenly, the warrior EXPLODES out of the clouds before them, standing atop a large dragon. They circle Hiccup and Toothless, forcing them to TREAD AIR. \nThe warrior points a staff toward Hiccup, unnervingly, as he returns to face them. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 35. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Hold on, hold on. Toothless GROWLS a warning. Suddenly, they're ambushed from behind. Hiccup is plucked off of Toothless by another DRAGON and carried off. \nThe warrior slowly removes the strange mask, revealing VALKA, 40, beneath. Her eyes meet his, equally wide-eyed and aghast. \nVALKA ... but a mother never forgets. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 38. \nHiccup stammers, tongue-tied, aghast. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Come... \nEXT. ARCTIC SKY - NIGHT (MIDNIGHT SUN) \n(Sequence 1325 - Searching) \nStoick and Gobber search over the frigid waves that lap against the pack ice. \nSTOICK Boar-headed! Just like his mother! She could never stay put either. \nGobber glances over at Stoick, who's hunched over, brow furrowed and solemn. \nGOBBER Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking. I mean, could there be a worse combination? Ha! When I think of how stubborn and senseless YOU were back in the day... well, not much has changed, actually. \nSTOICK You know what he's like. He won't give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup finds Drago, before we find him... \nGOBBER Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so long as that Night Fury's around. It's a Night Fury! Framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the surface below. Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK, leading Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it. Stoick SNAGS it out of the water. It's Hiccup's helmet. \nGobber pulls alongside Stoick, seeing his look of dread. Stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to SMELL. \nSTOICK Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him. \nSkullcrusher SNIFFS the helmet like a bloodhound, ROARS, and suddenly CHANGES HEADING. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 39. \nINT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - TUNNEL - DAWN \n(Scene 1400 - A New Family) \nCLOSE ON Hiccup, flustered, winded, chasing VALKA through tightly winding corridors. \nHICCUP Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come back here! \nVALKA This way. Come. \nHICCUP You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my mother?! I mean, what the -- do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?! \n(BEAT) I have questions! \nVALKA Come. Quickly! \nHiccup follows her over the difficult terrain. He tries to clamber over a tall rock, unsuccessfully. \nHICCUP Where have you been all this time? \nToothless boosts him over. Hiccup lands on the other side. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) What've you been doing?! They said you were dead! Everyone thinks you were eaten by... Hiccup trails off as he enters... \nINT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - OASIS - CONTINUOUS \n... a stadium-sized chamber teeming with ferns, waterfalls, hot springs and THOUSANDS of new DRAGONS. \nHiccup wanders in, basking in the in the amazing sight: a dome of sweating ice capping a geothermal micro climate, filled with dragons of every shape and kind. \nHe spots Valka clinging to a basalt overhang, watching him. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 40. \nHICCUP This is where you've been for twenty years? \nShe nods from her perch. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) You've been rescuing them. \nShe nods again, this time with a smile. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Unbelievable. \nVALKA You're not upset? \nHICCUP What? No. I don't know. It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady. \nValka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself to the ground like a skilled acrobat. \nFLASHBACK CONTINUED \nCloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof, sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner. \nValka rushes in, panicked. \nVALKA (V.O.) One night, a dragon broke into our house, finding you in the cradle. \nValka draws a sword quietly, slipping up to the dragon, only to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as BABY HICCUP innocently plays with one of its talons. \nVALKA (V.O.) I rushed to protect you, but what I saw... was proof of everything I believed. \nValka's careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak. Spooked, Cloudjumper whips around to face her, accidentally SCRATCHING baby Hiccup's chin. \nTheir eyes meet. Valka lowers her sword, transfixed. \nVALKA (V.O.) This wasn't a vicious beast, but an intelligent, gentle creature, whose soul reflected my own. \nStoick's AXE spins through the air between them, barely missing Cloudjumper and planting into a pillar. \nSTOICK Valka, run! \nAlarmed, Cloudjumper WHIRLS around at Stoick and BLASTS! \nStoick DIVES out of the way as the FIRE SPLATTERS against the wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze. \nThe dragon moves toward Stoick, but Valka grabs hold. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 44. \nVALKA Don't! \nIt turns to face her again, locking eyes, agitated. \nSTOICK Hold on! \nStoick dashes through the fire toward Hiccup and pulls him out of the cradle. He pulls his axe from the pillar... \nVALKA (O.S.) No! Stoick! \n... but in a WHOOSH of smoke and embers, the dragon and Valka are GONE. \nSTOICK \nVALKA! \nVALKA \n(DISTANT) Stoick! \nStoick and baby Hiccup watch helplessly as the dragon spirits Valka away into the night sky. \nSTOICK Valka... \nON BABY HICCUP'S FACE, with the fresh nick on his chin... \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - DAWN \nPRESENT DAY \nHICCUP'S FACE, with the matching scar. \nVALKA You and your father nearly died that night, all because I couldn't kill a dragon. \nHICCUP Yeah, it runs in the family. \nVALKA It broke my heart to stay away, but I believed you'd be safer if I did. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 45. \nHiccup considers this, then raises his eyes to hers, seeing the sting of remorse. \nHICCUP How did you survive? \nVALKA Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm me. He must've thought I belonged here... \nShe leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace, overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring waterfalls. Half-submerged in the warm lake below, a massive white dragon with pronounced, mammoth-like tusks rests benevolently on the banks, his stately countenance like that of a lion surrounded by his pride. \nVALKA (CONT'D) In the home of the great Bewilderbeast. The alpha species. One of very few that still exist. \nShe pulls him into a hug -- forceful, bursting with emotion. Hiccup hugs Valka back. They share a cathartic moment, before Hiccup peels away from her. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) This is so great! Now you and I can go talk to Drago -- together! \nShe chuckles, incredulous. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 53. \nVALKA What? There's no talking to Drago. \nHICCUP But we have to -- \nVALKA -- No. We must protect our own. \nHiccup stares, exasperated by the familiar line. Cloudjumper lumbers over, eager to be rid of Toothless' puppy-like energy. Valka pets him. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Now come on, we should be getting back. \nBefore Hiccup can say anymore, he hear heavy breathing next to him, and looks over to see Toothless with a gaping grin, clapping his dorsal blades. \nEXT. ICE CAVE - DAY \n(Scene 1350 - Meet Drago) \nAstrid and the gang stealthily approach a cluster of tabular icebergs, collapsed against each other at the mouth of a maze. Stormfly drops Eret to the snow, but before he can flee, she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg. \nERET Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now get this thing off me! \nASTRID Never take a toy from a dragon. Don't you know anything? \nStormfly crushes him in place under her weight. \nERET \n(STRAINED) Gah! Why does this keep happening to me? \nAstrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal... \nA MASSIVE FLOTILLA, moored together like a floating camp in the deep water between collided icebergs. \nThick chains run deep into the water, where great blasts of bubbles erupt on the surface. The unseen creature rocks the ships. Its effect alone describes it as gargantuan. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 54. \nASTRID What's down there? \nFishlegs rifles through his note cards contained in his belt pouch. \nFISHLEGS Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm thinking class five leviathan, maybe six. \nSuddenly, Stormfly is alerted to an encroaching menace and takes wing. BLOW DARTS whiz through the air, hitting the other dragons. The effect is immediate -- they fall to the ground, unconscious. Drugged. \nHICCUP Meatlug! What's wrong, girl? \nEret spring to his feet and draws his blades. Astrid and the Gang find themselves surrounded by soldiers, camouflaged in polar bear furs, and poised to fire darts. They're outnumbered. Fishlegs raises his hands, dropping the cards. \nEXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - DECK - MOMENTS LATER \nDRAGO BLUDVIST, a hulking figure draped in a dragon skin cloak, crouches over the prow of the fleet's grisly flagship, adorned in massive dragon bones and skulls. His scarred face is masked by thick, grizzled dreadlocks. \nERET (O.S.) \nDRAGO! \nDrago turns to see Astrid, Eret, and the Gang being forcibly escorted onto the deck. Eret SHAKES HIMSELF FREE. \nERET (CONT'D) Get off me! \nIn the background, a sledge, loaded with Hookfang, Meatlug, Belch and Barf -- all unconscious -- is dragged onto the deck by armored dragons. \nERET (CONT'D) Always great to see you, my friend! Keeping warm up here? \nThe soldiers disarm him, pushing him forward as Drago approaches. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 55. \nERET (CONT'D) Well, as you can see, I'm right on time with a new batch of dragons, just like I promised. \nHookfang awakens, groggily shaking off the effect of the blow- dart. He rears as soldiers struggle to reign him in. \nSOLDIER #1 Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him steady! \nSOLDIER #2 Give me some backup here! \nASTRID And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters! \nEret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension. \nRUFFNUT Then they'll be crying like babies! \nSNOTLOUT Funny and beautiful. \nFISHLEGS Good one, babe! \nRuffnut groans, exasperated by their smarmy advances. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 58. \nTUFFNUT Yeah. Like babies. They always cry. Real tiny ones... \nDrago grabs Eret by the face and bears down on him. \nDRAGO First there was one rider. And now all of Berk. \n(TO ERET) And YOU led them to me. \nHe THROWS Eret across the deck. \nERET Drago! \nDRAGO \nCEASE ALL PREPARATIONS! WE MUST \nATTACK THE DRAGONS RIDER'S NEST AT \nONCE! \n(SAVORING IT) \nWE WILL TAKE DOWN THEIR ALPHA... \nAND THEN WE WILL TAKE BERK! \nSoldiers CHEER in the thousands. \nERET You're overreacting! \nDRAGO And get rid of him. \nERET Drago, please... \nThe soldiers HURL throwing knives at Eret... But Stormfly lands in a blur of wings, shielding Eret from the flurry of blades. She whips her tail, throwing spikes in all directions. \nASTRID \nSTORMFLY! \nStormfly ROARS protectively, hiding Eret within her wings, until a well-blown dart sinks into her neck, bringing her down... \nASTRID (CONT'D) \nNO! \nRevealing Eret, gawking in shock. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 59. \nINT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - OASIS - MORNING \n(Scene 1800 - Family Reunion) \nHiccup reattaches his flight suit while standing on a ledge overlooking the utopian nest, teeming with dragons. Several babies race in to hassle Toothless as he naps. \nHICCUP \n(DETERMINED) Well, bud, we can't wait around for Drago to attack this place. We've gotta find him first. Let's go. \nSuddenly, a thick hand clamps down over Hiccup's face -- muffling his scream! \nToothless whirls around to find STOICK, towering over Hiccup. He calms Toothless with a touch and releases Hiccup. \nSTOICK Easy now. \nHICCUP Are you kidding me? How'd you get in here? \nON DRAGO'S SHIP HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 62. \nEret, Astrid, and the Gang are escorted to the stern, surrounded by several of Drago's soldiers. Wrists bound. Spear tips pressed into their backs. \nSNOTLOUT Could this day get any worse? \nTUFFNUT Uh, let me see. You'll jump into freezing cold water and then die from drowning. \nThey reach the gang plank. Eret peers overboard at the deep, icy water below. \nERET Looks refreshing. \nHe turns to Astrid, meeting her glare with mock chivalry. \nERET (CONT'D) Please, ladies first. \nA pair of soldiers GRAB Astrid by the arms. \nASTRID You are a steaming heap of dragon -- \nERET -- Duck. \nEret WHIRLS around, ROUND-HOUSING both soldiers. They GO DOWN, heavily. \nHe catches one of their spears with his bound hands and slices his ropes free. They fall away as he catches the other spear, twirling both in invitation. \nSOLDIER Warn the others! \nOne soldier runs to send up the alarm... while the last two raise BLOW DART TUBES. \nEret SWIPES the first off of his legs, sending the dart into the neck of the second. \nRUFFNUT Get `em, you son of an Eret! \nAs the downed soldiers SCRAMBLE to their feet, Fishlegs FALLS OVER, CRUSHING them under his weight. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 63. \nEret CATCHES the falling tube from the second soldier and BLOWS the dart at the fleeing third. The soldier DROPS, unconscious -- just shy of the Captain's Quarters. \nRUFFNUT (CONT'D) Okay, I love you again. \nRuffnut skips past Snotlout on her way to Eret. Snotlout watches, crestfallen. \nTUFFNUT Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump. \nEret avoids Ruffnut and turns to Astrid. \nERET So? Are we going to save your dragons and get out of here or not? \nAstrid narrows her eyes, not knowing what to make of him. He reclaims his sword and dagger from the unconscious soldier who took them and cuts Tuffnut free. \nERET (CONT'D) Check every trap. They're here somewhere. \nEXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - MOMENTS LATER \nAstrid slips under a tarp and cranks open a metal trap. She peers between its massive iron teeth, discovering Meatlug within, bound and chained to its base as bait. \nASTRID Meatlug? \nON ERET \nCarefully cranking another trap, wincing at the sound. The iron jaws of the trap open wider with every CLICK. \nERET Anyone coming? \nRuffnut \"stands guard,\" fixated on Eret's rippling biceps. \nRUFFNUT I don't know. You just keep doing what you're doing. Keep crankin'... \nEret squeezes between the cocked teeth, finding Stormfly within, muzzled and chained. She looks up at Eret, calming immediately. He pauses, then approaches slowly. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 64. \nEret carefully reaches out and strokes Stormfly's muzzle. \nERET Thank you for saving my life. \n(BEAT) Now let me return the favor. \nINT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - VALKA'S LIVING QUARTERS - LATE \nSTOICK (CONT'D) And love... \nStoick hangs eagerly, awaiting her words, but Valka closes her eyes, rejecting his invitation. He lets out a heavy- hearted sigh. But nostalgia gets the better of Valka. She softly SINGS HER PART: \nVALKA \n(SINGING) And love me for eternity. \nStoick beams. She brushes past him, setting into the center of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation. Stoick crosses his forearm against hers, initiating a beautiful dance to accompany the song. \nVALKA (CONT'D) \n(SINGING) My dearest one, my darling dear, you mighty words astound me. But I've no need of mighty deeds, when I feel your arms around me. \nThe dance is full of charming missteps as Stoick and Valka recreate a moment from their past, before Hiccup's wonder- struck eyes. \nSTOICK \n(SINGING) But I would bring you rings of gold. I'd even sing you poetry. \n(MORE) HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 67. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) And I would keep you from all harm, if you'd stay here beside me. \nVALKA \n(SINGING) I have no use for rings of gold. I care not for your poetry. I only want your hand to hold. I only want you near me. \nGobber can't help himself. He drags Hiccup onto his feet so that he can join in the dancing, too. \nGOBBER C'mon, Hiccup! \nVALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER \n(SINGING) To love and kiss, to sweetly hold. For the dancing and the dreaming. Through all life's sorrows and delights, I'll keep your love inside me. \nHiccup is amazed by the sight of his giddy parents, spinning and laughing in each others' arms, reunited. \nVALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER (CONT'D) \n(SINGING) I'll swim and sail through savage seas, with ne'er a fear of drowning. And gladly ride the waves of life, if you will marry me! \nGobber carries the last note... \nGOBBER \n(SINGING) I'm still going... \nHiccup taps him. \nHICCUP Gobber! \nGOBBER I'm done. \nValka and Stoick slow to a stop, WINDED and LAUGHING. \nSTOICK Ah... I thought I'd have to die before we'd have that dance again. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 68. \nVALKA No need for drastic measures. \nSTOICK For you, my dear... anything. \nShe smiles sweetly. Stoick's eyes well with tears. He goes down on one knee, proposing to her anew. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Will you come home, Val? Will you be my wife once again? \nToothless nudges Valka closer to Stoick. They laugh as Hiccup joins them. Stoick throws his arm around him. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) We can be a family! What do you say? \nValka, between tears and laughter, turns to Hiccup. \nVALKA Yes! \nGobber pops his head in. \nGOBBER Great! I'll do the cooking! \nTUFFNUT Dragon Riders coming through! \nAnd DIVE-BOMB the traps, setting them aflame. The yokes and leather bindings restraining the bait dragons are incinerated, freeing them to fly away, unharmed. \nDRAGO \nCUT THEM DOWN! \nProjectiles are launched, one of which KNOCKS Ruffnut off her dragon. She PLUMMETS past Eret toward the rocky shore below. \nRUFFNUT Eret, son of Eret! \nShe suddenly grabbed by both arms before hitting the rocks. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 71. \nRUFFNUT'S POV: of Snotlout on one side... and Fishlegs on the other. SOFT and ROMANTICIZED as her epiphany dawns. \nAbove them, more catapults fire, bringing down massive spires of ice, directly over Astrid and Eret. \nASTRID Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's it! Look out! \nIt's about to crush them when... it's BLOWN TO PIECES by Toothless' fireball. Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber come bursting through the flames on their dragons. \nHiccup and Toothless arc across the sky triumphantly and set their sights on a downed dragon surrounded by soldiers. \nToothless BLASTS one of Drago's net launchers, knocking it onto its side. Stoick then CHOPS the trigger line, FIRING the catapult and NETTING the throng of soldiers, freeing the dragon. \nDrago's ARCHERS target Stoick with their arrows. \nARCHER Take `em down! \nGOBBER Heads up! \nGobber flies up from behind, KNOCKING the archers out with Grump's tail. Gobber chuckles. \nDRAGO hears Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream and turns to see him streaking across the sky. \nDRAGO Dragon Master. \nHiccup catches up to Astrid and Eret on Stormfly. \nHICCUP Welcome aboard, dragon rider! \nERET Thanks. I think. \nAstrid glares, both relieved and annoyed to see Hiccup. \nASTRID Where have you been? \nHICCUP Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 72. \nAstrid shoots him a confused glare. He nods skyward. Astrid and Eret look up to see... \nVALKA, in full warrior garb, rising from the towering ice spikes, atop Cloudjumper. \nERET Whoa... \nAn earth-trembling roar follows as the Bewilderbeast rises behind Valka. \nASTRID That's your mother?! \nHICCUP Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair. \nON DRAGO, gawking in awe as the great BEWILDERBEAST BLASTS an epic explosion of ice upon the attackers. \nDRAGO The alpha! Now we have a fight! \nValka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper, commanding swarms of dragons to swoop down and attack Drago's army. A swarm of Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and destroying war machines. \nOne of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter, but Hiccup and Toothless double-back for a rescue. \nHICCUP There! Come on, Toothless! Show them what you got, bud. Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a plasma bolt, freeing the dragon. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Thatta boy! \nBACK TO VALKA, on Cloudjumper as they pry Drago's armored dragons off of the flailing wild ones. A net suddenly envelops Cloudjumper. They CRASH heavily, but Valka cuts herself free, sliding to a stop just paces away from Drago. \nDRAGO I've waited a long time for this! \nDrago points his bullhook toward Valka and Cloudjumper. \nDRAGO (CONT'D) Now finish her! \nStoick whirls around, spotting Valka and Cloudjumper in the alpha's sights. \nSTOICK No! \nDrago's Bewilderbeast INHALES... and BLASTS! Valka steers Cloudjumper out of the way, but ice HITS his tail, causing them to SPIRAL out of control toward the icy spires. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Hold on! \nHe LEAPS onto Skullcrusher, spurring him into the air. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber! \nStoick tosses the mace back to Gobber in passing, who follows brazenly, waving it aloft. \nGOBBER Right behind ya, Stoick! \nEXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS \n(Scene 2000 - Stoick's Sacrifice) \nWith his tail impaired, Cloudjumper struggles against a throng of oncoming dragons. Valka is knocked off, but manages to cling to her dragon's neck. As she loses her grip and FALLS... \nStoick LEAPS from Skullcrusher and CATCHES Valka. He sinks his axe into an icy column, and they slide to a safe landing. Drago's Bewilderbeast presses closer, sniffing them out. \nBACK TO HICCUP, spotting Drago on the battlefield, commanding the Bewilderbeast to finish the job. \nHICCUP STOP! Stop! \nHiccup lands Toothless a few paces from Drago and brazenly removes his helmet. Drago eyes him, incredulous, then begins to CHUCKLE. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 76. \nDRAGO This... is the great dragon master? The son of Stoick the Vast? What shame he must feel. \nToothless snarls, ready to blast, but Hiccup calms him with a hand gesture. \nHICCUP All of this loss, and for what? To become unstoppable? To rule the world? \nDrago smirks and turns away from Hiccup. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Dragons are kind, amazing creatures that can bring people together. \nDRAGO Or tear them apart. \nDrago LAUGHS mockingly, then removes his FALSE ARM, revealing a stump at his shoulder. Hiccup is taken aback. \nDRAGO (CONT'D) You see, I know what it is to live in fear. To see my village burned, my family taken. \nHe reattaches the prosthesis, circling Hiccup menacingly. \nDRAGO (CONT'D) But even as a boy, left with nothing, I vowed to rise above the fear of dragons and liberate the people of this world. \nHICCUP Then why a dragon army? \nDRAGO (grinning, smug) Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons. \nHICCUP Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people. \n(BEAT) To control those who follow you... and to get rid of those who won't. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 77. \nDRAGO Clever boy. \nDrago grabs his bullhook and re-approaches Hiccup. Toothless readies himself. \nHICCUP The world wants peace. And we have the answer, back on Berk. Just let me show you. \nDRAGO NO! Let ME show YOU. \nDrago SHRIEKS madly, summoning the Bewilderbeast. Toothless circles Hiccup, protectively. \nON THE BEWILDERBEAST, about to blast Stoick and Valka. It hears Drago's distant wails, and approaches obediently. \nSTOICK What...? \nStoick follows its stare to the distant battlefield below. He spots Hiccup and Toothless a few paces from Drago. \nGothi shuffles onto her deck, confused, then GASPS at horrifying sight. \nINT. VIKING HUT - CONTINUOUS \nA Gronckle lounges peacefully by the fire, as his Viking owner lavishes him with scratches. \nHOARK Ah, that's a good boy! \nThe Gronckle's eyes suddenly turn to slits and it, too, takes wing, knocking over a chair and table as it heads for the door. \nHOARK (CONT'D) Watch the furniture! Where are you going? \nIt barrels out of the hut and into the night sky as the Viking rushes to the doorway, spotting the same arresting sight with a gasp. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 85. \nEXT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS \nVikings pour out of the Great Hall as all of Berk's dragons fill the night sky and join the ranks of Drago's growing \nDRAGON ARMY. \nThe Bewilderbeast rises out of the sea, bearing down on the people of Berk as Drago hovers on Toothless, leading the charge. The Vikings stare, aghast. \nDRAGO Your chief is dead. \nWaves of shock and whispers of \"Stoick?\" spread through the crowd. \nDRAGO (CONT'D) No one can protect you now. \nHe thrusts his bull-hook, commanding the Bewilderbeast to fire. The Vikings watch in horror as the Bewilderbeast opens its yawning jaws and BLASTS. \nEXT. SKIES/BERK - NIGHT \nDragon roars grow louder as Hiccup & Co. approach through clouds, racing against time. \nThey collectively GASP at the sight of Drago's Bewilderbeast having now covered most of the village in explosions of ice. Berk's now commandeered dragons circle in a huddle behind him, joining Valka's flock, and corralled by Drago's armored dragons. \nHICCUP No... \nFISHLEGS He took all the dragons! \nHICCUP \n(FUMING) Distract the alpha. Try to keep his focus off of Toothless. \nTUFFNUT Uh... how? \nERET Have you forgotten who you're riding with? \nHe brazenly aims his baby dragon toward the Bewilderbeast. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 86. \nERET (CONT'D) There isn't a dragon alive that I can't wrangle! \nHis baby dragon dives toward the sea instead. \nERET (CONT'D) Except for this one! \nSNOTLOUT Amateur. \nThe others shrug and follow. As they get closer, the Bewilderbeast looms bigger and BIGGER. \nBerk's Vikings in hiding notice Hiccup and the others as they approach. \nVIKING #1 Look, it's Hiccup! \nThe Vikings CHEER. \nON DRAGO, surprised to see Hiccup and the others approaching. \nDRAGO What? \nWith an irate HUFF, the Bewilderbeast focuses on Hiccup, gaining ever closer to Toothless. \nSuddenly, a SHEEP appears in its sight, rising and falling out of view. The Bewilderbeast blinks, confused. \nIt looks down to see Eret catching the falling sheep and reloading it into the game launcher, as Tuffnut cocks the mechanism and Ruffnut pulls the trigger. \nRUFFNUT Keep `em coming! \nDrago breaks his fall, landing heavily upon the Bewilderbeast's tusk... \nAs Hiccup tucks in his arms, trying to close the gap between he and Toothless before they both make impact with the ocean. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Almost there, buddy. Almost there! \nHiccup reaches Toothless. They pair up, mid-air, and skyrocket past Drago as he hobbles to the top of the alpha's head. \nEXT. BERK - VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER \n(Scene 2500 - One True Alpha) \nHiccup looks back at Drago, now issuing commands from the top of the Bewilderbeast's head. \nDRAGO Do something! \nHICCUP We need to get those two apart. \nHiccup flies Toothless past a flag pole tears a strip of the flag. \nThe Bewilderbeast BLASTS in their direction, barely missing them as they disappear around the back of a mountain. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) We gotta block him out, Toothless. Do you trust me, bud? \nToothless coos, allowing Hiccup to BLINDFOLD him with the flag. Hiccup calms him with a touch. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) We can do this. You and me. As one. \nHiccup SPLAYS Toothless' mechanical tail. Toothless responds, MATCHING the move with the natural half. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) That's it. Now let's try this one more time! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 90. \nThey PEEL around the other side of the mountain, heading back toward Drago and Bewilderbeast, passing Astrid and the cheering Vikings on the ground. \nASTRID Take them down, babe! \nThe Viking roar in support as Hiccup and Toothless race past. \nValka watches with pride as her son hurtles towards Drago and the alpha. \nVALKA Go get `em. \nDRAGO Take control of it! \nThe Bewilderbeast's HISS becomes a furious ROAR, but to no avail. Hiccup clamps his hands over Toothless' ear plates, muffling the alpha's commands. \nHICCUP Shut it out, Toothless! \nDRAGO \nSTOP THEM! \nThe Bewilderbeast BLASTS! \nHICCUP \nNOW! \nToothless suddenly PULLS UP, ARCING over Drago's head! Drago LAUGHS, victorious, then pauses in shock. \nDRAGO'S POV: as Toothless climbs inverted through the sky, the blindfold falls free, revealing an EMPTY SADDLE. \nDrago WHIRLS around, wide-eyed, to see... \nHICCUP ZOOMING TOWARD HIM, his wing-suit deployed, and his Dragon Blade trailing Zippleback gas. Drago SWIPES but misses him. Hiccup clicks the lighter and ignites the gas, blasting Drago off his Bewilderbeast with a SCREAM. \nDrago PLUMMETS, BREAKING HIS FALL against the massive dragon's spines and landing hard on the ground, his bullhook landing just out of reach. \nThe Bewilderbeast WHIPS its tail, trying to SWAT down Hiccup. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 91. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Not again. \n(BEAT) \nTOOTHLESS! IT'S NOW OR NEVER! \nToothless pops open his dorsal blades, arcs skyward, and rejoins Hiccup just before colliding with the alpha's tail. \nToothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to ready themselves. He then BLASTS the Bewilderbeast, mid- charge. Suddenly, Skullcrusher fires. Followed by another, and another. \nHiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons opening fire on Drago and his Bewilderbeast. They've started a rebellion. \nDrago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown. \nDRAGO (CONT'D) \nFIGHT! BLAST THEM! \nHis prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own armored dragons. \nThe Bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but Toothless lets loose a powerful shot. The Bewilderbeast's head is KNOCKED backward by a blue-flame fireball. \nAs the smoke clears, one of its massive TUSKS FALLS to the ground, sheared clean off. Drago glares at Toothless. \nToothless ROARS commandingly, calling an end to the fight. \nHICCUP The alpha protects them all. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 94. \nOverwhelmed and overpowered, the Bewilderbeast yields to the new alpha and heeds Toothless' command, retreating into the sea in an explosive splash. \nThe Berkians CHEER in victory! \nAs the smoke clears, Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. No sign of the Bewilderbeast... or Drago. \nToothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people celebrate all around them. \nAll of the dragons -- Berk's, Valka's, even Drago's -- land around Toothless. Cloudjumper bows to Toothless, starting a wave of bows, acknowledging their new alpha. \nToothless looks around, surprised, then lets out a majestic ROAR. The assembled dragons join in, roaring in tribute. \nToothless turns to Hiccup as he approaches. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) You never cease to amaze me, bud. Thank you. \nToothless GURGLES and licks Hiccup's face. Hiccups squeals, trying to get away. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Toothless! You know that doesn't wash out. \nThe crowd laughs. All around them, Berk's dragons reunite with their Vikings. \nASTRID Stormfly! \nStormfly bounds into Astrid. \nGOBBER Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy! \nGrump lands ON TOP of Gobber, flattening him. \nRelieved to the point of tears, Snotlout and Fishlegs race towards the expectant Ruffnut... \nFISHLEGS Who's my little princess? \n... and then right PAST her to embrace their dragons. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 95. \nFISHLEGS (CONT'D) I missed you so much! \nSNOTLOUT Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang! \nRuffnut GRUMBLES, dejected. Barf dips his head in to console her. \nRUFFNUT Oh Barf! \nShe hugs him. Belch looms in for some affection, but Ruffnut pushes him away... \nRUFFNUT (CONT'D) Not you. \nAnd into Tuffnut who glowers back at her. \nHiccup smiles, taking in the happy reunions. Skullcrusher approaches him, without an owner to reunite with. Hiccup pets him, as Eret approaches. \nERET That was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there. You'd make a good trapper. \nBefore Hiccup can respond, Skullcrusher nuzzles Eret affectionately.

Lock it down! \nBehind him, the massive storm doors rattle as they're lowered. \nSTOICK No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24. \nHICCUP Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land? \nStoick turns to Hiccup, gravely serious. \nSTOICK Because Drago Bludvist is a madman. Without conscience or mercy. And if he's built a dragon army... gods help us all. \nStoick continues on shouting orders, leaving Hiccup stewing. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) Get them into their pens! Quickly! \nHiccup chases around to confront Stoick. \nHICCUP Then let's ride back out there. We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him. \nSTOICK No. We fortify the island. \nHICCUP It's our duty to keep the peace! \nSTOICK Peace is over, Hiccup. I must prepare you for war. \nHICCUP War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons, we can't wait around for him to get here. Let's go find him and change his mind. \nSTOICK Some minds won't be changed, Hiccup. Berk is what you need to worry about. \n(BEAT) A chief protects his own. \nStoick heads off, calling out more orders... \nSTOICK (CONT'D) \nSECURE THE STABLES! LATCH EVERY \nSTALL! HTTYD 2 (D.

QUICKLY! \nHiccup and Toothless BLAST PAST, heading for the exit. \nSTOICK (CONT'D) \nHICCUP! \nThey try to fly through one door, but it seals shut. \nHICCUP Come on! \nToothless spins around and DIVES through the gap in the second lowering storm door. \nSTOICK Hiccup! \n", "test1_true": "EXT. OPEN SEA - MIDDAY \n(Scene 0700 - Eret's Lesson) Eret's ship carves a defiant path North, leaving the last glimpses of Lapland in its wake. \nEret stands on the bowsprit, eyeing the waves intently, searching the surface. He turns toward the deck, where his crewmen man the gunwale cannons, sights trained to the sky. \nERET Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With this wind, we'll reach Drago by daybreak, so best we fill this ship up with dragons and quick! It's no time to be picky. Not if we want to keep our -- HTTYD 2 (D.

OFF THE PORT QUARTER! \nThe crewmen swing the net cannons toward the back-lit, silhouetted dragons, drawing ever closer. \nERET (CONT'D) Net `em, lads! Take `em down! \nEret loads a cannon and takes aim. He spots Hiccup and Astrid riding the dragons. His eyes narrow, determined. \nERET (CONT'D) You're not getting away this time. \nNets fly through the air. Hiccup and Astrid outmaneuver them and dive toward the ship, landing on the deck with a clatter. \nERET (CONT'D) And here I was worried we might turn up empty-handed. \nAstrid brandishes her axe in invitation. Hiccup indicates for her to lower it, then holds up his hands in surrender. \nHICCUP Nope. It's your lucky day. We give up. \nEret's crew exchange confused stares. As does Astrid. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) That's one Night Fury, one Deadly Nadder, and... \nHe dismounts Toothless and tosses a net over Astrid. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) ... two of the finest dragon riders west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make the boss happy, right? \nAstrid grumbles. He takes her axe, hands it to Eret, and escorts Astrid past the men to the open live well. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Excuse us. HTTYD 2 (D.

She glares at him, plainly hating the plan. \nASTRID What are you doing? \nToothless tries to follow them, but Hiccup holds him back. \nHICCUP Toothless, stay. \nHiccup flips the latch, lowering the grate as Eret watches, confounded. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) The dragons don't really care for cramped spaces, so they'll just hang out with you. They won't be any trouble. \nEret's men nervously direct their swords and spears toward Toothless. HE SNARLS. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Unless you do that. Wooden boat, big ocean. How's your swimming? \nNO-NAME Not good. \nA burst of flame erupts from the live well, causing the crewmen to jump back. Hiccup thrusts his Dragon Blade through the grate. \nHICCUP Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have armed prisoners! \nASTRID How is this a plan? \nHe retracts the blade and offers it up. A crewman cautiously takes it, looking it over. The pommel of the hilt is expelling green gas. \nHICCUP Just what every dragon trapper needs. One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas. All it takes is a spark and... \nA curious crewman clicks the lighter, igniting the gas. Hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck. HTTYD 2 (D.

ON ERET, terrified, as the ground rushes up at him. \nERET \nALL RIGHT! OKAY! I'LL TAKE YOU TO \nDRAGO! \nStormfly suddenly SNATCHES him out of his free-fall just before hitting the ice.

SKY - EARLY MORNING \n(Scene 1600 - Momma's Boy) \nBEGIN MONTAGE \nHiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a majestic fjord in the long rays of the low Arctic sun. \nHiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of dragons -- nearly all of Valka's rescues -- are close on their tail. He turns back to his mother, confused. \nHICCUP Hey, I thought we were going to eat? \nVALKA (with a mischievous grin) Oh, we are. \nShe directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense shoal of fish near the surface. \nSuddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface. It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing back down into the sea. \nValka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race for the flailing fish, scooping them out of the air. Hiccup gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a mouth full. \nEXT. SNOWY SHORELINE - LATER \nMONTAGE CONTINUES... \nHiccup has his map spread out in the snow, explaining the various lands he's discovered during his explorations. \nHICCUP And from Dragon Island, I found this archipelago... \nHe looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him, but she has sketched out the rest of the northern land masses in the snow, wowing Hiccup with just how far and wide she has explored. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 50. \nShe returned to Hiccup's side with a smile. But his amazement is interrupted by Toothless joining in, drawing all over Valka's map with a giant icicle. \nHiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles, and Cloudjumper sneers. \nEXT. WINDSWEPT CLIFF - LATER \nValka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff. \n", "test2_true": "Hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind, laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumper's wing and onto several others, dragon-hopping from one to another, until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing tip to wing tip. She then drops out of sight, reappearing a moment later standing atop Cloudjumper. Hiccup is in utter awe of her. \nValka breathes in the frigid air. Lets it out blissfully. \nVALKA When I'm up here, I don't even feel the cold. I just feel... \nHICCUP Free. \nShe smiles at Hiccup. He gleams back. \nVALKA This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup. \nHiccup LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position and unbuckles himself. Valka watches, curious. \nHICCUP It's all well and good to call yourself a dragon. \nHiccup RUNS OFF of Toothless, pulling his stowed wings. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) But can you fly? \nThey catch the air, SNAPPING OPEN... and sending him GLIDING. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 51. \nValka GASPS, astonished. She flies her dragon alongside him, marvelling, as... \n... Hiccup SOARS, riding the wild air currents like an eagle, the image of freedom. Toothless descends steadily with him, hovering protectively. \nHiccup grins, pleased at having impressed Valka... until he realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision with a fast approaching mountain top. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Oh no. Toothless! \nBut, with his tail locked, Toothless can't make the tight jackknife turn skyward to rescue Hiccup. \nRealizing that they're in trouble, Valka and Cloudjumper pour on the speed. All four of them collide just as they reach the mountain top, sending them crash-landing in an explosion of snow. \nThey all TOPPLE head over tail to a messy landing on the wind- swept ridge and pop up LAUGHING. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) Man! Almost! We just about had it that time! \nToothless raises his snow-packed face, glowering. He tail- swipes Hiccup off of his feet and back into the powder. \nValka inspects Hiccup's wing suit with utter fascination. \nVALKA Incredible. \nHICCUP Well, not bad yourself. \nShe caresses his cheek, staring deep into his eyes. Hiccup doesn't recoil this time. \nVALKA All this time, you took after me. And where was I? \n(REMORSEFUL) I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start over? Will you give me another chance? \nHiccup smiles, a simple acknowledgement that all is forgiven. HTTYD 2 (D.

Like... \nValka finds a spot at the top of Toothless' neck and rubs in a circular pattern. In response, his dorsal blades slowly crack, split and extend, forming a pronounced, aerodynamic `V' down the length of his back and tail. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Now you can make those tight turns. \nToothless shudders, as if experiencing a much-needed chiropractic adjustment. He bounds over to Hiccup, giddily retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a new toy. \nHICCUP Did YOU know about this? \nValka smiles, delighting in their mutual amazement. \nVALKA Every dragon has its secrets. \nToothless pounces around, showing off to Cloudjumper, who seems thoroughly unimpressed. \nVALKA (CONT'D) And I'll show them all to you. We'll unlock every mystery, find every last species, together, as mother and son. \n(BEAT) This gift we share, Hiccup... it bonds us. This is who you are, son. Who we are. We will change the world for all dragons! We will make it a better, safer place! \nHICCUP That sounds... amazing. \n", "test3_input": "Valka arrives, winded and aghast. \nVALKA Stoick...

DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 80. \nToothless recoils, innocently. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) \nGO ON! GET OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY! \nToothless retreats like a scolded dog, ear plates back and head hung low. Valka watches, broken-hearted, as Hiccup falls upon Stoick, inconsolable. \nVALKA It's not his fault. You know that. \nOn the battlefield, the alpha BELLOWS, calling all of the dragons to gather. Meatlug, Stormfly, Hookfang and the others all follow the command as the Gang calls after them. \nVALKA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Good dragons under the control of bad people do bad things. \nDrago notices Toothless tumble down a snow-bank, once again slit-eyed and entranced, but unable to fly to the alpha without a rider. Drago pins him down, eyeing the saddle, pedals, and prosthetic tail. \nON HICCUP and VALKA \nIn tears as Toothless rises into view, with Drago in the saddle. \nDRAGO \nGATHER THE MEN AND MEET AT BERK! \nHis soldiers cheer in the thousands. \nHICCUP Toothless! Hiccup tries to go after Toothless, but Valka holds him back. \nVALKA No, don't! \nDrago JABS his bull hook and points toward the horizon.

DRAGON MOUNTAIN - LAGOON - DUSK \n(Scene 2100 - Viking Funeral) \nA KEEL grinds against the shoreline pebbles as a listing, battered ship is pushed into the still iceberg-filled lagoon. \nGOBBER (V.O.) May the Valkyries welcome you, and lead you through Odin's great battlefield. May they sing your name with love and fury, so that we might hear it rise from the heights of Valhalla... and know that you've taken your rightful place at the table of kings. \nBows and pitch-dipped arrows are gathered from the battlefield. Gobber hands a set to Hiccup, meeting his eyes with sympathetic glance. \nGOBBER (V.O.) For a great man has fallen. A warrior. A chieftain. A father. A friend. \nHiccup dips his arrowhead in a smoldering chunk of wreckage, igniting the pitch that coats the tip. \nHe releases his arrow, which sails through the air and lands on the deck of the ship, where Stoick is laid out on a pyre, covered by a sail, his axe upon his chest. \nThe others follow Hiccup's lead. They DRAW BACK in unison and LOOSE their arrows, filling the sky with crisscrossing, flaming streaks. They arc over the lagoon and set the ship alight. ON HICCUP, fighting back emotion and losing the battle. \nHICCUP I'm sorry, Dad. \nHe eyes the engulfed ship. \nHICCUP (CONT'D) I'm not the chief that you wanted me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I thought I was. I don't know... \nValka watches him, her heart breaking. She steps forward. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 82. \nVALKA You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. So frail, so fragile.

Only you can bring our worlds together. That is who you are, son. \nHiccup meets her bolstering stare. He turns to the ship and watches it in silence, silhouetted in its glow. \nHICCUP I was so afraid of becoming my dad. Mostly because I thought I never could. How do you become someone that great? That brave? That selfless? \n(BEAT) I guess you can only try. (to the others) A chief protects his own.

They don't listen to anyone! \nTUFFNUT Yeah, just like us! \nGobber follows up the rear clumsily, STRUGGLING for control. \nGOBBER This... is... very dangerous! \nHe PULLS ALONGSIDE Hiccup and Valka. \nGOBBER (CONT'D) Some might suggest this is poorly conceived. \nHICCUP Well, it's a good thing that I never listen. \nA SHARP RIDGE RUSHES up at them. They're going to CRASH. Hiccup ROUNDS one side of it, and Gobber flies down the other side. They shout through gaps in the iceberg. \nGOBBER So what IS your plan?! \nHICCUP Get Toothless back and kick Drago's- \nHe's interrupted by another closure in the gaps of ice.

{"train": "FROZEN \nWritten by \nJennifer Lee \nFinal Shooting Draft \nOPEN ON: ICE. \nWe're underwater looking up at it. A saw cuts through, heading right for us. \nEXT.

Lee \nICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D) BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING \nThe sun sets. Lanterns are lit. \nICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D) THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING. CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR. \nIn the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single block of ice out of the water. \nICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D) STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR. THERE'S BEAUTY AND THERE'S DANGER HERE. SPLIT THE ICE APART! BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART. \nThe workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it pulls away. \nLeft behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a dinky little sled then head off. \nWe sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the snowline...and descend upon... \nEXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- NIGHT \nA humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord. \nINT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT \nELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops up beside her. \nYOUNG ANNA Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst. \nElsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces. \nYOUNG ANNA (CONT'D) Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. \nYOUNG ELSA (grumbling) Anna, go back to sleep. \nAnna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa. FROZEN - J. Lee \nYOUNG ANNA (drama queen-ish) I just can't. The sky's awake, so I'm awake, so we have to play. \nYOUNG ELSA ...Go play by yourself. \nElsa shoves Anna off the bed. \nAnna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's eyelids. \nYOUNG ANNA (mischievously) Do you want to build a snowman? \nElsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles. \nINT. CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT \nAnna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand. \n-EXT. ROUGH SEAS -- NIGHT. Lightning flashes. The sea rages in a storm. The King and Queen's ship is lost in the waves. \n-INT. CASTLE -- DAY. A portrait of the King and Queen is covered in mourning cloth. \n-EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY. Anna looks small, standing before her people, beside burial stones. \n-INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR. Anna, still in her mourning clothes, approaches and knocks. \nANNA (singing) Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHERE YOU'VE BEEN THEY SAY HAVE COURAGE AND I'M TRYING TO I'M RIGHT OUT HERE FOR YOU. PLEASE LET ME IN. \nAnna slides down the door and sits with her head against it. \nANNA (CONT'D) WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER. IT'S JUST YOU AND ME. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? (weak, internal) DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN? \nWe move through the door... \n-INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa is sitting in the exact same pose as Anna. Her bedroom is frozen with ice. Snowflakes hang in the air, suspended by grief. \nFADE OUT. FROZEN - J. Lee \nEXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- MORNING \nA new dawn rises over the fjords. \nShips pull up to the docks. Guests pile out. \nDOCK MASTER Welcome to Arendelle! \nA BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in his bunad jacket. \nBOY Why do I have to wear this? \nMOTHER Because the Queen has come of age. It's Coronation Day! \nBOY That's not my fault. \nThey pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and nuzzles Kristoff's chest. \nKRISTOFF What do you want, Sven? \nKristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can. \nKRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D) Give me a snack. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) What's the magic word? \nKRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D) Please! \nKristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) Hey, hey, hey! Share! \nSven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself, not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber. \nWe move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who rush towards the castle. FROZEN - J. Lee \nPERSI I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates! \nAGGIE And for a whole day! Faster, Persi! \nThey pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his shoes to \"enhance\" his presence. Two THUG guards follow close behind him. \nDUKE Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner. Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches. (catching himself) ...Did I just say that out loud? \nWe leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary. \nIRISHMAN Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see the Queen and the Princess. I bet they're absolutely lovely. \nSPANISH DIGNITARY I bet they are beautiful. \nWe move past them, to a particular castle window. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CASTLE, ANNA'S BEDROOM -- DAY \nAnna, 18, snores. Drools. KNOCK. KNOCK. \nKAI (O.S.) Princess Anna...? \nAnna sits up. She's got major bedhead. She coughs. Snorts. Pulls a hair from her mouth. \nANNA ...Huh? Yeah? \nKAI (O.S.) Sorry to wake you, ma'am but-- \nANNA No, you didn't. I've been up for hours. FROZEN - J. Lee \nShe falls back asleep while sitting. She snores. Her head drops, startling her awake. \nDUKE Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't call me the little dipper for nothing. \nHe dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks. \nDUKE (CONT'D) (groove fully on) Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey...I fly. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nMOMENTS LATER... \nAnna limps back to Elsa. \nDUKE (O.S.) Let me know when you're ready for another round, M'Lady. \nELSA Well, he was sprightly. \nANNA (rubbing her sore feet) Especially for a man in heels. \nELSA Are you okay? \nANNA (loving Elsa's attention) I've never been better. This is so nice. I wish it could be like this all the time. \nELSA (sincere) Me too.... \nBut then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away. \nELSA (CONT'D) But it can't. \nANNA Why not? If-- \nELSA It just can't. FROZEN - J. Lee \nAnna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional. \nANNA Excuse me for a minute. \nShe walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened. \nMoving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches her. He smiles perfectly. \nHANS Glad I caught you. \nANNA Hans. \nHe smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts her up and leads her in a romantic dance. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER: Anna and Hans drink and chat. \nANNA (CONT'D) I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide... Oops. Sorry. \nShe hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n-THE CASTLE DOORS: Anna and Hans stroll out of the castle. \nANNA (CONT'D) ...Your physique helps I'm sure. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n-THE ROSE GARDEN... Hans notices her white streak. \nHANS (about her white streak) What's this? \nANNA I was born with it, although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll. \nHANS I like it. \nDISSOLVE TO: FROZEN - J. Lee \nEXT. BALCONY -- NIGHT \nAnna teaches Hans how to eat krumkake. \nANNA Yeah, the whole thing! You got it. \nThey laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face. \nANNA(CONT'D) Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers? \nHANS Twelve older brothers. Three of them pretended I was invisible... literally...for two years. \nANNA That's horrible. \nHANS It's what brothers do. \nANNA ...And sisters. Elsa and I were really close when we were little. But then, one day she just shut me out, and I never knew why. \nBOTH (CONT'D) DOOR! LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR! \nThey climb to the waterfall looking out over the kingdom. \nAnna raises up her hands to frame the moon. Hans puts his hands on top of hers. Together their hands form a heart. \nBOTH (CONT'D) LIFE CAN BE SO MUCH MORE- \nANNA WITH YOU! \nHANS WITH YOU! \nANNA WITH YOU! \nHANS WITH YOU! \nBOTH LOVE IS AN OPEN \nHANS DOOR. \nANNA DOOR. \nHANS Can I say something crazy...? Will you marry me? \nANNA Can I just say something even crazier? Yes. \nCUT TO: FROZEN - J. Lee \nINT. BALL -- NIGHT \nAnna pushes through the crowd towards Elsa, Hans in tow. \nANNA Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just get around you there? Thank you. Oh, there she is. Elsa! \nElsa turns to Anna. Anna curtseys awkwardly. \nANNA (CONT'D) I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um. May I present Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. \nHANS (bowing) Your Majesty. \nElsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey. \nANNA We would like-- \nHANS --your blessing-- \nANNA --of-- \nANNA/HANS --our marriage! \nELSA Marriage...? \nANNA Yes! \nELSA I'm sorry, I'm confused. \nANNA Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves. We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony. Of course we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream and then-- Wait. Would we live here? \nELSA Here? FROZEN - J. Lee \nHANS Absolutely! \nELSA Anna-- \nANNA Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us-- \nELSA What? No, no, no, no, no. \nANNA Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must-- \nELSA Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers are staying here. No one is getting married. \nANNA Wait, what? \nELSA May I talk to you, please. Alone. \nAnna sees Hans's worried face. Hooks arms with him. \nANNA No. Whatever you have to say, you- you can say to both of us. \nELSA Fine. You can't marry a man you just met. \nANNA You can if it's true love. \nELSA Anna, what do you know about true love? \nANNA More than you. All you know is how to shut people out. \nELSA You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no. Now, excuse me. FROZEN - J. Lee \nHANS Anna! \nHans rushes to Anna's side. \nElsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just scrambles into the mountains. \nANNA No. \nHANS (shocked) Look.... The fjord. \nThe ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking the ships in place. \nINT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- NIGHT \nSnow falls. Hans and Anna move through the panicking crowd. \nCROWD WALLAH Snow? It's...snow...in July. FROZEN - J. Lee \nHANS ...Are you all right? \nANNA (in shock) No. \nHANS Did you know? \nANNA No. \nNearby, the Duke flutters about in fright. \nDUKE Look! It's snowing! It's snowing! The Queen has cursed this land! She must be stopped! (to his thugs) You have to go after her. \nAnna rushes up to the Duke. \nANNA Wait, no! \nThe Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna. \nDUKE You! Is there sorcery in you, too? Are you a monster, too? \nANNA No. No. I'm completely ordinary. \nHANS That's right she is... (realizing how that sounds) ...in the best way. \nANNA ...And my sister's not a monster. \nDUKE She nearly killed me. \nHANS You slipped on ice. \nDUKE Her ice! FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA It was an accident. She was scared. She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this.... Tonight was my fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one that needs to go after her. \nDUKE Yes. Fine. Do. \nHANS What? \nANNA (to the Royal Handler) Bring me my horse, please. \nHANS Anna, no. It's too dangerous. \nANNA Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right. \nThe Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak. \nHANS I'm coming with you. \nANNA No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle. \nHe sees the desperation in her eyes. \nHANS ...On my honor. \nShe throws on the cloak and hops right onto the horse, coronation dress and all. \nANNA (to the crowd) I leave Prince Hans in charge! \nHANS (before letting her go) Are you sure you can trust her? I don't want you getting hurt. \nANNA She's my sister; she would never hurt me. FROZEN - J. Lee \nShe snaps the reins and rides out. Hans watches after her. \nThe snow picks up and overtakes our view. We push through a blizzard...lose our way...then finds ourselves... \nEXT. HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT \nWell above the snow-line, a small figure climbs the highest peak. It's Elsa. Finally, she stops, looks around. Catches her breath and sings... \n\"Let It Go\" \nAnna steps cautiously through the door--which hits her frozen butt and knocks her into the center of the shop. She looks around, sees only summer supplies. \nOAKEN (O.S.) Hoo hoo. \nAnna turns to see a bright-faced fellow sitting low behind the counter, fingers tapping tip to tip. \nOAKEN (CONT'D) Big summer blow out. Half off swimming suits, clogs, and a sun balm of my own invention, yah? \nANNA Oh, great. For now, how about boots. Winter boots...and dresses? FROZEN - J. Lee \nOAKEN (slight disappointment) That would be in our winter department. \nThe winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a lonely pair of boots. \nANNA Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has another young woman, the Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here? \nShe brings the clothes and boots to the counter. \nOAKEN Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear? \nThe front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a man covered in ice. Underneath is KRISTOFF. \nOAKEN (CONT'D) You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo. Big summer blow out. \nKristoff walks right up to Anna. \nKRISTOFF (in her face) Carrots. \nANNA Huh? \nKRISTOFF Behind you. \nANNA Oh, right. Excuse me. \nAnna moves out of Kristoff's way. He grabs a bunch of carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the place, gathering other supplies. \nOAKEN (to Kristoff) A real howler in July, yah? Where ever could it be coming from? \nKRISTOFF The North Mountain. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA (to herself) North Mountain. \nKristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on his fingertips. \nOAKEN That'll be forty. \nKRISTOFF Forty? No, ten. \nOAKEN (sweet as pie) Oh dear, that's no good. See these are from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem. \nKRISTOFF You want to talk about a supply and demand problem? I sell ice for a living. \nKristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of ice on his sled, covered in snow. \nANNA Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now. I mean, that is really... (he shoots her a look) Ahem. That's unfortunate. \nOAKEN Still forty. But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo! Hi, family. \nKristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through the window of the steaming sauna. \nNAKED FAMILY Hoo hoo! \nKRISTOFF ...Ten's all I got. Help me out. \nOAKEN (isolating the carrots) Ten will get you this and no more. \nKristoff seethes. Stalemate. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA Okay, just tell me one thing; what was happening on the North Mountain? Did it seem magical? \nKristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer. \nKRISTOFF Yes! Now, back up while I deal with this crook here. \nOaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature. \nOAKEN What did you call me? \nEXT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT \nOaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm. \nKRISTOFF Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa! \nOaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow. \nOAKEN Bye bye. \nOaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven, canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly. \nKRISTOFF So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy? \nANNA ...Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage-- \nKRISTOFF Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met? \nANNA Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove-- \nKRISTOFF Hang on. You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met?! FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt. \nKRISTOFF Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers? \nAnna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him. \nANNA Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a stranger. \nKRISTOFF Oh yeah? What's his last name? \nANNA ...Of-the-Southern-Isles? \nKRISTOFF What's his favorite food? \nANNA ...Sandwiches. \nKRISTOFF Best friend's name? \nANNA Probably John. \nKRISTOFF Eye color. \nANNA Dreamy. \nKRISTOFF Foot size...? \nANNA Foot size doesn't matter. \nKRISTOFF Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose? \nANNA Picks his nose? FROZEN - J. Lee \nKRISTOFF And eats it. \nANNA Excuse me, sir. He's a prince. \nKRISTOFF All men do it. \nANNA Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's true love. \nKRISTOFF Doesn't sound like true love. \nANNA Are you some sort of love expert? \nKRISTOFF No. But I have friends who are. \nANNA You have friends who are love experts.... I'm not buying it. \nSven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm. \nKRISTOFF (to Anna) Stop talking. \nANNA No, no, no. I'd like to meet these-- \nKristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth. \nKRISTOFF I mean it. SHHH. \nKristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them. Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its light reflects off...EYES. Several. \nKRISTOFF(CONT'D) Sven, go. Go! \nSven takes off. \nANNA What are they? \nKRISTOFF Wolves. FROZEN - J. Lee \nFlashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it. \nANNA Wolves. What do we do? \nKRISTOFF I've got this. You just...don't fall off and don't get eaten. \nANNA But I wanna help. \nKRISTOFF No. \nANNA Why not? \nAnna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff. \nKRISTOFF Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again. \nKRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D) But she'll die on her own. \nKRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D) I can live with that. FROZEN - J. Lee \nThrough their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip... \nKRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D) But you won't get your new sled if she's dead. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) (knowing he's got a point) ...You know sometimes I really don't like you. \nSven licks Kristoff happily. \nKRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D) (to Anna) Hold up. We're coming?! \nANNA (excited) You are?! (catching herself) I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SHARP MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- DAWN \nKristoff, Sven and Anna walk on a narrow rim of a mountain. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN FOREST CLEARING -- DAY \nAs they step out of the thick trees, Anna catches sight of something far below. \nANNA Arendelle. \nKRISTOFF It's completely frozen. \nANNA ...But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it. \nKRISTOFF Will she? FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA (uncertain) ...Yeah. Now come on. This way to the North Mountain? \nShe points straight ahead. \nKRISTOFF More like this way. \nHe points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES -- DAY \nAnna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes. \nANNA I never knew winter could be so beautiful. \nSuddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that voice OLAF. \nOLAF (O.S.) YEAH...It really is beautiful, isn't it? But it's so white. You know, how about a little color? Must we bleach the joy out of it all? I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse... \nWhile this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in branches, just as baffled as they are. \nIn the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind them. \nOLAF (CONT'D) How `bout yellow--no, not yellow. Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go. \nHe stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him. How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna. \nOLAF (CONT'D) Am I right? FROZEN - J. Lee \nAnna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head, sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms. \nOLAF (CONT'D) (cheery, to Kristoff) Hi! \nKRISTOFF You're creepy. \nKristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a game of hot potato. \nANNA I don't want it! \nKRISTOFF Backatchya! \nOLAF Please don't drop me. \nANNA Don't! \nKRISTOFF Come on, it's just a head. \nANNA No! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOLAF'S FANTASY WORLD -- PERFECT SUMMER DAY \nOlaf walks through a grassy meadow with the sun shining behind him. He SINGS. \n\"In Summer\" \nOLAF BEES'LL BUZZ / KIDS'LL BLOW DANDELION FUZZ / AND I'LL BE DOING WHATEVER SNOW DOES IN SUMMER. FROZEN - J. Lee \n-Olaf now lies in the sand on a beach. \nOLAF (CONT'D) A DRINK IN MY HAND / MY SNOW UP AGAINST THE BURNING SAND / PROB'LY GETTING GORGEOUSLY TANNED IN SUMMER. \n-Olaf sails in a boat. \nOLAF (CONT'D) I'LL FINALLY SEE A SUMMER BREEZE / BLOW AWAY A WINTER STORM / \n-Olaf floats in the water. All his pieces begin to separate. \nOLAF (CONT'D) AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO SOLID WATER / WHEN IT GETS WARM. \n-Olaf tumbles on a sandy beach with sand-snowmen. \nOLAF (CONT'D) AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE / WHAT MY BUDDIES ALL THINK OF ME / JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH COOLER I'LL BE IN SUMMER . . ! \n-Olaf and the seagull break out into a tap-dance. \nOLAF (CONT'D) DA DA . . . DA DOO / AH BAH BAH BAH BAH BAH BOO. \n-Olaf and another snowman drink hot chocolate in a hot tub. \nOLAF (CONT'D) THE HOT AND THE COLD ARE BOTH SO INTENSE / PUT `EM TOGETHER, IT JUST MAKES SENSE! \n-Olaf tap dances with a gaggle of seagulls. \nOLAF (CONT'D) RATDADAT DAD DADA DOO . . . \n-Olaf bounds down a grassy hill. \nOLAF (CONT'D) WINTER'S A GOOD TIME TO STAY IN AND CUDDLE / BUT PUT ME IN SUMMER AND I'LL BE A... \nHe stops at a puddle, looks down at it. Smiles. Hops over it. FROZEN - J. Lee \nOLAF (CONT'D) HAPPY SNOWMAN! \n-Olaf runs with a checkered blanket that he spreads out. He relaxes and stares at the blue sky. \nOLAF (CONT'D) WHEN LIFE GETS ROUGH I LIKE TO HOLD ON TO MY DREAM / OF RELAXING IN THE SUMMER SUN JUST LETTING OFF STEAM! \nSven, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf have a picnic. \nOLAF (CONT'D) OH THE SKY WILL BE BLUE / AND YOU GUYS'LL BE THERE TOO / WHEN I FINALLY DO WHAT FROZEN THINGS DO IN SUMMER! \nKRISTOFF I'm gonna tell him. \nANNA Don't you dare. \nOLAF IN SUMMER! \nOlaf sings the final note. We swing around him and return to: \nREALITY. He then straightens up and smiles. \nOLAF (CONT'D) So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's go bring back summer! \nOlaf grabs Anna's hand and pulls her along up the mountain. \nANNA (laughing) I'm coming! \nSven hops along, happily following them. Kristoff watches all of them like they're nuts. \nKRISTOFF Somebody's got to tell him. \nDISSOLVE TO: FROZEN - J. Lee \nEXT. ARENDELLE, VILLAGE -- DAY \nA layer of solid ice coats everything. People huddle around weak fires. Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and guests. We pass two CITIZENS fighting over a woodpile. \nCITIZEN ONE No. No. You've got the bark facing down. The bark needs to be face-up. \nCITIZEN TWO Bark down is drier. \nCITIZEN ONE Bark up. \nCITIZEN TWO Bark down. \nCITIZEN ONE Bark up. \nKristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) I wouldn't put my foot there. \nANNA (O.S.) You're distracting me. \nKRISTOFF Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you? \nANNA (O.S.) I'm just blocking you out cause I gotta concentrate here. \nKRISTOFF You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone. \nANNA (O.S.) Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you-- \nKRISTOFF I'm not alone.... I have friends, remember? \nAnna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA You mean the love experts? \nKRISTOFF Yes, the love experts! \nAnna realizes she's stuck. \nANNA ...Please tell me I'm almost there. \nREVEAL: she's only about six feet up. Her muscles shake. \nANNA (CONT'D) ...Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here? \nKristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her. \nKRISTOFF Hang on. \nHe pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from behind a rock and waves to Kristoff. \nOLAF Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go. \nANNA Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch! \nAnna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her. \nANNA (CONT'D) Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise. \nShe hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off. Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck. \nEXT. BASE OF THE ICE PALACE -- DAY \nAnna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace. \nANNA Whoa. \nKRISTOFF (in awe) Now that's ice. I might cry. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA Go ahead. I won't judge. \nAnna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction. Kristoff runs to his aide. \nKRISTOFF All right, take it easy. I gotcha. \nKristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) You stay right here, buddy. \nSven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) ...Flawless. \nAnna arrives at the door. Hesitates. \nOLAF ...Knock.... (she doesn't) Just knock.... (she doesn't. To Kristoff) Why isn't she knocking...? Do you think she knows how to knock? \nAnna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors slide open. \nANNA Ha. It opened. That's a first. \nAnna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought, stops him. \nANNA (CONT'D) You should probably wait out here. \nKRISTOFF What? \nANNA Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything. \nKRISTOFF But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life. FROZEN - J. Lee \nOLAF Bye, Sven. \nOlaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him. \nElsa turns and heads up the second story steps. \nELSA (CONT'D) Goodbye, Anna. \nANNA Elsa, wait-- \nELSA (calling back) I'm just trying to protect you. \nElsa continues to flee. Anna pursues. \nANNA You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid. Please don't shut me out again. FROZEN - J. Lee \nAnna SINGS. \n\"First Time in Forever, Reprise\" \nANNA (CONT'D) PLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE ANYMORE. \n`CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, I FINALLY UNDERSTAND. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, WE CAN FIX THIS HAND IN HAND. WE CAN HEAD DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN TOGETHER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR. `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, I WILL BE RIGHT HERE. \nThey arrive on the top floor, Elsa's main living space. Elsa turns back to Anna, grateful, but determined. \nELSA Anna, PLEASE GO BACK HOME. YOUR LIFE AWAITS. GO ENJOY THE SUN AND OPEN UP THE GATES. \nANNA Yeah, but-- \nELSA I know! YOU MEAN WELL, BUT LEAVE ME BE. YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND FREE. \nElsa opens up the balcony doors. \nELSA (CONT'D) JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE FROM ME. \nANNA ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT. \nELSA WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT? FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW? \nELSA WHAT DO I NOT KNOW? \nANNA ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP SNOW. \nELSA What? \nElsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains. \nANNA You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere. \nELSA Everywhere? \nANNA It's okay, you can just unfreeze it. \nELSA No, I can't. I don't know how. \nANNA Sure you can. I know you can. \nSnow starts to swirl around the room. \nANNA (CONT'D) CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, \nELSA (panicking) I'M SUCH A FOOL! I CAN'T BE FREE! \nANNA YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID. \nELSA NO ESCAPE FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME! \nThe snow picks up. Anna tries to fight through it. \nANNA WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER. FROZEN - J. Lee \nELSA I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE! \nANNA WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE MADE. \nELSA ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE! \nANNA DON'T PANIC. \nELSA THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR! \nANNA WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT. \nELSA YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE! \nANNA WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER... \nBut as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening blizzard taking over the room. \nELSA NO! \nAnna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) (impressed) Ho-ho-ho! \nANNA I got him! \nAnna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge. \nKRISTOFF Whoa, stop! \nANNA It's a hundred foot drop. \nKRISTOFF It's two hundred. \nKristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight. \nANNA Ow. \nHe drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the snow with a pick axe. \nANNA (CONT'D) What's that for? \nKRISTOFF I'm digging a snow anchor. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA (not trusting) Okay. What if we fall? \nKRISTOFF There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow.... Hopefully. \nThey hear an angry ROAR coming closer. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) Okay, Anna. On three. \nAnna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight. \nANNA Okay. You tell me when... \nKRISTOFF One... \nANNA ...I'm ready to go.... \nKRISTOFF Two... \nANNA (pumped up) ...I was BORN ready! Yes! \nKRISTOFF Calm down. \nA huge tree flies through the air toward them. \nANNA (O.S.) TREE! \nAnna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches their fall. \nKRISTOFF Whoa! That happened. \nBack up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs and puffs, struggling to run. \nOLAF Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape. FROZEN - J. Lee \nHe stops. Puts his body back together in the right order. \nOLAF (CONT'D) There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there! \nMarshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him. \nOLAF (CONT'D) (happily) Hey. We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things. \nMarshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor. \nOLAF (CONT'D) NO! \nOlaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not making much of a difference. \nOLAF (CONT'D) This is not making much of a difference! \nMarshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff. \nOLAF (CONT'D) WHOA! \nOlaf passes Anna and Kristoff. \nANNA Olaf! \nOLAF Hang in there, guys! \nMarshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up. \nANNA Wait, what? \nKristoff's head hits the cliff. \nTROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D) SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, SO HE'S GOT A FEW FLAWS- HIS PECULIAR BRAIN, DEAR. HIS THING FOR THE REINDEER THAT OUTSIDE A FEW OF NATURE'S LAWS. SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT THIS WE'RE CERTAIN OF- YOU CAN FIX THIS FIXER UPPER UP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE. \nKRISTOFF Can we just stop talking about this?! We've got a real, actual problem here. \nBULDA I'll say-- (To Anna) IS IT THE WAY THAT HE RUNS SCARED? \nTROLLS (VARIOUS) OR THAT HE'S SOCIALLY IMPAIRED? \nKID TROLL OR THAT HE ONLY LIKES TO TINKLE IN THE WOODS? \nTROLLS (VARIOUS) ARE YOU HOLDING BACK YOUR FONDNESS DUE TO HIS UNMANLY BLONDENESS? OR THE WAY HE COVERS UP THAT HE'S THE HONEST GOODS? FROZEN - J. Lee \nTROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D) HE'S JUST A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER- HE'S GOT A COUPLE A' BUGS. \nKRISTOFF No, I don't. \nTROLLS HIS ISOLATION IS CONFIRMATION OF HIS DESPERATION FOR HEALING HUGS. SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO. THE WAY TO FIX UP THIS FIXER UPPER IS TO FIX HIM UP WITH YOU. \nThe girl trolls sweep Anna away. The boys take Kristoff. \nKRISTOFF (to the male trolls) Enough! She's engaged to someone else. Okay?! \nTROLLS beat. Blink. Blink. The boy trolls turn, huddle... \nTROLLS (VARIOUS) SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, THAT'S A MINOR THING. THIS QUOTE \"ENGAGEMENT\" IS A FLEX ARRANGEMENT. \nKID TROLL AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T SEE NO RING. \nTROLLS (VARIOUS) SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, HER BRAIN'S A BIT BETWIXT. GET THE FIANCE OUT OF THE WAY AND THE WHOLE THING WILL BE FIXED! \nGIRL TROLLS WE AREN'T SAYING YOU CAN CHANGE HIM \nTROLLS (VARIOUS) 'CAUSE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CHANGE. WE'RE ONLY SAYING THAT LOVE'S A FORCE THAT'S POWERFUL AND STRANGE. PEOPLE MAKE BAD CHOICES IF THEY'RE MAD OR SCARED OR STRESSED. (MORE) FROZEN - J. Lee \nTROLLS (VARIOUS) (CONT'D) BUT THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY (THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY) AND YOU'LL BRING OUT THEIR BEST! TRUE LOVE BRINGS OUT THE BEST! \nKristoff looks over at Anna. She actually looks shockingly beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals. \nALL TROLLS EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT FATHER, SISTER, BROTHER WE NEED EACH OTHER TO RAISE US UP AND ROUND US OUT \nBy this time Kristoff and Anna are being ushered into a pit by the sheer force of numbers. \nTROLLS EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE- THE ONLY FIXER UPPER FIXER THAT CAN FIX A FIXER UPPER IS TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE LOVE \nDuring this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each other differently. Hmmm. Maybe those trolls are right? Sparks! Chemistry! \nTROLL PRIEST Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded-- \nANNA Wait, what?! \nTROLL PRIEST You're getting married. \nTROLLS LOVE! \nJust then, Anna collapses. Kristoff catches her. She's shivering something fierce. \nKRISTOFF Anna? \nHe pulls off her cape and hat. FROZEN - J. Lee \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) She's as cold as ice. \nJust then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd. Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the pit. \nGRAND PABBIE There's strange magic here! \nKRISTOFF Grand Pabbie! \nGRAND PABBIE Bring her to me, Kristoff. \nKristoff helps Anna over. Pabbie looks into her weak eyes. \nGRAND PABBIE (CONT'D) Anna, your life is in danger. There is ice in your heart, put there by your sister. If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever. \nANNA What...? No. \nKRISTOFF So remove it, Grand Pabbie. \nGRAND PABBIE I can't. If it was her head, that would be easy. But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart. \nANNA An act of true love? \nBULDA (googley, to her hubby) A true love's kiss, perhaps? \nA bunch of trolls give each other kisses. \nAnna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms. More of her hair turns white. \nKRISTOFF Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans. \nElsa's face as her eyes flutter open. \nShe sits up. She's surrounded by stone. \nINT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON -- DAY \nElsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. She's pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves. She's chained to the wall. \nElsa strains to looks out a window... \nINSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting further buried under the ice and snow that is falling. \nELSA No....What have I done? \nHans enters. He hangs a torch by the door. \nELSA (CONT'D) Why did you bring me here? \nHANS I couldn't just let them kill you. FROZEN - J. Lee \nELSA But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna. \nHANS Anna has not returned.... \nElsa looks to the storm with worry. \nHANS (CONT'D) If you would just stop the winter, bring back summer...please. \nElsa meets his eyes, desperate. \nELSA Don't you see...I can't. \nHans sees the sincerity in her eyes. \nELSA (CONT'D) You have to tell them to let me go. \nHans walks to the door. He takes the torch. \nHANS I will do what I can. \nHe opens the door and leaves. \nElsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE FJORDS -- DAY \nSven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style. \nAnna shivers in Kristoff's arms. She's weakening. Kristoff takes off his hat and puts it on her head. \nKRISTOFF Just hang in there. (to Sven) Come on, buddy, faster! \nThey arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them, out of control. \nOLAF I'll meet you guys at the castle! FROZEN - J. Lee \nKRISTOFF Stay out of sight, Olaf! \nOLAF I will! \nHe disappears into the village streets. \nOLAF (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hello! \nTOWNSWOMAN (O.S.) Ah! It's alive! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY \nGuards see Kristoff and Anna approaching. \nGUARD It's Princess Anna! \nSven skids to a stop outside the gates. Kristoff slides off, holding Anna, and carries her to the gate. \nKRISTOFF I've got you. \nAnna looks up at him, gratefully. \nANNA ...Are you g-gonna be okay? \nKRISTOFF (touched, reassuring) Don't worry about me. \nJust then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid rush to help Anna. \nGERDA Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick. \nHANS (putting out the candles) As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you- \nANNA Hans? \nHANS You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that. \nHans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table and goes to the fireplace. \nHANS (CONT'D) I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa. \nHans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire. Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak. \nANNA Hans. No, stop. FROZEN - J. Lee \nHANS But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her. \nANNA Please. \nHANS (chuckles) All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer. \nHans approaches Anna. \nANNA ...You're no match for Elsa. \nHe bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time not so gently. \nHANS No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction. \nShe wrenches her face out of his hands. \nANNA (anger) You won't get away with this. \nHans rises and crosses to the door. \nHANS Oh, I already have. \nHans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle. \nANNA (hoarse and weak) Please, somebody help. \nThe rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the floor. \nCUT TO: FROZEN - J. Lee \nINT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- NIGHT \nThe Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm. He rubs his arms and shivers. \nDUKE It's getting colder by the minute. If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death. \nHans comes in, putting on his most distraught face. \nSPANISH DIGNITARY Prince Hans. \nHANS Princess Anna is...dead. \nVARIOUS DIGNITARIES What...? No.... Mon dieu. \nHans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair. \nDUKE What happened to her? \nHANS She was killed by Queen Elsa. \nDUKE Her own sister. \nHANS (really putting it on) At least we got to say our marriage vows...before she died in my arms. \nHe bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief. \nDUKE There can be no doubt now; Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger. \nSPANISH DIGNITARY Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you. \nHans nods; he knows what he's being asked to do, and he'll do it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas. FROZEN - J. Lee \nHANS With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death. \nINT. ELSA'S DUNGEON -- DAY \nThe cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching. \nGUARD (O.S.) She's dangerous. Move quickly and with resolve. \nElsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men duck out of the way. \nHans pushes his way into the room...sees... \nThe back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the floor. Elsa is gone. \nANNA Olaf, you're melting. \nOLAF (sweet and reassuring) Some people are worth melting for. \nBut then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow back in place. \nOLAF (CONT'D) Just maybe not right this second. \nSuddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in. \nOLAF (CONT'D) Don't worry, I've got it! \nOlaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut but struggles with the second panel. \nOLAF (CONT'D) (determined) We're going to get through-- (distracted) Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something. \nHe breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope and sees... \nKristoff and Sven running back down the mountain. \nOLAF (CONT'D) It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way. \nANNA ...They-they are? FROZEN - J. Lee \nOLAF Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind. \nAnna tries to get to her feet. \nANNA Help me up, Olaf. Please. \nHe hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the chess set and water jugs. \nOLAF No, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm. \nANNA I need to get to Kristoff. \nOLAF (clueless) Why...? (realizing) Oh, oh, oh, I know why. \nHe hops around in an excited display of hope. \nOLAF (CONT'D) There's your act of true love, right there, riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king! Come on! \nThe walls crack under the ice pressure. \nOLAF (CONT'D) Look out! \nThey rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses. \nINT. CASTLE HALLWAY -- DAY \nAnna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and block their path. \nOLAF We're trapped. \nAnna looks around desperately for a way out. FROZEN - J. Lee \nEXT. FJORD -- DAY \nElsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind. \nEXT. CASTLE -- DAY \nAnna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it sweeps the window panes away. \nOLAF Slide, Anna. \nIt's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have? They slide down the iced-covered building. \nAnna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant snowball. \nOLAF (CONT'D) We made it! \nHe shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet. \nEXT. FJORD -- DAY \nKristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight through. \nKRISTOFF Come on, buddy, faster. \nCUT TO: \nAnna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords. \nANNA Kristoff! \nThe wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling off into the storm. \nOLAF Keep going, Anna! \nCitizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads. \nAll of Arendelle is joined in somber silence. \nBut then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw. \nOlaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up. \nAnna bends her arm and embraces Elsa. \nELSA Wha-? Anna? \nAnna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved. \nANNA Oh, Elsa. \nThey embrace. FROZEN - J. Lee \nELSA ...You sacrificed yourself for me? \nANNA (weak) ...I love you. \nOlaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he lifts his head right off his body and exclaims-- \nOLAF An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart. \nELSA (processing) Love...will thaw... (realizing) Love.... Of course. \nElsa looks at Anna with confidence. \nANNA Elsa? \nELSA Love. \nElsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air. \nBeneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws. \nThe entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves. \nThe villagers come out to see the warmth returning. \nIn one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm summer day. \nANNA I knew you could do it. \nOLAF (melting, good-naturedly) Hands down, this is the best day of my life...and quite possibly the last. \nELSA Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy. FROZEN - J. Lee \nElsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little, perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it. \nOLAF Hey, my own personal flurry. \nKristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and stops him. \nANNA Uh. Uh. Uh. \nShe'll handle this. She goes over to Hans. \nHANS (confused) Anna? But she froze your heart. \nANNA The only frozen heart around here is yours. \nShe turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face. \nHANS Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa! \nHe falls overboard. \nElsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder, Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ARENDELLE -- DAY \nIt's a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been repaired and are sailing away. \nOn one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig. \nFRENCH DIGNITARY (to Kai) I will return this scoundrel to his country. We shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior. \nKAI Arendelle thanks you, my Lord. FROZEN - J. Lee \nDown on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two thugs to their ship. \nDUKE This is unacceptable. I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear. I've been traumatized. (bad acting) Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a doctor I could...No? And I demand to see the Queen! \nKai steps down from the gangplank to the dock. \n", "test1_input": "Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice. \nYOUNG KRISTOFF Faster, Sven! \nEXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT \nKristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They hide behind a rock and peek out. \nDown below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds the still unconscious Anna. \nKING Please, help. My daughter! \nSuddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward them. It looks as though they'll be crushed! \nBut, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then unfold, revealing bright faces. \nYOUNG KRISTOFF Trolls...? \nThe rock in front of Kristoff \"wakes up.\" Meet BULDA. \nBULDA Shush. I'm trying to listen. \nShe grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both. \nBULDA (CONT'D) Cuties. I'm gonna keep you. \nBack below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth. They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but determined. He nods respectfully to the king. \nGRAND PABBIE Your Majesty. (referring to Elsa) Born with the powers or cursed? \nKING Born. And they're getting stronger. \nGrand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She does. He examines her. FROZEN - J. Lee \nGRAND PABBIE (about Anna) You are lucky it wasn't her heart. The heart is not so easily changed, but the head can be persuaded. \nKING Do what you must. \nGRAND PABBIE I recommend we remove all magic, even memories of magic to be safe.... But don't worry, I'll leave the fun. \nGrand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in her head. \nGRAND PABBIE (CONT'D) She will be okay. \nYOUNG ELSA But she won't remember I have powers? \nKING It's for the best. \nPABBIE Listen to me, Elsa, your power will only grow. \nAs he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes. \nPABBIE (CONT'D) There is beauty in your magic.... But also great danger. \nThe snowflakes turn to sharp spikes. \nPABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) You must learn to control it. \nIn the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human figures to panic and attack Elsa. \nPABBIE (CONT'D) Fear will be your enemy. FROZEN - J. Lee \nElsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest. The King wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively. \nKING No. We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure. \nOver the King's words we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n-The Arendelle castle gates shutting. \nKING (O.S.) (CONT'D) Until then, we'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff. We will limit her contact with people and keep her powers hidden from everyone... including Anna. \n-The castle shutters close. \n-Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears. \n-Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new room. Anna watches, confused and sad. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CASTLE WINDOW -- DAY \nWe look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes down the hall. \nINT.

ANNA'S ROOM -- Anna plays with two dolls, gives up, sad. \nYOUNG ANNA (CONT'D) WE USED TO BE BEST BUDDIES AND NOW WE'RE NOT. I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHY. \n-ELSA'S DOOR. Anna peeks through the key hole. \nYOUNG ANNA (CONT'D) DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN? \n-Anna calls through the keyhole. \nYOUNG ANNA (CONT'D) IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SNOWMAN. \nYOUNG ELSA (O.S.) Go away, Anna. \nYOUNG ANNA (hearbroken) ...OKAY BYE. \n-BEHIND THE DOOR -- DAY. Elsa sits at the window looking out, longingly. Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill. \n-LATER. The King slips leather gloves onto Elsa's hands. \nKING The gloves will help. \nHe pats her gloved hand. \nKING (CONT'D) See? You're good.... (starting their mantra) Conceal it. \nYOUNG ELSA Don't feel it. \nYOUNG ELSA & KING Don't let it show. \n-INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY. Anna, now 9, knocks on Elsa's door. \nANNA (9) DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN? \n-INT. HALLWAY -- DAY. Alone, Anna rides a bicycle built for two in the hall by standing on the back seat. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA (9) (CONT'D) OR RIDE OUR BIKE AROUND THE HALL? I THINK SOME COMPANY IS OVERDUE... \n-INT. PORTRAIT ROOM -- DAY. Anna runs around the portrait room, gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch. \nANNA (9) (CONT'D) I'VE STARTED TALKING TO THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS. \nAnna lands PLOP on the cushions, then looks up at the painting above her of the courageous Joan of Arc. \nANNA (9) (CONT'D) Hang in there, Joan. \n-INT. EMPTY LIBRARY -- DAY. Looks like no one's around. \nANNA (9) (CONT'D) IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS. \nBut then we find Anna, laying at the base of the grandfather clock, playing with her braids, bored out of her mind. \nANNA (9) (CONT'D) JUST WATCHING THE HOURS TICK BY. \nAnna's eyes follow the grandfather clock's pendulum. \nANNA (9) (CONT'D) TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK. \n-INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- NIGHT. Elsa (now 12) paces as she panics. The entire wall is frozen behind her. \nELSA (12) I'm scared. It's getting stronger. \nKING Getting upset only makes it worse. \nThe King goes to hug her. \nELSA (12) No. Don't touch me. I don't want to hurt you. \nHe and the Queen look at each other with alarmed sadness. \n-INT. LIBRARY -- DAY. Anna, now a teenager, slides past Elsa's room without stopping. FROZEN - J. Lee \n-INT. KING AND QUEEN'S QUARTERS -- DAY. Anna runs into the room and throws herself into her parents' arms. \nTEEN ANNA See you in two weeks. \n-INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY.

My Lady. \nHe drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too, curling his hoof up and out of the boat. \nThe boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward. \nANNA Hi...again. \nThe horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it. Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him. \nHANS Oh boy. \nANNA Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward, but just because we're-- I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. (did she just say that?) Wait, what? \nHans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again. \nHANS I'd like to formally apologize for hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...and for every moment after. \nANNA No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash! `Cuz, you know... (patting the horse) Hello. (MORE) FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA (CONT'D) (to Hans) But, lucky you, it's-it's just me. \nHANS Just you? \nHans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's handsomeness. \nANNA ...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I better go. I have to...I better go. \nShe hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave. \nANNA (CONT'D) Bye! \nAs she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat. \nHANS Oh no. \nThe boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHURCH CHAPEL -- DAY \nElsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She peeks out to the audience. \nHans waves at her from the pews. He's changed his clothes. \nThe crown is placed on Elsa's head. The scepter and orb are presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them. \nBISHOP (a whisper) Your Majesty, the gloves. \nElsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves, places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb and scepter, then turns to the people. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) (formal, in Old Norse) Sehm hon HELL-drr IN-um HELL-gum AYG-num ok krund ee THES-um HELL- gah STAHTH, ehk teh frahm FUR-ear U- thear... FROZEN - J. Lee \nThe scepter and orb start to freeze over. \nBISHOP (CONT'D) ...Queen Elsa of Arendelle. \nCROWD Queen Elsa of Arendelle. \n", "test2_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. GREAT HALL -- NIGHT \nSpringy music fills the Great Hall. Guests dance. Eat. Laugh. \nTRUMPETS SOUND. \nKAI (announcing) Queen Elsa of Arendelle. \nElsa enters, poised and looking surprisingly content. She stands under a formal awning. \nKAI (CONT'D) Princess Anna of Arendelle! \nAnna runs into the room, waves awkwardly. Kai ushers her over to stand right next to Elsa. \nANNA Here? Are you sure? \nShe and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other. \nELSA ...Hi. \nANNA Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi. \nELSA ...You look beautiful. \nANNA Thank you. You look beautifuller. I mean, not fuller. You don't look fuller, but more beautiful. FROZEN - J. Lee \nELSA Thank you. \nThey look out at the celebration. \nELSA (CONT'D) So, this is what a party looks like? \nANNA It's warmer than I thought. \nELSA And what is that amazing smell? \nThey both close their eyes and inhale. \nANNA AND ELSA (TOGETHER) ...Chocolate. \nTheir eyes pop open. They laugh. \nElsa looks back out at the party. Anna looks at Elsa. She wants to say so much, but she can't think of where to start. Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts. \nKAI Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown. \nDUKE Weselton. The Duke of Weselton. (to Elsa) Your Majesty, as your closest partner in trade, it seems only fitting that I offer you your first dance as queen. \nThe Duke does a funny flitter of his feet, a hitch-kick, and a deep bow. \nDUKE (CONT'D) (whispers to himself) One, two, three. Jump. \nAs he holds out his hand, head down, his toupee dips forward. Anna giggles. Elsa looks at Anna, stifles a giggle herself. \nELSA (to the Duke) Thank you...only I don't dance. FROZEN - J. Lee \nDUKE (offended) Oh...? \nELSA But my sister does. \nANNA What? \nDUKE Lucky you.... \nANNA Oh, I don't think-- \nThe Duke grabs Anna's arm and yanks her away before she can protest. \nDUKE If you swoon, let me know, I'll catch you. \nAnna looks back at Elsa, desperately. \nELSA Sorry. \nOUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: The Duke showboats, but he's just awful. Anna tries to make the best of it. \nDUKE Like an agile peacock... CLUCK- CLUGGLE-CLUCK! \nHe lands on her feet. \nANNA Ow. Ow. \nDUKE Speaking of, so great to have the gates open. Why did they shut them in the first place? Do you know the reason? Hmm? \nHe gets in her face, suspicious. \nANNA ...No. FROZEN - J. Lee \n", "test3_input": "KRISTOFF It's because she struck you; isn't it? \nANNA Does it look bad? \nKRISTOFF (thinking) ...No. \nOlaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to join the conversation. \nOLAF You hesitated. \nKRISTOFF No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Now, come on. FROZEN - J. Lee \nHe heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow. \nOLAF Okay! Where are we going? \nKRISTOFF To see my friends. \nANNA (catching up) The love experts? \nOLAF Love experts?! \nKRISTOFF Yes. And don't worry; they'll be able to fix this. \nANNA How do you know? \nHe looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls heal her as a child. \nKRISTOFF ...Because I've seen them do it before. \nAs they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven. \nOLAF I like to consider myself a love expert. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY \nElsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself. \nELSA (mantra-style) Get it together. Control it. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL! \nShe hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow up the wall, taking over the castle. \nDISSOLVE TO: FROZEN - J. Lee \nEXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT \nThe Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as he rides on Sven's back. \nOLAF Look, Sven. The sky's awake. \nBehind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers. \nKRISTOFF Are you cold? \nANNA ...A little. \nHe reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do, then gets a thought. \nKRISTOFF Wait. Come here. \nHe takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock- lined pass. \nSteam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path. He holds her hands over one of them. \nANNA Oooh.... That's nice. \nThey continue on the path, walking from vent to vent. \nKRISTOFF (taking a deep breath) So, about my friends...well, I say friends, they're more like family.... Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven...until they took me in. \nANNA (moved) They did? \nKRISTOFF (nervous ramble) Yeah. I don't want to scare you, they can be a little bit inappropriate...and loud...very loud...they're also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy. (MORE) FROZEN - J. Lee \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) But they're fine.. You'll get it. They mean well. \nAnna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly. \nANNA Kristoff, they sound wonderful. \nKristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity. \nKRISTOFF Okay then.... \nMustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave of the arms announces-- \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) Meet my family. \n", "test3_true": "KRISTOFF (CONT'D) (to the rocks) Hey, guys! \nAs Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded. \nANNA (to herself) ...They're rocks. \nOLAF (realizing) He's crazy. (covertly, to Anna) I'll distract them while you run. (Loud and slow to a rock) Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you! (quietly to Anna) Anna, because I love you, I insist you run. (to the rock) I understand you're love experts! (to Anna) Why aren't you running? \nAnna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away. \nANNA Okay. Um...I'm gonna go-- \nJust then the rocks around her start rolling. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA (CONT'D) (panicking) Kristoff! \nOlaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff and unfold as trolls. \nBULDA KRISTOFF'S HOME! \nTROLLS (VARIOUS) Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's been too long! Kristoff's home! \nOlaf jumps around all excitedly. \nOLAF (excitedly) Kristoff's home. \nHe then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls. \nOLAF (CONT'D) Wait? Kristoff? \nAnna watches, shocked and confused. \nThe trolls all want Kristoff's attention. One troll yanks him down with a boulder's strength. \nTROLL ONE Oh, lemme look at you! \nAnother troll tries to pull off his clothes. \nTROLL TWO Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff; I wash them. \nKRISTOFF (holding up his pants) Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes on, thank you. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) Great to see you all. Where's grandpa? \nMUSHROOM KID TROLL He's napping. But look, I grew a mushroom. \nTROLL SCOUT KID And I earned my fire crystal. FROZEN - J. Lee \nKIDNEY STONE TROLL I passed a kidney stone. \nPICK ME UP TROLL Pick me up. \nThe kid troll jumps up on Kristoff's arm. Kristoff sinks under the weight of him. \nAnna still stares, confused, then realizes... \nANNA Trolls? They're trolls. \nSilence. All troll eyes turn to Anna. Blink. Blink. \nBULDA ...He's brought a girl! \nTROLLS (TOGETHER) He's brought a girl! \nSuddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls. They body-surf/roll Anna over to Kristoff. She falls into his arms. \nANNA What's going on? \nKRISTOFF I've learned to just roll with it. \nBulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look at Anna. She studies her like she's a piece of cattle. \nBULDA Let me see. Bright eyes. Working nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff. \nANNA Wait. Oh. Um. No. \nKRISTOFF You've got the wrong idea. That's not why I brought her here. \nANNA Right. We're not. I'm not-- \nAnna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say. FROZEN - J. Lee \nBULDA (to Anna) What's the issue, dear? Why are you holding back from such a man? \nBulda SINGS. \n\"Fixer-Upper\" \nTROLLS (VARIOUS) IS IT THE CLUMPY WAY HE WALKS? OR THE GRUMPY WAY HE TALKS? OR THE PEAR-SHAPED, SQUARE-SHAPED WEIRDNESS OF HIS FEET? AND THOUGH WE KNOW HE WASHES WELL HE ALWAYS ENDS UP SORTA SMELLY. BUT YOU'LL NEVER MEET A FELLA WHO'S AS SENSITIVE AND SWEET. \n"}

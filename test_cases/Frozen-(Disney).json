THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- NIGHT \nA humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord. \nINT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT \nELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops up beside her. \nYOUNG ANNA Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst. \nElsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces. \nYOUNG ANNA (CONT'D) Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. \nYOUNG ELSA (grumbling) Anna, go back to sleep. \nAnna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa. FROZEN - J. Lee \nYOUNG ANNA (drama queen-ish) I just can't. The sky's awake, so I'm awake, so we have to play. \nYOUNG ELSA ...Go play by yourself. \nElsa shoves Anna off the bed. \nAnna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's eyelids. \nYOUNG ANNA (mischievously) Do you want to build a snowman? \nElsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles. \nINT. CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT \nAnna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand. \n", "test1_true": "Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited. \nINT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT \nThe girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door. \nYOUNG ANNA Do the magic! Do the magic! \nElsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball. Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching flakes in her palms and mouth. \nYOUNG ANNA (CONT'D) This is amazing! \nYOUNG ELSA Watch this! \nElsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna slides off, laughing. FROZEN - J. Lee \nPLAY MONTAGE: \n-Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman together. Elsa moves his stick arms around. \nYOUNG ELSA (CONT'D) (goofy voice) Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs. \nAnna jumps up and hugs him. \nYOUNG ANNA I love you, Olaf. \n-Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually propelling them across the ice floor with her magic. \n-The girls slide down snowbanks together! \n-Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air. \nYOUNG ANNA (CONT'D) Catch me! \nElsa makes another peak to catch Anna. \nYOUNG ELSA Gotcha! \nAnna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic. \nYOUNG ANNA (jumping faster) Again! Again! \nYOUNG ELSA (struggling to keep up) Slow down! \nElsa suddenly slips. \nHer magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles down a snowbank and lands, unconscious. \nYOUNG ELSA (CONT'D) ANNA! \nElsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of Anna's hair, where struck, turns white. \nYOUNG ELSA (CONT'D) MAMA! PAPA! \nThe room around them fills with frightening ice spikes. FROZEN - J. Lee \nThe parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight of the room. \nKING Elsa, what have you done? This is getting out of hand! \nQUEEN (seeing Anna) Anna! \nThe King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms. \nELSA It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna. \nQUEEN (about Anna) She's ice cold. \nKING ...I know where we have to go. \nSLAM CUT TO: \nINT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles to a page with an ancient map. \nEXT. ARENDELLE -- NIGHT \nCarrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a trail of ice behind them. \nEXT. FJORD MOUNTAIN FOREST -- NIGHT \nA sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark woods. All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the girls, leaving the wake of ice. \nKRISTOFF Ice? \nSLAM CUT TO: FROZEN - J. Lee \nEXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 990, "test2_input": "-EXT. ROUGH SEAS -- NIGHT. Lightning flashes. The sea rages in a storm. The King and Queen's ship is lost in the waves. \n-INT. CASTLE -- DAY. A portrait of the King and Queen is covered in mourning cloth. \n-EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY. Anna looks small, standing before her people, beside burial stones. \n-INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR. Anna, still in her mourning clothes, approaches and knocks. \nANNA (singing) Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHERE YOU'VE BEEN THEY SAY HAVE COURAGE AND I'M TRYING TO I'M RIGHT OUT HERE FOR YOU. PLEASE LET ME IN. \nAnna slides down the door and sits with her head against it. \nANNA (CONT'D) WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER. IT'S JUST YOU AND ME. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? (weak, internal) DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN? \nWe move through the door... \n-INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa is sitting in the exact same pose as Anna. Her bedroom is frozen with ice. Snowflakes hang in the air, suspended by grief. \nFADE OUT. FROZEN - J. Lee \nEXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- MORNING \nA new dawn rises over the fjords. \nShips pull up to the docks. Guests pile out. \nDOCK MASTER Welcome to Arendelle! \nA BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in his bunad jacket. \nBOY Why do I have to wear this? \nMOTHER Because the Queen has come of age. It's Coronation Day! \nBOY That's not my fault. \nThey pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and nuzzles Kristoff's chest. \nKRISTOFF What do you want, Sven? \nKristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can. \nKRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D) Give me a snack. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) What's the magic word? \nKRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D) Please! \nKristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) Hey, hey, hey! Share! \nSven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself, not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber. \nWe move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who rush towards the castle. FROZEN - J. Lee \nPERSI I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates! \nAGGIE And for a whole day! Faster, Persi! \nThey pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his shoes to \"enhance\" his presence. Two THUG guards follow close behind him. \nDUKE Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner. Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches. (catching himself) ...Did I just say that out loud? \nWe leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary. \nIRISHMAN Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see the Queen and the Princess. I bet they're absolutely lovely. \nSPANISH DIGNITARY I bet they are beautiful. \nWe move past them, to a particular castle window. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CASTLE, ANNA'S BEDROOM -- DAY \nAnna, 18, snores. Drools. KNOCK. KNOCK. \nKAI (O.S.) Princess Anna...? \nAnna sits up. She's got major bedhead. She coughs. Snorts. Pulls a hair from her mouth. \nANNA ...Huh? Yeah? \nKAI (O.S.) Sorry to wake you, ma'am but-- \nANNA No, you didn't. I've been up for hours. FROZEN - J. Lee \nShe falls back asleep while sitting. She snores. Her head drops, startling her awake. \n", "test2_true": "KAI (O.S.) It's still me, ma'am. Time to get ready. \nANNA Ready for what? \nKAI (O.S.) Your sister's coronation, ma'am. \nANNA My sister's cor-neration... \nOne eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress. She bolts, wide awake in excitement. \nANNA (CONT'D) Coronation Day! Ha ha! \nSLAM CUT TO: \nEXT. CASTLE HALL -- DAY \nAnna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress. She finishes pinning ribbons in her hair. Seeing the hustle and bustle of preparations, she can't help but SING. \n\"For the First Time in Forever\" \nANNA THE WINDOW IS OPEN! SO'S THAT DOOR! I DIDN'T KNOW THEY DID THAT ANYMORE. WHO KNEW WE OWNED 8000 SALAD PLATES...? \n-Anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks. \nANNA (CONT'D) FOR YEARS I HAVE ROAMED THESE EMPTY HALLS WHY HAVE A BALLROOM WITH NO BALLS? FINALLY, THEY'RE OPENING UP THE GATES! \n-She shakes hands with a suit of armor. Breaks it. Hides the evidence. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA (CONT'D) THERE'LL BE REAL, ACTUAL PEOPLE - IT'LL BE TOTALLY STRANGE. BUT WOW AM I SO READY FOR THIS CHANGE! \n-Anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washer's pulley. She raises herself up to see the ships arriving. \nANNA (CONT'D) FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, THERE'LL BE MUSIC, THERE'LL BE LIGHT. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, I'LL BE DANCING THROUGH THE NIGHT. \n-Anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese. \nANNA (CONT'D) DON'T KNOW IF I'M ELATED OR GASSY, BUT I'M SOMEWHERE IN THAT ZONE 'CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, I WON'T BE ALONE. (speaking) I can't wait to meet everyone.... (GASP) What if I meet THE ONE? \n-Anna twists herself in a velvet drape like it's a gown. She acts like she looks gorgeous, but she looks ridiculous. \nANNA (CONT'D) TONIGHT, IMAGINE ME GOWN AND ALL- FETCHINGLY DRAPED AGAINST THE WALL. THE PICTURE OF SOPHISTICATED GRACE. \n-She notices the bust of a man across the room. \nANNA (CONT'D) (google-eyed) I SUDDENLY SEE HIM STANDING THERE, A BEAUTIFUL STRANGER TALL AND FAIR. (mouth full of chocolate) I WANNA STUFF SOME CHOCOLATE IN MY FACE! \n-She grabs the bust of the man and swings it around. \nANNA (CONT'D) BUT THEN WE LAUGH AND TALK ALL EVENING, WHICH IS TOTALLY BIZARRE. NOTHING LIKE THE LIFE I'VE LED SO FAR. \nThe bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake. \n-Anna bursts into the portrait room, bounces on the furniture, and interacts with the paintings. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA (CONT'D) FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, THERE'LL BE MAGIC, THERE'LL BE FUN. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, I COULD BE NOTICED BY SOMEONE. AND I KNOW IT IS TOTALLY CRAZY TO DREAM I'D FIND ROMANCE. BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, AT LEAST I'VE GOT A CHANCE! \n-INT. LIBRARY. ELSA, now a very poised 21, watches out the window as the coronation guests arrive. \nELSA DON'T LET THEM IN. DON'T LET THEM SEE. BE THE GOOD GIRL YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE. \nElsa moves to a painting of her father's coronation. She takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter. \nELSA (CONT'D) CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL. PUT ON A SHOW. MAKE ONE WRONG MOVE AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW. \nThe candlestick and ornament ice over. Elsa gasps, slams them back down onto the table. She tries to reassure herself. \nELSA (CONT'D) BUT IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY. \nWe cut between Anna's excitement and Elsa's nerves. \nANNA IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY! \nELSA IT'S AGONY TO WAIT. \nANNA IT'S AGONY TO WAIT!!! \nELSA TELL THE GUARDS TO OPEN UP THE GATE. \nANNA THE GATE!!! \n-Finally, the gates are open! Anna moves through the crowd, admiring the people around her. FROZEN - J.

He panics, pushes the snow back in place. \nOLAF (CONT'D) Just maybe not right this second. \nSuddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in. \nOLAF (CONT'D) Don't worry, I've got it! \nOlaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut but struggles with the second panel. \nOLAF (CONT'D) (determined) We're going to get through-- (distracted) Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something. \nHe breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope and sees... \nKristoff and Sven running back down the mountain. \nOLAF (CONT'D) It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way. \nANNA ...They-they are? FROZEN - J. Lee \nOLAF Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind. \nAnna tries to get to her feet. \nANNA Help me up, Olaf. Please. \nHe hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the chess set and water jugs. \nOLAF No, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm. \nANNA I need to get to Kristoff. \nOLAF (clueless) Why...? (realizing) Oh, oh, oh, I know why. \nHe hops around in an excited display of hope. \nOLAF (CONT'D) There's your act of true love, right there, riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king! Come on! \nThe walls crack under the ice pressure. \nOLAF (CONT'D) Look out! \nThey rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses. \nINT. CASTLE HALLWAY -- DAY \nAnna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and block their path. \nOLAF We're trapped. \nAnna looks around desperately for a way out. FROZEN - J. Lee \nEXT. FJORD -- DAY \nElsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind. \nEXT. CASTLE -- DAY \nAnna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it sweeps the window panes away. \nOLAF Slide, Anna. \nIt's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have? They slide down the iced-covered building. \nAnna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant snowball. \nOLAF (CONT'D) We made it! \nHe shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet. \nEXT. FJORD -- DAY \nKristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight through. \nKRISTOFF Come on, buddy, faster. \nCUT TO: \nAnna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords. \nANNA Kristoff! \nThe wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling off into the storm. \nOLAF Keep going, Anna! \n", "test3_true": "ANNA Kristoff! \nPAN TO: \nKristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships. Sven struggles over the uneven surface. \nKRISTOFF Come on! Come on! \nSuddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them. They give it all they've got as debris falls all   around them and the mast shatters. They make it past just as   the entire ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath   their feet. \nThe ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it's too wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing water and disappears below. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) Sven? Sven! \nAt first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to go on. \nKRISTOFF (CONT'D) Good boy. \nCUT TO: \nAnna moves blindly across the fjord. Anna's hands frost over an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But she's running out of time. \nShe clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the inevitable is coming. \nCUT TO: \nKristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn't know which way to turn. But then he hears a faint-- \nANNA (O.S.) Kristoff. \nKRISTOFF Anna...? Anna! \nWHITE OUT TO: FROZEN - J. Lee \nElsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. It's Hans. \nHANS Elsa. You can't run from this! \nElsa backs away from him. \nELSA ...Just take care of my sister. \nHANS Your sister? She returned from the mountain weak and cold. She said you froze her heart. \nELSA What? No. \nHANS I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white... \nElsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done. \nHANS (CONT'D) Your sister is dead... because of you. \nElsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that, the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air, hangs suspended, trapped in grief. \nCitizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out to see... \nAnna, barely able to move but now able to see across the fjords to... \nANNA (a whisper) Kristoff. \nKRISTOFF Anna. \nAnna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is giving it all he's got. He's going to make it. \nBut then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he raises his sword over his head. FROZEN - J. Lee \nANNA Elsa. \nAnna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him a longing look, but then turns away from him and then... \nUsing all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa. \nANNA (CONT'D) No! \nIn that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out. \nELSA Anna! \nElsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face. \nELSA (CONT'D) Oh, Anna...no...no, please no. \nOlaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen. \nOLAF (confused, sad) Anna? \nElsa hugs Anna and cries. \nKristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his side. \n", "test3_id": 992}

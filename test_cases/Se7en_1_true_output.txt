A marble hallway.  A DETECTIVE, 50, nervously chewing his nails, quickly leads Mills and Somerset past cops and forensics. 
DETECTIVE I said to myself, I'm not going to screw around with this.  Nope.  Fuck that. It's still pretty fresh meat.  I called the medical examiner... he's coming. (stops at door) When I got to it, I knew.  As soon as I laid eyes on it, I knew... 
The detective opens the door.  FOLLOW Somerset and Mills -- 
INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING 
Gross, deep yellow light comes through the only window with its blinds up.  The light anoints a NUDE MAN displayed, dead. 
DETECTIVE (O.S.) ...this is your guy who did this. 
The nude dead man's legs are folded under him as if he were kneeling, and he's bent forward, chin on the floor.  His eyes are open, his arms outstretched before him.  Mills and Somerset walk to either side of the man. 
The detective closes the door, bites his thumbnail.  The apartment is on a high floor, so it's quiet. 
Somerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow gel, stapled in place to produce the colored light. 
Mills examines the corpse.  There's a chair one foot behind the nude man.  It's an elegant leather chair, drenched in blood. There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge stain of blood under the chair.  Mills looks at pieces of cut rope on the floor behind the chair.  The rope is knotted. 
Somerset crouches beside the body.  There's a big piece of flesh missing from the man's left side, as if the love-handle had been lopped off.  Hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around the man.  The man's hands are palms up, fingers wrapped around more pennies. 
Mills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the corpse and the doorway.  It's an old-fashioned counter-balance scale with two suspended dishes on a see-saw arm.  In the high dish: the hunk of flesh missing from the man's side.  In the low dish: a one pound counterweight. 
MILLS (to Somerset) A pound of flesh. 
Somerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene from near the door. 
He looks worried, vaguely frightened.  He turns his head, looks to a far wall.  Beside a big, abstract, constructivist painting, there's a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood. 
INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING 
An office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is meticulously well kept.  The CAPTAIN, 50, sits at his tidy desk. He's dressed conservatively.  Mills and Somerset sit before him. Somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found. 
SOMERSET (reading) "One pound of flesh, no more no less. No cartilage, no bone, but only flesh. This task done, and he would go free." 
The captain is a calm man, but whenever not speaking, without fail, he clenches his jaw repeatedly, causing the muscles in his neck and jaw to pulse. 
Somerset stands, paces. 
SOMERSET (CONT) This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down nude, holding a carving knife.  And he was given a long time... to decide. Where to make the first cut?  There's a gun to your head... but, what part or parts of your body are expendable? 
Mills sits back in his chair, arms crossed, seems anxious, doesn't know why they're here. 
SOMERSET (CONT) Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at once, his love handle.  But, he went into shock.  Bled to death. 
CAPTAIN What is the point, Somerset? 
SOMERSET Look at both killings together.  This murderer is an artist. 
CAPTAIN An artist? 
SOMERSET He uses colors and symbols.  He positions the bodies after death, so he's working with composition.  It's been premeditated so meticulously... and this is just the beginning. 
CAPTAIN Wrong.  For all we know, we might never hear from him again, and I don't want that kind of talk floating around. 
Somerset shakes his head "no." 
SOMERSET The rats and the pennies.  The circle and the triangle on the wall.  There's something about them... these murders mean something. 
CAPTAIN So?  What? 
Somerset has no answer.  The captain is irked, jaw clenching. 
CAPTAIN (CONT) (to Mills) You with him, or you just here to watch? 
MILLS This is his stuff, captain.  I've been out in the cold most of the day. 
CAPTAIN (to Somerset) Always working overtime up in that big brain of yours, huh?  Always cooking. 
SOMERSET I need you to know... I want us reassigned.  We're declining this case. 
MILLS (sits up, angry) What?! 
CAPTAIN What the hell are you talking about? 
SOMERSET This cannot be my last duty here.  It's going to go on and on. 
CAPTAIN You've left unfinished business before. 
SOMERSET Everything else was taken as close to a conclusion as humanly possible. 
MILLS Can I just say something? 
SOMERSET Also... I don't think this should be Mills' first case. 
MILLS This is not my first case, fuckhead! 
CAPTAIN I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset.  And nobody's going to swap with you. 
MILLS Give it to me, then.  There's nothing that says I have to fly with him. 
The captain considers this. 
MILLS (CONT) If Somerset wants out, fuck him. 
SOMERSET It would be too much for him, too soon. 
MILLS (to captain) Could we talk about this in private? 
The captain looks at Somerset, then at Mills. 
CAPTAIN That's not necessary.  You're in. 
MILLS Thank you, sir. 
CAPTAIN Start picking up the pieces.  I'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.

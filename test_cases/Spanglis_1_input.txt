JOHN 
Hi. I'm John..It's good to see you. (to Flor indicating Cristina) Great.. 
DEBORAH 
(to Cristina) Hi. This is my daughter, Bernice..I'm Deborah..And out there...are Georgie and. 
As she turns to gesture toward her mother and son, Evelyn has almost reached them .. 
EVELYN 
I'm so glad to meet you. I'm a fan of your mother's. 
CRISTINA 
I'm Cristina. As all acknowledge each other Deborah tugs at Bernie's top which is half tucked in. 
BERNICE 
(kidding around but right on) No comparisons, please, no comparisons. Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self- deprecation..Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish. 
CRISTINA 
My mother says it's best if we get out of the way and put our things away. 
JOHN 
Have you ever been to the beach here? 
CRISTINA 
I've never been anyplace but Mexico and Texas.....before today. John goes to a big toy box and opens it up..it is filled with beach paddles, Frisbees and boogie boards. 
JOHN 
Here's the most important place in the house..grab this stuff whenever you want. 
CRISTINA 
(delighted) Thank you..thank you so much. 
DEBORAH 
Very little accent? 
FLOR 
(suspiciously) Que? 
CRISTINA 
(to Flor) Sin acento. 
Her mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with, nods. 
CRISTINA (CONT'D) 
(to Deborah) Thank you..there's an A.P. total fluency class where they work you pretty hard at sounding American. Flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended conversation with Deborah of which she doesn't understand a word. 
FLOR 
Cristina.. 
DEBORAH 
Right. Settle in.. 
CRISTINA 
Thank you. I am thrilled to be here. 
93   INT. MAID'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                                 93 
Deborah has re-decorated the room with casual brilliance...Flor is tense..distraught...her daughter giddy...excited over the sheets, the tv, the pile of towels..a chaise..She goes to work on her mother to go swimming....wanting her to appreciate the fun element of being here...the spirit of the kid such that Flor relents.... 
94   EXT. BEACH - EVENING                                         94 
Flor and Cristina, two sea nymphs, lit by the floodlights from the beach homes. 
OTHER ANGLE. 
John and Georgie in the waves..body surfing...they get to shore...John sees the two females..dashing in the water in their bathing suits..He remains hidden in a very shallow wave as they run in...then once they are in he starts taking off his wet suit hurriedly... 
ON JOHN.. 
As he suffers the cold -- Georgie enjoying every moment. 
95   EXT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT                95 
Wave lights still shining..On a dune sits Cristina, looking out. 
96   INT. MASTER BEDROOM                                          96 
As Deborah steps out on the deck and sees Cristina. 
DEBORAH 
(in a loud whisper) Hey, Cristina...hey...hey..What are you doing up? Cristina looks around -- then up.. 
CRISTINA 
Oh, hi..so beautiful..I was just excited. 
DEBORAH 
I know..Would you believe I had to talk my husband into this? (no reply/then more pointedly) Would you believe I had to talk my husband into it?...do you hear me? 
CRISTINA 
Yes...I just .. (awash..a shy laugh) I didn't know what to say? 
DEBORAH 
(still calling down) Do you want to come with me? -- I'm going to the flea market. 
CRISTINA 
I don't know what that... 
DEBORAH 
It's the Rose Bowl... miles, actual miles, of great things for sale for God's sake...We can have brunch in Pasadena. 
CRISTINA

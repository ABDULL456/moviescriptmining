DAVE Hey, bambini, the Cosa, eh? 
MIKE Just drop that Italian shit, eh? I'm so sick of that shit. A pall falls over the group. Moocher and Cyril feel bad'for Dave.. Dave's smile vanishes. He feels a little foolish himelf. Mike is almost sorry he said what he did but having said it he feels compelled to continue. 
MIKE Driving you to bike races. What the hell am I your private chauffeur or something. I don't ever remember- you paying.for the gas. Sure, it's fun to win. Get all the glory for yourself but when it comes time to do something for the rest of us... Shit. I think you're just afraid of those college guys. And you're not? 
MIKE The only thing I'm afraid of is wasting the rest of my life with you guys. 
CYRIL 
(THROUGH TEARS) I thought that was the plan. We'd waste the rest of our lives together.

SAM No. You? 
BUNNY Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead. 
SAM You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's-- 
BUNNY You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it? 
SAM Suppose not. 
BUNNY You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound-- 
SAM It wasn't just you, Bunny. 
BUNNY No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you? 
She looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment-- 
BUNNY Your shit's still in the garage if that's what you came for. 
Sam nods, stands. Bunny is in tears-- 
BUNNY 350 pounds. 
SAM What? 
BUNNY This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow. 
SAM I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter. 
BUNNY "I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people. 
SAM (Edging out) You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you. 
BUNNY (Smiles) Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam. 
EXT. STREET -- CIUDAD LEON 
Enrique looks nervously over his shoulder before stepping into a funky apartment building. We TILT up to the second floor balcony, where a LITTLE BOY is watching the street-- 
INT. APARTMENT 
There are eight PEOPLE not including the little boy on the balcony. All are securing their possessions--rolling things in blankets, filling shopping bags and grain sacks. Enrique steps in-- 
ENRIQUE Todos estamos? [Everybody here?] 
Anselma reaches up from the floor to take his hand-- 
ANSELMA Van a disparar a nosotros? [Are they going to shoot at us?] 
ENRIQUE Nadie nos veran. Seramos invisibles. Nobody's going to see us. We'll be invisible.] 
INT. GARAGE -- KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY 
A mess. We start on a campaign poster with Sam's face on it and the legend--"ONE GOOD DEEDS DESERVES ANOTHER--VOTE SAM DEEDS FOR COUNTY SHERIFF". We PAN to see Sam, who has been digging through piles of old junk, set down the box he was looking for-- 
CLOSER 
Sam pulls out an old holster, a sheaf of real estate and insurance forms, a couple of old paperback Zane Grey westerns. He pulls out a cracked leather pouch, turns it over--letters fall out. He examines an envelope--no stamp or postmark-- pulls a letter out, reads-- 
SAM "Dearest Buddy--" 
He puts the letter down for a moment, thinks. He needs to know. He picks the letter up again, reads. 
INT. OTIS'S HOUSE -- EVENING 
Carolyn crosses the living room to answer the RING at the front door.  Del stands there-- 
CAROLYN Hey, it's the General. 
DEL Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in? 
CAROLYN Come on in-- 
DEL If it's too late-- 
CAROLYN Come on in. 
Del enters the house as if walking into an AMBUSH-- 
INT. OTIS'S LIVING ROOM -- EVENING 
Carolyn sits back in the couch, drink in hand, checking Del out-- 
CAROLYN Otis sittin' up with some people at the club. I don't think he'll be long. 
CU DEL 
Uncomfortable, sitting at the edge of an easy chair. He looks at a mounted magazine photo of Otis smiling as he pours hot sauce on a rack of ribs-- 
CAROLYN His hot sauce recipe won a contest last year. They sellin' it far away as San Antonio. He got a lot of talent, your father.

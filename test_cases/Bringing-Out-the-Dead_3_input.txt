Frank places an open drug box on the stretcher, pulls out an IV set, wraps a tourniquet around his left bicep. 
FRANK I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure. (injects himself) Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got. 
WALLS Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets. 
Frank crawls back in front carrying the IV bag, puts on the oxygen mask, turns on the main tanks, takes a deep hit. 
FRANK (pulls off mask) These are hard times, Tom. 
WALLS Yeah. Great, isn't it? 
FRANK Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me. 
WALLS Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives. 
FRANK Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso. 
WALLS Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off. 
Walls hits the sirens, accelerates. 
FRANK The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital. 
WALLS Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto. 
Walls turns up the radio, drums his hands against the wheel. 
DISPATCHER Okay, units, it's suicide hour. Fourteen Boy, I show you in the hospital sixty minutes but I know you're in the diner on 14th. Put down the burger, I got a call for you around the corner, 14 and 3rd, a man with a noose around his neck and nothing to hang it on. Sixteen XRay, don't even think about getting coffee, I have a call for you too. 
WALLS (on radio) Sixteen XTerminator here. We like our coffee bloody. Make it good--my partner's dying to help someone. 
DISPATCHER You're in luck, X: your patient awaits you with bleeding wrists on Avenue C and Fourth. 
Frank pulls the IV needle out of his arm, searches the glove compartment: 
FRANK Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it? 
WALLS (hitting the gas) Look out! 
16 XRay lurches forward. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AVENUE C AND 4TH--NIGHT 
16 XRay brakes to a stop before a duster of derelicts, junkies and night people. Two DRUNKS are trying to help a friend with CUT WRISTS. 
WALLS What the hell's going on? 
DRUNK #1 You've gotta take him to the hospital. He tried to kill himself. Show him your wrist. Show A. 
Cut Wrists gets up, leans against the ambulance, shaking. 
DRUNK #1 (CONT'D) See, he ain't right. 
WALLS Hold it. I will not take anyone anywhere against his will. This is America. People have rights. 
DRUNK #2 He was bleeding before. He kept spilling his beer. I gave him mouth- to-mouth. 
WALLS You're lucky you didn't kill him. (to Cut Wrists) We're going to hear it straight from the loony's mouth. Are you crazy? Did you try to bump yourself off? 
CUT WRISTS (salivatory) Yesssss.

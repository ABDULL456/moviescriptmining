Wait a minute. 
QUOYLE She ran to the kitchen. I heard the fridge open. She came back. With her hands hidden behind her. Then, she held out... 
Even his voice.    Betrays the longing. 
QUOYLE Two brown eggs. She gave them to me from her own hands. They were cold. 
He smiles, self-conscious. 
QUOYLE Must sound really stupid.   But they meant a lot to me. 
Silence.   A soft... 
WAVEY Well.   It's the thought that counts. 
He nods.   He's glad she understands. 
QUOYLE I broke 'em, careful. Made her an omelette with 'em. And I saved the shells. In a little box. 
She can't help but show her surprise at that. 
QUOYLE Oh, yeh. They're on a shelf behind my desk. At the paper. 
He looks worried now.     Shouldn't have brought this up.   And seeing this... 
WAVEY I know how it is. To hold onto something good. In the middle of all the bad. 
He nods.     But feels truly awkward now.     So... 
QUOYLE Well. I gotta collect Bunny. Beety's gonna have supper waiting. 
Right.     She nods.   She understands this, too. 
WAVEY Thank you.     Thank you, very much. 
Takes her teapot and her bracelet.        Holds them.     A gentle barrier. Her hands now too full for a hug. 
QUOYLE Well.   Merry Christmas! 
With a wonderful smile. 
WAVEY Merry Christmas. 
With one of her own. 
INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 
Quoyle enters a packed auditorium, festooned for Christ's birthday with every trimming imaginable. Rough fishermen in black jackets they wear once a year, women in finery, schoolkids at their well- scrubbed best, antsy with anticipation. The BUZZ is audible, palpable. No Broadway opening could hope for this level of eagerness. 
As Quoyle comes down the aisle, we see faces we know. Boys from Nutbeem's party. Billy Pretty with Jack and Mrs. Buggit. Alvin Yark and his bird-like wife. The old-timer who sold Quoyle his boat. Mavis Bangs with an empty seat next to her, must be saved for Agnis. All the kids from daycare. Still, Quoyle searching for the face he doesn't find. And finally... 
...to the third row, where Dennis and Beety have saved him a seat. Beety gives him a peck on the cheek, and he smiles, settling in, nervous as hell, just as... 
...the school principal, still dressed for England, walks to the mike at center stage. Holds up her hands like the disciplinarian she prides herself on being, and they quiet pretty fast. 
PRINCIPAL Your friends and neighbors, and most of all, your children. Have 
worked hard to bring you the best pageant ever. 
THUNDEROUS applause, whistling, stamping. She is frustrated for a moment. Then, waves cheerily against the din, shouting... 
PRINCIPAL LET THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN! 
And RUNS off-stage, as we DISSOLVE THROUGH a SERIES OF ANGLES... 
...the Big Ugly Guy who led the raid on poor Nutbeem's boat stands in a threadworn suit bulging with his bulk, singing DANNY BOY in the sweetest tenor one could dream of. PAN an audience, rapt, motionless. Pavarotti never had more respect. 
...Bunny and Marty walk timidly to the front of the stage. Marty dressed in Christmas reds and greens. Bunny all in blue, which does look good on her. Kids CALL OUT their names. The place falls quiet. And the girls begin to sing a plaintive West African HYMN in small brave voices that sometimes harmonize. It is unexpected and breathtakingly courageous. Two dads in the third row have tears flooding their eyes... 
DENNIS (gruff whisper) Not bad, my kid, eh? 
QUOYLE (gruffer whisper) I'll say.    She's as good as mine. 
...Agnis Hamm walks out alone onto the stage, wearing a brown jersey, tweed skirt, yellow stockings and red slippers. She has an odd look on her face, all serious and curious. The laughter and calls die away to silence. Suddenly, one of her feet SCRATCHES at the stage, her arms become WINGS, and with a CROONING and CACKLING she metamorphoses into a PEEVISH HEN protecting an egg. The house comes DOWN with laughter and UNISON applause. Quoyle glances back at Mavis Bangs who puts her fingers between her teeth and WHISTLES in pure delight. 
...Wavey Prowse walks onto the rear of the stage, in a long black smock, carrying her accordion. She turns to the wings, nods, and out comes little Herry clacking across the stage in tap shoes. A beat of silence. Mom calls out: ONE, TWO, THREE, rolls into a savage hornpipe and Herry commences the JIG Quoyle once glimpsed through a window. Three hundred HEELS coming STOMPING down in perfect rhythm and lift Herry into a joyous bouncing, rattling performance that builds in intensity until the finish. He runs to the edge of the stage, bows DEEP from the waist, stands beaming in their applause. Then RACES offstage, his mom following with dignity, and we go with her into the wings... 
Once there, Wavey slips OUT of the smock, revealing to the dimness of the wings, that she is wearing dancer's tights over drop-dead legs. A close-fitting tunic covered with sequins and glass bugles, crystal diamonds, and dozens more glittering baubles that send a shimmer of prisms with her every breath. Herry hands her a top 
hat, a cane, and... 
...she STALKS back onto the stage, her lithe body strutting and glinting. A hush of stupefaction falls, only to be washed away by SHOUTS and WHISTLES, the kind of which have not been heard since Gypsy Rose Lee startled her first roomful of rubes. In the bedlam... 
...she TWIRLS the top hat on one finger, FLIPS it up in a double somersault, catching it square on her head. She leans on her cane 
And when at last they quiet... 
WAVEY We all know Billy Pretty's ways. Never save fifty cents, if you can save a dollar. 
She winks.   They laugh.   Billy laughing loudest. 
WAVEY Well, last Feb'ry, Billy wants t'get his grandfather clock repaired. Calls old Leander Mesher. Local call. No charge. 
Twirls the cane recklessly.    In the third row, a goggle-eyed Quoyle couldn't blink if he tried. 
WAVEY Well, says Leander, the big cost is pickup and delivery. Got t'charge fifty dollars, each way. Two strong boys. Gasoline. Air in the tires! 
That's right. 
WAVEY There's no cost for air in yer tires!, says Bill. Get wi' th'times, he's told. Tis called inflation! 
WAGGLES her eyebrows, Groucho-style.    They are busting their guts laughing. Connoisseurs of wit. 
WAVEY Billy lives at the top of the hill, Leander at the bot tom, doncha know. So Billy gets a rope, HOISTS the grandfather UP on his back. And muttering the words fifty bucks...

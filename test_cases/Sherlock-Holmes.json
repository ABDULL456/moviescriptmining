{"train": "SHERLOCK HOLMES \nWritten by \nMichael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham & Simon Kinberg \nSherlock Holmes and Watson characters created by \nSir Arthur Conan Doyle \nSeptember 29, 2008 \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1 \nAutumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full moon. \nWATSON (V.O.) The year was 1891. London was the capital of the world -- the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air. It was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained. \nGas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern. \nWATSON (V.O.) I had come to London, ten years prior, to find a life after the Afghan war. I had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. The life I found was anything but nice and steady. \nWe can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance. The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing stampede. \nWATSON (V.O.) And that had everything to do with one man. My friend, my partner, my burden... \nThe MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the impression that he knows something that we don't. \nWATSON (V.O.) ... Sherlock Holmes. \nWHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him, his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles. \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                       1 The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he recognizes his famous assailant. \nMAN Sherlock Holmes?! \nSHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken umbrella. \nHOLMES My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street. \nSherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN takes a step into the road to watch him go -- \n-- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious pursuit, Victorian-style. \nINT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a 19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader, older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE. \nA man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers: DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A thinking man of action. \n3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3 \nAlmost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the river. \nAs the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot follow. \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHolmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and runs across a courtyard to a side door. \nWE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL. \n4   OMITTED                                                      4 \n5   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5 \nHolmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but not as fit as he used to be. \nHolmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers round the corner. \nA lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying the lantern and a gun. \nHe peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the lantern away again. He peers about, confused. \nWe see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his jacket and thinks through his plan of attack. \nHOLMES (V.O.) Head cocked to the left, partial deafness in right ear. First point of attack. \nPRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED \nFOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400 fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's head is thrown back as he spins round. \nHOLMES (V.O.) Then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop screaming. \nBACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream. \nHOLMES (V.O.) Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker -- knuckles to liver. \nBACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted thug and crumples him to his knees. (CONTINUED) \n5   CONTINUED:                                                       5 SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE \nHolmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we can barely see what he's doing. \nTHWACK! Hammer blow to ear. CRACK! Karate chop to throat. WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver. \nBACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground, Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it onto his own in one super fast move. \nHolmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase. \nPOV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE \nAnother bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the shadows. \nWATSON Lord Blackwood?! Blackwood applauds softly, strangely. \nBLACKWOOD Well done, Holmes. And Watson as well. \nWatson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood. \nWATSON Stay right there. \nBlackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost mockingly. \nBLACKWOOD Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work? (beat) The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before I'd finished the first incision. \nThat's more than Watson can take.   He moves in to pistol- whip Blackwood -- \n-- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his collar. \nHOLMES No. \nWatson struggles forward against Holmes' grip. \nHOLMES Look. \n(CONTINUED) \n9A   CONTINUED: (2)                                                9A Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood.   Watson looks, sees nothing. \nHOLMES Look. \nWatson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide. \nINCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost invisible -- \n-- the other end held between Blackwood's hands.    A really nasty concealed weapon. \nOne more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye. \nBLACKWOOD What a shame.    That would've been fun. \nWe hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his men finally appear. \nPOLICEMEN flood the area. \nHOLMES Impeccable timing, Lestrade. \nLESTRADE (vis Blackwood) Is that -- ? \nWATSON It is. \nHOLMES (re: girl) We've gone for the doctor... (re: Blackwood) And one for the rope. \nLESTRADE You should've waited for my help. \nHOLMES If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard. (a wry smile) I can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance. \n(CONTINUED) \n9A    CONTINUED: (3)                                              9A Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him, while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's still mouthing the incantation. \nLestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his head, not understanding them. \nGrudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to, he turns to Holmes. \nLESTRADE What do you make of that? \nHOLMES Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon. (indicating) The double circle's for his own protection. \nLESTRADE London will breathe a sigh of relief -- \nWATSON -- at the excellent work of Scotland Yard. As usual. \nHOLMES Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar. \nHolmes sticks the villain's cigar in Lestrade's pocket and -- \n-- A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER lifts his massive camera. \nFLASH! An explosion of light and sparks as a 19th century flashbulb pops. The SCENE is FROZEN bright for a split-second and then it FADES. \nCREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS, MUSIC AND TITLES OVER -- \nOMITTED \n10A   INT. LAB                                                    10A \nDim light from a burner heats fluid in a jar, a bench strewn with scientific equipment. Gloved hands mix chemicals in a tray, a piece of photo paper on top. \n10B   INT. NEWSPAPER LIBRARY                                       10B \nAnother pair of hands search urgently through a row of alphabetized files, coming to rest on the letter \"H.\" A bunch of \"H\" clippings hit the desk. The top one reads: \nSTUDENT AND ARMY DOCTOR SOLVE LONDON MYSTERY! A photo of Holmes and Watson in their 20s at a crime scene. Their eyes are shut for the photo, unaccustomed to flashes. \n10C   INT. LAB                                                     10C \nChemicals are poured over the paper and spread across it. \n10D   INT. NEWSPAPER LIBRARY                                       10D \nHands flip through more papers, more headlines: STUDENT AND DOCTOR BEAT COPS TO THE PUNCH AGAIN! ROOMMATES SOLVE BRIXTON MURDERS! Another picture of Holmes and Watson. This time, they look more confident, the article bigger. \nAnother headline: HOLMES AND WATSON OPEN FOR BUSINESS. Holmes and Watson stand in front of 221 Baker Street. \n10E                                                                10E INT. LAB A negative is clipped over the paper.    A sudden flash of light as it is exposed. \n10F   INT. NEWSPAPER LIBRARY                                       10F \nAnother headline: DOCTOR AND DETECTIVE FOIL JEWELRY SCAM! A picture of Holmes and Watson, holding a goose by its feet and smiling. The men are front page news now. \nWATSON It needs work.     May I see?... \nWatson passes him heading to the other side of the room (possibly grabs the gun) picking up a pile of open letters from a table. \nHOLMES Gently, gently, Watson... \nWatson whips open more curtains and opens a window. \nHolmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on. \nWatson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the letters. \n(CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED:                                                    14 WATSON It's been three months since the last case. About time you found another one. \nHOLMES I can't but agree. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. The sooner the better. \nWATSON Paper? \nWatson hands Holmes the newspaper. \nWATSON Let's see, we have a letter here from Mrs. Ramsey in Queen's Park -- her husband has gone missing. \nHOLMES He's in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is it December? \nWATSON Yes, Holmes. Lady Radford reports a missing emerald bracelet. \nHOLMES Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging. \nWATSON Yes, it's our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end. \nAwkward pause.   Cough. \nWATSON Mr. Lewis is seeking... \nMrs. Hudson enters carrying a tray of bread and tea.    She is steeling herself for this interaction. \nHOLMES (to Watson) There is only one case that intrigues me at present... the curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED: (2)                                               14 HOLMES (CONT'D) I have been studying her comings and goings and they appear most sinister. \nMRS. HUDSON Tea, Mr. Holmes. \nMrs. Hudson crosses to Holmes and puts the tray before him. \nHOLMES Is it poisoned, nanny? \nMRS. HUDSON There's enough of that in you already. \nShe goes to remove an old tray from behind him. \nHOLMES Don't touch that. Everything is in its proper place, as per usual. \nShe ignores him and removes the tray then crosses back towards the door noticing a bulldog lying unconscious under the table. \nMRS. HUDSON He's killed the dog... again. \nWatson jumps up. His bulldog, GLADSTONE, lies on the floor in a drugged stupor. \nWATSON What have you done to Gladstone this time? \nHOLMES I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He doesn't mind. \nWATSON Holmes!   As your doctor... \nHOLMES He'll be right as a trivet in no time. \nWatson's finally had enough. \n(CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED: (3)                                              14 WATSON ... and your friend, you've been in this room for two weeks. I insist you get out of here. \nHOLMES There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all. \nWATSON So, you have nothing to do? \nHOLMES Nothing. \nWATSON Then you're free this evening. \nHOLMES Absolutely. \nWATSON For dinner. \nHOLMES Wonderful. \nWATSON The Royale. \nHOLMES My favorite. \nWATSON Mary's coming. \nHOLMES Not available. \nWATSON You're meeting her, Holmes. \nHOLMES Have you proposed yet? \nWATSON I'm still looking for the right ring. \nA little smile from Holmes. \nHOLMES Then it's not official. \n(CONTINUED) \nAs Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to her feet. They're leaving. \nHOLMES Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor perhaps. \nMary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face. The restaurant goes silent. She turns to leave, turns back. \nMARY (low) Right on all counts but one. I didn't leave my fiance... he died. \nNow she leaves -- \n(CONTINUED) \n15     CONTINUED: (6)                                               15 WATSON Well done, old man. \n-- and Watson goes with her. \nHolmes lets the wine drip down over him. \nHOLMES She's lovely. \nHolmes is left at an empty table with wine running down his face. \nTheir orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high. The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt, spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around. \nHOLMES' POV \nHappy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly, Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving. The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR -- \n-- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD. \n15A-17 OMITTEDINT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING FIGHT - 5A-17 NIGHT \nHolmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own blood from a split lip. It interests him. He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists together and moves in. \nBets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD. \nHOLMES' POV \nThe room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him, the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing. \n(CONTINUED) \n15A-17 CONTINUED:                                               15A-17 He's able to feel, not just think.    He is utterly in the moment. \nHolmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning to move his head so that a punch grazes him. \nBACK TO SCENE \nMcMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect himself. \nOnce or twice, he reaches out and gently touches McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely in control -- \n-- until he notices a face at ringside. \nCLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN \nEarly thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective. \nHolmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound floods back into the room. \nMcMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and -- \nHe knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right. \nHolmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns back to McMurdo, smiles. \nHOLMES Well done.   Thank you. \nHolmes begins walking away. \nMcMURDO Oi!   We ain't done here. \nHOLMES (walking away) Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank you, it was most pleasurable. \n(CONTINUED) \n15A-17 CONTINUED: (2)                                             15A-17 Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back of the head. The crowd falls silent. \nHolmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his hand. \nHOLMES Hm.   Plymouth gin. \nHe turns.   Steps back into the ring. \nThe crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee: \nA little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo braces for combat -- \nInstantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves, incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong. \nMcMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning away before the giant hits the canvas. \nHe sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care. \nPassing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms. \n18A                                                                   18A INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - NIGHT A candle shivers, casting jagged shadows. A row of stone cells. The sound of prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A full-scale riot is on. \nFive GUARDS charge down the corridor, banging on the doors to quiet the prisoners. \nThe GUARD CAPTAIN approaches a young guard, CHARLIE, who is frozen on the spot. \nGUARD CAPTAIN Charlie, what the hell's going on down here? \n(CONTINUED) \n18A   CONTINUED:                                                  18A CHARLIE It's Jack, he tried to stop Blackwood from doing his spells. And now he's in some kind of fit. \nHOLMES You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. \nWatson punches him square in the face. \nWATSON And your grand gift is the uncanny ability to demoralize people. I was aware she'd been engaged. She told me. Holmes rubs his jaw. \nHOLMES So that's a `no' to the opera then? \nWatson's steaming.   Holmes puts on his vest. \nWATSON That's my waistcoat. \nHOLMES It's too small for you. \nWATSON Well, it's my property and I want it back. (CONTINUED) \n26aA. 23   CONTINUED: (2)                                             23 Holmes hands him the waistcoat which he promptly tosses out of the carriage window. Holmes frowns, looks out the opposite window. \n26A. \n24   EXT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - EARLY MORNING                     24 \nAlready a CROWD is gathering outside the jail, papers are for sale, Blackwood's death is the headline. Religious zealots and occultists swarm. Police keep them away from the entrance. Holmes heads inside, Watson stops. \nWATSON You go ahead. I've no business with him while he's alive. \n25   OMITTED                                                     25 \n26   INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - DAWN                    26 \nA pale, nervous GUARD leads Holmes down the shadowy corridor. All the cells are now EMPTY. \nHOLMES Where are all the other prisoners? \nGUARD We had to move `em, sir, otherwise we were going to have a riot on our hands. There's something about him... it's like he can get inside your head. \nHolmes can see how spooked the Guard is. \nHOLMES I'm sure I can find my own way from here, if you have other duties to attend to. \nGUARD Much obliged, sir. Thank you, thank you. \nThe Guard high-tails it out of there. \nINT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - BLACKWOOD'S CELL - DAY Holmes approaches Blackwood's cell, strolling insouciantly. No way this creep's getting to him. In the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's reading aloud to himself. Holmes listens, getting closer. BLACKWOOD QUOTE from Revelations tbd... \nBlackwood pauses, turns, sees Holmes. \nThey share a smile -- two heavyweights sizing each other up. \nHOLMES Love what you've done with the place. \nBLACKWOOD Thank you for joining me. \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                                   27 HOLMES A small point of concern. \nBLACKWOOD How can I help? \nHOLMES I'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush -- \nBLACKWOOD You're too kind. \nHOLMES However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting. \nSuddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to Holmes. \nBLACKWOOD So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here. \nHOLMES Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company. \nBLACKWOOD Allow me to enlighten you. Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment. Your error in judgement is to assume I've been holding the brush at all -- I am merely the channel. \nDespite the bars between them, the men are close together. Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear. \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED: (2)                                               27 HOLMES My only wish is that I'd caught you earlier. I might have spared five lives. \nBLACKWOOD Those lives were a necessity, a sacrifice. Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose. \nHOLMES I wonder if they'd let Watson and I dissect your brain -- after you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve a greater purpose, too. \nBLACKWOOD Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze. I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events. (beat) For you and I are bound on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature. (beat) I sense fragility beneath your mask of logic, and it worries me. Steel your mind, Holmes, I need you. \nHolmes steps back, shakes his head. \nHOLMES I must say, you've come a long way down from the House of Lords. \nBLACKWOOD But I will rise again. \nHOLMES Bon voyage, Blackwood. \nAs Holmes walks away, Blackwood calls after him. \nBLACKWOOD Pay attention! Three more shall die, and there is nothing you can do to save them. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n29A. 27   CONTINUED: (3)                                               27 BLACKWOOD (CONT'D) You must accept that this is beyond your control, or by the time you realize it was you that made it all possible it will be the last sane thought in your head. \n28   INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - MORNING                 28 \nHolmes walks down the corridor, meets Lestrade and a PRIEST. The place is bustling with cops and officials. \nLESTRADE What did he want? \n(CONTINUED) \n37A. 38B   CONTINUED:                                                  38B IRENE Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look like yours, does it? And -- naughty boy -- here's another one. I'll return them, shall I? \nShe takes both wallets, takes the roses -- \nIRENE These are lovely, thank you. \n-- and leaves, stepping daintily over the crumpled man on the floor. \nOn second thoughts, she turns back, takes his wallet too, then leaves. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE ON HOLMES \nHOLMES Now, that's the Irene I know. \nHe hurries after Irene down the alley. \n38C                                                                  38C EXT. LONDON STREET Holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of Irene through a STREET FAIR, which is being assembled. \nHolmes picks up the pace. \nHe snatches a HAT from a one-eyed old BEGGAR with his hand out. He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin and snatches the beggar's eye patch too. \nHe runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews it to blacken his teeth. \nHe pauses to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat on a fairground fire-breather's flames, runs on. \n39    EXT. LONDON STREET                                              39 \nHolmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously. Again he stops the coach and again the gun comes out, but this time we can see that Holmes gets a view of the man on the other end of the weapon before the carriage pulls away. \n37B. \n40   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS (PRESENT)             40 \nHolmes strums one more chord on his violin, thinking. \nIrene's bag of money still sits on the table. \nHOLMES This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge. \nWATSON Which is no mean feat. \nHOLMES She's intimidated, scared... \nWATSON And yet she works for him. That's bad money. It's nothing to do with me, but leave this case. \nHolmes motions to the bills. \nHOLMES Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to make a living. After all, I'll be paying the rent entirely on my own. \nWATSON You know what, I've had just about enough -- \nHOLMES Clarky! \nVOICE (O.S.) Mister Holmes, sir...? \nHe turns to see... CONSTABLE CLARK standing at the door. Breathless, pale, scared. \nCONSTABLE CLARK Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, at once. \n(CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:                                           40 HOLMES (mumbles) What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a compass. You means us. \nWATSON Us means you. \nCONSTABLE CLARK It's Lord Blackwood, sir. It appears he's come back from the dead. \nWATSON Well that's clever seeing as how I pronounced him dead myself. \nCONSTABLE CLARK A groundsman saw him walking through the graves, just this morning. \nWATSON I'll leave this one in your capable hands. I have tea with Mary and her parents this evening. \nWatson walks into his office. \nHOLMES It is not my reputation at stake here. \nWATSON Are you taking this seriously? \nHOLMES Like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not. \nThey all move to the exit. \nHOLMES Watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked. \nClarky laughs. \n38aA. \n41   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY                 41 \nJudging by the estate, Blackwood comes from old money, and lots of it. We FOLLOW the carriage hurrying Holmes and Watson forward. \n42   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD BURIAL PLOT - DAY                           42 \nGenerations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble memorials. Not a place for a picnic, not even on a bright sunny day -- and it's starting to rain. \nA COP stops the carriage, opens the door. Holmes and Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather FORENSICS KIT. \nThey walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family Crypt. Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump of trees in the distance. \nWATSON Look at this mess. Nothing but standard-issue police bootprints. Any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled. \n42A-50 OMITTE                                                  42A-50 \n51     EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                                     51 \nHolmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly observing humanity. Watson ENTERS FRAME and hands Holmes a bundle wrapped in newspaper. \nWATSON I fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the way. \nHOLMES Trust me. (CONTINUED) \n42A. 51   CONTINUED:                                                  51 WATSON Just eat. \nHolmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along. Watson appears preoccupied. \nWATSON You know, I've seen things in war that I couldn't explain. I once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. You have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible. \n(CONTINUED) \n51   CONTINUED: (2)                                               51 HOLMES (mouth full, near indecipherable) Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Adler's midget is the key to this. \nHolmes pulls out a JEWELER'S LOUP, screws it into his eye, and flips Reordon's watch open. He examines the lid. \nHOLMES Hmm... scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you? \nWATSON The owner was most likely a drunk. Each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches. \nHOLMES Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own. \nWatson looks quite chuffed. \nHOLMES Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid. \nWATSON Pawnbroker's marks. \nHOLMES Excellent. \nWatson looks extremely pleased with himself until they turn a corner into a street where EVERY SECOND SHOP IS A PAWN SHOP. His face falls. \nHOLMES The most recent is M.H... \nWatson shakes his head. \nWATSON Maddison and Haig. \n(CONTINUED) \n43A. 51   CONTINUED: (3)                                               51 HOLMES Oh my Lord, here we are. They should give us an address. \nWE SEE MADDISON & HAIG, PAWNBROKERS, RESPECTABLE, DISCREET, ahead of them there on Bow Street. \nWATSON There's one thing you've missed. On the watch. \nHOLMES I think not. \nWATSON The time. Which leads me to deduce that I'm already late for my appointment with Mary. You remember, the one I was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you. \nA GYPSY PALM READER approaches Watson as he turns to leave. \nPALM READER Reckon your future, sir? \nHOLMES Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond. \nWATSON No, thank you. \nShe grabs his hand anyway. \nPALM READER You need to hear what I have to tell you. \nWatson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of her tone that he doesn't pull away. \nPALM READER I see two men, brothers. Not in blood but in bond. I see the letters S and an L, no... wait, a J. \nHolmes and Watson look at each other.   She has their attention. \n(CONTINUED) \n43B. 51   CONTINUED: (4)                                               51 PALM READER (wincing) I see madness. A man driven out of his mind by a malign force. \nWatson looks at Holmes. \nPALM READER I see a letter... the letter M... another M... Mary? You will be married... I see... I see... (horrified) Patterned table clothes, china figurines, lace doilies... \nWatson snatches his hand away. \nWATSON You think you are clever don't you? \nHolmes feigns innocence. \nPALM READER She turns to fat... \nWATSON Enough. \nThe Palm Reader looks at Holmes. \nHOLMES (to Watson) Do you have any changes? \nWatson shakes his head as he pays the woman. \nWATSON This is a new low -- even for you. \n(CONTINUED) \n51   CONTINUED: (5)                                               51 HOLMES It's the most honest prediction old Flora has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be. \nHolmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the wrapping aside, pleased with himself. \nWATSON Do you still have my cut from the fight? \nBOOM!   The door WHIPS open.    TWO THUGS spill into the room. \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:                                                     58 They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a twisty stick of barley sugar (Victorian hard candy). \nThey stop, surprised to see Holmes and Watson.    Holmes' eyes widen at the giant. \nHOLMES Hello, gentlemen. \nDredger is deadpan. \nDREDGER Sherlock Holmes. \nHOLMES Let me guess -- you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for? Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man. \nDREDGER (smiles) You do like to talk. \nThe two thugs step toward Holmes and Watson. \nHOLMES You take them, I'll handle Mr. Sweet tooth. \nWATSON Seems about fair. \nWatson meets the men in the middle of the room, swinging at them. As they dodge and swing back -- \nHolmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye: \nHe WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it so the curtain-rings rain to the floor. \nHe spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly -- \nDredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his arm. He grabs the rod and HURLS Holmes through the air, sending him flying into -- \n(CONTINUED) \n58    CONTINUED: (2)                                                58 INT. REORDON'S LAB \nHolmes crash-lands on the table, scattering all the bottles and tools. He blinks, trying to gather his senses. He sees Dredger incoming, as -- \nWatson tussles with the thugs, a bar-room brawler.    Head butting one, kicking the other in the groin. \nThe men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so -- \nThe ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground. \nAs Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade, which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring. \n58A                                                                 58A INT. REORDON'S LAB Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He snatches a SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon. \nDredger lurches toward Holmes, who swings the metal shaft desperately, and... the shaft SPARKS. \nZAP! A flash of light and crackle, and Dredger gets an ELECTRIC SHOCK that sends him flying back twenty feet -- \n58B   INT. REORDON'S ROOMS                                          58B Watson finishes off his thug and plucks the engagement ring off the floor, just as -- \nDredger flies through the air, SLAMMING into Watson, knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away. \nHolmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by the efficacy of the weapon. \nDredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson.    Holmes cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums. \nDredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on the wall. Holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other end of the pipe with the rod, and ZZZAPPPP!! \nThe electrical current RUNS ALONG THE PIPE, and KNOCKS Dredger back twenty more feet. (CONTINUED) \n58B     CONTINUED:                                                  58B Watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts running for it, frantic as -- \nDredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. He looks at the sparking rod and races for the window as well. \nWatson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as he's about to grab it... \nTHUD!   Dredger's massive foot STOMPS DOWN ON THE RING. \nDredger gives Watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the window, landing atop a heap of coal. Watson glares as -- \nHolmes blasts past him, leaps out the window.   Watson picks up the ring, sees: \nThe stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. Watson darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out -- \nOMITTED \n61      EXT. TOOLEY IRONWORKS - GATE                                   61 \nDredger runs down the street, knocking people out of his way. Holmes gives chase, darting around people, trailing Dredger through the gates of a huge commercial shipbuilders. Watson brings up the rear, as -- \n61A     OMITTED                                                       61A \n62      INT. SLIPWAY - DAY                                             62 \nDredger runs towards a SLIPWAY, which holds the UNFINISHED HULL OF A LARGE SHIP. The vessel can't be far from completion; it sits in a wheeled carriage designed to see it smoothly into water. \n63      EXT. UN-LAUNCHED SHIP - FIRST SLIPWAY                          63 \nFor now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back around the shed that they just ran through. \nHolmes trails the hulking form of Dredger into this network of struts. They weave through the shadows. \nHolmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly.    He takes an angle to cut off Dredger, and -- (CONTINUED) \n63    CONTINUED:                                                  63 ZAP! Holmes steps into Dredger's path, hitting him with the lightning-rod, knocking him back. ZAP!! Holmes gives another jolt, but the shaft starts to LOSE POWER. \nDredger knows there isn't much juice left. He reaches out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile. A moment of reckoning between Holmes and Dredger: \nThe shaft slowly... sizzles... out. Dredger tosses the rod. And now, Holmes backs away, as -- \nDredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at Holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing others out of his way. The ship LURCHES forward. \nWatson now turns away, completely irritated at Holmes' lack of understanding. \nHOLMES What you need is a rest. You and I could go out to the countryside. My brother Mycroft has a small estate near Chichester. It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. We could throw a lamb on the spit. \nWatson shakes his head in disbelief. \nWATSON If I were going to the country, I would be going with my future wife -- \nHOLMES Certainly. We should have her along. Let's get Gladstone out of the house as well. \nWATSON No, Holmes. Not you.   Me and her. You're not -- \nHOLMES Invited? Now you're not making any sense, Watson. Why would I not be invited to my own brother's country home? \n(CONTINUED) \n54B. 67   CONTINUED: (3)                                               67 WATSON You're not human. You don't get it, do you? You are this... (touches his own head) ... without this. \nHe touches his own heart.   They hear a BILLYCLUB hit the bars. \nPRISON GUARD John Watson?   You made bail. \nWatson steps up. Holmes looks confused.    He steps forward. But the Guard shakes his head. \nPRISON GUARD Just Watson. \nAs he slides open the bars, they see... MARY emerges from behind the Guard. Watson stands for a beat between Holmes and Mary. He must make a decision. And he does -- \n-- he leaves. \nHolmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary. She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson. The bars slide shut. \nThe mob surrounds Holmes.   He's never looked more alone. \nINT. LONDON JAIL - CORRIDOR Lestrade heads toward the holding room, flanked by prison wardens. \n(CONTINUED) \n68   CONTINUED:                                                   68 As the door is opened, the thug blasts out backwards, having just been battered through it by Holmes. \nHOLMES Lestrade -- your usual impeccable timing. \nLESTRADE You know, in another life, you'd have made an excellent criminal. \nHOLMES And you, sir, an excellent policeman. \n69   EXT. LONDON JAIL - DAY                                       69 \nHolmes and Lestrade march along. Lestrade holds out a copy of the newspaper. The headline reads: \"BLACKWOOD LIVES AND THE DEVIL WALKS WITH HIM! MURDERER RESURRECTED!\" \nLESTRADE Tell me you have answers. \nHOLMES All in good time. \nLESTRADE We don't have time. I've an office full of policemen hanging crosses over their desks. A public that's working itself into a frenzy... Holmes sees a dark, strange carriage waiting, door open. \nHOLMES Who's this? \nLESTRADE Try to behave yourself. They just paid a small fortune to bail you out. \n70   OMITTED                                                      70 \n71   INT.

Holmes shrugs. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \n72   INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS                         72 \nThe hood is pulled off. Holmes takes in the scene, eyes flicking around the room. \nHe's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers. \nSIR THOMAS Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this. I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are, and who I am. \nHOLMES As to where I am -- I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit -- need I go on? \nSomewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head. \nHOLMES As to who you are -- that took every ounce of my not- inconsiderable experience and skill... the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely. \nSir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is on a roll. \n(CONTINUED) \n56A. 72   CONTINUED:                                                    72 HOLMES Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders -- in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St. James Square. (beat) And as to the mystery -- the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place. \nSIR THOMAS Yes, well, it's standard procedure, I suppose. \nHolmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement on their part. \nSTANDISH (O.S.) I think we have the right man. \nHolmes turns to see JOHN STANDISH and LORD COWARD standing behind him. Standish is an American in his sixties. Coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s. \n(CONTINUED) \n72   CONTINUED: (2)                                               72 SIR THOMAS Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador Standish from America and Lord Coward, the Home Secretary. \n78E   INT. SIR THOMAS' SECRET ROOM                                  78E \nHolmes finds a desk with a prayer table, and ancient texts, spellbooks, one book open to a picture of Alexander the Great at the Sphinx. He steps toward -- \nAn ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar, four strange objects: a strand of human HAIR, a cow's BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER. \nHolmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of paper, just as -- \n78F                                                                 78F INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM -- Const. Clark and the Officer return, the Officer proudly hugging a 5 LB. CANNISTER OF JASMINE BATH SALTS. \nThey are startled by the secret room -- \n-- they are even more startled by the sight of Holmes kneeling at the altar and singing to himself. \nAs soon as they arrive, Holmes springs to his feet and walks out. Maybe he continues singing between words. HOLMES (vis   the secret room) I have no    idea what to make of that. (vis   the bath salts) Excellent    work. \n79    OMITTED                                                        79 \n80    INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS - DAY                  80 \nHolmes walks up the stairs and finds Watson's office door open. He is well into packing his things. The office is full of boxes, the walls and shelves are very sparse. \n(CONTINUED) \n66A. 80   CONTINUED:                                                 80 HOLMES Don't forget the wallpaper. \nWATSON There isn't any. \nHOLMES Figure of speech. \nHolmes steps into the room. \nHOLMES Since this room is no longer in use, do you mind if I employ it? \nWATSON Be my guest. \nHOLMES Bring him in, boys. \nHolmes steps aside. Two/three policemen enter carrying a large, heavy bag and unceremoniously dump it on Watson's desktop. They unzip the bag, revealing the dead body of the thug from Reordon's lodging. \n(CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED: (2)                                              80 WATSON Who was he? \nHOLMES My new roommate. He's an inspiring conversationalist. (alt: He has more humor than you.) \nWATSON Really. \nHOLMES No, he's your friend from Reordon's. He didn't survive Dredger landing on him. Poor fellow. But there is some consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his fellow men. \nWatson keeps packing. Holmes analyzes the body, starting, of all places, with the outer elbows and forearms of his coat. \nHolmes grabs various instruments and other items from Watson's newly-packed boxes. Frustrated, Watson snatches them back as quickly as Holmes takes them out. \n(CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED: (3)                                               80 HOLMES Elbows and arms stained with blood, but older than his own injuries. Plenty of it, layer on layer... \nHolmes scrapes at the layers of blood with his knife, examines it. \nHOLMES Though none of it human. \nWatson slows down slightly. He keeps packing, trying to resist the mystery, but it's not easy. \nHOLMES A butcher perhaps...?   What else? \nHolmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies the color of the flame carefully. Watson wrinkles his nose at the smell. \nHOLMES Hm -- predominantly yellow flame, but with distinct green bursts. Sulfurous. He spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin. \nHolmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his fingers like a connoisseur. \nHOLMES Coal... river silt... \nWatson slows down further, struggling. \nHOLMES That plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in... \nA hanging beat.   And Watson finally cracks, blurting out: \nWATSON Nine Elms. \nHOLMES Well done. Now, you didn't happen to pack the Lord's Register of members' interests, did you? \nWatson pulls it out of a box. \n(CONTINUED) \n68A. 80   CONTINUED: (4)                                              80 HOLMES See what Blackwood admits to owning. \nAs Watson flips through it, Holmes plucks a few chords on his violin, thinking. Watson finds the page. \nWATSON It's endless, he's had a hand in just about everything that's not good for you. \n(CONTINUED) \n80      CONTINUED: (5)                                                80 HOLMES Something brutal by the river... \nWATSON Woolwich Arsenal... Limehouse Chemical... Queenshithe Slaughterhouse, Nine Elms! \nHOLMES That's it, Watson! This should lead us right to Blackwood. \nHolmes leaps up and readies himself to leave. \nWATSON Not us, you. \nThis gives Holmes pause. \n84    EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT         84 \nAn industrial area on a bend of the Thames. Work doesn't stop when the sun goes down. Wharves stretch out into the water. WE SEE a boat is being loaded. We PULL BACK FROM the scene and look ACROSS the water. \nJust above the thump of industry we can hear a distinctive and irregular CHUGGING sound. Slowly a decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs INTO VIEW. Holmes is on the deck along with a much older man in a sailor's hat -- CAPTAIN TANNER. \nHOLMES Everything all right, Captain Tanner? \nCaptain Tanner has few teeth and a large white beard. \nTANNER Just a little leak, nothing to worry about. \nWatson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very serious leak. He's soaked, and furious. \nTANNER Not a great one for the water, are you, doctor? Army type, aren't you? You wouldn't have lasted long in the Navy. \nWatson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope. He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers: \nTANNER That's as far as we can go. \nHolmes starts clambering over the side.    Watson's pissed. \nWATSON There must be fifty yards of mud out there. \nHolmes' head is just visible before he drops over the prow.

A soft \"splosh\" as Holmes disappears. Watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind, watch, etc. He lays down his wallet and looks at Tanner. \nWATSON I know precisely how much money is in there. \nTANNER (taking the piss) I am sure you do, doctor. \nWatson glares, goes over the side, with his walking stick. \nOMITTED \n86   EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE                              86 \nHolmes and Watson emerge out of the shallows, covered in mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does. \nThey look up and see a jetty that heads out into the river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more THUGS are loading the boat with something. \nHolmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance, where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes' GUN. HOLMES What are you doing with my gun? \nWATSON Oh, please. \nHOLMES It was an honest mistake -- \nWATSON There was nothing honest about it. \nHolmes looks back at Watson, takes the gun, says nothing, the closest he'll come to a confession. Watson steps forward. \nWATSON Come on, let's get this over with. \n(CONTINUED) \n86   CONTINUED:                                                    86 They look out at the thugs guarding the door. Holmes whispers, trying to figure out the best strategy. \nHOLMES The one on the left seems more attentive, might prove easily distracted. The big one's been drinking -- whether for courage or from habit... Watson? \nWatson has already left. He simply walks up to the door and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun -- before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip. \nHolmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks. He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him. He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters -- \nOMITTED \n88   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - TUNNEL                      88 \nHolmes walks towards Watson who stands in the doorway, stopped in his tracks, spooked. Holmes catches up, passing Watson into -- \n89   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ANTECHAMBER                 89 \nShadows on shadows. Metal groans softly, like a plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move through it. \nAs they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables. He runs his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it. Quiet: \nHOLMES They cleared something out of here, not minutes ago... \nHolmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore. \nWATSON (O.S.) Holmes.   You need to see this. \nHolmes looks up, and sees Watson standing at a set of doors. \n(CONTINUED) \n89   CONTINUED:                                                     89 Holmes pulls out a CIGAR-CUTTER, CLIPS off the rat's TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins Watson, stepping into -- \n90   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - FACTORY FLOOR                90 \nA massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now. An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I- beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the wind. \nOn the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118. \nWATSON One-eighteen.    It's a date, a time? \nHolmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking. \nHOLMES It's chapter and verse. Revelation 1:18. `I am He that liveth, and was dead.' \nAnother voice completes the passage, echoing from above: \nBLACKWOOD (O.S.) `And behold, I am alive forevermore, and have the keys of hell and of death. Amen.' \n90A   CONTINUED: (3)                                              90A -- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal, facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of boiling water. \nAs Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant- looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) \nWatson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch. \nIrene rides the belt upwards.   Holmes clambers the equipment, following her. \nUp ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes them. \nHolmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt, catches up to Irene -- \n-- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW. \nHolmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled. \nThen both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH. Whew! \nWatson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK! \nA bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps moving towards the giant band saw. \nShit a brick. \nIRENE Sherlock? \nNow, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his might -- \n-- smashes the shackle lock. \nIrene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her right hand. \nThe bandsaw whines viciously. \nIrene swings aside, just misses it. \n(CONTINUED) \n80A. 90A   CONTINUED: (4)                                             90A Gets a free haircut. \nThen Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she can free her right hand (a move not possible with both shackles). \nIrene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME. \nWatson sprints towards where they fell, looks down -- \n-- sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut- in-half pig carcasses. They're okay. \nWatson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door, looking for Blackwood. \nIrene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile -- \nIRENE Thank you so much. I owe you. \n-- pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson.    Holmes grabs her, stops her. \nHOLMES You owe me information. (angry) No more games, Irene. \nShe hears Watson opening the door to the dock. She looks at Holmes, their eyes locking. Finally, the truth: \nIRENE Blackwood's manufactured large- scale weapons for years. Lately there've been rumors of something new. More powerful than anything else. And... magical. My job is to find out if the rumors are true.

Holmes trails her, processing. They blast through the doors to -- \n91    EXT. NINE ELMS JETTY                                            91 \nWatson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock. He sees: Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into the darkness. \nHolmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson. Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something on the planks: \nSteel drums are dripping.    A chemical.   Holmes recognizes it. \nHOLMES Watson! \nWatson continues down the dock, tripping a wire connected to the steel drums, he turns realizing he has set off a trap and turns back to warn the others -- \nWATSON Holmes... \nA metallic conductor SPARKS.    Time slows.   BOOM! \nThe drums of chemicals all EXPLODE! A blinding conflagration engulfing Watson. For a moment, it lights up all of London. \nHOLMES WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!! \nHolmes is pushed back   by the explosion as the rest of the barrels that line the   dock begin exploding arond them -- it looks as it Watson   hasn't survived. BOOM! Irene is knocked to the ground   by the blasts and flying debris. \nHolmes races towards her as more explosions, flames and debris fly all around him in slow motion, occasionally knocking him to the ground. \nHe reaches Irene, picks her up and grabs part of an exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover -- BOOM! The barrel splinters as a final blast knocks them down, but to safety. \nAs he opens his eyes -- \n(CONTINUED) \n91   CONTINUED:                                                  91 We see Lestrade and his men swarming the scene, they spot Watson, alive, but unconscious. Irene has disappeared. Holmes sees this and heads toward his friend, but -- \n-- is intercepted by Constable Clark. \nCONSTABLE CLARK There's an order for your arrest all the way from the top, sir -- so you'll have to hit me now. \nHOLMES From Lord Coward? \nCONSTABLE CLARK Yes, sir, so make it look good. \n-- but not obscuring the light of instability in his eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified. \n94B-94E OMITTED                                                 94B-94E \n95     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   95 \nHolmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling. \nHe pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone, hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house. \nGathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12 o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock). The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's fang to his left (at 9 o'clock). \nThen with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle around each image and a circle directly in the center of the four other circles. He then draws lines which join the circles together in the shape of a cross. \nIn the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around that circle. \nHe lights four candles (one at each point of the cross) then stands in the center of the circle. \nHe pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade, cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto the ground just outside the circle. (CONTINUED) \n85A. 95   CONTINUED:                                                    95 Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting. \nSuddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that. \nBLACKWOOD (O.S.) And now it dawns on you, you begin to recognize your part in his play. \nHolmes snaps around, Blackwood has appeared behind him within the outer circle of flame. \nBLACKWOOD You see the path he chose for you. \nHolmes sways, fuzzy.   He struggles to focus on Blackwood. \n(CONTINUED) \n95   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 95 BLACKWOOD Didn't you wonder why it was so easy to catch me? I told you I needed five lives for my resurrection. Why would I take a sixth under St. Paul's? \nHolmes shakes his head, he can barely see straight. \nBLACKWOOD Unless I simply wanted to be caught by the great Sherlock Holmes... \nBlackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at Holmes' head. \nBLACKWOOD ... so I could die on the biggest stage of all. You made me what I am. \nWe see -- \nHOLMES' POV \nas Blackwood swings the sacrificial sword at Holmes' head. It looks as if Holmes has no time to react -- \nWHOOSH -- the sword WIPES the FRAME -- \n96   OMITTED                                                        96 \n97   INT.

Holmes sees a hazy image of Irene. She leans over him smiling sweetly then wraps her hands around his neck and starts to strangle him. \nIRENE SAYING \"WHERE'S WATSON WHEN YOU NEED HIM?\" \nBLACKWOOD IN THE ROOM AGAIN WITHIN THE FLAME CIRCLE. \nThen he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion -- he thinks -- BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big question mark. Where? Who? \nHolmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang as if willing the flashes to come. \nINT. PUNCH BOWL PUB The music stops. Irene and Watson notice the silence. They swap a glance. A beat. And Holmes emerges. \nHOLMES I need a map of London. \n102   INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   102 \nHolmes is excited, electric. \nHOLMES Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this system, to get inside it, I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt... with a few enhancements of my own. \nWATSON At minimum. \nWatson and Irene shoot Holmes knowing looks. \nHOLMES My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended. \nIRENE Yes, your little white tail got rather dirty. \nHOLMES But I have emerged enlightened... The fraternity who silently control the Empire, share the belief with the Kings, Pharoahs, and Emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power -- \nHe tosses Watson the pages from Sir Thomas. \nHOLMES It is made up of four parts: The Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man -- (CONTINUED) \n90A. 102   CONTINUED:                                                 102 He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx, covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body, Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face. \nHOLMES In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man. Map! \nWatson throws the map down on the floor, really flying now. \nHOLMES Now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system. \nHe runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a cross... \nThen he picks up the charcoal and (following the map) draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight through the middle of the cross that he drew on the floor. \nHOLMES Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men. Each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the Temple, therefore the System. (beat) Reordon, the ginger midget, represents Man. We found his body here... \nHe points to a spot on the map south of the Thames. It corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew that has the hair (6 o'clock). \nHOLMES Then Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple, wore the ox ring... he died here... \nAgain the spot Holmes points is directly north of the river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has the ox bone (12 o'clock). \n(CONTINUED) \n90B. 102   CONTINUED: (2)                                              102 HOLMES Standish was Ambassador to America, where the Eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years -- and not by coincidence. \nHolmes points to the map. \nHOLMES The headquarters of Temple of the Four Orders where he died is here... \nHe points to corresponding points on the map and on the cross. \nWATSON Man, Ox, Eagle... \nHe connects the dots on the map.   They form three points of a cross. \nWATSON And last on the list:    the Lion. Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the map... \nHOLMES Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act. Right here. \nTheir eyes widen as they realize what they're seeing. WATSON Parliament. \nIRENE What is the meaning of this circle? \nIrene indicates the fifth circle Holmes has drawn -- the point at which the other four come together. They look to where it would correspond to on the map -- right in the middle of the river. \nHOLMES It is the fifth element -- the ethereal. That which can't yet be known. \n(CONTINUED) \n102    CONTINUED: (3)                                              102 WATSON It's right in the middle of the River Thames. \nBOOM! They hear doors slamming outside, boots echoing. Irene looks out the window, sees POLICE OFFICERS flooding the pub. \nIRENE Police. \nHolmes folds up his piece of paper, hands it to Watson. He quickly moves to a hatch in the floor. Flings it open. \nHOLMES Ladies first. \nIrene jumps down.   Watson is about to follow her down. \nHOLMES Follow these plans. \nWatson goes down. It looks as though Holmes is about to join them when Lestrade and his men burst into the room. Holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards Lestrade. \n102A                                                               102A INT.

Irene looks out, her eyes narrow. \nHOLMES Watson, did you bring my clothes? \nWatson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL. Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets it. He's never going to like guns. \n(CONTINUED) \n107    CONTINUED: (2)                                              107 Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot. \nIRENE Starting early, aren't we? \nHe offers the flask to her. \nHOLMES Trust me, have a drink. \nShe can see this is more than a social invitation, she takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson, Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers. \nWATSON What are we doing in the sewers? \nHOLMES Patience, Doctor. I am about to show you... \nAs they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward Big Ben, the time moving toward noon. \n107A                                                               107A EXT.

They look down a long tunnel to: \nThe area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the flashback ceremony with the sword. But now: \nBlackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it, a futuristic device: \nHOLMES Behold, Blackwood's magic. \nA black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE. Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet: \nHOLMES A chemical weapon. The first of its kind. Cyanide, to be precise. \nWATSON You can tell that from here? \nHOLMES No.   I can tell it from here. He pulls something out of his pocket:    the RAT TAIL. \nHOLMES I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs of cyanide. \nHe points at the device and the exposed shaft over it. \nHOLMES That shaft leads directly to Parliament. When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas. \nIRENE All of the people inside that building -- \nWATSON Will be dead at the strike of noon.

As she falls, Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the bridge. But Irene doesn't pause: \nShe swings her legs through the air, trying to take out Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and KICKS DOWN and -- \nIRENE FALLS OFF THE BRIDGE. \nBLACKWOOD You're better off without her, Holmes! \nHigh above:   a RAVEN lands. \n(CONTINUED) \n119H   CONTINUED: (2)                                             119H EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - WALKWAY - DAY \nA look between them and then it's on. Holmes grabs a short section of wooden batten out of the railing. Flimsy, no match for the sword -- \n-- which is immediately apparent as Blackwood comes in, slashes, chops six inches off the batten. \nBLACKWOOD I planned to kill a handful of senile old men to make this empire strong... but now because of you thousands are going to die. \nHolmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before, his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self defense third. \nBLACKWOOD All I have to do is break this cylinder. The wind will do the rest. And you'll be the first. \nThe two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword out, awaiting Holmes. Holmes swings towards the blade and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it. \nHolmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They continue to spar, now bound. \nBlackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge. \nBlackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood knocked from Irene's hand earlier). \nBlackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a circle around him. \nHolmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to go) -- his eyes lock on to something. He looks back to Blackwood. \n-- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls -- \n-- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking Blackwood around his ankle.

His fingers are white from strain. Holmes remains cool. \nHOLMES There was never any magic.   Only conjuring tricks. \nAbove Holmes:   the raven starts PECKING at a rope. \nHOLMES The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard... \nHolmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS. \nHOLMES (guard choking/ payoff) Who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. Your reputation and your jailers' fear did the rest. (burial ground/ licking rocks) Others required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe -- a mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals. (bath/Reordon flashback) Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science. Very clever of Reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.

(Standish in rain/ pulling the trigger/ wharf explosion) The death of Standish was a real mystery, until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf. An odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid -- yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered your Temple? All it took was a spark. A simple rigged bullet in his gun. Ingenious. (Parliament/flask/ ceremony, dev ice) Like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance for the end. Had it worked, your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them. They didn't know that you had given them the antidote -- at one of your ceremonies I suspect. Instead, they would have believed it was magic and that you harnessed the ultimate power. \nEND FLASHBACKS. \n(CONTINUED) \n119H   CONTINUED: (5)                                            119H Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind whips harder. \nHolmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops, hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to topple. \n(NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale that Holmes played earlier for his flies.) \nHOLMES You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them. \nIN B.G.: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings, strikes another crane... \nBLACKWOOD Cut me loose, Holmes! \nBlackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile. \nMARY What's in all those notebooks? \nWATSON Nothing really...

Turns him around. \nHOLMES Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon. \nWATSON Get on with it, Holmes. \nHOLMES Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook -- I believe my legs have fallen asleep. I should probably come down. \nMARY Shouldn't you help him, John? \nWATSON I hate to stop when he's on a roll. Do carry on, Holmes. \nWatson and Mary walk by. \nHOLMES The executioner attached it to a harness, thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact. My lord, I can't feel my cheeks. Might we continue this at ground level? \nWATSON How did you manage it, Holmes? \n(CONTINUED) \n123B   CONTINUED: (2)                                            123B HOLMES I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook. Please, Watson, my tongue is going next. I'll be of no use to you at all. \nWATSON Worse things could happen. \nMARY John. \nWatson draws his sword. \nWATSON But none of this explains the lack of a pulse. \nHe finally uses his sword stick and slices Holmes down. Holmes tumbles to the ground. \nHOLMES There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum. It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis. Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and well-trained as your own. It is known locally as -- \nMARY What's wrong with Gladstone? \nHOLMES -- mad honey disease. \nCLOSEUP OF WATSON'S DOG \nStiff as a board. \nHOLMES He is demonstrating the very effect I've just described.

They are interrupted by a knock on the door. Constable Clark enters. \nCONSTABLE CLARK Mr. Holmes... Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, right away. \nHOLMES What is it this time, Clarky? \nCONSTABLE CLARK It's one of our sergeants, sir. He went missing in the sewers, the day you stopped Lord Blackwood... Well, a maintenance man found his body this morning. We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene. Shot in the head. \nHOLMES Were there powder burns on his eyebrows? \nClarky nods. \nCONSTABLE CLARK Yes. \nWATSON Point blank range. \nHOLMES With small caliber bullet. \nCONSTABLE CLARK Indeed. \nHOLMES Moriarty. \nHolmes and Watson look at each other -- complete change of demeanor -- mind racing, looking concerned. \nThe dog has regained its vital signs. \nMARY There's a brave boy...

This is PROFESSOR MORIARTY. \nIrene is made to wait as Moriarty finishes writing a complex mathematical equation (in astronomy), folds the paper to reveal that it is addressed to THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY, cracks open the carriage window and slides the folded paper partway out. \nSomeone waiting outside takes the paper, and their footsteps clatter away. \nMoriarty closes the window, and the carriage starts moving. A full beat goes by before he turns to Irene, finally prepared to engage with her. \nMORIARTY I assume he'll do it? \nIRENE Not for money, but for me.

The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning. \nThe coach stops. \n78B                                                                78B EXT.

SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM                                    78C \nHolmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away -- \nCONSTABLE CLARK We've checked everything. No sign of a break-in. The Butler didn't hear anything. The body was in the tub, eyes wide open -- -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air. \nCONSTABLE CLARK (realizing Holmes isn't there) -- only his ring was missing. \nHe turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode. Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best -- this is, in fact, why he exists. \nHolmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket). \nThe tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing. (CONTINUED) \n65A. 78C   CONTINUED:                                                78C HOLMES Why did you drain the water? \nPOLICE OFFICER Out of common decency. \nHOLMES (incensed) Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse. \nNeither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up, opens it, sniffs it. \nHOLMES Hmm... \nHolmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose. \nHOLMES What is that? \nPOLICE OFFICER (smelling) Uhhhh... jasmine? \nHOLMES Superb. I suspect this comes from a larger cannister. It'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. And, Constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own. \nBoth cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss. \nHOLMES Data, data, data! I cannot make bricks without clay! \nThe cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's- eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill. Sometimes he hums or sings to himself. \nHolmes is happy. \nHe glances around the room, sees the chair where Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself.

The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open. \nHolmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of TALCUM POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing: \n(CONTINUED) \n78C   CONTINUED: (3)                                              78C FINGERPRINTS on one of the panels. \nHe pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to reveal a SECRET ROOM.

HOUSE OF LORDS                                          115 \nBlackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked. Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of anyone going to open them. \nINT. SEWER TUNNEL - DAY Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place. Shaped charge, Victorian-style. \nHOLMES We need a light, a match -- \nIrene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle:   her KNIFE. She rolls up a sleeve. \nIRENE Got it... Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the device -- \n-- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice. \nThat's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for long enough because -- \nBONG! \nIRENE (breath crushing out of her) Three. \n(CONTINUED) \n116    CONTINUED:                                                  116 ON THE DEVICE AS IT GOES ACTIVE \nThe batteries begin to fizz madly, cams turn, gears ratchet past each other. Bad news. \nWATSON (O.S.) Hey! \nDredger turns his head so that he can see Watson, on his belly, crawled from the sewer -- where he found HOLMES' GUN. \nBAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's back (aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the through-and-through) -- \n-- and continue to burn inside Dredger. He lurches away, eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream. \nBONG! \nIRENE Two! \nHolmes and Irene stagger for the device. \nFizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a tree. \nWatson is face-down on the stones, still.   The gun falls out of his limp hand. \nIrene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade, and... \nZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade, redirecting the spark toward -- \nHolmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK!   The shaped charge shears the steel rods. \nHolmes and Irene reach for the cylinders. \nBONG! \n116A                                                               116A OMITTED \n117    INT.

I see before me a conspiracy of arrogant old men puffed up by the illusion of their own vainglory. In your hands this once great parliament has become nothing more than a drunken satyr, stumbling about the world's stage seeking nothing more than to satiate your own lust and gluttony; your britches stained by the incontinence of your hypocrisy. I will not sit idly by and watch you violate the innocence of the public trust as you drag this great Empire into the quagmire that your pride has dug and filled with the excrement of your corruption. I am here to change all this. \nHe raises his hand and traces a circle in the air.   A circle of flame erupts on the opposite wall. \nBLACKWOOD I am the fourth horseman. \nHe raises his hand and traces a triangle in the air.     A triangle of flame erupts on the opposite wall. \nBLACKWOOD I am the pale rider. \nHe raises his hand and traces a second triangle in the air. The second triangle of flame erupts on the opposite wall to complete the pentagram within the circle. \nBLACKWOOD And my name to you is death. \n117A                                                                117A INT.

Coward looks confused, scared. Other Temple members eye him. \nBlackwood hits the remote again. But again, nothing happens. WE SEE something new in his eyes: fear. He ducks away fast, disappearing into the gallery. \n117D                                                             117D OMITTED \n118    INT.

(beat) My ankle's done. \nWatson looks around. \nWATSON Where's Irene? \nHolmes turns, looks. The cylinders are gone, and so is Irene. His face darkens. He misread her yet again. \nWATSON Holmes, I'm sorry... \nHolmes sees Irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze of tunnels. He motions to the disabled device. \nHOLMES Make sure Lestrade keeps it intact. \nWatson nods.   He watches Holmes sprint into the darkness, face grim. \n118A                                                                118A INT.

SEWER TUNNELS - DAY                                   118B \nIrene hears Holmes' angry footsteps behind her, turns, sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels and columns. She picks up speed. CUT TO: \nANGLE FROM THE SIDE \nBlackwood enters the maze of tunnels, hears, then sees Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away. \nThen Holmes. \nBlackwood follows them.    Sees something on the ground ahead -- pauses. \nIt's WATSON'S SWORD STICK, flung there from the previous action with Dredger. \nBlackwood scoops it up. \n118C                                                              118C INT. SINGLE SEWER TUNNEL - DAY Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower -- \n-- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn sideways to continue. \nThe sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward. \nAnd then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head. The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into the pipe, into the unknown. \n118D   INT. PIPE - DAY                                            118D \nThe pipe angles down, damp, horrible. For a long moment it is pitch black, pinched down. Irene's quick, anxious breath the only point of reference. \nThis is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly claustrophobic as it gets. \nThen, almost imperceptibly, light. \nWe can make out Irene's determined profile. Light increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement. \n118E   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118E \nThe pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be the cellar of a building. Stonework fairly new. \nDim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it. \n118F   INT.

CELLAR - ON THE LADDER - DAY                           118G \nIrene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other -- reaches an iron grate, has to use all her strength to shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this is a grind. \n118H                                                               118H INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY Irene emerges at the base of a dark, hollow building full of construction equipment, and sees, yes -- \n-- more stairs, upward.   The only ready way out. \nGritting her teeth, chest heaving, Irene charges the stairs -- \n118I   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118I -- just as Holmes pops out of the pipe, vaults onto the fixed ladder and swarms up it. Anger lends him energy. \n118J   INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY                                  118J \nIN A SERIES OF TIME JUMPS MARKED BY INCREASING EXHAUSTION: \nIrene finally makes it to a floor in the building that is flooded with sky-bright daylight. \nShe surges for light -- a brick-framed window -- and -- \nSMASH CUT TO: \n118K   EXT.

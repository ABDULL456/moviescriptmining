CARRIAGE Irene sits, turns to address a man-shaped shadow filling the opposite corner of the carriage. Before she can speak, a gesture from the shadow stills her. This is PROFESSOR MORIARTY. \nIrene is made to wait as Moriarty finishes writing a complex mathematical equation (in astronomy), folds the paper to reveal that it is addressed to THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY, cracks open the carriage window and slides the folded paper partway out. \nSomeone waiting outside takes the paper, and their footsteps clatter away. \nMoriarty closes the window, and the carriage starts moving. A full beat goes by before he turns to Irene, finally prepared to engage with her. \nMORIARTY I assume he'll do it? \nIRENE Not for money, but for me.   I wager he'll find our man within twenty-four hours. \nMORIARTY You wager?

Within a nanosecond, Moriarty extends his hand into which a PISTOL appears, delivered by a concealed mechanism (Travis Bickle style). \nThe gun rests on the Beggar's forehead. The cold eyes of the man that holds the weapon bore into the skull of the Beggar, who backs off in fear. The carriage moves on. \n35   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT                         35 \nHolmes is washing his face in a basin on the other side of the room, completely transformed now, utterly alive.

I won't interrupt. \nHOLMES It doesn't matter -- \nWATSON What could she possibly need? An alibi, a beard, a human canoe. She can sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames... \nHolmes grabs the envelope back. \nHOLMES Regrettably, we've had our last case together. Those are my dates. \nWATSON I've already read it. Luke Reordon, four foot ten, red hair, missing two front teeth. \nHolmes picks up his violin. \nWATSON Case solved! You're just not her type, Holmes. She likes ginger dwarfs. \nHOLMES Midget! \nWATSON So you agree? \nHOLMES No, I don't agree. It's more than a technicality. You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened people. \nWATSON I've upset you, I can tell.    I've said too much. \n(CONTINUED) \n36A. 35     CONTINUED: (2)                                              35 HOLMES No, I'm just saying, one has disproportionate limbs the other does not. \nWATSON Alright.   What were you just doing? \nHOLMES Will you allow me to explain. \nWATSON That's what I've been trying to do. \nHolmes plucks his violin, the notes play over a FLASHBACK of the previous scene, all from HOLMES' POINT OF VIEW. \n36     FLASHBACK - INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT           36 \nWe see Irene step out. \nIRENE Why don't I see myself out. \nOnce Irene leaves, he steps quickly to a window, and looks out to see her walking down Baker Street, turning down an alley. He bolts    into -- \n36A    INT. 221 BAKER ST. - CORRIDOR                               36A \nHe sees Watson coming up the stairs. Before Watson can speak, Holmes snatches his coat and runs down the other end of the corridor. He JUMPS out the window to -- \n37     EXT. 221 BAKER ST. - REAR YARD                               37 \nHolmes flies from the window and lands neatly on a tin roof. The jump to the next level is a more taxing prospect. Holmes weighs the distance and hurls himself down with a determined look. He lands just right. \n37A-37D OMITTED                                               37A-37D \n38    EXT. COAL SHED                                                 38 \nHolmes jumps off the shed, heads for the street one block over from Baker Street. \n38A   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            38A \nHe runs down the mews in great haste, stops at the same alley that Irene disappeared into -- but at the other side. \nCUT TO: \nHOLMES' POV DOWN ALLEY \nfrom concealment:    Irene walks towards a MAN HOLDING A BUNCH OF ROSES. \nMAN WITH ROSES Got some roses for you, sweetheart. Cut you a deal `cos you're so pretty. \nIRENE Oh, how nice of you. \nEven without the man -- who is scrofulous and sly -- no woman in her right mind would go down this alley. \n38B                                                                 38B INT. ALLEY The man with the roses beckons Irene forward. Another man steps in behind her, trapping her. He closes in to grab her -- \n-- and WHAP!WHAP!WHAP! Gets three cosh-strikes across the chin, dropping him immediately. \nStill holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up against the bricks with Irene's hand over his mouth. \nQuick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor-sharp knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to his collar. The move ends with Irene's finger over her own mouth, signalling the mugger to be quiet. He obeys, eyes bulging. \nIrene frisks him expertly. She's mugging the mugger. There is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on. \n", "test1_id": 999, "test2_input": "(CONTINUED) \n37A. 38B   CONTINUED:                                                  38B IRENE Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look like yours, does it? And -- naughty boy -- here's another one. I'll return them, shall I? \nShe takes both wallets, takes the roses -- \nIRENE These are lovely, thank you. \n-- and leaves, stepping daintily over the crumpled man on the floor. \nOn second thoughts, she turns back, takes his wallet too, then leaves. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE ON HOLMES \nHOLMES Now, that's the Irene I know. \nHe hurries after Irene down the alley. \n38C                                                                  38C EXT. LONDON STREET Holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of Irene through a STREET FAIR, which is being assembled. \nHolmes picks up the pace. \nHe snatches a HAT from a one-eyed old BEGGAR with his hand out. He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin and snatches the beggar's eye patch too. \nHe runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews it to blacken his teeth. \nHe pauses to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat on a fairground fire-breather's flames, runs on. \n39    EXT. LONDON STREET                                              39 \nHolmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously. Again he stops the coach and again the gun comes out, but this time we can see that Holmes gets a view of the man on the other end of the weapon before the carriage pulls away. \n37B. \n40   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS (PRESENT)             40 \nHolmes strums one more chord on his violin, thinking. \nIrene's bag of money still sits on the table. \nHOLMES This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge. \nWATSON Which is no mean feat. \nHOLMES She's intimidated, scared... \nWATSON And yet she works for him. That's bad money. It's nothing to do with me, but leave this case. \nHolmes motions to the bills. \nHOLMES Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to make a living. After all, I'll be paying the rent entirely on my own. \nWATSON You know what, I've had just about enough -- \nHOLMES Clarky! \nVOICE (O.S.) Mister Holmes, sir...? \nHe turns to see... CONSTABLE CLARK standing at the door. Breathless, pale, scared. \nCONSTABLE CLARK Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, at once. \n(CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:                                           40 HOLMES (mumbles) What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a compass. You means us. \nWATSON Us means you. \nCONSTABLE CLARK It's Lord Blackwood, sir. It appears he's come back from the dead. \nWATSON Well that's clever seeing as how I pronounced him dead myself. \nCONSTABLE CLARK A groundsman saw him walking through the graves, just this morning. \nWATSON I'll leave this one in your capable hands. I have tea with Mary and her parents this evening. \nWatson walks into his office. \nHOLMES It is not my reputation at stake here. \nWATSON Are you taking this seriously? \nHOLMES Like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not. \nThey all move to the exit. \nHOLMES Watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked. \nClarky laughs. \n38aA. \n41   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY                 41 \nJudging by the estate, Blackwood comes from old money, and lots of it. We FOLLOW the carriage hurrying Holmes and Watson forward. \n42   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD BURIAL PLOT - DAY                           42 \nGenerations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble memorials. Not a place for a picnic, not even on a bright sunny day -- and it's starting to rain. \nA COP stops the carriage, opens the door. Holmes and Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather FORENSICS KIT. \nThey walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family Crypt. Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump of trees in the distance. \nWATSON Look at this mess. Nothing but standard-issue police bootprints. Any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled. \n", "test2_true": "38A. 42   CONTINUED:                                                   42 HOLMES Scotland Yard at their finest, once again. \nPolice lamps light one large marble CRYPT. The cops are in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked. They'd rather be anywhere but here. \nAs Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors of the crypt have been BLASTED OPEN FROM THE INSIDE. Holmes and Watson share a quick glance -- this is interesting. \nLestrade emerges from the crypt.   He is sweating, shaken. \n(CONTINUED) \n42   CONTINUED: (2)                                                42 Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves it off. \nLESTRADE Look at those slabs of marble -- they're half a ton each if they're a pound -- smashed outward like they were nothing. \nOn second thought, Lestrade does take Holmes' handkerchief. \nLESTRADE Explain it if you can, Holmes. \nHolmes inspects the door, checking the hinges. He notices the Blackwood CREST, and the image of a SPHINX. \nHOLMES And the coffin? \nLESTRADE We're digging it up now. The witness is over there. You can question him if you like -- but you won't get much. \nThe old GROUNDSKEEPER, pale and terrified, stands out of the rain under an ancient cypress tree. \nWatson heads for him.   Holmes disappears in the opposite direction. \nAs soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in each hand, drags his boys in close. He doesn't want Holmes or Watson to hear this. \nLESTRADE (low, angry) If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch of superstitious milk maids, you're on double-time! You're an embarrassment! Also, you're forbidden to talk about this to anyone, not a word. Are we bloody clear on that? \nThe cops nod, duly chastened. \nCUT TO: \n(CONTINUED) \n42   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  42 THE GROUNDSKEEPER \nmumbles the Lord's Prayer under his breath. Watson immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse, looking in his eyes. \nThe Groundskeeper just keeps praying. Watson takes a boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth and gently sits him down. \nHolmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree. \nWATSON He's in shock.     We should give him a few moments. \nLestrade stomps up. \nLESTRADE The witness stated that he saw Lord Blackwood rise from the grave. (at Watson, accusingly) Well? You pronounced the man dead. \nWATSON (stung) He had no pulse. HOLMES Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore? \nLestrade shakes his head.    It hasn't been a good day for him, or the Yard. \nThere's a clunk. They all turn to see the coffin has been extracted from the crypt. \nFour beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin. They place it on the ground, step back, crossing themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified. Holmes chuckles. \nLESTRADE OPEN IT!! \n(CONTINUED) \n42   CONTINUED: (4)                                              42 But no one moves. The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if it were red-hot. Watson's had enough. He marches forward -- \n-- snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and levers it off with a slow, eerie groan. \nHolmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward. \nThe coffin is filled with EARTH, overflowing. They brush away a layer of dirt, to reveal... A DEAD BODY in the coffin. The body is a much smaller man than Blackwood, in everyday clothes, with red hair. \nLESTRADE That's not Blackwood. \nHOLMES Now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious... \nWatson opens his forensic kit, disturbed. Vials, silver tools. He takes a CALIPER, begins examining the body. \nWATSON Lividity is late stage. Diptera deposits are approximately -- (measuring) -- three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago. \nHOLMES Inspector, may I see your pen? \nLestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned. Holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth, revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw. \nWATSON Missing two incisors in the upper jaw... (a look at Holmes) Adler's midget. \nHolmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt-filled pocket. He uses the pen to fish out: a POCKET WATCH. \nHOLMES All yours, Inspector. \nHolmes hands the pen back to Lestrade. Lestrade looks at it with dismay, takes it in Holmes' handkerchief -- a small measure of revenge. \n(CONTINUED) \n42     CONTINUED: (5)                                               42 Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt. Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the dusty pocket watch. \nHOLMES Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound. Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid. This one has five, so the owner -- \nGROUNDSKEEPER (O.S.) He was walking. \nThey all stop, suddenly. The old Groundskeeper stands in front of them, ready to unburden himself. \nGROUNDSKEEPER (quivering voice) He was walking but his feet didn't touch the ground. And I'm not daft, I know what I saw and I know Lord Blackwood. He was as alive as you or me. It's not right. It's not natural. (turns, leaves) Our Father Who art in heaven... (etc.) \nAll three men watch the Groundskeeper go. A sudden gust of wind moans eerily. They all want to get the hell out of there. \nHOLMES Now the game is afoot, Watson. \n", "test2_id": 1000, "test3_input": "78E   INT.

He steps toward -- \nAn ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx.

Two/three policemen enter carrying a large, heavy bag and unceremoniously dump it on Watson's desktop. They unzip the bag, revealing the dead body of the thug from Reordon's lodging. \n(CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED: (2)                                              80 WATSON Who was he? \nHOLMES My new roommate.

But there is some consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his fellow men. \nWatson keeps packing.

He keeps packing, trying to resist the mystery, but it's not easy. \nHOLMES A butcher perhaps...?   What else? \nHolmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies the color of the flame carefully. Watson wrinkles his nose at the smell. \nHOLMES Hm -- predominantly yellow flame, but with distinct green bursts. Sulfurous. He spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin. \nHolmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his fingers like a connoisseur. \nHOLMES Coal... river silt... \nWatson slows down further, struggling. \nHOLMES That plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in... \nA hanging beat.

He stays standing as they all sit -- all except STANDISH. \nSTANDISH What's the meaning of this?   Why did you call us here? \nLORD COWARD Sir Thomas is dead. Effective immediately, I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the Order. \nSTANDISH Are you mad, Coward? Have you any idea what he's capable of? \nBLACKWOOD (O.S.) Of course he does. It's why he's here. \nBlackwood enters. He looks as if he's been to hell, and come back more powerful than ever. \nThe crowd is stunned. Standish looks at Coward, betrayed, turns to the others -- who are transfixed by the sight of Blackwood suddenly kneeling before them. \nBLACKWOOD I am humbled. I am honored. (beat) My powers and my assets -- munitions, shipping, industry -- they were given to me for a purpose. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED:                                                    83 BLACKWOOD (CONT'D) A magnificent and simple purpose. A different future... a future ruled by us. \nBlackwood stands, prowls. \nBLACKWOOD You've made policy in secret for centuries. Now, you'll make it openly. \nThe men are beginning to like what they hear. \nBLACKWOOD The first act is a necessary one, for without death there can be no rebirth... (beat) ... at noon tomorrow, we will take the first step towards a new chapter in history. (beat) England will know our power. Then, the whole world will. Across the Atlantic lies a colony that was once ours, and will be again. Their civil war weakened them; their government is as corrupt and ineffective as ours. We'll take it from them. (beat) With their resources and our power, we'll remake the world, we'll create the future. (beat) Are you with me? \nSTANDISH No, sir, we are not! (turning to the others) The powers he's playing with are beyond any man's control. \nBLACKWOOD They're limitless -- even death holds no sway. \nSTANDISH Help me stop him before it's too late. \nNobody moves.   Blackwood smiles -- he's won. \n(CONTINUED) \n71A. 83    CONTINUED: (2)                                                 83 In desperation, Standish pulls a gun.   But as he aims it at Blackwood - \nBLACKWOOD I wouldn't do that. \n-- he IGNITES, combusting with an impossible BLAST OF BLINDING HOT FLAMES! \nThe men in the room reel backwards, shocked, terrified. \nFlames consuming him, Standish flails, crashing through a window out to -- \n83A   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                     83A \nThe fireball plummets through the sky, lighting city blocks. People look up, gape, and -- \nWHOOMPF! Standish lands on the roof of a carriage. Horses and carriages SCREECH to a stop. \nThe flames flicker blinding white, as his body contorts, melting away. People scream, gasp, faint, cross themselves, as they witness this unnatural act. \n83B                                                                  83B INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS Blackwood turns away from the window, surveys them.     They are terrified, but they are with him. \n(CONTINUED) \n83B   CONTINUED:                                                83B \nBlackwood turns to Coward, nods. \nCoward produces a brimming silver chalice. \nBLACKWOOD Come, drink your allegiance here. \nThe members line up to drink from a CHALICE. It doesn't taste good, but it tastes like power. As they drink, Blackwood leans close to Coward: \n(CONTINUED) \n83B   CONTINUED: (2)                                                83B BLACKWOOD You control the police.   Use them. \nCoward nods. \n", "test3_id": 1001}

84   INT. MORGUE - NIGHT                                              84 
A cadaver drawer slides open revealing - not Tango - but Rivera, staring up lifeless, his arms, stomach, legs and toes dotted with the scabs of a longtime addict. 
DETECTIVE Did you know his girlfriend? Good- looking girl. One of his informants.

RICHIE Beth. 
The medical examiner slides open another cadaver drawer containing her body. Richie stares at it. 
DETECTIVE Should've seen their place.    Like animals lived there. 
RICHIE I have seen it. 
DETECTIVE (to the examiner) Chose a good night, huh?   Grand Central Station in here. 
MEDICAL EXAMINER It's been like this. I'm lucky I get home before midnight; lots of careless- ness. 
Richie regards Rivera's personal effects resting on his chest in a plastic bag: few bucks, the Corvette key, a half- empty packet of heroin in blue cellophane. Richie takes the blue cellophane from the bag and, as the drawer closes entombing Sanders, holds it in his hand ... 
REPORTER V/O Heroin addiction is no longer exclusive to big city neighborhoods; it's epidemic - 
85   TIME CUT.    A TELEVISION:                                       85 The reports shows lawmakers on Capitol Hill juxtaposed against images of inner-cities, junkies, homicide victims and, perhaps most telling, white suburbia. 
REPORTER ON TV Since 1965, law enforcement has watched its steady increase and with it a rise in violent crime. Now unaccountably, it has exploded, reaching into cities as a whole - our suburbs and towns - our schools. 
INT. POLICE GYM - DAY 
The TV is in a small police gym where Richie lifts weights, very much aware of his pariah status as out-of-shape cops come in, only to leave again when they see him.

REPORTER ON TV Someone is finally saying: enough. Federal authorities have announced their intention to establish special narcotics bureaus in Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Newark and other major cities - 
Toback comes in, watches Richie, alone, working out. 
RICHIE V/O It's a dog and pony show. 
TOBACK V/O It's not being advertised as one. 
86   INT. POLICE GYM - LATER - DAY                                    86 
Richie's changing into his street clothes. 
RICHIE But it's federal. I'd have to answer to who? FBI? 
TOBACK Me and the U.S. Attorney. No one else. No FBI. Hoover knows better than to mix his men with dope. Too much temptation for the feeble-minded. 
Though he's not in much of a position to refuse the assignment, Richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea. Toback levels with him - TOBACK Richie, a detective who doesn't have the cooperation of his fellow detectives can't be effective. 
RICHIE You know why I don't have it. 
TOBACK Doesn't matter. 
RICHIE No, they're all on the take and I'm not and it doesn't matter to anyone. Instead of giving you a medal for turning in money, they bury you.

TOBACK It's fucked up. You're right. Maybe this's an opportunity away from all that. 
They regard each other.    Eventually - 
RICHIE I'll do it, but only like this: I don't set foot in a police station again. I work out of a place of my own. And I pick my own guys. Guys I know wouldn't take a nickel off the sidewalk. 
TOBACK Done.

Sidney says nothing.  She can barely look at him.  Tatum intervenes. 
TATUM You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school. 
STU Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it. 
BILLY Talk to me, Sid. 
Suddenly, a SCREAM erupts.  All eyes go to a GHOST MASKED STUDENT running down the hall, screaming wildly, running amuck. 
SIDNEY Why are they doing this? 
STU Are you kidding? This is like Christmas. 
Billy punches Stu in the side. 
STU Owwww... 
BILLY You open your mouth and stupidity pours out. 
STU Sorry. 
Sidney, clearly upset, takes off down the hall.  Billy races off after her. 
TATUM (yelling) Stay away from her, Billy. 
Tatum SLAMS her locker door shut as the bell RINGS. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER 
With first period underway, the halls have cleared.  One or two struggling students can be seen rushing to class. 
Sidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running smack into... 
BILLY 
They collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out of her.  She falls backwards, but Billy catches her fall. 
SIDNEY Jesus, SHIT! 
BILLY Hey, hey, it's just me. 
Sidney pulls away from him quickly.  Billy feels the slight. 
BILLY What? You don't still think it's me? 
Sidney catches her breath. 
SIDNEY No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me. 
BILLY The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid. 
SIDNEY I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house. 
BILLY See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember? 
SIDNEY I'm so sorry...please understand. 
BILLY Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me. 
SIDNEY You know that's not true. 
BILLY Then what is it? Is there somebody else? 
SIDNEY No... 
BILLY Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy? 
SIDNEY No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom. 
BILLY It's been a year since she died. 
SIDNEY (correcting him) Tomorrow. One year tomorrow. 
BILLY When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad--I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back. 
SIDNEY (sharply) Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere. 
BILLY You have to move on, Sid. 
Sidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry. 
SIDNEY I'm glad to know you're coping so well with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so perfect. Some of us are just trying to hold on. 
Sidney disappears through a door marked GIRL'S BATHROOM, leaving Billy alone in the hallway.  He SMACKS his forehead, pissed at himself. 
INT.  GIRL'S BATHROOM 
Large and spacious.  Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a row of sinks and a huge mirror.  Sidney enters as TWO GIRLS tinkle and talk--each from their respective stalls. 
GIRL #1 She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.

The music fades out. 
THE BLUE BANANA CLUB - MAIN ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Vivian and Kit are walking down the staircase. 
VIVIAN You took it while I was sleeping ? 
KIT You were unavailable for consultation. 
Kit walks to the bar, and makes Vivian follow her. 
KIT Hey, let's go. Snack ! Snack ! She has reached the bar and starts picking bits of food in plates on the counter. 
KIT Besides, it's my apartment. 
VIVIAN Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit. 
KIT Look, you came here. I gave you some money. I gave you a place to stay... 
Close Up on Kit's hands picking food (olives, onions, cherries...) in the snack plates, and putting them on a paper napkin. 
KIT ...and some valuable vocational advice. He was on my case. I had to give him something. 
Back to the two girls behind the bar. 
KIT So don't irritate me. 
POPS This ain't a buffet, Kit. 
Kit moves around Vivian, sits on a stool at the bar, and starts eating. 
VIVIAN Irritate you ? Irritate you ? I just saw a girl pulled out of a Dumpster. 
She sits down on another stool. 
KIT I know. Skinny Marie. But... she was a... a flake. She was a crack head. Dominic was trying to straighten her out for months. 
We hear people shouting in the background and glass being broken. The two girls turns their heads around for a second and then come back to their conversation at the bar. 
WOMAN (voice over) Leave her alone ! 
MAN (voice over) Leave her alone ! 
WOMAN (voice over) Come on, Blake ! 
VIVIAN Don't you want to get out of here ? 
KIT Get out of where ? Where the fuck you wanna go ? 
SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
A very quiet street. 
Close shot on a tramp looking though some junks left over on the sidewalk, in front of a house. 
THE TRAMP Aah, nothing but garbage. 
Full shot on the street, seen from the other side of the street. The Lotus Esprit stops at the tramp's level. 
EDWARD (voice over) Uh, excuse me. 
The tramp lifts his head. 
THE TRAMP Huh ? 
EDWARD (voice over) Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills ? 
THE TRAMP You're here ! 
Close Up shot on Edward's face behind the wheel on his car. 
THE TRAMP (voice over) That's Sylvester Stallone's house right there. 
He snickers. 
Back to the full shot of the street with the Lotus and the tramp behind it. EDWARD (voice over) Thank you. 
THE TRAMP You're welcome. 
The car moves away. 
HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium full shot on Vivian and Kit standing near a table on which a man is selling some souvenirs. Another prostitute is leaning on a tree. Kit walks toward the prostitute. 
KIT Hey, yo, Rachel. 
RACHEL What ? 
KIT Yeah. You see the stars on the sidewalk, babe ? She is mentioning the stars of the Walk of Fame, embedded in the sidewalk of the boulevard. 
RACHEL Yeah. 
KIT Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope, we work the Ritz Brothers, we work Fred Astaire, we work all the way down to Ella Fitzgerald. This is our turf. We got seniority. You better get off our corner. 
RACHEL Forgive me. I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's new. 
KIT Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson. 
RACHEL Williams. 
KIT Esther Williams ! Where you belong ! 
RACHEL Back off, Kit. You know, you're really becoming a grouch. 
She walks away on the boulevard. Kit turns toward Vivian. 
KIT Am I really a grouch ? 
VIVIAN Yes. Sometimes. 
KIT Well, just 'cause I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get something to eat. 
We hear someone whistling, and then : 
MAN (voice over) Hey, girls. 
Kit turns toward the boulevard, where the voice is coming from. 
KIT Hey, yo, baby ! 
Medium shot on an open convertible red car driving along the boulevard. In the car, three young men, two in the front, one in the back. The man sitting next to the driver, yells to the girls. 
MAN IN THE CAR How about a freebie ? It's my birthday. 
The car keeps on moving on the boulevard and out of view. Back on Vivian and Kit. 
KIT Dream on ! 
VIVIAN It's looking really slow tonight. 
She takes her cap off. 
KIT Yeah, well... maybe we should get a pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you. 
VIVIAN And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No. 
KIT You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much. 
VIVIAN Do you think I look like Carol Channing ? 
Kit puts her hands on Vivian's blonde wig. 
KIT No ! I love this look. It's very glamorous. Glamour choice. 
We hear brakes screeching. Kit turns around toward the noise. 
KIT Oh, yo, oh, yo. Catch this ! 
Full shot on the boulevard. The Lotus is driving along the boulevard. The car bounces a little, while the gears are grinding. 
Back to the two girls watching the car. Vivian points to it. 
VIVIAN Wait a minute. That's a Lotus Esprit. 
We see the car passing in front of the girls. Apparently, it has stopped a little further on the boulevard, because we hear its brakes screeching. 
Reverse angle shot showing the two girls with the stopped car behind them. 
KIT No, that's rent. You should go for him. You look hot tonight. Don't take less than a hundred. Call me when you're through. Take care of you.

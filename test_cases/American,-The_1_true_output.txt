134   INT. CAR- DAY                                              134 
CLARA is station hopping. 
She finds some LOU REED. She loves LOUD REED. 
JACK is concentrating on the road. 
CLARA Is it more far? 
JACK Ten kilometres. Another twenty minutes. 
She pauses to work out the mathematics. She's smart. And puzzled. But she's not frightened. Not yet. 
CLARA Twelve kilometres? In twenty minutes? 
JACK We're going off the beaten track. 
She looks confused. 
JACK Lontano. Fuori mano. 
CLARA laughs. 
CLARA You will speak Italian. One day, I will teach you. 
135   EXT. ALPINE TRACK- DAY                                     135 
JACK turns off the main road and onto an alpine track. 
This is the same route he took with the Belgian woman. 
The CAR bumps and tilts on the rough terrain. 
136   INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS                                       136 
CLARA is startled by such an insignificant track. 
CLARA Where are we going? 
Now she's anxious. This is not what she expected. 
JACK You shall see. 
CLARA I think it is good we should stay close to the road. 
JACK There's no need to worry. I've been here before several times. Taking photographs. 
He swings the wheel suddenly to avoid a large boulder and the Citroen pitches as if struck by a wave. 
CLARA clings to the door with her right hand, her left hand dug deep into the fabric of the seat to steady herself. 
JACK You're not afraid of coming into the wild with me, are you? 
CLARA No! 
She laughs tensely. 
CLARA Of course I am not. Not with you. But this... 
She snaps her fingers. 
CLARA ...sentiero! 
She waves her hand in the air. 
CLARA You should have a jeep. A Toyota. It is not good for a... berlina. 
It's as if the increased danger of the track diminishes her English. 
JACK This is a Citroen! 
He strikes the steering wheel hard with the palm of his hand. 
JACK This was made by the French for taking potatoes to market. Besides, I always come here in this car. 
CLARA You sure? 
JACK Of course. I don't want to walk back to town any more than you do. 
CLARA I think you are crazy. This will go to nowhere. 
JACK I assure you it does. 
She pouts her reply. The TRACK disappears into a WOOD and runs out altogether, giving way to grass. 
CLARA Now there is no road! 
JACK stops the car and turns the engines off. 
Sudden silence. 
CLARA lets go of the seat. 
CLARA Is this where we go? 
They are surrounded by trees. 
JACK No. Not quite. We go another hundred metres, through the wood. But from here we just roll forward. No motor. No sound. And you'll see a wonder. 
She grips the seat again. 
JACK You won't need to hold on. I'll go slowly. Just relax and look. 
He eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to move forward, the springs squeaking slightly. After 50 metres JACK twists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes. They roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods and come to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample WALNUT TREE. 
Beyond them is the LAKE, the MEADOWS and the RUINED HAMLET. The hidden valley is a riot of colour, the blooms and blossoms more brilliant than we've ever seen them. By the edge of the lake stands a HERON, still as fence post. 
CLARA gets out of the car, dumbstruck. JACK gets out too. He watches her... then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet through his miniature binoculars. Deserted. By the time CLARA turns towards him, the binoculars are hidden. 
CLARA No one comes here?

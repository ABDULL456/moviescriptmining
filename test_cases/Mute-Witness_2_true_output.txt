JANITOR Buka ? 
The janitor enters the incinerator room. He walks slowly around until he reaches the incinerator. The incinerator door is slightly open. He looks inside. 
Close shot of the inside of the incinerator. Among the flames, a human skull is burning. 
The janitor walks backward with a terrified look on his face. He trips on something and falls down. 
Close shot on the fallen flashlight rolling around. In the light, we see a pair of boots, belonging to a still unknown man, standing on the floor. 
Still lying on the floor, the janitor discovers his dog lying next to him, and starts patting it. The dog's fur is covered with blood. 
JANITOR Buka. 
Arkadi walks toward the janitor. 
JANITOR Buka. Buka. 
Arkadi raises something we don't clearly see (a knife ?) above his head and hit the janitor, still lying on the floor. 
A RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close up shot of a knife hitting a beefsteak. The directors's idea was, of course, to give us the impression that it was Arkadi's knife hitting the poor janitor ! 
Larger shot of the steak being cut into the plate. We hear some soft music. 
Karen and Andy are seated, side by side, at a table in a restaurant, with Billy sitting on the other side of the table. Andy, with his shirt still covered with fake blood, is eating with an evident good appetite. Billy doesn't seem to be very hungry. Andy gives his plate to Billy. 
ANDY Please, Billy, take some of mine. You'll feel better. 
Billy explain silently that she is not hungry. Andy takes his plate back. 
ANDY Okay. 
Andy pours a lot of ketchup on his steak. 
Billy says something in sign language. Karen looks at her, while Andy drinks his wine. Billy keeps on «talking». 
ANDY Could you pass me the salt, please ? 
Karen gives the salt to Andy. 
KAREN You could at least make the effort. Andy stops eating, looks at Billy drinking water and then at Karen. 
ANDY Listen... I'm sorry. All I can think about now is the movie, but as soon as we get back, I promise, I'll learn. 
He starts eating his steak again. 
KAREN How often have I heard that ? 
ANDY Come on. I can understand some of what she's saying. 
KAREN What ? 
Andy puts his fork and knife down. 
ANDY Okay, how about this ? 
Andy makes a sign. 
ANDY Means «makeup», right ? 
Billy smiles and nods her head «No». 
KAREN Wrong. It means somebody's look, the expression on their face. 
ANDY That was close. 
KAREN What Billy said she'll never forget the look on the girl's face tonight from the moment she knew she was gonna die. She said the pain and the terror was real. You can't act that. 
Billy looks at Andy and Karen with a worried face. Andy seems suddenly a bit worried too.

Rachel looks furious. Adam backtracks. 
ADAM (CONT'D) (REASONING) They're a lot of work. (MORE) 
ADAM (CONT'D) I can barely take care of myself, I don't think I can handle another living, breathing, needy, thing in my life. 
RACHEL I didn't realize it would be such a big deal. (PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE) I can bring him back to the shelter in the morning. 
ADAM I know what you're doing. 
RACHEL No, you're right, it's not a good idea. Tomorrow I'll take him back where he'll be kept in a tiny cage with 10 other dogs who will bully him, and rape him, and then he'll eventually be euthanized. 
The dog looks at Adam. It's hopeless, there's no way Adam's going to win this one. 
ADAM Alright. Fine, we can keep the dog. 
RACHEL Really? 
ADAM Really. 
Rachel's face lights up. She hugs Adam. 
RACHEL This is going to be so good for you. 
Adam turns to see the dog shitting on the carpet. 
EXT. SAN DIEGO - EVENING 
The sun sets over the San Diego skyline. 
INT. SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - NIGHT 
It's Adam's going away party. Draped across the entrance is a "Bon Voyage" banner with an image of a Cruise Ship. 
Adam, Rachel and Seth enter to find a crowd of mostly unfamiliar faces. Phil, who has had one too many vodka tonics, approaches Adam - drink in hand. 
PHIL (ANNOUNCES) There he is, the man of the hour. 
ADAM Here I am. 
Phil takes a sip from his glass, and then offers it to Adam. 
PHIL Martini? 
ADAM No thanks. 
Phil puts his arm around Adam and gestures wildly - causing his drink to splash on Adam. 
PHIL So cancer? 
ADAM Yup. The Big C. 
PHIL Man! 
Phil tugs on Adam's hair. 
PHIL (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Are you wearing a wig? 
ADAM Nope, this is my real hair. 
PHIL (SENTIMENTAL) I'm gonna miss you so much buddy. 
ADAM (UNCOMFORTABLE) I'm going to miss you too. 
Phil puts his head on Adam's shoulder. 
ADAM (CONT'D) Excuse me for a moment, I think I see someone over there from a previous life. 
CUT TO: 
Adam is talking with his co-worker JOE. 
JOE Have you started chemo yet? 
ADAM No, not yet. 
JOE Don't do it man. It'll fuck you up. That's like some Nagasaki shit. 
CUT TO: 
Adam stands with SUSAN. 
SUSAN You want to know the secret? 
ADAM Ah, okay.

{"train": "A SCANNER DARKLY \nWritten by \nCharlie Kaufman \nAdapted from the novel by \nPhilip K. Dick \nFirst Draft \nDecember 20, 1997 \nSHOT OF NOTEBOOK PAGE DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT \nPOV of someone skimming a hand-written entry. The corresponding voice-over is offhand, dispassionate. In the background, children can be heard laughing and playing. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Lately, Jerry Fabin stands all day shaking bugs from his hair. The doctor says there are no bugs in his hair. \nThe sound of fingers scratching scalp begins and grows louder through the following montage. \nEXT. COCA-COLA BOTTLING PLANT - PRE-DAWN \nSUBTITLE: ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, IN THE YEAR 1994 \nA massive, unlit Coca-Cola sign is eerily silhouetted against the early morning sky. Antiquated delivery trucks set out from loading docks, as red futuristic cargo planes, emblazoned with the Coca-Cola logo, take off from the roof. \nEXT. FREEWAY - PRE-DAWN \nBirds-eye view of Coca-Cola trucks spreading out through the city. Coke planes shoot by close to the camera. \nEXT. 7-11 - DAWN \nA Coke truck pulls into the parking lot. \nEXT. SUPERMARKET - DAWN \nA Coke plane lands gracefully on the roof of the supermarket. \nEXT. MCDONALD'S - DAWN \nUniformed delivery men enter, hauling cases of Coke syrup. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN \nA Coca-Cola truck rumbles slowly past a row of low-income, plastic pre-fab houses. We hold on one house whose front lawn is strewn with furniture and cleaning products. \nINT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - DAWN \nThe windows are spray-painted over with silver paint. A single pole lamp with bare, harsh spot-lights illuminates the room, which is emptied of furniture, covered in a sickly green shag carpet, and littered with fast-food wrappers. In \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nthe center of the room stands Jerry Fabin, thirty, with wild- eyes and a long, tangled mass of hair. He is naked, draped over a metal garbage can, and vigorously scratching his head. This process continues for an uncomfortably long time. A Golden Retriever sleeps in the corner. \nINT. JERRY FABIN'S BATHROOM - LATER \nJerry Fabin stands under a hot shower. Steam fills the stall. He scrubs his hair violently with tensed fingers. \nINT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nWe hear the shower. Steam pours out the open bathroom door. \nEXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - MID-DAY \nThe sun is high; the day is bright and hazy.   A few hippies stroll by or sit on front steps, discreetly smoking joints. We hear the distant sound of Jerry's shower. \nINT. JERRY FABIN'S BATHROOM - LATER \nJerry is still in the shower, scrubbing away. He finally turns it off and steps out, a drowned rat. He dries himself, wipes the mirror and squints nervously at his reflection. Tiny bugs hop around on his head. He screams. \nINT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nJerry lies on the cruddy shag carpet, open volumes of the Encyclopedia Brittanica spread around him. He scratches himself as he studies one of the volumes. Insects hop up and down all over his body, and on the rug. When he exhales, a cloud of bugs pours from his mouth; he shoos them away. \nEXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - DAY \nJerry heads up the walkway carrying a shopping bag. Several cans of Raid and other bug sprays poke out of the bag. Bugs hop around on Jerry. He puts the bag down on the stoop to scratch himself. He notices tiny bugs chewing the shrubs. \nINT. NURSERY - DAY \nJerry consults with a man behind the cash register. \nNURSERY CLERK Eating the bushes?   Could be aphids. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJERRY FABIN Aphids! Of course. Y'know, I started with \"A\" in my cyclopedia, yet somehow I must've skipped right over aphids. It does start with \"A\", right? Aphids? \nNURSERY CLERK Yes.   Yes, it does, sir. \nJERRY FABIN Yeah they bite! They're aphids! \nCHARLES FRECK Can I wash them off and wait for you? \nJerry ignores Freck. He scrubs himself intently, ritualistically, totally absorbed in his task. \nINT. LION'S CLUB HALL - DAY \nWe hear pronounced, rhythmic breathing, as we scan the hall, which is filled with middle-aged businessmen wearing an array of brightly colored suits. They are well-fed and dull- looking. At the podium is another bussinessman, this one fat in a pink suit and yellow tie. He addresses the assemblage. \nFAT BUSINESSMAN Gentlemen, we have a wonderful opportunity this afternoon. The county of Orange has provided us with the chance to hear from -- and put questions to -- an undercover narcotics agent from the Sheriff's Office. \nThe fat businessman gestures with a sweep of his arm toward the camera. \nThe heavy breathing stops as we angle on what the fat businessman is gesturing toward: a generic blur of a human being sitting on stage. The blur is clearly human, but it's impossible to settle on its facial features. It's as if the features keep changing. \nFAT BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) Now you will notice that you can barely see this individual becuase he is wearing what is called a \"scramble suit\", which he wears during most of his daily activities of law enforcement. Due to potential corruption within the Sheriff's Department, even this gallant officer's co-workers and superiors must not know his \"street\" identity. \nHeavy breathing. Again we're inside the suit. Now we see, in shadowy profile, the face of the man in the suit. This is Bob Arctor, early thirties, homely, and looking like a druggie. He scans the audience disdainfully. \nBOB ARCTOR (under breath) Nitwits. Pathetic, soulless morons. \nWe cut to the outside of the suit -- still expressionless. \nFAT BUSINESSMAN This man -- whom we will call Fred, because that is the code name under which he reports the information he (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFAT BUSINESSMAN (cont'd) gathers -- cannot be identified by voice or by appearance. He looks, does he not, like a vague blur. This is because his scramble suit projects thousands of different human faces onto your retinas, thus turning Fred into a veritable Everyman. All things to all people translates into nothing to anyone, does it not? \nThe fat businessman smiles a big, toothy smile.   The audience of straights smiles back, almost in unison. \nFAT BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) So let's hear it for our vague blur! \nThe audience erupts into enthusiastic applause. Fred rises and replaces the fat businessman behind the podium. When he speaks it is an emotionless computer voice. \nFRED If you saw me on the street, you'd say, \"There goes a weirdo freak doper.\" And you'd feel aversion and walk away. \nThe audience is silent, blank, their blankness a reflection of the blankness of Fred's scramble suit. \nFRED (CONT'D) I don't look like you. I can't afford to. My life depends on it. \nDramatic pause. \nFRED (CONT'D) I am not going to tell you first what I'm attempting to do as an undercover officer. I'm going to tell you... (beat) ... what I am afraid of. \nNow the audience is hooked, their eyes wide. \nWe move inside the suit and watch Bob Arctor watching the audience, timing the pause for best effect. We hear the breathing again, and when Arctor speaks, it is in his normal voice, bored, delivering a memorized speech. \nBOB ARCTOR What I fear, is that our children, your children and my children... (pause) (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR (cont'd) ... I have two. Little ones. \nQUICK SHOT OF FAMILY PHOTO OF ARCTOR, HIS WIFE, AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS \nThe Arctor in the photo is different, conservative, in a colorful suit like the audience members. His wife and kids are smiling and suburban-looking. Their features indistinct, generic, impossible to recall. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) But not too little to be addicted... \nINT. LION'S CLUB HALL - CONTINUOUS \nArctor is speaking from inside the suit. \nBOB ARCTOR ... calculatedly addicted, for profit, by those who would destroy this society. We do not yet know who these animals are who pray on our young, but one day we will. \nVOICE FROM CROWD Sock it to 'em! \nThe audience concurs.   Bob Arctor sighs disdainfully. \nOutside the suit, the sigh is heard as a computer-like exhalation, uninterpretable, lost on the audience. \nFRED We believe there is one source for Substance D and a diversified distribution system making it accessible in all major drug using areas. It my job as an undercover officer to attain the confidence of low level dealers and work my way up through the network to arrive at the drug's source. Now, the profits for... \nFred becomes silent, stands there.   The audience waits. \nInside the suit, Arctor sweats, can't remember his line. He looks, panicked, out at the sea of eyes and finally wings it. \nBOB ARCTOR Well, it isn't the profits anyhow. It's something else... what you see ... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nArctor scans the hard audience. He tries a new tack. \nBOB ARCTOR (CONT'D) If you were a diabetic, and you didn't have the money for insulin, would you steal to get the money? Or just die? \nA tinny voice speaks to Arctor through his headphone. \nHEADPHONE VOICE I think you'd better go back to the prepared text, Fred. \nBOB ARCTOR (quietly into throat mike) I forgot it. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE No. (pulls out a little pocket knife, points it at Freck) Get lost. \nHe widens the distance between them to avoid getting stuck. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCHARLES FRECK Sure you are. I met you at his place. \nDonna turns and walks directly toward Freck, her little knife pointing at his stomach. He jumps out of the way. \nCHARLES FRECK Jeez.   I just... \nDonna keeps walking. Freck shrugs and slouches dejectedly away. He turns and gives one last glance over his shoulder. Donna has stopped amid the bustling foot traffic. She is squinting at him. Freck cautiously approaches her. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) One night me and Bob and another chick had some old Simon and Garfunkel tapes. You were filling caps with high-grade Death, then you laid one on each of us. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I thought you were going to knock me down and bang me. \nCHARLES FRECK No. I just wondered if you, like, wanted a ride or... Bang you on the sidewalk? In broad daylight? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I thought you might pull me into a doorway or something. \nCHARLES FRECK I know you. Besides Arctor would snuff me if I did that. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Well, I didn't recognize you.    I'm sort of nearsighted. \nDonna moves a few steps closer to Freck and squints at him. \nCHARLES FRECK You want a ride where you're going? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE You'll bang me in the car. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCHARLES FRECK Nah. Besides I can't get it up these days. Must be something they're adulterating all the stuff with. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE That's a neat-o line, but I've heard it before. Everybody bangs me. At least they try to. That's what it's like to be a chick. \nCHARLES FRECK That really sucks. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I'm suing one guy right now for molestation and assault. We're asking punitive damages in excess of forty thousand. \nCHARLES FRECK How far he get? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE A hand around my boob. \nCHARLES FRECK That's not worth forty thousand. \nINT. CHARLES FRECK'S CAR - DAY \nFreck drives Donna home. \nCHARLES FRECK Listen, you got anything to sell?    I'm really hurting. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I can get it. \nCHARLES FRECK Tabs, though. I don't shoot up. Needles are a bummer to me. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Sixty dollars a hundred. \nCHARLES FRECK Jeez, man, that's a burn. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDONNA HAWTHORNE They're super good. Take my word. \nCHARLES FRECK All right.     A hundred, then. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Cool.     How do I get in touch? \nCHARLES FRECK Charles B. Freck -- \nDonna pulls a little pad and a pencil from her purse and writes down Freck's name. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE V. Freck? CHARLES FRECK Charles Freck. She corrects the name. Freck notices that her writing is a slow and childish scrawl. It makes him sad. Then he steals a glance at her breasts as she writes. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) \nShe writes down the phone number. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I think I remember you now. \nCHARLES FRECK Hey, you want to go with me to see Jerry Fabin? I'm hauling some of his stuff over to the Number Three Federal Clinic where they took him last night. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I better not. Jerry thinks I contaminated him originally with those bugs. \nCHARLES FRECK They're aphids. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Yeah, well, then he didn't know what they were. \nEXT. ANAHEIM STREET - DAY \nJIM BARRIS (CONT'D) The terminal step I keep to myself, but it involves an intricate methodological process of filtering. \nCHARLES FRECK Even if you do get a gram of coke out of thisl, I can't use it to get into Donna's pants. That's like buying her. \nJIM BARRIS You give her a gift she gives you one. The most precious gift a woman has. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCHARLES FRECK You're talking about Bob Arctor's girl, Barris. He's my friend and the guy you and Luckman live with. \nJIM BARRIS There's a great deal about Bob Arctor you're not aware of. Your view is simplistic and naive, and you believe about him what he wants you to. \nCHARLES FRECK (defensively) I do not. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nFrank, in a scramble suit, talks to Hank, also in a scramble suit and studying a clipboard. \nHANK That covers Barris and Freck. Let's see, I guess we can write Jerry Fabin off. \nFRED I read his EEG analysis.    Fabin's over. \nHANK Good riddance. Any luck locating our missing pusher friend Spade Weeks? \nFRED New-Path wouldn't tell me shit. They're very protective of their own. \nHANK Junkies, ex-junkies. It's a club. (flipping through notes) What about Donna Hawthorne? \nFRED I keep pumping her for more and more Death. Pretty soon she'll have to refer me up to her source. \nHANK Fine.   And what's Arctor up to? \nWe go inside Fred's suit and see the shadowy face of Arctor. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR Bob Arctor? He's not doing anything much. Working at his nowhere Blue Chip Stamp job, dropping a few tabs of meth cut with Death during the day. \nHANK That's not what I hear. \nArctor studies the vague blankness of Hank. \nBOB ARCTOR What do you mean? \nHANK We have a tip that Arctor has funds above and beyond what he makes at the stamp redemption center. \nWe move outside the suit and see Fred. \nFRED No shit, Hank. Is that true? \nHANK And according to this information, Arctor comes and goes mysteriously. Have you observed any of this? \nFRED Most likely he's with his chick, Donna. \nHANK Most likely?    You're supposed to know. \nFRED Yeah, it's Donna. He's over there banging her day and night. But I'll let you know. So, who's the informant? \nHANK Hell, we don't know. No voice print. He used one of those rinky-dink grids. \nFRED Christ, it's that burned-out acid head Barris doing a schizy grudge job on Arctor's head. I wouldn't give him the time of day as an informant. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHANK We don't know it's Barris. Anyway, there may be more to Barris than meets the eye. We're looking into him. Nothing I feel would be of use to you, at least so far. \nFRED Well, it's one of Arctor's friends. \nHANK Yeah. Undoubtedly a vengeance burn trip. But we need to know why Arctor's making these kind of enemies. \nFRED Hank, I don't see this as an avenue of \nHANK So I'm taking you off Spade and, for the time being, I'm assigning you primarily to observe Bob Arctor. \nFRED (strangled robot noise) You're assigning me to watch Arctor? \nWe move inside Fred's suit and watch an uncomfortable, sweaty Arctor watching Hank. \nHANK Covertly funded, covertly engaged, Fred. It's worth checking into. \nBOB ARCTOR Fine. So I assume this means you'll be bugging Arctor's house and car? \nHANK With the new holographic scanner system. This way you can study Arctor's every move on the tapes, and report back to us in detail. \nHank, the vague blur, looks up at Fred.   Fred, the vague blur, returns his look. \nFRED Sounds good, then. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHANK Good. You'll need to get Arctor and the boys away from the house so we can install the equipment. \nDAN (O.S.) Open the fucking door! \nKIMBERLY (small voice) No.   I'm with someone. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDAN (O.S.) Fine!   I'll slash your tires! \nSound of running downstairs. Kimberly rises, and she and Arctor watch out the window as Dan, a skinny, short-haired effeminate-looking guy, appears in the parking lot, crazily waving a knife in the air. \nDAN (screaming up at Kimberly) I'll slash your tires, your fucking tires! And then I'll kill you! \nDan begins slashing tires on Kimberly's old Dodge. This seems to wake Kimberly up. She shrieks, runs to the door and frantically begins unlocking it. \nKIMBERLY I got to stop him! I don't have insurance! \nArctor grabs her, tries to hold her back. \nBOB ARCTOR Tires aren't... \nKIMBERLY (struggling to get free) My tires! \nBOB ARCTOR That's what he wants you to do. \nKIMBERLY Downstairs.   They have a phone!   Let me go! \nKimberly fights loose of Arctor with manic energy. \nKIMBERLY (CONT'D) (unlocking the door) I'm calling the police. My tires! (out the door) One of them is new! \nINT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nKimberly is scrambling down the stairs. She arrives at an apartment door and pounds on it. Arctor is right behind her. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nKIMBERLY Open, please? Please? I need to call the police. Please let me call them. \nThe door opens. An old man in tie and sweater stands there. Kimberly hurries past him, goes for the phone, and dials. \nBOB ARCTOR (to old man) Thank you. \nINT. OLD PEOPLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nArctor enters, closes the door and watches out the peephole. \nKIMBERLY (on phone, crazily) Hi, yeah, my boyfriend and me got into a fight because of these cowboy boots which were worth seven dollars. See, I said, they're mine, and he says, no, they're mine 'cause you gave them to me as a present. And I say but I bought them. Which makes them mine. Right? So he grabs 'em and I grab 'em, and I rip the backs of them with this can opener and... yes, I'll hold. \nArctor glances at the old man, who's been quietly studying him. An old woman in a print dress stands in the dining room doorway. Kimberly paces on hold, chews a fingernail. \nARCTOR (to old man) This must be bad on you. \nOLD MAN It goes on all the time, them fighting, him saying he'll kill her. \nOLD WOMAN We should have gone back to Denver.   I told you that. \nOLD MAN These terrible fights. On and on. Smashing things and screaming. And what's worse, every time -- \nOLD WOMAN Yes, tell him about that. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nOLD MAN Every time we go out, shopping or to mail a letter, we step in... what dogs leave. \nOLD WOMAN (whispering) Dog doo. \nINT. ARCTOR'S CAR - DAY \nArctor drives on the freeway, deep in thought. Luckman's next to him. Barris is in back grinning in his dark shades. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Dog shit. All that misery and that's what really upset them. \nArctor chuckles.   The car is behind a crawling Safeway truck. \nERNIE LUCKMAN You ought to pass that truck, man. The humper's hardly moving. \nArctor comes back into focus, picks up speed, passes the truck on the left. As he eases up on the gas, the pedal falls to the floor. The car shoots forward at great speed. \nLUCKMAN AND BARRIS Slow down! \nArctor is panicked. The speedometer is registering eighty- five, ninety, one hundred. Arctor reaches down, tries to fiddle with the gas peddle. The car is rocketing right for a VW van chugging along. Barris and Luckman throw up their hands. Arctor swerves to the left of the van at the last minute. They pass it, but a fast moving Corvette had been about to pass in that lane. It honks, its brakes screech. \nLUCKMAN AND BARRIS (CONT'D) (top of their lungs) What the fuck?! What are you doing?! \nLuckman grabs at the ignition key, and turns it off. Arctor shifts into neutral, the car begins to slow, and he maneuvers it onto the shoulder. The Corvette shoots by, lays on it's horn, continues to do so until it's long gone down the freeway. The three guys just sit in the car, hearts pounding. The VW van passes and honks its VW horn. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJIM BARRIS What the hell happened, Bob? \nThey all look down at the still-depressed gas pedal.     The Safeway truck passes and sounds its own basso horn. \nBOB ARCTOR You goddamn Barris! I know you did it, screwed over the cephscope and now my car! You kinky freak mother bastard! \nThe smell of dog shit is becoming overwhelming again. Arctor tries not to vomit. His head swims. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Take it easy, Bob. \nBOB ARCTOR I know it's him, man. I know. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nERNIE LUCKMAN That doesn't make any sense.      He'd have snuffed himself too. \nBarris nods in agreement. He smiles again. Now there's dog shit coating Barris's teeth. Arctor throws up on the dashboard, rests his head in his hands \nERNIE LUCKMAN What was in those tabs you gave us? \nJIM BARRIS Hell, I took some too. And so did you. Didn't give us a bad trip. Besides it was so soon. Your stomach can't even absorb -- \nArctor's head jerks up to face Barris. \nBOB ARCTOR YOU FUCKING POISONED ME! \nBarris and Luckman look at Arctor. \nEXT. ARCTOR'S CAR - AFTERNOON \nA tow truck is parked in front of the car. The three guys are inside, Arctor at the wheel, Barris and Luckman in back. A mechanic closes up the hood. \nINT. ARCTOR'S CAR - AFTERNOON \nThe three drive along in silence.      Arctor is pale, but seems back in control. \nERNIE LUCKMAN I wonder what's been going on back at the house. \nArctor glances at Luckman in the rearview mirror. \nERNIE LUCKMAN (CONT'D) You know, this proves, Bob, that somebody is out to burn you real bad. I just hope the house is still there when we get back. \nBOB ARCTOR Yeah, I hope. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJIM BARRIS Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about that, gents. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Christ, Barris, they may have ripped off everything we got, or stomped all our animals, or -- \nJIM BARRIS But I left a little surprise for anyone entering the house. An electronic surprise, if you will. \nArctor shifts his glance in the rearview mirror to Barris. \nBOB ARCTOR What kind of surprise? It's my house, Jim, you can't start rigging up -- \nJIM BARRIS Easy.   Be cool. \nBOB ARCTOR Well, what is it? \nJIM BARRIS If the front door is opened, my tape recorder starts recording. \nBOB ARCTOR You should've told me. \nERNIE LUCKMAN What if they come in the window or through the back door? \nJIM BARRIS To increase the chance of them making their entry via the front door, I providentially left it unlocked. \nThey drive in silence. \nBOB ARCTOR Well, they're not going to expect it to be unlocked, so they'll go in the window. \nJIM BARRIS But I put a note on the front door. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR You're jiving me. \nJIM BARRIS Yes. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Are you fucking jiving us or not?   I can't tell with you, man. Is he jiving us or not, Bob? \nBOB ARCTOR We'll see when we get back. If there's a note on the door and it's unlocked, we'll know he's not jiving us. \nMore silence. \nERNIE LUCKMAN But they'd probably take the note down and lock the door after vandalizing and robbing us. So we'll never know. It's that gray area again. Damn it! \nJIM BARRIS Of course I'm kidding, guys! Only a psychotic would leave the front door open with a note on it. \nSilence. \nBOB ARCTOR So what did you write on the note, Jim? \nJIM BARRIS I wrote: \"Donna, come on in, the door's unlocked. We...\" The note's to Donna. \nJIM BARRIS I've got an acquaintance in the field. \nBarris and Luckman look at Arctor. \nERNIE LUCKMAN We should probably act fast, man. \nJIM BARRIS We don't know how fast they're gonna swoop down on us. \nArctor studies Barris and Luckman, their anxious eyes bore into him. He sways, gets confused, begins to buy Barris's scenario. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR What reason should we give for selling? \nERNIE LUCKMAN Yeah, we can't tell the truth. We need a shuck. Barris, what's a good shuck? \nBOB ARCTOR We'll just flat out say there's narcotics planted all over the place and since we don't know where, we decided to move out and let the new owner get busted instead of us. \nJIM BARRIS No. I don't think we can afford to be that up front. Bob, you say you got a job transfer. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Where to, though? Where the fuck to? \nJIM BARRIS Cleveland. \nBOB ARCTOR I say we tell them the truth. In fact, we can put an ad in the Times: \"Modern, three bedroom tract house, two bathrooms for easy flushing, with high grade dope stashed in all rooms.\" It's a selling point. \nERNIE LUCKMAN But they'd be calling asking what kind of dope, and we don't know. Man! \nJIM BARRIS Or how much. Prospective buyers might inquire about the quantity. \nBOB ARCTOR (slumps back on the couch) They appear to have us. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Christ, this is awful! \nDonna appears from one of the bedrooms, rumpled and sleepy. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Hey, I came in, like the note said.   I waited for you for awhile, then I crashed. Why are you guys yelling? \nThe three guys look at each other. \nBOB ARCTOR Did you smoke a joint? Before you crashed? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Of course. Otherwise I can't sleep. You shouldn't leave your place unlocked like that. You could get ripped off and it would be your own fault. That's the main reason I came in when I saw the note. Somebody ought to be here if the place is unlocked with a note on it. \nBOB ARCTOR How long have you been here? \nERNIE LUCKMAN Well, you could've taken down the note, locked the door, and left. \nDonna looks at Luckman, trying to figure out what he just said, then back to Arctor. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Approximately thirty-eight minutes. Hey, Bob, I got that wolf book, if you want to see it. It's got a lot of heavy shit in it. \nBarris falls back into a ratty easy chair. \nJIM BARRIS Life is only heavy and none else; heavy that leads to the grave. For everyone and everything. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Did you say you were selling the house? Or was that me dreaming? \nBOB ARCTOR Shit, I hope it was you dreaming. \nINT. HANK'S OFFICE - MORNING \nScramble-suited Hank is unrolling a floor plan labeled \"Arctor's House\" in front of scramble-suited Fred. \nHANK Here are the locations of the eight scanners. We transmit to a safe house down the block from Arctor's. \nFRED That's where I do playback? \nHANK Yeah. And we use also use it for playback on five other houses. So you'll be bumping into other undercover people. Always wear your scramble suit. \nFRED Fine. \nHANK Make note of the scanner locations. If they need servicing, you can take care of it while you're at Arctor's. As long as nobody's around. \nFRED I'll have to edit myself out, so you won't see who's fixing the scanners. \nHANK Right. Although we assume you're Barris, or Luckman, or Freck, or Arctor or Donna Hawthorne -- \nFRED (computerized chuckle) Donna? \nHANK So don't edit yourself from all tapes, or we'll deduce who you are by process of elimination. Leave yourself in in places. Be creative. Have fun. \nFRED Okay. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHANK This will help greatly in determining what the hell Arctor's up to. \nFRED We don't know he's up to anything. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 A soda pop bottle is correct. \nMedical Technician #1 puts down the card and makes a note on his clipboard. He holds up another card. \nFRED Is this about the Lion's Club speech? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Are you getting cross-chatter, Fred? \nFRED Getting what? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Between the hemispheres. Cross- chatter. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 If there's damage to the left hemisphere, where the linguistic skills are normally located, then sometimes the right hemisphere will fill in. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 To the best of its limited abilities. \nFRED I don't think I'm getting that. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Thoughts not your own, perhaps? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 As if another person were thinking? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Foreign words you don't understand? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 You'll keep your eyes open for anything like this, won't you? \nFRED Okay. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Good.     Now what do you see here? \nFRED A sheep. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Show us the sheep, Fred. \nFred points. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 An impairment in set-background discrimination gets you into a heap of trouble -- instead of no forms, you actually perceive faulty forms. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Forms that aren't there. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Like dog shit, for example. \nFRED I'm sorry, what did you say? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 I'm sorry, Fred, what? \nFRED Nothing. I'm guessing it's not a sheep. But was I close at least? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 This isn't a Rorshach, Fred. There is only one right answer. In this case it's a dog. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFRED It's what?    What did you say it is? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 It's a dog. \nFRED Oh.   How can you tell? \nThe technician turns over the card, showing the isolated outline of a greyhound on the other side. \nFRED (CONT'D) Okay. I see it now. What does it mean that I saw a sheep? Does it mean that I'm crazy? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Crazy isn't a psychiatric diagnosis, Fred. \nINT. CHARLES FRECK'S CAR - DAY \nFreck drives along in great spirits. He giggles and plots. \nCHARLES FRECK Okay okay okay. So I go to Barris, \"Hey, Barris, I bought a methedrine plant today,\" and he goes... (childish Barris impersonation) \"Methedrine is a benny, like speed, la la la. It's made synthetically in a lab la la la. It isn't organic like pot. There's no such thing as a methedrine plant, like there is a pot plant.\" Then I go... (big punchline) \"I meant I inherited forty thousand dollars from an uncle and purchased a plant in this guy's garage where he makes meth. It's a factory. Plant in that sense... ' Okay okay, I don't have the phrasing exactly yet, but when I lay this on Barris, man, I'm going to get him so good. \nEXT. BOB ARCTOR'S HOUSE - DAY \nArctor and Barris, in greasy clothes, are in the driveway working on Arctor's car. Freck pulls up, gets out of his car and approaches. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCHARLES FRECK Hey, Jim, I bought a meth plant today. \nJIM BARRIS How big? \nCHARLES FRECK What do you mean? \nJIM BARRIS How big a plant? \nCHARLES FRECK (confused as to how to proceed) Um, well... like, what do you mean? \nBOB ARCTOR How much you pay, Freck? \nCHARLES FRECK Uh, about ten bucks. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Teilhard de Chardin. \"... that man indeed lives in a zone where no multiplicity can distress him and which is nevertheless the most active workshop of universal fulfillment.\" (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLuckman closes the book. He has backed Barris against the wall of the house. Freck tries to get in between them. \nCHARLES FRECK Cool it, you guys. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Out of the way, Freck. I'm going to coldcock Barris into tomorrow for talking to his betters like that. \nLuckman brings back his arm to punch Barris.    Barris bleats in terror and runs crazily for the house. \nJIM BARRIS I hear the phone ringing about the carb. I'll get it. \nThey watch him go. \nERNIE LUCKMAN I was just kidding. \nCHARLES FRECK What if he comes back with his gun and silencer? \nArctor and Luckman look dismissively at Freck, and go back under the hood of the car. Freck stands nervously by his car, shifting from foot to foot, ready for a quick getaway. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Look, I'm splitting. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Naw, stay, man, you're a brother. \nCHARLES FRECK Naw, I'm cutting out. \nBarris emerges tentatively from the house, carrying a hammer. \nJIM BARRIS It was a wrong number, man. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Hey, what's the hammer for, Jimmy-Boy? \nBOB ARCTOR To fix the engine. What else? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJIM BARRIS Thought I would bring it with me, since I was indoors and noticed it. \nFreck watches this exchange.    He anxiously climbs in his car. \nCHARLES FRECK I'm gonna split. I'll see you guys. \nBOB ARCTOR The most dangerous kind of person is one who's afraid of his own shadow. \nFreck's eyes widen at this statement.    He drives off. \nINT. FRECK'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nFreck drives along, sweating. \nCHARLES FRECK Did Bob mean me afraid of my own shadow? But that was turning into a super-bummer. Where's the chicken into not wanting to be around that? Everything's changing, man. Used to be cool to hang out. Now its totally dark. \nFrank slips in his 8-track of Janis Joplin singing \"All is Loneliness.\" He cries as he drives. \nEXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe furniture has been removed from the lawn. Freck pulls into the driveway and heads to the house. He knocks on the door, waits, sniffling. He knocks again. \nCHARLES FRECK Jerry! Jerry! Let me in, man, I'm truly bummed! I wanna talk! \nA couple of hippies on the stoop next door watch Freck. \nHEAD #1 Hey, Jerry's gone. \nFreck looks over blankly at the hippy.    Then it registers. \nCHARLES FRECK Fuck! I can't believe I forgot Jerry's dead. What is wrong with me? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHEAD #1 He's not dead, man. He's in the Number Three Federal Clinic. \nFreck lets this register.   He starts to cry again. \nCHARLES FRECK Fuck, I can't believe I forgot Jerry's not dead. What is wrong with me? \nFreck hurries to his car, speeds down the street. \nINT. ARCTOR'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nArctor, Luckman, and Barris lounge around, stoned.     Arctor seems relaxed, reclining on the couch and glancing discreetly at the hidden holo-scanner. \nERNIE LUCKMAN You seem mellow, Bob. Having to spend a hundred bucks on a new carb wouldn't make me mellow. \nBOB ARCTOR I'll cruise the streets until I come across an Olds, then unbolt the carb. Like everyone else I know. \nJIM BARRIS Especially Donna. That chick steals everything she can carry. \nERNIE LUCKMAN I'll tell you a Donna story. One day she put a quarter in a stamp machine and it kept spitting out stamps, till she had like eighteen thousand stamps. \nJIM BARRIS At what individual price per stamp? \nJIM BARRIS The address, the address.      let's see... \nFRED Christ!    Just -- \nLuckman heaves violently on the floor. He thrashes around, throws up the material in his throat, and opens his eyes. \nJIM BARRIS Uh, thank you. No assistance is needed after all. Good morrow. \nBarris hangs up. \nJIM BARRIS (CONT'D) You okay, Ernst? \nERNIE LUCKMAN I must've gagged. Did I pass out? \nJIM BARRIS Not exactly. You did go into an altered state of consciousness for a few seconds. Probably an alpha state. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Fuck. I shit myself. \nLuckman stands, unsteadily. Fred relaxes, sits back down at his console. Luckman splashes himself with tap water. \nERNIE LUCKMAN (CONT'D) What were you doing while I was lying there, jacking off? \nJIM BARRIS You saw me on the phone, summoning the paramedics. I moved into action immedi -- \nERNIE LUCKMAN Balls. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nArctor walks home, deep in thought. A MG speeds by, makes a screeching u-turn, pulls up beside Arctor, honks it's horn. Arctor squints inside. It's Donna. He opens the passenger door, gets in. \nINT. DONNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Did I scare you? Heh heh. \nBOB ARCTOR I just did a freaky number, not like a fantasy trip, but... So I'm kinda -- \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I have your stuff. \nBOB ARCTOR My stuff? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Your Death. \nDonna screeches off too fast, weaves, tailgates a Coke truck. \nBOB ARCTOR Fucking Barris. You know how he kills you? He doesn't. He waits until a situation arises where you die, and he just sits there. In fact he sets you up to die. I don't know how exactl -- \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Do you have the money? \nBOB ARCTOR What? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I need the money right now. \nBOB ARCTOR Sure.   Yeah. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I don't like Barris, and I don't trust him. He's crazy. And you're crazy when you're around him. You're crazy right now. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR I am? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Yeah. \nBOB ARCTOR Donna, I know I can count on you to tell me if I'm getting weird or crazy or like that. Okay? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Hey, you wanna take me to a concert at Anaheim Stadium next weekend? \nBOB ARCTOR Right on.     Yeah. That sounds -- \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I'm gonna bring some really oily hash and get really loaded. But you have to wear something neat, not those funky clothes you sometimes wear. \nBOB ARCTOR I'll wear whatever you say. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I'm taking us to my place. And you do have the money and you'll give it to me. Then we'll drop a few of the tabs and kick back. Maybe you could buy a fifth of Southern Comfort and we could get bombed as well. \nBOB ARCTOR Oh, wow.   That sounds good. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE You know what would be cool tonight, is to go to the Torrance Drive-in. They're showing all eleven Planet of the Apes movies. From 7:30 to 8:00 tomorrow morning. \nBOB ARCTOR Can a drive-in show movies in the morning? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I haven't seen all the Ape movies in years. And the last one for longer than that, the one where they reveal (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (cont'd) all the famous guys in history, like Nero and Lincoln, were secretly apes... \nINT. DONNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIt's dark. The door unlocks, light from the hall spills in. Donna enters, flips on the light. There's a trail of newspapers on the floor. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Stay on the newspaper. I just had the rug shampooed. \nArctor enters and stands on a square of newspaper. He looks around. The place is cluttered with piles of stuff \nDONNA HAWTHORNE No, you're too ugly. \nBOB ARCTOR What? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE No! Look, I snort a lot of coke; I have to be super careful because I snort a lot of coke. \nBOB ARCTOR Ugly?   Fuck you, Donna. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Just leave my body alone. \nBOB ARCTOR (putting on his shoes) Sure. Yeah. You better believe it. \nArctor rises, disappears into the kitchen. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (calling after) I don't like people to grope my body! (talking to herself) I have to watch out for that because I do so much coke. Someday I'm gonna go over the Canadian border with four pounds of coke in my snatch. I'll say I'm a Catholic and a virgin. \nArctor passes through the room with his bags of Death. \nBOB ARCTOR I'm taking off. \nHe heads for the door.   Donna tries to rise, confused and half asleep. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDONNA HAWTHORNE You don't have your car. I'll drive you, man. (looks for her shoes) But you can see why I have to protect my snatch -- \nBOB ARCTOR You're too stoned to drive and you never let anyone else drive that little roller skate of yours. \nShe jerks upright and glares wildly at him. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (yelling) That's because no one else can fucking drive my car! Nobody else ever gets it right, no man especially! Driving or anything else! Listen, you had your hands down into my -- \nArctor is out the door. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nArctor hurries through the darkness. Donna pants behind him, trying to catch up. She does. Arctor keeps walking. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE I'm dreadfully sorry I hurt your feelings. Okay? I was out of it. \nBOB ARCTOR (muttering) Too ugly. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Sometimes I get really spaced. You wanna come back? Or what? You wanna go to the drive-in? What about the Southern Comfort? C'mon, I'm sorry. \nArctor stops, stares off for a while.   Donna watches, waits. \nBOB ARCTOR Okay. \nThey turn and head back to the house. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDONNA HAWTHORNE That sure is good hash though, huh? \nThey walk in silence. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE You know what I'm going to do someday, Bob? I'm going to move north to Oregon and live in the snow. Have a little house and a vegetable garden. \nBOB ARCTOR You'll have to save up for that. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (glancing up shyly) He'll get me that. What's-his-name. \nBOB ARCTOR Who? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (sharing a secret) Mr. Right. He'll drive an Aston- Martin and take me north in it. And that's where the little old fashioned house will be in the snow. \nBOB ARCTOR You sure this'll happen? \nDONNA HAWTHORNE It's in the cards. \nA heaviness descends upon Arctor.    He stops.   Donna stops. \nBOB ARCTOR Hey, man, can I go with you? To Oregon? When you do take off finally? \nDonna smiles up at Arctor. She gently shakes her head \"no.\" He studies her. Her answer will never change. He shivers. Donna takes Arctor's hand, squeezes it, holds it. Her touch fills him. After a moment, Donna lets her hand drop. \nINT. ARCTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nArctor enters the dimly lit bedroom followed by Connie, a skinny girl with hollow eyes and a flat affect. He sifts through his dresser drawer as she hovers behind him. Finally he pulls out a baggie with some pills in it. Throughout, we hear stoned conversation coming from another room. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR Here you go. \nCONNIE Thanks, man. \nConnie stuffs the baggie into her purse. She sits on the bed and begins to unceremoniously undress. When her blouse comes off, we see needle tracks and bruises on her arms. She pulls a comb from her purse and listlessly combs her lank hair. She drops the hand holding the comb and begins to nod. Arctor looks at the tracks, at the pimple on her cheek. Connie wakes up, sort of, and starts combing again. \nCONNIE (CONT'D) (mumbling) Do you have a toothbrush I can use. Aw screw it -- teeth are teeth. I'll brush 'em. You gotta ... \nConnie drones on, but her voice has become so quiet it can't be heard. Arctor watches her lips work soundlessly. Finally her voice becomes audible again. \nJIM BARRIS Yes. About that, Bob. I've already ordered resistors -- \nFred fast-forwards again. Now Barris is on the living room monitor reading about mushrooms and Arctor is on the monitor in his bedroom, writing in his notebook. The phone rings on the living room monitor. Barris picks up. \nJIM BARRIS (CONT'D) Yeah? \nTELEPHONE VOICE #3 Mr. Arctor? \nJIM BARRIS Yes, this is Robert Arctor. \nInside the Fred scramble suit we see Arctor's eyes widen. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTELEPHONE VOICE #3 I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Arctor, but your check did not clear. \nJIM BARRIS Oh, yes, I've been meaning to call you, but I've had a severe bout of intestinal flu, with loss of body heat, pyloric spasms, cramps... \nIn the monitor in his bedroom, Arctor continues to write in his notebook, unaware. In his scramble suit at the console, Bob Arctor, is freaked out, and writes in the same notebook. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Barris portraying Arctor as coming off heroin. \nJIM BARRIS I just haven't been able to get it together to make that little twenty dollar check good, and frankly I don't intend to make it good. \nBOB ARCTOR (IN SCRAMBLE SUIT) What? \nTELEPHONE VOICE #3 What? \nJIM BARRIS You heard me correctly. \nTELEPHONE VOICE #3 Mr. Arctor, those flu symptoms you describe... I think you're a -- \nJIM BARRIS Think what you want. Turn out, tune out, and good-bye. \nBarris hangs up.   Fred checks the LED, picks up his phone. \nFRED Get me a name and address on this. \nOPERATOR Englesohn Locksmith, 1343 Harbor in Anaheim, Loverboy. \nFred hangs up. We move inside the suit to Arctor's troubled face. He writes in his notebook. The V.O. is disturbed. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Barris up to something: pretending to be me... writing rubber checks on my account... representing me as a heroin addict. BUT WHAT IS HE UP TO? \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nFred paces. He passes a wall mirror, glances at his vague face. He moves closer to the mirror, studies himself. \nFRED Arctor must've burned Barris pretty bad to deserve this display of malice. \nScramble Suit #1 approaches Fred. \nSCRAMBLE SUIT #1 I was thinking, do you actually know these losers? Are you in among them? \nFRED Yeah.   I'm there. \nSCRAMBLE SUIT #1 You might want to warn them about the mushrooms. Can you pass it on to them without faulting your cover? \nFRED I suppose I can lay it on that one. (indicates Arctor) Without him flashing on me. He's docile. \nSCRAMBLE SUIT #1 Ugly-looking, too. \nScramble Suit #1 laughs.   Fred joins in wholeheartedly. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER \nFred watches the monitors. Arctor's house is quiet. Barris and Luckman doze in the living room, the television tuned to static. On another monitor, Arctor is sleeping in his bed with a woman. After a beat Fred notices the woman is Donna. We move in close to Fred's ever-changing eyes. \nFRED That can't be right. Arctor has never done it with Donna. Has he? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFred fast-rewinds the tape, switches it to play. Arctor is in bed having sex with Connie. Fred sighs a computerized sigh of relief and fast-forwards the tape. Arctor is now sleeping next to Connie. Fred watches for a moment. As he does the face of the sleeping woman transforms into Donna's. Fred freezes the frame. Then he enlarges the holographic image so it fills up the space previously occupied by all eight monitors. The image is now almost actual size. Fred rises and walks around the console into the projection area. It's as if he's entering Arctor's bedroom, or a slightly scaled down, frozen version of it. He approaches the sleeping couple, bends down and examines the face of the woman. It is clearly Donna. He stands in Arctor's bedroom for a while, confused and disoriented, tries to look at himself in Arctor's bureau mirror. Fred does not appear in the holographic reflection of the room. He shudders, returns to the console, brings up all eight monitors, and turns off the freeze-frame. On the bedroom monitor, Arctor awakens, and glances over at the woman sleeping next to him. His eyes widen. He fumbles for the switch on the bedside lamp, knocks it over. He turns back and stares at the sleeping woman. As does Fred at the console. \nEXT. ENGLESOHN LOCK COMPANY - MORNING \nA yellow cab pulls up.     Arctor emerges. \nINT. ENGLESOHN LOCK COMPANY - CONTINUOUS \nA plump old lady stands behind the counter.    Arctor enters. \nOLD LADY Yes sir?   Good morning. \nBOB ARCTOR Hi, I'm here... \nThe scene shifts to very slow motion. Everything grows quiet. Colors become saturated, as in a Raphael painting. \nFAR-AWAY VOICE Ihr Instrumente freilich spottet mein/Mit Rad und Kammen, Walz' und Bugel:/Ich stand am Tor, ihr... The scene shifts back.     Maybe a hiccup's worth of time has passed. \nOLD MAN (V.O.) Let me talk to him. \nOLD LADY (V.O.) Mr. Arctor? It says here it was in Santa Ana. On Main Street. \nEXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT \nArctor is stoned and on the phone in the crowded, smokey, noisy room. A blonde woman nibbles his ear. \nBOB ARCTOR Yeah, I lost my ignition key. (pause) 34881 Main Street, Santa Ana... \nEXT. SHELL STATION - MORNING \nArctor hangs up the pay phone.   He paces, trying to think. \nBOB ARCTOR So, Arctor's the forger, not Barris! Not deliberately, but because his brain is slushed on dope. All their brains are... \nThe busy intersection slows almost to a standstill. Colors become saturated. Details seem momentous: A man gesturing in mid-conversation, a newspaper blowing down the street. \nFAR-AWAY VOICE Der wurme gleich' ich, der den Staub Durchwuhlt,/Den, wie er sich im Staube nahrend lebt,/Des Wandrers Tritt... Back to normal as a car passes with a faulty muffler. \nBOB ARCTOR ... slushed and mutually interacting in a slushed way. \nINT. CAB - MORNING \nArctor rides in the back. He stares out the window at the endless loop of McDonald's, Thriftys, 7-11's. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) But what is Arctor up to? Clearly the Sheriff's Office has some good reasons to focus their investigation on him. No doubt reasons I know nothing about. My job is to report, theirs to evaluate. \nArctor lets his head fall back against the seat. \nEXT. ARCTOR'S HOUSE - MORNING \nThe cab drops Arctor off. He heads up the newspaper-strewn walk to the front door. He eyes the house and the grounds: The house needs paint, a rain gutter is halfway dislodged. The yard is overgrown. \nBOB ARCTOR Fucking waste of a perfectly good house. A family could live here, for Christ's sake. (picks up newspapers) Oughta take it away from this fuck. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nArctor arrives at the front door, tries to pull his house keys from his pocket without spilling the armful of newspapers. He succeeds, opens the door, enters the house. \nINT. ARCTOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nThe place is a mess.    Arctor drops the papers on the floor. \nBOB ARCTOR (for benefit of scanners) Nobody home, I guess. \nArctor moves through the room in an almost studied way. There is something stilted about the way he intentionally avoids looking in the direction of the scanner. \nSHOT OF NOTEBOOK DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT \nKids playing in background. The camera glides across the following words as the dispassionate V.O. reads along. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) What does a scanner see? Does it see into the head? Into the heart? Does it see into me clearly or darkly? I hope clearly, because I can't any longer. I see only murk inside and out. \nINT. ARCTOR'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nArctor rises and pulls a book from the shelf. It is The Picture Book of Sexual Love. He opens the book, revealing a photo of a man nibbling a woman's breast. He positions himself so as to be best picked up by the living room scanner,then appears to read aloud from the book. We can see that what he is reciting is not on the page. \nBOB ARCTOR Any given man sees only a tiny portion of the total truth, and... \nShift to slow motion.    Saturated colors.    Very quiet. \nFAR-AWAY VOICE Weh! steck' ich in dem Kerker... INT. CHARLES FRECK'S APARTMENT - DAY \nFreck lays fresh sheets on his bed in his neat apartment. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCHARLES FRECK It is no problem how to kill yourself in the circles in which I hang. When life becomes more and more depressing as you watch those you know falling apart from drug use, just take a large quantity of reds. \nFreck places a bag of reds on the night table. \nCHARLES FRECK Wash 'em down with a bottle of cheap wine. \nFreck pulls a bottle of Thunderbird from the counter of his kitchenette and places it next to the pills. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) The hard part is choosing the correct artifacts to be found on you by later archaeologists. So they know from which stratum you came and where your head was at when you did it. \nFreck pulls a copy of \"The Fountainhead\" from his book shelf, and places it face down and open on his bed. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) I will be found with Ayn Rand's \"The Fountainhead\" open by my side to prove I have been a misunderstood superman rejected by the masses and so, in a sense, murdered by their scorn. \nFreck places a typewritten letter next to the book. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Also, an unfinished letter to Exxon protesting the cancellation of my gas credit card. That way I will indict the system and achieve something by my death. Over and above what the death itself achieves. \nFreck lies on the bed and readies himself for the suicide. He unscrews the cap on the wine, tastes it, reconsiders. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Perhaps a connoisseur wine is in order on such an auspicious occasion. \nINT. CHARLES FRECK'S CAR - DAY \nERNIE LUCKMAN The kids wouldn't believe that either. \nBOB ARCTOR Kids never believe anything anymore. \nFred's phone rings. It jerks him out of his focus on the monitor. He pauses the tape and picks up the phone. \nFRED Yeah? \nTELEPHONE VOICE Fred, we've processed your tests. We need you to come back for the full battery. Tomorrow at three. Do you remember the room number? \nFRED Um... okay. \nTELEPHONE VOICE It's 203. Are you all right, Fred? Any confusion? Difficulty identifying persons or objects? Does anything you see appear inverted or reversed? Any space-time or language disorientation? \nFRED Um, what?   I just... what exactly have you processed... that is, is this in regard to the Lion's Club speech? \nTELEPHONE VOICE We'll take all that up tomorrow, Fred. \nDial tone. Fred hangs up and fast-forwards the tape. He watches as the tape whirs through the machine. He presses stop, the tape jerks to a halt. Fred breathes hard, although it comes through the grid sounding oddly mechanical. He pushes play. Luckman is cleaning grass on the floor. Barris is in the corner winding string. Arctor rubs his finger on the lip of a wine glass, making it hum. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nERNIE LUCKMAN ... this guy appeared on tv, claiming to be a world-famous imposter. He said he'd posed at one time or another as a great surgeon, a theoretical submolecular high-velocity particle research physicist, a Finnish novelist, a deposed president of Argentina... \nBOB ARCTOR He got away with it? Never got caught? \nERNIE LUCKMAN See, the guy never really posed as any of it. He only posed as a world- famous imposter. Turns out he just pushed a broom at Disneyland, until he read about this actual world-famous imposter, and he thought, I can pose as all those things, then he thought, hell, I'll just pose as an imposter. Save a lot of time, a lot easier. Made almost as much money as the real imposter with books and movie rights. \nJIM BARRIS We see imposters in our lives, now and then. But not posing as physicists. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Narks, you mean. Yeah, I wonder what a nark looks like? \nBOB ARCTOR It's like asking what an imposter looks like. I asked a hash dealer who'd been busted once what the nark who busted him looked like -- \nJIM BARRIS Looked just like us. \nBOB ARCTOR More so. The dealer dude told me the nark had longer hair than we do. I guess the moral is, stay away from guys who look like us. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Narks give me the creeps. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR How could a guy do that is what I want to know, pose as a nark? \nLUCKMAN AND BARRIS What? \nBOB ARCTOR Shit, I'm spaced. Pose as a nark. \nERNIE LUCKMAN POSE AS A NARK? POSE AS A NARK? \nBOB ARCTOR My brains are scrambled today.      I better go crash. \nFred freezes the tape.   He scribbles in notebook. \nSHOT OF NOTEBOOK \nFred writes in a different handwriting now: choppy, backward- slanted, crabbed. \nFRED (V.O.) Posing as a nark. What does Arctor mean? \nINT. CHARLES FRECK'S APARTMENT - DAY \nFreck sits up in bed in his now electric yellow room, sipping magenta wine. The walls are dripping. \nCHARLES FRECK I've been burned. These are not reds, but rather some freaky psychedelic, the likes of which I have never seen. \nThe wall across from Freck's bed parts with a sloshing sound, and an eight foot high creature with many eyes and ultra-hip clothing appears at his bedside, holding a scroll. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Fuck. You're going to read me my sins, aren't you? \nThe creature nods solemnly and unrolls the scroll. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) And it's going to take a hundred thousand million hours, isn't it? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCREATURE We are no longer in the mundane universe. Your sins will be read to you ceaselessly throughout eternity. \nCHARLES FRECK Know your fucking dealer, man. \nCREATURE (reading from scroll) November 14, 1962, 3:08:23 pm: you did knowingly and with malice aforethought punch your baby sister Evelyn on the left side of the head when your mother was not looking. November 14, 1962, 3:08:27 pm: you did knowingly and with malice aforethought punch your baby sister on the left arm when your mother was not looking. November 14, 1962, 3:08:32 pm: you did... \nEXT. BOB ARCTOR'S FRONT YARD - DAY \nArctor is finishing up mowing the lawn. He is intently focused on the task, but has done an erratic job: the left side of the yard has been left almost completely unmowed. Arctor turns to enter the house. We see that the left side of his face is completely unshaved. \nINT. ROOM 203 - DAY \nFred is in the midst of a battery of tests being administered by two uniformed medical technicians who resemble the technicians who administered the previous tests, but are not the same. Fred's head rests in a contraption that divides his face in half, so his right eye and left eye can be exposed to different projected images. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #3 Okay, Fred, in rapid succession you will see a number of objects pass before first you left eye, then your right eye. At the same time, on the panel before you, outlines of these objects will appear. You are to match, by means of the punch pencil you hold in your hand, the outline with the object. These images will flash very quickly so don't hesitate too long. You will be scored for time as well as accuracy. Okay? \nJIM BARRIS When you examine my evidence, you will undoubtedly conclude that Substance D is produced by a foreign nation determined to overthrow the U.S., and (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJIM BARRIS (cont'd) that Robert Arctor has his hands deep in the machinery of -- \nHANK Can you tells us the name of anyone else inside this organization? \nJIM BARRIS A Miss Donna Hawthorne. On various pretexts he goes over to her place and colludes with her regularly. \nFred laughs his computerized laugh.      Barris laughs also. \nFRED Colludes?    What do you mean? \nJIM BARRIS I've followed him in my car, sir. \nFRED She's his girl! \nHANK (to Fred) You think there's nothing to this? \nFRED (shrugging) Let's look at his evidence. \nHANK (to Barris) Bring us your evidence. (to Fred) Maybe we should send an officer with him to retrieve it. \nJIM BARRIS There's one more thing. Mr. Arctor is addicted to Substance D. His mind is deranged now. He's become dangerous. \nFRED Dangerous. \nJIM BARRIS He's already having episodes such as occur with brain damage from Substance D. Deterioration in the corpus callosum. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHANK This kind of unsupported speculation is worthless. We'll send an officer with you to collect your evidence. \nJIM BARRIS But, sirs -- \nHANK We'll arrange for an officer out of uniform, so it won't be conspicuous. \nJIM BARRIS I might be murdered. Mr. Arctor is, as I say -- \nHANK We appreciate your extreme risk, Mr. Barris. If your information is of significant value in obtaining a conviction, then naturally -- \nJIM BARRIS That's not why I'm doing this. The man is sick. Brain damaged from Substance D. The reason I am here -- \nHANK We don't care why you're here. We only care if your evidence amounts to anything. The rest is your problem. \nJIM BARRIS Thank you, sirs. Thank you very much. \nBarris grins and nods and sweats. \nINT. ROOM 203 - DAY \nFred enters. Medical Technician #1 and Medical Technician #2 look up from their desks. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Fred, is that you? \nFRED Yes. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Have a seat, then. \nFred sits in a chair against the wall. The technicians go back to their paper work. Fred waits stiffly. Finally, Medical Technician #2 looks back up. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Fred, we've processed your results. \nFRED Uh-huh. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 You demonstrate something we call a competition phenomenon. \nFRED (getting up to leave) Okay. Thank you. \nMedical Technician #2 gestures for Fred to sit.         He does. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN   #2 It's a competition between your   left and right hemispheres. Kind of    like you have two gas gauges on your   car, one says your tank is full, the   other says it's empty. \nFRED Why do I have two gas gauges? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Substance D. Damage has taken place in the normally dominant left hemisphere. The right hemisphere is attempting to compensate for the impairment. But the twin functions do not fuse. Now, we could perform a right hemispherectomy -- \nFRED Will these go away?    These gas gauges? \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 It's probably a functional impairment. \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 It may be organic. Maybe permanent. \nFRED Wait. I'm confused.    Are you saying it is organic, or -- \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Even if it's brain damage, there are experiments now in the removal of small sections of both hemispheres which seem to abort compete gestalt- processing. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 But the problem then is the individual only receives partial incoming sense data. Instead of having two signals, he gets half a signal. \nFRED Half a gas gauge?      What would that be like? \nINT. HANK'S OFFICE - DAY \nFRED Thank you very much. \nHANK You want a cigarette? \nFRED No. I'm quitting them, too.   I'm quitting everything. \nHANK Good for you. It's like I tell my children -- \nFRED I have kids, too.   Two little girls. \nHANK I don't believe you do.   You're not supposed to. \nSHOT OF ARCTOR FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH \nNow all the faces, including Arctor's, are gone. \nINT. HANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nFRED Maybe not. \nHANK I don't think you're going to make it in the mountains, even if we get someone to drive you. Where else would you like to go? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFRED I don't know. I don't know. \nHANK What about over to Donna Hawthorne's? I know you're close. \nSHOT OF DONNA HAWTHORNE TOUCHING ARCTOR'S HAND \nINT. HANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nFRED How do you know that? \nHANK By a process of elimination we were able to determine you're Bob Arctor. \nFRED (horrified, confused) Arctor?    I'm Bob Arctor?  But he's ugly! \nHANK Nevermind. It's not important. (into phone) Get me a Donna Hawthorne at... (to Fred) Where does she work? \nFRED Uh, Thompson Jewelers.   I'm Arctor? \nHANK (into phone) ... at Thompson Jewelers. (to Fred) We should probably get you to a hospital. Barris poisoned you. It was really Barris, we were interested in. That's why we set up the scanners. He's into something heavy and sick, and it has to do with guns. \nFRED (massaging temples) So, wait, you used me to get to Barris? \nHANK We had to get to him, Bob. He's bad news. We couldn't tell you. We were afraid you'd spill the beans. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFRED (beat, weakly) You fuckers. You fuckers. \nThe intercom buzzes. Hank flips off his voice grid, picks up the phone. It's the first time we hear his real voice. \nHANK (CONT'D) Hey, Donna? This is a buddy of Bob's. He's in a bad way. I'm not jiving you. So could you pick him up, ... \nFred watches Hank, sounding like a head, looking like a blur. \nINT. DONNA'S CAR - EARLY EVENING \nDonna drives a sick Bob Arctor along a tree-lined road. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Before we go to New-Path, Bob, I thought maybe we'd drive into the hills, y'know, look at the city lights. \nDonna waits for a response, there is none. She glances over at Arctor. He rests his forehead against the window. She sighs. Suddenly he begins to heave and vomit. Donna pulls onto the shoulder, gets out of the car, hurries to the passenger side to help Arctor. \nEXT. TREE-LINED ROAD - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nArctor is on his hands and knees vomiting. Donna kneels beside him, holding his forehead. He finishes. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Let's sit a few minutes. \nBOB ARCTOR (so weakly) Do you have any hash? \nDonna looks at him for a second, gets up, fusses around under the passenger seat, and pulls out a piece of foil and a pipe. She takes Arctor by the hand. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE C'mon, let's get off the road a little bit. In case of cops. \nDonna and Arctor walk through the trees in silence, arrive at a clearing, from which the city lights can be seen. She sits Arctor down, fills the pipe, lights it, and draws. She passes the pipe to Arctor, but he is shivering and glassy- eyed. A big, dark stain is forming on his pants. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (CONT'D) Here. \nShe inhales, leans forward to super-charge Arctor. But he doubles over, clutching his stomach. He vomits and moans a crazy song-like moan, attempting to comfort himself. Donna touches his hand. But he is unaware of it. She sits on a rock and stares at the city lights below. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (CONT'D) I guess we never know what's in store for us. \nArctor continues to clutch himself and moan. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (CONT'D) Did you know this dude Tony Amsterdam? \nNo response from Arctor.    Donna relights the pipe, inhales. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (CONT'D) After he saw God, he felt really good, for around a year. Then he felt worse than he had ever felt before in his life. Because one day it came to him, he was never going to see God again. He was going to live out the rest of his life, fifty years maybe, and see nothing but what he had always seen. He realized he was going to have to live on and on with no purpose. Just a lump of flesh grinding along, eating, drinking, working, sleeping, crapping -- \nINT. NEW-PATH RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nArctor sits on a folding chair against the wall, staring at his cup of coffee. Mike walks by in his bright new shirt. \nMIKE Hey, Bruce! \nArctor looks up. \nBOB ARCTOR Are you leaving here? \nMIKE (chuckling) No, man, I can never leave   here. Too many temptations out there   for the likes of us. No, I'm just    going into town to pick up a donation   of semi- rotten vegetables. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR Semi-rotten vegetables. \nSHOT OF NOTEBOOK DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT \nkids laughing in background.    We scan the following words, read offhandedly by Arctor. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part... \nThe camera pulls back to reveal that it's Donna reading the journal. She's sitting at a picnic table outside a McDonald's. Her eyes move back and forth across the page. Near her, a group of children laugh and play on a McDonaldland jungle gym. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...but then shall I know even as also I am known. \nThat's the last entry. She closes the notebook, takes a sip of Coke, and watches the children play. A pick-up truck pulls into the parking lot. Mike gets out, approaches Donna's table, sits across from her. There's a silence, then: \nDONNA HAWTHORNE So are they paranoid about him? \nMIKE No. He just sits there all day. There's really nothing to suspect. They can't get anything out of him during the game sessions. \nDonna looks off for a moment, sadly. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Well, then, will he be able to act, when the time comes? Is anything left? \nMIKE You never really know. A memory. A few charred brain cells flicker on. People like him are clacking insects. All reflex. We can only hope he's got the right reflex. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDONNA HAWTHORNE It was very well drilled into him. (forlorn) Such a price to pay. The government asks an awful lot. \nMIKE Life asks an awful lot. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE (angry) In this case, the fucking government. Bob didn't volunteer. He was sacrificed. He was my friend, y'know. (beat) I don't want to be on this assignment much longer. I just want it over. Shit. Sometimes I think we're colder than they are. \nMIKE I see a warm person when I look at you, Donna. \nDONNA HAWTHORNE Oh, I'm warm on the outside. Warm face, warm eyes, warm fucking fake smile. But inside I'm cold all the time. I am full of lies. I am awful. \nDonna gets up and walks away.    Mike watches after her. \nINT. NEW-PATH HALLWAY - DAY \nArctor opens the door to the room where he first saw the children. In there now is an old woman trying to juggle. She smiles at Arctor and he sees that she has almost no teeth. \nOLD WOMAN Can you do this? \nShe throws the balls in the air to juggle and they fall back onto her then bounce onto the floor. She stoops over, spitting and laughing. Arctor is dismayed. \nBOB ARCTOR I can't do that. \nOLD WOMAN I can. \nShe tries again, fails, laughs. A staffer appears next to the Arctor in the doorway, sniffs the air \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNEW-PATH STAFFER Donna, you need to clean yourself. You stink. \nBOB ARCTOR (horrified) Donna?! \nThe old woman shuffles past Arctor and the staffer. \nBOB ARCTOR How long has Donna been here? \nNEW-PATH STAFFER I don't know. Six months. \nBOB ARCTOR (relieved) Oh, then it's not Donna. I've been here a week. And Donna drove me here. And she was fine: sad-eyed, quiet and composed. So beautiful. Leather jacket. That purse with the rabbit's foot dangling. Just like always. \nINT. LOUNGE - DAY \nArctor and Mike sit across from each other over coffee. \nMIKE I think I'm going to try to get you a job on one of our farms, Bruce. When you're ready. \nBOB ARCTOR Can I work with animals. I like animals. Can I work with them? \nMIKE No, I want to try you with crops.    I think that'd be good for you. \nBOB ARCTOR I want to work with something living. \n", "test1_input": "NEW-PATH GIRL Can I help you? \nBOB ARCTOR I'm in a bad place. I wanna turn myself in for treatment. \nINT. FIDDLER'S THREE COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nCharles Freck and Jim Barris sit in a booth. Freck plays distractedly with his glazed doughnut. Barris, in shades, pulls apart his patty melt, inspecting each ingredient. \nCHARLES FRECK Hey, Barris, I'm thinking of turning myself in to New-Path. \nBarris doesn't seem at all interested. \nJIM BARRIS No shit. \nCHARLES FRECK But it's tough, that cold turkey thing they do. They watch you night and day so you don't snuff. But they never give you anything, like a doctor will, like Valium or like that. \nJIM BARRIS Hey, what kind of bread is this on the patty melt, anyway? \nCHARLES FRECK Look on the menu. It explains everything. \nBarris picks up a menu, studies it as he speaks. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJIM BARRIS If you go into New-Path, you'll experience symptoms that emanate up from the basic fluids of the body, specifically those located in the brain. By that I refer to the catecholamines, such as noradrenaline and serotonin. You see, Substance D functions this way: it interacts with the catecholamines in such a fashion that involement is locked in at a subcellular level. Biological counteradaptation has occurred. (looks up) Nine-grain wheat. \nINT. NEW-PATH - DAY \nArctor sits in a small room painted institutional green. He holds a styrofoam cup of coffee in his theatrically shaking hands. The New-Path girl stares at him, arms akimbo. Two large impassive guys stand near the door. \nNEW-PATH GIRL You look like hell, mister. \nNEW-PATH GUY #1 Yeah. Like real shit. What you been doing, lying in your own crap? \nNEW-PATH GUY #2 Crap lying in crap. How appropriate. \nINT. FIDDLER'S THREE COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nA cute waitress comes up to Barris and Freck's table. \nWAITRESS So is everything good, fellas? \nFreck becomes panicked, paranoid. He frantically chews some doughnut, tries to appear straight. Barris, in control, signals to Freck that everything is copacetic. \nJIM BARRIS Say, is your name Patty? \nWAITRESS No. (indicates name tag over right breast) It's Beth. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCHARLES FRECK (under breath, snickering) I wonder what the left one's called. \nWAITRESS I'm sorry, hon? \nCHARLES FRECK No.   Nothing. \nJIM BARRIS The waitress we had last time was named Patty. Same as the sandwich. \nWAITRESS That must have been a different Patty from the sandwich. I think she spells it with an i. \nJIM BARRIS Everything is super good. \nFreck looks over leering Barris's head and sees a thought balloon in which the waitress is stripping off her clothes. \nWAITRESS (IN THOUGHT BALLOON) (moaning) Oh, oh, fuck me, Barris. Fuck me... \nFreck, nervous the waitress will see the balloon, tries to get her attention on him. \nCHARLES FRECK Everything is not good with me. I got a lot of problems nobody else has. \nThe waitress looks down sympathetically at Freck. \nWAITRESS Oh, no.   That's too bad. \nJIM BARRIS More people than you think have such problems. This is a world of illness, and getting progressively worse. \nThe waitress now looks with some confusion at Barris.   Freck glances nervously at the balloon above Barris's head.   In it the waitress is being fucked from behind by Barris. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWAITRESS (IN THOUGHT BALLOON) Oh, oh, oooh oh, Barris... \nWAITRESS (smiling) So would you guys like to order dessert? We have fresh peach pie. \nFreck can't take his eyes from the thought balloon. \nCHARLES FRECK No!   No, we don't want any dessert! \nThe waitress smiles, nods, and leaves the table.   The thought balloon dissipates. \nCHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Fruit pies are for old ladies anyway. \n", "test1_true": "Arctor sits surrounded by the three standing New-Path people. \nBOB ARCTOR This place is the only hope I could think of. I had a friend come in here. A black dude, in his thirties -- \nNEW-PATH GIRL You'll meet the family later. If you qualify. You have to be bad off to be let in here, mister. \nBOB ARCTOR I am bad off. \nNEW-PATH GIRL It's going to be super rough. You'll gnaw your pillow. You'll foam at the mouth. You'll dirty yourself the way sick animals do. \nBOB ARCTOR Okay, but listen, this black guy, my buddy, goes by the name of Spade, did he make it here? I sure hope he didn't get picked up by the pigs on the way over. \nNEW-PATH GIRL There are no one-to-one relationships at New-Path. You'll learn that. \nINT. FIDDLER'S THREE COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nJIM BARRIS Tell me, why the debate regarding turning yourself in for residence therapy at a drug rehab facility? \nCHARLES FRECK My friend Jerry Fabin and his aphids. \nJIM BARRIS (dismissive wave) Fabin was a special case. \nCHARLES FRECK There's another reason. I'm running low again, and I can't stand this always running low and not knowing if I'm ever going to score again. Actually, though, I may have a new source. That Donna chick. \nJIM BARRIS Oh, Bob's girl. \nCHARLES FRECK His old lady. \nJIM BARRIS No.   He never got into her pants. \nCHARLES FRECK Really?   Can't Bob get it on? \nJIM BARRIS (shrugs) It's possible Donna's on junk. Her aversion to bodily contact -- junkies lose interest in sex, you see, due to their organs swelling up from vasoconstriction. And Donna shows inordinate failure of sexual arousal, not just to Bob, but to... other males as well. \nCHARLES FRECK I never shot smack. Needles are a bummer to me. \nJIM BARRIS (conspiratorially) But... I can show you how to lay Donna for ninety-eight cents. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCHARLES FRECK I don't want to lay her. I just want to buy from her. \nJIM BARRIS Donna does coke. Anybody who would give her a gram of coke she would undoubtedly spread her legs for. \nCHARLES FRECK I wish you wouldn't talk that way. Besides who has the money to procure a gram of coke? \nJIM BARRIS I, my friend, can derive a gram of coke for a total cost to me of under one dollar. From a product readily available at your neighborhood 7-11. \nCHARLES FRECK That's bullshit. \nINT. CHARLES FRECK'S CAR - DAY \nFreck and Barris drive along. \nCHARLES FRECK Which 7-11 store do you prefer to shop at? The one on Lincoln is nice. \nJIM BARRIS That's a fine 7-11. \nCHARLES FRECK Although what about the one on 8th? They have the wider aisles. A more spacious shopping experience. \nJIM BARRIS Let's not forget the one on Katella with the foxy cashier to hit on. \nINT. BOB ARCTOR'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nIt's a mess. Freck is on the couch smoking a joint. A cat sleeps in his lap. Another cat and a dog lie on either side of him. A disassembled cephscope is on the coffee table, wires exposed. Barris hovers over the dining room table where he has set up a makeshift chemistry lab. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCHARLES FRECK What's with Bob's cephscope, his prize possession of the entire world? \nJIM BARRIS Oh, it's been sabotaged by person or persons unknown. \nBarris holds up an aerosol can of Solarcaine sunburn spray. \nJIM BARRIS (CONT'D) Behold, what they've deliberately done is mix the cocaine with oil so it can't be extracted -- they cleverly call it benzocaine -- but my knowledge of chemistry is such that I know precisely how to separate the two. \nBarris sprays the entire contents of the can into a baggie. \nCHARLES FRECK This is super unreal. I'm flipping. \nBarris shakes salt into the gummy slime in the bag. \nJIM BARRIS Now I'll freeze it, which causes the cocaine crystals to rise to the top because they are lighter than air. \nBarris pours the slime into a jar. \nJIM BARRIS (CONT'D) Than oil, I mean. \nBarris puts the jar in the freezer. \n", "test2_input": "BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... my front yard,... \nArctor, in shorts, appears pushing a lawnmower. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... my power mower. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nArctor sits on the floor bleeding. He looks at his wife and children, their faces somehow becoming more and more vague. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) All the elements that made up my life were right there. And nothing new would ever happen. Like a little plastic boat that would sail on forever, without incident, until it finally sank, which would be a secret relief to all. \nSHOT OF NOTEBOOK DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT \nKids laughing.    Camera skims across these handwritten words: \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) So I ended that life and started this one. Now I dwell in a ugly world... \nINT. ARCTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPresent-day druggie Arctor returns to bed with his beer. \nJIM BARRIS (O.S.) This one will be totally soundless. \nThere is another extremely loud gunshot. \nEXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nBarris studies his silencer, perplexed.   Dogs bark again. \nERNIE LUCKMAN Jesus, Barris. Y'know, you're supposed to be fixing the cephscope. Bob's lying in his bed right now thinking you're fixing his cephscope. \nINT. ARCTOR'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nArctor lies in bed and writes in his notebook. The voice- over is different here: It's halting, as if he's composing; and it's read with immediacy and anxiety. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Now I dwell in an ugly... disordered world. But this very disorder... permits... the... unpredictable to -- \nThere's a knock on the door.    Arctor slips the notebook under the mattress. \nBOB ARCTOR (CONT'D) Yeah? \nMumbling outside door.    Arctor fingers the gun under his pillow. \nBOB ARCTOR (CONT'D) Come in, Barris. \nThe door opens.    Barris enters, shuffling, smiling, sweating. \nJIM BARRIS Hey, Bob.    I thought you'd be sleeping. \nBarris sits, uninvited, on the edge of Arctor's bed. \nJIM BARRIS (CONT'D) I am here to inform you, Bob, that I have formulated an initial theory as to who may have systematically damaged your cephscope with malice and may do it again. \nArctor waits.    Barris smiles a shit-eating smile. \nJIM BARRIS (CONT'D) (pointing) You. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR Why the fuck would I screw up my own cephscope? \nJIM BARRIS No, no. You... (points at Arctor) ... are looking at the person who did it. (points at himself) That was my complete, intended statement, which I was not allowed to utter. \nBOB ARCTOR You did it? \nJIM BARRIS I mean it's my theory that I did it. Under post-hypnotic suggestion. With an amnesia block so I wouldn't remember \nBOB ARCTOR Oh, Jesus, Barris. Go fuck yourself. \nArctor turns away from Barris.   Barris leans in close. \nJIM BARRIS Don't you see, Bob, I've got the advanced, specialized, technical, electronic skills. I have access, because I live here. It all fits. (beat) What I can't figure out is my motive. \nBOB ARCTOR How about, you're a fucked-up lunatic? \nJIM BARRIS I might have been hired by secret forces. It could be as big as that, Bob. As huge as that. \nArctor reaches under his bed frame and pulls out two tabs of Substance D. He washes them down with beer, closes his eyes. \nBOB ARCTOR Get lost. \nEXT. BOB ARCTOR'S HOUSE - MORNING \nArctor, Barris, and Luckman emerge from the house, bedraggled and bleary-eyed, and climb into Arctor's car. \nINT. ARCTOR'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nArctor starts the car, begins to pull out of the driveway. \nJIM BARRIS Oh, hold on, Bob. I forgot something. I forgot my antihistamine capsules. \n", "test2_true": "ERNIE LUCKMAN Jim Barris does not have allergies. \nEXT. FREEWAY - MORNING \nArctor, Barris, and Luckman drive along. \nINT. ARCTOR'S CAR - MORNING \nThe car pulls to a stop on a residential street. It's a a cruddy neighborhood. Apartment buildings. Graffiti. \nBOB ARCTOR You guys track down Andy and the hot scope. I'll pick you up in two hours. \nJIM BARRIS And where are you off to? \nBOB ARCTOR Dropping in on a friend. \nJIM BARRIS Mysterious Bob Arctor. \nEXT. HOUSING PROJECT - MORNING \nArctor pulls into the parking lot, gets out of the car. \nSHOT OF NOTEBOOK DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT \nKids voices in background.    Offhand Arctor reads the entry. \nBOB ARCTOR (V.O.) While in Long Beach today I checked in on Kim, an addict acquaintance who lives with dealer Dan Blake. My intention was to get the latest on Blake, but also to strand Barris and Luckman down here long enough for the scanners to be installed. \nINT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - MORNING \nArctor knocks on an apartment door. Shuffling inside.    The chained door opens slightly. An eye peeks out. \nKIMBERLY Yes? \nBOB ARCTOR It's me, Kimberly. Bob Arctor. \nKimberly unchains the door. She has a black eye and a split lip. Her manner is listless. Arctor enters the apartment and Kimberly closes the door behind him. \nINT. KIMBERLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nArctor looks around. The place is a shambles. There's been a fight. The windows are broken, there's glass on the floor. \nBOB ARCTOR Are you alone? \nKIMBERLY Dan and I had a fight and he split. \nBOB ARCTOR He beat you up? \nKIMBERLY Thank God he didn't have his knife. His case-knife, which he now carries in a sheath on his belt. \nKimberly drops back into a chair and stares blankly. \nKIMBERLY (CONT'D) Why are you here, Bob? I'm bummed, I really am. \nBOB ARCTOR Do you want him back? \nKIMBERLY Well... (listless shrug) Who knows? \nArctor looks out the window at the street. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR How long can you go without? \nKIMBERLY Maybe. Maybe. Another day. \nBOB ARCTOR Can't you get it anywhere else? Y'know the name of Dan's supplier? Maybe you could deal directly. \nKIMBERLY I dunno. \nThe sound of loud, irregular car pipes.   Kimberly stiffens. \nKIMBERLY (CONT'D) Is that him?    Fuck. Red '79 Torino? \nArctor looks out and spots a red Torino pulling into the lot. \nBOB ARCTOR Yeah. \nA car door slams.    Kimberly shuffles to the front door and triple locks it. \nKIMBERLY Probably has his case-knife with him. Y'know, he keeps it in a sheath on his belt now. \nBOB ARCTOR You should call the police. \nKIMBERLY No phone. \nBOB ARCTOR Kim, he'll kill you. \nKimberly shrugs and sits back down, staring blankly, hands clasped in her lap.

NEW-PATH - DAY \nGeorge, a staff member, addresses the camera as he leads it down a dormitory hallway. \nGEORGE All right, Bruce, what you'll be doing here first is the bathrooms. \nGeorge stops at a closet door, opens it, and pulls out a mop, pail, and some powdered soap. He closes the door, and continues down the hall. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) The floors, the basins, and especially the toilets. There are three bathrooms, one on each floor. Okay, Bruce? \nAngle on Bruce. We see that Bruce is Bob Arctor. It is, however, a different Arctor: hair cut short and unstylish, nondescript Goodwill clothing, and a mousy demeanor. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBOB ARCTOR Okay. \nGeorge pushes open another door and enters.       Arctor follows. \nINT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nArctor and George stand in a dorm-style bathroom, with several toilets. George hands the mop and pail to Arctor. \nGEORGE You feel you know how to clean a bathroom?   Start, and I'll give you some pointers. \nArctor nods obediently, takes the pail to the sink, sprinkles in some soap flakes, and begins to fill it with water. He becomes transfixed with the foam forming in the pail and the roar of the running water. After a while, George speaks, sounding very far away. \nGEORGE (O.C.) Don't fill it all the way, Bruce, or you won't be able to lift it. \nBOB ARCTOR Okay. \nINT. LOUNGE - DAY \nArctor sits with a paper cup of coffee. There are others in the lounge, but they pay him no attention. He stares down at his coffee, focused on the rising and swirling steam. Jabbering is heard in the background. \nNEW-PATH RESIDENT #1 If you could see from inside a dead person, you could still see, but you couldn't operate the eye muscles so you couldn't focus. \nNEW-PATH RESIDENT #2 Exactly.   Just blurry. \nNEW-PATH RESIDENT #1 Plus, you couldn't turn your head or your eyeballs. All you could do is wait and wait until some object passed by. It'd be a terrible scene. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNEW-PATH RESIDENT #2 I think that's what it means to be dead. To not be able to stop looking at whatever's in front of you. \nINT. MEETING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nArctor sits on a folding chair in a semi-circle of residents and a staff member. He stares down at his hands. A portable blackboard is covered with scribbled words, such as \"Goals\", \"Responsibility\", and \"Community.\" A large coffee urn percolates in the corner, making a \"whoop-whoop\" sound. Arctor focuses on this sound, which frightens him. \nNEW-PATH RESIDENT #3 Living and unliving things are exchanging properties. \nAll murmer agreement except Arctor, who just looks down. \nNEW-PATH RESIDENT #4 That's because the drive of the unliving is stronger than the drive of the living. \nWhoop-Whoop.    The coffee urn gets progressively louder. \nNEW-PATH STAFFER So we are incorporating too much unliving drive within us. Now, activity does not necessarily mean life. Quasars are active, but not alive. A meditating monk is not dead. \nINT. DINING HALL - NIGHT \nThe room is filled with sad-looking people at collapsible tables eating dinner off trays. Arctor sits at a table by himself, and stares down at his steaming soup. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nA bunch of residents excitedly rifle through a cardboard box of donated clothing. Arctor stands back from the box and look at his feet. Mike, a short, stocky man with a pug face slips into a shirt that looks like an American flag. \nNEW-PATH RESIDENT #1 Hey, Mike, you're one sharp dude! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMIKE Thanks, man. \nMike fiddles with a belt with two metal rings for a buckle. He can't cinch it. \nMIKE (CONT'D) (cheerily) Oh, c'mon, you guys left me the belt nobody else could work! (to Arctor) You know how to do this, man? \nArctor reaches down and cinches the belt. \nMIKE (CONT'D) Hey, thanks, buddy! \nMike touches Arctor's shoulder.    Arctor glances at the hand. \nINT. MEETING ROOM - MORNING \nArctor sits in the center of the room. A circle of residents yell at him. A Chinese girl is more shrill than the others \n", "test3_true": "NEW-PATH RESIDENTS (chanting) Can you fuck yourself? Can you fuck yourself? \nThe Executive Director smiles from the circle. \nNEW-PATH RESIDENT #1 Let's see you fuck yourself! \nCHINESE GIRL RESIDENT The kissy-facy! \nAnother female resident flaps her arms and bulges her cheeks in Arctor's face. The Chinese girls swivels around and sticks her ass in Arctor's face. \nCHINESE GIRL RESIDENT (CONT'D) Kiss my ass, kissy-facy! He wants to kiss people, kiss this, kissy-facy! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nNEW-PATH RESIDENTS Let's see you fuck yourself, kissy- facy! \nArctor shuts his eyes, but still hears the screaming. The Executive Director clears his throat; the screaming subsides. \nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR You pimp. You fuck. You dong. You shit. You turd. You snot. You asshole. You vomit. You wart. \nWe shift to Arctor's POV, looking out at the group and hearing the Executive Director's chant. \nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (CONT'D) You bile. You worm. You maggot. You pus. You running sore. \nThe chanting continues, but the actual words become indecipherable. Mike's voice breaks the chant. \nMIKE (gently) Bruce? \nArctor looks at Mike's compassionate face. \nMIKE (CONT'D) Bruce, what's the matter? What brought you here? Can you tells us anything about yourself? Your past? \nNEW-PATH RESIDENT #2 Pimp!   What are you, pimp? \nCHINESE GIRL RESIDENT Tell us, you cock-sucking fairy whore pimp! You ass-kisser, you fuck! \nBOB ARCTOR I am an eye. I am dead. I can only look at what is front of me. \nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR You turd prick. You weakling. You puke. You suck-off. You snatch. \nThe Executive Director continues, but Arctor can't make out the words as he surveys the cold, hard faces of the group. Spade Weeks is among them. \nINT. NEW-PATH HALLWAY - DAY \nArctor walks down the hall, carrying his pail and mop. He passes an open door. Inside is a brightly lit room in which several children play. Arctor watches, transfixed. \nINT. DINING ROOM - EVENING \nThe children sit at a table in an alcove off the main dining area. Some of the smaller children sit in high chairs and are being fed by old men. Arctor watches from outside the alcove. Mike walks by. He smiles. \nMIKE You like kids, Bruce? \nBOB ARCTOR Yes. \nMIKE You can eat with them if you like. \nArctor nods and sits at the end of the table. \nMIKE (CONT'D) You can feed them in a month or two. After we're sure you won't hit them. \nBOB ARCTOR Okay. \nINT. DINING AREA - A BIT LATER \nThe table is mostly empty now. Only a couple of straggling children and Arctor remain. The two old men are beginning clean-up. One of the children goes, leaving only Arctor and a wide-eyed little girl. \nLITTLE GIRL What's your name? \nArctor doesn't respond. \nLITTLE GIRL (CONT'D) I said, what's your name? My name is Thelma. Did you forget your name? If you forget your name, you can write it on your hand. Want me to show you how? \nBOB ARCTOR Won't it wash off? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLITTLE GIRL Oh, I see. (thinking) Well, you could write on the ceiling above your bed. Then when you want to know your name better, you can -- \nBOB ARCTOR Thelma. \nLITTLE GIRL No, that's my name. And that's a girl's name anyway. If I see you again, I'll give you a name. I'll make one up for you. 'kay? \nBOB ARCTOR Don't you live here? \nLITTLE GIRL Yes, but my mommy may be leaving. She's thinking about taking us, me and my brother, and leaving. 'kay, Bye! \nShe runs off.    Arctor watches after the girl. \nBOB ARCTOR Bruce. \n"}

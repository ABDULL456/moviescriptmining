250 pounds of doughy attendant hit the floor like a sack of cement. Sarah slams the makeshift baton down expertly across the back of his head, bouncing him off the linoleum.  Lights out, Douglas. She drags him into her cell and locks him in with his own keys.  Then swaps her mop-handle for his nice heavy night-stick. 
65B     Sarah moves down the dark corridor, cat-stepping in her bare feet. She holds the baton like a pro, laid back along the forearm, police- style.  She looks dangerous. 
CUT TO: 
66      INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE/CORRIDOR 
A long corridor ends at a reception area, which is closed, and a NIGHT RECEIVING DESK, which is a glass window where they can buzz you in through a heavy door.  A NIGHT NURSE types at a desk nearby.  She looks up at the sound of footsteps and sees a young cop (T-1000) walking toward her. 
T-1000 You have a Sarah Connor here? 
She assumes he's with the other cops.  Smiles. 
NIGHT NURSE Running late, aren't you? 
She turns to the inner door to buzz him in and sees Silberman and the cops coming toward the door from the other side. 
NIGHT NURSE Your friends are on their way out now... 
When she turns back to the window, T-1000's no longer there.  She goes to the counter and leans out to see if he's at the drinking fountain or someplace.  No.  Reception is empty.  And so is the long corridor beyond.  She frowns.  Too weird. 
66A     Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and Weathersby, the two uniformed cops, and the hospital security guard. The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind the night desk.  Silberman faces him. 
SILBERMAN Lewis, see these gentleman out and them lock up for the night. 
The security guard nods.  Silberman goes back into the secure area of the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the main doors.  No sign of T-1000.  Mossberg and the other cops exit, and the guard locks the door behind them. 
66B     The guard walks slowly back along the long corridor.  The hall is dark, with the light at the night desk far ahead like a sanctuary. His footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor.  His keys jingle. 
66C     ANGLE ON FLOOR as the guard's feet pass through FRAME.  An instant later the floor starts to move. It shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass, still retaining the two-tone checkerboard of the tile.  It hunches up silently into a quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard. 
66D     Up ahead we hear typing.  The night nurse has her back to us, working. The guard stops as the drinking fountain.  Bends to take a sip. Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to resolve rapidly into a human figure.  It loses the color and texture of the tile and becomes... THE GUARD. 
T-1000's mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over several square yards of floor.  The guard walked over the T-1000, and his structure was sampled that instant.  Now we see it drawing in and pulling up to form the figure of the guard. 
The T-1000/Guard's feet are the last to form, the last of the "liquid floor" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes.  The shoes detach with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-1000/Guard takes its first step. 
66E     The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself. He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of that.  Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and, inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real guard's face, about a foot away.  In a split second, the finger spears out, elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a stiletto, slamming into the guard's eye. It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans- orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard's skull. 
Life quietly empties from the guard's face.  He is dead weight, hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK.  As the guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and walks him, like it's carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the night desk.  The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor. 
66F     ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past, dragging something casually which she can't see because it's below the countertop. 
NIGHT NURSE Whatcha got, Lewis? 
T-1000/GUARD Just some trash. 
She nods, uninterested.  Keeps typing.  T-1000 moves past, dragging the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night receiving station.  T-1000/Guard removes the Browning High-Power pistol and the keys from the real guard's belt, then stuffs the body into the utility closet. 
66G     INT. CORRIDOR/NIGHT RECEIVING DESK 
T-1000/Guard comes back out and glances at the nurse. 
T-1000/GUARD All set. 
She glances toward it.  Sees the Beretta in its holster. 
NIGHT NURSE Gotta check the gun first, Lewis. 
T-1000/GUARD Yeah, sorry. 
T-1000 opens the locker and blocks it from her view with its body as it mimes putting the gun in. 
66H     CLOSE ANGLE ON T-1000'S CHEST, from inside the locker.  Instead of setting the gun in the locker, it inserts the pistol into it own chest, where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of hot fudge.  It withdraws its hand.  The chest is once again a surface that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc.  You'd ever guess it was really an intelligent liquid metal. 
T-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK.  T-1000/Guard goes through. 
CUT TO: 
67      INT. ISOLATION SECURITY CHECKPOINT 
A small room before a short SALLY-PORT corridor designed to prevent violent inmates from making a run for it.  There are doors at each end.  The first one is barred like a jail-cell door, and the second is a steel fire door.  The attendants have a video monitor with which they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors. 
The two bored attendants barely notice the T-1000/Guard as it approaches.  Looks briefly at a chart next to the door, seeing SARAH CONNOR is in #19. 
67A     IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 passes a nurses' station which looks a cage, walled in by heavy metal mesh.  Silberman, leaning in the open doorway, is talking to an attendant in the cage.  He doesn't glance twice at Lewis the Guard passing by.

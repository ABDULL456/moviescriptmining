THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nFADE IN: \nMAIN TITLES BEGIN \nWrithing pools of light and dark, out of which emerge images from \"The Bride of Frankenstein,\" directed by James Whale. Elsa Lanchester, as the Monster's Bride, looks up, down, left, right, startled to be alive.  The Monster stares at her.  \"Friend?\" he asks, tenderly, desperately. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT (B & W) \nLightning splits the black-and-white sky, revealing a single shattered oak in a desolate landscape.  Below, a HUMAN SILHOUETTE stumbles through the darkness, the top of his head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with mud. \nSuddenly the storm fades.  Light creeps into the scene, and color, as we DISSOLVE TO: \nTHE PACIFIC OCEAN \nmelting into a hazy morning sky.  In a box canyon off the coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a makeshift village for beach bums. \nINT. TRAILER - DAY \nCLAYTON BOONE opens his eyes.  He is 26, handsome in a rough-hewn, Chet Baker-like way, with broad shoulders and a flattop haircut.  He grabs a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes, lights a bent cigarette. \nClay stands and walks bare-assed across the single tin room, his head almost touching the ceiling. \nEXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY \nClay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag that's set up behind his trailer. \nINT. TRAILER - DAY \nClay towels off, glances at the morning paper.  He moves aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a calendar.  His finger targets today's first appointment. \"10 A.M. - 788 Amalfi Drive.\" \nEXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY \nClay steps out of the trailer, clean-shaven and dressed in dungarees, a T-shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped into one sleeve.  He weight-lifts a secondhand mower onto the bed of his rusty pick-up. \nClay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the ignition.  It takes a few tries but the engine finally turns over. \nEXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY \nClay's truck sails down the road, \"Hound Dog\" blaring on the radio.  MAIN TITLES END. \nEXT. COLONIAL-STYLE HOUSE - DAY \nSprinklers twirl on a grassy slope outside a rambling clapboard house.  Below, a swimming pool forms a perfect rectangle of still water.  A title reads: SANTA MONICA CANYON.  1957. \nThe pick-up drives past.  Clay parks in the back, hops out. \nANGLE - HOUSE \nA SHADOWY FIGURE stands at a window, watching Clay unload his red power mower. \nINT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe shadow is a man with dove white hair, wearing a dress shirt and seersucker jacket.  This is JAMES WHALE, age 67. \nDAVID I'd have more peace of mind if the live-in nurse were still here. \nHANNA She was nothing but bother.  I not like her, Mr. Jimmy not like her. We do better if you live-in again, Mr. David. \nIn the dining room, visible through open double doors, DAVID LEWIS, 55, speaks softly with the housekeeper, HANNA.  She is a squat, muffin-faced Hungarian woman in her late 50s, dressed in black, her hair cinched in a tight bun.  She speaks with a thick accent. \nDAVID You'll contact me if there's an emergency? \nHANNA Yes, I call you at this number. (calls out) Mr. Jimmy?  More coffee? \nWHALE What?  Oh yes.  Why not? \nHe moves into the dining room, sits opposite David. \n", "test1_true": "Hanna ignores him, returns to the kitchen. \nDAVID She tells me you haven't been sleeping well. \nWHALE It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once -- \nDAVID Then take the pills. \nWHALE I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital. \nThe remark hits its target. \nDAVID I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars -- \nWHALE \"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars.\" \nDAVID (too anxious to laugh) You remember how a production eats up one's life. \nWHALE Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty. (stands) You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane. \nDavid extends his hand, but Whale draws him into a hug.  As he starts out, David points to a framed painting. \nDAVID By the way, I like the Renoir. \nWHALE Thank you. \nDAVID (calls out) Goodbye, Hanna. \nHanna runs out of the kitchen to escort David to the door. Whale drifts back to the window, watches as Clay revs up the lawnmower, creating a cloud of white smoke.  We CUT TO: \nEXT. STREETS OF DUDLEY - DAY (1900) \nA bean-pole child with flaming red hair (WHALE at age 12) stares up at the coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless row of chimneys.  We're in Dudley, a factory town in the English Midlands region known as the Black Country. \nSARAH WHALE (O.S.) Stop lagging behind, Jimmy.  We'll be late for church. \nYOUNG WHALE Yes, Mum. \nWhale runs to catch up to his six brothers and sisters.  His father, WILLIAM WHALE, frowns at the boy's prissy trot. \nWILLIAM WHALE Straighten up, son. \nYoung Whale's movements thicken into a dim imitation of manly reserve.  The Whale family marches up a steeply mounting street to Dixon's Green Methodist Church. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWhale's eyes tighten.  He focuses on Clay Boone as he peels off his T-shirt, revealing a tattoo on his upper right forearm. \nWHALE Hanna?  Who's the new yardman? \nHANNA Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap. \nWhale nods, chooses a walking stick.  He emerges into the sunlight. \nEXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY \nWhale moves jauntily onto the front lawn, singing to himself: \nWHALE The bells of hell go ting-a-ling For you but not for me. Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory? \nWhale steps up next to Clay. \nWHALE Good morning. \nCLAY (not looking up) Mornin'. \nWHALE My name is Whale.  This is my house. \nCLAY Nice place. \nWHALE And your name is --? \nCLAY Boone.  Clayton Boone. \nWHALE I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean? \nCLAY Just that I was in the Marines. \nWHALE The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea. \nClay shrugs nonchalantly. \nWHALE Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it. \n", "test1_id": 2943, "test2_input": "WHALE Of course. \nELSA LANCHESTER What's our pesky friend up to now? \nKay returns, accompanied by a stopped, gray-haired man with a long rectangular face and wary, heavy-lidded eyes. \nELSA LANCHESTER Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion. \nWHALE Oh dear. \nKarloff, age 70, comes reluctantly, followed by his niece ALICE, a bashful young woman who carried a blanket-wrapped bundle. \nELSA LANCHESTER Boris, darling.  I didn't know you were here.  These public revels are hardly up your alley. \nBORIS KARLOFF I came for the sake of my visiting niece.  Alice.  And Miranda, my great-niece. \nHis huge hand lifts the blanket in Alice's arms, revealing a bald infant with enormous blue eyes.  Karloff gurgles and coos at the child. \nELSA LANCHESTER And what do you make of our royal visitant? \nBORIS KARLOFF Perfectly charming.  A real lady. \nELSA LANCHESTER Of course she's a lady.  What did you expect?  A hussy in tennis shoes? \nWhale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind Karloff.  He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are listening intently to the monocled British consul. \nWhale's eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together, his once and future monsters.  Kay shouts to a passing photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic. \nKAY Hey, you!  With the camera!  We got a historical moment here.  Come get a picture of it. \nThe man scans the scene for a famous face. \nKAY This is Mr. James Whale, who made \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein.\"  and this is the Monster and his Bride. \nClay looks up when he hears Kay identify Karloff. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Oh, Karloff.  Right. \nKarloff and Elsa drift into position next to Whale.  The flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light.  Whale cringes in pain. \nELSA LANCHESTER (through clenched teeth) Don't you just love being famous? \nAnother flash.  From Whale's perspective, the bulb resembles nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical current from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.  Whale concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his brain.  He clutches Elsa Lanchester's hand. \nELSA LANCHESTER Are you all right, Jimmy? \nA sharp nod from Whale.  The photographer motions to Karloff's niece. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Let me get one with Frankenstein holding the kid. \nAlice hands over the baby.  Karloff gently cradles the child.  Whale stands on his left, Elsa on his right.  They all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up.  Whale follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks and strains in a furious electrical storm. \nThe camera flashes once, then again. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Got it! \nWhale glances up -- the kite is gone.  Thunder rumbles as the group starts to disperse.  Whale nods to the faces exchanging good-byes. \nBORIS KARLOFF So good to see you again, James. \nHe strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby. \nKAY Catch you before you go, Mr. Whale. I'll make sure everybody gets sent a print. \nHe goes off with the photographer.  Elsa kisses Whale on the cheek. \nELSA LANCHESTER We'll be in touch, Jimmy. \nWHALE Good-bye.  So nice to see you... \nFinally Whale is alone.  He staggers to the deck chair and lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair. \nCLAY You okay? \nWhale gazes up at Clay. \nWHALE Tired.  A bit tired. \nClay nods.  Whale smiles at him. \nWHALE Are you enjoying yourself? \nCLAY Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place. \n", "test2_true": "CLAY Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again. \nWHALE Monsters?  The only monsters... (closes his eyes) ...are here. \nAcross the lawn, conversation has stopped.  Birdlike shrieks come from all directions. \nCLAY Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it? \nWHALE Run for what? \nCLAY Can't you see?  It's raining! \nThe rain is only a flickering of air, but people are jumping and shrieking, throwing coats over their heads as they dash toward the house. \nCLAY Here. \nHe takes Whale under the arm, helps him up and escorts him to a small tent.  On the patio, everyone shoves and squeezes to get through the one open door. \nWhale stares out, hypnotized by the deluge.  From his POV, we see a young man step into the rain.  Whale squints, is finally able to identify the man as Leonard Barnett. \nWhale's eyes follow Barnett as he emerges onto a new landscape, a scarred and barren battlefield.  As the storm continues to rage: \nCLAY (O.S.) Mr. Whale? \nWhale shifts his gaze to Clay.  He takes a moment to orient himself. \nWHALE Let's get out of this funk hole \nCLAY You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon. \nWHALE We're not sugar.  We won't melt. \nWhale adjusts the brim of his hat and steps into the downpour.  Clay has no choice except to follow.  They walk briskly, the minute splashes on Whale's hat forming a ghostly aura of spray. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nWhale opens the door and climbs in next to Clay.  The roof slowly closes over them. \nCLAY I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia. \nWHALE Catch my death. \nClay glances over, sees Whale sitting very wet and rigid, staring straight ahead. \nCLAY You all right, Mr. Whale? \nWhale blinks, slowly turns.  There is a cracked look in his eyes. \nWHALE Jimmy.  Please.  Call me Jimmy. \nClay smiles, starts to back the car out. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - FOYER - DUSK \nThe hallway is pitch-dark as Whale and Clay enter. \nWHALE Hanna!  Bring us some towels. We're drenched to the bone! \nNo response. \nWHALE Blast her.  If we soil her holy floor, it's her own damn fault. \nWhale goes squashing down the hall.  Clay remains just inside the open door, prying off his shoes and peeling off his socks.  He follows Whale into: \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK \nWhale stands over the table with his jaw open. \nWHALE I don't believe this. \nHe slides a note to Clay. \nWHALE It's not like her. \nCLAY (reading) Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter. \nWHALE Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man? \nCLAY Good.  Let's get dry. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWhale stands just inside the closet, buttoning a crisp white shirt.  He reaches for a red bow tie, closes the closet door.  In the mirror, Leonard Barnett stands behind him, in uniform.  Whale's eyes twinkle in surprise.  He drapes the tie around his collar. \n", "test2_id": 2944, "test3_input": "She scoldingly cuts her eyes at Clay. \nHANNA Ten?  Very good, then.  Good-bye. \nShe hangs up and faces Clay with a stern frown. \nCLAY It's not what you think. \nHANNA I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast. \nCLAY I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale. \nHANNA There is nothing you can say that will surprise me. \nCLAY Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go? \nHANNA I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke. \nShe stomps into the kitchen.  Clay gets up, slips on his undershorts.  He's zipping up his chinos when she comes out again with a breakfast tray.  She hands him a cup of coffee. \nCLAY Thanks. (quickly) Why do you do it? \nHANNA What do I do? \nCLAY Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood. \nHANNA It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill. (picks up the tray) Enough talk.  I must wake up the master. \nShe marches around the corner towards Whale's bedroom.  Clay hears her knocking on a door. \nHANNA (O.S.) Mr. Jimmy?  Morning, Mr. Jimmy. \nClay pulls on his shirt.  Hanna comes back around the corner. \nHANNA What have you done with him? \nCLAY I put him to bed.  He's not there? \nShe goes to the foot of the stairs and shouts: \nHANNA Mr. Jimmy!  Mr. Jimmy! \nHanna starts up the stairs. \nHANNA Look for him! \nClay reaches for his socks when he notices an envelope on the floor next to the chair.  He picks it up.  On the front is scrawled the word 'CLAYTON'.  Clay opens the envelope. Inside is Whale's original sketch of the Monster's head.  He turns it over.  There is a message written on the back. \nCLAY No. \nClay drops the sketch, looks out.  He sees something. \nEXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY \nClay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope. \nEXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - POOL - DAY \nClay leaps headfirst into the water.  Whale rests lightly on his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair.  Clay hauls the body toward the side. \nCLAY Almost there.  Almost there. \nHe gets an arm around Whale's chest and heaves the body over the curb.  he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in the grass.  He grabs the wrist.  Nothing. \nCLAY Son of a bitch.  You crazy son of a bitch. \nClay straddles Whale's thighs and applies pressure on his rib cage.  But it's no use.  Clay sits up and takes a deep breath. \nHANNA Ohhh! \nHanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk.  She stares at Clay. \nCLAY I didn't do it.  This wasn't me. \nHANNA Oh, Mr. Jimmy. \nCLAY He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself. \nHANNA He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life. \nShe waves a folded piece of paper. \nHANNA You poor, foolish man.  You couldn't wait for God to take you in his time? \n", "test3_true": "HANNA You must leave.  You were not here this morning. \nCLAY But I didn't do this! \nHANNA The police will not know that. They will want to investigate. \nCLAY We have his note. \nHANNA Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone. \nCLAY But how're you going to explain this? (points at the body) How did you get him out of the pool? \nHANNA You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back. \nThey both hesitate, looking down at Whale.  Then Clay drags the body parallel with the pool.  Hanna stoops over to adjust the collar of Whale's shirt. \nHANNA Poor Mr. Jimmy.  We do not mean disrespect.  You will keep better in water. \nShe nods to Clay.  He rolls the body over and it splashes on its belly.  It bounces a moment in the waves of the splash, then begins to sink.  As it drops, the air in the chest slowly flips the body around. \nLooking up at them with open eyes, Whale sinks backward into the thickening light.  His arms trail upward and the hands lightly flutter as if waving good-bye.  The melancholy sound of a solo violin pierces the silence as we CUT TO: \nEXT./INT. BLIND MAN'S HUT - NIGHT \nA black-and-white scene from \"Bride of Frankenstein.\"  The old BLIND MAN plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while the MONSTER listens outside, moved by the music.  He smashes open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the soul-soothing sound.  The blind man stops playing, looks up. \nBLIND MAN Who is it?  You're welcome, my friend, whoever you are. \nThe Monster attempts to communicate, manages only a plaintive moan.  The blind man stands. \nBLIND MAN I cannot see you.  I cannot see anything.  You must please excuse me.  But I am blind. \nThe Monster holds out his burned hands. \nBLIND MAN Come in, my poor friend.  No one will hurt you here.  If you're in trouble, perhaps I can help you. \nThe old man touches the Monster, who recoils with a defensive growl. \nBLIND MAN Can you not speak?  It's strange. Perhaps you're afflicted too.  I cannot see and you cannot speak. \nINT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT (1972) \nMICHAEL BOONE, 10, lies on the living room carpet, staring raptly at the movie playing on the large Zenith console. The house is small but tidy and comfortable. \nBLIND MAN (O.S.) It's been a long time since any human being came into this hut.  I shall look after you.  And you will comfort me. \nOn the tv screen, the old man starts to cry, then collapses onto the Monster's chest.  A thick tear rolls down the Monster's cheek. \nClay Boone sits on the sofa, a baby on his lap.  He's 40 now, his hair starting to thin but still closely cropped at the top and sides. \nOn the tv, daylight fills the hut.  The blind man and the Monster share a meal. \nBLIND MAN We are friends, you and I. Friends. \nMONSTER Friends. \nBLIND MAN Before you came, I was all alone. It is bad to be alone. \nMONSTER Alone, bad.  Friend, good. \nHe takes the old man's hand. \nMONSTER Friend, good. \nThe blind man nods.  On the sofa, Clay watches his son watch the movie. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) \nA color promo for \"Chiller Theater\" fills the screen.  Clay turns off the set. \nCLAY Time for bed, sport. \nMichael groans, slowly stands. \nCLAY What'd you think of the movie? \nMICHAEL Pretty cool.  Better than most monster movies. \nCLAY I knew the guy who made it. \nMichael glances skeptically at his father. \nMICHAEL Come on, Dad.  Is this another one of your stories? \n", "test3_id": 2945}

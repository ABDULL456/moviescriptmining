{"train": "CLAY Yeah.  I better get on with my work. \nWhale clears his throat behind the back of his hand. \nWHALE When you're through, Mr. Boone, feel free to make use of the pool. We're quite informal here.  You don't have to worry about a suit. \nClay glances warily at Whale. \nCLAY No thanks.  I got another job to get to this afternoon. \nWhale holds Clay's look. \nWHALE Some other time, perhaps?  Keep up the fine work. \nWhale heads off, smiling to himself.  Pleased to be naughty again. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY \nThe room is filled with unframed canvasses, many of them copies of paintings by the Old Masters. \nWhale rolls out the easel, lifts a half-painted canvas into position.  He stares at the blotches of color, trying to remember what he intended to paint. \nWhale pulls out a heavy volume on Rembrandt, opens to a black-and-white plate of \"The Polish Rider.\"  We CUT TO: \nINT. WHALE HOUSE - DUDLEY - NIGHT (1908) \nA rough pencil outline of the same painting.  Whale, age 16, sits on his bed, ignoring the roughhousing of the three younger BROTHERS who share the room.  The door opens and Whale's mother SARAH enters. \nSARAH WHALE Jimmy.  The privy needs cleaning. \nWHALE I have my class tonight. \nBoth have Midlands accents, like head colds that flatten their speech.  Whale holds up the sketch to show his mother. \nSARAH WHALE Don't get above yarself, Jimmy. Leave the drawring to the artists. \nWhale squeezes the pad behind the bed, jumps up. \nWHALE Quite so, mum.  To the privy. \nAnd he heads cheerfully out of the room.  His mother shakes her head. \nSARAH WHALE \"Quite so.\" (calls out) Jimmy Whale.  Who are ya to put on airs? \nBut Whale is already out the door.  We CUT TO: \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY \nWhale studies his face in the mirror.  He gives his white hair a few final licks with his silver-backed brush. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nWhale comes in from the bedroom. \nWHALE There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches? \nHANNA Yes, Mr. Jimmy. (smiles) An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting. \nWHALE Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university. \nThe doorbell rings. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWhale settles into his club chair and opens a book, pretending to read until Hanna ushers in the visitor. \nHANNA Mr. Kay, sir. \nWHALE (feigning surprise) Yes? \nWhale looks up at EDMUND KAY, 22, a slim boy who rests his weight on one slouched hip, his arms twined behind him. There is a look of mild disappointment on Whale's face as he realizes that Kay is a baby poof. \nWHALE Ah, Mr. Kay.  I'd almost forgotten. My guest for tea. \nWhale stands and holds out his hand. \nKAY Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you. \nWHALE (gently, teasing) No.  I expect you can't. \nKAY And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein. (looks around) I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa. \nWHALE One likes to live simply. \nWHALE You can go now. \nShe makes an audible sigh and starts back up the hill. \nWHALE There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called \"Journey's End\".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  \"Journey's End\" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned. \nKAY How much longer before we get to \"Frankenstein\"? \nWHALE Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures? \nKAY Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all -- \nWHALE Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses. \nKAY But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for. \nAn abrupt look of anger flashes across Whale's face. \nWHALE I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay. \nKAY No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon. \nKay leans over the steno pad, determined to be more worthy. \nKAY So.  \"Journey's End\" brought you to Hollywood -- \nWhale takes in the boy's blank, bored expression.  He sighs. \nWHALE I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think? \nKAY I don't mind. \nWHALE Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing. \nKay's mouth pops open. \nKAY That's funny, Mr. Whale. \nWHALE It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play? \nKAY You're serious. \nWHALE Quite. \nKAY Then the rumors are true? \nWHALE What rumors might those be? \nKAY That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal. \nWHALE A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks. \nKay just sits there, squinting and grinning. \nKAY You're a dirty old man. \nWhale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment.  Kay kicks off his penny loafers, bends over to remove his socks. \nWHALE You are kind to indulge your elders in their vices.  As I indulge the young in theirs. \nTwo pale feet emerge.  Whale leans forward to examine them. He leans back again. \nWHALE No.  There was no scandal. \nAnd he reaches into his coat for a cigar.  Whale's hand trembles as he slices a hole at the base, then lights the cigar with a wooden match, sucking and rotating until the tip is roundly lit. \nWHALE My only other vice.  I suppose you'd like a fuller answer to your question. \nKay nods. \nWHALE It will cost you your sweater. \nKay hesitates a moment, then sets his pen aside to pull the sweater over his head, revealing a sleeveless T-shirt. \nKAY Too warm for a sweater, anyway. \nWHALE You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica? \nKay stares at him in disbelief. \nKAY George Cukor?  Who made \"A Star Is Born\"?  I never guessed. \nWHALE Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story. \nShe goes to Whale, scooping different bottles from the pocket of her apron. \nHANNA Which ones?  I bring them all. \nWHALE Luminal. \nShe empties a pill into her palm.  Whale places it into his mouth and takes the glass of Water Kay passes over Hanna's shoulder.  Whale swallows the pill, then glances up at Kay, feigning surprise. \nWHALE Mr. Kay.  You're not dressed. \nKay frantically crosses his arms over his chest and middle, turns to Hanna. \nKAY I was going to take a swim. \nWHALE I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home. \nKAY Right. \nKay hurries outside to retrieve his clothes.  Hanna undoes Whale's bow tie.  She makes no attempt to be gentle. \nWHALE You must think I'm terrible, Hanna. \nHANNA I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys. \nWHALE Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him. \nHANNA Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold. \nWHALE No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you. \nHanna nods, moves to the door.  Whale closes his eyes, breathes deeply, trying to block the throbbing SOUND in his brain.  We CUT TO: \nINT. FACTORY SHOP FLOOR - DUDLEY - DAY (1908) \nThe noise is deafening -- the clank of chains, the screech of wheels and the endless banging of hammers.  William Whale continues to knock away at the hot casting.  The rhythmic sound blends into the insistent knocking of: \nA FIST \nwhich smashes against sheet metal. \nINT. CLAY'S TRAILER - DAY \nClay Boone's eyes dart open. \nDWIGHT (O.S.) Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock. \nCLAY Fuck off! \nDWIGHT (O.S.) You told me to get you up, asshole. \nA baseball-capped head is visible through the louvered glass in the trailer's door.  DWIGHT JOAD, 30, Clay's neighbor, squints to see inside. \nCLAY I'm up.  Thanks. \nDWIGHT Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me. \nClay glances over, seems surprised to see a naked back facing him on the bare mattress. \nCLAY Hey, um...Rose -- \nThe girl stirs, turns to face him.  She is 18 at most. \nDAISY Daisy. \nCLAY Huh? \nDAISY My name is Daisy. \nCLAY Time to go, Daisy. \nShe presses her naked body against Clay's. \nDAISY You know.  I could help you fix up this place real nice. \nClay takes a deep breath, trying to clear the gumminess from his brain. \nCLAY Don't you have to be somewhere? Like high school maybe. \nDAISY I gave it up for Lent. \nDaisy smiles at her own joke.  Clay frowns. \nCLAY Right. (jumps up from the bed) Time to hit the road, kid. \nWHALE My mind's lovely.  And yours? \nHanna flares her nostrils at him. \nHANNA You remember what the doctor tells us. \nWHALE Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard. \nHANNA I am not forgetting your last brief chat. \nWHALE Just go.  We can manage without you. \nHanna stares up at Clay. \nHANNA He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey. \nWHALE Go. \nShe shakes her head and marches out the door.  Clay returns to his chair and sits down again. \nWHALE When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you. (smiles at Clay) Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself. \nCLAY What did she mean by going flooey? \nWHALE I returned recently from a stay in hospital. \nCLAY What was wrong? \nWHALE Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke. \nClay nods, chugs his tea.  When he lowers the glass, he finds the old man watching him. \nWHALE You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head. \nCLAY Huh? \nWHALE To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled? \nCLAY You mean, like posed for pictures? \nWHALE Sat for an artist.  Been sketched. \nCLAY (with a laugh) What's to sketch? \nWHALE You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive. \nCLAY Broke is more like it. \nWHALE But expressively broken.  How did it happen? \nCLAY Football in college. \nWHALE You went to university? \nCLAY Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines. \nWHALE Yes.  You were a Marine. \nWhale's gaze deepens.  He laughs lightly. \nWHALE I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone. \nCLAY You mean -- you really want to draw me? \nWHALE Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head. \nCLAY But why? \nWHALE Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him. \nCLAY And it's just my head you want? Nothing else? \nWHALE What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder. \nCLAY You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right? \nWHALE I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that. \nClay takes a moment to size up Whale -- whose innocent, slightly befuddled smile makes him appear about as threatening as a box of cornflakes. \nCLAY All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough. \nWHALE Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time. \nClay opens the squeaking door and enters behind Hanna. Whale stands at a drafting table, sharpening a pencil. Hanna sets the tray down. \nWHALE Very good, Hanna.  Now goodbye. \nShe goes toward the door, wrinkling her forehead at Clay. The screen door bangs shut. \nWHALE I'm sure you'd like something to wet your whistle while I work. \nWhale opens a bottle of beer, pours it into a glass, hands it to Clay.  He gestures to a chair. \nWHALE We'll go slowly today.  Since this is your first time as a model. \nClay sits.  He pulls a \"TV Guide\" out of his back pocket. \nCLAY Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night. \nWHALE You don't say?  Which picture? \nCLAY \"Bride of Frankenstein.\" \nWHALE Hmmm.  I much prefer \"Show Boat\" or \"The Invisible Man.\"  Shall we begin? \nClay takes a swig of beer and sets the glass on the floor. \nCLAY Ready when you are. \nWhale stares at Clay. \nWHALE That shirt, Mr. Boone. \nCLAY It's new. \nWHALE I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off? \nCLAY I'm not wearing an undershirt. \nWHALE Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly. \nCLAY But it's just my face you want to draw. \nWHALE Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable... (sighs) Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear. \nHe lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker, revealing a stack of \"Physique\" magazines.  Whale casually covers them with a newspaper. \nWHALE We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness? \nCLAY All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway. \nHe unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off. \nWHALE Yes.  Much better. (steps forward) Here. \nClay adjusts his belt buckle as Whale hangs the shirt on a wall peg.  He moves back to the easel again. \nWHALE I think we'll have you sit slightly sideways, so you can rest one arm on the back of the chair.  Yes. Just so. \nThe arm with the tattoo faces the easel.  Clay smirks. \nCLAY Take a picture, it lasts longer. \nWHALE That's exactly what I intend to do. \nA clatter of pencils in the easel's tray, followed by a moment of silence.  Finally, a low, whistly scratch.  Clay concentrates on keeping still, focusing on an open window. \nWHALE You seem to have no idea how handsome you are, Mr. Boone.  It has to do with how snugly your face fits your skull. \nClay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist. \nWHALE Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks. \nCLAY No.  I'm fine. \nWHALE It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you. \nWhale suddenly sniffs, as if smelling something.  He sniffs several times more but continues to draw. \nWHALE (to himself) Dripping? (to Clay) Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread. \nCLAY Sounds like something you feed the dog. \nWHALE It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar. \nCLAY Your family ate dripping? \nCLAY This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times. \nDWIGHT Ooooh. \nBetty glares at Clay, who realizes he's gone too far. \nBETTY I bet this is just some fruit pretending to be famous.  So he can get in the big guy's pants. \nDWIGHT Ooooh. \nCLAY What makes you say that? \nBETTY Just thinking out loud. \nCLAY Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself. \nBETTY All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are. \nCLAY Fuck you. \nBETTY Not anymore you don't.  Doll. \nCLAY (explodes) We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie. \nHARRY Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it. \nCLAY Good.  Fine. \nHarry reaches up, turns on a battered Motorola.  On the tv, a voice announces: \"Tonight, Boris Karloff in 'The Bride of Frankenstein.'\"  The titles come on.  Ending with the phrase \"Directed by\", which floats over a white blob.  The blob jumps forward to form letters: \"James Whale.\" \nCLAY Right there.  What did I tell you? James Whale. \nThe movie starts.  The Monster being roasted alive in the flaming wreckage of a mill. \nBETTY This looks corny. \nCLAY Go wash glasses if you don't like it. \nIn a flooded crater under the mill, the Monster kills an old man.  He climbs up, flips the man's wife into the pit below. An owl blinks impassively. \nDWIGHT Not bad.  Two down and it's just started. \nMinnie, a hatchet-faced woman with fluttering ribbons, is now alone with the Monster. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWhale and Hanna are in bathrobes and slippers, and there is a glass of milk and a plate of cookies on Whale's TV tray. On the tv, Minnie (played by UNA O'CONNOR) squeaks and whimpers and screams.  Whale laughs. \nWHALE Wonderful old Una.  Gobbling like an old turkey hen. \nBut Hanna isn't amused.  She unclenches her arms to close the bathrobe over her throat. \nHANNA Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him? \nWHALE Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable. \nMinnie flees in a bowlegged jig up the hill.  Whale smiles again. \nINT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT \nOn the tv, Dr. Pretorius (played by Ernest Thesiger) delivers a toast with inimitably ripe enunciation: \"To a new world of gods and monsters!\"  Dwight and Harry and Betty all laugh. \nBETTY These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny. \nCLAY (defensively) Maybe it's supposed to be funny. \nBETTY Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them. \nSuddenly the tinny tv soundtrack is drowned out by the voice of Elvis Presley.  Kid Saylor bends over the jukebox, wagging his denim butt and tapping a high-top sneaker. \nCLAY Hey!  Some of us are watching a movie! \nSAYLOR Go ahead.  Free country. \nClay jumps from his stool.  Saylor sees him coming, steps aside. \nSAYLOR You want me to turn it down? \nClay slams the heel of his hand against Saylor's chest.  The boy staggers backward.  Clay grabs the corner of the jukebox and jerks it from the wall; the needle scratches across the song.  Saylor holds up both hands in a nervous surrender. \nSAYLOR Hey, I didn't know.  It's your favorite movie.  Sorry, okay? \nClay returns to the bar and uprights the stool.  Saylor escorts his girl to the door. \nHARRY I'm next door if you need me. \nHe gives Clay one last look and goes out to the breezeway and his apartment. \nCLAY You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous. \nBETTY (laughs) What's to be jealous of? \nCLAY I've gotten to know someone who's famous. \nBETTY Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him. \nCLAY If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like my famous person. (laughs at himself) Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to. \nClay leans down to plug in the jukebox. \nCLAY You want to go for a swim? \nShe snaps her mouth open and imitates the Bride's furious cat hiss. \nCLAY What's that mean? \nBETTY It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water. \nCLAY I wasn't going to try anything. \nBETTY Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette. \nHe patiently waits by the door while Betty turns out the lights.  She walks briskly through the glow of the jukebox, waving Clay outside with her hand. \nEXT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT \nBetty pulls the door shut and bends over to lock it.  Clay catches a glimpse of skin in the side slit of her shirttail. \nCLAY Let's go for a walk at least.  Walk and talk.  I really feel like talking tonight. \nBetty's eyes blink in mock surprise. \nCLAY This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life. \nBETTY Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me? \nCLAY It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo. \nBETTY It never crossed your mind? \nCLAY He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex. \nBETTY All the old men I know think about nothing but sex. \nShe opens the door of her Chevy.  Clay grabs it with both hands to keep her from getting in. \nCLAY C'mon.  What's eating you tonight? \nBetty hesitates, then looks him sharply in the eye. \nBETTY You picked up that girl right in front of me. \nCLAY Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other. \nBETTY It still hurt.  A lot. \nCLAY I didn't mean to... \nBETTY No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you. \nCLAY You liked it too. \nBETTY Sure.  I loved it. \nCLAY If you enjoy it, you should do it. \nBETTY You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again -- \nCLAY You mean us? \nBetty bursts out laughing. \nBETTY The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid. \nCLAY I'm not a kid. \nBETTY What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer? \nClay prunes the roses on the front lawn.  Hanna appears, frowning. \nCLAY Something I can do for you? \nHANNA The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask. \nCLAY Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then. \nHANNA Expect nothing fancy. \nHanna goes inside.  Clay rolls the mower down the path. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nClay knocks on the bottom of the Dutch door as he lifts the latch and walks in.  He is wearing a fresh madras shirt. \nHANNA The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea. \nCLAY Tea is fine. \nHe sits at the kitchen table. \nHANNA No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room. \nCLAY That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it? \nShe eyes him suspiciously, shrugs, pours a glass of tea. Clay notices a Bible on the counter. \nCLAY How long you worked for Mr. Whale? \nHANNA Long enough.  Fifteen years. \nCLAY I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars? \nHANNA No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone? \nCLAY You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri. \nHANNA Your wife? \nCLAY I'm not married. \nHANNA Why? \nCLAY Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me? \nHANNA A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman. \nCLAY You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you? \nHanna twists her head around with such an indignant look that Clay bursts out laughing.  She realizes that she is being teased. \nHANNA Men.  Always pulling legs. Everything is comedy. (mimics an English accent) \"How very amusing.  How marvelously droll.\" \nHanna stares at Clay until his smile fades.  She resumes her chopping in silence. \nCLAY You ever been married, Hanna? \nHANNA Of course.  I am married still. \nCLAY Yeah?  What's your husband do? \nHANNA He is dead now, twenty years. \nCLAY Then you're as single as I am. \nHANNA No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much. (sighs) Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad. \nCLAY You're sure of that? \nHANNA This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven. \nCLAY Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those. \nHANNA No.  His is the worse. (worse) The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame? \nShe loses patience with Clay's blank look. \nHANNA What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other. \nCLAY A homo? \nHANNA Yes!  You know? \nWHALE Did anyone laugh? \nCLAY (covering) No. \nWHALE Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays. \nCLAY Why?  Was it supposed to be funny? \nWHALE Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke. (a sip of wine) But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood. \nWhale gazes pointedly at Clay, who eats with his elbows on the table, quickly bolting the hot omelette. \nWHALE In Korea, Mr. Boone? \nClay looks up. \nWHALE Did you kill anyone? \nCLAY I don't like to talk about that. \nWHALE It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of. \nCLAY Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone. \nWHALE Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand? \nCLAY (defensive) No.  I could have, though. \nWHALE Yes, I believe you could. (a sip of wine) How free is your schedule this afternoon? \nCLAY Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega. \nWHALE What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me? \nCLAY Can't today. \nWHALE I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges. \nCLAY Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today. \nWHALE All righty.  I understand. \nWhale tilts a scrutinizing eye at Clay. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - PANTRY - DAY (LATER) \nHanna carries the dirty dishes back to the kitchen. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY \nClay starts to bite the tip off a cigar. \nWHALE Use this. \nWhale passes him a gold penknife. \nWHALE Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today. \nCLAY You ever been married, Mr. Whale? \nWHALE No.  At least not in the legal sense. \nClay hands a clipped cigar back to Whale. \nCLAY So you had a wife? \nWHALE Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years. \nThe other cigar crunches faintly between Clay's fingers. \nWHALE Does that surprise you? \nCLAY No, I -- you're a homosexual. \nWHALE Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name. \nCLAY I'm not, you know. \nWHALE I never thought you were. \nCLAY You don't think of me that way, do you? \nWHALE What way might that be? \nCLAY What happened? \nWHALE The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed. \nA shadow passes over Whale's eyes.  He presses two fingers against his temple. \nWHALE After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business? \nCLAY Do you miss it? \nWHALE (dismissive) It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years -- \nWhale stops himself.  He smiles gently at Clay. \nWHALE Making movies was the most wonderful thing in the world. Working with friends. Entertaining people.  Yes, I suppose I miss it.  More so now that -- \nWhale reaches into his pocket, takes out the bottle of Luminal. \nWHALE I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work. \nCLAY You've done a helluva lot more than most people. \nWHALE Better work. \nWhale moves across the room to the screen door. \nWHALE But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely \"the friend.\"  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer. \nCLAY How long were you...? \nWHALE Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show. \nWhale places a pill on his tongue and swallows.  He fixes Clay with a pinched smile. \nWHALE When all fetters are loosened, a certain hedonism creeps in, don't you think?  There was a period when this house was overrun with young men.  Some even posed for me. Right where you're sitting now. \nClay sits uncomfortably in his chair.  His face flushes. \nWHALE Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks -- \nCLAY Cut it out! \nClay explodes out of his chair, knocking over a small side table. \nCLAY Fuck it.  I can't do this anymore. \nHe looms over Whale, whose breathing starts to quicken. \nCLAY Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it? \nWHALE I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no -- \nCLAY From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand? \nBefore Whale can respond Clay storms out, nearly ripping the screen door off its hinges.  Whale sits on the daybed, takes a few quick breaths.  Suddenly the air is filled with the sounds of people cavorting in the pool. \nWhale looks up, sees a young man standing outside the screen door.  It is now dark outside. \nYOUNG MAN Come on, Jimmy.  Watch me dive. \nWhale offers a melancholy smile. \nWHALE I think I'll just rest for a moment. \nThe man shrugs, disappears into the shadows.  We move across the room and through the door... \nEXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWhale sits in a director's chair, a martini in one hand, a cigar in the other, a harmless old uncle watching young men swagger and splash in the pool. \nWHALE I think we're ready to go. \nHe glances over, sees Clay in plaid bathing trunks, sitting apart from the others.  He is puffing on a Camel. \nWHALE You're up, Mr. Boone. \nClay ignores him.  Whale puts down his martini and cigar, picks up a Polaroid camera.  He moves over to clay. \nWHALE The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool? \nCLAY You first. \nWHALE Oh no.  I never swim. \nHANNA A visitor. \nWhale turns.  His face registers surprise when he sees Clay. \nWHALE Thank you, Hanna.  That will be all. \nHanna retreats toward the kitchen.  Clay steps tentatively into the room. \nWHALE Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday. \nCLAY I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay? \nWhale holds up two fingers, affects an American accent. \nWHALE Scout's honor. \nClay smiles. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY \nWhale and Boone are back in their familiar positions.  An empty glass of beer sits on the floor next to Clay. \nWHALE I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back? \nCLAY I don't know.  I guess I like your stories. \nWHALE Everybody has stories to tell. \nCLAY Not me. \nWHALE What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes. \nCLAY I told you.  I don't like to talk about that. \nWhale nods, sensing that he's touched a sore spot. \nWHALE And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that? \nCLAY Not fear.  More like disgust. \nWHALE Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion? \nCLAY There's no people like you in my crowd. \nWHALE No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea? \nCLAY You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't. \nWHALE Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers. \nCLAY You're talking through your hat now. \nWHALE Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself. \nCLAY You were a soldier? \nWHALE I was an officer. \nClay breaks his pose to turn and look at Whale. \nCLAY This was World War I? \nWHALE No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had -- \nWhale clears his throat, bored by his standard line. \nWHALE -- a war without end.  There were trenches when I arrived, and trenches when I left, two years later.  Just like in the movies. Only the movies never get the stench of them.  The world reduced to mud and sandbags and a narrow strip of rainy sky. (a dry snort) But we were discussing something else.  Oh yes.  Love in the trenches. \nNow he's talking only to himself. \nWHALE Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy. \nCLAY Something happened to him? \nWhale looks up at Clay, stares at him. \nWHALE I remember one morning in particular.  A morning when the sun came out. \nEXT. TRENCHES - DAY (1917) \nLEONARD BARNETT, 19, boyish and handsome, peers into a periscope.  Whale stands beside him, pointing out landmarks on the bleak landscape. \nWHALE (V.O.) Odd, how even there one could have days when the weather was enough to make one happy.  He and I were standing on the fire step and I showed him the sights of no-man's land, through the periscope.  It was beautiful.  The barbed wire was reddish gold, the water in the shell holes green with algae, the sky a clear quattrocento blue.  And I stood shoulder to shoulder with a tall apple-cheeked boy who loved and trusted me. \nWHALE Sit? \nPRINCESS MARGARET I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now. \nWhale realizes she's mistaken him for someone else.  He tugs his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes. \nPRINCESS MARGARET Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder? \nWHALE Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale. \nPRINCESS MARGARET (laughs) I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know. \nWhale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of humiliation.  He turns to Cukor for help. \nWHALE Hello, George.  James Whale.  David Lewis's friend.  I once made pictures myself, Ma'am. \nGEORGE CUKOR Yes.  Of course.  One can't throw a rock in this town without hitting one of us old movie directors. \nWhale feels the sting.  He turns to Clay. \nWHALE Ma'am, may I present Mr. Clayton Boone? \nClay steps forward to shake hands. \nWHALE My gardener, who insisted I bring him today.  He so wanted to meet royalty. \nCukor's face goes blank with indignation. \nCLAY Pleased to meet you. \nPRINCESS MARGARET Quite.  I adore gardens. \nWhale narrows his eyes at Cukor and sharpens his smile. \nWHALE He's never met a princess.  Only queens. \nCukor puffs out his chest, quivers a bulbous lower lip at Whale. \nWHALE George, Ma'am, this has been an honor.  An occasion to remember for the rest of my days. \nHe leads Clay away and an American couple promptly crowd in to take their place.  Striding through the garden, Whale is obviously pleased with himself. \nCLAY What was that about? \nWHALE Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink? \nWhale leads Clay to a tented bar.  Across the way, David Lewis has come through the gate with a WOMAN on his arm. People look discreetly, not at David but at the woman, lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses. \nCLAY Who's that? \nWHALE David.  The friend I thought was in New York. \nCLAY No.  The girl. \nWHALE Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor. \nClay watches in amazement as ELIZABETH TAYLOR waves to someone and pipes out a happy hello.  She hurriedly unties her scarf, thrusts it at David and runs off on tiptoes to embrace a woman. \nCLAY Is that really her? \nWHALE David produced her last picture. \nDavid glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat pocket.  He sees Whale looking at him.  He puts on a tight smile and strolls across the patio. \nDAVID What are you doing here? \nWHALE Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York. \nDAVID I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception. \nThe waiter arrives with their drinks.  Only when Clay takes his glass of beer does David see that Whale is not alone. \nDAVID David Lewis. \nCLAY Clay Boone. \nWHALE Our yardman.  Who was kind enough to serve as my escort to George's little do. \nDavid freezes.  Whale lifts his martini glass at Clay and takes a sip. \nDAVID Should you be drinking in your condition? \nWHALE Oh, David, stop being a nanny. \nWHALE Of course. \nELSA LANCHESTER What's our pesky friend up to now? \nKay returns, accompanied by a stopped, gray-haired man with a long rectangular face and wary, heavy-lidded eyes. \nELSA LANCHESTER Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion. \nWHALE Oh dear. \nKarloff, age 70, comes reluctantly, followed by his niece ALICE, a bashful young woman who carried a blanket-wrapped bundle. \nELSA LANCHESTER Boris, darling.  I didn't know you were here.  These public revels are hardly up your alley. \nBORIS KARLOFF I came for the sake of my visiting niece.  Alice.  And Miranda, my great-niece. \nHis huge hand lifts the blanket in Alice's arms, revealing a bald infant with enormous blue eyes.  Karloff gurgles and coos at the child. \nELSA LANCHESTER And what do you make of our royal visitant? \nBORIS KARLOFF Perfectly charming.  A real lady. \nELSA LANCHESTER Of course she's a lady.  What did you expect?  A hussy in tennis shoes? \nWhale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind Karloff.  He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are listening intently to the monocled British consul. \nWhale's eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together, his once and future monsters.  Kay shouts to a passing photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic. \nKAY Hey, you!  With the camera!  We got a historical moment here.  Come get a picture of it. \nThe man scans the scene for a famous face. \nKAY This is Mr. James Whale, who made \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein.\"  and this is the Monster and his Bride. \nClay looks up when he hears Kay identify Karloff. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Oh, Karloff.  Right. \nKarloff and Elsa drift into position next to Whale.  The flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light.  Whale cringes in pain. \nELSA LANCHESTER (through clenched teeth) Don't you just love being famous? \nAnother flash.  From Whale's perspective, the bulb resembles nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical current from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.  Whale concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his brain.  He clutches Elsa Lanchester's hand. \nELSA LANCHESTER Are you all right, Jimmy? \nA sharp nod from Whale.  The photographer motions to Karloff's niece. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Let me get one with Frankenstein holding the kid. \nAlice hands over the baby.  Karloff gently cradles the child.  Whale stands on his left, Elsa on his right.  They all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up.  Whale follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks and strains in a furious electrical storm. \nThe camera flashes once, then again. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Got it! \nWhale glances up -- the kite is gone.  Thunder rumbles as the group starts to disperse.  Whale nods to the faces exchanging good-byes. \nBORIS KARLOFF So good to see you again, James. \nHe strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby. \nKAY Catch you before you go, Mr. Whale. I'll make sure everybody gets sent a print. \nHe goes off with the photographer.  Elsa kisses Whale on the cheek. \nELSA LANCHESTER We'll be in touch, Jimmy. \nWHALE Good-bye.  So nice to see you... \nFinally Whale is alone.  He staggers to the deck chair and lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair. \nCLAY You okay? \nWhale gazes up at Clay. \nWHALE Tired.  A bit tired. \nClay nods.  Whale smiles at him. \nWHALE Are you enjoying yourself? \nCLAY Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place. \nWHALE What do you think? \nBarnett smiles his approval. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nClay opens the bathroom door, calls out. \nCLAY Mr. Whale? \nNo answer.  He goes to the top of the stairs and calls out. \nCLAY Where's those clothes you promised? \nAgain, nothing.  Rain ticks against the windows.  Clay goes down the stairs. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWhale fiddles with the knot of his tie. \nWHALE He trusts me, you know. \nBarnett sits on the edge of the bed now.  He smiles, a bit sadly. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThere's glow coming from the bedroom, and the sound of Whale's voice. \nCLAY Mr. Whale?  Jimmy? \nClay steps slowly toward the door, pushes it open.  He peers in. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWhale pulls on a blazer. \nCLAY Mr. Whale? \nWhale jumps.  He slaps a hand over his chest, twists around, sees Clay. \nWHALE Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already? \nCLAY Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling? \nWHALE I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry. (stands) I believe I promised you some clothes. \nWhale crosses to the closet.  Barnett is nowhere to be seen. \nWHALE You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants. \nCLAY No.  Definitely not. \nClay chuckles.  Whale smiles. \nWHALE Very good, Clayton. \nHe takes a robe from a hook on the closet door.  Clay tries it on but it won't close over the towel. \nWHALE I know. \nWhale opens a drawer, takes out a crewneck sweater. \nWHALE Absolutely swims on me, but should take care of your upper half. \nClay pulls the sweater over his head. \nWHALE That only leaves the rest. \nCLAY You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms? \nWHALE Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know. \nCLAY Do I have any other choice? \nWHALE Very sporting of you, Clayton. \nClay notices a framed drawing on the desk. \nCLAY Is that --? \nWHALE (nods) The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster. \nHe hands the sketch to Clay, who stares down at the famous flat head, hooded eyes, bolted neck of the Monster. \nClay sits in a straight-backed chair, smoking a cigarette and sipping his Scotch.  Whale sketches from a wing chair across the room. \nCLAY Storm's getting worse. \nWHALE \"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters.\" \nCLAY That's from your movie, right? \"The only monsters are here.\" \nWHALE I don't remember that one. \nCLAY James Whale.  This afternoon at the party. \nWhale looks up. \nCLAY I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, \"The only monsters are here.\"  I was wondering which here you meant. \nWHALE I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps. \nCLAY But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you. \nWHALE Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make. \nCLAY You're planning a trip? \nWhale's gaze remains dreamy and preoccupied as SOUNDS of battle fill the room.  A relentless rat-a-tat of gunfire. The whistling of bombs.  The tortured wailing of dying men. Whale stands, moves over to the window. \nWHALE Barnett.  Barnett on the wire. \nCLAY Your friend? \nWhale gazes out at the storm.  From his POV, we see a scarred and barren landscape, illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning. \nWHALE He caught his one night coming back from the reconnoiter.  I wouldn't take him out, but McGill did.  Just to give the lad a taste.  They were nearly home when a Maxim gun opened fire. \nEXT. TRENCHES - NIGHT (1917) \nWe race along the open trench with Whale, the darkened sky intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire.  He reaches the periscope, pulls an enlisted man off it.  From his POV, we see Barnett and McGill dodging bullets as they attempt to make their way back. \nWHALE (through clenched teeth) Come on.  Come on. \nMcGill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench. Barnett follows.  Just as his feet leave the ground his chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire.  Whale's eyes snap closed, trying to obliterate what they've just seen. \nWHALE (V.O.) Barnett's body fell in wire as thick as briers.  It was hanging there the next morning, a hundred yards from the line, too far out for anyone to fetch it. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWhale stares out impassively. \nWHALE We saw him at morning stand-to and evening stand-to.  \"Good morning, Barnett,\" we'd say each day. \"How's ole Barnett looking this morning?\"  \"Seems a little peaky. Looks a little plumper.\"  His wounds faced the other way and his hat shielded his eyes, so one could imagine he was napping on bedsprings.  He hung there until we were relieved.  We introduced him to the new unit before we marched out, speaking highly of his companionship. \nClay's eyes are filled with pity. \nWHALE Oh, but we were a witty lot. Laughing at our dead.  Telling ourselves it was our death too. But with each man who died, I thought, \"Better you than me, poor sod.\" (bitterly) A whole generation was wiped out by that war.  Millions and millions of young men. \nWhale begins to hum, a tune we have heard before: \nWHALE Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory? \nCLAY You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up. \nWHALE Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now. \nWhale remains perfectly still, staring out the window.  Clay deliberates a moment, then puts down his drink next to the decanter of Scotch.  He stands and yanks the neck of the sweater over his face, then tosses it on the sofa.  Whale blinks at the reflection in the glass, not yet understanding. \nCLAY You wanted to draw me like a Greek statue.  All right, then. \nClay pulls at the knot, lets go of the towel.  He defiantly parks his hands on his hips. \nCLAY There.  Not so bad. \nWhale continues to stare at the reflection, his back to Clay, his eyes wide and expressionless.  He turns slowly, fully expecting the vision to evaporate.  When he sees that Clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath. \nWHALE So it is going to happen after all. \nCLAY What'd you say? \nWhale doesn't respond.  Finally he opens his mouth to take a breath. \nWHALE No.  It won't do. \nCLAY What won't do? \nWHALE You are much too human. \nWHALE Oh yes.  I have you now. \nA strap breaks.  Clay rips the mask off. \nCLAY Get the fuck off! \nWhale's hand squeezes between Clay's legs. \nWHALE What will you do to get yourself back? \nClay jabs with his elbow, flipping Whale on his back.  His body straddles Whale's and pins him, face to face. \nCLAY I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you. \nWHALE Oh, but you feel good, Clayton. \nHis hands clasp Clay's hips.  Clay's fist opens as it comes down; he slaps Whale across the face. \nWHALE That didn't even sting.  You're not such a real man after all.  Are you? \nClay whacks Whale's face again. \nWHALE Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised? \nCLAY I haven't done a damn thing with you! \nWHALE Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself? \nClay snatches Whale's wrist before it can touch his crotch. With his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter. \nCLAY What the hell do you want from me?! \nWhale tilts his face up for another blow. \nWHALE I want you to kill me. \nClay freezes.  He stares down at the old man with white hair and wild eyes lying beneath him. \nWHALE Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far. \nCLAY You're crazy. \nWhale's eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning. \nWHALE Exactly, I'm losing my mind. Every day, another piece goes. Soon there will be nothing left. Look at the sketch I made of you. \nClay turns to the sketch pad, which lies on the floor next to Whale.  The page is filled with nothing but doodles and scrawls. \nCLAY Look, if you want to die do it yourself! \nWHALE No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share. \nClay's breathing comes in quick, panicked bursts. \nWHALE You'd be fully exonerated, I've taken care of that.  I wrote a note, I'll even leave you the house, the car... \nClay's body starts to tremble. \nWHALE Do it now, Clayton.  Make me invisible. \nClay lets out a howl -- his shoulders heave and shake. \nCLAY I am not your monster. \nHe climbs off Whale, crawls away, his body collapsing in wracking, anguished sobs.  Whale opens his eyes, gazes at Clay. \nWHALE What have I done? (sits up) Oh, selfish, selfish fool.  I have lost my mind. \nHe forces himself to his feet. \nWHALE What was I thinking? \nWhale picks up the towel and moves over to Clay. \nWHALE You're a softhearted bloke.  A bloody pussycat. \nWhale places the towel around Clay's shoulders. \nWHALE My deepest apologies.  Can you ever forgive me? \nClay doesn't look up. \nWHALE I suppose not. (a bone-crushing sigh) Good God, I am tired.  I really must go to bed. \nShe scoldingly cuts her eyes at Clay. \nHANNA Ten?  Very good, then.  Good-bye. \nShe hangs up and faces Clay with a stern frown. \nCLAY It's not what you think. \nHANNA I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast. \nCLAY I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale. \nHANNA There is nothing you can say that will surprise me. \nCLAY Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go? \nHANNA I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke. \nShe stomps into the kitchen.  Clay gets up, slips on his undershorts.  He's zipping up his chinos when she comes out again with a breakfast tray.  She hands him a cup of coffee. \nCLAY Thanks. (quickly) Why do you do it? \nHANNA What do I do? \nCLAY Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood. \nHANNA It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill. (picks up the tray) Enough talk.  I must wake up the master. \nShe marches around the corner towards Whale's bedroom.  Clay hears her knocking on a door. \nHANNA (O.S.) Mr. Jimmy?  Morning, Mr. Jimmy. \nClay pulls on his shirt.  Hanna comes back around the corner. \nHANNA What have you done with him? \nCLAY I put him to bed.  He's not there? \nShe goes to the foot of the stairs and shouts: \nHANNA Mr. Jimmy!  Mr. Jimmy! \nHanna starts up the stairs. \nHANNA Look for him! \nClay reaches for his socks when he notices an envelope on the floor next to the chair.  He picks it up.  On the front is scrawled the word 'CLAYTON'.  Clay opens the envelope. Inside is Whale's original sketch of the Monster's head.  He turns it over.  There is a message written on the back. \nCLAY No. \nClay drops the sketch, looks out.  He sees something. \nEXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY \nClay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope. \nEXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - POOL - DAY \nClay leaps headfirst into the water.  Whale rests lightly on his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair.  Clay hauls the body toward the side. \nCLAY Almost there.  Almost there. \nHe gets an arm around Whale's chest and heaves the body over the curb.  he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in the grass.  He grabs the wrist.  Nothing. \nCLAY Son of a bitch.  You crazy son of a bitch. \nClay straddles Whale's thighs and applies pressure on his rib cage.  But it's no use.  Clay sits up and takes a deep breath. \nHANNA Ohhh! \nHanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk.  She stares at Clay. \nCLAY I didn't do it.  This wasn't me. \nHANNA Oh, Mr. Jimmy. \nCLAY He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself. \nHANNA He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life. \nShe waves a folded piece of paper. \nHANNA You poor, foolish man.  You couldn't wait for God to take you in his time? \n", "test1_input": "\"Gods and Monsters\", shooting draft, by Bill Condon \n\"GODS AND MONSTERS\" \nScreenplay by Bill Condon \nBased on the novel \n\"Father of Frankenstein\" by Christopher Bram \nMay 30, 1997 \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME \"SCENE OMITTED\" SLUGS.

COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT (B & W) \nLightning splits the black-and-white sky, revealing a single shattered oak in a desolate landscape.  Below, a HUMAN SILHOUETTE stumbles through the darkness, the top of his head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with mud. \nSuddenly the storm fades.  Light creeps into the scene, and color, as we DISSOLVE TO: \nTHE PACIFIC OCEAN \nmelting into a hazy morning sky.  In a box canyon off the coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a makeshift village for beach bums. \nINT. TRAILER - DAY \nCLAYTON BOONE opens his eyes.  He is 26, handsome in a rough-hewn, Chet Baker-like way, with broad shoulders and a flattop haircut.  He grabs a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes, lights a bent cigarette. \nClay stands and walks bare-assed across the single tin room, his head almost touching the ceiling. \nEXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY \nClay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag that's set up behind his trailer. \nINT. TRAILER - DAY \nClay towels off, glances at the morning paper.  He moves aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a calendar.  His finger targets today's first appointment. \"10 A.M. - 788 Amalfi Drive.\" \nEXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY \nClay steps out of the trailer, clean-shaven and dressed in dungarees, a T-shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped into one sleeve.  He weight-lifts a secondhand mower onto the bed of his rusty pick-up. \nClay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the ignition.  It takes a few tries but the engine finally turns over. \nEXT.

A title reads: SANTA MONICA CANYON.  1957. \nThe pick-up drives past.  Clay parks in the back, hops out. \nANGLE - HOUSE \nA SHADOWY FIGURE stands at a window, watching Clay unload his red power mower. \nINT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe shadow is a man with dove white hair, wearing a dress shirt and seersucker jacket.  This is JAMES WHALE, age 67. \nDAVID I'd have more peace of mind if the live-in nurse were still here. \nHANNA She was nothing but bother.  I not like her, Mr. Jimmy not like her. We do better if you live-in again, Mr. David. \nIn the dining room, visible through open double doors, DAVID LEWIS, 55, speaks softly with the housekeeper, HANNA.  She is a squat, muffin-faced Hungarian woman in her late 50s, dressed in black, her hair cinched in a tight bun.  She speaks with a thick accent. \nDAVID You'll contact me if there's an emergency? \nHANNA Yes, I call you at this number. (calls out) Mr. Jimmy?  More coffee? \nWHALE What?  Oh yes.  Why not? \nHe moves into the dining room, sits opposite David. \n", "test1_true": "Hanna ignores him, returns to the kitchen. \nDAVID She tells me you haven't been sleeping well. \nWHALE It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone.

Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital. \nThe remark hits its target. \nDAVID I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars -- \nWHALE \"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars.\" \nDAVID (too anxious to laugh) You remember how a production eats up one's life. \nWHALE Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty. (stands) You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane. \nDavid extends his hand, but Whale draws him into a hug.  As he starts out, David points to a framed painting. \nDAVID By the way, I like the Renoir. \nWHALE Thank you. \nDAVID (calls out) Goodbye, Hanna. \nHanna runs out of the kitchen to escort David to the door. Whale drifts back to the window, watches as Clay revs up the lawnmower, creating a cloud of white smoke.  We CUT TO: \nEXT. STREETS OF DUDLEY - DAY (1900) \nA bean-pole child with flaming red hair (WHALE at age 12) stares up at the coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless row of chimneys.  We're in Dudley, a factory town in the English Midlands region known as the Black Country. \nSARAH WHALE (O.S.) Stop lagging behind, Jimmy.  We'll be late for church. \nYOUNG WHALE Yes, Mum. \nWhale runs to catch up to his six brothers and sisters.  His father, WILLIAM WHALE, frowns at the boy's prissy trot. \nWILLIAM WHALE Straighten up, son. \nYoung Whale's movements thicken into a dim imitation of manly reserve.  The Whale family marches up a steeply mounting street to Dixon's Green Methodist Church. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nWhale's eyes tighten.  He focuses on Clay Boone as he peels off his T-shirt, revealing a tattoo on his upper right forearm. \nWHALE Hanna?  Who's the new yardman? \nHANNA Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap. \nWhale nods, chooses a walking stick.  He emerges into the sunlight. \nEXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY \nWhale moves jauntily onto the front lawn, singing to himself: \nWHALE The bells of hell go ting-a-ling For you but not for me. Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory? \nWhale steps up next to Clay. \nWHALE Good morning. \nCLAY (not looking up) Mornin'. \nWHALE My name is Whale.  This is my house. \nCLAY Nice place. \nWHALE And your name is --? \nCLAY Boone.  Clayton Boone. \nWHALE I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean? \nCLAY Just that I was in the Marines. \nWHALE The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea. \nClay shrugs nonchalantly. \nWHALE Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it. \n", "test1_id": 2943, "test2_input": "Elsa stares at the beautiful corpse in the mirror.  She snaps her head left, right, up, down, startled by the sight of herself, electrocuted into frightened, spastic jerks. \nELSA LANCHESTER Oh, James. \nAs Whale observes his star we see her spasms through his eyes -- as a series of dissonant, line-jumping close-ups. \nELSA LANCHESTER And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup. \nWHALE Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary. (to an assistant) Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil. \nWhale scans the page of shooting script, the margin marked in pencil: CU, MS, MLS.  Whale pencils in a bracket and scribbles: CU a,b,c,d---MOS. \nWHALE Jack, I want to get on this right away.  Sorry, Boris, we won't get to you until this afternoon. \nBORIS KARLOFF I 'ish you 'old 'e 'ooner. \nThe assistant removes his mouthpiece. \nBORIS KARLOFF I could have spent the morning tending to my roses. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY \nThe interior of Stage C is completely filled by the laboratory set.  Electricians adjust the lights on the wooden tower beside the Bride's table.  COLIN CLIVE (Dr. Frankenstein) and ERNEST THESIGER (Dr. Pretorius) sit off to the side, in full makeup and costume.  Clive mumbles earnestly over his script.  Thesiger pinches his face over the needle he dips in and out of an embroidery ring. \nWhale comes on the set with Elsa on his arm.  She walks regally beside him, the train of her long white robe thrown over one arm.  There's a wolf whistle from overhead, and applause, causing Elsa to curtsy to her admirers.  Thesiger takes her hand, leans back to study her. \nERNEST THESIGER My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers. \nELSA LANCHESTER Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman. \nERNEST THESIGER Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours. \nELSA LANCHESTER In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper. \nERNEST THESIGER I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line. \nELSA LANCHESTER More your line. \nERNEST THESIGER My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men. \nWHALE Colin?  Please.  It's time. (softly, to Thesiger) How is he today? \nERNEST THESIGER Stiff as a board. (calls out) Yes, Colin.  Come see what they've done to our Elsa. \nClive walks over, glumly. \nCOLIN CLIVE I'm not at my best today, Jimmy. A touch of flu, you know. \nWhale sees through the excuse, rests an arm on Clive's shoulder. \nWHALE Relax, my boy.  You could do this scene in your sleep. \nClive grits his teeth and nods.  Whale positions them in front of the upended table, Clive and Thesiger holding Elsa's robe out by the hems.  The shadow of the sound boom passes back and forth while they rehearse. \nERNEST THESIGER I gather we not only did her hair but dressed her.  What a couple of queens we are, Colin. \nElsa giggles.  Clive looks distraught -- which brings some life to his stiffness.  Whale sees this, decides to tune it higher. \nWHALE Yes, a couple of flaming queens. And Pretorius is a little in love with Dr. Frankenstein, you know. \nClive's distress reads clearly now.  He is twitchy and alive. \nWHALE Yes.  I think it's coming together. Shall we have a go? \nHe sits in the canvas director's chair, nods to the assistant director. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR Quiet on the set! \nThe warning bell rings. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR Lights! \nThe lights sizzle and blaze. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR Sound! \nSOUND MAN Okay for sound. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR Camera! \nA young man with a clapboard steps in front of the camera. \nCAMERA ASSISTANT Scene two-fifteen.  Take one. \n", "test2_true": "The Bride snaps her head in various directions.  Thesiger slopes back, fingers splayed, intoxicated by his creation: \nERNEST THESIGER The Bride of Frankenstein! \nWhale sits with his legs crossed, jogging his raised foot as if conducting the scene with his show.  Fully engaged, intensely alive.  We CUT TO: \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWhale glances at the clock, sees that it is 3:15.  He is wide awake.  He reaches over, picks up the Luminal. \nWHALE Luminal.  Illumine all. \nWhale reluctantly places the pill on his tongue and swallows.  He rests his head on the pillow and stares at the ceiling, where the reflection of the window sheers casts an ever-shifting pattern of light and dark.  We move down to reveal: \nINT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT (BLACK & WHITE) \nIt's a cobblestone cell, a plaster set from \"Bride of Frankenstein.\"  Whale sits in a massive chair, straining against thick iron chains, as a lightning storm rages outside.  In the distance, heavy footsteps, coming closer, until the cell door is filled with the silhouette of the Monster.  Whale hardly dares to breathe as the Monster rips off the door and enters the cell. \nThe Monster steps into the light, allowing us to see his face for the first time.  It is Clay Boone, dressed in a Marine parade uniform.  He uses his hedge clippers to cut the chains from around Whale's chest. \nWHALE Thank you.  Thank you so much. \nClay leans down and takes Whale in his arms, cradling him like a child.  They move across the sound stage -- Clay carefully sidestepping the lights and cables on the floor -- until they reach the next set: \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT \nClay carries Whale past a painted backdrop of a stormy English countryside. \nINT. FRANKENSTEIN'S LAB - NIGHT \nWhale lies on the Bride's table.  Clay pulls on a doctor's smock, picks up a scalpel from a table covered with various medical instruments.  he carves a thin circle around the top of Whale's forehead.  Then, with one deft movement, he pops off Whale's scalp and pulls out the brain.  It is soot-covered, charred, used up. \nWhale watches with detached fascination as Clay tosses it on the floor, then takes a throbbing, luminous mass from a tray. \nClay inserts the new brain into Whale's skull, sutures the scalp back into place.  he fastens the conducting clamps around Whale's temples, then throws the heavy circuit breaker.  Lights throb with bursts of energy...loose sparks crackle...rotary sparks create snapping circles of fire...as the energy of the raging storm is harnessed into the machinery. \nClay steps back to take in his handiwork.  A sudden look of panic fills Whale's face. \nWHALE It isn't working.  The experiment is a failure. \nClay glances down at Whale, whose breathing is slowing. Realizing that the new brain hasn't taken: \nCLAY Just go to sleep. \nA serenity suffuses Whale's features as he stares up at the pale flicker of lightning.  His breathing finally stops, his face a tranquil mask of death.  We CUT TO: \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY \nWhale wakes with a start.  He checks the clock, sees that it's past nine.  He presses an intercom button on the bedside table. \nWHALE I'm up, Hanna. \nWhale sits up, drinks in the sunlight.  He notices some grass clippings and leaves scattered on the bedspread. \nWHALE What in God's name -- \nWhale turns and sees Clay lying next to him.  He gasps. \nCLAY (angrily) I told you to sleep. \nClay's hands close around Whale's neck.  We CUT TO: \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY \nWhale opens his eyes groggily.  He scans the room in panic, clearly unable to get his bearings. \nWhale tries to stand but his legs give way beneath him. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY (LATER) \nWhale and Hanna stare straight out as she reaches down and unbuttons the tiny buttons on his pajama fly.  Whale supports himself with one hand on Hanna's shoulder as he relieves himself with the other. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY (LATER) \nWhale sits up in bed, staring dumbly at the morning paper. Hanna reaches in to take away the breakfast tray. \nWHALE Does the yardman come today? \nHANNA Of course.  This afternoon. \nA thin smile forms on Whale's face. \nEXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY \n", "test2_id": 2944, "test3_input": "Clay smiles anxiously as the call connects. \nCLAY Mom?  Yeah, it's me. \nClay pauses as his mother shoots questions at him. \nCLAY No, I'm not in jail...I don't want any money, no... (louder, to be heard) Look, is Sis there?  I want to tell her about this movie person I met out here.  She'll get a kick out of it. \nWe hear the phrase: \"She's out, Clay.\"  Clay closes his eyes as his mother rambles on. \nCLAY No, I still...I'd give you my phone number if I had a phone -- \nClay tries to stay calm as his mother berates him for not staying in touch. \nCLAY How's the old man? \nBefore Clay can protest we hear: \"Hold on.\"  Clay glances out at couples strolling up the promenade.  An operator interrupts, says: \"One dollar for the next three minutes.\" Clay deposits two quarters before his mother returns. \"He's busy, Clay.\" \nCLAY Right. \nThe operator comes on again, asking for fifty more cents. Clay stares at the quarters in his hand. \nCLAY Time's up.  I better go. \nClay listens as his mother prattles on, until the connection is broken and the phone goes dead.  Clay steps out of the booth, takes a deep breath of ocean air. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY \nWhale and Hanna go through the closet together. \nHANNA Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend. \nWHALE I'd hardly call our yardman a friend. \nHANNA No.  But someone you can talk to. \nWhale stops, turns to Hanna. \nWHALE Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna? \nHANNA I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ. \nWHALE Of course.  How is the old boy these days? \nThe naughty remark is met with a solemn stare.  Whale reaches up, chooses a lightweight blue suit. \nWHALE It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora... \nHANNA It must be up in your old room.  I will look. \nThe phone rings.  Hanna hurries to answer it. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MAIN HALL - DAY \nHanna speaks softly in Hungarian.  Whale points upstairs to let her know he will look for the hat himself. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY \nWhale opens the closet door and takes down a stack of hatboxes from the overhead shelf.  He opens the first box, takes out a rubbery wad of heavy fabric with two round windows like eyes.  It's a gas mask.  We CUT TO: \nINT. TRENCHES - NIGHT (1917) \nThe night sky explodes with light and smoke.  Whale moves calmly through the chaos, trying to maintain a modicum of order among the troops. \nWHALE Gas masks on.  Gas masks on. \nAt the end of the line, young Barnett is struggling with his straps.  Mustard gas is starting to stream into the trench. \nBARNETT Don't mind me, Lieutenant.  Save yourself. \nWhale slips the mask over Barnett's face, fastens it.  He slides his own mask into position moments before the trench is obliterated by the yellowish smoke.  We CUT TO: \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY \nHanna stands in the door with a forlorn frown. \nHANNA Oh, Mr. Jimmy.  You make a mess of it.  Here. \nHanna lifts the lid of an unopened box to show him the missing fedora. \nHANNA (stacking boxes) That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short. \nWHALE I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like. \n", "test3_true": "Hanna holds out the box for the gas mask.  Whale gives it a long, final look, then drops it in the box. \nWHALE You can toss this one in the trash. \nHanna clamps the lid on the box. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY \nHanna has opened the door.  At the end of the hall, silhouetted against the bright afternoon sky, is Clay.  His shoulders fill the doorway.  The top of his head is perfectly flat. \nWHALE Good afternoon, Clayton. \nCLAY Do I look okay? \nClay steps into the light.  His khaki pants are clean and pressed.  A blue knit shirt fits his muscles snugly. \nWHALE You look splendid, my boy.  Quite splendid. \nINT. WHALE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY \nWhale crosses to the passenger side of the Chrysler. \nWHALE I suppose you'd like the top down. \nCLAY If that's okay? \nWHALE Nothing would please me more. \nClay squeezes behind the wheel, shifts the seat back, explores switches.  The vinyl top pops up and folds backward. \nWhale gets in.  Clay starts the engine and backs out. \nEXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY \nHanna stands at the front door, hands tangled in her apron. Whale tugs his hat brim at her as the car swings around the driveway. \nWhale smiles at the wide open sky overhead.  Clay steps on the gas and the Chrysler takes off. \nEXT. CUKOR HOUSE - DAY \nThe party is clearly audible from the road, where Clay has squeezed the Chrysler into a long row of shiny cars nuzzling the high brick wall.  Whale puts his dark glasses on. \nWHALE Stars, you know.  The suns of other galaxies. \nThey walk up the steep road to the gatehouse. \nWHALE Good old George.  He loves to put on the dog.  Only his dogs tend to have a bit of mutt. \nA WOMAN at the gate inspects the invitation, waves them through. \nEXT. CUKOR HOUSE - LAWN - DAY \nA sunny patio with hedges and statues.  Wickets and stakes have been set up for a game of croquet, but only a handful of very tanned children strut around with mallets. \nWHALE What did I tell you?  Listen. \nCLAY I don't hear anything. \nWHALE Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag. \nWhale scans the crowd. \nWHALE Slim pickings.  Well, it's early yet.  Perhaps this is a good time to pay our respects. \nClay follows Whale toward a trellis alcove covered in ivy. A handful of people grin at the mismatched couple who stand in the shade: a homely older man in glasses and a pretty woman in a white dress with polka dots.  GEORGE CUKOR and PRINCESS MARGARET. \nWHALE Let's get this over with quickly. \nWhale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward. Before he can give Cukor their names Princess Margaret's polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth. \nPRINCESS MARGARET I had no idea you'd be here. \nShe seizes Whale's hand in her little white gloves. \nPRINCESS MARGARET How are you? \nWHALE (taken aback) Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness? \nPRINCESS MARGARET Splendid.  Now that I know you're around. \nStanding beside him, Clay is clearly impressed that Whale knows a princess. \nPRINCESS MARGARET Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again. \n", "test3_id": 2945}

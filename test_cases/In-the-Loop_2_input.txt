TOBY (CONT'D) Technically, you've got a Capitol Hill view. 
45   INT. GEORGETOWN HOUSE - NIGHT                                    45 
A smart private cocktail party in a fancy Georgetown house. Karen and General Miller spot each other. 
They each take a glass of champagne from a waiter. 
GENERAL MILLER Hey Karen. You look beautiful. 
KAREN I bet you say that to all the girls. GENERAL MILLER Yeah I do. And some of the guys. 
KAREN That's why you shouldn't run for Senate. Too many skeletons in your enormous closet. 
GENERAL MILLER Yeah, don't believe the hype. I'm just thinking about doing ... something. I'm more than just a soldier, Karen. 
KAREN That's right, you're passionate about education and housing and what's the other thing? 
GENERAL MILLER Lingerie.

KAREN That's right. 
GENERAL MILLER And bestiality. 
KAREN I'd forgotten about that. Are you still allergic to that dog? 
GENERAL MILLER Yes, yes. I wake up and my eyes are closed and my head is swollen and I look like a giant ball sack. 
KAREN Oh my god, they do have memdication for that.....but a beautiful ball sack, though. And how's the pentagon? GENERAL MILLER It's kicked up a level. Talking invasion real soon. 
KAREN Is there somewhere we can talk? 
GENERAL MILLER I don't know, I don't live in this house. 
46   INT. CAULDERWOOD'S PARTY. ADJOINING PLAY ROOM - EVENING          46 
General Miller and Karen are in Caulderwood's kids' play room. Toys are piled up everywhere. KAREN What if someone comes in now? 
GENERAL MILLER I can't think of an excuse that would work can you? 
KAREN No. Just be careful. Don't mess stuff up. 
They sit down on the child's bed. Miller grabs a crayon. 
GENERAL MILLER Okay so that's total minimum European Theatre requirement. 
He shows her a figure on a piece of paper. 
GENERAL MILLER (CONT'D) (he scribbles) This is Far East, Korea, Japan etc. Page 43 
46   CON TINUE D:                                                     46 
He scribbles. 
GENERAL MILLER (CONT'D) Add those. Plus contingency already deployed. 
KAREN Er - you've lost me. 
Miller looks around, grabs a child's laptop. Opens it, it says `howday' in an electronic voice. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Your military hardware is impressive. 
GENERAL MILLER Not anymore it isn't. Okay so this is total current deployment. (he types) Europe, Asia. (He types) And the contingency already deployed. (He types) So the current number of combat troops available for an invasion according to these figures would be ... (he presses the `equals' button) 
COMPUTER VOICE Twelve. 
KAREN Thousand? GENERAL MILLER No, twelve. Twelve soldiers. Twelve. 
KAREN You're shitting me. 
GENERAL MILLER Of course I'm shitting you, but 12 thousand isn't enough. Twelve thousand's about how many are going to die. And you really need a few guys alive at the end of a war or it looks like you've lost. 
KAREN Uh-huh. Tomorrow I've got to meet these Brits. Simon Foster. He's the guy that said war was unforseeable, and I think he could very useful on the committee because he could internationalise the dissent.

GENERAL MILLER You're going to use him as a little meat puppet. 
INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - TOBY'S ROOM. Simon knocks on the door. Toby opens, he's in his boxer shorts and shirt. 
SIMON Tobes. Hi. So! What's the plan? What swanky reception are we going to? 
TOBY (panic in his eyes) What's the plan? For tonight? 
SIMON Well that's what I'm asking you Toby, my chief aide, my political advisor.

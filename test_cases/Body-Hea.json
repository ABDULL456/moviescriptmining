NIGHT SKY \nFlames in the night sky. Distant SIRENS. PULLING BACK, we see that the burning building is mostly hidden by dense, black shapes that define the oceanside skyline of Miranda Beach, Florida. We're watching from across town. The sound of a bathroom SHOWER comes to a dripping stop at about the same time we see the naked back and head of NED RACINE. We continue to PULL BACK INTO -- \nRACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRacine, dressed in undershorts, is standing on the small porch off his apartment on the upper floor of an old house. Racine lights a cigarette and continues to stare off at the fire. We've passed him now, into the bedroom of the apartment, and the shape of a young woman, ANGELA, flashes by, drying her body with a towel. \nANGELA (O.S.) My God, it's hot. I stepped out of the shower and stared sweating again. ... It's still burning? Jesus, it's bigger! And I thought you were making me hear those sirens. (she giggles) What is it? \nRACINE The Seawater Inn. My family used to eat dinner there twenty-five years ago. Now somebody's torched it to clear the lot. \nAngela reappears briefly, gathering her clothes.   She sits on an unseen bed to get dressed. \nANGELA (O.S.) That's a shame. \nRACINE Probably one of my clients. \nANGELA (O.S.) I'm leaving. \nRACINE (back still turned) It's four a.m. \nOn the bed, Angela snaps on her bra. \nANGELA I go on duty at Miami Airport at seven.

I'm just getting into my uniform here... \nShe is, in fact, slipping on the blouse of her Avis Rent- a-Car uniform. There's a smile on her lips as she buttons up, watching Racine. \nANGELA You've had your fun. You're spent. (trying for a straight face) I'll just slip into my uniform here and slip away. \nRACINE My history's burning up out here. \nANGELA Hey, I don't mind. I'm leaving. Why do they make these damn skirts so hard to zip... \nNow, for the first time, Racine turns to look at   her. She is sitting on the edge of the bed, half into   her uniform. Racine smiles broadly at the  sight and   moves into the room. He pushes her back and  they both   disappear from sight, fabric rustling. \nRACINE Where's your hat? \nANGELA (O.S.) Hey... hey... (giggling) ... don't wrinkle it! \nRACINE (O.S.) 'You're spent.' Where'd you hear that? \nWe are left looking out over the porch at the night. And we go back there, across the rooftops, to the flames. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nAn Assistant County Prosecutor named PETER LOWENSTEIN has been conferring at the bench with JUDGE COSTANZA and now they both wait as Racine comes into view to join them. \nThe Judge is irritated. \nJUDGE COSTANZA Mr. Racine, I do no longer care whether these alleged toilets were (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             3. \nJUDGE COSTANZA (CONT'D) ever actually en route from Indiana or not. I think we're wasting our time here. It's pretty clear your client has attempted to defraud the county in a not very ingenious manner. (he nods at Lowenstein) The Assistant Prosecutor has made what I consider a generous offer. And given that you've failed to generate even the semblance of a defense -- \nRACINE Judge Costanza, perhaps when I've presented all -- \nJUDGE COSTANZA Yeah, yeah. If I were you, I'd recommend to your client that held quickly do as Mr. Lowenstein here has suggested -- plead nolo contendre, file Chapter Eleven and agree never to do business with Okeelanta County again. \nRacine is surprised and pleased. \nRACINE You would look favorably on that? \nJUDGE COSTANZA (nods) He can walk. But don't test my patience for even five more minutes. If he hesitates, I'll nail him. \nRACINE I'll talk to him. \nRacine starts to turn. \n", "test1_true": "Lowenstein smiles. \nRACINE Thank you, Your Honor. \nRacine goes back to his client, a Businessman of enormous confidence and extravagantly untrustworthy appearance. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                4. \nINT. STELLA'S COFFEE SHOP - FIRST STREET - DAY \nRacine and Lowenstein are seated at the counter. Racine drinks beer while Lowenstein drinks a tall iced tea very rapidly and signals for another. This place is across the street from the courthouse/police station and there are plenty of lawyers and cops around, several of whom acknowledge Lowenstein and Racine with pats or nods. \nA single unit air conditioner is blowing away above the door, but it can't compete with the blasts of hot air that come in with each new patron. All of these people, like the pedestrians outside the window, have stripped down to essentials In the infernal heat. The lawyers all carry their Jackets, but even so their shirtsleeves are sweaty. The town is sizzling. \nLOWENSTEIN -- I think I've underestimated you, Ned. I don't know why it took me so long. You've started using your incompetence as a weapon. \nRACINE (smiles) My defense was evolving. You guys got scared. Costanza doesn't like me. What'd I do to him? \nLOWENSTEIN He's an unhappy man, Thinks he should be Circuit Court by now. Here he is in a state with really top-notch corruption and he's stuck with the county toilets. (he drinks) I'm surprised you weren't in on that toilet caper. Could have been that quick score you've always been searching for. \nRACINE Maybe Costanza was in on it.   That's why he was mad. \nSTELLA, the owner of the coffee shop, writes and places separate checks in front of the two men. \nSTELLA What's the word from the hallowed halls of justice? Anything juicy? \nLOWENSTEIN Maybe Stella was in on it. (finished his tea) Stella, when you gonna get a real air conditioner in here. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               5. \nSTELLA You don't like it there's lots of other places. \nLOWENSTEIN They don't have you. Gotta go. \nHe stands fishing for change, but Racine takes his check and places it with his own. Lowenstein nods and moves for the door. \nLOWENSTEIN You can't buy me. No sirree, I don't come cheap. \nJust before he reaches the door he does a strange thing -- he takes several graceful dance steps in the Astaire manner. \nA VOICE Lowenstein, you're a fag. \nLowenstein spins out the door, where he is blasted by the heavy air. His body droops as he disappears. \nSTELLA Why does he do that? \nRACINE He's pretty good, that's the weird part. \nSTELLA Did you hear about Dr. Block? \nRACINE No.   Do I want to? \nSTELLA (leans toward him, confidential) Agnes Marshall. \nRACINE (the thought disgusts him) That must have been Mrs. Block's idea, some kind of punishment. \nSTELLA It was! How'd you know? Christ, you're plugged in better than me. So you must know about Mrs. Block's friend in Ocean Grove. \nRacine winces, gets up, and puts money on the counter. He lights a cigarette. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              6. \nRACINE Stella, this is beneath even you. Things must be slow. \nStella agrees with a shrug as Racine heads for the door. \nSTELLA It's the heat. \nEXT. FIRST STREET AND MAIN STREET - DAY \nRacine makes his way up First to the corner of Main and crosses diagonally to his building on Main. He is well- known here, greeted through glass by many of the shop owners. The heat dominates much of the pantomimed conversation. Racine goes in a doorway and heads up the stairs to his office. \nINT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY \nRacine's secretary, BEVERLY, is behind the desk in the modest reception room. She's a pretty girl barely past twenty. She pushes some phone message slips toward Racine and nods toward the sofa. A middle-aged woman client, MRS. SINGER, sits there clutching a walking stick. Her face suddenly is contorted in pain. Racine glances meaningfully at Beverly then turns his full solicitous charm on Mrs. Singer. \nRACINE Mrs. Singer, I would have gladly come to the house. \nHe helps her up and leads her slowly to his office. \nMRS. SINGER No. no, the doctor says I should walk and I had some shopping. Not that that quack knows what he's talking about. I tell you, Mr. Racine, I'm not sure his testimony is going to be very useful. \nRACINE Don't worry about it. I'll find you a doctor who's more understanding. Is it bad today? \nMRS. SINGER Oooh, you can't imagine. Nothing can make up for the pain they've caused me. \nRACINE How well I know. We'll sue those reckless bastards dry. Excuse my language. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 7. \nAs Mrs. Singer disappears into the office, Racine flashes a grin at Beverly. \n", "test1_id": 1905, "test2_input": "MATTY (shrugs) Edmund mentioned it once. \nRacine lights another cigarette and gazes off into the fog, thinking. Matty presses her cheek against his chest and closes her eyes tight. \nMATTY Ned, it scares me to talk about these things. \nRACINE Why? \nMATTY You know. \nRACINE No.    I don't. \nMATTY Let's just not, okay? Let's not think about all he's got. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                42. \nRACINE (pressing) What is it, Matty? Tell me exactly what frightens you. \nMATTY I'm afraid... because when I think about it, I wish that he'd die. That's really what I want. It's horrible and ugly and It's what I most want. \nRacine looks off into the night for a few beats, then he lifts her face so he can look into her eyes. \nRACINE That's where we're at, isn't it, Matty? \nMATTY What do you mean? \nRACINE That's what we're both thinking -- how good it'd be for us if he were gone. It'd be real sweet for us. \nMATTY Don't talk about it, Ned. Please don't. Talk is dangerous. Sometimes it makes things happen, it makes it real. \nRACINE Don't let it scare you. Because he's not gonna die. There's nothing wrong with him, is there? There's no reason to think he's gonna die, is there? \nMatty shakes her head \"no,\" lays it in his chest again. \nRACINE That's right. So we might as well forget about it, It's not gonna just happen to make things nice for us... It won't just happen. \nRacine lifts her head and kisses her on the mouth. \nMATTY I'm afraid, Ned. \nRACINE Maybe that's a smart way to be now, Matty. Maybe we both should be. \nRacine takes a last drag on his cigarette and flicks it out into the fog, \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                43. \nRACINE The only thing wrong with your husband right now... is us. \nINT. BAR - PAY PHONE AT BACK \nAgain, Racine is getting no answer.   He gives up, goes back to his seat at the bar. \nEXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - MAIN STREET - DAY \nLate afternoon. Racine, sportcoat slung over his shoulder, listens to repeated ringing at the other end of his call. He's surprised there's no answer. People drag by, making their way home from work in the heat. Finally, Racine hangs up. \nRacine comes out of the phone booth. He has nowhere to go. He ambles down the street. A few people say hello. He walks diagonally across the street toward a restaurant called \"Tulio's.\" \nINT. TULIO'S RESTAURANT - DUSK \nThe best restaurant in Miranda Beach. Racine slips on his jacket as he comes in the door. He waves to the Hostess across the dining room, indicating he'll be alone tonight. She signals a short wait. He steps toward the bar, bringing him suddenly face to face with Matty. \nRACINE Well, well.   Hello to you -- \nThe panic which shoots across her face, cuts him off in mid-sentence, a split second before EDMUND WALKER appears behind her. Matty's face goes calm and she smiles politely. \nMATTY (to Racine) Hello. \nShe turns to her husband. He is not what Racine expected. He may, in fact, be mean, as Matty described him, but he looks neither small nor weak. A handsome man, he is bigger than Racine and in terrific shape. Dressed in an expensive summer suit, he radiates vigor and controlled physical power. He wears sleek, metal-framed glasses. \nMATTY Darling, I'd like you to meet Mr. Racine. I'm sorry. I don't know your first name. \nRACINE Ned. \nHe offers his hand and Walker encloses it firmly in his. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                44. \nWALKER Edmund Walker.    Nice to meet you. \nMATTY Mr. Racine is the lawyer I told you about. (Walker doesn't remember) You remember. He had a client who wanted to buy the house. I told him we weren't selling. \nWALKER Right. \nRACINE That hasn't changed, has it? \nWALKER No, we're very happy with it. \nRACINE (nods) I can understand that.    It's a terrific place. \nWalker nods, looking at Racine carefully.    He motions toward the dining room. \n", "test2_true": "RACINE I was just going to grab a bite. \nWALKER Join us. \nRACINE No. Thanks very much, but I don't want to interfere with -- \nThe Hostess has come toward them. \nWALKER Don't be silly. Come on. (to Hostess) We have room for three, don't we? \nThe Hostess nods and leads the way. Walker gestures Matty ahead, then puts a big hand behind Racine's elbow and ushers him into the dining room. \nWALKER I've heard this place is great. But you can't get near it on the weekends and I don't get down during the week much. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               45. \nRACINE Is that right? \nWIPE TO: \nLATER \nThey have finished their salad at a table toward the back. A Waiter comes and takes away their dishes. Walker has taken off his glasses and is cleaning the lenses with a lovely handkerchief. He does this cleaning with enormous care and inordinate relish. His manner is a mix of gruff charm and hinted menace. There's something dangerous about the man and it's perfectly distilled in his smile, which is quick, frequent and vaguely threatening. \nWALKER I was a lawyer. Still am, I guess. But I don't practice. Went to Columbia. You? \nRACINE F. S. U. \nWALKER (nods) Good school.  I got bored with it quick. I guess I didn't have the temperament.  I wanted to make the money faster.  Is there a living in it here? \nRACINE I can afford to send my shirts out. And eat here once a month, if I don't order an appetizer. \nWalker smiles, re-folds his handkerchief carefully and puts it back in the cheat pocket of his jacket. \nWALKER I figured an honest lawyer doesn't make much and the other kind was too slimy for me. I'd rather be upfront about shafting somebody. \nMATTY Edmund, really.     It's Mr. Racine's profession. \nRACINE That's all right. I don't like it much. \nWALKER What's to like. That's the way of the world. Most people despise their jobs. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              46. \nWalker picks up a wine bottle and pours more into each of their glasses, emptying it. \nRACINE Do you? \nWALKER No. I love it.     But it's not a job. \nRACINE What is it, exactly? \nWalker signals to a distant Waiter for another bottle of wine. He does it with a small flick of his finger. \nWALKER Various things.     This and that. Here and there. \nRACINE You don't have to be specific. \nWALKER (that smile again) Finance, basically. Venture capital, Investments, real estate. We're into a few things. \nRACINE Yeah?   Around here? \nWALKER Some.   We own some things here. \nMATTY Edmund's company owns The Breakers. \nRACINE Is that right? \nFor a second, Walker's eyes flick over Matty like a whip. \nWALKER It's not that simple. We have an interest in a few places along the shore. For the land. You know. Someday. There's no explaining it to her. \nMATTY (to Racine) I'm too dumb. Woman, you know. \nShe picks up her purse and stands up with a good-humored smile. The men rise. \nMATTY I'll be right back. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             47. \nThen maybe we can talk about pantyhose or something interesting. \nShe walks away. Walker watches her go with a satisfied, possessive grin. They sit. \nWALKER She's something, isn't she? \nRACINE (nods) A lovely lady. \nWALKER Yes, she is. I'm crazy about her. If I ever thought she was seeing another guy... I don't know. (he takes a sip of wine) I'd understand how it could happen. Her being the way she is. I'd understand it. But I think I'd kill the guy with my bare hands. \nRACINE That's understanding. \n", "test2_id": 1906, "test3_input": "Racine's face. He knows that for the first time in his life, he's really done it. There's no turning back. \nRacine does something that he's going to be doing for the rest of his life. He looks in the rear view mirror. \nINT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT \nEverything is as Racine left it. Edmund's body lies beneath the beam. It is barely discernible in the gloom. The only bright spot in the room is the incendiary device, its shiny surface catching some errant sliver of light. \nAnd then it explodes with a harsh SHRIEK. And the light of the magnesium chips is white, blinding. The chips are out in all directions to the waiting puddles of gasoline. The light goes from white to yellow as huge flames engulf the room. The flames ROAR. We watch them for a few moments and then -- \nSLOWLY DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nMatty stands in the FOG, one arm wrapped around a post of the porch. Above her the wind chimes TINKLE. She struggles to hear something else. Finally she does hear it and her face relaxes and she looks at peace. Listening to soft, distant SIRENS. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                77. \nFADE IN: \nINT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe fedora hangs on the coatstand. Racine works at his desk, reading over a long contract. The sun is cutting through the Venetian blinds behind him in glaring strips and, as he leans back in his chair, he finds it impossible to read his document. He gets up, goes to the window and adjusts the blinds so that his desk goes dark in the shade. As it does, the PHONE RINGS. Beverly answers out in the reception room, her conversation muffled through the slightly cracked door. She hits a hold button and yells, as is her informal custom. \nBEVERLY Ned.   Miles Hardin. Do you want him? \nRACINE Who is he? \nBEVERLY She says he's a lawyer from Miami. \nRacine picks up his phone. \nRACINE Hello. \nSECRETARY (filtered) Mr. Ned Racine? \nRACINE Yes. \nSECRETARY Miles Hardin calling. \nThe Secretary goes off and Racine is left holding. He waits five long beats and seems about to hang up when a Voice comes on, very dry and cold. \nHARDIN (filtered throughout) Mr. Racine. \nRACINE Yes. \nHARDIN This is Miles Hardin of Morris and Dale in Miami. \nRACINE Yes. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                78. \nHARDIN As you know, we represented Edmund Walker. \nRACINE Yes. \nHardin seems to expect more of a response.    Racine is silent. \nHARDIN Yes, well, Mrs. Walker has submitted the new will you wrote up there. \nRacine closes his eyes for a moment. The blood drains out of his face. He puts a hand out toward his desk. \nRACINE Yes...    I see. \nHARDIN And frankly, Mr. Racine, I think we may have a problem. \nRACINE Uh-huh.    What problem is that? \nHARDIN Well, I'd   rather discuss  it in person. In fact I   think it might  be best if we could   all get together  down there. That is,   if you wouldn't  object. \nRACINE No no, that would be all right. \nHARDIN Good. We have a relationship with a firm in West Palm -- Shiller, Hastings. \nRACINE I know of them. \nHARDIN I've arranged to have the use of their offices. I thought we might try to make it tomorrow, say ten o'clock. Would that be possible for you? \nRACINE Yes, I think so. \nHARDIN Good. Mrs. Walker told me she would be back down there by then.

I'll see you then. \nRACINE Right. \nHARDIN Good-bye. \n", "test3_true": "INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nRacine opens the door from his office. \nRACINE (to Beverly) Will you get me Mrs. Edmund Walker, please. \nBeverly wrinkles her brow, spins her Rolodex. \nBEVERLY I don't have her. Should I? \nRACINE I thought the temporary put her in. She came in while you were on vacation. Look it up. They were in Pinehaven, I think. \nHe closes the door to his office. \nINT.

Seated around the room are Matty, Roz Kraft, and much   to Racine's surprise, his friend Peter Lowenstein, Matty   is dressed in chic black, MILES HARDIN comes around the   big desk to shake Racine's hand. Hardin is an impressive    guy in a $500 suit. He greets Racine with icy eyes and a cordial look. \nHARDIN Miles Hardin, Mr. Racine. \nRACINE How are you? \nHARDIN I don't think you know Mrs. Kraft. \nRACINE (shakes her head) No.   I don't. My condolences. \nROZ Thank you. \nRacine comes up to Matty and takes her hand. \nRACINE Mrs. Walker, I'm very sorry about your husband. \nMATTY Thank you, Mr. Racine. \nHARDIN You know Mr. Lowenstein. \nThey shake and Lowenstein gives him a cheerful grin. \nRACINE Hello, Peter. \nLOWENSTEIN Hi, Ned. \nRacine shakes his hand. Hardin motions Racine into a chair and moves back around the desk. \nHARDIN I asked Mr. Lowenstein to join us because he's handling the inquiry into Edmund's death for the County Prosecutor's office. He and I have discussed this matter and he's made is possible for us to speak very frankly here today. Off the record, so to speak. (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               81. \nHARDIN (CONT'D) (to Racine) As I've told Mrs. Walker, I was more than a little surprised by the existence of this new will. Edmund hadn't mentioned anything about it to me. \nHardin looks at Racine a beat, but Racine has nothing to say. \nHARDIN Mrs. Walker explained to me that when she and her husband decided to make some minor changes, they just took care of it up here for simplicity's sake. And, indeed, as you know, the new will is almost identical to the old but for the disposition of a few items. (to the group in general) At the risk of oversimplifying, the thrust of the will is to divide the estate in almost equal parts between Heather Kraft and Mrs. Walker. Would you agree with that assessment, Mr. Racine? \nRacine nods. \nHARDIN Mmmm. And you witnessed the    signing by Edmund Walker along with   this Miss -- (glancing at papers on the desk) -- Mary Ann Simpson on July   twenty- first. Apparently, it will    be impossible for us to contact   Miss Simpson. \nMATTY Mary Ann is a lifelong   friend of mine. She  happened to   be visiting on her way to Europe.    I'm sure when she returns she'll get   in touch with me. \nRACINE (eyeing Hardin) Although it's certainly not required. The witnesses to the signing of a will are not commonly available when the will is entered into probate. It's not standard by any means. \nHardin glances at Lowenstein, who watches impassively. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               82. \nHARDIN Edmund Walker's death was not standard. \nROZ (to Hardin) Pardon me. I'm sorry. I'm confused. Is there some question about the authenticity of the will? \nRacine would like to kiss Roz; instead he turns with a questioning look to Hardin. \nRACINE I'm confused, too. Do you have a problem with the witnessing or the signatures? What is it you're getting at? \nHARDIN (almost wistful) No, there doesn't seem to be any problem here. This is Edmund Walker's last will and testament. I'm afraid the problem is elsewhere. \nHe reaches into his coat and brings out a gold cigar case. \nHARDIN Would anyone mind if I smoked? \n", "test3_id": 1907}

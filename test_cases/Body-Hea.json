NIGHT SKY \nFlames in the night sky. Distant SIRENS. PULLING BACK, we see that the burning building is mostly hidden by dense, black shapes that define the oceanside skyline of Miranda Beach, Florida. We're watching from across town. The sound of a bathroom SHOWER comes to a dripping stop at about the same time we see the naked back and head of NED RACINE. We continue to PULL BACK INTO -- \nRACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRacine, dressed in undershorts, is standing on the small porch off his apartment on the upper floor of an old house. Racine lights a cigarette and continues to stare off at the fire. We've passed him now, into the bedroom of the apartment, and the shape of a young woman, ANGELA, flashes by, drying her body with a towel. \nANGELA (O.S.) My God, it's hot. I stepped out of the shower and stared sweating again. ... It's still burning? Jesus, it's bigger! And I thought you were making me hear those sirens. (she giggles) What is it? \nRACINE The Seawater Inn. My family used to eat dinner there twenty-five years ago. Now somebody's torched it to clear the lot. \nAngela reappears briefly, gathering her clothes.   She sits on an unseen bed to get dressed. \nANGELA (O.S.) That's a shame. \nRACINE Probably one of my clients. \nANGELA (O.S.) I'm leaving. \nRACINE (back still turned) It's four a.m. \nOn the bed, Angela snaps on her bra. \nANGELA I go on duty at Miami Airport at seven. (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               2. \nANGELA (CONT'D) I wouldn't mind having breakfast... What do you care? You're watching the fire. You're done with me. I'm just getting into my uniform here... \nShe is, in fact, slipping on the blouse of her Avis Rent- a-Car uniform. There's a smile on her lips as she buttons up, watching Racine. \nANGELA You've had your fun. You're spent. (trying for a straight face) I'll just slip into my uniform here and slip away. \nRACINE My history's burning up out here. \nANGELA Hey, I don't mind. I'm leaving. Why do they make these damn skirts so hard to zip... \nNow, for the first time, Racine turns to look at   her. She is sitting on the edge of the bed, half into   her uniform. Racine smiles broadly at the  sight and   moves into the room. He pushes her back and  they both   disappear from sight, fabric rustling. \nRACINE Where's your hat? \nANGELA (O.S.) Hey... hey... (giggling) ... don't wrinkle it! \nRACINE (O.S.) 'You're spent.' Where'd you hear that? \nWe are left looking out over the porch at the night. And we go back there, across the rooftops, to the flames. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nAn Assistant County Prosecutor named PETER LOWENSTEIN has been conferring at the bench with JUDGE COSTANZA and now they both wait as Racine comes into view to join them. \nThe Judge is irritated. \nJUDGE COSTANZA Mr. Racine, I do no longer care whether these alleged toilets were (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             3. \nJUDGE COSTANZA (CONT'D) ever actually en route from Indiana or not. I think we're wasting our time here. It's pretty clear your client has attempted to defraud the county in a not very ingenious manner. (he nods at Lowenstein) The Assistant Prosecutor has made what I consider a generous offer. And given that you've failed to generate even the semblance of a defense -- \nRACINE Judge Costanza, perhaps when I've presented all -- \nJUDGE COSTANZA Yeah, yeah. If I were you, I'd recommend to your client that held quickly do as Mr. Lowenstein here has suggested -- plead nolo contendre, file Chapter Eleven and agree never to do business with Okeelanta County again. \nRacine is surprised and pleased. \nRACINE You would look favorably on that? \nJUDGE COSTANZA (nods) He can walk. But don't test my patience for even five more minutes. If he hesitates, I'll nail him. \nRACINE I'll talk to him. \nRacine starts to turn. \nMRS. SINGER Don't apologize. That's the kind of attitude you've got to have these days... \nEXT. THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHT \nThe hottest January in fifty years has brought the crowds to the beach in search of relief. But they've been disappointed. Even the breeze off the ocean seems blown from a hair dryer. Still, the nights are a trifle better and the Beachfront, the penny arcades, the ice cream stands and bars are busy, even now in the middle of the week. \nRacine comes out of a bar and lights a cigarette, idly watching the passing parade. There is a free band concert in progress at the band shell. Racine wanders in that direction. \nEXT. THE BAND SHELL - NIGHT \nThe Miranda Beach High School Orchestra is playing to a full, sweating house; the audience is a sea of orange programs fluttering away as fans. People come and go frequently. \nThe atmosphere is as innocent and informal as the music the band is playing now. \nRacine leans against the back rail, smoking, his eyes playing over the scene with no expectations. \nThen, down near the center aisle, a WOMAN rises. As the band plays on, this extraordinary, beautiful woman, in a simple white dress, moves down the aisle. She moves wonderfully. The dress clings to  her body in the heat. \nRacine watches, mesmerized, as she walks directly toward him. She passes within a few inches of him, her eyes lowered. Racine's body sways a moment as she goes by, as though buffeted by some force. But they do not touch. She goes out onto the Beachfront walkway. \nEXT. THE BEACHFRONT WALKWAY - NIGHT \nThe Woman, MATTY, has walked to the rail. She stands there now lighting a cigarette. She presents her face \nto the ocean, hoping for a breeze.    We move in on her, with Racine. \nRacine lights a new cigarette and smiles at her. She looks at him and, for an instant, her eyes race over his body, then she looks back at the ocean. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              8. \nRACINE You can stand here with me if you want, but you'll have to agree not to talk about the heat. \nShe looks at him, and there is something startling about the directness of her gaze. When she speaks, she is cool without being hostile. \nMATTY I'm a married woman. \nRACINE Meaning what? \nMATTY Meaning I'm not looking for company. \nShe turns back toward the ocean. \nRACINE Then you should have said -- 'I'm a happily married woman.' \nMATTY That's my business. \nRACINE What? \nMATTY How happy I am. \nRACINE And how, happy is that? \nShe looks at him curiously. She begins walking slowly along the rail. He walks too. \nMATTY You're not too smart, are you? \nRacine shakes his head \"no.\" \nMATTY I like that in a man. \nRACINE What else you like -- Ugly?   Lazy? Horny? I got 'em all. \nMATTY You don't look lazy. \nRacine smiles. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              9. \nMATTY Tell me, does chat like that work with most women? \nRACINE Some. If they haven't been around much. \nMATTY I wondered. Thought maybe I was out of touch. \nShe stops again at the rail as a small breeze blows in from the ocean. She turns her back to it and, with her cigarette dangling from her lips, she uses both hands to lift her hair up off her nape. She closes her eyes as the air hits her. Racine watches very closely. \nRACINE How 'bout I buy you a drink? \nMATTY I told you. I've got a husband. \nRACINE I'll buy him one too. \nMATTY He's out of town. \nRACINE My favorite kind. We'll drink to him. \nMATTY He only comes up on the weekends. \nMatty lets her hair fall and again begins moving down walkway. She drops her cigarette and steps on it. \nRACINE I'm liking him better all the time. You better take me up on this quick. In another forty-five minutes I'm going to give up and walk away. \nRacine is behind the desk. Occupying the two seats in front are a married couple rapidly approaching divorce. They are arguing now, each trying to convince Racine of their view. Racine nods occasionally, looking from one to the other. But he is also looking between them, through the open door out to the reception room, where his secretary Beverly is kneeling before the lowest drawer of a filing cabinet. Her back is turned and her jeans are tight across the bottom. There's nothing especially provocative about her pose. She's just there. Working away. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 13. \nRacine walks across his office and closes the door.   He goes back to his seat. The couple continues. \nEXT. THE BAND SHELL - NIGHT \nAnother concert going on, a trio   of musicians. Racine moves down the sidewalk away from   the audience. He looks around as he lights a cigarette.    She is nowhere in sight. Racine opens the door to his car,   a nicked-up red '64 Stingray. \nEXT. PINEHAVEN - DAY \nRacine drives past a neat sign -- \n\"You are entering PINEHAVEN Please drive carefully\" \nThere's money here. Many of the homes are not visible from the street -- only their gates announce their presence. Those that can be seen are sprawling and lavish. The Waterway appears to the left. A large white yacht cruises slowly by. \nINT. RACINE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nRacine sits in bed smoking a cigarette. At the mirror, a Nurse in a fresh white uniform steps into her white shoes and begins attaching her cap with bobby pins. \nINT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - PINEHAVEN - NIGHT \nDark. Almost classy. The place is half full. Matty is drinking at the end of the bar, her cigarettes next to her glass. The bar chairs near her are empty. \nRacine comes in, looks around, walks over and sits in the seat next to her. She looks up, surprised. \nMATTY Look who's here. Isn't this a coincidence? \nRacine looks at her, almost as though he can't place her. But he doesn't push that effect hard. He lights a cigarette. \nRACINE I know you. \nMATTY You're the one that doesn't want to talk about the heat. Too bad. I'd tell you about my chimes. \nRACINE What about them? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               14. \nMATTY The wind chimes on my porch. They keep ringing and I go out there expecting a cool breeze. That's what they've always meant. But not this summer, This summer it's just hot air. \nRACINE Do I remind you of hot air? \nThe Bartender has come up. \nRACINE Bourbon, any kind, on the rocks. (to Matty) Another? \nShe thinks, then nods her agreement.    The Bartender moves away. \nMATTY What are you doing in Pinehaven? \nRACINE I'm no yokel. Why, I was all the way to Miami once. \nMATTY There are some men, once they get a whiff of it, they'll trail you like a hound. \nThe Bartender brings their drinks and leaves. \nRACINE I'm not that eager. \nMATTY What is your name, anyway? \nRACINE (offers his hand) Ned Racine. \nMATTY Matty Walker. \nShe takes his hand and shakes it. Racine reacts strangely to her touch and doesn't let go right away. She gently frees it, then refers to his look as she picks up her drink -- \nRACINE Are you all right? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  15. \nMATTY (laughs) Yes. My temperature runs a couple degrees high. Around 100 all the time I don't mind it. It's the engine or something. \nRACINE Maybe you need a tune-up. \nMATTY Don't tell me -- you have just the right tool. \nRACINE I don't talk that way. \nMATTY How'd you find me, Ned? \nRacine gives her a look. \nRACINE This is the only joint in Pinehaven. \nMATTY How'd you know I drink? \nRACINE You seemed like a woman with all the vices. \nMATTY (smiles) You shouldn't have come. You're going to be disappointed. \nRacine agrees. Matty looks him over a moment, then turns to unlock the door. \nINT. ENTRY HALL/SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT \nMatty comes in and puts her purse on a hall table as Racine moves forward to look around. Despite the night gloom, it's clear the place is expensively decorated in a manner entirely consistent with the exterior of the house. Fine antiques, carefully chosen fabrics, and a meticulous selection of accessories have given the place the look of an affluent home of Thirties America. And yet the overall effect is almost contemporary, so burnished are the woods, so fresh all the elements. It works. \nRACINE Just like my place. \nMatty gives him a searching look, then      leads   him up the stairs, flipping on only an occasional      light   in their path. In the second floor hall, Matty       moves   to the front of the house. Racine glances into the       gloom   that hides Matty's bedroom. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              19. \nRACINE No help? \nMATTY She goes home nights. \nRACINE You're not nervous alone? \nMatty pauses at the doors to the porch, unlocking them, and looks at Racine as though she barely understands the question. \nMATTY No. \nEXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH - NIGHT \nThe TINKLING is distinct out here. Matty and Racine come out onto the porch. There are about thirty wind chimes of various, lovely designs -- crystal, metal, wood hanging at intervals from the rim of the wide porch awning, completely encircling Matty and Racine. \nHalfway down the long lawn is a white gazebo. Beyond it, the waterway is shimmering in the moonlight. At the edge of the water is a small boat house. \nRacine walks along under the chimes, looking up at them. A smile plays across her face. He looks back at Matty, \nRACINE You do have chimes. \nHe looks out at the boat house. \nRACINE What's that? \nMATTY A gazebo \nRACINE No, out there. \nMATTY Boat house. \nRACINE What is in there? \nMATTY Boat. \nRacine moves back and stands very close to her. He looks at her in the moonlight, but she concentrates on the distant water. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 20. \nMATTY It's a mess. There's a row boat, a lot of lounge chairs... things like that. \nRacine puts his hand up under her hair, on her nape. She closes her eyes at his touch, then moves away, as though by an act, of will, to the door, half opening it. \nMATTY I think you should go now. \nRACINE I just got here. \nMATTY You've seen them. Please go. \nRacine steps toward her, but she ducks inside and moves through the intermittent light of the hall and down the steps. Racine follows her. \nINT. ENTRY HALL \nMatty stops at the entry hall, leaning against the wall. \nRACINE You didn't bring me here to see your wind chimes. \nHe puts an arm on each side of her, caging her against the wall. She looks up at him. \nMATTY Yes, I did. I said what I meant. Do you ever do that? \nRACINE No.     not very often. \nHe kisses her light on the forehead.   Again she reacts, but fights it. \nRACINE I don't think you want me to go. \nMATTY Yes... Please. \nHe kisses her lightly on the nose. \nRACINE There's nothing to be afraid of. \nMATTY There is for me. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                21. \nMatty slips under his arms and quickly steps out the front door. She stands just outside watching him. Racine shakes his head, goes out there. \nEXT. FRONT TERRACE - NIGHT \nRACINE (reacting) Hey, gimme a break here.    It takes a little while. \nMATTY (ignoring him, laughs) It's your fault. \nRACINE (smiling) It takes me a good thirty seconds. \nMATTY Are you sure?    I just want to make sure here. \nShe pulls him down. \nOn the lounge cushions that are spread across the floor, Matty rolls on top of Racine. Racine reacts with exaggerated pain to the roughness of the cushions. \nRACINE Jesus, I think you're right -- (he rolls over her) -- you better be on the bottom. \nMATTY No, you misunderstood -- (she rolls over him) -- this is my new saddle, and I just want to -- \nRACINE Wow!   No, I must object -- \nLaughing, they roll again and we're on Racine's face as we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRacine's face; he is still rolling, but he is alone. He has just rolled off the bed. He lies there like a dead man. \nRACINE (finally, breathless) Enough. \nINT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT \nRacine is at the sink, having just washed his tired face. He opens the medicine cabinet and looks at all the \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               25. \ntoiletries of Matty's husband. He selects a cologne, is impressed by its expensive look, and slaps a little on his jaw.  He doesn't like the smell. He closes the cabinet and moves back into the bedroom. \nINT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMatty, wrapped in a thin white terrycloth robe, is stripping the bed of its sheets. Racine watches from across the room. \nRACINE What are you doing? \nMATTY I've got to wash these. \nRACINE You're afraid of your maid? \nMATTY That's right. My mother told me \"knowledge is power.\" \nRACINE This is an interesting interpretation. Is that why you've started smoking my brand? \nMatty straightens with an armload of sheets. \nMATTY No one must know. Promise me, Ned. No one. \nHe promise with a gesture. \nINT. RACINE'S APARTMENT - DAWN \nRacine comes in, beat. He throws his jacket across a chair. Out the windows to the porch, the sun is rising out of the Atlantic. Racine goes there and closes the curtains. In the gloom he walks to his bed and sits on the edge, kicking off his shoes. He picks up his alarm clock and begins setting it. \nEXT. WALKER HOUSE - LAWN/GAZEBO - NIGHT \nRacine has just parked his car and is walking back across the lawn. Matty is standing in the gazebo, her back turned, looking out at the Waterway. \nShe is dressed in white and from here she looks very much as she did when they first met. There are wind chimes hanging from the gazebo. \nRACINE Hey, lady, wanna make love? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              26. \nThe lady in question turns around, surprised. It is not Matty at all. It is MARY ANN. She's attractive, but a little cheap-looking. She looks him over. \nMARY ANN I don't know. Maybe This sure is a friendly town. \nRacine is nonplussed.   He doesn't know what to do. \nRACINE I'm sorry. \nMARY ANN (mock hurt feelings) You are? You mean the offers no good? \nRacine comes up on the porch. \nRACINE I feel like a jerk. \nMary Ann gives him a salacious smile. \nMARY ANN Maybe you were supposed to deliver it next door? (a beat) You must be looking for the lady of the house. \nUnbeknownst to either of them, Matty has been watching from the lawn. Now she moves up into the gazebo. In her right hand she has an envelope, well-filled and sealed. \nEXT. INTERSECTION \nHe takes a big bite of pie. \nLOWENSTEIN Oscar, I just don't understand how you could be doing advanced theoretical thinking like that and still be stuck working in our little town. \nGRACE (good-humored) Lowenstein dreams of bigger things. \nLOWENSTEIN Assistant County Prosecutor isn't the end for me, fellows. \nRACINE Hell, no. Someday -- Deputy County Prosecutor. \nLOWENSTEIN When the truth comes out about some of the dirt I've been involved in, (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                36. \nLOWENSTEIN (CONT'D) my future in this state will be unlimited. \nGlenda the Meter Maid passes their table on her way out. She has eyes only for Racine. \nGLENDA Hello, Ned. \nRACINE Hi, Glenda. \nShe goes out. Lowenstein and Grace look at Racine, then at each other. Grace smiles hugely. \nEXT. LIGHTHOUSE/SAND DUNES - NIGHT \nThe big beacon turns in the distance, throwing an intermittent bridge of light across the water toward us. \nThe undulating dunes stretch off as far as we can see. Racine's Stingray is parked on the dirt access road. Below it, Racine and Matty sit close in the warm sand. \nMATTY Don't say it, if you don't mean it. Please, Ned, don't. \nRACINE I do. I want you with me. \nShe looks at him a long time. There is real joy in her face. And tears in her eyes. We're very close to those eyes as she wipes the tears away. Racine puts an arm around her. She looks out at the lighthouse. \nMATTY I'm going to tell Edmund I want a divorce. I won't stay any longer. I would have, if you hadn't come along. The life is comfortable. I was willing to go on. But you've reminded me of what it can be... I know now that these last three years I've been living half a life. It's my fault, I don't deny it. You have to let yourself be bought. I did. I let it happen. I've lived so much of my life with nothing. When you have no money, you have no choices. I don't care what they say -- money is freedom. That's something they don't teach you in school. But I found out. And when Edmund came along when I saw a chance to stop struggling I took it. I'm not ashamed. (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org          37. \nMATTY (CONT'D) He got   what he wanted... he has a knack   for that. But no more. I'm ready   to walk away from the money. I have   to be with you. \nRACINE (kisses her, smiles) It is conceivable I'll make a buck someday. \nMATTY (hugs him closer) Oh, I know you will, darling. I didn't mean that. I know you will. But it doesn't matter. It's you I want. That's all. \nRACINE Anyway, you'll come out all right. \nMATTY Of the divorce? \nRACINE Yeah.    He's ripe. \nMatty is silent for a long beat. \nMATTY No.   I signed a pre-nuptial agreement. \nRACINE What? \nMATTY He insisted. He blamed it on his sister Roz -- she's always hated me -- but I know he wanted it too. \nRACINE How is it? \nMATTY Bad. I get some money for a year. Not much. That's it. But I don't care, Ned. Not if I can be with you. \nShe searches his face, almost frightened. \nMATTY Does it matter, Ned? Tell me the truth please. I'll understand, I swear to you. \nRACINE The truth? I wish you were going to be loaded. Does it matter? No. No. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               38. \nThey kiss. \nMATTY God, you've made me happy. (she pulls away) It's time for your present. \nShe jumps up and runs back to the car. Racine walks back there as Matty takes a wrapped package out of the car. She hands it to Racine, who leans against the car to unwrap it. \nMATTY From now on, when it starts coming down on you, I'll be there to protect you. \nRacine opens the box and smiles broadly. It is a hat a fedora in the classic style. \nMATTY Put it on! I'll bet I guessed the size right. \nRacine puts on the fedora. It fits. He looks simultaneously old-fashioned, a visitor from the Forties, and also very chic, a present-day fashion plate. But most of all, he looks exactly right. Matty squeals in glee at the sight. \nMATTY I love it. \nRACINE I want to see. \nRacine tries to see his reflection in the car's side view mirror but he has trouble. Matty, very animated in her delight, steps up and kisses him quickly. \nMATTY (shrugs) Edmund mentioned it once. \nRacine lights another cigarette and gazes off into the fog, thinking. Matty presses her cheek against his chest and closes her eyes tight. \nMATTY Ned, it scares me to talk about these things. \nRACINE Why? \nMATTY You know. \nRACINE No.    I don't. \nMATTY Let's just not, okay? Let's not think about all he's got. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                42. \nRACINE (pressing) What is it, Matty? Tell me exactly what frightens you. \nMATTY I'm afraid... because when I think about it, I wish that he'd die. That's really what I want. It's horrible and ugly and It's what I most want. \nRacine looks off into the night for a few beats, then he lifts her face so he can look into her eyes. \nRACINE That's where we're at, isn't it, Matty? \nMATTY What do you mean? \nRACINE That's what we're both thinking -- how good it'd be for us if he were gone. It'd be real sweet for us. \nMATTY Don't talk about it, Ned. Please don't. Talk is dangerous. Sometimes it makes things happen, it makes it real. \nRACINE Don't let it scare you. Because he's not gonna die. There's nothing wrong with him, is there? There's no reason to think he's gonna die, is there? \nMatty shakes her head \"no,\" lays it in his chest again. \nRACINE That's right. So we might as well forget about it, It's not gonna just happen to make things nice for us... It won't just happen. \nRacine lifts her head and kisses her on the mouth. \nMATTY I'm afraid, Ned. \nRACINE Maybe that's a smart way to be now, Matty. Maybe we both should be. \nRacine takes a last drag on his cigarette and flicks it out into the fog, \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                43. \nRACINE The only thing wrong with your husband right now... is us. \nINT. BAR - PAY PHONE AT BACK \nAgain, Racine is getting no answer.   He gives up, goes back to his seat at the bar. \nEXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - MAIN STREET - DAY \nLate afternoon. Racine, sportcoat slung over his shoulder, listens to repeated ringing at the other end of his call. He's surprised there's no answer. People drag by, making their way home from work in the heat. Finally, Racine hangs up. \nRacine comes out of the phone booth. He has nowhere to go. He ambles down the street. A few people say hello. He walks diagonally across the street toward a restaurant called \"Tulio's.\" \nINT. TULIO'S RESTAURANT - DUSK \nThe best restaurant in Miranda Beach. Racine slips on his jacket as he comes in the door. He waves to the Hostess across the dining room, indicating he'll be alone tonight. She signals a short wait. He steps toward the bar, bringing him suddenly face to face with Matty. \nRACINE Well, well.   Hello to you -- \nThe panic which shoots across her face, cuts him off in mid-sentence, a split second before EDMUND WALKER appears behind her. Matty's face goes calm and she smiles politely. \nMATTY (to Racine) Hello. \nShe turns to her husband. He is not what Racine expected. He may, in fact, be mean, as Matty described him, but he looks neither small nor weak. A handsome man, he is bigger than Racine and in terrific shape. Dressed in an expensive summer suit, he radiates vigor and controlled physical power. He wears sleek, metal-framed glasses. \nMATTY Darling, I'd like you to meet Mr. Racine. I'm sorry. I don't know your first name. \nRACINE Ned. \nHe offers his hand and Walker encloses it firmly in his. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                44. \nWALKER Edmund Walker.    Nice to meet you. \nMATTY Mr. Racine is the lawyer I told you about. (Walker doesn't remember) You remember. He had a client who wanted to buy the house. I told him we weren't selling. \nWALKER Right. \nRACINE That hasn't changed, has it? \nWALKER No, we're very happy with it. \nRACINE (nods) I can understand that.    It's a terrific place. \nWalker nods, looking at Racine carefully.    He motions toward the dining room. \nWalker looks at Racine and laughs. As he begins to speak, he focuses intently on Racine. He seems to be trying to communicate something other than what he's saying. \nWALKER You wouldn't believe the dorkus she was with when I met her. The guy came to us with a business proposition. We're always looking for opportunities. If the conditions are right. We're willing to take an occasional risk, if the downside isn't too steep. But this guy hadn't done his homework, he didn't know the bottom line. That's how I knew he was full of shit. You've got to know the bottom line. That's all that really counts. \nAgain Walker takes off his glasses. He holds them up to the light and then rubs them again with his handkerchief. \nWALKER He didn't have the goods,  this guy. He was like a lot of guys  you run into -- they want to get  rich, they want to do it quick, they  want to be there with one score. \nHe puts his glasses back on, stares at Racine. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              48. \nWALKER But they're not willing to do what's necessary. Do you know what I mean? \nRacine looks at him in silence for a moment. \nRACINE I'm not sure. You mean, lay the groundwork? Earn it? \nWALKER No. I mean do what's necessary. Whatever's necessary. \nThe two men stare at each other a few beats. \nRACINE Yeah. I know that kind of guy. I can't stand that. It makes me sick. \nWALKER Me too. \nRACINE I'm not like that. \nWalker ROARS with laughter. A huge, powerful burst that shakes the table. And Racine laughs with him. \nEXT. WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nMatty's bedroom window, from a distance.  The light goes out, Racine is watching from the shadows of the gazebo. He stares up there. The TINKLING of the  wind chimes rises and rises. It crests and begins to fade,  replaced by the WHOOSHING. \nEXT. BEACH - DAWN \nRacine runs south along the beach. The WHOOSHING slows. He is looking at something. He takes out his cigarettes as he slows to a walk. When he is directly across from what he's staring at, he sits in the sand, He lights up. \nRACINE'S POV - \"THE BREAKERS,\" an ancient wooden beach hotel, of medium size, sits at the edge of the beach. It is closed down, boarded up, deteriorating horribly in the ocean air. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nLunchtime. Racine is headed toward his office, briefcase in hand. Beverly appears out of the noon crush; she's going the other way in a hurry. \nBEVERLY There are some messages on your desk. Be back in an hour. Got to run. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               49. \nINT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY \nRacine comes into the reception room from the hall. He's surprised the door is unlocked. He crosses the room and opens the door to his office. \nMatty is sitting in one of the chairs in front of his desk. She jumps up at the sight of him and moves up to embrace him. \nRACINE Jesus!    Did Beverly see you? \nMatty kisses him on the mouth, then shakes her head \"no.\" \nMATTY I waited till I saw her leave.      Please don't be angry with me. \nRACINE Angry? I'm not angry -- How'd you get in? \nMATTY It didn't lock. Oh. Ned, hold me. Please just hold me, God, I love you. \nRacine reaches over and locks the door to his office. \nMATTY He left this morning.      I had to see you. \nRACINE (kissing her) I know. \nMATTY I couldn't call. I'm afraid to call. I was afraid you wouldn't let me come. \nRACINE Yes, that's right. You can't call. Never call. We have to be very careful now about the phone. The phone company keeps records. \nMATTY I'm careful. I hated it, Ned. I hated sitting there with the two of you. I thought I was going to scream. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              50. \nRACINE (distracted, thinking) You did good. (finds his thought) You've called my apartment from the house. \nMATTY No, never. \nRACINE No?   Those two times -- \nMATTY I went to phone booths. I'm afraid of him, Ned. I'm always afraid. \nRACINE That's good. We have to be careful about the phones now. \nMATTY Why, Ned, why do you say this now? \nRACINE (in his own thoughts) We could account for a couple calls. We've had some contact. That would make sense. \nMATTY I don't know why he's so crazy about her. Maybe because he never had any of his own. She's a cute little girl, all right, but other than that... I know this, though, her mother has worked plenty hard to keep Heather on Edmund's mind, Always bringing her around, reporting everything she does in school. That Roz is a smart one. And you know that anything Heather inherits goes straight to Roz. Heather won't even get a look at it. That's the part I can't stand. That's why it seems so wrong to have half of it go to her. \nShe hands him his glass and stands next to him, her hand playing with his hair. \nRACINE That's the way it is.       There's nothing we can do about it. \nShe kneels beside him. \nMATTY Are you sure, Ned? I've been thinking about it. Maybe there is. The will is with his lawyer in Miami I know that. What if I could get him to bring it home? He did it once, he'd do it again. If I could swing it, couldn't we rewrite it? Change it. Then when he dies, I could find the new one. We could just change it a little. Every little change would mean a lot to us, End. You're a lawyer. You know how to write it. It wouldn't seem so odd. I could say he brought it home and we talked about it and decided to make some changes up here. And I knew you already -- \nRacine is shaking his head. \nRACINE No.   Forget it. \nMATTY I just don't see why Heather should take half -- \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                55. \nRacine puts down his drink and turns to look down at her. \nRACINE Listen to me, Matty. Nothing strange can happen in his life right now, not one thing out of the ordinary. That's vital, that's the main thing. If anything does, the chances double that we get caught. You and I are walking out there on the edge every second now. One false move and we're gonna fall off. It'll be all over. You've got to remember that all the time. (he studies her face) You'll get half of everything and it'll be plenty. No matter what it is, we're gonna be satisfied. We're not gonna get greedy. If we do, we'll get burned. You gotta believe me, baby, the odds that we'll get burned are good enough without looking for trouble. \nShe studies him with frightened eyes, then nods her agreement and lays her hand in his lap. \nMATTY You're right, darling.   I'm sorry. I know you're right. \nEXT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - NIGHT \nMiddle of the night. No one in sight. Now comes the only movement -- a Miranda Beach Police Patrol Car drives slowly up the street next to the old hotel and turns south on Ocean Avenue. When it is gone, all is dead again. \nEXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT \nRacine has   watched the patrol car from the  darkness of the beach.   Now he sits in the sand again,  his back against the raised   bank of sand on which he runs.   He lights a flashlight   and makes a notation in a small  notepad. \nINT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - NIGHT \nRacine's footsteps creak through the blackness. Then his flashlight reveals a corridor in the crumbling basement of the old hotel. Racine is not the first to have violated the premises -- scattered about are beer cans, whiskey bottles, beds made of newspapers, the remains of food. Rats CHITTER and scamper in the shadows. A lizard scoots over the pipes. \nRacine goes through a doorway and is in what used to be a supply area at the bottom of a stairway. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                56. \nScattered about are empty wooden food crates. The walls are lined with tall wooden shelves; one of these units is tipped over across the room, Racine shines his light in that direction and sees what caused the shelves to fall. One of the beams which cross the ceiling has rotted loose and dropped one end to the floor. \nRacine has found what he wanted. \nEXT. WALKER HOUSE - PARKING AREA - MIGHT \nWe're CLOSE ON RACINE'S WATCH; it reads 2:30. \nRACINE Okay.   Gotta go. \nRacine, at the wheel of the Stingray is looking at his watch. Matty is leaning down to the window dressed only in a robe. \nMATTY Be careful. \nRACINE I'm just going for a ride.   I wish it was all this dangerous. \nShe kisses him deeply. \nMATTY I love you. \nHe looks at his watch again and pulls away.     Matty stands watching. \nEXT. FROM PINEHAVEN TO \"THE BREAKERS\" - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT \nRacine drives his murder route. The roads are almost totally deserted. Intermittently he passes signs welcoming him to the towns as he travels south. \nA. The first stretch of his trip, Racine travels on a deserted back road with overhanging trees. A Teenage Hotrodder passes him and he is alone again. As he turns off the road, he checks his watch. B. He drives through a neighborhood of neat houses. No life. C. He turns onto a four line interstate. More traffic here -- long haul truckers, late night drinkers. D. He drives across a graceful drawbridge, rimmed by lights, over a canal. E. He drives toward the ocean beside a pretty lake in a park. A patrol car passes the other way. Racine checks his watch. F. At \"The Breakers.\" Racine follows the same path as the police car he'd watched. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  57. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VISITING ROOM - DAY \nA seedy-looking Thief is brought out of the visiting room by a Uniformed Deputy, followed by Racine, briefcase in hand. Racine shakes the Thief's hand. The Deputy leads the Thief away down the hall. Racine glances at his departing client, then heads in the other direction. Before he has gone too far a heavy, metal, barred door at the other end swallows up the Thief with a piercing CLANG! Racine jumps. He puts a hand against the wall. \nINT. BED - MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRacine and Matty, just their heads on one pillow, inches apart. They look at each other in silence. Finally -- \nRACINE And? \nMATTY The side door. \nRACINE And? \nMATTY Two A.M. I send him down. \nRACINE We won't talk again after     I leave here tonight. I'll be in      Miami by noon Friday. You won't be      able to reach me. When I see you      again, he'll be dead. \nMatty nods.   She begins to cry.     Racine touches her. \nMatty's face, her head on a pillow, turned away from her husband, away from the bedroom door. Her look is just as intense as Racine's. Her eyes are focused on - \nAn alarm clock on the nightstand -- 1:15. \nThere is the SOUND of a car somewhere outside and Matty reacts to it silently. She listens with her whole being. The wind chimes TINKLE. \nEXT. SIDE DOOR - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nRacine's hand takes hold of the doorknob. He tries it. It won't open. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                60. \nRacine's face. Puzzled. He gives an irritated glance upward. Then he moves along the wall. \nINT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe alarm clock -- 1:42. \nMatty watches. Matty listens. She tries to confirm that Walker is sleeping without looking there. Matty begins to move her legs slowly toward the side of the bed, to get out. \nSuddenly, the bed lurches. Matty gasps and whips her head around to look. Edmund is standing next to his side of the bed in his undershorts. He puts on his glasses and looks at her. \nWALKER Jesus, take it easy. I thought I was tense. \nMATTY What are you doing? \nWALKER I can't sleep. I'm going down and get something to drink. \nMatty watches with panicky eyes as Edmund moves toward door. When she speaks, her voice is different, husky. \nMATTY Edmund. \nHe turns to look at her.   She moves once on the bed, languidly. \nMATTY I can't sleep, either. \nHe peers at her in the darkness. \nMATTY Lock the door, darling. \nEdmund studies her, then walks over and locks the door. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nEdmund's alarm clock - 2:05. Edmund rolls into view, his breath ragged. Matty's hand is on his chest. \nEdmund looks at her and laughs. \nWALKER You trying to kill me? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                61. \nMatty, flat on her back, smiles weakly and looks at the ceiling. Again, the mattress moves. She looks at Edmund. He has pulled on his shorts and is walking toward the bathroom. \nWALKER I'm going downstairs.     Do you want anything? \nHe disappears into the bathroom. Matty slips out of bed. She is wearing a silky nightgown. She hurries to the bedroom door. \nMATTY (calling softly to him) I'll go down with you. \nShe opens the door and steps into the hall. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT \nMatty looks across the hall toward the open door to the guest room; it is dark. She hurries to the stairs, peering down into the darkness. She starts down the steps. \nINT. FIRST FLOOR HALL - NIGHT \nMATTY'S POV as she comes down the steps. Each shadow, doorway, and alcove threatens to erupt with life. \nMatty reaches the bottom of the stairs and peers around. She starts back along the dark hall of the house just as Edmund comes out of the bedroom upstairs; he is still in his undershorts. He reaches the top of the stairs as Matty moves back along the hall. The alcove under the stairs is in black shadow. Matty is focused on it. \nJust as she reaches it, the lights in the hall snap on. Racine is standing under the stairs, poised to strike the figure in the hall with a heavy wooden plank about two feet long. Matty gasps at the sight, but it is covered by -- \nWALKER (at the top of the stairs) Christ, woman, did you ever hear of turning on the lights? \nRacine doesn't breathe. Matty is frozen in the spot, directly in front of Racine and five feet below Edmund, who now starts down the steps. \nMATTY Edmund... wait! \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                62. \nWALKER (stops) What is it? \nMATTY (whispering up at him) Put on a robe or something. What if Heather wakes up and comes down. \nEdmund frowns, goes back up the stairs. \nWALKER (grumbling) Damn. She's not going to wake up at 2 o'clock in the morning... \nRacine's face. He knows that for the first time in his life, he's really done it. There's no turning back. \nRacine does something that he's going to be doing for the rest of his life. He looks in the rear view mirror. \nINT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT \nEverything is as Racine left it. Edmund's body lies beneath the beam. It is barely discernible in the gloom. The only bright spot in the room is the incendiary device, its shiny surface catching some errant sliver of light. \nAnd then it explodes with a harsh SHRIEK. And the light of the magnesium chips is white, blinding. The chips are out in all directions to the waiting puddles of gasoline. The light goes from white to yellow as huge flames engulf the room. The flames ROAR. We watch them for a few moments and then -- \nSLOWLY DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nMatty stands in the FOG, one arm wrapped around a post of the porch. Above her the wind chimes TINKLE. She struggles to hear something else. Finally she does hear it and her face relaxes and she looks at peace. Listening to soft, distant SIRENS. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                77. \nFADE IN: \nINT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe fedora hangs on the coatstand. Racine works at his desk, reading over a long contract. The sun is cutting through the Venetian blinds behind him in glaring strips and, as he leans back in his chair, he finds it impossible to read his document. He gets up, goes to the window and adjusts the blinds so that his desk goes dark in the shade. As it does, the PHONE RINGS. Beverly answers out in the reception room, her conversation muffled through the slightly cracked door. She hits a hold button and yells, as is her informal custom. \nBEVERLY Ned.   Miles Hardin. Do you want him? \nRACINE Who is he? \nBEVERLY She says he's a lawyer from Miami. \nRacine picks up his phone. \nRACINE Hello. \nSECRETARY (filtered) Mr. Ned Racine? \nRACINE Yes. \nSECRETARY Miles Hardin calling. \nThe Secretary goes off and Racine is left holding. He waits five long beats and seems about to hang up when a Voice comes on, very dry and cold. \nHARDIN (filtered throughout) Mr. Racine. \nRACINE Yes. \nHARDIN This is Miles Hardin of Morris and Dale in Miami. \nRACINE Yes. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                78. \nHARDIN As you know, we represented Edmund Walker. \nRACINE Yes. \nHardin seems to expect more of a response.    Racine is silent. \nHARDIN Yes, well, Mrs. Walker has submitted the new will you wrote up there. \nRacine closes his eyes for a moment. The blood drains out of his face. He puts a hand out toward his desk. \nRACINE Yes...    I see. \nHARDIN And frankly, Mr. Racine, I think we may have a problem. \nRACINE Uh-huh.    What problem is that? \nHARDIN Well, I'd   rather discuss  it in person. In fact I   think it might  be best if we could   all get together  down there. That is,   if you wouldn't  object. \nRACINE No no, that would be all right. \nHARDIN Good. We have a relationship with a firm in West Palm -- Shiller, Hastings. \nRACINE I know of them. \nHARDIN I've arranged to have the use of their offices. I thought we might try to make it tomorrow, say ten o'clock. Would that be possible for you? \nRACINE Yes, I think so. \nHARDIN Good. Mrs. Walker told me she would be back down there by then. (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 79. \nHARDIN (CONT'D) And I've asked Mrs. Kraft, Mr. Walker's sister, to join us, also. I'll see you then. \nRACINE Right. \nHARDIN Good-bye. \nNo one does. In fact, Racine, Matty and Roz all immediately produce their own packs of cigarettes. The effect is comical and everyone in the room laughs at the group reflex. Roz notices that Lowenstein is not lighting up and offers him one of hers. \nLOWENSTEIN I don't need my own. I'll just breathe the air. \nRoz smiles and tilts her head to blow a stream of smoke toward the ceiling. We TILT UP with it as the white smoke intrudes the clear air and -- \nWIPE TO: \nThe same space, thick with smoke, and TILT DOWN to the assembled group, all of whom are focused on Hardin, except for Lowenstein, whose glance dances about the rapt faces. \nHARDIN Everything's in order up to there. The problem comes in the language of the bequest to Heather. It's a technical matter. (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               83. \nHARDIN (CONT'D) In writing the will, I'm afraid Mr. Racine violated what's known as \"the rule against perpetuities. \nHardin watches Racine, who reacts minutely. \nHARDIN It's a small thing, but it's the law. It forbids an inheritance to be passed down indefinitely for generations. Many general practitioner lawyers don't fully understand it. It doesn't come up much for them, because wills this complex are usually handled by estate departments in larger firms. Handled by lawyers who specialize in this type of work. \nMatty turns a confused look to Roz who returns it sympathetically. Hardin notes it. \nHARDIN I know this is terribly confusing, but if you'll bear with me... I spotted the problem right away, but since Edmund's intent was clear, I thought it in everyone's best interest to try and get the will admitted into probate anyway, even though it was technically incorrect. I knew that a probate judge in Miami would spot the mistake right away. That's all they do all day, they're expert. So I thought I'd bring it up here to Okeelanta County -- since Edmund had the residence here -- and see if I could get lucky with a judge who didn't know estate law quite so well... (dryly, he can't resist) Perhaps find one with the same kind of training as Mr. Racine. \nRacine watches him, his mind racing ahead too fast to bother being insulted. Lowenstein can't help a small, wincing smile. Now Hardin gets to his payoff and there is no amusement in his tone. \nHARDIN Unfortunately, my plan backfired. I ran into a judge who'd had other dealings with Mr. Racine. A Judge Costanza. (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                84. \nHARDIN (CONT'D) In fact, it seems there were problems with an estate in a case four years ago. Very different problems, it's true. But on a will Mr. Racine prepared. It was quite a mess. Accusations of carelessness, a malpractice suit... (to Racine) I think he called it the Gourson case? \nRacine watches him dully, then concentrates on taking out a cigarette. \nROZ Once again, Mr. Hardin, you've lost me. \nMATTY Yes, what does all this mean? \nHARDIN It means, I'm afraid, that Edmund's will is invalid. Edmund Walker died interstate, as though there were no will at all. \nRoz looks at Matty with panicky eyes. \nMATTY So... what happens now? \nHardin looks her over coldly.    He doesn't believe she doesn't know, \nHARDIN You don't know? \nMATTY (irritated) No, I don't. \nHARDIN Perhaps Mr. Racine would like to tell you. \nRacine is recovering. He gives Hardin a quick, ugly look, then turns toward Matty, and speaks quietly. \nRACINE In the state of Florida, when a person dies without a will, and there are no children and no surviving parents, then the spouse inherits everything. \nIt seems to take a long moment for Matty to fully digest this. It takes not quite as long for Roz. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  85. \nHer face goes through several transformations: confusion to disbelief to despair, then on in the direction of outrage. \nLowenstein's eyes are flashing around at the faces.    He seems genuinely amused. \nMATTY My god.   You mean... it's all mine? \nHardin is an unconvinced audience.   He nods. \nHARDIN Though that was clearly not your husband's intention. \nMATTY My god. \nHARDIN He intended Heather to benefit -- \nMATTY (looking between Hardin and Roz) Of course, of course, I understand. Of course. \nHARDIN As you can imagine, Mrs. Walkers given the circumstances of Edmund's death, none of this is going to happen... how should I say it... simply. \nMatty seems still in shook. \nMATTY ... Of course... \nEXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND SHILLER, HASTINGS (WEST PALM BEACH) - DAY \nMatty, Racine, Roz, Lowenstein and Hardin stand talking in a little cluster near the building. They say their good-byes with much handshaking. Matty lays a reassuring hand on Roz's arm and kisses her on the cheek. As she breaks from the crowd, Racine walks with her. The others stand talking a little longer. Racine takes off his jacket in the blazing Heat. He is very aware of the little group behind them as he walks with Matty to her Mercedes. When they are out of earshot -- \nRACINE You look good in black. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                86. \nMATTY I've missed you so badly.   I need you. \nGRACE What was this Simpson's story? \nRACINE I don't know... old friend of theirs, good-looking broad. She was just passing through. \nGRACE On her way to Europe? \nRacine shrugs, he doesn't know. \nGRACE The passport people can't find any record of that. \nLowenstein and Grace look at him a long time. \nGRACE What do you think? About the wife? \nRacine considers a moment. \nRACINE I suppose it's possible. I don't know much about her, except -- (he grins) -- what I've seen. Wouldn't shock me, either way. \nLOWENSTEIN I've got a feeling she's very bad news. Take some incredibly intelligent advice and stay away from her. \nGRACE He's right for once. \nThey both get up to leave. Racine watches from the chair. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                90. \nRACINE Well, I'm sorry, guys.    I'm afraid I can't do that. \nGRACE Why not? \nRACINE First of all, did you get a look at her? \nThey did. Racine grins. He stands up and comes right up to them. \nRACINE That wouldn't be quite so meaningful, except that today she started coming on to me. And maybe you haven't heard but the lady is about to come into a great deal of money. \nThey look at him with some concern. \nRACINE The fact   is, she's invited me out to her place   tonight. And I'm going. And I'll   keep on going as many nights, or days,   or weekends, as she'll have me. \nLOWENSTEIN Ned, that lady may have just killed her husband. \nRacine smiles cheerfully and puts a reassuring arm around Lowenstein's shoulder, leading him to the door. \nRACINE Peter, she's not gonna inherit anything by killing me. \nLowenstein is out the door now. He looks at Racine in wonder. He shakes his head and goes down the steps. Racine turns, smiling, to Grace, but Oscar is grim. \nGRACE Ned, you've messed up before. You'll mess up again. That's your nature. But they've always been small-time. This might not be. She's trouble, Ned. The real thing. Big-time, major league trouble. Watch yourself. \nRacine reassures his friend with touch and Oscar leaves. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                91. \nINT. WALKER HOUSE - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT \nMatty closes the front door behind Racine and wraps her arms around him. She kisses him hard and long on the mouth, then starts on his neck. He begins to push her away but she clings to him, eating him up. \nMATTY I know. I know. I know you'd probably like to kill me. I know. But please... you can hate me... punish me... hurt me if you want, but don't talk yet. \nShe takes his hand and drags him to the steps and leads the way up, her eyes on him always. \nMATTY Please, Ned. \nHe lets her lead him up the stairs. \nINT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThey lie in bed. The wind chimes TINKLE outside. \nMATTY ... Mary Ann and I left Wheaton together and went to Chicago. We didn't know what we were doing. I got in bad trouble with drugs. Speed. Really bad. I did things... (she looks up at him) Whatever's the evilest thing you can think of me now, I did worse things then. There's nothing lower than the animal I was then. Worse than you can imagine. I thought I would die. I prayed I would... And then a man helped me. He got me clean. He didn't want much in return, either... He was a lawyer and he put me to work in his office. I learned a lot there. One time I even thought I might go to law school. ... That's where I picked up the business about making a will invalid. That happened to him once. I swear I would never have used that if I'd known about your case... I was afraid to tell you, Ned. I knew you wouldn't let me do it. I'm greedy, like you said. I wanted us to have it all. \nShe moves up over him and looks into his face. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 92. \nMATTY I don't blame you for thinking I'm bad. I am. I know it. I'd understand if you just cut me off now. If you never trusted me again. You'd probably be smart. But you must believe one thing. I love you. I love you and need you. I want to be with you forever. \nShe puts her head on his chest as Racine lights a cigarette. \nRACINE They already think you're involved. \nMATTY I don't care. \nRACINE Great. \nMATTY There's nothing we can do about it now. In a little while we'll either have the money or we won't. It's out of our hands. \nRacine thinks about this awhile.     He exhales a stream of smoke. \nMATTY I fired the housekeeper. We can stay together as long as we want. We're all alone here now. \nLowenstein nods.   Racine opens the door and goes out of the office. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DETECTIVE BUREAU - DAY \nRacine walks out of Grace's office. Lowenstein watches him go. Heather is absorbed in a magazine and Roz is distracted with her cigarette. Racine could keep on walking, but instead he walks over to Roz. She jumps when he speaks to her. \nRACINE Hello, Mrs. Kraft. \nShe seems confused about how to act toward him.   Heather looks up casually. Racine shakes Roz's hand. \nROZ Hello, Mr. Racine. \nRACINE How are you making out? \nROZ We're all right, I guess. \nRacine crouches in front of Heather and smiles at her. \nRACINE You must be Heather. \nShe nods.   He shakes her hand. \nRACINE I'm Ned Racine, Heather. I've heard a lot about you. It's nice to meet you. \nHeather nods uncertainly. \nHEATHER Thank you. \nRACINE I'm sorry our town is so hot for your visit. \nHEATHER It sure is. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               97. \nRACINE (smiles, stands) Goodbye. \nROZ Goodbye. \nRacine walks away.   Heather watches him go.   Roz turns to Heather. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nRacine walks down the sidewalk and enters Stella's Coffee Shop. \nINT. STELLA'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nAs Racine comes in the front door, Stella is leaning over the counter in a gossipy huddle with a Cop and Glenda, the Meter Maid. When Stella notices Racine, she breaks off suddenly and moves away. The Cop and Glenda see Racine and go back to their food with great deliberateness. Racine takes all this in and settles at the other end of the counter. \nSTELLA (too boisterous) Hi, Racine. How you doing today? \nRACINE I'm fine, Stella. I'm fine.    What's the latest? Any hot news? \nSTELLA Nothing much doing. What'll it be? \nRACINE What's the special? \nSTELLA Veal outlets. \nRACINE What day'd you cook 'em? \nSTELLA They're fresh this month. \nRacine signals for her to bring it on.   He swivels around and looks out at the Court House. \nWIPE TO: \nLATER. \nSame shot. Lowenstein appears on the sidewalk across the street. He crosses over to Stella's and comes in. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                98. \nHe spots Racine and comes over to the counter with a light dance-walk, breaking into actual dance only as he Pirouettes before landing in the stool beside Racine. Racine is almost done with his lunch. \nLOWENSTEIN (to Stella) The usual, my sweet. \nSTELLA (O.S.) Two ice teas for Fred Astaire. \nLowenstein looks at Racine and smiles. \nLOWENSTEIN Are you ready to hear something wild? \nRACINE I don't know. I may have had my share for the day. \nLOWENSTEIN No, this is right up your alley. \nStella puts the two ice teas in front of Lowenstein. Lowenstein has to give her a look before she backs away. Lowenstein leans in confidentially toward Racine. \nLOWENSTEIN Little Heather comes out onto the back porch, and this dude is out there with her aunt, see? And he's turned away with his pants or shorts or whatever dropped, so he's mooning the little girl, right. And he and your friend are going at something which Heather couldn't quite figure out. \nLowenstein begins to shake with laughter; he almost falls off the stool. Racine is confused. Lowenstein recovers his balance and lowers his voice again. There are tears in his eyes. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                102. \nEXT. THE MOON AND THE OCEAN - NIGHT \nIt's the middle of the night. Bright under a full moon. And very quiet. The surf can be heard LAPPING at the beach. And then we hear HUMMING. \nEXT. THE PIER - NIGHT \nNo sign of life. Still the HUMMING; it's a Broadway show tune. \nEXT. END OF THE PIER - NIGHT \nLowenstein is there, all alone, silhouetted in the moonlight. He uses the rail like a ballet bar, returning to it each time he finishes a small combination of dance steps. The moves are not extravagant, there is not highkicking. Just a nice, smooth little combination that Lowenstein is repeating, again and again. \nHe HUMS his own accompaniment. Then, softly at first, from the distance, comes the THUMPING of running shoes on old wood. It grows as Lowenstein completes another repetition. When the THUMPING has gotten close, it slows, then stops raggedly. Lowenstein looks that way. \nRACINE (O.S.) (out of breath) Peter? \nLOWENSTEIN Hi, Ned. \nRacine walks up, dripping sweat, already extracting his cigarettes from his shorts. \nRACINE What are you doing here? \nLOWENSTEIN I've been looking for you. \nRACINE Yeah? \nLOWENSTEIN Yeah.    You always run this late? \nRACINE Nah. I'm going to Miami tomorrow. I'm not gonna have time. \nLOWENSTEIN What's in Miami? \nRACINE I'm closing this real estate deal I've been working on. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                103. \nLowenstein nods and turns to lean over the rail. Racine offers him a cigarette. Lowenstein accepts and Racine lights both of theirs. Lowenstein glances at Racine's pack as Racine puts it away. \nLOWENSTEIN You're some kind of health nut. (Racine smiles) Matty Walker smokes that same brand. I noticed that. \nRACINE Is this gonna be one of those conversations? Maybe I should have my lawyer present. \nLOWENSTEIN Buddy, your lawyer is present. \nThey look at the ocean. \nLOWENSTEIN You know, that Edmund Walker was a bad guy. The more I find out about him, the happier I am he's dead. I figure it's a positive thing for the world. \nRACINE You're not known for being a hardliner. \nLOWENSTEIN Mmm. I have my own standards. I try to keep them private. (he looks at his cigarette) As far as I'm concerned, I don't care who killed him. And I don't care who gets rich because of it. (shakes his head) But Oscar, Oscar's not like that. His whole life is based on doing the right thing. He's the only person I know like that. Sometimes it's a real pain in the ass. Even for him. \nLowenstein glances at Racine, but only for a moment. \nLOWENSTEIN Oscar's unhappy right now. He's in pain. \nRACINE Why is that? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                104. \nLOWENSTEIN Because he likes you. He likes you even better than I do. (long pause) That's why he's been busting his butt trying to locate this Mary Ann Simpson. They finally found her place in Miami yesterday, but the woman herself was gone... looked like she left in a hurry. (a beat) Oscar thought any story she could tell might help you. He thinks you need help. \nRacine turns around, drapes his arms back along the rail and lets his head loll, like a tired runner. \nLOWENSTEIN Someone's putting you in deep trouble, my friend. From about three thirty to five AM on the night Walker was killed, someone called your hotel room repeatedly. The hotel didn't want to put them through, but whoever was calling convinced them it was an emergency. The phone rang and rang, but you didn't answer. \nRacine looks at him. \nLOWENSTEIN Don't say anything. Save it for some Other time. It gets worse. (he stamps out his butt) Now someone's trying to give us Edmund's glasses. We don't know who. We don't know what the glasses will tell us. But our negotiations are continuing. \nLowenstein steps away, toward the street. He looks sad. \nLOWENSTEIN I wish I knew what to tell you, Ned. But I don't have any good ideas. \nHe turns and walks away. \nLOWENSTEIN I'll see ya. \nRacine watches him go. He takes out his pack of cigarettes and extracts one. He stares at the pack in his hand. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                105. \nEXT. FRONT TERRACE - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe house is dark. Racine tries the door a last time. (He's still in his sweaty running clothes.) No good. No one here. Racine peers inside one final time. He is looking through the new glass in the same little window shot out by Edmund's gun. The wind chimes TINKLE loudly. \nEXT. INTERSTATE 95 - DAY \nRacine's Stingray whips south in the morning light. \nBEVERLY Hey, are you all right? \nRacine stops for a moment and looks at her. He smiles and goes out. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING ROOM - DAY \nTeddy Laursen sits across the table from Racine. Teddy, too, looks a little ragged. Nervous. \nTEDDY I don't know. It's a thing in Lauderdale. Something must've gone wrong, but they're not telling me. I'm a little worried. \nRACINE I'll find out. \nTEDDY No, no. That's not why I called you. In fact, I got me another lawyer. \nRacine watches him. \nTEDDY I think it would be better. You know Schlisgal. \nRACINE (nods, confused) He's good. \nTeddy looks around nervously. Racine waits. \nTEDDY This broad came to me last week. A real looker. She said you told her how to reach me, I figured you musta, she knew all about it. (Racine nods) She said you wanted another one. \nTeddy searches Racine's face, trying to see if the story was true. He's not surprised that it's not. \nTEDDY Yeah, I was afraid of that. But I'm a slow thinker. (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             109. \nTEDDY (CONT'D) (lowers his voice even more) She had me show her how to rig it to a door, with a little delay. Does any of this mean anything to you? \nRacine looks at him blankly. \nTEDDY Then I'm glad I told you. Watch your step. \nRACINE Thanks, Teddy. \nRacine pushes his chair back. Teddy seems torn about saying more. He forces himself to -- \nTEDDY Racine... Don't thank me yet. These guys here, they've been asking me about The Breakers. (reads Racine's look) I haven't told 'em shit. But I don't like the look on their faces. \nRacine gets up. \nINT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY \nRacine listens to the endless ringing on the other end of his call and slowly hangs up. The phone rings in the reception room and Beverly picks it up, then hits the hold button. \nBEVERLY (yells) Ned. It's Mrs. Walker. Do you want her? \nRACINE Yeah. (he picks up) Hello. \nMATTY (filtered throughout) Hello, Ned. Can we talk? \nRacine swivels in his chair so that he can see Beverly in the reception room. Beverly is just replacing the receiver on the hook and for a moment, she gives Racine a strange, ambivalent look. Racine watches her as she goes back to work and speaks quietly into the phone. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org         110. \nRACINE Okay. Where are you? \nMATTY I'm in Miami. I've been running around like crazy and I could reach you before I left. \n(a pause) Ned, everything's going to be all right. \nRACINE Tell me. \nMATTY I've got the money. I've taken it and sent it somewhere safe. It's all ours now. (Racine says nothing) But that's not the best part. \nRACINE What's the best part? \nMATTY The glasses. I got them back. That is, they should be ours by now. Betty had them. She wanted money. That's why I had to come down here. She made it all very difficult, but I think it worked out. \nRACINE Do you have them? \nMATTY No. She wouldn't do that. She's putting them in the boathouse. In the top drawer of the dresser in the boathouse. They should be there now, if she's kept up her end. \nRACINE Yes. \nMATTY I think you'd better get them right away. I don't trust her. \nRACINE In the boathouse. \nMATTY That's right. The top drawer of the dresser. Oh. Ned, we're going to be all right. I'll leave here as soon (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              111. \nMATTY (CONT'D) as I can. I should be there by seven- thirty. I can't wait to see you, darling. We've made it. \nRacine is silent. \nMATTY Are you all right? \nRACINE I could see. \nMatty comes up the steps and puts her arms around him. She closes her eyes as she hugs him. They are one figure melded in the gloom. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               114. \nMATTY It's all ours now, Ned. We could leave tonight if we wanted. It's over. \nRACINE Yes, it is. \nMATTY (voice changed) What's this --? \nSuddenly she backs away from him, down the steps, her white dress moving back into the bright moonlight from the shadow of the gazebo. She looks up at Racine. \nRACINE It's Edmund's gun. You remember it, don't you? \nHe has it in his hand now. He looks it over casually, but the barrel is toward her. \nMATTY What is it, Ned? What's happened? \nRACINE I think you know. \nMATTY No.   I swear to you, I don't! \nRACINE It's the glasses, Matty. \nMATTY Weren't they there? Didn't she bring them? \nRACINE I didn't see them. \nMATTY She promised she'd bring them. \nRACINE Maybe I missed them. The way you missed them that night. \nMATTY Ned, I don't know what you think, but you're wrong. I haven't done anything to hurt you. I love you. You've got to believe me. \nRACINE Keep talking, Matty. Experience shows I can be convinced of anything. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                115. \nEXT. STREET NEAR WALKER PLACE - NIGHT \nGrace's car moves up the street past the gated drives. \nEXT. BACK LAWN - NIGHT \nRacine is at the bottom of the gazebo steps now. Matty has backed away, toward the Waterway. \nMATTY I did arrange to meet you. But, Ned, it all changed. You changed it. I fell in love with you. I didn't plan that... \nRacine laughs, short and bitterly. \nRACINE You never quit, do you? You just keep on coming. \nMATTY How can I prove it to you? What can I say? \nRACINE The glasses, Matty. Why don't you go down there and get them? \nMatty is silent. She starts to speak, but nothing comes out. Now there is real fear in her eyes. \nMATTY But you said they weren't there. \nRACINE I said I didn't see them. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nGrace's car moves down the drive. \nEXT. BACK LAWN - NIGHT \nRacine has moved closer to Matty, away from the house. They are only six feet apart. Tears are now rolling down Matty's cheeks. \nMATTY I'll go, Ned. I'll go and look for them. \nShe turns and starts walking toward the ocean. Just as she is about to disappear into the shadows, she turns back to him. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                116. \nMATTY Ned... no matter what you think, I do love you. \nAT THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE \nGrace has gotten out of his car. He starts toward the front door, but sees Racine out on the lawn. He heads out in that direction, but stops as Racine steps into a bright spot of moonlit lawn and the gun's shiny silverplate glints in the light. The gun is pointed at the retreating Matty. \nGrace pulls his own gun from a shoulder holster and raises it. He is about to call out, when Matty disappears completely in the gloom. Racine lowers the revolver wearily and stares out toward the boathouse. Grace lowers his gun and looks out there too. He moves slowly forward. \nClose on Racine's face. It's changing now. It's not just that he's very tired. The hardness is going out of his look. As the seconds tick by, and Matty does not reappear, he begins to lose faith in his view of the world. He begins to be afraid. Afraid for Matty. Even now. \nA sudden breeze starts the wind chimes TINKLING loudly. \nRACINE No, Matty! Stop! Don't go in! Matty. \n", "test1_input": "RACINE You're killing me. \nMATTY Is there any more ice?   I'm burning up. \nRacine gropes for the ice container and dumps the remaining ice cubs Into the tub with them. Matty snatches one out of the water and holds it to her forehead. \nMATTY He's coming up tomorrow. \nRacine knows. \nMATTY I can't stand the thought of him... He's small and mean... and weak. \nRacine watches some water run through his fingers. He cradles her head in an embrace that has nothing to do with sex. She looks sad. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              30. \nEXT. GROUNDS - WALKER'S PLACE -- NIGHT \nThe Middle of the Night. A light FOG has rolled in. Racine is walking slowly through the shadows of the heavy foliage. He stops beside a rubber tree. \nRACINE'S POV. The Walker House. In front sits a huge white Cadillac. All the lights in the house are out. The wind chimes TINKLE softly. \nRacine lights a cigarette. \nINT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY \nRacine stands at the window staring down at the busy Main Street. He is far away. \nINT. ENTRY HALL - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nRacine has just entered.   Matty is calling from somewhere out of sight. \nMATTY (O.S.) Just do what I say! Go into the living room. \nRACINE Come on! It's been three days.      I want to see you -- \nMATTY (O.S.) I'm going to make it up to you tonight. But you must behave.      Now go! \nRACINE I'm going.   I'm going. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nRacine goes into the living room and sits down on the couch. \nRACINE I'm here. \nMATTY (O.S.) Good. \nMatty comes in carrying a tray with two drinks on it. And she is dressed in the uniform of an airline stewardess, complete all the way to her little cap. She cannot keep a straight face, despite her efforts. Racine begins to laugh. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                31. \nMATTY (choking back her giggles) Good evening, sir... welcome to... to Flight 413 ... nonstop to ... \nShe hands him a drink, but he takes it and the tray and puts them on the floor. He pulls her down across his lap. They are both laughing hard. He kisses her. \nRACINE What do you take me for? \nMATTY Don't you like it? \nRACINE You think I'm a kid? \nMATTY You don't like it? I thought you went for this stuff. \nHe pushes her back across the sofa. \nMATTY Wait ...   wait ... I want to tell you about the   thing... the thing that will drop   from the ceiling... in case the   cabin suddenly depressurizes -- oho... \nEXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT \nA dozen Golfers are practicing, spotted along the  row of hitting pads under floodlights. Most are drenched   with sweat from their exertion in the muggy air. Their   randomly timed swings send streaking white bullets into the darkness. But what is hypnotic, what so captures   a hot night in sound, is the irregular CRACKING of clubs  meeting balls: CRACK, CRACK-CRACK-CRACK, CRACK-CRACK! \nIn the darkness of the overlooking parking lot, behind a high fence, sits the Stingray, with Racine in the driver's seat and Matty close beside him. They sit in silence. \nMATTY (finally) What are we doing here? \nRACINE (hushed) Listen! (CRACK, CRACK) I love that sound. \nMatty listens, but her eyes are on Racine. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                32. \nMATTY I want to be in bed. \nRACINE Is that all you ever think about? \nRacine watches the Golfers, listening intently.    Then he sees that Matty is crying. He comforts her. \nRACINE Hey!   I'm kidding. \nMatty looks straight ahead and her tone is somber. \n", "test1_true": "He knows it's true. It's the same for him. He wipes her cheeks with his hand. CRACK, CRACK-CRACK, CRACK. \nEXT./INT. WALKER HOUSE (SERIES OF SHOTS) - NIGHT \nWATERWAY/BOAT HOUSE -- The water laps against the pier. Gently. The quiet sound almost overpowered by the insistent buzz of the night insects. The CAMERA MOVES toward the house. \nLAGOON/GAZEBO -- A giant palmetto bug leaps from a lily pad into the water, creating a tiny ripple. The CAMERA MOVES toward the house. \nSTAIRWELL/HALLWAY -- Quiet and dark. The CAMERA MOVES along the shiny white posts of the stairs. Upward. \nINT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRacine and Matty are in bed. Matty is sound asleep, her back close to Racine. But he is not asleep. He is propped up, looking down at her. We've never seen his face like this before. Never this open, never so much in repose. She stirs, and then is still again. He touches her hair lightly. She sleeps. \nINT. STELLA'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nSame courthouse/cop crowd as before. Racine finishes a sandwich at a table as Lowenstein sits down with two tall glasses of iced coffee, both of which he drinks down. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               33. \nRACINE You look terrible. Don't you sleep? \nLOWENSTEIN I had a dream last night that was so boring it woke me up. I was afraid to go back to sleep. Where the hell have you been? \nRACINE What do you mean, I been around. \nLOWENSTEIN I've barely seen you for a month. Wait a minute -- it's some new quiff, isn't it? What's wrong with me. \nRacine dismisses this with a gesture. \nLOWENSTEIN You've never been shy about that stuff. \nAt this moment, DETECTIVE OSCAR GRACE, a   big, powerful black man comes in. He's a plainclothes    cop in shirt sleeves, his jacket in his hand. As he    passes Racine on his way to the third seat at the table,   he squeezes Racine's shoulders with his huge hands,   by way of greeting. \nRACINE Oscar. \nGRACE Hey. You weren't at the Y last week. We lost. \nLOWENSTEIN (about Racine) He's getting discreet. I can't believe it. \nStella comes over. \nGRACE Whatcha got in pie today, Stella? \nSTELLA (glancing behind her) Cherry, cherry... and cherry. \nGRACE What do you recommend? \nSTELLA I like the cherry. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                34. \nGRACE Bring it on.   And a gigantic Coke. \nLOWENSTEIN I'm really disappointed, Racine. I've been living vicariously off you for years. If you shut up on me, I'll have just my wife. \nRACINE There's nothing to tell.   I lead a lonely life. \nGRACE Right. And it's gonna snow later today -- \nLOWENSTEIN ... And people are basically decent.. (looking around the restaurant) ... Must be someone I know. Let's see -- someone in uniform... \nGrace laughs. Racine shakes his head in mock exasperation. \nLOWENSTEIN ...no Army personnel around. Waitress... Could it be... (like Brando in \"Streetcar,\" but soft) ...Stella! \nStella arrives with Grace's order. Lowenstein looks her over as a possible for Racine, but shakes his head. Stella lingers. Lowenstein spots someone, speaks to Racine in a loud, excited whisper. \nLOWENSTEIN I know, I know -- you finally got to Glenda. \nAcross the restaurant, GLENDA, a Meter Maid, is talking with some other women. \nLOWENSTEIN How was it? Did she let you into the no parking zone? \nSTELLA I'll have you know Glenda is seriously involved with a narc from Palm Beach. \nRACINE (smiling his innocence) There you are. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org           35. \nLOWENSTEIN A narc from Palm Beach? Is that his hobby? \nRACINE How's the cop business, Oscar? \nGRACE Real good. Always starts hoppin' in weather like this. When it gets hot, people try to kill each other. \nSTELLA It's true. I could tell you some people who'll be dead if we don't get a break soon. \nShe leaves.   The three men exchange amused looks. \nGRACE We've got more of everything bad since the wave started. It's the crisis atmosphere. People dress different, feel different, sweat more. They wake up cranky and they never recover. Look at Lowenstein. (a flash of smile) Things are just a little askew. Pretty soon people think the old rules aren't in effect. They start breaking them. Figure no one'll care, cause it's emergency time... time out. \n", "test2_input": "MATTY (O.S.) It is me. \nRACINE It's open. \nMatty comes in.  She peers into the darkness until she sees him. She  locks the door and turns to face him. She is dressed in a pale silk suit and blouse, very carefully put together.  She looks as good as she ever has; she seems to create her own light. \nMATTY Why haven't you answered your phone? \nRACINE You took a chance coming here. Where's Edmund? \nMATTY He's not coming up this weekend. Why haven't you answered? \nRACINE I didn't want to talk.     I just wanted to think. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                66. \nMATTY (nods; then, after a moment) Can I get in with you? \nRacine just stares at her. \nMATTY I don't know what Heather will tell Roz. Maybe nothing. Maybe she'll be embarrassed or afraid. Maybe she'll think she imagined the whole thing. \nRACINE (chuckles without humor) Maybe we all did. \nMATTY We'll know if she does tell. Roz will report to Edmund quick enough. It's exactly what she's always wanted. \nMatty disappears for a moment into the shadows. \nMATTY I've been thinking, too. \nRACINE And what have you got? \nMatty emerges from the darkness and sits on the edge of the bed next to Racine. She looks into his eyes. \nMATTY I think we should give it up. We haven't done anything criminal, yet. \nRacine has been thinking along the same lines.    He stubs out his cigarette. \nRACINE It's not too late to back out. \nMATTY That's right.   I don't think we can do it. \nRACINE What do you mean? \nMATTY Things have already started to go wrong. I feel like we got to the edge and looked over and, well, it was too much. We'll just have to live with that. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org            67. \nShe sits down on the bed. \nMATTY I'll divorce him. And     we won't have his money. Part of me     wants it so bad. I'd be lying if I     said I didn't. But it's the worst part    of me, the weakest part. \nShe leans back against him. \nMATTY All that matters is that we're together. \nRACINE (after a moment) You don't think I can pull it off. \nMATTY It's not you, it's us. I'm sure I'll make some mistake. \nRACINE That's not what you really mean, is it, Matty? \nMATTY Yes it is. \nRACINE (very calm, flat) No, it isn't. You think he's too much for me. You think I'll fuck it up, get us caught. \nMatty turns toward him. \nMATTY No, darling. Don't talk that way. It's not true. \nRacine studies her face. \nRACINE No? Well that's what I've been thinking. \nMATTY You're wrong. Don't think that, ever! I know you could do it. (moving closer) But all I care about is you. The money doesn't matter. \nRACINE It does in this world, the one we're living in. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                68. \nMatty presses her head against his chest. \nMATTY Why torture ourselves about it? \nRacine laughs; he doesn't know what's funny. \nRACINE When's he coming back? \nMATTY Friday. \nRACINE That'll be it, then. Nothing will stop us. \n", "test2_true": "RACINE Yeah.    I wasn't before, but I am now. \nRacine reaches over her, gets another cigarette and lights it. After he takes a deep drag, she takes it from him and takes a puff too. \nRACINE This time you're going to know how to reach me. I don't want any more surprises. \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - MIAMI - DAY \nRacine locks up   a rented Ford on a side street and walks back two cars to   where his Stingray is parked. As he bends to unlock   the Stingray, he looks around and a passing car catches his   attention. \nRACINE'S POV, PANNING with the car as it drives by him. There is only one thing extraordinary about this particular car. The driver, hunched and intent on the road ahead, is a Clown, in full costume and makeup. \nRacine watches as the car disappears.   For a moment, Racine looks like a dead man. \nINT. MASTER BATHROOM - WALKER HOUSE - DAY \nMatty is reclining in the soapy water, slowly scrubbing. She HUMS to herself. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                69. \nEXT. HILTON HOTEL - MIAMI - DUSK \nA Parking Attendant takes Racine's Stingray, as Racine goes into the lobby. \nEXT. FRONT TERRACE - WALKER HOUSE - DUSK \nMatty is leaning against one of the posts that flank the porch stairs. Headlights pass across the front of the house and Matty's body. She smiles a welcoming smile to the unseen Edmund. \nEXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nA light fog is settling into the dips of the road. Now Racine's rented Ford appears out of one such depression and moves into a clear stretch. \nINT. RACINE'S RENTED FORD - NIGHT \nRacine eyes the fog with concern. \nEXT. WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe FOG is much heavier here. It rolls in past the house in thick waves. The only light burning is on the front porch. The wind Chimes TINKLE softly. \nEXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH - NIGHT \nThe wind chimes TINKLE, nudged by the same breeze that floats the FOG around them. \nINT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe alarm clock -- 1:50. \nAgain, Matty lies on her side, turned away from Edmund, eyes wide, watching the clock. Again, the bed moves suddenly! Matty rolls over to look. \nEdmund is sitting up in bed, putting on his glasses. \nMATTY What's wrong? \nEdmund motions for her to be silent. \nWALKER (whispering) I think there's someone downstairs I heard something. \nHe swings out of bed; he is in his undershorts. \nMATTY Are you sure? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                70. \nAgain he silences her. He walks silently over to his. closet and disappears inside. \nMATTY (whispering) Should I call the police? \nWALKER (low, from the closet) Will you be quiet? I'm going to nail the bastard. \nEdmund comes out of the closet checking the safety on a shiny nickel-plated .38 revolver. \nMATTY (aghast) Edmund, what's that? \nWALKER Will you be quiet? \nMATTY I've never seen that. \nWALKER (at the bedroom door) I've got a surprise for this fucker. \nMATTY Edmund, be careful! \nBut he is already out the door, silently. For a moment Matty is frozen, then she slides out of bed. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT \nEdmund has stopped at the top of the stairs. He listens for sounds from below. He starts down the steps in the dark. \nINT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT \n", "test3_input": "Edmund comes slowly down the steps, his gun pointing here, then there in his perfectly steady grip. The thrill of the hunt is in Edmund's eyes. The downstairs is thick with ominous shadows. At the bottom of the steps, he stops and listens again. He moves in two quick steps to the entry hall and looks into the living room and dining room. He seems to hear something at the rear of the house. He turns and moves back along the central hall, very slowly. The alcove under the stairs is pitch black. Edmund points his gun at that approaching space and stops. He listens. The TINKLING of the wind chimes rises weirdly, making it hard for him to hear. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                71. \nEdmund's hand reaches out to the wall.   His fingers find the light switch. He flips it. \nFor a second, we are blinded by the glare. In the next Instant, as we see that the space below the stairs is empty, Matty screams from the top of the stairs -- \nMATTY He has a gun! \nEdmund thinks she is warning him.   He spins to look. \nWALKER Where? \nSuddenly, Racine bursts from the hall closet, the wooden plank raised above his head. He brings it down fast toward Edmund's head. \nEdmund reacts instinctively, raising his arm, the arm that holds the gun, to protect himself. The wooden plank smashes down -- half its force taken by Edmund's forearm, half by his head. The gun BLASTS once. \nOne small window in the front door shatters and the bullet continues into the night. \nEdmund's revolver slides across the hall floor into a corner. \nEdmund is on the floor, blood pouring from his scalp. But he is coming on like a crazed beast. His glasses askew, but still on his head, he has grasped Racine around the legs. With a powerful lunge, he pulls Racine's legs out. Racine crashes to the hall floor, losing the wooden plank. \nMatty, frozen at the stair railing, cries out. \nEdmund is pulling Racine toward him with all his might, crawling up Racine's body as they both slide on the wood floor. Edmund reaches out one huge hand, and pulls Racine even closer. \nRacine puts his left hand into Edmund's face, his thumb flat against the lens of Edmund's glasses and pushes his head back. The glasses fly away and Racine loses his hold. Edmund comes on. \nRacine's right hand gropes -- gropes -- finds the wooden plank. He swings it up. \nThe wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view, and then out, finding its mark with a HORRIBLE THUD. \nMatty, up the stairs, turns away. \nRacine falls back on the floor. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               72. \nEXT. TRUNK OF WALKER'S CADILLAC - NIGHT \nThe trunk is open like a giant maw. A sheet of plastic has been spread across the inside. Edmund's body flops down inside. He has been dressed, his shoes and watch put on. Racine drops the blooded wooden plank beside the body, then throws a blanket over the corpse and slams the trunk. Racine turns to Matty who stands, fully dressed, shaking in the foggy air. \nRACINE The cars at the end of the drive. Spend the fifteen minutes cleaning up inside, then come. You're gonna have to be careful in this fog. (he looks at her) Are you all right? \nShe nods. \nRACINE Fifteen minutes. \nRacine gets in the Cadillac and pulls away. \nINT. CADILLAC - ON DESERTED BACKROAD - NIGHT \nWIPE TO: \nThe first stretch of Racine's route to \"The Breakers\" looks different in the dense FOG. Racine has to take it slowly. \nHe consults his watch. A branch from one of the overhanging trees looms up abruptly in the windshield, like a grasping arm. Racine flinches. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT \nRacine drives through the silent neighborhood. The  houses are invisible in the FOG, their presence indicated only by an occasional glowing light. Suddenly, a police  SIREN pierces the night, followed by the appearance of a flashing red light on the street behind the Cadillac. \nINT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nRacine's eyes jump to the rear view mirror and the flashing red light growing in it. Racine pulls over. The police car slows as it reaches the Cadillac, pulls alongside, and then speeds on ahead, SIREN squealing. A light goes on in the house in front of which Racine has stopped. He pulls away. \nEXT. FOUR-LANE INTERSTATE - NIGHT \nThe Cadillac pulls up to the interstate from the side street. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 73. \nAs on the other night, there is more traffic here.   But it is moving slowly in the FOG. \nINT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nRacine has to cross two lanes of traffic to go south. He peers out through the misted windshield. He starts to pull out and a sports car appears from nowhere, doing fifty, sitting on his HORN. Racine hits the brakes. As soon as it has passed, there is a lull. Racine fishtails across the road just ahead of a truck and moves south. \nEXT./INT. CADILLAC - INTERSTATE - NIGHT \nThe traffic on Racine's side of the interstate has slowed. There's an accident up ahead. The police car that passed Racine is on the scene, but the lone Cop is not enough. Some Passing Motorists have pulled over to help with the wreck and direct traffic. The FOG is aglow with flashing red and white lights and burning flares. A Man signals for Racine to stop. The cars in the opposite lanes are allowed to pass through. Racine keeps his head down. \nA STOCKY TRUCKER comes out of the glowing FOG and walks up to the Cadillac. He leans down into the driver's window. \nSTOCKY TRUCKER Hey, man, do you have any flares? \nRACINE Uh -- no.     I don't think so. \nSTOCKY TRUCKER (irritated) Could you check your trunk? We got kinda of a mess here. \n", "test3_true": "The Stocky Trucker gives him a disgusted look and stands up. \nSTOCKY TRUCKER Don't put yourself out. \nThe Man in the road ahead signals for Racine to pull around into the opposite lanes and move on. \nTRACKING along beside the Cadillac, Racine moves slowly through the nightmare scene. Figures move by carrying lights and tools. The Injured CRY OUT in pain. Three cars are meshed in crumpled steel. A clutch of Onlookers are outlined against the beams of headlights... Racine might as well be driving into Hell. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             74. \nEXT. BRIDGE OVER CANAL - NIGHT \nHere is relief. The  Cadillac moves all alone across the bridge. The lights  penetrate the FOG at orderly intervals, barely illuminating the bridge. A huge FOG HORN fills the air from not far way. \nEXT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT \nThe deserted hotel looms ghostly in the FOG. The Cadillac, lights out, rolls silently to a stop in the half-hidden delivery driveway. \nINT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT \nRacine, carrying only a flashlight, has made his way to the supply area he visited before. His beam probes dark corners, responds to random CREAKING. Satisfied that he is alone, he moves a wooden crate and reaches into the hole in the wall which it hid. He brings out Teddy's incendiary device and places it on the floor in the middle of the room. \nEXT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT \nRacine grunts under the weight of Edmund's corpse, flung over his back. He stumbles back toward the hulking hotel. The trunk of the Cadillac is closed. \nINT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - CORRIDOR - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT \nRacine sits down hard. He is streaming with sweat under the enormous dead weight. He adjusts the plastic sheet so that Edmund's bloody skull won't contact the wall. Racine gathers his strength and half-lifts, half-drags the body down the corridor, his silhouette that of a twisted, double-headed monster. His flashlight glows from ahead at his destination. \nIN THE SUPPLY AREA, Racine has dropped Edmund's body over some tipped shelves. Now he lifts the  heavy ceiling beam he spotted earlier. He has to change  its angle only two feet in order to let it drop -- now -- on Edmund's head. \nRacine walks over to the incendiary device. He pulls out the lever and straightens up. As he does he looks down a connecting hallway. He sees movement. He snatches up the flashlight and the wooden plank and rushes down that hallway. \nAT THE END OF THE HALLWAY, Racine slides to a halt, breathing hard. Again he sees the movement. A horrible, sweaty figure confronts him -- there is a broken mirror attached to the wall. Racine looks at himself a long moment and the tension seems to drain away... \nSomeone speaks in the shadows! \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                75. \nRacine jumps and spins toward the sound,   which is only a little more than a MOAN. His flashlight    seeks out the source - a RAGGED BUM is stirring in his   sleep on a bed of newspapers. He wears an old baseball    cap. \nRacine looks at him a long time, trying to decide what to do. He looks back  in the direction of the supply area. He looks at the Bum settling again into a deep sleep. He looks for one final second at himself in the mirror. \nEXT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - BEACH - NIGHT \nRacine appears at a run from the fog. He has the Bum with him, grasped firmly at the neck of the collar and the seat of his pants. Racine is forcing the Bum to run along with him. The Bum is mightily confused, not least by the fact that Racine has jammed the baseball cap all the way down over his nose -- he can see nothing. Racine lets go, hurtling him across the sand. \nRACINE (a low growl) Get the hell out of here and don't come back. \nThe Bum is sprawled in the sand. The baseball cap has come off. He watches Racine's dark figure recede in the fog. \nRAGGED BUM (a whisper) Come on back here and fight like a man! \nINT. RENTED FORD - SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nMatty sits fidgeting in the front seat, trying to peer through the soupy FOG. She sucks on an unlit cigarette. \nRacine appears at the driver's window. Matty gasps.     He is a horrible sight. He gets in the driver's seat. \nMATTY Thank god.   I thought -- \nRacine grabs her and pulls her down out of sight, bending his body low over her. \nRACINE Shh! \nThe windows are suddenly illuminated by the beams of headlights. They grow brighter and a police patrol car, red light slowly revolving on the top, passes next to the Ford and moves off quietly in the FOG. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 76. \nRACINE (whisper) They're right on time and I'm running late. \nHe rises slowly and watches the patrol car disappear. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Ford stops at front of the drive. \nINT. RENTED FORD - NIGHT \nRacine and Matty break from a kiss.    He moves her away from him. \nRACINE We won't talk for a long time. \nShe nods.   They look at each other.   She gets out. \nEXT. INTERSTATE 95 - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT \nThe rented Ford speeds through the foggy night. \nINT. RENTED FORD - NIGHT \n"}

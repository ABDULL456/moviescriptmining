He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl. He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal and then checks his phone. "No Missed Calls." 
3) He surfs the web. He reads info on the Hair Club For Men site. He moves to Hot_or_Not.com. The first woman is very pretty. He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive. Her score is three. Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten. He checks his phone. He moves on to "BackDoorAsians.com." 
4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV. The lower third reads, "AMC's 24 Hours of Bond." No Missed Calls. The sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls. Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them as he watches. It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls. The morning light is creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls. 
5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk. He is a mess - tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur Magazine. Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack. 
6) Kirk is walking home. Every street sign, billboard and T- shirt he sees reads, "NO MISSED CALLS." 
MUSIC FADES OUT 
INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY 
He stands in the shower sulking. He hears the phone ring in the next room. He jumps out, grabs a small towel and starts to dry off as he runs into the bedroom. He reaches the charger base but the phone is not there. He stands and listens hard to the ringing. He runs into the living room. Angle on the phone. It's hiding under a pillow on the couch. In the background, Kirk rushes around the room flipping up papers and magazines. The phone keeps ringing and Kirk's panic increases until he finally spots the phone. Kirk dives for it, losing his towel in the process. 
KIRK Hello!?   Hello!? 
STAINER (V.O.) Took you long enough. What were you doing, taking a growler? 
Kirk notices a woman on the landing outside behind him.   She can see his ass through the window. He covers up. 
KIRK Sorry, Mrs. Nuesbaum. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY 
Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the shops and restaurants. Kirk holds a stack of flyers for Stainer's band. As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer. 
STAINER Kirk, it's a simple rule of life. Look around. People are pretty evenly matched. 
Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk. Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty, ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit. 
KIRK Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one who asked me out. So, why... 
STAINER That first night, were you intimidated by her? 
KIRK No, I didn't think I had a chance. 
STAINER Exactly. So you were relaxed and funny. You were on. 
Stainer posts several "Wheel in the Sky" flyers on a kiosk. 
KIRK So I gotta get back to that. 
STAINER That's just it, Kirky. Now that she's opened the door, you can't get back to that. 
KIRK So I'll have to fake it? 
STAINER Forget it. You can't fake that far. A broad like her - she'll smell that horseshit a mile away. 
Kirk and Stainer enter a... 
EXT. CAFE FRONT PATIO 
...and take a table on the crowded patio. 
STAINER Can we get a couple of menus? (then to Kirk) You eating? 
KIRK Maybe just a salad. 
STAINER Dude, one salad ain't going make up for thirty years of chili dogs. 
KIRK I know. But I got dinner with my folks later. 
STAINER Fun. Be sure and stab your brother in the eye with a fork for me. 
KIRK Sorry, Eric's not coming tonight. 
Kirk motions toward a mismatched couple (nerdy guy with knockout girl) who pass Kirk and Stainer's table on their way to the valet stand. Stainer rolls his eyes. 
KIRK (CONT'D) You know what - this is ridiculous. I'm just going to call her. 
STAINER Fuck you are! Put that thing away. You do not call her. Don't you get it? Talon is back in town. 
KIRK No, she broke up with him.

VOICE His wife? 
MARGE Linda. 
VOICE No. 
MARGE Linda Cooksey? 
VOICE No.  No.  No.  They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year. Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone. 
MARGE So ... they didn't... 
VOICE No.  No.  They never married. Mike's had psychiatric problems. 
MARGE Oh.  Oh, my. 
VOICE Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now. 
MARGE Oh.  Geez. 
VOICE Yah, Linda's fine.  You should call her. 
MARGE Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a suprise. 
MARGE'S CAR 
Marge drives, gazing out at the road. 
MARGE AT A DRIVE-THROUGH 
She leans out of her open window and yells at the order panel: 
MARGE Hello? 
MARGE AT THE GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE 
She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich. 
JERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE 
Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers onto a form.  Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically checks.  The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible entries. 
Jerry hums nervously. 
Glass rattles as someone taps at his door. 
Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit with worry. 
Marge sticks her head in the door. 
MARGE Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother you again.  Can I come in? 
She starts to enter. 
JERRY Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy - 
MARGE I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real short, then.  I'm on my way out of town, but I was just -  Do you mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying a bit of a load here. 
JERRY No, I - 
But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a sigh of relieved weight. 
MARGE Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday.  I was just wondering - 
JERRY Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing. 
MARGE Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates.  And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected. 
JERRY Yah, I see. 
MARGE So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently? 
JERRY The car's not from our lot, ma'am. 
MARGE but do you know that for sure without - 
JERRY Well, I would know.  I'm the Executive Sales Manager. 
MARGE Yah, but -

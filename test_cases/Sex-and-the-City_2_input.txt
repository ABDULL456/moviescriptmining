CARRIE Delete. 
Louise looks at her, unsure... then deletes. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) And -- isn't there some cyberspace place that you can send those so that I never have to see an email from him ever again? (off her nod) Do that please. 
LOUISE You sure you want to end all communication with him? 
Carrie nods. Louise nods. 
138   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/LILY'S ROOM -- DAY -- FALL       138 
Carrie is reading Cinderella to Lily who sits in her lap. They are on Lily's bed - surrounded by her dolls. 
CARRIE (reading) "And Cinderella and Prince Charming lived happily ever after." (beat; looks at her) This is a fairy tall sweetheart. Things don't always happen like this in real life -- you should know that now. 
LILY Again! 
Carrie flips back to the front. Lily is all smiles. 
CARRIE And another one bites the dust. 
Charlotte walks into the den with her coat on. She smiles. 
LILY Mommie home! 
139   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/HALL -- A LITTLE LATER         139 
Charlotte walks Carrie to the front door. 
CHARLOTTE Thanks for watching her while I went to the doctor. 
CARRIE (pulling on coat) Sure. Everything okay? 
CHARLOTTE I'm pregnant. 
Carrie looks at her. Charlotte smiles. 
CARRIE How? 
CHARLOTTE My doctor said sometimes when women stop trying -- it can happen. She knows other couples that adopt and then get pregnant. 
CARRIE Sweetie. 
CHARLOTTE Carrie -- I'm pregnant! 
Happy, happy tears. Carrie hugs her. 
CARRIE (V.O.) I guess, in certain houses, fairy tales do come true. 
140   INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE -- DAY -- FALL                140 
Halloween costume aisle. Carrie and Miranda browse. 
CARRIE I can't believe you're even dressing up. 
MIRANDA All the parents at Brady's school dress up -- it's fun! Fun thought up by a group of non-working mothers with nothing else to do all day. 
Miranda stops, looks at the costumes hanging there. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Witch and -- "sexy kitten". That's it? The only two choices for women. Witch and Sexy kitten. 
CARRIE You said a mouthful there, sister. 
Miranda holds up a mask of a ghoul screaming in horror. 
MIRANDA Maybe I should just wear this and a business suit and go as myself. 
CARRIE (re; mask) Speaking of monsters -- I got an email from Big. 
Miranda looks over at her. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) "I don't know what to say." (beat) Ah... then don't send an email. 
MIRANDA What were you expecting? 
No idea. Miranda grabs a witch hat. They start walking away. They round a corner, CHILD wearing a mask pops up. 
CHILD Boo! 
Carrie smiles. The child walks away. 
CARRIE Gonna take a little more than that to scare me after what I have been through. 
They start walking toward the check-out counter. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) And in the subject box: two words: I'm sorry. 
MIRANDA Steve is all about "I'm sorry." I'm sorry emails -- I'm sorry voice mails -- I'm sorry flowers -- I'm sorry cards. How about: don't do anything to be: " I'm sorry" for. 
CARRIE Maybe he's sorry. 
MIRANDA Maybe Big is too. 
CARRIE Point taken. (beat) I still can't believe this happened to me. I know it happened, but I can't believe it happened. I lay awake at night going over every detail of the last week in my head. 
MIRANDA Carrie -- There's a detail I've been meaning to tell you about -- 
Carrie spots something; GRABS Miranda's arm with horror. 
CARRIE (V.O.) And then I saw it...the only thing scary enough to scare me after the experience I'd been through. 
On the rack in the front register -- Vogue! 
141   INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL        141 
Carrie and Miranda stand looking at an open Vogue: 
"The Last Single Girl: Carrie Bradshaw Gets Married." 
MIRANDA You look great, you look amazing. So. That's the worst of it. 
Carrie flips a page. She noticed something. 
CARRIE Wait -- what's that say? In the box at the end? 
MIRANDA (reading) "Editor's note: The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston was cancelled as this issue went to press. Carrie Bradshaw is... 
Miranda stops reading.   Carrie looks at her. 
CARRIE Is what? 
Miranda doesn't want to respond. Carrie pushes the magazine further away so she can read it. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) (reads) "Carrie Bradshaw is still single and living in Manhattan."

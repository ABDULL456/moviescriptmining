HELEN This is your car? 
She reaches out a gloved hand and touches the radiator grill, feeling a chrome pillar torn from the accordion, as if searching for some trace of her husband's presence among the blood-spattered paintwork. 
JAMES You'll tear your gloves. 
James gently takes her hand and moves it away from the grill. 
JAMES I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult. 
HELEN Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital. (pause) I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped. 
JAMES Can I give you a lift? (almost apologetically) I somehow find myself driving again. 
INT. JAMES'S CAR -- DAY 
James is driving Helen Remington away from the police pound. 
JAMES You haven't told me where we're going. 
HELEN Haven't I? To the airport, if you could. 
At these words, James is stricken by an odd feeling of loss. 
JAMES The airport? Why? Are you leaving? 
HELEN Not yet -- though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy. 
JAMES I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them. 
HELEN I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to. 
JAMES So -- why the airport? 
HELEN I work in the immigration department there.

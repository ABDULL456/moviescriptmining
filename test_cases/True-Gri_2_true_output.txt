Ferryman So you're the runaway. Marshal told me you'd show up. I'm to present you to the sheriff. 
Mattie That is a story. Let go my horse. I have business across the river. 
The ferryman is leading Little Blackie back up the hill toward the town. Mattie cranes around to look at the two small figures across the river. They have twisted in their saddles to look back. 
. . . Look Slim, if you don't turn around and take me across you may find yourself in court where you don't want to be. I have a good lawyer. 
Ferryman Name ain't Slim. 
She looks at the dull man's unresponsive back. She twists to look across the river. 
The two mounted figures are breaking their look back and resuming their climb up the bank. 
Mattie draws an apple from the bag slung round the saddlehorn and pegs it, hard as she can, at the ferryman. 
It hits him square in the back of the head. He reacts, reaching to his head and dropping the reins. 
Mattie has already leaned forward for the reins and sweeps them back. She saws Little Blackie around and sends him galloping for the river. 
Mattie Run, Little Blackie! 
Ferryman Hey! 
She urges the horse, at the gallop, into the river. 
The splashing and shouts have again drawn the attention of the two men across the river. 
As the horse goes further into the river its up-and-down gait slows, the water offering resistance. 
The ferryman has run down to the bank. He stoops for a rock and throws it. It misses by a mile. 
Little Blackie leaves riverbottom and starts swimming. 
The two men across the river, having twisted to look, now rein their horses round to face the action. But they do not advance. They rest forearms on pommels and watch. 
Little Blackie is being carried downstream as he swims against a swift current. 
Mattie Good, Little Blackie! 
Little Blackie's head dips as he finds his feet again. He slogs laboriously to what is now the nearer shore. 
The two men up the bank impassively watch. 
The horse and Mattie emerge fully from the river, dripping. 
Mattie taps heels against Little Blackie's flanks and walks him slowly up the bank. She stops many yards short of the two men--Rooster and LeBoeuf. 
A silent standoff as Little Blackie breathes heavily. The two expressionless men still have not stirred. 
At length: 
Rooster That's quite a horse. 
A long pause. 
. . . I will give you ten dollars for him. 
Mattie From the money you stole from me? 
Rooster That was not stolen. I'm out for your man. 
Mattie I was to accompany you. If I do not, there is no agreement and my money was stolen. 
Rooster licks his lips, thinking. 
LeBoeuf Marshal, put this child back on the ferry. We have a long road, and time is a-wasting. 
Mattie If I go back, it is to the office of the U.S. marshals to report the theft of my money. And futile, Marshal Cogburn-- "Pursuit would be futile"?--is not spelt f-u-d-e-l. 
A heavy silence as Cogburn stares at her. 
LeBoeuf looks between the two, waiting for Rooster to take action. Gathering that he will not, LeBoeuf slides off his horse. 
Mattie watches as he walks to Little Blackie, holding up a gentling hand for the horse to sniff at and nuzzle. 
He abruptly swipes the reins with one hand and with the other grabs Mattie's ankle. He pushes momentarily to unstirrup the foot and then pulls hard, tumbling Mattie to the ground. 
LeBoeuf Little sister, it is time for your spanking.

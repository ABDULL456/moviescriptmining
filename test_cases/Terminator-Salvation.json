CORNFIELD - NIGHT \nA huge ESCAPE SHIP rises straight up from an open HATCHWAY. Nearby TROOPS crouch and FIRE after it.

CHOPPER - NIGHT \nA PANICKED PILOT on the radio: \nPILOT --repeat, that was not us! A ship escaped, they musta blown the place themselves! Jesus, a lot of our guys were still down there... \nEXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT \nSOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS. \nIN FG, FIND the STEEL SKULL of the dead TERMINATOR. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   CORNFIELD - DAY \nSAME ANGLE-- the TERMINATOR now half-sunk in mud. A FIELD MOUSE has nested in its skull cavity, seeking shelter from RAINDROPS. \nMonths have passed, the season changed-- CORN long dead, a black stubble. RAIN falls. \nA PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving.       The MUD roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE... \nEYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT. He opens his mouth, makes a few GUTTURAL NOISES... then SCREAMS. \nCAMERA PULLS UP from MARCUS' AGONIZED FACE... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   PLATEAU - EVENING \nBARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he sees in the distance-- \nA DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble. \nEXT.   DEAD CITY - NIGHT \nMOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground, partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN. \nMOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed, faded sign: \"BEWARE OF DOG.\" \nWIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS-- rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted, windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell. \nMARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips. \nA COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands. \nA HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket. \nMARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER. \nMARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame. He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush, feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away. \nHe rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken glass: \"SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!\" \n", "test1_true": "FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good. \nINT.   RUINED BAR - NIGHT \nPartially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now, again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with-- \nA DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY. \nMARCUS Hallelujah. \nHe unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES, instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nMEMORY MONTAGE: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic POVs, blurred, altered. SFX of HEARTBEATS, a RESPIRATOR. \n--WEBS of TUBES and FIBER-OPTICS FILLS THE FRAME. \n--GRIDS OF LASER LIGHT scan rapidly INTO CAMERA. \n--DIGITAL DISPLAYS blink through murky LIQUID. SERENA moves INTO FRAME, a look of concentration on her face as she peers through the LIQUID, INTO CAMERA. She starts to smile. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   DEAD CITY - DAY \nBLUE SKY. TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK. A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT. \nMARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her expression recalls the beckoning vision. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster. Then he carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on. \nEXT.   HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nDeserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels. MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're in mostly flat, treeless plains. \nFrom the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through the darkness. Marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the first living creatures he's seen. He waves. \nMARCUS Hey!   Yo, over here! \nThe FIGURES pause, turning toward him in unison. \nMARCUS (cont'd) Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt like I was the last man on... \nHe freezes in his tracks. These aren't humans. They're T- 400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan him. \nMARCUS (cont'd) Oh God... \nMarcus backs away, runs.      The T-400s stare after him-- but don't fire. \nANGLE THROUGH BINOCULAR MASK - MARCUS running for all he's worth, heading toward the viewer. We hear a muttering VOICE: \nBOY Hey mister, where you goin' in such a hurry? \nANGLE ON A BOY, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid teens. He crouches on the supports of a FREEWAY SIGN. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe wears layers of TATTERED, OVER-SIZED CLOTHING.     He scrambles quickly down from the sign. \nAT AN OFF-RAMP, Marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the freeway, when-- \nTHE BOY emerges from behind some RUBBLE, holding a HANDGUN in one hand, a lit OIL LANTERN in the other. \nBOY (cont'd) Whoah, whoah-- hang on there.   Got any food? \nMarcus raises his hands, shakes his head.     The boy looks him over dubiously. \nBOY (cont'd) You look like you been eating pretty good. \nThe boy moves closer, puts down the LANTERN, frisks Marcus with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other. \nMARCUS You're human... you can see me, you can touch me. This place is real. \nTHE BOY makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of PAPER SCRAPS from Marcus' pocket. \nMARCUS (cont'd) I thought I was in hell. \nBOY (raises an eyebrow) This sure ain't heaven. \nMARCUS Those things with masks, red eyes-- \n", "test1_id": 87, "test2_input": "CONTINUED: (2) \nMARCUS (nods, touched) Guess people had it pretty good. (FLIPS) What else we got... movers, mufflers, music-- \nSTAR Music? \nMARCUS You know, pianos, guitars... \nSTAR I don't remember music. \nMARCUS Come on. You must... (approximating the tune) \"I can't get no... satisfaction...\" (off her blank look) \"We are family... I got all my sisters with me...\" No, huh. How about... \"Twinkle twinkle little star...\" \nStar's face lights up, she nods eagerly, sings along: \nMARCUS & STAR \"How I wonder what you are... up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky...\" \nSTAR is dizzy with emotion, wipes an eye, turning away. \nMARCUS You OK? \nSTAR (shakes her head) Somebody used to sing that to me. \nMARCUS puts the phonebook aside, puts a hand on her arm; and she leans into him for a hug, tears forming in her eyes. \nSTAR (cont'd) Stay with us, Marcus. Please. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMARCUS looks down at her, affected. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   MOTEL - DAY \nAEROSTAT POV - a PIXELLATED ELECTRONIC IMAGE as it patrols the MOTEL AREA in its geometric pattern. It ZOOMS into the CARPORT, quickly scanning the abandoned VEHICLES, among which is an aged, open JEEP WRANGLER, its HOOD UP, parked beside a customized VAN. The cars are covered in DUST, the TIRES FLAT, they've been sitting here for a decade. \nOBJECTIVE ANGLE - the AEROSTAT zips off on its rounds. After a moment, the VAN DOOR slides open. MARCUS moves quickly back to the JEEP, KYLE and STAR behind him. \nSTAR checks her WATCH while MARCUS goes back to work on the JEEP'S ENGINE. He's found some tools, already has removed and cleaned SPARK PLUGS, dismantled the DISTRIBUTOR. KYLE, meanwhile, returns to INFLATING one of the tires with a BICYCLE PUMP. \nKYLE If we get it to move, will you teach me to make it go? \nMARCUS It's called driving.   Sure. \nSTAR wipes DIRT off the side of the VAN, revealing air- brushed ARTWORK beneath... \nSTAR Wow.   What were these like? \nMARCUS looks up from his work to see-- \nA WHITE UNICORN in a FIELD OF FLOWERS. \nMARCUS (SMILING) Not too many around in my time. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   MOTEL - NIGHT \nTHE AEROSTAT zips past the CARPORT.   As soon as its gone-- \nSTAR Now! \nTHE JEEP is suddenly PUSHED from the carport, tires somewhat inflated. MARCUS is on one side of the rear, KYLE on the other, STAR behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up. \nThey get the vehicle to a slight SLOPE, it begins to roll on its own. \nMARCUS Pop the clutch! Let your foot up! \nANGLE IN JEEP \nWe see it's been hot-wired. STAR has her foot all the way down on the clutch, now lets up-- \nTHE JEEP BUCKS and SPUTTERS... but CATCHES. As soon as it does, MUSIC BLARES from the tape deck-- raucous HEAVY METAL, the aged cassette SPEEDS and SLOWS. MARCUS runs for the driver's side, but the JEEP is pulling ahead fast. \nANGLE IN JEEP \nSTAR is staring at the speaker, mesmerized at the sound of the MUSIC. When she looks out the windshield-- \n--she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror-- \n--MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral. \nKYLE Aerostat's coming! \n", "test2_true": "STAR Music... \nMARCUS Sort of. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARCUS turns the MUSIC DOWN.       He looks up to see-- \n--THE AEROSTAT, right over their heads, keeping pace with the vehicle, RED LIGHTS FLASHING. \nKYLE rises in back, SWINGS at it with the SHOTGUN BUTT-- \nTHE AEROSTAT deftly dodges the blows. \nSTAR Oh no! It's gonna call a Harvester, we're dead-- \nMARCUS SLAMS on the brakes-- the AEROSTAT stops a few feet ahead of them, hovering in the air. \nMARCUS picks up an X-shaped LUG WRENCH from behind his seat, rises, taking aim-- \n--and HURLS THE WRENCH with amazing speed and power-- \n--it flies like a throwing star and SMASHES the AEROSTAT to BITS in a shower of SPARKS and METAL. \nThe three of them stare breathlessly for a moment. \nKYLE Wow.   You're good. \nMARCUS flexes his hand, startled at his own strength. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   TEXAS PLAINS - NIGHT \nThe JEEP moves off-road, HEADLIGHTS OFF, traveling by MOONLIGHT. It SWERVES and BUCKS from time to time. MUSIC PLAYS from the TAPE DECK, something more melodic. \nANGLE IN JEEP - KYLE behind the wheel, having the time of his life, MARCUS supervising, STAR enjoying the breeze and the unfamiliar sensation of a moving vehicle. \nSTAR Faster! \nMARCUS No!    You're doing fine. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE. MARCUS ejects the tape, pulls it out-- it's unspooled, tangled in the stereo's guts. THE KIDS groan disappointedly. STATIC from the radio now... but a FAINT VOICE audible beneath it. \nMARCUS (cont'd) Ssh. \nMARCUS FIDDLES with the dial. He can't get the SOUND clear, rolls through the dial. Varying levels of STATIC, then a relatively CLEAR VOICE: \nRADIO VOICE --proper ratio of ammonium nitrate to diesel fuel. A bomb of this type can be contained in an ordinary plastic garbage bag, and will detonate on impact... \nKYLE (EXCITED) That's him! \nRADIO VOICE This recording has described booby- traps and explosive devices. It will repeat every two hours on different frequencies to avoid Skynet jamming... \nSTAR points toward the horizon.    Marcus looks up. \nMARCUS Stop the car. \nKYLE ACCELERATES. \nMARCUS (cont'd) Other pedal, other pedal! \nThey SCREECH to a halt. \nIN THE DISTANCE - a RED GLOW of FLAMES far away. SILHOUETTED against this, strange FLYING VEHICLES and spindly, spider- like MACHINES are just visible. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRADIO VOICE Do not give in to despair. As bleak as things seem, I assure you, humanity will triumph. \nHIGH ANGLE - THE JEEP turns away from the conflagration, moves off in a new direction and vanishes into the darkness. \nRADIO VOICE (cont'd) The machines only win when we give up hope... this is John Connor. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   SERVICE STATION - DAWN \nHIGH ANGLE - a crumbling SERVICE STATION with a RUSTING TANKER on flat tires, the cab long gone.   MOVE TO FIND the JEEP approaching off-road. \nTHE JEEP pulls to a stop, MARCUS gets out from behind the wheel and moves to the TANKER. STAR and KYLE, with his binocs, scan the area for signs of Skynet surveillance. \n", "test2_id": 88, "test3_input": "KYLE AND STAR Twinkle, twinkle, little star... \nWIDER, their heads, feet and chests are clamped onto SLIDING TRAYS, a long row of these hold OTHER PRISONERS as well. Kyle and Star must reach across a gap between the trays to hold hands. (It's the first time we've seen her hatless.) \nThe trays are all poised before panel-covered SEMI-CIRCULAR OPENINGS built into the wall, in a sterile, hospital-like environment. Above each opening is a MONITOR SCREEN. An ominous HUM is building. \nIN AN ADJACENT OPERATING THEATER, visible through GLASS WALLS, MEDICAL LASERS mounted on ROBOTIC ARMS work on anesthetized patients (we needn't see the grisly details). \nBEHIND STAR and KYLE, the PANELS OPEN, the trays slowly SLIDE into the OPENINGS. SCREAMS and SOBS from other prisoners.

STAR'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY \nImmobilized in this small, tubular chamber, like an MRI, STAR closes her eyes as she's bathed in BRIGHT LIGHT, LASER GRIDS projecting over her skull. The HUMMING is LOUDER. \nSTAR Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky... \nINT.   KYLE'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY \nThe same thing is happening to Kyle.    He's no longer singing. \nKYLE Stop it stop it STOP IT! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   SKYNET HIGHWAY - DAY \nWITH MARCUS beneath the truck. He's moved to the edge of the chassis, near a WHEEL, moving slowly, carefully. There's a bit more clearance at the sides of the sunken highway now, but they're still moving awfully fast. \nTHE WHEEL TURNS, the vehicle suddenly SLOWS to negotiate a turn, braking downhill. Marcus seizes this opportunity. \nANOTHER ANGLE as MARCUS LAUNCHES himself from below the vehicle, rolling into the GAP between the convoy and the concrete wall. The remaining vehicles RUMBLE PAST, as MARCUS presses himself against the wall. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWhen they're gone, he gets to his feet, limping down the highway on foot for a short distance, dragging his damaged leg behind him. He hears ANOTHER CONVOY approaching. \nJust in time, he finds a SEAM in the poured concrete, it's enough to give him purchase-- he struggles to climb up the eight feet of freeway wall. \nMARCUS makes it over the top, TRUCKS RUMBLING past below. This is desolate, hilly country. \nANGLE DOWN - among the vehicles below is a CONTAINER, like the one that held Kyle and Star. We glimpse the anguished FACES and REACHING HANDS of CAPTIVES within. \nMARCUS reacts, moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks for a short distance until-- \nTHE VEHICLES shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight.      In the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the destination. \nMarcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading for the complex. He reaches the edge of a plateau, looks down, his expression changing. This is the last thing he expected to see. CAMERA MOVES to reveal-- \nEXT.   COASTAL VALLEY - DAY \n--a panoramic view of a GORGEOUS COASTAL COMMUNITY. The place is lush, green, with well-maintained, lovely HOMES in the distance, a BLUE SEA beyond. The complex of buildings stands a few miles away, at the far end of the valley. \nMARCUS, amazed, limps down a gentle slope leading to this seeming paradise. \nEXT.   GOLF COURSE - DAY \nMARCUS emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself looking at a groomed FAIRWAY. Marcus hears a NOISE nearby-- \n--a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.    MARCUS turns in the direction it came from. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAn electric GOLF CART approaches, driven by a handsome, middle-aged golfer-- JEREMY-- who wears casual country club attire, eating from a clear BAG OF TRAIL MIX. Jeremy comes to a stop beside Marcus. \nJEREMY Are you all right? \nMarcus slowly shakes his head, as Jeremy climbs out of the cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal at his shoulder and leg. \nMARCUS What the hell is this? \nJEREMY You look like you've been hit by a truck-- \nMARCUS Among other things. Look, I'm trying to find some friends-- a couple of kids. They were taken here, I saw some buildings-- \n", "test3_true": "JEREMY The facility, sure.   Hop in, I'll take you there. \nMarcus hesitates a beat, can he trust this guy? But Jeremy simply seems eager to help, as he guides him to the passenger seat, then gets behind the wheel. With a smile: \nJEREMY (cont'd) This round was gonna blow my handicap anyway. I'm Jeremy. \nHe extends a hand.     After a beat, Marcus reaches toward it-- \nMARCUS Marcus. \nJeremy clutches Marcus' hand tightly.     Marcus blinks, Jeremy cocks his head, then lets go. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJEREMY I can't connect with you at all... your interface must've been damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll have you as good as new. \nWith that, he hits the gas. \nEXT.   RESIDENTIAL STREET - EVENING \nJEREMY drives the cart down the road, past well-kept homes with generous lawns-- it's a beautiful, upscale community at MAGIC HOUR. BICYCLISTS and FUTURISTIC CARS pass, Jeremy waves to NEIGHBORS. Marcus takes it all in with disbelief. \nMARCUS I didn't think there was-- anything like this left... anywhere. \nJEREMY Yes.   We're very lucky.   Want some? \nHe holds the plastic bag out to Marcus, who obligingly takes a handful of trail mix, pops it in his mouth. After a beat, he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it. \nMARCUS This isn't food. \nJEREMY Well, of course not. Seems you got a little memory loss going on. \nMarcus stares at him, confused. Jeremy is starting to realize just how out of it he is, speaks as if to a child. \nJEREMY (cont'd) It's a foam resin. It can taste like anything you want it to-- but of course, we don't really need to eat. (BEAT) Our brains are powered by fuel cells, remember? \nMarcus just stares, Jeremy gestures at the world around them. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEREMY (cont'd) We're in a transitional phase. Most of us need the comfort of the familiar a little while longer-- food, shelter, sex. Until we forget the old life. \nAs he speaks, he notices his BAG is nearly empty. He casually lifts his sport shirt and CLICKS OPEN a PANEL beneath his rib cage. We glimpse CIRCUITS, FIBER-OPTICS. \nJEREMY (cont'd) Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of the hardest habits to break... but before long, none of this will be necessary. We won't even need these bodies. \nFrom within he removes an identical BAG FILLED with TRAIL MIX (the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag. He clicks the panel shut again, pops a NUT in his mouth. \nMarcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away. He reacts to the sound of PIANO MUSIC, a difficult piece being played expertly-- PASSING a PICTURE WINDOW, he sees a PIANIST practicing. \nIn front of this home, a GARDENER and WINDOW WASHER are hard at work. They're both T-400s, with the eerie mask-like faces. Marcus reacts. \nMARCUS Terminators! \nJeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. He's starting to regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if he'd picked up some homeless guy. \nJEREMY We don't call them that here. \nMarcus grabs Jeremy, who pulls back a bit, alarmed. \nMARCUS What are you? \nJEREMY A hybrid.    The same as you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARCUS A hybrid-- human and machine? \nJEREMY Of course. That's what this community is for-- people like us. \nMARCUS Jesus... why? \nJEREMY You should be grateful to have been chosen. \nMARCUS What about the ones who weren't? \nJEREMY You mean like Janet and the kids. \nFor a moment, Jeremy's expression darkens.     Then he shuts his eyes, and his features relax. \n", "test3_id": 89}

{"train": "BOY (CASUALLY) Terminators-- T-400s.   What is this stuff? \nTHE BOY unfolds the paper scraps in the LANTERN LIGHT-- \nANGLE ON PAPER SCRAPS - the WOMAN'S FACE from the poster, a fragment of a MODEL'S PHOTO from a MAGAZINE AD, a painting of a FEMALE FACE from a PAPERBACK COVER. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTHE BOY looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. But with sudden speed, MARCUS GRABS THE BOY'S GUN HAND and wrenches it hard-- it FIRES into the air. MARCUS gets control of the gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat. \nMARCUS If I'm not in hell, where am I?! \nBOY (CHOKING) Texas! \nThe NOISE of a SHOTGUN PUMPING close behind MARCUS-- \nMARCUS spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into the boy's cheek. He's face to face with-- \nA GIRL, a couple of years younger than the BOY, training the shotgun at Marcus' head-- she looks ready to shoot. \nGIRL Let him go! \nMARCUS First put down the shotgun. \nTHE GIRL shakes her head angrily.   She wears an aged, beloved BASEBALL CAP with a STAR on it. \nBOY Do what he says. \nGIRL He'll kill us both! \nMARCUS I don't wanna kill anyone. \nBOY Do it, Star. Put it down. \nShe shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at Marcus' head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face. \nGIRL There was only one bullet in that gun. \nMARCUS hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \n--BOOTS IT at the GIRL. BURNING OIL spills across her leg, she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. MARCUS tosses the BOY at her, the two of them SPRAWL on the ground, the shotgun falling to one side-- \nMARCUS quickly snatches up the shotgun. \nUsing SNOW, the BOY helps the GIRL extinguish the flames from her clothing. \nMARCUS stands over the kids with a gun in each hand.   He struggles to control anger, speaks quietly. \nMARCUS I don't like it when people point guns at me. \nGIRL It wasn't loaded. \nMARCUS quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and handgun-- indeed, both are empty. \nMARCUS You took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun? (studies them admiringly) Pretty stupid. \nHe shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught FIRE and are incinerated. \nTHE BOY and GIRL get to their feet, stare at Marcus. \nGIRL Can I have my gun back? \nMARCUS shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up.   He still looks at the PICTURES in his hands. \nGIRL (cont'd) Where'd you get those? \nMARCUS In the city. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nBOY (steps away from him) The city? Oh man. That place is red hot. \nMARCUS (a small smile) Seemed kinda dead to me. \nBOY No-- radiation. \nA SPOTLIGHT appears in the distance-- a ROVING HUNTER-KILLER moving in their direction. \nQuickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a WALL OF DEBRIS. MARCUS looks toward the LIGHT, unaware of danger. \nONE AEROSTAT patrols the area. It's a surveillance drone the size of a softball, shiny steel, an inset camera lens with a RED GLOW. It flies in a geometric pattern, hovering every few seconds before continuing on. It vanishes around the corner of the fast-food joint, moving in the direction of the motel. STAR has been timing its moves. \nSTAR Now! \nKYLE and STAR dash for the fast-food entrance, MARCUS just behind. They round the doorway and-- \nINT.   FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY \n--drop down inside behind an upended table in what was once a taco place, remnants of Mexican decor. \nTHROUGH A DIRTY WINDOW, they see the AEROSTAT buzz past, flying its pattern. It moves on without spotting them, then takes off in a new direction. \nKYLE and STAR set to searching the place, something they've done many times. They go through trash cans, check behind the counters and in the kitchen. MARCUS gets up, still looking out the windows. \nMARCUS That flying grapefruit, what was it? \nKYLE Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes. They patrol places like this, looking for survivors. \nSTAR Yes! \nShe's come up with some UNOPENED PACKETS OF CONDIMENTS from a bag of TRASH. KYLE trots over. \nKYLE Any red ones? \nShe nods excitedly, hands him a packet.    He tears it open, sucks down the contents eagerly. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKYLE (cont'd) Mm.    Ketchup. \nSTAR discards one packet, sucks at another-- and immediately makes a pained face and tosses the packet aside. \nSTAR Yuk! \nMARCUS picks up the packet, looks at it. \nMARCUS Jalape\u00f1o sauce. \nSTAR and KYLE pause in their eating, stare at him. \nSTAR You can read. \nMARCUS shrugs modestly. \nKYLE So can I. (off Star's look) Well, sort of... a little. \nWith obvious reluctance, STAR holds a packet of mustard toward Marcus. \nSTAR Want some? \nMarcus gallantly waves it away. \nMARCUS No thanks.     Not hungry. \nKYLE Never heard anyone say that before. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   ABANDONED MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nANGLE IN MIRROR - MARCUS stares at his own reflection in a cracked MIRROR. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARCUS I look the same. \nSTAR closes tattered curtains, plops on the bare bed, ready for sleep. The room's a mess, GRAFFITI here and there, trash scattered about; they're not the first squatters who've been here. THE GUNS and STAR'S WATCH lie on a dresser. \nKYLE sits before the TV-- he's scratching STICK FIGURES onto the screen with a rusted POCKETKNIFE. One is clearly meant to be him; the smaller one, wearing a baseball cap, is Star. \nKYLE You ever watch television? \nMARCUS Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had to look forward to in the joint. \nSTAR (YAWNING) What's a joint? \nMARCUS (BLINKS) Prison. Spent half my life there. \nKYLE I remember TV a little.   Cartoons. It was great. \nKYLE plops on the bed next to STAR, who's already out. MARCUS studies them. \nMARCUS She your sister? \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARCUS (nods, touched) Guess people had it pretty good. (FLIPS) What else we got... movers, mufflers, music-- \nSTAR Music? \nMARCUS You know, pianos, guitars... \nSTAR I don't remember music. \nMARCUS Come on. You must... (approximating the tune) \"I can't get no... satisfaction...\" (off her blank look) \"We are family... I got all my sisters with me...\" No, huh. How about... \"Twinkle twinkle little star...\" \nStar's face lights up, she nods eagerly, sings along: \nMARCUS & STAR \"How I wonder what you are... up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky...\" \nSTAR is dizzy with emotion, wipes an eye, turning away. \nMARCUS You OK? \nSTAR (shakes her head) Somebody used to sing that to me. \nMARCUS puts the phonebook aside, puts a hand on her arm; and she leans into him for a hug, tears forming in her eyes. \nSTAR (cont'd) Stay with us, Marcus. Please. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMARCUS looks down at her, affected. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   MOTEL - DAY \nAEROSTAT POV - a PIXELLATED ELECTRONIC IMAGE as it patrols the MOTEL AREA in its geometric pattern. It ZOOMS into the CARPORT, quickly scanning the abandoned VEHICLES, among which is an aged, open JEEP WRANGLER, its HOOD UP, parked beside a customized VAN. The cars are covered in DUST, the TIRES FLAT, they've been sitting here for a decade. \nOBJECTIVE ANGLE - the AEROSTAT zips off on its rounds. After a moment, the VAN DOOR slides open. MARCUS moves quickly back to the JEEP, KYLE and STAR behind him. \nSTAR checks her WATCH while MARCUS goes back to work on the JEEP'S ENGINE. He's found some tools, already has removed and cleaned SPARK PLUGS, dismantled the DISTRIBUTOR. KYLE, meanwhile, returns to INFLATING one of the tires with a BICYCLE PUMP. \nKYLE If we get it to move, will you teach me to make it go? \nMARCUS It's called driving.   Sure. \nSTAR wipes DIRT off the side of the VAN, revealing air- brushed ARTWORK beneath... \nSTAR Wow.   What were these like? \nMARCUS looks up from his work to see-- \nA WHITE UNICORN in a FIELD OF FLOWERS. \nMARCUS (SMILING) Not too many around in my time. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   MOTEL - NIGHT \nTHE AEROSTAT zips past the CARPORT.   As soon as its gone-- \nSTAR Now! \nTHE JEEP is suddenly PUSHED from the carport, tires somewhat inflated. MARCUS is on one side of the rear, KYLE on the other, STAR behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up. \nThey get the vehicle to a slight SLOPE, it begins to roll on its own. \nMARCUS Pop the clutch! Let your foot up! \nANGLE IN JEEP \nWe see it's been hot-wired. STAR has her foot all the way down on the clutch, now lets up-- \nTHE JEEP BUCKS and SPUTTERS... but CATCHES. As soon as it does, MUSIC BLARES from the tape deck-- raucous HEAVY METAL, the aged cassette SPEEDS and SLOWS. MARCUS runs for the driver's side, but the JEEP is pulling ahead fast. \nANGLE IN JEEP \nSTAR is staring at the speaker, mesmerized at the sound of the MUSIC. When she looks out the windshield-- \n--she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror-- \n--MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral. \nKYLE Aerostat's coming! \nKYLE We oughta find a place to hole up for the day... \nMARCUS pounds on the TANKER-- a deep echo. \nMARCUS Damn it.    Empty. \nKYLE sniffs the air. \nKYLE You smell that? \nSTAR sniffs the air herself, eyes going wide. \nSTAR Food! \nThey both hop out of the Jeep, running toward the GARAGE, each carrying their unloaded GUNS. \nHIGH ANGLE - from BEHIND THE RUSTING SIGN, an AEROSTAT appears, aimed at the kids, LIGHTS BLINKING. \nINT.   SERVICE STATION - DAWN \nKYLE and STAR slither under a partially open GARAGE DOOR. The space is dark, SMOKE-FILLED... STRIPS OF DRIED MEAT hang from the hydraulic lift. The two youths look amazed and delighted. Kyle shoves the gun into his waistband, moves to the closest strip and PEELS OFF A PIECE, takes a tentative bite, then gnaws ravenously. Star leans the shotgun against the wall and follows suit. \nMARCUS lifts the garage door and enters, DAWN LIGHT streaming in behind him. \nMARCUS What is this? \nKYLE (mouth full) Who cares? \nMarcus squints at something in the darkness.   He takes a step forward, then grabs Star's arm. \nMARCUS Spit it out! \nSTAR (CHEWING) It's good! \nNow KYLE reacts to what Marcus saw, GAGS and SPITS out meat. He's staring at-- \n--a dried, severed HUMAN HAND, resting on a GRILLE in the sunken SERVICE PIT, where a CHARCOAL FIRE smolders. \nStar sees it too, turns and RETCHES, just as-- \n--three animal-like CANNIBALS emerge from the back of the garage-- two burly, ugly, unshaven MEN and a wild-eyed, unhealthy-looking WOMAN with matted hair. We'll call them PIG, BULL and COW. PIG grabs the SHOTGUN, BULL grabs KYLE and yanks the HANDGUN from his waistband. \nCOW grabs STAR, shoves her into the center of the garage, beside Kyle and Bull. Bull tosses the handgun to COW who keeps it trained on the kids, sizing them up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOW Not much meat on `em. \nPIG eyes Marcus, points the shotgun in his face. \nPIG This one's fi-i-ine-- \nMARCUS raises two fingers like a peace sign-- then shoves them into the barrels of the shotgun. PIG snorts and PULLS THE TRIGGER-- CLICK. \nMARCUS Oops. \nMARCUS yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, HEAD-BUTTS Pig, who staggers backward, BLOOD SPRAYING from his nose. \nCOW points the unloaded HANDGUN at Marcus-- CLICK CLICK. \nKYLE and STAR get free of BULL and dash for the exit, they're out of there in a flash. \nBULL CHARGES MARCUS, who dodges him, grabs the man and-- \n--HURLS HIM HEAD FIRST into the CHARCOAL PIT-- his BODY SIZZLES against the coals, he SCREAMS and WRITHES. \nCOW picks up an AXE with two hands and SWINGS it at MARCUS who GRABS the HANDLE with one hand and YANKS it away. \nCOW knows she's met her match, turns and flees, heading out the way Kyle and Star went. \nMARCUS advances on PIG and BULL, brandishing the AXE. Pig squirms back across the floor, wiping BLOOD from his face. \nPIG We didn't kill `em! I swear to God, they was dead already, we wasn't gonna let `em rot-- \nBULL has scrambled out of the coal pit, but is in too much pain to rise. \nBULL Go `head, take as much as you want, we're on the same side here-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMarcus looks ready to finish them off-- but reacts to CRIES from outside, a loud MECHANICAL RUMBLE. \nA PAIR OF A-10 WARTHOGS-- the same colorful ground attack aircraft we saw in the first battle-- ROAR PAST on either side of the transport. \nTHE CRIPPLED HARVESTER topples off the side of the transport, still clutching MARCUS and-- \n--CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it now, to keep from falling. \nThe HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance planes. \nA DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily armored H-Ks, and the smaller, more maneuverable WARTHOGS. CANNON FIRE CATCHES an H-K but has no effect. The H-Ks' BLUE PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank. \nAn AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the ENGINE of an H-K. AN EXPLOSION, the thing starts flying erratically, heading downward and-- \n--CRASHING to earth in a glorious FIREBALL. \nEXT.   AERIAL & RIVER - DAY \nThe planes are nearing a RIVER, bordered by sickly TREES. On the far banks, even from above, we see ominous MILITARY FORTIFICATIONS-- CONCRETE BUNKERS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, etc. \nMARCUS meanwhile, is trying to climb up the dead Harvester, avoid the ENGINE BLAST and find a handhold on the transport. \nTHE A-10 that shot down the H-K comes around for another pass at the transport, but-- \n--ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS at the far side of the river let out a VOLLEY of BLUE PLASMA-FIRE. The BURSTS arc toward the A-10, which swerves and climbs, but-- \n--PLASMA FIRE destroys a wing, the A-10 SPINS out of control. \nTHE OTHER A-10 breaks off its dogfight with its H-K and speeds away from the river. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARCUS is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the transport, he reaches out and-- \n--THE FRIED HARVESTER suddenly dislodges from the ENGINE POD, taking Marcus with it, into FREEFALL. \nWITH MARCUS, plummeting downward toward earth, a hundred feet below, the transport continuing on its way above, crossing the river. \nMARCUS' POV - the ground and treetops getting closer. At the last moment, his continuing forward momentum takes him OVER THE RIVER and-- \nMARCUS and the DEAD HARVESTER HIT THE WATER, hard, vanishing below the surface with enormous SPLASHES. \nThe surviving H-K and the TRANSPORT continue across the river into Skynet territory, vanishing in the distance. \nCAMERA MOVES to FIND a PARACHUTE, drifting earthward on the unfortified side of the river. \nEXT.   RIVERBANK - DUSK \nHOLD ON LAPPING WATER for a beat.      Then-- \n--MARCUS breaks the surface, staggering toward shore, he drops to his knees in the shallows. \nWAKES APPEAR behind him. Hearing the water stir, Marcus turns to see numerous DARK SHAPES moving rapidly in on him, from different directions, FLASHES OF METAL visible beneath the surface. These are HYDROBOTS-- AQUATIC TERMINATORS-- but we don't get a good look at them (yet) and Marcus isn't sticking around. He scrambles for the riverbank and makes his way into the leafless trees. \nEXT.   TREES - EVENING \nMARCUS moves past the trunks of bare trees, pauses, looks over the water in the direction the transport took. \nBLAIR (O.S.) Yo!   Up here! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLAIR WILLIAMS, the helmeted pilot who ejected, hangs from the tangled remains of her parachute, caught in the trees about fifteen feet in the air above Marcus. \nMARCUS moves closer.    Blair struggles to saw through her lines with a KNIFE. \nBLAIR (cont'd) Who are you-- \nThe LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree. \nMarcus' reflexes are fast as ever, he's beneath her in an instant and CATCHES HER. He holds her in his arms: \nMARCUS Name's Marcus. \nBLAIR You can put me down now, Marcus. \nHe does so. Blair pulls off her helmet, her hair is short. She's in her 20s, pretty, petite but strong, a no-nonsense, battle-hardened member of the Resistance. She pulls a COMPASS from her flight suit, consults it briefly as she orients herself. \nBLAIR (cont'd) I've got an ELT, but I can't call for a rescue here. There's an outpost a few miles upriver-- not my favorite people in the world, but it's safe. Let's move. \nBlair is already moving, Marcus hesitates, then points across the water. \nMARCUS I'm heading that way. \nBLAIR (cont'd) Levels are tolerable now, but just. We can't spend the night here. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nThey start moving again.   Marcus pauses, listens: \nMARCUS What was that? \nBLAIR I didn't hear anything-- \nNow they both hear an eerie HOWL, changing in pitch-- like a coyote on crack. More than one picks up the CHORUS. \nBLAIR (cont'd) Skindogs. \nShe pulls a SIDEARM, holds it at the ready as she starts running, away from the direction of the noise. Marcus keeps up at her side, looking behind them. \nWITH THE DOGS \nWe don't get a good look at them, but there's a pack of large BEASTS moving quickly through the undergrowth, gaining on the fleeing humans. \nBLAIR sees they won't outrun them. She spins, FIRES in the direction of the approaching PACK. Suddenly it's quiet-- the animals fan out, forming a circle around Blair and Marcus. \nMARCUS They're surrounding us. \nQUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush. \nBLAIR They're smart. And they don't scare easy. \nAfter a few tense beats, from the foliage-- \nA SKINDOG leaps at BLAIR from behind-- it's hideous, the size of a Great Dane, hairless, with veiny, wrinkled skin and long, catlike CLAWS. Before Blair can react, MARCUS leaps between her and the dog, grabs the slavering creature by the throat. It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward-- \nTWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBLAIR FIRES a few SHOTS at the encroaching pack, we hear a few YELPS-- \nMARCUS protects her, effortlessly tosses a few more SKINDOGS aside, ignoring vicious bites and scratches. \nThe other SKINDOGS turn on dead and injured pack members, begin TEARING INTO THEM. There's an opening now, the two humans make a run for it. \nBLAIR catches her breath, looking him over, seriously impressed by his strength and calm. \nBLAIR (cont'd) You saved my ass. Thanks. \nMARCUS shrugs, turns back to see the feeding frenzy. \nMARCUS Dog eat dog world. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   NORMAL FOREST - NIGHT \nIt's darker now, the moon is down. MARCUS and BLAIR move gingerly-- she TRIPS, he catches her before she falls. \nBLAIR Thanks. \nBLAIR sighs, yawns, sits against a tree. \nBLAIR (cont'd) It's not far, but we'll never get across the mine field at night. Might as well STAF till morning. \nMARCUS nods, sits a few feet away from her. \nBLAIR (cont'd) C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite. \nMARCUS slides toward her, she nestles against him. \nMARCUS Staf?   What's that mean? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLAIR It's a resistance term.    Sit tight and fuck. \nSoon they're kissing passionately.      But MARCUS pulls away, rolls onto his back. \nBLAIR (cont'd) You holding out for lipstick? Lingerie? Or am I not your... type? \nMARCUS I'm not gay. In prison, I thought about puss-- women all the time. But now... it's not working. Who knows, all those years on ice... \nBLAIR Maybe it's just gonna take some time. Before you're completely thawed out. \nINT.   OUTPOST/BARRACKS & COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY \nDARK. We hear BABIES CRYING from nearby, FUMBLING in the dark, muttered CURSES-- then a MATCH lights a CANDLE. BARNES, 20-ish, good-looking and cocky, yawns and sneers, annoyed at being awakened. TWO WOMEN share his mattress. \nBARNES Somebody feed those things! \nMORRISON Start up the generator, Barnes. \nMORRISON is bearded, long-haired, bleary-eyed, a middle-aged man in charge here. He sits up in bed, also beside A COUPLE OF WOMEN. This place has become an underground crash pad, communal living for about a dozen people-- Morrison and Barnes the only men, four or five WOMEN and quite a few CHILDREN of varying age. \nBARNES grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who CRY OUT in protest. He wraps it around himself, carries the candle as he steps around other SLEEPING FIGURES, makes his way toward a METAL STAIRCASE winding downward. Moments later, we hear a GAS ENGINE start up-- LIGHTS flicker on. \nThe place is pretty grimy and run-down, but it was once a military environment. There's a BANK OF TV MONITORS against one wall, which COME TO LIFE. A couple of the WOMEN move toward the adjacent NURSERY AREA to tend to the babies-- one of them, LISA, moves to the TV MONITORS. She squints at one. \nLISA We got company! (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nON A SCREEN \nMARCUS and BLAIR in the exact positions we last saw them, looking exhausted. They CRY OUT, unheard. \nEXT.   FOREST CLEARING - DAY \nBARNES pokes his head up from a concealed TRAPDOOR thirty yards from BLAIR and MARCUS, who are hoarse from shouting. \nBARNES Blair? Good to see you. (off her glare) What's the password? \nBLAIR Eat shit and die, Barnes! \nBARNES Close enough. Who's your friend? \nBLAIR Could you get us outta here please? \nBARNES Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in a mine field. \nBLAIR You didn't maintain the perimeter! Where are your sentries? \nBARNES It's too early for that military crap. \nBARNES consults a MAP, turning it to orient himself. \nBARNES (cont'd) OK, if you keep walking straight you're gonna get blown all to hell... turn to your left and take, oh... five steps. \nBLAIR and MARCUS obey, moving cautiously. \nBARNES (cont'd) OK, face me now. Three steps. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThey do as told. \nBARNES (cont'd) Almost home. Turn to your right and take another five steps... \nThey slowly pace five steps.      On the fifth one, there's a CLICK beneath Marcus' foot-- \nA horrified moment of eye contact between him and Blair-- she DIVES TO THE GROUND, away from him as-- \nBOOM!   MARCUS is thrown through the air by the EXPLOSION-- \nMARCUS' BODY lands a few feet from the trap door. \nINT.    OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - DAY \nFrantic action-- the unconscious MARCUS is carried down a corridor from the open trap door by BARNES, MORRISON and a couple of women, NANCY and LISA. BLAIR, bleeding from shrapnel injuries, assists. She yells at BARNES: \nBLAIR You goddamn idiot! \nBARNES He was takin' bigger steps! \nMORRISON Son of a bitch is heavy. \nINT.    OUTPOST/INFIRMARY - DAY \nMARCUS is deposited gingerly on a METAL TABLE in this crude MEDICAL AREA. Numerous INFANTS and TODDLERS about. \nJANE, a doctor, moves toward MARCUS with scissors and other medical tools, cuts away a tattered pants leg, the shreds of his sneaker. She stops and stares, palpates a BLACKENED LEG briefly. She looks up in alarm. \nJANE He stepped on a Claymore? This guy oughta be in a hundred pieces... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nKID It's awake! \nINT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - DAY \nBLAIR is first to reach the edge of the silo, horrified at the sight of the dangling MARCUS. BARNES keeps the RPG trained on him, they shout over each other. \nMARCUS Get me the hell down from here! \nBARNES Shut up!   I told you to shut up! \nBLAIR Leave him alone! (turning away from him) Marcus, I'm so sorry... \nMORRISON and the OTHERS join them, eyes fixed on Marcus. \nBARNES It keeps talkin' at me. God this thing gives me the creeps. \nMARCUS Why are you doing this?    What is this place? \nMORRISON We're trying to-- \nNANCY (over him) Don't say anything!     It's probably uplinked to Skynet. \nMorrison puts a hand on her arm. \nMORRISON Then it's already too late. (to Marcus) This used to be an ICBM silo, we're just trying to stay alive here. Your turn-- where'd you come from? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARCUS Corpus Christi. It's in Texas.     Or it was. \nBARNES (AMAZED) It sounds completely human... it really could pass. \nJANE Didn't John Connor say they'd start building things like this? \nMORRISON Not yet-- not for years. (to Marcus) So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history-- \nMARCUS What are you talking about? \nMORRISON You can skip the act, we know what you are. \nNANCY Why are you even speaking to it?! \nBARNES She's right, let's just waste the damn thing-- \nNANCY It'll kill us all if we give it a CHANCE-- \nDuring the above, other KIDS and ADULTS IN BG AD LIB-- \"Kill it,\" \"Goddamn robot,\" etc.-- increasing mob anger, until-- \nMARCUS I'm a man! \nHis impassioned CRY silences the onlookers.       He speaks more quietly, desperately: \nMARCUS (cont'd) Even if I never been treated like one. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) MARCUS (cont'd) Year after year after year on death row, I just wanted it to end! I cut my own wrists. But they nursed me back to health, `cause that wouldn't be fair, they needed to kill me themselves. For Chrissake, you all want me dead so bad-- just do it. (a scream) Do it! \nHis CRY ECHOES through the silo. The CHILDREN cower behind the adults. BLAIR is genuinely moved by his plight. \nBARNES hefts the RPG, looks toward MORRISON-- \"should I?\" Morrison seems torn, about to give the order-- \nLISA rushes in from the communications area, breathless, amazed by her own news: \nLISA Regional got through to CLA-- they want us to rig a video feed. (gesturing at Marcus) He wants to see him. \nMORRISON Who does? \nLISA John Connor. \nThey all seem astonished-- this has gone right to the top. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   OUTPOST/COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY \nMARCUS sits impatiently in a wooden chair, facing a VIDEO CAMERA and a MICROPHONE. BARNES trains an RPG at his head while MORRISON finishes PADLOCKING HEAVY CHAINS to the BOLTS in Marcus' arms and legs-- these attach to a nearby STEEL POST. BLAIR stands nearby. LISA fumbles nervously with the TRANSMITTER, plugging in wires. \nMARCUS So this guy is what, like king of the world, or what's left of it? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCONNOR (cont'd) Kate, why did I become leader of the Resistance? \nKATE Because people trust you... you give them faith-- \nCONNOR No. Because I knew I would be, I was told. I know when and where the major battles are going to take place. I know I'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother-- even though I haven't met him yet. Christ, I even know the year I'm going to die... \nKATE JOHN-- \nCONNOR So how could I not know about this?! \nHe BANGS HIS FIST on the table atop the PAPERS. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR & LAUNCH TUBE - DAY \nMARCUS is marched down the corridor to the launch tube, Frankenstein-like, MORRISON holding the chains, keeping a safe distance from him, while BARNES keeps the RPG trained at Marcus' head. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMarcus shuffles awkwardly, the bolts hampering his ankles. It's reminiscent of his death walk at film's opening. \nMARCUS Feels like I been here before... what are you gonna do to me? \nMORRISON Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP. \nThey reach the edge of the SILO PIT-- a long drop, smooth walls, a long METAL LADDER leading down into darkness. MARCUS pauses by the ladder, holds up his bolted arms questioningly-- \"now what?\" \nAt a look from Morrison, he and Barnes BODY-CHECK MARCUS at once, sending him flying over the edge-- \nMARCUS FALLS the thirty feet or so, strikes the concrete FLOOR of the launch tube with a sickening THUD, the CHAINS clattering down around him. \nMARCUS is stunned, barely conscious as the LADDER is PULLED UPWARD. It's like the bottom of a well, twenty feet in diameter, sheer concrete walls, the floor BLACKENED from a rocket blast. \nANGLE UP - his captors look down at him for a moment, then move out of view. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT \nCAMERA MOVES past the PRISONERS, a couple dozen total... An HISPANIC COUPLE huddle against one wall, whispering to each other IN SPANISH... COW rocks in despair, head in her hands, BULL and PIG mutter to each other nearby... an OLDER WOMAN prays, going through rosary beads... FIND STAR and KYLE. She's watching as KYLE uses his pocket knife to CARVE an image in the wall of the transport. He looks up. \nKYLE We're stopping. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe BACK PANEL rolls upward. CONTROL ROBOTS-- reminiscent of the treaded T-1s but without the heavy weaponry-- flank a path from the rear of the transport towards BRIGHT LIGHT up a RAMP a short distance away. \nTHE PRISONERS instinctively move away from the robots, moving to the front of the container... until ZZZAP! BLUE ENERGY crackles across the floor. THE PRISONERS CRY OUT in pain at the electrified surface, and dash toward the opening at the rear, leaping out of the container. \nLOW ANGLE, as the prisoners run by, we hold a moment on Kyle's graffiti-- it's the STICK FIGURE IMAGES of KYLE and STAR we saw before, they both hold hands with a LARGER STICK FIGURE who stands between them, meant to be MARCUS. \nINT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT \nTHE CONTAINER has stopped in a large subterranean space. There are numerous FUTURISTIC VEHICLES here-- hydrogen CARS, three-wheeled ATVs, electric BUSES. CONTROL `BOTS closest to the container start to close in on the huddling PRISONERS. \nA ROBOT BUMPS into BULL, sending another JOLT OF ELECTRICITY through his body, like a cattle prod. Everyone gets the picture, starts hurrying down the line, the ROBOTS closing around them. \nCOW looks around nervously, clearly freaking out.   Spotting a gap between the robots, she bolts-- \n--a ROBOT SWIVELS and CUTS HER DOWN with an ENERGY BLAST. She lies still, SMOKE rising from her body. \nThe other PRISONERS pick up the pace. \nSTAR I'm scared. \nKYLE (hugging her) Whatever happens, we stick together. \nThe LIGHT emanates from FROSTED WINDOWS at the top of the RAMP, through which we make out the SILHOUETTES of human figures. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGLASS DOORS part ahead of the prisoners-- a stark white, sterile environment beyond. THE ROBOTS stop here. THE PRISONERS disappear inside... and the DOORS CLOSE. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT \nBARNES remains on guard duty with the RPG, propped up on some cushions, a LANTERN by his side-- it's pretty late, the generator's shut down. He's reading an old, yellowed COMIC BOOK, he has a small stack at his side. \nMARCUS You think they'll buy that? \nBLAIR Worth a shot. (looking at him) Marcus, Command wants to take you apart, cut open your head. One thing I know, you're alive-- and you've got a right to live. \nTHE BUZZING SAW BLADE sound-bridges to: \nEXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT \nTHE WHIR OF CHOPPER BLADES. A SPOTLIGHT shines over the low growth in the minefield as a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER circles, coming in for a landing. WEAPONS RACKS are jury-rigged beside the spotlight, the chopper bristles with AUTOMATED CANNONS, MISSILES and NAPALM TANKS. \nTHE SPOTLIGHT picks out the CONCRETE and STEEL CAP of the LAUNCH TUBE. \nINT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT \nTHE SAW finishes cutting the BOLT between Marcus' legs; his arms are already free. The BUZZING cuts out, but now they hear the CHOPPER LANDING directly overhead. \nBLAIR They're already here for you-- \nMARCUS slides the BOLTS out of his legs, freeing himself from the chains. \nBLAIR (cont'd) Hide in the forest, then aim west for open country-- \nMARCUS I'm heading across the river. \nBLAIR No human being can survive there-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARCUS I'm not human, remember? \nBLAIR You're gonna try and save those kids. \nMARCUS It's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense... \nBLAIR Marcus, for all you know, they're dead already-- \nMARCUS For all I know, they're the reason I'm back from the dead. \nBLAIR studies him a moment, no changing his mind. But she admires him. She starts up the ladder, MARCUS following. \nBARNES is still passed out as BLAIR and MARCUS ascend to the platform around the pit. They move to the sliding door-- \nBLAIR starts to open it, but sees a LIGHT and hears VOICES and FOOTSTEPS at the far end, SLIDES IT SHUT again. \nBLAIR Damn it, we're too late-- \nMARCUS Where's that go? \nMARCUS points to a LARGE VENTILATION FAN behind STEEL GRATING, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit. It's not running, but there's no way to get through it. \nBLAIR Should lead out, but there's no way past the fan-- \nMARCUS is already picking up the RPG-- but he points it backwards, has no idea how to shoot it-- \nBLAIR grins, grabs the RPG from him-- then braces herself, takes aim and FIRES-- \nKABOOM!   The EXPLOSION rips OPEN the GRATE, destroys the FAN. \nINT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nMORRISON escorts a pair of powerful UNIFORMED SOLDIERS armed with HIGH-TECH RIFLES with explosive shells-- they react to the EXPLOSION beyond the closed door-- and break into a run, the soldiers readying their weapons. \nINT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT \nMARCUS and BLAIR have moved around the narrow walkway to the far end of the pit, beneath the SMOKING HOLE. Blair thinks of something, pulls a small DEVICE from her flight suit, the size of a pack of cigarettes, holds it toward Marcus. \nBLAIR Here. My ELT-- emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance. \nShe indicates a button.     MARCUS takes the device-- \n--then grabs her, KISSES HER hard on the mouth-- she's startled-- it felt very human. \nMARCUS Thank you. \nMARCUS grabs the sharp, still smoking STEEL projecting from the hole and pulls himself upward as-- \nTHE DOOR SLIDES OPEN and the SOLDIERS open FIRE at MARCUS-- \nBLAIR hits the deck as EXPLOSIVE SHELLS tear HOLES in the CONCRETE-- \n--SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the ventilation shaft-- \nINT.   VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT \nKYLE AND STAR Twinkle, twinkle, little star... \nWIDER, their heads, feet and chests are clamped onto SLIDING TRAYS, a long row of these hold OTHER PRISONERS as well. Kyle and Star must reach across a gap between the trays to hold hands. (It's the first time we've seen her hatless.) \nThe trays are all poised before panel-covered SEMI-CIRCULAR OPENINGS built into the wall, in a sterile, hospital-like environment. Above each opening is a MONITOR SCREEN. An ominous HUM is building. \nIN AN ADJACENT OPERATING THEATER, visible through GLASS WALLS, MEDICAL LASERS mounted on ROBOTIC ARMS work on anesthetized patients (we needn't see the grisly details). \nBEHIND STAR and KYLE, the PANELS OPEN, the trays slowly SLIDE into the OPENINGS. SCREAMS and SOBS from other prisoners. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSTAR Oh no, oh no... \nKYLE Shh, keep singing. \nKyle and Star hold hands for as long as possible, then release their grip as their bodies enter the chambers and the panels slide shut. \nINT.   STAR'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY \nImmobilized in this small, tubular chamber, like an MRI, STAR closes her eyes as she's bathed in BRIGHT LIGHT, LASER GRIDS projecting over her skull. The HUMMING is LOUDER. \nSTAR Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky... \nINT.   KYLE'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY \nThe same thing is happening to Kyle.    He's no longer singing. \nKYLE Stop it stop it STOP IT! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   SKYNET HIGHWAY - DAY \nWITH MARCUS beneath the truck. He's moved to the edge of the chassis, near a WHEEL, moving slowly, carefully. There's a bit more clearance at the sides of the sunken highway now, but they're still moving awfully fast. \nTHE WHEEL TURNS, the vehicle suddenly SLOWS to negotiate a turn, braking downhill. Marcus seizes this opportunity. \nANOTHER ANGLE as MARCUS LAUNCHES himself from below the vehicle, rolling into the GAP between the convoy and the concrete wall. The remaining vehicles RUMBLE PAST, as MARCUS presses himself against the wall. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWhen they're gone, he gets to his feet, limping down the highway on foot for a short distance, dragging his damaged leg behind him. He hears ANOTHER CONVOY approaching. \nJust in time, he finds a SEAM in the poured concrete, it's enough to give him purchase-- he struggles to climb up the eight feet of freeway wall. \nMARCUS makes it over the top, TRUCKS RUMBLING past below. This is desolate, hilly country. \nANGLE DOWN - among the vehicles below is a CONTAINER, like the one that held Kyle and Star. We glimpse the anguished FACES and REACHING HANDS of CAPTIVES within. \nMARCUS reacts, moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks for a short distance until-- \nTHE VEHICLES shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight.      In the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the destination. \nMarcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading for the complex. He reaches the edge of a plateau, looks down, his expression changing. This is the last thing he expected to see. CAMERA MOVES to reveal-- \nEXT.   COASTAL VALLEY - DAY \n--a panoramic view of a GORGEOUS COASTAL COMMUNITY. The place is lush, green, with well-maintained, lovely HOMES in the distance, a BLUE SEA beyond. The complex of buildings stands a few miles away, at the far end of the valley. \nMARCUS, amazed, limps down a gentle slope leading to this seeming paradise. \nEXT.   GOLF COURSE - DAY \nMARCUS emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself looking at a groomed FAIRWAY. Marcus hears a NOISE nearby-- \n--a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.    MARCUS turns in the direction it came from. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAn electric GOLF CART approaches, driven by a handsome, middle-aged golfer-- JEREMY-- who wears casual country club attire, eating from a clear BAG OF TRAIL MIX. Jeremy comes to a stop beside Marcus. \nJEREMY Are you all right? \nMarcus slowly shakes his head, as Jeremy climbs out of the cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal at his shoulder and leg. \nMARCUS What the hell is this? \nJEREMY You look like you've been hit by a truck-- \nMARCUS Among other things. Look, I'm trying to find some friends-- a couple of kids. They were taken here, I saw some buildings-- \nMARCUS Your family. You lost them? \nJeremy nods and SMILES, looking at him once more. \nMARCUS (cont'd) Why are you smiling? \nJEREMY `Cause I feel good. The interface recognizes negative emotions-- rage, grief, despair-- and stimulates positive endorphins in response. Thank God, life would be pretty unbearable otherwise, don't you think? \nEXT.   PARK - DUSK \nThey've left the main street now, driving down a WOODED PATH leading to the \"facility.\" There are lawns, fountains, etc. Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARCUS Tell me everything.   How did you people get here? \nJEREMY Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA. I was an engineer on Project Angel-- \nMarcus drags the man from the cart by his throat, squeezing harder. \nMARCUS Angel-- what is it? \nJEREMY Advanced Nexus of Genetic and Electronic Life-forms... A-N-G-E-L. You can stop choking me, it's not like I need to breathe. \nMarcus releases him, but remains in his face.       Jeremy takes a moment to recover his composure. \nJEREMY (cont'd) We replaced the body's hydrocarbons with plastinated compounds while maintaining cellular structure-- analog neural impulses were converted to wireless digital signals, controlling the micro-tech chassis-- \nMARCUS English! \nJEREMY (sighs, slowly) The goal was a superior support system for the human brain-- to go anywhere, do anything-- explore deep space, the bottom of the sea. I specialized in optics. \nHe taps his own eye with an audible CLICK, not flinching. Marcus takes a couple steps away, looking at his own hands. \nJeremy points to nearby BUILDINGS, a little peevish. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJEREMY (cont'd) The facility is just ahead. I'll let them know you're coming. \nSo saying, he's back in the cart, pulling away in a hurry.   A moment later, Marcus moves off amongst the trees. \nNearing the complex, Marcus reacts to BIRDSONG above.   He looks up, stops as he sees-- \n--a TINY SPEAKER, concealed amongst the LEAVES. \nMARCUS moves to this tree, touches it-- the bark feels unnatural. He RAPS it with his FIST-- it sounds hollow, made of FIBERGLAS. He fingers a LEAF, tries to bend it-- PLASTIC. \nHe crouches, studying the GRASS. After a moment, he finds a SEAM in the pristine lawn. He starts to peel it up... it's ASTROTURF. Beneath it is SANDY DIRT. \nMarcus KEEPS PEELING the plastic covering back... more dirt-- and BITS OF BONE. As he continues to uncover the ground we see recognizable CHUNKS of SKULLS, LEGBONES, etc. \nBy now he's rolled back a few square yards, numb with horror. Marcus moves on toward the complex with new determination, trying to stay out of sight. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   LABORATORY - NIGHT \nON THE MONITORS above the long row of chambers-- colorful 3-D IMAGES of the prisoner's BRAINS are being constructed, like PET scans. DENSE DIGITAL READ-OUTS BELOW, as data is analyzed. (Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the chamber, the subjects looking frightened. \nIN THE OPERATING THEATER, the LASERS are still now, their grisly work done for the moment, awaiting the next batch. \nAn ENGINEER, a nice-looking, well-built young man in loose black clothing, moves down the row of chambers, studying results. He speaks into a subtle HEAD-SET: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nENGINEER 32578 - acceptable. 32579 - no, insufficient neural capacity. 32580 - eh, this one shouldn't have even been brought here... \nAs he speaks, the BARCODES on the monitors in question turn either RED or GREEN in response to his judgments. \nHe reaches KYLE'S CHAMBER, we see Kyle's anguished FACE on the monitor photograph. \nENGINEER (cont'd) 32581 looks good... \nKyle gets a GREEN BARCODE, the engineer is on to Star, he strokes his chin. \nENGINEER (cont'd) 32582... hm, borderline. May not be emotionally compatible. Pass. \nOn STAR'S MONITOR-- RED BARCODE. \nEXT.   UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nWe see now that Connor's on board a NUCLEAR ATTACK SUB, with TWO MORE SUBS moving in tandem behind it. \nHOLD ON the LEAD SUB and MOVE IN ON the STENCILLED NAME as it PASSES CAMERA: \"LOS ANGELES SSN-688.\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.   REPAIR LAB - DAY \nSTART ON MARCUS' DAMAGED LEG. It has been DETACHED from his body, halfway down the thigh. Elaborate CIRCUITS are exposed, as SURGICAL MACHINES perform repairs with LASERS, MECHANICAL ARMS replacing damaged parts. \nNEARBY, MARCUS opens his eyes, coming to. He's CLAMPED onto an elaborate, mobile SURGICAL TABLE, the stump exposed. His body and head are secured within its framework. MORE MACHINES swiftly repair the damage to his chest and shoulder. \nMARCUS twitches, freaking out, struggling in his bonds-- \nTHE DETACHED LEG twitches as well. \nSERENA Calm down, Marcus.   It's all right. \nSERENA is on the other side of a GLASS PANEL, operating computer controls. This is an automated surgical environment, the work on Marcus carried out by various MACHINES and MICROTOOLS-- busy HYDRAULIC ARMS, LASERS, etc. \nMARCUS Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being your guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?! (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSERENA Repairing you. \nMARCUS You all work for Skynet! \nSERENA Please. Skynet works for us. It's only a program-- a tool, a means to an end. \nMARCUS The end of the world. \nSERENA Its sole purpose is to protect humanity. \nMARCUS lets out a horrified, bitter laugh. \nSERENA (cont'd) Listen to me. Skynet was designed to detect threats, make projections and implement solutions. As soon as it came on line, it factored in war, disease, environmental destruction-- and calculated a high probability of total human extinction within two hundred years. The human race was doomed... unless we were transformed. \nTHE SURGICAL TABLE swivels, bringing MARCUS into alignment with the repaired leg. In moments it's reattached, the plastic skin thermosealed at the joint. \nMARCUS Into-- this? A brain in a box? \nSERENA Skynet had access to the entire defense web-- including Project Angel. It determined hybrids were the only path to salvation. \nMARCUS Destroying the human race in order to save it. \nTHE LASER TOOLS and HYDRAULIC ARMS now move on their ceiling racks, coming close to MARCUS' FACE. The TABLE INVERTS, exposing the back of his head. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARCUS (cont'd) What are you doing? \nSERENA When the resistance attacked our installation, we were forced to self-destruct. We would have taken you with us, but we thought you were in a permanent coma... \nTHE LASERS start cutting into the back of Marcus' head, BURNING through the plastic SKIN. MARCUS lets out a CRY of rage, strains at his bonds. \nSERENA (cont'd) Your interface was never installed. \nCLOSE as the HYDRAULIC ARM attaches to the back of Marcus' head and removes a section of STEEL SKULL... \nREVEALING THE SURFACE of a HUMAN BRAIN, gray matter enmeshed in WIRES and CIRCUITRY beneath a clear PLASTIC CASING, in a bath of pale reddish LIQUID. Tiny NEURAL SPARKS fire. \nMARCUS No, stop... I don't want it! You're dead inside, all of you! \nSERENA We're immortal. No sane person would choose to live in pain, forever. Soon you'll understand. \nCLOSE as an elaborate ELECTRONIC INTERFACE MODULE is fixed at the base of Marcus' exposed brain. \nON MARCUS' FACE - his expression of agony vanishes, his features become peaceful. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT \nMARCUS is dressed in fresh clothes, his damage repaired-- and he seems more at ease than we've yet seen him. He walks beside SERENA, who wears a small EARPIECE, a high-tech cellphone device. They smile as they pass other HYBRIDS on the late shift. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSERENA How are you feeling, Marcus? \nMARCUS I'm not sure I know how to describe it. \nSERENA It's called happiness. You've been angry all your life. You don't know what it's like to feel... a part of something. \nSERENA has moved to a COMPUTER TERMINAL, one of a few here. \nSERENA (cont'd) Display recent arrivals for processing. \nIMAGES begin to appear on the screen-- small inset PHOTOS, each with a BARCODE. They quickly fill the screen. MARCUS leans forward, squinting. \nON SCREEN - dozens of FACES, PHOTOS taken inside the TUBES, mostly looking terrified. \nMARCUS shakes his head. \nSERENA (cont'd) Next page... \nON SCREEN - a new SET OF FACES appears one by one on the screen. This time, STAR and KYLE are among them, next to each other. \nMARCUS That's them. \nMARCUS touches the screen, two fingers, one on each of the kid's faces. THEIR IMAGES expand to fill the screen, side by side, KYLE on the left. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKYLE'S IMAGE, the date 10.16.18... the time, 22:19:23.      The word, in green: PROCESSED. \nSERENA smiles. \nSERENA Good news. He'll soon be part of the network-- you'll be able to connect with him. \nMove to STAR'S IMAGE.       10.15.18... 22:20:49... and the word, in red: TERMINATED. \nSERENA (cont'd) I'm sorry about the girl, Marcus. She didn't suffer. \nMarcus takes this in, his face shows pain. Then SERENA grasps his hand-- in moments, he's smiling. \nMARCUS Of course.     I... I understand. \nSuddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant EXPLOSION. SERENA releases MARCUS, listens in her earpiece. \nMARCUS (cont'd) What is it? \nSERENA I don't know-- I have to go.    Will you be all right? (off his smile and nod) Of course you will. \nShe touches him once more and moves off, leaving him alone here. We'll hear other far off EXPLOSIONS from time to time during the following. MARCUS stares at-- \nHIS FRIENDS' FACES, which slowly FADE TO BLACK, replaced by his own REFLECTION. Seeing his own face, his smile vanishes. \nMARCUS is going through a terrible internal struggle, the interface fighting his own natural emotions. He backs away from the machine, looks around at the brains, all the lives destroyed. \nHurrying past the wall of brains, he moves a hand to the base of his skull... with an ANGRY CRY-- (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \n--his FINGERS dig into the plastic skin at the back of his HEAD-- \nMARCUS grits his teeth, this is incredibly hard to do, but-- \n--he RIPS THE INTERFACE MODULE from his skull-- CONNECTIONS SPARK, we glimpse STEEL SKULL and the encased BRAIN beneath. \nMARCUS hurls the DEVICE to the floor, its elaborate CIRCUITRY SHATTERS. He reels with momentary anguish at what he's just given up-- then he moves out of there with determination. \nEXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT \nFIRE and SMOKE in the distance, VEHICLES MOVING fast amidst the destruction. It looks like the place is under attack. \nMARCUS moves purposefully across the campus-- suddenly HEADLIGHTS illuminate him. He dives out of the way as-- \nA FUTURISTIC ATV roars past at high speed.   It's followed moments later by a massive SKYNET TANK. \nMARCUS scrambles to his feet, continues on his way. \nINT.   TIME DISPLACEMENT CHAMBER - NIGHT \nTHE PHYSICIST is SLAMMED against a wall. He never loses his unperturbed expression as MARCUS manhandles him. THE CLOCK reads 01:05. \nMARCUS I need to go back! \nPHYSICIST The wormholing fluctuates, right now it's oscillating between three and six hours-- \nMARCUS What do I do? \nPHYSICIST Just breach the sphere. But you could materialize anywhere in a mile radius-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHE MAN'S MOUTH twists and grimaces, making ELECTRONIC STATIC from the FRIED VOICEBOX. MARCUS is taken by surprise when-- \n--THE DECAPITATED BODY lunges at him, knocks the LASER from his grasp. After a brief STRUGGLE, MARCUS spins the engineer's HEAD to face his body. He grabs the INTERFACE at the base of his neck. \nMARCUS (cont'd) I pull this off and you'll be in a world of pain! \nTHE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARCUS (cont'd) Last chance. Let them out. \nAT A CONTROL TERMINAL, the one-handed, headless BODY taps keys and controls. MARCUS holds the Engineer's HEAD so that he can see over his own shoulder. Moments later-- \n--the MACHINE HUM winds down. THE MONITORS flash the word \"ABORT,\" the PANELS begin to OPEN. \nMARCUS addresses the HEAD in his hand. \nMARCUS (cont'd) I'm gonna need your clothes. \nTHE HEADLESS BODY begins to unbutton its shirt. \nMOMENTS LATER - CLOSE as KYLE'S TRAY slides out of his CHAMBER. The RESTRAINTS retract automatically. He sits up, looking toward-- \n--STAR, on the next tray.   She hasn't moved, her eyes closed. \nKYLE No! \nHe climbs off his tray, takes her in his arms.    She starts awake. \nSTAR What? \nAround them, the dozen OTHER PRISONERS are getting to their feet, surprised at their sudden freedom. \nMARCUS approaches KYLE, buttoning his new shirt. \nKYLE Marcus! \nThe two kids hurry to him, Marcus hands Star her BASEBALL CAP, rescued from the trash. As she puts it on: \nSTAR I knew you'd come. \nTHE PRISONERS are already on the move, frantically dashing out of the lab ahead of our heros. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMARCUS We've gotta get out of here. \nHe leads the kids out the way he came, passing... \nTHE ENGINEER, in underwear, sitting in a corner, cradling his head in his lap. His remaining hand strokes his interface, his eyes closed in a blissful expression. \nINT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT \nTHE PRISONERS smash the GLASS DOORS off their hinges, and charge past-- \nTHE CONTROL ROBOTS, which are now coming to life. ELECTRIC BURSTS drop a couple of slow-moving ESCAPEES as they dash into the garage and make for-- \n--ANY AVAILABLE VEHICLE. Former PRISONERS hijack BUSES, HYDROGEN CARS. Pure chaos, it feels like a prison riot. \nMARCUS, STAR and KYLE weave amidst the robots and humans. \nMARCUS Stay down! \nKYLE and STAR take cover behind a concrete post just as-- \n--PLASMA BURSTS explode around them. \nSKELETAL TERMINATORS armed with PLASMA RIFLES are pouring in through the OPENING GARAGE GATE. \nA STOLEN BUS heads for the exit, KNOCKING a couple of TERMINATORS aside and SMASHING through the rising GATE, clearing a path for others to follow. \nA SKELETAL TERMINATOR sets its sights on a MOVING HYDROGEN CAR, which follows the bus-- \nTERMINATOR POV - RED FILTER, HIGHLIGHTING BULL, the DRIVER. \"TARGET ACQUIRED - TERMINATE.\" \nTHE TERMINATOR SHOOTS HIS RIFLE through the car's windshield-- it EXPLODES, close to KYLE and STAR, the building SHAKES. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n--THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN TURRET SWIVELING at them. \nAS IT FIRES, MARCUS SWERVES onto a LAWN and-- \n--CRASHES THROUGH a PICTURE WINDOW. \nINT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT \nA handsome HYBRID COUPLE, in pajamas in front of a BIG SCREEN TV. They turn and react as the ATV skitters through the room and down a hallway. The ATV is followed a moment later by-- \n--THE TANK, which TAKES OUT THE ENTIRE WALL, BARRELLING through the living room and BURYING the HYBRIDS in RUBBLE. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARCUS takes the ATV UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. \nTHE TANK keeps SMASHING through the house, as its TURRET SWIVELS upward and BLASTS AWAY. \nUPSTAIRS - THE PLASMA BLAST COMES THROUGH the FLOOR, just missing the ATV as it rockets through a MASTER BEDROOM, toward a BALCONY. \nDOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK tears through an upscale RECREATION ROOM, splintering a POOL TABLE, smashing through PINBALL MACHINES. \nUPSTAIRS - MARCUS takes the ATV straight out onto the BALCONY, THROUGH THE RAILING and INTO THE AIR. \nDOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK BLASTS THROUGH a KITCHEN and BATHROOM on its way out the other side of the house. \nEXT.   LUXURY HOME/BACK YARD - NIGHT \nTHE ATV JUST CLEARS an enormous SWIMMING POOL, landing hard on the far deck and moving on, fast. \nTHE TANK SMASHES THROUGH THE BACK WALL and-- \n--TAKES A NOSEDIVE into the pool, out of commission. \nINT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT \nTHE RUBBLE in the living room shifts and the HYBRID COUPLE extract themselves, taking in their destroyed home with placid expressions. \nEXT.   RESIDENTIAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT \nA moment's breather. Marcus slows the vehicle, which WOBBLES and SMOKES from all it's been through. He looks around. \nKYLE Where are we going? \nMARCUS There. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe points toward the COAST, we see a MARINA in the distance, a BOAT moored at a DOCK. \nMARCUS steers the ATV down a slope toward the shoreline. \nEXT.   COASTLINE/DOCK - NIGHT/DAWN \nMARCUS, KYLE and STAR leap off the ATV and sprint for a MOTORBOAT. Kyle carries the rifle now. \nAs they near the boat, MARCUS reacts to the sight of-- \n--RED EYES FLICKERING in the darkness at the END OF THE DOCK, the BLUE GLOW of a RIFLE CHARGING. \nMARCUS leaps in front of KYLE and STAR shielding them with his BODY. The PLASMA BLAST envelops him, MARCUS is blown-- \n--INTO THE WATER. KYLE and STAR are flattened by the force of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. Their PLASMA RIFLE lies a few feet away. \nTHE SKELETAL TERMINATOR who shot Marcus moves swiftly down the dock, its PLASMA RIFLE trained on the water now. It moves past Kyle and Star, who remain motionless on the ground, and goes to the edge of the dock-- \n--BLAM! STAR snatches up their own PLASMA WEAPON, and BLASTS the thing in the back, knocking it INTO THE WATER, which is only a few feet deep here. As it rises, SHE FIRES again, taking the Terminator's head off. It goes under. \nTHE SKY is beginning to LIGHTEN now as, a moment later, MARCUS EMERGES. As he climbs from the shallow water back onto the dock, Kyle and Star stare at him with astonishment. \nSeeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage-- there's METAL exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his FACE partially TORN AWAY, ONE EYE MISSING. He tries to speak, but can only manage an ELECTRONIC CROAK. \nKyle and Star back away from him. \nKYLE He's not real. \nMarcus shakes his head, starts to move toward them.   STAR raises the rifle, points it at him. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSTAR Don't come any closer! \nMARCUS (cont'd) No! \nSLO-MO:   seeing Marcus, Serena reaches into her coat-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARCUS moves at the same time, to grab his PLASMA RIFLE-- \nSERENA leaps off the ladder, aiming a small, powerful PLASMA WEAPON. \nSERENA fires first-- \nBLAM! THE PLASMA BLAST catches MARCUS in the shoulder and BLOWS his GUN ARM clean off. His PLASMA RIFLE discharges, BLOWING a HOLE in the side of the sub, near the floor-- WATER gushes in like a FIREHOSE. \nLEAVE SLO-MO. Spun around by the force of the blast, MARCUS lands on his back, SPARKS and SEVERED CABLES protruding from his damaged shoulder. An ALARM KLAXON SOUNDS. \nPRISONERS and DOCTORS SCREAM and scramble for cover-- \nCONNOR steps in front of KATE to shield her, they back away through the WATER BLAST, CONNOR FIRING at SERENA-- \nSERENA takes numerous HITS from the EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, which take off PIECES of her, but she keeps coming, FIRES again-- \n--HITTING CONNOR in the lower abdomen. He's thrown backward, KATE cries out and throws herself on top of him. His gun has gone flying. \nSERENA turns her attention to MARCUS, standing over him, plasma weapon aimed point-blank at his head. \nSERENA Why, Marcus?

He's cleaned up a bit, wears fresh clothes (one sleeve pinned up). He seems weary, wrung out, his systems damaged. He'll move stiffly through the following scene, like a stroke victim. \nSTAR sits beside him, a hand on his arm.   BLAIR approaches from down the corridor. \nBLAIR Marcus... I need to head back to my unit. \nMARCUS nods, keeps his head bowed. \nBLAIR (cont'd) What about you? \nHis voice is still WEAK. \nMARCUS I have no idea. I should be dead... \nSTAR But you're alive.

We hear the voice of a PRIEST: \nPRIEST Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art beside me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me... \nCAMERA PULLS BACK, straight up. MARCUS lies in his cot, staring at the ceiling. He's smoking a CIGARETTE. This OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals a PRIEST with a BIBLE, in a folding chair beside him. A CHESS SET, stacks of BOOKS, WRITING MATERIALS in the cell. TWO GUARDS wait, shackles in hand. \nMARCUS has no interest in scripture. He blows a cloud of SMOKE which drifts in the direction of the PRIEST, who blinks and shuts his bible. \nOne of the GUARDS unlocks the cell door for-- \nDR. SERENA KOGAN. She's in her 30's-50's, brilliant, attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head. She carries a CLIPBOARD. The PRIEST backs off to give her some privacy with Marcus. \nSERENA Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm with Project Angel. You consented to donate your body to science... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARCUS Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it. \nSERENA You've been chosen for our research. \nMARCUS Chosen?    Lucky me. \nSERENA We just need a couple of signatures... \nMarcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he notes that her hands are SHAKING. \nMARCUS You don't need to be scared. \nSERENA I'm not.    It's nerve degeneration. \nMARCUS looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering her sparse hair. \nMARCUS Cancer? \nSERENA (NODS) You're not the only one with a death sentence. \nMARCUS meets her eyes.      She studies him a beat. \nSERENA (cont'd) What you're doing is important, Marcus. Our work is still highly experimental... but you may be helping people in ways you can't begin to imagine. \nMARCUS I'm a regular hero. \nWith that sarcastic comment, he SIGNS HIS NAME-- we see the words \"PROJECT ANGEL\" at the top of DENSE TYPE on the form. \nSERENA takes the clipboard, starts to rise.         She touches his hand for a moment. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSERENA Thank you.     And... I'm sorry. \nMARCUS No one lives forever. \nTHE GUARD sees SERENA out. \nINT.

Marcus, this is your last opportunity to make a confession... \nMARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths, struggling not to succumb to fear. \nPRIEST (V.O.)

These aircraft no longer bear traditional U.S. insignia-- they're painted in WILD COLORS, graffiti lettering says things like: \"BOT BLASTER,\" \"KILL FOR CONNOR,\" \"RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINES,\" etc... Resistance fighters. \nMotley military and civilian CHOPPERS LAND in the CORNFIELD, disgorging RESISTANCE SOLDIERS. These are human troops in high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional ASSAULT WEAPONS. \nTHE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind the SOLDIERS. The troops run toward-- \n--AN OPENING which has been blown into the ground, the remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker-buster hit. \nA surviving TERMINATOR rises from the SINGED CORN, FIRES its PLASMA RIFLE-- \n--DROPPING A SOLDIER.

A FIELD MOUSE has nested in its skull cavity, seeking shelter from RAINDROPS. \nMonths have passed, the season changed-- CORN long dead, a black stubble. RAIN falls. \nA PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving.       The MUD roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE... \nEYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT. He opens his mouth, makes a few GUTTURAL NOISES... then SCREAMS. \nCAMERA PULLS UP from MARCUS' AGONIZED FACE... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   PLATEAU - EVENING \nBARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he sees in the distance-- \nA DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble. \nEXT.   DEAD CITY - NIGHT \nMOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground, partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN. \nMOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed, faded sign: \"BEWARE OF DOG.\" \nWIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS-- rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted, windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell. \nMARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips. \nA COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands. \nA HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket. \nMARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER. \nMARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame. He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush, feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away. \nHe rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken glass: \"SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!\" \n", "test2_true": "FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good. \nINT.   RUINED BAR - NIGHT \nPartially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now, again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with-- \nA DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY. \nMARCUS Hallelujah. \nHe unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES, instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nMEMORY MONTAGE: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic POVs, blurred, altered. SFX of HEARTBEATS, a RESPIRATOR. \n--WEBS of TUBES and FIBER-OPTICS FILLS THE FRAME. \n--GRIDS OF LASER LIGHT scan rapidly INTO CAMERA. \n--DIGITAL DISPLAYS blink through murky LIQUID. SERENA moves INTO FRAME, a look of concentration on her face as she peers through the LIQUID, INTO CAMERA. She starts to smile. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.   DEAD CITY - DAY \nBLUE SKY. TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK. A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT. \nMARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her expression recalls the beckoning vision. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster. Then he carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on. \nEXT.   HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nDeserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels. MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're in mostly flat, treeless plains. \nFrom the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through the darkness. Marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the first living creatures he's seen. He waves. \nMARCUS Hey!   Yo, over here! \nThe FIGURES pause, turning toward him in unison. \nMARCUS (cont'd) Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt like I was the last man on... \nHe freezes in his tracks. These aren't humans. They're T- 400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan him. \nMARCUS (cont'd) Oh God... \nMarcus backs away, runs.      The T-400s stare after him-- but don't fire. \nANGLE THROUGH BINOCULAR MASK - MARCUS running for all he's worth, heading toward the viewer. We hear a muttering VOICE: \nBOY Hey mister, where you goin' in such a hurry? \nANGLE ON A BOY, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid teens. He crouches on the supports of a FREEWAY SIGN. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe wears layers of TATTERED, OVER-SIZED CLOTHING.     He scrambles quickly down from the sign. \nAT AN OFF-RAMP, Marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the freeway, when-- \nTHE BOY emerges from behind some RUBBLE, holding a HANDGUN in one hand, a lit OIL LANTERN in the other. \nBOY (cont'd) Whoah, whoah-- hang on there.   Got any food? \nMarcus raises his hands, shakes his head.     The boy looks him over dubiously. \nBOY (cont'd) You look like you been eating pretty good. \nThe boy moves closer, puts down the LANTERN, frisks Marcus with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other. \nMARCUS You're human... you can see me, you can touch me. This place is real. \nTHE BOY makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of PAPER SCRAPS from Marcus' pocket. \nMARCUS (cont'd) I thought I was in hell. \nBOY (raises an eyebrow) This sure ain't heaven. \nMARCUS Those things with masks, red eyes-- \n", "test2_id": 88, "test3_input": "MARCUS emerges, the FLAMES still visible on the other side of the river, behind him. He doesn't look back, as he moves into Skynet turf. This side of the river isn't wooded, everything has a concrete, industrial feel. Marcus is a mess, both clothing and skin are shredded and charred. \nHe nearly bumps into a SKELETAL STEEL TERMINATOR, which emerges from behind a concrete wall. The terminator trains its PLASMA RIFLE on MARCUS, scans him, RED EYES glowing... (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTERMINATOR'S POV - RED FILTER, MARCUS' FORM is TARGETED. READ-OUTS on the side, the HIGHLIGHTED WORDS \"NON-ORGANIC - DO NOT TERMINATE.\" \nTHE TERMINATOR turns from MARCUS, no longer interested, moving off on its preprogrammed patrol. \nMARCUS moves up a sloping, CONCRETE EMBANKMENT.   At the top of the rise, he sees, spread out before him-- \nEXT.   SKYNET TERRITORY - DAY \n--a hideous industrial sprawl, OPEN GAS FLAMES, SMOKING FACTORIES, rumbling VEHICLES, H-Ks, TERMINATOR TROOPS on patrol. Nothing green, a GREY HAZE hangs over the landscape. \nAfter a moment, MARCUS shakes his head and gamely soldiers on, moving along the edge of the elevated embankment. \nEXT.   SKYNET PERIPHERY - DAY \nMARCUS moves past banks of ANTI-AIRCRAFT guns and MISSILE LAUNCHERS, interspersed with slowly rotating RADAR TRACKING DISHES-- the first line of defense. From this fortress-like wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond. \nMARCUS reacts to a CAWING SOUND above, looks up to see-- \n--A CROW perching on an overhead WIRE.   A second later-- \nZAP! A BLUE PLASMA PULSE blasts the thing to smithereens, a few BLACK FEATHERS drift down as-- \n--a T-400 (same mask-like face we saw earlier) lowers its plasma weapon and strolls on. Target practice. \nMARCUS stays out of the way of the TERMINATOR LEGIONS patrolling near the riverside. \nEXT.   DEMOLITION SITE - DAY \nMARCUS heads inland, past the ruins of a CHURCH-- WALLS with the remains of stained glass WINDOWS, STATUES OF SAINTS. Hearing RUMBLING NOISES, Marcus hurries out of the way as-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA WALL collapses, pushed down by an automated SKYNET BULLDOZER. This gigantic, self-operated construction machine has a swivelling CAMERA HEAD instead of a cab. Its giant TREADS roll over the STONE STATUES, crushing them to dust. \nEXT.   CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY \nMARCUS keeps moving into Skynet's turf. The demolition gives way to massive CONSTRUCTION, as the robots remake the human world in their own image. \nCONSTRUCTION ROBOTS erect a low-slung STEEL FRAME structure, automated CRANES and SUPPLY TRUCKS about. These robots are oversized versions of the steel terminators we know, but with multiple limbs bearing WELDING TOOLS, and TREADS instead of legs. Marcus watches as BEAMS are quickly welded into place by telescoping steel arms. \nEXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY \nMARCUS continues into the completed robot city. Skynet's ARCHITECTURE is featureless, bland, purely practical: single- story, windowless CONCRETE or STEEL structures with massive open DOORWAYS to accommodate their largest machines. A RED GLOW emanates from the interiors, the robots' preferred lighting scheme. No sidewalks or signs, just thick GRIDS of POWER LINES and PIPES overhead. Constant NOISE of BUZZING POWER, RATTLING MACHINES, etc. \nMARCUS steps inside one of these buildings-- \nINT.   TERMINATOR FACTORY - DAY \nThis TERMINATOR ASSEMBLY PLANT is an intricate, multi-leveled clockwork maze of moving CONVEYORS and INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS. \nELECTRONICS and HYDRAULICS are ROBOTICALLY SOLDERED in place. STEEL PRESSES stamp out TERMINATOR PARTS-- TORSOS, FACE PLATES, SPINAL COLUMNS, LIMBS. \nPartially-completed PARTS are moved by CONVEYOR to ASSEMBLY STATIONS, where LIMBS and HEADS are JOINED to TORSOS, elaborate OPERATIONS carried out by INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS, like the ones in present-day factories. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSYNTHETIC SKIN is SPRAYED OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON in precise amounts, building up to create human features... this is a T-400. \nAn INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ARM picks up a CPU from a DRY-ICE CONTAINER. The CPU features the distinctive, linked rectangles familiar from the earlier films. The arm lifts this gingerly to a TERMINATOR SKELETON and INSERTS IT into the STEEL SKULL, SCREWING A SEAL over the hole. \nTHE RED EYES flicker to life, and THE ARMATURE releases the TERMINATOR, which moves away under its own power. It removes a PLASMA WEAPON from a WALL RACK, moving past-- \n--the dumbfounded MARCUS. \nTHE TERMINATOR joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a treaded SKYNET TANK with a PLASMA CANNON and FLAMETHROWER. There are numerous TANKS here, awaiting deployment. \nEXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY \nRounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, MARCUS sees all the ROBOTS and SMALL VEHICLES clearing into small NICHES built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path for him. It takes him a moment to realize it's not him they're responding to-- a RUMBLE BUILDS... \nA convoy of GIGANTIC SKYNET TRUCKS-- a half-dozen modified SEMIS now driven by CPUS-- bear down on MARCUS at extremely high speed. They carry construction supplies: massive STEEL BEAMS, CONCRETE PIPES, etc. And there's barely inches of clearance on either side. \nThese things aren't slowing down. There's nowhere for Marcus to duck out of the way. He has no choice but to RUN, as fast as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly. \nMARCUS THROWS HIMSELF to the concrete in the middle of the street, pressing his body flat as the LEAD TRUCK passes over him, the wheels missing him by inches. \n", "test3_true": "--and DRAGS MARCUS beneath the vehicle, ripping off chunks of flesh. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMarcus CRIES OUT, crawls ahead and clings to a forward portion of the undercarriage, keeping himself just above the pavement. His LEFT LEG, twisted and damaged, still drags on the asphalt, throwing up SPARKS. \nOVERHEAD ANGLE ON THE TRUCK - CAMERA PULLS BACK straight above the MOVING VEHICLE, amidst the convoy speeding down this sunken artery. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING UPWARD to reveal an AERIAL VIEW of Skynet's city. Seen from above, the rectilinear STRUCTURES, criss-crossing POWER LINES and SPEEDING VEHICLES strongly resemble a PULSING CIRCUIT BOARD. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY \nJOHN CONNOR moves grimly down a narrow, steel passageway, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. He reaches the MP, outside the door. \nCONNOR I need to talk to the prisoner. \nThe MP looks a little surprised, but says nothing.    He undoes the LATCH on the door and opens it for Connor. \nINT.   COMMAND CENTER/INTERROGATION CELL - DAY \nA bare, windowless space with only a cot, a metal chair and a bedpan. BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared. CONNOR gestures for the MP to close the door behind him. \nCONNOR Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry about the way you've been treated, but we're forced to take every precaution. I'm John Connor. \nBlair's mighty impressed, in spite of the circumstances.       She leaps to her feet, stands at attention and salutes. \nBLAIR Sir. \nCONNOR At ease.   Please, sit. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCONNOR pulls up the chair, close to Blair, who sits on the bed. His tone is careful, controlled. \nCONNOR (cont'd) I've gone over your record, lieutenant. You're a good soldier, flown a lot of missions... (BEAT) Why in God's name would you help a terminator escape? \nBLAIR Sir-- he isn't a terminator.     He's human. \nCONNOR We know he's crossed into Skynet territory, why would he do that if he isn't-- \nBLAIR He's trying to find his friends. \nCONNOR What friends? \nBLAIR A couple of kids. They were taken in a Skynet transport, probably to some kind of prison camp-- he said their names were Star and Kyle. \nConnor blinks at this, alert. \nCONNOR Kyle. \nBlair picks up on his interest, but doesn't understand it. \nBLAIR Mm... Kyle something.    With an `R.' \nCONNOR Reese. \nBLAIR That's it.

COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY \nPartway down the hallway, CONNOR encounters KATE, who walks with him, takes in his expression. \nKATE What is it, John? \nCONNOR I always knew I'd have to find him someday. I just didn't know how. \nKATE What?   Find who? \nCONNOR My father. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   LABORATORY - DAY \nSTART CLOSE on KYLE'S HAND, clutching STAR'S tightly.

SUMMER On some. 
TOM I like how you dress. 
SUMMER Yeah? What if I started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg? 
TOM (BEAT) Please don't. 
A tall, well-built, GOOD-LOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly appeared next to them. 
DOUCHE (to Summer) Hey. 
Tom and Summer stop talking. 
SUMMER Hey. 
DOUCHE How's it going? 
SUMMER Ok. 
Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more amused than concerned. 
DOUCHE You live around here? 
SUMMER Yeah not too far. 
DOUCHE I've never seen you here before. 
SUMMER You're not too perceptive. 
DOUCHE Ha. That's funny. 
Tom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry about. 
DOUCHE So, uh, let me buy you a drink. 
SUMMER No thank you. 
As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of them together. 
DOUCHE Are you with this guy? 
Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now. 
TOM (BEAT) Hi. I'm Tom. 
DOUCHE Whatever. (to Summer) Come on, one drink. What are you drinking? 
SUMMER Sorry, no thank you. 
Tom is pleased. 
DOUCHE You're serious? This guy? 
And now he's pissed. 
TOM Hey buddy -- 
SUMMER (to the Douche) Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm just not interested. Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok? 
DOUCHE It's a free country. 
Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now what?" After a beat: 
DOUCHE So you and him, huh? I can't believe that. Is this guy really your boyfriend? 
And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion, coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE. 
Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling. 
Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's fist). 
There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised. And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM. 
CUT TO: 
EXT BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Having been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place. Tom is a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it. 
TOM Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt. 
Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first time she's furious.

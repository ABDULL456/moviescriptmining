LOUIS Don't say anything else, okay? I'm telling you, keep your mouth shut. 
Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says; 
LOUIS I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word. 
MELANIE Okay, Lou-is. 
That did it! 
Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots her... BAM... in the belly. 
She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down. 
BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground. 
One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good. 
Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF HIM. He looks around, then yells out; 
LOUIS See, just where I fuckin' said it was! 
He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse. 
We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie, and yells through the passenger window; 
LOUIS Hey, look. I found it! 
He drives away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY 
Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space in the parking lot. 
SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW: 
"TIME: 4:04" 
Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the Del Amo Mall. 
INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY 
Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the Robinson's/May store. 
He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him. 
SALESGIRL Can I show you something? 
MAX Not right now. I'm just killing time waiting for my wife. But thanks, anyway. 
SALESGIRL Sure thing. If anything grabs you, don't be shy. 
MAX Thanks, I won't. 
She goes off. 
He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit. 
AMY Oh, my God. You look so cool. 
Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out. 
Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under his breath; 
MAX (CONT'D) (low) And away we go. 
Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from a distance. "This looks pretty good on me." 
Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer Clothes. 
He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses on a rack. 
He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling. 
He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room. 
He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance. 
He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room. 
Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on his before he can see a reaction. 
Max continues his fake browsing. 
He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag close to her chest. 
She and Louis disappear. 
He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with cash, then leaves stopping to say; 
JACKIE Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in there. Looks like beach towels. 
She's gone. 
Amy is left alone by the cashier counter. 
It's Max's turn. 
As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance, he says to himself; 
MAX Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen years dealing with people who take incredible risks. You walk over to that counter, you're gonna find out what it's like. 
Max takes a few moments... 
... then walks over to Amy. 
MAX Excuse me, but my wife thinks she left a bag of beach towels in the fitting room? 
AMY Yeah, I think they're back there. Go get 'em. There's nobody in there. I think they're in the last stall. 
MAX Thanks. 
Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one. 
He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says; 
MAX Got 'em, thanks. 
AMY Sure thing. 
Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the parking lot. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY 
He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly, never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the car door as an excuse to look back at the mall. 
It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him. He made it. It worked.

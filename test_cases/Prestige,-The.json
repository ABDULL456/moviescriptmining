As TITLES END- \nBORDEN (V.O.) Are you watching closely? A SECOND BLACK CAT races into frame, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the woods beyond and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLUTTERED WORKSHOP -- DAY \nMoving along a row of CANARIES in CAGES. \nCUTTER (V.O.) Every magic trick consists of three part, or acts... Stop at a cage. Weathered HANDS envelope the canary. Hands and voice belongs to a man in his 60's- CUTTER. \nCUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) The first part is called the Pledge... A LITTLE GIRL pershes on a chest in the workshop, watching. \nCUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...the magician shows you something \nORDINARY- Cutter moves to a small ORNATE CAGE resting on a prop table. \nCUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) A deck of cards, ar a bird... \nINT. SCALA THEATRE, LONDON -- NIGHT \nA packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED MAN, his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air. \nCUTTER (V.O.) ...or a man. A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Bearded Man from the aisle. He shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed. \nCUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) He show you this object, and pledges to you its utter normality... Bearbed Man and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down towards the stage... \nOn which stands the magician, leaning on his cane, smiling. This is ROBERT ANGIER, 35, an American. Looming over him is a large and complex ELETRICAL MACHINE. \nCUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Perhaps he asks you to inspect it... \nBearbed Man, FASCINATED, and other Volunteers look over the vast machine. As angier GESTURES theatrically at the various features of the metal and glass apparatus. \nCUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...to see that it is indeed real... \nAs the Assistant leads the Volunteers off the stage, Bearded Man slips through the gap at the side of the curtains- \nCUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...unaltered... \nINT. STAGE THEATRE, BACKSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS \n-looks around, DISORIENTED, then darts for some stairs leagind below stage where he runs into a burly STAGEHAND. \nCUTTER (V.O.) ...normal. \nSTAGEHAND Where'd you think you're going?! \nCUTTER (V.O.) But, of course, it probably isn't... \nBearded Man pulls off his beard, revealing the face of ALFRED BORDEN, mid 30's. \nBEARDED MAN I'm part of the act, you fool! \nThe Stagehand raises his eyebrows and steps aside. Borden RACES down below the stage. Cutter approaches the Stagehand. \nCUTTER Who was that? \nINT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nAs the machine GROANS to life. SPARKING and CRACKLING, Angier gazes at it, forgettig his audience. Entranced. Possessed. \nINT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nBorden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE EYES sitting nearby. Borden waves a hand in front of the \nINT. WORKSHOP -- DAY \nCutter gently places the canary into the ornate cage. \nCUTTER (V.O.) The second act is called the Turn... \nINT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT \nAngier, facing the audience, steps into the machine. \nCUTTER (V.O.) The magician takes the ordinary something... \nINT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nBorden lights a MATCH. In front of him is a LARGE GLASS TANK FILLED WITH WATER, ITs LID PROPPED OPEN. Borden frowns. \nCUTTER (V.O.) ...and makes it do something extraordianry. \nINT. WORKSHOP -- DAY \nCutter places a SILK SHAWL over the cage. Then SLAMS his hands down on the shawl, which FLATTENS- The Little Girl FLINCHES. Then STARES, FASCINATED. \nCUTTER (V.O.) Now you're looking for the secret. \nINT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT \nBolts of electicity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball of light which CRACKS- \nCUTTER (V.O.) But you won't find it... \nINT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nThe ROOM fills with light as a TRAPDOOR snaps open and a \nEXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY \nOWENS, 50's a lawyer, stands at the entry gate. The CAPTAIN of the guard walks out to greet him. \nCAPTAIN I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets. \nOwens raises his eyebrows. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air- he's convinced he'll try an escape. \nOwens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet. They walk along a hall wrought iron fence. The PRISON looms over them. A door in the prison opens and Borden emerges, trussed absurdly in chains held by two WARDERS. The other INMATES begin cattle-calling and whistling as BOrden is paraded up to a WOODEN SECTION of the fence. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear is if I leave him out with the others immates. \nAt the fence, the Warders lock the ends of their chains to a thick eye hook set into the ground. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) \n(TO WARDERS) Check the locks. Twice. \nThey check the locks. Then retreat to allow privacy. The Captain marches away. Borden looks at Owens. Bored. \nOWENS My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor. \nBorden says nothing. \nOWENS (CONT'D) I represent Lord Caldlow, and accomplished amateur magician and historian of magic- \nBORDEN How much? \nOWENS Lord Caldlow is interested in- \nBORDEN \n(COLD) How much for my tricks? \nOWENS Five thousand pounds. \nBORDEN Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the money's for him. \nOWENS I did. He offered to sell all of your tricks... except the most valuable one - The Transported Man. \nBORDEN I'd never forgive myself for selling my greatest trick. Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him. \nOWENS Even for your daughter? Borden looks up. Owens moves closer, quietly assertive. \nOWENS (CONT'D) If the newspapers are right, and you're for the drop, your daughter's going to need looking after \nBORDEN Fallon can take care of- \nOWENS Bernard Fallon? A man with a past even more obscure than your own? The court have already motioned to have the girl removed from his \"care\". No, the girl is to be an orphan. I've been to the work house... Owens looks around the prison yard. Shrugs. \nOWENS (CONT'D) It's better than this. Borden looks at Owens, hard. The Warders unlock Borden. \nOWENS (CONT'D) I'm offering you a way to warp up your affairs with dignity, and I'm offering your daughter a future. As Lord Caldlow's ward she will want for nothing. Ever. (hands him a card) Think it over. \nBorden absently VANISHES the card as a REFLEX. \nOWENS (CONT'D) Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this- (produces a leather \nBOUND JOURNAL) As a show of good faith. He thought it might be of interest. \nA SULLEN WALDER TALKS the journal, flicks through it. \nOWENS (CONT'D) Robert Angier's diary... It includes the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick... \nSullen hands the journal to Borden. Borden takes it. \nBORDEN Angier never learned my trick. \nOWENS Really? When he returned from Colorado he mounted a version of the Transported Man that the papers said was better, even... \n(WITH RELISH) Than your original. \nBORDEN \n(ACID) If you want Angier's secret you can dig him up and ask him for yourself. \nBorden TURNS, dragging the Warders with him. \nOWENS I want your secret, Mr.Borden... \n(LOUDER) Consider your daughter! \nINT. CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY \nBorden, on the bed, opens Angier's JOURNAL. Starts to read... \nANGIER (V.O.) A cypher. An enigma... \nCUT TO: \nLETTERS ON A PAGE. IN MEANINGLESS COMBINATIONS. GIBBERISH. \nINT. TRAIN, MOUNTAINS -- DUSK \nAniger, with a SIGH, closes a CARDBOARD-COVERED NOTEBOOK. OPENS his LEATHER-BOUND JOURNAL. Starts to write. \nANGIER (V.O.) ...Borden's cypher is simple- unraveled by a single word. Now it takes only patience. And a passion to know his mind. \nAngier lloks up at his own reflection in the train window. \nEXT. TRAIN STATION -- DUSK \nNo platform, no office, no sign. Just an electric streetlight which, as Angier watches, FLICKERS ON. Angier, leaning heavily on his cane limps over to the light and stares up at it as he's never seen one before. \nVOICE (O.S.) Mr.Angier? Welcome to Colorado Springs. \nMILTON Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman... \nMilton GESTURES to Julia- the MEN in the crowd go wild- hands in the air, catcalls. Smiling radiantly, Julia selects two young men, who SCRAMBLE up to the stage- ANGIER and BORDEN: younger, full of energy- Angier has no limp. \nThey spring onto stage, beside Julia and take the ROPE she offers them. Milton GRABS a HOOK that descends from the flies on a chain. \nCutter is watching fron the wings. \nMILTON (CONT'D) Are either of you two gentlemen gailors? \nBoth shakes their hands as they start to bind Julia with the ropes, Borden wrapping the rope around her wrists, Angier the one around her ankles. \nMILTON (CONT'D) Well, I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot... \nAs Borden finishes his knot tests it, it SLIPS APART. Borden frowns, hastly RETYING it, covering. \nCutter NOTICES. \nBorden finishes, glancing at julia who gives a small sign of assent with her eyes. As Angier finishes tying her ankles he sneaks a light KISS on her ankle. She frowns at him and raises her arms. Milton hooks the rope onto the chain. \nMilton gesticulates in the wings, Cutter signals to a stagehand who starts HOISTING Julia into the air. \nMilton wheels the tank under Julia's bare feet. Cutter feels for the handle of an AXE placed by his feet and pulls out a \nSTOPWATCH. JULIA looks down at Angier. They smile at each other. Julia DROPS into the tank with a massive splash- Milton SLAMS the lid shut, PADLOCKS it and raises a curtain around the tank... \nCutter checks his stopwatch, grips the handle of the axe... \nA grand GESTURE from Milton- the curtain around the tank DROPS- Julia is GONE. Milton raises the curtain again, then with another flourish, DROPS it to reveal JULIA, beside the tank, one arm in the air, dripping wet, smiling. \nThe audience erupts in APPLAUSE. Angier smiles produly. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT \nAngier, Borden and Julia sit around the cluttered room. Borden is in the middle of a passionate rant- \nBORDEN Milton's squadering their goodwill or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks- \nANGIER \n(AMUSED) Old favourites, please. \nBORDEN What about something fresh? He won't even try a bullet catch- \nCUTTER (O.S.) Bullet catch is suicide. \nThey turn. Cutter stands in the doorway, counting out money. \nCUTTER (O.S.) (CONT'D) All it takes is a smart-arse volunteer dropping a button down the barrel... \nBORDEN \n(INDICATES HIMSELF \nAND ANGIER) \nUSE PLANTS- \nANGIER He can't use plants for every trick. \nJULIA There'd be no seats left for the punters. \nBORDEN Fine- no bullet catch. But a real magician tries to invent something new, something other magicians scratch their heads over- \nCUTTER They sells it to them for a small fortune. \nCutter hands Angier some money. \nCUTTER (CONT'D) I suposse you have such a trick, Mr.Borden? \nANGIER Actually, I do. \nCUTTER Care to sell it? \nBORDEN No one else could do my trick. \nANGIER I could. \nBORDEN You don't even know what it is. \nANGIER Show it to me twice, I'll do it. \nCutter looks at Borden, thoughtful. \nCUTTER I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier. But if Borden here really has invented his masterpiece it might well be something only he can do. \nANGIER Why? \nCUTTER It might be something only he is prepared to do. (gestures to the props) my illusions employer, Mr.Milton, is a skilled showman. But Borden's right- he won't get his hands dirty. You want to see what it takes to make real magic- go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there who's got what it takes. \nANGIER Chung Ling Soo. \nBORDEN Tickets are pricey. \nCUTTER I know a lad on the door. You two watch his show- whoever tells me how he does his goldfish bowl trick gets the prize. \nANGIER Which is? \nCutter gives a sly smile. \nCUTTER Ten minutes onstage in front of my old friend, Mr.Ackerman. \nAngier and Borden prick up at the name. \nJULIA Who's Ackerman? \nBORDEN The most powerful theatrical agent in London. \nThe Judge follows Cutter, approaching a collection of magical apparatus, including a MASSIVE CRATE. Cutter looks up at it with AWE, touching the side where it says \"COLORADO SPRINGS\". \nJUDGE What's in there? \nCutter OPENS it, revealing metal and glass MACHINERY within. \nCUTTER Angier's machine. \nJUDGE You built this, Mr.Cutter? \nCUTTER \n(SHAKES HEAD) Oh no. This wasn't built by a magician... it was built by a wizard. \n(OFF LOOK) A man who can actually do the things a magician pretends to... \nCutter closes the crats. The JUDGE turns to other props. \nCUTTER (CONT'D) your honour, what will happen to these things when the trial is over? \nThe Judge is staring at a large glass tank. \nJUDGE They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo. An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case. \nCUTTER Don't let him take this. \nThe Judge looks over. Cutter is touching the crate. \nJUDGE Why ever not? \nCUTTER It's dangerous. \nJUDGE I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's get some simple and disappointing trick. \nCUTTER The most disappointing of all- it has no trick. It's real. \nThe Judge looks at Cutter. Smiles indulgently. Turns. \nJUDGE This is the tank Angier drowned in? \nCutter turns to look at the empty, smashed glass of the tank. Nods. Cutter indicates the top of the tank, where there is a PADLOCK. Cutter pushes down on a panel of the lid- \nCUTTER This lets the performer's hands reach the trick padlock... \n-a small section POPS open. \nJUDGE A standard magical apparatus for escapes? \nCUTTER With one important difference... \nCutter grabs the PADLOCK. Rattles it. \nCUTTER (CONT'D) This isn't a trick lock... it's been switched out for a real one. \nThe Judge stares at the tank, appaled. \nJUDGE What a way to kill someone. Why in God's name go to such lengths? \nCUTTER These are magicians, you honour. Showmen. Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to amaze. To shock. \nJUDGE Even without and audience? \nCutter stares at the tank- \nINSERT CUT: ANGIER SCREAMING BUBBLES. \nCUTTER There was and audience. (looks at Judge) See, the water tank had a particular signinficance for the two men... \nINT. THEATRE -- EVENING \nOnstage, A SIMILAR TANK FILLED WITH WATER. \nCUTTER (V.O.) A particular awful significance... \nJulia stands next to the tank. Milton adresses the audience. \nMILTON Which of you brave souls is willing bind this lovely young woman? \nMilton gestures to Julia- the crowd goes wild. Julia makes a show of deciding. She picks up Angier and Borden, who are made up to look different from the last performance. As they leap up onto stage, Borden makes eye contact with Cutter in the wings- Cutter's is a WARNING GLANCE. \nAs Angier ties Julia's ankles he can't resist tickling just under her toes- she KICKS him in the chin. \nBorden starts to wrap the rope around Julia's wrists in a particular fashion. Stops. Reconsiders. Julia NODS at him, encouring. Borden starts RETRYING the knot. \nCutter watches. His hand checking for the axe handle. \nBorden tests the rope- it is tight. Julia gives him the sign with her eyes- he steps back. Angier rises to his feet, grinning at Julia. As she raises her arms to the hook, she can't quite hide her smile back at him. \nMilton gives the sign and Julia is HOISTED into the air. Cutter slips his STOPWATCH out of his pocket as Milton moes the tank under Julia's bare feet. \nAngier looks up at Julia. Proud. She stares out over the audience, preparing herself. Looks down at Angier, smiling... \nJulia PLUNGES into the tank- Milton SLAMS the lid shut- Cutter checks his stopwatch, hand caressing the axe handle... \nMilton raises the curtain around the tank, then circles it, working his \"magic\". Angier shifts a little. Time passing... Milton looks at Cutter- TOO MUCH TIME... \nCutter GRASPS his axe and SPRINT at the tank- Milton RIPS the curtain down- Julia, one arm free, is CONVULSING... \nAngier and Borden look on in HORROR as Cutter SWINGS his axe into the glass- which CRACKS... cutter SWINGS again and again- the web of crackes GROWING, Julia's convulsions SLOWING, her eyes PLEADING with Angier's, until- \nCRASH- the glass gives way, FLOODING the stage- Cutter and Angier GRASP at Julia- FULL her onto the stage- Cutter ELBOWS Angier out of the way to POUND on Julia's chest- Borden wacthes, stunned, as Julia FLOPS, LIFELESS, onto the boards. Cutter looks up at Angier, stricken. \nAngier takes Julia in his arms, looking down at her staring eyes. He desperately BRUSHES water from Julias cheeks and forehead. Borden looks on, shen. \nBORDEN (V.O.) How often I've fought with my self over that night .. one half of me swearing bling that i tied a simple slip knot... the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double. I suppose I'll never know for sure- \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY \nALLEY Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people, but he would never talk about it. \nANGIER I understand discretion. I just want the machine. \nAlley looks at Angier. Thinking. \nALLEY Finish your drink. You'll have a special appreciation for our work. \nANGIER I thought it was a secret. \nALLEY \n(SMILES) You're a magician. Who's going to believe you? \nEXT. FIELDS, COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT \nThe storm has abated. Angier's cane into the muddy ground as he follows Alley through the moonlit field. \nThere are large glass GLOBES pushing out of the soil as if planted all around them. They stop in the middle of the field, looking down at the electric LIGHTS of the town. \nALLEY We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep- Mr.Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone. \nAlley checks his wacth by the moonlight. \nALLEY (CONT'D) Not long now. \nAs they watch, the lights of Colorado Springs DISAPPEAR. \nALLEY (CONT'D) Our equipment requires a great deal of current. Tesla eletrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need to. \nThe field around them EXPLODES with DAZZLING LIGHT. Angier laughs out in surprise- the field is full of a thousand large LIGHTBULBS, all glowing together. Alley bends down and picks up the nearest lightbulb -- as he does, the light in it extinguises. He tosses the bulb to Angier. Except for the size, it's a normal lightbulb. \nANGIER Where are the wires? \nALLEY Exactly. \nAngier bends and gently PUSHES the lightbulb into a random spot in the wet soil. The lightbulb FLICKERS on again. \nANGIER Where's the generator? \nALLEY You saw it last week. \nANGIER But that must be ten miles from here. \nALLEY Fifteen. And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed. (turns to leave) I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr.Angier. \nAngier bends to pick up his lightbulb. As he does, the light FADES in all of them, and the lights in town come back on. Angier is alone. \nINT. BATHROOM, LONDON -- DAY \nAngier has his head SUBMERGED in a sink full of water. He BURSTS FREE, GASPING- COLLA`PSES to the floor, SOBBING. \nINT. BATHROOM -- LATER \nAngier lays out MAKE-UP SUPPLIES. He takes out a BULLE. Places it on the sink next to a FALSE MOUNSTAGE. \nEXT. PRINCE'S ARMS BAR AND THEATRE \nRough. Unwelcoming. Crowded. A small \"stage\" at one end: Borden works his way through the Chinese rings. The crowd is JEERING. \nVOICE Get out your gun, Professor! \nSomeone BURLS a bottle at the stage- it narrowly misses. Borden GLARES out into the audience. Pulls out his GUN. \nBORDEN A volunteer. \nThe crowd SURGES forward with EAGER VOLUNTEERS. Fallon scans the crowd, passing over too-eager and too-drunk before settling on a MOUNSTACHED MAN and bringing him up onstage. \nBorden LOADS the pistol, hands it to Moustache and steps backwards, pulling his coat apart, CHALLENGING. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Are you man enought, sir? \nMOUSTACHE \n(QUIET) Yes. \nSomething in Moustache's tone makes Borden looks closely- behind the moustache... Angier. QUIVERING WITH TENSION. \nBorden looks at the trembling gun. Then at Angier. Spreads his hands, inviting. \nBORDEN \n(SMILES) I think not. \nAngier purses his lips, straining to pull the trigger. \nINSERT CUT: JULIA'S FACE, SCREAMING BUBBLES... \nAngier's eyes are almost closed as he SQUEEZES the TRIGGER- \nFallon HITS Angier JUMPS to Borden's side, GRABBING his BLEEDING HAND. The DROWS is SCREAMING, PUSHING for the door, os STRAINING for a closer look at Borden. \nAniger, SHOCKED, melts into the crowd. \nINT. PUB -- DAY \nAngier sits at the bar. Staring. He raises his pint glass. Downs it, then STOPS, looking at the bottom- there is a PLAYING CARD. He loos around. Cutter is sitting at a table with two fresh pints in front of him. Angier heads over. \nANGIER Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass. \nCUTTER Hasn't stopped you looking. \n(ANGIER SITS) I heard about a booking. Nice little theatre. Good up-and-coming magician. \nANGIER Who? \nCUTTER You. \nCUTTER (holds up cage) Put your hands on the sides... \nINT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY \nA heavy, disinterested man slouches in the third row of the empty theatre with a newspaper- MERRIT, the stage manager. Onstage, Angier energetically YANKS coloured handkerchiefs from a hat and TOSSING them into the air. Olivia, in the glamorous, revealing costume of Magician's Assistant, darts back and forth PLUCKING the handkerchiefs from the air. \nAngier finishes with a flourish. Merrit shrugs. Angier places an ORNATE CAGE onto the table. \nANGIER I need a volunteer. \nMerrit rolls his eyes. Climbs to his feet. Angier produces a DOVE. Places it in the cage. \nINT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY \nNow Angier is wearing the harness. He places a dove in the cage and picks it up. \nClose on: HOOKS concealed on Angier's palm slip into CATCHES on the bars of the cage. \nCUTTER Hang on, hang on... \nCutter reaches in and slips a NOOSE around the bird's ankle... \nCUTTER (CONT'D) There we go. Now you tell the volunteer to put his hands here... \nCutter pleases his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the cage... \nINT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT \nMerrit places his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the bird cage. Angier's hands are on the sides. Olivia reaches around Merrit to place her hands on the remaining two sides. Merrit looks up at Angier over his glasses. \nMERRIT You'd beat not be intending to hut this animal, Mr.Angier. \nANGIER Of course not. \nAngier raises and lowers their hands in a rythm... \nANGIER (CONT'D) And one, two... THREE! \nThe bird cage, and the dove, VANISH. \nINT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY \nAngier and Cutter have their hands on the bird cage. \nANGIER \n...THREE! \nThe bird cage BREAKS APART, WHIPPING UP ANGIER'S FOREARMS. WHERE SLEEVES WOULD BE, YANKED BY THE HARNESS. Angier smiles. \nANGIER (CONT'D) Bloody marvelous, Cutter. \nCUTTER And the best part... \nCutter reaches to Angier's armpit... pulls up the DOVE, \nHANGING BY ITS ANKLE, ALIVE. \nANGIER Thought you said I had to get my hands dirty. \nCUTTER Someday, perhaps you will. I needed to know that you can. \nINT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY \nMerrit nods, impressed, stepping backwards. Angier REACHES into Merrit's pocket. Removes a dove. \nMERRIT Very nice. Very nice indeed. \nOlivia packs up the props. Cutter approaches from the wings. \nANGIER \n(SMILING) I haven't had a chance to compliment you on your beautiful theatre yet, Mr.Merrit. \nMERRIT A lot more beautiful when it's full, Mr.Angier. \nANGIER Don't worry. \nMERRIT You all say that. Why sould I worry? If your tricks don't get 'em in, someone else's will. Maybe someone willing to do a bullet catch or a water scape. \nCUTTER cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People hoping for an accident- and quite likely to see one, too. What would that do for your business? \nMERRIT \n(SHRUGS) You've got a week. \nEXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING \nA line a PATRONS runs from the box office to the street. The marquee above the theatre reads: \"THE GREAT DANTON PERFOMS \nFEATS OF MISTERY AND IMAGINATION\" \nINT. THEATRE -- EVENING \nAngier is perfoming to a good crowd. He steps forward. \nANGIER You sir, in the hat. Could you show us your handkerchief? \nA MAN in the audience STANDS and pulls a HANDKERCHIEF from his pocket. He stares at it, CONFUSED. The audience LAUGHS. \nMAN This isn't mine. \nANGIER Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the other man. He has yours. \nAnother man stands and pulls out a handkerchief. APPLAUSE. Angier dows and walks quickly off the stage, past the squad of DANCING GIRLS who run on to entertain in the break. \nINT. BACKSTAGE -- EVENING \n(SHAKES HEAD) It's not that simple. This is a complex illusion. \nCUTTER You think that because you don't know the method. It's a double who comes out at the end. It's the only way. \nANGIER I've seen his perfom ir three times now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the \nSAME MAN- \nCUTTER \nIT'S NOT- \nANGIER The same man comes out of the second cabinet. I promise you. \nOLIVIA It is the same man. They both turn to look at Olivia. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers, but if you look closely you can tell. Angier looks at Cutter. \nANGIER He doesn't know how to sell his trick to an audience. But I do. \nCUTTER \n(NODS) It would give us our climax. \nANGIER The man stole my life. I'm going to steal his trick. \nCUTTER We'll have to find someone who can look like you on a stage. \nANGIER He doesn't use a double- \nCUTTER \n(IMPACIENT) I don't know how Borden does it, Robert. So either you wait for Borden to retire and buy his secret, or you can listen to how I would do this trick. \n(ANGIER NODS) Ang the only way I know is to find you a bloody good double. \nAngier smiles. Turns to Olivia, pointing to his face. \nANGIER Take a good look- let's get out there and find me. \nEXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING \nAngier, swinging his cane, walks slowly up the mountain road. \nEXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS \nThe lab is illuminated by thirty fot STREAMERS of electrical DISCHARGE that pour from the base of the tower. \nAngier stops, fearful. \nALLEY It's perfectly safe. \nAs Angier stares, a MAN begins to emerge from the very center of the CONFLAGRATION. \nBolts SNAP and TRAIL after the man as he walks, in SILHOUETTE, towards Angier. \nTESLA So this is the Great Danton. \nTesla emerges from the ball of electricity, dressed as if he were on his way to the opera. He brushes SPARKS from the sleeve of his jacket as he extends a band to Angier. \nTESLA (CONT'D) Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions. Something you did with pockets? \nAngier returns the handshake. \nANGIER I saw a lecture you gave in London, several years ago. I'm flattered you agreed to see me. Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand. \nAngier, confused, does so. Alley hands him a lightbulb, which starts to glow as he grasps its metal base. \nANGIER (CONT'D) What's conducting the electricity? \nTESLA Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite capable of conducting, and indeed, producing energy. \nTesla release Angier's hand. The bulb goes out. Alley takes it from the Angier who looks at the palms of his hands. \nTESLA (CONT'D) Have you eaten, Mr. Angier? \nEXT. DECK, LABORATORY -- MORNING \nAngier, Alley and Tesla are seated around a table on a decl overlooking a spectacular view. They are eating sandwiches. \nTESLA Alley has explained that you require a very interesting device. \nANGIER I need something impossible. \nTESLA You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's reach exceeds his grasp'? \n(MORE) \nTESLA (CONT'D) (off his look) It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his nerve. The only limits on scientific progress are these imposed by society. Tesla looks out at the mountains. \nTESLA (CONT'D) The first time I changed the world I was hailed as a visionary. The second time I was asked politely to retire. The world only tolerates one change at a time. And so here I am. (gestures at laboratory) Enjoying \"retirement\". (looking at Angier) Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive. Tesla rises, washing his hands in a basin on a side table. \nTESLA (CONT'D) Alley says you are a stage magician. If a built you this device, you would be presenting it only as an illusion? \nANGIER If people thought the things I did on stage were real, they wouldn't clap- they'd scream. Think of saving a woman in half. Tesla nods. Considering. \nTESLA Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine- \nANGIER Price is not an object. \nTESLA Perhaps not. But have you considered the cost? \nANGIER I'm noit sure I follow. \nTESLA I can make your machine, Mr. Angier. But I can also give you some advice... \n(POINTED) Go home. Forget this thing. I can recognize an obsession. As Mr. Alley could tell you, I myself an given to one now and then. It will not do you any good. \nOlivia looks at him strangely. \nOLIVIA You went and saw his show again? \nAngier looks away, embarrassed. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) You becoming obsessed, Robert. \nCUTTER (O.S.) Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Robert. \nAngier and Olivia look up to see Cutter at the trap door. \nINT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- MOMENTS LATER \nAngier and Olivia sit in the front row. Cutter beckons Root onstage. He's been clened up and dressed in Angier's stage costume. he TRIPS on his way across the stage. \nANGIER All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk all the time and no one will be able to tell the difference. \nCUTTER A little faith, sir. Could you favor us with a perfomance. Mr. Root? \nRoot picks himself up and dusts himself off. \nSuddenly, ROOT HAS BECOME ANGIER. he is channeling everything from his facial expressions to his walk. Angier nods, starting to believe this might work. The illusion is PERFECT -- till he opens his mouth. \nROOT You would drink, too, if you know the world half so well as I do. \nAngier hops up onto stage, examining Root from different angles. Root starts APING his every movement. Olivia starts laughing. Angier is getting uncomfortable. \nROOT (CONT'D) Did you think you were unique, Mr. Angier? I have been Cassar. I have been Faust. How difficult could it possibly be to play 'The Great Danton?' \nCUTTER You can go back to being yourself. Root. For free.. Root looks challengingly at both men. \nROOT I'd rather be him, for now. I find it amusing. Root WAVES his hands across his chest, in the same manner that Angier does onstage. He produces a bottle of Gin from thin air, and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia. \nCUTTER Root has to keep a low profile-- anyone sees him the game's up. \nANGIER \n(WATCHING ROOT) I don't know how you do these things, Cutter. I'm not sure I want to know. \nCUTTER Have you thought about what we should call the trick? \nANGIER No point being coy. Borden calls his trick 'The Transported Man'? Cutter nods. \nEXT. LEICESTER SQUARE -- EVENING \nThe enormous MARQUEE of the Empire Theatre: 'The Great Danton perfoms THE NEW TRANSPORTED MAN' Beneath it, a CROWD. Fallon amongest them. STARING up at the sign. \nINT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING \nAngier is onstage, nearing the end of his show, SMILING BROADLY as he pulls dozens of FLOWERS from thin air and tosses them to the crowd. APPLAUSE fills the theatre. \nThe DOORFRAMES are wheeld out on either side of the stage. Angier approaches the edge of the stage to address the audience with a suddenly SOLEMN demeanor. \nANGIER Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight can be termed illusions. Entertaining trifles of the sort you may have seen other magicians perform. \nAngier puts on a TOP HAT. \nANGIER (CONT'D) Alas, I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. Watch carefully- you will see no trickery, for no trickery is being employed. Merely a techique familiar to certain citizens of the orient and various holy men of the Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe... \nAngier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the right-hand door, opens it, SLAPS it to show that is sold. \nThen strolls through crossing the stage- \n-to the other door, which he opens, SLAPPING to show its solidity, then walking trough the frame. \nAngier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air. It sails back down to him and he catches it. \nAngier THROWS the HAT again, even harder this time, and it disappears uo into the rafters. After a beat, it is clear it's not coming back down. \nLAUGHTER. Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped back down to him. He catches it. \nAngier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH ARC across the stage. He OPENS the door- steps behind it... \nThe second DOOR, FAR ACROSS THE STAGE, IMMEDIATELY opens and \nANGIER/ROOT EMERGES, REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT. \nBOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him. He puts on the hat. \nThe AUDIENCE ERUPTS- A STANDING OVATION, Fallon the only one in his seat as Angier/Root takes his BOWS. \nINT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nAngier, hearing the MASSIVE APPLAUSE, climbs off the straw mattress, PEERING up through the cracks in the floorboards. \nSmiling, Angier turns to the unseen audience and BOWS. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING \nAngier, Olivia, and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess. Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table. \nOLIVIA \n(TOAST) To our achivement. They drink. \nCUTTER The manager said he's never seen a reaction like it. Angier smiles, rueful. \nANGIER At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hidden under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears, the man who goes into the box. They care about the man who comes out the other side. \nOLIVIA I care about the man in the box. Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass. \nANGIER Thank you. \n(TO CUTTER) Maybe we could switch before the trick. That way I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below stage. \nCUTTER \nANGIER I don't understand- \nTesla STARES at the hat as if trying to melt it with CONCENTRARION. Alley pulls Angier away from the pit. \nALLEY Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it. We'll see you next week? \nAngier begins to protest but Alley gestures towards the door. \nINT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY \nA small, disused shop off an arcade, crowed with tools, cabinetry and props, windows plastered with playbills. Borden is sitting at a workbench, sleeves rolled up, working a lathe. Fallon enters, Olivia behind him. Borden looks back at her, turns back to the table, instinctively putting on his gloves. \nOLIVIA \n(LOOKING AROUND) Interesting workshop. \nBORDEN We make do. \nOLIVIA My name is Olivia Wenscombe. \nBORDEN I know who you are. Are you here to steal the rest of my show? Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the shop: \"THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING \nNEW TRICK\" \nOLIVIA No. I'm here to give your show what is missing. \nBORDEN And what might that be? \nOLIVIA Me. \nBORDEN \n(TO FALLON) Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard? A woman's touch. Fallon leaves, closing the door. \nOLIVIA I've left Angier. I want a job. Borden sits there. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) I know you have no reason to trust \nME- \nBORDEN Why on earth shouldn't I trust you? The mistress of my enemy. \nOlivia is taken aback. Chanes tack. \nOLIVIA Mr.Borden- \nBORDEN Alfred. \nOLIVIA Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth. \nBORDEN Ah. The truth. A slippery notion in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe. \nOLIVIA I'm here because he sent me here. He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret. \nBORDEN What does he need my secret for? His trick is top notch. The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly reappears on the other side of the stage -- mute, overweight, and, unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk. \nBorden rises, moves closer to Olivia. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage? \nOlivia meets his gaze. \nOLIVIA No. It's killing him. he's obsessed with discovering your method. He thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our sucess. I've had enough. There's no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his. \nBORDEN He has no secrets from me. \nBorden stares at her, unsure. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) And this is the truth? \nShe gives Borden a challenging smile/shrug. \nINT. BACKSTAGE -- DAY \nCutter is fixing a prop mechanism. Angier approaches, in his undershirt, looks over his shoulder. Cutter glances up. \nCUTTER Best be getting changed for the martinee, sir. - Angier nods. Cutter REALIZES. \nCUTTER (CONT'D) ROOT! You're late. \n(SNIFFS) And even more drunk than usual. Get yourself below stairs, right away! \nROOT No. \nCUTTER No?! Root looks at Cutter with genuine malice. \nROOT We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM -- DAY \nAngier is applying his makeup. Cutter enters. Angier looks at him through the mirror. \nANGIER We have a problem, Cutter. He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement: \nPANTAGES THEATRE- FROM NEXT WEEK- THE PROFESSOR WILL \nDEMONSTRATE THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED MAN- ACCEPT NO CHEAP \nIMITATIONS!!! \nANGIER (CONT'D) He'll be perfoming right across the street. \nCUTTER We have a bigger problem. Root. \nANGIER Don't tell me he fell over again. \nCUTTER Worse. He realized he can make demands. \nAngier takes his time, confident, MILKING IT. He throws his HAT into the air, catches it. \nINT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nAngier DROPS ten feet to the concrete floor. But there is NOTHING to break his fall- \nHe SMASHES painfully to the ground. CLUTCHING his leg in AGONY, he looks up and sees SOMEONE standing on the lift twenty feet away... BORDEN. \nINT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nThe first door slams shut. The audience turns their attention to second door. \nThe door remains closed. The HAT falls gently to the floor. SILENCE, broken by a COUGH in the audience. \nINT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nBORDEN bows to Angier- the LIFT ROCKETS BORDEN UP THROUGH \nTHE STAGE FLOOR. \nINT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nThe second door OPENS, and BORDEN steps through, looking all around, CONFUSED, as if he doesn't know where he is. He looks back at the door, then picks up the HAT... \nINT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nAngier looks at his leg- a nasty COMPOUND FRACTURE. As he chokes on pain he can hear LAUGHTER from the AUDIENCE. \nINT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS \nAs Borden mugs with the hat, trying it on and finding it too small, something is LOWERED from the flies above: \nANGIER/ROOT, BOUND AND GAGGED, HANGS from a chain. A sign around his neck reads: \"OPENING AT PANTAGE- THE PROFESSOR\" \nBorden looks up behind him. \nBORDEN Great Danton, I must apologize! I simply had too much magic for my stage at the Pantages! \nThe Great Danton comes to rest three feet above the stage. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Pardon my intrusion! \nBorden places the top hat and ANGIER/ROOT at a JAUNTY ANGLE. \nTHUNDEROUS APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER. Borden BOWS, hops down off the stage, and walks up the aisle, bowing, enjoying it all the way. \nINT. STAGE -- LATER \nCutter crouches over Angier, fixing a LONG SPLINT to his broken leg. Behind them, Root still hangs above the stage, groaning in protest. \nCUTTER I don't see how Borden found him- I had him under wraps, I was careful. \nANGIER Well, he did. \nCutter helps Angier to his feet. \nCUTTER Sit, do you think it might be her? Olivia? \nAngier stops to look at Cutter. \nANGIER No. I don't. \nCutter gestures at Root. \nCUTTER Shall we cut him down? \nANGIER He's the Great Danton. Let him cut himself down. \nEXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT \nAngier, thinly disguised, leg in long metal brace, pushes through the crowd outside the box office. The marquee: The Professor Performs His Masterpiece- THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED \nMAN!! \nOn the box office: SOLD OUT THRU SUNDAY. Angier STARES. \nSCALPER (O.S.) Need tickets, sir? \nAngier turns to the SCALPER. Nods. \nINT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING \nAngier slumps into a seat at the back of the PACKED theatre. \nONSTAGE: Borden works through his show with a SUPERIOR DEGREE OF SHOWMANSHIP, even cracking a smile when called for. Working WITHOUT GLOVES, he makes much of performing tricks ONE-HANDED. He is assisted by Olivia, who looks STUNNING. \nBorden performs ths Transported Man. Borden HAS DRESSED IT UP WITH ELECTRICAL APPARATUS. Two large glass balls transmit SPARKS between one cabinet and the other along BARE WIRES. \nAnother watches, anger rising as he watches Olivia's close RAPPORT with Borden. \nINT. APARTAMENT -- EVENING \nOlivia enters in to the darkness bedroom. She strikes a match and lights one of the gaslights... \n...and SCREAMS as the gaslight illuminates Angier, sitting in an armchair, cane leaning against the arm of the chair. \nANGIER You weren't expecting me? \nOLIVIA I was expecting you sooner, Robbie. Your message said \"afternoon\". \nANGIER Well, it takes a bit for me to get around these days... \nAngier RAPS his leg brace with his cane. HOISTS himself up. \nANGIER (CONT'D) He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career... now you. \nOLIVIA What do you mean? You sent me to- \nANGIER Then I know how hard this had been hard for you. \nINT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY \nCLOSE ON: SHATTERED GLASS, BROKEN PROPS AND CABINETRY. Borden and Fallon survey the WRECKAGE of their shop. Borden looks at Fallon. \nBORDEN Notebook. Fallon nods. Borden sighs. Weary. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Then he's just getting started. \nEXT. STAGEDOOR, PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING \nA small CROWD of autograph SEEKERS crowd the stagedoor. A BODYGUARD steps through the door and begins unshering them away as Fallon and Borden follow him through the door. The bodyguard hold the door to a carriage open and Fallon steps up. Borden stops at the door. \nBORDEN I'm walking tonight, gentlemen. Fallon looks concerned. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Let him come. I don't care. Borden doffs his hat and walks onto the crowd street. Fallon steps down, reaches into the bodyguard's jacket and pulls out a PISTOL. He checks that it's loaded and slips it into his own jacket. Then he sets off after Borden. \nEXT. STREETS, WEST END -- EVENING \nFallon continues to follow Borden at a distance. Borden steps into a tobacconist's. Fallon stops and idles at the street corner. As Fallon watches, acrooss the street, another man STOPS. Fallon slips back around the corner and looks: \nIt's Angier, leaning on his cane. \nBorden emerges from the tobacconist and continues down the street, a cloud of pipe smoke drifting after him. \nFallon waits for Angier to set off after Borden, then follows both men from a distance. \nBorden crosses to the same side of the street as Angier. Fallon picks up his pace and tries to cross the street but is HELD UP for a second by passing traffi. \nAs he reaches the other side, Borden is gone, but he sees Angier dissappear down and alleyway. \nEXT. ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS \nFallon rounds the cornder and stops. The alleyway is EMPTY. -- he has lost them. Finally, he sees an open, darkned doorway towards the end of the alleyway. \nINT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS \nFallon stops at the doorway, his gloved hand gripping te doorframe. \nAngier stands at the other end of the hallway, watching him. \nFallon takes a step towards him and CRASHES through the rotten floor to the basement below. \nINT. BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS \nFallon drops heavily into an almost-vertical OPEN COFFIN. \nDISORIENTED, Fallon just glimpses CUTTER DROP THE LID INTO PLACE, shutting him in. Cutter starts NAILING it down. \nA GUNSHOT TEARS through the lid of the box. Cutter falls back, but is caught by Angier. \nAngier rolls Cutter off to one side. He is clutching at a BLOODY WOUND on his arm. \nCUTTER I'll live. \n(TO COFFIN) You save me the trouble to making you an air hole! \nAngie picks up the hammer and continues NAILING. \nEXT. HIGHGATE CEMETARY -- MORNING \nBorden picks up his way through the overgrown cemetary. He hears a KNOCKING and turns: \nAngier is behind him, RAPPING on a broken headstone with the head of his cane. \nBORDEN I'm impressed. \nANGIER Why's that? \nBORDEN You're finally getting your hands dirty. This is what a good trick costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice. \nANGIER The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all going to be yours. Unless you give me what I want. \nBORDEN Which is? \nANGIER Your secret. \nBorden tries to gauge Angier's expression. \nBORDEN My secret? \nANGIER Your method for the Transported Man. Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact, he doesn't talk at all. \nBORDEN \n(SHRUGS) You have my notebook. \nANGIER Useless without the keyword. \nAngier pulls a sheaf of writing paper and a pencil stub from his pocket. He offers them to Borden. \nANGIER (CONT'D) Write down your method Mr. Borden. Describe it in full. \nBorden takes the paper and pencil and stares Angier in the eye, gauging him. \nBeat. \nBorden writes a SINGLE WORD on the top page and folds it up. \nANGIER (CONT'D) I want the method not the keyword- I don't even know if the secret is in you notebook. \nBorden looks at Angier with a glint in his eye. \nBORDEN The keyword is the method. \nAngier reaches for the folded paper, which Borden lifts out of reach. \nBORDEN It's my name. \nSARAH Not at home. \nBORDEN I'm not always at home. \nSarah is clearly on the verge of tears. \nSARAH Alfred, why are you being like this? \nBorden, seeing her fistress, softnes. \nBORDEN Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today. I thought I'd lost something very precious to me. \nSARAH What? \nBorden looks at her speechless. Shrugs helplessly. \nSARAH (CONT'D) I see. More secrets. \nBORDEN Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our life. \nSarah brushes away a tear. \nSARAH When you're like this, Alfred, I'm not seeing the real you. You're treating me like your audience. Performing. I can't live with that. \nBorden just sits there. Offering nothing. \nEXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- DAY \nAngier walks up to the hotel. A MOTORCAR is parked in front and TWO MEN are unloading it. One of the men STARES at Angier as he enters the hotel. \nINT. CLIFF HOUSE INN \nAngier walks to the reception desk. \nANGIER I thought I had the place to myself. \nMANAGER Unexpected guests. (looks out the window at the men) Not very polite. A lot of questions. At first I thought they might work for the government. \nANGIER No? \nMANAGER \n(LOWERS VOICE) Worse. They work for Thomas Edison. \nAngier starts out the windo at the men unloading equipment. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- CONTINUOUS \nAngier sits at the desk, deciphering Borden's diary. \nBORDEN (V.O.) Today, a most curious development... \nINT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY \nBorden turns to see Fallon show in Olivia. \nBORDEN (V.O.) His assistent come to us with a proposition... \nThey start to speak as Borden's V.O. continues. \nBORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Obviously Angier has sent her, and told her to admit as much... \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage? \nOlivia meets his gaze. \nOLIVIA No. It's killing him. He's obssessed with discovering your method. he thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our success. I've had enough. There is no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his. \nBORDEN He has no secrets from me. \nBorden stares at her, unsure. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) This is the \"truth\" you spoke of? \nShe gives him a sly smile. \nOLIVIA No. This is what he told me to tell you. Beat. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) The truth is that I loved him. And stood by him. And he sent me to you like he'd send a stagehand to pick up his shirts. (looks him in the eye) I hate him for that. They sit there in silence, appraising each other. \nBORDEN I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theatre. What could you possibly have to offer me? Olivia smiles, moves to Borden, reaching for his gloved hand. Borden flinches, surprised. \nOLIVIA You may know he does his tricks... but you can't understand why no one can see that yours are better. She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his mutiladed hand. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) You hide this. I had to look closely to spot it when you performed the Transported Man. (looks into his eyes) But this makes you unique... it shows the audience that you aren't using a double; You musn't hide it, you must display it proudly... (looks at hand) I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand. \nBORDEN \n(QUIETLY) It does. \nOLIVIA Then let people know. You can be so much more then he is. I can show you how. Borden looks into her eyes. \nBORDEN (V.O.) I think she is telling the truth. \nINT. BEDROOM, BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT \nBorden and Olivia are in bed together. It is raining outside. He watching her get out of bed and moves to the window to smoke a cigarette. \nBORDEN (V.O.) I think we cannot trust her. But I love her. I need her. We need her. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) How could he send you away? He must be blind, deaf and dumb. She smiles quietly at this. \nOLIVIA Robbie's blinded by his jealosy. He'd do anything for you secret. Sending me away was the least of it. Borden considers this. \nBORDEN (V.O.) Trust is not the point- love is the point... who have we ever trusted? To open myself to such a relationship, \nHe stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE, no more than ten feet across. \nTwo IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier. He tries to separate the two animals, and succeeds in grabbing one. The other cat RACES off. \nAngier takes a few steps after it, then FREEZES, staring at- \nTOP HATS. Clustered in a small glads. The first cat slinks its way through them. \nThe SECOND BLACK cat jumps from Angier's hands- RACES into the glade, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the \nWOODS BEYOND- \nAngier is left alone in the clearing, staring at the pile of dozens of IDENTICAL TOP HATS. \nEXT. PORCH, TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY \nThe top hats are in a pile on the dark. Tesla is at the table, measuring two HATS with a pair of Calipers. Angier and Alley are watching. \nANGIER So the machine was working? \nALLEY I never bothered to check the calibration. The hat never moved. \nTESLA These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's one of the principal beauties of science. \nTesla looks carefully at the hat in his hands. It has a tiny TEAR on the inside of the brim. He picks up another hat. It has the same TEAR. \nTESLA (CONT'D) We'll need a couple of weeks to iron \nOUT THE- (looks at hats) -problems with the machine. I'll send word when it's ready. \nAngier, still dazed, takes his cane and heads for the door. \nTESLA (CONT'D) Don't forget your hat. Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats. \nANGIER Which one is mine? \nTESLA They are all your hat, Mr. Angier. Tesla smiles at him. \nINT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY \nBorden's daughter, JESS, now four, runs into the room and tries to hop up into his lap. Laughing, he helps her up. \nJESS Are we going to the zoo this afternoon, daddy? \nBORDEN Daddy's got some business this afternoon. \nJESS But you promised. \nBORDEN Did I? Jess nods at him, solemly. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Then go to the zoo we shall. Borden holds the newspaper open for her to look at. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) (gestures to newspaper) Who's that? A large advertisement features a picture of Borden: The Professor- England's premiere magician! \nJESS That's you, daddy? Borden picks up the girl off of his lap and stands. \nBORDEN Daddy has some errands to run. I'll be back before you know it, so get ready. \nBorden walks to the door. As he does, Sarah enters, avoiding his eyes, then ducking him as he tries to kiss her. \nShe reaches for the sherry decanter. He watches her pour. Sarah looks at him, eyes red from crying. \nSARAH We each have our vices. Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes. \nBORDEN Sarah. Whatever you may think, your only competitions for my affections is my little girl. I love you. I will always love you, and you alone. She looks into his eyes. Fascinated. \nSARAH You mean it today. \nBORDEN Absolutely. \nSARAH That makes it so much harder when you don't. She turns from him. Borden watches her sadly. Leaves. \nEXT. CANAL -- AFTERNOON \nBorden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal that snakes through the poorer neighborhoods of the city. Borden wanders into a tunel. Another man is waiting for him -- Fallon. Fallon hands Borden a folded piece of paper. He studies it. \nBORDEN More shopping. She doesn't like the smell of money, doesn't she? Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) The little lady wants to visit the Zoo, I thought you could take her. I'll do it tomorrow, if not. (looks at his feet) Sarah... she knows. At least, she knows things aren't right. (looks at Fallon, \nPLEADING) Help me with her. Try and convince her that I love her. Please. \nBorden, embarrassed, pats Fallon on the shoulder and makes off down the path. Fallon sets off in the opposite direction. \nINT. OLIVIA'S APARTMENT \nOlivia, barely wearing a dressing gown, answers the door to Borden. She pulls him in, trying to draw him into a kiss, but he backs away. \nOLIVIA What is it. Freddy? \nBORDEN Please don't call me that. It's nothing, just... sometimes things seem... wrong. \nOlivia looks at him. Cold. \nOLIVIA Freddy, I've told you before. When you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong. \nBORDEN I'm trying, Olivia. Please. \nOLIVIA I'll get dressed. \nBorden watches her move down the hall. \nOLIVIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) I saw Fallon hanging around my house again, after you left. \nOlivia comes back in, half-dressed. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) There's something about him I don't trust. \nLIGHT... \nWHITE SCEEN- \nANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D) But here, at the Turn, I must leave you, Borden... \nThe WHITS becomes handwriting an a page and we are- \nINT. PRISON CELL -- DAY \nBorden STARES at Angier's journal in disbelief. \nANGIER Yes, you, Borden. Sitting there, in your cell, reading my diary. Awaiting your death. For my murder. \nBorden SLAMS the journal shut. Staring at it. \nEXT. PRISON CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY \nBORDEN stands at the fence again. \nOWENS Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that you'd reconsidered his offer. \nBORDEN Angier's journal, the \"gesture of good faith\"? It's a fake. \nOWENS \n(SURPRISED) I assure you it's not. \nBORDEN It has to be- it refers to events that happened after his death. \nOWENS Clever predictions, I'm sure. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt. It's written in Angier own hand, of which we have numerous examples. (looks at Borden) What makes you think it's a fake? \nBorden looks away, uncomfortable. \nBORDEN It doesn't matter. \nBorden leans forward and stuffs ROLLED PAPERS through the fence. Owens takes them carefully. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) My tricks. All of them. \nOWENS Including the Transported Man? Lord Caldlow will be very pleased. \nBORDEN No he won't. They're not complete- you only have the Pledge and Turn for each. \nOwens leafs through the papers, annoyed. \nOWENS Without the Prestige for each trick these are wothless. \nBORDEN You'll get the rest after you bring my daughter here. \nOwens looks at Borden. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) I want to say goodbye. \nINT. BORDEN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nJess sits at the foot of the stairs, listening to her parents SHOUT at each other in the living room. She is CRYING. \nBORDEN (O.S.) Stop it! Just stop it! \nSARAH Deny it all you want- I know! \nINT. LIVING ROOM, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nSarah is WILD, eyes red, hair a mess. Utterly DISTRAUGHT Borden is trying to calm her. \nBORDEN Sarah, it's not true! I've told you Olivia means nothing to me! \nSARAH I'll go yo her! I know what you really are, Alfred! \nBORDEN \n(QUIETLY FIRM) Sarah. You can't do that. \nINT. HALLWAY, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nJess looks up. Fallon is standing above her. Listening. \nSARAH (O.S.) I'll do what I have to! \nJess reaches up a hand. Fallon takes it in his. \nBORDEN (O.S.) Sarah, you can't talk like this! \nINT. LIVING ROOM, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nSarah turn to face Borden. Deperate. \nSARAH I can't live like this! \nBORDEN \n(ANGRY) What do you want from me! Sarah pauses.

Said she had something to tell me about you. \n(LOOKS AWAY) I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her.

The part that's sitting here now. I love you. That is the truth that matters. \nOlivia tosses her napkin on her plate. \nOLIVIA You could be sitting in some other restaurant talking to some other woman about me that way. It's unhuman to be so cold. \nBorden watches her rise from the table. She looks at him. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) By the way, have you seen who's opened at the Pantages? (Borden shakes head) The Great Danton. \nBORDEN He's back? \nOLIVIA After two years. And he has a new trick.

Angier watches him go. \nEXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- MORNING \nBorden is at the fence. Fallon is on the other side. \nBORDEN We go alone now- both of us.

We each had half a full life. Enough for us, but not for them. Borden puts the ball in his pocket. Tears in his eyes. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Sacrifice, Robert- that's the price of a good trick. Borden looks down at Angier with contempt. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Angier is dying. He opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is so wak that Borden has to stoop to hear him. \nANGIER \n(VERY QUIET) I've made sacrificies. \nBORDEN It takes nothing to steal someone else's work. \nANGIER It takes everything. \nINT.

This is why no one detectes his method. \nSoo hobbles into the restaurant, frail, and fragile. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Total devotion to his art... (looks at Angier) Utter self-sacrifice. It's the only way to escape this. \nBorden SLAPS the bricks of the wall behind them. \nINT. BEDSIT -- NIGHT \nJulia, in bed, watches Angier, SHEET wrapped around him like a robe, HOBBLING. He pulls up the sheeyt- between his knees is a goldfish bowl. \nANGIER I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water. Or fish. He must be strong as an ox. \nJULIA \n(INCREDULOUS) He's been preteding to be an cripple for years? \nANGIER Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out. It's unthinkable. \nAngier puts the bowl down with a flourish. Climbs into bed. \nANGIER (CONT'D) Borden saw it at once. I couldn't fathom it- living your whole life pretending to be someone else. \nJULIA You're pretending to be someone else. \nANGIER I don't think changing your name compares. \nJULIA Not just your name- who you are, where you're from... \nANGIER I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors.

She FLINCHES against the gun he is holding. \nSARAH (CONT'D) What's this? \nBORDEN The trick to wake up Ackerman at the end of my audition. \nSARAH Your great trick? The \"masterpiece that will make our fortunes\"? \nBORDEN No. The world isn't ready for that one, yet. Borden moves to the bureau and starts LOADING the gun. Pouring in SHOT, then WADDING... \nBORDEN (CONT'D) This is merely a run-of-the-mill daring and spectacular bullet catch- Borden drops the BULLET into the barrel... \nSARAH I'm not letting you get shot. Borden RAMS the bullet and charge down then removes the RAMROD and hands the pistol to Sarah. \nBORDEN It's perfectly safe. Shoot me. Sarah looks at Borden then down at the pistol. She aims at Borden. Then sims off, at a mirror beside him. BANG. Borden's hand SNAPS out to \"catch\" the bullet. The mirror is intact. Borden looks at Sarah, grave, as he reveals the bullet in his hand. \nSARAH Show me. (Borden shakes head) Then you're not doing it. I can't raise a child on my own, Alfred. Borden looks at her.

He takes the RAMROD and PUSHES it down onto the bullet, which disappears. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) \nAND VOILS- He points the ramrod at Sarah- she pulls the bullet out of the HOLLOW TIP. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) The buller's not even in the gun when the charge is fired. \nSarah looks at ramrod with disdain. \nSARAH Once you know it's so obvious. \nBorden BRISTLES slightly. Takes the bullet back. \nBORDEN Yes, well, people still get killed perfoming it. \nSARAH How? \nBORDEN Sme smart-arse drops something down the barrel. \nSARAH Such as? \nBORDEN A penny, or a button.

Not today. \nBORDEN What? \nSARAH \n(SMILES) Some days, it's not true. Todayt you don't mean it. Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me. \n(OFF LOOK) It's alright.

This is TESLA- but Angier is too far from the stage to get a good look at him. \nTESLA With a system like this I could have the entire city electrified whitin two years. \nThe audience breaks into LAUGHTER. The spell is broken. Tesla must be a lunatic. \nTESLA (CONT'D) Mr. Edison's direct current system is flawed and dangerous.

Then quietly \nSAY- \n(WHISPERS) \"are you wacthing closely\"... perhaps say a magic word or two... then I'll be gone. Borden VANISHES the ball, but FUMBLES it, it drops to Borden's feet.

Angier slips the newspaper from the table. \nANGIER You've been sleeping here? \nOLIVIA Cutter said it would be okay till we get another booking. \n(BEAT) What are you doing? \nANGIER Researching. Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions they're- \nOLIVIA You're going to do something to that man, aren't you? Olivia moves closer. Angier is quiet. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) Cutter's hopig you'll let things life. He says if Borden thinks things are even between you then we can- \nANGIER Even? My wife for a couple of his fingers? He has a child now. And he's perfoming again. \n(BITTER) Borden is out there, living his life just as he always intended. As if nothing had happened. And look at me. I'm alone.

The tough crowd is JEERING AT HIM. Borden puts the rings down on a table and PICKS UP a bag. \nBORDEN I need a volunteer. Angier takes a few steps towards the stage. Borden produces a RUBBER BALL. he TOSSES the ball to Angier. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) As you can see , it's just a rubber ball. But it's not normal at all. Angier examines the ball.

He CLOSES it again and crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way. At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the door to the empty cabinet. This time, however, he leaves the door open. He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across the stage... Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door. With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball continues to BOUNCE across the stage. BOUNCE. BOUNCE. BOUNCE. The ball loses seep and height... Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE happens. \nTHE DOOR TO THE SECOND CABINET OPENS AND BORDEN STEPS OUT, \nCATCHING THE BALL. Cutter FLINCHES, then studies Borden.

His rolling EYES fixed on Borden, he POUNDS desperetely on the thick glass, SCREAMING \nBUBBLES... \nBorden, HORROFIED, tries forcing the lif ot the tank open. It's sealed shut. He leaves the tank and begins searching around under the stage. He finds a SPANNER. \nBorden SMASHES again and again at the glass of the tank, which spiders, then CRACKS, and finally GIVES WAY. \nWATER bursts from the tank, sweeping Angier's body into Borden, and both of them onto gournd. Above them we can hear YELLING. Borden rolls Angier onto his side and POUNDS on his back. Water and blood OOZE from the man's lungs. His eyes are dilated and lifeless: \nANGIER IS DEAD. \nBorden is frozen, unable to move. \nCutter appears behind him, SHOCKED by what he sees. Borden turns to look at him, his eyes wild with confusion. \nCUTTER What did you do? \nINT. MORQUE -- EVENING \nA MORTICIAN pulls back a sheet draped over a CORPSE. \nAngier's lifeless eyes stare up at us. Cutter looks at Angier, the up at the Mortician. Nods. \nJUDGE (V.O.)

EVIDENCE ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nA POLICEMAN shows Owens into the room, walking him past all of the equipment to the far end where Cutter stands staring at the MACHINE'S CRATE. \nOWENS Mr.Cutter? \n(CUTTER TURNS) Owens. \nThey shake hands. \nCUTTER Thank you for coming, Mr.Owens. It's fallen to me to dispose of Mr.Angier's equipment. Looking at the manifest, it's cleat that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items. \nOWENS Mr.Cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver the items you surely could have just- \nCUTTER It's not just that, Mr.Owens. There is a particular item (turns to crate) This time, in fact, that I wish to... well, that is to say, I want to- \nOWENS You wnat to buy it instead. \nCUTTER I suppose so, yes. \nOwens moves closer to the crate. Sees the COLORADO SPRINGS stencil. \nOWENS This is the machine? \n(OFF LOOK) I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about procuring this particular item. \nCUTTER Perhaps if I dould talk to Lord Caldlow in person. \nOWENS Out of the question, I'm afraid. \nCutter nods. Owens starts to walk away. Turns. \nOWENS (CONT'D) of course, I suppose... if, in the course of your delivery arrangements your paths were to cross... I can't stop you from speaking your mind. \nCutter nods. \nINT.

He catches a glimpse of this daughter waling beside a man on the wooden section. \nAs Borden reaches the fence he CROUCHES to greet his little girl, forcing the Sullen and the other Warder to crouch to undo his chains. \nBORDEN Jess, how are you? \nJess SMILES at him and reaches through the fence. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Are you alright? \nShe nods. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) I've missed you. Fallon's missed you. We both have. \nBorden drinks in her gace, her hair. She grasps the fence. \nJESS Can I come in there, Daddy? \nBORDEN Everything's going to be okay. It is only then that he notices the HAND ON HER SHOULDER. He rises to come face-to-face with Lord Caldlow- \nBORDEN (CONT'D) You must be Lord- -who is ROBERT ANGIER. Risen from the dead. \nANGIER \n(ENGLISH ACCENT) Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been. Borden STARES at Angier. \nBORDEN I saw you die. Angier just SMILES. \nANGIER They flatter you with all those chains, Alfred. Don't they know you can't escape without your little rubber ball? Borden says nothing. \nANGIER (CONT'D) All I wanted to do was prove that I was the better magician. But you couldn't leave me alone. \nBORDEN You were always afraid to get your hands dirty... (looks down at his \nJESS) Not anymore. \nANGIER No. Not anymore. And I win. Because no one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears. \nBORDEN You win. But don't take my little girl...

You paid for it. \nANGIER Your secret. \nBorden nods. Angier steps up, takes the envelope. \nANGIER (CONT'D) You always were the better magician, Borden. We both know that. HE TEARS the envelope in half. Then again. And again... \nANGIER (CONT'D) But whatever your secret was, you'll have to agree- \nHe tosses the peices on the ground. \nANGIER (CONT'D) \n(VICTORIOUS) -mine is better. \nAngier TURNS. \nBORDEN Angier! Let me say good-bye. Please. \nAngier stops. Lets Jess come to fence. She is crying. \nJESS When are you taking me home, Daddy? \nBORDEN Soon. I promise. Soon. \nANGIER For God's sake, Borden. \nBORDEN Daddy's coming, I promise. I promise. \nHERE- \nBorden PRODUCES his RUBBER BALL. Jess looks at it. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) I promise. \nBorden VANISHES the rubber ball. ANgier pulls Jess back from the fence and starts walking away. Borden rises. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) You think this place can hold me, Angier? \nAngier continues walking Jess away. Shaking this head. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Angier! \nBorden is alone.

{"test1_input": "MILTON Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman... \nMilton GESTURES to Julia- the MEN in the crowd go wild- hands in the air, catcalls. Smiling radiantly, Julia selects two young men, who SCRAMBLE up to the stage- ANGIER and BORDEN: younger, full of energy- Angier has no limp. \nThey spring onto stage, beside Julia and take the ROPE she offers them. Milton GRABS a HOOK that descends from the flies on a chain. \nCutter is watching fron the wings. \nMILTON (CONT'D) Are either of you two gentlemen gailors? \nBoth shakes their hands as they start to bind Julia with the ropes, Borden wrapping the rope around her wrists, Angier the one around her ankles. \nMILTON (CONT'D) Well, I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot... \nAs Borden finishes his knot tests it, it SLIPS APART. Borden frowns, hastly RETYING it, covering. \nCutter NOTICES. \nBorden finishes, glancing at julia who gives a small sign of assent with her eyes. As Angier finishes tying her ankles he sneaks a light KISS on her ankle. She frowns at him and raises her arms. Milton hooks the rope onto the chain. \nMilton gesticulates in the wings, Cutter signals to a stagehand who starts HOISTING Julia into the air. \nMilton wheels the tank under Julia's bare feet. Cutter feels for the handle of an AXE placed by his feet and pulls out a \nSTOPWATCH. JULIA looks down at Angier. They smile at each other. Julia DROPS into the tank with a massive splash- Milton SLAMS the lid shut, PADLOCKS it and raises a curtain around the tank... \nCutter checks his stopwatch, grips the handle of the axe... \nA grand GESTURE from Milton- the curtain around the tank DROPS- Julia is GONE. Milton raises the curtain again, then with another flourish, DROPS it to reveal JULIA, beside the tank, one arm in the air, dripping wet, smiling. \nThe audience erupts in APPLAUSE. Angier smiles produly. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT \nAngier, Borden and Julia sit around the cluttered room. Borden is in the middle of a passionate rant- \nBORDEN Milton's squadering their goodwill or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks- \nANGIER \n(AMUSED) Old favourites, please. \nBORDEN What about something fresh? He won't even try a bullet catch- \nCUTTER (O.S.) Bullet catch is suicide. \nThey turn. Cutter stands in the doorway, counting out money. \nCUTTER (O.S.) (CONT'D) All it takes is a smart-arse volunteer dropping a button down the barrel... \nBORDEN \n(INDICATES HIMSELF \nAND ANGIER) \nUSE PLANTS- \nANGIER He can't use plants for every trick. \nJULIA There'd be no seats left for the punters. \nBORDEN Fine- no bullet catch. But a real magician tries to invent something new, something other magicians scratch their heads over- \nCUTTER They sells it to them for a small fortune. \nCutter hands Angier some money. \nCUTTER (CONT'D) I suposse you have such a trick, Mr.Borden? \nANGIER Actually, I do. \nCUTTER Care to sell it? \nBORDEN No one else could do my trick. \nANGIER I could. \nBORDEN You don't even know what it is. \nANGIER Show it to me twice, I'll do it. \nCutter looks at Borden, thoughtful. \nCUTTER I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier. But if Borden here really has invented his masterpiece it might well be something only he can do. \nANGIER Why? \nCUTTER It might be something only he is prepared to do. (gestures to the props) my illusions employer, Mr.Milton, is a skilled showman. But Borden's right- he won't get his hands dirty. You want to see what it takes to make real magic- go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there who's got what it takes. \nANGIER Chung Ling Soo. \nBORDEN Tickets are pricey. \nCUTTER I know a lad on the door. You two watch his show- whoever tells me how he does his goldfish bowl trick gets the prize. \nANGIER Which is? \nCutter gives a sly smile. \nCUTTER Ten minutes onstage in front of my old friend, Mr.Ackerman. \nAngier and Borden prick up at the name. \nJULIA Who's Ackerman? \nBORDEN The most powerful theatrical agent in London. \n", "test1_true": "CUTTER I saw you drop the knot again, Borden. \nJULIA I think I had my wrist turned- \nCUTTER \n(IGNORING JULIA) Some nights you just can't get it, can you? If that knot slips when Julia's on the hoist she'll break a leg. \nBORDEN \n(DEFENSIVE) It's the wrong knot. A Langford double would hold tighter. \nCUTTER The Langford double's not a wet knot it's too dangerous. The ropes could swell and she'd never slip it- \nJULIA I can slip a Lanford underwater. \nBORDEN We've been practiced it- \nANGIER \n(CUTTING IN) He said no. \nJulia glances at Angier. \nCUTTER \n(TO BORDEN) No more mistakes. \nBorden stares at Cutter. Leaves. Angier watches him go. \nANGIER Where's he from? \nCUTTER Where are you from? \nAngier nods. Fair enough. \nCUTTER (CONT'D) He shuffles props for Virgil at the Hall. \nANGIER He works for another magician? Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks? \nCUTTER \n(SHAKES HEAD) He doesn't deal in methods. \nANGIER How do you know? \nCUTTER \n(SLY SMILE) Because I hired him to try and find out Virgil's orange trick. \nANGIER I don't know if I trust him. \nCUTTER He's a natural magician. Of course you can't trust him. \nJULIA I think he's alright. Angier turns to Julia. Smiles. \nANGIER You think everyone's alright. \nJULIA Even you. Julia kisses Angier. Cutter rises. \nCUTTER And Mr.Angier...? (Angier looks up) Learn your aight lines- if I can see you sneaking a peck on your wife's ankle from the wings, the blokes on each end of rows 3 and 4 can, too. \nINT. THEATRE, CONVENT GARDEN -- EVENING \nBorden watches from the wings. Onstage, a magician, Virgil, locks a CANARY into a cage then covers the cage with a SHAWL. Borden notices a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in the front row with a little BOY who is watching Virgil's act, spellbound. Virgil SLAMS the SHAWL down onto the table, as if nothing were beneath it, then WHIPS it away- BIRD and CAGE are gone. The little BOY begins to WAIL and CRY. Borden watches as the young woman tries to make him stop. Virgil takes the flower from his lapel, covers it with the shawl, and SNAPS it away- the flower has become the CANARY. The audience bursts into enthusiastic APPLAUSE, but the little boy is still CRYING INCONSOLABLY. Virgil takes bows and walks off, handing Borden the canary as he passes backstage. As the audience leaves, Borden climbs off the stage and hols the bird in front of the boy. \nBORDEN Look- he's all right. He's fine. \nBOY \n(SNIFFS) But where's his brother? Borden is at a loss. He turns to the young woman. \nBORDEN Sharp lad, your son. \nYOUNG WOMAN \n(LAUGHS) My brother. Borden smiles back. \nINT. WORKSHOP -- LATER \nBorden gently strokes the bird's feathered head. \nBORDEN You're the lucky one tonight. Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages -- each one with an identical canary. He puts the bird into its cage and returns to the cart props. He taps on the top of the TABLE- a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE. Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart. A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below. Borden SLAPS the cage. And the FLATTENED CARCASS of the ORIGINAL BIRD slides out and SPLASHES into the bucket. \nEXT. STAGE DOOR -- EVENING \nBorden exits. The young woman, SARAH, is there with her brother. \nBORDEN (to the brother) Are you watching closely? Borden reaches to the Boy's ear. Casually produces a coin. The Boy marvels as he takes the coin then looks at Borden. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Look closer. \nBOY It's got two heads. Sarah smiles. Borden crouches to address the Boy, grave. \nBORDEN Never. Show. Anyone. \nThe Boy looks at him, a little afraid. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret- but as soon as you give it up you'll be nothing to them. Understand? Nothing. The secret impresses no one- the trick you use it for is everything. \nBorden looks into the boy's staring eyes. Then SMILES and pets him on the head. he stands. Sarah smiles at him. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Where do you two live? \nSARAH He lives with Mum. \nBORDEN And you? \n", "test1_id": 3210, "test2_input": "BORDEN It's my name. \nSARAH Not at home. \nBORDEN I'm not always at home. \nSarah is clearly on the verge of tears. \nSARAH Alfred, why are you being like this? \nBorden, seeing her fistress, softnes. \nBORDEN Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today. I thought I'd lost something very precious to me. \nSARAH What? \nBorden looks at her speechless. Shrugs helplessly. \nSARAH (CONT'D) I see. More secrets. \nBORDEN Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our life. \nSarah brushes away a tear. \nSARAH When you're like this, Alfred, I'm not seeing the real you. You're treating me like your audience. Performing. I can't live with that. \nBorden just sits there. Offering nothing. \nEXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- DAY \nAngier walks up to the hotel. A MOTORCAR is parked in front and TWO MEN are unloading it. One of the men STARES at Angier as he enters the hotel. \nINT. CLIFF HOUSE INN \nAngier walks to the reception desk. \nANGIER I thought I had the place to myself. \nMANAGER Unexpected guests. (looks out the window at the men) Not very polite. A lot of questions. At first I thought they might work for the government. \nANGIER No? \nMANAGER \n(LOWERS VOICE) Worse. They work for Thomas Edison. \nAngier starts out the windo at the men unloading equipment. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- CONTINUOUS \nAngier sits at the desk, deciphering Borden's diary. \nBORDEN (V.O.) Today, a most curious development... \nINT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY \nBorden turns to see Fallon show in Olivia. \nBORDEN (V.O.) His assistent come to us with a proposition... \nThey start to speak as Borden's V.O. continues. \nBORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Obviously Angier has sent her, and told her to admit as much... \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage? \nOlivia meets his gaze. \nOLIVIA No. It's killing him. He's obssessed with discovering your method. he thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our success. I've had enough. There is no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his. \nBORDEN He has no secrets from me. \nBorden stares at her, unsure. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) This is the \"truth\" you spoke of? \nShe gives him a sly smile. \nOLIVIA No. This is what he told me to tell you. Beat. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) The truth is that I loved him. And stood by him. And he sent me to you like he'd send a stagehand to pick up his shirts. (looks him in the eye) I hate him for that. They sit there in silence, appraising each other. \nBORDEN I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theatre. What could you possibly have to offer me? Olivia smiles, moves to Borden, reaching for his gloved hand. Borden flinches, surprised. \nOLIVIA You may know he does his tricks... but you can't understand why no one can see that yours are better. She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his mutiladed hand. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) You hide this. I had to look closely to spot it when you performed the Transported Man. (looks into his eyes) But this makes you unique... it shows the audience that you aren't using a double; You musn't hide it, you must display it proudly... (looks at hand) I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand. \nBORDEN \n(QUIETLY) It does. \nOLIVIA Then let people know. You can be so much more then he is. I can show you how. Borden looks into her eyes. \nBORDEN (V.O.) I think she is telling the truth. \nINT. BEDROOM, BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT \nBorden and Olivia are in bed together. It is raining outside. He watching her get out of bed and moves to the window to smoke a cigarette. \nBORDEN (V.O.) I think we cannot trust her. But I love her. I need her. We need her. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) How could he send you away? He must be blind, deaf and dumb. She smiles quietly at this. \nOLIVIA Robbie's blinded by his jealosy. He'd do anything for you secret. Sending me away was the least of it. Borden considers this. \nBORDEN (V.O.) Trust is not the point- love is the point... who have we ever trusted? To open myself to such a relationship, \n", "test2_true": "Olivia makes her way past crowed MARKET STALLS. \nBORDEN (V.O.) ...to the dangers of such an affair... I need assurances of fidelity. Of love. Fallon is SHADOWING her from a distance. \nBORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) But how to be sure when truth is layered like the skin of an onion? I know a way... she must help me rid ourselves of Angier. It is the only way to kow her mind. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY \nAngier looks up from Borden's diary. Pale. He flips pages and pages forward TO THE LAST ENTRY... \nBORDEN (V.O.) Today my mistress proves her truthfulness. Not to me, you understand. \nBORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) I have been convinced since she led me to Root... today, Olivia proves her love for me to you, Angier. \nAngier looks up from the notebook. Mind reeling. \nBORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Yes, Angier. She gave you this noteboook at my request. Yes, she led me to Root, and yes, Tesla is merely the key to my dairy, not to my trick. Did you really think I would part with my secret so easily after so much? Good-bye, Angier, may you find solace for your thwarted ambition back in yout American home. \nAngier STARES at the pages, unblinking. JUMPS to his feet... \nINT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY \nAngier STRIDES up to the fence. \nANGIER \nTESLA! \n(NOTHING) \nTESLA!! \nAngier takes his cane and starts running its METAL TIP across the eletrified fence- causing SPARKING and CRACKLING. \nANGIER (CONT'D) \nALLEY, GET OUT HERE AND LET ME IN!! \nAlley emerges from the building, consufed. \nINT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY \nAlley opens the door- Angier BURSTS IN past him, ENRAGED. \nANGIER I've veen played for a fool! \nALLEY Who by? \nANGIER Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for. \nALLEY We never said he had. \nANGIER You let me believe that he had, Alley! \n(MORE) \nANGIER (CONT'D) You stole my money because your funding was cut off- you've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along while you use my money to stave off ruin. I've seen Edison's men- \nALLEY Where? \nANGIER In the hotel. I've every mind to bring them up here myself- \nTESLA That would be unwise, Mr.Angier. \nTesla is holding a cage containing a large tabby CAT. \nTESLA (CONT'D) It is true, sir, that you are your one remaining financier. But we have not stolen your money... \nALLEY Sir, my cat? \nTesla silences Alley with a tiny GLANCE. \nALLEY (CONT'D) When I told you I could make your machine I spoke the simple truth. Science is just a name for the art of rendering the exotic mundane. It has no boundaries- its very purpose is to destroy boundaries. \nANGIER Then why isn't the machine working? \nTesla gives Angier the slightest of smiles. \nTESLA Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is not an exact science. The machine simply does not operate as expected. It needs continued examination. \nANGIER Where did my top hat go? \nALLEY Nowhere. \nAlley points to the top hat, which is sitting on a workbench. \nALLEY (CONT'D) We've tried the damn thing a dozen times. And the hat went nowhere. \nTESLA Which is why we need to rey a different material. It may provoke a different result. Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley. \nTESLA (CONT'D) You don't expect me to handle the thing myself? Alley reluctantly reaches into the cage and pulls out the TERRIFIED CAT. He jumps down into the pit and secures the animal bu its collar to a eye-hook sunk into the ground. \nALLEY You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, Doctor. Alley pulls himself out of the pit, and Tesla CHARGES the generator. The cat stares up at the machine around it and HISSES. Without ceremony, Tesla FIRES the machine. As before, large BOLTS spew from the head of the machine, down towards the unseen cat. The machine build to a DEAFENING ROAR, then sputters out. Silence. The three men begin edging towards the pit. Suddenly, a terrifying SCREECH. The cat is still there, still tied to the hook. Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car. Tesla looks frustated. Suddenly, the cat bursts free of Alley and ROCJETS through the open side door of the lab. \nANGIER I'll go. Angier limps after the cat. \nEXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS \nAngier sees the cat disappearing along the edge of the building and into the forest beyond. Angier follows. \nEXT. FOREST -- CONTINUOUS \nAngier pushes his way through the dense undergrowth, trying to keep up, but the cat has disappeared. \nANGIER Here, kitty, kitty. \nSuddenly, a HORRIBLE SCREECHING reaches Angier. He begins to follow the noise. \n", "test2_id": 3211, "test3_input": "He stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE, no more than ten feet across. \nTwo IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier. He tries to separate the two animals, and succeeds in grabbing one. The other cat RACES off. \nAngier takes a few steps after it, then FREEZES, staring at- \nTOP HATS. Clustered in a small glads. The first cat slinks its way through them. \nThe SECOND BLACK cat jumps from Angier's hands- RACES into the glade, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the \nWOODS BEYOND- \nAngier is left alone in the clearing, staring at the pile of dozens of IDENTICAL TOP HATS. \nEXT. PORCH, TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY \nThe top hats are in a pile on the dark. Tesla is at the table, measuring two HATS with a pair of Calipers. Angier and Alley are watching. \nANGIER So the machine was working? \nALLEY I never bothered to check the calibration. The hat never moved. \nTESLA These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's one of the principal beauties of science. \nTesla looks carefully at the hat in his hands. It has a tiny TEAR on the inside of the brim. He picks up another hat. It has the same TEAR. \nTESLA (CONT'D) We'll need a couple of weeks to iron \nOUT THE- (looks at hats) -problems with the machine. I'll send word when it's ready. \nAngier, still dazed, takes his cane and heads for the door. \nTESLA (CONT'D) Don't forget your hat. Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats. \nANGIER Which one is mine? \nTESLA They are all your hat, Mr. Angier. Tesla smiles at him. \nINT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY \nBorden's daughter, JESS, now four, runs into the room and tries to hop up into his lap. Laughing, he helps her up. \nJESS Are we going to the zoo this afternoon, daddy? \nBORDEN Daddy's got some business this afternoon. \nJESS But you promised. \nBORDEN Did I? Jess nods at him, solemly. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) Then go to the zoo we shall. Borden holds the newspaper open for her to look at. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) (gestures to newspaper) Who's that? A large advertisement features a picture of Borden: The Professor- England's premiere magician! \nJESS That's you, daddy? Borden picks up the girl off of his lap and stands. \nBORDEN Daddy has some errands to run. I'll be back before you know it, so get ready. \nBorden walks to the door. As he does, Sarah enters, avoiding his eyes, then ducking him as he tries to kiss her. \nShe reaches for the sherry decanter. He watches her pour. Sarah looks at him, eyes red from crying. \nSARAH We each have our vices. Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes. \nBORDEN Sarah. Whatever you may think, your only competitions for my affections is my little girl. I love you. I will always love you, and you alone. She looks into his eyes. Fascinated. \nSARAH You mean it today. \nBORDEN Absolutely. \nSARAH That makes it so much harder when you don't. She turns from him. Borden watches her sadly. Leaves. \nEXT. CANAL -- AFTERNOON \nBorden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal that snakes through the poorer neighborhoods of the city. Borden wanders into a tunel. Another man is waiting for him -- Fallon. Fallon hands Borden a folded piece of paper. He studies it. \nBORDEN More shopping. She doesn't like the smell of money, doesn't she? Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper. \nBORDEN (CONT'D) The little lady wants to visit the Zoo, I thought you could take her. I'll do it tomorrow, if not. (looks at his feet) Sarah... she knows. At least, she knows things aren't right. (looks at Fallon, \nPLEADING) Help me with her. Try and convince her that I love her. Please. \nBorden, embarrassed, pats Fallon on the shoulder and makes off down the path. Fallon sets off in the opposite direction. \nINT. OLIVIA'S APARTMENT \nOlivia, barely wearing a dressing gown, answers the door to Borden. She pulls him in, trying to draw him into a kiss, but he backs away. \nOLIVIA What is it. Freddy? \nBORDEN Please don't call me that. It's nothing, just... sometimes things seem... wrong. \nOlivia looks at him. Cold. \nOLIVIA Freddy, I've told you before. When you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong. \nBORDEN I'm trying, Olivia. Please. \nOLIVIA I'll get dressed. \nBorden watches her move down the hall. \nOLIVIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) I saw Fallon hanging around my house again, after you left. \nOlivia comes back in, half-dressed. \nOLIVIA (CONT'D) There's something about him I don't trust. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING \nAngier walks out from the lobby. The two MEN he saw before are loading up their automobile. Smiling, laughing. \nEXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING \nThe coach pulls to a stop. Angier and the driver look up. \nA plume of SMOKE is rising from further up the hill. \nEXT. CLEARING, PIKE'S PEAK -- MOMENTS LATER \nAngier rounds the bend in the road and comes into view of the laboratory. He FREEZES. \nThe fence has been TORN DOWN. Beyond it, the LAB has been BURNED TO THE GROUND. The metal tower is in SMOLDERING PIECES. Everything else is gone. \nAngier notices a piece of metal lying in the road near him, and, using his cane, flips it over. It's Alley's sign warning trespassers to keep out. \nINT. ANGIER'S ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- EVENING \nAngier takes down the picture of Julia from the mantel. He studies it a second then puts it in the top of his packed suitcase. \nINT. LOBBY, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING \nThe BELLBOYS wrestle with Angier's cases as Angier walks to the reception desk. The manager smiles up at him. \nMANAGER We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier. \nAngier takes out his wallet and begins laying down bills. \nMANAGER (CONT'D) We are sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave as well. He was very good to Colorado Springs. A very generous man. \nAngier smiles up at him, absently and begins to leave. \nMANAGER (CONT'D) Mr. Angier? \n(ANGIER TURNS) I didn't feel it was necessary to tell the other men about the box. \nAngier stops. \nANGIER What box? \nThe manager smiles. \nINT. HALLWAY, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING \nAngier follows the manager down a darkened hallway. \nMANAGER We never use these rooms in the off - season. It's a shame. \nThe manager stops at a set of DOUBLE DOORS and unlocks them. He pushes them open and ushers Angier through. \nINT. BALLROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- CONTINUOUS \nAngier steps into the massive, elegant room. \nStanding on the dance floor is an ENORMOUS SHIPPING CRATE. Stencilled on one side \"COLORADO SPRINGS\" \nAngier walks up to the huge crate, awestruck. \nAn envelope addressed to him has been stuck to the front. Angier stops it and begins to read. \nTESLA (V.O.) My dear Angier, you will find what you were looking for in the box. I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye... \nEXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK \nUnder cover of night, a group of FIGURES ransack the laboratory. \nTESLA (V.O.) But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado. \nThe figure begin setting FIRE to the sides of the laboratory. \nTESLA (V.O.) (CONT'D) The extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry. Perhaps you'll have more luck in your field, mystified. As to the use of the machine... \nINT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT \nThe open crate sits empty at the side of a derelict stage. Angier, in shirt sleeves is running cables to the MACHINE, which is standing center stage. \nTESLA (V.O.) Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions. I add only one suggestion on using the machine- \nEXT. COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK \nAlley holds open the door to a coach. Tesla steps up into it and looks back from the coach's open door, up the mountain. \nTESLA (V.O.) -Destroy it. Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean. \nHigh on the mountain, the laboratory is ABLAZE. \nTESLA (CONT'D) Such thing will only bring you misery. \nTesla folds himself into the coach, shutting the door as it moes off down the mountain. \nINT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT \nAngier moves to one side of the stage where he makes a hash mark with a piece of chalk. \nANGIER (V.O.) Tesla's warning is as unheard as he knew it would be. Today I tested the machine... \nHe loads A GUN and places it next to the machine. \nANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation... \nAngier THROWS THE SWITCH. The machine GROANS into LIFE- SPARKING and GLOWING as it gets up to full power. \nANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...if it went wrong I would not want to live like that for long... \nAngier closes his eyes for an instant, listening to its power, then THROWS HIMSELF INTO THE MACHINE.

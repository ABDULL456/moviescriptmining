KIMBALL His girlfriend doesn't think so. 
BATEMAN But...has anyone seen him in London? 
KIMBALL Actually, yes. 
BATEMAN Hmmm. 
KIMBALL Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so... 
BATEMAN Oh. 
KIMBALL Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship? 
BATEMAN What? 
KIMBALL I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts- 
BATEMAN Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and- 
KIMBALL Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing. 
A pause - the longest so far. 
BATEMAN Have you consulted a psychic? 
KIMBALL No. 
BATEMAN Had his apartment been burglarized? 
KIMBALL No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it. 
BATEMAN I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right? 
KIMBALL No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything. 
BATEMAN That's so typical, isn't it? 
KIMBALL It's just strange. (He stares out the window, lost in thought) One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then... 
BATEMAN Nothing. 
KIMBALL People just...disappear. 
BATEMAN The earth just opens up and swallows people. (He checks his Rolex) 
KIMBALL Eerie. Really eerie. 
Silence. 
BATEMAN (Standing up) You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes. 
KIMBALL Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late? 
BATEMAN Uh, no. There's one...down here. 
KIMBALL Oh really? I didn't know that. 
Bateman leads him to the door. 
BATEMAN Yes. It's very good. 
KIMBALL turns to face him. 
KIMBALL Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all... 
BATEMAN Absolutely, I'm 100% with you. 
KIMBALL Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman. 
Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his eyes and leans against the door, sweating.

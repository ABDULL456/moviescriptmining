A couple of kids are slammed loudly against the window in the excitement. 
Through the glass Jolie can hear: 
BLACK GIRL We won! We won! We won! 
SUPERIMPOSE in the top left corner in white letters: OJ Simpson was just found not guilty. 
The hallway is growing into total commotion and chaos. 
Jolie walks through the doorway into the hall and the camera follows without a cut. 
Jolie looks out of place as he takes it all in. 
The wild scene rages. 
Jolie looks back into the main office. 
Ray comes out of Principal Ganus's door. His eyes red from tears, he curses to himself. 
Principal Ganus emerges, acknowledges the commotion in the hallway. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS What the hell is going on out there? 
JOLIE OJ Simpson....not guilt. 
Principal Ganus is stone faced. He gestures Jolie into his office. 
Ray brushes shoulders with Jolie. 
RAY You're dead. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Look who you're stepping to, Ray. A little white boy? 
Ray blows it off. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS (BEAT) Jolie. Come with me. 
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Look. I'm not proud of what happened in that gym. 
Surrounded by proud school ornaments and paraphernalia. 
Jolie sits alone in a chair, an empty chair adjacent him. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Everyone who was caught fighting is being suspended for a minimum of three days. And that includes most of the team. But a suspension for you would only tarnish the reputation of the Magnet program. So... 
Principal Ganus thumbs through a manila envelope. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS You're going to do this school a favor, (BEAT) at the international math meet. 
He hands Jolie a form. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS You were great your freshman year. Your calculus teacher tells me your still great, but for some reason you quit. 
JOLIE I made JV that year. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Well, there's going to be no rematch of the Springbrook playoff game. Both teams are forfeiting. So now you've got plenty of time, that's for damn sure. 
JOLIE They're not rescheduling our game? That's insane. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS The math team needs you Jolie. We're on the verge of nationals. (MORE) 
PRINCIPAL GANUS (cont'd) This year we settles for nothing less than number one, second to none. (BEAT) In whole numbers. 
The principal laughs at his own joke. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS You can go now. 
Stunned, Jolie grabs his bag and heads for the door. 
PRINCIPAL GANUS Oh, one more thing. You will also join the team for an additional 40 hours of community service, as part of the new "Adopt a Highway" Program. It's part of the team punishment. 
INT. BALZERS HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 
JOLIE It's not fair man. I mean everyone got suspended on the team but me. Just because I'm in the Magnet.

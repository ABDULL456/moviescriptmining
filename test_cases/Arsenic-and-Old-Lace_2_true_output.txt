He comes back downstairs. 
MORTIMER Certainly not on the window-seat. I'm going to sleep on the window-seat. 
He crosses the room to sit on the window-seat. MORTIMER I'm going to sleep on the windows-eat from now on. 
ELAINE Mortimer ! 
Mortimer stands up and goes to Jonathan 
MORTIMER Now look. Now look, Jonathan. Now, be a good fellow. Here's ten dollars. Go out and haunt yourself a hotel. 
Jonathan throws Mortimer's money on the floor. Mortimer tries to step on it, but instead, he steps on Jonathan's foot. 
JONATHAN Mortimer, you know what I do to people who order me around. 
Einstein pulls Jonathan's sleeve. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Hey, Johnny. Mister Spenalzo. 
Mortimer bends down to look at Jonathan foot, then he touches his legs. 
JONATHAN What ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN What's going to happen to Mister Spenalzo ? 
Mortimer takes a fork on the table and stabs Jonathan's leg with it. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN We can't leave him here in the window-seat. Johnny ? JONATHAN Doctor, you know, Doctor, I've completely lost track of Mister Spenalzo. 
MORTIMER Wait ! Who's this Mister Spenalzo ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN A friend of ours Johnny was looking for. 
MORTIMER Don't you bring anyone else in here. Now, come on, beat it, both of you ! 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN It's all right, Johnny. While we are packing, I'll tell you about him. 
Jonathan walks to the staircase, and starts going upstairs, followed by Einstein. He stops a few steps before he reaches the balcony. JONATHAN I'll take care of you, Mortimer, in just a little while. 
He resumes his walking upstairs. 
MORTIMER How do you like that ? The guy stays away for twenty years and picks tonight of all nights to come back. Oh, Elaine, what are you doing here ? 
She falls in his arms. 
ELAINE Mortimer ! 
MORTIMER What's the matter, darling ? 
ELAINE I almost got killed. 
MORTIMER Killed ? Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha ! 
ABBY Oh, no ! 
MARTHA Oh, no ! It was Jonathan ! 
ABBY He mistook her for a sneak thief. 
MORTIMER Oh, that. 
Martha just found the shoe on the table and seems very intrigued by it. ELAINE (voice over) It was worse than that. He's some kind of a maniac. 
Abby looks at the shoe, and seems also very intrigued. Martha whispers something to her. 
MORTIMER (voice over) I know, darling, I know. 
ELAINE (voice over) Oh, Mortimer, I'm afraid of him. 
MORTIMER (voice over) Oh, darling, don't worry about it. I'm here now. Now forget it. 
Abby whispers back to Martha, who puts the shoe back on the table. The two sisters move away. 
ELAINE We were married today, we were going over Niagara Falls in a barrel, your brother tries to strangle me, a taxi's waiting, and now you want to sleep on a window-seat ! 
Mortimer hardly listens to her, but catches the last word. 
MORTIMER Window seat... Witherspoon. Darling, you'd better run along home. 
ELAINE What ? 
MORTIMER Yes, yes. Go home like a good girl. I got things to do. 
He sits at the desk and starts dialing on the telephone. 
ELAINE Mortimer ? But... but... 
MORTIMER No, no, please. (in the phone) Hello ? Operator ? Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please. 
ELAINE But, Mortimer, didn't you hear what I was just saying ? 
MORTIMER Yes, 2-7-0. 
ELAINE Your own brother Jonathan, he was trying to strangle me ! MORTIMER Please ! This is important ! 
ELAINE That ? 
MORTIMER Hello ? Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon ? This is Mortimer Brewster. 
WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Witherspoon is sitting behind his desk, the telephone receiver to his ear. 
WITHERSPOON Yes, Mr. Brewster, yes. 
He puts an effervescent pill in a glass of water. 
WITHERSPOON Well, I don't understand you. BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Elaine is crying, standing near the desk, where Mortimer is still on the telephone. 
MORTIMER (in the phone) Look, look, I... 
He raises his head to look at Elaine 
ELAINE He was going to kill me ! 
MORTIMER (to Elaine) Wait a minute, I can't hear the man. (to Witherspoon on the phone) What ? I've got the papers all drawn up. I know it's late, but I want you to come down here and get my brother immediately ! I's got to be done. (to Elaine) Please, darling, please.

JEFFREY You want to go talk to him? 
SANDY Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later. 
CUT TO: 
142. INT. DINER - DAY 
Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in the diner in a different booth, but having the same things as before. 
SANDY You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals. 
JEFFREY That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today? 
SANDY Shoot. 
JEFFREY Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove? 
SANDY (thinking) Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other. 
JEFFREY Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him. 
SANDY Oh yeah? 
JEFFREY Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. 
SANDY Jeffrey!! 
JEFFREY Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. 
SANDY I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment? 
JEFFREY Yeah. 
SANDY Jeffrey?. Why? 
JEFFREY I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret. 
SANDY You like mysteries that much? 
JEFFREY Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much. 
Jeffrey stands up and moves to her side of the booth.  They stare at each other. 
SANDY Oh yeah? 
Jeffrey leans over and kisses her gently.  She pulls away. 
SANDY Don't. please, Jeffrey. 
Jeffrey looks at her for a moment. 
JEFFREY You worry about me really? 
SANDY Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.

143. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Jeffrey winds his way up the staircase of Dorothy's apartment building. He hesitates before crossing to Dorothy's door.  He knocks on the door and Dorothy opens it. 
DOROTHY Come in. 
JEFFREY Hello. 
144. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Dorothy closes the door.  She chains it. 
They kiss.  The kiss gets hotter.  The feeling begins. 
They move down the hall to the back bedroom.  They've never made love there.  As they hurriedly undress Jeffrey sees the pointed child's hat with the propeller.  He picks it up and spins the propeller.  It makes a bit of music.  Dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward Jeffrey grabbing his hand, stopping him from turning the tiny propeller.  She gains some control of herself.  Jeffrey releases the hat into her hand. 
DOROTHY It used to make me laugh .but. 
JEFFREY I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy. 
DOROTHY Yes. Frank- 
JEFFREY Frank is coming? 
DOROTHY No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. (crying) . don't hate me. 
JEFFREY (very nervous) I sure don't hate you. 
DOROTHY I'm not crazy. (thinking) I know the difference between right and wrong. 
JEFFREY That's good. 
Jeffrey moves to get out of bed. 
DOROTHY (she poses) Do you like my body? 
JEFFREY Sure I do.

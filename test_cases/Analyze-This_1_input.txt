JELLY Anything. 
VITTI You have to find me a doctor. 
JELLY We just came from the doctor. 
VITTI Not that kind of doctor.   I need a head doctor. 
JELLY You're gonna change your face like Sonny Black? Don't get his nose though, he looks like a pig. 
VITTI Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud. Do I have to spell everything out? 
JELLY It saves time. 
VITTI I need you to find me a psychiatrist. 
JELLY Wow. This is like the Psychic Network or something. I just ran into a psychiatrist. Actually he ran into me. 
VITTI Is he any good? 
JELLY Yeah, he seemed like a smart guy. He had a business card and everything -- 
VITTI He had a card? That's a real fuckin' achievement.

JELLY What do you need a shrink for anyway? 
VITTI It's not for me. It's for a friend. This friend is having some problems, so I'm going to ask the shrink some questions and get some answers for my friend. 
JELLY Got it. 
VITTI And nobody can know. If anyone hears I'm talking to a shrink, it could be interpreted the wrong way. You know what I mean? 
JELLY Of course. Absolutely. (then) Can I ask you one thing? 
VITTI What? 
JELLY This friend.    Is it me? 
CUT TO: 
22   INT. BEN'S OFFICE - DAY                                           22 
Ben is with a patient, CARL ANDERSON, a high-strung milquetoast in his late forties. 
BEN Carl, I'm detecting a pattern here. You seem to settle too easily for things. 
CARL You're right.    I do. 
BEN No, well, there you go. You just did it again. I suggested something and you immediately agreed. 
(CONTINUED) 
22   CONTINUED:                                                        22 
CARL You're right.    I did. 
BEN Why do you think you do that? 
CARL I don't know. 
BEN Well, sometimes people do it because they fear rejection or disapproval, but you can't let that worry you, Carl. And you can't agree with things just for the sake of agreeing. Stand your ground. Don't let people roll over you. 
The door opens and Jelly enters. 
JELLY Dr. Sobol? 
BEN Excuse me!    I'm in a session here. 
JELLY Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. 
BEN You're... You're one of the guys I rear-ended the other night. 
JELLY Bingo. (to Carl) Get outta here. 
Jelly takes Carl by the elbow and lifts him off the couch. 
JELLY Upsa-daisy.   You got a coat, nutbar? 
BEN What are you doing? 
JELLY He's leaving. 
(CONTINUED) 
22   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 22 
BEN The hell he is. He's not going anywhere until we're done with his session. 
Jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket, removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of fifties. 
JELLY (to Carl) I'll give you a hundred bucks to get out of here. 
Carl looks at the money, then he gives Ben a plaintive look. 
BEN Don't take it, Carl. 
Carl looks back to Jelly.

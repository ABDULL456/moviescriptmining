It's a French book. \nHe pulls a DUFFEL BAG from the ground. He opens it to reveal \nNINETY FIVE THOUSAND IN CASH. \nBRESSANT That wasn't a book. It was a cartoon Helene knows. \nHELENE Fuck you. \nANGIE So, you bring in the FBI at this point? \nBRESSANT That's the worst thing we could do. \nANGIE Why is that? \nBRESSANT 'Cause I don't want Cheese to open a bag full of newspaper and kill Amanda. \nANGIE It ' s kidnapping. \nBRESSANT I don't see a note. (turns To Poole) You see a note? \nPOOLE Nope. \nBRESSANT We're investigating a missing children's case. Has nothing to do with kidnapping.

There was a lot of tension between black American kids and Haitians-and he got it the worst.He had no running water at home. This one girl was on him real hard 'cause he smelled bad, calling him 'cheese.' All of a sudden, he breaks a bottle, holds her down, and carves the word Cheese in her face. She lost an eye. Someone found it on the sidewalk the next day. \nPATRICK And the name stuck. \nANGIE But I'm sure Amanda will be fine. \nBRESSANT Just keep your mouth shut, okay? We can get her back. It'll be fine. I have no fear of this idiot. \nHELENE \n(TO BRESSANT) You're gonna talk to him? \nBRESSANT That's the next step, yeah. \nHELENE Tell him I'm sorry. Tell him I apologize. \nPOOLE Sorry goes a long way. \nHELENE (sniffles, remembering fondly) She's a handful, that one. At least I know she's giving them hell. They react to this woman's feeble grip on reality. \nPATRICK What about Ray? \nBRESSANT You know what percentage of murders were solved last year in Boston? Twenty nine. Less in Chelsea. \nPOOLE Take her home. We'll handle Chelsea. They move to go. \nHELENE I'm hungry. \nPATRICK We' 11 get you some food. \nHELENE No, her. That's the last thing she said to me before I put her to bed. She said, 'Ifm hungry.\" I mean, they fed her, right? She's not still hungry? \nPATRICK I donft know. \nEXT.

She looks at him. \nANGIE Does it make you not want to? \nPatrick drinks his beer. \nPATRICK There's a political party in Holland that openly advocates pedophelia and won seats in parliament. In America four hundred thousand kids get abused every year. There are half a million convicted, registered sex offenders, two-thirds of them for molesting children under fourteen, there are a hundred thousand child porn web sites. They busted one in texas had seventy thousand members-- people who gave their credit cards . . . There's a group, the 'Rene Guyon' society, whose motto is 'sex before eight or it's too late.' There's a rise in the victimization of 'pre-verbal' children, for the obvious reason that they can't report their accusers. One in five American girls is sexually abused or victimized before they turn eighteen. But only one third of those every tells anyone in their lifetime that they were abused. She gives him a look: 'oh, really?' \nPATRICK ( CONT ' D) I read that in two minutes on the computer while you were taking a shower. \nANGIE And that tells you you don't want children. \nPATRICK It tells me there aren't enough gas chambers. \nA beat. \nPATRICK (CONT' D) I' d love to have a kid. \nANGIE Yeah? \nPATRICK I'm just not sure a kid would love to be here. \nShe looks sympathetic. \nPATRICK (CONT' D) I don't want to be the guy who fucked this up. \nINT.

Angle is on the far side of the bed. \nThe phone rings. \nANGIE Yeah? \nBRESSANT Guess you did something right. \nANGIE What ? \nBRESSANT Cheese came around. Called in and said he wants to make a drop. Said he left something in your mailbox. \nANGIE Really? \nBRESSANT Well, you're gonna have to check the mailbox yourself, but yeah. \nANGIE Great. \nBRESSANT It is and it isn't. They tape calls coming into the station now. \nANGIE What does that mean? \nBRESSANT It means Jack heard about it, he wants you down here and he's fuckin' pissed. \nANGIE'S APT - MORNING \nEXT. PATRICK    & \nThey walk out the front door and, sure enough, there is an ENVELOPE in the mailbox. But what gets their attention is that jammed into the box, along with the letter is AMANDA'S \nBLANKET. Patrick takes it out, hands it to Angie. They react. \nINT. BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT BUILDING          DAY \nPatrick and Angie follow Devin down the hall. \nPATRICK What are you doing here? \nDEVIN When the boss wants you met, he only sends the best. \nANGIE Or when he wants you brought up the back way. \nDevin smiles. \nDEVIN That, too. \nThey walk through an area with cells in it that looks medieval. They move through another door into a small control room. Then they walk into a lobby. He comes to a stop at Doyle's SECRETARY'S DESK. His SECRETARY, RENE ( 3 0 , attractive) seems to know Devin. \nDEVIN (CONT'D) (re: Doyle's ofice) He in there? \nShe nods. \nRENE Yeah he said just let 'em in. \nDEVIN That's what he said? \nShe doesn't answer.      Devin turns to Patrick and Angie. \nDEVIN (CONT'D) Good luck. \nHe starts back.   They turn to the door and ENTER. \nINT. DOYLE'S OFFICE - DAY \nPatrick and Angie fail at entering unobtrusively. Poole and Bressant are being lectured by Captain Jack Doyle. Doyle turns his attention (for the first time) to Patrick and Angie. \n", "test2_true": "Doyle picks up a paper TRANSCRIPT and hands it to Patrick. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) This is the transcript of a call that was recorded coming into the station this morning. Care to read the highlighted portion? \nPatrick reads. \nPATRICK Caller: Bitch you better have my money. \nPatrick looks up.    The room is quite.   He continues: \nPATRICK (CONT' D) Detective Bressant: Who is this? Caller: You know who the fuck this is, fool (Creole curse words)- If you want that girl back you need to meet me up Quincy tonight. Fuck around for a minute and I throw that girl in the lake. \nDOYLE The \"lake\" he refers to is the water in the abandoned quarry. He refers to the transcript. \nDOYLE (CONT' D) Detective Bressant goes on to make an unauthorized ransom arrangement to exchange Amanda McCready for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars, tonight in just that location. A moment of quiet. Doyle gestures toward Bressant. \nDOYLE ( CONT ' D ) After some discussion, Detective Bressant was kind enough to produce this: He indicates the bag of money on his desk. \nDOYLE (CONT' D) Look familiar? \nPatrick and Angle offer a guilty plea by their silence. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) Seeing as you two made the initial \nCONTACT-- \nANGIE Captain, we were concerned for the safety \nOF-- \nDOYLE I understand what your concern was. My concern, interestingly, is also for the well being of that child. And now that concern has been elevated because of the risky and ill-advised course of action you people have taken. \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \nDOYLE (CONT' D) The four of you have made me party to an illegal activity without my knowledge or consent and I don't fucking appreciate it. \nBRESSANT You don't have to be party to it, sir . . . \nDOYLE The hell I don't. If I delay this now, after this agreement, it would only further endanger the life of this girl. Does that sound like something you expect me to do? \nPATRICK I'll accept responsibility for-- \nDOYLE You' 11 accept-- Don' t come in here and get noble with me. Responsibility is earned. You can't take something you have no shoulder for. \nHe gathers his composure. \nDOYLE (CONT' D) Let me see the note. \nPatrick produces the note and the blanket. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) Good God. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TACTICAL BRIEFING ROOM - MINUTES LATER \nRemy and Nick stand with Patrick and Angie going over the RANSOM MAP which is tacked to the wall. Next to it are a geographical survey of the quarry and a street map of the surrounding area. \nBRESSANT They want to separate us. He points to diverging paths on the map. \nBRESSANT (CONT'D) The note instructs you two to wait here on the south side for Amanda and Nick and I to be at the clearing by the edge with the money. \n( MORE ) \nBRESSANT (CONT'D) \n(BEAT) Once Amanda is turned over to you at your position, call us on the radio and we'll turn over the cash. \nDoyle, having been observing, interjects. \nDOYLE This man won't come alone. Who is he likely to bring? \nPATRICK Chris Mullen was in the apartment when we made the offer. \nDOYLE What do you know about him? \nPATRICK Well, it was probably him that killed Ray for Cheese. If I had to guess. \nPOOLE He didn't ask you what you guessed.    He asked you what do you know. \nPATRICK I know he's a six foot, thirty year old, caucasian heroin addict. And I know it was him, not Cheese, who rolled up Pokey Jackson and shot him in the head. \n(BEAT) So there's that, too. Remy is the voice of reason today. \nBRESSANT I think we're all set here, Captain. \nDOYLE No one else knows about this, correct? \nAngie has a concern. \nANGIE I just wonder.. . \nDOYLE (turns to ask: ) Yes? \n", "test2_id": 139, "test3_input": "their grief still POOLE'S FAMILY h u d d l e s n e a r t h e c a s k e t - - h e a v y .

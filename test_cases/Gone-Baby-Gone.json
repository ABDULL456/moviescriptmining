{"train": "GONE BABY GONE \nWritten by \nBen Affleck & Aaron Stockard \nMorning. \nClouds moving through the sky. \nWe see various shots of the city, exterior storefronts, people going about their lives and some wider shots of the city. \nAs they continue, the hour gets progressively later in the day until the final sequence which takes place at night. Over this we hear our guy, PATRICK (30). \nPATRICK (V. 0 . ) To people who grow up here, this city is like family. The thing about family, about the city, about the church, about the people you grow up with-- is that no matter how much they hurt you, no matter what the cost is, you still love them. \nAnd despite all our flaws-- what we do to each other-- what is done to us-- I've always felt proprietary about it all. \nLike the old commercial for dog food: 'doesn't your dog deserve to be treated like a member of the family?' I've always believed it depended on the dog. Beyond that, the most I thought about anything was what I wanted to do. Who I wanted to be. To rise where my father said I couldn't go, to succeed. To be a man. \nEXT. MCCREADY THREE DECKER       NIGHT \nA playground at night, completely empty. One of the swings drifts back and forth . . . The back door to a home is open. A piece of light cuts across the porch from inside . . . \nUp the back stairwell another door is open, leading into an apartment . . . Down the hall, a third door opens to reveal a small, sparse bedroom. A small mattress on the floor holds a dirty-faced little girl asleep under her blanket . . . Footsteps heard, quietly moving through the house . . . A three foot gate hangs open. A car starts and pulls away. We begin to hear the voice of Jack Doyle. \nDOYLE Amanda McCready was taken from her home sometime between eight and eight thirty. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PATRICK AND ANGIE' S CAR - DAY \nJACK DOYLE (60s) speaks at a press conference on a small, PORTABLE TELEVISION with a 3x4 inch screen resting on the dashboard of a car and plugged into the lighter outlet. \nDOYLE She is four years old, has blond hair and green eyes, 35 pounds and about 3 and a half feet tall. Amanda's mother says she put her to bed in her B e a u t y and t h e B e a s t nightgown . . . \nPatrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro sit in the car watching idly. TV: A clip from an interview with Amanda's mother, HELENE MCCREADY (29-39). She looks haggard and in desperate need of sleep, if not a stint in detox. Standing beside her is her brother LIONEL and sister-in-law BEATRICE, both of whom we will come to know later. \nHELENE (ON TV) The thing is she just always had a smile on her face, you know? That was her. She was always smilin'. \n(TEARS WELLING) I mean, who would take my little girl? What did she ever do to anyone? \nPATRICK Did you know her? \nANGIE Vaguely. \n(RE: TV) This is horrible. \nPATRICK Not if you're channel nine. \nANGIE That's Timmy Reilly. Is he a cop now? A press conference with JACK DOYLE (68) comes on. Beneath his image is written \"JACK DOYLE, CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN.\" \nDOYLE (ON TV) I know the pain of losing a daughter --We will pursue every avenue-- \nPATRICK They can't be taking that many avenues. The whole force is outside the house. \nThey are parked on a street in Dorchester lined with residential apartments and storefronts. \nA KNOCK on the windowsill startles them both. It's A \nNEIGHBORHOOD GUY, BOBBY. \nBOBBY (winks, being funny ) Hey. How are you? \nPATRICK Good, Bobby. Nice to see you. \nBobby moves on down the street. She looks at Patrick. \nANGIE This is why it's embarrassing to do surveillance three blocks from where we live. \nOver Patrick and through the windshield we see A MAN AND A WOMAN emerge from a MINT GREEN 3-DECKER. \nPATRICK There they go. \nThey kiss before parting ways. The MAN hops into a GREEN LINCOLN while the WOMAN heads down the block, on foot. \nPATRICK (CONT' D) They' re splitting up. \nANGIE Go with him. I'll follow the mother. \nAngie jumps out and starts following the woman. Patrick pulls slowly from the curb and trails the Lincoln. \nANGIE'S CAR, DRIVING - DAY (MOVING) \nINT. PATRICK   & \nPatrick turns a corner on a residential street. Then another one, keeping about a block between himself and the Lincoln. \nEXT. DORCHESTER ST.         CONTINUOUS \nSuddenly, A TEN YEAR OLD KID darts in front of Patrick atop a BMX bicycle. Patrick has to stop. \nPATRICK Get out of the way. \nKID Fuck your mother. \nPatrick comes in. There are a bunch of the ubiquitous MISSING CHILDREN FLIERS on the ground. A door to a unit is ajar. \nEXT. MAUREEN QUINN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nPatrick eases the door open a bit. Patrick goes to his haunches so as to stay out of sight at the opening. Through the crack we see a man and a woman arguing. A woman MAUREEN, Irish (34) is making breakfast. She calls out to the next room. \nMAUREEN \n(CALLING OUT) You want them eggs runnin' ? \nTOMMY MEADE rolls into frame, bitching about his condition. \nTOMMY Yah. Where'd my father leave the bag? \nShe indicates. \nMAUREEN By the chair. \nTOMMY You know Cheryl Martin said Donna hired missing persons investigators to find me? \nMAUREEN \n(FEEBLY) \nYou're not missin' \nTOMMY Fuckin' bullshit. I can't go back to my own home to get my own clothes for fear of gettin' my wages garnished to support Mike Cuddehy' s fuckin' kids? \nPatrick looks at the floor, the BAG the Father was carrying has CLOTHES in it. The KID comes to the opening in the door. He looks at Patrick. Patrick holds a finger to his lips: shhh. \nEXT TAFT ST. - DAY Patrick parks and walks by various families. \nPATRICK AND ANGIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY \nINT. \nPatrick looks at a paper. It's their ad. \nPATRICK \"Dorchester' s best missing persons?\" That's terrible. \nANGIE What's wrong with it? \nPATRICK It's like having world's tallest midget as your slogan. \nANGIE It's better than the old one. \nPATRICK You're just saying that cause the new one has your name on it. Patrick takes his gun out, wallet, puts them on the table. \nANGIE At a certain point the person who books half the business is entitled to her name on the door. \n(BEAT) Speaking of which, how'd you get Tommy? \nPATRICK These people need to learn how to hide better. Staying at your girlfriend's in OC projects ain't slick. \n(BEAT) \n( MORE ) \nPATRICK (CONT'D) And the reason you book half the business is cause no one's trying to get in my trousers. \nANGIE Keep telling yourself that. \nINT. PATRICK AND ANGIE'S BEDROOM       NIGHT \nLong, intimate improvised scene in their bedroom. \nINT. PATRICK AND ANGIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nPatrick walks down the hallway toward the kitchen. \nPATRICK Yo, you want some cereal? \nANGIE (O.S.) I'm in the bathroom. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nMakes cereal.   Walks out. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nPatrick walks by the door. He pushes on it. She BUMPS it shut. He stands there for a minute, thinks of an explanation. \nPATRICK I just wanted to see if you wanted some food . \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nPatrick comes into the living room, the television is on.   He puts the cereal down and starts eating. \nJACK DOYLE (60s) speaks at a press conference. \nDOYLE She is four years old, has blond hair and green eyes, 35 pounds and about 3 and a half feet tall. Amanda's mother says she put her to bed in her B e a u t y a n d t h e B e a s t nightgown . . . Patrick watches. TV: A clip from an interview with Amanda's mother, HELENE \nMCCREADY (29-39). \nHELENE (ON TV) The thing is she just always had a smile on her face, you know? That was her. She was always smilin'. Angle enters. \nBEA Or Amanda. He doesn't think she's his. \nPATRICK Is there anyone you know? An acquaintance who could have taken her . . . a neighbor? \nLIONEL I don't know. You think she was definitely taken though? \nPATRICK If she were lost I think they . . . \nBea may be coming unglued. \nBEA Couldn't she have fallen down a well or something? Like in Texas? \nPATRICK That's not what we hope for.. . \nAwkward moment. \nANGIE How is Helene holding up? \nLIONEL She's trying. \nBEA Please, Lionel. \nLIONEL Look, it. I had my problems, hard bust at 22. Bea straightened me out. Helene hasn't had that. \nBEA No, she has you. You find her work-- she was our housekeeper for a year and a half- \n(BEAT) Look, come talk to Helene yourself. I don't care if you think you can help. Try. There must be something you can do. \nShe looks at them expectantly. \nPATRICK We'll meet you over there. He throws Angie another small look. \nBEA We don't have a lot of money, but I saved over the years. Don't think we can't afford it. Angie gives her a smile. \nANGIE'S CAR - LATER \nINT. PATRICK   & \nPatrick and Angie are in their car. They pull to a stop, looking at something off-camera right. \nANGIE If a missing child isn't found in seventy two hours they are almost never recovered. \nPATRICK Pretty quick with the facts for someone who's so unqualified. \nANGIE I read that on the computer in two minutes while you were getting dressed. \nPATRICK See that, you're already on the case. \nANGIE We aren't needed, we canrt make a difference and we can't take their money. \nPATRICK I don't want to take their money. \nANGIE I don't want to find a child in a dumpster. \nPATRICK Neither do I. I want to find one alive who we can bring home. \nANGIE We have a good life, Patrick. \nPATRICK This won't change that. \nANGIE You go out in the rain, you get wet. \nPATRICK If it's a four year-old girl out there, you go out and bring her back. We'll be okay. \n(SMILES) It's just rain. \nDAY \nEXT HELENE'S APT.   - \nWe might recognize it from the nighttime abduction sequence except that now it's swarming with: CAMERA TRUCKS, MEDIA TYPES and LOOKEY-LOOS. \nThis is a big shot full of REPORTERS, LOCALS, KIDS, A GUY \nWITH A GRILL, AN ICE-CREAM TRUCK. People mill around and converse. KIDS wave behind REPORTERS heads, trying to get on camera. We carry Patrick and Angie through with a Steadi-Cam as they react to the circus. \nA FIELD REPORTER does a stand-up, dressed formally to the waist in a sports coat and tie but wears shorts below. He has heavy pancake make-up on. \nPATRICK Block party. \nEXT. HELENE'S APT - DAY \nThey reach the front porch. One, OFFICER REILLY (from TV) stops Patrick as he comes in. \nOFFICER REILLY Friends of the family? \nPatrick rolls his eyes. \nPATRICK Timrny. It's me. \nLionel is out on the porch. \nLIONEL It's okay. Come on in. Patrick heads down the hall toward the kitchen but turns back when he sees Angie going into the living room. \nINT. HELENE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM         CONTINUOUS \nSAME       LATER (KITCHEN) \nThe sink is FULL OF SHIT. Lionel tries getting out a cup for coffee. \nPatrick, Lionel, and Bea sit around the kitchen. Angie makes her way around the kitchen, looking over the environment. Shots of the mess that is Helene's apartment (and a nod to our extraordinary set decorator.) \nPATRICK What about who she hangs out with? What kind of people are around? \nBea looks to Lionel to answer this sort of thing. \nLIONEL I don't know. She's at the Fillmore all the time. \nPATRICK (knows its reputation) The Fillmore Lounge? \nLIONEL She drinks every day, she's got the gene. The disease. Our parents had it, too. \nPATRICK She use drugs? \nLIONEL I think she does a little coke. \nPATRICK How much is a little? \nLIONEL I don't know . . . few times a week, maybe. How much is a lot? \nPATRICK Few times a week is a lot. \nLIONEL Then she does a lot. I don't know anything about that. \n(TO PATRICK) I put the plug in the jug, myself. I got twenty three years sobriety. There is a short beat before: \nPATRICK f o r lack of anything else) Good for you. \nANGIE What's Amanda like? \nBEATRICE She's quiet. Has her manners, please and thank yous. She tries her hardest to be good. \nANGIE You mind if we look in her room? \nINT AMANDA'S BEDROOM - DAY Patrick and Angie stand just inside the door to Amanda's drab little bedroom. The only furniture a TWIN-SIZED MATTRESS and a CHEST OF DRAWERS. It's all third hand. \nPATRICK We get a bonus for finding the furniture? \nPatrick looks over the dirtied walls, faded glowing stars, stickers, a sad sight. \nANGIE Maybe she ran away. \nDOYLE (0.C.) Solved it yet? Patrick and Angie turn to the voice. Standing in the doorway is JACK DOYLE, the police officer from the TV report. \nPATRICK Almost . He extends his hand. \nDOYLE Jack Doyle. \nPATRICK \n(REACHING OUT) Patrick Kenzie. Angela Gennaro. \nDOYLE Nice to meet you. \nANGIE Good to meet you, Captain \nDOYLE I take it Bea hired you? \nPATRICK She wants to cover as much ground as she can. He looks them over. \nANGIE I take it you didn't want us hired. \nDOYLE These people aren' t rich. \nPATRICK We understand that. This is about helping in whatever way we can. Not about making money. \nDOYLE Good. I don't care who finds her. I just want it done. \nANGIE We want that too, sir. \nDOYLE Fine. Keep us apprised. \nPATRICK Of course... is there any way we can see what you're looking at so far? \nDOYLE \n(SMILES) I'll put my two best men on it. Where can they find you? \nEXT FILLMORE LOUNGE       DAY \nThe Fillmore Lounge is a dreary looking bar up an alley off Dorchester Avenue. \nDegenerate drinkers are now forced to go outside and smoke under the noon day sun and the place's faux, stacked stone facade . \nINT FILLMORE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS And it's no more welcoming inside. Men come here to nurse their drug habits, their alcoholism and their hate. \nWhile you wouldn't think there were many clamoring to get into their club, they don't look kindly on potential applicants. At one end of the bar, LENNY (mid 40' s) sips a whiskey and studies the Keno results. In the rear, 4 ALCOHOLICS sit around muttering to one another. And at one of the tables a CAULIFLOWER FACED MAN drinks alone. In addition there is a SMATTERING OF ROUGH LOOKING FACES. The bartender BIG DAVE (hence the name) has a newspaper spread out before him on the bar. \nPATRICK I'm not asking for the combination to the safe here . . . \nBIG DAVE I got nothin' to say. I already talked to the cops. \nBIG DAVE Don' t run your mouth like you're better than me. \nPATRICK Just cool it, all right? \nLENNY 'Cool it\" Listen to this douche bag. \nBIG DAVE I bet she fucks this asshole in half. AN ALCOHOLIC calls out to Lenny. \nALCOHOLIC #1 Ask her if she sucks cock. \nLENNY Ask her yourself. The door outside is ajar. LENNY'S PAL pushes it CLOSED. \nPATRICK What the fuck is wrong with you? \nLENNY You know, I wouldn't mind seein' some tit. Anyone else like tit? \nALCOHOLIC # 3 I like tuna. \nALCOHOLIC # 2 Show me your tunaaaa! \nANGIE Shut the fuck up. \nALCOHOLIC #4 (mimes throwing his voice) Twat steak! \nANGIE Don't be stupid, Lenny. \nALCOHOLIC # 2 He's talking to his friends. \nLENNY Must be your good looks, Dave, bringin' in all the new snatch. There's some good lookin' pussy in here tonight. \nThe alcoholic men are laughing, egging one another on. \nBIG DAVE Lenny, think she wants to see your prick, first. Patrick reaches into his waistband and puts his hand on a SMALL HOLSTER, revealing a 9mrn Kahr handgun. \nPATRICK No, Lenny. No one wants to see your prick. \nB I G DAVE I do! \nB i g Dave l a u g h s .

Get out \nPATRICK Fuck you, make me a martini. \nANGIE Patrick, letfs go. They move to the door. \nEXT DORCHESTER AVE.- CONTINUOUS \nPatrick and Angie emerge. They look to one another. Sounds of laughter return inside. The guys appear to have gone right back to their day. Patrick tucks his gun away and looks to Angie. \nPATRICK You okay? \nANGIE I'm fine. How's your hand. \nPATRICK It fuckinf stings. He indicates his hand, there is some blood. He smiles. They are a little rattled. \nANGIE Thanks for that. He smiles. \nPATRICK No problem. \nOMIT \nPATRICK That's not what I meant \nANGIE Is this who you think has Amanda? \nPOOLE \n(FROWNING) Well, they' re just suspects and there's some holes in the theory. Corwin likes boys. And he likes 'em seven to nine. \nA pause. \nPATRICK \n(INNOCENTLY) That's what you got? There are no other suspects? \nBRESSANT \n(OFFENDED) Yeah. That's it. A convicted finger blaster who plans to keep a pre-teen at the foot of his bed and just cut off his \nANKLE BRACELET-- \nPOOLE Take it easy, Remy-- \nBRESSANT --Who the fuck is this guy? You're here because Jack Doyle had us extend you a courtesy. You got something to contribute, be my guest. Otherwise go back to your Harry Potter book. \nPATRICK I think you misunderstood my tone, sergeant detective. They gauge one another. \nANGIE Isn't it usually someone who knows the victim? \nPOOLE I think Helene McCready has plenty of people in her life capable of this. \nPATRICK I'm sure you've interviewed Ray Likanski. \nPOOLE Who? \nPATRICK Ray Likanski. Skinny Ray? \n(BEAT) No? \nBRESSANT Never heard of him. \nPATRICK Well, with all due respect, we might be able to contribute on that point-- \nPOOLE How' s that? \nPATRICK The night Amanda went missing Ray was doing coke at the Fillmore Lounge for two hours between eight and ten. \nBRESSANT Fascinating. \nPATRICK With Helene McCready. Poole and Bressant are genuinely surprised by this. \nPOOLE She did bullshit us... \nBRESSANT \n(TO POOLE) We need to straighten her out. \nANGIE Why would she lie about that? \nPOOLE 'Cause it's fucking embarrassing. They go for their coats. Patrick takes the MUG SHOTS. \nPATRICK I'll just grab a copy.. . As they stand, getting their things, Angie turns to Remy. \nPATRICK (CONT' D) What kind of name is Bressant? \nBRESSANT The kind they give you in Louisiana. \nPATRICK I thought you were from here. \nBRESSANT Depends on how you look at it. You might think you're more 'from heref than I am, for example-- but then again, I been living here longer than you been alive. \n(BEAT) So who's right? Patrick shakes his head. \nPATRICK I'll have to mull that over. He takes the photos. \nPATRICK ( CONT ' D) We'll meet you over there. \nCUT TO: \nTRETT PHOTOS       ROBERTA'S FACE \nBUBBA (O.C.) What the fuck makes you think I know people like this? \nINT. BUBBA'S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER \nReveal BUBBA ROGOWSKI. He is around 30 and hard. He has a calm opacity which belies his strength. His loft is spare and industrial. \nPATRICK I know you don't pay your rent doin' peoplers taxes. \nBUBBA I don't do it sellin' penny rocks to wall- eyed child molesters neither. \nPATRICK Just this one, Corwin Earle, is a molester. He might be staying with the other two baseheads. Just if you hear somethin' . \nBUBBA What are you two? Crime dogs now? \nPATRICK We got hired to help find that little girl. \nLIONEL Of what, drugs? \nHELENE Yeas, Lionel. \nBEATRICE What kind of drugs? \nHELENE Yay, ron. . . \nBEATRICE What does that mean? \nPOOLE Cocaine and heroin. \nBEATRICE No, we would have seen the tract marks-- \nBRESSANT Not if you snort it, right sugar? \nHELENE Less addictive that way. \nHelene gets up and gets a beer. It's 10:15 am. \nINT. HELENE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nThe conversation has moved to the living room. The same participants, but the collection of EMPTY BEER CANS surrounding Helene suggest she's loosened up some. \nPatrick peers out the WINDOW to see the CIRCUS below (POV) \nBRESSANT I don't know Helene. I keep thinking about this thing I heard. You know where I'm going with this? \nHELENE No. \nBRESSANT Did you know I used to work DCU? \nHELENE I give a fuck. \nBRESSANT Right. So, I still know some of those guys real well. Anyway, I heard that someone ripped Cheese off on a New Hampshire run. You didn't hear that, did you? Angle on Patrick and Angie. \nHELENE No. \nBRESSANT Care to take a polygraph? \nHELENE \n(PROUDLY) Already passed. \nBRESSANT Different questions this time. \nPOOLE How much you take, Helene? Nothing. Angle on Patrick. \nPOOLE (CONT'D) It's all right. We don't care about hopheads beatin' each other. We care about your daughter. \n(GENTLY) Come on. How much? A beat. \nBRESSANT You want Amanda back or not? Silence in the room. \nBRESSANT (CONT'D) Do you give a fuck about your kid? Another beat. \nPOOLE We know you took the money. How much did you take? \nBRESSANT rising, scary) How much? She takes a pull on her beer. Looks around. Fuck it. \nHELENE Ninety five. The room goes quiet. \nLIONEL Hundred? \nHELENE rolls her eyes) Thousand. \nBEATRICE Nintey five thousand dollars?! \nHELENE Yeas, Bea! \nBRESSANT Howrd you do it. She exhales a long thread of smoke. \nHELENE Two weeks ago me and Ray did a run up Nashua to drop four keys on some bikers. When we was walking back through the motel with the money, all these cops swooped in and went for the bikers. Amanda was with us so we pretended to be like a family and they went right past us. So we just-- got in the car and took off. \nBEATRICE You took Amanda with you? \nHELENE What am I gonna do? Leave her in the car, Bea? \nBEATRICE (shakes head, plainly) You are an abomination. God as my witness. \nHELENE \n(GETS 'EMOTIONALR) You know what, Bea? It's hard bein' a mother. It's hard raisinf children. (beat, pointedly) And if God made you barren then you can' t judge me. 'Cause you wouldnrt fuckin' know. By Bears silence, and the narrowing of her eyes, we presume this to be a low blow and that Bea can't have children. \nBRESSANT Hey. (snaps fingers at Helene) Right here. What happened? \nHelene takes a pull from her beer. \nHELENE When we was driving back. Ray's like, 'everyone's gonna think the cops got the money too.' \nBRESSANT You told Cheese the cops got it? \nPATRICK But you and Ray kept the money? \nHELENE This whole fuckin' thing is Ray' s fault. Reactions to this realization. \nPATRICK That's a mistake. He'll never talk to a badge. I know him. If there's a deal to be brokered we're the ones who can do it. \nBRESSANT No. Me and Nick are handling this. This is too important. \nPATRICK If you two go in, negotiate a ransom for a girl, then it is kidnapping and that's the FBI. \nANGIE All you're gonna do is scare him and the more scared he is the worse it is for her. \nThe look at each other. \nPATRICK Do you want to get the kid back or not? \nBRESSANT I'm gonna take that as a rhetorical question. \nPATRICK Sit fuckin' tight. We know him, he111 talk to us and we'll be right back. \nCUT TO: \nA PIPE BEING SMOKED. MARIJUANA BURNS \nINT. CHEESE'S HOUSE, BACK ROOM - MINUTES LATER \nCHEESE Been a long time. \nCHEESE JEAN BAPTISTE sits in frame. He is a wiry, intense man who looks over Patrick and Angie suspiciously. \nAlong with Cheese, there are a MAN (CHRIS MULLEN, 30) and a WOMAN (Cheese's Girlfriend, 22, from Laos) . There are flat screen plasma TVs, piles of clothes and nearly sixty boxes of sneakers against one wall. \nPatrick and Angie sit opposite Cheese. Cheese exhales. He gestures to his girlfriend. \nCHEESE (CONT' D) I'm a talk some private shit. \nShe starts to go. Chris remains. \nCHEESE (CONT' D) But don't get too far. \nGIRL You know I' 11 be right here. \nHe looks them over. He is languid but extremely intimidating. \nCHEESE Bitches love the cheddar. \nSmall laugh. \nPATRICK How you been, Chris? \nCHRIS MULLEN Better than you. \nPATRICK Good to hear it. \nCHEESE \n(TO CHRIS) Be cool. \n(BEAT) Been too long not to see a fool. I give you an audience. \n(BEAT) Go. \nPatrick and Anqie exchange looks. He goes. \nPATRICK We found what you were lookin' for in Chelsea. \nCHEESE What makes you think I am concerned with the doings in Chelsea? \nPATRICK Cause I know one of the idiots who robbed you lives there. \nCHEESE What idiot? \nPATRICK The one you just killed. \nCHEESE I don't know about nobody gettin' killed. If someone robbed me and end up dead, you know, life a ma' fucker. \nHe looks at Chris, they smile.   Angie leans forward. \nANGIE Cheese, I appreciate you're seeing us. I know you're busy so we' 11 be quick. \n(BEAT) We have your money. It was buried in Ray' s backyard. \n(BEAT) We want to give it back to you in exchange for Amanda. The two police outside are the only other people who know. They're willing to risk their careers to do this quietly and they've sent us in here to demonstrate that. They don't want to investigate you or prosecute you for anything -- they just want the girl back. \nCHEESE What you talkin' about?   What girl? \nANGIE \n(PATIENCE TRIED) You know what girl. Cheese. Amanda McCready. Who has nothing to do with Helene stealing from you. \n(BEAT) Don't punish her for who her mother is. \n(BEAT) Tell us where to meet you, tell us what your terms are and we'll do whatever makes you comfortable. You'll get your money and you made your point. Just give us Amanda. Please. \nCheese seems confused. \nPATRICK Cheese, look at me. No one gives    a fuck what you did. I never even liked    Ray. You get the money. The girl goes    home to her mother we'll say we found her   in the bushes or whatever. \nCHEESE I donft know. \nPATRICK Makes you want to have kids. \nThis gets Angle's attention. She looks at him. \nANGIE Does it make you not want to? \nPatrick drinks his beer. \nPATRICK There's a political party in Holland that openly advocates pedophelia and won seats in parliament. In America four hundred thousand kids get abused every year. There are half a million convicted, registered sex offenders, two-thirds of them for molesting children under fourteen, there are a hundred thousand child porn web sites. They busted one in texas had seventy thousand members-- people who gave their credit cards . . . There's a group, the 'Rene Guyon' society, whose motto is 'sex before eight or it's too late.' There's a rise in the victimization of 'pre-verbal' children, for the obvious reason that they can't report their accusers. One in five American girls is sexually abused or victimized before they turn eighteen. But only one third of those every tells anyone in their lifetime that they were abused. She gives him a look: 'oh, really?' \nPATRICK ( CONT ' D) I read that in two minutes on the computer while you were taking a shower. \nANGIE And that tells you you don't want children. \nPATRICK It tells me there aren't enough gas chambers. \nA beat. \nPATRICK (CONT' D) I' d love to have a kid. \nANGIE Yeah? \nPATRICK I'm just not sure a kid would love to be here. \nShe looks sympathetic. \nPATRICK (CONT' D) I don't want to be the guy who fucked this up. \nINT. PATRICK       ANGIE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -MORNING \nPatrick is asleep. Angle is on the far side of the bed. \nThe phone rings. \nANGIE Yeah? \nBRESSANT Guess you did something right. \nANGIE What ? \nBRESSANT Cheese came around. Called in and said he wants to make a drop. Said he left something in your mailbox. \nANGIE Really? \nBRESSANT Well, you're gonna have to check the mailbox yourself, but yeah. \nANGIE Great. \nBRESSANT It is and it isn't. They tape calls coming into the station now. \nANGIE What does that mean? \nBRESSANT It means Jack heard about it, he wants you down here and he's fuckin' pissed. \nANGIE'S APT - MORNING \nEXT. PATRICK    & \nThey walk out the front door and, sure enough, there is an ENVELOPE in the mailbox. But what gets their attention is that jammed into the box, along with the letter is AMANDA'S \nBLANKET. Patrick takes it out, hands it to Angie. They react. \nINT. BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT BUILDING          DAY \nPatrick and Angie follow Devin down the hall. \nPATRICK What are you doing here? \nDEVIN When the boss wants you met, he only sends the best. \nANGIE Or when he wants you brought up the back way. \nDevin smiles. \nDEVIN That, too. \nThey walk through an area with cells in it that looks medieval. They move through another door into a small control room. Then they walk into a lobby. He comes to a stop at Doyle's SECRETARY'S DESK. His SECRETARY, RENE ( 3 0 , attractive) seems to know Devin. \nDEVIN (CONT'D) (re: Doyle's ofice) He in there? \nShe nods. \nRENE Yeah he said just let 'em in. \nDEVIN That's what he said? \nShe doesn't answer.      Devin turns to Patrick and Angie. \nDEVIN (CONT'D) Good luck. \nHe starts back.   They turn to the door and ENTER. \nINT. DOYLE'S OFFICE - DAY \nPatrick and Angie fail at entering unobtrusively. Poole and Bressant are being lectured by Captain Jack Doyle. Doyle turns his attention (for the first time) to Patrick and Angie. \nANGIE Are we rationalizing this? I mean, wouldn't a hundred police up there be better for her than the four of us? Doyle stops. \nDOYLE What does that mean? \nANGIE I'm asking if keeping this quiet is better for Amanda, or is it better for us? \nDoyle is opaque. \nDOYLE Do you have any children, Miss Gennaro? \nShe shakes her head. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) Then you've never lost one. My only child was murdered. She was twelve. You heard about it? \nThe question is rhetorical. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) What you didn't hear, what you don' t know, is what that feels like. \nThere are articles on the wall.   COP FATHER OF SLAIN CHILD \nVOWS: NEVER AGAIN. \nDOYLE ( CONT' D) What I live with? Is knowing my daughter likely died crying out for me to protect her, to come save her. \n(BEAT) And that I never came. \n(BEAT) She died afraid and alone, in a shallow ditch bank, a few feet from the road and not ten minutes from our house. \nSilence. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) I know what it is- to lose my child. He now gets more upset than he usually does delivering this speech. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) God damn it. \n(BEAT) You force my hand and then question the way I handle to it? Question me? \nBRESSANT \n(TO ANGIE) No one's questioning you. He relaxes a little. \nDOYLE I honor my daughter with this, this division, so no parent has to live what I've known . . .Not even a woman like Helene McCready . \n(BEAT) \nTHAT GIRL-- (indicates photo of Amanda) is all I care about. And we're going to bring her home. \nEXT. AERIAL ESTABLISHING QUINCY QUARRY - SUNSET \nFrom the sky, lit by the last slivers of light from a setting sun, we see the Quincy quarry. It has become, in essence, a huge lake, set a hundred or so feet into a rock quarry and surrounded by acres of dense pine. As we travel past the quarry, we see PATRICK'S CAR IN A PARKING LOT. \nSUN JUST SET \nEXT. QUARRY PARKING LOT   - \nThe car idles. Patrick and Angie sit inside. \nANGIE Why is he bringing us all the way up here? \nPATRICK Dark, big, make sure he can get away. \nANGIE No. Something's wrong. \nPATRICK All he wants is the money. He just doesn't want to get arrested doing it. \nANGIE They're gonna kill her. I can feel it. He looks out the window. \nEXT QUARRY TRAIL - NIGHT \nAngie, Patrick, Bressant, & Poole follow up a steep incline. Remy has the BAG OF MONEY. \nPOOLE This asshole could have picked somewhere on level ground. \nBRESSANT Keep the lights off for now. \nANGIE Is this where all the peak rocks have names? \nPATRICK (listing the names of the \nPEAKS ) Running Tierny, Leo, Dan, Gooch, Jigger, Goreski and runnin' Mike. \nPOOLE Where'd they get those fuckin' names? \nPATRICK From the kids who died tryin' to jump off em.. \nEXT. QUARRY TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER \nMore climbing. It starts to get steep. Some stones come loose underfoot and trickle downhill. We see that the quarry rocks are covered in the graffiti left by previous visitors. They walk in silence. \nEXT QUARRY TOP - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER They CREST the hill. The city lights are behind them and we move to reveal the QUARRY WATER below and the edge before them. The path forks in two, opposite directions. \nBRES SANT (to Patrick & Angie) This is where we part ways \nPOOLE \n(SMILES) Divide and conquer. \nANGIE Then she could be alive. She could be hiding. She could be stuck . . . \nPATRICK Yeah but, the one cop told me that two years ago some guy killed his wife and dumped her in there-- the divers found the body . . .but it was so dark they lost it and then they could never find it again. There's so many crags and outcroppings and old cars and shit. \n(BEAT) So don't get your hopes up. \nHe sees she is crying. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) Oh, hey.   It's okay. I know. \nShe bends over, more emotional pain than physical. She curls her knee up to her chin, holds her abdomen, in obvious pain. Patrick climbs into bed with her, wraps her in his arms. \nANGIE I'm sorry. . . I'm sorry. . \nPATRICK Don' t say that. \nANGIE I'm sorry.. . \nPATRICK It's okay. We creep back slowly as the news plays. \nDOYLE (ON TV) . . . every effort to recover her remains so the McCready family can have a proper burial. However this quarry is extremely deep and treacherous. All too often she keeps that which she takes in . . . \nThey cut back to the Anchor desk. \nANCHOR (ON TV) Well, a sad end to that story, Susanne. \nSUSANNE (ON TV) Yes it is, Phil. \nANCHOR (ON TV) Ron is next with Sports. The Bruins in action tonight? \nRON (ON TV) Yes, they are, Phil. The B f s took a crack at the Flyers tonight and the rough stuff started in the first perio-- \nDISSOLVE \nPATRICK (V. ) And like that. She was gone. \nPASSAGE OF TIME SEQUENCE. MUSIC OVER. \nANGIE'S APT - NIGHT \nINT. PATRICK   & \nPatrick gets a beer out of the refrigerator. \nPATRICK (V. 0. ) I tried to catch my balance, but the world kept turning forward. \nANGIE'S APT - NIGHT \nINT. PATRICK   & \nPatrick in the living room. The only light is the television. \nON TV: A MUG SHOT OF CHRIS MULLEN. \nPATRICK (V. ) \nChris' run lasted a day and a half until, from what they could tell, he ran into someone else who wanted the money even more than he did. \nNEWSCASTER # 2 A Dorchester man was gunned down today . . . \nFIELD REPORTER # 7 In the third Dorchester slaying in as many days, 29 year old Chris Mullen was gunned down in an apparent robbery. The Police Commissioner defended the rising tide of crime as a statistical abberation tied to growing umemployment and the humidity of an unusually sweltering summer month. \nINT. SAME - LATER \nPatrick lies on the couch, heavy. The coffee table is piled high with empty beer cans. \nPATRICK (V. ) \nYou couldn't turn on the television without another kid gone and feared whatever. Another horror story. \nNEWSCASTER (ON TV) Missing for four days and Shrewsbury is gripped with fear. After Jimmy Pietro's disappearance, doors are locked and community watch patrols are being formed-- \nINT. BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT BUILDING, 4TH DISTRICT - DAY \nBoxes are being piled and a photo of Doyle is among them. \nNEWSCASTER # 3 A chief under fire. The legendary captain of a unit dedicated to children stepped down today in the aftermath of controversy. \nROAD - DAY \nEXT. TOWNSEND \nDoyle's 'summer cottage.' He pulls up in a Suburban and gets out of the car. The first time we see him in plain-clothes he looks humbled. \nINT. FATHER'S FOUR BAR - MONTAGE \nBressant and Poole drink with Patrick \nPATRICK It's bullshit. He was trying to save her life. \nPOOLE They don't see it that way. \nPATRICK Can he fight it? \nBRESSANT When you gamble, you don't put money on the table if you're gonna cry about losing it. \nBRESSANT It's fucked up, right? \nPATRICK They tell you anything about Nick? \nBRESSANT They say he could be okay. I don't know. \nBressant hands Patrick the bottle. Patrick sits down next to him. There is a beat. He drinks. \nPATRICK How old did they say the kid was? \nBRESSANT Seven. \nPATRICK Second grade. \nBRESSANT You should be proud of yourself. Most men would have stayed outside. \nPATRICK It doesn't matter. \nBRESSANT \n( KNOWING) Yes it does. \nPATRICK I had a priest who always said, \"shame is God's voice telling us where we did wrong. \" \nBRESSANT Fuck him, you did good. \nPATRICK Murder is a sin. \nBRESSANT Depends on who you do it to. \nPATRICK \n(QUIET MATTER-OF-FACT) It don't work like that. It is what it is. Bressant sees Patrick is struggling. \nBRESSANT I planted evidence on a guy once. \n(BEAT) We got a call from our pal Ray Likanski. Back in '95 we were paying a hundred an eight ball to snitches. He couldn't find enough guys to rat out. Anyway, he tells us there's a guy pumpin' out of an apartment in Colombia point. Me and Nick go in-- this was fifteen years ago; when Nicky went in, it was no joke. \n(BEAT) So it's a stash house, the old lady is beat to shit and the husband is mean, cracked out, tries to give us trouble. Nick takes him down. We' re doin' an inventory but it looks like we missed it cause there's no dope in the house. I go in the back room, now this place was a shit-hole, mind you, rats and roaches all over the place, but the kid's room in the back is spotless. He swept it, mopped it. Immaculate. The kid is sitting there, holding on to his Playstation for dear life, no expression, tears streaming down his face. He wants to tell me how he just learned his multiplication tables. \nPATRICK Jesus. \nBRESSANT The father has the kid living in a crack den, subsisting on twinkles and ass- whippings and the kid is still asking me, \"is my daddy all right?\" \n(BEAT) You're worried about what's Christian? Kids forgive, they don't judge, they turn the other cheek. \n(MORE) \nBRESSANT (CONT' D) What do they get for it? \n(BEAT) I went back out and put an ounce of heroin on the living room floor. Sent the father on a ride. Seven to nine. \nPATRICK Think you did the right thing? \nBRESSANT I don't give a fuck. You take a side. You beat a child, you molest a child, you hurt a child -- you ain't on my side. And hope you don't run into me because I will lay you the fuck down. Easy. \nPATRICK Doesn' t feel easy. \nBRESSANT Look, was he better off without the father? Yes. But okay, the kid might be out there, pumpin7 with a gun in his waistband. It's a war. Are we winning? No. (beat, shift) Look, I got a great wife, money saved, hit my 30 in three months, pick up that pension and hail a fucking cab. Go down \nTO FLORIDA-- \nPATRICK 'Cause a bad day in Florida-- \nBRESSANT --Better than a good day anywhere else. They share a small laugh, \nBRESSANT (CONT'D) Would you do it again? Clip Corwin Earle? \nPATRICK No. \nBRESSANT Does that make you right? \nPATRICK I donft know. \nBRESSANT Don't make you wrong t h o u g h , d o e s i t ? \nHe l a u g h s .

Told Mike Snell to fuck himself, put in for a transfer. \nPATRICK To Doyle. \nDEVIN They go back. \nPATRICK Doyle and Remy? \nDEVIN Doyle.brought Remy with him from Louisiana in '72.

They see Lionel approach and head into the bar. \nINT. MURPHY'S LAW - DUSK SETTING IN \n2 TEAMSTERS share a bottle of whiskey at the bar while 3 SECRETARIES chat nearby. A BARTENDER works with a WAITRESS. Near the back door, TWO MEN throw darts. Patrick, Angie and Lionel sit around a table in the middle of the bar. Lionel stares at his hands. \nPATRICK How long you known Remy? \nLIONEL Detective Bressant? \n(LIAR'S PAUSE) Just, in, met him through the investigation of Amanda. \nPATRICK That's it? \nLIONEL Yeah. \nPATRICK How long you known Remy? \nLIONEL What is this? \nPATRICK They have the internet now, Lionel. \nLIONEL (pauses -- looking from one to \nTHE OTHER) You know how it is in town. Everybody knows everybody. \nPATRICK No, Lionel. Everybody don't know everybody. \nLIONEL What are you talkin' about? \nPATRICK Why you lyin' Lionel? \nLIONEL I'm not. \nPATRICK Do you have something to hide? Why can't you tell me? \nBeat. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) When you want to get away with a crime, Lionel it ain't bullshitting your way past ten questions. It's nobody asking the first one. \nPATRICK ALTERNATIVE LINE: \nPATRICK (CONT'D) You came to our house . . . .fuckin' explode. \nLionel puts up his hands. \nLIONEL Fine. Fine. \n(BEAT) I haven't been honest with you. It's just not something I'm proud of, you know? I was in a bar fight, in the day. The other guy cracked his skull. At some point, I musta said, \"I' 11 kill you.\" So they had me up for attempted. My word against the other guy's. A witness testified to my version and the jury believed him. \nPATRICK 'Cause he was a cop. \nLIONEL Yeah.   He testified for me. Angie starts to believe Lionel might be lying. \nANGIE Why didn't you mention that? \nLIONEL I was embarrassed. \nPATRICK Bullshit. You bragged about taking a hard bust the first day we met you. \nLIONEL No I didn't. \nPATRICK So you knew 'Detective Bressant.' \nLIONEL It's not like we were best friends. \nANGIE \n(BUILDING SUSPICION) But you lied. \nPATRICK Why did you call Remy? \nLIONEL He's a cop.. . \nPATRICK And? \nLIONEL \n(GETTING FLUSTERED) The c a s e i s c l o s e d , P a t r i c k .

A MAN 108 WEARING A POPEYE MASK stands just inside the door brandishing a shotgun. \nPOPEYE \n(TO BARTENDER) \nYOU! THE SAFE . . . NOW! (pointing with his gun) Right under there. \nThe bartender does as he's told -- sliding open a door beneath the bar to reveal a safe. \nPOPEYE (CONT'D) Everyone needs to shut up. I'll be done in two minutes. (to the dart players) You get down on the floor. Hands behind your head! Just relax. \nA woman starts to panic. \nWOMAN AT BAR Oh, god, no. \nPOPEYE This will all be over in a minute if everyone stays calm. \nTEAMSTER Do you know who's bar this is, shit-head? \nPopeye CRACKS the teamster in the jaw with the butt of his shotgun. \nPOPEYE Or you can get wise. It's up to you. The bartender places a STACK OF BILLS on the bar -- 2 or 3 grand. Popeye throws a DUFFLE BAG at him and he fills it. \nDART PLAYER We got families. \nPOPEYE Pipe down. \nHe turns to Lionel. \nPOPEYE (CONT'D) What did you say?! \nNobody said anything. \nPOPEYE (CONT' D) Another smart guy? \nThe bar is silent. \nPOPEYE (CONT'D) \n(TO LIONEL) You1re a talker, huh? Keep yapping motherfucker. \nWOMAN AT BAR Stop antagonizing him! He has a gun. \nPOPEYE \n(TO LIONEL) You want to keep talking trash? Okay. \nDART PLAYER \nSHUT UP! Even though Lionel has said nothing, every witness at the bar would remember it this way. That Lionel had been talking and he had been killed. Popeye SNAPS THE ROUND INTO THE CHAMBER WITH ONE HAND. \nHE CRANES HIS NECK \nOn Patrick, this rings a bell. From the Tretts. . . Popeye is Bressant. Bressant levels the shotgun at Lionel. \nPOPEYE \n(TO LIONEL) Close your eyes, Mouth. Close 'em tight. \nLIONEL You don't have to do this \nPATRICK \nREMY BRESSANT. \nBressant looks at him, then sticks the shotgun between Lionel' s eyes. \nLIONEL (his eyes shut) Wait. Jesus. \nPATRICK Amanda McCready was taken by Remy Bressant ! \nBRESSANT Don't say that fucking name! \nLIONEL I already told him we did it for ransom. I told him we did it for ransom! Remy . . . Please. Ill. \nBRESSANT Fuck. . . His heart isn't in it. He begins to lower his gun \nBANG! BANG! TWO SHOTS HIT Bressant. He takes a beat to register this, standing stock-still. The Bartender is standing there with a smoking gun, in shock. Patrick leaps out of his chair and drives his head into Bressant's stomach. Wrapping his arms around his waist, he plows his spine straight back into the bar. \nBressant cracks the shotgun stock down onto the back of Patrick's neck, buckling his knees and crashing him to the floor. He SCRAMBLES OUT the front door. Patrick gets to his feet and looks around. Angie is okay. Patrick turns and RACES out the front door after Bressant. Angie goes to Lionel's side. \nSECRETARY Call 911! Call 911! \nEXT STREET - CONTINUOUS Patrick looks up and down the street, but Bressant is nowhere to be seen. He sees a BLOODY POPEYE MASK on the ground. A TRAIL OF BLOOD runs away from it which Patrick follows across the street. The thickening trail leads Patrick along the side of a LARGE 3-STORY FACTORY (in the process of being converted to lofts) and to a DOOR near the back. Blood is smeared on the door and a small red puddle has formed on the ground. \nINT FACTORY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS Leading with his gun, Patrick steps into a bright STAIRWELL. Blood tracks up the stairs and Patrick ascends cautiously. He climbs one flight. And then another -- pausing on the landing. Above him, light comes through an OPEN DOOR. He starts for it. Patrick continues up the last few steps. He reaches the top and peers out onto: \nEXT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS Patrick scans the roof for Remy. He sees nothing on his right and turns around to his left, circling the stairwell. Behind him we see a magnificent view of the neighborhood. He turns another corner to see: \nBressant sits against an aluminum vent - - his head leaned back and his eyes half closed. A ROSE OF BLOOD spreads out against Bressant's shirt. His flesh is beginning to grey. \nPatrick holds his gun on him and calls out. \nPATRICK Put the fuckin' gun down!            Put it down. \nThe Police look at him. \nPATRICK (CONT' D) Look, I've cooperated. Unless you want me to go out there and start calling the papers to give 'em my Police corruption exclusive, I'm leaving. \nHe gets up. \nCAPTAIN Calm down. \n(BEAT) You're released. But Mr. Kenize-- \n(WINKS) I hope you don't get pulled over any time soon. \nINT. PATRICK AND ANGIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPatrick comes into the office/living room. Angie is there. \nANGIE What happened? \nPATRICK They kept my shoelaces. \nShe smiles. \nANGIE We'll go down to Zayre's tomorrow and get you some new ones. \nPATRICK I don't want to do that tomorrow. \nANGIE What do you want to do? \nPATRICK Take a trip. \nEXT MASS TURNPIKE - DAY The car speeds along the empty highway, carving through thick forests of pine trees. Inside the car it's quiet. Patrick's stare is fixed to the road -- the rhythm of the white lines that pulse by. Angie rests her head against the passenger window, the BLUR of the tree-line reflected in her eyes. \nEXT . RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY A 2-LANE ROAD winds them through rolling hills and past a SIGN welcoming them to: 'WEST BECKETT, MA. Pop. 974' -- a Rockwell painting in the heart of the Berkshire Mountains. \nEXT TOWNSEND ROAD - MOMENTS LATER The car rolls down a quiet road where small COTTAGES nestle in clumps of birch and pine trees. Patrick parks opposite a long driveway. A MAILBOX at its mouth reads: DOYLE \nROAD - AFTERNOON \nEXT. TOWNSEND \nPatrick and Angie sit in the car.   They look down a driveway. \nShe takes a beat. \nANGIE You want to tell me where our trip has taken us? \nPATRICK You know where we are. \nANGIE \n(BEAT) He would never, ever do something to endanger a child. \nPATRICK Are you sure? \nANGIE Yes. \nPATRICK He was a part of it. They don't tape calls. He handed us a transcript like it was evidence and he knew it was a forgery- -maybe he forged it himself. He knew what they were doing, he supported it and he covered it up. \nANGIE Why? For a third of a hundred and thirty grand? What for? \nHe just looks at her. \nPATRICK Had to be for something. \nANGIE When you're talking about ruining an old man who lost his child and gave years of service . . . \"something\" isn't enough. \nPATRICK For a guy who tried to ruin us, something' s plenty. \nANGIE This is the kind of thing where if you do it, you want to be sure. \n(BEAT) Are you sure? \nPATRICK No. \n(BEAT) Are you coming? \nANGIE No. \nAnd he goes down the road. \nEXT DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nThey start down the driveway towards a small, red cottage set a hundred yards or so off the road. But after only a few steps, they stop. PATRICK & ANGIE'S POV: Through the trees, Doyle emerges from the cottage. He carries 2 FULL SUITCASES to a SUBURBAN and loads them in the back. His wife, FRANCINE, follows. Patrick & Angie take a beat before resuming down the drive. Only to FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS at the sight of: \nAMANDA MCCREADY CHARGING ONTO THE PORCH, clutching a BACK- PACK, and wearing a look of utter determination. \nAMANDA Don't forget mine, gramma. \nFRANCINE I'd never forget yours, sweetheart. Doyle lifts Amanda off the porch and carries her to the Suburban. He dips down, allowing Amanda to place her back- pack inside. \nAMANDA Can I have a, please a sandwich? \nDOYLE What kind do you want. \nAMANDA Grill Cheese. \nDOYLE Patrick Kenzie. To what do I owe the pleasure? \nHe holds Doyle's look. \nPATRICK Remy Bressant died last night. \nDOYLE I was told. It's a shame. \nPATRICK Hard to understand.    He seemed like a good man. \nDOYLE He was a good man. You don't know why people do what they do. Only they see out their own windows. With that, AMANDA walks out the door, running to Jack and clinging to his leg. Jack holds Patrick's look. \nAMANDA Papapa.    Come make sandwiches now please. \nDoyle smiles, giving away nothing of his tension with Patrick. Francine comes to the door. \nDOYLE \n(TO FRANCINE) It's all right. \n(TO AMANDA) Go inside, my sweet. I'll be there soon and make you a sandwich. Francine hesitates.    Doyle is gentle. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) I'm all right. Francine takes her back inside. \nA beat.   Doyle smiles. \nDOYLE (CONT'D) So you know. Good for you. You uncovered the thing men died for. \nPATRICK Men killed for. \nDOYLE I'm giving that little girl a life. \nPATRICK It's not your life to give. Helene is her mother. You think she's a bad mother you should have gone to social services. Short of that, it's her mother, it's where she belongs. \nDOYLE Turn around, get back in your car and wait thirty years. You don't know what the world is made of yet. \nPATRICK I know I'm tired of being lied to   and tired of being lectured by a gang   of criminals. I'm calling the State    Police in five minutes. They'll be here    in ten. \nDOYLE No. \n(BEAT) You haven't made that call because you think it might be an irreparable mistake. Because part of you believes it doesn't matter what the rules say. Because you know, when the lights go out and it's just you and your conscience you ask yourself if she's better here or better there, you know the answer and you always will. \nPATRICK See you at the arraignment. \nDOYLE You can do one good pure thing here today. One right thing. Most men don't get that chance in a lifetime. \n(BEAT) You walk away from that, you may not regret it when you get home, or in a year but I promise you, get to where I am, you will. But I'll be dead by then, you'll be old, and she'll be trailing a ragged, tattered childhood of her own -- and you'll be the one who has to tell them you' re sorry. \nPATRICK Then I guess I will. I'll tell them I'm sorry and I'll live with it. And maybe that will happen, what I'm not gonna do, is have to apologize to a grown woman who says, why did you leave me? I got kidnapped, my aunt hired you to find me, and you did. You found me with a strange family but you broke your promise and you left me there. Why? Why didn't you bring me home? \n(MORE) \nPATRICK (CONT' D) It don't matter how many outfits and snacks and family trips we took-- they weren't my family, they stole me and I was raised as a stranger to myself and the life I would have had. You knew about it, you knew better and you did nothing. And maybe that grown woman will forgive me but I won't forgive myself. \nSilence . . . It hangs in the air. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) The only thing I care about is that little girl. And I'm gonna bring her home. Doyle hears this. Has his reaction, something like a sagging, an emptiness, and a resolution. \nDOYLE \nI STILL Then you'll have to excuse me. have a sandwich left to make. \nHe turns and walks inside. \nSAME - LATER Patrick watches from down the road. Doyle is on the porch. Jack sits in his favorite chair. Amanda is on his    lap, facing him, arms around his shoulders, head tucked   into his neck. He slowly rocks the chair. He holds Amanda     like its the last hug of his life. His eyes are fixed on a    point somewhere far off in the distance. \nPatrick takes out his phone. \nIn the distance sirens wail faintly, getting louder. Just inside the door is Amanda's colorful kids back-pack, a strange and cute stuffed snake, and Francine's bag spilling over with zip-locked snacks and children's cups-- all the stuff Francine had packed to make sure Amanda would have, whereever she'd go. Over this all, beginning faintly and growing increasingly audible, is the inanity of the television news. It's blather like a merciless blanket of idiocy over something hopelessly sad. A swarm of West Beckett POLICE CRUISERS cram the small road. A Deputy knocks on the door. Doyle answers. He knows the local cops' who are embarrassed to arrest him. He makes it easy for them. Doyle nods at the deputy with quiet acceptance and the dignity of a man at peace with the choices h e r s made. The DEPUTY puts a hand-cuffed Doyle into the back of his car. \nFrancine Doyle silently mouthing! \"oh my God' oh my God.\" Angie looks out from the car' past the policef past everything. They move to Francine to put her in a police car. Amandal being taken from Francine' cries and reaches out to her. She screams. Francine is handcuffed. Patrick tries to hold his look. Patrick stands with a GROUP OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. He looks to Angie . . . She doesn' t look back. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT HELENE'S APARTMENT - EVENING The crush of media has descended outside the apartment for footage of the joyous reunion. Helene is made up. She waits on the curb as the POLICE CAR arrives. Out gets a FEMALE OFFICERr holding Amandar who is terrified by the rapacious mob of REPORTERS AND PHOTOGWPHERS. Amanda's  fear of the throng causes her to cling to Helenel giving the photographers the shot they want. Patrick watches from his car' parked up the block. He is alone. \nADDITIONAL STREET MONTAGE IMAGES FEATURING PATRICK He is in the neighborhood. \nEXT. CITY STRETT - SUNSET \nPatrick drives.

The place feels less warm. More bare. A voice from the doorway turns him around. It's Angie. \nANGIE Sorryr I had to come back and get some stuff. \nPATRICK It's okay. She looks at himl almost sympathetic. \nPATRICK ( CONT ' D) Can we at least talk? \nANGIE There's nothing to say \n", "test1_input": "There are FIFTEEN CATS wandering around the house, meowing. \nBRESSANT (CONTFD) They tortured him. \nPOOLE Looks like he held out pretty long. \nPATRICK He didn' t have it. \nPOOLE Huh? \nPATRICK He couldn't tell them where it was 'cause he didn't know. Helene hid it. \nBressant chuckles. \nBRESSANT Ray made poor relationship choices. \nPATRICK (re: Ray's body) Guess they didn't believe him. \nPOOLE Poor prick. \nHELENE (0.3.) \n(ENTERING) I'm not waitin' in the fuckin' car-- \nShe sees Ray and holds her hand to her mouth. It's unclear whether she is about to cry or vomit. Whichever it is, she runs out into the backyard to do it. \nPatrick goes after her. \nEXT. RAY'S BACK YARD --MOMENTS LATER \nHelene's make-up is a mess. Patrick stands next to her. \nPATRICK It's okay . . . \nHELENE I just want my daughter home with me. \nPATRICK Did Cheese know you were on the ride with Ray? \nHELENE I think so. \nPATRICK Okay . . . Where's the money, Helene? Poole and Bressant emerge from the house. \nHELENE Right here. \nPATRICK Where? \nHELENE I buried it when Ray was passed out. \nEXT. RAY'S BACK YARD - LATER \nCLOSE ON: A BAG IN A FRESHLY DUG HOLE IN THE DIRT. \nPOOLE What was that book about 'everything you need is in your own backyard?' It's a French book. \nHe pulls a DUFFEL BAG from the ground. He opens it to reveal \nNINETY FIVE THOUSAND IN CASH. \nBRESSANT That wasn't a book. It was a cartoon Helene knows. \nHELENE Fuck you. \nANGIE So, you bring in the FBI at this point? \nBRESSANT That's the worst thing we could do. \nANGIE Why is that? \nBRESSANT 'Cause I don't want Cheese to open a bag full of newspaper and kill Amanda. \nANGIE It ' s kidnapping. \nBRESSANT I don't see a note. (turns To Poole) You see a note? \nPOOLE Nope. \nBRESSANT We're investigating a missing children's case. Has nothing to do with kidnapping. He turns to Patrick and Angie. \nBRESSANT (CONT' D) Fastest way Amanda gets home is we go to him, swap the money for her and walk away. \nPOOLE So everyone keep their mouths shut. \n(BEAT) Helene. \nHELENE (to Patrick, looking for help) Do you know Cheese? \nPATRICK When we were ten. He hardly spoke English. His brother Jude was a sweet kid. \n(BEAT) Cheese went another way. \nHELENE He wouldn't hurt her, right? \nPOOLE \n(INDICATES HOUSE) Ask Ray. \n", "test1_true": "(TO HELENE) You know how he got his name? \nHELENE No. \nANGIE He moved here when I did. There was a lot of tension between black American kids and Haitians-and he got it the worst.He had no running water at home. This one girl was on him real hard 'cause he smelled bad, calling him 'cheese.' All of a sudden, he breaks a bottle, holds her down, and carves the word Cheese in her face. She lost an eye. Someone found it on the sidewalk the next day. \nPATRICK And the name stuck. \nANGIE But I'm sure Amanda will be fine. \nBRESSANT Just keep your mouth shut, okay? We can get her back. It'll be fine. I have no fear of this idiot. \nHELENE \n(TO BRESSANT) You're gonna talk to him? \nBRESSANT That's the next step, yeah. \nHELENE Tell him I'm sorry. Tell him I apologize. \nPOOLE Sorry goes a long way. \nHELENE (sniffles, remembering fondly) She's a handful, that one. At least I know she's giving them hell. They react to this woman's feeble grip on reality. \nPATRICK What about Ray? \nBRESSANT You know what percentage of murders were solved last year in Boston? Twenty nine. Less in Chelsea. \nPOOLE Take her home. We'll handle Chelsea. They move to go. \nHELENE I'm hungry. \nPATRICK We' 11 get you some food. \nHELENE No, her. That's the last thing she said to me before I put her to bed. She said, 'Ifm hungry.\" I mean, they fed her, right? She's not still hungry? \nPATRICK I donft know. \nEXT.

It's Leon Trett: DEAD. Patrick momentarily pauses to examine Leon. \nBOOM A GUNSHOT explodes and a SLUG rips into the wall above Patrick's head, showering him in plaster. Looking up, he sees Roberta Trett at the far end of the hall gripping her revolver. \nBOOM BOOM, two more shots bury into the wall. \nROBERTA \n(ENRAGED) \nGET AWAY FROM HIM!

JACK Are there any questions? (looks around) Mr. McEvoy. 
MCEVOY (smiles) No, I have no questions. 
JACK Judge? 
JUDGE A few... but it will hold. 
STANTON I have a question. 
WILLIE Shoot. 
STANTON A lot of people in this state have been saying that you've been making deals... some of them with the very groups that you claim you're against. Is that true? 
JACK Adam, you know how rumors start... 
WILLIE Yes. Yes, that's true. I have nothing to hide. I'll make a deal with the devil if it'll help me carry out my program. But believe me, there are no strings attached to those deals. 
STANTON You're sure about that? 
WILLIE Doc, Jack here has been telling me how you feel about things... how you'd like to see a new hospital built, a hospital that's the biggest and best that money can buy. You want those things, Doc, because, well, because you're a man who wants to do good. Now, I'd like to ask you a question. 
STANTON Shoot. 
The guests laugh good-naturedly. 
WILLIE Do you know what good comes out of? 
STANTON You tell me, Mr. Stark. 
WILLIE Out of bad... that's what good comes out of. Because you can't make it out of anything else. You didn't know that, did you? 
STANTON No, I didn't... There's another question I'd like to ask you. You say there's only bad to start with and the good must come with the bad. Who's to determine what's good and what's bad?... You? 
WILLIE Why not? 
STANTON How? 
WILLIE Why, that's easy. Just... just make it up as you go along. 
More laughter. Willie smiles and goes on. 
WILLIE Folks, there's a time to talk and there's a time to act. I think the time to act is right now. And with your support, I not only will win but I will do all of the things I promised. I need your help. Oh, I need it badly. But I'm not going to beg for it. In the name of this state which we love... in the name of the governor in whose house we meet... I demand it. 
There is immediate applause. Anne is the first to rush over and shake Willie's hand. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Exterior: Stanton Home, Night 
The last of the guests are leaving. Jack and Willie remain with the Judge, Anne, and Adam. 
WILLIE (to Judge) Well, what do you say, sir? 
JACK You've got to say yes. With you in the race... 
JUDGE I'm an old bird... I... 
WILLIE But a game one. 
They laugh. 
WILLIE Look, I'll give you complete power as attorney general. You can do anything you see fit. I'll swing the ax to clear the way for you. Is that a deal? 
The Judge smiles, then puts out his hand. 
JUDGE It's a deal. 
They shake hands. 
WILLIE Jack, we have to get back to town... a lot to do. (shakes hands with Adam) Dr. Stanton. 
Jack kisses Anne on the cheek. Anne comes over and shakes Willie's hand. 
ANNE I'm very glad to have met you.

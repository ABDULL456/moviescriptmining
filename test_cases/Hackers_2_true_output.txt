The name rings no bells with Dade. 
PHREAK The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I know you play the game. 
Another kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up to Dade and The Phantom Phreak. 
JOEY Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta... 
PHREAK (slaps Joey) Joey, Joey... 
JOEY What? whatwhatwhat? 
PHREAK One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! (To Dade): Check it... 
Phreak starts to hand Dade a flyer. 
JOEY (interrupting) I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle. 
PHREAK You know, you're right about that. (to Dade) Check it, Friday. 
Phreak hands Dade a flyer for Cyberdelia. 
JOEY Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh? 
PHREAK You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless. 
Phreak walks away. 
JOEY Ultra Laser. (desperate) Doctor Doom! 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET VILLAGE. NIGHT. 
Dade rolls in on rollerblades.  Street vendors hawk computer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music vendor catches Dade's attention. 
CEREAL Check this out, each and every one of you. Compilation tape, of my own making. I call this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring artists like, well I got some Hendrix on there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all great artists that asphyxiated on their own vomit! 
The small crowd around him finally gets the joke. 
CEREAL Can't get this in stores, man, I made it! 
Dade wheels into Cyberdelia, which just happens to be equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the benefit of skaters. The place pounds with loud, bassy techno music and coloured light. Video monitors with psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. There is a video game with a huge screen.  Phreak is at a pay phone. 
OPERATOR (on phone) Please deposit five dollars for the first minute. 
Phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a button, and the box emits a series of tones. 
OPERATOR Thank you. 
PHREAK Nonono, thank YOU! 
Dade checks out the scene. Kate is playing the big video game. Dade skates up to her. She loses her last man. She's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the top-10 list. 
DADE That's a nice score for a girl. 
KATE (irritated by Dade's presence) Think you can do better? 
DADE I'll give it a shot. 
Kate yields the controls to Dade, who begins playing. Kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet above.

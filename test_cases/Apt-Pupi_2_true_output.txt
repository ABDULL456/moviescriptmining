TODD I don't need money.  You don't have any anyway.  At least, I don't think so.  You probably had to spend it all to sneak in the country.  A good American passport is expensive on the black market, that I know. 
DUSSANDER Do you?  Good for you. 
TODD Yes, I do.  I know it all, Dussander.  You're my One Great Interest.

DAPHNE Easy, put the phone down. 
EASY Why don't you try screaming again? 'Cause I bet police like white women with Negro boyfriends who hijack trucks... 
DAPHNE Easy, please. 
She reaches for the phone and he pushes her away. 
EASY I bet they like pimps, and whores, too, who scam rich white men like Carter runnin' for mayor. 
DAPHNE Easy, please, put it down... 
EASY And I'm sure they like it when these white girls tell their colored men to lay low 'cause they killed a woman over some pictures of another rich white man. 
She gathers herself, just as: 
OPERATOR'S VOICE Number please... 
DAPHNE (soberly) Frank is my brother. 
Easy is about to speak, but then stands still. 
OPERATOR'S VOICE Number please? 
He hangs up. 
105   CONTINUED:   (4)                                              105 
She looks away, worn out, tired. 
DAPHNE We have different fathers. Mine is white... Frank doesn't even know that Todd and I broke up. So far I've kept him out of all this. 
She gets up and takes Easy's cigarettes and taps one out. 
DAPHNE See, Coretta's the only one out here in L.A. besides my brother who knew about me... (she lights up) And about a month ago she took a job working for, of all people, Matthew Teran. She made friends with one of the girls in the office who told her that she'd heard that Teran was a pedophile. And Coretta got carried away and told her that Todd Carter was engaged to a colored woman. She was sorry and didn't think it would get to Teran... but it did and he got a hold of my birth records. 
EASY Who killed her, Daphne? 
Daphne exhales smoke and brushes hair out of her face ignoring the question. 
DAPHNE (continuing) Todd and I broke up and I paid a guy for the pictures of Teran. But somehow Coretta got them. 
EASY Who killed her? 
DAPHNE It was an accident. Coretta and I were still mad at each other. I mean, she threatened to sell Teran the pictures. 
EASY Who killed her goddammit!? 
105   CONTINUED:   (5)                                               105 
DAPHNE I just asked Joppy to go over and put a scare in her... It was an accident. 
FLASHBACK: 
106   INT. KITCHEN - CORETTA'S HOUSE                                 106 
Joppy points a finger in Coretta's face, backing her against the counter. She grabs a knife from a rack of dishes left out to dry. 
DAPHNE (V.O.) Joppy said she pulled a knife and tried to dump hot water on him... 
She swipes at Joppy and he backhands her against the stove... She struggles to grab a pot of boiling water, but he wrests it from her and slings her across the room against the counter, her head striking the tile on the way down. 
107   BACK TO SCENE                                                  107 
Daphne looks down at her hands. 
She stubs out her cigarette and sits on the bed. 
DAPHNE God, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... It's just that with the pictures I can-- 
EASY What? Marry Carter?   Be white again? 
DAPHNE Don't judge me, Easy! Do you think I like pretending that I'm someone else? Do you know how I've been treated by people, colored and white, when I've tried to live as a colored woman in a colored community. Do you have any idea what any colored man whose ever been with me has had to go through? Don't you dare judge me! 
She sees Easy hesitate and she stands up. 
DAPHNE (continuing) Come on, Easy. Help me. 
107   CONTINUED:                                                     107 
She moves in close, caressing. 
DAPHNE (continuing) Come on, you know it's the right thing to do... You know if things were different what would happen between us. 
EASY I'll tell you what can happen between us. You get Carter to clear me up from all this and you can have your pictures. That's all that could have ever happened between us. 
DAPHNE (genuinely hurt) Sure, baby. Of course, sweetheart... 
The sound of the front door pushing open startles them, and Albright knocks on his way in. 
ALBRIGHT Well I'll be damned. You found her. 
And Manny and Shariff step in, too, carrying baseball bats.

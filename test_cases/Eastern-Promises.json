{"train": "EASTERN PROMISES \nWritten by \nSteven Knight \n1   EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1 \nIt's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain. A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional barber's shop called Ozim's. \n2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2 \nThe shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk) is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA). Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit beneath the barber's gown. \nDuring the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands. \nOzim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks with a Russian accent. \nOZIM Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody kids, you know... he says - `but Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas! We're Islam! \nSOYKA Oi, how much are you taking off? \nOZIM Christmas! So I said to him... alisverise cimac. The kid's sixteen... \nOzim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'. \nOZIM (CONT'D) They don't want to work do they. Shicma.... \nEKREM (hesitantly interrupting) Uncle Ozim....... \nWe see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear as well as cold. \n(CONTINUED) WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                               2. \n2   CONTINUED:                                                         2 \nOZIM This is him.     The kid I'm talking about. \nEkrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem in the mirror. \nSOYKA He looks OK to me... how you doin' Ekrem? \nSoyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it as if it were enchanted... \nOZIM He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do one lousy thing for me. Here, look... Ekrem, take this... \nOzim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally terrified. \nEKREM Ozim... memnum etmek. \nOZIM We had a deal now he's backing out. \nSOYKA (laughing) Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone. It's obviously a psychological thing... \nOZIM Take it Ekrem. \nSOYKA Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave. \nOZIM This is the kid who walks around like Al Capone. Take the fucking ustura and finish this Rushca. \nSOYKA (startled) What? \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                              3. \n2   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 2 \nSoyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream bubbles in the blood. \n3   EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT                                 3 \nWe dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA) hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop. She is barefoot. \n4   INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT                                    4 \nThe CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER. Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the customer react to her ragged appearance. \nTATIANA (Russian accent) Please... I have... \nCHEMIST For methadone I need to see paper prescription. \nThe customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then faints onto the floor. \n5   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT                5 \nWe see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley. \nKirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the restaurant. \n14   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                              14 \nAs Nikolai drives away, Anna rings the doorbell beside the front door. There is no reply. She is about to ring again when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his late sixties. He is wiping his hands on a tea towel, dressed in a spotlessly white apron. He has the sparkling piercing eyes of a falcon. \nSEMYON We are closed. \nANNA I know. \nShe fumbles in her bag. \nANNA (CONT'D) Sorry... I'm a midwife. \nAnna produces her hospital ID and shows it to Semyon. \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                             13. \n14   CONTINUED:                                                     14 \nSEMYON (with a twinkle) Then unless one of my daughters is keeping something from me, you have the wrong address. \nANNA I'd like to speak to the Manager. \nSemyon studies the name on the ID. \nSEMYON Khitrova? \nANNA My dad was Russian. \nSemyon seems suddenly delighted. \nSEMYON And his name? \nANNA Ivan. \nSEMYON So, you are Anna Ivanovna. \n15   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                           15 \nThe tables are set for a huge party. Kirill is now on step ladders, fixing some Christmas decorations. Other relatives are getting the place ready. Semyon hurries through the restaurant, leading Anna by the hand. \nSEMYON We must hurry. I must stir. Stir, stir or the gravy dies in my hands. Today it is family. Here is my son, Kirill. (he hisses at Kirill) Kirill! The berries are too low, too low. And Roman, more glasses for red! (he claps his hands) Come on! \nKirill follows Anna's progress through the restaurant with a glare. \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision   -   11/4/06                           13A. \n15   CONTINUED:                                                   15 \nThere are three little girls in extravagant party frocks, all holding violins and giggling near to the door that \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                              14. \n15   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  15 \nleads to the kitchen. Semyon stops when he reaches them and puts his hands on his hips. \nSEMYON (CONT'D) My angels. You should be practising. You must make the wood cry. Like this, like this... \nSemyon grabs a violin and plays a three-second burst of sad Russian violin music. \nSEMYON (CONT'D) You see... \nSemyon hurries on into the kitchen.    Anna smiles, delighted at the eccentric old man. \n16   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY                   16 \nInside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam, smoke. Family members, some dressed in their party outfits, others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots, laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all, overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas kitchen. Semyon calls out to everyone. \nSEMYON Come, come, hurry, hurry.    They will be here any moment. (to Anna) Ok, show me this card. \nAnna reaches into her pocket and produces the `Trans- Siberian' business card she found in Tatiana's bag. Semyon angles his head to look as he stirs. \nSEMYON (CONT'D) It is the old card. From before the renovations. But even so, if she had worked here I would remember the name. Perhaps she ate here once. Try this. \nSemyon offers Anna a spoonful of his gravy.    She sips it. \nANNA God, that's amazing. My dad made gravy just like that. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                             15. \n16   CONTINUED:                                                      16 \nSemyon shrugs and smiles, his eyes twinkling, then goes back to stirring. He speaks as if unconcerned. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision      -   11/12/06                              18. \n19   CONTINUED:                                                         19 \nKIRILL OK.     Merry Christmas.   Drive safely. \nOzim giggles.      Anna departs. \n20   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                               20 \nAnna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with their children are emerging from their cars. The women are all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking, still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's bike. \nNIKOLAI (in Russian) Nice bike. \nANNA What? \nNIKOLAI Nice bike. \nANNA Thank you. \nNIKOLAI A Ural. You don't see them anymore. \nANNA It was my dad's. \nNIKOLAI How much do you want for it? \nAnna has already taken a dislike to this man. He is arrogant and looks potentially violent. His shades, suit and tattoos say it all. \nANNA (irritated) It has sentimental value. \nNikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                             18A. \n20   CONTINUED:                                                       20 \nNIKOLAI `Sentimental value'.   I've heard of that. \nAnna puts her helmet on. \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                             19. \n20   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 20 \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) You're not staying for the party? \nANNA No. \nNIKOLAI Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get invited. You want to go for a drink instead? \nAnna mounts her bike. \nANNA It's Christmas. Everything's closed. \nNikolai smiles. \nNIKOLAI Sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know? \nAnna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first time. She rides away. Nikolai watches her go and then stubs his cigarette. \n21   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                        21 \nSudden silence... perhaps the ticking of a clock. This is Anna's Christmas dinner, a total contrast to the chaos of the restaurant. Stepan is attempting to carve the chicken. \nSTEPAN Anna, how come is it that your boyfriend isn't here to carve? \nStepan takes a large sip of vodka. \nANNA I don't live with Oliver any more, Uncle Stepan. I'm living back here for a bit. \nHELEN (softly) For as long as you want. \nSTEPAN I knew he would run away from you. \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                              20. \n21   CONTINUED:                                                      21 \nANNA He didn't run away.

I am allowed to be honest? \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD Revision    -   11/27/06                       22A. \n23   CONTINUED:                                                      23 \nKIRILL (CONT'D) (pause) No, not the beach. It's an English expression, you fucking baboon. I mean... (hissing out of ear shot) ...there are no police. You sure? Good. \nKirill glances over at Semyon, who is apparently lost amongst a sea of children, but we see from the corner of his eye he is watching Kirill. \n(CONTINUED) GREEN Revision   -   11/24/06                            23. \n23   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 23 \nKIRILL (CONT'D) (to phone) No, my dad's not involved. I'm a big boy now. I do my own stuff. Yeah. Merry Christmas. \nKirill cuts the call and nods to Ozim, who stubs his cigar. Semyon notices their silent communication, then turns to one of the violin-playing angels, smiles, and kisses her on both cheeks. \n24   OMITTED                                                        24 \n25   EXT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - NIGHT                                25 \nWe see the car pull up sharply outside Ozim's barber's shop. Nikolai jumps out and opens the door for Ozim. \n26   OMITTED                                                        26 \nThe three men walk to the door beside the barber shop. Ozim takes a bunch of keys out and prepares to open the door to the upstairs. He stops. \nOZIM The driver stays down here. \nKirill smiles and shakes his head. \nKIRILL You really think I do this kind of thing? \nKirill puts his hand on Nikolai's shoulder \nKIRILL (CONT'D) This guy's not a driver. He's an undertaker. \nOzim looks at Nikolai, highly dubious. BLUE Revision   -   11/4/06                               24. \n27   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. UPSTAIRS ROOMS - NIGHT                 27 \nThe rooms above Ozim's shop have been converted into a drinking club. Ozim leads Nikolai and Kirill through the debris of the night before. As they walk through, Ekrem suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell. Kirill and Nikolai both react with instinctive aggression. \nOZIM Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun, durgun. \nEKREM I got tickets, Ozim. It's with Chelsea. They said there was no tickets but I got tickets for the Chelsea game. \nOZIM OK, OK, OK.    You go and watch a DVD, yeah? \nEkrem nods and hugs Ozim. We realize he is slightly deranged. Finally he lets Ozim go and leaves. Kirill watches him go. \nKIRILL He knows to say he hasn't seen us, right Ozim? \nOzim finds the key to the kitchen. \nOZIM He don't know anything.    He's touched by the angels. \nOzim opens the kitchen door. \n28   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT                        28 \nInside the kitchen there are carcasses of lambs hanging from meat hooks. There are knives and skewers around the place. Ozim stops and locks the kitchen door behind them. \n29   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT                        29 \nThe freezer door opens and Ozim gestures towards a large package bound up in black bin liners which are dusted with frost. Kirill nods to Nikolai who grabs the package and hauls it out onto the kitchen floor. Kirill tears a hole in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka. \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision     -   11/4/06                                 25. \n29   CONTINUED:                                                          29 \nKirill studies the face and nods. \nKIRILL That's him. \nKirill crosses himself. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) There was a time when he was like a brother to me. \nHe puts his hand on his heart with mock solemnity. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) Now he looks like a fucking ice cream. \nKirill giggles. \nOZIM (softly) Hey, hey, show some respect for a dead man. \nThere is a knock at the door and Semyon looks up sharply. His eyes glisten. He puts his novel aside. \n34   INT./EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. DOOR - NIGHT              34 \nSemyon is unlocking the door and discovering, in the drizzle and half light, that it is Anna. \nSEMYON Ah. My dear! I wasn't expecting you so early. \nANNA Is it OK? \n35   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         35 \nSemyon and Anna are sitting down at the candlelit table. Anna fumbles in her bag and produces a sheaf of photocopied sheets. She has photocopied the pages of the diary and they are laid out in segments on each page. \nANNA I copied the whole thing. \nSemyon takes the pages and looks troubled. \nSEMYON Where is the original? \n(CONTINUED) WHITE Revision    -     9/12/06                            29. \n35   CONTINUED:                                                       35 \nANNA I'm going to keep it. Maybe give it to Tatiana's daughter someday. \nSemyon looks thwarted but hides it well. He studies the photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles. \nSEMYON I will need my spectacles and a clear head. Today I broke my rules and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate it. \nHe folds the papers carefully. \nSEMYON (CONT'D) Then I will bring what I have done to your home. Where do you live, Anna? \nThere is nothing in Semyon's smile to cause alarm but Anna perhaps remembers Nikolai. Finally... \nANNA Not far.    I can drop by and pick it up. \nSEMYON Then maybe I can drive you home. \nANNA I'm fine.    I'm on my motorbike. \nSemyon stares at her for a moment. \nSEMYON So what will happen to the poor child? \nANNA After Christmas, they'll do a missing persons report. \nSEMYON Who will? \nANNA The police. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                           30. \n35   CONTINUED: (2)                                                35 \nSemyon doesn't blink. At that moment a little girl of seven (MARIA) emerges from the darkness, carrying a soft toy. \nMARIA Grandpa. \nSEMYON Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed. \nMARIA I'm too sad. Next Christmas isn't for another hundreds and hundreds of days. \nSemyon takes her onto his knee. As he does, we see, for the first time, an eagle tattoo on his wrist. \nSEMYON But you have had so many presents. \nThe girl wafts Semyon's cigar smoke. \nMARIA You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa. \nSEMYON I know. \nSemyon cuddles Maria and stubs his cigar. \nAnna smiles at the warm family scene, perhaps remembering her own father. \n36   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        36 \nNikolai gets out of the Mercedes and helps an extremely pissed Kirill out of the car into the rain.

Russian copy of BMW flat twin. \nAnna tries one more time to start the bike and growls with fury. Nikolai gently takes her shoulders and after a brief resistance Anna climbs off the bike.

Nikolai isn't sure what to make of her. She begins to chain the bike's rear wheel. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) You got far to go? \nAnna tucks her crash helmet under her arm and prepares to set off walking. \nANNA Just across the park. \nNIKOLAI I'm a driver. I even do limousines. Look... \nNikolai opens the rear car door. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) If Semyon found out I let one of his guests walk home in the rain, he'd fire me. And I can take care of your bike. So... \nNikolai holds open the rear car door.       Rain pours. \n39   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                       39 \nNikolai is driving Anna through the rain-swept streets. The wipers beat time as they drive in silence. As Nikolai holds the steering wheel, Anna sees the intricate detail of the eagle tattoo on the back of his right hand. \nNIKOLAI So you're a midwife. Jesus. \nAnna smiles politely. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) What's it like? \nANNA You get used to it. \nA pause.

Pause. \nANNA (CONT'D) What, you don't know? \nNIKOLAI Yeah, I know, I know, it's just... it makes me upset, you know? Thinking about it. This time of year. They're back in Yekaterinburg. In the forests. Near the mountains. \nA long pause. \nANNA Left here. \nNikolai turns. \nANNA (CONT'D) So Semyon employs you? \nNIKOLAI I'm... sort of freelance. \nANNA You said he'd fire you. \nNikolai doesn't answer.      Anna decides she can be bold. \nANNA (CONT'D) Did you ever meet a girl called Tatiana? \nNIKOLAI I meet lots of girls called Tatiana. \nANNA She was pregnant. \nNIKOLAI In that case, no, I never heard of her. \nYuri steps outside the forensic tent. He opens the bag and takes out the note. He unfolds it to read, then smiles to himself. \n41    INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - MORNING                    41 \nAnna is drying her hair, looking at herself in the mirror. She turns off the dryer. There is a knock on the door. \nHELEN Anna? \nHelen enters looking anxious.    We see Stepan hovering in the background. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Stepan, come here. Tell her what you told me. \nStepan stands primly in the doorway, strangely defiant. \nANNA What? (pause) Stepan, what? I'm late for work. \nHe shakes his head angrily. Finally from behind his back he produces Tatiana's diary. \nANNA (CONT'D) Who gave you that? \nHELEN It was on the dresser. \nANNA Mum, you can't go through my things. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                            38A. \n41   CONTINUED:                                                      41 \nHELEN You wanted him to translate it. \nAnna gets up to grab the diary. \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                           39. \n41   CONTINUED: (2)                                               41 \nANNA And he said he wouldn't do it so I've found somebody else. \nStepan explodes. \nSTEPAN No Anna! You don't go to someone else with this! You don't go to anyone! Nasilovanie, it means rape. Iglah, it means needle. Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess. \nStepan hands the diary to Anna and then turns. \nSTEPAN (CONT'D) I go to wash my hands. \nHe disappears. Anna and Helen are left in awkward silence. Anna buries the diary in her dressing table drawer. Helen looks at her with anxiety. \nHELEN Anna, Stepan said this girl ended up in the hands of the vory v zakone. Do you know what that means? \nANNA Just because I'm back in this room doesn't mean I'm twelve again. \nHELEN You never listened to me even then! \nANNA Look, if I don't find a relative in the next few days they'll put Christine out for fostering. Once she's in the system, she'll never get out again. \nA pause. \nHELEN Who named her Christine? \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                               40. \n41   CONTINUED: (3)                                                   41 \nANNA I had to call her something. It sounds like Christmas. (pause) She's very beautiful. \nHelen is now deeply concerned. \nHELEN If I can persuade Stepan to translate it, will you leave the rest to the police? \nAnna looks at Helen, then digs out the diary and hands it to her. \nANNA Tell him I've heard bad words before. \nHelen is about to leave.       She stops in the doorway. \nHELEN Your father used to say the vory are a contagious disease. There's no cure once they've touched you. \nA pause.   Anna smiles. \nANNA Momma, this is London. \n42   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. NEGLECTED SITTING ROOM - DAY                42 \nWe are in HARLESDEN, NORTH LONDON. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) I'm recommending you to my dad. I want to make sure you're not a fucking queer. \nKirill looks suddenly wild.          He swigs his whisky.   A long pause. \nNIKOLAI You've drunk enough Kirill. \nKIRILL Enough? \nKirill hurls his whisky bottle against the wall.            The girls all flinch. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) You fucking Siberian ox don't tell a vor what is enough. \nA pause.   Nikolai studies Kirill's anger. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) I've brought you to my dad's best stable. He uses this place himself. They're all clean. Now I'm going to watch you fuck one of these girls to prove to me that you ain't queer. \nA pause. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) So which one is it going to be? \nSilence. Nikolai looks around the room.           Finally... Nikolai turns to the girl who is sobbing. \nNIKOLAI Her. \nKirill smiles. WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                            44. \n45   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY                             45 \nNikolai is fucking the girl, who is now silent.   She is on all fours, registering no emotion. \nKirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the bottle, watching Nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and drunken jealousy mixing together. Nikolai grits his teeth and comes inside the girl. Kirill whoops and whistles and begins to applaud. \nThe girl is still silent, expressionless. \nKIRILL You did OK!     You did OK. \nNIKOLAI Yeah? \nNikolai glares at Kirill. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) Well if my examination is over, get the fuck out of here while I get dressed. \nKirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before leaving. Finally alone, Nikolai gently helps the girl to lie down. She is numb. He covers her up with a blanket then begins to pull on his clothes. The girl is staring up at the ceiling. \nAfter a few moments she begins to sing a Russian folk song softly under her breath. Nikolai speaks to her softly in Russian. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) (in Russian) What's your last name? \nA pause. Finally the girl stops singing but is silent. Nikolai is insistent. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) (in Russian) Tell me your last name. \nGIRL Kirilenko. \n(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD Revision      -   11/27/06                        45. \n45   CONTINUED:                                                        45 \nNIKOLAI (in Russian) Where are you from? \nSilence. She looks up and stares into Nikolai's eyes. She sees some urgency there... \nGIRL Ukraine. \nNIKOLAI (in Ukrainian) Where? Which village? Which town? \nGIRL (in Ukrainian) Irpen. Outside Kiev. \nThe girl is asking a silent question but Nikolai doesn't linger. He heads for the door then stops and turns. \nNIKOLAI (in Ukrainian) Stay alive a little longer. \n46   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -46 NIGHT \nIn the half-lit private room, Anna is dancing with Christine in her arms. She is singing a lullaby softly to her. The door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other babies are silent. \nFinally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib. She sits down on the bed where the mother should be. She curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined to pull herself together. \nAs she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward, she is suddenly confronted by Semyon. \nHe is standing in the shadows, a Bavarian trilby in his hands. Anna gasps with shock. Semyon speaks softly... \nSEMYON Hello Anna.     I came on tiptoes. \nANNA How did you get in here? \nTATIANA (V.O.) I was thrown down the stairs and fell onto some sacks, like potato sacks... \n47   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                              47 \nStepan is sitting at the kitchen table, translating Tatiana's diary aloud, as Helen transcribes it onto a note pad. Stepan's translation breaks up with emotion but he tries to remain detached. Helen also tries hard to concentrate on her task but wipes away a tear as she writes. Tatiana's V.O. slowly blends into Stepan's voice... \nSTEPAN ...like potato sacks. Kirill came down after me and he hit me until I was bleeding. Then he tried to rape me but he couldn't do it... He just got madder and madder and kept hitting me. In the end his father came down. It was the father who raped me. He shouted at his son...'if you don't break a horse, it will never be tame, Kirill'. \nThey hear a key in the door and prepare for Anna's arrival. When she enters she feels the tense silence. After a moment, Helen tries to be bright... \nHELEN Hello dear. How was your night? \nAnna sees the tears in both their eyes.   She sees the diary and the transcription and sits down. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Stepan's arthritis is playing up. I'm taking dictation. \nHelen gets to her feet. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Would you like some tea or something? \nANNA No. \nAnna gently pushes Helen back into her seat. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                              49. \n47   CONTINUED:                                                       47 \nHELEN What's wrong? \nANNA He came to see me. \nSilence. \nANNA (CONT'D) The man from the restaurant.    He came to the hospital. \nStepan leaps to his feet. \nSTEPAN I told you this would happen!    I told you! \nHELEN Sit down Stepan. \nSTEPAN The devil is loose now. \nEveryone begins to talk at once... \nANNA I know it's my fault... \nHELEN It's no one's fault... \nSTEPAN They are in this room now.   They are cancer... \nHELEN We should just sit down calmly and think... \nSTEPAN I have a friend from Ukraine who owns a gun.... \nHELEN Stepan!! \nSTEPAN ...from the war in Afghanistan. \n(CONTINUED) WHITE Revision     -   9/12/06                            50. \n47   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  47 \nHELEN Don't talk about guns... \nAnna suddenly stands up. \nANNA Shut up both of you!!! \nSilence.   Everyone catches their breath. \nANNA (CONT'D) OK... now... what would dad have done? \nA pause. \nSTEPAN We all know what he would have done. \nStepan heads for the kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle of vodka. Rather than admonish him, Anna and Helen both nod agreement. Stepan pours three large vodkas. Stepan knocks his down. Anna and Helen take sips. \nHELEN And then he would have been practical. \nSTEPAN He would ask if there were bullets for the gun. \nHELEN No! This isn't our world.     We're just... ordinary people. \nKIRILL You bet it's fucking good... \nNikolai hands the bottle back. As he does, one of the van doors is kicked closed revealing Semyon, suddenly upon them. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) Jesus Christ, Papa... You scared me.... \nSemyon grabs the bottle of champagne and smashes it on the floor. Kirill recoils in terror. Nikolai straightens, faces up. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) What's wrong? We're just sampling it! \nSemyon is so furious he still can't speak. He grabs Kirill and slams him against the wall. Finally he hisses in his face. \nSEMYON Your friend Soyka is dead. \nKIRILL Yeah? So what? What's that got to do with me? \nSEMYON Don't lie to me!! \nSemyon slams Kirill against the wall once more. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                                54. \n49   CONTINUED: (2)                                                     49 \nKIRILL I swear I don't know nothing about it... \nSEMYON I said, don't lie to me! \nSemyon slams Kirill hard against the wall again.       Suddenly Nikolai steps forward. \nNIKOLAI Your dad is right, Kirill.       There's no point lying to him. \nA pause. Semyon and Kirill are frozen for a moment. Nikolai calmly lights a cigarette. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) Ozim's nephew slit Soyka's throat. Kirill paid him to do it. \nThere is stunned silence.       Semyon loosens his grip on Kirill. \nKIRILL (in Russian) Shut your fucking mouth! \nNIKOLAI (in Russian) Your dad always knows the truth anyway. \nNikolai and Semyon survey each other. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) But it's OK boss. You don't have to worry... \nSEMYON (incredulous) I don't have to worry? \nNIKOLAI I disposed of the body myself. The police won't find a thing. \nSemyon has now lost all interest in Kirill and is concentrating on Nikolai. He laughs with incredulity. \nSEMYON My son commits a murder?

A fellow soldier! And no one thought to tell me about it? \nNIKOLAI The vory code says you don't talk to anybody about your captain. Kirill is my captain. \nSemyon circles Nikolai. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) When I found out what had happened, I did what I had to do to clean the situation up. \nKirill is about to speak but before he can, Nikolai speaks for him. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) It was a matter of honor. Soyka was spreading lies about Kirill. About your family. (in Russian) Kirill did the right thing. \nSemyon hisses with fury and grabs Nikolai. \nSEMYON I decide what is right and what is wrong. You do not kill a vor for no reason. \nNikolai shrugs Semyon off, holding his ground. \nNIKOLAI You know as well as I do Soyka was talking to the police. \nA pause. Semyon is shocked at the depth of Nikolai's knowledge. He peers at him. \nSEMYON For a driver, you are well informed. \nNIKOLAI I've got connections with the Chechens who export cars. Soyka was speaking to the Russian desk. Scotland Yard. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                            56. \nAnna gets to her feet. \nHELEN Anna!      No!   Come back here! \nAnna races out of the restaurant in pursuit of Nikolai. \n51   EXT. BURGER RESTAURANT - DAY                                     51 \nNikolai has emerged into the busy suburban street and is about to get in to his car.

Read the diary! She was fourteen when he raped her! \nNikolai casually hits the key fob of his car. \nANNA (CONT'D) You murdered her! You bastards murdered her! \nPassers-by stare at Anna. Helen and Stepan have come out of the restaurant to restrain her. Nikolai stops and judges the fury on Anna's face. He speaks calmly. \nNIKOLAI Anger is very dangerous. It makes people do stupid things. Forget any of this ever happened. You're in the wrong place, Anna Ivanovna. \nHe gestures at the burger restaurant. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) You belong in there. With nice people. Stay away from people like me. \nAnna and Nikolai are staring at each other, suddenly a strange connection between them. \nThen Stepan steps forward and spits in Nikolai's face, delivering a Russian curse as he does so. Nikolai almost reacts out of instinct but stops himself. \nNikolai wipes his face and peers into Anna's eyes.       Finally he gets into his car and drives away. \n52   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                             52 \nNikolai is alone, sitting at a candlelit table, reading Tatiana's diary. We hear Tatiana in voice-over... \nTATIANA (V.O.) I am not sure I can carry on another day. The windows won't open so I can't throw myself out. They inject me every day with heroin.

(CONT'D) Sometimes I think this is all a hallucination... \nHe sees Semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the diary. Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his way to sit opposite Nikolai. Nikolai pushes the diary across the table. Semyon pours two drinks. \nSEMYON It is good to have someone who I can trust to do simple tasks. \nA pause as Semyon glances at a few pages of diary. \nSEMYON (CONT'D) In this business, sometimes the biggest danger comes from the most stupid things. You can't afford to be careless in any area. \nNikolai senses a change of attitude towards him. As if Semyon were beginning to accept him into the fold. Semyon raises a toast. \nSEMYON (CONT'D) Nasdrovia. \nNIKOLAI Nasdrovia. \nAfter a moment. \nSEMYON So what was the lie that Soyka was spreading about my son? \nNikolai looks anxious. \nNIKOLAI (in Russian) It was nothing important. \nSEMYON Kirill had him killed for nothing important? \nSemyon pours two more vodkas. \nNIKOLAI I don't want to repeat it. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                            61. \n52   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 52 \nSEMYON (smiling) For me you will repeat it. \nNikolai doesn't respond. It is obvious that Semyon half knows already. He shrugs... \nSEMYON (CONT'D) You play   with the Prince to do business   with the King. But if you want   to do business with me you must   be open with me. Thieves- in-law. \nA pause.   Semyon nurses his vodka. \n60   EXT. HOUSING ESTATE - NIGHT                                    60 \nA large public housing estate is being swept by rain. Christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated tower blocks. Stepan is walking against the wind, carrying a bag of shopping. He holds onto his Russian hat to stop it blowing away. Kids splash in the puddles. \nStepan arrives at the front garden of his small, ground- floor council flat. As he fumbles for his keys in the cold we see that Nikolai is watching him from the driver's seat of his Mercedes. Once Stepan has disappeared into his flat, Nikolai gets out of the car and approaches Stepan's flat. \n61   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - NIGHT                            61 \nHelen is preparing food for a small family dinner. Anna enters with her cellphone in her hand. She mooches for food to hide her agenda. Finally... \nANNA Mum... I can't get hold of Stepan. \nHELEN Why do you want to? \nANNA I need to check something with him. \nHELEN Anna... \nANNA (matter of fact) He's not at home, do you know where else he might be? \nHelen simply stares at her. \nHELEN Anna.

After a moment Helen goes to her, holds her hands and peers into her eyes. We expect comforting words, but instead... \nHELEN You enjoy this. \nA pause. \nHELEN (CONT'D) You're like your father. Ordinary life isn't enough. \nAnna turns and walks out of the house. \n62   EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT                                   62 \nAnna drives her motorbike through North London streets. Rain is falling. \n63   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        63 \nAnna is standing in the falling rain, staring over at the trans-Siberian restaurant. The restaurant is busy, with the noise of revelers swelling every time the door is opened. \nAnna seems to be exiled from where she should really be - \nInside a restaurant like this, with its danger and vibrancy. \nSuddenly she is illuminated by headlights. She turns and sees that Nikolai is pulling up in his Mercedes. Kirill is in the passenger seat. Nikolai gets out of the car and stops when he sees Anna. Anna is like a fox caught in headlights. \nNIKOLAI What are you doing here? \nA pause. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                             71. \n63   CONTINUED:                                                      63 \nANNA (echoing Nikolai's words) I don't know. I was passing. \nKirill studies the gaze between Nikolai and Anna and senses the connection. \nKIRILL If you're passing, you pass. You keep going, bitch. Nikolai, come on... \nKirill grabs Nikolai's arm, and after peering at Anna for a moment, he turns to go with Kirill. Anna gathers her courage. \nANNA Family is important to you people isn't it? \nKIRILL (laughing) 'You people'? (in Russian) What the hell is she talking about? \nMusic swells from the restaurant. \nANNA Tell Semyon the baby I delivered on Christmas Eve is his daughter. \nKirill and Nikolai stop. A swell of laughter from the restaurant. Anna is about to continue but Nikolai steps forward and places two fingers on Anna's lips to stop her from saying anymore. Anna tears his hands from her mouth. \nSEMYON No. He stays here.   I want to talk business. \nA confused pause.     Kirill looks from Nikolai to his father. \nKIRILL What business? \nA pause as Kirill suddenly senses his exclusion. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) Papa, what business? His business is my business. \nSemyon stares at Kirill and Kirill knows the look. \nSEMYON Go to the cellar Kirill.   And take your time. \nKirill hesitates. He is angry as hell but too scared of his father's gaze to say anything. Finally he turns fast and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he goes. \nSemyon waits a moment before returning to the business of cutting the cake. Finally... \nSEMYON (CONT'D) Did you deal with the old man? \nNikolai nods. \nA pause.     Semyon looks up and fixes Nikolai with a stare. \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                            75. \n64   CONTINUED: (2)                                                64 \nSEMYON (CONT'D) (in Russian) It's time you joined us. \nA long moment. The thing Nikolai has been working for has finally happened. There seems to be little joy. \nNIKOLAI (in Russian) Thank you. Papa. \nSemyon returns to his work.    Nikolai hesitates. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) What shall I tell Kirill? \nSemyon continues with the cake, unconcerned. \nSEMYON Tell him I changed my mind about the brandy. \n65   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. CELLAR - NIGHT                65 \nThe cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates of wine. Flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. As Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case of brandy across the cellar floor. \nKirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a long swig as Nikolai joins him. He grins as he gestures at the brandy... \nKIRILL My dad swapped a little Georgian girl for this stuff. \nNikolai sits down on a crate, rests his head against the wall. Kirill joins him and swigs some more. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) Hey, don't feel bad. What happened up there is just how he is. He plays people against each other. That's all. I realize more and more what he's like. Here, drink to the Georgian girl... \nKirill offers the bottle to Nikolai but he refuses. \n(CONTINUED) PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                             76. \n65   CONTINUED:                                                      65 \nKIRILL (CONT'D) What?   I drink alone now. \nNikolai decides to bite the bullet, get this news over with. \nNIKOLAI He offered me stars. I accepted them. \nA long pause. This is what Kirill wanted, but now it feels like a stab in the back. Finally Kirill swallows a huge swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug Nikolai. He squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away. \nKIRILL (lying)) You think I didn't know already? He told me before. It was my fucking idea. He said there are a lot of things I have to teach you. \nNikolai nods.    Kirill gets to his feet.... \nKIRILL (CONT'D) Some stuff will take a long time. I've been protecting you until now. \nNIKOLAI Yeah. \nKIRILL What? \nA pause. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) You think I don't know stuff you don't know? I am vor by birth. The stars are a birthmark for me... \nNIKOLAI I know, Kirill. \nKirill is about to fly into a rage but Nikolai gets to his feet. \n80   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD.

After she has gone Nikolai stirs, focuses on her face. \nNIKOLAI I thought you did birth. \nNikolai smiles, but Anna is trying hard to even out her fear and anger. \nANNA My uncle.... \nNikolai tries to sit up and registers pain. \nANNA (CONT'D) ...the one who spat in your face... He's disappeared. \nA pause. Nikolai gasps in pain as he raises himself up. Anna sees the wounds on his arms and glimpses the tattoos on his chest, scaring her even more. \nANNA (CONT'D) If we don't hear from him soon we're going to the police... \nNikolai reaches for a bottle of water and manages to take a swig. Anna is impatient for a reaction. \nANNA (CONT'D) Do you know where he is? \nA pause. Nikolai finishes the bottle of water in one thirsty swig. Finally... \nNIKOLAI Yes. \nA pause. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) He's in Scotland. In Edinburgh. In a five-star hotel. \nAnna is locating the door in case she has to flee as Nikolai swings his legs out of the bed to stretch his painful limbs. \n(CONTINUED) WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                           87. \n81   CONTINUED: (2)                                                81 \nANNA Edinburgh? \nNIKOLAI I'm going to need some clothes. I arrived here without any. Can you get me some? \nAnna doesn't budge. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) I can't walk out of here naked. \nANNA You can't walk out of here because you're attached to a drip. Explain Edinburgh. \nNikolai sighs, sits back down on the bed.    He finally speaks softly. \nNIKOLAI Your uncle knew too much. \nNikolai shrugs. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) I was told to get rid of him. I was meant to send him to heaven with a bullet in his head. Instead I sent him to Edinburgh. With a first-class ticket. \nA pause. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) He is of the old school. He understood the situation. Exile or death. Edinburgh was his idea. He said they throw a great party at New Year. And he said it was a good excuse to get away from his family. \nNikolai smiles at Anna. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) So... just a pair of jeans and a T- shirt. A jacket. And some shoes. \nYURI (CONT'D) My God... \nNIKOLAI If they terminate the operation now, they will be wasting this... \nA pause. Yuri looks shocked and slightly horrified. Nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got this far.

Yuri is still overwhelmed. \nYURI They are bound to ask... who did you kill? \nA pause. \nNIKOLAI (in Russian) Tell them I only killed myself. \nA pause. Yuri is humbled. They share a moment of understanding as they smoke. Finally... \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) And you can tell them I'm going to replace Semyon at the head of the London organization. \nYuri laughs. \nYURI What drugs are they giving you? Maybe it's the anesthetic speaking. \nNIKOLAI I need you to take Semyon out of the picture. I want you to arrest him. \nNikolai lights another cigarette from the stub of the one he is smoking.

She's dead. \nA pause. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) But she had Semyon's baby. If you prove the baby is his and prove the girl was under age when the baby was conceived, that's statutory rape. \nA pause.   Yuri begins it think it through. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) All you need is the baby and some of Semyon's DNA. For poetic reasons I suggest you take his blood. \nYuri peers at Nikolai with awe.    A long pause.   Finally Yuri smiles. \nYURI You intrigue me. \nA pause. \nYURI (CONT'D) If we had never had this conversation they would have sent you home. You could have spent the Spring in the mountains. Riding your bicycle to your office every morning through fields of flowers. \nA pause. \nYURI (CONT'D) Why stay? \nNikolai reacts but doesn't answer.

Kirill smiles and blows it up for her. \nMARIA (CONT'D) What were you and Grandpa shouting about last night? \nKIRILL Nothing, baby. \nMARIA It sounded like something. \nKirill takes a deep breath to blow a balloon then stops and looks at Maria. \nKIRILL Someone I know got hurt and I blamed Grandpa. \nMARIA Did you fight each other?

Kirill smiles.   We see slight abrasions. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) So, today I do as I am told. \nShe nods and Kirill blows another balloon. At that moment Kirill sees on the security monitor behind the bar that a police car is pulling up outside the restaurant. His face clouds as another pulls up beside it. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) Maria.

A uniformed officer stands nearby, and there is a police doctor with a medical bag sitting at the next table, waiting. The whole scene is rendered surreal by all the balloons which bounce around them. Semyon is in full charming old man mode. \nSEMYON (in Russian) You'll have a drink, Yuri... \nHe is half on his feet. \nYURI (in Russian) I don't drink on duty. \nSEMYON (in Russian) Sometimes I don't believe you are really Russian. \nYURI (in Russian) I've told you, I am half Russian. \nSEMYON (in Russian) Then have half a drink. \nYuri shakes his head.

It's up to you. \nSemyon glances at the doctor and chuckles. \nSEMYON (in Russian) He sits there like a vampire. \nYURI (in Russian) What, you are afraid of needles, Semyon? \nSemyon's face hardens and he glares at Yuri. \nSEMYON I am afraid of... conspiracies. \nA pause.     Yuri speaks softly. \nYURI I will return tomorrow with a court order. \nHe gets to his feet. \nSEMYON Wait.       I've done nothing wrong. \nSemyon begins to roll up his sleeve, revealing a long scroll of tattoos. \nThen a needle is being pushed into Semyon's arm by the doctor. Semyon's face doesn't flicker.

A car passing by has to slam on its brakes. Kirill yells. \nKIRILL Hey, you stupid fucker!! \nA horn blows. The passing car accelerates angrily by. Then we hear a baby crying. Kirill looks into the half darkness of the back seat and we see Kirill's black sports bag, partially zipped up. Christine is crying inside it, her little grasping hand protruding past the zipper. Kirill speaks softly. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) Be quiet baby. Quiet baby.    It's OK. PINK Revision     -   11/12/06                         102. \n98   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL.

She calms down a little. \nANNA Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine. I saw him here!

He steps into a small courtyard, where a fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of a chain. \nNikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger, slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street. \nKIRILL So you pick up Ozim and his bitch of a wife and you bring them back here. \nHe glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly. \nKIRILL (CONT'D) Then I'll think of an excuse and we can get away. \nNIKOLAI I'll think of an excuse. Your excuses are like fucking fairy tales. \nKirill grins and Nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys. The lights on an expensive black Mercedes glow in response.

An already anxious Ozim is cowering in the shadows, held at bay by the dog. \nThe moment Semyon steps out the dog stops barking. Ozim relaxes a little and steps forward. Semyon pets the dog. \nSEMYON So what did they say? \nSemyon takes a swig of vodka.    Ozim looks severely nervous. \nOZIM They were going to kill me.   Those Chechens are savages. \nOzim is reliving the ordeal. \nOZIM (CONT'D) I pointed out that I am a Muslim too and it is a sin for a Muslim to kill a Muslim. \nSEMYON (irritated) What did they say about my son? \nOZIM They said they would spare me only if I delivered Kirill to them. \nSEMYON You are being very honest. \nOZIM I fear you more than I fear them. \nSemyon suddenly breaks the neck of the bottle and holds the jagged edge to Ozim's throat.

After a moment... \nSEMYON Do they know where to find Kirill? \nOZIM They are like wolves. \nSEMYON Do they know what he looks like? \nOzim shakes his head. \nOZIM No. They have just arrived from the mountains. \nSEMYON Then tell them you will deliver Kirill to them. \nOzim is stunned.

The steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he can't see who has entered. \nNIKOLAI Ozim? \nHe sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately. Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with an open razor. \nNikolai is naked, alone. \nSuddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother. In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously has serious combat training but the brothers are strong and angry. \nSuddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water. Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the temple. \nAs the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor, and staggers out of the steam room. \n77   OMITTED                                                      77 GOLDENROD Revision     -   11/27/06                       84. \n78   INT.

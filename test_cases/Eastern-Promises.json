The scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain. A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional barber's shop called Ozim's. \n2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2 \nThe shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk) is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA). Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit beneath the barber's gown. \nDuring the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands. \nOzim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks with a Russian accent. \nOZIM Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody kids, you know... he says - `but Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas! We're Islam! \nSOYKA Oi, how much are you taking off? \nOZIM Christmas! So I said to him... alisverise cimac. The kid's sixteen... \nOzim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'. \nOZIM (CONT'D) They don't want to work do they. Shicma.... \nEKREM (hesitantly interrupting) Uncle Ozim....... \nWe see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear as well as cold. \n(CONTINUED) WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                               2. \n2   CONTINUED:                                                         2 \nOZIM This is him.     The kid I'm talking about. \nEkrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem in the mirror. \nSOYKA He looks OK to me... how you doin' Ekrem? \nSoyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it as if it were enchanted... \nOZIM He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do one lousy thing for me. Here, look... Ekrem, take this... \nOzim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally terrified. \nEKREM Ozim... memnum etmek. \nOZIM We had a deal now he's backing out. \nSOYKA (laughing) Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone. It's obviously a psychological thing... \nOZIM Take it Ekrem. \nSOYKA Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave. \nOZIM This is the kid who walks around like Al Capone. Take the fucking ustura and finish this Rushca. \nSOYKA (startled) What? \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                              3. \n2   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 2 \nSoyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream bubbles in the blood. \n3   EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT                                 3 \nWe dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA) hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop. She is barefoot. \n4   INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT                                    4 \nThe CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER. Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the customer react to her ragged appearance. \nTATIANA (Russian accent) Please... I have... \nCHEMIST For methadone I need to see paper prescription. \nThe customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then faints onto the floor. \n5   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT                5 \nWe see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley. \n", "test1_true": "PARAMEDIC No. \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                                 4. \n5   CONTINUED:                                                        5 \nCUT TO \n6   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT                6 \nA tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse. Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The theater is full of people in scrubs, including an anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double speed. \nWe notice that her arms are already dotted with festering needle marks. \nA nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and we can hear frantic activity from the operating table.... \nNURSE 1 Her stats are very poor, very poor. Baby's very distressed. \nAnna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the contents of the bag. We see a business card from a restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary. \nJUNIOR DOCTOR Shoulder distocia, I think.   Stuck on the pubic bone. \nCut to Anna at Tatiana's head.    Anna strokes her face and speaks softly. \nANNA Darling... darling, can you hear me? \nNURSE Baby's heart beat sixty... fifty- eight, fifty-eight... fifty-seven... \nJUNIOR DOCTOR Anna, I'm trying to rotate the shoulder medially... shit... \nTHE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter panic as he attempts to free the baby. \nThe doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop.

Doctor Aziz joins the junior doctor, who looks out of his depth. \nAZIZ Speak to me... \nBefore the junior doctor can speak Anna speaks directly to Aziz. \nANNA (softly) We need to get the baby out now. \nAziz knows he can take Anna's word... \nAZIZ OK, let's go. \nAll hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic. \nTATIANA (V.O.) My name is Tatiana. My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died. We were all buried there. Buried under the soil of Russia. That is why I left to find a better life. \nWe hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek. \nANNA (whispers) You had a girl. \nA sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her bloody wrist. \n(CONTINUED) BLUE Revision     -   11/4/06                           6. \n6   CONTINUED: (2)                                                6 \nAZIZ Ok.

I know it. Not much of a place for a kid to grow up in. Especially not a girl. \nShe hesitates.       Nikolai approaches and gives her the address. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) If you want my opinion, the kid would be better off in London. Maybe with you. Why not? Tatiana's family don't sound like the kind of people who'd want another mouth to feed. \nA pause. \nANNA You read the diary? \nNikolai looks all around.        Anna studies him, unsure. \nANNA (CONT'D) So how can you keep doing what you're doing? \nNIKOLAI I told you.    I'm just a driver. \nAnna sees some softness in his expression.

I was passing. \nAfter a long moment Anna turns away. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) Oh, and... your uncle. \nNikolai smiles. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) Is it true he was in the KGB? \nANNA I don't know. \nNIKOLAI Well, he's a brave old man.    That's for sure. \nA pause. \nNIKOLAI (CONT'D) Does he live with you? \nAnna is about to answer but stops herself. Nikolai peers at her and finally shrugs then turns to walk away.

SIDE STREETS - NIGHT.               54 \nCrowds of football supporters are streaming away from the football stadium, where the floodlights are still casting their glow.

He seems slightly drunk on top of his normal craziness. He has an Arsenal scarf around his neck and is looking for trouble, jeering at the Chelsea supporters across the street. \nEKREM Hey! Hey Kabuka Chelsea! Fuck you!! Yeah you! Aliverisme!! Fucker! \nA policeman steps up to Ekrem and gives him a shove and he stumbles a little. As he gets to his feet we notice TWO CHECHEN MEN who are trailing Ekrem, ducking their heads away from the line of policemen. \n55   EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT                                           55 \nEkrem is now isolated from the crowds, swigging from a can of lager. He is chanting `Arsenal, Arsenal' to himself as he walks. He stops to take a piss on someone's grave. \n", "test2_true": "Ekrem chokes for a while and the Chechen loosens the knot. The second Chechen pulls out an open razor.

An already anxious Ozim is cowering in the shadows, held at bay by the dog. \nThe moment Semyon steps out the dog stops barking. Ozim relaxes a little and steps forward. Semyon pets the dog. \nSEMYON So what did they say? \nSemyon takes a swig of vodka.    Ozim looks severely nervous. \nOZIM They were going to kill me.   Those Chechens are savages. \nOzim is reliving the ordeal. \nOZIM (CONT'D) I pointed out that I am a Muslim too and it is a sin for a Muslim to kill a Muslim. \nSEMYON (irritated) What did they say about my son? \nOZIM They said they would spare me only if I delivered Kirill to them. \nSEMYON You are being very honest. \nOZIM I fear you more than I fear them. \nSemyon suddenly breaks the neck of the bottle and holds the jagged edge to Ozim's throat.

A uniformed officer stands nearby, and there is a police doctor with a medical bag sitting at the next table, waiting. The whole scene is rendered surreal by all the balloons which bounce around them. Semyon is in full charming old man mode. \nSEMYON (in Russian) You'll have a drink, Yuri... \nHe is half on his feet. \nYURI (in Russian) I don't drink on duty. \nSEMYON (in Russian) Sometimes I don't believe you are really Russian. \nYURI (in Russian) I've told you, I am half Russian. \nSEMYON (in Russian) Then have half a drink. \nYuri shakes his head.

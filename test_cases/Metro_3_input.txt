McCall sits like a wax figure. 
MCCALL (cynically) The 6 horse is still last. 
ROPER He'll be running at the quarter pole. 
ON THE TRACK 
The horses head into the stretch. The FOUR is on the lead and the SIX is starting to unleash a big run. Passing horses with every stride. 
ROPER (V.O.) There he goes. 
IN THE STANDS 
McCall sits forward slightly. 
MCCALL They need to run first and second? 
ROPER Yeah, first and second. 
Roper gets to his feet. 
ON THE TRACK 
The horses thunder down the stretch. The FOUR horse is in front and the SIX is coming on from behind. 
IN THE STANDS 
Roper is on his feet screaming. 
ROPER Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell. 
McCall jumps to this feet and joins him. 
MCCALL COME ON RUSSELL!... (to Roper) Who the fuck's Russell?! 
ROPER The jockey! 
MCCALL COME ON, RUSSELL! 
Roper and McCall cheer together. 
ON THE TRACK 
The FOUR horse crosses the finish line in front. The SIX horse is flying... Needs to beat one horse to be second... He's running out of room... With one last surge he hits the wire and... It's too close to call. 
IN THE STANDS 
McCall, really excited, turns to Roper. 
MCCALL We won! 
ROPER (disheartened) We lost. 
MCCALL (confidently) We won. 
ROPER How much you wanna bet? 
MCCALL You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick. 
ANGLE ON TOTE BOARD 
As the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on... 4-6-8. They won. 
IN THE STANDS 
ROPER Yes! 
High fives. 
ROPER That's eight hundred bucks. 
INT. BET/CASH WINDOW - DAY 
Roper and McCall collect their money. Four hundred a piece, not bad. McCall pockets his money. 
MCCALL How long you been coming here? 
ROPER About six years. My partner took me. 
MCCALL Is it always like this? 
ROPER Occasionally you lose. 
Suddenly Roper's BEEPER goes off. He checks it, takes out a cellular phone and dials. 
ROPER (into the phone) Roper here. (he listens) I'm on my way. 
He hangs up and turns to McCall. 
ROPER We gotta go. 
EXT. JEWELRY STORE - UNION SQUARE - DAY 
Marble facade. Tastefully reinforced windows and door. Choppers circle overhead. Both ends of the street are sealed off. Barricades are up. Spectators and news crews crowd behind those. Numerous police circulate. This is a major operation in full swing. 
INT. TRAVEL AGENCY - COMMAND CENTER - DAY 
It's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story. The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone. He's talking to the suspect. 
SOLIS We're working on that, Joe. These things aren't quite that simple. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Roper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking down the cordoned-off street. McCall takes a look at the jewelry store. Well fortified, foreboding. 
MCCALL This does not look good.

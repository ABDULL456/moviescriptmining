BEEFY So I found this other joint for you. But you're gonna have a roommate. 
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village. 
TODD (on phone) I know exactly how you feel... The night Reagan was elected, I said to my mother, "Is this man going to blow up the world, Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an hour. (knock at the door) Somebody's here.  Call you later. 
Todd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced. 
NICKY Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice.  Would it be possible for me to fill the slot? 
TODD Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is? 
Nicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both nod imperceptibly. 
NICKY Yes.  What is rent? 
TODD Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits. 
NICKY Off limits. 
TODD Right.  And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. (looks at Nicky) Aren't you boiling in that outfit? 
NICKY No. 
TODD It's like eighty degrees in this hallway.  You from the South? 
NICKY Yeah.  The deep South. 
Nicky laughs a little too hard. 
TODD Why is that funny? 
NICKY I don't know. 
TODD And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed. 
Todd turns and goes into the apartment. 
BEEFY You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about. 
NICKY Got ya. (to Todd) Is it okay if I do the sleep thing? 
TODD Yeah, your bedroom is right over there. 
The door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over it. 
INT. NICKY'S ROOM 
Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully clothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that familiar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices. 
SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands, looking concerned. 
EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING 
We HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a large church. 
INT. CATHEDRAL 
CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation. We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He gins his homily. 
CARDINAL In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven... or something like that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat. 
The crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box with the top open. 
CARDINAL (CONT'D) Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really done anything for us?  Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes?  No. He hasn't done a damn thing for any of us. 
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up. 
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN The Lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs. 
CARDINAL Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs.  He's a bore.  At least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally. 
A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up. 
YOUNG MAN After we tried for many years, the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby.

{"test1_input": "(BEAT) Okay. The Agent writes something down. \nINSURANCE AGENT (CONT'D) (into the phone) All right. And the phone. Well great. Thank you very much. The Agent hangs up the phone and rips a piece of paper from the pad in front of her. She hands it to Samantha. \nINSURANCE AGENT (CONT'D) This is the name and number of the specialist who the insurance company approves of. Just call and make an appointment. Now if this doctor signs off , you should have the implant procedure fully covered. I'm sorry it took so long. Samantha looks at the paper, impressed. \nSAMANTHA Can I give you a hug? \nINSURANCE AGENT It's fine. It's fine. You know your husband's company actually has very good insurance when it kicks in. Not a lot of jobs offer policies half as good. You're very lucky. \nINT. GROCERY STORE PHARMACY - DAY \nCurtis stands in line at the pharmacy located in the back corner of the grocery store. He approaches the counter and hands over his prescription to a female PHARMACIST. She disappears behind a divider as Curtis removes his wallet. He takes out an insurance card and runs his thumb over the bills. The Pharmacist returns with a stapled white bag. Curtis holds out the insurance card. \nPHARMACIST That's okay. We have your insurance on file. That'll be \nCURTIS What's the co-pay? \nPHARMACIST That is your co-pay. Curtis studies the small paper sack and removes three, 20 dollar bills from his wallet. \nINT.

Samantha sets the piece of paper the Insurance Agent gave her in front of him and begins clearing the table. Hannah draws on a piece of construction paper at the other end of the table. Samantha picks up a crayon and shows it to Hannah. \nSAMANTHA Green? How `bout a red? She pretends to use the crayon as lipstick. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) It was like talking to a sane person for once. She made one phone call. That's it. I've been trying that 800 number for weeks. \nCURTIS It's great. It's great. \n(TO HANNAH) Hey, Hannah. Hannah doesn't look up. He stands and goes over to her. Touches her shoulder and kneels beside her. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) You excited? Huh? We're gonna get you some help. Curtis touches his finger to her chest then stops. He can't think of the sign. He turns to Samantha. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) How do you say...sign excited? \nSAMANTHA Like this. Samantha shows him the sign. Curtis mimics. \n", "test1_true": "CURTIS (CONT'D) Now I got to do you. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSamantha lies under the covers looking at a real estate magazine. Curtis takes off his clothes by the dresser. He subtly removes a prescription bottle from his pants pocket and cups it in his palm. \nSAMANTHA Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's a 2-1 and it sits directly on the beach. Wouldn't that be great? We wouldn't have to worry about Hannah crossing traffic. Curtis walks over and leans in to see the page. They are rental photos of beach condos. \nCURTIS What's the rent? \nSAMANTHA Eight ninety nine a week. \nCURTIS That sounds real nice. Samantha keeps flipping through the magazine as Curtis heads to the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCurtis turns the water on in the sink and shakes two pills from the orange bottle. He stuffs them in his mouth and chases it with water from the faucet. Curtis looks at himself in the mirror for a moment before cutting out the light. \nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING \nA crack in the ceiling slowly comes into focus. Curtis sits up in bed, rubbing his eyes. He looks around the room. He hears Samantha in the kitchen. He takes a deep breath, smelling the breakfast cooking. Curtis smiles. \nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nCurtis sits at the kitchen table as Samantha dishes up some eggs. \nSAMANTHA You sleep well? \nCURTIS Yeah. I did. \nSAMANTHA You look like you're feeling better. Curtis nods and eats his breakfast. \nEXT. PUMP STATION CONSTRUCTION SITE/FARMLAND - DAY \nCurtis and Dewart attach a drill bit to the rig. \nCURTIS You want me to come there and do it for you? Jesus. Curtis steadies the large metal piece as Dewart ratchets it down. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Hey, how much food do you think you'd need to live on for a week? \nDEWART What do you mean? \nCURTIS I mean to stay alive. What do you think you'd need? \nDEWART Not a lot. \nCURTIS You think? \n", "test1_id": 66, "test2_input": "SARAH No. Nothing like that. There was always... \n(MORE) \nSARAH (CONT'D) (searches for the words) There was always a panic that took hold of me. I thought people were watching me or listening to me. \nI... Sarah is remembering. Her face draws tight, frustrated. \nCURTIS It's all right. It's all right. It's fine. Sarah looks up and smiles. Her focus shifts back to her son. \nSARAH Are you okay? \nCURTIS Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Sarah looks back down to Hannah's photo. \nEXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe relatively new gas station sits just off the interstate. Curtis stands at the pump filling up his truck. He watches the numbers next to the dollar sign roll higher. He looks back at the busy freeway. Cars passing. The pump stops. The final amount reads, \"$68.79\". He hangs the hose back onto the pump and pulls a cell phone from his pocket. He dials and waits. \nCURTIS (into the phone) May I have the number for Doctor George Shannan? \n(WAITS) Thanks. Curtis, phone still at his ear, turns and watches the horizon. The sun hangs low in the sky. A reddish haze. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) (into the phone) Hi, is Doctor Shannan there? May I speak with him? This is Curtis LaForche. \n(WAITS) Hey Doc. Yeah, sorry...Sorry to call you at home, I just don't think I can make it to Columbus to see that psychiatrist. Yeah, it's just too far. Is there somewhere local you can send me? \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCurtis steps quietly into the bedroom. The lights are on, but Samantha has fallen asleep on top of the made bed. He empties his pockets on the dresser and Samantha wakes up. \nSAMANTHA Hey. \nCURTIS Oh, hey. Sorry I woke you up. \nSAMANTHA It's okay. Where you been? \nCURTIS I went to see mom. Samantha sits up in the bed. \nSAMANTHA Is she okay? \nCURTIS Mmm hmm. I just wanted to check up on her. \nSAMANTHA You shoulda told me we would have gone with you. \nCURTIS That's okay. Samantha lays back down, tucking herself under the covers. \nSAMANTHA Come to bed. \nCURTIS I will in a bit. Curtis finishes emptying his pockets. \n", "test2_true": "Hannah sleeps soundly in her bed. Curtis stands at the door watching her. He walks over and takes a seat on the edge of the bed. He listens to her breath. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - NIGHT \nThe backyard is almost pitch black. Curtis stands in front of the storm shelter doors holding out the Coleman Lantern. \nHe surveys the backyard with it. The trash pile has been removed leaving the yard more open. Curtis begins to count steps out from the left edge of the shelter doors. He counts to himself, three feet per stride. He begins to outline a rectangle. \nINT. DEN - NIGHT \nThe house is quiet and the den is lit by a single lamp. Curtis sits alone on the couch, hunched over the coffee table. He writes on a yellow legal pad. It's a list with the heading, \"REMODEL\". It reads: -Shipping Container, $1,800 \n-PVC, $475 -Plumbing and waste, $1,650 -Bobcat, $1,750 -Jackhammer with pneumatics, $800 -Sealant, $150 -Dirt, -$250 At the bottom of the list, Curtis writes the figure, \"$7,500\" and circles it. He studies the number, then begins drawing a rectangular diagram below it. \nINT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK OFFICE - DAY \nCurtis blows into a Styrofoam cup and stares through the blinds of an office window. Outside, a flag snaps at the top of a pole next to the FIRST NATIONAL BANK sign. He looks down at a NEWSPAPER laid out on an end table next to him. He flips it over and studies the ads on the back. A big one in the corner catches his eye. It reads, \"CUYAHOGA GUN AND KNIFE SHOW!\" The ad lists items for sell/trade: ...Tactical Gear, Gas Masks, Batons... Curtis focuses in on the words \"Gas Masks\" and tears the ad out. JOHN MYERS(34) enters with a set of papers in his hand. Curtis quickly tucks the ad into his back pocket. Myers takes a seat in one of two chairs in front of his desk and looks over the papers. He takes a pen out of his pocket as Curtis sits down next to him. \nMYERS Well you've kept up with the payments on the house. \nCURTIS We've been good about that. Myers nods, but he carries a look of concern. He confides. \nMYERS I gotta tell you Curtis, banks aren't loaning money the way they used to. We've got you a loan today, but the interest rates are variable and we have to tie it to your house. \nCURTIS That's fine. Myers sits back, drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it. \nMYERS Curtis, I've known you a long time. We financed your house for you, two vehicles. I'm telling you this is a risky loan you're taking. \nCURTIS I need the money John. Myers nods, then leans forward and clicks the pen. \nMYERS Okay. \nEXT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - DAY \nCurtis opens the door to his truck which is parked in the bank's lot. He unbuttons his starched white shirt and places it on the truck seat. He pulls out a dirty blue work shirt and begins buttoning it. \nEXT. PUMP STATION CONSTRUCTION SITE/FARMLAND - DAY \nDewart sits at the controls of the drilling rig. He sees Curtis approaching through the construction site. Curtis waves two fingers at him. Dewart shuts down the drill. \nCURTIS Hey. \nDEWART Hey. \nCURTIS Sorry I left you yesterday. \nDewart hops down and the two approach the drill site. Dewart seems sullen. \n", "test2_id": 67, "test3_input": "CURTIS I'm not. Kyle is staring him down. Curtis just looks at the shelter. There's a long silence shared between them. \nKYLE Samantha called me. \nCURTIS I figured. Curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues installing the roof vent. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Called you to come tell me to quit? \nKYLE She called `cause she's worried. Says you've been stressed out. Curtis doesn't answer. \nKYLE (CONT'D) So? \nCURTIS So what? \nKYLE You stressed out? \nCURTIS No. No more than anybody else. \nKYLE Work all right? \nCURTIS Uh, huh...Hey, look. You wanna come by and have dinner sometime, Kyle. That's fine. We'll have a beer and talk about the old days, but you got somethin' to say just say it. \nKYLE You can stop that shit right now. I'll come over there and remind you what it feels like to get your ass whipped. Curtis keeps his head down, scolded. Kyle relents. \nKYLE (CONT'D) I'm just coming here to check on you. \nCURTIS Well I appreciate it Kyle. \nKYLE You been to see Mom? \nCURTIS Yeah. A few days ago. \nKYLE She all right. \nCURTIS You should see her. Take your girls. \nKYLE Yeah. I'll get around to it. There's an awkward moment as Curtis works with his back to Kyle. \nKYLE (CONT'D) You need a hand? Curtis turns and looks up at him. Shakes his head. \nCURTIS No. I've got it. Kyle nods. \nKYLE Okay. Call me if you need me okay? \nCURTIS I will. Kyle looks at him for a moment. He turns and walks toward the driveway. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Hey Kyle? Kyle turns back. Curtis climbs onto the yard and walks over to him. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Actually you could do me a favor. \n", "test3_true": "CURTIS You still looking for a dog? \nKYLE Sure. Kyle looks at him. \nEXT. LAFORCHE HOME/DRIVEWAY - DAY \nCurtis slaps down the tailgate to Kyle's truck, which is parked in the driveway. Red, tail wagging, hops up into the bed. Curtis closes the tailgate and sets a leash and two bowls into the back of the truck. Curtis rubs Red behind the ears. \nCURTIS They got a good spot for you, okay bud. Kyle stands at the passenger door to the truck. \nKYLE You sure? \nCURTIS Yeah. \nKYLE I know it'll make my girls happy. All right. Kyle walks around the truck to the driver's side. \nCURTIS Hey Kyle? \nKYLE Yeah? Kyle stops. Curtis walks up and hugs him. Kyle slaps him on the back. \nCURTIS Take care of yourself. \nKYLE All right. All right. I will little brother. You take care of your family. Handle your business. Okay? Curtis nods. Kyle smiles, shaking his head. \nKYLE (CONT'D) All right. Kyle climbs into the truck and cranks it. Curtis steps back as he pulls away. Red looks back from the bed of the truck. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nHannah, fresh from the tub, stands to let Curtis rub her wet head with a towel. He finishes and stands. \nCURTIS All right. Bedtime. Hannah looks up at him. Curtis signs his hand like a pillow then touches his watch. They move out of the bathroom. \nINT. LAFORCHE HOME/BEDROOM - MORNING \nCurtis sits on the edge of his bed staring at the window in their room. He's already dressed for work. He watches as the thick, dark rain hits the window and streaks. He has a curious look on his face. MOVING, down the hall. MOVING, past the den. MOVING, into the kitchen. Curtis stops at the entry to the kitchen. Samantha, wearing a robe, stands with her back to him. She's cooking something at the stove. Curtis notices the back door standing open. HARD RAIN slants down outside. He looks down at the tile floor. WET FOOTPRINTS track inside. They lead to where Samantha is standing. She turns to him. She's pale with a vacant look on her face. Her hair is soaking wet. Curtis looks at her, concerned. She stares back, emotionless. She slowly looks down at the counter next to her. A kitchen knife rests there. Curtis looks at the knife. They look at one another again. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nCurtis sits at the breakfast table across from Hannah. He looks over at Samantha. She cooks, her back to him. Hannah climbs out of her chair and goes to look out the back door. Samantha turns and dishes eggs onto Curtis' plate. \nSAMANTHA You okay? She touches his hand. Curtis FLINCHES. Their eyes meet. He wants to take it back, and she can see that. It begins to sink in for her. Hannah vocalizes something behind them. Samantha looks at her husband, shakes her head in disbelief. Hannah makes another sound, pounds on the back door. Samantha turns and sees a MAN standing in their backyard. She flinches. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) Who's that? Curtis stands to see out the back door. \nCURTIS Ah shit. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \n", "test3_id": 68}

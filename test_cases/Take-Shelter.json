{"train": "TAKE SHELTER \nWritten by \nJeff Nichols \nGrove Hill Productions Release Edit Draft \nEXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY \nSun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree. A strong wind bends them back, showing their light green bellies. \nThis is a modest house in a row of modest houses. Propane tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to be more rural than suburb. \nCURTIS LAFORCHE(35) stands in his driveway. His eyes, locked on the sky, narrow as he stares at... \nA STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him. It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and gray clouds. They swirl in and out of one another sending wispy tentacles toward the ground. \nCurtis stands, awestruck. \nThe clouds move fast overhead. He looks up as they overtake his position. A light rain begins. \nThe rain pats the ground. It makes soft indentions on his cotton shirt. He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder now. He notices something strange. \nThe rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. He pulls his shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools. \nHe rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. It's an amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil. \nCurtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now. Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. The wind bends back the trunk of the maple tree. \nCurtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL. \nTITLE: TAKE SHELTER \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nCurtis holds his head under the running shower nozzle. Cool, clean water rushes over his face. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSAMANTHA(29) stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan. She's still dressed in her sleeping attire, an oversized T- shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them. HANNAH(5) sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of toast and feeding it to the dog. \nHannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid wrapped over her right ear. It clips into her hair near the back of her head. The dog's name is Red, a Rhodesian Ridgeback that appreciates the attention. Curtis enters the kitchen and kisses Hannah on the head. In the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand and sets it on her plate. \nCURTIS (takes a seat) No, no, no...Don't feed the dog darlin'. Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds it to the dog. Samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs out on everyone's plates. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Thanks babe. \nSAMANTHA You slept late. \nSamantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric through her sewing machine. She's making curtains. NAT(37) sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed not to sweat. She's a woman with rough edges. CAMMIE(24) cradles a brown-haired BABY on top of her pregnant, eight month belly. As Nat speaks, she looks out a sliding glass door at her two kids, DJ(7) and SUE(5), playing with Hannah. \nNAT They were just drinkin' and laughin' and oh, my god...it was like I was bein' in a museum and I saw the progress from apes to men. I saw it. I saw the future. Dewart, that was him...that was going to be him in 20 years. \nSAMANTHA Oh my god. Cammie laughs. \nNAT Let me tell you, you laugh. You laugh. But this little one in your arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar just like `em. Yep... \n(GLANCES OUTSIDE) Hannah! Samantha jumps up from her sewing to see outside. Hannah, with her back to the house, bangs a 2 X 4 with a rusted nail in the end into the ground. Samantha is out the door. \nEXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nSamantha walks briskly, talking to the other children. \nSAMANTHA You guys okay? \nSUE Yeah. Samantha takes a wide line around Hannah, who continues banging the two-by-four into the ground. As soon as the child sees her mother, she stops. Samantha crouches in front of Hannah, gently taking the board away from her. Samantha signs with her hand and speaks at the same time. \nSAMANTHA No. Don't touch. Hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. Samantha touches her chin bringing her eyes back around. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) (signing and speaking) You understand? Hannah nods once, \"yes\". \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) Oksy. Come here. Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the back corner of the yard. A STORM SHELTER is buried in the ground just behind the pile. It's a grass covered mound with two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky. She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her pants. Staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh. Thunder rumbles low in the distance. She looks up at the approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks back inside. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside. \nEXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY \nTHUNDER STRIKE. The drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark soil into black mud. \nCurtis holds a rain slicker over his head. He watches as the hole they are drilling fills up with brown water. He lifts his boot, which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from the mud. Looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting up. He looks to Dewart, who smiles at him from behind the controls of the rig. \nDEWART What? It's not my fault! I told you! \nCURTIS Yeah. All right...All right! I'm callin' it! Shut it down! Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee. \nI/E. LAFORCHE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON Samantha holds the front door open as Nat and Cammie leave with their children packed up and in tow. It's raining pretty hard outside. \nSAMANTHA Bye guys. Thanks for coming over. \nNAT I'll call next week about the Lions Club supper. \nSAMANTHA Okay. Love you. \nCAMMIE Bye Sam. \nSAMANTHA Bye Cam. Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat. Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. The rain outside is the only noise. She heads to the kitchen. \nIN THE KITCHEN, Hannah is sitting Indian-style at the glass doors watching the rain. Samantha walks over and kneels down behind her. She wraps her arms around Hannah, who lifts a hand to the glass. \nCURTIS I'll get to it this weekend. It's quiet for a moment. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) I still take off my boots so I won't wake her up. She smiles up at her husband. \nSAMANTHA I still whisper. He pulls her tight. They stand together in the doorway. The house is silent. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY \nCurtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow. He keeps an eye on Hannah as she jumps on a small, plastic playscape in the middle of the backyard. The dog, Red, paces by the back door. He's agitated, but his movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his collar to a nearby post. He barks. \nTHUNDER STRIKES. Curtis flinches at the loud boom. He looks to the sky and sees dark clouds twisting overhead. Hannah plays, unaffected by the noise. To get a better view, Curtis moves from beneath a tree in the corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland that runs up to his property. Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete culvert that leads out to the open field. A giant STORM CELL gathers force on the horizon there. Red barks incessantly. He winces and strains against the rope tied to his collar. Curtis flinches again as A BOLT OF LIGHTNING streaks to the ground in the distance. Sparks shoot into the air leaving a circle of scorched crops. Another CRACK of thunder. \nA light rain begins. Red snaps his head around and bucks into the air. He gnashes at the rope. Curtis collects Hannah off the playscape and turns back to the approaching STORM CELL. He holds up his hand and studies the falling rain. It's the thick, amber colored liquid. With Hannah in his arms, Curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of THREE TORNADOS out in the field. Behind them, Red's teeth fray the rope at his collar. He thrashes his head, the rope SNAPS, and the dog flies toward Curtis and Hannah. Curtis turns to see Red charging them. He barely has time to set Hannah down before Red catches him by the forearm. They crash to the ground, tangled together. Rain coming down hard now. Curtis yells and waves Hannah back. Red, snapping, buries his teeth into the muscles in Curtis' arm. Blood streams from the wound. Curtis screams in pain. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nCurtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm. He grinds his teeth and doubles over in pain. It takes a moment for him to find his bearings. His breathing slows. He gently rubs his hand over the skin on his arm. Sweat has collected around his collar and temples. From the bed, sheets in a twisted mess, he looks around the room unsure of what just happened to him. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nEggs cool on a plate. Curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work. He stares vacantly at his breakfast. He looks up at Hannah. She sits on the floor surrounded by toy building blocks and plays with the dog. She rubs under Red's chest and in turn he licks her face. She smiles and gently pushes him away. Samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee. \nSAMANTHA Curtis? \nCURTIS What? \nSAMANTHA Did you hear me? You got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight. Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) What's wrong? \nCURTIS Nothing. I just want her to eat her breakfast and stop playin' with the damn dog. \nSAMANTHA She's fine down there. She had toast already. Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair. Curtis backs off, frustrated. Hannah climbs down from her chair and goes back to the floor and the dog. \nCURTIS Hannah. Come here. Hannah. \nSAMANTHA Curtis? \nCURTIS What? He stops and checks his watch. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) I'm late. \nSAMANTHA You didn't eat anything? Heading out. \nCURTIS It's okay. Curtis is gone. Samantha looks at Hannah on the floor with the dog. \nINT. DELTA AGRI-PRO MAIN OFFICE - DAY \nThe main headquarters of Delta Agri-Pro is housed in a giant metal building. A row of cheaply built, 70's style offices with drop tile ceilings line the left of a large warehouse that contains all manner of agricultural and construction equipment. Tractors, backhoes, welding rigs, etc. A GROUP OF MEN, many of which were represented at Gator's bar yesterday, sit in folding chairs or stand in a semi-circle around JIM THOMPSON(53). He speaks, clipboard in hand. \nI/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/HOUSE - EVENING The sun has just set adding a purple hue to the sky. Curtis steers his truck up to the front curb of his house. \nTHROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD, He sees Samantha standing by her car, the back door open. She watches him pull up. Hannah is already packed into her car seat. \nCURTIS \n(TO HIMSELF) Shit. \nPARKED, Curtis climbs out and walks to the driveway. \nSAMANTHA Come on we gotta go. \nCURTIS Ah, Jesus. I could really use a shower. \nSamantha isn't having it. She climbs in the passenger seat. Curtis makes his way to her car. \nINT. SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM - NIGHT \nCurtis' work boots are encased in dry mud. Chunks have broken off and pepper the thin blue industrial carpet. His mud-stained fingers tap on the top of a desk. Dirt caked under his nails. \nTEACHER (O.S.) So if you continue with the basic vocabulary, this will allow you to communicate with your children better. Curtis sits, filthy, at a school desk he doesn't quite fit into. A TEACHER speaks to a ROOM FULL of PARENTS. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) Between the ages of four and seven the focus is more on the sign and then later we'll begin adding the alphabet as more of a support syster. Now in ASL... Curtis looks over at Samantha, who is sitting in the desk next to him. She won't look at him. He cranes his neck around to see toward the back of the room. An ASSISTANT TEACHER sits on a large, colorful rug with a GROUP of CHILDREN, all different ages, playing games that teach hand signs. Hannah actively participates in the group. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) ...the male sign is signed at the forehead area. For example, father is signed up here like this...Father, very good. Curtis turns back in his chair and makes the sign for \"dad\" along with the other parents. \nINT. SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nCurtis, Samantha, and Hannah sit on the floor in a circle atop the colored rug. Samantha turns over large flashcards with illustrated scenes on them. They take turns making the corresponding sign. Curtis stares at Samantha, but she's still giving him the cold shoulder. Finally, while holding up a card, she looks at him. He signs, \"I'm sorry\". A fist moving in a circular motion at his chest. \nSAMANTHA You're not sorry. \nCURTIS I am sorry. She looks to Hannah and signs, \"swim\". \nSAMANTHA Well, you stink. You smell really bad. He smiles. \nCURTIS I think I smell good. She smiles, begrudgingly, and then signs to Hannah, \"Dad\" and \"stink\". Curtis turns to some ladies behind him. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Do I smell good? Samantha laughs and tries to cover his mouth with her hand. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) See. Maybe I should marry her instead. They continue to laugh. \nSAMANTHA Stop. \nINT. CURTIS' TRUCK - DAY \nCurtis slams the door to his truck, sealing him off from the torrential rainfall outside. He shakes water off, wipes his face. The windows are smeared by thick, dark rain. It's hard to see out. He looks over to Hannah sitting in her car seat. It looks odd on the front bench of the truck. He signs to her. \nCURTIS (signing and speaking) You okay? She nods. He cranks the truck and turns on the wipers. The liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges. Curtis leans forward to get a better view of the street. He checks his blind spot and pulls away. \nSAMANTHA You sure? \nCURTIS Yeah. (holds up the mug) Better already. Samantha walks to her purse on the counter and roots through to find a set of keys. \nSAMANTHA Okay. I got my phone if you need anything. Don't forget Sunday lunch is here tomorrow. This reminder makes Curtis rub his face with a grunt. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) If you're sick, we should cancel. \nCURTIS I'll be all right. \nSAMANTHA Okay, we'll talk later. She heads for the door with Hannah. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) Come on. Let's go. \n(TO CURTIS) You sure? \nCURTIS Honey, please. \nSAMANTHA Okay. Samantha scoops up her bag and takes Hannah by the hand. They leave the room. Curtis notices the dog, Red, sitting on his haunches looking at him. Curtis stares back, sipping his coffee. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY \nThe reverse lights shine as Curtis' pick-up rumbles backward. Curtis eyes the side mirror as he maneuvers the truck into his backyard. In the mirror, the trash pile comes into view. Just behind it, the STORM SHELTER doors appear. The truck shutters to a stop. Curtis studies the Shelter in the side mirror for a moment. A grassy bulge with angled metal doors peeking over the trash heap. He climbs out. A blue tarp is pulled from the bed of the truck, floating down to the yard. Curtis slips on a pair of work gloves and continues to eye the Storm Shelter. He yanks a bale of chain-link from the bed of the truck and carries it to the back corner of the yard. He steals another glance back toward the Shelter. \nDropping the bale, he sizes up the space. He looks to the sky. It's a beautiful day. He begins counting off steps from the back fence line. \nINT. FLEA MARKET - SERIES OF IMAGES - DAY \n-A linen sheet floats down over a folding table. -The hanging bag is placed on a portable clothes rod. -Hands place an assortment of home sewn crafts like napkins and embroidered pillows out onto the table. -A tackle box is opened revealing a tray of small bills and change. A calculator is removed. Hannah kneels in front of a folding chair behind their BOOTH at an open-air flea market. She uses the seat of the chair as a table for a tiny porcelain tea set. Samantha stands over her display table smiling and nodding at perusing CUSTOMERS. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - SERIES OF IMAGES - DAY \n-A mallet drives tall metal stakes into the ground. -The cord holding together the bale of chain-link is snipped and a boot rolls the fencing out flat. -Chain-link is attached to the stakes with a number of metal braids. -The prefab DOGHOUSE is set down in the back corner. Curtis stands in front of his newly created dog pen. It's waist high and about 7' X 10', tucked in the back left corner of the yard so that half of the pen is made up by the existing fencing. \nINT. FLEA MARKET - DAY \nSamantha turns to see a large woman holding up an intricately embroidered pillow. You can tell by the look of her that she's a flea market pro, a BARGAIN HUNTER(54). \nBARGAIN HUNTER How much you asking for this pillow? \nSAMANTHA This pillow's fifteen dollars. \nBARGAIN HUNTER That's more than I want to spend. \nSAMANTHA This is all hand stitched. It takes a really long time. That's why I charge that. \nBARGAIN HUNTER I'll give you seven for it. Samantha looks at the woman, who is almost daring her. \nSAMANTHA I can't go that low. \nSAMANTHA But that's what I don't understand. If he didn't do anything why did you put him out back? Samantha counts out the money earned at the flea market. She sets a portion aside and closes the tackle box. Curtis says something, but it's inaudible. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) What? She opens the tin and removes an envelope with the word \"BEACH\" written on it in black sharpie. Samantha adds the money to the envelope and puts up the jar. She opens the fridge and takes out the milk. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) You hear me? I said if he didn't do anything why did you have to put him outside? Curtis' attention is on the TV. Samantha sits on the couch. \nCURTIS I just wanted him to be outside for awhile. \nSAMANTHA He's your dog. He's always been an inside dog. \nCURTIS He's my dog, and that's why he's outside. Right now with Hannah and everything I just think it'd be better. \nSAMANTHA Hannah loves Red. \nCURTIS Hold on. Curtis stares at the television program. Samantha's eyes narrow. Frustrated, she flips open her magazine. \nNEWS ANCHOR ...the gas cloud spread across their six acre property. \n(MORE) \nNEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D) The only way off their land was across the train tracks which were blocked by wreckage. \nWALTER JACOBS (from a hospital bed) I tried using some wet rags and towels to breathe through but that just seemed to make it worse. \nNEWS ANCHOR While rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family, Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in- law died in the home. Jacobs survived despite enduring eleven hours of exposure to the gas cloud before finally being flown out by helicopter. \nCURTIS You hearin' this? Her nose still in the magazine. \nSAMANTHA It's awful. \nCURTIS Eleven hours. No way out. Samantha shakes her head. Curtis watches the footage of Walter Jacobs. He watches his red rimmed eyes. The deep lines in his face. \nINT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY \nIt's daytime, but the house feels dark from the storm blowing outside. The SOUND of rain pelts the windows and roof. Curtis, dressed for work, walks from his bedroom down the hallway. He passes the den and stops at its entryway. \nIN THE DEN, Hannah sits on the couch with her back to him. She's on her knees looking out one of the front windows. A dull orange glow halos from the bank of windows. What sunlight there is appears diffused by the dark, thick rain smearing down the outside of the glass. \nA THUNDER STRIKE. \nCurtis flinches. He shows concern as heavier rain begins battering the house. The wind picks up making wood beams creak on their foundation. \nCURTIS Hannah. Hannah doesn't move. She continues staring out the window. The SOUND of the storm outside intensifies. Windows begin to rattle in their frames. Curtis walks over and reaches for Hannah but is startled by the sight of a MAN'S FACE just outside the window. Hannah and the Man have been staring at one another. The Man, hollow eyed and pale, moves out of the window and out of sight. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Hey! Thunder CRACKS overhead. Curtis scoops Hannah into his arms and heads out of the room. BANG. The front door rattles. Curtis stops and turns back. BANG. BANG. The SOUND of someone kicking at the front door. The storm outside has grown to a deafening pitch. The power goes out. The entire house vibrates, like a freight train running across the roof. The BANGING at the front door continues, frame giving way, as the STORM reaches its apex. Curtis, holding Hannah, kneels and braces himself in the entryway to the den. He covers the back of Hannah's head with his hands and squeezes her tight into his shoulder. Then Silence. A stillness. The rain stops. No more banging at the front door. The SUN moves brightly though the front windows. \nWOOSH. The furniture in the den lifts off the ground. A couch, Lazyboy, coffee table and lamp. It all hangs in the air, floating for a moment. Quietly. Curtis watches, eyes wide. A rumbling. Grows. The SUNLIGHT vanishes. SMASH! The sound of the storm is sucked back into the room as the furniture crashes to the floor, breaking apart on impact. \nThe windows BLOW OUT. Curtis squeezes his eyes shut and pivots his body, trying to protect Hannah. Shards of glass splinter across his face. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE/EXAM ROOM - DAY \nCurtis sits, fully clothed, on the edge of a paper covered bench in the exam room. DOCTOR SHANNAN, an older man with a smoker's voice, enters smiling and gives a firm handshake. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN Curtis, how you doin' bud? \nCURTIS Hey Doc. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN How's my girl? \nThe Doctor turns to a small table in the corner and grabs a wooden tongue depressor and an otoscope from a drawer. \nCURTIS She's good. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN That's good to hear. Tilt your head back for me. The Doctor shines the otoscope into his nostrils. \nCURTIS I don't have a cold. The Doctor pauses and turns to check a chart on the table. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN Oh. Did she get that down wrong? \nCURTIS No, I just told her that. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN Oh. So what's the problem? \nCURTIS I've been havin'...I've been having some trouble sleepin'. I was hopin' you could give me somethin' for it. Doctor Shannan takes a seat on a rolling stool and processes the request. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN How long's this been goin' on? \nCURTIS `Bout four nights now. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN You're not sleepin' at all? \nCURTIS Well some, but real restless. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN Well, I think four nights is a little too soon to tell. My advice would be to not eat or drink anything after 8 o'clock at night. Cut back on any alcoholic drinks, tobacco, caffeine...get some daily exercise. \nCURTIS Well, I think... Curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) I think I may need to try some medication. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN Why do you say that? \nCURTIS \n(STILL RELUCTANT) The reason I've been having trouble sleeping is because of some dreams I've been havin'. I didn't think it was anything at first, but then the other day I woke up and the bed was wet. \nDOCTOR SHANNAN You urinated in your bed? \nCURTIS Yeah. Couple days before that I had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away. Doctor Shannan leans his back against the table and thinks about this. \n(BEAT) Okay. The Agent writes something down. \nINSURANCE AGENT (CONT'D) (into the phone) All right. And the phone. Well great. Thank you very much. The Agent hangs up the phone and rips a piece of paper from the pad in front of her. She hands it to Samantha. \nINSURANCE AGENT (CONT'D) This is the name and number of the specialist who the insurance company approves of. Just call and make an appointment. Now if this doctor signs off , you should have the implant procedure fully covered. I'm sorry it took so long. Samantha looks at the paper, impressed. \nSAMANTHA Can I give you a hug? \nINSURANCE AGENT It's fine. It's fine. You know your husband's company actually has very good insurance when it kicks in. Not a lot of jobs offer policies half as good. You're very lucky. \nINT. GROCERY STORE PHARMACY - DAY \nCurtis stands in line at the pharmacy located in the back corner of the grocery store. He approaches the counter and hands over his prescription to a female PHARMACIST. She disappears behind a divider as Curtis removes his wallet. He takes out an insurance card and runs his thumb over the bills. The Pharmacist returns with a stapled white bag. Curtis holds out the insurance card. \nPHARMACIST That's okay. We have your insurance on file. That'll be \nCURTIS What's the co-pay? \nPHARMACIST That is your co-pay. Curtis studies the small paper sack and removes three, 20 dollar bills from his wallet. \nINT. LAFORCHE HOME - EVENING \nCurtis enters the front door, closing it behind him. He turns and is met by Samantha, who wraps her arms around him. \nCURTIS Hey. She squeezes him. Then kisses him. \nSAMANTHA I love you. \nCURTIS I love you too. \nSAMANTHA I have good news. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER \nCurtis finishes off a dinner of roast and potatoes. Samantha sets the piece of paper the Insurance Agent gave her in front of him and begins clearing the table. Hannah draws on a piece of construction paper at the other end of the table. Samantha picks up a crayon and shows it to Hannah. \nSAMANTHA Green? How `bout a red? She pretends to use the crayon as lipstick. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) It was like talking to a sane person for once. She made one phone call. That's it. I've been trying that 800 number for weeks. \nCURTIS It's great. It's great. \n(TO HANNAH) Hey, Hannah. Hannah doesn't look up. He stands and goes over to her. Touches her shoulder and kneels beside her. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) You excited? Huh? We're gonna get you some help. Curtis touches his finger to her chest then stops. He can't think of the sign. He turns to Samantha. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) How do you say...sign excited? \nSAMANTHA Like this. Samantha shows him the sign. Curtis mimics. \nDEWART I don't know. You hear about people livin' for days all the time offa bark and melted snow. \nCURTIS I've never heard of that. \nDEWART Shit I don't know. You asked the question. \nCURTIS It's on there. It's on. Come on. \nCurtis steps back from the arm of the drill. Dewart taps the wrench on two bolts to make sure they are secure. \nA LOUD BOOM RATTLES. THUNDER. Curtis flinches at the sound. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Dammit. \nDEWART What? Curtis turns around and checks the sky. It's clear blue. Not a cloud in sight. \nCURTIS It sounds like thunder. \nDEWART What sounds like thunder? \nBOOM. ANOTHER THUNDER STRIKE. Curtis doesn't move. He watches Dewart walk to the controls of the drilling rig. \nMORE THUNDER. ROLLING NOW. Curtis steps back from the rig and checks the horizons. Nothing. It's a beautiful day. Dewart looks down at him. Curtis' face is pale, scared. Curtis looks at him. Not sure what to say. Curtis turns and walks to his truck. \nDEWART (CONT'D) Where you goin'? Curtis. Where you goin'? \nBY CURTIS' TRUCK, Curtis stops and rests his hands on the bed of the truck. Another THUNDER STRIKE makes him flinch. Curtis VOMITS next to the back tire. He quickly stands, wiping his mouth. He checks over his shoulders to see if anyone has seen him. \nI/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/RURAL HIGHWAY - MOVING - DAY Curtis studies his face in the rearview mirror as he sails down the rural highway. \nHe rubs his eyes with the back of his hand and looks in the side mirror. The horizon is still clear. Curtis begins to hyperventilate. Short breaths accompanied by cold sweat. Sucking air. He can't breath. He panics. The truck tires slide on the gravel shoulder as he abruptly slams on the brakes and steers off the highway. Dust settles outside as Curtis begins to get his breathing under control. He rests his head on the steering wheel and shuts his eyes tight. Everything quiets down. His breathing. The road. No more thunder. Curtis looks out his passenger window. His truck has stopped in front of a Tractor Trailer Depot. A rusted shipping container with giant white letters painted on it reads, \"CONTAINERS FOR SALE\". Curtis stares at this. He climbs out of the truck. \nEXT. TRAILER DEPOT - CONTINUOUS \nCurtis walks around his truck to get a better look at the depot. The dirt lot is piled high with containers. He studies the \"FOR SALE\" sign, then a smaller sign next to it that lists available sizes. Curtis turns back to his truck and rubs his face, still shaking things off. He looks up at the sky. Clear and blue. A thought comes to him. He checks his watch. \nI/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/INTERSTATE - DAY Curtis drives down a divided four-lane interstate. \nEXT. PLEASANT GROVE APARTMENTS - DAY \nCurtis' truck pulls into the parking lot of the Pleasant Grove Apartments. It's a well manicured, new construction facility. The words \"AN ASSISTED LIVING COMMUNITY\" are written under the apartment name on the sign out front. \nINT. ASSISTED LIVING APARTMENT/HALLWAY - DAY \nCurtis stands by the door for apartment 212 in an interior carpeted hallway. He knocks. \nA passing ATTENDANT guides an elderly WOMAN down the hallway. Curtis nods to them. The door opens. SARAH(61), a plainly dressed woman much too young to live in a nursing home, looks surprised. \nSARAH Curtis. \nSARAH No. Nothing like that. There was always... \n(MORE) \nSARAH (CONT'D) (searches for the words) There was always a panic that took hold of me. I thought people were watching me or listening to me. \nI... Sarah is remembering. Her face draws tight, frustrated. \nCURTIS It's all right. It's all right. It's fine. Sarah looks up and smiles. Her focus shifts back to her son. \nSARAH Are you okay? \nCURTIS Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Sarah looks back down to Hannah's photo. \nEXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe relatively new gas station sits just off the interstate. Curtis stands at the pump filling up his truck. He watches the numbers next to the dollar sign roll higher. He looks back at the busy freeway. Cars passing. The pump stops. The final amount reads, \"$68.79\". He hangs the hose back onto the pump and pulls a cell phone from his pocket. He dials and waits. \nCURTIS (into the phone) May I have the number for Doctor George Shannan? \n(WAITS) Thanks. Curtis, phone still at his ear, turns and watches the horizon. The sun hangs low in the sky. A reddish haze. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) (into the phone) Hi, is Doctor Shannan there? May I speak with him? This is Curtis LaForche. \n(WAITS) Hey Doc. Yeah, sorry...Sorry to call you at home, I just don't think I can make it to Columbus to see that psychiatrist. Yeah, it's just too far. Is there somewhere local you can send me? \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCurtis steps quietly into the bedroom. The lights are on, but Samantha has fallen asleep on top of the made bed. He empties his pockets on the dresser and Samantha wakes up. \nSAMANTHA Hey. \nCURTIS Oh, hey. Sorry I woke you up. \nSAMANTHA It's okay. Where you been? \nCURTIS I went to see mom. Samantha sits up in the bed. \nSAMANTHA Is she okay? \nCURTIS Mmm hmm. I just wanted to check up on her. \nSAMANTHA You shoulda told me we would have gone with you. \nCURTIS That's okay. Samantha lays back down, tucking herself under the covers. \nSAMANTHA Come to bed. \nCURTIS I will in a bit. Curtis finishes emptying his pockets. \nDEWART Jim came by. I covered for you. \nCURTIS Thanks. \nDEWART I need your help with the depth charts. \nCURTIS Sure. \nEXT. PUMP STATION CONSTRUCTION SITE/FARMLAND - LATER \nCurtis and Dewart sit on the drilling rig eating lunch. \nDEWART Fuckin' Nat put me in charge of frying oysters for that Lions Club supper. \nCURTIS You need another burner? \nDEWART Yeah, if you still got yours I could use it. \nCURTIS You think you could help me with somethin'? \nDEWART Whatta you need? \nCURTIS I'm gonna build out the tornado shelter in my backyard. I could use some help. \nDEWART The hell you wanna do that for? \nCURTIS Just needs to be done. Dewart eyes him, unsure. \nDEWART What do you need? \nCURTIS I figure I'll do it on Saturday, borrow some equipment from work. \nDEWART You sure about that? \nCURTIS I just need a backhoe, a hauler. I'll rent the rest. Dewart stares off into the distance. He notices Curtis looking at him, waiting for an answer. \nDEWART Yeah. Whatever. I'll help. \nCURTIS Thanks. \nDEWART You all right man? \nCURTIS What do you mean? \nDEWART I just don't wanna see you fuck up. \nCURTIS I'm not. \nEXT. TRAILER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOON \nCURTIS Yeah, I don't know my mother's symptoms. I was just 10. My brother was 17. And, uh...I don't know. She just left me in the car in the parking lot at the grocery store one day. And she didn't come back. And then they found her a week later eatin' trash out of a dumpster in northern Kentucky. \n(MORE) \nCURTIS (CONT'D) My dad had to put her in the state hospital in Columbus. And she's been in assisted living ever since. Yep. My dad raised me. He died last April. Kendra nods, a pleasant look on her face. \nKENDRA So tell me `bout these dreams. Curtis studies her face, bites at the inside of his cheek. \nINT. SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM - NIGHT \nThe class has finished. PARENTS and KIDS trickle out. Samantha stands off to the side speaking with the Teacher. \nSAMANTHA I don't know what our schedule will be, but... \nTEACHER That's all right. But I really do think you should continue with the sign language. And any additional therapies that kids need for the cochlear implant. \nSAMANTHA Absolutely. \nTEACHER Okay. Good night. \nSAMANTHA Good night. As Samantha talks to the Teacher, Curtis looks over flashcards with Hannah. He signs \"SUNSHINE\", a circle in the sky with the hand then coming down, fingers spread. \nI/E. SAMANTHA'S CAR/INTERSTATE - NIGHT Curtis drives while Samantha and Hannah sleep in the back. Surrounding farmland drops quickly into darkness joining a purple sky in the distance. Through the passenger window, a streak of lightning breaks across the horizon. Then another. Curtis, seeing this, repositions to get a better look through the window. It's horizontal lightning that appears to leap from cloud to cloud. Well defined bolts that strobe the night sky silhouetting towering thunderheads. \nCurtis looks back to Samantha and Hannah, still asleep. He pulls the car over to the shoulder of the interstate and continues watching. He climbs out. \nON THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE, Cars rush by as Curtis gently closes the car door. Keeping his eyes on the lightning storm, he walks to the shoulder. It's a fantastic display of light. Hurried and intense. A BOLT of lightning reaches down to the ground. Sparks pop off the earth in the distance. Another BOLT streaks down, getting closer. Curtis sees the traffic continuing to pass by at full speed. \nCURTIS \n(TO HIMSELF) Is anyone seeing this? Curtis walks to the back window of the car and sees Samantha sleeping inside. He reaches out to knock but stops himself. He turns back to the lightning and watches. \nINT. DELTA AGRI-PRO MAIN OFFICE - DAY \nThe giant rolling door curls up in the Delta Agri-Pro warehouse. Sunlight bounces off the finished concrete. Curtis pulls the chain for the door as Dewart slams the tow latch down on the back of a DUMP TRUCK. \nI/E. FLEA MARKET/LAFORCHE HOME - SERIES OF IMAGES - DAY -The Dump Truck and Tow Trailer sit parked on the street in front of Curtis' house. Dewart stands at the back of the trailer with his hand on the ramp lever as Curtis reverses a BACKHOE onto the street. -Samantha works her booth at the flea market. Hannah neatly organizes a collection of colored beads on the floor. -A 20 foot rectangle has been outlined in bright orange paint next to the storm shelter in Curtis' backyard. Other colored markings denote gas and water lines. The bucket on the Backhoe digs into the center of the dotted rectangle. -Dewart maneuvers the Backhoe's bucket and drops a load of earth into the bed of the Dump Truck. Red, the dog, barks at the loud machinery from his pen. \n-Curtis uses a smaller trench digging machine on the backside of the yard, radiating out from the main dig site. He notices a NEIGHBOR watching him from they yard next door. -Samantha tallies cash from the tackle box she uses as a register. Hannah counts out the change. -Dewart assembles a series of PVC pipe next to the trenches Curtis dug. -Curtis, work goggles on, stands in a head deep hole holding a pneumatic jack hammer up to the exposed exterior wall of the storm shelter. He begins hammering. \nEXT. LAFORCHE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON \nSamantha's car pulls up and parks on the opposite side of the street from their house. She gets out, puzzled by the Backhoe and Trailer parked in front of her house. Huge light brown tracks of dirt stripe the concrete driveway. Leading Hannah by the hand, Samantha follows the tracks to the backyard. \nIN THE BACKYARD, Samantha stops, mouth agape, stunned by what she sees. A 20 foot by 8 foot wide hole that is 10 feet deep sits in the middle of her yard. Smaller trenches lead out from it. Dewart leans against the propane tank in the back corner of the yard. He digs dirt from underneath his fingernails with a pocket knife. Seeing Samantha, he waves a hand. Curtis' head appears from the hole. He stops when he sees Samantha. They stare at one another. He can see her surprise. He continues up the ladder and walks over to her. Dewart watches from the back of the yard. \nCURTIS Hey. It's all right. Calm down. Samantha takes Hannah into the house without saying a word. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Samantha. \nCURTIS (into the phone) No. It's fine. It's fine. Don't send an ambulance. It's fine. Curtis clicks off the phone. \nSAMANTHA What are you doing? Curtis wraps his arms around her. He holds her tight. The SOUND of ambulance sirens approach from the distance. Samantha speaks, her voice trembling. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) Baby what's goin' on? \nEXT. LAFORCHE HOME - NIGHT \nThe ambulance lights splash across the house. Curtis escorts TWO EMTs down the front walk. He favors his left leg, walking with a slight limp. \nCURTIS I'm sorry you fellows had to come all the way out. \nEMT It's what we do. Now we can still take you in if you want a doctor to look at those cuts in your mouth. \nCURTIS Yeah. That's all right.. I'll see somebody on Monday. \nEMT All right. \nCURTIS Thanks. Curtis shakes their hands. He turns to walk back in the house and notices NEIGHBORS watching from their porches. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCurtis turns up a bottle of peroxide and swishes it in his mouth. It burns. He spits into the kitchen sink. Samantha sits at the table watching him. Concerned, scared. She holds a balled up tissue in her hand. Curtis takes a seat across the table. She waits for him to say something. \nCURTIS I haven't been honest with you. I'm sorry. \nSAMANTHA What's goin' on? \nCURTIS I've been havin' these dreams. I guess they're more like nightmares. It's why I've been actin' like this. Samantha listens with a furrowed brow. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) They always start with a kind of storm. Like a real powerful storm. \n(MORE) \nCURTIS (CONT'D) And there's always this dark, thick rain. Like fresh motor oil. And then the things, people, it just makes `em crazy. They attack me. Sometimes they go after Hannah. First one I had Red nearly chewed through my arm. \nSAMANTHA That's why you put him out back? \nCURTIS Yeah. \nSAMANTHA What was the dream? Tonight. \nCURTIS It was Dewart. We were at the job site. The storm started and somethin' happened. His face. His eyes were different. He came after me with a pick ax. And we fought. And he ran it through my leg. Curtis zones out for a moment. Samantha says nothing. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) It's hard to explain, because it's not just a dream. It's a feeling. I'm afraid something might be comin'. Something that's...not right. I can not describe it. I just need you to believe me. Samantha's eyes are red. Her nose. She nods slightly and dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) I've been to a counselor. I've seen her a few times. This makes Samantha look up. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) You know what I come from. And I promised myself...I promised myself I would never leave. And I am doin' everything that I can to make that true. The room is quiet. Samantha watches her husband. \nCURTIS I'm not. Kyle is staring him down. Curtis just looks at the shelter. There's a long silence shared between them. \nKYLE Samantha called me. \nCURTIS I figured. Curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues installing the roof vent. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Called you to come tell me to quit? \nKYLE She called `cause she's worried. Says you've been stressed out. Curtis doesn't answer. \nKYLE (CONT'D) So? \nCURTIS So what? \nKYLE You stressed out? \nCURTIS No. No more than anybody else. \nKYLE Work all right? \nCURTIS Uh, huh...Hey, look. You wanna come by and have dinner sometime, Kyle. That's fine. We'll have a beer and talk about the old days, but you got somethin' to say just say it. \nKYLE You can stop that shit right now. I'll come over there and remind you what it feels like to get your ass whipped. Curtis keeps his head down, scolded. Kyle relents. \nKYLE (CONT'D) I'm just coming here to check on you. \nCURTIS Well I appreciate it Kyle. \nKYLE You been to see Mom? \nCURTIS Yeah. A few days ago. \nKYLE She all right. \nCURTIS You should see her. Take your girls. \nKYLE Yeah. I'll get around to it. There's an awkward moment as Curtis works with his back to Kyle. \nKYLE (CONT'D) You need a hand? Curtis turns and looks up at him. Shakes his head. \nCURTIS No. I've got it. Kyle nods. \nKYLE Okay. Call me if you need me okay? \nCURTIS I will. Kyle looks at him for a moment. He turns and walks toward the driveway. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Hey Kyle? Kyle turns back. Curtis climbs onto the yard and walks over to him. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Actually you could do me a favor. \nJim, Curtis' boss, stands with his hands on his hips looking down at the planted shipping container. Curtis approaches. \nCURTIS Hey Jim. \nJIM Curtis. Dewart told me you took equipment from work for a project at your house. Said that's why you wanted him off your crew. I came out here to see it myself. \nCURTIS Yeah. It was just a hauler and a backhoe. It was Saturday. I had `em back in less than 8 hours. \nJIM You know that doesn't matter. I can't even tell you how many rules you broke. \n(MORE) \nJIM (CONT'D) What if you had an accident? Huh? What if you ran somebody over on your way out here? Lawsuit like that could bankrupt me. \nCURTIS Well, I'm sorry Jim. I hadn't thought of that. Thank God nothin' like that happened. You know? I'll do whatever I can to make it right. \nJIM You can pick up your last check on Friday. You've got two weeks benefits. Curtis nods. Accepts it. \nCURTIS Did you fire Dewart? \nJIM He's on two weeks leave unpaid... I'm sorry Curtis. You did this to yourself. Jim turns and walks out of the backyard. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nSamantha clears the table. Hannah sits, watching her father walk in. Curtis stops just inside the door, closes it. \nCURTIS I've been fired. Samantha continues clearing the dishes to the sink. She doesn't look up. \nSAMANTHA What about the health insurance? \nCURTIS We get two more weeks. Samantha slams the plates into the sink. They break. She holds her head back and stares at the ceiling. She walks over to Curtis... \nCURTIS (CONT'D) I'm sorry... ...and SLAPS him across the face. Hannah begins to cry. \nSamantha turns and collects Hannah from the table. She grabs her things and walks out of the house. Curtis stands alone in the kitchen. \nINT. AR COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER/HALLWAY - DAY \nCurtis walks down the hallway to Kendra's office. The door ajar, he knocks and enters. \nINT. KENDRA'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nCurtis finds ANDY(42), a man in khakis and a button up, sitting behind the desk. \nCURTIS Oh, `scuse me. Andy rises from his chair. \nANDY Are you Curtis? \nCURTIS Yeah. \nINT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - EVENING \nSamantha tucks Hannah into bed. She kisses her on the head and turns out the bedside lamp. Samantha leaves the room. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - EVENING \nSamantha steps out of the house. She walks over to Curtis, who is standing on a grassy section of the yard over an assortment of auto parts. They don't speak for a moment. \nSAMANTHA What's that? \nCURTIS That's the alternator from the truck. \n(MORE) \nCURTIS (CONT'D) I was just trying to figure out a way to charge enough batteries to run lights down there. Ah, what the hell? Maybe I'll hook it up to your old exercycle. Samantha almost smiles. Curtis keeps his eyes on the parts. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) You gonna leave me? Samantha looks at his hands. They hang by his sides. \nSAMANTHA You flinched when I touched your hand this morning. \nCURTIS I'm sorry. \nSAMANTHA I was in one of your dreams? Curtis nods. \nCURTIS Yeah. \nSAMANTHA Can you deal with that? He holds open his hand to her. She takes it. \nCURTIS Yeah. \nSAMANTHA Okay. Then I made a decision. We cancel the beach trip. We have enough to cover bills for the next two months with your last check. I'm going to get a job. You're gonna find another job. I'm going to call to see if we can move Hannah's surgery up. We'll need to see what it costs to extend your policy to the end of the year. I want you to see a psychiatrist. Not a counselor from the free clinic. Someone good. \nCURTIS Doctor Shannan gave me the number of somebody. But, uh, I just don't think we can afford it. \nSAMANTHA We'll find the money. Also, the Lions Club supper's this weekend. I want you to come with me. \nCURTIS I don't want to see any of those people. \nSAMANTHA I want you to go. I need to do something normal. \nCURTIS All right. Curtis nods. Samantha let's go of his hand and walks back to the house. Curtis goes back to studying the auto parts. \nINT. LIONS CLUB LODGE - NIGHT \nThe inside of the club is a musty banquet hall with wood panelled walls and a drop tile ceiling. The place is packed. Rows of folding tables fill the center of the room. A long LINE has formed along the side wall that wraps to a serving station at the back. Heated metal bins filled with fried oysters and french fries. Curtis gets in line with his family. \nAT THE SERVING TABLE, Curtis holds two paper plates. \nCURTIS How many pieces does Hannah get? \nCURTIS (CONT'D) (signing and speaking) You feel it? You feel it? Hannah walks to her mother. Samantha holds onto her. Curtis steps back from them. They watch him, their backs to the doors. He flinches and covers his mouth. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) I'm sorry. \nSAMANTHA Baby, there's no storm outside. \nCURTIS I'm sorry. Samantha walks over to him. \nSAMANTHA Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We love you very much. Please open the door. Curtis is on the verge of tears. He slowly reaches into his jeans pocket. He removes the keys. He holds them out to Samantha. \nCURTIS I'm sorry. I can't. Samantha looks at the keys, then at Curtis. Tears shake from his trembling face. \nSAMANTHA I love you, but if I open the door, then nothin's gonna change. You'll see that everything's fine, but nothing will change. Please. This is what it means to stay with us. This is something you have to do. He looks at Hannah, then Samantha. Curtis steadies himself, trying to control his flinching. He wipes his face with the back of his hands and takes a deep breath. Curtis walks toward the doors. On the steps, he reaches up to the padlock. The keys shake in his fingers. He turns to Samantha. \nCURTIS Could you move Hannah back? \nSamantha picks Hannah up in her arms and Curtis watches them retreat to the rear wall. He goes back to the lock. He inserts the key. The padlock pops open. Curtis removes it. He looks back at Samantha, then flings open the doors. \nSUNLIGHT. It's blinding. Curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes. He stares up at a crystal blue sky. Samantha watches as Curtis steps out of the shelter. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nCurtis rises through the storm shelter's entryway. Out of the corner of his eye he catches, \nA MAN PASSING BY. Curtis is startled. He turns to see a CREW of MEN from the power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner of the house. A power line dangles overhead. He turns to see NEIGHBORS in their yards clearing debris. Leaves and branches clutter the ground. The aftermath of a storm. Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah. She surveys the damage. \nCURTIS It's fine. She walks over to Curtis and hugs him. He kisses Samantha on the head. Curtis looks up at the sky. \nINT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - DAY \nCurtis sits with Samantha in the plush office of a PSYCHIATRIST(56). Curtis rubs his hand over the soft leather upholstery on the couch. \nPSYCHIATRIST Do you have any vacation time that you could use? \nCURTIS I don't have a job right now. \nPSYCHIATRIST Well, I know that times are hard, but I think it's really important for you to separate yourself from that storm shelter. \n(MORE) \nPSYCHIATRIST (CONT'D) I think you need to break away from it for awhile. We can start you on some medication that I think will help, but that action alone would mean a lot. \nSAMANTHA We usually go on a trip to Myrtle Beach every summer. We were gonns go this month. \nPSYCHIATRIST I think that would be okay if we start the medication now. It would give you all some time to prepare as a family, but I want to be clear, when Curtis gets back he'll need to take more time than that. \nSAMANTHA What does that mean? \nPSYCHIATRIST I mean that he'll need hands on therapy at a real facility. Curtis looks up for the first time. \n", "test1_input": "INT. BEDROOM - LATER \nCurtis strips the sheets off the bed. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nThe laundry room is a stackable set squeezed into a closet off the hallway. Curtis loads the sheets into the washer and presses start. Watching the clothes spin, a thought. \nINT. DEN - DAY \nCurtis pushes Hannah's shoe onto her foot. He stops with the shoes to concentrate. He moves his index finger from one shoulder to the other and speaks. \nCURTIS We're going out. Confused, she slices her finger down an open palm. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) (with open palms) We're going out. Okay? It's okay. \nEXT. GRAFTON PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY \nCurtis leads Hannah up the front walk of the Grafton Public Library. It's a one-story brick building with 1960's architecture. The parking lot is nearly empty behind them. \nINT. GRAFTON PUBLIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nCurtis holds the glass front door open for Hannah. They stop in the entryway and survey the LIBRARY. There are only a few people, one of which is the LIBRARIAN sitting behind a central desk. It is an open room with cinder block walls painted in brightly colored shapes. \nCurtis finds the children's section to the left and leads Hannah over. She takes a seat at a kid's size table as Curtis grabs a Dinosaur book from a nearby display. Kneeling in front of her, Curtis shows her the book and motions with open hands to the ground. \nCURTIS You stay put okay? Hannah begins looking through the book. Curtis stands, he sees a set of computers under a sign reading, \"CATALOGUE\". \nAT THE COMPUTERS, Curtis takes a seat in front of one of the two computers set up on a folding table. He eyes the search screen. Title, Author, Subject. He clicks on \"Subject\" and types the word \"DREAMS\". He scrolls through a list of titles and writes down a number. He looks back for Hannah. She's still flipping through her book. No one else is around. He begins another search. He types \"MENTAL ILLNESS\". \nAT THE BOOK SHELVES, Curtis scans the spines looking for his title. He already holds two books against his chest. He pulls out a thick hard cover book. The title reads, \"Understanding Mental Illness.\" \nI/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/GRAFTON STREETS - MOVING - DAY Hannah is once again strapped into her car seat. She holds a big children's book in her hands. They pass a Grocery Store. Curtis turns as it goes by.

The cart is filled with an assortment of supplies: Batteries, canned food, first aid supplies, matches. \nINT. LAFORCHE HOME/DINING ROOM - DAY \nSamantha sits in the dining room at a fully dressed table. Steam rises off bowls of mashed potatoes and green beans. Fried chicken piled on a platter. MELVIN(58) taps his finger on the empty plate in front of him and subtly checks his watch. JANINE(57) smooths out the embroidered table cloth. KATHRYN(37) and CHARLIE(39) tend to their child, REX(3). Rex repeatedly jams a finger into the potatoes. \nSAMANTHA Let's just start. \nMELVIN Let's all join hands for the blessing. The SOUND of the front door opening. Samantha gets up and leaves the room. \nBY THE FRONT DOOR, Curtis has Hannah in his arms. He closes the door. Samantha appears behind them. She speaks in a hushed, angry voice. \nSAMANTHA Where the hell have you been? \n", "test1_true": "SAMANTHA You're really late. \nCURTIS I know. \nSAMANTHA You didn't even bring your cell phone. Samantha heads back to the dining room. Curtis sucks his teeth. \nINT. LAFORCHE HOME/DINING ROOM - LATER \nPotatoes dalloped, chicken passed, the table is active with the family serving and eating. Curtis watches it all, somehow separated from it. He's exhausted. \nMELVIN Missed you at church this mornin' Curtis. \nSAMANTHA Dad. \nMELVIN He knows what to do if he wants me to stop askin'. Curtis looks at him. \nCURTIS Was it a good service? \nMELVIN It was. It was good work. Curtis nods. The family in front of him eats the meal. \nCURTIS I'm thinking about cleaning up that storm shelter out back. They look at him. \nINT. LAFORCHE HOME/HALLWAY - EVENING \nLight from the open closet door cuts a shape in the relatively dark hallway. Curtis roots through the back of the closet. \nINT. STORM SHELTER - SERIES OF IMAGES - NIGHT \n-Curtis sweeps the concrete floor of the storm shelter. A Coleman camping lantern sits on the wooden bench attached to the back wall. It casts an odd light up into the room. -Curtis places cans of food onto metal shelves. -Curtis flips through keys on his key ring. He adds the two small padlock keys to the ring. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSamantha sits on the bed in her pajamas applying lotion to her legs. She wipes the remainder on her knuckles and looks at the empty spot on Curtis' side of the bed. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nSamantha walks into the kitchen and turns off the overhead light. She pauses, seeing something in the backyard. She stops at the back door and stares out at the storm shelter. The camp lantern's orange light glows through the open metal doors. She watches for a moment. \nINT. STORM SHELTER - CONTINUOUS \nThe shelter has been cleaned up. The metal shelves hold canned food, water jugs and first aid supplies. Blankets and pillows are stacked on the other side of the room. Curtis sits in the back corner of the shelter on the wooden bench. He flips through one of the books from the library. The cover reads, \"DREAM ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION\". The book on mental illness sits by his feet. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE/RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nThe Doctor's Office is a converted one-story residential house. Curtis slouches in a faux leather chair grouped in the small reception area. He has nodded off. His head snaps up. He sucks air through his nose and sits up in his chair. He sees a WOMAN(25) reading a children's book aloud to her DAUGHTER(3) on a colorful rug in the corner. A door opens and a NURSE with a clipboard steps out. \nNURSE Curtis? Curtis stands and follows the nurse out of the room. \n", "test1_id": 66, "test2_input": "CURTIS Yes sir. I appreciate that but... well it would just be very helpful in this case. \nJIM Okay. Well, I can put him with Russell. Anybody else you prefer? \nCURTIS No. Whoever you think's right. \nJIM Okay. \nCURTIS Thank you. Curtis turns to leave the office. \nJIM You been missin' a lotta work Curtis. \nCURTIS I know. My daughter's had a lot of doctor's visits. I haven't let anything get behind. \nJIM No. But don't. Okay. \nCURTIS Yessir. Curtis shows himself out. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - EVENING \nThe sun has just set and a purple hue hangs over everything. Curtis stands in the very back of the yard and watches a MAN guide a long, flatbed trailer up the driveway. An 18 foot metal SHIPPING CONTAINER rides on the back. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nNat and Samantha sit at the kitchen table going over a list of food in a note pad. \nSAMANTHA I know they just usually do oysters and fries but what if we did something healthier on the side? \nNAT What like slaw? Nat gets up to refill her drink. She looks out the back door and surveys the construction zone. A FORKLIFT lowers the Shipping Container into the giant hole in the backyard. Nat shakes her head. \nSAMANTHA I don't know. Maybe a vegetable or salad. \nNAT Dewart's been tellin' me how strange Curtis has been actin' lately. I am so sorry. Nat brings her drink back to the table and sits. Samantha doesn't look up from her pad. \nNAT (CONT'D) It's not like you don't have enough on your plate with Hannah. Nat puts her hand on Samantha's. Samantha moves it. \nSAMANTHA Things are fine. We're fine. Nat smiles sympathetically. \nINT. ARMY NAVY STORE - DAY \nCurtis meanders inside. He sees police tactical and survival gear behind the counter. Chief among them is a collection of gas masks hanging on the rear partition. \nOWNER Can I help you? \nCURTIS Yeah. Can I look at one of these gas masks? \nOWNER Sure. Which one you want to look at? \nCURTIS The newest one. The OWNER of the store removes a mask and hands it to him. Curtis fiddles with the mask. \n", "test2_true": "OWNER One seventy eight. Curtis frowns at the price. \nCURTIS Anything cheaper? \nOWNER No. That's the cheapest one I got in the store. They go all the way up to two ninety. I don't know what you want to spend but a gas mask ain't something you want to go cheap on. \nCURTIS You got any kids sizes? \nOWNER No. Kids can't wear those. They got a have a special thing, its like a hood. I don't fool with those. Curtis nods. The perusing Shopper listens in. \nCURTIS Yeah. Ring me up a couple of `em. \nEXT. ARMY NAVY PARKING LOT - DAY \nCurtis stands at the driver's door of his pick-up. The box sits on the seat in front of him. He opens it and removes one of the gas masks. He stares into its vacant plastic eyes. He drops the mask back into the box and shakes his head. Sighs, frustrated with it all. He checks over his shoulder, scans the parking lot. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - LATER \nCurtis stands on top of the shipping container that rests in the hole roughly a foot below the yard. Wearing tinted goggles, he cuts a circular hole in the top of the container with a small blowtorch. The sparks stop and Curtis raises the goggles to inspect his work. He kicks at the weld with the heel of his boot and the metal falls into the container. \nHe sets down the torch and removes a roof turbine vent from a cardboard box and holds it up next to the newly cut hole. \nKYLE (O.S.) What the hell are you doin'? Curtis smiles to himself. He turns to find KYLE(42) standing at the edge of the hole. His hands are tucked into the back of his jeans and he's sizing up the work. Curtis steps off the roof of the shipping container onto ground level. He holds out a hand and Kyle shakes it, never taking his eyes off the unfinished shelter. \nKYLE (CONT'D) What you got goin' on here? \nCURTIS Just addin' on to the storm shelter. \nKYLE Why? \nCURTIS Just `cause. Kyle notices the PVC piping running in the trenches. \nKYLE You runnin' water to it? \nCURTIS Oh, yeah. From our well. Runnin' sewer out to the city line. \nKYLE How much you spendin' on this thing? \nCURTIS It's not bad. \nKYLE Doesn't look it. Curtis shrugs. Kyle sees his reluctance. \nKYLE (CONT'D) You take your eye off the ball one minute in this economy and you're screwed. You got the cash for this? \nCURTIS Yeah. \nKYLE Don't put nothin' on credit cards. That shit'll eat you up. \n", "test2_id": 67, "test3_input": "CURTIS (CONT'D) Sleep well in your beds. Cause if this thing comes true, there ain't gonna be any more. Curtis looks down at Dewart. He turns to see Hannah. She's tucked under her Mother's leg crying. This hits him hard. He stops. Looking at Samantha, his eyes fill with tears. \nSamantha, leading Hannah by the hand, walks to Curtis. He stares at her, on the verge of breaking down. She takes her hand and gently pulls his head down to her shoulder. Without another look toward the crowd, Samantha leads her family out of the dining hall. \nEXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY \nHannah stands on a toolbox and rests her elbows on the side of Curtis' truck. The hood is open. She watches her father fiddle with re-installing the alternator. His fingers covered in grease. Hannah steps down from the toolbox and walks into the front yard. Curtis pauses, hearing a high-pitched, warbling SOUND in the distance. He notices Hannah is gone. \nCURTIS Hannah? He pulls his head out from the hood and sees Hannah standing on the curb. She looks down the street. He runs down his driveway, wiping his hands on a rag and watching the horizon. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) Hannah! A FLOCK OF BIRDS, flying in intricate geometric patterns, swarm above the house at the end of the street. They twist and bend into speckled black shapes. Hannah, watching, walks into the street. Curtis catches her by the hand. He turns away from the birds to see a STORM CELL building on the opposite horizon. He scoops Hannah into his arms, stepping back from it. The SOUND of the birds grows louder. Curtis pivots to find the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him. He turns away as the wall of birds crash past him. The force so powerful it knocks him backward. He covers Hannah's head, dodging the onslaught of wind and wings. The Flock passes. Curtis stands, his face cut and scraped. Hannah cries, clinging to his chest. \nSMASH! The windshield of a car parked next to him SHATTERS. Curtis looks at the broken glass. A dead bird, it's neck broken, rests crumpled on the hood. \nSMACK! \nAnother bird crashes into the asphalt just in front of him. Then another. Curtis looks up. The Flock of birds are circling overhead and diving down at him. More birds crashing to the ground. Curtis covers his head. The neighborhood's tornado SIRENS begin to sound. Curtis rushes Hannah toward his front door as dozens of birds plummet from the sky. The sirens BLARING. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCurtis wakes to Samantha shaking him by the shoulders. She's nearly on top of him in the bed. \nSAMANTHA Curtis! Wake up! Wake up! TORNADO SIRENS continue to scream throughout the neighborhood. Curtis looks to the window. Rain and hail are battering the house. He jumps to his feet and grabs Samantha by the arm. They rush out of the room. \nINT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCurtis bursts into the room. Hannah is standing at the window looking out. Curtis scoops her up, scaring her. She begins to cry as they run from the room. \nEXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - NIGHT \nWind blows fiercely as pellets of hail bounce off the ground. Rain cuts at a sharp angle. The Tornado Sirens continue. Curtis, Hannah in his arms and Samantha close behind, exits the back of the house and heads to the storm shelter. He passes Hannah to Samantha and fumbles with the padlock keys. At the doors to the shelter, Samantha holds her robe up to shield Hannah from the hail. Curtis gets the lock and opens the door. They go inside. \nINT. STORM SHELTER - CONTINUOUS \nCurtis slams the doors behind them. It's pitch black until he gets to the switch on the lantern. The room fills with the orange glow as Curtis snaps the padlock through the door handles. \nCURTIS Come on. It's okay. Curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of the shelter. Samantha takes Hannah and sits with her on one of the cots. She's signing to her, trying to calm her down. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) It's okay. All right. Come on. Sit down. Curtis goes to a trunk in the corner and begins rooting through it. He removes two gas masks and an oxygen mask connected to a small tank. He goes over and kneels in front of Hannah. He tries slipping the oxygen mask over her face. Samantha grabs his wrist. \nSAMANTHA No. Don't do that. \nCURTIS It's okay. It's oxygen. Here. Put this on. Curtis hands Samantha a gas mask. \nSAMANTHA Are you kidding? \nCURTIS Please just do it. Okay? He looks to Hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face.. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) There we go. All right. Keep it out of your eyes. Okay? He signs to her. \n", "test3_true": "The camping lantern on the floor casts long shadows up. The faint boom of thunder rolls softly outside. The family sits huddled together on the cot, wearing their masks. \nINT. STORM SHELTER - LATER \nA CRACK of thunder rattles the shelter. Curtis snaps awake, still wearing his gas mask. Samantha has climbed on the other cot and is asleep. Hannah sleeps under Curtis' arm. He gently lays her down on the cot and stands to stretch. He walks into the original section of the shelter and grabs a small flashlight off the metal shelving. He clicks it on and moves over to the concrete steps. He takes a seat and listens. He places his hand onto the metal door. A BOOM of thunder. He can hear the rain and wind blowing outside. \nINT. STORM SHELTER - LATER \nSamantha rubs Curtis' shoulder, gently waking him. \nSAMANTHA Wake up babe. Curtis' head moves. He sees that Samantha and Hannah have removed their masks. \nCURTIS Where's your mask? \nSAMANTHA We took them off. It's fine. Take it off. \nCURTIS No. Curtis hesitates. \nSAMANTHA We're fine. Take it off. Curtis slips the mask off his face. Worried, he takes a breath. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) You need to open the door now. \nCurtis doesn't move. He looks at them. \nCURTIS \n(MUMBLES) What if it's...What if it's not over? \nSAMANTHA What? \nCURTIS What if it's not over? \nSAMANTHA It's over. Get the keys. Open the door. Curtis slowly gets to his feet. He sees the dark entryway to the original section of the shelter. Taking the lantern, he walks to it. Samantha and Hannah follow. Curtis stops just inside. He holds the lantern up, illuminating the padlocked metal doors. He looks back at his family, then climbs the steps. He places his hand on the door. He flinches. \nCURTIS It's still storming. \nSAMANTHA No. It's not. \nCURTIS I can hear it. Samantha stares at him. The room is silent. \nSAMANTHA I don't hear anything. \nCURTIS Put your hand on the door. You can feel it. He takes Samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors. He watches her face as she places a hand against the metal. She looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head \"no\". Curtis kneels in front of Hannah and mimics the signs from earlier. \nCURTIS (CONT'D) (signing and speaking) Thunder? Do you feel it? \nHe flinches again. Looks to the ceiling \n", "test3_id": 68}

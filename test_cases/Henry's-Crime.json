{"test1_input": "After a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs his sleeve. \nBEHIND HIM In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two guys slipping on SKI MASKS... \nHENRY'S POV A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his store and enters. He says good morning to all the animals. It's a strange one man show. \nLOUD ALARMS BLARE -- Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming \nFROM : \nTHREE GUYS IN SKI MASKS Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK GUARD chases them. ON HENRY, confused. A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun : \nFRANK (O.S.) You! Henry turns forward again. \nA GUN Is pointing at him through the windshield. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Freeze! Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel. Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder. Holding on Henry's stunned expression... \nINT. POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nHenry sits at a small table as a DETECTIVE, whose face we never see, paces back and forth. \nDETECTIVE Henry, we know this wasn't your deal. \nHenry just listens. \nDETECTIVE (CONT'D) All you have to do is give me those names. And you can go home. It's that simple. Henry's still silent. \nDETECTIVE (CONT'D) Come on. Why are you sticking up for these people? They're not your friends. You've got a wife. You've got a job... don't you care? \n(THEN) All you have to do is say something. Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first time. \nJUDGE (V.O.) ...in light of the fact that this is a first offence... \nINT. BUFFALO COURTROOM - DAY \nHenry stands in a suit, flanked by his state-appointed ATTORNEY. Debbie sits in the gallery. A JUDGE stares at Henry. \nJUDGE ...the court sentences Henry Torne to four years in prison for the crime of Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery. \nWHACK! The gavel goes down. Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with the sentence. He pats Henry, well done. Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him... \nCLANK! A CELL DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT... \nINT. PRISON CELL - DAY \nHenry, wearing a prison jumpsuit, watches as the guard locks the door in front of him. \nMAX (O.S.) So. What're you in for? \nHenry turns. \nHENRY Huh. \nMAX I said what are you in for? A beat. \nHENRY Bank robbery. MAX (60s) pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET. \nMAX Good. Clean. Simple. I like it. Henry just watches. \nHENRY But I didn't do it. Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands. \nMAX Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial favorite. Identities are just constructs, anyway. They're mistaken all the time. He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry. \nMAX (CONT'D) I'm Max. \nHENRY Henry. \nMAX Go on. Make yourself at home. Henry sits down on his bed. \nHENRY So...what are you in for? \nMAX Life. A beat. It's starting to hit Henry... \nMAX (CONT'D) Don't worry, you'll get used to it. \nINT. PRISON CELL - MORNING \nAll the cell doors SLAM open. Henry startles awake. Max is already dressed. \nMAX Hurry up. We gotta go. Henry's disoriented. \nMAX (CONT'D) Breakfast. A GUARD, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton against the bars of the cell. \nINT. DINING ROOM - DAY \nMax and Henry move along a line of convicts waiting for their food. \n", "test1_true": "MAX (CONT'D) What are you thinking about? \nHENRY Nothing. \nMAX You're thinking something. Let me guess. You're thinking, `How did I get here?' Henry puts out his tray. \nMAX (CONT'D) How do you think any of us got here? \nHENRY I'm not sure. \nMAX I'll tell you how. Because we committed crimes. But we committed to the wrong thing. You see that was our mistake. We didn't fulfill our potential, we got angry and we took it out on other people. A bald, TATTOOED GANG-BANGER walks right past them to a table. \nMAX (CONT'D) See him? \nHenry nods. \nMAX (CONT'D) Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He could've been, but he chose not to fulfil his potential, he chose not to commit to his dream. And now look at him. \n(THEN) Bad choices, see. Henry does. \nMAX (CONT'D) By the way, I recommend the potatoes. \nINT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMax and Henry sit down at one of the long tables. \nMAX That's the real crime, Henry. Not committing to your dream. They begin to eat. \nMAX (CONT'D) So what's yours? \nHENRY My what? \nMAX Your dream. \nHENRY Not sure I ever had one. \nMAX Never had a dream? What kind of a life is that? \nHENRY I don't know. A pretty good one? \nMAX Henry, you're in jail. Henry thinks about that. Puts a piece of potato in his mouth. \nEXT. YARD - DAY \nMax and Henry walk through the crowded prison yard. \nMAX But here's the good news. We got all this time to do. And time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it. \n(MORE) \nMAX (CONT'D) Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And in your case, you can figure out what your dream is. Max takes his arm : \nMAX (CONT'D) Your dream is your truth is your destiny. Henry looks at him. \nHENRY I told you. I'm here by mistake. Max shoots a look back at him. \nMAX There are no mistakes. Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder. \nHENRY What? Several convicts are making their way towards them... He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense : \nMAX But you're going to have to fight for that dream, Henry. \nHENRY I am. \nMAX You're at a crossroads now. There are going to be tests! \nHENRY What tests? \nCRAACK! Henry's punched in the side of the head. The inmates grab him, throw him to the ground next to Max. \nMAX This is your moment. Whatever you do now defines you. Go get em! Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging, taking several down. He gives it everything he's got. They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps fighting...but it's hopeless. GUARDS rush in. Max watches. \nINT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - NIGHT \nHenry lies on his bunk, his face battered and bruised. \nMAX You did good, Henry. \nHENRY I don't feel good. \nMAX You're doing better than you feel. Henry touches his swollen eye. It stings. \nMAX (CONT'D) Go to sleep, Henry. \n(BEAT) Sleep is for the blessed. \n", "test1_id": 2490, "test2_input": "JULIE You know Chekhov? \nMAX Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my favorite Russian. She laughs. Max approaches her. \nMAX (CONT'D) Would you mind if we took a look around? It's been over thirty years since I've been inside. She considers the request. \nJULIE Sure. She gestures them inside. \nJULIE (CONT'D) Sure. Yeah. Come on in. \nMAX Thank you. As Henry passes : \nHENRY How you doing? \nJULIE Great. I'm in hell. \nINT. THEATRE - SAME TIME \nMax walks to centre stage front like he's been there before. He looks out at the auditorium, a little emotional all of a sudden. \nMAX Home again. \nJULIE So what productions were you in? \nMAX Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the greats. \n(A SMILE) And the not-so-greats! Simon arrives. \nSIMON \n(TO JULIE) Mary wants to fit your wig at four. Darek says to stay hungry. \nJULIE Fuck him. \nSIMON Got it. Max and Henry exchange a glance. \nMAX Would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old time's sake? \nJULIE He used to perform here. \nSIMON I don't see why not. We're on a break. \nMAX That okay, Henry? \nHENRY Sure. Go ahead. Julie and Henry watch them go. \nJULIE Is that your dad? \nHENRY No. He's a friend. \nJULIE He seems like your dad. Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing, getting the feel of it. \nHENRY It's peaceful out here. Beat. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Is it fun? \nJULIE What? \nHENRY Pretending to be other people. She thinks. \nJULIE It's not really like that. I don't pretend to be someone else. I find some part of me, and reveal it in a new way...just inside of a character. \nHENRY So, in a way, you're still playing `you'. \nJULIE Yes. Exactly. In a way. \nHENRY So what part of `you' are you playing now? \nJULIE That's the question you always have to ask yourself. \nINT. THEATRE BACKSTAGE, DOWNSTAIRS - SAME TIME \nMax follows Simon through a tight hallway of DRESSING \nROOMS. They pass ACTORS eating lunch or playing cards. Nothing very glamorous. \nMAX Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before the magic! I remember it like it was yesterday. They enter the Green Room where ARNOLD is holding court. \nINT. GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nARNOLD People often make the mistake in Chekhov of going down...but you must always always go up... Other ACTORS look at him with blank faces. Max gestures Simon closer. With a conspiratorial whisper - \nMAX Simon, did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days? \nSIMON Yes. And they hid the booze in the bank! \nMAX I know. \n", "test2_true": "MAX I know! \n(THEN) I forget. Where was it? \nINT. THEATRE - SAME TIME \nHenry examines the fake bookshelves on the drawing room set. Julie sits in an armchair eating the sandwich she's pulled out of her bag. She watches him a moment. \nJULIE So what's your story, Henry? \nHENRY My story? \nJULIE I mean, like...what do you do? Henry crosses the stage, goes to sit in the chair opposite her. \nHENRY I'm figuring that out. \nJULIE Does that mean you don't have a job? A beat. \nHENRY I just got out of jail. ON JULIE. She wasn't expecting that. \nJULIE Jail! \nHENRY Sounds worse than it is. \nJULIE Really? Jail sounds bad. \n(THEN) Why were you in there? She takes a big bite of her sandwich. \nJULIE (CONT'D) Are you a murderer or something? \nHENRY No. Do I look like one? She studies him. \nJULIE No. \nHENRY What do I look like? She studies him some more. \nJULIE I don't know. A criminal. He laughs. \nHENRY I do? She laughs. Then stops. Dead serious : \nJULIE Yeah. \nEXT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME \nA taped paper sign on the door reads `LOPHAKIN please knock'. Simon opens it for Max, shows him inside. \nSIMON We got to be quick. Arnold doesn't like people in his dressing room. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA costume on hangers. A wig and beard in front of the mirror. Simon walks into the room. Places his hand on the far wall. \nSIMON \n(ENTHUSIASTICALLY) It was right here. Max comes up. Feels it now too. \nMAX Booze, broads and lucre. The good old days. I like it. \nSIMON They filled it in, in 1931 when they built the theatre. Max pads the wall like it's a good old friend, testing it...searching... \nSIMON (CONT'D) Times have changed. \nMAX All good things must come to... (he hits a hollow spot) ...an end. Max stops. Turns to Simon, and with a broad smile : \nMAX (CONT'D) Do you need volunteers? \nINT. STAGE - SAME TIME \nHenry picks up a marked-up text of the Cherry Orchard that's on one of the chairs. \nHENRY The Cherry Orchard. (leafing through it) So what happens? What's it about? Is it funny? Julie gets up out of her chair. \nJULIE A woman returns to her family estate in the Russian countryside and realizes she has no choice but to sell her beloved Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her youth, the only place she ever felt safe. \nHENRY I guess it's not funny. She looks at him. \nJULIE It's about being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive. Max's voice booms : \nMAX (O.S.) That was great! This place is full of treasures. Max comes right up to them. \nMAX (CONT'D) Thank you, Julie. And thank you, Simon. I'll see you tomorrow. \nJULIE Tomorrow? \nSIMON Max has very kindly offered to volunteer at the theatre! \n", "test2_id": 2491, "test3_input": "JULIE What'd they send you to jail for Henry? \nHENRY For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank. \nJULIE What! \nHENRY I thought I was on my way to a softball game. It was a mistake. Pause. \nJULIE Sounds like it. He looks at her. Decides : \nHENRY But now I'm going to rob it for real. \nJULIE You're going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing? \nHENRY Yeah. \nJULIE Ha! \nHENRY There's a tunnel. \nJULIE What tunnel? \nHENRY Runs from the bank to the theatre. \nJULIE My theatre? \nHENRY Yeah. \nJULIE Ha! She looks out the falls. \nJULIE (CONT'D) You're fucking hilarious, Henry. \nHENRY \n(SERIOUSLY) Thank you. A beat. We can't tell what she's thinking... \nJULIE You know what? \nHENRY What? \nJULIE I'm hungry. \nHENRY What for? \nJULIE (as the thought occurs) Ice cream. \nINT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHenry leans against the sink watching Julie at the table eating Ice Cream. There's music on in the b.g. They watch one another for a moment. She takes a big spoonful. \nJULIE I can't believe I'm sitting here. \nHENRY Neither can I. She gets up. \nJULIE I want to dance and clap my hands. She moves through into the lounge. Henry follows. \nJULIE (CONT'D) I think I must be dreaming! She starts moving around the room, dancing to the music. \nJULIE (CONT'D) God knows I love my country. I love it deeply. She sits down. \nJULIE (CONT'D) I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. Henry's not sure what she's talking about. She gestures to her copy of `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' on the coffee table. \nJULIE (CONT'D) Page twenty one. Henry opens it. \nJULIE (CONT'D) I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. But I must drink my coffee. \n(THEN) Read Lophakin. She points to the right place. Henry, awkwardly : \nHENRY `I have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you. \n(TO HER) You're as wonderful as ever....' He stops, looks at her : \nJULIE Read the next line! \nHENRY `Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.' \nJULIE Say it like you feel it. Like it's real. Say it to me. Henry takes a beat. This time he makes it his. \n`HENRY Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.' She laughs like a little girl. \nJULIE You're good. Keep reading! And get up. Walk around! \nHENRY `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money-grubber.' \nJULIE Yes, you are. You're a bank robber, Henry! He laughs. \nHENRY (the text again) `I don't care a bit. I just want you to believe in me like the old days!' \n", "test3_true": "HENRY `I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.' \nJULIE Again! Henry's getting into it. \nHENRY `I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.' She laughs some more. Comes closer. \nJULIE I'm glad I ran you over. Henry puts the book down. \nHENRY Me too. They kiss... \nINT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING \nHenry and Julie asleep in the bed. She opens her eyes. Realizes he's there with her...as if sensing her, he opens his eyes too. They look at one another. \nJULIE \n(SOFTLY) Good morning. \nHENRY Good morning. She climbs on top of him. Henry smiles. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Good morning. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nSun streams in through the window. Tchaikovsky plays on a tiny transistor radio. Max humming to the music, reading `Future Shock' on the toilet. The sound of the front door of the apartment opening -- \nMAX Henry! \nHENRY (O.S.) Max. \nMAX (pulling up his boxers) I figured it out! Once we're in that dressing room the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof! \nHENRY \nMAX -- \nMAX (rushing out into the front \nROOM) That bank doesn't stand a chance. HENRY is standing right there, holding a bag of groceries, JULIE is right next to him. Max goes white. He's in his underwear. \nMAX (CONT'D) Ah. Company. \nJULIE Good morning, Max. \nMax is frozen. \nHENRY It's alright. She knows. \nMAX She does? \nJULIE I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof. She laughs a little. Max looks at Henry like `what the fuck?' \nHENRY We brought breakfast. How do you like your eggs? Henry enters the kitchen...leaving Max and Julie there. \nJULIE It's okay. I'm not going to tell anyone. \nMAX Hold on. Max follows Henry into the kitchen. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nHenry unpacks the groceries. \nMAX You told her? \n(A WHISPER) About what we're doing? \nHENRY Yeah. I did. \nMAX It's a crime. You're supposed to keep crimes a secret. \nHENRY It's okay, Max. \nMAX No. It's not kosher. Pause. \nHENRY How do you like your bacon? \nMAX \n(PISSED) Crispy. Max leaves the kitchen for the front room where Julie's waiting, amused by the whole thing. Max just stands there in his underwear a moment, sizing her up. \nMAX (CONT'D) Okay. I'll get dressed. \nINT. APARTMENT - LATER \nThey eat. \n", "test3_id": 2492}

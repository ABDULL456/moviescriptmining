{"train": "HENRY'S CRIME \nWritten by \nSacha Gervasi \nINT. TOLL BOOTH - DAWN \nA LONE TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT sits inside his glass box on an empty stretch of interstate. This is HENRY. He looks out at the horizon. It's starting to get light out. There's snow on the ground. He's neither asleep nor awake. \nINT. TOLL BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER \nHENRY'S PLASTIC GLOVES unscrew a THERMOS, pour coffee into a Styrofoam cup. There are only a few drops left. \nA CAR Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window. But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE... Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the horizon again. It's cloudy out there. \nA CLOCK flips to 6:00. \nINT. TOLL BOOTH - LATER \nHenry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps out into the icy morning. He walks toward his truck. The traffic is beginning to build. \nEXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING \nHenry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous, abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL. \nEXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING \nThe pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest salt-box houses. \nEXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MORNING \nHenry's truck rolls into his driveway. \nINT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nHenry enters. Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks. It's clean and ordinary in here. His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a little surprised. Debbie appears. Lays down the toast. \nHENRY Smells good. \nDEBBIE Sit down. He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast. \nHENRY Wow. Thanks. He digs in. \nDEBBIE How was your night? \nHENRY Good. How was yours? She's still buttering the toast. Carefully. \nDEBBIE Good. She sets it down. \nHENRY This is great. She sits down next to him. Watches him eat. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Your shift's at eight thirty? She nods. \nHENRY (CONT'D) You not eating? \nDEBBIE I already did. He takes another bite. \nHENRY You okay? \nPause. \nDEBBIE Are you coming with me to Cindy and Bill's on Saturday? \nHENRY Sure. What time? Pause. \nDEBBIE For the baby shower. \nHENRY Right. She just stares at him... \nDEBBIE Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and Bill's. \nHENRY What? \nDEBBIE I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come here. \nHENRY Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime. Pause. \nDEBBIE Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us? Henry stops eating. \nHENRY You're talking about kids. \nDEBBIE Of course I am. \nHENRY Okay. \nDEBBIE 'Okay' you want kids? Pause. \nAfter a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs his sleeve. \nBEHIND HIM In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two guys slipping on SKI MASKS... \nHENRY'S POV A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his store and enters. He says good morning to all the animals. It's a strange one man show. \nLOUD ALARMS BLARE -- Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming \nFROM : \nTHREE GUYS IN SKI MASKS Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK GUARD chases them. ON HENRY, confused. A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun : \nFRANK (O.S.) You! Henry turns forward again. \nA GUN Is pointing at him through the windshield. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Freeze! Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel. Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder. Holding on Henry's stunned expression... \nINT. POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nHenry sits at a small table as a DETECTIVE, whose face we never see, paces back and forth. \nDETECTIVE Henry, we know this wasn't your deal. \nHenry just listens. \nDETECTIVE (CONT'D) All you have to do is give me those names. And you can go home. It's that simple. Henry's still silent. \nDETECTIVE (CONT'D) Come on. Why are you sticking up for these people? They're not your friends. You've got a wife. You've got a job... don't you care? \n(THEN) All you have to do is say something. Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first time. \nJUDGE (V.O.) ...in light of the fact that this is a first offence... \nINT. BUFFALO COURTROOM - DAY \nHenry stands in a suit, flanked by his state-appointed ATTORNEY. Debbie sits in the gallery. A JUDGE stares at Henry. \nJUDGE ...the court sentences Henry Torne to four years in prison for the crime of Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery. \nWHACK! The gavel goes down. Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with the sentence. He pats Henry, well done. Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him... \nCLANK! A CELL DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT... \nINT. PRISON CELL - DAY \nHenry, wearing a prison jumpsuit, watches as the guard locks the door in front of him. \nMAX (O.S.) So. What're you in for? \nHenry turns. \nHENRY Huh. \nMAX I said what are you in for? A beat. \nHENRY Bank robbery. MAX (60s) pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET. \nMAX Good. Clean. Simple. I like it. Henry just watches. \nHENRY But I didn't do it. Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands. \nMAX Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial favorite. Identities are just constructs, anyway. They're mistaken all the time. He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry. \nMAX (CONT'D) I'm Max. \nHENRY Henry. \nMAX Go on. Make yourself at home. Henry sits down on his bed. \nHENRY So...what are you in for? \nMAX Life. A beat. It's starting to hit Henry... \nMAX (CONT'D) Don't worry, you'll get used to it. \nINT. PRISON CELL - MORNING \nAll the cell doors SLAM open. Henry startles awake. Max is already dressed. \nMAX Hurry up. We gotta go. Henry's disoriented. \nMAX (CONT'D) Breakfast. A GUARD, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton against the bars of the cell. \nINT. DINING ROOM - DAY \nMax and Henry move along a line of convicts waiting for their food. \nINT. PRISON TIER - NIGHT \nOne by one we see lights blinking off across the vast string of cells. \nFADE OUT : \nINT. VISITING AREA - DAY \nHenry's wife Debbie sits at one of the metal visiting tables. She's dressed up. She's really made an effort. A door opens, Henry appears. He looks different. Some time has passed. He smiles, walks over. Then sits. \nDEBBIE Hi. \nHENRY Hi. You look beautiful. \nDEBBIE Thank you. How are you doing? \nHENRY I'm okay. How about you? \nDEBBIE I'm good. A beat. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Listen, Henry. I have something I need to talk to you about. \nHENRY Okay. \nDEBBIE I fell in love. Henry takes that in. \nHENRY Oh. Pause. \nDEBBIE I just...I mean it just happened. Pause. \nHENRY Okay. Wow... \nDEBBIE I'm sorry, Henry. \nHENRY It's alright. \nDEBBIE You're not mad? He thinks. \nHENRY No. He looks at her. \nHENRY (CONT'D) I want you to be happy. \nDEBBIE You too, Henry. No one moves. \nEXT. PRISON YARD - LATER THAT DAY \nHenry sits on a bench alone, processing what just happened. He looks up at the sky. Gray and empty. Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a hand around his shoulder. \nMAX I ever tell you I was married? Henry turns to him. \nMAX (CONT'D) I mean nearly. I had a lovely correspondence going with Jocelyn Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she finally came on visitor's day she said I was too short. Henry thinks. \nHENRY Books and covers. \nMAX Right. Books and covers. \nCUT TO: \nTWO YEARS LATER \nINT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - DAY \nThere's music on a radio. Pull back to reveal Henry sitting on his bunk. He's grown a beard. Their cell has temporarily been converted into a makeshift BARBERSHOP. CONVICTS of various races wait to get their hair cut by Max the Barber. Max holds up a mirror to his customer, FINK. \nMAX Clean as a whistle. \nFINK (checking himself out) Max, I think you missed your calling. \nMAX Thank you. \n(THEN) Who do we got next, Henry? Henry checks the schedule by his side, calls out a name. \nHENRY Hector. You're up. Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift barbershop carefully. Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck. \nHECTOR Hey, Max. When are you up for parole? \nMAX October. \nHECTOR Show us what you did for the board last time. \nMAX I'm working. The other INMATES egg him on. \nOTHER INMATES Show us! \nMAX Leave me alone. \nINMATES Come on! Show us. Max finally puts his clippers down. \nMAX Get out of here, Henry. \nEXT. PRISON - DAY \nIt's cloudy. Henry walks through the front GATE of the prison. He takes a long deep breath of free air. It's cold. We see his exhale. He starts to walk. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY \nHenry sits in the back of the bus, the New York countryside streaking past him in a blur... \nEXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY \nHenry turns onto his old street. \nEXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - DAY \nHenry walks up to his doorway. He hesitates before ringing the bell. A beat. The door opens. It's -- \nJOE The guy who got sick several years before. He's wearing a suit and tie now. \nJOE Henry. How you doing? \nHENRY Hey. \nJOE \n(CALLING OUT) Debbie! Henry's here. \n(TO HENRY) Come on in. Make yourself at home. \nHENRY Thanks. \nINT. HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nHenry enters. His old house looks more or less the same. Joe heads over to small display of KITCHENWARE SAMPLES in the living room. \nJOE Don't mind me. I'm just getting set up for my meeting. You want a beer? \nHENRY Sure. \nJOE \n(CALLING OUT) Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer? \nAs Joe clips several FLOW CHARTS onto an easel -- they look like they were done by a kid -- Debbie appears with a Bud Lite. She hands it to Henry. She smiles. \nDEBBIE Hi. \nHENRY Hi. It's not so awkward. \nINT. GARAGE - MINUTES LATER \nDebbie leads Henry to a NAVY BAG and a BOX with Henry's name on it. \nDEBBIE I think that's everything you wanted. \nHENRY Thanks. A beat. They just stand there for a moment. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Are you happy? \nDEBBIE I am, Henry. \nHENRY I'm glad. He means it. Henry picks up the box, shoulders the bag. \nDEBBIE So what are you going to do now? \nHENRY I don't know yet. Joe enters. \nJOE Honey, they're starting to arrive. Joe grabs a DISPLAY STAND featuring kitchen products. \nDEBBIE \n(TO HENRY) We're having a meeting. It's his new business. \nJOE Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry. You could become a distributor for Jin Chi. They all head out of the garage. \nJOE (CONT'D) It's Korean kitchenware. The future of food storage. Plus, if you recruit distributors, you get paid even more. Passing through the living room arriving GUESTS notice Henry walking out carrying his box. \nHENRY You mean like a pyramid scheme? \nJOE No! God, no. It's a multi-layered marketing paradigm. \n(HENRY'S LOOK) Anyway, why don't you give it some thought? Henry nods, starts to head out. \nJOE (CONT'D) Henry. \nHENRY Yeah? \nHENRY It does? \nFEMALE PAROLE OFFICER Henry, You've done your time. You are now a free free man. \n(THEN) How does it feel? Henry takes a breath. \nHENRY Good. \nShe signs a document and hands it to him. \nFEMALE PAROLE OFFICER So, What's next? Henry doesn't answer. The SOUND of boots, move in on HENRY'S EXPRESSION, staring, as we \nCUT TO : \nHENRY'S DIRTY BOOTS march along the street with purpose... We follow them. After a while, the boots stop. \nEXT. MAIN ST. BUFFALO - DAY \nHENRY looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees : \nTHE FIRST BUFFALO BANK Directly across the street. Holding on Henry as he contemplates the place... Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in. There's something happening, he's not sure what it is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each passing moment becomes more like a knowing.... A moment of revelation. He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now, heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile -- \nSCREEEECH! A car HITS Henry in the side. He's knocked down. A GIRL (30s) Rushes out of the car. \nJULIE What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Are you okay? (into cell phone) Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran someone over. No, he looks okay. \nShe hangs up. \nJULIE (CONT'D) You idiot, you weren't even looking where you were going! Are you okay? Henry's a little delirious. \nHENRY I think I'm okay. He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up. \nJULIE No. Stay on the ground. The bank Guard FRANK rushes over. \nFRANK Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an ambulance. \nHENRY No, don't. (Starts to stand) I think I'm okay. \nFRANK \n(RECOGNIZING HIM) You! \nHENRY \n(RECOGNIZING HIM) Yeah. Me. \nJULIE (to Frank, confused) Is he alright? \nFRANK Are you alright? \nHENRY Yeah. Fine. \nJULIE He just walked right out into the street. He came out of nowhere. \nFRANK I saw the whole thing. You were on the phone. You weren't even paying attention. \nJULIE Yes. I was. I know how to drive. Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the sidewalk. \nJULIE (CONT'D) What are you doing? Get back on the ground! \nFRANK Park your car. I'm going to take him into that cafe. She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side. Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm. \nFRANK (CONT'D) They let you out, huh. \nHENRY Yeah. \nFRANK Let's get you a seat in here. \nINT. ORPHEUM CAFE - CONTINUOUS \nFrank sets Henry down in a chair at one of the tables by the door. \nFRANK Pierre! Une Verre d'eau. \nHENRY Thanks. Julie comes in. \nJULIE Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an ambulance. \nHENRY It's okay. I really am fine. \nFRANK Yeah. He's alright for a guy who just got run over. (sucks his teeth) Lucky I guess. Frank leaves. \nJULIE I think we should call a doctor. Henry just stares at her. For a long moment. \nJULIE (CONT'D) What? Are you okay? He keeps staring... \nJULIE (CONT'D) Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a doctor? A beat. \nMAX What? \nHENRY My destiny. \nMAX Good. What is it? A beat. Henry leans in. \nHENRY The bank. \nMAX The bank is your destiny? \nHENRY Yeah. \nMAX What bank? \nHENRY The one I didn't rob. Pause. \nMAX But you went to jail for it. \nHENRY Exactly. \nMAX What are you talking about Henry? Henry looks around. Closer -- \nHENRY I did the time, I may as well have done the crime. \nMAX Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right. \n(THEN) I still don't get it. Pause. \nHENRY I need your help. \nMAX What for? \nHENRY \n(A WHISPER) To rob the bank. Pause. \nHENRY (CONT'D) So what do you say? \nMAX I'm in Jail. That's what I say. \nHENRY You've got your review coming up -- \nMAX -- So? \nHENRY So you can get of here. If you want to. \nMAX No. It's not as simple as that. \nHENRY Yes, it is. \nMAX No, it's not. \nHENRY Yes. It is. \nMAX No, it's not. \nHENRY \nMAX -- \nMAX I'm happy here. This is my home. \nHENRY This is not a home. This is a prison. \nMAX Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy here. A beat. Henry looks at Max now. He looks frail. \nHENRY Max. You can't die in this place. \nMAX I can die wherever I want. \nHENRY You really want to die here? \nMAX What do you want, Henry? \nHENRY I'm asking for your help. \nMAX To rob that bank?! \nHENRY I've thought about it. It's the right thing. \n(THEN) For both of us. A long beat. Max gets up : \nMAX Henry. I got cards. \nHENRY \nMAX -- \nMAX (nearly on his knees) I'm going to die right here. I told you! \nHENRY Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus. Henry helps Max back up again. \nEXT. BUS - DAY \nA GREYHOUND BUS rumbles through the countryside. \nINT. BUS - DAY \nHenry and Max sit up front right next to the driver. Max has his eyes closed. He still looks woozy. \nHENRY You hungry? He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich. Offers it to him. Max doesn't say anything. \nHENRY (CONT'D) It's pastrami. On rye. A beat. Max opens one eye... \nA KEY GOING INTO A LOCK... \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nHenry opens the door for Max. They enter. \nHENRY Here we are. Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living room. There are some second hand books on the bedside table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and Dostoyevsky. \nHENRY (CONT'D) That one's yours. \nMax goes over, looks at the books. Sits down on the bed. \nMAX Thanks. \nHENRY Anything else you need? A beat. \nMAX Yeah. \nINT. HENRY'S BATHROOM - LATER \nMax reclines in the steaming TUB, luxuriating in the warm water. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and relaxes. After a moment he notices a fancy-looking bottle on the side. \nMAX (reads the label) Ah. The land of milk and honey. Pours it into his bath. \nEXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY \nAs they cross a street, Max notices a coffee shop on the other side. \nMAX What is this obsession with coffee, Henry? When did that happen? \nHENRY I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give people a lot of purpose. They walk into the Cafe Orpheum. \nINT. CAFE ORPHEUM, BATHROOM -- DAY \nTHE PROHIBITION-ERA PHOTO Henry looked at earlier when he was pissing. Max is staring at the thing now too... \nMAX Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my God. That tunnel's probably not even there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry? \nHENRY It's a start. \nMAX A start? This was your plan? An old cartoon in a pissoir? \nHENRY It's an article. \nMAX Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in with guns and do it the old-fashioned way? \nHENRY No. No guns. \nMAX What? \nHENRY Someone could get hurt. Pause. \nMAX That's sweet, kid. \nHENRY (the tunnel photo) Maybe it's still there, Max. A beat. \nMAX \n(SURE) Uh-huh. \nHENRY Maybe it is. Max looks at him. \nMAX Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why don't we go take a look at this bank of yours? \n(THEN) At least we know that's still there. Henry looks at him. \nINT. FIRST BUFFALO BANK - DAY \nMax and Henry walk in to the grand banking hall. \nMAX Money is a mistress with a hard heart. \nJULIE You know Chekhov? \nMAX Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my favorite Russian. She laughs. Max approaches her. \nMAX (CONT'D) Would you mind if we took a look around? It's been over thirty years since I've been inside. She considers the request. \nJULIE Sure. She gestures them inside. \nJULIE (CONT'D) Sure. Yeah. Come on in. \nMAX Thank you. As Henry passes : \nHENRY How you doing? \nJULIE Great. I'm in hell. \nINT. THEATRE - SAME TIME \nMax walks to centre stage front like he's been there before. He looks out at the auditorium, a little emotional all of a sudden. \nMAX Home again. \nJULIE So what productions were you in? \nMAX Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the greats. \n(A SMILE) And the not-so-greats! Simon arrives. \nSIMON \n(TO JULIE) Mary wants to fit your wig at four. Darek says to stay hungry. \nJULIE Fuck him. \nSIMON Got it. Max and Henry exchange a glance. \nMAX Would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old time's sake? \nJULIE He used to perform here. \nSIMON I don't see why not. We're on a break. \nMAX That okay, Henry? \nHENRY Sure. Go ahead. Julie and Henry watch them go. \nJULIE Is that your dad? \nHENRY No. He's a friend. \nJULIE He seems like your dad. Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing, getting the feel of it. \nHENRY It's peaceful out here. Beat. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Is it fun? \nJULIE What? \nHENRY Pretending to be other people. She thinks. \nJULIE It's not really like that. I don't pretend to be someone else. I find some part of me, and reveal it in a new way...just inside of a character. \nHENRY So, in a way, you're still playing `you'. \nJULIE Yes. Exactly. In a way. \nHENRY So what part of `you' are you playing now? \nJULIE That's the question you always have to ask yourself. \nINT. THEATRE BACKSTAGE, DOWNSTAIRS - SAME TIME \nMax follows Simon through a tight hallway of DRESSING \nROOMS. They pass ACTORS eating lunch or playing cards. Nothing very glamorous. \nMAX Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before the magic! I remember it like it was yesterday. They enter the Green Room where ARNOLD is holding court. \nINT. GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nARNOLD People often make the mistake in Chekhov of going down...but you must always always go up... Other ACTORS look at him with blank faces. Max gestures Simon closer. With a conspiratorial whisper - \nMAX Simon, did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days? \nSIMON Yes. And they hid the booze in the bank! \nMAX I know. \nJULIE What'd they send you to jail for Henry? \nHENRY For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank. \nJULIE What! \nHENRY I thought I was on my way to a softball game. It was a mistake. Pause. \nJULIE Sounds like it. He looks at her. Decides : \nHENRY But now I'm going to rob it for real. \nJULIE You're going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing? \nHENRY Yeah. \nJULIE Ha! \nHENRY There's a tunnel. \nJULIE What tunnel? \nHENRY Runs from the bank to the theatre. \nJULIE My theatre? \nHENRY Yeah. \nJULIE Ha! She looks out the falls. \nJULIE (CONT'D) You're fucking hilarious, Henry. \nHENRY \n(SERIOUSLY) Thank you. A beat. We can't tell what she's thinking... \nJULIE You know what? \nHENRY What? \nJULIE I'm hungry. \nHENRY What for? \nJULIE (as the thought occurs) Ice cream. \nINT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHenry leans against the sink watching Julie at the table eating Ice Cream. There's music on in the b.g. They watch one another for a moment. She takes a big spoonful. \nJULIE I can't believe I'm sitting here. \nHENRY Neither can I. She gets up. \nJULIE I want to dance and clap my hands. She moves through into the lounge. Henry follows. \nJULIE (CONT'D) I think I must be dreaming! She starts moving around the room, dancing to the music. \nJULIE (CONT'D) God knows I love my country. I love it deeply. She sits down. \nJULIE (CONT'D) I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. Henry's not sure what she's talking about. She gestures to her copy of `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' on the coffee table. \nJULIE (CONT'D) Page twenty one. Henry opens it. \nJULIE (CONT'D) I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. But I must drink my coffee. \n(THEN) Read Lophakin. She points to the right place. Henry, awkwardly : \nHENRY `I have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you. \n(TO HER) You're as wonderful as ever....' He stops, looks at her : \nJULIE Read the next line! \nHENRY `Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.' \nJULIE Say it like you feel it. Like it's real. Say it to me. Henry takes a beat. This time he makes it his. \n`HENRY Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.' She laughs like a little girl. \nJULIE You're good. Keep reading! And get up. Walk around! \nHENRY `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money-grubber.' \nJULIE Yes, you are. You're a bank robber, Henry! He laughs. \nHENRY (the text again) `I don't care a bit. I just want you to believe in me like the old days!' \nJULIE So what were you in prison for, Max? Max slurps his coffee. \nMAX I'm a confidence man. \nJULIE You mean a `con' man? \nMAX I never liked that word. It's only half of what it is. The word confidence comes from the latin. Fides. With Faith. Belief. \n(THEN) That's what I'm about. She considers this. \nJULIE You mean you make people feel good...and then you rip them off? \nMAX Yes. He glances at Henry. \nMAX (CONT'D) But I was always much better at the feeling good part than the ripping off part. \n(THEN) Hence, the prison. \nJULIE Aren't you guys worried about getting caught? \nMAX Not really. For me it's a win-win situation. \nJULIE How? \nMAX I like jail. Three hots and a cot. Julie looks at Henry now... \nJULIE You too, Henry? You like jail? \nHENRY No. I like it out here. \nJULIE So why would you take the risk? Is it the money? Henry doesn't answer, starts to collect the plates. \nJULIE (CONT'D) It must be the money. Henry smiles. \nJULIE (CONT'D) You are a criminal. A greedy little criminal. \nHENRY (washing the plates) `Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart, a money grubber... \n(THEN) ...but I don't care a bit'. He turns to her. \nHENRY (CONT'D) `I just want you to believe in me like the old days.' \nJULIE You remember! \nMAX What is that? \nJULIE It's Chekhov! \nMAX Chekhov?! \nHENRY We read it last night. \nJULIE \n(TO HENRY) You really are good. \n(TO MAX) He's a natural. \nMAX I thought you were on a date. \nHENRY We were. \nMAX Reading Chekhov's a date? Beat. \nHENRY Yeah. She downs her coffee. Stands. \nJULIE I got to get to the theatre -- \nMAX Can you give me a ride there? \nJULIE Why? \nMAX I'm a volunteer! She regards him a moment. \nJULIE You weren't in any of those plays, were you? \nMAX No. \n(THEN) But can you give me a ride? \nINT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY \nJulie as Madame Ranevsky. Her brother GAYEV and her daughter VARYA are also on stage. \nJULIE All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness; the heavenly angels have never abandoned you... \n(MORE) \nARNOLD You knew this day would come. You deserve this, lubya. He closes his eyes. Bows his head. Starts to weep... \nINT. THEATRE - MORNING \nCLOSE ON DAREK : the veins on the side of his forehead pulsate with rage... \nDAREK Unprofessional shit! \nARNOLD Mr. Millodragovich -- \nDAREK \n(HISSING) Shit! \nINT. THEATRE - MORNING \nJulie stands in the wings. Max joins her. \nMAX What's happening? \nJULIE Arnold's leaving the production. \nMAX Oh. Gosh. \nDAREK AND ARNOLD on the stage. Simon behind them. Darek is right in \nARNOLD'S FACE : \nARNOLD But I have no choice it's Willie Lohman we're talking about! (brandishing the letter) A Ken Waterstone production! \nDAREK OOOH-LA-LA! A Ken Waterstone production. The heaven's have opened. You lucky boy. \n(MORE) \nDAREK (CONT'D) Run, run, to that pandering, populist, piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his spineless productions! You're perfect for it. \nARNOLD Good-bye, Darek. \n(THEN) I'm sorry. Arnold marches off the stage with his case. \nDAREK Simone! I need a new Lopakhin. Now. \n(CALLING OUT) I'm dying, Olga! Cigarettes! Cigarettes NOW! And COFFEE! \nSIMON We'll hold auditions this afternoon, Darek! I'll get the list -- Darek ingests caffeine and nicotine at an alarming rate : \nDAREK I've seen that shit-list! It's a disaster. \nSIMON What do we do? \nDAREK I must think. He moves stage left past Julie... \nDAREK (CONT'D) Djula! Your orchard cannot be felled before she has a chance to grow. And with that he disappears with Olga out the door. \nJULIE Perfect. Beat. \nMAX \n(A SHRUG) It is Ken Waterstone. She shoots him a look, picks up her stuff and goes... \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nJulie, on the phone, searches for her keys in the bag as she approaches her car. \nJULIE Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but that's what's happening... \n(SHE LISTENS) I don't know, he's `thinking'... She gets in the car. Tries to find a roach in the ashtray. A KNOCK at the passenger window. She looks up. It's MAX. \nJULIE (CONT'D) What? He gestures, `Can I come in?'. Max gets in. \nJULIE (CONT'D) Sorry, I can't give you a ride -- \nMAX You said he was a natural. \nJULIE Stan. Let me call you back. (she hangs up, to Max) What? \nMAX Henry. \nJULIE Henry what? \nMAX Henry would be perfect for it. \nJULIE Perfect for what? \nMAX For Lophakin. It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea. \nJULIE You mean Henry should play Lophakin? \nHENRY Good God in Heaven. My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that. But you, you did so much for me in the old days that I've forgotten all that... His yearning is suddenly palpable. Intense. Tender. \nHENRY (CONT'D) I love you...like a sister...more than a sister. Henry drops to his knees, supplicates. \nDAREK You piece of shit! Yes! Henry just breathes. He's unbreakable. A beat. \nDAREK (CONT'D) Good. \nHenry looks up. \nHENRY Good? \nDAREK Yes. Darek considers him. \nDAREK (CONT'D) Tomorrow. Be more good. Henry and Julie share a look. He actually did it. \nINT. JULIE'S CAR -- NIGHT - MOVING \nShe drives. Henry rides shotgun. They both look at the road ahead. In silence. After a while... \nJULIE Does this make me an accessory? \nHENRY I think so. A beat. \nJULIE Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up. \nHENRY You mean since you ran me over... She smiles. \nINT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nThey make love. It's more intense than before. They climax. They lie there, breathless, looking at each other... \nINT. KITCHEN TABLE - LATE AT NIGHT \nShe makes tea. Henry sits at the table watching her. \nJULIE So why are you robbing the bank, Henry? He doesn't answer. \nJULIE (CONT'D) It's not just about the money, is it? \nHENRY No. \nJULIE So why are you doing it? It takes a moment for him to answer. \nHENRY I used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars, going wherever they went. Just joining someone else's life. \nJULIE You were asleep at the wheel. Henry smiles. \nHENRY Yeah, I was. \n(THEN) It was easier for me to go to jail than tell my wife the truth. \nJULIE Which was? \nHENRY That I was going along with everything. I didn't know I could change it. \n(THEN) So now I'm changing it. \nJULIE Robbing the bank is changing it? \nHENRY It already has. She gets the honey out of the cupboard. Pours some in her tea. \nJULIE What was your wife like? \nHENRY Nice. A beat. \nHENRY (CONT'D) Are you sure you're okay with this? I know it's a lot. She turns to him. \nJULIE Not for a girl like me, Henry. \nINT. ORPHEUM THEATRE STAGE - MORNING \nDarek addresses the full cast. Henry by his side. \nDAREK This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be taking over the role of Lophakin. If you please. He leads a light round of applause. Henry acknowledges \nIT: \nHENRY Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward. \nDAREK Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga, cigarettes! Henry walks briskly away. Julie watches him... \nINT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - MORNING \nHenry enters his dressing room, locking the door behind him. Max is already waiting. He turns the music on. They move the GIANT ARMOIRE that's against the wall aside. Max spreads a blanket on the floor to catch the falling rubble and holds another against the wall to muffle the sound. Henry pulls a sledgehammer out of a bag : \nWHACK! He POUNDS the wall AGAIN and AGAIN... \nJOE \n(WIPING OFF) How? \nHENRY We might have a job for you. Max shoots a look at Henry. Joe chugs a glass of water, looking at both of them now. \nJOE No foolin'? \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nHenry, Max and Joe stand hunched over at the end of the tunnel. \nHENRY There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault. \nJOE That's a lot of dirt, Henry. Max studies Joe. \nHENRY So what do you think? \nJOE I think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door! \nHENRY No guns. People could get hurt. \nJOE What about fake ones? \nHENRY They're still guns. \nMAX Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers and tears and chump change. We're doing an old fashioned heist. We're going right into the belly of the beast. \n(THEN) Are you in or are you in? \nON JOE Considering it... He picks up a shovel and CRUNCHES into the wall of dirt. \nJOE I hope we don't get caught. \nINT. JULIE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nHenry and Julie are in bed. He memorizes his lines. The TV's on low. Julie's Buffaloto commercial comes on. Julie snaps it off. \nJULIE I hate that commercial. \nHENRY I like it. She looks at him. \nJULIE So what's your plan? \nHENRY For what? \nJULIE For when it's done. After. (making light of it) Am I going to see your picture in the post office or something? \nHENRY I hope not. \nJULIE But have you thought about what happens after? \nHENRY Not really, no. He thinks carefully before he says it : \nHENRY (CONT'D) I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out west... \nJULIE Out west? \nHENRY Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there. \nJULIE \n(SHE LAUGHS) When did you think of that? \nHENRY Just now. \n(THEN) So what about it? \nJULIE What about what? \nHENRY Meeting me -- \nJULIE -- I'm not going anywhere, Henry -- \nHENRY You're not? \nJULIE No. \nHENRY I thought that was your plan. Do the play \nAND -- \nJULIE Plans change, Henry. Okay? She gets out of bed. Throws on her robe. \nJULIE (CONT'D) I think I ran out of maple syrup. \nINT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nEDDIE Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back. We've known each other since high school, isn't that right? \nHENRY Yeah. I know you. \nEDDIE Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the quality of loyalty. \nHENRY What do you want, Eddie? \nEDDIE Nothing. Just the American dream. \nCUT TO : \nMAX AND HENRY At the window. Looking down as EDDIE gets into his car. He senses them watching him. Turns around. Gives them the thumbs up. \nINT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME \nMax and Henry watch Eddie leave. \nMAX I'm gonna kill him. With a knife. \nHENRY You can't kill him. \nJOE (slurred, on the floor) Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got the vault -- \nMAX Shut up, Joe. \nHe looks over at Joe on the floor. Thinks about how easy it would be to just kick him in the head. \nJOE Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born. Says the kid'll know about it. \nMAX Go home. Please. Before it's too late. \nCUT TO : \nINT. STAGE - DAY \nHenry in period costume. He has a beard. He watches from the stalls as they run a dress rehearsal. \nTROFIMOV I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's sake, the man has robbed you. \nMADAME RANEVSKY (stopping her ears) No! No! No! Don't say that! \nTROFIMOV He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user... ON HENRY, feeling like the accused. From the stage Julie sees him. \nMADAME RANEVSKY You are twenty six or twenty seven, and you're still in the lower grades! \nTROFIMOV Who cares? She locks eyes with Henry now : \nMADAME RANEVSKY You ought to be grown up by now. At your age, you ought to understand about love -- \nDAREK Where are you, Djula? Where?! \nMADAME RANEVSKY (with double the fire) You ought to love someone yourself! You ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes! \nDAREK Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene. \n(THEN) Carlotta and the girls. \n(MORE) \nDAREK (CONT'D) \n(A CLAP) Let's run the magic scene! Julie walks off the stage. She knows Henry is waiting for her. \nHENRY What happened last night? \nJULIE I came to my senses. \n(THEN) And you should too. She walks on. He follows... \nHENRY We should talk about it. She turns. \nJULIE I don't want to, Henry. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER \nHenry arrives to find Max attaching one of the bags of dirt to a pulley. Above them, Joe begins to hoist it up through the open skylight. Henry looks up. \nMAX (tugging the pulley) Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it. Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel is deeper now and all lit up... \nEXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND THE THEATRE - LATER \nHenry, Max and Joe make their way toward Joe's car. \nJOE What do you think guys? If it's a boy do I cut him or not? \nMAX Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness. \nCUT TO : \nEXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nAN AMBULANCE Peels into the drive. A PATIENT is wheeled inside. \nINT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT \nREVEAL HENRY Walking down a corridor toward a NURSE'S STATION at the far end. The doors open for him...he hesitates \nHENRY'S POV DEBBIE in profile, smiling and talking to a seated receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly. Henry takes a step back, the doors close. He watches through the glass a moment... Debbie looks radiant. Peaceful. Happy. \nHENRY Walks back outside again. It's as if he got all the answers he needed... \nINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT \nMax and Joe are digging. Looks like they've been at it for hours - covered in dirt and sweat. Henry enters the tunnel. \nMAX There he is! \nHenry picks up his shovel. Starts to dig. He goes at it hard. Max catches his mood. \nMAX (CONT'D) You okay, Henry? \nHENRY No. He turns to Max. \nHENRY (CONT'D) I'm not leaving her. \nJOE Who? \nMAX The girl -- He throws down his shovel. \nMAX (CONT'D) Now listen, Henry. You're digging this tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank. You're gonna take the money and you're gonna put it in the car and we're gonna drive away. \n(THEN) This is one thing. Julie is another thing. This is not that. That is not this. Understand? \nON HENRY \nJOE Hey! I think I got something... Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free burying Joe who struggles to get out. Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault. \nMAX We have arrived! Look at that. Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nHenry and Max are finished packing up the apartment. Henry looks out the window. A beautiful clear blue sky. \nHENRY Not a cloud in the sky. \nMAX So clear you can see tomorrow. \n(THEN) You're a good man, Henry. Thank you. \nHENRY You too, Max. Let's go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - NIGHT \nA line at the box office. THEATERGOERS mill around, waiting for friends or chatting, everyone anticipating a great evening of theatre. \nINT. ORPHEUM THEATRE, GREEN ROOM - SAME TIME \nThe cast, dressed for stage, is gathered in the green room, chatting nervously to one another. \nHENRY AND JULIE Standing on opposite sides of the room. Hush descends as DAREK walks in. \nDAREK In this `American dream' of ours, everyone is happy and smiling, they have achieved their objectives...and yet in life there is only change, upheaval, the birth of the new...and that birth is painful. \nON JULIE avoiding Henry's gaze. \nDAREK (CONT'D) Our play is about misery, disconnection, a future that we don't see hitting us like a train...but tonight, my players, we show them...that this not a future to fear! He leaves. The players applaud -- \nGAYEV \n(THRILLED) Off the cushion in the corner ; double into the centre pocket! Everyone laughs. \nSIMON Ten minutes people! \nINT. JULIE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nJulie sits by her vanity finishing her make-up. A knock on the door. \nJULIE Come in. Henry appears. She's surprised. \nHENRY I want you to meet me in California. \nJULIE Henry, we've been over this -- \nMax struggles to the top of a telephone pole by an open electrical box. His cell phone vibrates. He pulls it out, reads it. \n\"YOU\" He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a WIRE CUTTER, but his hands are trembling and he drops it... Thirty feet to the ground. \nCRACK! \nMAX Shit. \nINT. STAGE - SAME TIME \nStanding next to Simon, Henry watches Julie perform from the side of the stage. \nMADAME RANEVSKY Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood! I used to sleep in this nursery. \n(MORE) \nMADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D) I looked out from here into the garden. I woke up happy every morning. \nHENRY Isn't she beautiful? \nSIMON Yes. She looks out toward the window through which there is now a projection of the ORCHARD, this time in autumnal decay... \nMADAME RANEVSKY Oh, my cherry orchard... \nINT. BANK - SAME TIME \nON FRANK Waiting...as he and Bernie watch Stan load the money into the vault. \nBERNIE You ever think what you could do with all that money, Frank? \nSTAN I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and put them in first place. \nBERNIE You'd need a lot more money than that. But I guarantee you I'd have them back in the Super Bowl within two seasons. \nSTAN Perfect. Another chance to lose. Frank laughs nervously. \nEXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME \nMax picks up the wire cutters off the ground, checks his watch. His heart jumps. He starts up the pole again. Finally reaches the top. Struggles to find the right wire. \nMAX Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little pischer? He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT : \nINT. BANK - SAME TIME \nBernie and Stan place the last of the money in the vault. \nBERNIE We're good. Bernie closes the vault. \nINT. BANK - SAME TIME \nStan returns to the keypad.

BANK - SAME TIME \nStan hits `enter' -- the vault CLANKS again. Locked. A RED LIGHT indicates the alarm is on. \nEXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME \nMax looks at the screen. ALL THE NUMBERS MATCH. The red light turns GREEN. He sighs, relieved. \nLOPHAKIN (O.S.) I saw this excellent piece of theatre yesterday. Really very funny. \nINT. STAGE - NIGHT -- SAME TIME \nMADAME RANEVSKY I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I believe people like you should examine their own lives instead of going to the theatre to observe other peoples! \nLOPHAKIN True enough. To be honest. We live a stupid life. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BANK - SAME TIME \nFrank, Stan and Bernie are by the truck. \nSTAN Well this is it, Frank. \nBERNIE We got you something. \nWHITE HEAT AND SPARKS EDDIE's manic face behind the mask, a man possessed, screaming, a river of molten steel dripping down right in front of him. KRUUUNK! The bottom of the vault drops onto the ground. \nINT. TUNNEL - A MINUTE LATER \nSmoke clears to reveal EDDIE. He pulls off his hood. \nEDDIE Welcome to my world, bitches. They all look up at THE HOLE. \nJOE Fuck, yeah. \nON HENRY \nINT. VAULT - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nas his head rises into view through the newly cut hole. He climbs in and touches the saran-wrapped STACK OF CASH, subdivided into bricks. He sits on it. Thinking... It's dead quiet in here. Max pops his head up. Stares at the cash : \nMAX \n(SMILING) You're on, Henry! \nMADAME RANEVSKY (O.S.) Is the cherry orchard sold? \nINT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS \nAudience's POV as Madame Ranevsky faces Lophakin on the other side of the stage. It's like a showdown. \nLOPHAKIN Yes. \nMADAME RANEVSKY Who bought it? Pause. \nLOPHAKIN I did. Madame Ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news. Varya takes her keys and throws them on the floor. Exits in a rage. \nLOPHAKIN (CONT'D) I bought it. Wait a minute ; don't rush me. I'm all dizzy. I can't talk... \nINT. VAULT -- SAME TIME \nEDDIE, JOE AND MAX Stuff duffel bags full of cash. \nJOE Deb's gonna freak. \nINT. STAGE - NIGHT \nLophakin swirls on stage... \nLOPHAKIN ...and now the Cherry Orchard is mine. Mine! \n(LAUGHING) God! God in heaven. The Cherry Orchard is mine! Tell me I'm drunk, tell me I'm out of my mind, tell me I'm dreaming! \nINT. TUNNEL ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nEDDIE, JOE AND MAX Finish lining up the duffels of cash by the door. \nMAX That's everything. \nEDDIE Yes, it is. Max freezes, suddenly notices Eddie is standing there with A GUN pointed at him and Joe. \nMAX What's that, Eddie? \nEDDIE It's a gun, Max. Max doesn't seem so surprised. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) (with the gun) Joe! Take the money out back to my car. Joe doesn't move. Eddie waves the gun. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Joe! Max boldly steps right in front of the gun. \nMAX Stay right where you are, Joe. Eddie puts the gun to Max's stomach. \nEDDIE Don't be stupid, Max. \nMAX You're not going to do this, Eddie. Eddie smiles. \nMAX (CONT'D) You can shoot me dead if you want, but you're going to have to shoot me dead. Eddie PUNCHES Max in the gut, then pops him in the head as he throws him back. \nEDDIE I'm not playing with you, old man. \nJOE What are you doing, Eddie? The door swings open -- HENRY -- walks in on the scene... \nEDDIE Welcome to the party, Brando. Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door. Eddie's in the middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow. \nHENRY What are you doing, Eddie? Eddie turns at him. \nEDDIE It's money, Henry. Money. \nMAX This was your chance you idiot. You could've been a better man but you did it again. You messed up. And now you're back with the maggots. Just one big missed opportunity. Eddie kicks him again. \nJOE Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're done. He's right. Come on, man. \nEDDIE Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in the car. Shut up. He turns back to Henry. \n", "test1_input": "Henry catches up. She crosses the street, ignoring the traffic. Henry follows. \nHENRY Is it always like that? \nJULIE What? \nHENRY (gesturing back to the \nTHEATRE) That. \nJULIE You mean rehearsal? \nHENRY Yeah. \nJULIE It's a process. \nHENRY Looks complicated. \nJULIE It's all pain. \n(THEN) Chekhov, right? They reach the Cafe. He opens the door for her : \nHENRY I thought you were listening. She looks at him, curiously. \nHENRY (CONT'D) I'm Henry by the way. \nJULIE Julie. \nINT. CAFE ORPHEUM - DAY \nThey enter. It's busy. \nPIERRE Madame Julie! \nJULIE Coffee, Pierre. She points at Henry. \nJULIE (CONT'D) You want one? \nHENRY Sure. \nSHE SIGNALS : \nJULIE Two. They stand right there at the bar. Silence. Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her shoulder. Looks at it. Then back at her. Comparing her photo to the live person. \nJULIE (CONT'D) What? She turns to see what he's looking at. A beat. \nJULIE (CONT'D) So what do you think? \nHENRY Doesn't look like you. \nJULIE No, I meant the poster. \nHENRY Oh. It's funny. \nJULIE Actors on a tree is funny? \nHENRY Yeah. She smiles. Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar. \nJULIE That's the director's joke. She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup. \nJULIE (CONT'D) He's making a comment on the American culture. Actors faces as falling fruit. Birth, death, the consumption of the ID. Henry's interested. \nJULIE (CONT'D) To him, the American dream has become the world's nightmare. \"You are the country of apocalypse.\" \n(THEN ) That's what he told us on the first day of rehearsal, anyway. \nHENRY Oh. \nJULIE The irony is, he loves the American dream. I mean that's why he's here, right? \n(WHISPERS) But I know for a fact he hates himself for loving it. It's always an inside job, isn't it? \nHENRY Yeah. I guess. Pause. \nJULIE But the truth is I wasn't listening. I was playing it safe. \n(THEN) He was right. The jerk. About that, anyway... She drinks her coffee. \nJULIE (CONT'D) You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's last play. He was dying when he wrote it. She thinks. He listens. \nJULIE (CONT'D) It's perfect. \nHENRY Why? \nJULIE (CONT'D It's my last play too. Here in Buffalo. \nHENRY You're leaving? She downs the last of her coffee. \n", "test1_true": "(THEN) I'm glad you came by. Thanks for not suing me. I'll see ya. She leaves. He watches her through the glass as she walks across the street...right past the bank on her way back to the theatre. \nINT. PRISON - MORNING \nMAX's cell door opens. He walks, happy and confident this morning. \nINMATE \n(CALLING OUT) Hey Barber, tomorrow lunch, right? \nMAX Right. \nANOTHER CONVICT Give `em hell! \nMAX I always do, Felipe! As Max reaches the end of the walkway, an OLD GUARD opens the next steel door for him. \nGUARD Morning, Max. Here we are again. \nMAX How's your grandson? \nGUARD Just started first grade. \nMAX That's great. The socialization begins! The Guard smiles as he leads him toward the PAROLE BOARD ROOM at the end of another long corridor. They stop at the door. \nGUARD How many more of these you think you got in you, Max? Pause. \nMAX As many as it takes. The Guard shakes his head, opens the door for him. \nINT. PAROLE REVIEW ROOM, PRISON - DAY \nA PAROLE BOARD OFFICER is reading Max's file as he enters. \nHEAD PAROLE REVIEWER Good afternoon, Mr. Saltzman. Take a seat. The OFFICER gestures to the chair. The other members of the Board stare at Max. The head Parole officer leafs through page after page of denied applications. Max watches the pages turning, the years of his life going by, taking it in... \nHEAD PAROLE REVIEWER \n(CONT'D) Mr. Saltzman. Could you please tell the board why you believe we should grant you parole? They all wait for Max's answer. He's silent. \nHEAD PAROLE REVIEWER \n(CONT'D) \n(HALF AMUSED) Come on, Mr. Saltzman, what have you got for us this time? Closer on Max. He looks like he might start to twitch at any moment.... \nHEAD PAROLE REVIEWER \n(CONT'D) (o.s.) Mr. Saltzman? \nMAX Well... \nEXT. PRISON GATE - DAY \nThe gigantic PRISON GATES clank open. Max emerges, a tiny figure against the imposing facade. He's holding a small black valise. Looks like it was made in the 40s. \nMax looks a little less sure of himself. \nHENRY Appears. Smiling. \nHENRY I knew you could do it. Max looks around nervously. \nMAX Where's the car? \nHENRY I don't have a car. \nMAX You don't have a car? What's wrong with you? You came to pick me up without a car. That's not picking a person up. \nHENRY Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up. \nMAX I don't know about this. Maybe this is a mistake. Max turns....walks back towards the gates. Starts to POUND on them. \nMAX (CONT'D) Dave! Carl! \nHENRY Max, it's okay. You're free. \nMAX Open up! DAVE! No response. Henry approaches. Takes Max's bag. \nHENRY Come on, Max. \nMAX I don't like this. \nHENRY Take it easy. There's nothing to be frightened of. I promise. You're okay. The bus station's just a short walk. Max starts to hyperventilate : \nMAX I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe... Henry hesitates a moment, puts an arm around him... \nHENRY You're going to be alright. \n", "test1_id": 2490, "test2_input": "JULIE Oh. \nMAX Henry, let's get out of these people's way! Henry turns to Julie. \nHENRY \n(TO JULIE) What are you doing after rehearsal? \nJULIE Why? \nHENRY Do you like Chinese? \nJULIE Yeah. \nHENRY Golden Dragon? \nJULIE It's okay. \nHENRY Eight o'clock? \nSHE DECIDES : \nJULIE Sure. They look at each other as ACTORS return to the stage. DAREK moves towards his place in the front seats. \nDAREK Work. Work! It's time to work Americans! \n(SEES HER) Even you Djula... Max grabs Henry -- \nMAX Let's go. \nHENRY See you, Julie. \nJULIE Stay out of jail. Henry waves. \nEXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER \nMax and Henry exit the back stage doors. \nMAX You were right, Henry. You got a nose like a bloodhound! \nHENRY You found it? \nMAX Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing room. \nHENRY Who? \nMAX Lophakin. We find a way to get into his dressing room and we're right as rain! Henry and Max notice FRANK standing at the corner of the alley having a cigarette. He glares at them as they pass... \nINT. APARTMENT, BATHROOM - LATER \nHenry gets ready for his date. Max keeps talking, sitting on the side of the tub as he draws the bath... \nMAX I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The pieces of the puzzle are on the table. All we got to do is put them in the right order! \n(THEN) The only thing is the dirt...where does the dirt from the tunnel go? \nHENRY What about the vault? \nMAX First things first. I'm on the dirt. \nHENRY Okay. How do I look? \nMAX Like Henry. \n(THEN) We had a good day, Kid. It's good to be back in the soup. \n(MORE) \nMAX (CONT'D) (he starts to take off his \nCLOTHES) Go have a nice supper. \nA CHOPSTICK Henry places it between a PLATE and a NAPKIN, linking them together like...a tunnel... \nINT. GOLDEN DRAGON - RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nHenry waits for Julie. He's all cleaned up. Fresh shirt. \nJULIE Sorry I'm late. I'm starving. She sits. Looks at the menu. A GUY who's leaving, sees her : \nGUY Julie. \nJULIE Bruce. The guy glances at Henry. Leaves. \nJULIE (CONT'D) That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry. She studies the menu. \nHENRY Hi. How was rehearsal? She puts it down. No answer. \n", "test2_true": "INT. RESTAURANT - LATER \nPLATES ARE CLEARED It's the end of the meal. Henry listens. \nJULIE I don't just want to be good, I want to be great. And I don't just want to be great in Buffalo. \nHENRY Where then? \nJULIE Don't laugh. \n(THEN) Hollywood. \nHe doesn't. \nHENRY I guess that's where people go. \nJULIE I don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto commercial. And it's not going to be. Soon as this thing is done I'm out of here. \n(THEN) Before it's too late. \nHENRY Sounds like a plan. The waitress brings over the check and the fortune cookies. \nJULIE I hate fortune cookies. \nINT. JULIE'S CAR - LATER \nJulie sings along to the radio, smoking half a joint from the ashtray. Henry watches her. Julie knows she's being watched. She's enjoying herself. \nHENRY We going anywhere in particular? \nJULIE (hits the joint) Want some? Henry shakes his head no. She turns the radio up. \nCUT TO : \nHENRY AND JULIE Walk along a precipice near some railings. They move closer to the ROAR. They look out at the flood-lit NIAGARA FALLS. Stand there a moment... \nJULIE (CONT'D) You know there's a whole bunch of bodies down there churning around. Just caught in the current. \n(BEAT) They all took the risk and look what happened to them. Same in death as they were in life. Imagine that. You kill yourself and nothing changes. \nThey both stare down into the roaring water. \nJULIE (CONT'D) All those dreams churning around down there. It makes you sick. \n(THEN) I got to get out of here. \nHENRY I get it. They start to walk... \nJULIE So what did you do before jail, Henry? \nHENRY I worked at a toll booth. \nJULIE Which one? \nHENRY Rainbow bridge. \nJULIE No! \nHENRY Yes. \nJULIE I had family that used to live on the other side. I took that bridge all the time. We must of met a hundred times! He nods. She's probably right. \nJULIE (CONT'D) Wow.

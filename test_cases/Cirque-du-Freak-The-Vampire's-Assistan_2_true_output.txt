DARREN Start running. Don't ever stop. Steve hesitates. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Darren starts off the rafter toward him. One last look of hate. 
STEVE Next time... And he's gone. Disappearing into the dark. Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide. 
DEBBIE Sam? Darren shakes his head. Sam didn't make it. 
She understands. Darren looks at Crepsley. He's a mess. 
DARREN Are you gonna be okay? 
CREPSLEY I just need to catch my breath. For a few days. Maybe a week. 
DARREN You think I made a mistake, don't you? 
CREPSLEY No. I think that you proved yourself human after all. Human. As Darren absorbs this kindness, smiles. 
DARREN Half human. What now? 
CREPSLEY What do you mean? 
DARREN There's a war on, isn't there? Crepsley shrugs. 
DARREN This world is crossed by fences. You have to decide which side you stand on. 
CREPSLEY Yes, yes. Black and white fences crossing very gray fields. 
DARREN It's not gray. I've met the bad guys. They need to be stopped. 
CREPSLEY I'm not sure it's my fight. 
DARREN But you said it. There's no in between. And the power of being alone is never going to be greater than the weakness. It's our fight. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT 
As PATRONS try to get as far as they can as quick as they can. We see Steve duck out, blending in. Mr. Tiny's Lincoln Continental pulls up. As Steve gets in... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FIELD - NEAR THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
Mr. Tall, Evra, Debbie, Darren and Crepsley. Crepsley sets Sam's body down in the grass. It's covered with one of Madam Truska's tent silks. As Crepsley's eyes meet Darren's... 
DARREN 
(A WHISPER) He was a good kid. It's weird, but I remember things about him even though I wasn't there when they happened. Even though it's impossible. A moment as Crepsley nods sadly at this most singular boy. 
CREPSLEY His blood is in you. 
MR. TALL I'll deal with the police when they come. What I'll say, I don't know. 
DEBBIE Say what happened. Some crazy guy showed up. Sam was in the wrong place at the wrong time. They're all quiet a moment. 
EVRA He was brave. 
DEBBIE 
(SADLY) For the only time in his life. 
DARREN He didn't die in vain. A beat. 
MR. TALL Time to fly or flit or whatever you call it. The sun won't wait all night.

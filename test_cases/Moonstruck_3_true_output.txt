RONNY (to Al) I think that's it. 
Al nods and walks off. Ronny leans forward to Loretta. 
RONNY What do you want to do now? 
LORETTA I wanna go home. 
EXT. A COLD AND EMPTY MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT 
Ronny and Loretta are walking. Their breath is coming out in long plumes. 
LORETTA It's really cold. 
RONNY Yeah. It smells like snow. 
They walk in silence for a moment, then Loretta speaks. 
LORETTA My mother guessed that my father was seeing somebody and I told her she was crazy. She looked like a real piece of cheap goods. But who am I to talk? 
Her eyes are full of tears. 
RONNY What's the matter? 
LORETTA How can you ask me that? 
RONNY You're making me feel guilty again. 
LORETTA You are guilty. I'm guilty. 
RONNY Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta. 
LORETTA I know what I know. 
RONNY And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again? 
LORETTA He didn't come! 
RONNY I'm here! 
LORETTA You're late! 
RONNY We're here. 
EXT. RONNY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
She looks. It's Ronny's building. 
LORETTA This is your place. 
RONNY That's right. 
LORETTA This is where we're going! 
RONNY Yeah. 
LORETTA The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever. 
She looks for his response. He makes none. 
LORETTA I went with you. (pause, nothing) Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone. (pause, nothing) Right? (nothing) A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what? (pause, nothing) Ronny? Are you listening to me? 
RONNY Yeah. 
LORETTA I'm really afraid. 
RONNY Why? 
LORETTA I'm afraid of who I am. 
RONNY I was. 
LORETTA And you're not now? 
He shakes his head. 
LORETTA Why not? 
RONNY I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.

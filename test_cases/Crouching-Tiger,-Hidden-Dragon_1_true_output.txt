Lo hovers at the window frame. 
LO So it's over? 
Jen pauses. 
JEN Yes. 
Lo thrusts a small object in her hand. 
He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall. 
MAID We heard noises. 
JEN It was just a cat. 
The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door. 
Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo has given her. 
EXT. WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY 
The noise and color of a wedding procession.  A marching band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a handsome white horse. 
INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY 
Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides silently in the bride's carriage. 
EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY 
Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city gate. 
YU You think Jade Fox will show up? 
LI She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl. 
INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY 
A small arrow flies into the carriage.  Jen calmly lifts the red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the panelling inside the carriage. 
We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen doesn't seem to notice. 
LO (v.o.) Jen!  Come with me!  You're mine! 
Lo runs wildly into the crowd.

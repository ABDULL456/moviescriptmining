PAUL I'll only be a minute. 
TRAFFIC WARDEN You've already been fifteen. 
Paul, realising that persuasion is futile, decides other means are necessary to despatch this nuisance. He looks down both sides of the street: the coast is clear. 
PAUL Look. Go on, look. 
TRAFFIC WARDEN At what, exactly? 
PAUL My van is half full. 
TRAFFIC WARDEN So? 
PAUL So I've just got to put you in, and I am off. 
Having made their way to the rear of the van, Paul opens the back doors. Paul smacks the traffic warden on the side of the head. The momentum carries the warden into the van, unconscious. Paul has another quick look round and Lifts the warden's legs up and pushes him deeper into the vehicle. 
INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY 
PLANK My neck, Dog. (Dog shows no sign of pity) That's the last bag? 
DOG (Turning to Mick.) How about you? All right? 
MICK I'll be fine when; have dealt with this little shit. Mick grabs the machete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun. 
DOG Do it quietly. 
Gloria, who has been forgotten by the Sloanes and unnoticed by Dog and troop, has sat through the whole episode without apparently realising the gravity of the situation. She is kick-started into action by the sure demise of Willie. The machine gun has been placed not too far away from her. She picks it up, and fires it into the already wounded body of Mick, who is almost instantaneously transformed into dog meat. Gloria, who has found a gear that nobody probably not even herself, knew existed, destroys everything she points at. Bodies jump for cover and Winston and the rest close their eyes and hope for the best. Eventually the gun, which seems to have a limitless supply of lead, goes quiet. We cut to close-ups of everybody opening their eyes cautiously. Looks of relief come from everyone, not least the Sloanes. Dog, who is closest, stands, walks straight up to her and punches her on the jaw Gloria is knocked out. 
What was that? Where did she come from? That's fucking it. Tie her up. We are getting out of here. 
EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY 
BACON Eh, bunk us up over the wall. 
BACON forces one of the windows open. He looks pleased and beckons the others over. They keep in contact with Soap by cellular phones. 
INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY 
EDDY Everything all right out there, Tom? 
TOM (on phone) Right as rain. 
EDDY Where the hell are we supposed to hide? 
Ed looks into an almost empty room in which they are to find cover. He shrugs, and goes to sort himself out a cup of tea. 
SOAP What are you doing, Ed? 
EDDY 
Do you want one? 
SOAP No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward. 
EDDY Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea. 
SOAP And look what happened to that. 
EDDY If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.

Carol appears, FACING CAMERA, not used to it. To one side stands David and behind them, the lab.

SPOCK Carol Marcus -- 
KIRK Yes.

CAROL I'm Dr. Carol Marcus, and I am the director of the Project Genesis team at Regula I. What exactly IS Genesis? Put simply, Genesis is a procedure whereby the molecular structure of any given matter can be restructured -- changed -- into anything else of identical mass.

SPOCK Fascinating. 
KIRK Wait -- 
CAROL Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.

react with wonder.

CAROL -- Unleashing, almost instantan- eously, what we call the Genesis effect. Particulate matter is reorganized and electrified -- with life introduced results. Instead of a dead moon, a living breathing planet, capable of sus- taining whatever life forms we see fit to deposit on it... The reformed object you see represents the merest fraction of the Genesis potential, should the Federation wish to pursue these experiments to their logical conclusion.

CAROL When we consider the problems of population and food supply, the usefulness of this process begins to become clear. This concludes this demonstration tape. Thank you for your attention. The Genesis team eagerly awaits the decision of the Federation regarding the next phase of our work. 
The tape becomes snowy and blinks off. 
Kirk looks at Bones and Spock -- they are stunned. 
SPOCK It literally is Genesis... 
KIRK The power of creation -- 
SPOCK Have they proceeded with their experiments? 
KIRK The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now -- 
BONES But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists? 
SPOCK It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix -- 
BONES It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying? 
SPOCK I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create -- 
BONES Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes -- 
SPOCK I don't dispute that in the wrong hands -- 
BONES Would you like to tell me whose are the right hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments? 
KIRK Gentlemen, this isn't -- 
SPOCK Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests -- 
BONES Logic?? We're talking about universal Armageddon, you inhuman bloodless... 
SAAVIK'S VOICE (intercom) Admiral, sensors indicate a vessel in our area, closing fast. 
KIRK What do you make of her? 
SAAVIK'S VOICE It's one of ours, Admiral... It's Reliant. 
SPOCK What's she doing here? 
KIRK Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he? 
68   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      68 
The whoosh of the turbo doors and Kirk, Bones and Spock assume their posts. Saavik stands next to Kirk's chair. 
UHURA She's not responding... 
KIRK Try the emergency channels...

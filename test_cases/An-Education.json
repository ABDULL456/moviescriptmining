{"test1_input": "13    INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY                                       13 \nJenny and two school friends, HATTIE and TINA, are sitting at a table in a typical late-50s coffee bar, sipping cappuccinos. Jenny is easily the most attractive of the three - and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest. HATTIE is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier; TINA is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. She is also the least middle-class of the three - she's clearly a scholarship girl. They are all dressed in an unflattering and unambiguous school uniform - no attempts to disguise it with more fashionable accessories. Jenny is smoking pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of pout. Tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. Jenny tuts her disapproval. Tina sighs, and puts her spoon down. \nJENNY The whole point about him is that he doesn't feel. \nTINA We still don't have to like him. \nJENNY Camus doesn't want you to like him. What he's trying to say is that feeling is bourgeois. Being engagee is bourgeois. His mother dies and he doesn't feel anything. He kills this Arab and he doesn't feel anything. \nTINA I wouldn't feel anything if my mother died. Does that make me an existentialist? \nJENNY No. That just makes you a cow. \nHATTIE Une vache. \nLaughter. \n14   EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY                                   14 \nJenny, Hattie and Tina emerge from the cafe, talking. \nJENNY Well I'm going to be French. I'm going to Paris and I'm going to smoke and listen to Jacques Brel and wear black. And I won't speak. Ever. C'est plus chic, comme... \nShe breaks off. Parked outside a tobacconists on the other side of the road is the red Bristol. She looks towards the shop, and David emerges with a copy of the Times and a packet of cigars. Jenny crosses the road to talk to him while the others watch. \nDAVID Hello. \nJENNY Hello. Thank you. \nDAVID How did it go? \nJENNY Oh, fine. I think. I mean, I didn't mess my bit up, anyway. And no-one got thrown out of the orchestra afterwards. \nDAVID Always the mark of a cultural triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran into you. What are you doing on Friday? \nJENNY Going to school. \nDAVID I meant the evening. \nJENNY (embarrassed) Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing. \nDAVID Because I'm going to listen to some Schubert in St John's, Smith Square. My friends Danny and Helen will be going too, so it wouldn't be...I'll tell you what. I'll come and pick you up, and if your mother and father disapprove, then you can have the tickets and go with one of them. How does that sound? \nJenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and his eagerness to please seems to convince her. \nJENNY Thank you. And I'd like you to take me. I'd like to go with someone who knows when to clap. \nDAVID I usually watch Danny. He knows that sort of thing. \nJenny smiles. \nDAVID Seven? And we'll probably go for a spot of supper afterwards, if you...But if you, if that's not...Well, we can always put you in a taxi. \nJENNY (flat disbelief) Supper. \nDAVID If you want. \nJENNY The trouble is, we'll already have eaten. \nDAVID Well. I mean, if you'd like supper, then, perhaps on Friday you could...not eat? \nJENNY (embarrassed again) Oh. Yes. Of course. \nJenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of the road. Tina and Hattie are standing there almost with their mouths open, amazed. She doesn't say anything and starts to walk on. \nTINA I'm sorry. I just had the strangest dream. I dreamed you crossed the road and spoke to a handsome man with the most beautiful car I've ever seen. And then you came back and you didn't mention it. \nJenny smiles enigmatically. Tina grabs Jenny mock-urgently. \nTINA `Oo wazzee? \nJENNY (light, playful) Just a man who's been trying to pick me up. We're going to a concert on Friday night. And then we're having a spot of supper. \nTINA (shrieking) A spot of supper? \nJENNY You've heard of supper? \nHATTIE We've heard of it. But we've never eaten it. \nJENNY Neither of you is interested in the concert part, I notice. \n", "test1_true": "TINA Oh my God! I've only just realised! That's what's going to happen to you, isn't it? Look at her! Men are going to pick her up in the street and take her out to supper! \nHATTIE God, you're right, Tina. I hadn't thought of that. Look at her. \nJENNY Don't be so daft. \nTINA We're trying to attract the attention of boys. \nAnd she's fighting off men. Anyway. You're going to have to tell us more than that. \nJENNY Why? \nHATTIE Because no man's ever   going to ask us out to supper.   Not until we're ladies, anyway.   You're going to have to tell   us everything. Otherwise   it's not fair. \nJENNY There won't be anything to tell. \nTINA Well, make something up, then. \n15   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                  15 \nJenny is dressed up for her evening out. She looks good, but also stiff, uncomfortable - she's not herself in her dress, which looks too old for her. Her father is standing in front of her, shouting. \nJACK I won't allow it! \nJENNY (coolly) Fine. He's quite happy for you to take me. \nJACK (uncertainly) Right. I will. \nJENNY Good. \nJACK Where is it? \nJENNY St John's Smith Square. \nJACK Where's that? \nJENNY I don't know. I'm sure we could find out. \nMarjorie comes into the room. \nMARJORIE It's in Westminster. Just around the corner from the Abbey. \nJack looks at her as if she'd just given directions to the nearest opium den. \nJACK How d'you know that? \nMARJORIE I had a life before we were married, you know. \nJENNY He soon put a stop to that. \nJACK There we are. \nJENNY Where are we? \nJACK Near Westminster Abbey. I'm not going all the way over there. \nJENNY The trouble is, that's where St John's Smith Square is. \nJACK And I've just said. That's where I'm not going. There must be something on locally. Where's the paper? \nMARJORIE Jack, she wants to see someone who can play. She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland scratching away. I'll take her. \nJACK And how are you going to get over there? RAF helicopter? \nThe doorbell rings. \nJENNY That's him. Now what? \nJACK Oh, bloody hell. \nMARJORIE Jack! \nJenny starts towards the door, and then turns. \nJENNY Oh, and by the way...David's a Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch yourself. \nShe   goes to the door. \nJACK (panic-stricken and shouting) What's she talking about? I've never said anything like that in my life! Anyway, it's just an expression! I'm not against the Jews! \n", "test1_id": 864, "test2_input": "Jenny comes back in with David, who is dressed stylishly in his early-60s young executive leisurewear - sports jacket, slacks, cashmere sweater. He looks out of place - he is brighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most colourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly exotic. \nDavid has obviously heard Jack's last line. \nDAVID (pleasantly) I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David Goldman. \nHe offers his hand. \nJACK I didn't mean I'm not against you... Actually, I did mean that, because I'm not, but... \nJENNY Dad! \nDavid's hand is still extended - in his confusion and embarrassment, Jack hasn't yet taken it. He does so now, and shakes it for way too long. \nJACK I'm sorry. What I'm saying is that you're not the sort of, of person I'd be against, if I were the sort of person who was against...people. You're not an old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and this is Marjorie. \nDAVID (deadpan) You didn't tell me you had a sister, Jenny. \nGeneral confusion, until David chuckles naughtily. Marjorie giggles, and then offers her hand. \nDAVID You're a lucky man, Jack. \nJACK I suppose I am, yes. \nThey all sit down. \nDAVID So. Gosh. (He looks around approvingly.) This is lovely. \nMarjorie smiles. \nMARJORIE Thank you. \nJACK I'm sorry, David. Can I get you a drink? \nDAVID I'd love one, Jack, but we're running a little late. If Jenny's ready, perhaps we'll shoot off. \nJenny looks at her father, and takes a calculated gamble. \nJENNY Ah. Well. Dad's got something to tell you. \nJACK No, no, nothing...It was more of a question, really. How would you get to St John's Smith Square from here? For future reference? \nDAVID Oh, it's a pretty straight run, really. Up to Hammersmith, take the A4 through Kensington and you're there. \nJACK Simple as that. \nDAVID Simple as that. \nJack smiles broadly. \nMARJORIE (playfully) So shall I book some tickets for something? \nJACK (still smiling) No. \nBeat. \nJACK Back by ten, please, David. She's usually in bed by then. \nJenny winces. \nDAVID I was hoping Jenny would come with me afterwards to have a bite of supper with my aunt Helen. \nJenny studies him carefully. Suddenly his friends Danny and Helen have become `Aunt Helen'. \nJACK Oh, well, I suppose... \nDAVID How about if I promise to have her in by eleven thirty? \nJACK Well, it's Friday night. And if you're going out to the West End... \nDAVID Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it. See you again. \nThey exchange warm handshakes. He turns to Marjorie. Marjorie extends her hand. David takes it, but kisses it suavely,leaving her a little flustered. \nMARJORIE Have a nice time. \nJENNY Bye. \nJenny and David leave. \nJACK (sniffing the air) What's that smell? Has he got perfume on? \n", "test2_true": "JACK At least there's no confusion, if you smell of carbolic soap. \nMarjorie rolls her eyes. \nMARJORIE Nobody's ever going to get confused about you, dear. \n15A   EXT. ST JOHN'S, SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                        15A \nJenny and David walk toward the beautiful hall. Jenny suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for her - other adults are milling around outside, and the women don't look like girls dressed up. David makes for an incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late twenties who are waiting outside - DANNY and HELEN. Helen is as far from anyone's idea of an aunt as one can get. She's no more beautiful than Jenny, but she's dressed both appropriately and spectacularly, in early-60s, pre-hippy Bohemian gear. She turns heads in a way that Jenny is not yet able to. Danny too is attractive, but soberly so. David and Jenny are, in a way, paler, less striking versions of these two. \nDAVID Hello hello. Are we late? \nHELEN I was hoping we'd miss the beginning, and then it wouldn't be worth going in, and we could go off dancing or something. \nDANNY Helen is one of the more reluctant members of tonight's audience. \nJenny and David laugh politely. \nDAVID Jenny, these are my friends Helen and Danny. \nJenny shakes hands with the two of them. They both give her fascinated and clearly appraising looks. They have heard about her. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Shall we? \nThey walk into the hall. \n16   INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                         16 \nIt's a beautiful hall - Jenny is dazzled by the surroundings and the company. She's particularly bowled over by Helen. \nHELEN Look. We can leave our coats over there. I want to get rid of this. \nShe nods at the coat she's carrying. Jenny looks thrilled at the prospect of spending a couple of minutes with Helen. Danny hands Helen his coat, without saying anything. The girls walk over to another reception table a few yards away, behind which is a cloakroom. A lady is exchanging overcoats for tickets. Almost involuntarily, Jenny touches the sleeve of Helen's velvety jacket. She stops herself. Helen notices. \nJENNY I'm so sorry. \nHELEN (amused) That's OK. It's nice, isn't it? \nJENNY It's beautiful. Where did it come from? \nHELEN Oh, South Ken somewhere. \nHelen looks at Jenny's outfit, her frumpy `smart' dress, apparently wanting to return the compliment. \nHELEN (nodding at the dress) This is...Well, it's good for this sort of concert, isn't it? \nJENNY (quietly) Thank you. \nHelen is now at the front of the queue, and hands her coat over imperiously. \nHELEN We should go shopping together one day, if you want. \nShe takes a ticket from the cloakroom lady. \nJENNY That would be nice. But South Ken... C'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi. \nThey stare at each other. Helen is bewildered, Jenny embarrassed. \nHELEN Sorry? \nJENNY I just said....It was too expensive for me. \nHELEN No you didn't. You said something completely different. \nJENNY I just...Well, I said it in French. \nHELEN In French? Why? \nJenny feels humiliated; she is yet to realise what we can see - that Helen is simply very dim. \nJENNY I don't know. \nJenny looks away. Helen stares at her. The performance bell rings, and they make their way back to the men. To Jenny's surprise and pleasure, Helen links arms with her as they walk. \nHELEN Anyway. It's too expensive for me, too. We don't have to worry about that. If you want something in South Ken, get David to take you shopping. \nJENNY Why on earth would he want to take me shopping? \nHelen makes a knowing face. \n", "test2_id": 865, "test3_input": "33   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM/UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                   33 \nJenny is deep in her schoolwork. She has a Latin vocabulary propped open on the window-ledge. She looks at it, walks away, mutters to herself, attempting to memorize. Her concentration is broken by a sudden gale of laughter from downstairs. \n34   INT. JENNY'S HALL. NIGHT                                    34 \nShe stands outside the living room for a moment, listening. She hears a man's voice that does not belong to her father, and then more laughter from her father and mother. \n35   INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT                                     35 \nDavid is in the middle of demonstrating his ability to mimic all of the Goons. Jack and Marjorie are laughing so hard that they can hardly see - they certainly miss Jenny's entrance. \nJENNY (curious) Hello. \nJACK Oh. Hello. David does the most brilliant Bluebottle, Jenny. Actually, he can do all the Goons. \nDAVID I don't think I'm very good at Eccles. \nJACK Oh, no, you've got him... \nJENNY (impatiently) But what's he doing here? \nDAVID I wasn't going to disturb you. I knew you'd have your nose to the grindstone. \nJENNY (incredulous) You came to see Mum and Dad? \nJACK Is that so hard to imagine? \nJenny spies an open bottle of wine on the coffee-table. \nJENNY And you're drinking? But it's not Christmas! \nJACK Hark at her! Makes us sound as though we've signed the pledge. You don't know everything about us, you know. We had a life before you came along. \nJENNY Yes, that's true. I'm only going on what I've seen over the last sixteen years. \nMARJORIE I'm trying to think what you missed. Nothing much comes to mind. \nJACK They can't stand to see me enjoying myself. \nJENNY Anyway. Would you excuse me? I've got a huge pile of Latin translation to do. \nJACK You didn't tell me David went to Oxford. \nJenny looks at David, who stares back at her straight- faced. \nJENNY No. I didn't. \nDAVID For all the good it did me. \nJACK What did you read? \nDAVID Oh, English. Just like every other semi-employed layabout in London. \nJACK (marvelling at the coincidence) English! Which college? \nDAVID Merton. \nMARJORIE Isn't that funny? \nJENNY Extraordinary. \nDAVID I was just telling Jack that I'm going back next weekend. I go and see my old professor every now and again. \nJACK That's what you need, Jenny. Someone on the inside track. It's not always what you know, is it, David? \nDAVID Too true. And Clive would love Jenny. Have you ever come across Clive Lewis? \nJENNY Dad has never come across anyone. \nDAVID I just thought he might know some of the books. \nJENNY Dad has never read any books. \nJACK (stung) What's he written? \nDAVID He wrote a children's book called `The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' that did very well, I believe. \nMARJORIE CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're talking about? \nDAVID Well, to us he was just the old codger who taught Medieval literature. But I came to know him very well. We just...got along, do you know what I mean? \n", "test3_true": "MARJORIE Jenny used to love those books. \nDAVID Gosh. That dates me. He was writing them when I was there. \nJENNY I'd love to meet him. \nThere is a pause. Jack and Marjorie look at the floor. Somehow, David has manoeuvred a situation where, effectively, he is the one being asked. \nDAVID I'm sorry. I'm being slow on the uptake. Would Jenny like to come with me at the weekend? \nJACK Well, I don't know about this weekend. But one day, yes, thank you. \nJENNY How often do you see him? \nDAVID Oh, once every couple of years. But next time, eh? \nJENNY (disappointed) Hopefully I'll be there by then. So that won't be much use. \nJACK (dubiously) Well, I suppose...Would she have to stay the night? \nDAVID Well, I wouldn't want to drive back after one of those Oxford dinners. \nJack chuckles knowingly. \nDAVID Clive will get her a room in college. That's easy enough. \nMARJORIE Sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up. \nJENNY Please, Daddy. It would be so helpful to know something about the place. \nJACK Would it be a bother to you, David? \nDAVID I'd be delighted. \nJack, Marjorie and Jenny all beam. \n36   INT. HALLWAY.

Jenny is sitting at the dressing table, being made up by Helen. Jenny looks three or four years older, more sophisticated....more like Helen. She can't believe it. She looks in the mirror, and for a moment, she forgets to breathe. \nHELEN There. You'll do. You can keep it. I can only wear so many every day. \nJenny emerges from her reverie. \nJENNY (thrilled) Really? Thank you. \nHELEN What about tonight? Will you be needing a nightie?

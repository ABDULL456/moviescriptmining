We see girls doing what girls did in a nice girls' school in 1962: walking with books on their heads, practising their handwriting, making cakes, playing lacrosse, dancing with each other. \n1A   INT. CLASSROOM. DAY                                          1A \nIn one of the classrooms, MISS STUBBS, an attractive, bright, animated schoolteacher, is talking to a small group of sixteen-year-old girls. Some of these girls seem to be daydreaming - looking out of the window, examining their fingernails. A couple, including a bespectacled girl who looks five years younger than everyone else in the class, write down everything the teacher says. Only one, JENNY, beautiful and animated, seems to be listening in the spirit in which Miss Stubbs would like her to listen. She's smiling, eyes shining - she loves Miss Stubbs, and these lessons. Miss Stubbs asks a question, and Jenny puts up her hand - the only one in the class to do so. \nMISS STUBBS (mock-sighing) Jenny. Again. \nJENNY Isn't it because Mr Rochester's blind? \n2    INT. BEDROOM. DAY                                             2 \nJenny's bedroom. Books about ponies, a much loved teddy bear; a cello huge in the small room leans against the wall. \nJenny is bent over a small desk. Victorian novels, Latin primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side of her. She stands and stretches as she turns to us. \nShe kneels and flicks through her half-dozen or so LPs on the floor near a cheap record player - they're all classical, mostly by Elgar, apart from a Juliette Greco record. This is the one she chooses. As the music begins, she sings along. \nImmediately there is a thumping noise - someone underneath her is banging on the ceiling impatiently. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) I don't want to hear any French singing. French singing wasn't on the syllabus, last time I looked. \nJenny sighs, and reaches for the volume control. She turns the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her head right next to the Dansette to hear it. \nClose on Jenny as she silently mouths the words along with the almost inaudible track. \n3   INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY                                         3 \nJenny, her mother and father are finishing Sunday lunch. Jenny's father JACK is in his forties, MARJORIE, her mother is slightly younger than Jack, but every bit as middle- aged. The food is grey and brown, in keeping with the colour scheme of the house. They aren't talking - they're listening to Mantovani on the radio. Jenny gets up from the lunch table. \nJENNY I've got an English essay to do by tomorrow morning. \nJACK I don't want to hear anything through the ceiling this afternoon, apart from the sound of sweat dripping onto textbooks. \nJENNY Cello? \nJACK No cello. \nJENNY I thought we agreed that cello was my interest or hobby? \nJACK It's already your interest or hobby. When they ask you \"What's your interest or hobby?\" at your Oxford interview, you can say, \"Cello\". That wouldn't be a lie. You don't need to practise a hobby. A hobby is a hobby. \nJENNY Or interest. \nJACK (ignoring her) You don't need to be good at it. You just have to be interested in it. \nJENNY Can I stop going to the youth orchestra, then? \nJACK No. The orchestra shows you're a joiner-inner. Universities like joiner-inners. \nJENNY Ah. Yes. But. I've already joined in. So now I can stop. \nJACK Well, if you stop, that shows the opposite, doesn't it? That shows you're a rebel. They don't want that at Oxford. \nJENNY No. They don't want people who think for themselves. \nJACK (missing the sarcasm, as is his wont) Course they don't. \n4   INT. SCHOOL HALL. DAY                                         4 \nJenny with cello sits in the string section. Everyone is getting settled, tuning up, latecomers still arriving. Along the row from Jenny, tuning his violin, is a nice- looking boy of her age, GRAHAM, and she waves at him. Two 13 year old boys sitting between them wave too, parodically, and then blow kisses, much to Graham's embarrassment and Jenny's fury. \nThe silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles: this is clearly one of the funniest moments of their lives - until one of them farts noisily and, it would appear from all the frantic gesturing, pungently. The comic value of the fart tops even the comic value of the wave, and they are scarcely able to stay seated, such is their mirth. \n5   EXT. SCHOOL. DAY                                              5 \nJenny and Graham are talking while he struggles to take his bike out of a bicycle rack slightly unbalanced by the violin strapped to his back. Graham is nervous, chronically unconfident and shy. \nGRAHAM Should I wear, you know, Sunday best? \nJENNY You'd better, I'm afraid. Just to show my father you're un jeune homme serieux, not a teddy boy. \n13    INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY                                       13 \nJenny and two school friends, HATTIE and TINA, are sitting at a table in a typical late-50s coffee bar, sipping cappuccinos. Jenny is easily the most attractive of the three - and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest. HATTIE is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier; TINA is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. She is also the least middle-class of the three - she's clearly a scholarship girl. They are all dressed in an unflattering and unambiguous school uniform - no attempts to disguise it with more fashionable accessories. Jenny is smoking pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of pout. Tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. Jenny tuts her disapproval. Tina sighs, and puts her spoon down. \nJENNY The whole point about him is that he doesn't feel. \nTINA We still don't have to like him. \nJENNY Camus doesn't want you to like him. What he's trying to say is that feeling is bourgeois. Being engagee is bourgeois. His mother dies and he doesn't feel anything. He kills this Arab and he doesn't feel anything. \nTINA I wouldn't feel anything if my mother died. Does that make me an existentialist? \nJENNY No. That just makes you a cow. \nHATTIE Une vache. \nLaughter. \n14   EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY                                   14 \nJenny, Hattie and Tina emerge from the cafe, talking. \nJENNY Well I'm going to be French. I'm going to Paris and I'm going to smoke and listen to Jacques Brel and wear black. And I won't speak. Ever. C'est plus chic, comme... \nShe breaks off. Parked outside a tobacconists on the other side of the road is the red Bristol. She looks towards the shop, and David emerges with a copy of the Times and a packet of cigars. Jenny crosses the road to talk to him while the others watch. \nDAVID Hello. \nJENNY Hello. Thank you. \nDAVID How did it go? \nJENNY Oh, fine. I think. I mean, I didn't mess my bit up, anyway. And no-one got thrown out of the orchestra afterwards. \nDAVID Always the mark of a cultural triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran into you. What are you doing on Friday? \nJENNY Going to school. \nDAVID I meant the evening. \nJENNY (embarrassed) Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing. \nDAVID Because I'm going to listen to some Schubert in St John's, Smith Square. My friends Danny and Helen will be going too, so it wouldn't be...I'll tell you what. I'll come and pick you up, and if your mother and father disapprove, then you can have the tickets and go with one of them. How does that sound? \nJenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and his eagerness to please seems to convince her. \nJENNY Thank you. And I'd like you to take me. I'd like to go with someone who knows when to clap. \nDAVID I usually watch Danny. He knows that sort of thing. \nJenny smiles. \nDAVID Seven? And we'll probably go for a spot of supper afterwards, if you...But if you, if that's not...Well, we can always put you in a taxi. \nJENNY (flat disbelief) Supper. \nDAVID If you want. \nJENNY The trouble is, we'll already have eaten. \nDAVID Well. I mean, if you'd like supper, then, perhaps on Friday you could...not eat? \nJENNY (embarrassed again) Oh. Yes. Of course. \nJenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of the road. Tina and Hattie are standing there almost with their mouths open, amazed. She doesn't say anything and starts to walk on. \nTINA I'm sorry. I just had the strangest dream. I dreamed you crossed the road and spoke to a handsome man with the most beautiful car I've ever seen. And then you came back and you didn't mention it. \nJenny smiles enigmatically. Tina grabs Jenny mock-urgently. \nTINA `Oo wazzee? \nJENNY (light, playful) Just a man who's been trying to pick me up. We're going to a concert on Friday night. And then we're having a spot of supper. \nTINA (shrieking) A spot of supper? \nJENNY You've heard of supper? \nHATTIE We've heard of it. But we've never eaten it. \nJENNY Neither of you is interested in the concert part, I notice. \nJenny comes back in with David, who is dressed stylishly in his early-60s young executive leisurewear - sports jacket, slacks, cashmere sweater. He looks out of place - he is brighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most colourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly exotic. \nDavid has obviously heard Jack's last line. \nDAVID (pleasantly) I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David Goldman. \nHe offers his hand. \nJACK I didn't mean I'm not against you... Actually, I did mean that, because I'm not, but... \nJENNY Dad! \nDavid's hand is still extended - in his confusion and embarrassment, Jack hasn't yet taken it. He does so now, and shakes it for way too long. \nJACK I'm sorry. What I'm saying is that you're not the sort of, of person I'd be against, if I were the sort of person who was against...people. You're not an old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and this is Marjorie. \nDAVID (deadpan) You didn't tell me you had a sister, Jenny. \nGeneral confusion, until David chuckles naughtily. Marjorie giggles, and then offers her hand. \nDAVID You're a lucky man, Jack. \nJACK I suppose I am, yes. \nThey all sit down. \nDAVID So. Gosh. (He looks around approvingly.) This is lovely. \nMarjorie smiles. \nMARJORIE Thank you. \nJACK I'm sorry, David. Can I get you a drink? \nDAVID I'd love one, Jack, but we're running a little late. If Jenny's ready, perhaps we'll shoot off. \nJenny looks at her father, and takes a calculated gamble. \nJENNY Ah. Well. Dad's got something to tell you. \nJACK No, no, nothing...It was more of a question, really. How would you get to St John's Smith Square from here? For future reference? \nDAVID Oh, it's a pretty straight run, really. Up to Hammersmith, take the A4 through Kensington and you're there. \nJACK Simple as that. \nDAVID Simple as that. \nJack smiles broadly. \nMARJORIE (playfully) So shall I book some tickets for something? \nJACK (still smiling) No. \nBeat. \nJACK Back by ten, please, David. She's usually in bed by then. \nJenny winces. \nDAVID I was hoping Jenny would come with me afterwards to have a bite of supper with my aunt Helen. \nJenny studies him carefully. Suddenly his friends Danny and Helen have become `Aunt Helen'. \nJACK Oh, well, I suppose... \nDAVID How about if I promise to have her in by eleven thirty? \nJACK Well, it's Friday night. And if you're going out to the West End... \nDAVID Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it. See you again. \nThey exchange warm handshakes. He turns to Marjorie. Marjorie extends her hand. David takes it, but kisses it suavely,leaving her a little flustered. \nMARJORIE Have a nice time. \nJENNY Bye. \nJenny and David leave. \nJACK (sniffing the air) What's that smell? Has he got perfume on? \n17   INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                           17 \nDavid, Jenny, Danny and Helen in a row in the middle of the auditorium, watching the stage and listening to the music. Jenny can't concentrate - she's too excited by the occasion and the company. Jenny sneaks a glance at Helen, who stares straight ahead, unblinking and enigmatic. David is smiling, as if he's trying to communicate enjoyment; Danny's eyes flicker across the stage - he understands the music, its component parts, which musicians are contributing what. Jenny takes it all in. \n18   EXT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                           18 \nJenny, David, Danny and Helen emerge with the other concert- goers. \nDAVID I booked a table at Juliette's. Will that kill the mood, do you think? \nHELEN Oh, I do hope so. \nThe others laugh. \nHELEN I always think I'm going to my own funeral when I listen to classical music. (Tentatively) That was classical, wasn't it? \nDANNY Yes. Very classical. As classical as you can get. \nHelen looks pleased. \nDAVID Juliette's it is, then. Heaven forbid that we should end the evening reflecting on our own mortality. \nJenny smiles in delight. She's never met people like this. \n19   INT. JULIETTE'S. NIGHT                                       19 \nA singer in the Julie London mould is singing `I'm In The Mood For Love' while cigarette girls and glamorous waitresses patrol the tables. \nJenny is sitting with the others at a table in the club, eating and talking. She looks about twelve, but she's thrilled to be there. We know now that her life can never be the same again, and there will be no going back to fish- paste sandwiches with spotty Graham. \nDAVID Have you never heard \"Chante Francoise Sagan\"? \nJenny shakes her head. Her eyes are wide - she's clearly awe-struck. David offers her a cigarette - a Gitane - which she takes. He lights it for her while she's listening. \nDANNY Oh, it's wonderful. \nJENNY I've only got....Well, I think it's just called `Juliette Greco'. The one with the eyes on the sleeve. I saved up and got my French conversation teacher to bring it back after Christmas. \nHELEN You've got a French conversation teacher? \nJENNY Yes. \nHELEN Is that why you suddenly speak French for no reason? \nDANNY (ignoring her) You must have seen her sing? \nJenny shakes her head again and smiles. Where would she have seen Juliette Greco? Danny, meanwhile, is baffled. Who hasn't seen Juliette Greco? \nDAVID She's marvellous. \nDANNY But you should see her in Paris, not here. David will take you. \nDAVID I'd love to. You'd fit right in. \nHELEN (sympathetically) Better than here, really. \nDAVID It's wonderful to find a young person who wants to know things. There's so much I want you to see. \nThey sip their drinks pensively, possibly to allow time for the double-entendre to disappear into the smoke. \nDAVID Are you still all right to come and have a look at that Pembroke Villas place with me on Friday, Danny? \nDANNY Oh. No. Can't do it. There's a Burne-Jones coming up at Christie's on Friday. And I want it. \nJENNY (laughing in disbelief) You're thinking of buying a Burne- Jones? A real one? \nDANNY I just have a feeling that the pre-Raphaelites are going to take off. \nJENNY I love the pre-Raphaelites. \nDAVID (excited by her education) Do you? \nJENNY Yes, of course. Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway. Not Holman Hunt, so much. He's so garish. \nDanny looks at her. There's clearly more to this schoolgirl than he thought. \nDAVID Absolutely! Why don't we all go to the auction? Wouldn't that be fun? \nJENNY An auction. Gosh. How exciting. \nDANNY Next Friday morning. David will pick you up. \n22   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT                                  22 \nJenny at her desk, working. She puts down her pen, distracted. \n23   INT. DAVID'S CAR. DAY                                        23 \nDavid sitting in his Bristol, waiting. \n24   EXT. SCHOOL. DAY                                             24 \nWe see the Bristol parked outside, and Jenny walking towards it, a small figure in a large playground. She's clearly just changed out of her school uniform, and she's making last-minute adjustments to her civvies. A teacher walks towards her, and Jenny almost freezes - but the teacher merely smiles pleasantly and walks past. Jenny keeps walking at a measured pace for a moment and then breaks into a run. \n25   INT/EXT. CAR/DILAPIDATED HOUSE. DAY                          25 \nJenny and David are driving along a North Kensington street. \nJENNY How do you know Danny? \nDavid is distracted. He's driving slowly, apparently looking for an address. \nDAVID Oh, you know. We kept bumping into each other, and we became pals, and we've ended up doing a bit of work together, when it suits us. \nJENNY What kind of work? \nDAVID Property. A bit of art dealing. Some buying and selling. This and that... \nHe stops the car. \nDAVID I'll be two seconds. \nHe gets out of the car, and Jenny watches him as he crosses the road. \nOutside a dilapidated house covered in scaffolding stands a large West Indian family, mother, father, three or four small children and a dog. They are surrounded by what appears to be all their worldly goods. David squats down on his haunches, talks to the kids, tousles the hair of the smallest. Then he takes out a bunch of keys and ushers the family down the path. He unlocks the door and leads them inside. \nIn an upper window of the house, we see an old lady peering down anxiously. \n26   EXT. STREET/DILAPIDATED HOUSE. DAY                           26 \nDavid emerges from the house, jangling his keys. \n27   INT. CAR. DAY                                                27 \nJenny opens the glove compartment where David keeps his cigarettes, takes out the packet, removes one for herself, offers the packet to David as he gets into the car. He lights them both. \nDAVID I'm sorry about that. \nJENNY How do you know those, those ...Negro people? \nDAVID They're clients. \nJENNY Clients? \nDAVID Jenny darling, even schwarzers have to live somewhere. And it's not as if they can rent off their own kind, is it? \nHe starts the car and drives off. \nJENNY I'm not sure I quite understand what you do. \nDAVID You don't need to. It's too boring. All you need to know is that I work in property so that I can take you to nice places. \nJenny's POV of the black family in one window, and the little old lady disappearing from another. \n28   INT. CHRISTIE'S. DAY                                           28 \nDanny intent on a catalogue, Helen gazing dreamily into space, as David and Jenny push their way through the crowded auction room. The auctioneer burbles on in the background. \nDANNY You nearly missed it. \nJenny is in awe of rich London in all its finery. The auctioneer clears his throat. \nAUCTIONEER We turn to lot 41, The Tree of Forgiveness, by Sir Edward Burne- Jones. This is a rare opportunity to purchase a key work of the Pre- Raphaelite movement. Who will start me off at five hundred guineas? \nJenny glances at Danny. He makes no move at this price. Neither does anyone else. He's poised and listening hard. \nAUCTIONEER Two hundred? \nA middle-aged lady, the epitome of the middle-aged contemporary Sloane, twin-set, pearls and a lot of      face powder, raises her hand. \nAUCTIONEER Thank you, madam. Three hundred? \nA man raises his hand. \n33   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM/UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                   33 \nJenny is deep in her schoolwork. She has a Latin vocabulary propped open on the window-ledge. She looks at it, walks away, mutters to herself, attempting to memorize. Her concentration is broken by a sudden gale of laughter from downstairs. \n34   INT. JENNY'S HALL. NIGHT                                    34 \nShe stands outside the living room for a moment, listening. She hears a man's voice that does not belong to her father, and then more laughter from her father and mother. \n35   INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT                                     35 \nDavid is in the middle of demonstrating his ability to mimic all of the Goons. Jack and Marjorie are laughing so hard that they can hardly see - they certainly miss Jenny's entrance. \nJENNY (curious) Hello. \nJACK Oh. Hello. David does the most brilliant Bluebottle, Jenny. Actually, he can do all the Goons. \nDAVID I don't think I'm very good at Eccles. \nJACK Oh, no, you've got him... \nJENNY (impatiently) But what's he doing here? \nDAVID I wasn't going to disturb you. I knew you'd have your nose to the grindstone. \nJENNY (incredulous) You came to see Mum and Dad? \nJACK Is that so hard to imagine? \nJenny spies an open bottle of wine on the coffee-table. \nJENNY And you're drinking? But it's not Christmas! \nJACK Hark at her! Makes us sound as though we've signed the pledge. You don't know everything about us, you know. We had a life before you came along. \nJENNY Yes, that's true. I'm only going on what I've seen over the last sixteen years. \nMARJORIE I'm trying to think what you missed. Nothing much comes to mind. \nJACK They can't stand to see me enjoying myself. \nJENNY Anyway. Would you excuse me? I've got a huge pile of Latin translation to do. \nJACK You didn't tell me David went to Oxford. \nJenny looks at David, who stares back at her straight- faced. \nJENNY No. I didn't. \nDAVID For all the good it did me. \nJACK What did you read? \nDAVID Oh, English. Just like every other semi-employed layabout in London. \nJACK (marvelling at the coincidence) English! Which college? \nDAVID Merton. \nMARJORIE Isn't that funny? \nJENNY Extraordinary. \nDAVID I was just telling Jack that I'm going back next weekend. I go and see my old professor every now and again. \nJACK That's what you need, Jenny. Someone on the inside track. It's not always what you know, is it, David? \nDAVID Too true. And Clive would love Jenny. Have you ever come across Clive Lewis? \nJENNY Dad has never come across anyone. \nDAVID I just thought he might know some of the books. \nJENNY Dad has never read any books. \nJACK (stung) What's he written? \nDAVID He wrote a children's book called `The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' that did very well, I believe. \nMARJORIE CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're talking about? \nDAVID Well, to us he was just the old codger who taught Medieval literature. But I came to know him very well. We just...got along, do you know what I mean? \nHis eyes stray to her breasts. Jenny stares at him. \nJENNY You just want to see them? \nDAVID I just want to see them. \nJenny, flustered and nervous, looks at her nightgown - she doesn't know what to do. \nDAVID Let it fall from your shoulders. \nShe does so. He stares. \nDAVID Thank you. \nHe sits up, and lovingly lifts the straps back up. He smiles at her. Relieved, she smiles back. \n47   INT/EXT. CAR COTTAGE. DAY                                     47 \nThe Bristol, containing David and Jenny in the front seats and Danny and Helen in the back, passing through a pretty Oxfordshire village. It pulls up outside a country cottage with a `FOR SALE' sign outside. \n48    INT. CAR. DAY                                              48 \nDAVID Might be worth a look. \n49    EXT. CAR COTTAGE. DAY                                      49 \nThe four get out of the car, and Jenny follows David and Danny to the front door of the house. Helen hangs back. \nHELEN Jenny... \nJenny turns around. \nJENNY Aren't you coming? \nHELEN We don't go in. \nJENNY What are you talking about? \nDANNY Helen will look after you. Go and find a nice cup of tea somewhere. \nJenny is mystified. \nJENNY I don't need looking after, thank you very much. David, I want to see... \nDavid ignores her. \nDANNY I'm not going to tell you a second time. Now. Run along. \n49A   EXT. BENCH. DAY                                            49A \nHelen and Jenny waiting for the boys. Helen is blithe, chatty; Jenny has a face like thunder. \nHELEN They won't be long. Either way. \nJENNY \"Either way\"? \nHELEN Sometimes they find something, sometimes they don't. \nIn the distance, David is waving at them urgently. \nHELEN And when they do find something, we usually have to leave quite quickly. They can be a bit naughty, sometimes. Anyway. It's nice to have company. I'm usually outside on my own. \nJenny stares at Helen. She's beginning to realise who she is dealing with. \n50   SCENE OMITTED                                                 50 \n51   SCENE OMITTED                                                 51 \n52   INT/EXT. CAR NEW COUNTRY ROAD. DAY                            52 \nAn old picture of   some kind is wedged between Helen and Jenny on the back   seat. Jenny, furious, is staring out of the window. Helen   attempts to peer around the partition, but settles for a   wave. \nHELEN Coo-ee. Jenny. \nJenny doesn't respond. \nDANNY Sorry about being a little brisk back there, Jenny. We have our way of doing things. Silly, really. \nStill no response. \nDAVID Oh, come on, Jenny. Let's not spoil things. \nMARJORIE Did you have a nice time? \nJENNY Lovely, thank you. \nJACK Was he nice to you? \nJenny unzips her bag and pulls out her copy of the book. She hands it to her father. \nJENNY Look inside. \nJack examines the inscription. \nJACK Well I never. Look at this, Marjorie. \nHe hands it to her. She examines it reverently. \nMARJORIE \"Clive\"...Lucky girl. What was he like? \nJENNY He was just...normal. Kind. \nMARJORIE And did he show you round? \nJENNY Oh, he was busy. David did, though. \nMARJORIE What did you think? \nJENNY Beautiful. \nMARJORIE Did it make you want to work harder? \nJACK Never a dull moment with David, is there? If it's not concerts, it's famous authors. Bit different from that lad you brought home for tea, isn't he? \nMARJORIE David's a lot older than Graham. \nJACK Graham could live to be two hundred, and he still wouldn't be swanning around with famous authors. Hasn't got it in him. \nJENNY He might become a famous author, for all you know. \nJACK Being one isn't the same as knowing one, is it? Anyone can be one. But if you move in those circles... \nJENNY What? \nJACK Well, it says something about you, doesn't it? It says you're going places. It says you're well connected. He's an impressive young man, that David. I like him more and more. \nMARJORIE Well, they say opposites attract, don't they? I wouldn't have thought he was your sort. \nJACK He wasn't. And now he is. \nMARJORIE Is that how you feel, Jenny? \nJENNY I feel....I Feel I should do my homework. \nShe leaves the room. Marjorie watches her go thoughtfully. \n56   EXT. PARK. DAY                                              56 \nA group of girls cross-country running. Jenny and her friends are at the back of the group, and the gym teacher , jogging backwards, gesticulates at them to get a move on. \nGYM TEACHER Ladies, please. Christmas is coming. \nThey put on enough of a spurt to satisfy her, and then immediately stop when the teacher is no longer watching. Seeing an attractive bench, they sit down. From somewhere under a skirt, Jenny produces a packet of exotic-looking cigarettes and offers them around. \nHATTIE What the hell are those? \nJENNY Russian Sobranies. \nHattie and Tina make snooty faces. Jenny takes a cigarette. The others follow suit. Jenny lights them, and they all grimace. The contrast between the sophisticated cigarettes, and the unsophisticated smokers and context is pronounced. \nHATTIE Where did they come from? \nTINA She might have bought them from the Savoy, or Claridges, or the opera, or some fancy nightclub. Who knows, with Jenny? \nJENNY Paris. You can't buy them here. \nTINA (suddenly looking at her suspiciously) You never bought them yourself? \nJENNY (mimicking Tina's grammar cruelly) No. I never. \nTINA Shut up, you stuck-up cow. \nJENNY But I'll bring you some back, if you want. \nJACK No, of course... \nJENNY I have an education to pursue. \n58   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                               58 \nGraham, Jenny and her father are at the dinner table, sitting in the dark. Marjorie kicks the door open with her foot and comes in holding a birthday cake with seventeen candles burning on it. She puts it down carefully on the table. \nJACK Blow them out, then, before the whole place burns down. \nJenny closes her eyes, makes her wish, blows out her candles. Her father and mother both look at her, apparently attempting to read her mind. Jack gets up to turn the lights on. We can see that by Jenny's side are two unopened, carefully-wrapped presents, both exactly the same size - clearly books. \nMARJORIE Who'd like a piece? \nIn truth, the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising specimen. There isn't enough icing on the top. She cuts a couple of slices which immediately collapse. \nGRAHAM Never mind. I'll have one of those. \nJACK Come on. Presents. \nWithout any real enthusiasm, Jenny opens the first one of the two, from her mum and dad. It's a Latin dictionary. \nJENNY Oh. Thank you. I    needed a new one. \nGRAHAM (crestfallen) Oh dear. \nThe doorbell rings. Jenny perks up. Jack goes to answer it, and immediately the house is energised: it's David. \n58A   INT/EXT JENNY'S HOUSE                                       58A \nJack answers the door to David. \n58B   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE                                          58B \nJACK (O.S.) Good grief. You won't believe this, Jenny. Did you leave anything in the shop? \nDavid enters. You can hardly see him for all the parcels and flowers he's carrying. \nDAVID It's a special day. \nHe and Jenny exchange a glance. Jack comes in behind him. \nJACK She's a special girl. \nDAVID Oh, I know it. (to Graham) Hello, young man. \nJENNY This is Graham. \nDAVID Graham, a pleasure. I'm David. \nThey shake hands. Graham suddenly looks five years younger. \nJACK Makes your dictionary look a bit feeble, eh Graham? \nGraham looks pained. Marjorie notices. \nMARJORIE And ours too, come to that. \nJACK Well, we're not the ones trying to impress her. \nJENNY Clearly. \nJACK David, what can I get you to drink? \nDAVID What's everybody else having? What have you got there, Graham? \nJACK I've given him a glass of pop. \nGRAHAM (stung) I'd better be going I have a stack of homework to do. \nGraham says his goodbyes. He tries to catch Jenny's eye, but she looks away. Marjorie shows him to the door. \nDAVID Yes. Well. You can put the pop away now. What is there for the grown-ups? \nJACK A glass of something warming? \nDAVID You know me so well. \nHearty laughter from the two men. \nJENNY Can I open anything yet? \n60   INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY.                           60 \nThe office is dark, wood-panelled, foreboding, apparently designed to put all visitors ill-at-ease. The headmistress would probably choose to be wood-panelled if she could. She's tweedy, bespectacled, severe. There is a knock at the door. She doesn't look up from her paperwork. \nHEADMISTRESS Come. \nJenny enters, looking young and frightened. \nHEADMISTRESS Ah. Miss Mellor. \nJenny tries to look back at her with all the courage she can muster. \nHEADMISTRESS We're all very excited about your forthcoming trip to Paris. Our excitement, indeed, knows no bounds. Some of us can talk of little else. \nJenny looks at her feet. \nHEADMISTRESS An older man, I understand. A word of warning, Miss Mellor. \nThere may well have been the odd sixth-form girl who has lost an important part of herself - perhaps the best part - while under our supervision. These things happen, regrettably. If, however, we are made aware of this loss, then of course the young lady in question would have to continue her studies elsewhere, if she still has any use for `A'-levels. Is that clear? \nJENNY Can I go now? \nHEADMISTRESS Please. \nJenny turns round and walks out without saying another word. \n62   INT. HOTEL BEDROOM. EVENING                                   62 \n62PT 1 \nThrough the window of a hotel suite, we see a BEA jet soaring into the sky. \n62PT 2 \nDavid and Jenny aren't on it, though. They are letting themselves into the room. Jenny stares at the featureless sitting room. \nJENNY There's no bed. \nDAVID Ah. I pushed the boat out and got us a suite. \nJENNY A suite! \nDAVID Well, if work stops us getting to Paris until tomorrow, then work can buy us a nice hotel room. Anyway, it's a special occasion, isn't it? \nJENNY I would have thought that tonight of all nights we only need a bedroom. \nClose on David's reaction      -   she hasn't forgotten that tonight's the night. \n63   INT. HOTEL BEDROOM. NIGHT                                       63 \nDavid and Jenny in bed, in a dimly lit bedroom. They are kissing - David more passionately than Jenny. He is making little whimpers of excitement, and Jenny is clearly trying hard to hide her nerves. We're acutely aware of her age, and of her virginity. Suddenly David breaks off. \nDAVID Hold on a second. I've got something. \nRather absurdly, he half-disappears over the side of the bed, reaching for something on the floor. He comes back with a banana. Jenny stares at him. \nJENNY What on earth is that for? \nDAVID I thought....I thought we might want to practice. \nJenny shrieks with horror. \nJENNY With a banana? \nDAVID I thought we'd get the messy bit over with first. \nJENNY David, I don't want to lose my virginity to a piece of fruit. \nDAVID I'm sorry. \nDavid attempts to kiss her again. Jenny wriggles clear. \nJENNY Let's wait until we get to Paris. I think the moment might have gone. \nDAVID I'm sorry, Minnie. I'm such a fool. \nJenny doesn't deny it. \nJENNY And David..... if tomorrow night does happen, it will never happen again, so... \nDAVID (alarmed) Why won't it ever happen again? \nJenny laughs. \n72   INT.   CLASSROOM. DAY                                      72 \nJenny's English class file past Miss Stubbs at the end of a lesson. Miss Stubbs stops Jenny. \nMISS STUBBS Jenny, could I have a word? \nJENNY Of course.(To Hattie and Tina) I'll catch you up. \nMiss Stubbs waits until the room empties. \nMISS STUBBS You can do anything you want, Jenny. You know that. You're clever and you're pretty... But sometimes those things fight. I'm worried that at the moment clever Jenny and pretty Jenny are fighting. \nJENNY What do you mean? \nMISS STUBBS I couldn't bear it if clever Jenny lost. It's because of people like you that I plough through illiterate essays by Sandra Lovell about her pony. And there aren't many of you, I can tell you. One every few years. Is your boyfriend interested in clever Jenny? \nJENNY I think so. \nMISS STUBBS Interested enough to let her do what she wants? \nJENNY He couldn't stop me. \nMISS STUBBS He might not have to stop you. That's what I'm trying to tell you. \nJENNY (frustrated) I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me. \nMISS STUBBS I'm telling you to go to Oxford. No matter what. Or you'll break my heart. \nJenny looks at her. \nJENNY (quietly) Where did you go? \nMISS STUBBS Sorry? \nJENNY (louder, bolder) Where did you go? Which university? \nMISS STUBBS Girton. Cambridge. \nJENNY Oh. \nMISS STUBBS What does that mean? `Oh'? \nJENNY You're clever. And you're pretty. So presumably, Clever Miss Stubbs won. And here you are, reading all those pony essays. I don't know. These last few months, I've been to Paris, and to jazz clubs, and I've eaten in wonderful restaurants, and seen wonderful films, heard beautiful music... \nMISS STUBBS I'm sure you have. But I was filled up with beautiful things, books and music and conversation, in exactly the same way at Cambridge. And I didn't have to pay the same sort of price. Are you taking precautions, Jenny? \nJenny stares at her angrily. \nJENNY It's nothing to do with that. \nMISS STUBBS Isn't it? \nJENNY Maybe our lives are always going to end up with pony essays. Or housework. And yes, maybe we'll go up to Oxford. But if we're all going to die the moment we graduate, maybe it's what we do before that counts. \nMISS STUBBS I'm sorry you think I'm dead. \nJENNY I don't think you're dead. But... \nMISS STUBBS (coldly) You'd better get to your next class. \nShe turns her back on Jenny. \n73   EXT. CAR. NIGHT                                             73 \nHelen, Danny, Jenny get out of David's Bristol, which is parked outside a nightclub called Esmerelda's Barn. David has parked next to a white Rolls-Royce. \nJENNY (looking at the Rolls- Royce) And we know the person who owns this? \nDAVID Yes. Perec Rachman. He's a.... \nDANNY A bastard. \nDanny and David laugh. \nDAVID He's a business acquaintance, and we need to talk to him. \nJENNY I gathered that much. But why do we have to crawl around the West End looking for his car? Why don't you just make an appointment, if you want to see him? \nThe men snigger. \nDAVID Jenny, we should go. It's late. \nJENNY (disappointed) Oh. Yes. \nDANNY Alas. One day, school will be over forever, and we can talk about art all night. \nDAVID (to Danny) You're all right in a taxi, aren't you? \nHe guides Jenny firmly out of the club. \n77   EXT. CLUB. NIGHT.                                           77 \nJenny is about to to open the passenger door of the Bristol, but David stops her. \nDAVID Wait there. \nHe runs to the back of the car, opens the boot and starts rummaging through it. It seems to be full of everything but the thing he's looking for. \nJENNY What are you doing? \nHe slams the boot shut and comes back empty-handed. \nDAVID Will you marry me? \nJenny stares at him for a moment, then laughs. \nJENNY What were you looking for? \nDAVID I thought I had a ring. It wouldn't have been the right one. But it would have done for tonight. \nJENNY (eyes twinkling with amusement) Oh, David. \nDAVID I'm serious. \nJENNY You're very sweet. \nDAVID What do you think? \nJENNY (helplessly) Please take me home. \nShe gets into the car. We see the desperation in David's face, lit by the headlights of a passing taxi, as he slams the door on Jenny after she's got in. \n78   EXT. SCHOOL YARD. DAY                                        78 \nJenny, Tina and Hattie all smoking in the school toilets. Jenny is distracted, and standing apart from the others. Tina looks at her. \nTINA How do you say `A penny for your thoughts?' in French? \nHATTIE A franc is too much, isn't it? \nTINA For her thoughts, yes. You'd be overpaying by about ninety-nine centimes. \nSuddenly the door bursts open and the Latin teacher comes in. \n79   INT. HEAD'S OFFICE. DAY                                      79 \nThe three girls are lined up in front of the headmistress, hands by their sides. \nHEADMISTRESS I'm surprised that you two are standing in front of me. I'm not surprised to find you here, Miss Mellor, though I do feel rather like the judge who sent Al Capone to prison for tax evasion. We take a very dim view of smoking. We take an even dimmer view of some of your other behaviour, which as far as we know has taken place off school premises. Your appearance here today, however, allows me to remind you that we are trying to teach you how to become young ladies, not nightclub hostesses. In reality, of course, you are neither. You are merely silly little girls. Detention after school. Go away. \nJenny's face sets hard. Something in her shuts down. \n80    EXT. JENNY'S BALCONY. EVENING                                80 \nJenny is smoking on the balcony. \n80A   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM.                                        80A \nJenny is at her desk in her bedroom, trying to work, but she can't concentrate. Her hair is tied back in a pony- tail. She gets up, pulls back the curtains, looks out of the window. We see what she sees: a sleepy suburban street at night. She looks back at her desk. It looks even more boring than the street. She looks at her scrubbed seventeen- year-old face in the mirror - so much younger than the Jenny we have seen with David. She makes herself up, and she gets older and more glamorous before our eyes. In her make-up and her school uniform, she's half-woman, half- child. We hear the noises drifting up from the kitchen: the radio, the washing-up, occasional muffled conversation. Jenny walks out of the bedroom and slips downstairs. \n81    INT. KITCHEN. EVENING                                        81 \nJenny's mother and father are doing the washing up and listening to the radio. They have their backs to the door. Jenny enters the room quietly and watches them for a moment \nMAN ON THE RADIO They do need some looking after, but nothing that will require too much work. Just leave them in your potting shed for a couple of weeks, and they'll look after themselves. \nJACK Oh, aye. The potting shed. Who does he think I am? Prince Rainier of Monaco? \nJENNY What if I got married instead of going to college? \nJack and Marjorie turn around and stare at this strange apparition wearing too much make-up and a school uniform. \nTina doesn't need to say anything - she just looks at Jenny, makes a pair of spectacles with her fingers and squints. Jenny's giggling fit increases in intensity. \nANN Either his notion weakens, or his discernings are lethargied. Ha! Waking? Tis not so. Who is it that can tell me who I am? \nJenny's arm shoots up, as if to answer the question. \nJENNY Ooh. Miss. Me. I can. \nMiss Stubbs looks at Jenny more in sorrow than in anger - Jenny's behaviour now is something new in their relationship. Jenny stares back at her defiantly. Suddenly Miss Stubbs notices something glinting on her hand: an engagement ring. \nMISS STUBBS Oh, Jenny. \nShe is, as she promised she would be, heartbroken. \nJENNY What? \nMISS STUBBS Take it off. \nHattie, who is sitting behind Jenny, notices the ring, too, for the first time. \nHATTIE Oh my God. Is that really what I think it is? I'M GOING TO BE A BRIDESMAID! \nThere is an excited susurration in the classroom. \nMISS STUBBS You know there's a school rule about jewelry. \nJENNY Half the girls in this room are wearing jewelry. \nMISS STUBBS Yes. But none of it is going to ruin their lives. \nJENNY (coolly) We have a difference of opinion on that. \nMiss Stubbs stares at her. Jenny can only just steel herself to stare back. \nMISS STUBBS Let's see who's right. Come with me. \nJenny doesn't move. \nMISS STUBBS Please don't make me drag you out like a child. \nJenny gets to her feet. Teacher and pupil leave the room, while the rest of the class watches. \n83   INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY                      83 \nHEADMISTRESS How far advanced are these ridiculous plans? Have you set a date? Have you decided on a church? \nJENNY We won't be getting married in a church. David's Jewish. \nThe headmistress stares at her, dumbfounded. \nHEADMISTRESS Jewish? He's a Jew? You're aware, I take it, that the Jews killed our Lord? \nJENNY (beginning to feel less intimidated by her surroundings) And you're aware, I suppose, that our Lord was Jewish? \nThe headmistress snorts scornfully \nHEADMISTRESS I suppose he told you that. We're all very sorry about what happened in the War. But there's no excuse for that sort of malicious and untruthful propaganda. \nJenny smiles to herself. \nHEADMISTRESS Anyway, I can now see that you are even more in need of responsible advice than I realised. Is it true that you don't intend to sit for your exams? And therefore you won't be applying for University? \nJENNY Yes, that's right. \nHEADMISTRESS What do you think you're doing? \nJENNY Nobody has been able to explain to me the point of University. \nTherefore I don't see the point of the exams, either. \nHEADMISTRESS Nobody does anything worth doing without a degree. \nJENNY And nobody does anything worth doing with one, either. No woman, anyway. \nHEADMISTRESS So what I do isn't worth doing. Or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs Wilson, or any of us here. \nJenny doesn't say anything. The headmistress takes her silence as an admission of defeat. \nHEADMISTRESS Because none of us would be here without our degrees, you realise that, don't you? And yes, of course studying is hard, and boring, and... \nJenny can't contain herself any longer. \nHelen is bemused by their mirth. Danny watches   David thoughtfully. \n87   EXT. DANNY'S. NIGHT                                            87 \nDavid and Jenny come out of Danny's flat and approach David's car. \nJENNY Danny didn't seem very pleased about our engagement. \nDAVID I thought that, too! I was wondering whether he might be a bit jealous. \nJENNY (trying not to be pleased) Jealous? \nDAVID You may have noticed that Helen's not really Oxford material. I'm going to keep him out of your way. \nThey both smile. David opens the door for Jenny and she gets into the car. \n87A   INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN. DAY                                   87A \nJenny is making David a cup of tea. Her mother is keeping an eye on Jenny - in Marjorie's mind at least, this is a rehearsal for something. \nDAVID I haven't put my...my stamp on it yet. Haven't had time. It needs a woman's touch, really. And if you don't like it, we can move. Just say the word. \nJENNY Where is the flat again? \nMARJORIE You have to put the cosy on straight away. \nJenny sighs and rolls her eyes. She picks up the hand- knitted tea-cosy and puts it on her head. \nJENNY Like that? \nDavid laughs. \nMARJORIE (oblivious) No. On the tea-pot. \nJENNY (deadpan) Ah. \nShe puts the tea-cosy on the tea-pot. \nDAVID Just down from Russell Square. Two minutes' walk from the underground. \nMARJORIE Jenny! We could walk to...(She tries to think of somewhere Jenny might find interesting.) We could walk to the British Museum! \nJenny gives her a look. \nMARJORIE I'll leave you to it. Don't let it stew. \nShe leaves the room. \nJENNY And this is where you're living? \nDAVID I've stayed there for the last couple of nights. (Beat) On and off. \nJENNY You've stayed there two nights \"on and off\"? \nDAVID Is that tea ready? One sugar, please. \nJENNY (frustrated by his evasions) David! \nDAVID I'm sorry. You must think I'm very odd. \nJENNY No, but.... You seem to float around. I never know where you are. \nShe hands him his tea. \nDAVID A wandering Jew.(He pauses to take a sip.) If I tell you something, will you promise not to laugh? \nJENNY It depends on how funny it is. \nDAVID (mumbling) I live at home. \nJENNY We all live at home. \nDAVID No. I mean...I live at home...in the same way that you live at home. \nJENNY But I live with my mother and fa...(It clicks.) You don't mean it. \nDavid nods, shamefacedly. \nJENNY Your mother and father? \nDAVID Just my mother. My father's dead. I've been meaning to tell you, Minnie, and it would have been much better than all those silly lies. But... \n93   INT. CAR. NIGHT                                              93 \nDavid starts the car, and glances in the rear-view mirror. \nDAVID Everyone happy? \nJACK I feel like Eamonn Andrews. \nDAVID Is that a good thing? \nMARJORIE Of course. Eamonn Andrews is the poshest person that Jack can imagine being. \n94   EXT. STREET/PETROL STATION. NIGHT                            94 \nThe Bristol cruises down a London arterial road. \n95   INT. CAR. NIGHT                                              95 \nWe see, from David's POV, a petrol station approaching. \nDAVID Sorry about this. \nHe slows the car and turns in to the garage. \n96   EXT. GARAGE. NIGHT                                          96 \nDavid gets out of the car as the attendant comes over. \nATTENDANT How can I help you, sir? \nDAVID You might as well fill her up. \nDavid looks around and spots a phone box just outside the garage. He leans in through the open car window. \nDAVID I'm just going to make a quick call. I'll be two ticks. \n97   INT. CAR. NIGHT                                             97 \nJenny watches him walk towards the phone box. \nJACK Do you think we should offer him some petrol money? Or would he feel insulted? \nJenny watches David as he dials the number. He notices her, waves, puts the money in the slot. \nJACK He'd feel insulted, probably. He said tonight was his treat. That must include the petrol, for God's sakes? \nDavid starts to talk, and turns away, as if he's frightened that someone in the car can lip-read. \nJACK What do you think? \nNobody pays him any attention. They lapse into silence. Jack starts to fiddle with the features in the car - a table springs down from the seat in front of him, much to his alarm. \nJACK God almighty. What have I done? \nJenny opens the glove compartment, looking for the cigarettes that David always keeps there. She finds the cigarettes, and closes the glove compartment. But she has seen something in there, so she opens it again. She takes out some letters and papers and starts to look through them. \n98   EXT. GARAGE. NIGHT                                           98 \nDavid has finished his phone call and is walking towards the car. He sees Jenny looking through letters and papers, sees the open glove compartment, starts to run across the forecourt. \nDAVID (desperately) Jenny! \nIt's too late. We see Jenny's stricken face, gleaming in someone else's headlights. \n99   INT. CAR. NIGHT                                              99 \nDavid gets into the car. \nDAVID Jenny, I... \nJENNY (as cold as ice) Take us home. \nJACK What's going on? \nDAVID There's been a...Jenny's had a bit of a shock. \nJenny laughs, mirthlessly, then starts to weep. \nJACK What's happened? \nJENNY It's another one of David's little muddles and misunderstandings. \nHe opens the boot. It's full of cases of whiskey. Jenny doesn't even bother asking what they are doing there. David takes one of the bottles, opens it, takes a long slug. \nJENNY Two minutes. And then I'll come out and drag you in. \nJenny marches into the house and slams the door. The camera stays on David. He gets back into the car and takes another slug of whiskey. Then his shoulders begin to shake, and he cries and cries. \n101   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT                                   101 \nJenny comes in, leaving the door open for David. Her parents are standing in the sitting room, looking at her anxiously. Their coats are still on, and they haven't put the lights on yet. \nJACK What's going on? \nJENNY He's helping himself to some Dutch courage before facing you. Stolen Dutch courage, from the look of it. He has something to tell you. \nShe stands, pale and young-looking again, opposite her parents. Suddenly they are all three lit up by headlights. Shot from their POV of the Bristol roaring off up the street. \nJACK He just drove off. \nWe close slowly in on Jenny's face. But of course he'd drive off! \nJACK (pathetic) Can you tell us? Please? Jenny? \nJenny can't deal with her own pain, let alone his. He already looks like a broken, foolish old man. They should hug. But they don't. \n102   EXT. STREET/DAVID'S HOUSE. DAY                              102 \nA suburban street, full of semi-detached houses, not far from Jenny's house. Jenny walks down the road tentatively - she's looking at the numbers on the houses. She looks young again - tired, no make-up, no elegant clothes. She can't bring herself to wear anything that David bought her. \nShe hesitates at the top of the driveway to the house, steels herself to walk down. But just at that moment the door opens; there's a homely-looking woman, early 30s. She is holding the hand of a three-year-old. Jenny is stunned. But there's more to come. \nThe woman deposits the child in the drive, goes back into the house, comes out behind an enormous 1950s pram. David has found time to father another baby. \nWIFE Oh. Hello. \nJENNY (almost inaudible) Hello. I'm sorry. I think I must have the wrong house. \nThe woman stares at her. \nJENNY Yes. I wanted number...It's my cello lesson. Silly. I... \nShe dries up and looks at the woman helplessly. \nWIFE Oh, no. Don't tell me. Good God. You're a child. \nJenny blushes. Beat. She turns and tries to walk back up the driveway, but the woman won't let her go. \nWIFE No. No. You stay here. If you're old enough to sleep with him, you're old enough to look at me. \nJENNY I can't. \nBut she doesn't move, either. \nWIFE You didn't know about any of this. Presumably. \nJenny shakes her head. \nWIFE No. They never do. Did he ask you to marry him? \nJenny nods. \nWIFE Yes. Of course he did. You're not in the family way, are you? Because that's happened before. \nJenny shakes her head. \nWIFE Thank God for that. At least you can escape intact. (Beat) Relatively speaking. Not all of them have done. \nShe nods at the children. \nWIFE That's why he never goes through with anything. He does love them. \nJENNY (looking into the pram) She's beautiful. \nWIFE Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's four months old. \nJenny does the maths. It's all she can do to stop herself from reeling backwards - she's visibly shaken. \nJENNY Four months! \nWIFE Yes. Babies often are that sort of age. Perhaps you can remember a night four months ago when he seemed a little distracted. Anyway. If you'll excuse us. \nShe pushes past Jenny and leaves her standing bereft on the path. \nDANNY Helen! Not now. \nHelen shrugs. \nDANNY I tried to tell him. I'm not speaking to him now, if that's any consolation. \nJENNY (bitterly) It's a funny world you people live in. You both watched me... carrying on with a married man, but you don't think it's worth saying anything. \nDANNY Ah, well if you want that sort of conversation...You watched David and I help ourselves to a map, and you didn't say much, either. \nHe holds Jenny's gaze. She looks away. \n110   INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY                            110 \nJenny has put on her school uniform for this meeting; it completes a circle. She's back where she started from, or would like to be, anyway. If she seems older than she did when we first met her, it's because things have happened to her, and they've left a mark on her face. She's worried and tired. The headmistress, meanwhile, is delighted by her return - but only because of the opportunities for smugness and schadenfreude it provides. \nHEADMISTRESS So. Your Jewish friend turned out to be married already, I understand. How unfortunate. \nJenny doesn't say anything. She has clearly decided to swallow anything she has to. \nHEADMISTRESS Anyway. How do you think we can help? \nJENNY I'd like to repeat my last year at school. Start all over again. \nHEADMISTRESS I got the impression the last time we spoke that you didn't see the point of school. Or of me, or of any of us here. \nJENNY I know. I was stupid. \nHEADMISTRESS So what is the point? \nJENNY I know that I need to go to university. \nHEADMISTRESS And what happens if some other chap wants to marry you during your studies next year? \nJENNY (laughing bitterly) Some other chap? There won't be any other chaps. Not for a long, long time, anyway. \nHEADMISTRESS I'm afraid I think you're the sort of young lady who attracts chaps whether she wants to or not. No,I think the offer of a place at this school would be wasted on you. You showed how little you valued us only weeks ago. And I must confess that it gives me a sort of grim satisfaction to return the sentiment now. \nJENNY (bitterly) Is it really so grim, your satisfaction? \nHEADMISTRESS It gives me no pleasure to see our schoolgirls throw their lives away. Although, of course, you're not one of our schoolgirls any more. Through your own volition. \nJENNY I suppose you think I'm a ruined woman. \nHEADMISTRESS Oh, you're not a woman. \nBeat. Jenny stands up and leaves without saying a word. The headmistress is pleased with her final line. \n111   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT                                        111 \nJenny working hard in her room. It's been completely stripped bare of everything except schoolbooks. She has become ageless, genderless - her life is now monastic. \n112   EXT. PARK. DAY                                             112 \nJenny walking alone through her old park. \n113   INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY                                       113 \nJenny on her own, smoking nervously. Hattie and Tina come in. They obviously haven't seen her since it all happened. They both hug her sympathetically and sit down. Nobody knows what to say. \nTINA I'm sure my uncle knows someone who could kill him. If that would help. \nJenny smiles wanly, and briefly. \nHATTIE We should have stopped you. \nJENNY Did you want to? \nTINA Of course we didn't. Why would we stop you? Restaurants, hotels, foreign cities, no exams... \nJENNY (Bitterly) Yes. Who'd have thought there'd be a down side to all that? I could tell you all about the imagery in Jane Eyre. But I couldn't see that a man who stole maps from old ladies might be a liar. \nThey look at her. This is new information. \nHATTIE Well, if you'd told us that we might have tried to stop you. \nJENNY There are a lot of things I didn't tell you. I was dreaming. \nTINA That's the thing about our lives, isn't it? It's so easy to fall asleep, when there's nothing to keep you awake. \nBeat. \n", "test1_input": "David stops the car. \nDAVID Jump in. \n8   INT. CAR. DAY                                               8 \nJenny shuts the door and sinks approvingly into the white leather seat. David regards the dripping girl with amusement. \nJENNY It's even nicer on the inside. \nDAVID Where to, madam? \nJenny makes a face. \nJENNY I only live round the corner. \nDAVID What a shame. We'll just make it last as long as we can. \n9    EXT. STREET. NEAR JENNY'S. DAY                               9 \nThe Bristol is crawling along the road at walking pace. \n10   INT/EXT. CAR JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                              10 \nDavid reaches across Jenny while driving slowly, opens the glove compartment and takes out a packet of cigarettes. \nDAVID Smoke? \nJENNY I'd better not. I'm a bit close to home. \nDavid lights one for himself. \nDAVID I suppose cellists must go to a lot of concerts. \nJENNY We don't go to any concerts. We don't believe in them. \nDAVID Oh, they're real. \nJENNY So people say. \nDAVID Why don't we believe in them? \nJENNY I suppose...What would he say? \nDAVID Your father, this is? \nJENNY (Darkly) Oh, yes. He'd say there's no point to them. They're just for fun. Apart from school concerts, of course, which are no fun at all, so we go to those. The proper ones don't help you get on. \nDAVID Which of course is what is so wonderful about them. Anyway, you'll go one day. \nJENNY (heartfelt) Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it seems as though that's what all this slog is for. If I get to University, I'm going to read what I want and think about what I want and listen to what I want. And I'm going to look at paintings and go to French films and talk to people who know lots about lots. \nDAVID Good for you. Which University? \nJENNY Oxford. If I'm lucky. Did you go anywhere? \nDAVID I studied at what I believe they call the University of Life. And I didn't get a very good degree there. \nJenny smiles. \nJENNY This is me. Thank you. \nShe gets out of the car with the cello. David stares after her for a moment, then drives off. \n11   INT. JENNY'S SITTING-ROOM. AFTERNOON                       11 \nJenny, her parents and Graham are eating afternoon tea - neat fish-paste sandwiches, Battenberg cake, best china. \nMARJORIE How's your mother, Graham? \nGRAHAM She's fine, thanks. She sends her best, by the way. \nJACK Where are you applying, Graham? \nJenny looks embarrassed. She knows what's coming. \nGRAHAM I'm not sure yet. \nJACK Well, when will you be sure? You can't let the grass grow under your feet, you know. Otherwise you'll be at the back of the queue. \nJENNY (deadpan) I suppose so. I suppose the growing grass would knock you off balance, and then you'd fall over, and by the time you picked yourself up, there'd be a queue. \n", "test1_true": "GRAHAM I might take a year off. \nJenny winces. Jack looks at him as if he's just said he'll take all his clothes off. \nJACK What for? \nGRAHAM (mumbling) I don't know. Maybe do some travelling, that sort of thing. \nJACK Travelling? What are you, a teddy boy? \nClose-up of Jenny - she knows what's coming, and can't bear it. Beat. \nJACK (nodding at Jenny) You know she's going to Oxford, don't you? Oxford. English. If we can get her Latin up to scratch. \nJenny sighs. \nJACK So she's studying English at Oxford while you're a wandering Jew... \nJenny looks at him curiously. Graham steels himself to speak. \nGRAHAM Mr Mellor...I'm not a teddy boy. I'm an homme serieux. Jeune. An homme jeune serieux homme. \nJenny winces again. Her father stares at Graham. Graham blushes. \n12    INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                 12 \nIt's the night of the youth orchestra concert. Jenny, her mother and father are on their way out of the door. Jack is carrying the cello. Jenny is in her school uniform, with her hair scrubbed back in a severe ponytail. The three of them are flustered. Jenny opens the front door for her father and he stumbles outside. \nJENNY Oh! \n12A   INT/EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                             12A \nShe has seen something on the doorstep, and she stoops to pick it up - a large bunch of flowers. \nJENNY They're for me! \nMARJORIE (curious) Who are they from? \nJenny opens the card that's attached to them. \nJENNY Gosh. Him. \nMARJORIE Who's `him'? \nJENNY Just...A chap I met. \nMARJORIE A chap who sends flowers? So he's a man-chap? \nJENNY Yes, he is, really. \nJack stares at the flowers in disbelief. The bunch of flowers has created in Jack the kind of panic and fear more typically associated with a biochemical attack. \nJACK What's going on here? \nMARJORIE (drily, knowing the trouble this will cause) Jack,I'm afraid Jenny has been sent some flowers by a chap. \nJACK A chap? What kind of chap? Who? Why? \nJENNY (patiently) He's wishing me luck for tonight. \nJACK Are you sure that's all he's wishing? And where does he get the money from? \nJENNY He earns it, I expect. \nJACK What do you mean, he earns it? Why isn't he at school? What does he do? \nJENNY Can we just go? Otherwise the bunch of good-luck flowers will actually be responsible for me actually missing the concert. Which would be ironic, n'est ce pas? \nJACK Well I don't like it. \nMARJORIE Objection noted. Jenny? \nJENNY Noted. \nJACK Ten bob's worth of luck, I reckon. That's a lot for a schoolgirl. You can't leave them out here, anyway. I'd burgle a house that had flowers outside. They'll think we're made of money. \n12B   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                12B \nJenny sighs, puts them inside the house, shuts the door. \n", "test2_input": "DANNY That would be even more vulgar. \nDAVID Play for us, Jenny. \nJENNY Gosh, no. One day. When I'm good enough for it. \nDAVID She's good enough now. \nJENNY Oh, David. You've never heard me. \nDanny stands up and stretches. \nDAVID I shall come to hear you in St John's Smith Square. Or in Oxford, when you get there. \nDANNY We should all go and spend a weekend in Oxford. Straw boaters, punting, cream teas, antiquarian bookshops. Bit of business, if we can find it. What about next weekend? \nDAVID/HELEN Yes! \nJENNY A weekend away? I wouldn't be allowed to do that. \nThey all look at her. \nDAVID I'll find a way. I'll talk to them. \nJENNY Who? \nDAVID Jack and Marjorie. \nJENNY About what? \nDAVID Oxford. \nJenny   hoots with derision. \nJENNY You're going to ask my father if I can go away with you for the weekend? He'd have you arrested. \nDAVID We'll see. \nJENNY I'll bet you you can't do it. \nDAVID How much? \nDANNY (amused) Be careful, Jenny. You don't know who you're dealing with. \nJENNY Half-a-crown. \nDAVID You're on. \nThey shake hands. Jenny suddenly notice the clock on Danny's mantelpiece. \nJENNY Mon dieu! You must take me back to school. And I've got to change back into my uniform. \nThere is a silence. Danny and David make momentary eye contact - they are clearly contemplating the erotic possibilities of Jenny's last sentence. Helen notices. \nHELEN Oh, behave yourselves. \nJenny looks at them all, mystified. \n30   INT. CLASSROOM/LATIN. DAY.                                  30 \nJenny is in her Latin class, waiting for the lesson to begin. Tina and Hattie aren't with her, and she sits on her own -the atmosphere of the class is very different from Miss Stubbs' English lessons. The girls are different, more serious, less fun, and the atmosphere is more sombre. The teacher, MRS WILSON, is older, plainer, stricter. She pulls some papers out of her bag. \nMRS WILSON Test results for the Virgil translation. We will start from the bottom...Patricia. \nJenny puffs out her cheeks. She's not last. \nMRS WILSON (CONT'D) Absent. Margaret. 48%. Jenny... \nJenny winces. \nMRS WILSON (CONT'D) 52%. That would just about scrape a pass in the exam proper. Not good enough for Oxford candidates. \n31   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                                     31 \nJenny and her mother are sitting on the sofa, staring into space, clearly upset. On the coffee table in front of them is the test, covered in red ink. They hear a key in the lock, and they look at each other. \nMARJORIE I'll talk to him. \nJack enters, back from work. He's wearing a suit and carrying a battered briefcase. He looks at them, and then notices the essay on the table. \nJACK It's her Latin, isn't it? \n", "test2_true": "He picks up the paper. \nJACK And you still say I shouldn't go down there and have it out with whatsername? The Latin teacher? Because this is hopeless. \nJENNY How are you going to \"have it out\" with her? What are you going to do? Shout at her until she decides I'm much cleverer than she thinks? \nMARJORIE Everyone's doing their best, Jack. \nJACK What if their best isn't good enough, though, eh? What do we do then? \nJENNY We don't go to Oxford. Any of us. Not even you, Dad. \nJACK Perhaps it's all a waste of time and money anyway. \nMARJORIE You don't mean that. \nJACK Well, what's she going to do with an English degree? And if she's going to spend three years playing that bloody cello and talking in French to beatniks, then I'm throwing good money after bad. I suppose she might meet a nice lawyer. But she could do that at a dinner dance tomorrow. \nJENNY Oh, yes. That's the whole point of an Oxford education. It's the expensive alternative to a dinner dance. \nMARJORIE What about private tuition? \nJACK Is anyone listening to me? How much is that going to cost me? \nMARJORIE Five shillings an hour. Maybe a little more for A-level. \nJACK Five bob! But... we could spend five bob on this and five bob on that, and before we know it that's our savings down the drain. \nMARJORIE And what else are we spending five bob on? What else are we spending sixpence on? \nJACK Oh, nothing. (He gestures round the room.) It's all free. That vase was free. \nMARJORIE It was, actually. It was a present from Auntie Vi. \nJACK That chair was free. The sofa. We don't have to pay for anything. And even if we did, we don't have to work for it. That's the beauty of life, Jenny. Everything's free. Grows on trees. Wonderful, isn't it? (He warms to his theme, and grows progressively more berserk.) We've got a lovely Oxford tree in the garden, lucky for you, so that's Oxford taken care of. And a whole orchard of school trees, so that's all free. I'm sure there are some private tuition trees out there. I'll go and have a look. \nHe stands up. \nMARJORIE Jack... \nJACK No, no, won't take me a minute. I think I saw some at the back there, right next to the pocket money tree. I'll just nip out and check, see that they're doing all right. \nDon't want anyone climbing over the wall and scrumping, do we? And you never know. Maybe there'll be a man with deep pockets growing out there. Because God knows we need to find you one. \nHe leaves the room, apparently to   look in   the garden   for the mythical trees. \n31A   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE                                           31A \nJenny and her mother move to the window to    watch him talking theatrically to the trees. \n32    EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY.                                 32 \nJenny, Hattie and Tina are walking back from school. \nTINA You could always go to secretarial college with Hattie. \nJENNY (sarcastic) Oh, thanks. \nHATTIE Charming! \nJENNY Oh, no. \nHattie and Tina follow Jenny's eyes, and they see Graham coming towards them pushing his bike, red-faced, trousers tucked into socks. \nGRAHAM Hello. \nJENNY Oh. Graham. Hello. \nGRAHAM I haven't seen you for ages....It all went wrong, didn't it? The tea-party, I mean. Was it because of the year off? \nJENNY No, no. It's just...I've got so much to do if I'm going to get the grades I need. \nTINA Yes. She's got no time for boys. \nHattie and Tina try to suppress giggles. Graham turns an even brighter shade of red. Hattie and Tina enter the coffee bar. Jenny feels sorry for him, is on the verge of inviting him to join them...And changes her mind. \nJENNY (quickly) Bye, Graham. \nShe follows the girls inside. \n", "test3_input": "JENNY Will we be sharing bedrooms? \nHELEN You're not sleeping with him? \nJENNY No. I'm...No. \nHELEN Good for you. \nJENNY Really? Do     you think so? \nHELEN You're only sixteen. And you don't want to get into the family way, do you? \nJENNY Oh, I'd make sure that didn't happen. I'm going to do it when I'm seventeen. On my seventeenth birthday, hopefully. \nHELEN With   David? \nJenny pauses. \nJENNY Well...Golly. I suppose it will be with David, won't it? \nHELEN When's your birthday? \nJENNY April. \nHELEN Oh, he'll be around in April. If that's what you want. Anyway. I'll find you a nightie. \nJenny stares at herself in the mirror again. \n41   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                      41 \nThe girls emerge. Both men are entranced by Jenny's transformation. David can't take his eyes off her. \nDANNY (thoughtful) Shall, we, ah... Make a move? \nHe gets to his feet. \n42   INT/EXT. CAR COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.                               42 \nThe Bristol on the country road to Oxford. \n43   INT/EXT. CAR OXFORD DAY                                       43 \nThe Bristol drives through Oxford. Jenny catches a quick glimpse of a dreaming spire. \nDANNY Imagine spending three years here. \nHELEN I know. \nShe shudders, as if someone has walked over her grave. \nJENNY Can we stop? \nDAVID Maybe later. There are a couple of things we have to do. \n44   INT/EXT. CAR OXFORD BACK STREET. DAY.                         44 \nJenny and Helen in the back seat of the car, which is parked outside a house in the back streets of Oxford. There's no sign of Danny and David. Jenny sighs impatiently. \nHELEN Oh, it's always like this. There are millions of places I've never seen because I've been stuck in here. \nJENNY You never get out? \nHELEN There's never anywhere to go in the places they stop. \nJenny looks out of the window. This is self-evidently true. \n45   INT. PUB. EVENING.                                            45 \nHelen and Danny, Jenny and David are standing in a quiet, old-fashioned pub, warming themselves at an open fire. \nDavid has a pen in his hand, and he's holding a book - `The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe'. \nDAVID So. Now.Is he Clive, do you think? Or CS? \nHELEN I'm confused now. I thought you'd made him up? \nDANNY (attempting, briefly, to be patient) No, we...Never mind. \nDavid walks over to the nearest table and writes in the book. \nDAVID There. \n", "test3_true": "JENNY (reads) \"To dear Jenny. With the pleasure of meeting you. Come and see me again soon. Clive.\" \nHELEN Dirty old man. \nLaughter. He takes a long drink from his pint of bitter. A group of students enter, all carrying musical instruments. They stand at the bar, waiting to be served. Jenny stares at them with longing - she wants to be one of them. Helen, meanwhile, stares at them as if they were aliens. \nHELEN (sotto voce) Why are university girls so strange-looking? \nHelen's right. The girls in the group are all bespectacled and frumpy. The others laugh. \nHELEN It's true. And they can't all have started off that way, can they? Most girls aren't ugly, but most girl students are. So there must be something about those places that, you know, makes you fat, or spotty, or short-sighted. \nDAVID Well, if you look at it that way...I mean, that's proper scientific analysis. And you can't argue with science. \nHelen looks pleased. \nHELEN I'm still not quite clear on what you want to do when you get here. \nJENNY I want to read English. \nHELEN Books? \nJENNY Sorry? \nHELEN You want to read English books? \nJENNY Oh. Yes. Reading English is just another way of saying... \nDANNY I wouldn't worry, Jenny. You're wasting your breath. \nDAVID Anyway, tomorrow we'll try to get more of a feel for the place. \nDANNY Absolutely. This would be a good place to do a little business. \nDavid catches Jenny's eye. This isn't what he meant by \"getting a feel for the place.\" \nDANNY All those little old ladies wandering around...I'll bet this place is rife with stats. \nJENNY Please explain what stats are. You're always going on about them. \nDAVID All right. Think of a number. Now think about the most boring lesson you've ever had at school. \nNow double it. Done? Doubled? Now multiply it by the number you first thought of, and there you are. That's the official boredom content of stats. \nJenny laughs. \n46   INT. B & B BEDROOM. NIGHT                                  46 \nA rather grotty and certainly unromantic B&B bedroom - so unromantic, in fact, that it even has the same fusty curtains from Jenny's sitting room. David is in bed, his hands behind his head, waiting for Jenny. As far as we can tell - he's wrapped up in the sheets quite tightly - he's in his underwear. The bedroom is lit unromantically by the 40-watt overhead light. Jenny comes into the room wearing one of Helen's nightdresses, a glamorous satiny item quite inappropriate for the occasion or the surroundings. She looks nervous. \nJENNY We've got exactly the same curtains at home. \nDAVID Let's not talk about curtains. You look beautiful. You really are a princess. \nJenny was about to get into bed, but his tone makes her pause at the edge of the bed. \nJENNY There's something you should know, David. I'm...Well, I'm a virgin. And I want to stay that way until I'm seventeen. \nDAVID I think that's good. I think that's right. And for your seventeenth birthday I'm going to take you to Paris or Rome or Florence and make you feel like the most beautiful princess in the kingdom of love. But we can still be romantic, can't we? \nJENNY Well, yes. Of course we can. If it doesn't mean... \nDAVID Minnie.... \nJENNY Is that me? \nDAVID Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse, and I'm your bubbalub. \nJENNY Oh. If that's what.. \nDAVID Minnie. \nJENNY Yes, David? \nDAVID (prompting) Bubbalub... \nJENNY Sorry. Yes, bubbalub? \nDAVID Would you mind if I had a look at what might one day be mine? Just a peek? \n"}

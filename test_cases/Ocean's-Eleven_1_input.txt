69   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               69 
As the balloons fill the frame of one monitor... 
SLIM 433, we have visual impairment on the east door camera. 
70   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                  70 
The SENTRY (#433) hears this and spots the balloons covering the embedded camera and approaches the delivery boy (who by freak accident happens to be Virgil Malloy)... 
SENTRY Excuse me, sir: You're going to have to move your balloons. 
... but Virgil's too busy picking a fight with the Tourist (surprise, surprise: Turk Malloy) to listen. 
VIRGIL Who you calling 'bud,' pal? 
TURK (TOURIST) Who you calling 'pal,' friend? 
VIRGIL Who you calling 'friend'... (can't think of another) ... bud... 
And with the Sentry out of position... 
... Livingston (dressed now in a technician's uniform, don't worry about how he got it) goes quickly to the door and swipes the newly-acquired keycard and when it flashes red-to-green, he enters... 
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00                            48. 
71   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                         71 
He's in. Livingston takes a moment, his brow perspiring (he's in the lions' den now), then checks his palm: drawn there in ballpoint is a diagram of the cage corridors. 
72   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY - ON         72 MONITOR NEXT TO BALLOON-CLOUDED ONE 
Livingston appears and, as nonchalantly as he can, he ambles down a hallway, then another, until he reaches... 
73   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                         73 
... an unmarked door next to the entrance to the security center. Livingston swipes his keycard to enter... 
74   INT. CIRCUITRY ROOM                                         74 
A giant walk-in closet/switchboard full of wires, plugs, lights, etc. Livingston goes to work: 
FLURRY OF SHOTS 
He splices into all sorts of wires and lines and cables. Meanwhile... 
75   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                 75 
... Virgil and Turk argue, nose-to-nose, "accidentally" blocking the Sentry from the balloons... 
VIRGIL You hear about this new medical discovery they made? It's called a 'sense of direction.' Apparently we're all supposed to have one... 
TURK Yeah yeah yeah, whatever, balloon boy. 
SENTRY Gentlemen, gentlemen... 
76   INT. CIRCUITRY ROOM                                             76 
Livingston's work here is almost done: he clips a small mechanism (known in his industry as a "spider" -- it's small, black, antenna-less and hides in dark places) to a main conduit, then verifies a tiny receiver he holds is picking up the spider's feed. 
One last click into place... 
77   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  77 
... causes a brief, unnoticed blip on Slim's monitors... 
78   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM - NIGHT                       78 
... and transmits all the views of the cages onto the monitors upstairs. Danny and Rusty witness their appearance. 
DANNY Why do they paint hallways that color? 
RUSTY They say taupe is very soothing. 
79   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                             79 
Livingston steps outside. His job done, he exhales and wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for directions and... 
Whoops. His sweat just smeared the ballpoint. He's flying blind. He looks left down a corridor, then right, trying to remember which way he came from. No idea. 
80   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM                               80 
DANNY Uh-oh. 
81   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                             81 
MOVING WITH Livingston as he tries to find his way out. He takes a left... 
Whoops again: here comes Fat, dead ahead.    Livingston has no recourse but to march right by him. 
(CONTINUED) 
81   CONTINUED:                                                       81 
FAT Hiya. 
LIVINGSTON Fine, thanks. 
Livingston continues on, and maybe for a second he thinks he's in the clear, especially when he sees the exit looming ahead, but then Fat turns behind him and hails him back... 
FAT Hey... 
82   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                      82 
At last, the Sentry outmaneuvers Virgil and Turk and grabs the balloons himself. Virgil quickly snatches them back... 
VIRGIL Hey... get your own balloons. 
83   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                              83 
Livingston approaches the exit's keypad and swipes his keycard: the light does not flash red-to-green. 
FAT (on his tail) Hey... 
Livingston looks: he swiped the wrong side of his keycard. He tries again. Red flashes to green. He pulls the door... 
... but Fat blocks it.       Livingston peers up, certain he's had it. 
84   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM                                84 
Danny and Rusty simultaneously lean forward. 
85   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                              85 
FAT You dropped this. 
Fat holds out Livingston's receiver and drops it in his hand.

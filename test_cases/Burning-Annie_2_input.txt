PRODUCTION DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
Abrupt CLOSE UP on MAX, a plain wall behind him. 
1 INT. LIMBO RADIO 1 
He is 20, normal looking, not too nebbish, punkish, bookish, or stylish. He is a high-strung guy, enjoying a rare moment of un-self-consciousness. 
MAX There's an old joke. It comes from "The Iliad," but I think it was popularized by Oscar Wilde. It goes like this: ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the woods one day. And he sees this rabbit, also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm, cuz he's been eating Mexican. The wiping's taking forever, and his shit keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The rabbit says no, shit just slides right off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up and wipes his ass with him. (pause, as if for applause) Well, I never said it was a good joke. And see, that makes it perfect, because it's pretty much the story of my life. 
We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t- shirt and old jeans. He gesticulates vaguely as he talks. 
MAX (CONT'D) Growing up, my parents were huge Woody Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a part of my background that I must have been about 16 by the time I realized how useless it was to rebel by ignoring the Beatles or any other cultural artifact of their generation. Even if I did spend my childhood hearing my father go on and on about how, like, Nirvana would never mean anything because they're not the Beatles, blah-blah. I don't know, this is all starting to sound a little bit too angsty, you know, and that's about the last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I really got off track there, didn't I? 
As Max shakes his head, a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into view. It has the call letters of a college radio station on it. 
High on the wall behind him, a glowing "ON AIR" light is revealed. The perspective is skewed, the studio appears cavernous and completely barren. 
2 INT. MAX'S CHILDHOOD HOME ­ FLASHBACK ­ DAY 2 
YOUNG MAX, about five, sits on the floor and watches BANANAS with his FATHER, a large, relaxed man with a mustache who reclines in a tacky 80's chair and smokes a cigar. 
MAX (O.S.) Anyway, like the Beatles thing­ and this is the point of that whole long-winded example­ I was force-fed Woody Allen from a young age. I remember watching Bananas when I was about five. Of course, I hated it. 
Young Max is laughing hysterically at the screen. 
Max stands to the side, watching his younger self and his father. The radio mike hangs in front of him. 
MAX (CONT'D) This is my old house. We lived here, in a dull suburb of New York, until I was ten, when we moved to a different house in a different dull suburb of New York. 
On TV, a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is chased by a group of soldiers. 
YOUNG MAX Daddy, why are they running after her? 
FATHER (KINDLY) Someday, you'll understand. Pay attention, you'll learn something. 
Young Max turns back to the screen, wide-eyed. 
3 INT. MAX'S SECOND HOME ­ FLASHBACK 3 
In pajamas, ADOLESCENT MAX, 16, watches a newer TV in an identical family room. This time, ANNIE HALL is playing. 
MAX (V.O.) Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw Annie Hall, but it was the first time I actually appreciated it. I was flipping channels on a Saturday afternoon, and there it was, and I was stunned to find I loved it, more stunned to find that my parents may have had a point all along. [MORE] 
MAX (V.O.) (cont'd) Although, they were definitely wrong about Bananas. 
CLOSE ON: Adolescent Max, totally engrossed in the film. 
4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY ­ FLASHBACK 4 
Adolescent Max walks alone to class. Other students rush by in groups. He looks a little lost. 
MAX (V.O.) Oh God, high school. I hated this place. I was a Junior when I gave up trying to fit in. Fortunately, being a social outcast is a lot easier when your school is filled with idiots. 
A pair of GOTH POSERS pass. Max keeps his distance. From the other direction, a 6 FOOT TALL GIRL makes eyes at Max. He walks into a water fountain, drops his books. 
5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM ­ FLASHBACK 5 
Adolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball. Everyone laughs at him, including the COACH. 
Max stands to the side and winces. 
MAX There was something in Annie Hall I identified with. Maybe it was the style of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I don't know. All I know is, I kept going back. Different people are inspired by different things, and my source of inspiration became a 20-year-old movie about a failed relationship. 
The volleyball rolls over and he picks it up. 
6 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 6 
From behind Max, we see the station as it really is: small, dark, cramped, and totally filled with crap. Max wears headphones, sits before a large console and audio gear. 
He now holds a volleyball.

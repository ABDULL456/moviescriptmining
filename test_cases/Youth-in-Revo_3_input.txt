INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking. Vijay and Taggarty grunt away on the top bunk. He watches the moon lit forms thumping together. He turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom bunk. He moves toward her. She blinks, waking and smiles at the sight of him. 
NICK Sheeni? 
SHEENI Yes, darling. 
NICK Was Trent here? 
SHEENI Yes, Nick. Nick hangs his head. 
SHEENI But I sent him away again. Nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he finds nothing but adoration. 
SHEENI Because I want you, darling. Not even Trent can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued me. 
She smiles. Nick smiles too. She reaches out to pull him into her bed as... The door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit by the harsh beam of the matron's flashlight. 
MATRON Q'est que c'est passer ici?!? Nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk. He lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... Trent standing behind the matron. The blinding light makes his features difficult to make out but his white teeth are definitely smiling diabolically. 
EXT. GIRLS' DORM - NIGHT 
The boys come out of the front door of the dormitory, the matron, flanked by SCHOOL SECURITY GUARDS, hot on their heels. The girls in the dorm appear on the balcony in droves, cheering the boys' escape. Vijay's pants fall to his ankles, tripping him up. Nick and Lefty grab Vijay by the arms and pull him up again as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the Vietnamese Army. They reach the Beamer at the edge of the grounds. Nick gets in first. Lefty dives through the back window, legs kicking. Vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security team catches up to them. The authorities bang on the windows as Nick peels out. INDIAN POP blares from the car. They speed off into the night. 
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT Lefty lets out a holler of joy. 
LEFTY I did it three times! Two long ones and a quickie. 
NICK Great. Just great. How about you, Vijay? 
VIJAY It was difficult to tell with that condom, Nick. Why did you buy such thick ones? 
NICK That brand was top-rated by Consumers. 
VIJAY Well, she's safe. No organism could penetrate those walls. 
NICK You think the girls are in trouble? 
VIJAY They will likely notify their parents. Perhaps even expel them. 
NICK That's it! Expel them. Then Sheeni will have to come back to Ukiah. The car sputters. Nick's eyes go to the gas gauge. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT 
The rain is coming down again. Nick shivers in his underwear. Vijay isn't in much more and Lefty's sheet is drenched. 
VIJAY What will we do? 
NICK Well, we can't stay in the car. Sooner or later Highway Patrol is going to come by and ask for our non-existent driver's license. 
LEFTY But we have no money! 
VIJAY I have no shoes! I'll catch pneumonia and die a indeterminate proto-quasi-virgin! 
EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT 
A couple coins are inserted into a roadside pay phone. There is ringing on the other end. 
ESTELLE (V.O.) Hello? 
NICK (into phone) Mom? It's Nick. I'm sorry to wake you, but I'm hoping you'll help your only son. Especially seeing as it would really piss off Dad. A long beat. 
ESTELLE (V.O.) Where are you, Nick? 
EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT 
The three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay phone. The three of them huddle under their only windbreaker. A pair of headlights appear in the rain. The headlights flash twice and Nick runs out into the road. 
POV TRUCK DRIVER Nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie-whities. The truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to reveal, the driver, a man named WALLY RUMPKIN, a seven foot tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls. He looks down at our three waylaid adventurers. 
WALLY Pardon me. But is one of you Nick Twisp? The two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if this is how people go missing. 
NICK Yeah. I'm Nick. 
WALLY I'm Wally. I'm a friend of your mom's. Nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being sent on a midnight mission.

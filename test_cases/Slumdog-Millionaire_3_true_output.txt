A raised eye-brow at the audience. Amusement ruffles through them. 
PREM (CONT'D) And what does an Assistant Phone- basher do, exactly? 
JAMAL I- I get tea for people and-

PREM - a chi-wallah! Why didn't you say? 
Laughter in the audience.

10   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.                          10 
Jamal's body dangles motionless from the ceiling. His head is bowed and he is moaning to himself. The ceiling fan thumps round slowly. In the corner, Constable Srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette. Hot work. The door opens and the Inspector of Police walks in. A rumpled man in his late forties who has seen pretty much everything. He eyes Jamal, surprised. 
INSPECTOR Has he confessed, yet? 
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS Apart from his name, I can't get a word out of the runt. 
INSPECTOR You've been here all bloody night, Srinivas. What have you been doing? 
Srinivas shrugs. 
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS Tough guy. 
INSPECTOR A little electricity will loosen his tongue. 
Constable Srinivas brings a box and a tangle of wires out of a cupboard and proceeds to put crocodile clips on Jamal's fingers. The Inspector stares, deep in thought. Sweat trickles down his face. He wipes it away with a handkerchief, seems to be talking to himself. 
INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Every night I get home, "why can't we have a/c like Bajan Chacha? (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
10   CONTINUED:                                                 10 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Why don't you care about your poor family, dying in this heat." Twenty-four years a policeman and I can't afford bloody a/c. 
Turns on Jamal. 
INSPECTOR (CONT'D) But you. You've got ten million rupees ek dum guaranteed, yaar? And who knows how much further? Fancy the twenty million, do you? 
Jamal just stares. 
INSPECTOR (CONT'D) I think you probably do. 
The Inspector nods absently to Constable Srinivas who turns a handle. Jamal's body pulsates and jerks. He screams. His body goes limp again. The Inspector goes over to Jamal. 
INSPECTOR (CONT'D) So. Were you wired up? A mobile or a pager, correct? Some little hidden gadget? No? A coughing accomplice in the audience? Microchip under the skin, huh? 
Constable Srinivas hadn't thought of that. Grabs Jamal's arms and starts squeezing them all over until the Inspector has had enough. 
INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Srinivas! Look, it's hot, my wife is giving me hell, I've got a desk full of murderers, rapists, extortionists, assorted bum-bandits...and you. Why don't you save us both a lot of time? Hmm? 
Jamal doesn't answer. The Inspector sighs and sits down. Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas again. Jamal's body jerks with electric current. When the shudders and screams have subsided, the Inspector goes over to Jamal's collapsed form. Clicks his fingers in front of Jamal's face to check for a response. 
INSPECTOR OF POLICE He's unconscious, chutiya. What good is that? How many times have I told you-? 
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS Sorry, Sir. (CONTINUED) 
10   CONTINUED: (2)                                             10 
An excited Young Police Constable sticks his head around the door. 
YOUNG CONSTABLE He's coming! Sir. 
INSPECTOR Ar√© wa, Srinivas, we'll have Amnesty International in here next, peeing their pants about human rights. Get him down, tidy him up, for God's sake. 
Constable Srinivas goes over to Jamal and starts to undo the crocodile clips. 
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS Maybe he did know the answers. 
INSPECTOR Have you gone soft, Srinivas? Professors, lawyers, doctors, General Knowledge Wallahs never get beyond sixteen thousand rupees. And he's on ten million? What the hell can a slum dog possibly know? 
Jamal lifts his head. 
JAMAL The answers. 
He lifts his head, spits blood out of his mouth and says again, straight into the Inspector's face. 
JAMAL (CONT'D) I know the answers. 
Titles. Slum Dog Millionaire. 
11   EXT. CRICKET GROUND. DAY.                                  11 
Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present Mumbai dust. A group of children are playing cricket on a tarmac cricket ground. They are bare-foot, dressed in little more than rags, wiry-skinny and fast on their feet. Salim, a nine-year old, polishes the ball on his almost non-existent shorts, comes in with surprising speed and bowls. The batsman hooks it high in the air. The bowler screams at a boy in the outfield. 
SALIM Jamal! Catch it! Catch it! 
The seven-year old Jamal stares up at the ball, jinks around trying to get into position.

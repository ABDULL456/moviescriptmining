Max reaches into his backpack and says mysteriously: 
MAX 
By the way, what time does the library close? I got an overdue book to turn in. 
Max takes out the Jacques Cousteau library book and hands it to Miss Cross. She looks at it and starts to say something but she stops. She opens the book and looks at it in silence. 
MAX 
That's your handwriting, isn't it? 
Max shows her the Henry James quote. Miss Cross nods. 
MAX 
Not bad. Except it's probably bad form for a teacher to write in a library book. 
MISS CROSS 
It wasn't a library book when I wrote in it. 
MAX 
What do you mean? 
MISS CROSS 
I gave this book to Rushmore. 
Max looks puzzled. Miss Cross shows him a little card inside the front cover of the book. 
INSERT LIBRARY BOOK: 
In Memory of EDWARD APPLEBY 
Class of '87 
MISS CROSS 
My husband gave me this book in the seventh grade. And he went to Rushmore. So when he died I put it in the library here. 
MAX 
So that's who that is. Edward Appleby. 
(looks to Miss Cross) 
You already knew him in the seventh grade? 
MISS CROSS 
I knew him all my life. 
(looks to Max) 
You remind me of him, you know? 
MAX 
I do? How? 
MISS CROSS 
Well. Weren't you in the Rushmore Beekeepers? 
MAX 
(frowns) 
Yeah. I was President of them. 
MISS CROSS 
He founded that club. 
MAX 
(pause) 
I get your meaning. I founded a few clubs myself in my day. 
An acorn falls on Max's head. He looks up. There is no one there, but a scurrying sound is heard. Max frowns. 
MAX 
What was that? A squirrel? 
Mr. Blume is crouched just out of view on the roof. He looks back over his shoulder and sees a small, white-haired, Indian GROUNDSKEEPER looking at him. The groundskeeper is holding a rake. Mr. Blume rises slowly. He whispers: 
MR. BLUME 
Is this the natatorium? 
The groundskeeper frowns and shakes his head. 
MAX 
Do you think we can be friends again, Miss Cross? In a strictly platonic way? 
MISS CROSS 
Of course, I do. Do you think you can make a go of it and settle down at Grover Cleveland? 
MAX 
Yeah. But I need a tutor. 
MISS CROSS 
I'll be your tutor. 
MAX 
(looking into her eyes) 
You will? 
Miss Cross smiles and nods. 
MAX 
Thank you. 
(pause) 
What are you doing tomorrow? 
CUT TO: 
Mr. Blume sitting at the desk in his office. Max yells at him over the speakerphone: 
MAX 
She's taking me to a field trip! 
MR. BLUME 
(hesitates) 
Great! You need anybody to chaperone? 
MAX

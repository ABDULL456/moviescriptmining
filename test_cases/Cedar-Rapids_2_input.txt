BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) Point is, I'm not exactly dancing in the streets here Tim, but it's a perception thing. You go down there to Cedar Rapids, wholesome and pie- eyed and all that. You show them that Northlands is a good outfit-- an upstanding Christian outfit... 
Tim considers the gravity of this moment. 
BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) Aw cripes, say you'll do it. 
Krogstad starts crying again. He hugs Tim, his bloody hand staining Tim's canary yellow V-neck sweater. Tim looks up to see the Gambskys in the conference room staring at him. 
MONTAGE -- 
A melancholic yet uplifting song (Leonard Cohen's HALLELUJAH, perhaps) plays as: 
- Tim puts birdseed in his backyard feeder. He looks at the barren trees as he considers his fate. 
- Tim Googles "Cedar Rapids." He looks at photos, crime statistics, a Chamber of Commerce Youtube video. He closes his eyes, exhales. 
- Tim practices the presentation in front of a mirror. He works late. He types. He Power Points. Krogstad critiques. 
- Tim laminates maps of Cedar Rapids and area attractions. 
- Tim pulls a dusty American Tourister suitcase from the attic. It looks about 40 years old. He packs. 
INT./EXT. TIM'S BUICK SKYLARK - MORNING 
Tim looks pensive as he drives. He's wearing a new suit. It's a little too big. A greeting card and a Beanie Baby Rooster bounce along on the passenger's seat. 
Tim pulls up to a SPLIT-LEVEL HOUSE. A pick-up truck with the words Brodt Heating & Cooling is parked in the driveway. 
INT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Tim pokes his head into a living room, surprised to see Wade, the 60-ish bald guy from church, reclining on a Lazy Boy. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
Wade's boots are off. His socks are dirty. He's watching ESPN on a TV with an Olan-Mills portrait of Tim & Millie atop it. 
WADE Oh, hiya Tim. 
TIM Hey. Wade. Hey. Is Millie...? 
Millie enters in a terry cloth robe. A Yorkshire Terrier follows her. Millie acts nonchalant. So does the dog. 
MILLIE Hi Tim. (re. Wade's presence) Wade's cable's down. 
TIM It's six AM...? 
WADE Mike & Mike in the Morning. ESPN 2. 
TIM Oh yeah. Those guys. Hilarious. Ha. 
WADE Mm. 
TIM (finally, to Millie) Well I just wanted to... 
He displays the Beanie Baby and the card. She takes them with a cold smile. Tim notices an identical stuffed rooster on an oak bookshelf-- home to over 155 other Beanie Babies. 
TIM (CONT'D) Oh shoot. You already have a Strut the Rooster... 
MILLIE So this is it then? (TO WADE) Tim's jetting off to Cedar Rapids this morning, Wade. Big deal insurance convention. Iowa. 
WADE That right? 
TIM It's only four days. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
MILLIE Won't go to Germany for our honeymoon, but for work you can just gallivant around like Tom Petty or one of them? 
TIM (TO WADE) We agreed on the Dells... (then, to Millie) Should we maybe talk in the...? 
WADE Oh it don't bother me. 
Tim tries to proceed as if Wade weren't sitting there. 
TIM If I don't try to do this, it's not just my job, Mil. There are four other employees whose lives are on the line. Plus Carol, who does part time seasonal work. So. 
MILLIE It's not for certain a new owner would even keep you guys on. 
TIM No, Bill said he'd make that part of any deal... 
MILLIE Believe you me, Bill Krogstad is looking out for one guy. And that's Bill Krogstad. 
WADE (OVERTLY DISPARAGING) Krogstad.

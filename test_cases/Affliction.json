{"test1_input": "\"AFFLICTION\" \nScreenplay by \nPaul Schrader \nBased on a novel by \nRussell Banks \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nCREDITS \nStill-life tableaus. Lawford, N.H., a town of fifty buildings on a glacial ridge, neither mountain nor plateau. Developed as 1880's forestland, discarded in the Depression. Winter has set in. Halloween day. Snowy fields yield to overcast skies: oppressive, horizonless, flourescent. \n-- Wickham's Restaurant. Where Route 29 bends. 24-hour diner. Margie Fogg works here. \n-- Trailer park in shadow of Parker Mountain. Home of Wade Whitehouse. \n-- Toby's Inn. Roadhouse three miles from town on the river side of Route 29. Everything not tied down ends up here. \n-- Glen Whitehouse farm. White clapboard. \n-- First Congregational Church. North on the Common from City Hall. \n-- LaRiviere Co. Ramshackle well-digging firm embarrassingly near the town center. Wade works here. \n-- Merritt's Shell Station. Cinder-block. \n-- Alma Pittman's house. Like so many others. \n-- Town Hall. \nROLFE WHITEHOUSE'S VOICE, thirtiesh, articulate, speaks over credit tableaus: \nROLFE (V.O.) This is the story of my older brother's strange criminal behavior and disappearance. We who loved him no longer speak of Wade. It's as if he never existed. By telling his story like this, as his brother, I separate myself from his family and those who loved him. Everything of importance -- that is, everything that gives rise to the telling of this story -- occurred during a single deer-hunting season in a small town in upstate New Hampshire where Wade was raised and so was I. One night something changed and my relation to Wade's story was different from what it had been since childhood. I mark this change by Wade's tone of voice during a phone call two nights after Halloween. Something I had not heard before. Let us imagine that around eight o'clock on Halloween Eve, speeding past Toby's, Route 29, comes a pale green eight-year-old Ford Fairlane with a police bubble on top. A square-faced man wearing a trooper's cap is driving the vehicle. Beside him sits a child, a little girl with a plastic tiger mask covering her face. The man is driving fast -- \n-- Route 29 tableau dissolves to night. A pale green police Ford Fairlane drives past. \nEND CREDITS \nINT./EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nWADE WHITEHOUSE, driving, sits beside JILL, his daughter, ten years-old, wearing a black-and-yellow tiger plastic mask. \nWADE I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember. \nJILL Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy. \nWADE (shakes cigarette from pack) Yeah. \nJILL Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out. \nWade watches boys in the headlights, lights cigarette. \nWADE Those are the Hoyts. \nJILL I don't care. They're out. \nWADE Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ. \n", "test1_true": "JILL Why do they do that? \nWADE Do what? \nJILL You know. \nWADE Break stuff? \nJILL Yeah. It's stupid. \nWADE I guess they're stupid. \nJILL Did you do that when you were a kid? \nWADE Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that. \nJILL Was it funny? \nWADE To us it was. \nJILL But it's not funny now. \nWADE It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change. \nJILL I bet you did lots of bad things. \nWADE What are you talking about? \nJILL I just think you used to be bad. \nWADE No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother? \nJILL No. She doesn't talk about you anymore. \nWade looks at her, wanting to lift her mask, see her face. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT \nThe Fairlane approaches Town Hall, a square two-story building on the north side of the Common. Exhaust billows from idling cars as parents and children come and go. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT \nClowns, tramps, angels and vampires fill the brightly lit room. Parents watch from the walls as GORDON LARIVIERE, a beefy fiftiesh man with a silver flat-top, announces the costume contest. Wade nods to various townspeople. \nLARIVIERE We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all! \nWADE (nudges Jill) Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize. \nJill steps forward, retreats. Wade looks at her flaxen hair, her blue sneakers protruding from her pathetic costume. His heart aches he loves her so. \nWADE Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know. \nJILL I don't want to. \nWADE Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long. \nJILL It's not that. \n", "test1_id": 1260, "test2_input": "WADE What then? \nJILL It's stupid. \nWADE It's fun. \nJILL (voice breaking) I want to go home. (Wade kneels down) I don't like it here. \nWADE Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam. \nWade inches her toward the circle of children. Gordon spots them: \nLARIVIERE Wade! And who's that tiger? Is that Jill? Come and join us. \nJill in the spotlight, joins the costumed children. A former classmate calls her name. Wade, relieved, watches, then steps outside for a smoke. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT \nWade steps outside, lights a cigarette. JACK HEWITT, 23, clean-cut, handsome, cocky, stands with CHICK WARD and FRANKIE LACOY, local boys. \nWADE What are you boys up to? \nCHICK Same old shit. \nFRANKIE You see the damage these little sons- of bitches been raising tonight? \nWADE (to Jack) You're going to have to move your pickup. \nJACK I know. \nCHICK (offers whiskey pint) Take a bite. \nWADE Don't mind if I do. \nJACK LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies. \nWADE Where's that gun you were bragging on today? \nJack stops over to his double-parked burgandy pickup, removes a Browning BAR .30/06 with a scope, hands it to Wade. \nJACK No brag. Just fact. \nWADE (admires gun) Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? (passes it to Frankie) \nFRANKIE Nice. \nJACK (to Wade) See you got Jill tonight. How'd you manage that? \nWADE (turns) Don't forget to move your truck. (walks inside) \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT \nOn stage, LaRiviere arranges the contest winners. A fairy godmother with a wand beams while, nearby, a hobo writhes in his mother's grip -- a hard loser. \nWade looks for Jill, first among the winners, then among the losers; she's nowhere to be found. He heads toward a hall leading to the restrooms. \nJill stands alone in the corner next to the pay phone, tiny, forlorn. Wade realizes at once he was wrong to leave her before she had found a friend. \n", "test2_true": "JILL No. \nWADE No what? \nJILL (lifts mask atop head) No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home. \nWADE You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here. \nJILL I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home. \nWADE (sighs) Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something. \nJILL (pause) I called Mommy. \nWADE What? You called Mommy? Just now? \nJILL Yes. \nWADE Jesus, why? \nJILL I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me. \nWADE Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first? \nJILL See, I knew you'd be mad. \nWADE Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake? \nJILL I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me. \nWADE Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother. (takes her arm) C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT \nWade leads her to a frosted-glass door reading \"POLICE\", enters. Inside, he flips on flourescent light, dials the desk phone. More utility room than office. \nHe waits. There's no answer. Jill looks down. \nWADE She's gone already! (hangs up) Gone already! Couldn't wait. \nJILL Yes. \nWADE That's all you got to say? \"Yes\". \nJILL Yes. \nWADE She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long? \nJILL Yes. \nWADE Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough. \nJill sits in a chair facing the dark window pane. \nWADE Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs. \nJILL That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here. \nWade Whitehouse stalks out. \n", "test2_id": 1261, "test3_input": "WADE So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident. \nROLFE A hunting accident is perfect. \nWADE Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled. \nThe truck sputters, stops. Wade pulls the keys. \nWADE It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off? \nROLFE Not particularly. \nWADE Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right? \nROLFE I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember? \nThe sun is down. Wade tucks the keys in a knotted board. \nROLFE I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after. \nWADE Yeah. \nROLFE I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened. \nWADE Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it? \nROLFE It may have happened, but not the way you said. \nWADE You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that? \nROLFE It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne. \nWADE We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him. \nROLFE And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft. \nWADE (laughs) Well, I never heard that one. \nROLFE I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence. \nWADE (laughs again) That's what you think. \nRolfe looks out: the cobalt sky has turned black. \nROLFE I gotta head back. It's a long drive. \nThey walk toward the house. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LARIVIERE CO. GARAGE - DAY \nWade walks in as Jack and Jimmy prepare to head out, their drilling rig loaded with pipe. Gordon yells at Jack: \nLARIVIERE Put out that fucking cigarette! \nJack opens the truck ashtray. \nLARIVIERE Not there, asshole. Flush it! \nHewitt trudges to the john. \n", "test3_true": "LaRiviere smiles, goes to his office as Wade hangs his coat in his locker. Jack cruises over. \nJACK I'm fucking out of here. \nWADE Lawford? \nJACK Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks. \nJack gets in the cab of the drilling truck. Wade follows. \nJACK Open the door, will ya? \nWADE Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad? \nJACK Open the door. We're late. \nWADE I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow. \nJACK What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you. \nWade grins, goes to activate the door. \nWADE Looney Tunes, Jack. Fucking Looney Tunes! \nThe drilling truck pulls out the garage, onto the road. From the opposite direction a black BMW slows, enters. Mel Gordon. \nWade, all eyes and ears, watches. Mel Gordon parks in front of the office, gets out. Elaine calls: \nELAINE (O.S.) Mr. Gordon! \nMEL GORDON The boss in? \nELAINE (O.S.) Yes indeedy! \nWade flips the door switch. Mel Gordon and LaRiviere talk. Yeah. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CONCORD - DAY \nThe South Main Street office of J. Battle Hand, lawyer. Concord is a real town, with traffic, stores, people with places to go. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY \nJ. BATTLE HAND, 60, sits in a wheel chair behind his desk. Wade, uncomfortable in work clothes, tries not to show it. \nWADE I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father. \nHAND It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work. \nWADE I plan to. Soon. \nHAND How soon? \nWADE This spring. \nHAND Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child. \nWADE It looks pretty hopeless, don't it? \n", "test3_id": 1262}

{"train": "\"AFFLICTION\" \nScreenplay by \nPaul Schrader \nBased on a novel by \nRussell Banks \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nCREDITS \nStill-life tableaus. Lawford, N.H., a town of fifty buildings on a glacial ridge, neither mountain nor plateau. Developed as 1880's forestland, discarded in the Depression. Winter has set in. Halloween day. Snowy fields yield to overcast skies: oppressive, horizonless, flourescent. \n-- Wickham's Restaurant. Where Route 29 bends. 24-hour diner. Margie Fogg works here. \n-- Trailer park in shadow of Parker Mountain. Home of Wade Whitehouse. \n-- Toby's Inn. Roadhouse three miles from town on the river side of Route 29. Everything not tied down ends up here. \n-- Glen Whitehouse farm. White clapboard. \n-- First Congregational Church. North on the Common from City Hall. \n-- LaRiviere Co. Ramshackle well-digging firm embarrassingly near the town center. Wade works here. \n-- Merritt's Shell Station. Cinder-block. \n-- Alma Pittman's house. Like so many others. \n-- Town Hall. \nROLFE WHITEHOUSE'S VOICE, thirtiesh, articulate, speaks over credit tableaus: \nROLFE (V.O.) This is the story of my older brother's strange criminal behavior and disappearance. We who loved him no longer speak of Wade. It's as if he never existed. By telling his story like this, as his brother, I separate myself from his family and those who loved him. Everything of importance -- that is, everything that gives rise to the telling of this story -- occurred during a single deer-hunting season in a small town in upstate New Hampshire where Wade was raised and so was I. One night something changed and my relation to Wade's story was different from what it had been since childhood. I mark this change by Wade's tone of voice during a phone call two nights after Halloween. Something I had not heard before. Let us imagine that around eight o'clock on Halloween Eve, speeding past Toby's, Route 29, comes a pale green eight-year-old Ford Fairlane with a police bubble on top. A square-faced man wearing a trooper's cap is driving the vehicle. Beside him sits a child, a little girl with a plastic tiger mask covering her face. The man is driving fast -- \n-- Route 29 tableau dissolves to night. A pale green police Ford Fairlane drives past. \nEND CREDITS \nINT./EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nWADE WHITEHOUSE, driving, sits beside JILL, his daughter, ten years-old, wearing a black-and-yellow tiger plastic mask. \nWADE I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember. \nJILL Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy. \nWADE (shakes cigarette from pack) Yeah. \nJILL Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out. \nWade watches boys in the headlights, lights cigarette. \nWADE Those are the Hoyts. \nJILL I don't care. They're out. \nWADE Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ. \nWADE What then? \nJILL It's stupid. \nWADE It's fun. \nJILL (voice breaking) I want to go home. (Wade kneels down) I don't like it here. \nWADE Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam. \nWade inches her toward the circle of children. Gordon spots them: \nLARIVIERE Wade! And who's that tiger? Is that Jill? Come and join us. \nJill in the spotlight, joins the costumed children. A former classmate calls her name. Wade, relieved, watches, then steps outside for a smoke. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT \nWade steps outside, lights a cigarette. JACK HEWITT, 23, clean-cut, handsome, cocky, stands with CHICK WARD and FRANKIE LACOY, local boys. \nWADE What are you boys up to? \nCHICK Same old shit. \nFRANKIE You see the damage these little sons- of bitches been raising tonight? \nWADE (to Jack) You're going to have to move your pickup. \nJACK I know. \nCHICK (offers whiskey pint) Take a bite. \nWADE Don't mind if I do. \nJACK LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies. \nWADE Where's that gun you were bragging on today? \nJack stops over to his double-parked burgandy pickup, removes a Browning BAR .30/06 with a scope, hands it to Wade. \nJACK No brag. Just fact. \nWADE (admires gun) Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? (passes it to Frankie) \nFRANKIE Nice. \nJACK (to Wade) See you got Jill tonight. How'd you manage that? \nWADE (turns) Don't forget to move your truck. (walks inside) \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT \nOn stage, LaRiviere arranges the contest winners. A fairy godmother with a wand beams while, nearby, a hobo writhes in his mother's grip -- a hard loser. \nWade looks for Jill, first among the winners, then among the losers; she's nowhere to be found. He heads toward a hall leading to the restrooms. \nJill stands alone in the corner next to the pay phone, tiny, forlorn. Wade realizes at once he was wrong to leave her before she had found a friend. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT \nWade steps outside, notices Jack Hewitt and his kewpie-doll girlfriend HETTIE, 20, sitting in the cab of his double-parked pickup, sharing a joint, talking to LaCoy alongside. \nWADE I thought I told you to move that truck! \nJACK Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke? \nWADE (steps over) You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job. \nJACK Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. (offers joint) \nWADE Not here. \nLaCoy laughs: that Jack Hewitt, some guy. Wade holds his aching jaw. He looks at Jack's young athletic body, his pretty girlfriend, envies him. \nJACK Well, c'mon, then. Get in and we'll take a little ride, my man. \nWade looks up to the window where Jill waits, walks around the front of the truck, gets in. \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. JACK'S TRUCK - NIGHT \nJack's high-bodied pickup growls in low gear as it drives past Merritt's Shell station toward Saddleback Ridge. Jack lowers the radio as Wade asks him about deer season; Hettie leans forward to hear the music. \nJACK Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er -- \nWADE Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky. \nJACK Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there. \nWADE How'd you get the job? \nJACK Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy. \nWade grimaces as he passes the joint back. \nHETTIE What's wrong with you? \nWADE Toothache. (to Jack) You should get close to him. Make yourself irreplaceable. Guy's loaded. \nJACK Like you and Gordon? \nWADE Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me. \nJACK (laughs) Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him. \nWADE (laughs) Right! \nA car flashes past. \nJACK Bastard's got his high beams on. \nWADE (watching) Shit. \nHETTIE What? \nWADE My ex-wife Lillian and her husband. That was them in the Audi that just passed us. \nWade looks down, picks up Horner's dark green Tyrolean hat, examines it, as if unsure of its function. \nWade walks toward Town Hall. MARGIE FOGG, exiting, greets him: \nMARGIE New hat? (no answer) Jill's up, I see. \nWADE (vague) For a while. \nMARGIE How's she doing? \nWADE Okay. She's fine. \nMARGIE You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off. \nNICK WICKHAM, 45, Marg's boss, passes by: \nWICKHAM Like hell you are. Tomorrow's first day of deer season. I'll need you at least in the morning. \nMARGIE (shrugs) Well, that's that. \nNICK (walks off) Take care, Wade. \nWADE You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know. \nMARGIE (laughs) Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break. \nWADE See you tomorrow, maybe. \nMARGIE You okay? \nWADE Yeah. \nWade, lost in thought, continues toward Town Hall. At the door, LaRiviere, one of the last to leave, eyes him. Wade tosses Horner's hat inside. \nWADE Tomorrow, Gordon. \nLARIVIERE Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight. \nWade nods as he lights a cigarette. Alone, he watches the last cars pull out. He holds his jaw. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WADE'S TRAILER HOME - DAWN \nPre-dawn light silhouettes a dozen weather-beaten mobile homes set off Route 29. Snow continues to fall. A sheet of white stretches down Parker mountain. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WADE'S TRAILER - DAWN \n6:40. A clock radio pierces the silence with classic rock. Wade Whitehouse rolls over, runs his tongue across mossy teeth, shuts off the music. He looks out the window, grunts: \"Shit!\" He steps over to the phone by the frayed plaid couch, dials. \nWade's trailer is surprisingly neat, considering its owner smokes too much, drinks too much, eats take-out and rarely cleans up. \nWADE (on phone) Lugene? Wade. Hoya doin? (fumbles for cigarette) Look, I was wondering, with the snow and all, if you got school today? (lights cigarette) How the hell do I know? You're the principal. All I'm supposed to do is direct traffic from 7:30 to 8:30. (listens) Yeah, okay, I'm sorry -- I only just now saw it was snowing, that's all. My whole day is fucked. I gotta plow all day. If I don't get over to LaRiviere's early enough, I'm stuck with the grader. I was just hoping you'd have called school off. (beat) You check the weather bureau? (acquiesces) Okay, I hear you. I'll be over in a bit. (hangs up) \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WADE'S TRAILER HOME EARLY - MORNING \nJack Hewitt's 4x4 passes Wade's trailer, continues up 29. Tire chains splice the path. \nLUGENE Did you get his number? \nWADE I know who it is. \nLUGENE Good. Who? \nWADE Mel Gordon. \nLUGENE I still don't understand -- \nWADE From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned. \nWade sets his face, thinking. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nSnowprints lead from Jack's pickup to where he and Twombley walk, guns pointed skyward. They enter a line of trees. \nJack watches Twombley walk ahead of him, wrapped like a huge infant in red bunting, crunching twigs underfoot. He looks from side to side, checks his gun, returns to watching Twombley. They're alone. \nJACK Safety on? \nTwombley nods, slips, thumps to the ground. His rifle lands silently. \nJack sprints over, helps him up, safety latches the Winchester. Hands it back. \nTWOMBLEY I'm okay. \nJACK Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow. \nJack finds a path, one eye on Twombley: \nJACK I used to play ball. \nTWOMBLEY Yeah? \nJACK Drafted by the Red Sox. \nTWOMBLEY You played for the Sox? \nJACK Double A. New Britain. \nTWOMBLEY Oh. \nJACK Pitcher. \"Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk.\" \nTWOMBLEY Really. \nJACK They said. \nTWOMBLEY Hmm. \nJACK The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck. \nTWOMBLEY What happened? \nJACK Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm. \nJack waits for Twombley as they enter a meadow. Jack aims his rifle at Twombley as he approaches. \nTwombley peers over a slight cliff at a lumber trail twenty feet below. Jack points: \nJACK Fresh tracks. (sniffs) Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around. \nTWOMBLEY You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks. \nJack zig-zags down the incline, while Twombley, gun poised, waddles along the edge. \nJack stops fifty feet away, watches Twombley, a cartoon character. A stag pokes his nose through the pines, steps into a clearing. Jack aims his rifle, looks at Twombley. \nTwombley turns to see the buck, loses his footing, TUMBLES down the twenty-foot cliff. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOBY'S INN - DAY \nAn open cab grader (\"Our Business Is Going In The Hole\") sits in the rutted lot outside Toby's, a beer joint with fake wood siding and 24-hour neon sign. \nA four-wheel drive plow with the LaRiviere motto pulls in, parks beside the blue grader. JIMMY DAME, 40, gets out, glances at the grader as he enters. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOBY'S INN - DAY \nJimmy joins Wade at the bar, calls for a beer. Frankie LaCoy bullshits with two long-haired locals at a nearby table; their conversation drifts in and out. Country music plays through a broken juke box speaker. Wade touches his tooth, grimaces. \nJIMMY How's it goin? \nWADE Cold. How you think? \nJIMMY Sorry about that. Why's it every year, come first snow, you get stuck with the grader? \nWADE School. Traffic crossing. (lights cigarette) I gotta quit these things. \nJIMMY What we doing after? Wells? (Wade nods) Don't work too fast. Business the way it is, Gordon's probably looking to lay me off earlier than usual this year. He's got too much money as it is. Why's it always the little guy that gets kicked in the butt in hard times? \nWade shrugs. LaCoy's conversation has caught his ear. He turns to watch. \nLACOY ...That was no pisser. I'll tell you who was a pisser. Glen Whitehouse. There was a real pisser. He was mean normal, but when he drank it was like he burst on fire. Canadian Club. Always drank CC. One Christmas there's this cord of wood out back he forgot about and he decides to have his two boys stack it. Except it's been out back two months and it's snowed and rained and froze so now the wood's all iced in. He takes the boys. He was drunk, of course. \nWade's face as the story comes to life: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY (1964) \nThirty years before. GLEN WHITEHOUSE (\"POP\"), 42, pushes his boys, Wade (13) and Rolfe (10), toward snow-covered lumps of firewood behind the barn. He's drunk. The boys carry shovels and a pickaxe. \nPOP Move it! Daylight in the swamps! \nROLFE Pop, the kids are waiting for us. \nWADE (reproving) Rolfe. \nPOP A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day. (to house) Sally, turn off that TV! \nHis sons chip at the wood. Hopeless. Frozen solid. \nWADE (to Rolfe) Just do it. \nPOP Atta-go. \nLARIVIERE You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit. \nWADE Like hell. \nAhead, they see flashing lights and cars. A white emergency vehicle passes, jolting the pickup. \nLARIVIERE (frightened) That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley. \nWADE You want me to follow them to Littleton? \nLARIVIERE Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ACCIDENT SCENE - DAY \nWade pulls behind three state trooper cars. Jack stands joking with the TROOPERS, one of whom holds a German shepherd on a leash. LaRiviere and Wade jump out. Jack, suddenly serious, turns to LaRiviere: \nJACK You heard the news. \nLARIVIERE I hear Twombley got shot. \nJACK Yeah. \nWade walks over to trooper ASA BROWN, pets the shepherd. \nBROWN Watch the dog, Wade. Takes a mind to, he'll tear your fucking head off. \nLARIVIERE (to Jack) Bad? \nBROWN Thirty-thirty at close range. \nLARIVIERE Jesus. \nWADE Will he make it? \nBROWN (shakes head) D.O.A. Blew the bastard wide open. Had a hole in back you could put your head into. Pretty big hole in front too. You could've put your fist into that one. \nLARIVIERE (to Jack) You see it? \nJACK Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in. \nLARIVIERE This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade? \nWADE I seen 'em. Near ran me over. \nBROWN You wanna tell 'em, Gordon? You knew the old man. \nLARIVIERE What the fuck. My day's already ruined. (to Wade) Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do. \nWADE It ain't done, if that's what you mean. \nLARIVIERE Something bugging you? \nWADE Yeah. A few things. \nLARIVIERE Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time. \nBrown walks off with shepherd. \nLARIVIERE (to Jack) Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right? \nCUT TO: \nINT. WADE'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nLate. Wade Whitehouse, lying in bed with an icepack on his cheek, talks on the phone: \nWADE Rolfe. \nROLFE (O.S.) Wade? \nWADE Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley? \nROLFE (O.S.) There was something. It happened up your way. \nWADE Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend. \nROLFE (O.S.) Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits. \nWADE No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ACCIDENT SCENE - DAY \nWade's theory -- in black-and-white: Twombley's footing slips. Jack turns to watch. Twombley's gun hits frozen rocks, fires, blows a hole through his chest. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WADE'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nWADE It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it. \nROLFE (O.S.) He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business. \nWADE Who? \nROLFE (O.S.) Twombley. \nWADE No shit. \nROLFE (O.S.) You think Jack shot him? \nWADE Well, it was an accident. \nROLFE (O.S.) They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ACCIDENT SCENE - DAY \nAnother theory: Black-and-white. Jack sees a figure run from Twombley's body. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WADE'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nWade shifts the phone from ear to ear: \nWADE Lillian was here. In Lawford. \nROLFE (O.S.) Huh? \nMRS. GORDON Something about my father? \nWADE Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal. \nMRS. GORDON Can't it wait, then? \nMEL GORDON, 40, dark-eyed, wearing a tartan robe, steps behind his wife. \nMEL GORDON Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead. \nWADE How's that? \nMel folds his arms. His wife goes inside. \nMEL GORDON I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.' \nWADE Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment. \nMEL GORDON What the hell are you talking about? \nWADE I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation. \nMEL GORDON Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts? \nWADE (writing) Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you-- \nMEL GORDON (stops Wade's arm) Hold on! \nWADE (wrenches hand free) Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon. \nMEL GORDON You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something? \nWADE Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just -- \nMEL GORDON Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too. \nWADE Yes. Here's your ticket. \nMEL GORDON (refusing ticket) You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now! \nMel Gordon moves Wade out of the door, slams it. Wade steps away, looks back at the house. Mrs. Gordon watches him from the window. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARGIE FOGG'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA wood frame house off the main drag. Snowing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWade and Margie, post-coital: \nMARGIE Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks. \nWADE There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually. \nMARGIE I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her... \nWADE I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did. \nMARGIE (uncertain) Oh, Wade. \nWADE I've been thinking about it, that's all. \nMARGIE You've been married twice -- \nWADE It was to the same woman. I was just a kid... (Marg looks) It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know? \nMARGIE Alright. I'll think about it. \nWADE Good. \nHe kisses her. His jaw winces in pain. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAYBREAK (1964) \nTHE FLASHBACK CONTINUES: \nGlen Whitehouse, plastered, yells at Wade, age 13: \nPOP I've got sons, Goddamnit, oh my God, have I got sons! Wade? Rolfe? Elbourne? You love me boys? Do you love your Pop? Of course you do! \nWade, frightened, retreats as Sally enters in her housecoat. \nSALLY Glen, stop -- \nPOP Oh, Jesus, Sally, you are such a Goddamned good person! Capital G. You are so much better than I am, I who am no good at all, you who are a truly good person, like a fucking saint! Beyond fucking com-pare. \nGlen reaches for the Canadian Club; Sally tries to block his hand. Glen pulls his arm from hers, clipping her cheek with the bottle. \nSally gasps, grabs her cheek. \nWade pushes between them, protecting his mother. \nPOP My big boy bursting out of the seams of his jeans! \nPop clenches his fist. Wade vainly looks Rolfe's direction for help. \nSALLY Don't! \nPOP You little prick! \nPop's fist comes crashing down. Wade raises his arms to protect himself. Wade's arm bone CRACKS with the blow. Wade grimaces in pain. \nSALLY Glen, stop! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARGIE FOGG'S HOUSE - DAY \nMargie gets into Wade's idling Ford. \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. WADE'S CAR - DAY \nWade, washed and changed, drives; Marg sits beside him. They head north. Deer rifles echo from the woods. \nMARGIE Did you tell them? (no answer) That we were coming? \nPOP There's a furnace. \nMARGIE You're not using it today? \nPOP It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom. \nMARGIE Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. (Pop nods) Wade, would you do that? \nWade, concerned, pushes open the BEDROOM door: \nWADE Ma? It's Wade. Can I come in? \nHe steps inside. On the bed, Sally Whitehouse, wrapped in blankets, lies dead. He walks over, beside the small electric heater, touches her forehead. Her skin is chalk white. \nWADE Oh, Lord. \nMargie steps into the doorway. Pop joins: \nPOP Coffee's perked. \nMARGIE When did she die? \nPOP Is...? She's dead then? \nWADE Yeah. \nPOP I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater. \nWADE (kneels over mother) Is there something wrong with the phone? \nPOP In the living room. \nWADE Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed? \nPOP Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was. \nPop goes to the dresser, pours himself Canadian Club. Wade opens his mother's mouth, attempts respiration. \nPOP It makes me sad. \nMARGIE Can --? \nPOP (sits) Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROLFE'S CAR - DAY \nROLFE WHITEHOUSE, 38, drives his four-door Toyota west: through Massachusetts, toward New Hampshire. His face bespeaks tolerance, objectivity -- in short, education. It's also Wade's face. \nROLFE (V.O.) Wade called me, as usual, late at night. I knew it was Wade -- no one else calls me at that hour -- and I was ready to listen to another chapter in one of his ongoing sagas. There was the detective story concerning the shooting of Evan Twombley and the family melodrama about Wade's custody fight with Lillian. But not this time. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY \nRolfe's Toyota sits with other cars. \nROLFE (V.O.) Wade was telling a different story, or so it seemed then, one in which I myself was a character. He had called to tell me that sometime the previous night our mother had died, and he had discovered the body when he'd gone over to visit her and our father with Margie Fogg. Pop was okay, but kind of out of it. Worse than usual, maybe, though no drunker than usual. \nCUT TO: \nREV. DOUGHTY This is a difficult time. \nGordon and the couple file out. Doughty, Glen, Rolfe, Wade and Margie remain. \nWADE Listen, it's no big deal, Pop. \nPOP (raising fists) Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head. \nREV. DOUGHTY Give up this demon. \nPOP Go fuck yourself! \nWade, eyes blazing, squares off. Son to father. \nROLFE Wade, just leave it. \nPOP (mocking) Listen to your little brother. 'Wade, just leave it.' Candy-asses. All of you. That's what I've got for children. Candyasses. 'Wade, just leave it.' Praise the Lord! 'Just leave it!' \nWade stiffens. Pop cocks his fist. Marg, screaming, jumps between them as Pop swings. \nThe old man bounces blows off Margie's arms and shoulders. \nWade pushes Marg aside, grabs his father in a bear hug and walks him backwards, flat against the wall. Wade releases him. Pop, frail, collapses to the floor. Wade kneels over him: \nWADE If you ever touch her again, I'll kill you. I swear it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nTownspeople and friends cluster around the gravesite: Pop, LaRiviere, Jack and Hettie, LaCoy, Chub Merritt, Nick, Jimmy, Lillian, Jill and Horner, Rolfe, Wade and Margie. \nROLFE (V.O.) The day of the funeral was almost springlike. The snowline crossed New Hampshire west to east, retreating northward to Concord where it melted by midmorning. \nRev. Doughty finishes. The mourners exchange farewells. Wade looks at Lillian. Margie and Rolfe, escorting Wade's father, let him be. He walks over, hugs Jill. \nJILL Dad. \nWADE (to Lillian) I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while? \nLillian hesitates, shakes her head 'no.' \nWADE You ever come to your father's grave anymore? \nLILLIAN No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far. \nWADE We should talk. \nLILLIAN We've done all our talking, Wade. \nWADE It's just... \nLILLIAN Let the past be. (beat) I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone. \nJILL (tugging at Lillian) Mom. \nLILLIAN She has an ice-skating lesson at four. \nJILL I'm taking ice-skating, Daddy! \nHe kisses Jill, says goodbyes, walks back to Rolfe and Margie. Ahead, LaRiviere walks with Jack. \nWADE So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident. \nROLFE A hunting accident is perfect. \nWADE Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled. \nThe truck sputters, stops. Wade pulls the keys. \nWADE It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off? \nROLFE Not particularly. \nWADE Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right? \nROLFE I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember? \nThe sun is down. Wade tucks the keys in a knotted board. \nROLFE I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after. \nWADE Yeah. \nROLFE I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened. \nWADE Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it? \nROLFE It may have happened, but not the way you said. \nWADE You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that? \nROLFE It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne. \nWADE We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him. \nROLFE And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft. \nWADE (laughs) Well, I never heard that one. \nROLFE I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence. \nWADE (laughs again) That's what you think. \nRolfe looks out: the cobalt sky has turned black. \nROLFE I gotta head back. It's a long drive. \nThey walk toward the house. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LARIVIERE CO. GARAGE - DAY \nWade walks in as Jack and Jimmy prepare to head out, their drilling rig loaded with pipe. Gordon yells at Jack: \nLARIVIERE Put out that fucking cigarette! \nJack opens the truck ashtray. \nLARIVIERE Not there, asshole. Flush it! \nHewitt trudges to the john. \nWade stands in darkness. The only sound his idling truck, the wind. Then a third sound -- the snap of ice. Ice cracks ripple from the middle of the pond. Ice planes tip around the truck. \nLaRiviere's snazzy Dodge slips, descends, disappears. \nHeadlights glow under water, then go out. \"Our Business Is Going In The Hole.\" \nWade, alone in darkness, plops into the water, paddles to shore. Freezing, he finds Jack's tire tracks in the snow. He bangs his jaw. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WICKHAM'S - NIGHT \nA car drops Wade off. \"Home Made Cooking.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. WICKHAM'S - NIGHT \nWade enters the empty diner. His clothes frozen. \nNICK Your father's in back, Wade. Marg had to babysit him. She moved in with you, huh? (looking closer) What happened? \nWade goes to the kitchen. Glen Whitehouse, washing dishes with Margie, looks up: \nPOP Ah, the prodigal son. \nNICK About fucking time. \nPOP Look, got me a new job, second cook and bottle washer! \nMARGIE What happened? \nWADE Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry. \nPOP The fuck you got waylaid. You follow your prick around like it was your nose. \nNICK (enters) Can it, Whitehouse. (to Wade) Get him out of here. It was funny at first, but I'm tired. \nMARGIE There's clothes in the back. \nWade's old man talks as he dresses: \nPOP Let's go home? What home is that? Your home? My home? Let's have a talk about that. You're fucking sly, Wade. Your mother's dead so she can't make any excuses for you anymore! You gotta deal with me! No more sugar tit, asshole. \nWade, redressed, enters: \nWADE Pop, for Christ's sake! \nPOP You think you can take me now? Come on, try. \nMargie and Nick guide pere et fils to MARG'S CAR. Nick speaks to her: \nNICK Marg, get out of this. Fast. \nMARGIE I can't. \nMarg drives off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARGIE'S CAR - NIGHT \nWADE Tell me. \nCHICK Chub says you're fired. \nWADE He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning. \nCHICK He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY \nWade, open phone book in hand, walks back and forth speaking into the receiver. Margie looks up from the KITCHEN table, an old newspaper in front of her. \nWADE What do you mean, you can't take me today? I told you -- \nThe other party has hung up. Margie stands, upset. Wade slams the phone down. \nMARGIE What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way? \nWADE It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it. \nMARGIE I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you? \nWADE Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit. \nPop enters from outside with firewood, passes. \nWADE I'll get another job. People are going to need me. After this is over, they'll make me into a Goddamned hero. You wait: you'll see, I'll deliver. I'll be the best father who ever lived. You need me, even Pop, for Christ's sake, he needs me. This town needs me. Maybe now they think they can send me howling into a corner like a kicked dog, but my God, it'll be different soon. \nMargie's face falls. She retreats from the room as he speaks, taking her coat and pocketbook. Wade and his old man, she thinks: just the same. \nWade looks out the window and she gets in her car, drives off. \nWade holds his inflamed jaw; he can hardly see straight. Pop turns on the TV in the living room, boosts the volume. \nPop comes back in the room, gets the Canadian Club, pours himself a drink. \nWADE Leave the bottle out! \nPop growls, goes back to wrestling on the TV. Wade walks to the cabinet, removes a pair of pliers from the tool drawer, goes toward the bathroom. \nIn the BATHROOM, Wade opens his mouth -- it hurts -- takes a bite of whisky, sets the bottle on the toilet tank. \nHe looks at the stranger in the mirror, reaches inside his mouth with the pliers. Prying his mouth open, Wade Whitehouse locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back, squeezes and pulls. \nHe steadies himself, pulls again, yanking the pliers from his mouth. The bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink. He takes another bite of whisky. \nRolfe's voice plays over: \nROLFE (V.O.) You will say I should have known terrible things were about to happen, and perhaps I should have. But even so, what could I have done by then? Wade never went inside. He lived almost wholly out there on his skin, with no interior space to retreat to, even in a crisis. \nWade takes another swig, sets the whisky bottle in the LIVING ROOM beside the TV set. Wade and Pop exchange looks. \nWade exits through the KITCHEN, snatching his coat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BARN - DAY \nWade spits blood into the snow as he grabs a gallon can of gasoline from under the porch. \nWADE (winking) How about a Big Mac? \nJILL Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you. \nWADE C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say? \nJILL No. \nWADE What do you want, then? \nJILL Nothing. \nWADE You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza? \nJILL Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says -- \nWADE I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though. \nJILL Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want? \nThey stop for a light. Silence. \nWADE Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's. \nJILL (looking ahead) Okay. \nWADE Fine. \nPause. Wade looks over at Jill and realizes she is crying. \nWADE Oh, Jesus, Jill, I'm sorry. What's the matter, honey? \nShe shoves her clenched fists hard against her legs. \nWADE Please don't cry. Please, honey. \nJILL (regains composure) What are you sorry for? \nWADE I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to. \nJILL I want to go home. \nWADE (quick) You can't. \nJill looks away. Wade pulls a six-pack from under the seat, pulls off a beer, takes a swig. \nJILL (quiet) That's illegal, you know. \nWADE I know. \nJILL You're a policeman. \nWADE Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore. \nJILL Oh. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WICKHAM'S - DAY \nWade and Jill enter Wickham's, crowded with out-of-state hunters at the end of the deer season. \nIn his arms Margie feels trapped, overwhelmed by Wade's circumstances and terrible sadness. She pushes: \nMARGIE (crying) Leave me alone! Leave me alone! \nShe struggles in Wade's grasp. Jill, frightened, wildly hits him from behind: \nJILL Leave her alone! Leave her alone! \nWade moves back like a bear, covering his face and arms. Jill, near hysterical, keeps after him, arms and fists flying. \nWade stumbles backwards into the snow. Jill still swings. Margie dashes to intervene as Wade swings his arms wide. \nJill flies into Marg. Her nose is bleeding. Wade's caught her across the mouth and nose. She takes cover behind Margie, crying. \nMargie and Jill stand side by side, saying nothing. Wade looks up stunned, as if hit by a rock. Marg slowly backs away, her arms behind her holding Jill. \nMARGIE (to Jill) Get in. \nMarg eases Jill into the front seat, closes the door, edges around the car slamming the trunk and gets into the driver's seat. Wade stands. \nJILL I want to go home. Will you take me home? \nMARGIE Yes. \nShe closes the front door, starts the car. She backs out the drive. \nIn her rear view mirror she sees the image of Wade receding, standing frozen, staring down at the snow. Pop emerges from the house, looks at his son, grinning. \nWade looks at his old man, that dumb devilish grin plastered on his father's face. Glen Whitehouse holds an empty whiskey bottle like a pistol. \nHunters' gunshots echo in the distance. \nPOP (Satanic delight) You! By Christ, you -- I know you. (points bottle) Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart! \nWADE (dead) You don't know me. You don't know me! (beat) So fuck you. Fuck you. \nPOP Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch! \nPop holds up the bottle, pretends to fire it at Wade. \nWADE Love! What the fuck do you know about love? \nPOP Love! I'm made of love! \nWADE Call it what you want. \nPOP Everything you know is from me. \nWADE Yeah. \nPOP Bang! \nWADE You and me. \nWade waves his old man off, trudges toward the barn. \nPOP Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town! \nWADE Crawl! \nPOP Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen! \n", "test1_input": "WADE It don't look right. \nNICK What? \nWADE The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something. \nNICK Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it. \nWADE I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too. \nNICK This town sucks. \nWADE Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with \"Home Made Cooking\", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong. \nMargie Fogg heads over, sits: \nMARGIE Who needs it? Everybody who comes here has been coming for years so what they need a sign for? \nNick goes back to work. \nMARGIE You okay? \nWADE Yeah. \nMARGIE I'm sorry about what I said. \nWADE Said what? \nMARGIE About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian? \nWADE Forget it. \nMARGIE (touches his arm) I'm sorry. \nWADE I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know? \nWade's eyes well up. \nMARGIE You don't mean that. \nWADE Yeah. I mean that. \nMARGIE (arm around his shoulders) No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you. \nWADE The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her. \nNICK (calls) Marg! \nWADE That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different. \nNICK Marg! You got orders! \nWade and Margie stand. She wants to kiss him. \nMARGIE Call me. \nWADE (genuine) Tonight. Let's get together. \nMARGIE Okay. \nWade meets Nick halfway to the door. \n", "test1_true": "WADE Not since last night. He took a guy hunting. \nNICK The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental. \nWADE (shocked) Jack? \nNICK The other guy. \nWADE Where... how'd you hear that? \nNICK CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow? \nWADE No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting. (suddenly engaged) I gotta go. \nMargie steps over as Wade exits. \nNICK He don't care for you. \nMARGIE Stop being jealous. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LARIVIERE CO. - DAY \nElaine looks up from her desk as Wade pulls the grader into the lot, jumps out, heads for his car. Laviviere stands outside. \nLARIVIERE What's the hurry? \nWADE A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley. \nLARIVIERE Huh? \nWADE I figured you already heard. \nLARIVIERE (urgent) Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck. \nThey head for LaRiviere's blue 4x4 Dodge. \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. LARIVIERE'S PICKUP - DAY \nGordon and Wade drive up the same road Jack took Twombley. Wade fiddles with the CB. No use: static. \nLARIVIERE Fuck. Turn it off. (Wade does) All you heard was there was some kinda accident? \nWADE Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume. \nLARIVIERE Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything? \nWADE You mean Twombley? \nLARIVIERE Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. \nLaRiviere grunts disapproval as Wade slips the butt out his window. \nWADE He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens. \nLARIVIERE I shoulda sent you instead of Jack. \nWADE I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader. \n", "test1_id": 1260, "test2_input": "HAND No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right? \nWADE Yes. \nHAND Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it. \nWADE Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost? \nHAND Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred. \nWADE Oh. \nHAND (sensing situation) You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the -- \nWADE Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter. (Hand nods) I'll send you the five hundred. \nWade stands; Hand motors to the door. Wade puts his fingers in his mouth. His tooth throbs. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LARIVIERE CO. - DAY \nFairlane squad car in its customary spot. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LARIVIERE'S OFFICE - DAY \nWade and Gordon speak. LaRiviere is relaxed, open: a \"new Gordon.\" \nWADE Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again. \nLARIVIERE You ever think of getting a new car, Wade? \nWADE On what you pay me? \nLARIVIERE Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch. \nELAINE (O.S.) What! \nLARIVIERE (to Wade) Use the pickup. I'll bill it to the town. You're the town police officer and the town police officer should have a decent car. You want a new car or not? \nWADE What do I have to do for it? \nLARIVIERE Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little. \nWADE I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning. \nLARIVIERE So? \nWADE He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it. \nLARIVIERE Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me. \nWADE You? Why? \nLARIVIERE Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal. \nWADE That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew. \nLARIVIERE What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there? \n", "test2_true": "LARIVIERE Don't light that in here. I'm allergic. \nWADE I won't. You interested? \nLARIVIERE Maybe. \nWADE You and Mel Gordon? \nLARIVIERE Could be. \nWADE (voice rising) Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right. \nWade pulls out Bic, lights cigarette. \nLARIVIERE (waving arms) Out! Out! \nWade smiles, exits. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RT. 29 - NIGHT \nWade, driving Gordon's 4x4 with running lights and roll bar, takes 29 toward Pop's farm. \nA pickup passes him: Jack Hewitt's burgundy Ford. Wade stops. Jack turns up Parker Mountain -- the road to the accident scene. Something's up. \nWade turns and follows. Jack's fresh tracks lead the way. Hewitt is driving fast. Wade keeps up. \nJack, far ahead, approaches the accident scene. Stops. Night has fallen. \nWade comes over a low rise, spots Jack's pickup. He kills the lights, parks to block Jack's exit. \nSilence. Footsteps in the snow. Wade watches, listens. What's he doing? Looking for evidence? \nThe burgundy pickup engine suddenly ROARS -- Jack's back and at the wheel -- the tires squeal, spit snow as he spins past Wade. \nWade starts his engine, gives pursuit. The pickups gun their engines, bumper to bumper, down mountain roads, lumber roads, rocky trails. Wild headlamps their only guide. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. POND - NIGHT \nA trail turns sharply past a shallow beaver pond -- too sharply for Jack. He crashes through a stand of skinny birches straight out onto the pond. The pickup's momentum carries it across the pond. \nWade drops into first gear, follows, his headlights reflecting ice. He drives directly to Jack, bumper to bumper, headlight to headlight. Jack sticks his head out: \nJACK You crazy sonofabitch! You'll sink us both! Get off the fucking ice! Get off! \nWade doesn't budge. Jack backs away; Wade inches forward. \nHewitt's trapped. Trees behind him. Neither truck has traction on ice. \nJack steps out, swinging his fists wildly. Wade gets out. Jacks grabs his rifle, points it: \nJACK I'll shoot you, Wade, I swear it! I'll fucking shoot you dead if you don't move away from that truck! \nWade backs off. \nJACK Don't move! I'll shoot you dead if you move! \nJack gets back in his pickup, maneuvers it slowly around the Dodge, crosses the ice and is gone. \n", "test2_id": 1261, "test3_input": "CUT TO: \nINT. ALMA PITTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY \nThey step into Alma's living room/office. She's been keeping the town secrets for as long as anyone can remember. \nWADE You got yourself a computer, Alma. \nALMA Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk? \nWADE No. Black. \nThey sit by her desk at the bay window. She studies him. \nALMA Are you alright, Wade? \nWADE Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay. \nALMA Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral. \nWADE Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town. \nALMA Always has been. \nWADE This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. (beat) What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things. \nALMA Who? \nWADE Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him. \nALMA Who? \nWADE You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Let me ask you a question. \nWADE You don't believe me? \nALMA (crosses to her desk) About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately? \nWADE I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in. \nALMA Has anybody offered to buy it? \nWADE As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere. \nAlma punches her computer. Dozens of items flash up. \n", "test3_true": "She punches again: only three items. \nALMA This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh? \nWADE (looking) What is the Northcountry Development Association? \nALMA I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league. \nWADE Twombley involved? \nALMA No. \nWADE He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed. \nALMA All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LARIVIERE'S OFFICE - DAY \nWade storms in, shouting. Jack and Jimmy choose donuts by the file cabinet. LaRiviere's behind his desk. Wade's tooth makes it hard for him to talk without pain: \nWADE You sneaky sonofabitch! I've got your number now, Gordon! All these years I actually thought you were a decent man. (pounds fists on desk) Can you believe that? \nJack, combative, looks at Wade. Gordon stands before Jack can speak: \nLARIVIERE Wade, you're done. (extends hand) Let me have the shop keys. \nWADE (to Jack and Jimmy) You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. (soft) Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that? \nLARIVIERE The key, Wade. \nWADE Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure. (passes key) Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him. (turns to leave) I've got to call my brother. \nWade's phone conversation plays OVER as he goes to Margie's car. \nWADE (O.S.) I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it. \nROLFE (O.S.) For what? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROUTE 29/MERRITT'S - DAY \nPhone conversation continues as Wade drives to Merritt's Shell station. \nWADE (O.S.) To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on? \nROLFE (O.S.) Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this. \nCHICK WARD, 30, Chub Merritt's mechanic, greets Wade outside the station. We join their conversation: \nCHICK The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news -- \nWADE Just tell me when you'll have it fixed. \nCHICK -- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade. \nWADE (beat) Yeah. I know about that. \nCHICK LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch.

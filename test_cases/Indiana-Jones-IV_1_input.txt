INDIANA JONES IV 
INDIANA JONES IV a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Monkey King a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Garden of Life 
A Screenplay by Chris Columbus 
FIRST DRAFT 
UNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling, fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the fly, deciding whether or not to bite. 
CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD. A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT. 
It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake, surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the entire area. 
TITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937. 
Suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face. CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his catch. 
A VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE. 
MACGOWAN (O.S.) Doctor Jones!... Doctor Jones !... 
Indy TURNS to the direction of the sound, still STRUGGLING with the line. 
INDIANA'S POV 
Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny, bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache. MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy. 
MACGOWAN We need your assistance! 
INDIANA (struggling with the fishing line) C'mon, Mac... It's the first bite I've had all week... 
MACGOWAN Please... It's very importantl... 
Indiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back to shore. 
THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER 
NIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING... their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows. 
An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES to MacGowan. 
INDIANA Do you value our friendship, Mac? 
MACGOWAN More than me' nightly pint. 
INDIANA Then this better not be some wild goose chase... 
MACGOWAN T'ain't wild geese we're after, Doctor Jones. You got me' word on that... (sincere) ...and a MacGowan's word is truer than an angel's kiss! 
There is a sudden SCREAM! One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager. 
A CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance, as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock. The villagers WHISPER among themselves. 
YOUNG MAN Scotty Ferguson. 
OLD WOMAN He's the eighth. 
MAN Just like the others...all his bones busted...crushed... 
OLD MAN Whatever's killin' people around here ain't human. 
WOMAN (pointing OFFSCREEN) It's there! Again! 
The woman SHOOTS FORWARD. The police and the townspeople are right BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS. 
The woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE 
AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE. 
An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers, lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small, flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW. 
Indiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to the castle's upstairs window. 
MACGOWAN That light...only burns after a murder's been committed. 
INDIANA (nods, turning toward the castle) Let's go. 
The villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin' in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING himself to be strong. 
MACGOWAN Well... Ahmmmm...that is what we're here for...eh, men?...ah... (points to men) Hennesey... Galbraith... Bottomley... You're comin' with us.

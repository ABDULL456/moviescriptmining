O'Ryan lowers it and slides a SECOND DRAWING over... Speck is speechless, transfixed. Can't look away. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Tell me: those jokes about the traveling salesman and the farmer's daughter - are they true? (MORE) 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) (Speck remains silent) Here. This one's my favorite. 
O'Ryan slides over DRAWING #3. Again, we don't get to see it. And we still haven't seen all of O'Ryan's face. 
But we can see Speck, and his reaction. Utter horror. In fact he recoils so violently that his coffee spills. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Really says it all, wouldn't you agree? 
SPECK You're a... You're sick. 
O'RYAN That's a matter of opinion. 
SPECK You're sick! 
He rises, leaving the drawings behind. We STAY WITH HIM as he crosses the diner - deeply unsettled. He reaches the Manager, (MEL, balding, 50, in no mood) at the register. 
MEL Mmm-hmm? 
SPECK I'm having a problem - with another customer. I'd like you to ask him to leave, please. 
MEL What kind of problem? 
SPECK He's-- 
He turns, to point out O'Ryan. 
...but the booth, suddenly, is empty. The guy has simply disappeared, taking those drawings with him. 
Speck tightens. Mel eyes him, annoyed. 
CUT TO: 
3   EXT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER             3 
Speck hurries out to his Buick, checking over his shoulder repeatedly. Gets to the car, fumbles with his keys. They fall to the asphalt. He grabs them, opens the door. 
CUT TO: 
4   INT. SPECK'S CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER                        4 
Speck guns the Buick. Interstate 35 flies by. The farther he gets away from that Diner, the happier he'll be. 
...until a strange SOUND gets his attention: it's WIND, as if whistling through a ghost town. Hollow, varied - building then falling off again. Wind. 
Trouble is, the windows in this Buick are up. 
Yet there it is again: a thin, hollow GHOST-TOWN WIND, whistling over his shoulder. He's heard it before - in every Western he ever watched as a kid. 
But this wind is coming from his back-seat. 
The blood drains right out of Speck's face. Doesn't know if he should jam on the brakes or drive faster. 
He looks in his rear-view, catches a glimpse of a LATEX GLOVE snapping onto a hand. Dear God: O'Ryan is back there, making that odd Ghost-Town wind sound. Whistling. 
SPECK (sheer terror) What-do-you-want?! What-do-you-want-with- me?! 
No reply. Instead, another gift appears from the back: a FOURTH DRAWING, tossed from the darkness into Speck's lap. 
He looks down, registers the image... and SHRIEKS. 
O'RYAN (O.S.) There's a rest stop, next off-ramp. Pull into it. 
SPECK I have some money. It's not a lot but-- 
O'RYAN Nobody wants your money, Harold. Just pull in. 
SPECK Why?! 
O'Ryan rises into frame now, like Nosferatu... 
O'RYAN Because I don't wanna do this at 70 miles an hour. It could be dangerous. 
Speck finds the off-ramp. His breaths are shallow now. 
SPECK Please, Mister - what do you want from me? 
O'Ryan's face: a knowing grin fans across it... 
CUT TO: 
...the face of VIRGIL RAY STARKEY, on a bulletin board. 
5   INT. F.B.I. RESIDENT AGENCY - WICHITA FALLS - MORNING (SAME       5 DAY) 
We're looking at the F.B.I.'s "Ten Most-Wanted List." Starkey is #7 on it. He's 40, white. His crime are listed as rape, murder, kidnapping. 
THOMAS MACKELWAY stares at Starkey's image. At the eyes... 
Mackelway is 34, bred for success - bred for stardom in fact, a whiz at everything he's ever attempted. 
So what the hell is he doing in Wichita Falls, Texas...? 
EIGHT AGENTS, in cubicles, with a ring of outer offices. Quiet phones, lousy take-out options, hardly a dream gig. 
CHARLTON (O.S.) Got a spot set up for you, Tom.

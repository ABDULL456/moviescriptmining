MARGO Please let me go.  We won't hurt you. 
A strange noise comes out of the monster.  A low, confused growl.  He doesn't loosen his grip on Margo, but he leans down to look at her closer with one green, unblinking eye. 
She struggles not to turn away in revulsion.  His enormous jaws are right near her throat.  Everything is very still.  And then... 
A BARRAGE OF FIRE breaks out!  The S.W.A.T. team is in the doorway, laying down everything they've got.  The creature ROARS as if betrayed, leaves Margo and LEAPS UP.  It barrels down on the S.W.A.T. team, picks up Jennings and SPIKES HIM TO THE GROUND.  Jennings hits the floor with his neck at a crazy angle.  It snaps like a twig.  The other men drop back.  Mbwun follows, tearing through the men, cutting a deathly swath! 
Pendergast moves to help the S.W.A.T. team.  Margo struggles to her feet and her hand touches the wall.  Beside her is a FIRE HOSE in a cabinet!  In a split second Margo hauls it out, throws a switch and gets a BLAST OF WATER.  She turns it on the beast as it grabs for Pendergast.  The force of the water is enormous.  It pushes the monster out the end of the hall. 
Pendergast runs towards her, takes the hose and holds it. 
PENDERGAST Run! 
She takes off blindly in the maze-like room.  From somewhere behind her she hears a horrible HOWL. 
ON MARGO... as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases, tearing blindly in the dark.  Ahead is a door.  She dives through it and finds she's in... 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - MUSEUM - NIGHT 
A row of mirrors and urinals line the wall.  It's a huge room, designed to handle crowds of visitors.  Margo ducks into one of the stalls as MBWUN crashes in.  Margo looks through a crack in the door to see... 
THE ANIMAL AT FULL STOP.  IT'S STARING AT ITSELF IN THE ROW OF MIRRORS! The sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound!  The claws lash out, breaking every mirror in the place, littering the floor with glass! 
Then the beast turns and backs up, groaning, as if cornered.  Margo sees now that one limb is dragging, leaving a trail of blood.  The mouth, too, appears to be bleeding.  The S.W.A.T. team's bullets had an affect. 
Margo presses back in the stall, bracing as the beast gets closer. It's just outside.  It sniffs the air once and suddenly turns, rears up, furious and crashes through the bathroom door.  Margo screams and the thing grabs her!  It holds Margo up before it and roars.  It closes its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for everything.  The claws tighten!  She struggles and fights to no purpose ... but then the beast pauses... it's seen something! 
THE NECKLACE WITH TWO ARROWS AROUND HER NECK! 
It stops and its grip loosens!  A pained look flashes across its bestial face... 
And in that split moment Margo looks down... 
A NECKLACE OF SILVER gleams around the beast's throat too!  The necklace is the twin to her own! 
ON MARGO... Can it be possible?  She stares at the thing... 
MARGO John's necklace!  You killed him! 
Incredibly the beast shakes its head.  A noise comes from it... a sad noise, like a groan.  And now Margo gets it!  She can hardly believe it. Her eyes widen in astonishment.  She whispers... 
MARGO Oh Jesus.  John? 
The name is a knife through the monster's heart! 
MARGO No.  It's not possible! 
The last piece of the puzzle falls.  The monster is John Whittlesley! Margo, still desperately frightened, tries to keep control. 
MARGO John?  If it is you... I can help. 
The monster shakes its head no and releases her.  As she watches he moves away, quickly limps out the door. 
INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT 
Mbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet, headed for the stairs. In the darkness of the hall of Asian Peoples, Pendergast is waiting. He lifts one of the S.W.A.T. team rifles which he holds in his hands. He aims, is about to fire, but then Margo comes up behind him. 
MARGO No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John! 
PENDERGAST What? 
MARGO That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum! 
Pendergast looks over and sees the monster.  His eyes show disbelief. Mbwun looks back at both of them briefly, then it disappears up the stairs. 
PENDERGAST I don't believe it. 
MARGO You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault! 
PENDERGAST Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it! 
Margo tries to stop him, but he shrugs her off. 
EXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT 
A helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the roof.  Ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the hall in a sling.  Waters approaches, holding the walkie talkie.

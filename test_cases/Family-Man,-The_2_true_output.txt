CASH (menacing) Was I talkin' to you?! 
Jack looks at the woman, the college kid, the Santa, then... 
JACK Maybe I'll buy it from you. 
Now Cash walks over to Jack... 
CASH Guy in $2,000 suit gets ass kicked tryin' to be a hero. Film at eleven... (then...turning to the coffee machine) What?!  Oh no, not another lookie-loo.  You know how big a job this is? 
The patrons exchange nervous glances...Jack watches, confused. 
CASH (CONT'D) You're double bookin' me! You're gonna get double billed!  Shit! 
Cash throws a bottle of Perrier against the wall, it SHATTERS.  The woman reels back in terror with the baby... 
JACK Hey, c'mon... 
In a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his pants, aiming it at Jack's face.  The woman SCREAMS, covers her baby. 
CASH (in Jack's face) Do you want to die? 
Jack stares at Cash, trying his best to keep his cool... 
CASH (CONT'D) DO YOU WANNA DIE?! 
JACK No. 
CASH (a smile) Yes you do... 
JACK Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter... (glaring at Sam Wong) ...doesn't have a death wish (back to Cash) ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars. 
Cash gets closer... 
JACK (CONT'D) Like I said, it's a business deal... 
CASH Damn, you are the real thing... 
Cash narrows his eyes...then, a smile as he puts the gun back into his pants... 
CASH (CONT'D) C'mon, Jack, let's get outta here... (to Sam Wong) You were lookin' at me, papa, you shoulda been lookin' at the ticket.  That ticket was legit, B.  You're fake... 
Cash starts out of the deli.  Jack follows... 
21	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MINUTES LATER 
Jack and Cash walking down the street...Jack, holding his carton of egg nog under his arm, counting out two hundred dollars... 
JACK How'd you know my name was Jack? 
CASH I call all you white guys "Jack." 
Jack nods... 
CASH (CONT'D) You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him. 
JACK There's no way I was gonna die in that deli... (off Cash's look) Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately. 
CASH (a big LAUGH) A lucky streak, huh? 
Jack hands him the money. 
CASH (CONT'D) Sound pretty sure of yourself, don't you? 
Jack nods. 
CASH (CONT'D) So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that. 
JACK I don't do that.  That's just not for me... 
Cash looks at him, then smiles. 
CASH Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off... 
JACK Hey... 
Cash turns around. 
JACK (CONT'D) What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret... 
CASH You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person. 
Jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens the carton... 
JACK I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back... 
CASH Yeah, in most cases that'd be true. 
Jack takes a sip of the egg nog. 
JACK I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities... 
CASH (a deep laugh) Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me? 
A look from Jack... 
CASH (CONT'D) Oh man, you're serious... (out to the street) This man thinks I need to be saved! 
JACK Everyone needs something. 
Cash looks at Jack... 
CASH Yeah?  What do you need? 
JACK Me? 
CASH You just said everyone needs something. 
JACK I've got everything I need.

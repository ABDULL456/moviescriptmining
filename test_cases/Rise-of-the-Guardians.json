{"train": "Much of this we hear over the following... \nINT. EGG TUNNEL \nA few EASTER EGGS pop up out of the ground; their little legs carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object. \nSpeeding along through a subterranean tunnel, we can barely keep up with a DIMLY-LIT FIGURE as it races at blinding speed, leaping and zigzagging through a series of TUNNELS -- \nEXT. A SNOWY EXPANSE IN THE NORTH POLE \nA hole opens in the snow, and a pair of rabbit ears pops out. A huge rabbit climbs out and brushes off the snow, annoyed. The six foot tall figure is BUNNYMUND. \nBUNNYMUND Ah, it's freezing. \nHe shivers with cold, then goes slogging through the snow. \nBUNNYMUND (CONT'D) I can't feel my feet! I can't feel my feet! \nIn the distance is North's ornately decorated and dimly lit palace built into the side of a mountain of ice. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 250 - THE CEREMONY \nINT. GLOBE ROOM - NIGHT \nSandy's biplane circles the massive chamber, leaving trails of Dreamsand. \nNORTH (O.S.) Cookies? Eggnog, anyone? \nBUNNYMUND (O.S.) Oh, this better be good, North. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 9. \nTOOTH (O.S.) (to her fairies) Montreal, sector six: ten premolars, eight incisors and twelve canines. Steer clear of the wild goose migration. \nNORTH Sandy, thank you for coming. \nSandy descends from the plane and floats to the ground. He joins North, Bunny and Tooth as they walk through the Globe Room. Sand glyphs appear above Sandy's head communicating that he is busy and has a lot of work to do. \nNORTH (TO SANDY) I know, I know, but I obviously wouldn't have called you all here unless it was serious. \nNorth, Bunny, Tooth and Sandy reach the center of the room. Tooth does her best to shush her mini-fairies. \nNORTH (CONT'D) The Boogie Man was here - at the Pole. \nNorth points to the globe. The other Guardians turn to look. \nTOOTH (SHOCKED) Pitch? Pitch Black? Here?! \nNORTH Yes! There was black sand covering the globe. \nBUNNYMUND (CONFUSED) What, what...what do you mean black sand? \nNORTH And then a shadow! \nBUNNYMUND Hold on, hold on, I thought you said you saw Pitch. \nNORTH Well, ah, not exactly... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 10. \nBUNNYMUND Not exactly? Can you believe this guy? \nBunny turns to Sandy, who shrugs while forming a Dreamsand question mark above his head. \nBUNNYMUND Yeah, you said it, Sandy. \nBunny goes back to painting one of his Easter eggs. \nNORTH Look, he is up to something very bad. I feel it, in my belly. \nBUNNYMUND (his eyes narrow) Hang on, hang on, you mean to say, you summoned me here THREE DAYS BEFORE EASTER - because of your belly? Mate, if I did this to you three days before Christmas-- \nTOOTH (to her fairies) Argentina. Priority alert! A batch of bicuspids in Buenos Aires. \nNORTH Please. Bunny. Easter is not Christmas. \nBUNNYMUND Here we go... \nNorth grabs Bunny's painted egg, casually juggling it in his hand as he walks off. Meanwhile Sandy, who is being served eggnog by a yeti, suddenly notices something high above. \nBUNNYMUND (O.S.) (LAUGHS) North, I, I don't have time for this. I've still got two million eggs to finish up. \nThe moon rises into view, high up in the ceiling; its rays of light begin to shine brightly through as they cascade down the walls of the globe room. \nNORTH (O.S.) No matter how much you paint, is still egg! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 11. \nSandy points to the moon unsuccessfully to get the others' attention. \nBUNNYMUND Look, mate, I'm dealing with perishables. Right. You've got all year to prepare. \nTOOTH (to her fairies) Pittsburg, boy eight, two molars. Saltwater taffy. \nSandy puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle, a silent musical note forming above his head. \nNORTH (TO BUNNY) Why are rabbits always so nervous. \nBUNNYMUND And why are you always such a blowhard! \nTOOTH (O.S.) (to her fairies) Ontario, sector nine: five canines, two molars, and fourteen incisors. Is that all in one house? \nSandy waves a sand flag above his head, pointing and jumping up and down as the moonlight continues to fill the room. \nJack lets go and the wind carries him into the air and through the clouds. Night turns to day as Jack flies from one horizon to the other. \nJACK Woooooohoooooooooo! \nEXT. BURGESS - DAY \nJack falls through the clouds, smiling, toward the town of Burgess. \nJACK SNOOOOOWWWW DAAAAYYYYYY!!! \nJack continues on down and zooms through the streets. Pedestrians clench their jackets and reach for their hats as gusts of wind, snow, and streaks of frost are left in Jack's wake. \nEXT. FROZEN POND \nJack flies in, and with the wind behind him skates across an all too familiar pond. As the wind zips across the pond it knocks a BOOK out of the hands of a little boy walking alone, this is JAMIE. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 16. \nJAMIE Whoa, whoa. \nJamie goes to pick up the book and we get a glimpse of the cover - \"THEY'RE OUT THERE! - MYSTERIES, MYTHICAL CREATURES AND THE UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA.\" Jack flies into frame and lands beside Jamie. \nJACK Huh, that looks interesting. Good book? \nSuddenly twins CLAUDE and CALEB, come barreling past them, rough-housing and laughing as they slam each other into drifts (all the boys are 8). \nCLAUDE AND CALEB Alright! Yeah! Waahoo! Snooow daaaay!!! \nJack calls after the boys... \nJACK You're welcome! \nJAMIE (goes running after them) Hey guys, wait up! Are you guys coming to the egg hunt Sunday? \nCALEB Yeah, free candy! \nCLAUDE I hope we can find the eggs with all this snow! \nCaleb stuffs a handful of snow down his brother's Jacket \nEXT. JAMIE'S BACKYARD - DAY \nThe kids arrive at the fence of Jamie's house. Jamie opens up a secret plank, and heads into his yard. Claude and Caleb are still messing with each other. Meanwhile, Jack walks unseen along the top of the fence. \nCALEB (WALLA) Stop! \nCLAUDE (WALLA) No, you stop! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 17. \nJAMIE Whoa, it says here that they found Big Foot hair samples and DNA, in Michigan. That's like, super close! \nCLAUDE Here we go again. \nJamie arrives at his front gate, sled in hand while SOPHIE (Jamie's 2-year-old sister in fairy wings) sits down on their Greyhound as it lies in the yard. \nJAMIE You saw the video too Claude, he's out there! \nCALEB That's what you said about aliens. \nCLAUDE And the Easter Bunny. \nJAMIE (grabs his sled) Wow, the Easter Bunny is real! \nJACK Oh he's real alright. Real annoying, real grumpy, and really full of himself. \nJack hops off the fence and walks amongst the kids, peering over their shoulders as they play in the yard. \nCLAUDE (LAUGHING) Come on, you guys believe anything. \nSOPHIE (GIGGLES) EASTER BUNNY! HOP-HOP-HOP! (FALLS OVER) Ow! \nSophie begins to cry. \nJAMIE Mom! Sophie fell again! \nJAMIE'S MOM comes outside. Caleb, alongside his brother, stands at the front gate and calls out to Jamie. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 18. \nJAMIE'S MOM You okay, Soph? \nCLAUDE Are we sledding or what? \nJAMIE'S MOM Jamie, hat? We don't want Jack Frost nipping at your nose. \nJamie's mom plunks the hat on his head, tweaks his nose. \nJAMIE Who's Jack Frost? \nJAMIE'S MOM No one, honey. It's just an expression. \nJACK (smile drops - offended) Hey. \nJack jumps down from the fence as the boys head off. \nJACK (MIFFED) Who's Jack Frost? \nJack reaches down and grabs a hand full of snow from off the ground. With his palm open, Jack uses his magic to form the perfect snowball. \nHe then puckers his lips, and blows onto it with his icy breath. The snowball turns a light shade of blue. There's something going on here. \nEXT. SNOWY HILL \nWHOOSH! - the snowball goes flying through the air and - BOOF! - the snowball hits Jamie smack in the back of the head. Jamie looks up, peeved, and turns. \nPEDESTRIAN #1 (O.S.) Is that Jamie Bennett? \nJAMIE Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... \nPEDESTRIAN #2 (O.S.) Hey! Watch it! \nJACK There you go! \nJAMIE No! No! \nPEDESTRIAN #3 (O.S.) Look at that dude! \nJamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the street, almost knocking over a postman. As Jack flies by Jamie's side he sees the look of excitement come into Jamie's face. Jack smiles, knowing he's responsible. \nJack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead, carried by the wind, to divert the ice trail. \nJACK Whoa. \nJamie's sled suddenly turns, narrowly missing the oncoming truck and barrels toward Jack's newly formed ice ramp... \nJAMIE AAAAHHHHHHHH! \nJamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches Jamie over the street, high into the air, and toward the statue of Thaddeus Burgess, colonial settler - 1680. Jamie's friends stand in awe, mouths wide open, as he sails through the air. \nJamie opens his eyes and the look of fear suddenly turns to joy. Jack looks on smiling. \nJamie lands safely in a large mound of snow. Jack jumps onto the Statue of Thaddeus Burgess. \nPIPPA (O.S.) Oh my gosh! \nJACK Yeah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 23. \nJamie's friends all come running to Jamie's aide, scared. But Jamie gets up. \nKIDS (WALLA) Wow, that looks serious! Jamie! Jamie, are you alright? Is he okay? \nJAMIE Whoaaa! Did you guys see that? It was amazing! I slid - I did a jump and I slid under a car\u00ad-ERF!! \nA sofa from the moving van suddenly knocks Jamie down... \nJACK Whoops. \nKIDS (CRINGING) Ooooh! \nThere's a moment of silence as the kids wait to see if Jamie is okay. Then, Jamie rises up from behind the sofa grinning, a new gap in his smile. He holds up a tooth. \nJAMIE Cool! A Tooth! \nKIDS (WALLA) Dude, that means cash! Tooth Fairy cash! I love the Tooth Fairy! \nJACK (his fun cut short) Oh, no... \nKIDS (WALLA) That's totally awesome. You lucky bug! Lucky! \nJACK No! \nJAMIE I gotta put this under my pillow! \nKIDS (WALLA) I wish I lost my tooth. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 24. \nJACK Ah, wait a minute! Come on, hold on, hold on! What about all that fun we just had? That wasn't the Tooth Fairy, that was me! \nKIDS (WALLA) I lost two teeth in one day once - remember that?! What are you gonna spend your money on? What are you gonna buy? How much do you think she's going to leave? \nAs Jack looks down from the statue his frustration grows. Storm clouds overhead rumble and darken. Flurries of snow begin to intensify. \nKIDS (WALLA) Let's go...I'm cooold! My ears are freezing. I can't feel my toes. Ah, it's hot cocoa time. \nJack jumps down from the statue, trying to engage the kids. But it's too late, the kids take off. Jack blocks Jamie's way as the boy comes running at him. \nJACK What's a guy gotta do to get a little attention around here! \nWHOOOSH! Jamie runs through Jack, as if he where a ghost. Jack is left momentarily shaken, then... \nCUPCAKE (walla; mocking her FRIENDS) \"Oh, I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm co- old.\" \nKIDS (O.S.) (WALLA) Somebody take a picture. Hey, stop! That was really awesome. \nThey're gone. Jack is alone again. His temper subsides. \nHe whips up a little wind and disappears. \nCUT TO: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 25. \nSEQ. 700 - NIGHT FALLS IN TOWN \nINT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJamie plays with a TOY ROBOT as DRAWINGS AND CHARTS of mystery creatures hang on the wall behind him: UFO's, aliens, Bigfoot, you name it. There's even a drawing of Jamie flying in midair on his sled. \nJAMIE (O.S.) ...I did this jump and it was amazing and I slide under a car and it was awesome! Then I was flying down this hill and I was like whoosh, whoosh, whoosh through all these cars, and then the sled hit this, this thing, and I was like way up in the air. \nHe mimes flying in the air with his robot, then CRASHING to the bed as Sophie and their dog sit listening-- \nJAMIE -- and then BAM! The sofa hit me, and, and see? (opens mouth, tries to say `my tooth came out!) Ah hoo hay ow! \nWe reveal JAMIE'S MOM in the room. Sophie LAUGHS and tries to stick a finger in the gap in his gums. \nJAMIE'S MOM Alright you, tooth under your pillow? \nBUNNYMUND (CONT'D) But this is about something else. (BEAT) Fellas... \nBefore Jack realizes what's happening a HUGE HAND reaches into frame and lifts him off his feet. \nJACK Hey! \nYETI Durbha wahla. \nJack has been snatched up by two huge YETIS. \nJACK Put me down! What the... \nJack is shoved head first into a sack. A yeti whips out a snow globe, and smashes it on the ground. \nYETI Durtal bardla burdlew. \nA MAGIC PORTAL opens in front of them. The yetis make way for Bunny to leap in, but he demurs -- \nYETI Dwbard urghwetee. \nBUNNYMUND Me? (LAUGHS) Not on your nelly. See you back at the pole. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 30. \nHe STAMPS HIS FOOT twice on the ground which SWIRLS OPEN -- a RABBIT HOLE magically appears. Bunny leaps into it and disappears along with the rabbit hole. In its place, from out of the ground grows a small green plant. \nYETIS Bwardla arghl. \nThe yetis throw Jack through the magic portal. \nJACK Ahhhhhhhhh! \nThe yetis then charge in after and disappear into the portal. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 900 - JACK MEETS GUARDIANS \nINT. NORTH'S LIBRARY - DAY \nTOOTH (O.S.) (to a fairy) Tangiers! Incivie du haut, 421 rue de Barat! Allez! \nThe sack flies out of the portal and lands on the floor. In the darkness, Jack hears -- \nNORTH (O.S.) He's here. \nJack struggles out of the sack to see two elves staring at him. \nTOOTH (to another fairy) Walla Walla, Washington. We've got a trampoline mishap at 1340 Ginger Lane. \nNORTH Quiet. \nHe then looks up to see North and Sandman looking down at him. The Tooth Fairy is surrounded by a dozen hovering tiny fairies who come and go as she blurts out orders. \nT0OTH (CONT'D) Canine, lateral and central incisor. Ouch! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 31. \nNorth clears his throat. They all turn to a bewildered Jack. \nNORTH Hey, there he is! Jack Frost! \nAs North holds out his arms to welcome Jack, a Dreamsand snowflake appears above Sandy's head. \nJACK Wow, you gotta be kidding me. \nTwo Yetis suddenly grab Jack by the shoulders and lift him up onto his feet. \nJACK Hey, hey. Whoa, put me down. \nNORTH I hope the yetis treated you well? \nJACK Oh, yeah. I love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal. \nNORTH Oh, good! That was my idea! You know Bunny, obviously. \nJACK Obviously. \nBunny stands off to the side, grumbling with his arms crossed. Jack suddenly notices the MINI TOOTH FAIRIES hovering near him, staring and twittering. \nNORTH And the Tooth Fairy? \nBefore Jack can answer, she's gliding toward him. \nTOOTH Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot about you. And your teeth. \nJACK My, my what? \nTOOTH (moves in way too close) Open up! Are they really as white as they say? Yes! (GASP) (MORE) Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 32. TOOTH (CONT'D) Oh, they really do sparkle like freshly fallen snow. \nSeveral swooning Mini Teeth flutter around a confused Jack, batting their lashes and screaming like crazed Beatles fans. Tooth collects herself, and... \nTOOTH Girls, pull yourselves together... Let's not disgrace the uniform. \nNORTH And Sandman. (sees Sandy is snoozing) Sandy! Sandy! Wake up! \nSandy bolts up awake and steps up to Jack, smiling. \nJACK Hey! Ho! Anyone wanna tell me why I'm here? \nThe WISP OF DREAMSAND above Sandy's head morphs into a BARRAGE OF IMAGES. \nJACK That's not really helping. But thanks, little man. (TO OTHERS) I musta done something really bad to get you four together. \nNORTH Out of the way! \nThe sleigh heads down a luge-like track. North and Jack are enjoying the ride. \nNORTH Hyah! \nBUNNYMUND Ohhhhhh no! \nNorth cracks the reigns, the sleigh plummets, an almost vertical drop. Sandy grins calmly. Jack loves this. Bunnymund - not so much. \nBUNNYMUND (WALLA) Slow down, slow down! \nNorth pulls a lever, kicking the sleigh into overdrive. He looks back as the sleigh enters a corkscrew. \nNORTH I hope you like the loopty loops! \nBUNNYMUND (NAUSEOUS) I hope you like carrots. \nNORTH Here we go! \nWIDE SHOT as the sleigh reaches the bottom of the ramp, and shoots upwards, launching them into bright blue sky. \nJACK WOOO-HOOOOOO!!!!!! \nEXT. SLEIGH - FLYING THROUGH THE SKY - CONTINUOUS \nNorth, reins in hand, leans into the wind as the reindeer climb higher. \nNORTH Klasno! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 44. \nJack, in his element, leaps up onto the rear of the sleigh to watch the North Pole fade into the distance. \nJACK (LAUGHS) Whoa! \nBunnymund peaks off the side of the sleigh, then leans back, and holds on for dear life. \nJACK Hey, Bunny-- \nBunny turns to see Jack standing on the back edge of the sleigh. \nJACK Check out this view-- EEEYAAAAGGHGHH! \nJack is SWEPT OFF the sleigh and disappears! Bunny gasps in horror and looks over the side...only to see Jack lounging on the sleigh's skid. \nJACK Awww...you do care. \nBUNNYMUND Ah, rack off you bloody show pony! \nBunny glowers as Jack makes his way back into the sleigh. \nNORTH Hold on everyone, I know a shortcut. \nBUNNYMUND Oh strewth, I knew we should have taken the tunnels. \nNorth holds a snow globe up to his face. \nNORTH I say, Tooth Palace. \nAn image of the Tooth Palace appears inside the snowglobe. North throws the globe into the air and a giant vortex opens. \nNORTH Hyah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 45. \nEXT. SKY - SLEIGH JETTING THROUGH THE SKY \nA surreal light surrounds the sleigh as it hits HYPERDRIVE and gets sucked through the snow-globe portal with a WHOOSH. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 1300 - TOOTH PALACE DESTROYED \nEXT. SKY - NEAR TOOTH'S PALACE \nThe sleigh suddenly comes out of HYPERDRIVE at the outskirts of the Tooth Palace. Streaks of black rapidly approaching. \nNORTH What!? \nSuddenly our heroes find themselves in the midst of mayhem, as hundreds of Nightmares and terrified Tooth Fairies jet past. It's like a meteor storm. North yanks the reins, and the sleigh veers sharply, dodging the oncoming Nightmares. \nNORTH What are they!? \nSandy and Bunny duck the onslaught. \nBUNNYMUND Whoa! \nJack now sees that the Nightmares are actually GULPING DOWN the fleeing fairies and flying off with them. It's chaos. \nJACK They're taking the tooth fairies! \nJack looks up to see a lone fairy with a Nightmare snapping at its heels. Jack leaps into the air and rescues it before the Nightmare can snatch it away. \nJack lands back in the sleigh. He opens his hand to reveal Baby Tooth, who's shaking with fear. \nJACK Hey little Baby Tooth, you okay? \nAs Baby Tooth nods, North steers the sleigh forward through the storm toward the entrance of Tooth's Palace. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 46. \nINT. TOOTH PALACE - A MOMENT LATER \nA vast chamber supported by pillars containing millions of tiny wooden deposit boxes from floor to ceiling. North spots a Nightmare up ahead and hands Jack the reigns. \nEXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK \nA parent and her two children, huddled around a campfire, scream as a shadow, resembling Pitch, washes over them. It makes its way up the side of a mountain to reveal Pitch, smiling as he stares up at the moon. \nPITCH (V.O.) (NOSTALGIC) Everyone frightened. Miserable. Such happy times for me. Oh, the power I wielded! \nEXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS \nPITCH (V.O.) But then the Man in the Moon chose you to replace my fear with your wonder and light! \nNorth's sleigh flies in front of the moon. Tooth and her fairies flit by while SANDY's Dreamsand dances across the sky and Bunny leaps across rooftops. \nPITCH (V.O.) Lifting their hearts! And giving them hope! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 50. \nPitch, thinner and weaker than he is now, slips back into the shadows after children run through him while playing in the streets, laughing as they go. \nPITCH (V.O.) Meanwhile, everyone wrote me off as just a bad dream! \"Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of! There's no such thing as the Boogeyman!\" \nBACK TO THE TOOTH PALACE \nPitch leans toward the Guardians, showing nothing but contempt. \nPITCH (CONT'D) Well that's all about to change. \nA SOUND behind Pitch: one of the COLUMNS of the Palace begins to crack and crumble, as if decaying. Tooth is stunned... \nPITCH Oh look, it's happening already. \nJACK What is? \nTooth's eyes widen in shock. \nVIGNETTES OF CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD \nPITCH (V.O.) Children are waking up and realizing the Tooth Fairy never came. \nLifting pillows and finding their BABY TEETH still there. \nPITCH (V.O.) I mean such a little thing, but to a child... \nPULL OUT from the last VIGNETTE, all the way out of TOOTH'S WIDE-OPEN EYE, and BACK TO SCENE. Jack, mystified, moves closer to Tooth as the palace continues to crumble. \nJACK What's going on? \nTOOTH They, they don't believe in me anymore. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 51. \nPITCH Didn't they tell you, Jack? It's great being a Guardian -- but there's a catch. If enough kids stop believing, everything your friends protect - wonder, hopes and dreams - it all goes away. And little by little, so do they. \nJack's realizes now the magnitude of Pitch's plan. \nPITCH No Christmas, or Easter, or little fairies that come in the night. There will be nothing. But fear and darkness and me! It's your turn not to be believed in! \nBunny throws his boomerangs at Pitch, who quickly ducks out of the way as they fly around the chamber columns. Pitch then jumps onto the back of Onyx down into the depths of the Palace. The Guardians dive after him, followed by Jack. \nBunny grabs a set of egg bombs and launches them at Pitch, exploding seconds before Pitch hits the ground. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 1325 - JACK'S DECISION \nINT. TOOTH PALACE - LAGOON - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Guardians land -- \nNORTH He's gone. \nLATER \nTooth, deflated, sits on the ground with an empty tooth box in her hands. Baby Tooth, resting on a nearby broken tooth box, looks to Tooth with concern. Jack walks up and crouches down alongside Tooth. \nBUNNYMUND (O.S.) Okay, alright I admit it, you were right about Pitch. \nNORTH (O.S.) This is one time I wish I was wrong. But he will pay. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 52. \nJACK I'm sorry, about the fairies. \nTOOTH (not her bubbly self) You should've seen them. They put up such a fight. \nJACK Why would Pitch take the teeth? \nTOOTH It's not the teeth he wanted. It's the memories inside them. \nJACK (BEAT) What do you mean? \nTooth leads Jack across the pond, the water freezing under his feet as he walks. \nTOOTH That's why we collect the teeth, Jack. They hold the most important memories of childhood. \nTooth directs him to a MURAL, which illustrates this. \nTOOTH (CONT'D) My fairies and I watch over them and when someone needs to remember what's important, we help them. \nJack takes a second to admire the immense beauty of the mural before him. \nTOOTH (CONT'D) We had everyone's here. Yours too. \nJACK My memories? \nTOOTH From when you were young. Before you became Jack Frost. \nTHOOMP -- she smacks into a TOOTHPASTE BILLBOARD. \nTOOTH Ow! \nJack jumps up to the billboard to check on her. \nJACK Ah, you okay? \nTOOTH Fine...sorry, it's been a really long time since I've been out in the field. \nJACK How long is a long time? \nTOOTH Ah, four hundred forty years...give or take. \nTooth jerks to attention: suddenly her VIEW ZOOMS IN thru a LITTLE GIRL'S BEDROOM WINDOW: a tiny GLOW under her pillow marks a freshly planted TOOTH. \nTooth gasps and her eyes go wide -- she FLIES to the window, excited. Jack reacts, looks to Baby Tooth: it's gonna be a long night. \nJACK Hmm... \nINT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJack, cocksure, arrives outside an open window. His smile suddenly disappears when he sees a RABBIT HOLE open up in the bedroom floor and Bunny hops out. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 57. \nEXT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nBunny, now holding the tooth in his paw, turns to Jack and laughs. Jack, not amused, zaps Bunny with burst of frost from his staff. \nBUNNYMUND (O.S.) Aaahhh! \nEXT. MIDDLE EAST - NIGHT \nThe Guardians fly over a Middle Eastern city in North's sleigh as the full moon lights up the night sky. \nINT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNorth pulls TWO teeth, one with each hand: TWINS. \nNORTH TWINS (BEAT) Yipa!! \nINT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBunny pulls out his hand from under a pillow revealing SEVERAL TEETH. \nBUNNYMUND Jackpot! \nPull out wider to reveal HOCKEY TROPHIES, POSTERS and PARAPHERNALIA EVERYWHERE. Bunny grins. \nBUNNYMUND Looks like you're a bit of a brumby, hey mate. \nINT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNorth stands at the side of a boy's bed. \nNORTH (LAUGHS) Is piece of pie! \nHe falls into a rabbit hole, finding himself face to face with Bunny. He growls. SANDMAN enters and takes the boy's tooth for himself. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 58. \nBUNNYMUND Ow! \nNORTH (LOUD WHISPER) That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy! \nEXT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJack parkours between two buildings and into a window. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nJack flies in through the window when suddenly, a rabbit hole appears. As Jack disappears through the rabbit hole, Bunny appears through an adjacent hole laughing to himself. \nINT. BEDROOM NIGHT \nTooth reaches under a pillow and pulls out a Tooth with a mouse attached to the other end. Baby Tooth tackles the mouse. \nTOOTH Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there, champ! He's one of us! Part of the European division. (to the mouse) Ca va? \nThe mouse gestures back angrily. \nEXT. SKYLINE - NIGHT \nNorth and the Guardians, riding North's sleigh, exit a wormhole. North laughs as they fly over the city. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBunny pulls a note from under a pillow instead of a tooth. \nBUNNYMUND Huh? \nThe note shows an arrow, pointing toward the window. He looks up to the window: North holds up a tooth as he grins, then leaps off the ledge laughing. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 59. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nBunny lands on a rooftop, holding a tooth in his paw, and proud of himself. Then, Bunny hears the sound of ice and FROST-- \nBUNNYMUND Crikey! \n--and disappears from view. Bunny is now sliding down the side of a roof on a sheet of ice. Jack grabs the tooth from Bunny's paw as he slides past and holds it high in the air. \nJACK (LAUGHS) Yes! \nA beat; Jack sees how much it means to her. \nJACK It's a little different up close, huh? \nTooth gives him a look: he's right. \nTOOTH Thanks for being here, Jack. I wish I had known about your memory, I could've helped you. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 63. \nJACK Yeah, well, look let's just get you taken care of. Then it's Pitch's turn, huh? \nA sudden COMMOTION. They both turn to the window. \nNORTH Here you are! \nNorth, carrying a large sack over his shoulder, struggles to climb in through the small window. Sandman and Baby Tooth climb in after. Everybody whispers. \nTOOTH SSHHHHHHHH!! \nNORTH Oh, what gives slowpokes!? \nJamie is still sound asleep. \nNORTH How you feeling, Toothy? \nTOOTH Believed in. \nNORTH (LAUGHS) Haha! That's what I want to hear. \nBUNNYMUND (O.S.) Oh I see how it is... \nBunny comes in through a rabbit hole in the floorboards. \nBUNNYMUND (CONT'D) All working together to make sure the rabbit gets last place. \nNorth now holds his index fingers up to his lips. \nNORTH SSSHHHHHHHHH!!! \nJACK You think I need help to beat a bunny? Check it out, Peter Cottontail. \nJack lifts up his sack of teeth. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 64. \nBUNNYMUND You call that a bag of choppers? (lifting larger sack) Now that's a bag of choppers. \nNORTH Gentlemen! Gentlemen! This is about Tooth. It's not a competition! But if it was -- (reveals even larger sack) I win. YEEEEEHAAAHH! \nAnd he strikes a Russian dancing pose as... \nSuddenly a bright circle of light is cast on the Guardians. \nNORTH (CONT'D) Oh no... \nJAMIE (O.C.) (SURPRISED) Santa Claus? \nThey all turn slowly to see Jamie sitting up in bed, holding a flashlight, wide awake and beaming in disbelief. \nJAMIE (CONT'D) The Easter Bunny?...Sandman...The Tooth Fairy! I knew you'd come! \nTOOTH Surprise! (GIGGLING) We came! \nJACK He can see us? \nJamie looks around, amazed, he sees everyone but Jack. \nBUNNYMUND Most of us. \nTOOTH Shhh! You guys, he's still awake. \nBUNNYMUND Sandy! Knock him out! \nThey all look to him, scandalized. Jamie looks concerned. \nJAMIE Huh? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 65. \nBUNNYMUND With the Dreamsand, ya gumbies. \nBut then Jamie's GREYHOUND rises up into frame, fully awake, its nostrils flaring at the scent he's picked up. \nJAMIE No, stop that's the Easter Bunny. What are you doing, Abbey? Down! \nThe dog is nose to nose with Bunnymund. \nBUNNYMUND Alright, nobody panic. \nJACK (ENJOYING THIS) But that's a um, that's a greyhound. Do you know what greyhounds do to rabbits? \nBUNNYMUND I think it's a pretty safe bet he's never met a rabbit like me - \nWhile Sandy forms a Dreamsand baseball, Jack rolls his eyes and notices an alarm clock on the bedside table. \nBUNNYMUND (CONT'D) Six foot one, nerves of steel, master of tai-chi and the ancient ART OF-- \nJack can't resist: he reaches over stealthily and SETS OFF THE ALARM CLOCK with his staff. RRRRRIIIIING! \nBUNNYMUND Crikey. \nBunny is off like a shot, the greyhound right on his tail, running laps in the small room, the dog barking like crazy. \nJAMIE Stop! Sit! \nThe Nightmare then veers up the wall of the alley and onto a ROOFTOP. Jack whips a blast from his staff and HITS the Nightmare before it disappears from view. \nJACK (JAZZED) HAAAH! I got it! \nJack jumps up onto the roof and prods the frozen Nightmare with his staff. \nJACK Sandy! Sandy, did you see that?!? Look at this thing! \nJack can barely contain his excitement as he calls out to Sandy -- but suddenly Pitch lurches out from behind an air conditioning unit on the rooftop. \nPITCH Frost? \nJack blasts a WAVE OF FROST across the rooftop, but Pitch easily dodges it, reappearing behind Jack on the adjoining rooftop. \nPITCH You know, for a \"neutral party\" you spend an awful lot of time with those weirdos. (BEAT) This isn't your fight, Jack. \nJack's eyes narrow. He holds out his staff, ready to strike. \nJACK You made it my fight when you stole those teeth. \nPitch regards him curiously. \nPITCH Teeth? Why do you care about the teeth? \nWhen he notices something and turns to find Sandy calmly standing on the rooftop next to him. Pitch quickly sidesteps, moving away from Sandy. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 70. \nPITCH (CHUCKLING) Now this is who I'm looking for-- \nBefore Pitch can finish a DREAMSAND STREAM whips around him, forcing him to duck and dodge Sandy's sudden attack. \nPITCH Whoa--?? \nPitch DISPERSES a stream of NIGHTMARE SAND, turning it into a gigantic sickle and swings it back at Sandy. Jack ducks, avoiding injury as Sandy's pushed back against a ledge. \nSandy quickly grabs Pitch with another DREAMSAND STREAM and yanks him off his feet, slamming him repeatedly against the tops of the buildings until finally throwing him off the rooftop. \nPitch bounces off the ground as he crashes into an EMPTY STREET. As Sandy dusts his hands and calmly steps off the rooftop to follow, Jack looks on, astonished. \nJACK Remind me not to get on your bad side. \nEXT. EMPTY STREET - CONTINUOUS \nPitch shakes off the crash, trying to back up as Sandy touches down and moves toward him, Jack following. Pitch cowers on the ground in fear as they approach. \nPITCH (looks up, pleading) Okay, easy! You can't blame me for trying, Sandy. You don't know what it's like to be weak and hated. It was stupid of me to mess with your dreams. So I'll tell you what- \nSandy continues forward, grim faced...but suddenly Pitch stops cowering and stands up. His tone changes. \nPITCH (CONT'D) You can have `em back! \nBefore Jack and Sandy can react, a Nightmare shoots up through a storm drain as several other Nightmares gather in the alley behind him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 71. \nJack and Sandy look around as hundreds of Nightmares descend from the surrounding rooftops to encircle them. This doesn't look good. Jack, worried, looks to Sandy and mutters... \nJACK You take the ones on the left, I'll take the ones on the right? \nMeanwhile, Pitch rises up from off the ground as Onyx takes shape underneath him. \nPitch grabs onto Onyx's mane as it snorts and snarls. He then leans forward. \nPITCH Boo! \nPitch's army of Nightmares begin to charge. Then suddenly, the sound of BELLS and REINDEER echo in the distance-- \nNORTH'S SLEIGH bursts through the clouds. Jack and Pitch look up into the sky as it circles overhead. The sleigh turns toward Pitch, only to fly a few feet over his head. Pitch turns as it passes over him, slightly confused. \nNORTH'S SLEIGH \nNorth's asleep at the wheel, along with Bunny and Tooth. Suddenly, the sleigh clips one of its skis as it flies over City Hall, jolting North to attention. \nNORTH Ah! \nBunny awakes with a fright from a bad a dream. \nBUNNYMUND Get outta my warren! (realizes he's awake now) Huh? \nEXT. EMPTY STREET - CONTINUOUS \nStill battling Nightmares, Sandy propels himself and Jack into the air with a stream of Dreamsand and launches Jack away from the Nightmares. Jack quickly orients himself and knocks an oncoming Nightmare with his staff. \nTooth quickly jumps off the side of the sleigh toward Jack and Sandy. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 72. \nJack, knocks away a few more Nightmares with his staff, and looks up. Tooth suddenly flies into view through the swarm of Nightmares, slicing them apart with her wings, causing them to EXPLODE into BLACK SAND. \nPITCH \nPitch gives a signal and leaps into the air, leading another wave of Nightmares after the Guardians. \nSLEIGH \nBack in the sleigh, Bunny jumps out and lands on a nearby roof. \nBunny quickly tosses his boomerang which disintegrates every Nightmare in its path. Bunny catches the returning boomerang, leaps off the roof, and grabs the skids of the sleigh as it passes by. \nTHE SLEIGH \nNorth stands, drawing both his scimitars, and dices the oncoming Nightmares to bits as they attack. \nNORTH Ha. Ha. Ha. Come on! \nPitch looks on with a smile until a bolt of lightning suddenly erupts from within the writhing black sand. \nJACK \nJACK Ahhhhhh!!!!! \nA gust of wind blows past Pitch, quickly followed by a massive wave of ice and frost that rockets back up the stream of Nightmare sand toward him, culminating in an explosion of ice and snow. \nPITCH AAAHH!!!! \nEXT. BURGESS - NIGHT \nJack free falls back to Earth, unconscious. \nNORTH Jack! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 76. \nTooth quickly rescues him and sets him back down in the sleigh. \nTOOTH Jack, how did you do that? \nJACK (REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS) I, I didn't know I could. \nEXT. BURGESS FOREST - NIGHT \nPitch pulls himself laboriously from the mud and weeds amongst the trees where he's crash-landed, oddly, he seems delighted. \nHe looks up to see a BRIGHT GLOW -- North's SNOWGLOBE PORTAL. The sleigh zooms into it and it WINKS OUT. \nPitch shakes the FROST from his arms as scores of Nightmares swarm behind Pitch, regrouping after the blast. Pitch, at the center, seems as pleased as can be. \nPITCH Finally! Someone who knows how to have a little FUN! \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 1700 - GUARDIANS REGROUP \nINT. NORTH POLE - GLOBE ROOM - DAY \nWe're in the midst of a somber ceremony, marking the passing of Sandy. Burning candles line the perimeter of Sandy's stone emblem. \nTooth sets down a candle and stands shoulder to shoulder with North and Bunny. The three hold hands in solace. \nThe ringing of somber bells can be heard echoing throughout the chamber, as we reveal the elves and a yeti ringing the elf bells as part of a ceremonial dirge. \nINT. NORTH POLE - GLOBE ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nJack, facing a window, FROSTS OVER THE GLASS with his finger to form a symbol of Sandy. North slowly walks up behind him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 77. \nNORTH Are you alright? \nJack remains still, his eyes fixed on the image of Sandy. \nJACK I just, I wish I could've done something. \nNORTH Done something? Jack, you stood up to Pitch. You saved us. \nJACK But Sandy wo-- \nNORTH (putting his hand on JACK'S SHOULDER) Would be proud of what you did. \nJack pulls back his hoodie and stands up. \nNORTH (CONT'D) I don't know who you were in your past life, but in this life you are Guardian. \nJACK But how can I know who I am, until I find out who I was? \nNORTH You will. I feel it, in my belly. \nJack and North approach the globe which is losing lights at an alarming rate. \nTOOTH Look how fast they're going out. \nJACK (GETTING IT) It's fear. He's tipped the balance. \nJack drifts up closer the globe. He looks at the lights going out, then back to the Guardians. There's a nervous tension in the room. \nBUNNYMUND (twirling his boomerang) Hey, buck up ya sad-sacks. Come on! We can still turn this around! (MORE) Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 78. BUNNYMUND (CONT'D) Easter is tomorrow and I need your help. I say we pull out all the stops and we get those little lights flickering again! \nCUT TO: \nINT. NORTH POLE - FACTORY FLOOR - DAY \nA massive wooden door swings open; North leads Jack and the Guardians through the doorway, into an elevator, and through his factory. \nNORTH Bunny is right. (TO BUNNY) As much as it pains me to say old friend, this time Easter is more important than Christmas! \nBUNNYMUND Hey! Did everyone hear that?! \nNORTH We must hurry to the Warren. Everyone, to the sleigh! \nBUNNY Ohh no, mate. My warren my rules. Buckle up. \nBunny directs the groups attention to the ground. He taps his foot and a rabbit hole opens up under their feet. \nNORTH Shostakovich! \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 1775 - PREPARATION FOR EASTER \nBUNNYMUND (V.O.) Heaps of you in every high-rise, farm house and trailer park! \nBaby Tooth flies across the screen, diverting our attention to a multicolored stream off in the distance. \nBUNNYMUND (V.O.) In tennis shoes and cereal bowls! \nBaby Tooth joins an elf, who stands alongside an egg at the edge of a cliff. The elf pushes the egg over the cliff, into the stream, and celebrates with a victory dance. \nBUNNYMUND (V.O.) Oh, there will be bathtubs filled with my beautiful googies! \nThe elf turns just in time to see a stampede of colored eggs come barreling toward him. They knock him off the cliff as he and the eggs spill into the multi-colored stream below. \nA SPARKLING STREAM \nColored eggs wade through the water, emerging with SECONDARY COLORS and intricate PATTERNS of all kinds. \nAn unlucky egg veers off and gets stuck in a WHIRLPOOL. We see a hand fish it out to reveal North, who looks at the egg curiously. It's now got a SPIRAL PATTERN on it and its little LEGS kick madly. \nNORTH Okay, that's little strange. \nBUNNYMUND Naw, mate -- \nBunny's surrounded by butterflies and cute little eggs. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 83. \nBUNNYMUND (CONT'D) That's adorable. \nAs a technicolored elf climbs out of the stream, North sets the egg down and lets it rejoin the herd. \nA GREEN MEADOW \nAs Sophie leads a parade of eggs, Bunny jumps to an adjacent rock and sits up to address the eggs as they walk in stride. Meanwhile, Jack rides atop a group of sentinel egg that are marching in the back ground. \nBUNNYMUND There will be springtime! On every continent! And I'm bringing hope with me! \nA GREEN MEADOW - CONTINUOUS \nCLOSE ON: a line of eggs running down curled vines as yetis sprinkle them with glitter. They continue on down various vine corkscrew-like shoots, decorating the eggs with stripes. \nA confused elf emerges from the vines, striped with paint and walks off. \nA GREEN MEADOW - CONTINUOUS \nThe striped elf walks past a Yeti, painting a mound of eggs red. Bunny enters frame and hops across the screen. \nBUNNYMUND Too Christmas-y, mate, paint `em blue. \nThe Yeti throws its arms up in defeat and tosses the eggs. \nA GREEN MEADOW - MOMENTS LATER \nA beautifully painted egg hides in the grass. \nBUNNYMUND (O.S.) Oh, what's over there? \nSophie appears, spots the egg, and delicately lifts it out of the grass. She holds it close to admire the intricate detail of its shell. Sophie brings the egg to Bunny for him to inspect. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 84. \nBUNNYMUND (CONT'D) That's a beauty! \nBunny takes Sophie by the hand and leads her through a stone archway. \nBUNNYMUND (CONT'D) Now all we gotta do is get him and his little mates through the tunnels, to the top, and we'll have ourselves Easter. \nTHE STREAMS OF COLORED EGGS \nBunny looks out proudly at the eggs gathered in front of the TUNNELS in the distance. \nJack approaches from behind and makes his way alongside Bunny, who holds Sophie in his arms. Its our first real vista of the whole warren. It's a spectacular sight. \nJACK Not bad. \nSophie yawns and begins to fall asleep. Bunny turns to Jack with a smile. \nBUNNYMUND Not bad yourself. \nJACK Look, I'm sorry about that whole, you know, the \"kangaroo\" thing. \nBUNNYMUND It's the accent, isn't it? \nNorth comes up from behind with Tooth at his side. They turn toward Bunny, marveling at the sight of Sophie, fast sleep. It's touching. Bunny's face softens, as if remembering a distant memory. \nBUNNYMUND Ah, poor little ankle-biter. Look at her, all tuckered out. \nTOOTH I love her! \nThey look up from the sleeping toddler toward Jack. He's taught them something today. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 85. \nTOOTH I think it's time to get her home. \nBunny hands the sleeping Sophie over to Tooth. \nJACK How about I take her home? \nTOOTH Jack, no! Pitch is-- \nJACK --no match for this. (twirls his staff) \nBUNNYMUND Which is why we need you here, with us. \nThe Guardians look at Jack with concern. \nJack continues along a shadowed corridor. \nJACK Afraid? \nJack sees Pitch on a bridge across the cavern and heads after him. \nJACK (CONT'D) I'm not afraid of you! \nPITCH Maybe not. But you are afraid of something. \nJack steadily approaches, cautious and alert. \nJACK You think so, huh? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 89. \nPITCH I know so. It's the one thing I always know. \nPitch finally turns to face Jack. \nPITCH (CONT'D) People's greatest fears. Yours is that no one will ever believe in you. \nPanic flashes in Jack's eyes. As he backs away, the chamber fills with shadows, and Jack is spun around. He's disoriented as he thuds into a wall, which flips to reveal that it's actually the ground. \nPitch, unseen now, chuckles. \nJack's unsure of where he is. He looks back to see the cavern entrance -- he's right back where he started. \nPITCH (O.S.) And worst of all, you're afraid you'll never know why. Why you? Why were you chosen...to be like this? \nJack discovers that the entrance has been blocked with bricks as Pitch's shadow encroaches on him. \nPITCH Well fear not, for the answer to that... \nPitch is now directly in front of Jack, holding out a tooth box. \nPITCH (CONT'D) Is right here. \nJack's eyes widen at the sight - the face of a young boy etched into the box, and under it is the name \"Jack Frost.\" \nPITCH Do you want them, Jack? Your memories? \nHe holds them out to Jack. Jack stares, fighting the impulse to grab them. He closes his eyes, struggling to make a decision, but when he opens them again, Pitch has disappeared. \nPitch's shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 90. \nJack heads down a corridor, cast shadows from the Mini Tooth cages everywhere. \nPITCH (O.S.) Everything you wanted to know... \nPitch's face moves in and out of the shadows over the following. \nPITCH ...in this little box. \nEvery time Jack turns, Pitch disappears. It's like Jack's trapped in a fun house. \nMultiple Pitch shadows have appeared on the wall around Jack. They're closing in on him. \nPITCH Why did you end up like this? Unseen. Unable to reach out to anyone. (BEAT) You want the answers so badly. You want to grab them, and fly off with them. But you're afraid of what the Guardians will think. \nJack's breath quickens. He's been pushed into a corner. \nPITCH You're afraid of disappointing them. (SMILES) Well let me ease your mind about one thing. They'll never accept you. Not really. \nThe shadows have overcome Jack. \nJACK (trying to scramble away) Stop it! Stop it! \nAlmost reluctantly, the shadows back away and Pitch appears before Jack. \nPITCH After all, you're not one of them. \nJack aims his staff at Pitch. \nJACK You don't know what I am! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 91. \nPITCH Of course I do. You're Jack Frost. You make a mess wherever you go. Why, you're doing it right now. \nPitch tosses the box to Jack, who instinctively catches it. Jack looks up. Terror comes into Jack's eyes, as he realizes... \nJACK What did you do? \nPITCH More to the point Jack, what did you do? \nPitch begins to back away, becoming one with the darkness, laughing as he disappears. Jack charges towards him only to be swallowed whole by one of Pitch's black holes. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 2200 - GUARDIANS BREAK WITH JACK \nINT. EGG TUNNEL - DAY \nJack flies out of Pitch's shadow, ready to strike. Suddenly, Jack realizes he's forgotten something. \nJACK Baby Tooth! \nHe turns to re-enter the hole in the wall only to find himself face to face with one of Bunny's stone emblems. \nPITCH (O.S.) Happy Easter, Jack. \nJack turns around. Suddenly, his eyes fill with dread as he realizes where he is. Thousands of broken egg shells lay strewn about, forming a path toward the light at the end of the tunnel. \nAND THEN-- \nSTART JACK'S MEMORY \nWe are on an eye, a familiar eye but this one is brown not blue. PULL BACK to reveal young JACK, brown hair, brown eyes. He is staring directly at the camera, a look of...what is it? It's hard to read but it's VERY intense. We keep pulling back to reveal him dressed as we first saw him in 16th century clothes. Behind him, dark winter trees and snow come in to focus. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 102. \nEXT. FROZEN POND - BURGESS - DAY \nJACK (calm, serious) It's okay. It's okay. Don't look down, just look at me. \nJack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two rudimentary ice-skates, leaving him BAREFOOT on the surface of a familiar FROZEN pond. And now we see what he sees, a girl of about FOUR (with an uncanny resemblance to Jamie's sister Sophie) stands in her skates, rooted to the spot. A spider's web of cracks emanates from where she stands. \nJACK'S SISTER Jack, I'm scared. \nCRACCKKK! The ice below her splinters more. She wobbles as it starts to separate. \nJACK I know, I know...but you're gonna be alright. You're not gonna fall in. We're gonna have a little fun instead. \nJACK'S SISTER No we're not! \nJACK Would I trick you? \nJACK'S SISTER (fighting back tears) Yes! You always play tricks! \nJACK (CHUCKLES) Well, alright. Well, not, not this time. I promise. I promise, you're gonna be...you're gonna be fine. \nJack fixes her gaze...holds it...there's nothing but the two of them. \nJACK You have to believe in me. \nJack's sister pauses a moment, then smiles through her fear. \nAnd just like that, Jack's demeanor changes. A light is switched on inside him and the last thing that could be happening is what is actually happening. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 103. \nJACK (CONT'D) (casual, playfully) You wanna play a game? We're going to play Hopscotch! Like we play every day! \nJack's sister looks more reassured. \nJACK (CONT'D) It's as easy as...one...whoaaaa... \nAnd Jack shows his sister the first leap, but mugs for her, almost losing his balance then catching himself. She laughs. \nJACK (CONT'D) Two... (the next jump) Three! \nHe turns toward her with his arms spread out. \nJACK Alright... \nHe reaches down to pick up a familiar-looking stick lying on the ice. He extends it towards her -- \nJACK (CONT'D) Now it's your turn. \nJack's sister looks down. She is trying to gather her courage. Jack, never breaking his gaze with her, \nJACK (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) One... \nShe hops, wobbling, but catching her balance. \nJACK That's it, that's it...two... \nShe's almost there, Jack's staff just beyond her reach. \nJACK Three. \nShe grabs hold of Jack's staff and in one massive effort he slings her with all his might to safety. But the movement propels him into the cracked ice. He looks up to see his sister safe - smiles - and then plunges into the dark cold water. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 104. \nJACK Whoa... \nJACK'S SISTER Jack! \nJack falls back into the icy water. SPLASH! \nUNDERWATER \nWe're looking up at the hole in the ice, descending into the dark icy depths...then THE FULL MOON appears from behind the clouds as Jack's hands claw through the water towards it, but it's helpless. The MOON glows bright...brighter... \nJack's BODY begins to glow, bathed in MOONLIGHT. PUSH IN on his FACE, becoming brighter and brighter until his brown hair turns white and JACK'S BRIGHT BLUE EYES flash open -- \nEXT. MOUNTAIN FISSURE - NIGHT \nThe icy walls rush back in as we pull out from Jack, reeling from the memory. He sees Baby Tooth. \nJACK Did you -- did you see that? \nShe shakes her head `no', tweets `of course not'! \nJACK It -- it was me! I had a family! I had a sister! \nHis excitement suddenly turns to realization. \nJACK I saved her! \nHe looks up at the opening above. The MOON peeks out from behind the clouds. \nJACK (whispers up to Manny) That's why you chose me. (TO HIMSELF) I'm, I'm a Guardian. \nThe Moon seems to shine a little BRIGHTER. Baby Tooth tries to take flight but she sputters and lands back in the palm of Jack's hand. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 105. \nJACK We have to get out of here. \nJamie lets the stuffed animal fall to the floor. Jack comes into the room and watches as the light slowly fades from Jamie's eyes, disbelief setting in. \nJack doesn't know what to do. He takes a moment to concentrate, then enters the room. \nThen, Jamie notices the window as the panes of glass freeze over. The image of an Easter egg suddenly appears... \nJAMIE (seeing the window) Huh? \nJamie looks down at the stuffed rabbit on the floor. He can barely comprehend what he's seeing. Jamie looks back to the window as more of the window panes frost over. Jamie's eyes get huge with amazement. \nJAMIE He's real. \nJack, excited, continues to exert himself trying to bring life to his drawing. And when he does, the frost rabbit comes leaping off of the window. \nJAMIE Whoa... \nThe rabbit hops around Jamie's room, bursting like a snowball over Jamie's head, the snowflakes sprinkling down on him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 109. \nJAMIE Whoa! \nJack is as amazed as Jamie. But Jamie's amazement turns to confusion. \nJAMIE Snow? \nA snowflake lands on the tip of Jamie's nose. The snowflake glows a magic blue. And in that moment a light comes into Jamie's eyes - an idea starts to take hold. \nJAMIE (WHISPER) Jack Frost? \nJACK (a stunned beat) Did he just say--? \nJamie stands up on his bed. \nJAMIE Jack Frost. \nJACK (DISBELIEF) He said it again. He said -- (BEAT) You said... \nJamie turns around and suddenly his eyes go wide... \nJAMIE Jack Frost. \nJACK That's right! But-but that's me! Jack Frost! That's my name! You said my name! \nJamie's mouth drops open. Only then does Jack realize... \nJACK Wait, can you hear me? (JAMIE NODS) Can you... Can you see me? (JAMIE NODS) He sees me. He sees me! \nJack leaps for joy, and the room suddenly explodes with snow. Jamie can't believe it. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 110. \nJAMIE You just made it snow. \nJACK I know! \nJAMIE In my room. \nJACK I know! \nJAMIE You're real? \nJACK Yeah! Who do you think brings you all the blizzards and snow days, and you remember when you went flying on that sled the other day?! \nJAMIE That was you? \nJACK That was me! \nJAMIE Cool! \nJACK Right?! \nJAMIE But what about the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy I mean-- \nJACK Real-real-real! Every one of us is real! \nJAMIE I knew it! \nJamie's mom calls from down the hall... \nJAMIE'S MOM (O.S.) Jamie, who are you talking to? \nJAMIE Um...Jack Frost. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 111. \nJAMIE'S MOM (O.S.) (a little chuckle) ...okay. \nSuddenly, the sound of thunder and North's sleigh as Jack and Jamie look to the open window. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nSEQ. 2800 - JACK AND GUARDIANS REUNITE \nEXT. STREETS OF BURGESS - NIGHT \nNORTH (O.S.) Whoa, whoa, whoa... \nNORTH AND TOOTH arrive on the sleigh completely out of control, and crash land outside Jamie's house. \nThe reindeer are separated from the sleigh and run into the woods. A disheveled Tooth and North emerge from the wreckage. \nNORTH Ah, moi deti! Come back! \nAs North stands, his back suddenly gives out. \nNorth and Tooth trade looks of concern. Then, a menacing chuckle. The Guardians keep a watchful eye as Nightmare shadow streaks across the alley. \nPITCH (V.O.) All this fuss over one little boy. And still he refuses to stop believing. \nA CRACK of Thunder reveals the shadow of an approaching Nightmare as the sounds of hooves clacking against the ground echoes from the opposite end of the alley. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 115. \nPITCH Very well. There are other ways to snuff out a light. \nBulbs start bursting as the arm of a shadow moves across the remaining lights in the alley. Terror in Jamie's eyes. What does that mean? \nBUNNYMUND If you want him, you're gonna have to go through me! \nWith a finger raised, the shadow arm glides along the floor, curling around the back of Bunny. \nPITCH (laughing, genuinely) Look how fluffy you are! Would you like a scratch behind the ears? \nBunny jumps back into North's arms. \nBUNNYMUND Don't you even think about it! \nPitch comes into view, riding atop Onyx. A gleeful smile strewn across his face. \nPITCH I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see you all like this. You look awful. \nThey are weak and defenseless. But still the Guardians gather around Jamie, to shield him from whatever may come. \nJAMIE Jack, I'm scared. \nThere's a sudden moment of realization. Jack has heard these words before. \nJACK'S SISTER (V.O.) Jack, I'm scared. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FROZEN POND - FLASHBACK - DAY \nWe pan up from the ice to find his sister as he saw her in his memory. She is smiling. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 116. \nJACK (V.O.) I know, I know. But you're gonna be alright... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREETS OF BURGESS - NIGHT \nJack, wide eyed. \nJACK We're gonnna have a little fun, instead. (BEAT) That's it. That's my center. \nJamie gives Jack a questioning look. What does Jack have in mind? Pitch gets closer. \nPITCH So what do you think, Jamie? Do you believe in the Boogiema... \nBOOF! A snowball suddenly hits Pitch in the face. Two Nightmares look at each, unsure how to react. Jamie can't help but snicker and North lets out a chuckle. \nJack looks around the alley. He spots a wooden crate, a trash can lid and a discarded wok amidst a pile of trash. \nJACK Now let's go get your friends. \nPitch wipes the snow from his face and looks up to see a track of ice leading out of the alleyway. Jack, Jamie and the Guardians are gone. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. THE STREETS AND ROOFTOPS OF BURGESS - NIGHT \nAn aerial view of Burgess. The streets are empty and the city is quiet. Suddenly a streak of blue begins to materialize, making its way through the tranquil suburb. \nA man walks his dog across an empty street when suddenly a cold wind blows behind him. Jack and Jamie come flying past, leaving a trail of ice in their wake. And on that ice - the Guardians careen along in make-shift sleds. They are scared and thrilled, but they're having fun. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 117. \nJACK Yeah! Come on! \nJAMIE Whoa! Cool! \nINT. CUPCAKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER \nA terrified Cupcake lies in bed awake. The Guardians' reflections streak across the window when suddenly, BOOF! A snowball strikes the pane of glass. \nCupcake pulls the covers down to find that it's suddenly SNOWING inside! As the snow circles around Cupcake's head, she sits up and smiles. \nEXT. PIPPA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nPippa sits in bed amazed as it snows in her room. She hears a KNOCK at her window and moves toward it to find Jamie floating outside. \nShe throws open her window and looks down to the ground to reveal that they are two stories up. \nPIPPA Jamie, how are you doing that?! \nJAMIE Jack Frost! Come on, we need your help! \nJamie takes off flying down the street, and as a snowflake lands on her nose she suddenly sees him. \nPIPPA Hey is, is that? \nMONTY (O.S.)

Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 122. \nBUNNYMUND (CONT'D) G'day, mate! \nBunny kicks the Nightmare, flips into the air, and throws his boomerangs which slice through two more Nightmares, turning them to dust. \nBunny drums his feet on the ground and an army of sentinel eggs suddenly rise up out of the earth.

Wooooohoooo! \nElves riding toy ducks and planes come flying in overhead like bombardiers, turning Nightmares into puffs of black sand as they fly through them. \nThe kids look to see a Nightmare charging toward them, only to stop in it's tracks once the kids turn to face it. \nCUPCAKE Let's get `em! \nKIDS Aaaaaahhhhhh! \nThe kids, accompanied by two elves in a bike and side car, charge an incoming Nightmare.

Bring it on! \nSandy salutes Jack and North, who are standing off to the side while the snowball fight escalates. \nNORTH Your center? \nJACK It took awhile, but I figured it out. \nNorth tosses Jack a small item. Jack catches it and looks to his open palm, it's a Russian nesting doll in the image of Jack, similar to those found in North's workshop. Jack smiles and North gives him a wink in return. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 128. \nBOOF! North is suddenly hit by a snowball and turns. He sees Claude, Caleb, and an elf; they immediately point fingers at each other. \nCALEB AND CLAUDE Ooohhh. \nA beat, until North bursts out in laughter. \nNORTH (LAUGHING) You're all on naughty list. (TO BUNNY) Bunny, think fast! \nHe throws a snowball, which hits Bunny smack in the face. \nPitch groans in pain, and rises up to see the town crawling with Dreamsand creatures, snowballs flying and yetis playing. \nPITCH (TO HIMSELF) No. \nHe whips around to see the kids - having the time of their lives - and no fear in their eyes.

He looks over his shoulder to see if the Guardians are on his tail, when BOOM! He runs smack into North's chest. \nPitch slips on the ice, and falls backwards. He looks up to see North smiling down at him. \nNORTH Leaving the party so soon? \nTOOTH You didn't even say goodbye. \nTooth tosses something to Pitch which he catches. He looks down. It's a quarter. \nPITCH A quarter? \nBLAM. A fist punches him right in the jaw, and a single tooth goes skittering across the ice. Tooth shakes out her hand. \nTOOTH And that's for my fairies. \nPITCH (SCOWLS) You can't get rid of me! Not forever! There will always be fear! \nNORTH So what? As long as one child believes, we will be here to fight fear! \nPITCH Really? Then what are they doing here? \nHundreds of Nightmares emerge from the woods, surrounding the pond. It's terrifying, but the Guardians seem unphased. \nNORTH They can't be my Nightmares, I'm not afraid. \nJACK Looks like it's your fear they smell. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 130. \nSuddenly, Pitch's eyes get huge with terror as the Nightmares move in on him. He begins to back away, but the Nightmares pick up speed as they charge toward him. \nPITCH Ahhh, no....AAAAAHHHHHH!! \nHe tries to run, but it's impossible to get his footing on the ice. He falters, and is swept up in the stampede of Nightmares. The streaks of black whip and latch themselves onto Pitch as the black cloud carries him through the forest. \nPITCH (CONT'D) No, no, nooooooo! \nPitch struggles to escape, but the mass of black sand pulls him deep into the forest, under the frame of the broken bed, and back down into the dark depths of the underground.

It can't be, but -- is that the barest hint of a FACE on the Moon? Jack smiles as he looks up at it. He hears Tooth's laugh and turns to find North, Tooth, Bunny and Sandy, their faces shining with pride. \nTooth comes flying in to give Jack a hug. She lifts him off the ground as they embrace. They share a moment and she soon recoils with giddy embarrassment as Baby Tooth interjects. \nJack acknowledges Baby Tooth and gently pats her on the side of her face as North steps forward. \nNORTH Are you ready now, Jack? (BEAT) To make it official. \nJack looks over, a stern elf is hitting a horn against his palm. A Yeti hands North the book we saw when Jack and the Guardians first met. Sandy and Bunny share a boastful look. \nNORTH (CONT'D) Then is time you take Oath.

FROZEN POND - NIGHT \nSnow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his tousled hair frosted white. \nJACK (V.O.) But then...then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright, and it seemed to chase the darkness away. And when it did...I wasn't scared anymore. \nJack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up underneath him. JACK (V.O.) Why I was there, and what I was meant to do - that I've never known. And a part of me wonders if I ever will. \nJack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight as it dims a bit. \nJack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2. \nJack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across the ice. Jack is visibly confused. \nHe touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as he begins to run across the frozen pond. \nAnother swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance. \nEXT. BURGESS SETTLEMENT - TOWN CENTER - CONTINUOUS \nA collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs. Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands up, still elated, and brushes himself off. \nAs Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone. \nJACK (to the townsfolk) Hello. Hello. Good evening, ma'am. (BEAT) Ma'am? \nThe settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him. \nJACK Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me where I am? \nThe boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow. \nJACK Hello! Hello! \nTownsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest. \nJACK (V.O.) My name is Jack Frost -- how do I know that? The moon told me so. But that was all he ever told me. And that was a long, long time ago.

North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo on his arm, the word NAUGHTY clearly visible. \nThree ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies, each licking their own tasty morsel. \nNORTH (O.S.) Still waiting for cookies! \nAs North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear. \nThe elves duck out of the way as North launches himself across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music, delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible-- \nHis INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice-- \nHis hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the track, picking up speed-- \nNORTH Yes! \nNorth's hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two Elves. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 4. \nOne of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out onto the plate. \nNORTH Ah, finally! \nHe takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. He chuckles as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair -- then WINGS unfold -- JET ENGINES sprout and ignite and the train lifts off the track-- \nSuddenly, the DOOR is thrown open by one of North's concerned YETIS, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the floor in pieces. \nYETI Arghbal... \n", "test1_true": "The yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame.

It quickly disappears, leaving nothing but the distant ECHO of...LAUGHTER? \nNorth is frozen, looking up into the darkness, gravely: \nNORTH Can it be?

Tooth whips around, and we finally see her beautiful FACE. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 7. \nShe's holding up a little tooth, and gazing at it with dreamy adoration.

(GASPS) Look how she flossed! \nThe fairies' tweets turn to concern, turning Tooth's attention to North's AURORA SIGNAL stretching across the sky. She gasps, and flies off like a rocket toward the source of the signal, accompanied by a few of her ranking fairies. \nNORTH (V.O.)

Keep up! \nNorth charges ahead. \nNorth's factory is bustling with activity: Yeti's are building toys, moving packages, while Elves are test piloting the various flying toys. \nAs Jack walks behind North, surveying the factory, a duck toy suddenly flies over Jack's head. Jack ducks just in time and continues after North. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 38. \nJACK Whoa!

Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 97. \nJack whips around and shoots a burst of frost at Pitch, but it's quickly deflected by the Nightmare sand. \nJACK You don't understand anything! \nJack continues to attack, lashing out with his staff. Pitch blocks the attacks of ice and frost -- his control over the Nightmare sand has gained considerable strength. \nPITCH (SHOUTING) No? I don't know what it's like to be cast out? \nPitch strikes back, putting Jack on the defense. Jack jumps in the air. Their show of force escalates until they're shrouded in a blanket of snow, ice, and wind. As the wind and snow settle, Jack looks around stern and alert. \nPITCH (O.S.)(CONT'D) To not be believed in. To long for a family. \nJack turns around to find Pitch. There's a look of compassion on Jack's face as he listens. \nPITCH (CONT'D) All those years in the shadows I thought, no one else knows what this feels like. But now I see I was wrong. \nThey lock eyes. A moment of true connection between them. \nPITCH (CONT'D) We don't have to be alone, Jack. \nThis isn't a trick Pitch is making a real offer here. \nPITCH (CONT'D) I believe in you. And I know children will too. \nJACK In me? \nPITCH Yes! Look at what we can do! \nPitch gestures to a fantastical ice and nightmare \"sculpture\" that was created (off-screen) when Jack attacked him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 98. \nPITCH (CONT'D) What goes together better than cold and dark? \nJack looks at the fractured reflections of themselves cast in the icy sculpture. \nPITCH (CONT'D) We can make them believe. We'll give them a world where everything, everything is... \nJack turns to face Pitch. \nJACK (DEADPANS) Pitch black... \nPitch, realizing how this looks, clarifies... \nPITCH And Jack Frost too. They'll believe in both of us. \nJack stares at him, considering the offer. Then finally... \nJACK No, they'll fear both of us. And that's not what I want. \n", "test3_true": "JACK (CONT'D) Now for the last time, leave me alone. \nPitch looks confused and hurt. This is not the response he was expecting. Then...his eyes flame with anger. He made himself vulnerable, and Jack rejected him. No more negotiating now. \nPITCH Very well. You want to be left alone? Done. But first... \nSuddenly Jack hears a familiar twitter. Pitch reaches into his coat to pull out... \nJACK Baby Tooth! \nJack charges forward. There's terror in Baby Tooth's eyes. She squeaks as Pitch clenches her tight with his fist. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 99. \nPITCH The staff, Jack. \nJack settles and the winds and snow subsides. \nPITCH (CONT'D) You have a bad habit of interfering. Now hand it over. (BEAT) And I'll let her go. \nBABY TOOTH (twitters - Don't give it to him!) \nBaby Tooth struggles to get loose, but Pitch only tightens his grip. She can hardly breathe. Jack has no choice. Jack...hands over...the staff. \nPitch twirls the staff. \nJACK (re: Baby Tooth) Alright, now let her go. \nPITCH No. You said you wanted to be alone. (BEAT) So be alone! \nBaby Tooth squirms until she's finally able to peck Pitch in the hand with her beak. Pitch shrieks and throws Baby Tooth in the air and down into the mouth of a crevasse. \nJACK No! \nJack, enraged, can't believe what he's seeing. Pitch lifts the staff, and breaks it over his knee, cracking it in two. Light EXPLODES from the staff and terror comes into Jack's eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain. \nSuddenly, Pitch sends a burst of Nightmare sand, blasting Jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him. As the ice cracks, Jack comes loose and falls forward into the chasm below. \nPitch looks down into the ice fissure chuckling. He throws the broken shards of Jack's staff down into the crevasse and casually walks away, disappearing on the horizon. \nCUT TO: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 100. \nSEQ. 2308 - JACK'S MEMORY \nEXT. ICE FISSURE - NIGHT \nIt's cold and dark down here, and Jack is more alone than he's ever been. Battered from the fall, Jack slowly looks up and notices Baby Tooth, lying lifelessly on the ground. \nJACK Baby Tooth! \nHe pulls himself to her and cradles her in his hands. \nJACK You alright? \nBaby Tooth nods, but she's hurt, and cold. Jack does his best to shield her from the cold. \nJACK Sorry, all I can do is keep you cold. \nJack sits up and holds Baby Tooth in his hands. \nJACK Pitch was right - I make a mess of everything. \nJack is devastated. Baby Tooth's never seen him like this; it's heart breaking...then she gets a thought. Her expression hardens with determination. \nShe wriggles deep into his pocket. \nJACK Hey? \nJack leans back and begins to close his eyes when he hears SOMETHING -- \nVOICE FROM A MEMORY Jack... Jack... \n-- and then he FEELS something. Looks down: There's a SOFT, GOLDEN GLOW coming from his pocket. \nJack jumps, taken aback. He reaches in and pulls out the TOOTH BOX -- it's pulsing with light. \nVOICE FROM A MEMORY Jack... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 101. \nBaby Tooth gives him a reassuring look. \nBaby Tooth motions to the box, then looks back at Jack. Jack reaches to touch the box, but as he does its top magically UNFOLDS to reveal a handful of BABY TEETH - then the box and everything else glows BRIGHT WITH INTENSE LIGHT - \nThe WALLS of the fissure seem to suddenly fall away. In brief FLASHES we see: The COLONIAL SETTLEMENT Jack visited. Children running playfully down a hill. \nJACK'S MOTHER Come on Jack, you can't have fun all the time. \nCHILDREN'S LAUGHING FACES as a familiar BOY hangs upside down from a tree limb. \nJACK'S SISTER Jack, get down from there! \nA HAPPY FAMILY at a roaring fire as the same boy jokes around with antlers on his head. \nCOLONIAL BOY (O.S.) You're funny, Jack. \nJack walks toward the woods with his sister. His mother, face unseen, calls out to him. \nJACK'S MOTHER Be careful. \nJack shakes his head like he's heard it a million times but never pays it any mind. \nJACK (LAUGHING) We will. \n", "test3_id": 1805}

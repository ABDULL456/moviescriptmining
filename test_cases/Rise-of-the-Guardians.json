FROZEN POND \nJack flies in, and with the wind behind him skates across an all too familiar pond. As the wind zips across the pond it knocks a BOOK out of the hands of a little boy walking alone, this is JAMIE. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 16. \nJAMIE Whoa, whoa. \nJamie goes to pick up the book and we get a glimpse of the cover - \"THEY'RE OUT THERE! - MYSTERIES, MYTHICAL CREATURES AND THE UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA.\" Jack flies into frame and lands beside Jamie. \nJACK Huh, that looks interesting. Good book? \nSuddenly twins CLAUDE and CALEB, come barreling past them, rough-housing and laughing as they slam each other into drifts (all the boys are 8). \nCLAUDE AND CALEB Alright! Yeah! Waahoo! Snooow daaaay!!! \nJack calls after the boys... \nJACK You're welcome! \nJAMIE (goes running after them) Hey guys, wait up! Are you guys coming to the egg hunt Sunday? \nCALEB Yeah, free candy! \nCLAUDE I hope we can find the eggs with all this snow! \nCaleb stuffs a handful of snow down his brother's Jacket \nEXT. JAMIE'S BACKYARD - DAY \nThe kids arrive at the fence of Jamie's house. Jamie opens up a secret plank, and heads into his yard. Claude and Caleb are still messing with each other. Meanwhile, Jack walks unseen along the top of the fence. \nCALEB (WALLA) Stop! \nCLAUDE (WALLA) No, you stop! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 17. \nJAMIE Whoa, it says here that they found Big Foot hair samples and DNA, in Michigan. That's like, super close! \nCLAUDE Here we go again. \nJamie arrives at his front gate, sled in hand while SOPHIE (Jamie's 2-year-old sister in fairy wings) sits down on their Greyhound as it lies in the yard. \nJAMIE You saw the video too Claude, he's out there! \nCALEB That's what you said about aliens. \nCLAUDE And the Easter Bunny. \nJAMIE (grabs his sled) Wow, the Easter Bunny is real! \nJACK Oh he's real alright. Real annoying, real grumpy, and really full of himself. \nJack hops off the fence and walks amongst the kids, peering over their shoulders as they play in the yard. \nCLAUDE (LAUGHING) Come on, you guys believe anything. \nSOPHIE (GIGGLES) EASTER BUNNY! HOP-HOP-HOP! (FALLS OVER) Ow! \nSophie begins to cry. \nJAMIE Mom! Sophie fell again! \nJAMIE'S MOM comes outside. Caleb, alongside his brother, stands at the front gate and calls out to Jamie.

It's just an expression. \nJACK (smile drops - offended) Hey. \nJack jumps down from the fence as the boys head off. \nJACK (MIFFED) Who's Jack Frost? \nJack reaches down and grabs a hand full of snow from off the ground. With his palm open, Jack uses his magic to form the perfect snowball. \nHe then puckers his lips, and blows onto it with his icy breath. The snowball turns a light shade of blue. There's something going on here. \nEXT. SNOWY HILL \nWHOOSH! - the snowball goes flying through the air and - BOOF! - the snowball hits Jamie smack in the back of the head.

His eyes land on a couple kids making snow barricades. \nMONTY (oddball with big glasses) with his back turned suddenly gets a snowball to the back of the head, knocking him face first into the ground. \nMONTY Ow! \nPIPPA (brainy, pigtails, pink hat) steps forward and - BOOF! A magical snowball from Jack hits her, knocking her back. Pippa's face changes - a mischievous sparkle. \nPIPPA Jamie Bennett! No fair! \nJAMIE (LAUGHS) You struck first! \nCLAUDE Oh! \nSuddenly we see Caleb struck in the side of the head with one of Jack's snowballs; Claude can't help but laugh. \nJACK Free for all! \nAnd just like that we find ourselves in a take-no-prisoners snowball fight, the kids pummeling each other mercilessly. \nJACK Alright, who needs ammo? \nJack supplies the kids with more snowballs. The kids are loving this. \nJACK (WALLA) Look at that. \nThe mayhem continues as Jamie, using his sled as a shield, is knocked backward into a snowman, crushing it underneath him. A snowball flies overhead and hits CUPCAKE, a tough third grader as wide as she is tall, in the back of the head. \nDread sets in amongst the other kids, Cupcake squints - gunslinger eyes. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 20. \nCUPCAKE Grrrrrrrrrrrr... \nPIPPA Crud, I hit Cupcake. \nMONTY She hit Cupcake. \nCLAUDE You hit Cupcake? \nJamie is flat on his back, terrified. He looks up to see Cupcake standing over him. Then, BOOF! Jack hits Cupcake with a magical snowball. The kids gasp in horror. \nCLAUDE Oh! \nCALEB Did you throw that? \nMONTY No. \nPIPPA Wasn't me. \nA moment, and then Cupcake starts laughing as Jack's magic takes hold. \nCupcake chases the kids down the hill, holding the head of her snowman in her hands. Jack, all the while, runs along side taking pleasure in the excitement. \nJAMIE (WALLA) Hey, come on. Stop! \nCLAUDE (WALLA) You can't catch me. \nJACK Ooh, little slippery! \nJack jumps ahead, blasting a sheet of ice behind him. The kids fall to the ground, except for Jamie, who lands on his sled, and slides head first down the sheet of ice into town. \nJAMIE Whooaaooah!!!

There's traffic! \nJamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past a set of parked cars. \nJack's path of ice covers the street. As Jamie turns, his speed only escalates, sending him directly into traffic. Jamie barely misses a moving truck, spinning it out of control, sending furniture out the back, and causing a four car pile up. \nJAMIE Whoa! \nJACK Whoa, don't worry kid, I gotcha. \nJamie looks back, then quickly ahead as terror comes into his eyes. Jack can't help but smile. \nJACK Hold on. It's gonna be alright. \nJAMIE Ahhhh. No, no, no, no... \nJACK Keep up with me kid! Take a left. \nJamie rockets through a pedestrian intersection, narrowly missing those in the crosswalk. \nDOG WALKER (O.S.) Hey, slow down! \nJAMIE Whoa, no, no, no, no... \nJack flies over to the far side of the street, sending the streak of ice and Jamie up onto the sidewalk.

Meanwhile, everyone wrote me off as just a bad dream! \"Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of!

If enough kids stop believing, everything your friends protect - wonder, hopes and dreams - it all goes away. And little by little, so do they. \nJack's realizes now the magnitude of Pitch's plan. \nPITCH No Christmas, or Easter, or little fairies that come in the night. There will be nothing. But fear and darkness and me! It's your turn not to be believed in! \nBunny throws his boomerangs at Pitch, who quickly ducks out of the way as they fly around the chamber columns. Pitch then jumps onto the back of Onyx down into the depths of the Palace.

It's the memories inside them. \nJACK (BEAT) What do you mean? \nTooth leads Jack across the pond, the water freezing under his feet as he walks. \nTOOTH That's why we collect the teeth, Jack. They hold the most important memories of childhood. \nTooth directs him to a MURAL, which illustrates this. \nTOOTH (CONT'D) My fairies and I watch over them and when someone needs to remember what's important, we help them. \nJack takes a second to admire the immense beauty of the mural before him. \nTOOTH (CONT'D) We had everyone's here.

Oh, there will be bathtubs filled with my beautiful googies! \nThe elf turns just in time to see a stampede of colored eggs come barreling toward him. They knock him off the cliff as he and the eggs spill into the multi-colored stream below. \nA SPARKLING STREAM \nColored eggs wade through the water, emerging with SECONDARY COLORS and intricate PATTERNS of all kinds. \nAn unlucky egg veers off and gets stuck in a WHIRLPOOL. We see a hand fish it out to reveal North, who looks at the egg curiously. It's now got a SPIRAL PATTERN on it and its little LEGS kick madly. \nNORTH Okay, that's little strange. \nBUNNYMUND Naw, mate -- \nBunny's surrounded by butterflies and cute little eggs.

Jack scans the forest when again he hears... \nVOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.) Jack... \nJack gives chase. He sprints through the thickets and enters a clearing only to find the decrepit remains of a rotting frame from a child's bed. Very creepy. What would that be doing in the woods, and how long has it been here? \nJACK Don't worry, there's still time.

Mounds of them heaped to the ceiling. And inside the drawers are the missing baby teeth. He drops down to a mound and begins rummaging through the drawers, looking at the names on the boxes. \nIn an instant he forgets his duties, and the fairies, and the Guardians and everything except those teeth, and the chance to finally get his memory back. \nThe cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was. Jack finally looks up, as a shadow of Pitch crawls up a nearby column. \nPITCH (O.S.) Looking for something? \nJack swings around with his staff, shooting off a blast of ice, but Pitch isn't there. Jack takes off, following the sound of Pitch's cackle as it echoes throughout the chamber. \nJack rounds a corner as he sees Pitch's shadow glide across the walls into a shadowed corridor. \nPITCH (O.S.)

RICKY (CONT'D) I got that homeless woman on video. 
JANE Why would you film that? 
RICKY Because it was amazing. 
JANE What was amazing about it? 
A beat. 
RICKY When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back. 
JANE And what do you see? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
RICKY Beauty. 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space as if hypnotized. Behind her, Ricky enters, followed by Jane. 
RICKY Mom, I want you to meet somebody. (no response) Mom. 
Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly. 
BARBARA (pleasant) Yes? 
RICKY I want you to meet somebody. This is Jane. 
JANE Hi. 
BARBARA Oh, my. I apologize for the way things look around here. 
Jane glances around. The room is spotless. 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - THE COLONEL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 
We HEAR KEYS TURNING in the lock, then the door opens and Ricky enters, holding a RING OF KEYS, followed by Jane. 
RICKY This is where my dad hides out. 
GLASS CASES filled with GUNS line the walls. 
JANE I take it he's got a thing for guns. 
Ricky crosses to a built-in CABINET behind the desk. 
RICKY You got to see this one thing... 
He unlocks the cabinet and opens it, revealing shelves stacked with WAR MEMORABILIA. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RICKY (CONT'D) My dad would kill me if he knew I was in here. 
JANE Did you steal his keys? 
RICKY No. One of my clients is a locksmith. He was short on cash one night, so I let him pay me in trade. 
He reaches into the cabinet and carefully removes an oval CHINA PLATTER, which he hands to Jane. She examines it. 
RICKY (CONT'D) Turn it over. 
CLOSE on the bottom of the plate: A small SWASTIKA is imprinted in the center. 
JANE Oh my God. 
RICKY It's like official state china of the Third Reich. There's a whole subculture of people who collect this Nazi shit. But my dad just has this one thing. 
He puts the platter back into the cabinet and shuts the door, then notices Jane looking at him oddly. 
RICKY (CONT'D) What's wrong? 
JANE Nothing.

Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the bridge. 
REIBEN Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain. 
MILLER ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN. 
A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back. 
VOICE FROM BRIDGE KISS MY ASS, FRITZ. 
MILLER YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN THAT. 
VOICE FROM BRIDGE WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME? 
Miller turns to his men.  They all come up empty. 
MILLER I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME. (to his men) Cover me. 
REIBEN What if our guys open up, sir? 
MILLER You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules. 
REIBEN Have it your way, Captain. 
Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward the bridge. 
THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP 
Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller. 
MILLER'S MEN POUR FIRE at the German positions, SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE. 
ON THE BRIDGE The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM OF BULLETS at the German positions. 
Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies. 
He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime. 
MILLER I'll keep it in mind. (calls to Sarge) OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME. 
Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE. 
Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days. 
MILLER Things are tough all over.  We're looking for a Private James Ryan. 
Forrest Ryan? 
MILLER Is he here? 
Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers. 
Forrest Go get Ryan. 
(TO MILLER) What do you want him for, sir? 
Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and scrambles to them. 
MILLER Jackson, get a hold of command. 
Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to Forrest. 
MILLER How many men do you have? 
They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men to leap over the barricade. 
Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone. 
Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's hailing I.D.   No response. 
JACKSON Not yet. 
MILLER Keep trying. 
Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan? 
Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees: 
PRIVATE JAMES RYAN Dashing from cover to cover, making his way toward them.  Ryan is an American classic, nineteen years old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky. Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and smeared with dirt and blood, he's very alive.  His eyes shine, his face has a spark.  You can't help but love this kid. 
MILLER'S MEN All watch Ryan run toward them. 
JACKSON So, that's Ryan.

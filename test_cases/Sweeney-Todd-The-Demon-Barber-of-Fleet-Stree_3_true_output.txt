BEGGAR WOMAN (V.O.) Beadle ... Beadle... 
Johanna looks around urgently, sees the large chest. She quickly climbs into it and shuts the lid as-- 
The Beggar Woman enters. 
BEGGAR WOMAN Beadle dear, Beadle... 
The room has a strange effect on her, as if she were vaguely recalling some distant dream. She intones to pretty lullaby music... 
BEGGAR WOMAN Beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle dumpling, Beadle, dumpling, Be-deedle dumpling... 
SUDDENLY-- 
Without warning -- like a thunderbolt -- Todd leaps into the room-- 
TODD What are you doing here?! 
BEGGAR WOMAN (clutching at his arm) Ah, evil is here, sir. The stink of evil -- from below -- from her! ... (calling) ... Beadle dear, Beadle! 
He looks anxiously out the window for the Judge: TODD Be quiet, woman! 
BEGGAR WOMAN (still clutching at him) She's the Devil's wife! Oh, beware her, sir. She with no pity ... (slowing, looking at him more closely) ...in her heart... 
TODD Out of here! Now!

BEGGAR WOMAN (really peering at him now) Hey, don't I know you, mister? 
Todd suddenly sees -- the Judge! -- walking toward the shop-- Todd has no time--! 
The music THUNDERS as-- 
In one brutal motion -- he swings around and grabs his razor - - fiercely SLASHES her throat -- tosses her in the chair -- pulls the lever -- she slides through the floor-- 
He pulls the chair back to its normal position just as-- 
The Judge enters. 
JUDGE Where is she? Where's the girl? 
TODD Below, your Honor. With my neighbor. Thank heavens the sailor did not molest her. Thank heavens, too, she has seen the error of her ways. 
JUDGE She has? 
TODD Oh yes, sir, your lesson was well learned. She speaks only of you, longing for forgiveness. 
JUDGE Then she shall have it. She'll be here soon, you say? 
The music builds, the pace increases: 
TODD I think I hear her now. 
JUDGE (excited) Oh, excellent, my friend! 
TODD Is that her dainty footstep on the stair? 
JUDGE I hear nothing.

TODD Yes, isn't that her shadow on the wall? 
JUDGE Where? 
TODD There! Primping, Making herself even prettier than usual-- 
JUDGE Even prettier... 
TODD If possible. 
JUDGE (blissful) Ohhhhhhh, Pretty women! 
TODD Pretty women, yes... 
JUDGE (straightening his coat) Quickly, sir, a splash of bay rum! 
TODD Sit, sir, sit. 
JUDGE (settling into chair, in lecherous rapture) Johanna, Johanna... 
Todd gets a towel, puts it carefully around the Judge, moves to get a bottle of bay rum-- 
TODD Pretty women...

NAN Well, maybe not urgent, but immediately significant and necessary to tell. (a deep breath) You see, there's these pills... 
BURKE 'Cause I gotta go. I'm listening with an eighth of an ear now. 
NAN So long. 
He exits as the telephone pollster continues with the list of prospective Michelle Pfeiffer male co-stars. 
INT. PLANE 
Matt, wearing earphones, is in the middle of a row of five, intent on what he is watching. 
MATT'S POV 
A recent example of a great actor in a regular movie... something like Brando in "The Freshman." No sound. 
ON MATT 
Watching intently. Not watching--studying... not studying-- fully appreciating. Now he sees a particularly good moment-- looks around joyously for half a beat--a reflex to share what he saw. His neighbors, not quite knowing what he's smiling at; he returns his attention to the screen. 
EXT. MID-WESTERN HOUSE - DAY 
As Matt's cab pulls up. He opens the front gate and walks up to the porch, noting a tricycle, stirred by old guilts. He knocks on the door. A MAN answers. 
MAN Are you Matt? 
MATT Uh-huh. 
MAN I didn't know if we could wait much longer. Come on in. 
He lights a cigarette, takes three quick drags, then flicks it away before walking inside behind Matt. 
MAN (again) She's a real nut on smoking anywhere near the kid. 
INT. HOUSE - DAY 
They enter. A bedroom down a narrow hallway from where they stand. Remember "The Best Years of Our Lives"... Frederic March coming home from the wars and seeing his wife just a beat before she sees him. Here we have a wretched mutant of that moment. Beth, still fierce and attractive, is packing her daughter's suitcase when she senses him and looks up. Shaking her head with a disapproval which will never die, she walks to him. 
BETH Hello--did you two meet? 
MATT Not really. Is she ready? I have the taxi waiting. 
BETH I just have to say goodbye. You have no idea how difficult that is. 
MATT It's three weeks. 
BETH It's not three weeks. 
MATT Yes, it is. 
BETH No, it's not. 
Several beats--Beth and the man staring at Matt. 
MATT It is. 
MAN He doesn't know? 
BETH You are not taking her for a visit. You are taking her for a while. 
MATT Just because you want to go off with him doesn't mean I... 
MAN You're getting the wrong idea. 
MATT I don't think so. No matter how you put this... 
MAN Hey, look, I'm a United States Marshal. I'm here because she didn't show up yesterday to start serving her time. 
BETH I don't have a choice. You don't have a choice. 
She turns and starts for the other room. 
MATT What did she do? 
BETH (turning) I loved, helped and supported in every possible way a business man who committed the terrible crime of being financially imaginative with a pension fund. 
She exits. He sits down, stunned in the headlights of his fate. 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
Matt and the Marshal in the foreground as Beth talks to Jeannie in the background. We see only glimpses of them. Beth's face as she leans towards Jeannie from one side of the doorway--just Jeannie's legs dangling on the other side. 
BETH'S VOICE Okay, listen carefully, Jeannie. Be still. Now, what's the most important thing in life to know?

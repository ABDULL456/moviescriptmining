Then an idea comes to him. He takes out his brain book. He looks through it until he finds a picture of neurons. He compares the image to the view through the turret. They look different but there are similarities. 
DEVI (O.S) Shh! Baby! Come here, baby! Max rushes out. 
EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATE AFTERNOON 
Max sifts through the trash can where he threw his picks from yesterday. Frustrated, he dumps the trash onto the sidewalk and starts looking through it Mrs. Ovadia watches him. 
Max sees her and is embarrassed for a moment. 
MAX I just threw out something. I didn't realize I needed it. 
MRS. OVADIA Humph. MAX Just a printout. I, uh, lost my data... 
Max looks back at the trash And forgets about Mrs. Ovadia. Soon, Max gets up and kicks the trashcan. He heads home. 
IN FRONT OF MAX'S APARTMENT BUILDING 
Max watches Marcy get out of the limo and call to Mrs. Ovadia. 
Max backs away when he smacks into someone. 
It's Lenny Meyer - the young Jewish man. 
Max jumps back in fear. 
LENNY MEYER Max! How you doing? Lenny Meyer. MAX Oh, hey... Max tries to quickly pass him. 
LENNY MEYER Hey, where you going? You got a few moments to do Tefillin? 
Max turns around and notices Marcy talking to Mrs. Ovadia. Mrs. Ovadia points up the street toward him.

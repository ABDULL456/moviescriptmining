{"train": "SHREK \nWritten by \nWilliam Steig & Ted Elliott \nSHREK Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush) \nAllstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go after the ogre. \nNIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME \nMAN1 Think it's in there? \nMAN2 All right. Let's get it! \nMAN1 Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? \nMAN3 Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread. \nShrek sneaks up behind them and laughs. \nSHREK Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. \nMEN No! \nSHREK They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. \nMAN1 Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (waves the torch at Shrek.) \nShrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the men are in the dark. \nSHREK This is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) \"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.\"(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.) \nTHE NEXT DAY \nThere is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three little pigs. \nGUARD All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up! \nHEAD GUARD Next! \nGUARD (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half) \nHEAD GUARD Get her out of my sight. \nOLD WOMAN No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! \nThe guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and he's able to fly. \nDONKEY Hey! I can fly! \nPETER PAN He can fly! \n3 LITTLE PIGS He can fly! \nHEAD GUARD He can talk! \nDONKEY Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.) \nHe hits the ground with a thud. \nHEAD GUARD Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him! \nGUARDS He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn! \nDonkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He quickly hides behind Shrek. \nHEAD GUARD You there. Ogre! \nSHREK Aye? \nHEAD GUARD By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility. \nSHREK Oh, really? You and what army? \nHe looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and begins walking back to his cottage. \nDONKEY Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible! \nSHREK Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! \nDONKEY Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. \nSHREK Oh, that's great. Really. \nDONKEY Man, it's good to be free. \nSHREK Uh, what? \nDONKEY Can I stay with you, please? \nSHREK (sarcastically) Of course! \nDONKEY Really? \nSHREK No. \nDONKEY Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! \nSHREK Okay! Okay! But one night only. \nDONKEY Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage) \nSHREK What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! \nDONKEY This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. \nSHREK Oh! \nDONKEY Where do, uh, I sleep? \nSHREK (irritated) Outside! \nDONKEY Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me... \nSHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT \nShrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a noise. He stands up with a huff. \nSHREK (to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside. \nDONKEY (from the window) I am outside. \nThere is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns and spots 3 blind mice on his table. \nBLIND MOUSE1 Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? \nBLIND MOUSE2 It's not home, but it'll do just fine. \nGORDO (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed. \nSHREK (flabbergasted) By who? \nLITTLE PIG Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice. \nSHREK (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? \nEveryone looks around at each other but no one answers. \nDONKEY Oh, I do. I know where he is. \nSHREK Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? \nDONKEY Me! Me! \nSHREK Anyone? \nDONKEY Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! \nSHREK (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me. \nDONKEY All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! \nDONKEY (singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again. \nSHREK What did I say about singing? \nDONKEY Can I whistle? \nSHREK No. \nDONKEY Can I hum it? \nSHREK All right, hum it. \nDonkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. \nDULOC - KITCHEN \nA masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in. \nFARQUAAD That's enough. He's ready to talk. \nThe Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered. \nFARQUAAD Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? \nMIRROR Well, technically you're not a king. \nFARQUAAD Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying? \nMIRROR What I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. \nFARQUAAD Go on. \nMIRROR (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? \nGUARDS Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three! \nFARQUAAD Three? One? Three? \nTHELONIUS Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord! \nFARQUAAD Okay, okay, uh, number three! \nMIRROR Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. \nFARQUAAD Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go... \nMIRROR But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. \nFARQUAAD I'll do it. \nMIRROR Yes, but after sunset... \nFARQUAAD Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly) \nDuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section \nShrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high. \nDONKEY But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. \nSHREK So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. \nDONKEY Uh-huh. That's the place. \nSHREK Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) \nFARQUAAD Brave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself... \nAs Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song. \nSHREK All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. \nDONKEY Sorry about that. \nFARQUAAD That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous! \nSHREK (turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. \nFARQUAAD Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! \nMEN Get him! \nSHREK Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) \nCROWD Go ahead! Get him! \nSHREK (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? \nCROWD Kill the beast! \nSHREK No? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on! \nHe takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice to say that Shrek kicks butt. \nDONKEY Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! \nShrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd. \nSHREK Yeah! \nA man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time and sees him. \nWOMAN The chair! Give him the chair! \nShrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild. \nSHREK Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs) \nThe laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on Shrek. \nDONKEY (sniffs the onion) They stink? \nSHREK Yes - - No! \nDONKEY They make you cry? \nSHREK No! \nDONKEY You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs. \nSHREK No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he heaves a sigh and then walks off) \nDONKEY (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers. \nSHREK I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. \nDONKEY You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, \"Let's get some parfait,\" they say, \"Hell no, I don't like no parfait\"? Parfaits are delicious. \nSHREK No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later. \nDONKEY Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. \nSHREK You know, I think I preferred your humming. \nDONKEY Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering. \nThey head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out. \nDRAGON'S KEEP \nShrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano. \nDONKEY (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open and everything. \nSHREK Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We must be getting close. \nDONKEY Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither. \nThey climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very foreboding. \nSHREK Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. (laughs...then the laugh turns into a groan) \nDONKEY Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers? \nSHREK You said do it! I'm doin' it. \nDONKEY I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) Oh! \nSHREK That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks towards the castle) \nDONKEY Cool. So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? \nSHREK Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. (chuckles) \nDONKEY I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek. \nINSIDE THE CASTLE \nDONKEY You afraid? \nSHREK No. \nDONKEY But... \nSHREK Shh. \nDONKEY Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that. \nSHREK Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs. \nDONKEY Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess. \nSHREK (putting on a helmet) The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. \nDONKEY What makes you think she'll be there? \nSHREK I read it in a book once. (walks off) \nDONKEY Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'. (walks off) \nEMPTY ROOM \nDonkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room. \nDONKEY I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it. \nELSEWHERE \nShrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down the hallway. \nFIONA But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something! \nSHREK I don't think so. \nFIONA Can I at least know the name of my champion? \nSHREK Uh, Shrek. \nFIONA Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds out a handkerchief) I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. \nSHREK Thanks! \nSuddenly they hear the dragon roar. \nFIONA (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon? \nSHREK It's on my to-do list. Now come on! (takes off running and drags Fiona behind him.) \nFIONA But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did. \nSHREK Yeah, right before they burst into flame. \nFIONA That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek ignores her and heads for a wooden door off to the side.) Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there. \nSHREK Well, I have to save my ass. \nFIONA What kind of knight are you? \nSHREK One of a kind. (opens the door into the throne room) \nDONKEY (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs worriedly) (we see him up close and from a distance as Shrek sneaks into the room) I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - - I'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh! \nShrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her. \nDONKEY Hi, Princess! \nFIONA It talks! \nSHREK Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick. \nThey all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles off and walks lightly. \nFIONA What is so funny? \nSHREK Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet. \nSHREK Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. \nFIONA Just take off the helmet. \nSHREK I'm not going to. \nFIONA Take it off. \nSHREK No! \nFIONA Now! \nSHREK Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. (takes off his helmet) \nFIONA You- - You're a- - an ogre. \nSHREK Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. \nFIONA Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre. \nSHREK Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who wants to marry you. \nFIONA Then why didn't he come rescue me? \nSHREK Good question. You should ask him that when we get there. \nFIONA But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his- - his pet. \nDONKEY Well, so much for noble steed. \nSHREK You're not making my job any easier. \nFIONA I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. \nSHREK Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. (he swiftly picks her up and swings her over his shoulder like she was a sack of potatoes) \nFIONA You wouldn't dare. Put me down! \nSHREK Ya comin', Donkey? \nDONKEY Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess. \nFIONA No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. \nSHREK Homey touches? Like what? (he hears a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona who has torn the bark off of a tree.) \nFIONA A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. (goes into the cave and puts the bark door up behind her) \nDONKEY You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will. \nFIONA (os) I said good night! \nShrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona still inside. \nDONKEY Shrek, What are you doing? \nSHREK (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding. \nLATER THAT NIGHT \nShrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations to Donkey. \nSHREK And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields. \nDONKEY Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future from these stars? \nSHREK The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for. \nDONKEY I know you're making this up. \nSHREK No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench. \nDONKEY That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots. \nSHREK You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it. \nDONKEY (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway? \nSHREK Our swamp? \nDONKEY You know, when we're through rescuing the princess. \nSHREK We? Donkey, there's no \"we\". There's no \"our\". There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land. \nSHREK Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. \nDONKEY Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there? \nFiona puts the door back. \nSHREK That's the moon. \nDONKEY Oh, okay. \nDuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom \nThe camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic Mirror shows him Princess Fiona. \nFARQUAAD Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. \nMIRROR Hmph. \nThe Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning. \nFARQUAAD Ah. Perfect. \nFarquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly at her image in the mirror. \nMORNING \nFiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking in his sleep. \nDONKEY (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. Come on, baby. I said I like it. \nSHREK Donkey, wake up. (shakes him) \nDONKEY Huh? What? \nSHREK Wake up. \nDONKEY What? (stretches and yawns) \nFIONA Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs? \nDONKEY Oh, good morning, Princess! \nFiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them. \nSHREK No, it's tender. \nFIONA Now, hold on. \nSHREK What you're doing is the opposite of help. \nFIONA Don't move. \nSHREK Look, time out. \nFIONA Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his hand over her face to stop her from getting at the arrow) Okay. What do you propose we do? \nELSEWHERE \nDonkey is still looking for the special flower. \nDONKEY Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns. \nSHREK (os) Ow! \nDONKEY Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens to be a blue flower with red thorns) \nTHE FOREST PATH \nSHREK Ow! Not good. \nFIONA Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just about... \nSHREK Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall over with Fiona on top of him) \nDONKEY Ahem. \nSHREK (throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing happend. We were just, uh - - \nDONKEY Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay? \nSHREK Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just- - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he turns to look at Fiona who holds up the arrow with a smile) Ow! \nDONKEY Hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle) That's...is that blood? \nDonkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue on their way. \nThere is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc. Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc. \nFiona looks at DuLoc and sighs. \nFIONA I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night. \nSHREK Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it. \nFIONA (smiles) I'd like that. \nThey smiles at each other. \nSHREK Um, Princess? \nFIONA Yes, Shrek? \nSHREK I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) Are you gonna eat that? \nDONKEY (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset. \nFIONA (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late. \nSHREK What? \nDONKEY Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't you? \nFIONA Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside. \nDONKEY Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until - - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark. \nShrek sighs \nFIONA Good night. \nSHREK Good night. \nFiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks at Shrek with a new eye. \nDONKEY Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here. \nSHREK Oh, what are you talkin' about? \nDONKEY I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it. \nSHREK You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. \nFIONA It's me, in this body. \nDONKEY Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to her stomach) Can you hear me? \nFIONA Donkey! \nDONKEY (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there! \nFIONA No! \nDONKEY Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! \nFIONA Shh. \nDONKEY Shrek! \nFIONA This is me. \nDonkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets down. \nDONKEY Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different. \nFIONA I'm ugly, okay? \nDONKEY Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - - \nFIONA No. I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember. \nDONKEY What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before. \nFIONA It only happens when sun goes down. \"By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form.\" \nDONKEY Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry. \nFIONA It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this. (begins to cry) \nDONKEY All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7. \nFIONA But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look. \nDONKEY Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad? \nFIONA I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell. \nFIONA Shrek. Are you all right? \nSHREK Perfect! Never been better. \nFIONA I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you. \nSHREK You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last night. \nFIONA You heard what I said? \nSHREK Every word. \nFIONA I thought you'd understand. \nSHREK Oh, I understand. Like you said, \"Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?\" \nFIONA But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. \nSHREK Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at him in shock. He looks past her and spots a group approaching.) Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something. \nFarquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers march by. \nDONKEY What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that? Couldn't have been the donkey. \nFARQUAAD Princess Fiona. \nSHREK As promised. Now hand it over. \nFARQUAAD Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper) Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad. \nFIONA Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... (Watches as Farquaad is lifted off his horse and set down in front of her. He comes to her waist.) farewell. \nFARQUAAD Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre. It's not like it has feelings. \nFIONA No, you're right. It doesn't. \nDonkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face. \nFARQUAAD Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom? \nFIONA Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - - \nFARQUAAD (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed! \nSHREK Back off! \nDONKEY No, you back off. \nSHREK This is my swamp! \nDONKEY Our swamp. \nSHREK (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working with) Let go, Donkey! \nDONKEY You let go. \nSHREK Stubborn jackass! \nDONKEY Smelly ogre. \nSHREK Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks away) \nDONKEY Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet. \nSHREK Well, I'm through with you. \nDONKEY Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, \"Me, me, me!\" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away. \nSHREK Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? \nDONKEY Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other! \nSHREK Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back! (goes into the outhouse and slams the door) \nDONKEY Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings. \nSHREK (os) Go away! \nDONKEY There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you. \nSHREK (os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking. \nDONKEY She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else. \nSHREK (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about? \nDONKEY Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. Right? Right? \n", "test1_input": "FIONA (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are! \nROBIN HOOD Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. (laughs) \nSuddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song. \nMERRY MEN Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo. \nROBIN HOOD I steal from the rich and give to the needy. \nMERRY MEN He takes a wee percentage, \nROBIN HOOD But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels, man, I'm good. \nMERRY MEN What a guy, Monsieur Hood. \nROBIN HOOD Break it down. I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid... \nMERRY MEN What he's basically saying is he likes to get... \nROBIN HOOD Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad. \nMERRY MEN That's bad. \nROBIN HOOD When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad. \nMERRY MEN He's mad, he's really, really mad. \nROBIN HOOD I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start... \nThere is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and knocks Robin Hood unconscious. \nFIONA Man, that was annoying! \nShrek looks at her in admiration. \nMERRY MAN Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at Fiona but she ducks out of the way) \nThe arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree. \nAnother fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, and Fiona begins walking away. \nFIONA Uh, shall we? \n", "test1_true": "FIONA What? \nSHREK That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that? \nFIONA Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a...(gasps and points) there's an arrow in your butt! \nSHREK What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you look at that? (he goes to pull it out but flinches because it's tender) \nFIONA Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. \nDONKEY (walking up) Why? What's wrong? \nFIONA Shrek's hurt. \nDONKEY Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die. \nSHREK Donkey, I'm okay. \nDONKEY You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the Heimlich? \nFIONA Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns. \nDONKEY Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! \nSHREK & FIONA Donkey! \nDONKEY Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. (runs off) \nSHREK What are the flowers for? \nFIONA (like it's obvious) For getting rid of Donkey. \nSHREK Ah. \nFIONA Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out. (gives the arrow a little pull) \nSHREK (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'. \nAs they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and Shrek keeps dodging her hands. \nFIONA I'm sorry, but it has to come out. \n", "test1_id": 216, "test2_input": "FIONA Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the \"I do's\"? \nFARQUAAD (chuckles and then motions to the priest to indulge Fiona) Go on. \nCOURTYARD \nSome guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with a boom. The guards all take off running. \nDONKEY (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? (she nods and goes after the guards) Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you? \nSHREK (at the Church door) What are you talking about? \nDONKEY There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, \"Speak now or forever hold your peace.\" That's when you say, \"I object!\" \nSHREK I don't have time for this! \nDONKEY Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you? \nSHREK Yes. \nDONKEY You wanna hold her? \nSHREK Yes. \nDONKEY Please her? \nSHREK Yes! \nDONKEY (singing James Brown style) Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. (normal) The chicks love that romantic crap! \nSHREK All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line? \nDONKEY We gotta check it out. \nINSIDE CHURCH \nAs the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see. \nPRIEST And so, by the power vested in me... \nOutside \nSHREK What do you see? \n", "test2_true": "Inside \nPRIEST I now pronounce you husband and wife... \nOutside \nDONKEY They're at the altar. \nInside \nPRIEST ...king and queen. \nOutside \nDONKEY Mother Fletcher!

Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first of all. Very clean. \nFIONA What are you doing here? \nSHREK Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding... \nSHREK Fiona! I need to talk to you. \nFIONA Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me \nSHREK But you can't marry him. \n", "test2_id": 217, "test3_input": "FIONA And why not? \nSHREK Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king. \nFARQUAAD Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him. \nSHREK He's not your true love. \nFIONA And what do you know about true love? \nSHREK Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - \nFARQUAAD Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord. (laughs) \nThe prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The whole congregation laughs. \nFARQUAAD An ogre and a princess! \nFIONA Shrek, is this true? \nFARQUAAD Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our \"happily ever after.\" Now kiss me! (puckers his lips and leans toward her, but she pulls back.) \nFIONA (looking at the setting sun) \"By night one way, by day another.\" (to Shrek) I wanted to show you before. \nShe backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self. She gives Shrek a sheepish smile. \nSHREK Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona smiles) \nFARQUAAD Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them! Get them both! \nThe guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights them. \nSHREK No, no! \nFIONA Shrek! \nFARQUAAD This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king! See? See? \nFIONA No, let go of me! Shrek! \nSHREK No! \nFARQUAAD Don't just stand there, you morons. \n", "test3_true": "FARQUAAD I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll beg for death to save you! \nFIONA No, Shrek! \nFARQUAAD (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And as for you, my wife... \nSHREK Fiona! \nFARQUAAD I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I'm king! \nShrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles. \nFARQUAAD I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon show up and the dragon leans down and eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah! \nDONKEY All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on the edge! \nThe dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth and falls to the ground. \nDONKEY Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? \nThe congregation cheers. \nDONKEY Go ahead, Shrek. \nSHREK Uh, Fiona? \nFIONA Yes, Shrek? \nSHREK I - - I love you. \nFIONA Really? \nSHREK Really, really. \nFIONA (smiles) I love you too. \nShrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation. \nCONGREGATION Aawww! \nSuddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around her. \n", "test3_id": 218}

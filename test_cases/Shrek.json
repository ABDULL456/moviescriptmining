{"test1_input": "DONKEY (sniffs the onion) They stink? \nSHREK Yes - - No! \nDONKEY They make you cry? \nSHREK No! \nDONKEY You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs. \nSHREK No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he heaves a sigh and then walks off) \nDONKEY (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers. \nSHREK I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. \nDONKEY You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, \"Let's get some parfait,\" they say, \"Hell no, I don't like no parfait\"? Parfaits are delicious. \nSHREK No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later. \nDONKEY Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. \nSHREK You know, I think I preferred your humming. \nDONKEY Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering. \nThey head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out. \nDRAGON'S KEEP \nShrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano. \nDONKEY (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open and everything. \nSHREK Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We must be getting close. \nDONKEY Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither. \nThey climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very foreboding. \nSHREK Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. (laughs...then the laugh turns into a groan) \nDONKEY Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers? \n", "test1_true": "DONKEY Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves. \nSHREK Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. \nDONKEY You know what I mean. \nSHREK You can't tell me you're afraid of heights. \nDONKEY No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava! \nSHREK Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time. \nDONKEY Really? \nSHREK Really, really. \nDONKEY Okay, that makes me feel so much better. \nSHREK Just keep moving. And don't look down. \nDONKEY Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down. (he steps through a rotting board and ends up looking straight down into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please! \nSHREK But you're already halfway. \nDONKEY But I know that half is safe! \nSHREK Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back. \nDONKEY Shrek, no! Wait! \nSHREK Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? (bounces and sways the bridge) \nDONKEY Don't do that! \nSHREK Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces the bridge again) \nDONKEY Yes, that! \nSHREK Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across the bridge) \nDONKEY No, Shrek! No! Stop it! \n", "test1_id": 216, "test2_input": "Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down the hallway. \nFIONA But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something! \nSHREK I don't think so. \nFIONA Can I at least know the name of my champion? \nSHREK Uh, Shrek. \nFIONA Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds out a handkerchief) I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. \nSHREK Thanks! \nSuddenly they hear the dragon roar. \nFIONA (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon? \nSHREK It's on my to-do list. Now come on! (takes off running and drags Fiona behind him.) \nFIONA But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did. \nSHREK Yeah, right before they burst into flame. \nFIONA That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek ignores her and heads for a wooden door off to the side.) Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there. \nSHREK Well, I have to save my ass. \nFIONA What kind of knight are you? \nSHREK One of a kind. (opens the door into the throne room) \nDONKEY (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs worriedly) (we see him up close and from a distance as Shrek sneaks into the room) I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - - I'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh! \nShrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her. \nDONKEY Hi, Princess! \nFIONA It talks! \nSHREK Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick. \nThey all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles off and walks lightly. \n", "test2_true": "Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona. \nSHREK Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon. \nShrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that is still around the dragons neck. \nSHREK (echoing) Run! \nThey all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away. \nFIONA (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) You're - - You're wonderful. You're... (turns and sees Shrek fall down the hill and bump into Donkey) a little unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed is great, and thy heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears his throat.) And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed? \nDONKEY I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed. \nFIONA The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. \nSHREK Uh, no. \nFIONA Why not? \nSHREK I have helmet hair. \nFIONA Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer. \nSHREK No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st. \nFIONA But how will you kiss me? \nSHREK What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the job description. \nDONKEY Maybe it's a perk. \nFIONA No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss. \nDONKEY Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you true love? \nFIONA Well, yes. \nBoth Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing. \nDONKEY You think Shrek is your true love! \n", "test2_id": 217, "test3_input": "SHREK Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. \nDONKEY Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there? \nFiona puts the door back. \nSHREK That's the moon. \nDONKEY Oh, okay. \nDuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom \nThe camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic Mirror shows him Princess Fiona. \nFARQUAAD Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. \nMIRROR Hmph. \nThe Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning. \nFARQUAAD Ah. Perfect. \nFarquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly at her image in the mirror. \nMORNING \nFiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking in his sleep. \nDONKEY (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. Come on, baby. I said I like it. \nSHREK Donkey, wake up. (shakes him) \nDONKEY Huh? What? \nSHREK Wake up. \nDONKEY What? (stretches and yawns) \nFIONA Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs? \nDONKEY Oh, good morning, Princess! \nFiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them. \n", "test3_true": "FIONA You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me. \nSHREK Uh, thanks. \nDonkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips. \nFIONA Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. (walks off) \nLATER \nThey are once again on their way. They are walking through the forest. Shrek belches. \nDONKEY Shrek! \nSHREK What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. (laughs) \nDONKEY Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess. \nFiona belches \nFIONA Thanks. \nDONKEY She's as nasty as you are. \nSHREK (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly what I expected. \nFIONA Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them. \nShe smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into a tree. \nROBIN HOOD La liberte! Hey! \nSHREK Princess! \nFIONA (to Robin Hood) What are you doing? \nROBIN HOOD Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses up her arm while Fiona pulls back in disgust)...beast. \nSHREK Hey! That's my princess! Go find you own! \nROBIN HOOD Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here? \n", "test3_id": 218}

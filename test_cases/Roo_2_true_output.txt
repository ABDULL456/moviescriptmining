JACK Ma. Where are we when we're asleep? 
MA Right here in Room. 
JACK But dreams. Do we go into TV for dreaming? 
MA We're never anywhere but here.

JACK I want some. 
They put down Eggsnake and Ma turns to him so he can breastfeed.

Ma lies on the bed. Jack is nowhere to be seen. Eventually his voice comes from the wardrobe. 
JACK Ma! I think Old Nick lives in TV, like Mouse. That's where he goes when he's not here in Room. 
MA Jack. Go to sleep. 18   INT. ROOM - DAY                                              18 
The third morning. Jack wakes up in the bed, where Ma always carries him once Old Nick has gone. 
Ma is up already, sitting at the table, staring at a shiny red truck and remote in a hard pack. The snake is in Eden. 
Jack can hardly believe what's in front of him. He looks at it for a while. 
MA You can open it. 
We watch as Jack opens the box. Ma tries to help him when he finds the packaging difficult. 
JACK (pulling it away from her) I can do it. 
Later, Jack is playing with his new toy. Ma watches him uneasily. We hear a faint echo of screaming ... 
CHAPTER TITLE: UNLYING The screaming get's louder. 
Later, Ma is standing on a chair screaming and howling at the Skylight. Jack stands in the bath screaming into the small air vent above the shelf. He holds his truck up to the vent so it can join in. 
Then they hush and listen. 
JACK (CONT'D) Why the aliens never scream back? MA I guess they still can't hear us. 
JACK Tomorrow we'll do even louderer. 
Later, Ma, preoccupied, trims mold off cheese she slices very thin and lays on brown bread. Puts it in the toaster oven. 
Jack zigzags his truck around chair and table legs. Ma checks to see if the frozen peas are boiling yet. Jack drives the truck at the door: clang. 
MA Jack!

JACK What smells bad? 
Ma belatedly realizes the grilled cheese is smoking. 
She burns her hand slightly on the oven, wrenching it open. 19   INT. ROOM - WARDROBE - NIGHT                                 19 
That evening. Jack, in the wardrobe, is meant to be asleep but he's still playing with his truck. 
The door beeps; he kneels up for a glimpse as it booms shut. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) Hey. What's the smell? 
He puts down groceries, unzips his jacket. 
MA (O.S.) Sorry, I burned some cheese. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) You need to take more care. 
MA (O.S.) I will. I wasn't thinking. 
OLD NICK Yeah, well, thinking's not your strong suit. 
MA (O.S.) I know. I'm really sorry. 
Ma is unpacking the groceries. 
OLD NICK So did he like his truck? 
He laughs at her speechless discomfort. 
OLD NICK (CONT'D) I know boys, I was one once. 
Ma looks at the empty bag. 
MA The vitamins? 
OLD NICK Waste of money. 
MA If we had a better diet, maybe...

Mewtwo The real one is real?.... Fine! (Mewtwo shoots another black electric ball at Mew but Mew dodges it and just barely misses Ash! Ash then starts climbing down the statue.) Lets decide which is the real one without skills. You're the stronger ones, GO! (All the copies start attacking their originals. The copies are winning. Mewtwo makes a visible blue force field around himself. Mew does the same except its pink and they fly up high in the air and keep ramming into each other. Then Pikachu is looking around at the big copy war then he sees his copy standing there ready to fight him! Pikachu can't believe it.) 
Nurse Joy What is this fighting? Both the real ones and copies are alive now. 
Sweet Everyone is a living thing 
Brock Though they were created, there are living beings that live in this world. 
Misty The real ones and the copies... But both of them are the same living things. There's no such thing as a win and losing. 
James If we were asked that, I wouldn't know what to say 
Jessie I feel so sorry 
James They're bullying themselves.

69 CONTINUED: 69 Danny D.'s conversation floats up from a lower platform. 
DANNY D. (O.S.) Man, I mean to tell you, by the end, you got blood of lions, baboons, rhinos on your dungarees. Bennett, wearing an orange vest over his casual clothes, seems uneasy. Jimmy yells down to his friend. 
JIMMY That's Kenya, Danny, not one of these turkey shoots. 
DANNY D. Bred animals kill, too, Jimmy. Jimmy continues his thought to Bennett. 
JIMMY Fuck Connex. Fucking slant- drillers. Don't know why I ever sold 'em my company in the first place. Here, take your pick. He hands Bennett a thick catalogue. ANGLE ON CATALOGUE: Pages of animals you can shoot with pictures and description. ADDAX -- "this large African antelope is white with a gray masked face. It's horns corkscrew up making multiple twists in both sexes. Large males can weigh 275 lbs. Both males and females make handsome trophies. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) The Tengiz is the Holy Grail. You get into that stream, nobody in your family will ever have to clean a toilet again. 
BENNETT I have a feeling this U.S. Attorney has a source. 
JIMMY Like somebody who didn't get into Tengiz and is pissed off about it. 
BENNETT Any idea who that might be? Jimmy looks at Bennett like he was just born.

69 CONTINUED: (2) 69 
JIMMY How 'bout every other oil company in the world. (re: the catalogue) What's your fancy? Bennett randomly picks an animal from the list. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) The Kudu. Good choice. (calling to driver) Floyd. Kudu. Bennett sees in the distance "Beater Boys," Mexican men in orange jackets, flushing quail for a party of hunters. 
70 (OMIT) 70 
71 ANGLE LATER 71 IN THE DISTANCE a massive Kudu, tame as a house cat, unafraid of guns or people, stands near a feeder. 
DANNY (O.S.) 
(WHISPERS) Kudu. Big bull. Bennett hesitates. Jimmy looks at him. 
BENNETT I'm not sure -- 
JIMMY Jesus H. Christ. Kudu is rare. Get that gun up. Bennett lifts the rifle. THROUGH THE CROSS-HAIRS the Kudu is gigantic and unaware of the hunters. 
DANNY D. (O.S.) He's got 52 inch horns. Maybe 54. The Kudu looks at Bennett. An uncomfortable beat -- 
JIMMY (O.S.) Come on, son. He won't wait all day. Finally Bennett PULLS THE TRIGGER. The gun is LOUD. He stares, then slowly pulls back from the scope. 
DANNY D. (O.S.) Lung shot. He's gonna run a bit. 
72 EXT. THICKET - 777 RANCH - DAY 72 
The sound of their feet - tromp, tromp, tromp - as Jimmy and Bennett move through dense thicket looking for the wounded animal. 
JIMMY My granddaddy was a wildcatter. Same with my daddy. That's how I got my start. Luck and hard work. Nobody handed me shit. Now, I got libraries and parks named after me. And I'll probably ruin the grand-kids. You wearing a wire, Bennett? 
BENNETT No. 
JIMMY Mind if I pat you down? Jimmy checks for a recording device. He's clean. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) We all tell ourselves little stories, Bennett. Sometimes I'm the flame burning in the Jefferson Memorial. Other times I'm a guy with his nose pressed up against the windows of a whorehouse -- Suddenly there's a RUSTLING as a large animal passes somewhere close. Bennett freezes. Jimmy looks at him. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) Boar. 
(BEAT) This deal snapped the lights on in the kitchen and the rodents all scurried. Now you're standing there under the lights trying to point to where they all went. 
(BEAT) Don't be the one caught out in the kitchen. Jimmy unslings his rifle and motions to where, obscured in the thicket, a pair of intense dying eyes stares back. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) What'd your daddy do, Bennett? 
(CONTINUED)

BENNETT I don't know who my father is. On Bennett as Jimmy FIRES --

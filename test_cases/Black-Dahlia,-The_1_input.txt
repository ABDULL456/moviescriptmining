RUSS MILLARD Yes. Fritzie. He wanted you to lose your cherry. He bought you a woman for two days. Is that right? 
JOHNNY Not a woman. Not a real one. A hoooer. 
Johnny turns the syllable into a long laugh. 
RUSS MILLARD This was at the Biltmore? 
JOHNNY Daddy got a good rate on the room. He knew the house dick...This ain't right... 
RUSS MILLARD We'll be done soon, Johnny. You met Liz Short at the Biltmore, too? 
JOHNNY What's her name introduced me...the hooer. 
RUSS MILLARD And what did you and Liz do? 
JOHNNY We...played horse and rider. Gave her the Big Schnitz. 
RUSS MILLARD Did you whip her? 
Johnny thinks back, his head lolling to and fro... 
JOHNNY Softly. So so softly. Horse and Rider. 
RUSS MILLARD Johnny. Did you kill Liz Short? 
Johnny jerks back spasmodically. 
JOHNNY No no no no! I didn't kill her! 
RUSS MILLARD Easy son-- 
JOHNNY I didn't slice her! 
RUSS MILLARD It's all right...Do you know who did? JOHNNY No! No! 
Johnny's starting to sweat. Russ and Bucky lean in... 
RUSS MILLARD When your Daddy found out you'd been with her, he tried to fix things didn't he? 
Johnny nods yes. 
RUSS MILLARD (cont'd) He found out Charlie Issler had been picked up and he knew Charlie had this confessing problem, right? 
JOHNNY Daddy...went to Ellis...to the Jewboy. Wanted to get Charlie released...but the Jewboy said no...Daddy had a morgue friend owed him a favor and got this DOA cooze...Daddy wanted Uncle Bill but Ellis Jewboy said take Bleichert. (looking right at Bucky) Daddy said you'd do it cuz without Blanchard you were jelly. Said you were a sob sister, weak sister... 
Johnny starts laughing hysterically, shaking his chained hands like a zoo animal trying to get loose. Russ steps in front of a red-hot Bucky-- 
RUSS MILLARD (to Bucky) I think you should go outside. 
EXT. THE FIRE ESCAPE - LATER 
Bucky sits out on the fire escape watching cars drive by. Russ leans out the window and hands Bucky the statement. 
RUSS MILLARD His statement. Signed. 
Bucky reads it and slips it into his pocket. 
RUSS MILLARD We should sit on this for a little bit. Until I can talk to a legal officer. 
Bucky shakes his head no, climbs back inside the window. 
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Bucky handcuffs Johnny's hands behind his back as the big man cries... 
JOHNNY Daddy... 
RUSS MILLARD (to Bucky) It's the shithouse until you retire, you know that. 
BUCKY I owe her this one. 
He squeezes Johnny's handcuffs tighter. 
INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - BOOKING - NIGHT 
Reporters follow Bucky and Johnny inside, piqued by the sight of a plainclothes officer escorting a cuffed uniform inside. 
BUCKY No comment...No comment... (whispering in Johnny's ear) Tell your Daddy I know everything. Including his extortion deal. Tell him I'm goin' to the papers tomorrow. 
He approaches the desk sergeant. 
DESK SERGEANT What the hell is this? 
A flashbulb goes off in their faces. Johnny sobs. 
BUCKY I'm Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is Officer John Vogel. 
He hands over Johnny's signed statement. 
BUCKY (cont'd) Book him. 
Another flashbulb. 
EXT. CENTRAL STATION - LATER 
Bucky jogs up the steps inside. 
INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
He dresses in his blue uniform, preparing to go back to work. 
INTERCOM Officer Bleichert, go to the watch commander's office immediately. 
Bucky brushes imaginary dust off his shirt and grabs his hat. 
INT. LIEUTENANT JASTROW'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER 
Bucky walks in, saluting like an idealistic rookie. Jastrow stands, ignoring the salute. 
JASTROW You're on two weeks vacation leave as of now. When you return to duty, report to Chief Green. He'll reassign you to another division. 
BUCKY Why? 
JASTROW Fritz Vogel just blew his brains out. That's why. 
All Bucky can think to do is salute again, rock firm. He walks outside and crosses into 
INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Crammed with blues awaiting roll call. They all stare at Bucky; he meets the eyes that seek his, making them look down. Defiant. 
As he passes he can hear the hisses: "Traitor". "Bolshevik". He continues towards the door, almost out when suddenly he hears applause. 
Bucky turns to see,Russ Millard, Harry Sears and Thad Green clapping good-bye... 
INT. THE CASTING OFFICE - DAY 
Clapstick: "Elizabeth Short Screen Test #4" 
She sits on an ugly brown sofa, sides in her hands. Silence. 
MAN #4 (O.S.) Are you all right, Miss Short?

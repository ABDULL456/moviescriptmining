{"train": "FADE IN: \n1   EXT:   MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY \nBehind the opening credits, we watch a montage of RUPERT PUPKIN making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering manila envelopes and packages to various New York offices, always courteous and polite in his demeanor, PUPKIN is an attractive-looking young man just past thirty and dressed in a stylish blue suit, broad tie and wide-collared shirt. His shoes are neatly polished, his hair carefully groomed. As the montage continues, we see that he has finished his deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination. It turns out to be a television theater north of Times Square whose marquee announces THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW. It is dusk and the show is about to break. There is a very small crowd already positioned at the stage door -- a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional autograph hunters are clustered together: \nMAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a lace hat and much too much rouge. \nSIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned, slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries a brown lunch bag. \nCELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties. She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity. \nA middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit,    emerges from the backstage door which is guarded by a    large, white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals     in the crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately    steps in front of him with her autograph book raised. \nMAE (to the MAN) Are you somebody? \nMAN No, honey, I'm just a working stiff. \nThe MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts just as PUPKIN arrives. \nMAE Hi, Rupert. \nCELESTE (coolly) Hello, Rupert. \nSIDNEY Who did you get? \nPUPKIN (distractedly) Nobody. \nPUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or two away from the other professionals. \nMAE (to SIDNEY) I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21. \nCELESTE (to SIDNEY about PUPKIN) He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney. \nMAE Then I got him again at the Pierre at four o'clock. \nSIDNEY Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen to have Mr. Vallone. \nMAE You know what I want for him. \nSIDNEY But I have only six Barbra's left. You know how difficult she is to work with. \nMAE I don't have her even once. \nCELESTE (to MAE) Maybe Rupert would help you. \nPUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE. \nSIDNEY Would you do that, Rupert? You don't feel about Barbra the way I do. \nMAE I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too. \nCELESTE (needling RUPERT) Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do that sort of thing. \nSIDNEY How about it, Rupert?   I'll give you whoever you want. \nSIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper bag and reading them off. \nSIDNEY Rodney    Dangerfield ... Richard Harris    ... Liza Minelli ... and she's    not so easy to work with either    ... Louise Lasser! \nCELESTE You're wasting your time. \nPUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY. \nPUPKIN Look, Sidney. I'm just not interested. This isn't my whole life, you know. \nCELESTE What's that supposed to mean -- that it's my whole life, or Sidney's or Mae's? \nMAE It is so my whole life. \nCELESTE Shut up, Mae. What about your mother? Isn't she part of your life? \nMAE It's her whole life too. \nThe show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out. The crowd around the backstage door swells. \nPOLICEMAN (to the crowd) If you want Jerry's autograph, give me your piece of paper and I'll send it backstage. \nA number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper. PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college age. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper. \nPUPKIN (to the GIRL) What are you going to do with Jerry's autograph? \nYOUNG GIRL I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it. \nBOYFRIEND I'll tell you what she's going to do with it. She's going to pin \nit on her bulletin board and have an orgasm. \nThe YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously. \nCUT TO: \nLANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage door. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the door of the car in conversation. \n5   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - NIGHT \nPUPKIN Thanks, Jerry. \nPUPKIN takes LANGFORD's handkerchief and folds it reverentially, tucking it carefully into his breast pocket. He claps his hands together a few times for joy and dashes into the street to hail a cab. \nCUT TO: \n6   INT:   LANGFORD'S APARTMENT \nLANGFORD enters his apartment. It is tasteful, modern, spacious and empty. A floodlight shines on a single setting at the end of a long dinner table. He walks over to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish. \nLANGFORD (to the fish) Say hello to Jerry. \nOn a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures, one of two boys, roughly eight and eleven, flanked by a shot of each boy alone. LANGFORD walks to the end of the table where a covered dish and a New York Post await him. He lifts the covered dish which reveals a large, cold salmon. \nLANGFORD (to the fish) Say hello to Jerry. \nLANGFORD begins poking at the fish with his fork.    The phone rings. He answers it. \nLANGFORD Yeah. \nGIRL'S VOICE It's Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my note? I left it on the back seat. Did you get it? I dropped it there before they pulled me out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. (pause) Jerry? \nLANGFORD (icily) Who gave you this number? \nMARSHA'S VOICE Don't be    angry with me, Jerry. I didn't know what    else to do; I've been trying you every    five minutes, I miss you, baby ...    Jerry? \nLANGFORD hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver. \nLANGFORD \nSay goodbye to Jerry. \nHe shakes his head wearily, returns to his dinner and turns to the inside pages of the New York Post. \nCUT TO: \n7    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT \nA cab pulls up in front of an all-night florist shop. PUPKIN dashes out of the cab and into the florist's. The cab waits. \nCUT TO: \n8    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT \nPUPKIN dashes out of the florist's clutching a single red rose. He hops back into the cab which starts moving. \nCUT TO: \n9    EXT:   A STREET OFF BROADWAY - NIGHT \nThe cab pulls up in front of Gil's Steaks and Chops, a restaurant of little distinction that has a few checkered tableclothed tables in the rear and a long bar at the front. PUPKIN stares through the window of the bar at RITA, the bargirl, an attractive, somewhat shopworn blonde in her late twenties. PUPKIN enters. \nCUT TO: \n10   INT:   BAR-RESTAURANT \nPUPKIN goes to the near end of the sparsely-populated bar. \nPUPKIN Miss! \nRITA comes over.    PUPKIN smiles knowingly. \nPUPKIN A beer please, Miss.    Something imported. \nRITA Heineken's alright? \nPUPKIN Fine. \nRITA serves him a Heineken's.     She stares at him, searching his face. \nPUPKIN How have you been, Rita? \nShe stares again. \nRITA You're not Rupert Pupkin! \nPUPKIN smiles broadly. \nRITA How the hell did you find me? \nPUPKIN Sally Gardner, I met her after a matinee. Aren't you glad to see me? \nRITA Sure, sure.    How is old Sally? \nPUPKIN The same, I guess. You know, two kids, a nice husband, living in Clifton. \nRITA It figures. \nPUPKIN A lot of the kids in our class have moved back. \nRITA What are you doing here? \nMAN Rita! \nRITA (to PUPKIN) Excuse me a minute, honey. \nPUPKIN I'm not honey! I'm Rupert. \nRITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a beer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily. Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass. \nPUPKIN Miss!     Miss! \nThe MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN.   RITA returns to PUPKIN and serves him another beer. \nPUPKIN I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight. Why don't we go to this nice restaurant I know, talk over and times, get to know each other all over again. \nRITA And then? \nPUPKIN Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd go out again, talk some more, get to know each other even better. \nRITA How much? \nPUPKIN How much what? \nRITA How much do we have to get to know each other? \nPUPKIN I don't understand. \nRITA (emphatically) How much do we have to get to know each other before we start talking about that job? \nPUPKIN I'm not talking about any job. \nRITA Then what's this big offer you were talking about? \nPUPKIN You'll see.    Right now I'm asking you for a date.    How about it? \nRITA I'm sorry, Rupert.     But I'm busy. \nPUPKIN Busy? \nRITA Yeah.   Busy. \nPUPKIN But this is the biggest night of my life. \nRITA I've already got a date. \nThe MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass. \nMAN Rita! \nRITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with him. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He raises his glass. \nPUPKIN Miss!   Miss! \nRITA returns to him. \nPUPKIN Is that your date? \nRITA None of your business. \nPUPKIN What do you want to go out with him for? \nRITA He's a good friend of mine. \nPUPKIN Tell him you're busy. \nRITA What's so important about tonight? \nPUPKIN Everything!    You don't understand. \nRITA No. I don't. It's been really nice seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping in. But I've got some work to do. \nRITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john. \n11   INT:   THE JOHN - NIGHT \nHe enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three urinals. A moment later, the MAN enters. He goes to the nearest of the three urinals. The two men stare at the wall before them but the obvious tension between them renders them both incapable of relieving themselves. PUPKIN glances over at the MAN's face, then immediately turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him. The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to staring at the wall. PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at the MAN's penis. The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at PUPKIN's penis. \nCUT TO: \n12   INT:   THE BAR - NIGHT \nPUPKIN emerges from the john, followed a moment later by the MAN. They resume their seats at each end of the bar. A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN and the MAN. \nPUPKIN Miss! \nRITA walks over reluctantly. \nPUPKIN Listen to me for a second. \nRITA I have work to do, Rupert. \nPUPKIN Just listen. I'm at the start     of something really big. I don't     want to talk about it here but it's    going to happen soon and it's going    to be great -- for both of us. \nRITA No kidding? \nRITA Well, I guess it won't kill me. \nPUPKIN This is supposed to be the finest Cantonese cuisine in the city. \nRITA Yeah? Then what happened to the tablecloths? \nPUPKIN drops his eyes. \nRITA Oh, don't worry about it.   This is \nfine. (She takes a long drink) I'm having a good time. So you've been devoted to me, huh? \nPUPKIN I used to see you at the Garden every year. \nRITA Oh, the Follies. That was the right name for 'em. How did you know which one was me? We all looked like chickens. What I mean is, we all looked like the same chicken. I thought it was gonna be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I wind up looking like Henny Penny. \nRITA chuckles to herself. \nPUPKIN You just didn't get the breaks. \nRITA Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't have the money for the right coach. But what difference does it make? \nShe starts laughing to herself. \nRITA I remember once we were down in Atlanta and the ice machine broke down. We did three hours of slush. Everyone was falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow like the whole thing was planned. And the people ate it up. \nPUPKIN I liked the show. \nRITA Yeah? The Follies? You really must have been carrying the torch. What did you think when I got married? You knew I got married? \nPUPKIN I knew it wouldn't last. \nRITA You think I should have married you, instead, huh? \nPUPKIN Peter Drysdale!     Really, Rita! \nRITA \nIf he'd only been hit by a train. He was worth a helluva lot more dead than alive, I can tell you that. \nRITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby, talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the YOUNG MAN. \nPUPKIN Are you seeing anyone? \nRITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her looking at the YOUNG MAN. \nRITA What do you mean? \nPUPKIN I want to know about the competition, that's all. \nRITA Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And Thursday --- let's see -- \nPUPKIN I'm serious, Rita. \nRITA (imitating him) I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice) Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert. I see a lot of people. \nPUPKIN Anyone special? \nRITA (chuckling) You mean am I \"going steady\"?   Rupert, I'm thirty-one years old! \nPUPKIN What about that guy tonight? \nRITA Him? \nPUPKIN Why him? \nRITA What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit home watching TV? He's just some guy. He's got his own aluminum siding business. He comes into the city sometimes, that's all. \nPUPKIN You don't go out with him for his money?!? \nRITA Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do you think they pay me in that dump? Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get the world's greatest tippers in there either. Somebody has to take care of me. \nPUPKIN That's what I want to talk to you about, Rita. \nThe WAITER arrives with RITA's drink. \nPUPKIN Who's your favorite movie star? \nRITA You are, Rupert.     Especially your nose. \nPUPKIN Just tell me. \nRITA Is this some kind of game? Are you going to tell me something about my character? \nPUPKIN You'll see.    Give me his name. \nRITA I can't think of anybody. \nPUPKIN You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody does. \nRITA Okay. Okay. Let's see.       (pause) Marilyn Monroe. \nPUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his inside jacket pocket. \nThe telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing. A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it. \nPUPKIN You going to spend the rest of your life in that place? Is that what you really want, talking about nothing with nothings? I thought you wanted something a little better than that and that's what I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen, Rita. I want you to be mine. What do you say? \nRITA You really want to help me out? You see this. (She points to her lower back molar) A hundred seventy-five bucks. If you could spare fifty, say, until next Monday, that would keep three people really happy -- me, my landlord and my dentist. \nDuring RITA's speech, the WAITER has been working his way from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant. \nWAITER Telephone for you, Miss. \nRITA (looking puzzled) Me? Nobody knows I'm here.   You didn't tell anybody, did you? \nPUPKIN No. \nRITA (getting up) What the hell's going on? \nCAMERA FOLLOWS RITA, who walks to the back of the restaurant and picks up the dangling receiver in one of \nthe two facing booths, the other of which is occupied. \n14   INT:   THE PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT \nRITA Hello? \nMAN'S VOICE Hi. \nRITA Who is this? \nMAN'S VOICE Who do you think it is? I've been staring at you all evening. \nRITA Where are you? \nThe YOUNG MAN taps forcefully with his index finger on the glass door of his booth. RITA, hearing the noise, turns around and finds herself staring at the YOUNG MAN. She smiles. \nCUT TO: \n15   INT:   THE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nPUPKIN at the table looking over the check. He gets out a ten dollar bill. RITA emerges from the booth in nervous high spirits. \nRITA (with repressed gaiety) You know who that was -- the bar.       I have to go back to work. \nPUPKIN How did they know you were here? \nRITA (gathering her things) I guess I must have told them.      They need someone right away. \nPUPKIN (accusingly) You don't even care, do you? \nRITA Oh, no.   I do. Really! \nPUPKIN It's not the bar, Rita.    Don't tell me it's the bar. \nRITA \nDon't be angry. It has nothing to do with you. I had a nice dinner, really. It was great seeing you again. \nPUPKIN stare at her icily. \nRITA Come on.    Let's see a smile. \nPUPKIN Why don't we finish the evening up at the bar together? End the evening where it began? \nRITA After what happened there? \nPUPKIN Well, I could at least drop you off! \nRITA (hurriedly making up her face) That's okay. Really. I can manage. Why don't you just go to a movie or something? Don't let me spoil your evening. \nPUPKIN But that wouldn't be right. \nRITA gets up and stands before PUPKIN. \nRITA (firmly) Look, Rupert. It's been a lot of fun, really. I'll see you sometime, huh? \nPUPKIN But Rita! \nRITA starts moving towards the door. \nRITA Come on, Rupert.      I'm in a hurry. \nRITA marches out with PUPKIN trailing behind. He throws the check and the ten dollar bill at the CASHIER. \n16   EXT.   THE STREET - NIGHT \nCAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jumps into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushes \nafter them,   positioning himself across from    the building. He searches   the windows for some clue as to    where they have gone.    Finally a set of lights go on on    the fourth floor and a   MAN's shadow is seen closing two    sets of blinds. \nCUT TO: \n17   INT:   THE APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT \nPUPKIN enters the building and finds himself in a small entranceway. The door to the lobby is locked. Next to the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their apartment numbers and a button next to each name. There is an intercom speaker. There are eight apartments listed on the fourth floor, running from 4A to 4H. PUPKIN looks them over, takes a deep breath and pushes 4A. \nCUT TO: \n22   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRITA and the YOUNG MAN are seated on the couch. Still no buzzer. As the YOUNG MAN talks, RITA is staring at a woman's shoe lying underneath a small table that holds a lamp. \nYOUNG MAN Did you know that you have remarkable hair? \nRITA Yeah? You know what?       I feel like going to a movie. \nYOUNG MAN Now? \nRITA Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of ten. We can make a ten o'clock show. \nThe YOUNG MAN takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes. \nYOUNG MAN Why don't we make our own movie? \nRITA No.    I don't think so. \nYOUNG MAN Don't be so uptight. Give it a chance. \nRITA I want to go to the movies, that's all. \nYOUNG MAN We can go to the movies later. \nRITA pulls her hands away. \nRITA Let's stop playing games, okay. I'm not a kid. \nYOUNG MAN You have something against pleasure? \nRITA \nI'm just not interested in being tonight's ritual sacrifice, okay? \nYOUNG MAN Shall I freshen up your drink? \nRITA shakes her head. \nYOUNG MAN (growing irritated) What exactly did you think we were going to do up here? \nCUT TO: \n23   INT:   THE ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT \nPUPKIN pushes 4D and waits. \nMAN'S VOICE Yeah? \nCUT TO: \n24   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe YOUNG MAN is practically sitting on RITA's lap.   He has RITA backed up against the end of the couch. \nYOUNG MAN Look, if you've got sexual problems let's talk about them. It helps clear the air. \nRITA There's nothing wrong with me. \nYOUNG MAN Then it's me? \nRITA I don't even know you. \nYOUNG MAN Then find out. Sex is a great way of breaking down barriers. \nRITA I don't think so. \nYOUNG MAN I'm sure this could lead to something beautiful. \nThe YOUNG MAN kisses RITA roughly. \nYOUNG MAN Passive resistance, huh? \nRITA Let's just write this thing off as a big mistake. What do you say? \nYOUNG MAN What's wrong with me? \nRITA Nothing.   I just want to go home. \nYOUNG MAN I can see I'm not turning you on. \nRITA (smiles) You noticed that, huh? \nYOUNG MAN Come on.   What's wrong with me? \nRITA You really want to know? \nYOUNG MAN Yeah. \nRITA How can I put it? Well, it's like you've got your fly open and your tongue hanging out. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \n32   EXT: WEST 56th STREET BETWEEN EIGHTH AND NINTH AVENUES - NIGHT \nWE SEE the taxi pull up in front of one of those middle- \nclass tenements -- a fairly well-preserved six-story building with a fire escape running up the front. PUPKIN helps RITA out of the taxi. A dime bounces at PUPKIN's feet. \nCAB DRIVER'S VOICE Stuff it, big spender! \nPUPKIN pays no attention.   He walks RITA to her front stoop. \nRITA Well, I guess you're entitled to come up for coffee. \nPUPKIN That's okay, Rita. You're tired and I know I'm not always the easiest guy to be with. \nThere is a pause. \nRITA (puzzled) What do you want, Rupert? \nPUPKIN (softly) You don't understand anything, do you? I love you, Rita. I want to change your life ... if you'll only give me a chance. \nRITA just shakes her head sadly. \nPUPKIN Look, what if I arranged it so you could meet Jerry? You'd have to believe me if you heard it from him. \nRITA There's no ... \nPUPKIN I'll arrange that, Rita. We'll all go out to dinner some night or maybe out to his place, on a weekend. You'll see. The trouble with you is you've got no faith. Now go to bed and get a good rest and I'll see you in a couple of days. \nPUPKIN gives RITA a very gentle, sweet kiss on the forehead. \nPUPKIN (gently) Now run along in. \nRITA just stares at him. \nPUPKIN Go on. \nRITA turns slowly and goes in.       She looks back.   PUPKIN is gone. \nFADE TO: \n33   EXT:   MADISON AVENUE AND 48th STREET - DAY \nPUPKIN carries a large manila folder into 424 Madison.        As usual, he is impeccably dressed. \nCUT TO: \n34   INT:   OFFICES OF KOERNER-LIBERMAN TRAVEL - DAY \nIt is a large corner office, broken up by glass dividers. A RECEPTIONIST sits at a desk facing the door. PUPKIN enters. \nRECEPTIONIST Yes. \nPUPKIN hands the RECEPTIONIST the package. \nPUPKIN I need somebody to sign. You can sign anything you want -- Cary Grant, Art Carney, I don't care. \nThe RECEPTIONIST signs. \nPUPKIN Would you mind very much if I used your phone? It's local. \nRECEPTIONIST Don't be, long. Dial nine. \nPUPKIN takes out a little piece of paper from his suit pocket and dials a number. \nPUPKIN (tense, nervous) May I speak to Jerry Langford, please? Thanks ... Jerry Langford, please. Rupert Pupkin ... Jerry knows. I'm calling at his request ... I see. That's alright. I'll call him again. \nRECEPTIONIST That's not Jerry Langford, the ... \nPUPKIN (smiling proudly) \nThat's right.   Thanks for your phone. \nCUT TO: \n35   EXT:   TIMES SQUARE - DAY \nPUPKIN approaches Times Square phone booth. He rests a few folders on a trash basket just outside the booth. He enters the booth and dials. \nPUPKIN Jerry Langford, please ... May I speak to Jerry Langford, please ... Rupert Pupkin, I called earlier ... I see. How long do you expect that'll last? Oh, fine. I'm at (PUPKIN checks the number on the phone) CH 4-1482 ... I'll be here for another half hour, forty- five minutes. Please be sure he gets my message. Thanks. \nPUPKIN hangs up. \nCUT TO: \n36   EXT:   TIMES SQUARE - DAY \nA SHOT of the clock on the Allied Chemical Building. It reads 10:10. A nearby record store starts blasting music into the street through a loudspeaker. The music serves as background for a montage in which we CUT BETWEEN the clock, which moves in bites towards 11:30 to Broadway as it looks to PUPKIN in the booth -- that cavalcade of hustlers, whores, housewives, kids, weirdos and working people; and SHOTS of various people waiting to use the phone -- their impatience, anger, disgust. Each time one of them arrives, PUPKIN pretends to thumb through the phone book and dial a number. WE WATCH him chatting with animation until the waiting party leaves. Then WE SEE him push the coin return to retrieve his dime. Finally, PUPKIN takes a last look at the clock.   WE SEE that it reads 11:30. He leaves the booth and goes to the trash basket. His packages have been swiped. \nCUT TO: \n37   EXT:   AN UPPER BROADWAY HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nCATHY LONG Yes? \nPUPKIN (suddenly a bit shy) I didn't want to take any chances with this ... uh ... Miss Long, so I ... uh ... thought I'd just bring it here myself. \nHe hands CATHY LONG the package as though it contained nitroglycerine. \nCATHY LONG We talked about this this morning, did we, Mr. ... ? \nPUPKIN Pupkin.   Rupert Pupkin. \nCATHY LONG Oh, yes. It's been some day. (pause) Well, I certainly appreciate your bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and we'll listen to it as soon as possible. \nPUPKIN Fine. Er ... you don't have any idea how soon that might be? \nCATHY LONG Well, you can try checking with us tomorrow. We might know something by then. Otherwise, it'll have to be Monday. \nPUPKIN What if I just sort of waited around here today, just in case? I'll stay out of the way. \nCATHY LONG You'd just be wasting your time, Mr. Pupkin. We won't know anything until tomorrow at the earliest. \nPUPKIN Oh, I wouldn't consider it a waste of \ntime at all.    I'd be glad to do it. \nCATHY LONG Look, why don't you try us tomorrow. Okay? \nPUPKIN Tomorrow? ... Right. I'll do that. Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank Jerry. \nCATHY LONG smiles at     PUPKIN and    goes, leaving PUPKIN staring at a picture     of LANGFORD    on the wall. WE FIX on LANGFORD a moment and     PULL BACK    to see LANGFORD in what PUPKIN would imagine     his office    to be. \n48   INT:   AN OFFICE - DAY \nA large, corner office furnished in royal red, with high ceilings and a huge desk. Potted palms and hydrangeas rest on a marble floor. LANGFORD is moving about restlessly, clutching PUPKIN's tape in one hand and waving it about. PUPKIN is seated on a comfortable couch. \nLANGFORD Dynamite!    This is dynamite! \nPUPKIN (shyly) You think so, Jerry? \nLANGFORD Look, I've been at this for fifteen years, Rupert, and I haven't come up with anything like this -- not me, not any of my writers. \nPUPKIN (smiling with obvious pleasure) Well, I'm glad you like it, Jerry. \nLANGFORD Tell me something, Rube. (pause) How do you do it? I'm not asking to use the material myself. I just want to know how you (LANGFORD waves his arms in a gesture of frustration) how you do it. \nPUPKIN Well, I don't know if I can explain it, really. \nLANGFORD Come on.    Try, Rube. \nPUPKIN \nWell,    it just sort of comes. I think about    my life, see, mainly about the worst    parts, all the awful things, and I just    try to see them in a funny light. That's    all. \nLANGFORD (eagerly) Is that what you do? The worst parts, and then you look at them in a funny light? Is that what you do? \nPUPKIN More or less. It's hard to describe how its happens. \nLANGFORD But that's just it, Rube. It doesn't happen for me. Why do you think the show is in so much trouble? By the time I've done my monologue, everyone has switched to Carson. Maybe if you did a little writing ... ? \nPUPKIN Sure, Jerry, I'd do anything I could to help out. \nLANGFORD You would? Great. Why don't you come out to my place this weekend and we'll hash it out. I'm having a few of my friends but we should be able to get a little work in. \nPUPKIN Would you mind if I brought someone? \nLANGFORD (smiling) A girl, Rube? \nPUPKIN A very special girl, Jerry. \nLANGFORD I'd love to meet her. \n49   THE HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING ON UPPER BROADWAY - DAY \nPUPKIN emerges, lost in thought. Suddenly he notices MARSHA waiting nearby. She doesn't see PUPKIN. He sneaks off. \nCUT TO: \n50   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - DAY \nIt is a bright morning. LANGFORD, attempting to camouflage himself by wearing a cap over his eyes and his trench coat collar turned up, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses, walks out of the building. A DOORMAN is standing by the door. \nDOORMAN Cab, Jerry? \nLANGFORD That's alright, thanks. \nWE FOLLOW LANGFORD as he walks. Some people don't notice. Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their companions and pointing at him. A CAB DRIVER pulls alongside. \nDRIVER Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing and juggle at the same time. How about puttin' him on your show? \nLANGFORD keeps walking. \nDRIVER How about it, Jerry? \nLANGFORD Sorry, I'm off duty. \nCATHY LONG ... were not very strong. \nPUPKIN You didn't care for some of the jokes, is that it? \nCATHY LONG That\"s right. \nPUPKIN Good. Good. I can take care of that right way. Thanks. Just tell me the ones you think should go. That would be a big help. (to the RECEPTIONIST) This is great. (to CATHY LONG) Which ones? \nCATHY LONG Well, it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin. You see, Jerry likes to panel his guests, you know, chat with them afterwards. \nPUPKIN Sure.   Sure. \nCATHY LONG And frankly, we just don't feel you've got very much to talk about right now. \nPUPKIN But I've got my whole life to talk about! \nCATHY LONG Which is interesting to you, I'm sure and to your wife ... and to a few friends. But we feel that you should keep developing your act. Test it in some live situations. There are a number of clubs in the city you can \ntry. And after a reasonable period, get in touch with us again and we'll be glad to send someone down to check out your progress. \nPUPKIN stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows. \nPUPKIN May I ask you a question, Miss Long? \nCATHY LONG Of course. \nPUPKIN Are you speaking for Jerry? \nCATHY LONG Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin. Mr. Langford has complete faith in our judgment. \nPUPKIN I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss Long, and I certainly don't want you to take it personally, but I have to tell you that I don't ... I don't have faith in your judgment. \nCATHY LONG Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's nothing that can be done about that. \nPUPKIN No ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have to disagree with you again. \nCATHY LONG (with strained politeness) That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin. Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I have some things to do. I'm sorry the news isn't better. \nCATHY LONG turns to go. \nPUPKIN Miss Long? \nCATHY LONG turns back. \nPUPKIN When are you expecting Jerry in? \nCATHY LONG He won't be in until very late this afternoon. \nPUPKIN That's fine. Thank you. \nCATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST. The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN. PUPKIN continues sitting there. \nRECEPTIONIST Is there anyone else you would like to see? \nPUPKIN That's alright. I'm happy just waiting. \nA few beats pass in silence. \nRECEPTIONIST Well, would you mind waiting outside, please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception area, not a waiting room. \nPUPKIN I understand. \nPUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He goes over to PUPKIN, who stands. \nOFFICIAL Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of security for the Langford organization. \nWIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down the corridor and into the elevator. \nWIRTZ Now I think you understand that we have certain rules here that are essential to the smooth functioning of our operation. \nPUPKIN Sure.     Sure. \nWIRTZ And that without these rules, we really wouldn't be able to function at our best. You follow my point? \nPUPKIN nods. \nWIRTZ Now one of these rules is that only authorized personnel and those having official business with our organization are permitted on our premises. And that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin, to cooperate with us. \nThey have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the button. \nPUPKIN You want me to leave the building. \nWIRTZ That's right. It's nothing personal, Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job. \nThe elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in. \nWIRTZ Have a pleasant day. \nCUT TO: \n55   EXT:   STREET OUTSIDE THE LANGFORD BUILDING - DAY \nPUPKIN comes out and takes up a position outside the door, preparing to wait for LANGFORD. MARSHA sees him and comes over to him. \nThere is a pause. \nPUPKIN This weekend. He asked me to go out there, to his house. \nCUT TO: \n58   THE BAR-RESTAURANT WHERE RITA WORKS - DAY \nPUPKIN enters the bar-restaurant. Through the window WE SEE him talking to RITA. He is voluble, animated. She looks skeptical, with a wry smile on her face. Finally WE WATCH him extract an answer from her. She shrugs, smiles and says yes. He comes walking out the door, his hounded expression softened by a smile. \nCUT TO: \n59   INT:   THE FITTING AREA OF A MEN'S STORE - DAY \nWE WATCH PUPKIN getting fitted in a new suit, attended by a SALESMAN and a TAILOR. \nCUT TO: \n60   INT:   LUGGAGE SHOP - DAY \nWE WATCH PUPKIN buy a suitcase. \nCUT TO: \n61   INT:   CARTIER'S JEWELERS - DAY \nWE WATCH PUPKIN perusing the beautiful diamond, sapphire, and emerald rings and we take a few moments to PAN OVER these beautiful jewels as he sees them. Finally, he picks out a splendid ring with a single, middle-sized sapphire and hands a surprised SALESLADY the money in cash. \nCUT TO: \n62   INT:   SUBURBAN TRAIN - DAY \nPUPKIN and RITA are seated side by side. Since it is Saturday morning, the train is sparsely populated. A CONDUCTOR has just finished taking PUPKIN's tickets. RITA is edgy. PUPKIN is strangely calm and a little remote. He is wearing his new suit. \nRITA What are we going to do? \nPUPKIN (patiently) Look, I told you, I've got some work to discuss with him. That's all. \nRITA But what about me? \nPUPKIN You're with me. \nRITA That's fine, but while you two are talking, what am I going to do? \nPUPKIN You can chat with the other guests. \nRITA I'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing about the wonderful world of draft beer. (pause) Let's tell 'em I'm a model, okay? \nPUPKIN What? \nRITA If they ask what I do, let's just say I model. You don't mind pretending just a little, do you? \nPUPKIN If it make you feel better. \nThere is a pause. \nRITA This is    a gas! Too bad nobody'll believe    it. (pause) After you guys are done    working, what happens? Are we going    out someplace, or what? \nPUPKIN I'm sure Jerry has something arranged. \nThere is another pause. \nRITA What do    these people do for fun? Do they    party or do freaky things or just    get drunk or ... I mean, What do    they do? \nPUPKIN I guess they just sit around and talk and enjoy each other's company, like anybody else. \nRITA Talk?!? What can you talk about for three or four hours?! \nPUPKIN What do    you mean? They've got plenty to talk    about. They do things.    All kinds of    interesting things happen to them    and then they talk about them. What do    you think Jerry's show is all about? \nRITA Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks. That's what all those shows are. At least they help you get to sleep. \nThere is a pause. \nRITA (glumly) Boy, this is going to be some great weekend.   I thought we were gonna have some fun. \nPUPKIN (smiling) Just take it easy, Rita.     Everything's going to be fine. \nWE MOVE IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN who is fading out. \nFADE TO: \n63   EXT:   A NEO-CLASSICAL MANSION \nIt is a large white house with colonial columns set in the middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are punctuated with fine old trees. We circle around to the back where LANGFORD, a handful of his FRIENDS (which can be familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio. A pair of SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and desert as the scene unfolds. As we arrive, we hear a loud burst of laughter. PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with \nstories. \nPUPKIN Oh, you have no idea how bad it's gotten in New York. Now the muggers are so efficient that, each time they jump you, they take your name and address and put you on a mailing list. (the COMPANY chuckles) And once you're on the list, you're in real trouble, like this friend of mine who was mugged thirty-two times on his way home from work. (a little laughter from the COMPANY) \nA SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in front of PUPKIN and RITA. \nPUPKIN (to SERVANT) Thanks. \nJonno nods politely but uncertainly. \nJONNO (uncertain) Mr. Langford asked you to come? \nPUPKIN That's right. Would you mind taking those up? Jerry and I have some work that may oblige me to stay overnight. \nJONNO But Mr. Langford's not here. \nPUPKIN Out playing golf, right? \nJONNO (still puzzled and unsure) That's right. \nPUPKIN Maybe he'll finally break a hundred. \nJONNO Maybe it's better if you came back ... \nPUPKIN (interrupting) That's alright. We don't mind waiting. \nPUPKIN walks from the foyer into the living-room, leaving JONNO staring after him holding the bags. RITA walks into the living room after PUPKIN. \nRITA (worried) The table's only set for one. \nPUPKIN That's from breakfast.     Relax, will you? \nCUT TO: \n69   INT:   LANGFORD'S KITCHEN - DAY \nJONNO is on the phone.   A black lady COOK stands at his side. \nJONNO (into the phone) Let me talk to Jerry Langford please ... I know he is ... It's important. \nCUT TO: \n70   INT:   LANGFORD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nIt is a handsomely furnished room, done in old American antiques and other tasteful pieces. There is a grand piano heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance of classics and modern popular reading. The whole room marks LANGFORD as a man of discernment. The shelves also house a fine stereo and a small, discreet bar. RITA and PUPKIN walk in like strangers in paradise, awed by the obvious elegance and expense the room reflects. \nPUPKIN (as though he owned it) How do you like it? \nRITA (admiringly) I could live here. \nPUPKIN (smiling proudly) It's the only way to live. \nRITA stands in the center of the room, ill at ease, while PUPKIN strolls about comfortably, picking up an ashtray here, a cigarette case there, inspecting the artifacts for inscriptions, clues, hints about LANGFORD's character and life. \nRITA How come he isn't here? \nPUPKIN You heard the guy.     He's out playing golf. \nRITA Didn't you tell him when we'd get here? \nPUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's suspicious inquiries effortlessly. \nPUPKIN We didn't have time to iron out the details. Now just relax. We're the first guests, that's all. \nRITA (interrupting) That Jonno character hadn't even heard of us! \nPUPKIN (a little irritated) It probably slipped Jerry's mind. He has better things to think about than what he tells his houseboy. \nRITA It's just not time way I expected it, that's all. \nThere is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation.      He has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room. \nRITA What do we do now? \nPUPKIN is looking    at a picture of an American Gothic couple standing in front    of a wood-frame house. As he comments on the pictures, the    CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind of slide-show of    LANGFORD's life. \nPUPKIN These are Jerry's parents. His father runs the Post office in Wolverine -- that's in North Dakota. \nPUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously held by the boy) staring at its master. \nPUPKIN This one was in Newsweek. He started giving these puppet shows when he was still in grade school. \nWE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a microphone with some celebrity. \nPUPKIN And this is from his quiz show in St. Louis. Can you believe it? \nRITA Sure I can. \nPUPKIN That was the name of the show. \nWE MOVE to a picture of LANGFORD smiling at JACK PAAR. \nPUPKIN And here's when he wrote for Jack Paar. He made a hundred and fifty a week and look at him now. \nAnother picture of LANGFORD with a group of women sitting in a studio. \nPUPKIN And this is his morning show. \nA picture of LANGFORD standing in a park with his two boys, eleven and eight. \nPUPKIN And his kids. He's divorced. \nRITA (gaily) Well, there's only one way to find out. \nRITA scampers over to the stairs and pauses on the first step. \nRITA You coming or not? \nRITA bounds up the stairs. \nPUPKIN Rita! \nCAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN up the stairs. \nCUT TO: \n75   INT:   UPSTAIRS - DAY \nThere is no sign of RITA. \nPUPKIN Where are you? \nThere is no answer. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN from room to room. They are all guest rooms, neat, pretty, clean. \nPUPKIN Come on, Rita. This isn't funny. \nFinally, PUPKIN opens the door to another room. \nCUT TO: \n76   INT:   A BEDROOM - DAY \nIt is clearly LANGFORD's bedroom with a few clothes strewn about, and other signs of being lived in. RITA lies on the bed. \nPUPKIN (shocked) What are you doing, Rita? \nRITA I love it! All those millions of women out there dying to change places with me right now. \nPUPKIN Come on.   We shouldn't be here. \nRITA Relax, will you. Let me have a little fun, for Christ's sake. \nRITA gets off the bed and runs into the john. \nCUT TO: \n77   INT:   A LAVISH BATHROOM - DAY \nRITA Look at this. It's nicer than my whole apartment. \nPUPKIN enters the large, beautifully done bathroom.   RITA examines her face in the mirror. \nPUPKIN (urgently) Let's go, Rita. \nRITA Boy, I really need some sun. \nPUPKIN Rita, this is Jerry's ... \nRITA Lay off, will you, Rupert. \nPUPKIN But we have no right ... \nRITA picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large dollop in PUPKIN's face. WE COME IN for a CLOSE UP of PUPKIN's face, buried under shaving cream. \nPUPKIN That wasn't funny, Rita. \nRITA hands him a towel. \nRITA Here. \nShe looks around. \nRITA Now for something that smells nice. \nShe swings open the cabinet with a flourish. The door swings open violently and the mirror shatters against something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink. PUPKIN and RITA stand there, staring at each other. RITA begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam of the downstairs door. \nCUT TO: \n78   INT:   THE FOYER \nLANGFORD has entered, drawn and businesslike.       JONNO and the COOK have moved out to greet him. \nLANGFORD (looking around) Where are they? \nJONNO I was going to call the police but then I thought to myself 'what if they are Mr. Langford's friends?' \nWe hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the stairs. LANGFORD, JONNO and the COOK look up. PUPKIN comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with RITA following cautiously behind. PUPKIN has large traces of shaving cream behind his ears and on his neck. \nPUPKIN Hi, Jerry.   We were just freshening up. \nPUPKIN stops at the base of the stairs, turns around, and waves RITA down. \nPUPKIN (to RITA) Come on, Rita. No need to be shy. \nPUPKIN smiles conspiratorially at LANGFORD.       RITA comes slowly down. \nLANGFORD realizes he is being hard.    He stops for a moment. \nLANGFORD I have my own life, that's all. \nPUPKIN But what about me, Jerry? What about my life? I made plans -- based on what you said. You can't just turn your back on me. \nLANGFORD I'm not telling you again. \nThere is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in. PUPKIN just stares at LANGFORD with disbelief that turns to anger. \nPUPKIN So this is the way it   works when you're big, huh? You    just play with people. Is that part    of the kick, Jerry? (pause) I can     see I was all wrong about you. All    wrong. \nRITA starts tugging at PUPKIN. \nRITA Come on, Rupert. \nPUPKIN (to RITA) Shut up! (to LANGFORD) You weren't my friend at all, were you? You were just playing some kind of game with me. Well, that's not going to stop me, Jerry. I'm just going to work a little bit harder, that's all, use a little bit more enterprise. And not count on anybody. That's where I made my mistake. I can see that now. \nPUPKIN picks up the pair of small suitcases. \nPUPKIN (glaring at LANGFORD) Come on, Rita. We're wasting our time. \nCUT TO: \n79   EXT.   LANGFORD'S FRONT DOOR - DAY \nPUPKIN strides out with RITA following.     She casts LANGFORD an apologetic glance as she goes. The     door slams behind them. They walk down the path silently     for a few moments as the CAMERA PULLS UP, following them    in an OVERHEAD SHOT. We hear them start talking as they make    their way towards the gate. \nRITA (baffled and angry) What did you think was going to happen? You think he'd just ... ? What's the matter with you? (pause) You can't just walk into a guy's house! And what about me? What did you ... \nPUPKIN (interrupting in a calm but firm voice) Shut up, Rita. I'm thinking. \nCUT TO: \n80   EXT:   OUTSIDE THE U.N. PLAZA - DAY \nCUT TO: \n81   INT:   A NEW MERCEDES BENZ - DAY \nMARSHA sits at the wheel of this lavishly appointed sedan, her face made up as though she were going to a fancy party. PUPKIN sits on the other side of the front seat. His ex- \npression has changed somewhat from the PUPKIN we have seen. He is less wide-eyed, less innocent, tougher. \nMARSHA (whining) How much longer?!? \nPUPKIN Do you want him or not? \nThere is a pause. \nMARSHA You sure he's in there? \nPUPKIN Certain. \nMARSHA (with obvious delight) My parents are going to be furious! \nPUPKIN pulls a toy revolver from his jacket pocket and looks it over. MARSHA glances at it. \nMARSHA It looks real. \nPUPKIN That's the whole point. (gesturing with his head towards the entrance of the building which is some 50 yards away) Pay attention. \nMARSHA looks towards the entrance.   A few beats pass. \nMARSHA What if he doesn't come down? \nPUPKIN He will. \nMARSHA But what if he doesn't? \nPUPKIN We'll come back tomorrow. \nMARSHA And wait again? \nPUPKIN Look, you're going to have him all to yourself. What else do you want? \nA MAN resembling LANGFORD walks out the entrance. \nPUPKIN \nIs that him?!? \nMARSHA No. \nPUPKIN You sure? \nMARSHA Sure I'm sure. That looks too much like him. \nPUPKIN What do you mean? \nMARSHA When it's him it doesn't look like him. \nPUPKIN Keep watching. \nof the moment thing.    Give me a little credit, will you. \nPUPKIN looks over to a small phone table with a chair next to it. He motions to it with his head. \nPUPKIN (to LANGFORD) Sit down. \nLANGFORD docilely sits by the phone. \nPUPKIN Now, you're going to call your office and tell them this: that unless a man who identifies himself as the King is allowed on the show tonight as the first guest, they'll never see you alive again. \nLANGFORD What? \nPUPKIN I'll say it again ... \nCUT TO: \n90   INT:   BERT THOMAS' OFFICE     - DAY \nIt is a large office in two pieces. A SECRETARY sits in the smaller part next to the door of the larger section. Her phone is ringing. She answers. \nTHOMAS' SECRETARY Bert Thomas! ... He's in a meeting, Mr. Langford ... I see. \nCUT TO: \n91   INT:   A CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nTHOMAS, a young, trim executive in his late thirties, in modish dress, sits at the table with several other PEOPLE, including CATHY LONG. They are sipping coffee from con- tainers. There are memos and lists and other papers on the table. The SECRETARY stands at the doorway. THOMAS and the others are looking up at her. \nSECRETARY He says it's urgent. \nTHOMAS (smiling) Yeah? Well, tell him I'll call him back. (to the others) It's that Martino kid, the impressionist. \nCUT TO: \n92   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nLANGFORD sits by the phone with PUPKIN a few steps away, holding the gun and MARSHA looking on. LANGFORD looks desperate. \nPUPKIN Then try again! \nCUT TO: \n93   INT:   BERT THOMAS' OFFICE - DAY \nAn irked BERT THOMAS wearily picks up the phone. \nTHOMAS Yeah? ... Okay, Martino, let's stop the bullshit ... what? ... Okay, I'm listening. \nWE WATCH THOMAS' expression as it turns from skepticism to concern bordering on alarm. \nTHOMAS Give me that again? ... Wait a minute. What do we call our second cameraman? \nCUT TO: \n94   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe scene is as before, only now LANGFORD is sweating a bit. \nLANGFORD (into the phone) Helen Keller. \nPUPKIN (warning) No tricks, Jerry. \nCUT TO: \n95   INT:   BERT THOMAS' OFFICE - DAY \nTHOMAS is still at the phone. \nTHOMAS Don't do anything, Jerry.     Stay right there. Tell him we'll do     anything he wants. Tell him to cool     it. Are you okay? ... Look, tell him    to call us about five, okay. We'll     let him know what to do. And don't do     anything stupid. \nTHOMAS puts down the phone. \nTHOMAS (calls to his SECRETARY) Vivien! \nTHOMAS' SECRETARY appears at the doorway. \nTHOMAS Get me the number of the F.B.I. right away. And get me Crockett's office. And keep your mouth shut about this. \nCUT TO: \n96   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nLANGFORD is standing awkwardly in the middle of the room, wearing a sweater that matches the patch of cloth we saw in the envelope MARSHA gave PUPKIN. PUPKIN is still training his pistol on LANGFORD and MARSHA is appraising the fit. \nMARSHA (to PUPKIN) What do you think? \nPUPKIN Looks fine. \nMARSHA (to LANGFORD) I had to guess on the sleeves. (to PUPKIN) He gets to keep it, doesn't he? \nPUPKIN Sure, if he isn't dead. \nCUT TO: \nTHOMAS (upset) Does this mean we're not supposed to put him on?!? \nPATTEN Who am I addressing, please? \nCROCKETT That's Bert Thomas. He produces the show. \nPATTEN I'm only saying, Mr. Thomas, that we can't allow this to reach the public. When the kidnappers call in, of course you're going to be cooperative. Promise them anything they want. After all, this King character is going to have to show up sooner or later. And once we get our hands on him, he'll tell us where Mr. Langford is. \nPATTEN grinds his fist into his palm. \nCUT TO: \n100   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nWE SEE PUPKIN in the shower, shampooing. \nCUT TO: \n101   INT:   THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE \nThe scene is as before. \nPATTEN Sure. Let him go on if you have to. It's just a taping. You can always erase him afterwards, can't you? (pause) All I'm saying is this: don't put him on the air. \nTHOMAS That's fine, Inspector, but let's say he finishes his bit and you've worked him over ... \nPATTEN Questioned him, Mr. Thomas. \nThere is light laughter. \nTHOMAS Okay, questioned him and he still won't talk. We get to eleven thirty and what do we do? Do we air him or what? \nThere is a heavy pause. \nPATTEN I would say no. \nTHOMAS But they might kill Jerry! \nCROCKETT (breaking in) Okay, Burt. (to PATTEN) Thank you, Inspector. We appreciate your position and we'll do all we can to cooperate with you.   But I have to tell you right now that, if it comes down to it, we're not taking any chances with Mr. Langford's life. \nPATTEN I understand but ... \nCROCKETT (interrupting) If your men haven't been able to locate Mr. Langford by air time, we're going to have to put this King guy on, no matter what he's said. After all, Inspector, what's ten or fifteen minutes of talk show time against a man's life? \nCUT TO: \n102   INT:     MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nWE SEE PUPKIN in his new suit and ruffled shirt, impeccably groomed, standing next to the bed. He is talking to LANGFORD but we don't see anyone but PUPKIN. \nPUPKIN Open. (pause) Bite ... Good. \nHe is wrapping LANGFORD's mouth shut but all we see is that he is doing something. \nPUPKIN Can you breathe? Both ways?         In and out? \nWE    PULL    BACK TO SEE LANGFORD    nodding. He is strapped to the    bed    with tape and encased    like a mummy, only his eyes and    nose    showing. PUPKIN has     wrapped him in tape from tip to    toe.     MARSHA emerges from    the kitchen stirring something. \nPUPKIN (to MARSHA) You've got until around midnight. Have a good time. (to LANGFORD) So long, Jerry! Wish me luck. \nPUPKIN leaves. \nCUT TO: \n103   INT:     BERT THOMAS' OFFICE - DAY \nThe phone rings.        BERT THOMAS' SECRETARY answers. \nTHOMAS' SECRETARY Bert Thomas! Who's calling please? (her voice grows tense) Yes, Mr. King. \nCUT TO: \n104   INT:     BERT THOMAS' DESK - DAY \nTHOMAS sits by his phone. There is           a large machine, looking like a large tape recorder,          attached to the phone and monitoring the call. GIARDELLO           is at a second phone and starts placing a call. PATTEN           stands next to THOMAS. There are two other PLAINCLOTHESMEN          in the room, CROCKETT and CATHY LONG. \nPATTEN (quietly to THOMAS) Keep him talking. \nTHOMAS nods and picks up the phone. \nTHOMAS Yes? ... Yes, Mr, King. We     understand. Everything's been arranged.     Now if you'll just tell me a little    about the nature of your material, so    that we can ... \nCUT TO: \n105   EXT:   UPPER EAST SIDE MANHATTAN STREET - DAY \nPUPKIN stands in a public phonebooth on a streetcorner. \nPUPKIN (into the phone) I'll tell you everything you need to know at the studio this evening, Mr. Thomas. I appreciate your co- operation. Goodbye. \nPUPKIN steps out of the booth and starts walking downtown. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \n114   EXT:   A MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK \nPUPKIN is crossing Broadway, a few blocks from the theater. \nCUT TO: \n115   INT:   STUDIO \nAt the center of the stage, a pretty MODEL used solely to test color quality sits in Langford's chair as several MEMBERS of the Tactical Patrol Force admire her considerable cleavage. A number of TECHNICIANS go about their work. CAMERAMEN move to and from their stations. \nCUT TO: \n116   INT:   CORRIDOR LEADING FROM THE BACKSTAGE DOOR TO THE STAGE \nFour PLAINCLOTHESMEN are gathered behind the stage door. They watch ZSA ZSA GABOR (or some other sexy talk show celebrity) enter and then return to talking among themselves. \nCUT TO: \n117   EXT:   THE TELEVISION THEATER - DAY TO EARLY EVENING \nThe situation appears normal. Only the regular backstage door GUARD, a big, grey-haired man, stands at the door. Nearby two other young MEN, in colorless suits, stand talking. We WATCH CLARENCE MCCABE, a writer, his plain WIFE and her PARENTS arrive in front of the theater, locate the backstage entrance and present themselves before the GUARD. \nMCCABE (a bit pompously) Good evening, officer. This is the backstage door I take it? \nGUARD Your name please? \nMCCABE Clarence McCabe, the writer. And this is Mrs. McCabe and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Solters of Cleveland. \nGUARD (checking his list) I'm sorry, sir. I don't see you here. \nMCCABE I'm on the show tonight, officer. \nGUARD Well, you're not here. \nMCCABE (getting a bit agitated) Look, Cathy Long gave me instructions to present myself at a quarter to six. May I see her please? \nGUARD I'm under strictest orders tonight to admit only authorized personnel. \nMCCABE (huffy) This is absurd. (to the others) Wait right here. \nMCCABE marches past the GUARD and rushes to the backstage door. He opens it. The GUARD trails behind. \nGUARD Stop him! \nCUT TO: \n118   INT:   THE BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - EVENING \nThe four PLAINCLOTHESMEN jump MCCABE and start pulling him downstairs. \nMCCABE Hey! \nCUT TO: \n119   EXT:   OUTSIDE THE THEATER - EVENING \nPUPKIN arrives at the backstage door.      Seeing no one, he walks in. \nCUT TO: \n120   INT:   A ROOM IN THE BASEMENT OF THE THEATER - EVENING \nMCCABE has just been hustled before PATTEN. \nPATTEN Are you the King? \nMCCABE looks baffled. \nCUT TO: \n121   INT:   BACKSTAGE - EVENING \nPUPKIN is looking for a familiar face.     He approaches a CAMERAMAN. \nPUPKIN (getting CAMERAMAN's attention) Excuse me. \nThe CAMERAMAN looks up. \nPUPKIN I'm the King. \nCAMERAMAN Yeah? \nCUT TO: \n122   INT:   THE BASEMENT ROOM - EVENING \nPATTEN is sitting behind a desk. MCCABE is standing before him, still securely held by four PLAINCLOTHESMEN. \nPATTEN Don't talk to me about tigers! \nCUT TO: \nPATTEN You're not going anywhere, Pupkin. Now, where is he? \nPUPKIN I'm telling you, Inspector,    if I don't see that show where I    want to see it, Jerry Langford is dead. My     people have instructions to execute    him unless they hear from me by    midnight. \nPATTEN glances apprehensively at GIARDELLO. \nPATTEN Just where is it you want to watch this show? \nCUT TO: \n141   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLANGFORD is half unwrapped now. The place is covered with yard after yard of tape.   MARSHA is working frantically to finish unwrapping LANGFORD who is helping now that his arms are free. \nLANGFORD Ow!   God damnit! Not so fast! \nMARSHA (working frantically) We haven't all night, baby. \nMARSHA rips the tape off LANGFORD. \nLANGFORD OW!!!! \nMARSHA Oh, I love you, baby.   I love you so much. \nCUT TO: \n142   EXT:   BROADWAY - NIGHT \nA limo drives down Broadway, followed by an unmarked car. \nCUT TO: \n143   INT:   THE LIMO - NIGHT \nPATTEN and GIARDELLO sit up front, with the DRIVER. PUPKIN sits in the back between two PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The limo pulls up in front of the bar-restaurant where RITA works. PATTEN turns around in the front seat to address PUPKIN. \nPATTEN Here we, are, Pupkin. I don't know what this is all about, but as soon as you've seen yourself, you're going to talk to us or I promise you, you'll never see daylight again. \nPUPKIN I'll need a couple of minutes, Inspector. \nPATTEN \nWhat?!? \nPUPKIN After it's over, I want a couple of minutes. And I'll need ten dollars. Does anyone of you gentlemen have my wallet? \nPATTEN Don't push me, Pupkin. \nPUPKIN A condemned man's last request, Inspector. \nPATTEN Well, I'll tell you right away, the answer is no, Pupkin. \nPUPKIN It's not much of a ransom, Inspector ... \nPATTEN (losing his temper) Look, I'm drawing the line, that's all! No ten dollars and that's it. (emphatically) No -- ten -- dollars!!!! You understand?!? \nPUPKIN (in mollifying tones) Sure. Sure, Inspector. No ten dollars ... \nPATTEN (appeased) Okay. \nPUPKIN ... and no Jerry Langford. \nThere is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself. \nPUPKIN Come on, it's getting late, Inspector. \nPATTEN (exploding to     one of his MEN) Go ahead. Give him      his goddamned ten dollars! Give him      twenty! I don't care. Just get him      out of here! \nOne of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the back opens the door and PUPKIN and the other PLAINCLOTHESMAN get out. The unmarked car has pulled up behind the limo and other PLAINCLOTHESMEN stand next to it. PUPKIN and the two PLAINCLOTHESMEN start walking the ten yards or so to the bar-restaurant. \nCUT TO: \n144   INT:   THE BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nPUPKIN marches in flanked by the PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The clock over the bar reads 11:30. RITA looks up from talking with a CUSTOMER and sees PUPKIN. She says nothing. She just looks at him. There are five CUSTOMERS at the bar. A working class COUPLE in their late fifties are half-stewed, the man telling the woman that her friend, Maud, isn't really her friend because she wants $150 for a used refrigerator. A few seats down, two MEN in their mid- forties, in wind-breakers are locked in an intense but inaudible conversation. And, close to the television set which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a MOUSY MAN with glasses, who looks like an accountant. He is sipping a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the CBS late movie is just showing its logo. PUPKIN marches up to the bar. \nPUPKIN (urgently to RITA) Turn on Langford. Seven. \nMOUSY MAN Hey!   I'm watching this. \nRITA keeps staring at PUPKIN. \nPUPKIN Just turn it. Come on. \nMOUSY MAN I was here first, mister. You can't just walk in like this. It isn't fair. \nRITA glances at the MAN. PUPKIN can't      wait. He vaults onto the bar and turns the set to the     Langford Show, just as, on screen, he walks from the wings     onto the stage to the applause of the studio audience.      Perched atop the bar, standing next to the image of himself,     PUPKIN looks down at RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on     his face. \nCUT TO: \n145   MONTAGE -- NIGHT \nPUPKIN walking onto television screens in various homes across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse, in a kitchen where a COUPLE is in the middle of a raging domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a COUPLE is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station house, in a television store window display. \n", "test1_input": "PUPKIN Me neither. I just carry them as a courtesy. How about a cough drop? \nLANGFORD (smiling indulgently) No thanks. I don't cough. \nPUPKIN I try not to but sometimes, you know ... Am I making any sense? \nLANGFORD (smiling) Go on. \nPUPKIN Well, that night you did Paar, I walked out of the theater like I was in a dream. All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted. I started catching your guest appearances on Sullivan and taping them and, when you got your own show, it got to be a kind of regular thing. I studied how you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like you were chatting, and how you delivered \nthe jokes without leaning too much on them, without saying \"here's the punchline, folks.\" And I watched the way you played off dead audiences, how you let those long silences build until people couldn't stand it and then the way you got them off the hook with that slow smile. You were my college of comedy, Jerry, like a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it sounds crazy, but when you watch someone every night ... But that's all in the past. What I'm trying to say is this. I'm ready now. I've finished the course. And I'm thinking as we sit here talking \"Is this it? Is this that one big break?\" Is it, Jerry? \nThere is a long pause. \nPUPKIN Jerry? \nLANGFORD Look ... er ... what was the name? \nPUPKIN I'm Rupert, Jerry. \nLANGFORD Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying. But things don't work that way. You can't just walk onto a network show without any experience. You've got to start at the bottom ... \nPUPKIN But that's where I am! \nLANGFORD You've got to work your way up, learn your trade in front of live audiences, start playing the little clubs. \nPUPKIN But that can take years, Jerry! Look at me. I'm already 31 years old! People my age are way ahead of me. I've got some catching up to do and I need your help. What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking you to do is listen to my act. That's all. Is that asking too much? \nLANGFORD I get calls from agents every day. All they want ... \nPUPKIN I tried getting an agent.   I did, Jerry. \nBut you know how it is. You can't get an agent unless you're working and you can't get work unless you've got an agent ... or unless you know somebody. And the only person I know is you, Jerry. \nThere is a long pause. \nLANGFORD Look, why don't you call my office. \nPUPKIN Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that, Jerry. You don't know how many times I've had this conversation in my head. And this is the way it always turns out. That's why I had to sort of invite myself into the car tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous and I really appreciate the time you've given me. But breaks like this don't just happen. You have to make your own breaks. \nThe limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows. \n3   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA APARTMENTS - NIGHT \nLANGFORD turn to PUPKIN,    looking to get rid of him as cleanly and gracefully as    possible. LANGFORD extends his hand. PUPKIN goes to     shake it but his hand is wrapped in the handkerchief. He     extends his left hand. LANGFORD shakes it awkwardly. \nLANGFORD Nice meeting you, Rupert.   I hope it all works out for you. \nPUPKIN Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay you. I'm a little short on cash this evening, but, if you don't mind some good, hearty food, I'd be honored to take you to dinner. \nLANGFORD Thanks, but some people are waiting for me. \nPUPKIN Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could repay you with a joke. \nLANGFORD is starting to walk into the building. \nPUPKIN Wait a minute. How's this? The      first night you do your show from the coast,    you open this way. \"Good evening, ladies    and gentlemen, it's great to be back    here in \nSouthern California where you can wake up in the morning and listen to the birds coughing ... \" \nLANGFORD (nodding but unsmiling) Not bad. Maybe. \nPUPKIN calls after LANGFORD who heads for the entrance to his building. \nPUPKIN Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry! How about lunch? My treat! \nLANGFORD (turning back before he enters the building) Call my office. \nPUPKIN waves with his bandaged hand, notices LANGFORD's handkerchief and unwraps it. \nPUPKIN (to the handkerchief) Thanks, Jerry. \nThe CAMERA MOVES IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN in a kind of daze. \nFADE TO: \n4   INT:   SARDI'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nPUPKIN and LANGFORD stand at the edge of the foyer, waiting for the Maitre d' to seat them. VINCENT, the owner, spots them and hurries over. \nVINCENT I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. (To PUPKIN, angrily) How did you get in? \nLANGFORD That's alright, Vincent.   Mr. Pupkin's a friend of mine. \nVINCENT (puzzled) Oh, I see. \nPUPKIN That's alright. Now if you'd be good enough to find us a nice table. \nPUPKIN pushes a five dollar bill into VINCENT's hand. \nVINCENT Certainly.   This way, please. \nVINCENT leads PUPKIN and LANGFORD to the \"bullpen,\" a select spot in a corner of the restaurant. \n", "test1_true": "LANGFORD Is Eddie here today, Vincent? \nVINCENT I'll send him over. \nA WAITER arrives and hands them the menu. \nWAITER Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua a la Marinara con Spezi. Very good. \nPUPKIN Sounds like a new opera. \nLANGFORD Fine.   What comes with it? \nWAITER Me. \nThe three laugh. \nPUPKIN Fine.   For two. \nWAITER Very good. \nThe WAITER leaves. \nPUPKIN You look tired, Jerry. \nLANGFORD It shows, does it? It's all these problems with the show. That and the custody suit. \nPUPKIN I was sorry to read about that, Jerry. Charlene never should have gotten the kids. If there's anything I can do. \nLANGFORD I appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about it a little with you helps. \nEddie arrives. He     is a small, slightly-bald man with greying hair and a    goatee. He wears a foulard under an open-necked shirt.     He carries a long sketch pad. He immediately sets up    a small easel and starts sketching. \nPUPKIN Hasn't Eddie already done you? \nLANGFORD Never mind. You were saying ... \nPUPKIN Well, I've been giving a lot of thought to your situation, Jerry, ever since I saw you starting to lose ground in the ratings. And I think I know what the problem is. Too many of the same faces. \nLANGFORD Yeah? \nPUPKIN Sure, people are getting tired of these people who live off game shows and talk shows and can't really do anything. They've seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't stand it anymore. \nLANGFORD You know, maybe you're right, Rube. \nPUPKIN I'm sure I am. When a show runs out of surprises, it loses its audience. \nA YOUNG GIRL stands before PUPKIN and LANGFORD.   She hands PUPKIN her autograph book. \nPUPKIN What's your name, dear? \nGIRL Dolores. \nPUPKIN (writing) To Dolores, who sensed greatness. Rupert Pupkin. \nGIRL (reading it) Thanks, Mr. Pupkin. \nThe GIRL leaves. \nPUPKIN You see what I mean? What you need on the show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant talent making his television debut. Imagine the suspense. Who is this young guy? How will he do with the eyes of all America on him? Something like that has got to help. \nLANGFORD And that's where you come in. \nPUPKIN Why not? Believe me,     Jerry, I'd give you the credit you deserve    and I'll stick with you. Anytime you need     me, I'll be there, doing a few minutes at    Guild scale. \nLANGFORD I'd be grateful, Rube.     I really would. \nEDDIE All finished, Mr. Langford. \nEDDIE turns the caricature so PUPKIN and LANGFORD can see it. It's a picture of the two of them, facing each other and smiling. \nPUPKIN Oh, Jerry, you sneaky ... \nLANGFORD Looks good, Eddie. \nThe WAITER arrives with a bottle of champagne. \nPUPKIN What's this? \nWAITER Compliments of Mr. Sardi. \nEDDIE hangs the picture of LANGFORD and PUPKIN on the wall behind them among the hundreds of other caricatures -- from Bankhead to Sid Caesar to Bette Davis. The CAMERA PANS over these. We hear the champagne pop. \nPUPKIN'S VOICE How does your afternoon look? \nLANGFORD'S VOICE What have you got in mind? \nPUPKIN'S VOICE Well, we've still got time to catch the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea. \nLANGFORD'S VOICE Why not? But first, a toast. To you, Rube and your success. \nPUPKIN'S VOICE Thanks, Jerry. \nFADE TO: \n", "test2_input": "CATHY LONG I'm Bert Thomas' assistant. \nPUPKIN Bert Thomas? \nCATHY LONG He's our executive producer. \nPUPKIN Oh, yes. I'm sure he is. But, you see, I've already talked directly with Jerry about my being on the show and he told me to get in touch with him. I'm just here to follow up on that. \nCATHY LONG What do you do, Mr. Pupkin? \nPUPKIN \nStand-up comedy. \nCATHY LONG Fine.    Where are you working? \nPUPKIN Well, right now I'm developing new material. \nCATHY    LONG I see. Well, as     soon as you start performing again,    let us know where you are and I'll    send my assistant down to check you    out. \nPUPKIN Sure. Sure. But that's not necessary, Miss Long. Jerry and I already went over all this. \nCATHY LONG Does Jerry know your work? \nPUPKIN (nodding) Yes.    I don't think he does. \nCATHY LONG You don't happen to have a tape or a demo that we might listen to? \nPUPKIN Oh, sure. I've got lots of tapes. That's no problem. \nCATHY LONG Good. Why don't you just send one to us and I assure you we'll listen to it promptly. \nPUPKIN Great. I'll do that. I can see that'd be a lot easier for Jerry. Thanks a lot, Miss Long. \nCATHY LONG Don't mention it, Mr. Pupkin.     Now, if you'd excuse me ... \nPUPKIN Sure.    Sure. Thanks again. \nCATHY LONG leaves. PUPKIN, left standing there, smiles at the RECEPTIONIST who returns another professional smile. \nPUPKIN (to the RECEPTIONIST) Thanks. \nCUT TO: \n42   EXT:   THE UPPER-BROADWAY HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nPUPKIN comes out of the building elated. He is immediately confronted by MARSHA. PUPKIN continues to walk as MARSHA skips beside him. \nMARSHA I've got to speak to you for a minute. I'm Marsha. \nPUPKIN Yeah.   I know. \nMARSHA Look. Did Jerry say anything about me last night? \nPUPKIN I'm really in a hurry, Marsha ... \nMARSHA Was he angry? ... In the car last night, I saw you. Did he talk about me? \nPUPKIN I thought that was you.     That was some stunt. \nMARSHA What did he say? \nPUPKIN We didn't talk about you. \nMARSHA You know Jerry? \nPUPKIN Yeah. \nMARSHA thrusts an envelope into PUPKIN's hands. \nMARSHA Give him this for me. \nPUPKIN Why don't you ... \nMARSHA Because I can't! Please. I need your help. You'll be my friend forever. Come on. I'll buy you something. What do you want? \nShe takes a great messy bunch of bills out of her raincoat \npockets and jams them into PUPKIN's hands. \nPUPKIN I don't want this. \nMARSHA Take it.   I can get all I want. \nPUPKIN shrugs and pockets the money. \nPUPKIN Okay.   I'll try. \nMARSHA (turning cold) Don't try. Do it.       Remember.   We just made a deal. \nPUPKIN stares at the envelope. \nMARSHA And don't open it.    It's private. \n", "test2_true": "MARSHA How soon can you get it to him? \nPUPKIN I don't know. Couple a days. \nMARSHA (menacingly) You'd better. \nMARSHA turns and walks in the direction from which they came. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN who walks on for a block or so, then opens the envelope. It contains a set of apartment keys, a scrap of hand-knitted woolen cloth and a note in lipstick that reads: \"I've made you a sweater, honey. Come try it on. I miss you. Love, M. 74 East 83rd Street, Apartment 2B!\" He takes out the money MARSHA gave him. There are wads of tens, twenties and fifties with a sprinkling of fives and ones. \nCUT TO: \n44   EXT:   A TIMES SQUARE HOTEL - DAY \nThe hotel is just one step up from a flophouse. WE SEE PUPKIN enter. \nCUT TO: \n45   INT:   PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY \nPUPKIN enters. WE SEE that it is a small room, furnished by the hotel in the plainest way. Nicely-done home-made collages of show business figures decorate the drab green walls. The room is neat and clean. PUPKIN goes directly to a plain table which holds two tape recorders -- one a small cassette the other a large table tape recorder. He picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into it. \nPUPKIN Testing.   Testing.   Testing. \nIn the following montage, we hear in the background the replay of his \"testing, testing testing\" and various other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward, a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room.    We look at the collages which include all the obvious show business figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black, Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray. There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters, Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians, treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked, i.e., \"LANGFORD MONOLOGUES:    7/5/72 to 9/9/72.\" \"MISC. MONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69.\" \nCUT TO: \nPUPKIN sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought. Finally, he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike. \nPUPKIN First, Miss Long. Thanks very much for your help at the office and for passing this along to Jerry. I appreciate it more than you know. \nPUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few beats. He then starts the large recorder. \nPUPKIN Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just want to thank you for listening to this material and for the opportunity that you've given me. You know, lots of people think that guys like you, you know, people who have made it, lose their feeling for struggling \nyoung talent such as myself. But now I know from experience that those people are just cynics, embittered by their own failure. I know, Jerry, that you're as human as the rest of us, if not more so. (pause) Oh well, I guess there's no point going on about it. You know how I feel. So let's get on with the show.   The best of Rupert Pupkin! I've sketched out this little introduction in order to save you a little time. So close your eyes and imagine it's exactly six o'clock. You're standing in the wings and we hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike up your theme song. \nPUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the theme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the voice of BERT CANTER, the announcer. \nBERT CANTER'S VOICE And now, direct from New York, it's the Jerry Langford Show! Tonight, with Jerry's special guest ... \nPUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his own voice for that of CANTER's. The large tape recorder keeps rolling. \nPUPKIN ... the comedy find of the year making his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the King of Comedy! \nPUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes down the \"play\" button. We hear a burst of thundering applause. PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and then shuts it off. The large recorder keeps rolling. \nPUPKIN Now you come on, Jerry, and do your monologue. Then, when the time comes, this is how I see you introducing me. You'll say something like this. \"Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to do something a little bit different tonight. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think after you've met my next guest, that you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness. So, now, will you please give your warmest welcome to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!\" \nPUPKIN pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous burst of applause. PUPKIN lets it run, listening intently. He stands up and faces a wall of his room, still holding the microphone. WE SEE that the wall is covered by a huge blow-up of an audience laughing and applauding. \nCUT TO: \n45   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT \nWE SEE a real audience laughing and applauding. \nCUT TO: \nPUPKIN strides triumphantly onto the stage, nodding to acknowledge the applause. He stops center stage as the television cameras maneuver about him. \nCUT TO: \nA SHOT of the \"APPLAUSE\" sign flashing, then stopping. Still, the applause goes on. \nCUT TO: \nPUPKIN    raises his hands to quiet the audience. After a few moments    the applause dies down, except for a pair of hands in the    center of the orchestra. PUPKIN peers out to see who is    still applauding. \nCUT TO: \nRITA, in the middle of the audience, applauds enthusiastically. \nCUT TO: \nPUPKIN on stage.    PUPKIN gives RITA a special smile and nod. \nPUPKIN Will somebody tell that lovely lady that the applause sign is off. \nThe audience laughs. \nCUT TO: \n46   INT:   PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY \nPUPKIN stands facing the \"audience\" still holding the mike. \nPUPKIN That's a possible introduction, Jerry. Now let's move on to my act. \nCUT TO: \n47   INT:   THE RECEPTION AREA OF THE LANGFORD SHOW - DAY \nPUPKIN is pacing. He is wearing another suit, this one a broad-lapelled-grey. He is freshly shaved, is hair neatly combed, his shoes carrying a bright shine. He clutches a small flat box, neatly wrapped with the words 'FOR JERRY LANGFORD\" written clearly across the top in large print. CATHY LONG emerges from one of the back corridors into the reception area. \n", "test3_input": "MARSHA has finished a half bottle of wine. She is eating a beautifully decorated piece of stuffed capon and talking through her tears. \nMARSHA (crying) It was the second lead! I'd never gotten a part in my life and here I get the second lead. And what does Daddy say? \nSHOT of LANGFORD still bound from tip to toe. \nMARSHA Not \"Marsha, that's wonderful\" or \"we're proud of you\" or anything. Oh no. He starts lecturing me on how I should have tried out for Emily! Now do you understand, Jerry! \nMARSHA gets hold of herself. She swallows a couple of pills and swills them down with some wine. \nMARSHA (calmer) My doctor says I shouldn't get excited. \nMARSHA picks at another piece of capon. \nMARSHA This is the best I ever made it. You want some? \nLANGFORD, the mummy, nods. MARSHA picks up the plate across from her, fills it with food, and pulls a chair up next to LANGFORD. She undoes the tape around his mouth and picks a sock out of his mouth. \nMARSHA Now open.   Marsha's going to feed her Jerry. \nCUT TO: \n127   INT:   BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nTwo young GIRLS are working on big cue cards copying from the piece of paper PUPKIN has given THOMAS. TONY RANDALL stands next to THOMAS. The two of them watch. RANDALL is going over the lines. \nCUT TO: \n128   INT:   THE BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT \nPUPKIN has obviously been worked over.   He is sweating. \nPATTEN How about it, King? \nPUPKIN If I'm not on that show, Jerry Langford is dead, I promise you. \nPATTEN nods to his PLAINCLOTHESMEN again who start working PUPKIN over. \nCUT TO: \n129   INT:   THE TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT \nThe beginning of the taping is seconds away. Everyone is in his place. The STAGE MANAGER is counting down from five on his fingers. At zero, he points across to RICK ROSS, the orchestra leader, who strikes up the familiar Langford Show theme song. \nCUT TO: \n130   INT:   THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nFour TECHNICAL ENGINEERS are seated along a large console containing a multitude of small television screens. One screen shows the spotlight falling where Randall will enter. Another shows the logo of the Langford Show. Another shows nothing in particular. Behind the TECHNICIANS, stand CROCKETT and the EXECUTIVES we have seen in the previous scenes. A TECHNICIAN is giving instructions to the CAMERAMAN. \nTECHNICIAN Hold on two. Hold. Hold.    Come on, Keller. Get it framed! \nCUT TO: \n131   INT:   THE TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT \nThe theme song is playing.   BERT CANTER stands off-camera \nat one side of the stage before a microphone. \nCANTER Now! Direct from New York! It's the Jerry Langford Show with guest host Tony Randall and his special guests -- Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, pundit Gore Vidal, the one and only Zsa Zsa Gabor and another of Jerry's taped exclusives, an interview with Prince Ranier of Monaco. As always, Rick Ross and the Orchestra and me, Bert Canter. And now ... say hello to Tony!!!!!! \nCUT TO: \nAn APPLAUSE sign flashes like crazy. The AUDIENCE cheers wildly. In the back, we notice a handful of TACTICAL PATROLMEN scattered about. RANDALL strides on stage briskly, accepting the cheers of the crowd with his arms raised. He nods and then his eyes fix on those hastily written outsized cue cards. He reads them with a mixture of professionalism and wry distance, wanting to disown the words without seeming silly. \nRANDALL Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have some sad news for you. Earlier today, my writing staff was executed in Central Park by the network firing squad so there'll be no sensational Randall monologue this evening. \nThe AUDIENCE cheers derisively. \nRANDALL No embarrassing displays of emotion, please. (the AUDIENCE laughs) Instead, we're going to do something a little bit different this evening -- a lot different if you ask me. We're going to give you a glimpse into the future. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think tonight, after you've met my first guest, you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness -- in one way or another. So will you please give your warmest greeting to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!! \nThe music plays. The APPLAUSE sign flashes. The AUDIENCE applauds heartily -- and nobody appears to fill the spotlight at the edge of the wings. The spotlight holds \nfor what seems like an eternity. \nCUT TO: \n132   INT:   CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nTECHNICIAN Just hold.   Three. Pick up the audience. \nCUT TO: \n133   INT:   THE STAGE - NIGHT \nFinally after what seems like an eternity, PUPKIN emerges, straightening his jacket a bit and trying to crane the kinks out of his neck. He is a bit tense but very high and in full command. As he delivers his monologue, PUPKIN is more confident, comfortable and self-assured than we have ever seen him. \nPUPKIN Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Let me introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton, New Jersey, which was not, at that time, a federal offense. (laughter) Is there anyone here from Clifton? (silence) Good. We can all relax. Now, I'd like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton. Once you fall below eleven thousand you're exiled to Passaic. My parents did, in fact, put down the first two payments on my childhood. Then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective.   But, like everyone else I grew up in large part thanks to my mother. If she was only here today I'd say, \"Hey, mom. What are you doing here? You've been dead for nine years?\" (laughter) You should have seen my mother. She was wonderful -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic. (laughter) We used to drink milk together after school. Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded. (laughter) Once she was picked up for speeding. They clocked her doing fifty -- in our garage. (laughter) When they tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood. They took away her license and she died shortly afterwards. We used to joke together Mom and me, until the tears would stream down her face and she'd \nthrow up. (laughter) And who would clean it up? Not Dad. He was too busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on his own. In fact, until I was sixteen, I thought throwing up was a sign of maturity. While the other kids were off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I was hiding behind the house with my fingers down my throat. (laughter) I never got anywhere until one day, my father caught me. Just as he was giving me a final kick in the stomach, for luck, I managed to heave all over his new shoes. \"That's it,\" I thought. \"I've made it. I'm finally a man!\" (laughter) As it turned out, that was the only time my father ever paid any real attention to me. He was usually too busy out in the park playing ball with my sister, Rose. And, today thanks to those many hours of practice, my sister Rose has grown into a fine man. (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially interested in athletics. The only exercise I ever got was when the other kids picked on me. They used to beat me up once a week, usually Tuesday. After a while, the school worked it into the curriculum. And, if you knocked me out, you got extra credit. (laughter) Except there was this one kid who was afraid of me. I kept telling him, \"Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter with you? Don't you want graduate?\" As for me, I was the only kid in the history of the school to graduate in traction. The school nurse tucked my diploma into my sling. But my only real interest, right from the beginning, was show business. Even as a young man, I began at the very top, collecting autographs. (laughter) \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "Dinner is over. MARSHA is sitting next to LANGFORD. As LANGFORD speaks, it is obvious that he is turning on the charm for strategic reasons. \nLANGFORD That was a wonderful dinner, Marsha. I want you to know how much I enjoyed it. \nMARSHA We can do it again. \nLANGFORD I'd like to show you my gratitude. But it's a little difficult, like this. \nLANGFORD indicates his bonds. \nMARSHA. (in a tone of intimacy) Let's say I took all this off.   What would you do to me? Tell me. \nCUT TO: \n135   INT:   THE TELEVISION STUDIO -- NIGHT \nWe break in on a great burst of laughter.      PUPKIN is just finishing his monologue. \nPUPKIN A lot of you are probably wondering why Jerry couldn't make it this evening. Well, he's tied up -- and I'm the one who tied him. (laughter) You think I'm joking, but that's the only way I could break into show business -- by hijacking Jerry Langford. (laughter) I'm not kidding. Right now, Jerry Langford is strapped to a bedstead somewhere in the middle of this city. (laughter) Go ahead. Laugh. But the fact is ... I'm here. Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding and you'll think I was crazy. But I figured it this way: better to be King for a Night than Schmuck for a Lifetime!!! (laughter) Good night ladies and gentlemen. God bless you. \nThe AUDIENCE applauds heartily. The music plays. And TONY RANDALL salutes PUPKIN with a wave of his hand. PUPKIN goes off stage after soaking up the applause. \nCUT TO: \n136   INT:   THE WINGS - NIGHT \nA group of PLAINCLOTHESMEN seize PUPKIN and march him briskly through the backstage corridor towards the backstage door. \nCUT TO: \n137   EXT:   THE BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHT \nA handful of PEOPLE are waiting, among them the autograph hunters, MAE, CELESTE and SIDNEY. MAE, out of a reflex of thirty years, immediately extends her autograph book towards PUPKIN, then, recognizing him, immediately pulls it back. \nMAE (to PUPKIN) Who did you get? \nPUPKIN says nothing as he is hustled into a limousine. SIDNEY and CELESTE look on. MAE trails after PUPKIN and the PLAINCLOTHESMEN. \nMAE (to PLAINCLOTHESMAN) Could I have a ride? \nThe PLAINCLOTHESMAN says nothing and starts getting in the limo. \nMAE I've never been in one. \nThe limo pulls away. \nCUT TO: \n138   INT:   INSPECTOR PATTEN'S DOWNTOWN OFFICE - NIGHT \nPUPKIN stands among a crowd of PLAINCLOTHESMEN who have obviously been working him over. PATTEN sits behind his desk. GIARDELLO is at his side. The clock on the wall reads 10:20. \nPATTEN Okay, Pupkin. We'll start all over again. Where is Langford? You know, we're going to find him sooner or later. \nPUPKIN I'm trying to tell    you, Inspector. You let me walk out    of here, right? And as soon as I'm    seen my act on the show -- as soon    as I'm sure they've really put it on --    I'll tell you where Jerry is and you'll    get him back safe and sound. \nPATTEN Fine, Pupkin. Then why don't you watch the show here with us? That way we're all happy. (to GIARDELLO) What channel? \nGIARDELLO Seven. \nPATTEN We get that one in fine.    So what do you say, Pupkin? \nPUPKIN Look, I'll say it again.    You let me go now. \nPATTEN motions to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN wearily with his head. They drag PUPKIN off. PATTEN looks up at the clock. \nCUT TO: \n139   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMARSHA is frantically attempting to unwrap LANGFORD. With each pull of the tape, LANGFORD yelps. There is a small tangle of unwrapped tape collecting around LANGFORD's feet and sticking to MARSHA's clothes. \nLANGFORD Watch my hair! \nMARSHA I'm sorry, baby. \nWe hear the sound of tape ripping. \nLANGFORD Ow! \nMARSHA I'm sorry. \nCUT TO: \n140   INT:   PATTEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nPUPKIN is hustled before PATTEN again. \nA PLAINCLOTHESMAN Still nothing. \nPUPKIN glances at the clock.      It is 11:05. \nPUPKIN I've got to get out of here. \n"}

Thanks. Just tell me the ones you think should go. That would be a big help. (to the RECEPTIONIST) This is great. (to CATHY LONG) Which ones? \nCATHY LONG Well, it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin. You see, Jerry likes to panel his guests, you know, chat with them afterwards. \nPUPKIN Sure.   Sure. \nCATHY LONG And frankly, we just don't feel you've got very much to talk about right now. \nPUPKIN But I've got my whole life to talk about! \nCATHY LONG Which is interesting to you, I'm sure and to your wife ... and to a few friends. But we feel that you should keep developing your act. Test it in some live situations. There are a number of clubs in the city you can \ntry. And after a reasonable period, get in touch with us again and we'll be glad to send someone down to check out your progress. \nPUPKIN stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows. \nPUPKIN May I ask you a question, Miss Long? \nCATHY LONG Of course. \nPUPKIN Are you speaking for Jerry? \nCATHY LONG Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin. Mr. Langford has complete faith in our judgment. \nPUPKIN I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss Long, and I certainly don't want you to take it personally, but I have to tell you that I don't ... I don't have faith in your judgment. \nCATHY LONG Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's nothing that can be done about that. \nPUPKIN No ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have to disagree with you again. \nCATHY LONG (with strained politeness) That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin. Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I have some things to do. I'm sorry the news isn't better. \nCATHY LONG turns to go. \nPUPKIN Miss Long? \nCATHY LONG turns back. \nPUPKIN When are you expecting Jerry in? \nCATHY LONG He won't be in until very late this afternoon. \nPUPKIN That's fine. Thank you. \nCATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST. The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN. PUPKIN continues sitting there. \nRECEPTIONIST Is there anyone else you would like to see? \nPUPKIN That's alright. I'm happy just waiting. \nA few beats pass in silence. \nRECEPTIONIST Well, would you mind waiting outside, please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception area, not a waiting room. \nPUPKIN I understand. \nPUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He goes over to PUPKIN, who stands. \nOFFICIAL Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of security for the Langford organization. \nWIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down the corridor and into the elevator. \nWIRTZ Now I think you understand that we have certain rules here that are essential to the smooth functioning of our operation. \nPUPKIN Sure.     Sure. \nWIRTZ And that without these rules, we really wouldn't be able to function at our best. You follow my point? \nPUPKIN nods. \nWIRTZ Now one of these rules is that only authorized personnel and those having official business with our organization are permitted on our premises. And that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin, to cooperate with us. \nThey have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the button. \nPUPKIN You want me to leave the building. \nWIRTZ That's right. It's nothing personal, Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job. \nThe elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in. \nWIRTZ Have a pleasant day. \nCUT TO: \n55   EXT:   STREET OUTSIDE THE LANGFORD BUILDING - DAY \nPUPKIN comes out and takes up a position outside the door, preparing to wait for LANGFORD. MARSHA sees him and comes over to him. \n", "test1_true": "PUPKIN (out of a daze) Huh? \nMARSHA Did you get my letter to him? \nPUPKIN He's not in there. \nMARSHA Look, if you don't want to give it him, okay. I'll get somebody else. But don't try to con me. \nPUPKIN I told you I'd try and I will. I'm going to wait for him right here. \nMARSHA Give me the envelope, huh? \nPUPKIN Sure, but ... \nMARSHA I saw him go in myself! \nPUPKIN Who? \nMARSHA Jerry! \nPUPKIN But they said he wasn't in. \nMARSHA Just give me the envelope. \nPUPKIN When did he go in? \nMARSHA Ten minutes ago! That's when. \nPUPKIN You sure? \nMARSHA Look, I saw him my ... \nPUPKIN And he hasn't come out? \nMARSHA I've been standing right here.      Now how about it? \nPUPKIN turns and goes back into the building.       MARSHA yells after him. \nMARSHA I'm staying right here! \nCUT TO: \n56   INT:   RECEPTION AREA OF THE JERRY LANGFORD OFFICES \nPUPKIN enters briskly and goes up to the RECEPTIONIST. \nPUPKIN (with authority) Tell Jerry Langford I'm here, please. \nRECEPTIONIST I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Langford's not in. \nPUPKIN I happen to know he is.      So would you \nplease tell him I'm here. \nRECEPTIONIST I'm sorry.   He's not in. \nPUPKIN You're putting your job on the line, lady. \nThe RECEPTIONIST starts making a call inside. PUPKIN glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors. He starts peering into the open doors of the offices that line the corridor. The whole place is like a gigantic maze. OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by him, taking no notice of him. He continues wandering around desperately, completely lost. A few beat later, he spots WIRTZ leading a pair of SECURITY GUARDS. PUPKIN keeps peering into offices quickly as he flees. The GUARDS and WIRTZ finally catch up to PUPKIN at the steno pool and, after a brief chase around the pool, they catch PUPKIN and subdue him. They start dragging him out past the eyes of the OFFICE PERSONNEL. \nPUPKIN (calling as he is dragged) Jerry! Jerry! (to WIRTZ) You're going the have a hell of a lot of explaining to do! (calling) Jerry! \nWIRTZ You had your warning, Mr. Krupkin. \nPUPKIN Jerry!   Help me. Jerry! \nCUT TO: \nA CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN as he is dragged out. \nPUPKIN (screaming) Jerry! \nCUT TO: \n57   EXT:   LANGFORD BUILDING LOBBY AND EXIT - DAY \nWE WATCH the SECURITY GUARDS and WIRTZ pitch PUPKIN out into the street. \nWIRTZ If we see your face again, Mr. Pupkin, we'll call the police. \nPUPKIN Start looking for a new job! \nMARSHA comes straight up to PUPKIN who is brushing himself off. His eyes are glazed and distant. \nMARSHA Well? \nPUPKIN Huh? \nMARSHA Does he have it? \nPUPKIN (abstractedly) Don't worry. I'll get it to him. \nMARSHA Yeah?   When? \n", "test1_id": 231, "test2_input": "There is a pause. \nPUPKIN This weekend. He asked me to go out there, to his house. \nCUT TO: \n58   THE BAR-RESTAURANT WHERE RITA WORKS - DAY \nPUPKIN enters the bar-restaurant. Through the window WE SEE him talking to RITA. He is voluble, animated. She looks skeptical, with a wry smile on her face. Finally WE WATCH him extract an answer from her. She shrugs, smiles and says yes. He comes walking out the door, his hounded expression softened by a smile. \nCUT TO: \n59   INT:   THE FITTING AREA OF A MEN'S STORE - DAY \nWE WATCH PUPKIN getting fitted in a new suit, attended by a SALESMAN and a TAILOR. \nCUT TO: \n60   INT:   LUGGAGE SHOP - DAY \nWE WATCH PUPKIN buy a suitcase. \nCUT TO: \n61   INT:   CARTIER'S JEWELERS - DAY \nWE WATCH PUPKIN perusing the beautiful diamond, sapphire, and emerald rings and we take a few moments to PAN OVER these beautiful jewels as he sees them. Finally, he picks out a splendid ring with a single, middle-sized sapphire and hands a surprised SALESLADY the money in cash. \nCUT TO: \n62   INT:   SUBURBAN TRAIN - DAY \nPUPKIN and RITA are seated side by side. Since it is Saturday morning, the train is sparsely populated. A CONDUCTOR has just finished taking PUPKIN's tickets. RITA is edgy. PUPKIN is strangely calm and a little remote. He is wearing his new suit. \nRITA What are we going to do? \nPUPKIN (patiently) Look, I told you, I've got some work to discuss with him. That's all. \nRITA But what about me? \nPUPKIN You're with me. \nRITA That's fine, but while you two are talking, what am I going to do? \nPUPKIN You can chat with the other guests. \nRITA I'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing about the wonderful world of draft beer. (pause) Let's tell 'em I'm a model, okay? \nPUPKIN What? \nRITA If they ask what I do, let's just say I model. You don't mind pretending just a little, do you? \nPUPKIN If it make you feel better. \nThere is a pause. \nRITA This is    a gas! Too bad nobody'll believe    it. (pause) After you guys are done    working, what happens? Are we going    out someplace, or what? \nPUPKIN I'm sure Jerry has something arranged. \nThere is another pause. \nRITA What do    these people do for fun? Do they    party or do freaky things or just    get drunk or ... I mean, What do    they do? \nPUPKIN I guess they just sit around and talk and enjoy each other's company, like anybody else. \nRITA Talk?!? What can you talk about for three or four hours?! \nPUPKIN What do    you mean? They've got plenty to talk    about. They do things.    All kinds of    interesting things happen to them    and then they talk about them. What do    you think Jerry's show is all about? \nRITA Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks. That's what all those shows are. At least they help you get to sleep. \nThere is a pause. \nRITA (glumly) Boy, this is going to be some great weekend.   I thought we were gonna have some fun. \nPUPKIN (smiling) Just take it easy, Rita.     Everything's going to be fine. \nWE MOVE IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN who is fading out. \nFADE TO: \n63   EXT:   A NEO-CLASSICAL MANSION \nIt is a large white house with colonial columns set in the middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are punctuated with fine old trees. We circle around to the back where LANGFORD, a handful of his FRIENDS (which can be familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio. A pair of SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and desert as the scene unfolds. As we arrive, we hear a loud burst of laughter. PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with \nstories. \nPUPKIN Oh, you have no idea how bad it's gotten in New York. Now the muggers are so efficient that, each time they jump you, they take your name and address and put you on a mailing list. (the COMPANY chuckles) And once you're on the list, you're in real trouble, like this friend of mine who was mugged thirty-two times on his way home from work. (a little laughter from the COMPANY) \nA SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in front of PUPKIN and RITA. \nPUPKIN (to SERVANT) Thanks. \n", "test2_true": "PUPKIN So what my friend does is get himself a dog, one of those huge German Shepherds. One night, he's walking the dog in Central Park when he hears this voice behind him. (in a German accent) Okay, Harry, drop your vallet and keep your hantz over your head or I bite your little fanny off. \nThe COMPANY breaks up. \nONE GUEST (to LANGFORD) Looks like you've found yourself a winner, Jerry. \nLANGFORD (looking at PUPKIN) He's the one who found himself a winner. \nRITA looks up, smiles and blushes. The rest of the COMPANY smiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to eating her tart. Suddenly she bites down on something hard. She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it. The COMPANY giggles. It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at Cartier's. The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs. LANGFORD lifts his wine glass. \nLANGFORD \nTo Rita and Rupert -- a short engagement and a long, happy marriage. \nThe COMPANY drinks with murmurs of \"Hear! Hear!\"   RITA and PUPKIN beam. RITA looks lovingly at PUPKIN. \nA SECOND GUEST (the PUPKIN) Have you set a date? \nPUPKIN (looking pointedly at LANGFORD) Oh, yes. \nA THIRD GUEST I hope we're all invited. \nPUPKIN Everyone's invited. \nCUT TO: \n64   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO \nThe theater is packed. World Series bunting hangs from the balcony and the front of the stage. We hear RICK ROSS and the ORCHESTRA strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March.   Down one aisle walks RITA, accompanied by the MAN whom PUPKIN hit over the head at the bar. Down the other aisle marches PUPKIN, accompanied by LANGFORD. The AUDIENCE cheers wildly. The two COUPLES walk to the stage where a white- haired OFFICIAL awaits them. BERT CANTER stands at his side. PUPKIN and RITA disengage from their ESCORTS and stand before the OFFICIAL. The music stops and the AUDIENCE grows quiet. \nOFFICIAL We are met here in these extraordinary circumstances to join this man and this woman in holy wedlock. But, before we begin, let me voice a personal word of thanks to you, Rupert and to you, Rita, for choosing me to perform this prestigious ceremony. Because we are on prime time, I am going to discard my customary remarks in favor of a few personal reflections.   When I was principal at Clifton High and these two were students, I had very little faith that Rupert here would amount to very much. But like his teachers and his fellow students, I underestimated this fine young man.   Some say that this misjudgment is directly tied to my recent dismissal as head of the Clifton School System. But let me take this opportunity to set the record straight. Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were \nmost certainly destined for a great career and a lifetime of happiness, I voluntarily stepped down. I would only here add my own wishes to those of millions of viewers for their continued health, wealth and boundless success. \nThe OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN. \nOFFICIAL We'll be back to marry them in a minute, right after this word. \nFADE TO: \n65   INT:   THE TRAIN - DAY \nPUPKIN and RITA are seated as they were.      We hear the CONDUCTOR calling. \nCONDUCTOR'S VOICE Greenwich.    Greenwich next stop. Greenwich. \nPUPKIN and RITA grab their small suitcases and quickly move down the aisle towards the door. \nCUT TO: \n66   INT:   A SUBURBAN TAXI - DAY \nRITA is peering out the window.     PUPKIN is still lost in thought. \nRITA Look at that one. How'd you like to live in that?!?! Or that one! What do you figure these run? \nThe taxi stops in front of a walled lot behind which is visible a handsome English stucco home. \nPUPKIN (to DRIVER) What's this? \nDRIVER This is it. \nRITA It's gorgeous! \nPUPKIN is genuinely puzzled. \nPUPKIN (to DRIVER) You sure? \nDRIVER Look, friend, I wouldn't want to tell you how many times I made this trip.   (pause)    That'll be three seventy-five. \nPUPKIN, still puzzled, hands him a five dollar bill. \nPUPKIN (abstractedly) Keep it. \nThe DRIVER gets out and puts PUPKIN and RITA's bags, which he had stacked on the front seat, onto the sidewalk. \nDRIVER Thanks. If you need a ride back, just ask the guy for Wayne. That's me. \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK as PUPKIN opens the gate and he and RITA walk up the drive. \nCUT TO: \n67   EXT:   LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAY \nPUPKIN and RITA stand before the front door. PUPKIN rings, After a few beats, the door is opened by an Indonesian HOUSEBOY. PUPKIN walks in right past him, RITA following behind. \nCUT TO: \n68   INT:   LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAY \nPUPKIN hands the HOUSEBOY the two suitcases as he talks. \nPUPKIN You must be Jonno. I'm Rupert Pupkin and this is Rita Keane. Mr. Langford's expecting us. \n", "test2_id": 232, "test3_input": "RITA (gaily) Well, there's only one way to find out. \nRITA scampers over to the stairs and pauses on the first step. \nRITA You coming or not? \nRITA bounds up the stairs. \nPUPKIN Rita! \nCAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN up the stairs. \nCUT TO: \n75   INT:   UPSTAIRS - DAY \nThere is no sign of RITA. \nPUPKIN Where are you? \nThere is no answer. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN from room to room. They are all guest rooms, neat, pretty, clean. \nPUPKIN Come on, Rita. This isn't funny. \nFinally, PUPKIN opens the door to another room. \nCUT TO: \n76   INT:   A BEDROOM - DAY \nIt is clearly LANGFORD's bedroom with a few clothes strewn about, and other signs of being lived in. RITA lies on the bed. \nPUPKIN (shocked) What are you doing, Rita? \nRITA I love it! All those millions of women out there dying to change places with me right now. \nPUPKIN Come on.   We shouldn't be here. \nRITA Relax, will you. Let me have a little fun, for Christ's sake. \nRITA gets off the bed and runs into the john. \nCUT TO: \n77   INT:   A LAVISH BATHROOM - DAY \nRITA Look at this. It's nicer than my whole apartment. \nPUPKIN enters the large, beautifully done bathroom.   RITA examines her face in the mirror. \nPUPKIN (urgently) Let's go, Rita. \nRITA Boy, I really need some sun. \nPUPKIN Rita, this is Jerry's ... \nRITA Lay off, will you, Rupert. \nPUPKIN But we have no right ... \nRITA picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large dollop in PUPKIN's face. WE COME IN for a CLOSE UP of PUPKIN's face, buried under shaving cream. \nPUPKIN That wasn't funny, Rita. \nRITA hands him a towel. \nRITA Here. \nShe looks around. \nRITA Now for something that smells nice. \nShe swings open the cabinet with a flourish. The door swings open violently and the mirror shatters against something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink. PUPKIN and RITA stand there, staring at each other. RITA begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam of the downstairs door. \nCUT TO: \n78   INT:   THE FOYER \nLANGFORD has entered, drawn and businesslike.       JONNO and the COOK have moved out to greet him. \nLANGFORD (looking around) Where are they? \nJONNO I was going to call the police but then I thought to myself 'what if they are Mr. Langford's friends?' \nWe hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the stairs. LANGFORD, JONNO and the COOK look up. PUPKIN comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with RITA following cautiously behind. PUPKIN has large traces of shaving cream behind his ears and on his neck. \nPUPKIN Hi, Jerry.   We were just freshening up. \nPUPKIN stops at the base of the stairs, turns around, and waves RITA down. \nPUPKIN (to RITA) Come on, Rita. No need to be shy. \nPUPKIN smiles conspiratorially at LANGFORD.       RITA comes slowly down. \n", "test3_true": "RITA (tentatively) Pleased to meet you. \nLANGFORD nods imperceptibly, his face tense, his eyes alert. RITA, reading her frigid reception, looks to PUPKIN who walks blithely past LANGFORD into the living room, toward the bar. \nPUPKIN What's your pleasure? \nPUPKIN glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and turns back to LANGFORD who has moved into the living room with JONNO and the COOK a few steps behind. PUPKIN flashes LANGFORD an apologetic smile. \nPUPKIN (to LANGFORD) We've already taken the liberty, so to speak. Rita was a little nervous. It isn't every day she meets someone like you. \nLANGFORD What's going on here? \nPUPKIN We've been sitting around, waiting. That's all. How was your golf game? \nJONNO I told them you weren't here. \nCOOK That's right. \nPUPKIN He did, Jerry. He was very helpful. We had to take an early train. There was nothing else until after one. (pause) I brought the material. It's upstairs, in my bags. (pause) Where is everybody? \nLANGFORD Who? \nPUPKIN The other guests! (in a confidential tone) We're getting a little hungry, to tell you the truth. \nLANGFORD (as though confirming what PUPKIN said) You are. \nPUPKIN (backing off) But we don't mind waiting, do we, Rita? \nRITA says nothing. She has sensed something terribly wrong and is slowly backing away from PUPKIN. \nLANGFORD You know, I could have you arrested, both of you. \nPUPKIN (seizing the idea) You know you could! And there'd be absolutely no way we could prove we belonged here. I never thought of that. \nLANGFORD Well, you should have before you ... \nPUPKIN (still fixed on the idea) Maybe we could work up a routine about that, about a guy who throws all his friends in jail. Let's talk about that. \nLANGFORD (sharply) Let's not. \nPUPKIN Sure, Jerry. Whatever you ... \nLANGFORD (exasperated) Look, if you've got something for me to sign, let's have it and get it over with so I can get back ... \nPUPKIN (interrupting) That wouldn't be right, Jerry. Not in your own house! \nLANGFORD (summoning his last bit of patience) I have a lot of work to get to. (to JONNO) How did they get here? \nPUPKIN We took a taxi, Jerry ... But don't worry about us. You go ahead and do your work and we'll just take a stroll around until lunch is ready. \nLANGFORD You're a little thick, aren't you? \nPUPKIN (smiling as though complimented) Well, maybe a ... \nRITA What's he's saying, Rupert, is that he wants us out. \nPUPKIN Don't listen to her, Jerry. She doesn't understand anything about us. \nRITA Don't get me into this. \nLANGFORD (to JONNO) Call the station. \nJONNO goes back into the foyer, followed by the COOK. \nLANGFORD There'll be a cab here in a few minutes. Now if you'll just wait at the gate ... \nPUPKIN Look, Jerry, if I've said anything out of line, let's chalk it up to inexperience, okay? I'll just go upstairs and get my tape and we can start working. It shouldn't take long and then you'll have the rest of the afternoon to yourself. \nLANGFORD I've told you just as clearly as I can. I want you out of here and I want you out now. Scram, beat it, vamoose, out! Is that plain enough! \nRITA deftly pockets the enamel box. \nPUPKIN But what about my material?    When are we going to go over it? \nRITA Come on, Rupert, the man wants us to go. \nPUPKIN Tell her she's wrong, Jerry! \nRITA Look, Mr. Langford. I didn't know anything about all this. I hardly know this guy. I haven't seen him in years. \nPUPKIN Rita! \nRITA So if there's anything I can do, any way I can make this up to you. \nPUPKIN She's nothing, Jerry. She's just some girl who works in a bar. Don't let her spoil things. \nLANGFORD starts herding RITA and PUPKIN towards the door. \nLANGFORD Come on.   Let's go. \nPUPKIN All I'm asking is fifteen minutes. That's all. Just long enough to listen to my act. Is that asking too much -- fifteen minutes of your day against my whole life? \nLANGFORD I'll call the police if I have to. \n", "test3_id": 233}

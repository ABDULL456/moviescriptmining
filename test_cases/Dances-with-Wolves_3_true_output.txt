EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
The column is moving at a leisurely walk when the horses start to bunch up. They're stopping. 
Everyone waits while far up ahead, a group of ten or twelve men examine the ground. White officers sits atop their horses, while their scouts scour the ground. They've found a significant trail. 
The scouts are Indian, and by their distinctive dress, we recognize them. They are Pawnee. 
The Pawnee scouts come racing up. Their horses are wet and have come a good distance. The scouts are very excited. 
The men have dismounted. They prepare for battle, removing any equipment that might rattle -- tin cups, plates, etc., tossing the discards into a growing pile. 
INT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN 
Black Shawl watches as Kicking Bird slips a magnificent pipe into its buckskin case. Now he looks at her. The medicine man too is in a kind of pain we have not seen before. 
EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAWN 
Carrying the pipe he made, Dances With Wolves walks through the village. Suddenly he stops. Kicking Bird is standing in the middle of the empty avenue. 
Like gunfighters, the two men approach each other at a slow and deliberate walk. 
Gradually they realize that each has selected the same parting gift. It's heartbreaking. Kicking Bird tries to cover with a casual question, but it's all fake. 
KICKING BIRD You've finished your pipe? How does it smoke? 
DANCES WITH WOLVES I'm told it smokes well. 
Dances With Wolves moves to make the exchange. Kicking Bird does the same. From one hand to the other. Men couldn't be closer. 
KICKING BIRD It doesn't seem possible that we could come this far. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES You were the first man I ever wanted to be like. I will not forget you. 
Neither can speak. There is only goodbye. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
The column of soldiers is not in a rush, but they're trotting now to make better time. 
EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAY 
Stands With A Fist sits on a pony outside the lodge. Two pack horses are loaded with their things. 
Dances With Wolves swings onto his pony's back and we follow as they start out of the village. No one is standing in rose to watch them leave. No one is crying. In fact, people are making the motions of going about their regular work. 
But it's all fake too. The whole village is sad and the most obvious sign is that there is no sound. In the awful quiet, most people avert their eyes as the two pass by. 
EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY 
Dances With Wolves and Stands With A Fist have reached the head of the trail leading out of the winter camp. They have just begun to ascend when a voice, calling from afar, brings them to a halt. The sound echoes through the canyons, through the village. 
WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.) (calling) Dances With Wolves... 
EXT. CANYON - DAY 
His pony is jacked up and, as always, Wind In His Hair looks the perfect warrior. But now his face is full of stress as he screams out the message he could not deliver in person. 
WIND IN HIS HAIR I am Wind In His Hair... 
EXT. WINTER CAMP - DAY 
Everyone in the camp has stopped to listen. 
WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.) Can you not see that I am your friend? 
EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DAY 
Dances With Wolves looks ready to crack. 
WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.) Can you not see that you will always be my friend? 
Dances With Wolves lets the unhappy echo of these words fade away before he starts his pony again. We follow for a few yards. Then the call comes a second time. If anything, more urgent than before. 
WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.) Dances With Wolves... 
Dances With Wolves stops. He drops his head painfully as the sound of his own name booms through his head. 
EXT. CANYON TRAIL - DUSK 
Troops are moving through the trees quietly, sabers drawn. 
EXT. CANYON RIM - DUSK 
The rest of the troops have moved to the edge. They too are quiet. Down below, the Pawnee scouts are milling about looking for sign. 
The soldiers from the canyon floor are silently arriving on the scene. The Pawnee look to the lead scout on the canyon rim. They have no answer, and the lead scout has none to give the general at his side. Ten Bears' village is gone. 
EXT. CANYON RIM - DUSK 
Wind In His Hair and several other warriors are just drawing back from unseen vantage points on the canyon rim. Wind In His Hair glances back and hesitates, as though waiting for someone. A great, yellow full moon has just appeared above the opposite rim of the canyon. The yellow is brilliant, a great spotlight of golden color. 
A wolf steps into the light on the opposite rim. He's walking in the backdrop of the moon. The wolf suddenly arches his back, sticks his muzzle in the air and produces a spine- tingling howl. The sound bounces all over the canyon. 
Dances With Wolves is at the canyon's rim. He listens a long time, fully entranced by the wolf's howl. He is still listening when it is gone. A whisper floats out of the night behind him. 
WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.) Dances With Wolves... 
Dances With Wolves shrinks back from the canyon's rim, turns and trots off into the darkness, following his friends. 
FADE TO BLACK 
THE END

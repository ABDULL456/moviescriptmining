{"train": "GOOD WILL HUNTING \n\"GOOD WILL HUNTING\" \nby \nMatt Damon & Ben Affleck \nFADE IN: \nEXT. SOUTH BOSTON ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE -- DAY \nCUT TO: \nINT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- EVENING \nThe bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor. \nCHUCKIE Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you. \nAs the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a table near the back of the bar. \nALL Oh Jesus. Here we go. \nThe guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer. Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22, heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle with. \nFinally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror stories with eager disgust. \nAll four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are its product. \nCHUCKIE You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan? \nALL Yeah. \nCHUCKIE Well you know how he loves animals right?  Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... (laughs) \nALL What? Come on! \nCHUCKIE (trying not to laugh) I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to. \nWILL Chuckie, what the fuck happened? \nCHUCKIE Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat-- \nChuckie is really laughing now. \nMORGAN --That isn't funny-- \nCHUCKIE --and he's like \"shit! Motherfucker!\" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat -- I'm sorry-- \nBILLY Fuckin' Chuckie! \nCHUCKIE So he sees this cat tryin to make it across the street and it's not lookin' so good. \nWILL It's walkin' pretty slow at this point. \nMORGAN You guys are fuckin' sick. \nCHUCKIE So Mikey's like \"Fuck, I gotta put this thing out of its misery\"--So he gets a hammer-- \nWILL/MORGAN/BILLY OH! \nCHUCKIE out of his tool box, and starts chasin' the cat and starts whackin' it with the hammer. You know, tryin' to put the thing out of its misery. \nMORGAN Jesus. \nCHUCKIE And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' \"I'm sorry.\" BANG, \"I'm sorry.\" BANG! \nBILLY Like it can understand. \nCHUCKIE And this Samoan guy comes runnin' out of his house and he's like \"What the fuck are you doing to my cat?!\" Mikey's like \"I'm sorry\" --BANG--\" I hit your cat with my truck, and I'm just trying to put it out of it's misery\" -- BANG! And the cat dies. So Mikey's like \"Why don't you come look at the front of the truck.\" 'Cause the other guy's all fuckin flipped out about-- \nWILL Watching his cat get brained. \nMorgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles. \nCHUCKIE Yeah, so he's like \"Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something\"-- \nWILL --or a tail-- \nMORGAN WILL! \nCHUCKIE And so they go around to the front of his truck... and there's another cat on the grille. \nWILL/MORGAN/BILLY No! Ugh! \nCHUCKIE Is that unbelievable? He brained an innocent cat! \nBLACKOUT: \nThe opening credits roll over a series of shots of the city and the real people who live and work there, going about their daily lives. \nWe see a panoramic view of South Boston. \nLAMBEAU Find out what? \nSTUDENT Who proved the theorem. \nEXT. TOM FOLEY PARK, S. BOSTON -- AFTERNOON \nIn the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys, drinking and smoking cigarettes. Will pops open a beer. The boys have been here a while and it shows. \nBilly sees something that catches his interest. \nBILLY Who's that? She's got a nice ass. \nTheir P.O.V. reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a beefy looking ITALIAN GUY (BOBBY CHAMPA) \nMORGAN Yah, that is a nice ass. \nCHUCKIE You could put a pool in that backyard. \nBILLY Who's she talking to? \nMORGAN That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him. \nWILL Yah, Bobby Champa. He used to beat the shit outta' me in Kindergarten. \nBILLY He's a pretty big kid. \nWILL Yah, he's the same size now as he was in Kindergarten. \nMORGAN Fuck this, let's get something to eat... \nCHUCKIE What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her? \nMORGAN Fuck her. \nThe boys get up and walk down the bleachers. \nWILL I could go for a Whopper. \nMORGAN (nonchalant) Let's hit \"Kelly's.\" \nCHUCKIE Morgan, I'm not goin' to \"Kelly's Roast Beef\" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. \nMORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes? \nCHUCKIE All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to \"Kelly's.\" It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once. \nMORGAN She's not stupid. \nWILL She's sharp as a marble. \nCHUCKIE We're not goin'. (beat) I don't even like \"Kelly's.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- LATER \nLambeau, still in his reunion formal-wear, strides down the hallway, carrying some papers. A group of students have gathered by the chalkboard. They part like the red sea as he approaches the board. Using the papers in hand, he checks the proof. \nSatisfied, he turns to the class. \nLAMBEAU This is correct? Who did this? \nDead silence. Lambeau turns to an INDIAN STUDENT. \nLAMBEAU Nemesh? \nNemesh shakes his head in awe. \nNEMESH No way. \nLambeau erases the proof and starts putting up a new one. \nLAMBEAU Well, whoever You are, I'm sure you'll find this one challenging enough to merit coming forward with your identity.  That is, if you can do it. \nINT. CHUCKIE'S CAR, DRIVING IN SOUTH BOSTON -- CONTINUOUS \nThe street is crowded as our boys drive down Broadway. They move slowly through heavy traffic, windows down. Chuckie sorts through a large \"KELLY'S ROAST BEEF\" BAG as he drives. \nMORGAN Double Burger. \nWill holds the wheel for Chuckie as he looks through the bag. \nMORGAN (same tone) Double Burger. \nChuckie gets out fries for himself, hands Will his fries. \nMORGAN I, I had a Kelly's Double Burger. \nCHUCKIE Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there! \nMORGAN So why don't you give me my sandwich? \nCHUCKIE What do you mean \"your sandwich?\" I bought it. \nThe fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone throws a bottle. \nIn the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will, standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING him. \nANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT \nWhatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious Champa, fury in his eyes. Chuckie and Billy pull Will away. \nThe POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him. \nEXT. SIDEWALK (FULL SPEED) -- CONTINUOUS \nA crowd of onlookers have gathered. Chuckie addresses them. \nCHUCKIE Hey, thanks for comin' out. \nWILL Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwich. \nThe Police slam Will into the hood of a car. \nWILL (to Police) Hey, I know it's not a French cruller, but it's free. \nThe cop holding Will SLAMS his [Will's] face into the hood, another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car. The look of rage returns to Will's eye. \nWILL Get the fuck off me! \nWill resists. Another cop comes over. Will KICKS HIM IN THE KNEE, dropping the cop. Momentarily freed, Will engages in a fracas with three cops. More converge on Will, who -- though he struggles -- takes a beating. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SEAN'S ROOF -- NIGHT \nSean sits, exactly as we first saw him, except his tie is now loose and an empty bottle of BUSHMILLS is at his side. He stares out over the City. A MATRONLY LANDLADY comes out of a doorway on the roof. \nLANDLADY Sean? \nSean doesn't answer. \nLANDLADY Sean? You okay? \nSEAN Yeah. \nA beat. \nLANDLADY It's getting cold. \nAfter a moment, she retreats back down the stairs. Sean doesn't move. \nDISSOLVE: \nEXT. CHARLES RIVER, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING \nThe morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COURTHOUSE -- NEXT MORNING \nWill emerges from the courthouse. Chuckie is waiting for him in the Cadillac with two cups of DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS coffee. He hands one of them to Will. This feels routine. \nCHUCKIE When's the arraignment? \nWILL Next week. \nChuckie pulls away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING \nStudents walk to class, carrying bags. More than any other, students seem to be heading into one PARTICULAR CLASSROOM. \nINT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- MORNING \nThe classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it. Tom takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited environment with mock pomposity and good humor. \nLAMBEAU Is it my imagination, or has my class grown considerably? \nLaughter. \nLAMBEAU I look around and see young people who are my students, young people who are not my students as well as some of my colleagues. And by no stretch of my imagination do I think you've all come to hear me lecture. \nMore laughter. \nLAMBEAU But rather to ascertain the identity of who our esteemed \"The Tech\" has come to call \"The Mystery Math Magician.\" \nHe holds up the M.I.T. Tech featuring a silhouetted figure, emblazoned with a large, white question mark. The headline reads \"Mystery Math Magician strikes again.\" \nLAMBEAU Whoever you are, you've solved four of the most difficult theorems I've ever given a class. So without further ado, come forward silent rogue, and receive thy prize. \nThe class waits in breathless anticipation. A STUDENT shifts his weight in his chair, making a noise. \nLAMBEAU Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my spectators, but it appears there will be no unmasking here today. I'm going to have to ask those of you not enrolled in the class to make your escape now or, for the next three hours be subjected to the mundities of eigenvectors. \nSKYLAR Okay. \nCHUCKIE So, you ladies ah, go to school here? \nLYDIA Yes. \nCHUCKIE Yeah, cause I think I had a class with you. \nAt this point, several interested parties materialize. Morgan Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate themselves within listening distance. A rather large student in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt, CLARK (22) notices Chuckie. He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering over them as protector. This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's attention. \nSKYLAR What class? \nCHUCKIE Ah, history I think. \nSKYLAR Oh... \nCHUCKIE Yah, it's not a bad school... \nAt this point, Clark can't resist and steps in. \nCLARK What class did you say that was? \nCHUCKIE History. \nCLARK How'd you like that course? \nCHUCKIE Good, it was all right. \nCLARK History? Just \"history?\" It must have been a survey course then. \nChuckie nods. Clark notices Chuckie's clothes. Will and Billy exchange a look and move subtly closer. \nCLARK Pretty broad. \"History of the World?\" \nCHUCKIE Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time. \nCLARK Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to \"seize\" the opportunity to ask you a question. \nBilly shifts his beer into his left hand. Will and Morgan see this. Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say \"not again...\" \nCLARK Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your history class. \nClark looks to see if the girls are impressed. They are not. \nWhen Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and rolls her [own] eyes. They laugh. Will sees this and smiles. \nCHUCKIE To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary. \nCLARK Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch. \nWill and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie. \nCHUCKIE All right, are we gonna have a problem? \nCLARK There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian precapitalist and... \nWill, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation. \nWILL Of course that's your contention. You're a first year grad student. You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization. \nCLARK (taken aback) Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of-- \nWILL \"Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth...\" You got that from \"Work in Essex County,\" Page 421, right? Do you have any thoughts of your own on the subject or were you just gonna plagiarize the whole book for me? \nClark is stunned. \nWILL Look, don't try to pass yourself off as some kind of an intellect at the expense of my friend just to impress these girls. \nClark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit. \nWILL The sad thing is, in about 50 years you might start doin' some thinkin' on your own and by then you'll realize there are only two certainties in life. \nCLARK Yeah? What're those? \nWILL One, don't do that.  Two -- you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library. \nWill catches Skylar's eye. \nCLARK But I will have a degree, and you'll be serving my kids fries at a drive through on our way to a skiing trip. \nWILL (smiles) Maybe. But at least I won't be a prick. (beat) And if you got a problem with that, I guess we can step outside and deal with it that way. \nWhile Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer. \nWILL If you change your mind, I'll be over by the bar. \nHe turns and walks away. Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a look. \nMorgan turns to a nearby girl. \nMORGAN My boy's wicked smart. \nINT. BOW AND ARROW, AT THE BAR -- LATER \nArriving at Will's house and dropping him off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. M.I.T. BUILDING AND GROUNDS GARAGE -- DAY \nLambeau walks into a small garage facility. The area stores lawn machinery and various tools. An older man, TERRY (58) sits behind the desk reading the BOSTON HERALD sports page. Lambeau has obviously never been here before. He takes in the surroundings, somewhat uncomfortable. Gets dirty. \nLAMBEAU Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office? \nTERRY Yeah, can I help you? \nLAMBEAU I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here. \nTERRY No students work for me. \nLAMBEAU Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building-- \nTERRY Which one's your building? \nLAMBEAU Building two. \nTerry checks a list behind his [own] desk. Looks up. \nTERRY Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it. \nLAMBEAU No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. \nTERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint. \nLAMBEAU Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important. \nTERRY Well, he didn't show up for work today... \nTerry takes a beat. Holding all the cards. \nTERRY Look, he got his job through his P.O. so you can call him. \nTerry goes through a stack of paper on his desk. Takes out a card and hands it to Lambeau. Lambeau looks blankly at the card which reads: \"PAROLE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM.\" \nINT. COURTROOM -- DAY \nWill stands before JUDGE MALONE (40) being arraigned. It is fairly unceremonious, the courtroom nearly empty, save Will and the PROSECUTOR. Lambeau walks in from the back. \nWILL There is a lengthy legal precedent, Your Honor, going back to 1789, whereby a defendant may claim self- defense against an agent of the government where the act is shown to be a defense against tyranny, a defense of liberty-- \nThe Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor. \nJUDGE MALONE Mr. Simmons, Officer McNeely who signed the complaint isn't in my courtroom. Why is that? \nPROSECUTOR He's in the hospital with a broken knee, Your Honor. But I have depositions from the other officers. \nWILL Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit back in 1887, that \"Every American citizen is by birth, a sworn officer of the state.  Every man is a policeman.\" As for the other officers, even William Congrave said; \"he that first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft he that has stolen the treasure.\" \nPROSECUTOR Your Honor-- \nWill cranks it up. \nWILL (to Prosecutor) I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense by our constitution, Sir.  The same document which guarantees my right to liberty. \"Liberty,\" in case you've forgotten, is \"the soul's right to breathe, and when it cannot take a long breath laws are girded too tight.  Without liberty, man is a syncope.\" (beat, to Judge) Ibid. Your Honor. \nPROSECUTOR Man is a what? \nWILL Julius Caesar proclaimed -- Though he be wounded-- \"Magna...\" \nThe Judge interrupts. \nJUDGE MALONE Son, (a beat) My turn. \nThe Judge opens Will's CASE HISTORY. \nJUDGE MALONE (reading) June, '93, assault, Sept. '93 assault... Grand theft auto February \nA beat, the Judge takes particular notice. \nJUDGE MALONE Where, apparently, you defended yourself and had the case thrown out by citing \"free property rights of horse and carriage\" from 1798... \nLambeau has to smile, impressed. The Judge shakes his head. \nJUDGE MALONE March, '94 public drunkenness, public nudity, assault. 10/94 mayhem. November '94, assault. Jan. '95 impersonating a police officer, mayhem, theft, resisting -- overturned-- \nThe Judge takes a beat. Gives Will a look. \nJUDGE MALONE You're in my courtroom, now and I am aware of your priors. (beat) I'm also aware that you're an orphan. You've been through several foster homes. The state removed you from three because of serious physical abuse. \nThe Judge holds a look to Will, who looks down. \nJUDGE MALONE Another Judge might care. You hit a cop, you go in. (beat) Motion to dismiss denied. \nThe Bailiff goes to remove Will from the courtroom. \nJUDGE MALONE Keep workin' on your arguments, son. A word of advice for trial; speak English. \nAs Will is removed from the courtroom, Lambeau approaches Judge Malone who is stepping down from the bench. \nCHUCKIE You're fuckin' good. \nWill smiles. \nCHUCKIE Just submit, Morgan. He's got you in the Cobra Clutch. \nMORGAN (to Chuckie) Fuck your mother too! \nINT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nWill sits alone in his one room apartment, reading. A closer look reveals he is reading a self-help PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. Will is flipping through the book at about a page per second. He shakes his head and smiles. Upon finishing the book, he throws it in a nearby WASTEBASKET. Push in on the back of the book where a SMILING PSYCHOLOGIST is pictured. \nINT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS \nWill sits in a well decorated Psychologist's Office. Across from Will sits the same PSYCHOLOGIST, HENRY LIPKIN (40), from the book. They are in mid-session. \nWILL That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good. \nPSYCHOLOGIST Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift. \nWILL I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart-- \nPSYCHOLOGIST You have a quality -- something you were born with, that you have no control over -- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building.  He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for \"Mike\" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book. \nWILL Yeah, I read your book. \"Mike\" had the same problems as \"Chad\" the stockbroker. \nPSYCHOLOGIST Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will. \nWILL You're right. I know. \nPSYCHOLOGIST Will, your not getting off that easy. \nWILL No, but, I mean you know... I do other things. That no one knows about. \nPSYCHOLOGIST Like what, Will? \nWILL I go places, I interact. \nPSYCHOLOGIST What places? \nWILL Certain, clubs. (beat) Like, Paradise. It's not bad. \nWill gives the Psychologist a furtive look. \nWILL It's just that feeling when you can take your shirt off and really dance. (beat) When the music owns you. Do you understand? \nPSYCHOLOGIST I might understand that. \nWILL Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay? \nPSYCHOLOGIST What? \nWILL C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true. \nPSYCHOLOGIST That's very presumptuous. \nWILL Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump. \nPSYCHOLOGIST (a little laugh) Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children. \nWILL I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller. \nPSYCHOLOGIST You're getting defensive, Will. \nWILL Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caesar, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that. \nPSYCHOLOGIST Who is \"Danny Terrio?\" \nWILL If you wanna hit \"Ramrod,\" take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you.  I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like \"Inspector Clouseau.\" \nThe Psychologist calmly packs his things. \nPSYCHOLOGIST Well, I can see this is pointless... \nWILL You're getting defensive... Henry. And hey, chief -- tell the wife, at least.  Christ, set her free. \nThe shrink gets up and walks out. \nWILL Fuckin' hypocrite... \nINT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS \nThe Psychologist comes walking out, much to the surprise of Lambeau and Tom who have been waiting in the lobby. \nLAMBEAU Henry? \nThe Psychologist keeps walking. \nPSYCHOLOGIST No. You know what, Gerry? This is why I don't do pro-bono anymore. It's not worth it to me. \nLAMBEAU What happened? \nPSYCHOLOGIST I don't have the time. I'm going on national television this week. \nINT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- LATER \nWill is reclining, eyes closed, in a trance-like state. The mood is more serious now. \nHYPNOTIST Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you? \nWILL Seven. \nHYPNOTIST And what do you see? \nWILL Somethin's in my room. \nHYPNOTIST What is it? \nWILL It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer. \nWill flinches. \nHYPNOTIST You're in a safe place, Will. \nWILL It's touching me. \nLambeau makes a sound. The Hypnotist shushes him [Lambeau] with his [Hypnotist's] finger. Tom returns to his note-taking. \nHYPNOTIST Where is it touching you? \nWILL Down there. (indicating genitals) And I'm nervous. \nHYPNOTIST You don't have to be nervous, Will. \nLambeau and the Therapist trade looks. This is working. \nWILL 'Cause I'm not ready. (calming) But the figure tells me everything's gonna be all right. 'Cause the figure's a Libra too. And we start dancin' and it's beautiful-- \nWill breaks into song at full volume. \nWILL \"SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT!\" \nLAMBEAU (getting up) Oh Jesus. \nThe Hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door. Will is still singing from \"Sky Rockets.\" \nLAMBEAU Wait a minute, Barry. \nHYPNOTIST I have better ways to spend my time. \nHe is gone. Will stops singing, laughs. \nLAMBEAU Oh, for God's sake, Will. \nWILL Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun. \nLAMBEAU I told you to cooperate with these people. \nWILL C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work. \nWill gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of Lambeau. \nWILL (spooky voice) Look into my eyes. I don't need therapy. \nLAMBEAU Get out, Will. \nWILL Okay... don't forget to get another therapist for next week. \nLAMBEAU That's enough. \nWill is out the door. Lambeau turns to Tom. \nTOM I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability. \nLAMBEAU What's the point? \nTOM What do you want to do? \nLAMBEAU There is somebody... \nTOM Who is he? \nLAMBEAU He was my roommate in college. \nINT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- DAY \nThis is SEAN MAGUIRE'S \"Dying and Bereavement\" class. Emblazoned on the door is \"room 101.\" While the lecture hall could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here today. \nSean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. Tired of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student body. \nSEAN Establishing trust is the most important component in making breakthroughs with a patient. Why? \nA beat. \nSEAN Maureen? \nMAUREEN'S only response is an empty stare. \nLAMBEAU You were missed. (beat) How long has it been since we've seen each other? \nSEAN Since Nancy died. \nLAMBEAU I'm sorry, that damn conference-- \nSEAN I got your card. \nINT. HARVARD SQ. DINER: \"THE TASTY\" -- NIGHT \nA FRY COOK hands Will and Skylar a pair of CHEESEBURGERS. \nSKYLAR Have you ever seen Annie Hall? \nWILL No. \nSKYLAR Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing. \nWill smiles. \nWILL I really don't 'date' that much. \nSKYLAR (laughs) You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it. \nWILL No I haven't... \nSKYLAR Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss. \nWILL (mock protest) No I wasn't... \nSKYLAR Yes you were. \nWILL I was kinda' hopin' to get a \"good night laid\" but... I'll take a kiss. \nShe laughs. \nSKYLAR Oh, you will? \nWILL No... I was hoping to get a kiss. \nSKYLAR Then why don't we just get it out of the way. \nHe looks at her. \nWILL Now? \nBoth of them have cheeseburger in their mouths. \nSKYLAR Yeah. \nThey kiss, mouths full of burger. It's nice. A beat. \nSKYLAR That had to be the worst good night kiss... \nWill laughs. \nWILL Hey, look lady, I'm just here for the free food. \nShe smiles. \nSKYLAR Free? \nWILL Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels. \nShe laughs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- SAME \nLambeau and Sean, having finished their meal. Lambeau has been pitching Sean. \nSEAN I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule. \nLAMBEAU This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him. \nSEAN Not much free time, Gerry. \nLAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan? \nSean nods his head. \nSEAN Yeah. \nLAMBEAU He was alive over a hundred years ago.  He was Indian. Dots, not feathers... \nSean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles. \nLAMBEAU So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny hut in India. No formal education, no access to other works. But he came across an old math book and from this basic text he was able to extrapolate theories that had baffled mathematicians for years. \nSEAN And he mailed it to Hardy-- \nLAMBEAU That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England. \nSEAN Have you read all these books, Will? \nWILL Probably not. \nSEAN (indicating a shelf) How about the ones on that shelf? \nWill's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant. \nWILL Yeah, I read those. \nSEAN What did you think? \nWILL I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.  They're your books, why don't you read 'em? \nSEAN I did. \nWILL That must have taken you a long time. \nSEAN Yeah, it did take me a long time. \nSean says this with pride. His determined stare and confident manner catch Will a bit off guard. Will rises from his chair and goes to the shelf. \nWILL (looking at book) \"A History of the United States, Volume I.\" If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's \"A People's History of the United States.\" That book will knock you on your ass. \nSEAN How about Noam Chomsky's \"Manufacturing Consent?\" \nWILL You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books. \nSEAN You think so? \nWILL Whatever blows your hair back. \nWill returns to his chair. Pause. \nSEAN (indicating cigarette) Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth. \nWILL You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing. \nSean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude. He remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his face. Will is aware of Sean's confidence. \nWILL Do you lift? \nSEAN Yes, I do. \nWILL Nautilus? \nSEAN Free weights. \nWILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench? \nSEAN \nWILL Oh. \nWill gets up again and moves around his chair to Sean's painting. It is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous storm -- by no means a masterpiece. Will studies it. \nWILL You paint this? \nSEAN Yeah. Do you paint? \nWILL No. \nSEAN Crayons? \nWILL This is a real piece of shit. \nSEAN Tell me what you really think. \nWILL Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me. \nSEAN What does? \nWILL The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting. \nSEAN What is? \nWILL I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off. \nSEAN Oh, \"Starry Night\" time, huh? \nWILL You ever heard the saying, \"any port in a storm?\" \nSEAN Sure, how 'bout \"still waters run deep\"- \nWILL --Well, maybe that means you. \nSEAN Maybe what mea-- \nWILL Maybe you were in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the waves were crashing over the bow, the Goddamned mast was about to snap, and you were crying for the harbor. So you did what you had to do, to get out.  Maybe you became a psychologist. \nSEAN Maybe you should be a patient and sit down. \nWILL Maybe you married the wrong woman. \nWILL 'Course I do, they're my brothers. \nSKYLAR Well... \nWILL Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian. \nSKYLAR (laughing) Do you keep in touch with them? \nWILL All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now. \nSkylar smiles. \nSKYLAR I want to meet them. \nWILL We'll do that. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nAs we pan across Sean's small apartment, we find it strewn with dirty clothes and the sink full of dishes. Although, if it weren't for the clutter, the place would feel pretty bare. A framed SPORTS ILLUSTRATED cover featuring a screaming Larry Bird and entitled \"CELTIC PRIDE\" hangs on the wall. Sean sits at the table next to another nearly empty bottle of BUSHMILL'S IRISH WHISKEY. He is deep in thought. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nWill strolls into the office. Sean is waiting there behind his desk. He seems different. More calm. Will and Sean stare at each other for a long moment. \nWILL You again. How the paintin' coming? \nSean stands up. \nSEAN Come with me. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOSTON COMMON -- MINUTES LATER \nSean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park. \nThey look out over a small pond, in which a group of schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats. \nWILL So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about? \nSEAN I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occurred to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me? \nWILL No. \nSEAN You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about. \nWILL Why thank you. \nSEAN You've never been out of Boston. \nWILL No. \nSEAN So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written... Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you.  And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term \"visiting hours\" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw.  You must know everything about me.  You're an orphan, right? \nWill nods quietly. \nSEAN Do you think I would presume to know the first thing about who you are because I read \"Oliver Twist?\" And I don't buy the argument that you don't want to be here, because I think you like all the attention you're getting. Personally, I don't care. There's nothing you can tell me that I can't read somewhere else.  Unless we talk about your life. But you won't do that. Maybe you're afraid of what you might say. \nSean stands, \nSEAN It's up to you. \nAnd walks away. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY \nWill and Chuckie doing demo at the site. They throw cinderblocks out a window into a pile. They are filthy. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- NIGHT \nRain pounds South Boston. Chuckie sits with the Cadillac fiddling, humming to the radio. Morgan and Billy sit in the back, sharing a case of beer. Will is at a pay phone. \nINT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nSKYLAR Hello? \nWill hangs up and runs back to the car, soaked. \nCHUCKIE Who'd you call? \nWILL No one. I didn't have the number. \nMORGAN What are you, retarded? You went all the way out there in the rain and you didn't have the number? \nWILL No, it was your mother's 900 number. I just ran out of quarters. \nWILL I'm takin' off. \nALL We're goin' late night. \nWILL I'm tired. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY \nWill and Lambeau work together at the board. They communicate non-verbally as they collaborate on a problem. After a particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look and laugh. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nWill and Sean sit in silence. A long moment passes. Sean casually reclines in his chair, disinterested. Will restlessly looks around the room and then back to Sean. An odd half smile crosses Sean's face. After a moment: \nWILL You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like \"we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet,\" and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says \"man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee.\"  So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes \"don't forget the coffee!\" \nSEAN (smiles) You've never been on a plane. \nWILL I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person. \nA beat. \nWILL I have been laid you know. \nSean smiles. \nSEAN Yeah? You got a lady now? \nWILL Yeah, I went on a date last week. \nSEAN How'd it go? \nWILL Fine. \nSEAN Well, are you going out again? \nWILL I don't know. \nSEAN Why not? \nWILL Haven't called her. \nSEAN Jesus Christ, you are an amateur. \nWILL I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun... \nSEAN So Christ, call her up. \nWILL Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that. \nSEAN And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that. \nWill says nothing. \nSEAN Well, I think that's a great philosophy Will, that way you can go through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody. \nSean looks directly at Will, who looks away. A beat. \nSEAN My wife used to turn the alarm clock off in her sleep. I was late for work all the time because in the middle of the night she'd roll over and turn the damn thing off. Eventually I got a second clock and put it under my side of the bed, but it got to where she was gettin' to that one too. She was afraid of the dark, so the closet light was on all night. Thing kept me up half the night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep, out of sheer exhaustion and not wake up when I was supposed to cause she'd have already gotten to my alarms. \nWill smiles, Sean takes a beat. \nSEAN My wife's been dead two years, Will. And when I think about her, those are the things I think about most. Little idiosyncrasies that only I knew about.  Those made her my wife. And she had the goods on me too. Little things I do out of habit. People call these things imperfections Will. It's just who we are. And we get to choose who we're going to let into out weird little worlds. You're not perfect. And let me save you the suspense, this girl you met isn't either. The question is, whether or not you're perfect for each other. You can know everything in the world, but the only way you're findin' that one out is by giving it a shot. You sure won't get the answer from an old fucker like me. And even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. \nWill smiles. A beat. \nWILL Why not? You told me every other fuckin' thing. You talk more than any shrink I ever met. \nSean laughs. \nSEAN I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it. \nWILL You ever think about gettin' remarried? \nSEAN My wife's dead. \nWILL Hence, the word remarried. \nSEAN My wife's dead. \nWILL Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone. \nA beat. Sean smiles. \nSEAN Time's up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON \nWILL You don't regret meetin' your wife? \nSEAN Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her. \nWILL When did you know she was the one? \nSEAN October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl.  What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them. \nWILL Where were you? \nSEAN I was havin' a drink with my future wife. \nWILL You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met? \nSEAN That's right. \nWILL So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away? \nSEAN You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room. \nWILL I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series! \nSean smiles. \nWILL And what kind of friends are these? They let you get away with that? \nSEAN I just slid my ticket across the table and said \"sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl.\" \nWILL \"I gotta go see about a girl\"? What did they say? \nSEAN They could see that I meant it. \nWILL You're kiddin' me. \nSEAN No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up counseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game. \nA beat. Will is impressed. \nWILL Would have been nice to catch that game though. \nSEAN (breaking) Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run. \nThey laugh. \nTIME DISSOLVE TO: \nINT LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY \nThe office is more crowded than usual. TOM and THREE of LAMBEAU'S COLLEAGUES including the esteemed ALEXANDER PEKEC are in the room. Will sits at a work-station which projects a proof of his [Will's] onto the chalkboard. Lambeau stands beside the projected image at the board arguing with Pekec, a foreign mathematician. The image is of a Ramses graph binary tree. \nLAMBEAU Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing... \nPEKEC With a Ramses graph on the binary tree-- \nLAMBEAU --But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side-- \nPEKEC Maker can. This is not new, Gerry! \nPekec starts writing lines beside Will's proof on the board. \nPEKEC But I can always garbage out (writes frantically) All the way to \"N\" to the minus one. \nLAMBEAU No, there's a limit. \nPEKEC The limit is not found! (turns to Will) The limit is not found. \nWILL But I can always go to the other side. \nPEKEC There is no proof-- \nLambeau can no longer contain himself. \nLAMBEAU Maker builds \"K\" to the \"N.\" N is three to the K times-- \nPEKEC --But-- \nWILL Look, I wrote it down. \nThey turn to Will who places his proof on the projector. The image is cast over their faces. It reads: \nAs Pekec reads and the realization dawns on him: \nWILL It's just simpler this way. \nLambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding Pekec. \nLAMBEAU Alexander, your theory is changed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nWill and Skylar in her room, post coital. They are wrapped in a sheet. Will is absent-mindedly playing the memory game SIMON. \nEXT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- LATER \nEveryone is walking out, saying good-bye. Chuckie goes over to Will and Skylar. \nCHUCKIE I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people. \nSKYLAR See ya' Chuckie. I had fun. \nChuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight. \nWILL I don't know what the fuck you're doin'.  You're givin' us a ride. \nCHUCKIE What do I look like, Al Cowlins? (seriously) You want to take my car, drop her off? \nWILL I was countin' on it. \nMORGAN Chuck, let's go. \nCHUCKIE You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car. \nMorgan mumbles something and staggers off. Billy follows with an indifferent shrug. \nWILL Thanks, Chuck. \nCHUCKIE Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. \nWILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way. \nCHUCKIE Just 'cause you don't have to sleep in the one room palace, don't start thinkin' you're bad. \nSKYLAR (to Will) I thought you said you'd show me your place. \nWILL Not tonight. \nCHUCKIE Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. \nHe knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit. \nSKYLAR I wanted to meet your brothers... \nChuckie gives Will a curious look. \nWILL They're all sleepin' now. (a beat, to Chuckie) Let me get those keys. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FACULTY CLUB -- NIGHT \nA cocktail party is underway. Professors mingle with \nrepresentatives from high tech companies. Lambeau stands holding a drink and surrounded by several RECRUITERS. Apparently he's the star of the show. \nRECRUITER #1 What I want to know, Gerry, is when we get to meet this wonder-boy. \nLAMBEAU We're still working together, the boy's a little rough. \nRECRUITER #2 We've got our share of eccentric geniuses at Tri-tech. We know how to deal with that. \nRECRUITER #3 I think we all do. \nLaughter. \nRECRUITER #1 If you're not exaggerating, Gerry-- \nLAMBEAU Was I exaggerating in nineteen eighty- four when I told you I'd win the Field's medal within two years? \nMore laughter. \nRECRUITER #1 In that case the boy could run shipping for us, routing-- \nRECRUITER #2 You say he doesn't have a diploma, but we'll\u0097 \nRECRUITER #1 I don't need to see a driver's license.  I can think of three departments right now that he could head up for us. \nLAMBEAU At ease, gentlemen. We're looking carefully at all our options. \nRECRUITER #3 All right, Gerry. Close to the vest. (gives him his card) Good luck with these vultures. \nHe walks off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TIMMY'S TAP -- DAY \nTimmy's Tap is a local watering hole, not unlike the L Street Bar. Sean is at the bar, telling a joke to TIMMY (45) the owner of the place, and several other REGULARS. \nSEAN So she goes runnin' up the aisle and I figure \"fuck it\" and I yell out \"don't forget the coffee! \nThe men erupt in laughter. MARTY, one of the regulars pipe up. \nMARTY Bullshit! You didn't say that! \nTimmy and Sean exchange a look. \nLAMBEAU No, Sean. This boy has that gift. He just hasn't got the direction. We can give that to him. \nA beat. \nSEAN He married his cousin. \nLAMBEAU Who? \nSEAN Einstein. Had two marriages, both trainwrecks.  The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum- possible Unabomber addition-- \nLAMBEAU You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They-- \nSEAN I do. \nLAMBEAU Well, you're the only one. \nBeat. \nLAMBEAU This boy can make contributions to the world. We can help him do that. \nSEAN Just... take it easy, Gerry. \nLAMBEAU Look, I don't know what else I can say.  I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal. \nSEAN Maybe he doesn't care about that. \nA beat. \nLAMBEAU Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry-- \nSEAN Now wait a minute, Gerry-- \nLAMBEAU No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy-- \nSEAN Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you. \nLAMBEAU Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine. \nSEAN Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants. \nLAMBEAU That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you. \nA beat. Lambeau gets up. \nLAMBEAU Sean, I came here today out of courtesy.  I wanted to keep you in the loop. As we speak the boy is in a meeting I set up for him over at Tri-tech. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, OFFICE -- SAME \nThree well dressed TRI-TECH EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table, which is littered with promotional brochures. The executives exchange a confused look. One of them speaks. \nEXECUTIVE (tentative) Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure what you mean, we've already offered you a position.. \nCut to reveal: Chuckie sitting across from the executives, hair combed down, wearing his Sunday best. \nCHUCKIE Since this is obviously not my first time in such altercations, let me say this: \nChuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together, indicating \"cash.\" The executives are baffled. \nCHUCKIE Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. \nThe executives are completely blank. \nCHUCKIE At the current time I am looking at a number of different fields from which to disseminate which offer is most pursuant aid to my benefit. (a beat) What do you want? What do I want? What does anybody want? Leniency. \nEXECUTIVE I'm not sure-- \nCHUCKIE --These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated. \nChuckie puts his hands up, as if getting a vibe from the room. \nEXECUTIVE Okay... \nChuckie points to the third executive. \nCHUCKIE He knows what I'm talking about. \nThe third executive is baffled. \nCHUCKIE A retainer. Nobody in this town works without a retainer. You think you can find someone who does, you have my blessin'. But I think we all know that person isn't going to represent you as well as I can. \nEXECUTIVE Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits. \nCHUCKIE Retainer... \nEXECUTIVE You want us to give you cash right now? \nCHUCKIE Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now. \nThe executives exchange looks and go for their wallets. \nEXECUTIVE I don't think I... Larry? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHUCKIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY \nChuckie sits on his couch, watching cartoons in his boxers and a tee-shirt, eating cereal. The doorbell rings. He sits. \nCHUCKIE Get it, ma! \nShe doesn't. He gets up. Opens door. It's Skylar. \nCHUCKIE (surprised) Hey. \nSKYLAR Hi. \nCHUCKIE How you doin'? \nSKYLAR Good. \nAn awkward beat. \nCHUCKIE How'd you know where to find me? \nSKYLAR (smiles) You were the only Sullivan in the phone book. \nChuckie smiles. \nSKYLAR Will and I dropped you off here, remember? \nCHUCKIE Oh, right. \nSKYLAR This is your house, right? \nChuckie nods and is about to respond when he is interrupted by a nagging shriek from his mom. \nCHUCKIE'S MOM (O.S.) Get in here, Chuckie! \nCHUCKIE (calling back) Pipe down, Ma! \nSKYLAR I guess so. \nCHUCKIE What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that. \nSKYLAR Is this a bad time? \nCHUCKIE She'll live. (beat) If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but... \nSKYLAR Okay. \nCHUCKIE Let's take a walk. \nEXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY \nChuckie, still in his boxers walks with Skylar who is talking. \nSKYLAR See, now this doesn't feel right. (beat) When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies-- \nCHUCKIE You caught that, huh? \nSKYLAR I just wanted to find out what was going on... But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it? \nCHUCKIE Well, I don't have no trousers on... \nShe laughs. A beat. \nCHUCKIE I know why you're here. Will don't talk much. \nSKYLAR I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me. \nCHUCKIE I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way. (beat) Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that-- \nMAN ON PORCH Put some clothes on, Sullivan! \nCHUCKIE Take it easy father! \nShe laughs. \nCHUCKIE All I can say is; I known Will a long time -- And I seen him with every girl he's ever been with. But I've never seen him like this before, ever with anyone, like how he is with you. \nSKYLAR Is that true? \nCHUCKIE Yeah, it is. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY \nTom and Will are sitting waiting for Lambeau. \nTOM \nWILL \nLambeau enters going over a thick proof Will has completed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nWill sits across from Sean. \nSEAN So you might be working for Uncle Sam. \nWILL I don't know. \nSEAN Gerry says the meeting went well. \nWILL I guess. \nSEAN What did you think? \nWILL What did I think? \nA beat. Will has obviously been stewing on this. \nWILL Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. So I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well.  But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never had a problem with get killed. (rapid fire) Now the politicians are sayin' \"send in the Marines to secure the area\" 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass.  And he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck. A cute, little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And naturally they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink seven and sevens and play slalom with the icebergs and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil, and kills all the sea-life in the North Atlantic. So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive so he's got to walk to the job interviews which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue-plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. \nA beat. \nWILL So what'd I think?  I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure I'll eliminate the middle man. Why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? Christ, I could be elected President. \nSEAN Do you think you're alone? \nWILL What? \nSEAN Do you have a soul-mate? \nWILL Define that. \nSEAN Someone who challenges you in every way.  Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate. \nWILL Yeah. \nSean waits. \nWILL Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost, O'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant-- \nSEAN They're all dead. \nWILL Not to me, they're not. \nSEAN But you can't give back to them, Will. \nWILL Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no... \nSEAN That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road. \nWILL Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this? \nSEAN Don't give me your line of shit. \nWILL I didn't want the job. \nSEAN It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do? \nWILL I didn't ask for this. \nSEAN Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out. \nWILL Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that. \nSEAN You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man. \nA beat. Will says nothing. \nSEAN And when they get drunk and puke in the sink, they don't have to see it the next morning because of you. That's real work, Will. And there is honor in that.  Which I'm sure is why you took the job. \nA beat. \nSEAN I just want to know why you decided to sneak around at night, writing on chalkboards and lying about it. (beat) 'Cause there's no honor in that. \nWill is silent. \nSEAN Something you want to say? \nSean gets up, goes to the door and opens it. \nSEAN Why don't you come back when you have an answer for me. \nWILL What? \nSEAN If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time. \nWILL What? \nWill loses it, slams the door shut. \nWILL Fuck you! \nThey embrace. \nSEAN No. Thank you. \nWILL (re: embrace) Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship? \nSEAN Only if you grab my ass. \nThey laugh. \nWILL See ya. \nSEAN Good luck. \nBoth men smile. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SEAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nWill comes out of Sean's office and sees Lambeau walking up. \nLAMBEAU (surprised) Will. \nWILL Hey, how you doin'? \nLAMBEAU You know, you're no longer required to come here. \nWILL I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean. \nLAMBEAU (a beat) Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week. \nWill nods. \nLAMBEAU Well, that's, I think that's terrific. Congratulations. \nWILL Thank you. \nLAMBEAU I just want you to know... It's been a pleasure. \nWILL Bullshit. \nThey laugh. \nLAMBEAU This job... Do it if it's what you really want. \nWILL I appreciate that. \nA moment. Will starts to go, Lambeau watches him for a beat, Will turns back around. \nWILL Hey, Gerry. \nLAMBEAU Yes. \nWILL Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call. \nLAMBEAU (has to smile) Thank you, Will. I'll do that. \nWill smiles, turns and walks away. \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSean is packing his office. Lambeau opens the door. \nLAMBEAU Hello, Sean. \nSEAN Come in. \nLAMBEAU Sean... \nSEAN (a beat) Me too. \nA moment. \nLAMBEAU So I hear you're taking some time. \nSEAN Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit. \nLAMBEAU Where're you going? \nSEAN I don't know. India maybe. \nLAMBEAU Why there? \nSEAN Never been. \nLambeau nods. \nLAMBEAU Do you know when you'll be back? \nSEAN (picks up a flyer from his desk) I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months. \nLAMBEAU I got one of those too. \n", "test1_input": "SKYLAR Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else-- \nWILL Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry-- \nSKYLAR Is that what you think-- \nWILL some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too. \nSKYLAR I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died. \nWILL At least you have a mother. \nSKYLAR Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back.  I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid. \nWILL What the fuck am I afraid of?! \nSKYLAR You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what?  I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you. \nWILL I'm not honest? \nSKYLAR What about your twelve brothers? \nWILL Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear? \nSKYLAR Yes, Will. I didn't even know that? \nWILL No, you don't want to hear that. \nSKYLAR Yes, I do, Will. \nWILL You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery. \nWill lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch SCAR on his torso. \nWILL You don't want to hear that. Don't tell me you want to hear that shit!! \nSKYLAR Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team? \nWILL What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says \"save me\" on my back? \nSKYLAR I don't want to \"save\" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you! \nWill, full of self-loathing, raises his hand to strike her. \nWILL Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me! \nSKYLAR (standing up to him) You know what I want to hear?  I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life. \nA beat. Will looks Skylar dead in the eye. Lowers his hand. \nWILL I don't love you. \nHe walks out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- NIGHT \nWill leaves pulling on his clothes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, OFFICE -- DAY \nWill sits across from two N.S.A. AGENTS, OLIVER DYTRESS and ROBERT TAVANO. These guys are smug, clean cut, gung-ho and looking sharp in twin navy blue suits. \nWILL So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency? \nDYTRESS Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms-- \nWILL Codebreaking. \nDYTRESS That's one aspect of what we do. \nWILL Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A. \nDYTRESS That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't \"why should you work for N.S.A.\" it's \"why shouldn't you?\" \nWILL Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one. \nWill bites his tongue, trying to make this work. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHUCKIE'S HOUSE -- DAY \nChuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen. Billy cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page. Both boys are smoking. Will drinks a beer, distractedly. We hear the faint music track and soft moans of a PORNO MOVIE emanating from a back room. After a beat, Chuckie looks up. \nCHUCKIE Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room again I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'! \nAfter a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced. \nMORGAN (innocently) What's up guys? \n", "test1_true": "MORGAN I don't have a VCR at my house. \nWill pays no attention to this exchange \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SOUTH BOSTON PAY PHONE -- DAY \nWill is on pay phone talking to Skylar. \nWILL I just wanted to call before you left. (beat) I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker. \nINT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY \nSKYLAR I never cared about that. \nAn awkward beat. \nWILL Yeah. \nSKYLAR I love you, Will. (pause) No take-backs. \nWill says nothing. \nSKYLAR Will? \nA beat. \nWILL Take care. \nSKYLAR Goodbye. \nWill hangs up. Hold on him for an agonizing beat. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nLambeau is scribbling away at work. Tom is taking notes. Will is tapping his fingers, waiting for him to finish. \nLAMBEAU I can... I'm almost there. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOGAN AIRPORT TERMINAL -- SAME \nSkylar stands at the gate, carry-ons in hand. Her flight is boarding. She looks for Will over the crowd. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- SAME \nWill picks up a FRAME from Sean's desk. It is CARLTON FISK'S BASEBALL CARD. Will has to smile. Lambeau looks up. \nLAMBEAU What are you smiling at? \nWILL It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card. \nWill can see that Lambeau wants more. \nWILL Pudge Fisk. You follow baseball? \nLAMBEAU No. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOGAN AIRPORT TERMINAL -- SAME \nThe final boarding call is announced and the last passenger boards. After a beat, Skylar turns and gets on the plane. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- SAME \nWill, holding the card, reflects for a beat and puts it down. \nWILL Oh, well, it's just somethin' Sean told me. It's a long story. \nA beat. \nWILL You all set? \nLAMBEAU I've got the first part. The rest I can do at home. \nWill gets up. \nLAMBEAU Will, the N.S.A. has been calling me just about every hour. They're very excited about how the meeting went. \nLambeau is excited. Will clearly is not. \nWILL Yeah. \n", "test1_id": 369, "test2_input": "WILL Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years. \nCHUCKIE Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank. \nWILL Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat. \nCHUCKIE It's a way outta here. \nWILL What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field. \nCHUCKIE Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you. \nWILL Chuckie, what are you talkin'... \nCHUCKIE Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have. \nWILL Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to? \nCHUCKIE Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it.  But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years. \nWILL You don't know that. \nCHUCKIE Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left. \nA beat. \nCHUCKIE Now, I don't know much. But I know that. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nLambeau stands across from Sean, seething. \nLAMBEAU This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out-- \nSEAN Now wait a minute-- \nLAMBEAU --And confuse him-- \nSEAN --Gerry-- \nLAMBEAU And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake-- \nSEAN Hold on! \nLAMBEAU Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this. \nSEAN I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here! \nLAMBEAU Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy -- I don't care if you have a few laughs -- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here. \nSEAN \"Undermine?\" \nLAMBEAU He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point-- \nSEAN He is at a fragile point. He's got problems-- \nLAMBEAU What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with-- \nSEAN Why do you think he does that, Gerry? \nLAMBEAU He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you. \nSEAN Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most! \nLAMBEAU Oh, come on, Sean-- \nSEAN And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty! \nLAMBEAU Oh, that's nice-- \nSEAN And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him! \nLAMBEAU Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been-- \nSEAN --I'm not angry at you-- \nLAMBEAU Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had. \nSEAN --I don't have any anger at you-- \nLAMBEAU Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure. \nSEAN That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions!  Because I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And your Goddamn Medal! \nLAMBEAU Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy-- \nSEAN I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on! \nLAMBEAU That's right!  You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault. \nSEAN I don't blame you! It's not about that!  It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him- won't see you make him feel like a failure too! \n", "test2_true": "SEAN If you push him into something, if you ride him-- \nLAMBEAU You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself! \nSEAN He's not you! \nA beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean turns to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway. \nWILL I can come back. \nLAMBEAU No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving. \nThere is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and leaves. \nWILL Well, I'm here. (beat) So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy. \nSEAN Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way. And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you. \nWILL Do you want to talk about it? \nSean smiles. A beat. Will sees a FILE on Sean's desk. \nWILL What's that? \nSEAN Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation. \nWILL You're not going to fail me are you? \nSean smiles. \nWILL So what's it say? \nSEAN You want to read it? \nWILL No. (beat) Have you had any experience with that? \nSEAN Twenty years of counseling you see a lot of-- \nWILL No, have you had any experience with that? \nSEAN Yes. \nWILL (smiles) It sure ain't good. \nINT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK \nFrom a child's P.O.V. we see a man, partially obscured by a doorframe. The man turns toward the P.O.V. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSEAN (after a pause) My dad used to make us walk down to the park and collect the sticks he was going to beat us with. Actually the worst of the beatings were between me and my brother. We would practice on each other trying to find sticks that would break. \nWILL He used to just put a belt, a stick and a wrench on the kitchen table and say \"choose.\" \nINT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK \nA large, callused hand sets down a wrench next to a stick. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSEAN Gotta go with the belt there... \nWILL I used to go with the wrench. \nSEAN The wrench, why? \nWILL Cause fuck him, that's why. \nA long quiet moment. \nWILL Is that why me and Skylar broke up? \nSEAN I didn't know you had. Do you want to talk about that? (beat) I don't know a lot, Will. But let me tell you one thing. All this history, this shit... (indicates file) Look here, son. \nWill, who had been looking away, loos at Sean. \nSEAN This is not your fault. \nWILL (nonchalant) Oh, I know. \nSEAN It's not your fault. \nWILL (smiles) I know. \nSEAN It's not your fault. \nWILL I know. \n", "test2_id": 370, "test3_input": "SEAN It's not your fault. \nWILL (dead serious) I know. \nSEAN It's not your fault. \nWILL Don't fuck with me. \nSEAN (comes around desk, sits in front of Will) It's not your fault. \nWILL (tears start) I know. \nSEAN It's not... \nWILL (crying hard) I know, I know... \nSean takes Will in his arms and holds him like a child. Will sobs like a baby. After a moment, he wraps his arms around Sean and holds him, even tighter. We pull back from this image. Two lonely souls being father and son together. \nINT. RED LINE CAR -- DUSK \nWill rides the Red Line, above ground. He looks out over the landscape. Small back yards, laundry hangs from wire lines. \nChainlink fences, overgrown with weeds. \nEXT. SOUTH BOSTON PARK -- DAY \nWill walking through South Boston. He cuts through a park. A senior citizen is spearing trach for the city. \nINT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nWill at home. Not reading.

TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, RECEPTION -- CONTINUOUS \nWill walks into the lobby. A SECURITY GUARD looks up. \nSECURITY GUARD Can I help you? \nWILL Yeah, my name is Will Hunting. I'm here about a position. \nSECURITY GUARD One moment. \nThe guard reaches for the phone. \nDISSOLVE TO BLACK. \nFADE UP to the sound of laughter. \nINT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- DAY \nChuckie is again regaling Will and the guys at their table. \nCHUCKIE Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you. \nMORGAN Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before. \nCHUCKIE Oh, Morgan. \nThey both get up, in one another's face. This is a play fight. \n\"You gonna start?\" \"You gonna pay my hospital bills?\" \nWILL Sorry to miss this. \nINT. L STREET -- SAME \nWill comes back from the bathroom. \nWILL (to Chuckie) You and Morgan throw? \nCHUCKIE No, I had to talk him down. \nWILL Why didn't you yoke him? \nCHUCKIE Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude.  I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down. \nMORGAN (from across the table) What'd you say about me? \nCHUCKIE Shut the fuck up. \nBilly walks in the door and give Chuckie a look. Chuckie turns to Will. \nCHUCKIE (To Will) Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday. \nMORGAN You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in. \nLaughter as the boys converge on Will. He goes willingly out the door. \n", "test3_true": "As they come out the door, rather than beating Will mercilessly, they stop. Morgan goes into his own, personal rendition of \"Danny Boy.\" No one joins in. \nCHUCKIE Shut up, Morgan. (to Will) Here's your present. \nChuckie indicates an old CHEVY NOVA, parked illegally in front of the bar. \nWILL You're kiddin' me. \nCHUCKIE Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day... \nLaughter. \nCHUCKIE Morgan wanted to get you a \"T\" pass. \nMORGAN No I didn't... \nWill approaches the car to take a closer look. \nCHUCKIE But you're twenty-one now, so-- \nBILLY Yeah, now that you can drink legally, we thought the best thing to get you was a car. \nMore laughter. Will inspects the Nova. \nWILL You're kiddin' me. (a beat) This is the ugliest fuckin' car I ever seen in my life. \nLaughter, a beat. \nWILL (serious) How the fuck did you guys do this? \nCHUCKIE Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day. \nMORGAN Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo? \nCHUCKIE Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car. \nWILL So, you finally got a job Morgan? \nMORGAN Had one, now I'm fucked again. \nWILL (to Chuckie) So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house? \nCHUCKIE Fuck you. I re-built the engine myself.  That thing could make it to Hawaii if you wanted it to. \nChuckie gives Will a look. \nCHUCKIE Happy 21, Will. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nWill sits across from Sean. \nSEAN Which one did you take, Will? \nWILL Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with.

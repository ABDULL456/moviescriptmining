{"test1_input": "LAMBEAU You were missed. (beat) How long has it been since we've seen each other? \nSEAN Since Nancy died. \nLAMBEAU I'm sorry, that damn conference-- \nSEAN I got your card. \nINT. HARVARD SQ. DINER: \"THE TASTY\" -- NIGHT \nA FRY COOK hands Will and Skylar a pair of CHEESEBURGERS. \nSKYLAR Have you ever seen Annie Hall? \nWILL No. \nSKYLAR Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing. \nWill smiles. \nWILL I really don't 'date' that much. \nSKYLAR (laughs) You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it. \nWILL No I haven't... \nSKYLAR Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss. \nWILL (mock protest) No I wasn't... \nSKYLAR Yes you were. \nWILL I was kinda' hopin' to get a \"good night laid\" but... I'll take a kiss. \nShe laughs. \nSKYLAR Oh, you will? \nWILL No... I was hoping to get a kiss. \nSKYLAR Then why don't we just get it out of the way. \nHe looks at her. \nWILL Now? \nBoth of them have cheeseburger in their mouths. \nSKYLAR Yeah. \nThey kiss, mouths full of burger. It's nice. A beat. \nSKYLAR That had to be the worst good night kiss... \nWill laughs. \nWILL Hey, look lady, I'm just here for the free food. \nShe smiles. \nSKYLAR Free? \nWILL Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels. \nShe laughs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- SAME \nLambeau and Sean, having finished their meal. Lambeau has been pitching Sean. \nSEAN I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule. \nLAMBEAU This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him. \nSEAN Not much free time, Gerry. \nLAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan? \nSean nods his head. \nSEAN Yeah. \nLAMBEAU He was alive over a hundred years ago.  He was Indian. Dots, not feathers... \nSean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles. \nLAMBEAU So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny hut in India. No formal education, no access to other works. But he came across an old math book and from this basic text he was able to extrapolate theories that had baffled mathematicians for years. \nSEAN And he mailed it to Hardy-- \nLAMBEAU That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England. \n", "test1_true": "LAMBEAU They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done.  Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him. \nSEAN Why me? \nLAMBEAU I need someone with your kind of background. \nSEAN My kind of background? \nLAMBEAU You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston. \nSEAN He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me? \nLAMBEAU (looks squarely at Sean) Five. \nSean gives a slight, knowing smile. \nSEAN Who? Barry, Henry, Rick... \nLambeau nods. \nSEAN Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick? \nLAMBEAU Just meet with the boy once a week. \nSEAN Can we do it at my office? \nLAMBEAU That would be fine. \nThe waiter comes with the CHECK. Each man reaches for it. \nLAMBEAU Sean, please. \nSEAN I got it. \nLAMBEAU It's on the college. \nSean relents. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- MORNING \nEstablishing shot of the red-brick campus. Planes land at nearby Logan airport. Will walks up the steps. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSean's office is comfortable. Books are stacked against the wall. There is a PAINTING on the wall behind Sean. Sean is seated behind a desk. Lambeau sits in a chair in the back of the room, next to Tom. A long beat passes, they wait. \nLAMBEAU Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit. \nSEAN I'll be okay. \nLAMBEAU It's a poker game with this young man.  Don't let him see what you've got. \nSean nods. Will walks in. Everyone stands to greet Will. \nLAMBEAU Hello, Will. Any trouble finding the place? \nWILL No. \nLAMBEAU Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting. \nSean and Will nod. An awkward moment as the four men stand. \nLAMBEAU Well, let's get started. \nWILL Yeah, let's let the healing begin. \nLambeau is slightly embarrassed. Sean smiles at Will's joke. \nSEAN Would you excuse us? \nLAMBEAU Tom. \nSEAN You too, Gerry. \nLambeau looks at Sean, surprised. Sean's stare is unwavering. \nAfter an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will alone. Will doesn't look at Sean for more than a second. He seems more interested in the room. There is a long silence as Sean watches Will. \nSEAN Hello, Will. I'm Sean Maguire. \nA smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and sits. \nHe lights a cigarette. Sean continues to watch him. Finally- \nSEAN Where are you from in Southie? \nWILL Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a \"shrink kit\" that comes with all these volumes included? \n", "test1_id": 369, "test2_input": "SEAN Have you read all these books, Will? \nWILL Probably not. \nSEAN (indicating a shelf) How about the ones on that shelf? \nWill's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant. \nWILL Yeah, I read those. \nSEAN What did you think? \nWILL I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.  They're your books, why don't you read 'em? \nSEAN I did. \nWILL That must have taken you a long time. \nSEAN Yeah, it did take me a long time. \nSean says this with pride. His determined stare and confident manner catch Will a bit off guard. Will rises from his chair and goes to the shelf. \nWILL (looking at book) \"A History of the United States, Volume I.\" If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's \"A People's History of the United States.\" That book will knock you on your ass. \nSEAN How about Noam Chomsky's \"Manufacturing Consent?\" \nWILL You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books. \nSEAN You think so? \nWILL Whatever blows your hair back. \nWill returns to his chair. Pause. \nSEAN (indicating cigarette) Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth. \nWILL You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing. \nSean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude. He remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his face. Will is aware of Sean's confidence. \nWILL Do you lift? \nSEAN Yes, I do. \nWILL Nautilus? \nSEAN Free weights. \nWILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench? \nSEAN \nWILL Oh. \nWill gets up again and moves around his chair to Sean's painting. It is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous storm -- by no means a masterpiece. Will studies it. \nWILL You paint this? \nSEAN Yeah. Do you paint? \nWILL No. \nSEAN Crayons? \nWILL This is a real piece of shit. \nSEAN Tell me what you really think. \nWILL Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me. \nSEAN What does? \nWILL The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting. \nSEAN What is? \nWILL I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off. \nSEAN Oh, \"Starry Night\" time, huh? \nWILL You ever heard the saying, \"any port in a storm?\" \nSEAN Sure, how 'bout \"still waters run deep\"- \nWILL --Well, maybe that means you. \nSEAN Maybe what mea-- \nWILL Maybe you were in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the waves were crashing over the bow, the Goddamned mast was about to snap, and you were crying for the harbor. So you did what you had to do, to get out.  Maybe you became a psychologist. \nSEAN Maybe you should be a patient and sit down. \nWILL Maybe you married the wrong woman. \n", "test2_true": "WILL That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else? \nSean is walking slowly towards Will. \nWILL How are the seas now, D-- \nIn a flash, Sean has Will by the throat. Will is helpless. \nSEAN If you ever disrespect my wife again... I will end you. \nWILL Time's up. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS \nWill walks out of Sean's office past Lambeau and Tom who are sitting in the hallway. \nWILL At ease, gentlemen. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSean stands behind his desk in his office, still very much on edge. Lambeau walks in. \nLAMBEAU Five minutes, Sean. Are you okay? \nA pause, Sean is staring at his painting. \nLAMBEAU I'll understand if you don't want to meet with him again. \nSEAN Thursday, four o'clock. Make sure the kid is here. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WONDERLAND RACETRACK -- DAY \nWill and Skylar sit in the stands watching the dogs run. They ad lib teasing one another about England, Ireland, and America. \nSKYLAR You grew up around here? \nWILL Not far from here, South Boston. \nSKYLAR How was that? \nWILL Pretty boring, I guess. \nShe smiles. \nSKYLAR I bet you have a great family. \nWILL You know, nothing special. \nSKYLAR You have a lot of brothers and sisters? \nWILL Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters? \nSKYLAR Yeah. \nWILL Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think? \nSKYLAR How many? \nWILL You wouldn't believe me if I told you. \nSKYLAR What, five? \nWill shakes his head. \nSKYLAR Seven? \nWill shakes his head. Smiles. \nSKYLAR Come on. \nWILL I have twelve big brothers. \nSKYLAR Not a chance. \nWILL Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen. \nSKYLAR Bullshit. \nWILL I swear to God. \nSKYLAR Your house must have been a zoo. \nWILL It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice. \nSKYLAR Do you know all their names? \n", "test2_id": 370, "test3_input": "WILL Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years. \nCHUCKIE Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank. \nWILL Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat. \nCHUCKIE It's a way outta here. \nWILL What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field. \nCHUCKIE Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you. \nWILL Chuckie, what are you talkin'... \nCHUCKIE Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have. \nWILL Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to? \nCHUCKIE Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it.  But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years. \nWILL You don't know that. \nCHUCKIE Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left. \nA beat. \nCHUCKIE Now, I don't know much. But I know that. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nLambeau stands across from Sean, seething. \nLAMBEAU This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out-- \nSEAN Now wait a minute-- \nLAMBEAU --And confuse him-- \nSEAN --Gerry-- \nLAMBEAU And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake-- \nSEAN Hold on! \nLAMBEAU Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this. \nSEAN I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here! \nLAMBEAU Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy -- I don't care if you have a few laughs -- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here. \nSEAN \"Undermine?\" \nLAMBEAU He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point-- \nSEAN He is at a fragile point. He's got problems-- \nLAMBEAU What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with-- \nSEAN Why do you think he does that, Gerry? \nLAMBEAU He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you. \nSEAN Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most! \nLAMBEAU Oh, come on, Sean-- \nSEAN And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty! \nLAMBEAU Oh, that's nice-- \nSEAN And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him! \nLAMBEAU Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been-- \nSEAN --I'm not angry at you-- \nLAMBEAU Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had. \nSEAN --I don't have any anger at you-- \nLAMBEAU Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure. \nSEAN That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions!  Because I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And your Goddamn Medal! \nLAMBEAU Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy-- \nSEAN I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on! \nLAMBEAU That's right!  You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault. \nSEAN I don't blame you! It's not about that!  It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him- won't see you make him feel like a failure too! \n", "test3_true": "SEAN If you push him into something, if you ride him-- \nLAMBEAU You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself! \nSEAN He's not you! \nA beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean turns to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway. \nWILL I can come back. \nLAMBEAU No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving. \nThere is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and leaves. \nWILL Well, I'm here. (beat) So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy. \nSEAN Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way. And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you. \nWILL Do you want to talk about it? \nSean smiles. A beat. Will sees a FILE on Sean's desk. \nWILL What's that? \nSEAN Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation. \nWILL You're not going to fail me are you? \nSean smiles. \nWILL So what's it say? \nSEAN You want to read it? \nWILL No. (beat) Have you had any experience with that? \nSEAN Twenty years of counseling you see a lot of-- \nWILL No, have you had any experience with that? \nSEAN Yes. \nWILL (smiles) It sure ain't good. \nINT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK \nFrom a child's P.O.V. we see a man, partially obscured by a doorframe. The man turns toward the P.O.V. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSEAN (after a pause) My dad used to make us walk down to the park and collect the sticks he was going to beat us with. Actually the worst of the beatings were between me and my brother. We would practice on each other trying to find sticks that would break. \nWILL He used to just put a belt, a stick and a wrench on the kitchen table and say \"choose.\" \nINT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK \nA large, callused hand sets down a wrench next to a stick. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSEAN Gotta go with the belt there... \nWILL I used to go with the wrench. \nSEAN The wrench, why? \nWILL Cause fuck him, that's why. \nA long quiet moment. \nWILL Is that why me and Skylar broke up? \nSEAN I didn't know you had. Do you want to talk about that? (beat) I don't know a lot, Will. But let me tell you one thing. All this history, this shit... (indicates file) Look here, son. \nWill, who had been looking away, loos at Sean. \nSEAN This is not your fault. \nWILL (nonchalant) Oh, I know. \nSEAN It's not your fault. \nWILL (smiles) I know. \nSEAN It's not your fault. \nWILL I know. \n", "test3_id": 371}

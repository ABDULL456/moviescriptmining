IN THE TRANSPORTO 
Ackerman stares at the monitor with Frank's face on it. He's quietly furious. 
ACKERMAN What is that fool doing in the middle of my operation? 
AT THE RESTAURANT 
Cara stares slack-jawed at Frank. 
He has given himself a complete make-over.    New haircut. Pearce's suit fits him well. 
He looks terrific. Cara notices before quickly recovering her composure. 
FRANK Time for Alexander and me to meet face to face. 
CARA (quietly) I don't know what you're talking about. Please go, I'd like to have a quiet coffee. 
Frank sits at the table with Cara and eats a CASHEW. 
IN THE TRANSPORTO 
Ackerman barks whispered orders into the speaker: 
ACKERMAN (frustrated) Move off. Move off. 
The UNDERCOVER WAITER quickly moves away from Cara's table. 
Ackerman stares at the monitor which captures Cara's angry expression. 
ACKERMAN (CONT'D) (talking to the screen) Get rid of him! 
AT THE POOLSIDE RESTAURANT 
Defiantly, Frank pulls his chair in closer to Cara.    He signals to a different THIN WAITER. 
FRANK (to the waiter) Caffe, per favore? 
Frank turns back to Cara, who calls out-- 
CARA Cameriere!   No caffe for signor! 
FRANK (contradicting her) With milk! 
She stares at him. 
CARA Do you want to be dead? 
FRANK Not particularly, but I'm tired of being afraid. I've been running around like a frightened mouse long enough and I've decided I'm finished. 
Frank pulls out a Gitane cigarette.   He lights it, smoking while he talks. 
FRANK (CONT'D) When I first saw the name I got scared: "Alexander Pearce." He even sounds like some super cool master criminal with Russian enemies and the beautiful girlfriend... he probably works out. He might own a pizza shop on the side for all I know. 
Frank frowns at the cigarette. 
FRANK (CONT'D) These are disgusting. 
INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY 
Goyal is seated at the communication station. 
ON THE MONITOR - Frank is settled in opposite Cara. 
GOYAL He's not going anywhere. 
Ackerman peers directly out the window, as if he's going to see something different. 
ACKERMAN Put Lipetti in. Tell him to play it like he's dealing with a rowdy guest-- escort him out. 
EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY 
Cara looks all around.   No sign of any suitor approaching. 
CLOSE ON: the hands of the THIN WAITER, who sprinkles pepper carefully, presumably onto a dish. He then platters the dish and lifts it over his shoulder. 
CARA Frank, you have no idea what you're sticking your nose into. 
FRANK Probably not. But I'm doing it anyway. Alexander Pearce nearly got me killed. It was his idea, right? (MORE) 
FRANK (CONT'D) He told you to pick out some random sap on the train to take a bullet for him, didn't he?

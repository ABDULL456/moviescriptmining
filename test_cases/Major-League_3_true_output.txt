A motorcycle pulls to a stop in the lot, diverting everyone's attention from Hayes. 
Off steps Ricky Vaughn, a hefty bag over his shoulder. He's still sporting his radical do. 
PEPPER Look at this fuckin' guy. 
TEMPLE Maybe he's the mascot. 
Donovan is speechless. Brown breaks into a small smile. Yes, sir, this is his kinda team. 
INT. PLAYERS' BARRACKS 
Taylor is putting his stuff away in a locker. Vaughn enters the barracks and immediately draws the attention of Dorn. 
DORN Hey, what do we have here? Guy looks like a fuckin' toilet brush. Hey, T.B., I love your pony tail. And the earring's cute too. Where's the matching bracelet? 
Vaughn whips a hard glance at Dorn, but keeps on walking, making his way along the bunks looking for his assigned bed. It's the one above Taylor. Vaughn unloads his duffel bag in silence. 
TAYLOR (offering his hand) Jake Taylor. 
Vaughn shakes it and nods. Says nothing. 
TAYLOR So, you just gonna settle for toilet brush, or you got another name? 
VAUGHN Vaughn. Rick Vaughn. 
TAYLOR Forget about Dorn. He's always a little tough on rookies. You'll get a lot worse from other teams. 
The conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Hayes. 
HAYES Say hey! How ya doin'? Willie Mays Hayes here. 
TAYLOR Jake Taylor. (pointing to Vaughn) Rick Vaughn. 
Hayes doesn't quite know what to make of Vaughn. 
HAYES What the hell league you been playin' in? 
VAUGHN California Penal. 
HAYES Never heard of it. How'd you wind up playin' there? 
VAUGHN I stole a car. 
On Hayes' look, we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE BARRACKS - NIGHT 
It's dark. Everyone's asleep. Three SECURITY GUARDS with flashlights come down to the top bunk where Hayes is sleeping. 
GUARD This guy wasn't invited to camp. 
They lift the bunk out of its slots and carry it out the door, Hayes still asleep on it. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - MORNING 
The players are dressing out in their uniforms for the first day of practice. Vaughn goes in his locker and finds that a slit has been cut in the back of his cap to accommodate his pigtail. Suppressed laughs are heard from several corners of the locker room. 
INT. CLUBHOUSE - MORNING 
Brown is addressing his troops before the first workout. 
BROWN Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen. Most managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open, that nobody's a lock at any position, and that talent isn't everything. They'd rather see desire and discipline in a player. Then they tell you that most of all they want you to have fun out there, even though they're gonna work your ass off on fundamentals and condition you till you drop. The difference between me and those other managers is... (pause) I mean it. 
On a locker room full of uneasy faces, we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PRACTICE FIELD PARKING LOT - MORNING 
Hayes' cot is sitting in the lot, just outside the fence, his suitcase set down next to it. Hayes is still asleep, dew on his forehead. Wakened by the noise of activity on the field, he sits up with a start. 
HAYES Shit, I been cut already? 
THE PRACTICE FIELD 
We pick up Taylor sprinting his ass off in a 100-yard time trial, staggering across the finish line 10 feet behind Cerrano. 
PEPPER (checking stopwatch) 11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you'd fallen down. 
As Taylor tries to catch his breath, Dorn and a relief pitcher named Gant approach the starting line for the next trial.

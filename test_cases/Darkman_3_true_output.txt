ATTENDANT Get lost, buddy. 
338 BRIEF CUTS People screaming on the Tilt-A-Whirl. Merry-Go-Round horses bobbing up and down. Calliope music gets louder and louder. 
339 PEYTONN Shaking under the pressure of contained rage, his vein bulging, throbbing. Under his-breath: 
PEYTON The elephant... Quickly! The attendant unwisely pushes two fingers into Peyton's chest. We rocket into a close shot of the offending digits. From of fscreen, we hear the attendant's voice: 
ATTENDANT You heard me, weirdo. Get lost! 
341 CRACK! The counter dissolves into a million fissures, as do the stuffed animals on the shelves above. 
342 PEYTON'S FACE Twitching violently, vein swollen to bursting. The camera races into an eyeball to find: 
343 PEOPLE SCREAMING 
344 HORSES BOBBING 
345 CLOWN LAUGHING, DOING A JIG IN A FUNNY HAT 
346 ROCKET BACK OUT TO: 
PEYTON Screaming. A skin blister bubbles on his cheek. 
347 ATTENDANT'S TWO FINGERS Against Peyton's chest. Peyton grabs them and--CRACK- breaks them. 
348 WIDER The attendant screams. Peyton screams with him. Julie screams as well. 
349 Peyton reaches for the attendant, lifts him into the air, hurls him into another pyramid, which collapses. 
350 FUZZY PINK ELEPHANT is yanked violently from the shelf. 
351 PEYTON shoves it at Julie. In a voice hoarse with rage: 
PEYTON Take it! 
352 Another skin blister opens. 
JULIE Peyton! No! 
PEYTON 'Take it! 
353 His face is starting to send off wisps of smoke. 
JULIE Please! 
PEYTON 
TAKE THE FUCKING ELEPHANT!! 
354 She is looking at him, frozen in horror. 
355 His face is erupting into boils, which simmer and pop, giving off bursts of smoke. 
356 Peyton stares at her. Rage ebbs. His eyes become haunted. Hoarsely: 
PEYTON Forgive me! He runs off, the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped, forgotten, beneath one arm. 
357 Julie runs after him. 
JULIE Peyton! 
358 EXT. STREET 
DARXMAN disappears around a corner, trailing thin wisps Of smoke. 
359 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALLEY 359 
Darkman rushes down the darkened alley, unlocks the warehouse door and rushes inside. CAMERA PANS TO: 
360 JULIE 360 who has seen it all from the shadows. 
361 INT. WAREHOUSE 361 
There's A HORRIBLE RIPPING NOISE. Darkman is destroying something, flailing his arms... 
.CREAK. 
362 DARKMAN'S EYES 362 roll toward the noise. He steps back into the shadows. 
363 INT. WAREHOUSE 363 
Julie slips through a warehouse window. She is confronted by rack upon rack of clothing, shoes, body padding, and wigs. The place looks like the wardrobe room of a major studio. 
JULIE Peyton?! 364 No answer. She cautiously advances. Her eyes fall 364 upon something that makes her gasp. 
365 THE PINK ELEPHANT 365 ripped to shreds, it's white stuffing all over the place. 366 He moves forward towards a darkened corner of 366 the lab.

366 CONTINUED 
JULIE 
(SWALLOWING HER 
FEAR) Peyton?! I need to talk to you. She halts at a site in front of her.

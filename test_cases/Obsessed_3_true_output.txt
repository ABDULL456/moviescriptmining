Derek turns the corner to their street. The house comes into sight. The garage door goes up. Derek pulls into the drive and guides the car into the garage. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLES LIVING ROOM - A MINUTE LATER 
A key in the lock.     The door opens.    Derek and Beth enter. 
On the couch, Samantha ends her texting and greets them with a bright smile. 
SAMANTHA Hey! You guys got back so fast-- 
BETH Any trouble with Kyle? 
SAMANTHA No.  He was a doll. THEN) But you just missed your friend. 
Beth and Derek freeze, turn and look at each other. 
BETH What friend? 
SAMANTHA You know. Allie? She was just here... called you on the cell? 
BETH (TENSING) Nobody called me... 
DEREK Someone was here?     Inside the house? 
SAMANTHA (to Beth) You said it was okay.    She said she had something for Kyle... 
BETH (instant panic) Oh my god! Where's Kyle? 
SAMANTHA In his crib. 
Beth streaks for the stairs.

CONTINUED: 
DEREK How long since she was here? 
SAMANTHA A couple minutes. What's wrong? 
Derek runs for the stairs. 
SAMANTHA (cont'd) (calling after them; now AFRAID) You said it was okay! 
INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM 
Beth runs to the crib. To her horror, it's empty. Lisa lets out a cry of anguish. Derek appears in the door. Lisa turns to him in desperate panic. 
LISA She took him! She took my baby! 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Derek tears back down the stairs, shouting to Samantha. 
EREK Call 911! 
He bursts out the front door. 
EXT. CHARLES HOUSE - GARAGE 
Derek races into the garage, yanks open the driver's door and gets in. He starts the engine, turns to back out and -- Surprise! There's Kyle is in the backseat, strapped into his car seat, smiling at his Daddy. 
DEREK Kyle... 
Derek gets out, pulls open the back door and unstraps his son, then hesitates. What Derek sees makes his blood run cold. On the child's forehead... a perfect red lipstick kiss. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 
Kyle is being examined by A DOCTOR while Derek and Beth comfort him.

CONTINUED: 
DOCTOR We pumped his stomach. X-ray and cat scan came back normal. We'll wait for the blood work but it appears he's completely fine. I don't see any reason why you can't take Bhim home in a couple hours. 
ETH (tearful relief) Thank you, Doctor. 
Monica Reyes appears in the doorway.

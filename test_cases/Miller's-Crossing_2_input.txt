Verna The Royale.  Room three-oh-two. 
She gazes off. 
. . . I guess we both double-crossed Leo, there's no getting around that.  I guess he's well rid of both of us. 
Tom Mm. 
Verna The two of us, we're about bad enough to deserve each other. 
Tom Are we? 
Verna We're a couple of heels, Tom.  Yes we are. 
37.  PULLING TOM 
Into a dark office.  Behind him, Frankie, his nose swathed with bandages, is closing the door from the outside. 
Caspar (off) 'Lo, Kid.  You know O'Gar. . . 
TOM'S POV 
Caspar sits behind his desk.  Bluenoint sits slouched on a couch to one side, wearing his hat, his hands jammed into the pockets of his overcoat. 
In two chairs facing the desk, away from us, sit two men who are twisting around to smile at Tom. 
Caspar . . . and the mayor. 
Tom 'Lo, boys. 
Mayor Tom's a big booster.  Always has been. 
Caspar S'fine, s'fine.  Well, Tom and me's got the proverbial fat to chew-- 
The mayor and O'Gar are already rising to their feet. 
Mayor Well, let us know if you need anything. . . 
Caspar Yeah, happy days.  Have a seat, kid. . . 
Tom sits into one of the vacated chairs facing Caspar. 
. . . So you had enough time to think about it? 
Tom Yeah, well, circumstances have changed. 
Caspar Don't I know it.  Last night, I know Bluepoint was disappointed the bulls showed up before Frankie and Tic-Tac could really pin your ears back, but I said, Relax, Bluepoint, I got a feeling about this kid.  Take the long view.  The kid and Leo are gonna go bust-o.  If the kid ain't ready yet, well, he soon will be.  Matter of time.  I said, the kid's too smart for Leo. That's what I said.  Like a psychic.  Ask Bluepoint if I didn't.  Like a goddamn psychic. G'ahead.  Ask him. 
Tom turns to look at Bluepoint. 
Tom You vouch for this psychic business? 
From the couch, Bluepoint sneers: 
Bluepoint That's right, smart guy. 
Caspar cheerfully continues, oblivious to any hostility in the room: 
Caspar I know you knew protecting the Motzah was a dumb idea.  I know you been wise to all of Leo's dumb ideas lately.  Only a matter of time.  Bust-o. 
He chuckles. 
. . . That's why last night we didn't put the arm on you.  Only Leo. 
Tom Seeing how you squiffed your play on Leo, I can be only so grateful. 
Bluepoint That's brave, coming from Little Miss Punching Bag. 
Caspar C'mon Bluepoint.  Friends now, huh? 
Bluepoint Nuts. 
Caspar smiles at Tom. 
Caspar So we get a little jingle.  And I figure you know Leo's on his way out.  It's only a matter of time before we get him.  Am I right, kid? 
Tom Maybe. 
Caspar laughs. 
Caspar What maybe.  You know or you wouldn't be bust-o. So I guess you're looking for a job? 
Tom I might be. 
Caspar laughs. 
Caspar You got references?  You been to college, kid? We only take yeggs what's been to college.  Ain't that right, Bluepoint? 
Bluepoint says nothing.  His scowl is set in cement. 
. . . I'm jokin', of course.  We all know you can be useful to us, a smart kid such as yaself, the man who walks behind the man and whispers in his ear.  I guess you could be useful, in spades. 
Tom Yeah.  I can do plenty for you.  But the fact is that right now Leo's still got all his vital signs and once he hears about this he'll be more anxious to get to me than to either of you. 
Caspar I'm tellin' ya not to worry about Leo.  We got plans for him. 
Tom Yeah?  What? 
Bluepoint Not so fast there, Kaputnik. 
There is a beat through which Caspar continues to smile at Tom. 
Caspar . . . I think what the Bluepoint is trying to say is, there'll be time to talk about that.  That can be tabled for a later date.  See, the last time we jawed you gave-me the high hat.  So I guess I'm sayin', maybe we want your confidence before we give you ours.  You gotta put somethin' on the table.  Ante up. 
Tom Fair enough.  Where shall we start. 
Caspar Hear that, Bluepoint?  All business!  I told you he was a good kid!  Where shall we start!  All business!. . . 
He rocks back in his chair and dries his eyes.  Tom smiles pleasantly.  Finally Caspar sighs. 
. . . Well, we could start for instance with the Motzah. . . Like where's the Motzah?  You could maybe tell us that. . . 
Tom The Royale.  Room three-oh-two.  You might find Mink with him. 
Bluepoint The hell you say.

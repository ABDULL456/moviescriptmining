INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
They carry the piano into the parlour and to the DASHWOODS' joyful astonishment it fits perfectly. MRS DASHWOOD reads out the letter that has accompanied it. 
MRS DASHWOOD 'At last I have found a small enough instrument to fir the parlour. I expect to follow it in a day or two, by which time I expect you to have learned the enclosed. Your devoted friend, Christopher Brandon.' 
MRS DASHWOOD hands MARIANNE the letter and a broadsheet song. 
MARGARET He must like you very much, Marianne. 
MARIANNE It is not just for me! It is for all of us. 
All the same, she looks conscious of the truth. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY 
MARGARET is up her tree. ELINOR is pulling weeds. MRS DASHWOOD is sitting on a stool working on MARGARET's dress and listening to the strains of the new song which MARIANNE is singing in the cottage. All of a sudden, MRS DASHWOOD rises, shielding her eyes with her hand. She walks down to the gate, looking out. 
MRS DASHWOOD Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne! 
The piano stops. MARIANNE comes out and they all gather at the gate to watch for the rider.

ELINOR I do not think it is the Colonel. 
MRS DASHWOOD It must be. He said he would arrive today. You must play him the new song, Marianne. 
Suddenly there is a yell from MARGARET's tree. 
MARGARET Edward! 
MARGARET practically throws herself out of the tree onto the grass. 
MARGARET It is Edward! 
The women look at each other in complete consternation. 
MRS DASHWOOD Calm. We must be calm. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
Tense silence reigns. Everyone tries to busy themselves. BETSY enters. 
BETSY Mr Ferrars for you, ma'am. 
EDWARD follows her in, looking white and agitated. 
MRS DASHWOOD (rising) Edward! What a pleasure to see you. 
EDWARD Mrs Dashwood. Miss Marianne. Margaret. Miss Dashwood. I hope I find you all well. 
He bows formally to each of them, lingering on ELINOR, who is looking firmly at her lap. He looks anxious. 
MARIANNE Thank you, Edward, we are all very well. 
There is a pause while they all search for an appropriate remark. Finally MARGARET decides to have a go at polite conversation. 
MARGARET We have been enjoying very fine weather. 
MARIANNE looks at her incredulously. 
MARGARET Well, we have. 
EDWARD I am glad of it. The... the roads were very dry. 
MRS DASHWOOD decides to bite the bullet. 
MRS DASHWOOD (giving him her hand) May I wish you great joy, Edward. 
He takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer of a seat. There is an awful silence. MARIANNE tries to help. 
MARIANNE I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars well? 
EDWARD Tolerably, thank you. 
There is another bone-crunching pause. 
EDWARD I--But EDWARD cannot seem to find any words. 
MRS DASHWOOD Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish? 
EDWARD looks extremely confused. 
EDWARD No--my mother is in town. 
He plucks up the courage to look at ELINOR again and is evidently not much comforted by what he sees. 
MRS DASHWOOD I meant to enquire after Mrs Edward Ferrars. 
EDWARD colours. He hesitates.

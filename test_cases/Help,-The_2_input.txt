Hilly and the usual suspects play bridge at Hilly's house. Aibileen pours coffee an earshot away. 
HILLY Please! A nigra walks in a pawn shop with a ring of such size and clarity. It took'em all of five minutes to figure out where she worked. Hilly leads the girls' nods of acknowledgement. 
HILLY (CONT'D) I knew that girl was a thief the day she started. 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
As Minny wipes her nose with her sleeve, Skeeter approaches. 
SKEETER I'll ask daddy to get her a good lawyer. 
MINNY She had a lawyer. A white lawyer! But Miss Hilly friends with the judge's wife. Whole thing took two days. Arrested on Tuesday, in the state pen by Wednesday. 
AIBILEEN The church gone send them boys to college. Gone pass the plate `til they graduate... The women part, making way as Aibileen leads Skeeter to a seat at the kitchen table. PEARLY, 58, sits next to Skeeter and touches her arm. 
PEARLY I'm on help with your stories. Another WOMAN walks over. 
BLACK WOMAN I'm on help too. Another woman speaks from the living room. 
BLACK WOMAN 2 We all are. Women of all ages slowly rise up and nod their heads. Skeeter looks around in awe. 
SKEETER Thank you. I don't know what to- 
MINNY 
(STERNLY) They doing this for Yule May. 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Skeeter sits and writes as Pearly begins the interviews. 
PEARLY Been there thirty-eight years and Miss Margaret still makes me put my hair up in a rag. Say she know coloreds don't wash theys hair. But, I love her. She love me too. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CORA, 70. 
CORA I had been workin' for Miss Jolene's mother up `til she died. Then her daughter, Miss Nancy, asked me to come work for her. Miss Nancy a real sweet lady. 
CORA (CONT'D) But her momma left it in the will that I had to work for her daughter, Miss Jolene. Miss Jolene a mean woman. Mean for sport. I tried to get another job, but in everbody mind, the French family and Miss Jolene owned me. 
DISSOLVE TO: CALLIE, 60, takes off her glasses and wipes her eyes. 
CALLIE I used to take a shortcut ever day to work at Doctor Dixon's house. Cut through this farmer's lower forty to get there. One day, that farmer was waitin' on me with a gun, said he'd shoot me dead if I walk on his land again. Doctor Dixon went and paid that farmer double for two a those acres. Told him he `bout to start farmin' too. But he bought it just for me. So I could get to work easy. He did. Skeeter closes her eyes for moment. When she opens them she sees A VISION OF CONSTANTINE STANDING 
BEFORE HER. Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand. She presses her thumb firmly in her palm. When Skeeter blinks again, the vision is gone. Standing in place of Constantine is GRETCHEN, 26. 
GRETCHEN All these colored women have been real nice, haven't they? 
SKEETER Yes. Very nice. 
GRETCHEN Well, they hate you. You know this? Every little thing about you. But you're so dumb, you think you're doing them a favor. Skeeter and the other maids are taken aback. 
SKEETER You don't have to do this. 
GRETCHEN You know the nicest thing a white woman's ever done for me? Gave me the heel of her bread. These women are playing a trick on you. They'll never tell you the truth! 
SKEETER You don't know what they've said. 
GRETCHEN Say it, lady, say the word you think every time one us stands in front of you. Nigger. Aibileen crosses over to Gretchen. 
AIBILEEN That's enough, Gretchen. 
GRETCHEN You just as dumb as she is. 
AIBILEEN Get out a my house! 
INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Aibileen sits with Skeeter on the sofa reading and answering Miss Myrna letters. Aibileen is dressed very nicely. Several flower arrangements are placed around the room. An unwrapped present rests on the coffee table. 
AIBILEEN Tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans. Then them dogs will stay away. As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a wall clock and smiles. About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the mail slot. Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter. 
SKEETER Well, happy birthday, Aibileen. You should have told me. 
AIBILEEN And, from all over the county, my babies find they way home. Aibileen stops on one card in particular. She sits back down next to Skeeter. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) Some even from overseas. Alton Spears lives in Paris now. Married him a real pretty French girl. Got five kids, too...they's my grandbabies. 
Aibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside along with a picture of the Spears family. Aibileen reads the card aloud. 
AIBILEEN (CONT'D) I still don't drink coffee. Happy Birthday. Love Alton. Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is touched. The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers. Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in matching dresses jump out behind her. The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen waves back and smiles. Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for Skeeter. She wipes her eye.

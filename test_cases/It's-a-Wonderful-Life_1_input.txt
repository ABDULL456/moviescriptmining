GEORGE Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me? 
GOWER No. No. 
NICK (to his bouncers) Throw him out. Throw him out. 
The bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes back to the bar. 
GEORGE (bewildered) Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick... Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist? 
NICK You know, that's another reason for me not to like you. That rumhead spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid. If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself. (to his bouncers) Would you show these gentlemen to the door. 
BOUNCER Sure. This way, gentlemen. 
EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in the snow. 
INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
Nick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell. 
NICK Hey! Get me! I'm giving out wings! 
EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange, puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they landed, looking at each other. 
CLARENCE You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the... 
GEORGE What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly... 
George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with the neon sign over the door. It now reads "NICK'S PLACE" instead of "MARTINI'S." 
George and Clarence get to their feet. 
GEORGE (exasperated) What the... hey, what's going on around here?  Why, this ought to be Martini's place. 
He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested look. 
GEORGE Look, who are you? 
CLARENCE (patiently) I told you, George. I'm your guardian angel. 
George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his arm.  It's flesh. 
GEORGE Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What... are you a hypnotist? 
CLARENCE No, of course not. 
GEORGE Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things? 
CLARENCE Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born. 
GEORGE Then if I wasn't born, who am I? 
CLARENCE You're nobody. You have no identity. 
George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but without success. 
GEORGE What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey. 
CLARENCE There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy... (he says these things as George searches for them) George looks in his watch pocket. 
CLARENCE They're not there, either. 
GEORGE What? 
CLARENCE Zuzu's petals. 
George feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out. 
CLARENCE You've been given a great gift, George. A chance to see what the world would be like without you. 
George is completely befuddled. 
GEORGE (shaking his head) Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute here. As, this is some sort of a funny dream I'm having here. So long, mister, I'm going home. 
He starts off. Clarence rises. 
CLARENCE Home? What home? 
GEORGE (furious) Now shut up! Cut it out! You're... you're... you're crazy! That's what I think... you're screwy, and you're driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing things. I'm going home and see my wife and family. Do you understand that? And I'm going home alone! 
George strides off hurriedly. Clarence slowly follows him, glancing up toward Heaven as he goes. 
CLARENCE How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks. (pause) No, I didn't have a drink! 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. STREET  NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE MOVES INTO THE SCENE 
The sign bearing the name of the town reads: "Pottersville." George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and so on. 
CLOSE SHOT 
George stops before what used to be the offices of the Building and Loan.  There is a garish electric sign over the entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops: 
GEORGE Hey... hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to? 
COP The Building and what? 
GEORGE The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there. 
COP They went out of business years ago. 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP 
George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon. 
GEORGE Hey, Violet! (to the cop) Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick! 
COP I know. I know. 
GEORGE I know that girl! 
The cop shoves George to one side. He looks around and sees Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by. 
GEORGE Hey, Ernie  Ernie!

INT. WALTER'S CAR - DAY 
Walter drives back down the highway. The Fela Kuti music is playing. He is tapping on the steering wheel. 
INT. WALTER'S BUILDING, STAIRWELL - LATER 
Walter walks quickly up the stairs to the fourth floor. He seems to be moving with a little more pep. 
As he approaches his door, he hears music emanating from his apartment. It's a PIANO SONATA. The music stops him in his tracks. He listens for a couple of moments. Finally he walks inside. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Walter enters to find Mouna mopping the floor.   Fresh flowers are on the table. She sees Walter and smiles. 
MOUNA Walter. 
She turns down the music. 
MOUNA (CONT'D) I did not expect you so soon. I was just cleaning a bit. I hope you don't mind. 
WALTER No. Thank you. 
MOUNA I like this CD very much.   The music is lovely. 
She picks up the CD. 
MOUNA (CONT'D) Is it your wife? 
WALTER Yes. 
MOUNA She was beautiful. 
WALTER Thank you. 
Mouna sets down the CD. She notices Walter's glasses. 
MOUNA These are different glasses? 
WALTER Yes. 
MOUNA Are they new? 
WALTER Yes. 
MOUNA They're nice. 
WALTER Thank you. 
MOUNA I was going to make some lunch. Are you hungry? 
WALTER Yes. Thank you. 
Walter leaves. Then he returns. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Mouna? 
MOUNA Yes. 
WALTER I was wondering if...Thursday night ... Do you have plans? 
Mouna laughs. 
MOUNA No, Walter, I have no plans. 
WALTER Well, I thought that...we might do something. 
MOUNA OK. 
WALTER OK. 
Walter nods and walks toward his room. Mouna watches him go and smiles. 
INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITATION ROOM - LATER 
Walter and Tarek are talking. Tarek is very anxious. 
TAREK They keep moving people. 
WALTER To where? 
TAREK I don't know. I think to other detention centers. Two Moroccan guys were just moved. They had no idea. Suddenly they were just gone.

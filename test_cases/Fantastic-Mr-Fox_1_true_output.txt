INSERT: The television set. Bean is on-screen with the Action 13 reporter. He wears a fox-fur necktie. 
EXT. CAMP. NIGHT 
There is a full moon. Lanterns glow in the farmers' tents. A group of farmhands sit around a campfire next to the crater. One of them cooks a chicken on a spit. Another sits on a log playing a banjo. He is Petey. He sings: 
PETEY 'Bout a handsome little fox Let me sing you folks a yarn. Hey, diddle-dee, doddle-do, doodle-dum! 'Twas a splendid little feller Full of wit 'n' grace 'n' charm. Say, zippy-zee, yappy-yo, google-gum! The shot moves past the leathery faces of the other farmhands as they listen: amused, moved, hungry, tired, charmed, annoyed, whistling, playing a jew's harp, trying to sing along but not really knowing the words, etc. 
PETEY Like any little critter needin' Vittels for his littl'uns, Well, he stole, and he cheated, And he lied to survive. Doodle-dum, diddle-die, doddle-diddle- doodle-dee! Zippy-zo, zippy-zay, zippy-zappy- zoopy-zee! (this verse is spoken:) Let me take a little tick now To color in the scene: 'Cross the valley lived three yokels Name of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. 
(MORE) 
PETEY (CONT'D) (back to singing:) Now these three crazy jackies had our hero on the run. Shot the tail off the cuss With a fox-shootin' gun. But that stylish little fox Was as clever as a whip. Dug as quick as a gopher Who was a hyper-ack-a-tive. Now those three farmers sit 'Twhere there's a hole 'twas once a hill. Hey, diddle-dee, doddle-do, doodle-dum! And as far as I can reckon They're a-settin' up there still. 
(SLOWLY) Way, zippy-zee, yappy-yo, google -- 
BEAN 
(INTERRUPTING) What are you singing, Petey? Petey stops short. Everyone turns quickly and sees Bean standing over them in the darkness with his Luger in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Petey looks nervous. 
PETEY I don't know. I was just kind of making it up as I was going along... Petey trails off. Bean shakes his head. He looks highly irritated. 
BEAN That's just weak song-writing! You wrote a bad song, Petey! Bean throws his cigarette into the campfire. He storms away. Petey turns to the other farmhands. Everyone looks uncomfortable. 
TITLE: 3 DAYS LATER (18 Fox-Days) 
CUT TO: Morning in the farmers' camp. The cook flips an egg on a skillet. He puts it on a plate with bacon and hands it to Petey. Petey asks him: 
PETEY How long can a fox go without food or water? 
CUT TO: The exhausted foxes and Kylie underground. Kylie says 
QUIETLY: 
KYLIE Well, I can only answer as an opossum, but I don't think I can last more than another couple of hours before I get completely dehydrated and starve to death. 
ASH What's that? Ash points. Everyone looks. A tiny hole appears in the wall at the end of the tunnel. Dirt crumbles out of it -- and a bit of metal catches a glint. Fox and his family watch, frozen. A breath of air blows into the tunnel. The flame on Mrs. Fox's lantern flickers once and goes out. 
ASH STARTS: 
ASH Dad? 
FOX 
(WHISPERS SHARPLY) Not a sound! Silence. There is a sudden, loud scrabbling noise. A match strikes. Fox touches it to Mrs. Fox's lantern-wick. The tiny hole in the wall has become a large one. Badger stands in front of Fox with his law partner Beaver, Beaver's overgrown, hulking son, a medium-sized mole, and a grey field mouse with a bandana tied in a "do-rag" style around his head. Badger has a spoon in his hand. Fox and Badger erupt at each other, screaming simultaneously: 
FOX You scared the cuss out of us! 
BADGER I told you not to buy at nine and a cussing half!

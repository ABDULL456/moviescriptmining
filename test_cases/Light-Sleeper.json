{"train": "LIGHT SLEEPER \nWritten by \nPaul Schrader \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nJOHN LETOUR, forty, light sleeper. Never meant to be a drug dealer, it just came along. He's been other things: messenger boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub shill -- never meant to be them either. Now he's a D.D. Drug dealer. \nJOHN LETOUR, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, \"Beatle\" boots, a shadow drifting in and out of other shadows, New York, day, night: watching, listening, rarely speaking -- nonexistent, seen only by those he sees. His face an affable blank. Make of it what you will. The eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. A map of calculation. \nOnce he had a drug problem. Life turned a page. Today he follows instructions: he sleeps light -- one eye open, anticipating. JOHN LETOUR, D.D., loner, voyeur, has been drifting toward an unknown destination. At mid-life the destination draws near. The circle tightens. The dealer is anxious. The destination is love. \nNIGHT IN THE LIFE \nCREDIT SEQUENCE: New York by night. JOHN LETOUR nestles in back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the window. Neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose. \nHis beeper goes off. He clicks it, checks the digital message. The DRIVER stops at an uptown corner. LETOUR opens the curbside door, motions to the DRIVER he'll be back in \"ten\" minutes. He enters the video laundromat, a twenty-four-hour video rental/laundromat/tanning salon. \nInside, he meets a RETRO-YUPPIE (J. Crew Division) in the \"Classics\" section. They exit. \nOn the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet. LETOUR pockets the uncounted cash. The YUPPIE mouths goodbye, eager to put distance between him and LETOUR. JOHN checks his beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials. \nJOHN LETOUR re-enters the sedan; the DRIVER heads downtown. High-rises give way to Tudor City. Uncollected trash lines the curbs. LETOUR eyes a PEDESTRIAN; PEDESTRIAN looks back. Later. Three a.m. The streets are dark. LeTour's car passes a glowing Korean market. \nLETOUR narrates from diary: \nLETOUR (voice over) Labor Day weekend. Some time for a sanitation strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at the last minute and want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity -- it keeps you sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night -- now and then. Just to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start another. \nThe sedan drives on. End credits. \nCUT TO: \nHOMEBASE \nFour a.m.: streets empty. LeTour's sedan drops him off near a ten-story West 80s apartment building. JOHN gives the DRIVER a forty-dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner. He presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. He enters the lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture toward the elevators. Presses the button. \nPenthouse C door opens. ANN lets JOHN in with a smile. \nANN, forty-four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him with a wet kiss. Her hair is coiffured, her face made up. She is John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen: she keeps the books. Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: she's been in the drug business fifteen years. \nAnn's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine photos of Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, the Duke of Windsor -- paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. A bird flits in its cage. One corner of the living area is devoted to a fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer, billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, reference books, color charts. \nROBERT, fifty, slight, waves hello as JOHN locks the door. Gay, hip, worn, he's John's \"co-runner.\" \nThey work -- and eat -- out of Ann's apartment. Take-out tins of Indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, glasses, and vitamin bottles. No sign of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or money. \nANN Darling. \nLETOUR Ann. \nANN Have we made New York safe for another weekend? \nLETOUR (waves) Robert. \nCUT TO: \nJEALOUS \nFive p.m. A Clinton transient hotel. \nInside hotel room, LETOUR meets with JEALOUS, a twenty-five- year-old drug intermediary in leather jacket. JOHN counts hundred-dollar bills, hands them to JEALOUS. \nJEALOUS Are they \"faced\"? \nLETOUR Don't bore me. \nJEALOUS rearranges the hundreds: \nJEALOUS Is it so much work to face them the same direction? You don't do it, I got to. It's time -- my time -- \nLETOUR (overlap) Jees -- \nJEALOUS We've been through all this. (LETOUR shrugs) This nineteen-gram shit is a drag. \nLETOUR We pay you more, you put up with more. White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety. \nJEALOUS I can't believe Ann's been working as long as she has -- never busted. She's something. \nLETOUR Never made any big money either. \nJEALOUS Sure. \nLETOUR She blows it. \nJEALOUS You believe that? What you gonna do after she quits? How long you been with her? \nLETOUR She always says that. We'll see, Jealous. \nJEALOUS She's out. You should pick up her trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you. \nLETOUR No way. I'm not the management type. I get in charge, I'll start using again -- not for me. I know music people. I'm gonna get in recording. \nJEALOUS Yeah. \nLETOUR reaches for the door. \nJEALOUS Tour. \nLETOUR What? \nJEALOUS Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled. \nLETOUR Why? \nJEALOUS You read the papers? The Park murder. All over the Post. Mariah Rangel -- nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. They're buzzin'. You know her? \nLETOUR (shrugs) I look like an encyclopedia? Who knows? (opens door) Thanks for the warning. \nCUT TO: \nLETOUR Of what? \nANN The face cream. Almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe -- the \"Almilk\" formula. I remixed it. \nLETOUR (smells her) Very nice. \nANN Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at Enhancements and pick up some almond oil -- not the California. (fishes menus from desk) What should we order? \nLETOUR How about Indian? \nANN Darling, it's Saturday. \nROBERT Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while. \nThe phone rings. Ann's voice repeats a recorded message: \nANN'S VOICE \"Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a message, we'll get back to you -- sooner than you think.\" \nAnswering machine beeps. MAN'S VOICE speaks from the tiny speaker: \"Ann, this is Ed. Call me. 749-2876.\" \nANN (to ROBERT) Answer that. He'll call back every five minutes. \nROBERT (walking) The night begins. \nThe phone rings again: another message as ANN examines the menu. \nANN \"Ped Srilom\"? -- it's Northeastern. Duck. \nLETOUR (glancing) I'm going veggie. Get me the \"Puk Ob.\" \nROBERT (out of shot from phone) Me too. \nLETOUR Use it for facial cream. \nROBERT (out of shot) Remove unsightly hair! \nANN Laugh, one day you'll be watching me on \"Oprah\" from a welfare hotel. \nLETOUR Forgive us. \nROBERT (returns) Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top Lady. God knows what happened to his shit yesterday. \nANN (to LETOUR) You take it -- call in. \nLETOUR It was supposed to be light tonight. \nROBERT Don't you watch TV? \nLETOUR Don't have one. \nROBERT Well if you were the normal stupid fuck you should be so lucky to be and had one, you'd know it's supposed to rain -- \nANN Good for the trees -- \nROBERT Some farmer whacked his numerology on us. \nEDDIE (contrite) Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right. I didn't mean that. I'm quitting anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry. \nLETOUR (turns back) Okay. \nEDDIE Two hundred? \nLETOUR nods. \nEDDIE counts $200 as LETOUR takes a gram from his pouch, gives it to him. \nLETOUR You got downs? (EDDIE nods) One more thing. I gotta use the phone. \nEDDIE pockets the envelope as JOHN, checking his beeper, walks to the phone. \nLater. LETOUR sits in an Upper West Side apartment as an earnest MID-TWENTIESH MAN, wearing undershorts, snorts a hefty line, offers a rolled dollar bill as he talks. LETOUR declines. \nMID-TWENTIESH MAN (continuing) ...but -- if there's no God, how can man conceive of him? The idea of God presupposes the existence of God. That's the Ontological Argument. Anselm. Twelve hundred. Fourteen hundred -- I'm not sure -- \nLETOUR (checks his watch) I've got to go. \nMID-TWENTIESH MAN (gesturing) Let me finish. Okay, if the idea of God is implanted by God -- the sensus divinitatus, the sense of the divine -- what is the role of human thought? Not faith, thought... \nLETOUR's mind drifts. His diary voice overlaps: \nLETOUR (Voice over) Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. He understands. Of course they're stoned to start. If I could tie together all the hours of coke talk I've heard, that would be a lot of string. It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. Fifty is more like it. \nLater. Narration continues as sedan drives through rain. Later. A Tribeca loft. LETOUR swaps drug jargon with TWO N.Y.U. STUDENTS at an impromptu party. Attractive ingenues drift by. TRENDY TWOSOME, blasted, sways, to techno-rap. \nBusiness done, LETOUR turns to leave. The FIRST STUDENT grabs his shoulder: \nFIRST STUDENT C'mon, Tour, stick around. \nSECOND STUDENT Yeah. \nFIRST STUDENT There's only four of us and like seven of them -- and we're paying for the dope. See her, over there, the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? -- she's gonna model for Elite. \nDOWNTOWN NYMPH, sixteen going on seventeen. \nLETOUR (smiling) Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me like an old horse. \nSECOND STUDENT Shit, dude -- \nLETOUR Nah. Thanks anyway. (checks watch) I gotta go. Have fun. (heads toward exit) \nCUT TO: \nFACE FROM THE PAST \nLeTour's sedan heads down Lexington Avenue. It rains unabated. Puddles glisten; red taillights refract on the windshield. JOHN rests in back, a bag from Enhancements beside him. \nPedestrians, well-dressed and casual, desperately wave for taxis amid sacks of garbage. No use: nothing for blocks. \nJohn's sedan stops for a midtown light. LETOUR looks out the window, sees a WOMAN vainly hailing a cab. He looks again. She turns her head. He recognizes her. \nLETOUR (to DRIVER) Carlos. Wait a second. \nLETOUR I still deal a little, but I'm straight -- that part's true. Believe me. \nMARIANNE (to DRIVER) Stop here. Now. Stop! \nLETOUR I won't say anything. I promise. I'll just sit here. I'll just give you a ride. \nThe car pulls over. MARIANNE opens the door, gets out. \nMARIANNE Goodbye, John. \nLETOUR Where do you live? (door slams) Mari... \nShe fades into the rain. JOHN watches, aching. \nDRIVER Sir? \nLETOUR Eighty-third Street. \nThe sedan continues uptown. \nCUT TO: \nMEMORIES \nJohn's apartment. Pre-dawn. His diary lies open on the desk. LETOUR sits clothed on the futon, drinking white wine. He pages through a cheap, half-filled photo album. He touches snapshots, 3\u00d75's from another time: \n-- JOHN and MARIANNE, arm in arm, on a Florida beach \n-- MARIANNE, surprised by the camera, snorting coke at a party \n-- JOHN, MARIANNE, and ANN posing, smiling, same party \n-- JOHN and MARIANNE kissing over birthday cake, same party \n-- MARIANNE IN MOROCCO BAZAAR \n-- JOHN blowing a kiss in Fez airport \nCUT TO: \nPSYCHIC HEALING \nLeTour's narration continues over embossed card on an entry table: Teresa Aronow, Psychic Reading, 37 Jones Street, New York, N.Y. 10012, (212)473-4297. VOICES under narration: \nTERESA (out of shot) Coffee? \nLETOUR (out of shot) Thanks. \nTERESA (out of shot) Black? \nLETOUR (out of shot) Yeah. \nTERESA (out of shot) Here. \nJOHN accepts a coffee mug, sits on a sofa across from TERESA. Sunlight falls through crocheted curtains. \nTIS You won't believe it. What a nightmare. I brought in this chick. She O.D.ed -- man, I didn't even know her. I didn't have to bring her in. The cops are coming back to talk to me. I'm hyper. I gotta come down. \nLETOUR (hands him valium) Here. \nTIS Make it two. \nLETOUR obliges. TIS pops a blue without water, pockets the other. \nTIS Thanks. \nLETOUR She okay? \nTIS Who? \nLETOUR The girl. \nTIS Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A walking vacuum cleaner. What a nightmare. Underage. \nLETOUR You need a lawyer? \nTIS (gestures toward suited man) He's here. Thanks. \nTIS folds a bill into John's hand. \nLETOUR Any time. \nTIS turns, steps away. LETOUR walks down the long corridor. Curious, reflective, he slows past open doors. Friends, family, patients sit in blue light. Each room a drama. \nHe heads down a duplicate corridor. A VOICE turns his head: \nRANDI John! \nHe turns to see RANDI JOST, thirty, Marianne's younger sister. She wears running shoes, jeans, red sweater. \nLETOUR Randi? \nRANDI (kisses him) I can't believe it. Marianne's here too. She flew in. It's been so long. You look great. \nLETOUR (deactivates beeper) You too. Randi, what's wrong? Why are you here? \nRANDI Mom. She's back in. Didn't Marianne tell you? \nLETOUR Serious? \nRANDI (nods) More chemo. \nLETOUR Can I see her? \nRANDI She's sleeping. She sleeps most of the time. She'd like it, though. She still talks about you. \nLETOUR (sad) I'm so sorry. She's a terrific woman. I was crazy about her. God. \nMARIANNE, head down, approaches. Looking up, she finds herself unexpectedly beside JOHN and RANDI: \nRANDI It's John. What a coincidence. \nMARIANNE (\"no\") Not this time. His new wife -- he'll make it to the funeral. \nLETOUR What have you been doing? Where do you live? \nMARIANNE It's... (deciding) I don't want you to know about my life. \nLETOUR Anything? You married? Have children? A dog? (smile) House plants? \nMARIANNE Details just open the door. \nLETOUR The door to what? (no answer) It's not like we're strangers. We were married. \nMARIANNE We were not. \nLETOUR There was a ceremony. \nMARIANNE He wasn't even a minister. He was an astrologer. \nLETOUR He was also a minister. \"Universal Harmony.\" \nMARIANNE He was a Pisces. \nLETOUR You're a Pisces. \nMARIANNE It was not legal. \nLETOUR In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're still -- \nMARIANNE I was on the cusp. \nLETOUR We were happy. \nMARIANNE We were miserable. We were either scoring or coming down -- mostly coming down. \nLETOUR There were good times. Area, out on the street, laughing, dancing with friends -- we were magical. \nMARIANNE You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- I heard them all. Nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God. \nLETOUR You exaggerate. \nMARIANNE In rehab they call this \"euphoric recall.\" You only remember the highs, never the lows. \nLETOUR We were happy. \nMARIANNE I was drowning. \nLETOUR It wasn't me -- \nMARIANNE You watched -- \nLETOUR You jumped -- \nMARIANNE You did nothing -- \"It wasn't your business, you weren't responsible\" -- you still think like that. (shakes head) Actions have consequences; so do -- \nLETOUR (overlap) I -- \nCUT TO: \nNEW DIARY \nLater. LeTour's sedan pulls up near Palio, a midtown restaurant. \nJOHN steps around garbage bags, enters. \nInside, JOHN \"maps\" bar, greets the MA\u00ceTRE D'. LETOUR spots the FRENCH (LaCroix and Montana) COUPLE in the dining section, catches the man's eye. He nods to the MA\u00ceTRE D', makes his way toward their table. \nHe joins the FRENCH COUPLE, declines a drink, exchanges drugs/money amid air kisses. \nLate night. Fog hangs over 22nd Street: Chelsea's deserted. Homeless men behind windbreaks of trash. \nJohn's apartment. He writes bareback at the desk. He completes his composition book diary mid-sentence, closes it, discards it. He lifts a new book from the floor, opens it on the desk, continues. \nHe fills his glass with wine: \nLETOUR (voice over) I can always find another way to make a living. I never planned this in the first place -- not like Ann. She came up to sell, have parties, make contacts. She was so glamorous. I just wanted to be around her. She'd sit up listening to coke stories. Now it's me and Robert. The whole crowd was the same age. Everybody's younger now. She made me. \nLETOUR pulls his weekly pay from his pants, puts five twenties in an envelope. He addresses the envelope. \"Linda Wichel, 1012B-2 A Street, Sacramento, California,\" stamps it. \nDissolves: (1) LETOUR vanishes from his desk, (2) materializes fetally on his futon, bareback, slacks, boots, anxious, awaiting sleep. \nLeTour's diary contains parallel columns of names: one headed \"People Who Are Left Handed,\" the other, \"People Whose Eyes Don't Match.\" \nCUT TO: \nC\u00d4TE BASQUE \nMidday. JOHN, wearing a black tweed jacket, tie, khaki slacks, mails the Sacramento letter, enters C\u00d4TE BASQUE, a hoity- toity 55th Street restaurant. \nMidmeal. ANN and LETOUR sit in a prominent booth; power moguls confer quietly. A deferential WAITER brings fresh berries, retrieves empty salmon plates. \nANN You have any money saved? \nLETOUR There's some. Not much. A thousand or two. Maybe more -- I'm not sure. \nANN What do you do with your money? \nThe CHEF stops by, asks if the meal was satisfactory. ANN assures him it was, kisses his hand. The CHEF nods, gratified. JOHN resumes the conversation: \nLETOUR I don't know. It's not that much in the first place -- as you know. \nANN (counterpoint) It's tax free -- \nLETOUR Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs -- what about your money? \nANN Kitty Ford once told me, \"Ann, the only person I know that lives as well as you is my grandmother.\" All the money I've made, all the money I've spent -- it never adds up. This last two years cosmetics' been taking everything. \nLETOUR I wish I could help. \nANN You still go to meetings? \nLETOUR No, but I'm okay. What are the odds of meeting someone you haven't seen in years twice in two days? \nLETOUR I love you. \nLETOUR is alone. He pulls his pants on. Looking for his socks, he peruses Marianne's personal things. He examines her cosmetics, her underclothes. He dabs her perfume on his cheek. \nButtoning his shirt, he retrieves his beeper from suit jacket. Activated, it disgorges messages. He checks his watch: 9:00 p.m. \nCUT TO: \nGET ON OUT \nNine-thirty: Ann's apartment building. Trash stacked high. \nLETOUR presses the buzzer. \nLETOUR, exhausted, unfocused, enters Ann's apartment. ANN is immediately upon him: \nANN Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee? \nLETOUR There was a mix-up -- \nANN How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.'s got some conference in two days. The holiday's over -- ragheads everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel -- little creeps with lapel pins. Even I've been out. This is where our money is: Europe, Asia, not the streets -- you wouldn't know crack from crackerjacks. \nLETOUR Where's Robert? \nANN Busting his ass. He's out doing your job. \nLETOUR It was a confusion. \nANN Get confused on your day off. \nLETOUR When is that? \nANN Don't get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There's a list on the TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss it. \nLETOUR (pecks her cheek) I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me. \nCUT TO: \nAU BAR \nLeTour's sedan waits between limos. \nInside, JOHN passes the MA\u00ceTRE D', looks around: he's known here. Au Bar, a restaurant/club open 9:00 p. m. to 4:00 a. m., caters to the young, the rich, the European. \nHe spots TIS with THOMAS, twenty-five, his handsome trainer, and TWO MODELS at a second-floor table. They exchange nods. \nLETOUR scans the room: suspicion is second nature. \nA laughing man (GUIDONE) at the bar catches his eye. He seems to blend: Italian, twenty-eight, silk suit, impeccable hair, accent -- but something's not right. His black shoes have rubber soles. LETOUR looks for a gun bulge, dirty hands. The ITALIAN turns; LETOUR glimpses his face: too pale. The ITALIAN averts his eyes. Glancing back, LETOUR walks up the stairs to Tis' table. \nTIS Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas. They're here for a show. \nThe MODELS respond in respective accents. THOMAS extends his hand. JOHN shakes, remains standing. \nLETOUR Enchant\u00e9. (to TIS) How'd it turn out? \nCUT TO: \nPHONE CALLS \nMidday. Twenty-second Street. A helter-skelter of daytime activity unseen before. \nJohn's apartment. Sunlight fills the studio apartment. LETOUR, unshaven in T-shirt and slacks, sets the phone on the desk beside his open composition book. He pauses, dials. \nHOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) Paramount Hotel. \nLETOUR Marianne Jost. \nHOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) Just a moment. \nJOHN waits, closes his diary. \nHOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) I'm sorry. Ms. Jost checked out this morning. \nLETOUR She was there yesterday. \nHOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) She checked out this morning. \nLETOUR Did she leave a forwarding number? \nHOTEL SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) No. \nLETOUR Thank you. \nHe hangs up, thinks, redials. \nST. LUKE'S SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) St. Luke's -- Roosevelt Hospital. \nLETOUR Mrs. Jost. JoAnn Jost. She's a patient. \nST. LUKE'S SWITCHBOARD (out of shot) Just a moment. \nA long silence. JOHN looks out the window. A MEDICAL STAFF VOICE from the hospital: \nMEDICAL VOICE (out of shot) Who is this calling? \nLETOUR (thinking) Skyline Floral. We're trying to confirm a delivery. \nMEDICAL VOICE (out of shot) Mrs. Jost passed away last night. \nLETOUR Are the funeral arrangements local? \nMEDICAL VOICE (out of shot) Just a sec -- yes, Plaza Memorial. \nLETOUR Thank you. \nMEDICAL VOICE (out of shot) You're welcome. \nJOHN hangs up, paces, sits. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \nINTERVENTION \nEddie's high-rise apartment. EDDIE is worse, if anything. He's been scoring on the street: broken pipes and vials crunch underfoot. \nEDDIE and LETOUR argue (\"Fuck you!\" \"Fuck you!\"). EDDIE spits, pushes TOUR, JOHN pushes back. Eddie's feet tangle. He trips, FALLS. A bottle SMASHES. \nJOHN goes to the phone, checks Eddie's directory, dials. \nEDDIE (on floor) You gotta get permission? Check with Mama? \nLETOUR I'm calling your brother. \nEDDIE Huh? \nLETOUR Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I'm gonna ask him to come over. (EDDIE protests) You've told me so much about him. \nEDDIE (panicked) No, don't. Please, I'll give you money, anything. He doesn't understand. Whose side are you on? \nLETOUR (on phone) Is this Martin Jeer? (beat) Thank you. \nEDDIE, woozy, tries to stand. \nEDDIE I shoulda never called. \nLETOUR (to EDDIE) I recommend Hazelden. It has the best all-around program. (on phone) Martin Jeer? (beat) I'm here with your brother Ed. (beat) Yeah, in the city. I'm afraid there's a medical emergency. You're going to have to come. \nEDDIE lurches toward LETOUR. JOHN -- flash of anger -- bootkicks him in the head! Eddie's cheek hits the carpet. \nLETOUR (on phone) He'll be here. \nJOHN, cooling down, measures his breaths. A spring can only be wound so tight. \nCUT TO: \nLEXINGTON AVENUE \nLETOUR walks from his sedan around the corner to the Lexington Avenue entrance to Grace Towers, a pre-war apartment building. In the lobby, he gives his name to the SECURITY GUARD, is directed to the express elevator. \nHe exits on the thirtieth floor; footsteps muted by thick carpet. \nVictorian prints on dark blue walls. He looks about, approaches a door, presses the buzzer. \nTHOMAS opens the door; JOHN enters Tis' opulent apartment. \nSalle and Clemente hang on the walls; New York twinkles outside panoramic windows. A pipe and syringe lie atop art books. TIS, in jogging sweats, comes from the bedroom to greet him. \nTIS Tour, just in time. We were out. Nineteen, right? \nLETOUR Thirty-eight hundred -- got any hundreds? \nTIS Some, not the whole thing. (to THOMAS) You got hundreds? \nTHOMAS No. \nLETOUR Yes. \nPause. More police cars. The EMS siren starts up; the ambulance speeds downtown past LeTour's sedan. No reaction. CARLOS turns off the engine. \nLETOUR Downtown. \nCARLOS Yes. \nCARLOS starts the car, pulls into traffic. \nCUT TO: \nTWENTY-TWO MINUTES \nJohn's apartment. Late night. LETOUR, barefoot, T-shirt, slacks, stands flat against the wall. \nWINS broadcasts twenty-four hour news on the boombox. (\"Give us twenty-two minutes and we'll give you the world.\") Sports, ads, bullshit -- LETOUR hears what he's been waiting for: \nNEWSCASTER (out of shot -- radio) This story is just in. A woman has fallen thirty stories to her death from a posh Grace Towers apartment on Lexington Avenue. Police are withholding identification pending the notification of the next of kin. The incident happened about ten p.m. According to the sources on the scene there was no one else in the posh Grace Towers apartment when the fall occurred. We will bring you more details as we get them. (teletype efx) An end to the sanitation strike seems imminent. Negotiations at the Helmsley Palace are continuing to this hour... \nActions have consequences. \nCUT TO: \nMOTHER TERESA \nFirst light. Jones Street. LETOUR, sleepless, pounds on Teresa's door. No answer. Knocks again. Again. \nNoises from inside. A sleepy voice: \nTERESA (out of shot) Who is it? \nLETOUR John. John LeTour. Can I see you? \nTERESA (out of shot) What time is it? \nLETOUR It's important, Teresa. \nTERESA (out of shot) Call. Make an appointment. \nLETOUR Open the door. You're awake anyway. (no answer) Teresa. \nTERESA, wearing oriental bathrobe, unlatches the door. JOHN enters, turns to her. The door closes. \nLETOUR Read me. What do you see? \nTERESA Do I know you? \nLETOUR We had a session last week. What do you see? \nTERESA (remembering name) John? \nLETOUR Yes. Look at me. \nTERESA takes a moment to concentrate. \nGUIDONE (out of shot) The jumper. Druggie. \nLETOUR The news said she was alone in the apartment when she went out -- she wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was someone else. \nGUIDONE (out of shot) Who? \nLETOUR Who lives in the apartment? \nGUIDONE (out of shot) You there? \nLETOUR That's all I know. You asked me to tell you something. I told you something. \nHangs up. \nCUT TO: \nA LITTLE SLEEP \nNoon. LETOUR enters a West Village apartment building. \nHe presses an intercom button. Robert's voice answers: \nROBERT (out of shot) Who is it? \nLETOUR Jack. Let me in. \nThe door buzzes. \nROBERT opens the door to his overdecorated apartment. JOHN looks around. TONY, Robert's younger, unattractive lover, sips coffee at the table. \nROBERT Where have you been? We were worried. \nLETOUR I need some sleep -- not much. I don't want to go home just yet. A little sleep first. Can I crash here? Nice place. \nROBERT It's hideous. I did it years ago. I've got to throw everything out. You haven't been here? (noticing TONY) Oh, Jack, this is Tony. I told you about him. You should talk. He's the lapidopterist -- gems. \nTONY (corrects him) Lapidarian. \nROBERT Same thing. \nLETOUR Can I? \nROBERT Sure. \nLETOUR What do you know about Tis? What's his relationship to Ann? \nROBERT They go way back -- before me. Did you cross him? \nLETOUR No. \nROBERT Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection. She needs that score. What happened? \nLETOUR Nothing. \nROBERT Don't mess with him. \nLETOUR Burning Spear. \nMANUEL How'd you get in? \nLETOUR C-C. \nMANUEL You buying? \nLETOUR How's product? \nMANUEL (gesture: \"primo\") How much? \nLETOUR I got a problem. I need a piece. \nMANUEL Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy? \nLETOUR A gun. \nMANUEL When? \nLETOUR Now. Anything. (MANUEL is silent) Am I speaking too fast? \nMANUEL How much you spend? \nLETOUR The rate. What you got? \nMANUEL calls over a TEENAGE DOMINICAN, explains the situation in Spanish. The DOMINICAN replies; MANUEL turns back to JOHN: \nMANUEL He's got a 64 Smith-son. Detective Special. Nobody wants 'em. Fresh from a cop. \nLETOUR How much? \nMANUEL (consults DOMINICAN) Four -- including me. \nLETOUR You're fucking me. \nMANUEL (\"so what?\") Street price. \nLETOUR Where is it? \nMANUEL Sigame. \nThey lead him to an even darker back room. The DOMINICAN retrieves an automatic pistol from a trash pail, hands it to MANUEL. JOHN counts cash from Tis' roll; MANNY hefts the piece. \nMANUEL The hundreds -- Franklins. \nBills and guns exchanged. \nLETOUR How do you use this? \nMANUEL Automatic. \nLETOUR I don't have much use for a gun. Never used one like this. \nMANUEL (translates for DOMINICAN) Cono! \nLETOUR It's me. Cologne. I'm a sucker for that cheap airplane stuff. Did Marianne mention him yesterday? \nRANDI (\"no\") It was his apartment. What are you thinking? \nLETOUR I don't know. \nRANDI She jumped. (LETOUR hangs on every word) You loved her, but she -- this sounds terrible but it's true -- she was... she ruined everything... bad luck. \nLETOUR (heard enough) When's the funeral -- your mother's? \nRANDI Tomorrow. Will you come? \nLETOUR (vague) Well, I got this thing to do. It's -- I don't know if I can get away. \nRANDI Try? For me. \nLETOUR I'll try. \nCUT TO: \nPRODIGAL SON \nAnn's apartment. Eight p.m. ANN greets LETOUR with a hug. \nANN The Prodigal Son. \nLETOUR Sorry about last night. Something came up. \nANN Where were you? \nLETOUR T.C.T.E. \nROBERT \"Too Complicated To Explain.\" \nLETOUR (enters bedroom) I'm $500 short from last night. I'll get it, you can take it from my salary. \nANN (stung) This is family. Are you saying that to hurt me? (LETOUR returns) It's not money. \nLETOUR (chagrined) Sorry. \nROBERT Look at this. (\"Akasha\" visual) We had a graphic artist make it up -- you know, Billy, Five Towns. \nANN The label for the cosmetics line. \nLETOUR (examines it) Classy. Sorta -- Katmandu... \nANN (corrects him) Kathmandu. \nLETOUR I love it. \nROBERT Tis called twice. He wants you to come by. \nLETOUR (wary) Me? \nANN Yeah. Says you were supposed to show up again yesterday, but didn't. \nLETOUR (overlapping) You made me -- \nANN -- never washed -- \nLETOUR -- khaki pants. \nANN I should write a book someday. Did you know somebody wanted to do my story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible, of course -- my lawyer freaked I even had the meeting. People envy me. They think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know. I know. Glamorous. (beat) It was for a while. Then came crack and fucked everything. \nJOHN wonders: The Big Goodbye? Is she acting at Tis' behest? \nLETOUR I gotta stop home a second. \nANN Why? It's out of the way. They're expecting you. \n\"They're?\" \nLETOUR You know I got a bad vibe about Tis. \nANN (unconvincing) Chill. This is routine. \nLETOUR I want to get my lucky jacket. \nANN Oh. Okay. \nThe sedan continues south. It turns, stops in front of John's Chelsea apartment building. \nJOHN hops out, goes in. \nInside John's apartment he -- a man possessed -- pulls his black tweed from the closet, throws it on the futon. He rolls up his shirt, reaches under the futon, removes the .38. \nHe straps the gun to his back, wraps duct tape around his chest, end to end over the .38. He tucks in his shirt, puts on the jacket, checks the mirror to see if the gun shows: it doesn't. A pause to appreciate. \nLETOUR closes his diary, throws it out the window: a trifle. He slaps cologne on his cheeks -- annointing; heads toward the door. \nOutside, LETOUR emerges, walks quickly to the car, plops beside ANN. The sedan drives off. Back seat: \nANN That took long enough. What did you do, douche while you were at it? \nLETOUR Ann, you got some mouth on you. \nANN You don't want to know where it's been. (sniffs him) Cologne? \nLETOUR For you. \nANN Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. It's no good for your skin. All chemicals. \nLETOUR pulls out a slip of paper, writes a name and address: \"Linda Wichel, 1012B-2 A Street, Sacramento, California.\" \nANN What's that? \nLETOUR Do me a favor. \nANN What? \nLETOUR Don't ask why, just promise. \nANN And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass! (she spits on his shirt, knees him in the crotch, yanks his gun, throws it beside the gut- clutching CUBAN. She crosses the room, YELLING:) That's it! TIS! Shitball! I know you're fucking there! Let this be a lesson! You wanna deal, you gonna apologize for this! (to LETOUR) Let's go. \nTHOMAS and the CUBAN TEEN retrieve their guns; ANN unlocks the door. \nTHOMAS (pointing gun) Hold it! Stop right there. \nShe turns defiantly. TIS enters from bedroom: \nTIS (to THOMAS) No! (to ANN) Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I was just trying to make a point -- I apologize. \nTIS looks to THOMAS and the CUBAN: they lower their weapons. He only means to threaten LETOUR. \nTIS (about THOMAS and CUBAN) Assholes. What a nightmare. (to ANN) We'll make the deal tomorrow -- same terms. Ann. Sorry. Go on, leave, you're upset. I just need to talk to Tour a second. About a police matter. (to LETOUR) Right? \nLETOUR (to ANN) Go on. \nShe hesitates. \nTIS Tour and I need to get our stories straight. Somebody's talking to the police. The guns were for emphasis, to make a point, dumb -- \nANN gets it. Fear hits: \nANN (to TIS) We came together, we're leaving together. (to LETOUR) Johnny, come with me. \nOpens door. \nTIS (a command) Thomas. \nTHOMAS fixes his gun on ANN. \nTIS (to ANN) Don't be stupid. Get out. Leave. (to LETOUR) I had nothing to do with Marianne -- she jumped: she was there, then she was gone. (nods ANN to leave) Nothing will happen to Tour. \nANN computes, bolts out, flees, SCREAMING at the top of her lungs: \nANN (out of shot) Fire! Fire! Fire! \nThe fire bell rings. \nTHOMAS, TIS, and the CUBAN stare dumbfounded. \nLETOUR reaches behind his shirt in the confusion, yanks out the .38 with a painful rip, turning, fires point-blank into the Cuban's chest. BLAM! Shirt fabric flares, flies: the CUBAN falls with blank expression. \nTHOMAS, off guard, wheels and fires wildly at LETOUR. \nJOHN fires back. Both are hit. TIS ducks into the bedroom. \nTHOMAS and LETOUR fire again, again -- hitting, missing. A bullet hits its mark: THOMAS, frozen, grabs his blood-spurting throat, slumps to floor. \nLETOUR bleeds from the stomach and shoulder. His shirt soaks red; he struggles to stand. CUBAN and THOMAS -- both dead. LETOUR checks the .38: five rounds fired -- one left. \nLETOUR staggers into the bedroom, finds TIS frantically searching an open suitcase. Off-screen VOICES under the fire bell. \nTIS (desperate) I didn't -- \nLETOUR steps to TIS, aims, shoots him barrel to forehead. Exit debris hits the wall. He is dead. \n", "test1_input": "LETOUR Yes. \nTERESA This was very important in your life. \nLETOUR Yes. \nTERESA You are in the balance. Everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next. Every act, every decision matters. \nLETOUR Teresa? \nTERESA What is it? \nLETOUR I'm thirty-eight years old. (beat) Forty. \nTERESA You're young. \nLETOUR I have trouble sleeping. (TERESA waits) Look. What do you see around me? Is there anything? Is it dark? Have I run out of luck? Is there luck? \nTERESA I see a glow. Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you. \nCUT TO: \nMONEY CHANGER \nAnn's apartment. The night has already begun. ANN sits on the floor beside a YOUNG HASID counting money. He wears Orthodox garb: black hat, black coat, peyas. Tibetan bells reverb from speakers as the Bergmanesque cambist runs faced twenty-dollar bills through a battery-operated counting machine, places stacks of cash on the floor. ROBERT returns a call from the kitchen; LETOUR emerges from the bathroom, wiping his hands. \nANN (to LETOUR and ROBERT) Your pay's on the table. \nJOHN walks to the cosmetics corner, finds an envelope with his name on it, looks inside: $500 in twenties. He pockets the money. \nLETOUR sits as HASID double-checks the total: cash covers the available floor space. \nYOUNG HASID (dialogue punctuates action) One hundred thirty-one, let's make it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small bills. One percent commission, $130 to you -- add tens or whatever if you want. \nOpening a satchel, he removes bound $100s, counts off 130 as ANN adds up commission in small bills. He loads the satchel: \nYOUNG HASID Same time? \nANN (nods) Two weeks -- don't run. Stay a while. We'll order kosher. We'll tell you dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism. \nThe HASID laughs. He likes her. \nYOUNG HASID (passes hundreds) I'm late already. I only come 'cause I like you. Sure you're not Jewish? I don't want to see you hurt. Find a man. You should do something else. \nANN (offers commission) Invest in my cosmetics line. \nYOUNG HASID (takes money) Don't mix business with friendship. \nANN follows him to the door. \nYOUNG HASID Shalom. \nANN Shalom. (opens door) See you next week. (calls after him) Don't eat any hot dogs! \nANN closes door. \n", "test1_true": "ANN It's all over the news. \nLETOUR Jealous said to be careful. \nANN We are careful. \nROBERT (returning) We're too small time. Besides, she wasn't one of ours -- not directly. (to LETOUR) Tis is at St. Luke's. He wants somebody over right away. Second floor waiting room. \nLETOUR A hospital? What's he doing there? \nROBERT He says he needs you to come to St. Luke's. I'd go but I got the other thing. \nLETOUR The --? \nROBERT Yeah. \nANN (to LETOUR) Go. Keep on his good side. He set up Arizona. \nPhone rings; Ann's machine answers: \"Hello, this is Ann...\" \nANN (to LETOUR) Let's have lunch. Tomorrow. \nLETOUR Me? \nANN One o'clock. C\u00f4te Basque. Is that too early? \nLETOUR No. Yeah -- sure. \nROBERT Tonight? \nLETOUR I vote Japanese. \nANN Fine. \nROBERT Okay. \nLETOUR (heads for door) Mixed sushi. Oshitashi. \nCUT TO: \nST. LUKE'S \nEMS vehicles line street outside St. Luke's -- Roosevelt Hospital. Inside, LETOUR weaves through Emergency (eerie), double-steps the stairs, looks for the second floor waiting area. \nTIS (Mathis -- pronounced Tees), thirty-five, Swiss, paces in the waiting room. He wears a linen jacket, horn-rim glasses, Cerrutti Euro-swank. He spots JOHN, takes him aside: \nLETOUR What's going on? \nTIS You got some valiums? \nLETOUR (nods) -- 'n 'ludes. \nTIS Just a valium -- a ten. \nLETOUR What is it? \n", "test1_id": 3147, "test2_input": "CUT TO: \nGENERAL HOSPITAL \nAfternoon. St. Luke's. LETOUR, wearing tweed jacket, walks down the corridor, checks room numbers. A NURSE passes. He stops at a room, pushes the door a crack, peeks inside, quietly enters. \nInside the hospital room, MRS. JOST, sixty-five, lies sedated, attached to IV tubes and a respirator. Flowers wreathe the bed. \nRANDI sleeps in a chair by the window. \nLETOUR looks from MRS. JOST to RANDI and back again: a vibrant woman reduced to a shell. He soundlessly eases into a vacant chair. \nHis mind goes back. \nRANDI twists fitfully in her chair. A stuffed bear peeks over family photos on the window sill. \nMARIANNE steps into the doorway, stops, frozen -- watching the tableau: JOHN, RANDI, her mother. Her face is ravaged: the death watch has taken its toll. LETOUR reaches his arm, touches the hospital bed. \nMARIANNE tiptoes behind JOHN. He turns, stands. \nLETOUR (soft) I'm sorry. I... \nShe puts her finger to her lips. He nods. She steps closer, holds him politely. His cheek nestles in her neck. \nThey turn toward the door, step into the corridor, walk arm in arm as if supporting each other. \nLETOUR (after a moment) I always thought my father would die first. He would die, then my mother and I would reconcile. Just her and me. I hated him for living. \nMARIANNE It's like a joke. It's not a real feeling. It's like a feeling of a feeling. \nLETOUR My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded. (beat) I miss you. \nThey stop. She kisses him. \nMARIANNE You tried to kill me. You took ten years of my life one way or another. (he kisses her) I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too busy hating you. \nLETOUR I thought I was just killing myself. \nShe runs her hands under his shirt, up his back. \nLETOUR Selfish. \nMARIANNE I remember. \nLETOUR What? \nMARIANNE What it felt like. (kisses his face) What this tasted like. \nHe slips his hands under her blouse, caresses her breasts. \nLETOUR I see you and my heart starts thumping. \nMARIANNE John. \nThey kiss deeper, bodies grinding. The painful present fades. A NURSE approaches with WHEELCHAIR PATIENT. She tries to pass one side of JOHN and MARIANNE, tries the other side, is blocked again. The NURSE stops, stares at their soap opera. \n", "test2_true": "LETOUR Excuse us. (to MARIANNE) Let's go. \nMARIANNE Come. Come with me. \nCUT TO: \nHOTEL SEX \nParamount hotel room: Vermeer's Lace Maker dominates Phillipe Stark decor. \nLETOUR and MARIANNE are all over each other. The pain of the moment, the pain of the past are subsumed by passion. Blind, welcome sexuality. \nNaked, they kneel facing each other on the bed, faded bleeding heart tattoo on his bicep: \nLETOUR Have you ever had sex totally straight? \nMARIANNE Not with you. \nLETOUR Neither have I. \nMARIANNE Such an erection. \nLETOUR Never had anything like it stoned. Feel it. (she does) \nMARIANNE Weird. \nLETOUR (caresses erection) Wow. \nMARIANNE I'm dripping. \nLETOUR Let's disappear. \nThey smack their sweaty bodies, tumble yelping to the carpet, kiss indiscriminately: \nLETOUR Kiss, kiss, kiss. \nMARIANNE Kiss, kiss, kiss. \nLETOUR Together. \nLater: night. They lie nude in a scramble of twisted sheets and mattresses. Street lights cast horizontal shadows. LETOUR crawls over, falls upon Marianne's breast. She wakes up, looks at JOHN, looks out the window, returns to slow sad reality. \nMARIANNE stands, pulls on her panties. \nLETOUR (waking) You need to go back? \nShe dresses before responding: \nMARIANNE This is the end. It was wonderful. I'm glad it happened this way. It will never happen again. You will not see me, you will not call me again. I'm happy for you. I wish you the best. I'm leaving. I'm going back to the hospital. I shouldn't have left -- but I don't regret it. Please dress and leave as soon as possible. I have a key. Goodbye. \nLETOUR Marianne... \nMARIANNE It's my fault. \nMARIANNE, clothes askew, exits. \n", "test2_id": 3148, "test3_input": "LETOUR Marianne... \nMARIANNE (emotion rising) Every time you come into my life something terrible happens. I thought I was rid of you. How'd you get here? I don't want you here! I don't want you around me, I don't want you around my mother! Damn you! \nLETOUR Marianne... \nMARIANNE (wild) Get out! \nA PLAZA MEMORIAL EMPLOYEE approaches. RANDI, in black, intervenes, pulls JOHN toward the door. MARIANNE YELLS from behind: \"Out!\" Outside, they stop midsidewalk. \nLETOUR I didn't... \nRANDI I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You shouldn't have come. Marianne has been up all night, crying and crying. She wasn't there when Mother passed -- died -- she blames herself. It wouldn't have made any difference. She just slipped away. Marianne's -- I'm worried -- \nA CRACKHEAD strides past trash ramparts, cursing, demanding money: \"Fuck white devil, fucking the black, give the fucking money, white fuck...,\" etc. \nLETOUR It's... \nRANDI Don't try. \nLETOUR How are you? \nRANDI Me? \nLETOUR Yes, you. I can't think of anything, but if there was anything I could do... \nRANDI Thanks. I'm okay -- I guess. I mean, we've been expecting it. It'll hit me later. \nLETOUR I saw her. \nRANDI Who? \nLETOUR Your mother. I came in the room. You were sleeping. I just watched. \nRANDI Oh. (beat) I'd better get back. Marianne's probably flipping out. \nShe re-enters the funeral chapel. \nCUT TO: \nON A ROLL \nEight p.m. LETOUR, direct from Plaza Memorial, enters Ann's apartment. ANN, coiffured and made up, gestures to take-out tins: \nANN Have some shu mai. Just delivered. \nLETOUR No. \nROBERT (entering) I told Ann you'd be on time. Tis called. He said before ten. He said you were right. \nANN About what? \nLETOUR An undercover cop. Not a narc. The Park murder. Jealous was straight on that -- you hear anything? \nROBERT Remember the time that cop called here? Wanted to know if we had \"nose candy\"? (laughs) Ann says, \"John Candy?\" \"John Candy?\" \n", "test3_true": "ANN What's wrong baby? You like like shit. Something wrong? (holds his face) \nLETOUR No. \nANN You can't fool me. I can read you. \nLETOUR (distressed) What do you care? You're leaving me. A few more months -- sayonara. (to ROBERT) You too. John who? What was his name again? Le --? (to ANN: pained) I mean it's not exactly like I got a pension plan. \nROBERT (hurt) Jack. \nANN (takes his hands) Johnny, it's not that at all. Is that what you think? You hate cosmetics. You don't care about it. You told me that. \nLETOUR I know. \nANN Who knows what will happen? \nROBERT I got a friend -- a D.D. -- got into lapidary. I'll introduce you. You have to pass a test. \nLETOUR Lapi --? \nROBERT Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds. \nLETOUR Any more about the Park murder? \nANN (re: murder) What's with this thing? \nROBERT Stay away. \nANN (genuine) You want in? We'll make a place for you. \nLETOUR No. \nANN It's -- \nThe kitchen phone rings. A voice follows the pre-recorded message: \nEDDIE (out of shot -- answering machine) \"Ann, this is Ed. You gotta come. The other thing is over. I'll be home all night. 749-2876.\" \nROBERT Shit. \nANN (unequivocal) Don't answer it. Let him call all night. He's trouble. I don't want to deal with him. \nLETOUR It's alright, I'll go. Let me handle it. \nROBERT I'm sorry if -- \nANN (about EDDIE) He gives you shit -- fuck him. \nLETOUR (to ROBERT) Forget it. \nROBERT We're going Chinese tonight, okay? I mean we're on a roll -- \nANN Spring roll. \nLETOUR (preparing to leave) Sure, whatever. Surprise me. \n", "test3_id": 3149}

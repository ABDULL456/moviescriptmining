{"test1_input": "LIGHT SLEEPER \nWritten by \nPaul Schrader \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nJOHN LETOUR, forty, light sleeper. Never meant to be a drug dealer, it just came along. He's been other things: messenger boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub shill -- never meant to be them either. Now he's a D.D. Drug dealer. \nJOHN LETOUR, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, \"Beatle\" boots, a shadow drifting in and out of other shadows, New York, day, night: watching, listening, rarely speaking -- nonexistent, seen only by those he sees. His face an affable blank. Make of it what you will. The eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. A map of calculation. \nOnce he had a drug problem. Life turned a page. Today he follows instructions: he sleeps light -- one eye open, anticipating. JOHN LETOUR, D.D., loner, voyeur, has been drifting toward an unknown destination. At mid-life the destination draws near. The circle tightens. The dealer is anxious. The destination is love. \nNIGHT IN THE LIFE \nCREDIT SEQUENCE: New York by night. JOHN LETOUR nestles in back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the window. Neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose. \nHis beeper goes off. He clicks it, checks the digital message. The DRIVER stops at an uptown corner. LETOUR opens the curbside door, motions to the DRIVER he'll be back in \"ten\" minutes. He enters the video laundromat, a twenty-four-hour video rental/laundromat/tanning salon. \nInside, he meets a RETRO-YUPPIE (J. Crew Division) in the \"Classics\" section. They exit. \nOn the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet. LETOUR pockets the uncounted cash. The YUPPIE mouths goodbye, eager to put distance between him and LETOUR. JOHN checks his beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials. \nJOHN LETOUR re-enters the sedan; the DRIVER heads downtown. High-rises give way to Tudor City. Uncollected trash lines the curbs. LETOUR eyes a PEDESTRIAN; PEDESTRIAN looks back. Later. Three a.m. The streets are dark. LeTour's car passes a glowing Korean market. \nLETOUR narrates from diary: \nLETOUR (voice over) Labor Day weekend. Some time for a sanitation strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at the last minute and want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity -- it keeps you sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night -- now and then. Just to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start another. \nThe sedan drives on. End credits. \nCUT TO: \nHOMEBASE \nFour a.m.: streets empty. LeTour's sedan drops him off near a ten-story West 80s apartment building. JOHN gives the DRIVER a forty-dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner. He presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. He enters the lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture toward the elevators. Presses the button. \nPenthouse C door opens. ANN lets JOHN in with a smile. \nANN, forty-four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him with a wet kiss. Her hair is coiffured, her face made up. She is John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen: she keeps the books. Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: she's been in the drug business fifteen years. \nAnn's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine photos of Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, the Duke of Windsor -- paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. A bird flits in its cage. One corner of the living area is devoted to a fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer, billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, reference books, color charts. \nROBERT, fifty, slight, waves hello as JOHN locks the door. Gay, hip, worn, he's John's \"co-runner.\" \nThey work -- and eat -- out of Ann's apartment. Take-out tins of Indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, glasses, and vitamin bottles. No sign of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or money. \nANN Darling. \nLETOUR Ann. \nANN Have we made New York safe for another weekend? \nLETOUR (waves) Robert. \n", "test1_true": "LETOUR (about ROBERT) Sad what ten years without sex can do. \nRepartee: the plumbing of family feeling. \nJOHN unzips his belt pouch, walks toward the bedroom to deposit the night's earnings. \nANN Any hundreds? \nLETOUR Twenties -- and tens. \nROBERT Tens! \nANN Goddamn cash machines. \nROBERT Did what's-his-name give you a hard time? \nLETOUR (out of shot) You mean --? \nROBERT Yeah. \nLETOUR Cash Before Delivery. (re-emerges) CBD. \nROBERT Fucking investment bankers. \nANN These Wall Street kids deal with fake money all day, they think cash is a theoretical concept -- like it doesn't apply. I see 'em at two, shudder to think at nine they're buying and selling -- turned me off the stock market. \nLETOUR It's late. (to ROBERT) You staying? \nROBERT It's over. \nLETOUR I'm gonna crash -- try, at least. \nANN (to LETOUR) Tomorrow will be easier. Maybe we can all eat together. Go on. You look tired. Here, take a couple of C's. I'll pick up anything that comes in. \nLETOUR turns to leave. \nANN Sleep tight. \nROBERT Pick up the trash. \nLETOUR (laughs) Yeah -- big kiss. \nHe throws two kisses, exits. \nCUT TO: \nJOHN'S APARTMENT \nFirst light reflects across the Hudson as LETOUR walks west on 22nd Street toward his Chelsea apartment building. A delivery truck passes uncollected garbage. He enters a nondescript doorway. Inside his studio apartment, JOHN sits at a second-hand table writing in a composition book. He drinks from an eight-ounce glass of white wine, continues. \nThe room has little personality; Ann's apartment has enough for two. Nails indicate where pictures once hung; a boombox sits on the linoleum floor amid cassettes, books (Autobiography of a Yogi, The Secret Doctrine), fashion magazines, a stack of unopened CDs. A futon is unrolled beneath the room's sole decoration, a poster of a human foot advertising a forgotten photo exhibit. Wine bottles -- Chenin Blanc. Precious little to show for forty years. \nLeTour's narration resumes as he writes: \nLETOUR (voice over) \"Labor Day.\" \"Union Movement\" -- there's a contradiction in terms. I know about long hours. It's worse when I'm off -- I just walk and walk. Where am I going? There's an element of providence to it all. Like rolling numbers. Luck. You're walking down the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up four hours ago, there's an APB description out and a cop pulls you in cause he's cold and wants to go inside -- they grab your stash. Your number's up. You're busted for nothing. For bad luck. \n", "test1_id": 3147, "test2_input": "EDDIE (contrite) Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right. I didn't mean that. I'm quitting anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry. \nLETOUR (turns back) Okay. \nEDDIE Two hundred? \nLETOUR nods. \nEDDIE counts $200 as LETOUR takes a gram from his pouch, gives it to him. \nLETOUR You got downs? (EDDIE nods) One more thing. I gotta use the phone. \nEDDIE pockets the envelope as JOHN, checking his beeper, walks to the phone. \nLater. LETOUR sits in an Upper West Side apartment as an earnest MID-TWENTIESH MAN, wearing undershorts, snorts a hefty line, offers a rolled dollar bill as he talks. LETOUR declines. \nMID-TWENTIESH MAN (continuing) ...but -- if there's no God, how can man conceive of him? The idea of God presupposes the existence of God. That's the Ontological Argument. Anselm. Twelve hundred. Fourteen hundred -- I'm not sure -- \nLETOUR (checks his watch) I've got to go. \nMID-TWENTIESH MAN (gesturing) Let me finish. Okay, if the idea of God is implanted by God -- the sensus divinitatus, the sense of the divine -- what is the role of human thought? Not faith, thought... \nLETOUR's mind drifts. His diary voice overlaps: \nLETOUR (Voice over) Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. He understands. Of course they're stoned to start. If I could tie together all the hours of coke talk I've heard, that would be a lot of string. It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. Fifty is more like it. \nLater. Narration continues as sedan drives through rain. Later. A Tribeca loft. LETOUR swaps drug jargon with TWO N.Y.U. STUDENTS at an impromptu party. Attractive ingenues drift by. TRENDY TWOSOME, blasted, sways, to techno-rap. \nBusiness done, LETOUR turns to leave. The FIRST STUDENT grabs his shoulder: \nFIRST STUDENT C'mon, Tour, stick around. \nSECOND STUDENT Yeah. \nFIRST STUDENT There's only four of us and like seven of them -- and we're paying for the dope. See her, over there, the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? -- she's gonna model for Elite. \nDOWNTOWN NYMPH, sixteen going on seventeen. \nLETOUR (smiling) Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me like an old horse. \nSECOND STUDENT Shit, dude -- \nLETOUR Nah. Thanks anyway. (checks watch) I gotta go. Have fun. (heads toward exit) \nCUT TO: \nFACE FROM THE PAST \nLeTour's sedan heads down Lexington Avenue. It rains unabated. Puddles glisten; red taillights refract on the windshield. JOHN rests in back, a bag from Enhancements beside him. \nPedestrians, well-dressed and casual, desperately wave for taxis amid sacks of garbage. No use: nothing for blocks. \nJohn's sedan stops for a midtown light. LETOUR looks out the window, sees a WOMAN vainly hailing a cab. He looks again. She turns her head. He recognizes her. \nLETOUR (to DRIVER) Carlos. Wait a second. \n", "test2_true": "LETOUR Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll give you a ride. \nMARIANNE JOST, thirty-five, stylish in short black hair and long black coat, steps closer, looks through the rain. \nLETOUR John. John LeTour. \nMARIANNE (recognizes him) John? \nLETOUR Get in. You're getting soaked. \nShe ducks inside, slams the door. \nMARIANNE (awkward) Hi... \nThe car moves on. \nLETOUR Where are you going? \nMARIANNE wipes rain from her cheeks; her expression deepens: cautious, suspicious. No reply. \nLETOUR I didn't know you still lived here. \nMARIANNE (second thoughts) Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I should get out. \nLETOUR Don't be crazy. It's pouring. \nMARIANNE I'm not supposed to be around -- \nLETOUR (completes sentence) -- former drug associates. \nMARIANNE It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no nothing. \nLETOUR I heard. I'm happy for you. \nMARIANNE It's still not easy. \nLETOUR I know. Mar, you don't need to avoid me. I'm straight -- two years. It came that time. I tried to tell you. I wrote. I called. \nMARIANNE (looks around) I should get out. \nLETOUR Honest. \nMARIANNE But you're dealing. \nLETOUR No. I stopped. \nMARIANNE What's in the bag? \nLETOUR Almond oil. You can check. (opens bag) Look. \nShe does: Enhancements Almond Oil. John's beeper goes off! -- he punches it. \nLETOUR Shit. \nMARIANNE What's that for? In case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night? \n", "test2_id": 3148, "test3_input": "LETOUR Marianne... \nMARIANNE (emotion rising) Every time you come into my life something terrible happens. I thought I was rid of you. How'd you get here? I don't want you here! I don't want you around me, I don't want you around my mother! Damn you! \nLETOUR Marianne... \nMARIANNE (wild) Get out! \nA PLAZA MEMORIAL EMPLOYEE approaches. RANDI, in black, intervenes, pulls JOHN toward the door. MARIANNE YELLS from behind: \"Out!\" Outside, they stop midsidewalk. \nLETOUR I didn't... \nRANDI I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You shouldn't have come. Marianne has been up all night, crying and crying. She wasn't there when Mother passed -- died -- she blames herself. It wouldn't have made any difference. She just slipped away. Marianne's -- I'm worried -- \nA CRACKHEAD strides past trash ramparts, cursing, demanding money: \"Fuck white devil, fucking the black, give the fucking money, white fuck...,\" etc. \nLETOUR It's... \nRANDI Don't try. \nLETOUR How are you? \nRANDI Me? \nLETOUR Yes, you. I can't think of anything, but if there was anything I could do... \nRANDI Thanks. I'm okay -- I guess. I mean, we've been expecting it. It'll hit me later. \nLETOUR I saw her. \nRANDI Who? \nLETOUR Your mother. I came in the room. You were sleeping. I just watched. \nRANDI Oh. (beat) I'd better get back. Marianne's probably flipping out. \nShe re-enters the funeral chapel. \nCUT TO: \nON A ROLL \nEight p.m. LETOUR, direct from Plaza Memorial, enters Ann's apartment. ANN, coiffured and made up, gestures to take-out tins: \nANN Have some shu mai. Just delivered. \nLETOUR No. \nROBERT (entering) I told Ann you'd be on time. Tis called. He said before ten. He said you were right. \nANN About what? \nLETOUR An undercover cop. Not a narc. The Park murder. Jealous was straight on that -- you hear anything? \nROBERT Remember the time that cop called here? Wanted to know if we had \"nose candy\"? (laughs) Ann says, \"John Candy?\" \"John Candy?\" \n", "test3_true": "ANN What's wrong baby? You like like shit. Something wrong? (holds his face) \nLETOUR No. \nANN You can't fool me. I can read you. \nLETOUR (distressed) What do you care? You're leaving me. A few more months -- sayonara. (to ROBERT) You too. John who? What was his name again? Le --? (to ANN: pained) I mean it's not exactly like I got a pension plan. \nROBERT (hurt) Jack. \nANN (takes his hands) Johnny, it's not that at all. Is that what you think? You hate cosmetics. You don't care about it. You told me that. \nLETOUR I know. \nANN Who knows what will happen? \nROBERT I got a friend -- a D.D. -- got into lapidary. I'll introduce you. You have to pass a test. \nLETOUR Lapi --? \nROBERT Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds. \nLETOUR Any more about the Park murder? \nANN (re: murder) What's with this thing? \nROBERT Stay away. \nANN (genuine) You want in? We'll make a place for you. \nLETOUR No. \nANN It's -- \nThe kitchen phone rings. A voice follows the pre-recorded message: \nEDDIE (out of shot -- answering machine) \"Ann, this is Ed. You gotta come. The other thing is over. I'll be home all night. 749-2876.\" \nROBERT Shit. \nANN (unequivocal) Don't answer it. Let him call all night. He's trouble. I don't want to deal with him. \nLETOUR It's alright, I'll go. Let me handle it. \nROBERT I'm sorry if -- \nANN (about EDDIE) He gives you shit -- fuck him. \nLETOUR (to ROBERT) Forget it. \nROBERT We're going Chinese tonight, okay? I mean we're on a roll -- \nANN Spring roll. \nLETOUR (preparing to leave) Sure, whatever. Surprise me. \n", "test3_id": 3149}

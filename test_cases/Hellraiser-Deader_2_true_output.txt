She comes around a corner and onto a narrow street, moving fast, her feet making loud echoey clip-clops on the street. 
There's a bum, dressed in rags, leaning up against the wall of a building. 
As she approaches him, he stirs slightly. Then she looks more closely. 
The man is eating something very crunchy. He stares at her blankly as he picks crickets off the wall and devours them, one by one. He offers her one, and smiles. 
Amy leaps back, turns and runs. Some distance down the street, there seems to be a flicker of light, a trace of noise. 
She scrambles toward it. It's coming up from a subway grate. She throws herself down on it. 
Down below she can hear the roar of a subway train passing below. Indirect, flickering light shines up from below. 
She looks up. There's a subway entrance. She hurries toward it. 
INT. TOKEN BOOTH - NIGHT 
Amy comes down the stairs. No sign of life. The fluorescent lights flicker - some dead. Amy fumbles for her metro card. This is one of those unattended entrances with entry through the top-to-bottom turnstiles. 
She starts through the turnstile. Then with a squeak, it sticks and she finds herself stuck half-way through, unable to move forward or backward. She tries to back out, but the thing won't turn in that direction. She heaves forward. It finally gives way. She looks this way and that, back through the turnstile, she sees her bloody footprints leading all the way through. 
Amy hears footsteps echoing towards her. Through a large mirror at an intersection, she sees the source of the footsteps. A cop on the beat. 
Amy looks down and sees she is standing in a pool of her own blood. The footsteps get louder. 
She sees a stack of newspapers next to her on a stand. She grabs one and throws it down in front of herself to cover the blood. It soaks threw in no time. The Cop is nearing the corner. She grabs another, then another, and throws them down. The pool of her blood leaks from under them all. The cop rounds the corner, he has a baton he taps against his leg. 
Amy grabs the whole stand and tips it over. With a loud SMASH, it spills the newspaper everywhere. As the cop walks in front of Amy, the blood is hidden beneath the pile of newspapers. Amy bends down to attend to the mess. 
She makes eyes with the Cop and shrugs her shoulders at her "mistake". The Cop smiles and nods, and keeps on walking. The sound of his footsteps vanish down the corridors. 
Amy collects herself with a few deep breaths, and moves on towards the platform. 
INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT 
Amy stands on the platform as a train whooshes into the station at HYPER-SPEED then stops instantly in front of her. 
The doors hiss open and Amy is greeted by the tall Odd- looking Conductor. She pushes past him. 
INT. TRAIN - NIGHT 
The train lurches forward as Amy makes her way through the usual crowd of CELEBRANTS. 
She finds Joey sitting court in the middle of the train car. He's wearing a pair of terminator sunglasses. 
Amy approaches. His face seems sickly pale in the flashing light. 
He moves abruptly, a slight turn of the head -- toward her. 
JOEY Well look who's back. What now? 
AMY I need... please... please help me. 
JOEY Help you with what? 
Amy hesitates an instant, then tugs open her shirt, revealing the gaffer's tape that holds the rolled-up towel to her back. She works at it. Finally, it tears. She tears it straight down the front of her chest as Joey watches, passive.

BOA CONTINUED: 
BILLY (still at window) Well, at least they'll never believe the kid now. Jerry glances down and sees a sliver of mirror from Peter's cracked cigarette case at his feet. He picks it up, examining it. He casts no reflection in it. He holds it up for Billy to see. 
JERRY No? 
(RISING) Let's go. He grabs his leather jacket and moves- down the hallway toward the back door, Billy quickly following.

CHARLEY 
Peter Vincent. He said Dandrige had no reflection. 
EVIL ED Probably just a trick of the light.

AMY (confused by the

EVIL ED (bored with it all) Oh, for Christ sake -- 
He turns, about to duck between two houses. 
CHARLEY Where are you going? 
EVIL ED Rome. It's dinner time. 
CHARLEY Wait a minute. We walk Amy home first. 
EVIL ED Why? 
CHARLEY Because it's after dark, pencil.dick, and there's a vampire back there! Be points back at the Dandrige house. Evil Ed just stares at him. 
EVIL ED Oh, shit, Brewster, you're certifiable, you know that.

RACHEL And he gets disqualified but he doesn't care! 
EMMA Where'd she get the skates from? 
They collapse in laughter. Kym studies her ass in the mirror. 
KYM I should call her right this second. Is she really coming? Who are all these energetic young people decorating the house? 
EMMA She's got everyone she knows pulling elf duty. 
KYM (squinting at her ass) What about me? What am I doing? Rachel and Emma exchange a look. 
KYM Hello? 
RACHEL Well, I think you'll be assisting on floral detail. I want everything all drippy and luxurious and Mom's a little bit tasteful-- 
KYM --Mom's in charge of flowers? 
RACHEL --and I don't want to upset her. 
EMMA (to Kym) And you're such a diplomat.

KYM I am. I'm like Kofi Annan. In rehab they said I was the maternal hub of my peer group. I was always the referee for softball. 
Rachel snorts. 
KYM I was. I was the only one who could convince the methamphetamine freaks that no one was chasing them when they ran around the bases. 
EMMA It's softball. Someone was chasing them. 
KYM Whatever. They have trust issues in the first place. I'm going downstairs to find Olive and get some unconditional love. Kym swans out of the room. 
KYM Anyway, I'm doing some lighting. I already got the candles and everything. Rachel and Emma share a look. 
KYM (CONT'D) Forget Mom and me and the fucking flowers. 
9   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. DAY.                                9 
Kym crosses the hall to ETHAN'S ROOM and opens the door. 
KYM Speaking of dawgs, when am I going to meet this fiancee of yours anyway? 
RACHEL VOICE OFF He went to get stuff with Kieran. They'll be back. 
10   INT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY.                                      10 
A little boy's bedroom. Pale blue. A single bed, a window, some games. Some stuff in boxes. Not a mausoleum. 
Kym enters Ethan's room. She stands there looking around. 
She takes a moment... 
11   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. DAY.                                  11 Kym wandering the upstairs hallway...the winding corridors are a little spooky, despite the openness and light, it feels haunted up here...looking into her old bedroom, seeing Emma's stuff inside. 
12   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. DAY.   --LOOKING DOWN--               12 Paul comes to the bottom of the stairs, yelling up. 
PAUL I'm making hot dogs and hungabungas! Who wants what?! 
Rachel and Emma shout back down. 
RACHEL It's too hot! 
EMMA I don't eat gluten, Paul! 
PAUL What don't you eat?!

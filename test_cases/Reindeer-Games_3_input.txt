YOUNG GOVERNOR We want you doing the job... that we brought you here to do. 
INT. TOMAHAWK - DAY 
Rudy and Ashley move away from a change booth, with a bucket of quarters. Rudy messes with his cowboy getup, noting two SECURITY GUARDS punch a code in a private door, step inside: 
ASHLEY So does it look a lot different? 
RUDY Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now. 
They settle at a slot machine. Another SECURITY GUARD walks past them. Rudy turns his back. Ashley notices. 
ASHLEY That guy knows you? 
RUDY Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike. 
At the door, Merlin and Jumpy enter, wandering through the slots. 
Rudy sees them. 
RUDY You start spending your brother's money. I'm gonna take a circuit around the joint, check for any new ins and outs. I'll snag us some drinks. 
As he strides away -- 
ASHLEY (sotto) Be careful, Nick... 
MOVING THROUGH THE CASINO 
with Rudy, ambling among the tables, making a show of checking out the layout. In reality, he's surveying the GAMBLERS. 
Passing the cage, he walks right by Jack Bangs and the Indian governors. Jack Bangs is all smiles, while the governors turn their backs an him and storm out. 
ARRIVING AT THE BAR 
RUDY Couple rum and Cokes, please. 
INDIAN BARTENDER You want that rum and Coke or rum and Pepsi? 
Rudy gives him a strange look. The bartender shrugs. Rudy still scans the tables, settling on -- 
A BLACKJACK TABLE 
where a trio of COLLEGE KIDS are forking over chips. One of them's dark-haired with a goatee, a sweatshirt and jeans. Rudy studies this kid for moment. 
JACK BANGS (O.S.) Gimme a goddamn bottle of anything. 
BACK AT THE BAR 
Jack Bangs sidles up, distraught. The barkeep hands him a bottle. Bangs takes a swig. 
JACK BANGS I can't go back to Vegas, Bear. They'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? I can't go back... 
BARTENDER What does the tribe want? 
JACK BANGS They want gold-paved roads is what they want. Talking 'bout the fuckin' Paiutes. Fuckin' Paiutes are on the interstate. Nothing I can do about that, man, I didn't pick the spot for your reservation. 
BARTENDER Neither did we. 
JACK BANGS Yeah, yeah, whatever. 
Rudy gets his drinks, as Jack Bangs turns his way: 
JACK BANGS Hey. Hey, cowboy. Jack Bangs, I run the place. Nice to have you in the Tomahawk. Tell me something... 
Rudy winces, glancing to see Merlin and Jumpy watching him. Frowns on their faces. 
JACK BANGS ...does upstate Michigan need another roadside casino or does upstate Michigan need an international gaming destination? 
RUDY (wants outta here) Roadside casino? 
Jack Bangs, smile falls flat. 
JACK BANGS Well, so how'd you hear about this place, then. Word-of-mouth? Mass mailings? Cable TV? 
RUDY Prison. 
JACK BANGS Prison?! 
Rudy shrugs, smiles, takes off with his drinks. Bangs looks sick, turns to a FAT GUY on the next stool over. But before he can ask, the guy shakes his head -- 
FAT GUY I just stopped in to use the can. 
Bangs turns to the bartender, puts his head in his hands: 
JACK BANGS I can't go back to Vegas, Bear... I can't... 
From the slots, we hear a JACKPOT PAYOFF. 
JACK BANGS Aw fuck. 
THROUGH THE TABLES 
walks Rudy, as Merlin sidles up next to him: 
MERLIN What the hell was that about -- 
RUDY He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me. 
Merlin eyes him darkly, but lets him walk on into the slots. As he nears Ashley, he glances to the blackjack table, where the College Kid has left... heading for the bathroom -- 
ASHLEY Hey Nick! We're up fifty cents!

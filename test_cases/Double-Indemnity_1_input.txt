B-20 NEFF - ON PHONE 
His eyes are on Keyes. He speaks into the phone as calmly as possible. 
NEFF I'm listening. Only make it short... Margie. 
B-21 PHYLLIS - ON PHONE 
PHYLLIS He's on crutches. The doctor says he can go if he's careful. The change will do him good. It's wonderful, Walter. Just the way you wanted it. Only with the crutches it's ever so much better, isn't it? 
B-22 NEFF'S OFFICE 
Neff on phone. 
NEFF One hundred percent better. Hold the line a minute. 
He covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who is now standing at the window. 
NEFF Suppose I join you in your office, Keyes -- 
He makes a gesture as if expecting Keyes to leave. Keyes stays right where he is. 
KEYES I'll wait. Only tell Margie not to take all day. 
Neff looks at Keyes' back with a strained expression, then lifts the phone again. 
NEFF Go ahead. 
B-23 PHYLLIS, ON PHONE 
PHYLLIS It's the ten-fifteen from Glendale. I'm driving him. Is it still that same dark street? 
B-24 NEFF, ON PHONE 
He is still watching Keyes cautiously. 
NEFF Yeah -- sure. 
B-24A CLOSEUP - PHYLLIS - ON PHONE 
PHYLLIS The signal is three honks on the horn. Is there anything else? 
B-24B CLOSEUP NEFF, ON PHONE 
NEFF What color did you pick out? 
B-25 PHYLLIS, ON PHONE 
PHYLLIS Color? (She catches on) Oh, sure. The blue suit, Walter. Navy blue. And the cast on his left leg. 
B-26 NEFF, ON PHONE 
NEFF Navy blue. I like that fine. 
B-27 PHYLLIS, ON PHONE 
PHYLLIS This is it, Walter. I'm shaking like a leaf. But it's straight down the line now for both of us. I love you, Walter. Goodbye. 
B-28 NEFF'S OFFICE 
Neff on the phone. 
NEFF So long, Margie. 
He hangs up. His mouth is grim, but he forces a smile as Keyes turns. 
NEFF I'm sorry, Keyes. 
KEYES What's the matter? The dames chasing you again? Or still? Or is it none of my business? 
NEFF (With a sour smile) If I told you it was a customer -- 
KEYES Margie! I bet she drinks from the bottle. Why don't you settle down and get married, Walter? 
NEFF Why don't you, for instance? 
KEYES I almost did, once. A long time ago. 
Neff gets up from his desk. 
NEFF Look, Keyes, I've got a prospect to call on. 
Keyes drives right ahead. 
KEYES We even had the church all picked out, the dame and I. She had a white satin dress with flounces on it. And I was on my way to the jewelry store to buy the ring. Then suddenly that little man in here started working on me. 
He punches his stomach with his fist.

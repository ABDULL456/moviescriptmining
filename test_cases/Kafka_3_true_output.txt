MURNAU Life is more than a Chinese puzzle, my friend. 
CUT: 
FLOOR OF CLERKS 
Uniformly, like a chorus line, the infinite row of clerks turn their heads from their single endless desk when they hear an awful NOISE: 
Mr. Pick is breaking through from the floor below.  The inexorably rising chain has hauled him floor by floor through the Castle, breaking open holes too small for his body, shredding him along the way, and still carrying him upwards 
CUT: 
CASTLE CORRIDOR 
Kafka walks along with Murnau and Ekman.  The Laughing Man holds Kafka's arm. 
KAFKA And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends. 
MURNAU Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious. 
They pass another of those grinding chains carrying memos and inter-office directives up and down. 
MURNAU But you're quite right that he didn't die in that cave-in. In fact, he didn't die at all. He was simply recalled -- by himself.  As well as being Head of Medical Records here and a Director of your firm -- I'm Dr. Murnau, of course. 
The Laughing Man giggles crazily. 
LIBRARY 
The Laughing Man, subdued for a moment, merely smiles a little, opening the door to let Kafka in first, guarding him close.  Dr. Murnau then leads the way across to his laboratory door. 
MURNAU May I ask where your two warders are? 
KAFKA Lying in the gutter where they belong. 
Murnau laughs, but then has to stop as it encourages the Laughing Man, bringing forth a mad chuckle or two from him. 
MURNAU Pity.  They're an amusing pair, didn't you find?  Absolute innocents. 
He pushes the tall door open into his lab. 
LABORATORY 
Murnau spreads his hands proudly as they enter, displaying his amazing factory. 
MURNAU I so rarely get the chance of showing my work to anybody -- anybody capable of appreciating it, that is.  You might say I'm a student of human reaction. 
Ekman, who's seen it all before, goes to lean somewhere, bored. 
KAFKA The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you. 
MURNAU On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one. 
As if in response to that the Laughing Man convulses anew. Ekman immediately turns to a shelf for another vial and goes to give it to the Laughing Man. 
MURNAU -- I can't very well administer experimental treatments to corpses -- and if they become corpses, why, they have their uses too -- that's why speed is essential.  Living tissue, even if its owner has passed on, is our most valuable acquisition. 
The Laughing Man gulps down the potion and starts to calm down a little. 
MURNAU We've tried transfusions on our ... volunteers.  Unfortunately, far from infusing superior characteristics it's tended to make them insane -- murderous even -- a condition we've had occasion to make use of. 
THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE 
TICKING lightly away.  The clock inside the bomb-case, becoming visible as if by X-Ray, is SEEN to be a matter of minutes away from blast-off. 
THE LAB 
Murnau walks to where the elaborate distillation processes are going on.  The very section where Kafka hid the bomb. Kafka wipes his brow, quickly, conscious of Ekman staring at him.  Murnau gazes obsessively at his contraptions, his piercing eyes following the routes of the flowing chemicals. 
MURNAU -- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.

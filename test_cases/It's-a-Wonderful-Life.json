{"train": "GEORGE (frightened) Yes, sir, I... \nGower starts hitting George about the head with his open hands.  George tries to protect himself as best he can. \nGOWER What kind of tricks are you playing, anyway? Why didn't you deliver them right away? Don't you know that boy's very sick? \nGEORGE (in tears) You're hurting my sore ear. \nINT. FRONT ROOM DRUGSTORE \u0096 DAY \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary is still seated at the soda fountain. Each time she hears George being slapped, she winces. \nINT. BACK ROOM DRUGSTORE \u0096 DAY \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND GOWER \nGOWER You lazy loafer! \nGEORGE (sobbing) Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing. You put something wrong in those capsules. I know you're unhappy. You got that telegram, and you're upset. You put something bad in those capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower... \nGeorge pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy venomously. \nGEORGE Just look and see what you did. Look at the bottle you took the powder from. It's poison!  I tell you, it's poison!  I know you feel bad... and... \nGeorge falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced on the shelf. He tears open the package, shakes the powder out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened. Gower steps toward him. \nGEORGE Don't hurt my sore ear again. \nBut this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is crying too. \nGOWER No... No... No... \nGEORGE Don't hurt my ear again! \nGOWER (sobbing) Oh, George, George... \nGEORGE Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't. \nGOWER Oh, George. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LUGGAGE SHOP \u0096 DAY \u0096 (1928) \nMEDIUM SHOT \nIt is late afternoon. A young man is looking over an assortment of luggage. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, the proprietor of the store \u0096 he is showing a suitcase. \nJOE An overnight bag \u0096 genuine English cowhide, combination lock, fitted up with brushes, combs... \nCUSTOMER Nope. \nAS CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to him, he turns and we get our first glimpse of George as a young man. CAMERA HAS MOVED UP to a CLOSEUP by now. \nGEORGE Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look, Joe.  Now, look, I... I want a big one. \nSuddenly, in action, as George stands with his arms outstretched in illustration, the picture freezes and becomes a still. Over this hold-frame shot we hear the voices from Heaven: \nCLARENCE'S VOICE What did you stop it for? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE I want you to take a good look at that face. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Who is it? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE George Bailey. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE That's the kid. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Not a soul. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Well, wait and see. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 THE SCREEN \nThe arrested CLOSEUP of George springs to life again. \nGEORGE Big - see!  I don't want one for one night.  I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand... a great big one. \nJOE I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second- hand job, would you? \nHe brings a large suitcase up from under the counter. \nGEORGE Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost? \nJOE No charge. \nGEORGE That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge. \nJOE (indicating name on suitcase) That's right. \nGEORGE (as he sees his name) What's my name doing on it? \nJOE A little present from old man Gower. Came down and picked it out himself. \nGEORGE (admiring the bag) He did? Whatta you know about that \u0096 my old boss... \nJOE What boat you sailing on? \nGEORGE I'm working across on a cattle boat. \nJOE A cattle boat? \nGEORGE (as he exits) Okay, I like cows. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. GOWER'S DRUGSTORE \u0096 DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT \nThe place is practically the same except that it is now full of school kids having sodas, etc. A juke box and many little tables have been added. It has become the hangout of the local small fry.  There are now three kids jerking sodas. Gower is a different man now \u0096 sober, shaven and good-humored. He is behind the counter when George comes in. Gower's face lights up when he sees George. \nGEORGE Mr. Gower... Mr. Gower... thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted. \nGOWER Aw, forget it. \nGEORGE Oh, it's wonderful. \nGOWER Hope you enjoy it. \nGeorge suddenly sees the old cigar lighter on the counter. He closes his eyes and makes a wish. \nMOTHER Oh, my lands, my blood pressure! \nCLOSE SHOT \nHarry, as he sticks his head through the kitchen door. \nHARRY Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things. \nMOTHER What plates? \nHARRY Oh, Mom \u0096 I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen. \nMOTHER Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland. \nShe follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George. As she goes: \nGEORGE Oh, let him have the plates, Mother. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and his father, eating at the table. There is a great similarity and a great understanding between them. \nPOP Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you. \nGEORGE I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired. \nPOP Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today. \nGEORGE Oh... \nPOP I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit. \nGEORGE I wonder what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway? \nPOP Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick.  Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nThe dining room. Harry and his mother come out of the kitchen, Harry carrying a pie in each hand and balancing one on his head.  CAMERA PANS WITH them as they cross. \nHARRY Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop. \nPOP So long, son. \nGEORGE Got a match? \nHARRY Very funny. Very funny. \nMOTHER Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together. \nHARRY Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George? \nGEORGE What do you mean, and be bored to death? \nHARRY Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too. \nGEORGE I hope it works. \nPOP No gin tonight, son. \nHARRY Aw, Pop, just a little. \nPOP No, son, not one drop. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and Pop at the table. Annie comes in with some dishes. \nANNIE Boys and girls and music. Why do they need gin? \nShe exits. \nGEORGE Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school? \nPOP Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night. \nGEORGE We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go. \nPOP He's pretty young for that job. \nGEORGE Well, no younger than I was. \nPOP Maybe you were born older, George. \nGEORGE How's that? \nPOP I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college. \nGEORGE Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about \u0096 build things... design new buildings \u0096 plan modern cities \u0096 all that stuff I was talking about. \nPOP Still after that first million before you're thirty. \nGEORGE No, I'll settle for half that in cash. \nAnnie comes in again from the kitchen. \nPOP Of course, it's just a hope, but you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you? \nAnnie stops serving to hear his answer. \nGEORGE Well, I... (to Annie) Annie, why don't you draw up a chair? Then you'd be more comfortable and you could hear everything that's going on. \nANNIE I would if I thought I'd hear anything worth listening to. \nGEORGE You would, huh? \nShe gives George a look, and goes on out into the kitchen. Bailey smiles and turns to George. \nPOP I know it's soon to talk about it. \nGEORGE Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office. \nHe stops, realizing that he has hurt his father. \nGEORGE Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that remark, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe... I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important. \nPOP (quietly) You know, George, I feel that in a small way we are doing something important.  Satisfying a fundamental urge. It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace, and we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office. \nGEORGE (unhappily) I know, Dad. I wish I felt... But I've been hoarding pennies like a miser in order to... Most of my friends have already finished college. I just feel like if I don't get away, I'd bust. \nPOP Yes... Yes... You're right, son. \nGEORGE You see what I mean, don't you, Pop? \nPOP This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here. \nGEORGE Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy. \nTo cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door and calls: \nFREDDIE'S VOICE ...but I couldn't find out. Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was because they'd be scared. They know... \nMEDIUM CLOSEUP \nMary and Freddie. Marty comes into scene, followed by George. \nFREDDIE ...what kind of... \nMARTY (interrupting) You remember George? This is Mary. Well, I'll be seeing you. \nGEORGE Well... Well... Well... \nFREDDIE Now, to get back to my story, see... \nMary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start dancing. \nFREDDIE Hey, this is my dance! \nGEORGE Oh, why don't you stop annoying people? \nFREDDIE Well, I'm sorry. Hey! \nMOVING SHOT \nFollowing George and Mary as they dance. \nGEORGE Well, hello. \nMARY Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me. \nGEORGE Well, I don't. \nMARY You've passed me on the street almost every day. \nGEORGE Me? \nMARY Uh-huh. \nGEORGE Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you. \nA WHISTLE is heard offscreen, and the MUSIC stops. \nCLOSE SHOT \nHarry on the orchestra platform, whistle in hand. \nHARRY Oyez \u0096 oyez \u0096 oyez... The big Charleston contest. The prize? A genuine loving cup.  Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor. Let's go! \nCLOSEUP \u0096 GEORGE AND MARY \nAs the MUSIC starts and couples begin dancing once more, they look at each other. \nGEORGE I'm not very good at this. \nMARY Neither am I. \nGEORGE Okay \u0096 what can we lose? \nThey start their Charleston. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad. \nCLOSEUP \u0096 FREDDIE \nLeaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking daggers at George. Mickey, a young punk who has had one too many, is beside him. \nMICKEY What's the matter, Othello \u0096 jealous? Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor? And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up?  And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack?  And I've got the key? \nFreddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool.  George and Mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. Spotlights concentrate on them. They mistake the screams for cheers. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and Mary dancing. \nGEORGE They're cheering us. We must be good. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nThe crowd watching George and Mary dancing. They move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below. \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nGeorge and Mary still trying to dance in the water \u0096 the crowd on the edge cheering them \u0096 some of the crowd leap into the pool \u0096 the principal trying to restore order, finally clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. TREE-LINED RESIDENTIAL STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and Mary. The night is warm with a bright moon. George is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bath robe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera we hear them singing: \nGEORGE AND MARY (singing) Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight.  Can't you come out tonight. Can't you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon. \nGEORGE Hot dog! Just like an organ. \nMARY Beautiful. \nCAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street. \nGEORGE And I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death. You should have seen the commotion in that locker room. I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here. Here, let me hold that old wet dress of yours. \nHe takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look at each other. \nMARY Do I look as funny as you do? \nGEORGE I guess I'm not quite the football type.  You... look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town. \nMARY Well, why don't you say it? \nGEORGE I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway? \nMARY Eighteen. \nGEORGE Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen. \nMARY Too young or too old? \nGEORGE Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you.  Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on. \nMary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly on: \nGEORGE I mean, without a dress. You look older...  I mean, younger. You look just... \nIn his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's bath robe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers the robe around her. \nGEORGE Oh-oh... \nMARY (holding out her hand) Sir, my train, please. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND MARY \nGEORGE Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come on back out here, and I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you... \nMary runs off scene. George has been once more standing on the belt of her bath robe, so as she goes, her robe comes off. \nGEORGE (looking around) Mary... \nHe drops his bundle of clothes and picks up Mary's robe. He cannot see her anywhere. \nGEORGE Okay, I give up. Where are you? \nCLOSEUP \u0096 BUSH AT EDGE OF SIDEWALK \nWe see Mary's face peering out from the leaves. \nMARY Over here in the hydrangea bushes. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND MARY \nGeorge walks toward the bush. \nGEORGE Here you are. Catch. \nHe is about to throw her the robe, when a thought strikes him. \nGEORGE Wait a minute. What am I doing? This is a very interesting situation. \nMARY (from the bushes) Please give me my robe. \nGEORGE Hmm... A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day. \nMARY (impatiently) I'd like to have my robe. \nGEORGE Not in Bedford Falls, anyway. \nMary thrashes around in the bushes. We hear her say: \nMARY Ouch! \nGEORGE Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here. \nMARY (getting mad) George Bailey! Give me my robe! \nGEORGE I've heard about things like this, but I've never... \nMARY (interrupting) Shame on you. I'm going to tell your mother on you. \nGEORGE Oh, my mother's way up the corner there. \nMARY (desperate) I'll call the police. \nGEORGE They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too. \nMARY I'm going to scream! \nGEORGE (thoughtfully) Maybe I could sell tickets. Let's see. No, the point is, in order to get this robe...  I've got it! I'll make a deal with you, Mary. \nHeadlights flash into the scene, and the old Bailey automobile drives in, with Harry at the wheel, and Uncle Billy beside him. \nUNCLE BILLY George! George! Come on home, quick! Your father's had a stroke! \nGeorge throws Mary's robe over the bush and gets into the car. \nGEORGE Mary... Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go. \nHARRY Come on, George, let's hurry. \nGEORGE Did you get a doctor? \nUNCLE BILLY Yes, Campbell's there now. \nCLOSEUP \u0096 THE HYDRANGEA BUSH \nAs the car drives off, Mary, now wearing the robe, rises up from the bush and follows the car with her eyes. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN SIGN OVER ENTRANCE \nINT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN OFFICE \u0096 DAY \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 DIRECTORS MEETING \nThere are about twelve directors seated around a long table. They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr. Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate salesman, etc.  Prominently seated among them is Henry F. Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on which they have been reporting.  Before each of the directors there are individual reports for them to study. \nDR. CAMPBELL I think that's all we'll need you for, George. I know you're anxious to make a train. \nGEORGE (rising) I have a taxi waiting downstairs. \nDR. CAMPBELL I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months.  Good luck to you at school, George. \nGEORGE Thanks. \nDR. CAMPBELL Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting \u0096 to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey. \nPOTTER Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my real purpose. \nMAN Wait just a minute now. \nPOTTER Wait for what?  I claim this institution is not necessary to this town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver. \nUNCLE BILLY (angrily) George, you hear what that buzzard... \nLAWYER Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to discuss chloroforming the Building and Loan. \nMAN Peter Bailey died three months ago. I second Mr. Potter's motion. \nDR. CAMPBELL Very well. In that case I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw. \nDr. Campbell rises from his seat. George and Uncle Billy start to collect their papers and leave the table. \nDR. CAMPBELL But before you go, I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey. \nGEORGE Thank you very much. \nDR. CAMPBELL It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization. \nPOTTER I'll go further than that. I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan. \nEveryone looks at him surprised. \nUNCLE BILLY (trying to control himself) Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave. \nPOTTER Peter Bailey was not a business man. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.  He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town. (picking up papers from table) Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop... You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi.  You know... I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why? \nGeorge is at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave. \nGEORGE She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go. \nHARRY Oh, wait. Wait... Wait a minute. \nCLOSE SHOT \nThe group, including Ruth Dakin. This is the young lady who came off the train with Harry. In the excitement of greetings she has been momentarily forgotten. She stands, smiling, waiting. \nGEORGE Hello. \nUNCLE BILLY How do you do. \nHARRY Ruth Dakin. \nRUTH Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind. \nGeorge and Uncle Billy stare, astounded. \nUNCLE BILLY Huh? \nHARRY Well, I wired you I had a surprise. Here she is. Meet the wife. \nGeorge is thunderstruck. He takes Ruth's hand. \nUNCLE BILLY Well, what do you know \u0096 wife. \nGEORGE Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing? \nHe kisses Ruth.  CAMERA MOVES WITH them down the platform. \nGEORGE Harry, why didn't you tell somebody? (to Ruth) What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine? \nRUTH (smiling) Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary. My father offered him a job. \nGeorge stops, with a sinking feeling. Uncle Billy and Ruth continue out of shot. Harry stops with George. \nUNCLE BILLY (as he moves off) Oh, he gets you and a job? Well, Harry's cup runneth over. \nHARRY George... about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. I never said I'd take it. You've been holding the bag here for four years, and... well, I won't let you down, George.  I would like to... Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags. I'll be right back. \nHe runs out of the shot, George watching him. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth. He is thinking deeply. \nUNCLE BILLY'S VOICE It was a surprise to me. This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife. Old, old friend of the family. \nRUTH'S VOICE Oh, of course. I've heard him speak of you. \nUNCLE BILLY'S VOICE And I want to tell you, we're going to give the biggest party this town ever saw. \nCAMERA MOVES WITH George as he comes into the scene. Ruth detaches herself from the group and offers George some popcorn. \nRUTH (to George) Here, have some popcorn. George, George, George... that's all Harry ever talks about. \nGEORGE (quietly) Ruth, this... what about this job? \nRUTH Oh, well, my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo. He wants to get Harry started in the research business. \nGEORGE Is it a good job? \nRUTH Oh, yes, very. Not much money, but a good future, you know. Harry's a genius at research. My father fell in love with him. \nGEORGE And you did, too? \nRuth nods, smiling. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. FRONT PORCH \u0096 BAILEY HOME \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nCousin Eustace is taking a photograph of the family group assembled on the porch. Flash bulbs go off, and the group breaks up. The crowd enters the front door of the house, leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND UNCLE BILLY \nThe latter is tipsy. He feels very high. \nUNCLE BILLY Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy. I feel so good I could spit in Potter's eye. I think I will. What did you say, huh? Oh, maybe I'd better go home. \nHe looks around for his hat, which is on his head. \nUNCLE BILLY Where's my hat? Where's my... \nGeorge takes the hat from Uncle Billy's head and hands it to him. \nUNCLE BILLY Oh, thank you, George. Which one is mine? \nGEORGE (laughing) The middle one. \nUNCLE BILLY Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy.  Now, look \u0096 if you'll point me in the right direction... would you do that?  George? \nGEORGE Right down here. \nThey descend the porch steps, and George turns his uncle around and heads him down the street. \nUNCLE BILLY Old Building and Loan pal, huh... \nGEORGE Now you just turn this way and go right straight down. \nUNCLE BILLY That way, huh? \nHe staggers out of the scene, and as George turns away, we hear Uncle Billy singing \"My Wild Irish Rose.\" There is a CRASH of cans and bottles, then: \nUNCLE BILLY'S VOICE I'm all right. I'm all right. \"... the sweetest flower that grows... \" \nEXT. HOUSE \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nGeorge is standing at the garden gate. He takes some travel folders from his pocket, looks at them and throws them away. He is obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events. His mother comes out of the house and kisses him. \nGEORGE Hello, Mom. \nMRS. BAILEY (as she kisses him) That's for nothing. How do you like her? \nShe nods toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a crowd of other couples, are dancing to the MUSIC of a phonograph, and can be seen through the front door. \nGEORGE She's swell. \nMRS. BAILEY Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes. \nGEORGE Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway. \nMRS. BAILEY Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school? \nGEORGE Uh-huh. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He stares meditatively at the simple dwelling, then he starts walking ahead.  But after a few steps he turns around and starts back. He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts back again. \nINT. BEDROOM WINDOW \u0096 HATCH HOME \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary is looking out the window, watching George walk back and forth. \nMARY What are you doing, picketing? \nGeorge stops, startled, and looks up. \nGEORGE Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by. \nMARY Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind? \nGEORGE How's that? \nMARY Have you made up your mind? \nGEORGE About what? \nMARY About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit. \nEXT. STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM LONG SHOT \nGeorge looks surprised at this. \nGEORGE My mother just called you? Well, how did she know? \nMARY Didn't you tell her? \nGEORGE I didn't tell anybody.

HATCH HOME \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nMary is running down the stairs. \nMARY (calling off) I'll be downstairs, mother. \nMRS. HATCH'S VOICE All right, dear. \nMary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes her hair. She is plainly excited at George's visit. She runs into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel. \nINSERT: THE SKETCH \nIt is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the moon.  Lettering on the drawing says: \"George Lassos The Moon.\" \nBACK TO SHOT \nMary runs into the hall, opens the phonograph and puts on a record of \"Buffalo Gals.\"  Then she opens the front door and stands there waiting for George. \nINT. DOORWAY \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nGeorge is struggling with the gate \u0096 he finally kicks it open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary. \nMARY Well, are you coming in or aren't you? \nGEORGE Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary and George are in the entrance hall. \nGEORGE When did you get back? \nMARY Tuesday. \nGEORGE Where'd you get that dress? \nMARY Do you like it? \nGEORGE It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them. \nMARY Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know... I guess I was homesick. \nGEORGE (shocked) Homesick? For Bedford Falls? \nMARY Yes, and my family and... oh, everything.  Would you like to sit down? \nThey go through the doorway into the parlor. \nGEORGE All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here. \nMARY Would you rather leave? \nGEORGE No, I don't want to be rude. \nMARY Well, then, sit down. \nGeorge sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a close look at it. \nGEORGE (indicating cartoon) Some joke, huh? \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and Mary sitting on the divan. He is uncomfortable, and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive. \nGEORGE Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here. \nMARY Thank you. \nThere is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing with the phonograph record which has been playing all through the above scene: \nMARY (singing) \"And dance by the light...\" \nGEORGE What's the matter? Oh, yeah... yeah... \nHe looks at his watch, as though about to leave. \nGEORGE Well, I... \nMARY (desperately) It was nice about your brother Harry, and Ruth, wasn't it? \nGEORGE Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right. \nSAM'S VOICE I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich.

Yeah. \nSAM'S VOICE Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that? \nMary is watching George interestedly. George is very conscious of her, close to him. \nGEORGE Rochester? Well, why Rochester? \nSAM'S VOICE Well, why not? Can you think of anything better? \nGEORGE Oh, I don't know... why not right here?  You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down. \nSAM'S VOICE That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen.  Have you got any money? \nGEORGE Money? Yeah... well, a little. \nSAM'S VOICE Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear?  And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary...  Mary... \nMARY (nervously) I'm here. \nSAM'S VOICE Would you tell that guy I'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, you hear? The chance of a lifetime. \nAs Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost on his lips. \nMARY (whispering) He says it's the chance of a lifetime. \nGeorge can stand it no longer. He drops the phone with a crash, grabs Mary by the shoulders and shakes her. Mary begins to cry. \nGEORGE (fiercely) Now you listen to me! I don't want any plastics! I don't want any ground floors, and I don't want to get married \u0096 ever \u0096 to anyone! You understand that? I want to do what I want to do.

People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors. There is a din of conversation. Mary and George appear at the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs. Hatch, red-eyed, behind them. Mary throws her bouquet, which is caught by Violet Bick. As they come out onto the porch, we see that it is raining.  Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the group.

Let's go! \nGeorge gets out of the cab and looks down the street. \nGEORGE Just a minute, dear.

We don't need Potter over here. \nMary and Ernie have come into the room during this scene. Mary stands watching silently. \nCHARLIE I'll take mine now. \nGEORGE No, but you... you... you're thinking of this place all wrong. As if I had the money back in a safe. The money's not here. Your money's in Joe's house... (to one of the men) ...right next to yours. And in the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin's house, and a hundred others. Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're going to pay it back to you as best they can. Now what are you going to do?

Now give us sixty days on this. \nTOM (turning to Randall) Okay, Randall. \nHe starts out. \nMRS. THOMPSON Are you going to go to Potter's? \nTOM Better to get half than nothing. \nA few other people start for the door.  CAMERA PANS WITH George as he vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to the people. \nGEORGE Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now listen... now listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank.  He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now he's after us.  Why? Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.  And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides. \nThe people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make an impression on them. \nGEORGE Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack? (to Ed) Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, and you couldn't make your payments. You didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would have let you keep it? (turns to address the room again) Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying! And why? Because we're panicky and he's not.  That's why. He's picking up some bargains.  Now, we can get through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other. \nMRS. THOMPSON But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and I need money. \nWOMAN How am I going to live until the bank opens? \nMAN I got doctor bills to pay. \nMAN I need cash. \nMAN Can't feed my kids on faith. \nDuring this scene Mary has come up behind the counter. Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out \nMARY How much do you need? \nGeorge jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary. \nGEORGE Hey! I got two thousand dollars! Here's two thousand dollars. This'll tide us over until the bank reopen. (to Tom) All right, Tom, how much do you need? \nTOM (doggedly) Two hundred and forty-two dollars! \nGEORGE (pleading) Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you over till the bank reopens. \nTOM I'll take two hundred and forty-two dollars. \nGeorge starts rapidly to count out the money. Tom throws his passbook on the counter. \nGEORGE There you are. \nTOM That'll close my account. \nGEORGE Your account's still here. That's a loan. \nMary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie. George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom, and speaks to Ed, the next in line. \nGEORGE Okay. All right, Ed? \nED I got three hundred dollars here, George. \nUncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash he's got. \nGEORGE Aw, now, Ed... what'll it take till the bank reopens? What do you need? \nED Well, I suppose twenty dollars. \nGEORGE Twenty dollars. Now you're talking. Fine.  Thanks, Ed. (to Mrs. Thompson, next in line) All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How much do you want? \nMRS. THOMPSON But it's your own money, George. \nGEORGE Never mind about that. How much do you want? \nMRS. THOMPSON I can get along with twenty, all right. \nGEORGE (counting it out) Twenty dollars. \nMRS. THOMPSON And I'll sign a paper. \nGEORGE You don't have to sign anything. I know you'll pay it back when you can. That's okay. (to woman next in line) All right, Mrs. Davis. \nMRS. DAVIS Could I have seventeen-fifty? \nGEORGE Seven... (he kisses her) Bless your heart, Of course you can have it. You got fifty cents? (counting) Seven... \nWIPE TO: \nINT.

Uncle Billy is seated behind the desk, his head on his hands. \nGEORGE And did you put the envelope in your pocket? \nUNCLE BILLY Yeah... yeah... maybe... maybe... \nGEORGE (shouts) Maybe \u0096 maybe! I don't want any maybe. Uncle Billy, we've got to find that money! \nUNCLE BILLY (piteously) I'm no good to you, George. I... \nGEORGE Listen to me. Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house? Someplace you could have put it? Someplace to hide the money? \nUNCLE BILLY (exhausted) I've been over the whole house, even in rooms that have been locked ever since I lost Laura. \nUncle Billy starts sobbing hysterically. George grabs him by the lapels and shakes him. \nGEORGE (harshly) Listen to me! Listen to me! Think! Think! \nUNCLE BILLY (sobbing) I can't think any more, George. I can't think any more. It hurts... \nGeorge jerks him to his feet and shakes him. Uncle Billy stands before him like a frisked criminal, all his pockets hanging out, empty. George's eyes and manner are almost maniacal. \nGEORGE (screaming at him) Where's that money, you stupid, silly old fool? Where's the money?  Do you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal, and prison! \nHe throws Uncle Billy down into his chair, and still shouts at him: \nGEORGE That's what it means! One of us is going to jail! Well, it's not going to be me! \nGeorge turns and heads for the door, kicking viciously at a waste basket on the floor as he goes. Uncle Billy remains sobbing at the table, his head in his arms. \nMARY (worried) George, what's wrong? \nGEORGE Wrong? Everything's wrong! You call this a happy family? Why did we have to have all these kids? \nPETE (coming in) Dad, how do you spell \"frankincense\"? \nGEORGE (shouts) I don't know. Ask your mother. \nGeorge goes toward doorway. \nMARY Where're you going? \nGEORGE Going up to see Zuzu. \nWe hear his footsteps as he leaves. Mary looks after him, puzzled and concerned, then comes over to Pete. \nPETE He told me to write a play for tonight. \nMARY F-R-A-N-K-I-N... \nINT. HALL \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE STARTS UP THE STAIRS \nThe knob on the banister comes off in his hand, and for a moment he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room. Then, he replaces the knob, and goes on up the stairs. \nINT. ZUZU'S BEDROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nFULL SHOT \nThe SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same monotonous rhythm over and over. Zuzu (aged six) is sitting up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her. She is holding her prize flower.  George tiptoes in. Then, as he sees she's awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed. \nZUZU Hi, Daddy. \nGEORGE Well, what happened to you? \nZUZU I won a flower. \nShe starts to get out of bed. \nGEORGE Wait now. Where do you think you're going? \nZUZU Want to give my flower a drink. \nGEORGE All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink. \nShe shakes her head and presses the flower to her. A few petals fall off. She picks them up. \nZUZU Look, Daddy... paste it. \nGEORGE Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together. \nShe hands him the fallen petals and the flower. He turns his back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. He sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the flower, and then turns back to Zuzu. \nGEORGE There it is, good as new. \nZUZU Give the flower a drink. \nGeorge puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed. \nGEORGE Now, will you do something for me? \nCLOSEUP \u0096 GEORGE AND ZUZU \nThey whisper. \nZUZU What? \nGEORGE Will you try to get some sleep? \nZUZU I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower. \nGEORGE I know \u0096 I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden. \nZUZU It will? \nGEORGE Uh-huh. \nShe closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed. George pulls the covers over her. He bends down and his lips touch a tendril of the child's hair. Then he gets up and tiptoes out of the room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nJanie is still pounding with grim determination at the piano. Pete is seated at the table writing. Tommy is playing with his toy vacuum cleaner. The telephone rings. \nJANIE AND PETE Telephone. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary comes in and picks up the phone. \nMARY I'll get it. (on phone) Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey. \nGeorge enters shot, and stands listening to her. \nMARY Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I'm sure she'll be all right. The doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner. \nGEORGE Is that Zuzu's teacher? \nMARY (hand over receiver) Yes. \nGEORGE Let me speak to her. \nHe snatches the phone from Mary. \nGEORGE (on phone) Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?  This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father. Say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway?  What do you mean sending her home like that, halfnaked?  Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you? \nMARY (shocked) George! \nShe puts a restraining hand on his arm. He shakes it off. She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is really a tirade against the world, against life itself, against God. Over the phone we hear Mrs. Welch's voice sputtering with protest. \nGEORGE Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for \u0096 to have teachers like you? Silly, stupid, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on? You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe they don't have any decent clothes... \nMary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand. \nGEORGE Aw, that stupid... \nMary speaks quickly in to the phone. \nMARY Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...  hello... hello... (to George) She's hung up. \nGEORGE (savagely) I'll hang her up! \nBut the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling: \nMR. WELCH'S VOICE Now, who do you think you are? \nGEORGE I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings. \nCLARENCE Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you? \nGEORGE (humoring him) Sure, sure. How? \nCLARENCE By letting me help you. \nGEORGE Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you? \nCLARENCE Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven. \nGEORGE Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub. \nCLARENCE Oh, tut, tut, tut. \nGEORGE I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive. \nCLARENCE Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you... \nGEORGE (interrupts) Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off. My wife, and my kids and my friends. (annoyed with Clarence) Look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you? \nCLARENCE No, you don't understand. I've got my job... \nGEORGE (savagely) Aw, shut up, will you. \nClarence is not getting far with George. He glances up, paces across the room, thoughtfully. \nCLARENCE (to himself) Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy. (to George) So you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh? \nGEORGE (dejectedly) Oh, I don't know. I guess you're right. I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at all. \nCLARENCE What'd you say? \nGEORGE I said I wish I'd never been born. \nCLARENCE Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You... (gets an idea) ...wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea. (glances up toward Heaven) What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it.  All right. (to George) You've got your wish. You've never been born. \nAs Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the door to the shack. Clarence runs to close the door. \nCLARENCE (looking upward) You don't have to make all that fuss about it. \nAs Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what Clarence has said. \nGEORGE What did you say? \nCLARENCE You've never been born. You don't exist.  You haven't a care in the world. \nGeorge feels his ear as Clarence talks. \nCLARENCE No worries \u0096 no obligations \u0096 no eight thousand dollars to get \u0096 no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff. \nCLOSEUP \u0096 GEORGE AND CLARENCE \nGeorge indicates his bad ear. \nGEORGE Say something else in that ear. \nCLARENCE (bending down) Sure. You can hear out of it. \nGEORGE Well, that's the doggonedest thing... I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water. \nCLARENCE Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George. \nGeorge feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut he received from Welch. He is now thoroughly confused. \nGEORGE What do you know about that... What's happened? \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT George looks around, as though to get his bearings. \nGEORGE It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here? (standing up) Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry... \nCLARENCE Our clothes are dry. \nGeorge feels the clothes on the line. \nGEORGE What do you know about that? Stove's hotter than I thought. Now, come on, get your clothes on, and we'll stroll up to my car and get... \nThey start dressing. George interrupts himself. \nGEORGE Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly. \nCLARENCE I can't fly. I haven't got any wings. \nGEORGE You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT \nThis is the same empty street where George's car swerved into the tree near the sidewalk. George and Clarence come into shot and up to the spot where George had left his car smashed against the tree. George looks around, but his car is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged. \nCLARENCE What's the matter? \nGEORGE (puzzled) Well, this is where I left my car and it isn't here. \nCLARENCE You have no car. \nGEORGE Well, I had a car, and it was right here.  I guess somebody moved it. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 AT CURB \nThe owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages under his arm. \nOWNER (politely) Good evening. \nGEORGE Oh, say... Hey... where's my car? \nOWNER I beg your pardon? \nGEORGE My car, my car. I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree. \nOWNER What tree? \nGEORGE What do you mean, what tree? This tree.  Here, I ran into it. Cut a big gash in the side of it here. \nThe owner bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then straightens up and smells George's breath. He backs away. \nOWNER You must mean two other trees. You had me worried. One of the oldest trees in Pottersville. \nGEORGE (blankly) Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford Falls. \nOWNER I mean Pottersville. (sharply) Don't you think I know where I live? What's the matter with you? \nThe owner proceeds toward his house. George is completely bewildered. \nGEORGE Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is... (to Clarence) ...or you are! \nGEORGE Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me? \nGOWER No. No. \nNICK (to his bouncers) Throw him out. Throw him out. \nThe bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes back to the bar. \nGEORGE (bewildered) Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick... Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist? \nNICK You know, that's another reason for me not to like you. That rumhead spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid. If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself. (to his bouncers) Would you show these gentlemen to the door. \nBOUNCER Sure. This way, gentlemen. \nEXT. NICK'S BAR \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and Clarence come flying through the door and land in the snow. \nINT. NICK'S BAR \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nNick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell. \nNICK Hey! Get me! I'm giving out wings! \nEXT. NICK'S BAR \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange, puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they landed, looking at each other. \nCLARENCE You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the... \nGEORGE What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly... \nGeorge catches a glimpse of the front of the building with the neon sign over the door. It now reads \"NICK'S PLACE\" instead of \"MARTINI'S.\" \nGeorge and Clarence get to their feet. \nGEORGE (exasperated) What the... hey, what's going on around here?  Why, this ought to be Martini's place. \nHe points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested look. \nGEORGE Look, who are you? \nCLARENCE (patiently) I told you, George. I'm your guardian angel. \nGeorge, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his arm.  It's flesh. \nGEORGE Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What... are you a hypnotist? \nCLARENCE No, of course not. \nGEORGE Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things? \nCLARENCE Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born. \nGEORGE Then if I wasn't born, who am I? \nCLARENCE You're nobody. You have no identity. \nGeorge rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but without success. \nGEORGE What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey. \nCLARENCE There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy... (he says these things as George searches for them) George looks in his watch pocket. \nCLARENCE They're not there, either. \nGEORGE What? \nCLARENCE Zuzu's petals. \nGeorge feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out. \nCLARENCE You've been given a great gift, George. A chance to see what the world would be like without you. \nGeorge is completely befuddled. \nGEORGE (shaking his head) Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute here. As, this is some sort of a funny dream I'm having here. So long, mister, I'm going home. \nHe starts off. Clarence rises. \nCLARENCE Home? What home? \nGEORGE (furious) Now shut up! Cut it out! You're... you're... you're crazy! That's what I think... you're screwy, and you're driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing things. I'm going home and see my wife and family. Do you understand that? And I'm going home alone! \nGeorge strides off hurriedly. Clarence slowly follows him, glancing up toward Heaven as he goes. \nCLARENCE How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks. (pause) No, I didn't have a drink! \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT \u0096 GEORGE MOVES INTO THE SCENE \nThe sign bearing the name of the town reads: \"Pottersville.\" George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and so on. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge stops before what used to be the offices of the Building and Loan.  There is a garish electric sign over the entrance reading: \"Welcome Jitterbugs.\" A crowd of people are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops: \nGEORGE Hey... hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to? \nCOP The Building and what? \nGEORGE The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there. \nCOP They went out of business years ago. \nMEDIUM CLOSEUP \nGeorge sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon. \nGEORGE Hey, Violet! (to the cop) Hey, listen \u0096 that's Violet Bick! \nCOP I know. I know. \nGEORGE I know that girl! \nThe cop shoves George to one side. He looks around and sees Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by. \nGEORGE Hey, Ernie \u0096 Ernie! \nEXT. STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nBERT Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had him right here. \nErnie's hair is now standing on end with fright. \nERNIE (stammering) I need a drink. \nHe runs out of the scene. \nBERT Well, which way'd they go? Help me find 'em. \nEXT. BAILEY HOME \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge runs up the path to the front door of the house and raps on the door. He rings the bell and taps on the glass, when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading: \"Ma Bailey's Boarding House.\" \nMEDIUM CLOSEUP \u0096 GEORGE AT THE DOOR \nThe door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs. Bailey, but she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him. \nMA BAILEY Well? \nGEORGE Mother... \nMA BAILEY Mother? What do you want? \nIt is a cruel blow to George. \nGEORGE Mother, this is George. I thought sure you'd remember me. \nMA BAILEY (coldly) George who? If you're looking for a room there's no vacancy. \nShe starts to close the door, but George stops her. \nGEORGE Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it. \nMA BAILEY Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know. \nGEORGE (desperate) Well, I know everybody you know. Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy. \nMA BAILEY (suspiciously) You know him? \nGEORGE Well, sure I do. \nMA BAILEY When'd you see him last? \nGEORGE Today, over at the house. \nMA BAILEY That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business.  And if you ask me, that's where you belong. \nShe slams the door shut in George's face. \nEXT. HOUSE \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nGeorge stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His features are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. We see Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb, holding his volume of \"Tom Sawyer\" in his hand. \nCLARENCE Strange, isn't it?  Each man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he? \nGEORGE (quietly, trying to use logic) I've heard of things like this. You've got me in some kind of a spell, or something.  Well, I'm going to get out of it. I'll get out of it. I know how, too. I... the last man I talked to before all this stuff started happening to me was Martini. \nCLARENCE You know where he lives? \nGEORGE Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park. \nThey walk out of scene. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge and Clarence approach the tree from which the \"Bailey Park\" sign once hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used to be. \nCLARENCE Are you sure this is Bailey Park? \nGEORGE Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses? \nThe two walk into the cemetery. \nCLARENCE (as they go) You weren't here to build them. \nCLOSE MOVING SHOT \nGeorge wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, Clarence trotting at his heels. Again George stops to stare with frightened eyes at: \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 A TOMBSTONE \nUpon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey. Feverishly George scrapes away the snow covering the rest of the inscription, and we read: \"IN MEMORY OF OUR BELOVED SON \u0096 HARRY BAILEY \u0096 \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND CLARENCE \nCLARENCE Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine. \nGeorge jumps up. \nGEORGE That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to war! He got the Congressional Medal of Honor! He saved the lives of every man on that transport. \nCLARENCE (sadly) Every man on that transport died. Harry wasn't there to save them because you weren't there to save Harry. You see, George, you really had a wonderful life.  Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away? \nCLOSEUP \u0096 GEORGE AND CLARENCE \nGEORGE Clarence... \nCLARENCE Yes, George? \nGEORGE Where's Mary? \nCLARENCE Oh, well, I can't... \nGEORGE I don't know how you know these things, but tell me \u0096 where is she? \nGeorge grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him. \nCLARENCE I... \nGEORGE If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is. \nCLARENCE I'm not supposed to tell. \nGEORGE (becoming violent) Please, Clarence, tell me where she is. \nCLARENCE You're not going to like it, George. \nGEORGE (shouting) Where is she? \nCLARENCE She's an old maid. She never married. \nBERT Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you.  I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe... Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right? \nGEORGE What did... \nGeorge touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth with his hand, laughs happily. His rapture knows no bounds. \nGEORGE (joyously) My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's bleed... (feeling in watch pocket) Zuzu's petals! Zuzu's... they're... they're here, Bert! What do you know about that? Merry Christmas! \nHe practically embraces the astonished Bert, then runs at top speed toward town. \nLONG SHOT George runs away from camera yelling \nGEORGE Mary! Mary! \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge's wrecked car is smashed against the tree. He comes running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, pats the car, and dashes on. \nEXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge sees that the \"POTTERSVILLE\" sign is now replaced by the original \"YOU ARE NOW IN BEDFORD FALLS\" sign. \nGEORGE Hello, Bedford Falls! \nHe turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in its original appearance. He passes some late shoppers on the street \nGEORGE Merry Christmas! \nPEOPLE (ad lib) Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, George! \nEXT. THEATRE \u0096 NIGHT \nPAN SHOT \u0096 AS GEORGE RUNS BY: \nGEORGE Merry Christmas, movie house! \nEXT.

POTTER'S OFFICE \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nPotter is seated working at his desk, his goon by his side. George pounds on the window. \nGEORGE (from outside) Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter! \nGeorge runs off as Potter looks up from his work. \nPOTTER Happy New Year to you \u0096 in jail! Go on home \u0096 they're waiting for you! \nINT. GEORGE'S HOME \u0096 NIGHT \nThe lights are on. There is a fire in the fireplace. The Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked around. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nCarter, the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and photographer, and a sheriff, are waiting in the hall for George. George comes dashing in the front door. \nGEORGE (excitedly) Mary... (sees the men) Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner! \nHe grabs his hand and shakes it. \nCARTER (surprised) Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit! \nGEORGE I know. Eight thousand dollars. \nSHERIFF (reaching into pocket) George, I've got a little paper here. \nGEORGE (happily) I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest. Isn't it wonderful? Merry Christmas! \nThe photographer sets off a flash bulb. \nGEORGE Reporters? Where's Mary? (calling) Mary! \nGeorge runs to the kitchen. He gets no answer. As he goes: \nGEORGE Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty house! Mary! Mary! \nHe comes running back to the hall. \nGEORGE Have you seen my wife? \nCHILDREN'S VOICES Merry Christmas, Daddy! Merry Christmas, Daddy! \nINT. STAIRS \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT \nThe three children are at the top of the stairs. They are in their pajamas. \nGEORGE Kids! \nGeorge starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar knob on the banister comes off in his hand. He kisses it lovingly and puts it back, then continues up the stairs. \nGEORGE Pete \u0096 kids \u0096 Janie \u0096 Tommy. (takes them in his arms) I could eat you up! \nINT. TOP OF STAIRS \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and the kids.

The streets are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over the above scenes we hear voices praying: \nGOWER'S VOICE I owe everything to George Bailey. Help him, dear Father. \nMARTINI'S VOICE Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend Mr. Bailey. \nMRS. BAILEY'S VOICE Help my son George tonight. \nBERT'S VOICE He never thinks about himself, God; that's why he's in trouble. \nERNIE'S VOICE George is a good guy. Give him a break, God. \nMARY'S VOICE I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him tonight. \nJANIE'S VOICE Please, God. Something's the matter with Daddy. \nZUZU'S VOICE Please bring Daddy back. \nCAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly: \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Hello, Joseph, trouble? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Looks like we'll have to send someone down \u0096 a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Oh \u0096 Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Yes, but he's got the faith of a child \u0096 simple. Joseph, send for Clarence. \nA small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It twinkles as Clarence speaks: \nCLARENCE'S VOICE You sent for me, sir? \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Splendid! Is he sick? \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now? \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Sir... If I should accomplish this mission \u0096 I mean \u0096 might I perhaps win my wings?  I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir \u0096 and people are beginning to talk. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE What's that book you've got there? \nCLARENCE'S VOICE The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Poor George... Sit down. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Sit down? What are... \nJOSEPH'S VOICE If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you? \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Well, naturally. Of course. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Well, keep your eyes open. See the town? \nThe stars fade out from the screen, and a light, indistinguishable blur is seen. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Where? I don't see a thing. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out.  Concentrate. Begin to see something? \nThe blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Why, yes. This is amazing. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Oh, wonderful! \nEXT. FROZEN RIVER AND HILL \u0096 DAY \u0096 CLOSE SHOT \nGroup of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill. \nBOY (as he slides) Yippee!! \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Hey, who's that? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE That's your problem, George Bailey. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE A boy? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on. \nSeries of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the hill and out onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others applaud. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge Bailey at bottom of slide. \nGEORGE (through megaphone) And here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother, Harry Bailey. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 HARRY \nOn top of hill, preparing to make his slide. \nHARRY I'm not scared. \nBOYS (ad lib) Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry! \n", "test1_true": "Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears into the water. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE \nGEORGE I'm coming, Harry. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to pull him out he yells: \nGEORGE Make a chain, gang! A chain! \nWIDER ANGLE \nThe other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain. When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they pull them both to safety. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE George saved his brother's life that day.  But he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear. Cost him his hearing in that ear. It was weeks before he could return to his after- school job at old man Gower's drugstore. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MAIN STREET \u0096 BEDFORD FALLS \u0096 SPRING AFTERNOON \nMEDIUM SHOT \nFive or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, whistling.  Their attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the street. \nMEDIUM PAN SHOT \nThe carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding in it. \nCLOSE SHOT \nThe boys watching the carriage. \nGEORGE Mr. Potter! \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Who's that \u0096 a king? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE That's Henry F. Potter, the richest and meanest man in the county. \nThe boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop: \nGEORGE So long! \nBOYS (ad lib) Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee- haw. \nINTERIOR DRUGSTORE \u0096 DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish: \nGEORGE Wish I had a million dollars. \nHe clicks the lighter and the flame springs up. \nGEORGE Hot dog! \nWIDER ANGLE \nGeorge crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch, a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get his apron from behind the fountain. \nGEORGE (calling toward back room) It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMr. Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room. We see him take a drink from a bottle. \nGOWER You're late. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge behind soda fountain. He is putting on his apron. \nGEORGE Yes, sir. \nWIDER ANGLE \nViolet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people. \nVIOLET (with warm friendliness) Hello, George. (then, flatly, as she sees Mary) 'Lo, Mary. \nMARY (primly) Hello, Violet. \nGeorge regards the two of them with manly disgust. They are two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy counter. \nGEORGE Two cents worth of shoelaces? \nVIOLET She was here first. \nMARY I'm still thinking. \nGEORGE (to Violet) Shoelaces? \nVIOLET Please, Georgie. \nGeorge goes over to the candy counter. \nVIOLET (to Mary) I like him. \nMARY You like every boy. \nVIOLET (happily) What's wrong with that? \nGEORGE Here you are. \nGeorge gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces.  Violet gives him the money. \nVIOLET (the vamp) Help me down? \nGEORGE (disgusted) Help you down! \nViolet jumps down off her stool and exits. Mary, watching, sticks out her tongue as she passes. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND MARY AT FOUNTAIN \nGEORGE Made up your mind yet? \nMARY I'll take chocolate. \nGeorge puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish. \nGEORGE With coconuts? \nMARY I don't like coconuts. \nGEORGE You don't like coconuts!  Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from?  Lookit here \u0096 from Tahiti \u0096 Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea! \n", "test1_id": 612, "test2_input": "He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her. \nMARY A new magazine! I never saw it before. \nGEORGE Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society. \nHe leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her.  She leans over, speaking softly. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary, whispering. \nMARY Is this the ear you can't hear on? George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die. \nShe draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she has said. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND MARY \nGEORGE I'm going out exploring some day, you watch. And I'm going to have a couple of harems, and maybe three or four wives.  Wait and see. \nHe turns back to the cash register, whistling. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nTaking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain. Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It is evident he has been drinking. \nGOWER George! George! \nGEORGE Yes, sir. \nGOWER You're not paid to be a canary. \nGEORGE No, sir. \nHe turns back to the cash register when he notices an open telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it. \nINSERT: THE TELEGRAM \nIt reads: \"We regret to inform you that your son, Robert, died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop. Everything possible was done for his comfort stop. We await instructions from you.  EDWARD MELLINGTON Pres. HAMMERTON COLLEGE.\" \nBACK TO SHOT \nGeorge puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward Gower. \nINT. PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE \u0096 DAY \nCLOSE SHOT \nGower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box. \nGEORGE Mr. Gower, do you want something... Anything? \nGOWER No. \nGEORGE Anything I can do back here? \nGOWER No. \nGeorge looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk.  Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor. \nCLOSE SHOT \nCapsules spilling on floor at their feet. \nBACK TO SHOT \nGeorge and Gower. \nGEORGE I'll get them, sir. \nHe picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the powder for the capsules. Its label reads \"POISON.\" George stands still, horrified. \nGOWER Take these capsules over to Mrs. Blaine's.  She's waiting for them. \nGeorge picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say.  His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. George's fingers fumble. \nGEORGE Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir? \nGOWER Ummmm... \nGower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns to him, the box in his hand. \nGEORGE Is it a charge, sir? \nGOWER Yes \u0096 charge. \nGEORGE Mr. Gower, I think... \nGOWER Aw, get going! \nGEORGE Yes, sir. \nINT. DRUGSTORE \u0096 DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge comes out into main room. As he puts on his cap he sees a Sweet Caporals ad which says: \nINSERT \n\"ASK DAD HE KNOWS\" \u0096 SWEET CAPORAL \nBACK TO SHOT \nWith an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the street. Mary follows him with her eyes. \nEXT. STREET \u0096 DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge runs down the street until he comes opposite a two- story building with a sign on it reading: \"Bailey Building and Loan Association.\" He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs. \nINT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN \u0096 DAY \nFULL SHOT \nThe offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a door marked: \n\"PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE\", George's Uncle Billy stands, obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk.  The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office. \nCLOSE SHOT \nUncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm. \nUNCLE BILLY Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'? \nGEORGE Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy. \nUNCLE BILLY Some other time, George. \n", "test2_true": "UNCLE BILLY There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm. \nDuring the foregoing, Cousin Tilly has answered the telephone, and now she calls out: \nCOUSIN TILLY Uncle Billy... telephone. \nUNCLE BILLY Who is it? \nCOUSIN TILLY Bank examiner. \nINSERT \nCLOSEUP \u0096 UNCLE BILLY'S LEFT HAND There are pieces of string tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of things he has to do. \nBACK TO SHOT \nUncle Billy looking at his hand. \nUNCLE BILLY Bank examiner!  I should have called him yesterday. Switch it inside. \nHe enters a door marked: \"WILLIAM BAILEY, PRIVATE\". George stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more keenly of his personal crisis. He opens the door of his father's office and enters. \nINT. BAILEY'S PRIVATE OFFICE \u0096 DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights.  Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for some time. \nBAILEY I'm not crying, Mr. Potter. \nPOTTER Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse. \nBAILEY All I'm asking is thirty days more... \nGEORGE (interrupting) Pop! \nBAILEY Just a minute, son. (to Potter) Just thirty short days. I'll dig up that five thousand somehow. \nPOTTER (to his goon) Shove me up... \nGoon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk. \nGEORGE Pop! \nPOTTER Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages? \nBAILEY Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work. \nPOTTER Then foreclose! \nBAILEY I can't do that. These families have children. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \u0096 POTTER AND BAILEY \nGEORGE Pop! \nPOTTER They're not my children. \nBAILEY But they're somebody's children. \nPOTTER Are you running a business or a charity ward? \nBAILEY Well, all right... \nPOTTER (interrupting) Not with my money! \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 POTTER AND BAILEY \nBAILEY Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hardskulled character? You have no family \u0096 no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got. \nPOTTER So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me. \nGeorge cannot listen any longer to such libel about his father. He comes around in front of the desk. \nGEORGE He's not a failure! You can't say that about my father! \nBAILEY George, George... \nGEORGE You're not! You're the biggest man in town! \nBAILEY Run along. \nHe pushes George toward the door. \nGEORGE Bigger'n him! \nAs George passes Potter's wheelchair he pushes the old man's shoulder. The goon puts out a restraining hand. \nGEORGE Bigger'n everybody. \nGeorge proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on his shoulder. As they go: \nPOTTER Gives you an idea of the Baileys. \nINT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN \u0096 DAY \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and his father at the door. \nGEORGE Don't let him say that about you, Pop. \nBAILEY All right, son, thanks. I'll talk to you tonight. \nBailey closes the door on George and turns back to Potter. George stands outside the door with the capsules in his hand. \nWIPE TO: \nBACK TO DRUGSTORE \nINT. BACK ROOM \u0096 GOWER'S DRUGSTORE \u0096 DAY \nCLOSE SHOT \nGower talking on the telephone. George stands in the doorway. \nGOWER (drunkenly) Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago. It'll be over in five minutes, Mrs. Blaine. \nHe hangs up the phone and turns to George. \nGOWER Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules? \nHe grabs George by the shirt and drags him into the back room. \nGEORGE Capsules... \nGOWER (shaking him) Did you hear what I said? \n", "test2_id": 613, "test3_input": "George is out of the door by now.  CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Potter. \nPOTTER (on phone) Bill? This is Potter. \nEXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nGeorge comes out of the bank into the falling snow. He crosses the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps over the door, and drives off. \nEXT. MARTINI'S BAR \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nAn attractive little roadside tavern, with the name \"Martini's\" in neon lights on the front wall. \nINT. MARTINI'S BAR \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nThe place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles sparkle.  There are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. The booths and the checkered-cloth-covered tables are full. There is an air of festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a public drinking place. George is seated at the bar \u0096 he has had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to. \nMARTINI'S VOICE (greeting new customers) Merry Christmas. Glad you came. \nMAN'S VOICE How about some of that good spaghetti? \nMARTINI'S VOICE We got everything. \nDuring this, CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to George. Nick, the bartender, is watching him solicitously. Seated on the other side of George is a burly individual, drinking a glass of beer. George is mumbling: \nGEORGE God... God... Dear Father in Heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way. I'm at the end of my rope. Show me the way, God. \nNICK (friendly) Are you all right, George? Want someone to take you home? \nGeorge shakes his head. Martini comes over to his side. \nMARTINI (worried) Why you drink so much, my friend? Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is Christmas Eve. \nThe ugly man next to George, who has been listening, reacts sharply to the name \"Bailey.\" \nMAN Bailey? Which Bailey? \nNICK This is Mr. George Bailey. \nWithout any warning, the burly man throws a vicious punch at George, who goes down and out. Martini, Nick and several others rush to pick him up. \nMAN (to George) And the next time you talk to my wife like that you'll get worse. She cried for an hour. It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write, and you have to bawl her out... \nMARTINI (furious) You get out of here, Mr. Welch! \nMr. Welch reaches in his pocket for money. \nWELCH Now wait... I want to pay for my drink. \nMARTINI Never mind the money. You get out of here quick. \nWELCH All right. \nMARTINI You hit my best friend. Get out! \nNick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding. \nNICK You all right, George? \nGEORGE (stunned) Who was that? \nMARTINI He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch.  He don't come in to my place no more. \nGEORGE Oh \u0096 Welch. That's what I get for praying. \nMARTINI The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick? \nNICK Yes, you bet. \nGEORGE Where's my insurance policy? (finds it in pocket) Oh, here... \nHe starts for the door. \nMARTINI Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey. \nGEORGE I'm all right. \nNick and Martini try to stop him, but he shrugs them off. \nMARTINI Oh, no \u0096 you don't feel so good. \nGEORGE I'm all right. \nMARTINI Please don't go away \u0096 please! \nGeorge opens the door and exits to the street. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge's car comes along the empty street, through the falling snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house.  George gets out to look at the damage, and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running out. \nOWNER What do you think you're doing? \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident. The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George stands dully looking at the damage. The owner comes up, looking at his tree. He leans over to examine the damages. \nOWNER (with indignation) Now look what you did. My greatgrandfather planted this tree. \nGeorge staggers off down the street, paying no attention to the man. \nOWNER Hey, you... Hey, you! Come back here, you drunken fool! Get this car out of here! \nEXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM LONG SHOT \nGeorge is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck swings around the corner and nearly hits him. \nDRIVER Hey, what's the matter with you? Look where you're going! \nThe truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow catwalk at the railing. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge. The snow is now falling hard. \nEXT. RIVER \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \n", "test3_true": "EXT. BRIDGE AT RAILING \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSEUP \u0096 GEORGE \nHe stares down at the water, desperate, trying to make up his mind to act. He leans over looking at the water, fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as though about to jump. \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nFrom above George a body hurtles past and lands in the water with a loud splash. George looks down, horrified. \nVOICE (from river) Help! Help! \nGeorge quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing into the water. \nCLOSER ANGLE \nGeorge comes up, sees the man flailing about in the water, and CAMERA PANS WITH him as he swims toward the man. \nMAN Help! Help! Help! \nEXT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nThe toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines on the two figures struggling in the water below. \nEXT. RIVER \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nThe man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice we have heard speaking from Heaven. George reaches him, grabs hold of him, and starts swimming for shore. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT \u0096 GEORGE, CLARENCE, AND THE TOLLKEEPER \nGeorge is seated before a wood-burning stove before which his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winter underwear.  He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night shirt \u0096 with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  The tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or says.  Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing the tollkeeper. \nCLARENCE I didn't have time to get some stylish underwear. My wife gave me this on my last birthday. I passed away in it. \nThe tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's attention, now picks up a copy of \"Tom Sawyer\" which is hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book. \nCLARENCE Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too. You should read the new book Mark Twain's writing now. \nThe tollkeeper stares at him incredulously. \nTOLLKEEPER How'd you happen to fall in? \nCLARENCE I didn't fall in. I jumped in to save George. \nGeorge looks up, surprised. \nGEORGE You what? To save me? \nCLARENCE Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you? \nGEORGE Go through with what? \nCLARENCE Suicide. \nGeorge and the tollkeeper react to this. \nTOLLKEEPER It's against the law to commit suicide around here. \nCLARENCE Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too. \nTOLLKEEPER Where do you come from? \nHe leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's next statement. \nCLARENCE Heaven. (to George) I had to act quickly; that's why I jumped in. I knew if I were drowning you'd try to save me. And you see, you did, and that's how I saved you. \nThe tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George casually looks at the strange smiling little man a second time. \nGEORGE (offhand) Very funny. \nCLARENCE Your lip's bleeding, George. \nGeorge's hand goes to his mouth. \nGEORGE Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago. \nCLARENCE (comes around to George) Oh, no \u0096 no \u0096 no. I'm the answer to your prayer. That's why I was sent down here. \nGEORGE (casually interested) How do you know my name? \nCLARENCE Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy. \nGEORGE What are you, a mind reader or something? \nCLARENCE Oh, no. \nGEORGE Well, who are you, then? \nCLARENCE Clarence Odbody, A-S-2. \nGEORGE Odbody... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2? \nCLARENCE Angel, Second Class. \nThe tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash. He has been leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on two legs.  Tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the door. From his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest cop. \nCLARENCE (to tollkeeper) Cheerio, my good man. \nGeorge rubs his head with his hand, to clear his mind. \nGEORGE Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini put in those drinks? \nHe looks up at Clarence standing beside him. \nGEORGE Hey, what's with you? What did you say just a minute ago? Why'd you want to save me? \nCLARENCE That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel. \nGEORGE I wouldn't be a bit surprised. \nCLARENCE Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars. \nGEORGE (bewildered) Yeah... just things like that. Now how'd you know that? \nCLARENCE I told you \u0096 I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you. \nGEORGE Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings? \nCLARENCE I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class. \n", "test3_id": 614}

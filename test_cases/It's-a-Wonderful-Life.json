{"test1_input": "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE \n\"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE\" \nBy \nFrances Goodrich \nAlbert Hackett \nFrank Capra \nJo Swerling \nFADE IN: \nNIGHT SEQUENCE \nSeries of shots of various streets and buildings in the town of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over the above scenes we hear voices praying: \nGOWER'S VOICE I owe everything to George Bailey. Help him, dear Father. \nMARTINI'S VOICE Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend Mr. Bailey. \nMRS. BAILEY'S VOICE Help my son George tonight. \nBERT'S VOICE He never thinks about himself, God; that's why he's in trouble. \nERNIE'S VOICE George is a good guy. Give him a break, God. \nMARY'S VOICE I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him tonight. \nJANIE'S VOICE Please, God. Something's the matter with Daddy. \nZUZU'S VOICE Please bring Daddy back. \nCAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly: \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Hello, Joseph, trouble? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Looks like we'll have to send someone down \u0096 a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Oh \u0096 Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Yes, but he's got the faith of a child \u0096 simple. Joseph, send for Clarence. \nA small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It twinkles as Clarence speaks: \nCLARENCE'S VOICE You sent for me, sir? \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Splendid! Is he sick? \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now? \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Sir... If I should accomplish this mission \u0096 I mean \u0096 might I perhaps win my wings?  I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir \u0096 and people are beginning to talk. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE What's that book you've got there? \nCLARENCE'S VOICE The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. \nFRANKLIN'S VOICE Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Poor George... Sit down. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Sit down? What are... \nJOSEPH'S VOICE If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you? \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Well, naturally. Of course. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Well, keep your eyes open. See the town? \nThe stars fade out from the screen, and a light, indistinguishable blur is seen. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Where? I don't see a thing. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out.  Concentrate. Begin to see something? \nThe blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Why, yes. This is amazing. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Oh, wonderful! \nEXT. FROZEN RIVER AND HILL \u0096 DAY \u0096 CLOSE SHOT \nGroup of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill. \nBOY (as he slides) Yippee!! \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Hey, who's that? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE That's your problem, George Bailey. \nCLARENCE'S VOICE A boy? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on. \nSeries of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the hill and out onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others applaud. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge Bailey at bottom of slide. \nGEORGE (through megaphone) And here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother, Harry Bailey. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 HARRY \nOn top of hill, preparing to make his slide. \nHARRY I'm not scared. \nBOYS (ad lib) Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry! \n", "test1_true": "Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears into the water. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE \nGEORGE I'm coming, Harry. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to pull him out he yells: \nGEORGE Make a chain, gang! A chain! \nWIDER ANGLE \nThe other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain. When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they pull them both to safety. \nJOSEPH'S VOICE George saved his brother's life that day.  But he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear. Cost him his hearing in that ear. It was weeks before he could return to his after- school job at old man Gower's drugstore. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MAIN STREET \u0096 BEDFORD FALLS \u0096 SPRING AFTERNOON \nMEDIUM SHOT \nFive or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, whistling.  Their attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the street. \nMEDIUM PAN SHOT \nThe carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding in it. \nCLOSE SHOT \nThe boys watching the carriage. \nGEORGE Mr. Potter! \nCLARENCE'S VOICE Who's that \u0096 a king? \nJOSEPH'S VOICE That's Henry F. Potter, the richest and meanest man in the county. \nThe boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop: \nGEORGE So long! \nBOYS (ad lib) Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee- haw. \nINTERIOR DRUGSTORE \u0096 DAY \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish: \nGEORGE Wish I had a million dollars. \nHe clicks the lighter and the flame springs up. \nGEORGE Hot dog! \nWIDER ANGLE \nGeorge crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch, a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get his apron from behind the fountain. \nGEORGE (calling toward back room) It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMr. Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room. We see him take a drink from a bottle. \nGOWER You're late. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nGeorge behind soda fountain. He is putting on his apron. \nGEORGE Yes, sir. \nWIDER ANGLE \nViolet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people. \nVIOLET (with warm friendliness) Hello, George. (then, flatly, as she sees Mary) 'Lo, Mary. \nMARY (primly) Hello, Violet. \nGeorge regards the two of them with manly disgust. They are two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy counter. \nGEORGE Two cents worth of shoelaces? \nVIOLET She was here first. \nMARY I'm still thinking. \nGEORGE (to Violet) Shoelaces? \nVIOLET Please, Georgie. \nGeorge goes over to the candy counter. \nVIOLET (to Mary) I like him. \nMARY You like every boy. \nVIOLET (happily) What's wrong with that? \nGEORGE Here you are. \nGeorge gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces.  Violet gives him the money. \nVIOLET (the vamp) Help me down? \nGEORGE (disgusted) Help you down! \nViolet jumps down off her stool and exits. Mary, watching, sticks out her tongue as she passes. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND MARY AT FOUNTAIN \nGEORGE Made up your mind yet? \nMARY I'll take chocolate. \nGeorge puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish. \nGEORGE With coconuts? \nMARY I don't like coconuts. \nGEORGE You don't like coconuts!  Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from?  Lookit here \u0096 from Tahiti \u0096 Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea! \n", "test1_id": 612, "test2_input": "EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He stares meditatively at the simple dwelling, then he starts walking ahead.  But after a few steps he turns around and starts back. He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts back again. \nINT. BEDROOM WINDOW \u0096 HATCH HOME \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary is looking out the window, watching George walk back and forth. \nMARY What are you doing, picketing? \nGeorge stops, startled, and looks up. \nGEORGE Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by. \nMARY Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind? \nGEORGE How's that? \nMARY Have you made up your mind? \nGEORGE About what? \nMARY About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit. \nEXT. STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM LONG SHOT \nGeorge looks surprised at this. \nGEORGE My mother just called you? Well, how did she know? \nMARY Didn't you tell her? \nGEORGE I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by... \nBut Mary has disappeared from the window. \nGEORGE (to himself) What do you... went for a walk, that's all. \nINT. HATCH HOME \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nMary is running down the stairs. \nMARY (calling off) I'll be downstairs, mother. \nMRS. HATCH'S VOICE All right, dear. \nMary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes her hair. She is plainly excited at George's visit. She runs into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel. \nINSERT: THE SKETCH \nIt is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the moon.  Lettering on the drawing says: \"George Lassos The Moon.\" \nBACK TO SHOT \nMary runs into the hall, opens the phonograph and puts on a record of \"Buffalo Gals.\"  Then she opens the front door and stands there waiting for George. \nINT. DOORWAY \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nGeorge is struggling with the gate \u0096 he finally kicks it open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary. \nMARY Well, are you coming in or aren't you? \nGEORGE Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMary and George are in the entrance hall. \nGEORGE When did you get back? \nMARY Tuesday. \nGEORGE Where'd you get that dress? \nMARY Do you like it? \nGEORGE It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them. \nMARY Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know... I guess I was homesick. \nGEORGE (shocked) Homesick? For Bedford Falls? \nMARY Yes, and my family and... oh, everything.  Would you like to sit down? \nThey go through the doorway into the parlor. \nGEORGE All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here. \nMARY Would you rather leave? \nGEORGE No, I don't want to be rude. \nMARY Well, then, sit down. \nGeorge sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a close look at it. \nGEORGE (indicating cartoon) Some joke, huh? \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and Mary sitting on the divan. He is uncomfortable, and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive. \nGEORGE Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here. \nMARY Thank you. \nThere is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing with the phonograph record which has been playing all through the above scene: \nMARY (singing) \"And dance by the light...\" \nGEORGE What's the matter? Oh, yeah... yeah... \nHe looks at his watch, as though about to leave. \nGEORGE Well, I... \nMARY (desperately) It was nice about your brother Harry, and Ruth, wasn't it? \nGEORGE Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right. \n", "test2_true": "GEORGE Well, of course I like her. She's a peach. \nMARY Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh? \nGEORGE No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you. \nINT. STAIRS \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nMrs. Hatch, in a bathrobe, and with her hair in curlers, is leaning over the banister as she calls: \nMRS. HATCH Mary! Mary! \nINT. PARLOR \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge and Mary seated on the divan. \nMRS. HATCH'S VOICE Who's down there with you? \nMARY It's George Bailey, Mother. \nMRS. HATCH'S VOICE George Bailey? What's he want? \nMARY I don't know. (to George) What do you want? \nGEORGE (indignant) Me? Not a thing. I just came in to get warm. \nMARY (to mother) He's making violent love to me, Mother. \nGeorge is aghast. \nMRS. HATCH'S VOICE You tell him to go right back home, and don't you leave the house, either. Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York tonight. \nGEORGE (heatedly) But your mother needn't... you know I didn't come here to... to... to... \nMARY (rising) What did you come here for? \nGEORGE I don't know. You tell me. You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers.  You tell me. \nMARY (terribly hurt) Oh, why don't you go home? \nGEORGE (almost shouting) That's where I'm going. I don't know why I came here in the first place! Good night! \nAs George leaves the room, the telephone in the hall starts ringing. \nMARY (to George) Good night! \nMRS. HATCH'S VOICE Mary! Mary! The telephone! It's Sam! \nINT. HALL \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nMary comes into the hall. \nMARY (almost weeping) I'll get it. \nAs Mary comes into the hall, she stops by the phonograph, which is still playing \"Buffalo Gals,\" takes off the record with a jerk, and smashes it against the machine. The phone is still ringing. \nMRS. HATCH Mary, he's waiting! \nMARY Hello. \nAs Mary picks up the phone, George comes in from the front porch. \nGEORGE I forgot my hat. \nMARY (overly enthusiastic) Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you? \nSAM'S VOICE Aw, great. Gee, it's good to hear your voice again. \nGeorge has stopped, hat in hand, to hear the first greetings. \nMARY Oh, well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam. (glances toward door, sees George still there) There's an old friend of yours here. George Bailey. \nSAM You mean old moss-back George? \nMARY Yes, old moss-back George. \nSAM'S VOICE Hee-haw! Put him on. \nMARY Wait a minute. I'll call him. (calling) George! \nMRS. HATCH He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot! \nMARY He does so. He asked for him. (calling) Geo... George, Sam wants to speak to you. \nShe hands the instrument to George. \nGEORGE Hello, Sam. \nINT. SAM'S NEW YORK OFFICE \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \nSam is seated at his desk, while a couple of his friends are nearby, with highballs in their hands. \nSAM (into phone) Well, George Baileyoffski! Hey, a fine pal you are. What're you trying to do? Steal my girl? \nINT. HATCH HALL \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND MARY \nGEORGE (into phone) What do you mean? Nobody's trying to steal your girl. Here... here's Mary. \nSAM'S VOICE No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I want to talk to both of you. Tell Mary to get on the extension. \nGEORGE (to Mary) Here.

HATCH \nAs she hears this, she hastily hangs up the extension phone on which she has been listening. \nBACK TO SHOT \u0096 GEORGE AND MARY \nMARY We can both hear. Come here. \nMary takes the telephone from George and holds it so that of necessity George's cheek is almost against hers. He is very conscious of her proximity. \nMARY (on phone) We're listening, Sam. \n", "test2_id": 613, "test3_input": "GEORGE I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings. \nCLARENCE Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you? \nGEORGE (humoring him) Sure, sure. How? \nCLARENCE By letting me help you. \nGEORGE Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you? \nCLARENCE Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven. \nGEORGE Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub. \nCLARENCE Oh, tut, tut, tut. \nGEORGE I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive. \nCLARENCE Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you... \nGEORGE (interrupts) Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off. My wife, and my kids and my friends. (annoyed with Clarence) Look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you? \nCLARENCE No, you don't understand. I've got my job... \nGEORGE (savagely) Aw, shut up, will you. \nClarence is not getting far with George. He glances up, paces across the room, thoughtfully. \nCLARENCE (to himself) Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy. (to George) So you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh? \nGEORGE (dejectedly) Oh, I don't know. I guess you're right. I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at all. \nCLARENCE What'd you say? \nGEORGE I said I wish I'd never been born. \nCLARENCE Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You... (gets an idea) ...wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea. (glances up toward Heaven) What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it.  All right. (to George) You've got your wish. You've never been born. \nAs Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the door to the shack. Clarence runs to close the door. \nCLARENCE (looking upward) You don't have to make all that fuss about it. \nAs Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what Clarence has said. \nGEORGE What did you say? \nCLARENCE You've never been born. You don't exist.  You haven't a care in the world. \nGeorge feels his ear as Clarence talks. \nCLARENCE No worries \u0096 no obligations \u0096 no eight thousand dollars to get \u0096 no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff. \nCLOSEUP \u0096 GEORGE AND CLARENCE \nGeorge indicates his bad ear. \nGEORGE Say something else in that ear. \nCLARENCE (bending down) Sure. You can hear out of it. \nGEORGE Well, that's the doggonedest thing... I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water. \nCLARENCE Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George. \nGeorge feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut he received from Welch. He is now thoroughly confused. \nGEORGE What do you know about that... What's happened? \nMEDIUM CLOSE SHOT George looks around, as though to get his bearings. \nGEORGE It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here? (standing up) Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry... \nCLARENCE Our clothes are dry. \nGeorge feels the clothes on the line. \nGEORGE What do you know about that? Stove's hotter than I thought. Now, come on, get your clothes on, and we'll stroll up to my car and get... \nThey start dressing. George interrupts himself. \nGEORGE Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly. \nCLARENCE I can't fly. I haven't got any wings. \nGEORGE You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nMEDIUM SHOT \nThis is the same empty street where George's car swerved into the tree near the sidewalk. George and Clarence come into shot and up to the spot where George had left his car smashed against the tree. George looks around, but his car is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged. \nCLARENCE What's the matter? \nGEORGE (puzzled) Well, this is where I left my car and it isn't here. \nCLARENCE You have no car. \nGEORGE Well, I had a car, and it was right here.  I guess somebody moved it. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 AT CURB \nThe owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages under his arm. \nOWNER (politely) Good evening. \nGEORGE Oh, say... Hey... where's my car? \nOWNER I beg your pardon? \nGEORGE My car, my car. I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree. \nOWNER What tree? \nGEORGE What do you mean, what tree? This tree.  Here, I ran into it. Cut a big gash in the side of it here. \nThe owner bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then straightens up and smells George's breath. He backs away. \nOWNER You must mean two other trees. You had me worried. One of the oldest trees in Pottersville. \nGEORGE (blankly) Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford Falls. \nOWNER I mean Pottersville. (sharply) Don't you think I know where I live? What's the matter with you? \nThe owner proceeds toward his house. George is completely bewildered. \nGEORGE Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is... (to Clarence) ...or you are! \n", "test3_true": "GEORGE Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel. \nHe puts his arm around Clarence, and they start off up the road. \nCLARENCE (as they go) Clarence! \nGEORGE Clarence! Clarence! \nWIPE TO: \nINT. NICK'S BAR \u0096 NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT \nIt is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The cheerful Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard-drinking joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. People are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind the bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up to the bar. \nGEORGE (as they come in) That's all right. Go on in. Martini's a good friend of mine. \nTwo people leave the bar as they approach. \nGEORGE There's a place to sit down. Sit down. \nMEDIUM CLOSEUP Nick is wiping off the bar as they sit down. \nGEORGE Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini? \nNICK You want a martini? \nGEORGE No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he? \nNICK (impatient) Look, I'm the boss. You want a drink or don't you? \nGEORGE Okay \u0096 all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh? \nNICK Okay. (to Clarence) What's yours? \nCLARENCE I was just thinking... (face puckers up with delicious anticipation) It's been so long since I... \nNICK (impatient) Look, mister, I'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind. \nCLARENCE (appreciatively) That's a good man. I was just thinking of a flaming rum punch. No, it's not cold enough for that. Not nearly cold enough...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I got it. Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves. Off with you, me lad, and be lively! \nNICK Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast.  And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear?  Or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer? \nAs he says this, Nick leans over the counter and puts his left fist nearly in Clarence's eye. Clarence is puzzled by this conduct. \nCLARENCE (to George) What's he talking about? \nGEORGE (soothingly) Nick \u0096 Nick, just give him the same as mine. He's okay. \nNICK Okay. \nNick turns away to get the drinks. \nGEORGE What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before. \nCLARENCE You'll see a lot of strange things from now on. \nGEORGE Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow \u0096 you worry me. You got someplace to sleep? \nCLARENCE No. \nGEORGE You don't huh? Well, you got any money? \nNick is listening suspiciously to this conversation. \nCLARENCE No. \nGEORGE No wonder you jumped in the river. \nCLARENCE I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings. \nNick stops pouring the drinks, bottle poised in his hand. \nGEORGE Oh, that's right. \nA cash register bell rings off stage. Clarence reacts to the SOUND of the bell. \nCLARENCE Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it. \nGEORGE Made what? \nCLARENCE Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings. \nGeorge glances up at Nick. \nGEORGE Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here. \nCLARENCE Why? Don't they believe in angels? \nGEORGE (looking at Nick) A... Yeah, but... you know... \nCLARENCE Then why should they be surprised when they see one? \nGEORGE (to Nick) He never grew up. He's... (to Clarence) How old are you, anyway, Clarence? \nCLARENCE Two hundred and ninety-three... (thinks) ...next May. \nNick slams the bottle down on the counter. \nNICK That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window! \nGEORGE Look, Nick. What's wrong? \nNICK (angrily) And that's another thing. Where do you come off calling me Nick? \nGEORGE Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it? \nNICK What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox. (sees someone come in) Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here! \nCLOSE SHOT \nA small wreck of a man, with weak, watery eyes. Obviously a broken-down panhandler, his hat in his hand. \nCLOSEUP \u0096 GEORGE \nHe can hardly believe his eyes. It is Gower the druggist. \nBACK TO SHOT \u0096 NICK AT THE BAR \nNICK (to Gower) Didn't I tell you never to come panhandling around here? \nNick picks up a seltzer bottle, and squirts Gower in the face with it. The crowd laugh brutally. Gower smiles weakly as the soda runs off his face. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower. \n", "test3_id": 614}

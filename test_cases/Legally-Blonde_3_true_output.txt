Wow.   I ' m glad I met you. 
She smiles at him, grateful. 
EMMETT 
Oh, and getting one of Stromwell's daily quotes right is almost as important as acing the mid-term. But you didn't hear it from me. 
Students trickle out of the building. 
ELLE "                .:. 
Are you a third-year? Warner walks up, behind Emmett, interrupting. 
WARNER 
Hey. 
Elle looks up, pure adoration on her face. 
ELLE 
Hi! 
Emmett rises and walks off. 
EMMETT 
Good luck. 
ELLE 
(calling after him) Thanks again for your help! 
Warner remains standing, still somewhat uncomfortable with her presence here. 
WARNER 
S o -- uh -- how was your first class? 
ELLE 
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE (CONT'D) 
(perky) How was your summer? 
She pats the bench beside her.     He doesn't move. 
路 WARNER 
(distracted) Good. Good. 
ELLE 
Do anything exciting? A female hand snakes around Warner's chest from behind. Warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his side, presenting her. 
WARNER 
(nervous) Urn, hey, have you met Sarah? 
Sarah, the horrible girl herself, holds out her hand to Elle, full of contempt. 
SARAH 
Hi.     Sarah Knottingham. 
ELLE 
(to Warner; horrified) 路      You know her? 
WARNER 
She 's -- 
Sarah jumps in.                            路 
SARAH           . 
-- I ' m his fiancee. 
Elle stares at her. Sarah tucks a piece of her mousy brown hair behind her ear and there it is -- The Rock. 
ELLE 
(in disbelief) I'm sorry, I just hallucinated. 
WARNER 
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party. 
Elle looks stricken.     Sarah gives her a smug smile. 
(CONTINUED) 
SARAH 
Warner told me all about you. You're famous at our Club. She says it in a way that is anything but flattering.   In fact, it's completely condescending. 
SARAH (CONT'D) 
(continuing; pointedly) But he didn't tell me you'd be here. 
WARNER 
I didn't know -- 
Elle looks from Warner to Sarah. 
ELLE 
Excuse me. 
She rushes off.    Sarah watches her go, a smug grin on her 
face, 路 
SARAH 
(to Warner) I thought you said she was pretty. 
43   EXT. STREET/INT. ELLE'S CONVERTIBLE BOXSTER- DAY                43 
Elle drives, wiping the tears from her face. She spots something off to the side and SWERVES her car toward it, a gasp of hope escaping her lips.

Sir, I know all about Dr. Zahn. Remember? He's that guy who -- (catches himself) Sir. Yes sir. (beat) I'm sorry. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
Me too, Ben.

micro-circuitry, neat as a pin -- 
DELP'S VOICE 
I thought you said you lost this. 
TIGHT - THROUGH A STEREOSCOPIC MICROSCOPE - THE IMPLANT 
falls into focus, smooth and etched with integrated circuits as intricate and beautiful as a henna tattoo ... 
MARCO'S VOICE 
I found it again. 
128   INT. DELP'S LAB - SKYBOOTH - NIGHT                             128 
Delp looks up from the microscope, at Marco. 
DELP 
These are not supposed to exist, man. These are only theoretical. -- leaves the statement hanging -- 
129   INT. DELP'S LAB - MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                   129 
Delp freaked and hyper, gathering wires and whatnot from shelves -- a veritable armload, as: 
DELP 
You sure you want to do this man? 
MARCO 
Yes. 
DELP 
-- because I don't. 
MARCO 
I'll owe you one. 
Delp rounds a corner -- monkeys scrambling around their cages as he comes to the clearing where 
MARCO 
sits on one of the experimental gurneys, using a pen to write on his arm. 
DELP 
No. I'll still owe you for getting my sorry ass out of Albania. 
MARCO 
-- Talk to me about the implant. 
DELP 
Manchurian Global. Heard of 'em? (off Marco:) Private equity fund, specializes in military support services and weapons research ... including a certain Army implant project that went belly-up in the early 90s. 
MARCO 
You said the Army implants were for medical emergency data. 
DELP 
The ones they publicized were. But, oh man, there was a parallel project of all kinds of scary implantable shit the Clinton watchdogs finally freaked out over, and closed down. 
MARCO 
How do you know all this? 
DELP 
Cuz they funded me to make some of their scary shit. 
MARCO 
What does it do? 
DELP 
I don't know. I don't want to know. You don't want to know -- shit -- it's out of you, and you're still alive. That's the good news. (off his arm) What are you doing? 
INTERCUT - MARCO'S FOREARM 
He's scrawling words on his palm, with a ballpoint pen: 
ROSIE. RAYMOND SHAW. MANCHURIAN-GLOBAL ... 
MARCO 
Back-up in case this makes me forget some stuff I want to remember. 
DELP 
eases Marco back on the gurney, deftly puts some I.V. taps into his arms. Marco's legs hang over the edge. 
DELP 
These are built for monkeys, so bear with me, man. 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
He's putting thread-thin electrodes INTO Marco's head, just beneath the skin.

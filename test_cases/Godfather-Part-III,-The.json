{"train": "THE GODFATHER PART III \nWritten by \nMario Puzo & Francis Ford Coppola \nFIRST DRAFT. 3/22/79 \nFADE IN: \nBEFORE TITLES: The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now, confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us and another, and as our surroundings become more visible, we discover that we are moving through a pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,. suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe. \nIt is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen Fifty-nine. We now see the Corleone compound at lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs. We move toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named Al Neri and Rocco Lampone. Rocco limps slightly. As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house and looks off. \nHAGEN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE LAKE AND LKSIDE Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,. Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten. The boy, dressed for travel, is looking off at the lake, his back to- ward us. \nREVERSE ANGLE - ON TONY As he looks out at the lake we might sense that he is troubled and puzzled, although he is managing to keep his expression stoic. Hagen can be seen in the background, by the house 9 After a moment: \n.T \nCONTINIIED S \nHAGEN Tony. \n(THEN) Time to go. There is a beat and Tony composes himself, turns and moves up toward the house and Tom Hagen. \nEXT. FRONT OF TAEOE HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - DAY \nThe heavy, black sedan is loaded. Connie Corleane and a Housekeeper, in uniform, are bringing Mary, about five, out to the car. She too is dressed for travelling. As they put her into the car -- \nCONNIE In you get --- \nMARY Will. Daddy be at the airport? \n- ANOTHER ANGLE as Tom and Tony come up. \nHAGEN No. Ere wanted me to tell you both how sorry he was. \nTONY \n(TO CONNIE) Aunt Connie ..- ? Connie would apparently prefer to avoid answering any questions. \nCONNIE 8e sure and give my love to your mother. \nNERI It isn't like you won't be back from time to time. \nLAMPCNE I' 11 bet we' 11 all. be together for Christmas. Wait and see. Tony gems into the car. He locks out the window to-- ward the house. We begin XXI-N Ti. TZS 2 C 2=17\"s \nE \nTEE DRIVEWAY Hagen is the last one into the car. As it starts down the driveway on its way to the airport in Reno, Connie, Lampone, Neri and the Housekeeper all wave. The auto- matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens. The Guard at the gate flicks a half-salute as the Limousine passes through. TEE GROUP r n FONT OF EOQSE As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going back inside, Neri and Lampone drifting off, we pan up- ward to a window in the second-story and zoom in. Michael Corleone has moved the curtain aside with one hand and is looking after the disappearing limousine, his expression unreadable-but somehow sad. \nZNT.

NAVY AIM MA.RI Z CORPS STADIUM - DAY \nWe are close on a young man, Anthony Adams (Corleone), in the uniform of a Midshipman of the Naval Academy at Annapolis. We are pulling back as the speaker -- who is Arne Grundellius, the Secretary of State -- continues, his accent faintly Scandinavian. \n\u0095 CRUNDELLIUS' VOICE -- there are no limits to the goals to which we can each legitimately aspire. And now, as an unpopular war is ended in East Asia and we set our sights on new goals, I leave you with the words of another Sailor --- We continue to pull back to discover that we are at the Navy and Marine Corps stadium. It is a late Spring day and in the early-middle Nineteen Seventies. The Midshipmen, their parents and guests, are gathered for- the graduation ceremonies. \nGRQNDELLIIIS ' Our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all.

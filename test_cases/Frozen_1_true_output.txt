He moves as fast as he can towards the area under Parker's chair, swinging his weapon like a madman all the while. 
The wolves only stare. 
Finally, he reaches the area and grabs Dan's snowboard, still sticking up in the snow. 
LYNCH (cont'd) Parker, I'm gonna go get help! Don't move and I'll be back as fast as I can! 
X Parker sobs. 
PARKER OK. 
R LYNCH Just don't move!     I'm getting help! 
Without hesitation, Lynch throws down Dan's board and lays 
A his body on top of it. Pushing off he begins to slide quickly down the hill. 
CUT TO: 
M 83   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                      83 From Parker's POV, she watches him disappear down the hill. 
But mere seconds later, the pack of wolves gives chase and follow suit behind him over the horizon. 
Only the creaking of the strained metal chair arm can be 
D heard now. 
Parker sobs quietly to herself. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
E 84   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - EARLY EVENING                                   84 From a distance, Parker's broken chair dangles dangerously in the night air. 
Her body is slumped in the corner. 
Still. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
85   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - NIGHT                                      85 Parker is not moving in her chair. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
X HARD CUT TO: 
86   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MORNING                                    86 
R The morning sun hits Parker's pale face.   Is she dead? 
Parker opens her eyes. She must have drifted off for the night. She looks to the tree-line around her. 
A The sun is coming up. 
She tries to move her body to look back in Lynch's direction and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and cable noise. 
M PARKER (to herself) Lynch. 
There is no sign of anyone or anything in the direction down the hill behind her. 
Slowly a look of great determination comes over her face. 
D She raises the safety bar. 
There is no more time to think. 
E She is going to die one way or another. 
Slowly, Parker turns her body around towards the seat of the chair. 
Holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair, she beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side. 
CREEEEE-EEK! The lone metal bolt protests the movement and makes metallic threats to snap. 
Parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is dangling below the chair. 
RRRRRUUUUUURRR! A gust of wind pushes against the chair, straining the arm. 
Parker concentrates and slowly tries to hold up her weight as she inches her body even lower. 
Smoothly, slowly, almost there- SNAP!   The bolt gives way! 
The chair lurches down at an even greater angle, sending Parker off of the side! 
X PARKER (cont'd) AHHHH!

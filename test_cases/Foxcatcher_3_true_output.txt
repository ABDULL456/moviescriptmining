She SHUTS the door, leaving him outside. He turns and looks out over the VAST LAWN of the estate. Far off, it's being mowed by a gardener. 
UNIFORMED MAID (opening the door) Please. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - CONTINUOUS 
They walk just a few feet and she gestures toward a door. 
MARK (CONFUSED) Is he? He's in there? 
UNIFORMED MAID The washroom. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROCOCO WASHROOM/BIG HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Floral wallpaper, gold fixtures and faucet. Mark pisses - mouth open, eyes half shut. He flushes. 
He looks at a dish holding little pastel horseshoes. Soap? He picks one up, smells it. Washes his hands - monstrous with the tiny soap. He wipes his hands on his pants, avoiding the neatly hung towelettes. He opens the door. 
UNIFORMED MAID Mr. Beck will see you now. 
Mark doesn't know who Mr. Beck is. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STAN BECK'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 
Mark is let into a large third floor office with a big desk, wood filing cabinets, LAW BOOKS lining the bookshelves. 
STAN BECK (mid-forties, no-nonsense, suit and tie) rises from behind the desk as Mark enters. 
STAN BECK Come in, sit down. 
MARK Thanks. 
STAN BECK Thank you, Rosie. 
UNIFORMED MAID You're welcome, Mr. Beck. 
She exits, closing the door behind her. 
STAN BECK Okay. Okay. So. Mark Schultz, correct? 
MARK Yes. 
STAN BECK (opens a folder, writing) S-C-H-U-L-T-Z? 
MARK That's right. 
STAN BECK ... M-A-R-K? 
Mark just looks at him. Beat. Then he nods. 
STAN BECK (CONT'D) All right. Mark. I manage affairs for Mr. du Pont. Look after his interests. If you have a problem, you come to me. If Mr. Du Pont has a problem, I'll come to you. Okay? 
MARK Sounds okay. 
STAN BECK Let's talk about what you're doing here. I'd like to make sure we all understand each other. Does that sound like a good policy to you? 
MARK That could be a good policy. 
STAN BECK Good. I think so, too. First thing I can tell you is that Mr. du Pont is very happy he can help you with your goals. But I want to make sure you're aware of what's expected. It's not a free ride. In exchange for the guest house, the more than substantial salary, the privilege of training at Foxcatcher Farms, Mr. du Pont expects results. Understood? 
MARK Yes. 
STAN BECK I'm sure you can appreciate that. 
MARK Of course. 
STAN BECK That goes for every wrestler. 
MARK I've actually got suggestions for about half the roster. 
He pulls a creased, folded piece of paper from his pocket. 
STAN BECK What about the other half?

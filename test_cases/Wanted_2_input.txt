We've seen this place before. It's the same roof where cross took out the second head of The door is kicked open and Wesley walks out, eyes blazing. Sloan is waiting for standing t feet away, holding his father's pearl-handled gun, trained right on Wesley's head. 
SLOAN Can't say I don't have a sense of irony. The place I first decided to bring you in. Wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops. 
SLOAN (CONT'D) You once asked why I helped hide you as an infant... It gave me power, Wesley'. Power to become a head of the Fraternity. Power over your father. And ultimately it gave me you: the perfect weapon to kill your father. 
WESLEY But now you have to dispose of the weapon. 
SLOAN In some ways it pains me to do so. You 460 are like the son I never had. 
WESLEY Fuck you. Sloan's eyes narrow. 
SLOAN Fine. Keep your worthless dignity. You're still just the same loser we plucked off the street six weeks ago. Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in. Sloan laughs derisively. 
SLOAN (CONT'D) You can't win, Wesley. The Fraternity is everywhere. Even if you kill me others will come from other cities to take my place. You'll be hunted your whole life. 
(BEAT) But that's not gonna happen. Like I told you before, when we are called, death is as certain as the sun. Wesley stands as straight as he can muster. The two men face each other like two gunmen on Main Street in Dodge city... an old newspaper even blows through like a tumbleweed. And we are close on Wesley's face. act it i the same shot from the opening of the movie. 
WESLEY Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic. We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve... 
WESLEY (CONT'D) But not today. With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun, the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they both open fire... .Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan does the same. Just like he did with h' father. .But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took the knife. 
WESLEY (CONT'D Uhhh! He can't raise his arm, it's useless, but he's come too damn far to stop now... he flips his gun from his good hand to his bad hand and manages to keep FIRING! Then Wesley does something unexpected... he starts sprinting straight at Sloan, still knocking his bullets out of the air... He closes the gap... ten feet... five feet... ..a surprised and worried expression now spreads on Sloan's face,.like what is this kid doing? But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots the gun out of Sloan's hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his feet! They go flying right over the edge of the building. Wesley's able to grab on to a railing cable and stop himself... ..but Sloan is going to go over. At the last moment, Sloan reacher. for-something. anything. and grabs one-handed the barrel of Wesley's gun... For a moment, they dangle there in this precarious position, looking each other in the face. Sloan can't believe he's been bested by this kid. 
SLOAN 
(SNARLS) Go ahead and shoot me, killer. Just like you did your old man. Wesley's finger starts to squeeze the trigger, but then he smiles... 
WESLEY I'm done with this life. Just like my father. And with that, Wes1gy drops the n out of his h 
FROM TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW: We watch Sloan's body fall through the sky... 
..down, down, down... .until it SMASHES into the sidewalk, splattering like a grapefruit. 
ON THE ROOFTOP: Wesley rolls over on to his back, looking up at the darkening sky. 
WESLEY (V.O.) It's true. Six weeks ago I was ordinary and-pathetic. Just like you. He sits up, moving OUT OF FRAME. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
The place is now blanketed with cops, looking at the dead bodies, trying to make sense of what happened. 
WESLEY (V.0.) But I've learned something in that time. I've learned about the man who made me. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN CORNER - DAY 
Cope stand on the street, handing out pictures of Wesley, asking pedestrians if they've seen this man. 
WESLEY (V.O.) I've learned about the man I am.

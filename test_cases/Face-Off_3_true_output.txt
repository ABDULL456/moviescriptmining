Hoag reacts in horror at the raw muscle, cartilage and bone.  The man lifts a cigarette to his lips... then exhales. 
CASTOR What do you think I want? 
INT. PRISON - POPULATION - DAY 
A huge wall-screen plays gentle nature scenes.  Below -- the inmates engage in their exercise hour. 
Voisine stares at the screen -- while Pollux carefully watches his "brother" play basketball.  Archer tosses up an air-ball to the jeers of other inmates. 
POLLUX You realize, of course, that magnetic humming is designed to drive us insane.  If we all don't get brain tumors first. 
VOISINE And that same cloying Bambi tape -- over and over... 
POLLUX It's like they're begging us to riot.  Where the fuck are we, anyway? (the game ends) Gotta go... 
Pollux trots over to Archer -- passes him his cigarette. He studies Archer as he takes a drag -- and nearly gags. 
POLLUX ... I'm worried about you. 
ARCHER Why? 
POLLUX Your jumpshot has no arc.  You used to swagger... now you swish. You're gumming that butt like a Catholic school girl. (notices) And why do you keep picking at your finger? 
Pollux has caught Archer reflexively tugging at his phantom wedding ring.  Archer immediately stops.  He takes a drag and holds it -- then exhales right in Pollux's face. 
ARCHER I was in a coma... 
Pollux sticks his finger under Archer's eye and pulls down like a vet examining a sick dog.  Archer pushes him off. 
ARCHER My reflexes, my senses, my memory... everything's jumbled.  I can't even tell you why Dubov jumped me yesterday. 
POLLUX You Pollinated his wife the day he was arrested.  How could forget that? 
ARCHER I've forgotten plenty.  Look around -- we've screwed over half the freaks in here.  What's gonna happen to us if they think I've lost it? 
Pollux contemplates the other inmates -- circling, sizing up the brothers like hungry sharks.  Instinctively, Pollux moves closer to Archer for protection. 
ARCHER I need you to play big brother for once -- till I can fill in a few blanks.  Think you can handle that? 
Pollux nods grimly -- then Archer pulls up his sleeve, exposing the pyramid tattoo. 
ARCHER I know I got this on my tenth birthday.  I just can't remember why. 
POLLUX Man -- that was the worst day of our lives! 
Archer feigns a "struggle" with his memory.  He lights a new butt with the old -- chain-style... then "remembers." 
ARCHER Oh, God -- Mom O-D'd at County General. 
POLLUX Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution. (a beat) Remember what you swore to me at the funeral? 
ARCHER Uh -- to kill the doctors? 
POLLUX After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me. 
ARCHER And I bet I kept that promise... 
POLLUX Only one you've never broken. 
Pollux curls into Archer -- in need of comfort.  Archer puts an affectionate arm around Pollux -- springing the trap. 
ARCHER Screw the past.  We've got the future to look forward to. (a beat) We still have tomorrow. 
POLLUX No shit... five million bucks... now those Red Militia crackpots get to keep it. 
ARCHER That's not the worst part. 
POLLUX What's worse than losing five million bucks? 
ARCHER Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  What you built was a work of art.  It belongs in the Smithsonian. 
Pollux beams with pride -- Archer hangs on every word. 
POLLUX Yeah -- well... the L.A. Convention Center will have to do... 
ARCHER Thanks, Pollux. 
POLLUX 'Thanks'?  I guess they really did fuck you up. 
Then Archer smiles -- like Jon Archer.  Without knowing exactly why -- a wave of ill-ease overtakes Pollux. 
INT. ARCHER'S CELL - DAY 
Archer paces impatiently... as the door rolls open. Walton is looking at him with cool respect. 
WALTON You have a visitor. 
Archer smiles to himself -- pleased at Brodie's timeliness.

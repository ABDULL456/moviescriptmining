VOICE That's up to you.  But any mention of me will not be appreciated. 
STU You mean...? 
VOICE You won't even get to finish your sentence.  Oh look, that little red dot is dancing around all over you again.  You saw how quickly it can happen.  And how accurate I can be. 
STU They can't blame me -- I'm not armed. 
VOICE Who's going to believe that?  With all those witnesses to the contrary. 
STU They can see with their own eyes. 
Not far away, we hear the BLAST of POLICE SIRENS drawing closer. 
VOICE Remember to leave me out of it. 
STU How can I? 
VOICE You'll put the proper spin on it. Isn't that your specialty?  Feeding the public a story that may not have a shred of truth -- and making it totally believable? 
STU This isn't a story.  This is real. This is murder. 
VOICE If you'd only dealt with the man reasonably, shown him some respect, this might not have been necessary. 
STU I gave him my money, my watch... 
VOICE But not your respect.  Which is what he required of you. 
STU He was a fucking thief. 
VOICE And now he's a fucking dead thief. Do you feel better about that? 
STU I don't feel a bit guilty.  This is all your doing! 
VOICE Now you're being disrespectful of me.  You never learn.  Your job is to deal with people -- but you're not good at it. 
STU Hey, I'm not taking any more criticism from some lunatic sniper who gets his kicks killing strangers. 
VOICE You keep insisting I'm a stranger. Probably because you don't recognize the voice.  But there are cheap electronic devices available that disguise the voice.  I might not even be a man.  I might be one of those many women you've almost totally forgotten.  One who doesn't forgive easily.  One who wants to watch you squirm. 
STU You're a man.  I know you're a man. Women don't kill with telescopic rifles.  They stab you. 
VOICE You sound so sure of that.  But you've never provoked any man as much as have the women in your life.  And so many of them, Stu. (a beat) Do you even remember their names? 
STU I've got no time to rehash my whole life.  Oh my God!  The cops are here. 
Police cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue. 
Traffic has suddenly been shut down.  Prowl cars have now blocked the streets. 
PRODUCTION NOTE: Everything is seen from Stu's perspective without intercuts. 
Half a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns. 
FELICIA (pointing) That's him -- in the booth.  He's got a gun! 
As she hurls accusations, she's lugging Leon's lifeless body out into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue. 
It's a bright afternoon.  In the distance, we hear the maddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being rerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of irate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their simplest form of protest.  It's a discordant concert that echoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels... 
As the cops surround the booth -- at a distance.

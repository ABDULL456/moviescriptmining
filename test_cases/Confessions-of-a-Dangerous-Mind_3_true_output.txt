BARRIS (conspiratorially) You know what I'd do? -- And don't tell anybody -- I'd rub... I'd rub Alpo brand dog food on my dick so the dogs would stick their noses into my... dick. Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my trick, my great contribution to the world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I ask you. 
There is a silence. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) (screaming) I ask you! BELLHOP I... I... I don't know, sir. 
Suddenly Barris punches himself in the head, flops down on the unmade bed. The bellhop glances at Barris's bare ass, looks away. 
BELLHOP (CONT'D) Mr. Barris, maybe if you just don't watch the show every night, you wouldn't have to -- 
BARRIS I always pay for the damn tv's, don't I? (turning to face him) Don't I?! 
BELLHOP It's -- Yes, you do, sir, and we appreciate that -- It's just that there've been complaints from some of the other guests, and Mr. Andrews, the assistant manager, requested that I -- 
BARRIS Still? Complaints? I specifically used the silencer this time! Specifically! 
BELLHOP Well, the people in 917 found a bullet lodged in their wall. And while we want to accommodate you -- we certainly value your patronage -- there is an issue of customer safety. 
Barris lets this sink in. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BARRIS Yes, of course. 
Barris finds his pants draped over a chair, pulls out his wallet, holds some more money out to the bellhop. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) My apologies. Buy -- 917, is it? -- buy them a magnum of your finest champagne. And... and your finest spackle. Oh, and get me a bag of plastic army men while you're out. I forgot to tell you before. 
The bellhop sighs, takes the money. 
BELLHOP Thank you for your understanding, sir. 
The bellhop exists. 
BARRIS (calling after) And some black socks!   Seven black socks, you rascule! 
Barris locks the door, dumps the contents of the bags onto the floor, fishes through the mess for a cigar, puts the cigar in his mouth, studies himself in a full length mirror. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by the sight of me. And why not? I'm wrinkled... (searches for simile, then proudly) ... like a prune. Covered in liver spots... (searches for simile) ... like an old guy. My hair is falling out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube of fat hangs from my waist, practically obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine even though I left the toilet ages ago. My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound. George Orwell said every man has the face he deserves by fifty. Does every man have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as well? Does every fifty year old asshole have the asshole he deserves? 
EXT. TERRACE - DAY 
This feels real, verite. The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a cigar, is being interviewed. He stands outside his villa in St. Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the hotel room, and talks to someone off-camera. 
ACTUAL BARRIS It was 1981. I had holed myself up in this New York hotel. Parker Hotel. Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my life. 
INTERVIEWER (O.C.) Ashamed?   What do you mean? 
Barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks, occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed. 
ACTUAL BARRIS When you're young, your potential is infinite. You might do anything, really. You might be great. You might be Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you get to an age where what you might be gives way to what you have been. You weren't Einstein. You weren't anything. That's a bad moment. But I remembered something Carlyle wrote: "... there is no life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or unrhymed." I realized my salvation might be in recording my wasted life, unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me understand why. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Barris, now in a hotel terrycloth bathrobe and a porkpie hat, sits at a desk and types manically. 
BARRIS (V.O.) My name is Charles Prescott Barris. I have written pop songs, I have been a television producer. I am responsible for polluting the airwaves with mind- numbing, puerile entertainment. In addition, I have murdered thirty-three human beings. I am damned to hell. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - DAY 
It's sepia. Three year old Chuck, dressed somewhat girlishly and sporting a blonde pageboy haircut is being posed on a pony by a photographer. His mother stands by anxiously as the boy totters on the animal. 
BARRIS (V.O.) Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1931, my early childhood remains accessible to me only as a series of elliptical, enigmatic memories. 
INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY 
A smiling butcher hands a slice of bologna to young Barris, who puts it in his mouth. 
BARRIS (V.O.) The taste of bologna fresh from the butcher. 
EXT. CEMENT YARD - DAY 
A baby doll is set afire.   Young Barris dances around it. 
BARRIS (V.O.) The sickly sweet smell of a burning babydoll on a crisp autumn day. 
INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY 
Young Barris is being dressed by his mother. We're close on the velvet material being slipped over his head. 
BARRIS (V.O.) Velvet brushing against my tender young skin, as my mother dressed me. 
EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

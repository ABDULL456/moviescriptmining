CHARLIE Are you sure you're in the right place? Not expecting a funeral. Suddenly Bush steps into the church. Charlie squints over then stares at Bush with utter disbelief. 
CHARLIE Felix?! 
BUSH Hey, Charlie. They shake hands, then hug. Buddy is blown away that Bush would hug anyone. Bush looks up at the church rafters. 
BUSH Still standing. 
CHARLIE Yes. Charlie give Bush a look then holds out his hand to Buddy again. 
CHARLIE Reverend Charlie Jackson. 
BUDDY Hi! 
BUSH That's Buddy Robinson, he don't talk much. 
CHARLIE Someone better talk. A ghost pulls up in the driveway in a hearse, you expect a little bit of a story. 
94 INT. CHURCH - LATER 94 
Bush, Buddy and Charlie, sit in pews near a lovely altar. 
CHARLIE My hearing is not what it was. It sounded like you said you want me to preach at your funeral party with you sitting there? 
BUSH Yes, sir. 
CHARLIE (shaking his head) You know I've talked to God a lot about you over the years and he said he broke the mould when he made you. Said you were sure entertaining to watch but way too much trouble. Buddy grins. 
BUSH Well. 
CHARLIE What would you want me to say at this funeral? 
BUSH Whatever you want to, Charlie. 
CHARLIE 
(TO BUDDY) Could you give us a minute? Buddy starts to get up. 
BUSH Sit still. Buddy plops back down. 
CHARLIE What's the matter? You scared to be alone with me? 
BUSH He can hear what's said. Buddy is surprised again. So is Charlie. 
CHARLIE All right. After you left here.. did you do the right thing? 
Felix looks up at the beautifully crafted pulpit. 
BUSH I did.. what I thought was right. 
CHARLIE You confessed? Asked forgiveness? Bush looks off and the muscles jump in his jaw. 
CHARLIE Did you tell her, Felix? Charlie sighs, leans on his knees, and drops his head. 
CHARLIE You came a long way for nothing then. Bush's eyes jerk back to Charlie and they are hot. Buddy tenses. 
BUSH You self-righteous..

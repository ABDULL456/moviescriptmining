Whistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle, shining the beam over every inch of the room. And just as he's about to complete his circuit -- 
THE CHILD 
leaps from where it had been hiding overhead! Karen SCREAMS. Whistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight spinning from his hand -- 
The feral child lands atop Whistler, HISSING like a cobra. Its macrocephalic head seems to morph, twisting into grotesque proportions. And just as it's about to strike -- 
ZZZZING! Whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden inside his cane. He lunges forward -- 
WHOOSH! The child takes off like a blue streak, sending test tubes and medical equipment CRASHING to the floor. It zips past Karen -- 
WHISTLER Get it!!! 
Karen snatches up the flashlight, chasing after it as Whistler struggles to his feet -- 
Karen sweeps the flashlight around, catching only fleeting glimpses of the child as it darts through the workshop. She reaches a shelving unit where Whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified pistols -- 
Karen tries to draw a bead on the creature. She FIRES, misses, FIRES again -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the creature is moving closer and -- 
-- suddenly it's right in front of her, flying through the air, fangs bared! 
The child knocks Karen back against the wall. It's at her throat, sinking its claws into her neck. Karen chokes, forcing Whistler's pistol under the monstrosity's chin -- 
-- but then the creature morphs again, transforming into a beatific little cherubim of a child -- and Karen hesitates, because the child seems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous, pulsing and hypnotic and -- 
-- suddenly Whistler reaches in from behind, YANKING the vampire child's head back, FIRING a pistol into its skull. The creature slumps -- 
Karen cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. As it continues to writhe -- 
THUNK! Whistler swings his cane-rapier down on the creature, brutally decapitating it. Finishing the job. Then he looks to Karen, winded. 
WHISTLER Understand this -- they are monsters. Hesitate for even a moment, and you've lost. 
FROST (O.S.) Words to live by, Whistler. 
Whistler spins, eyes wide. He knows that voice. 
DEACON FROST 
steps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight, followed by Mercury and Quinn. 
FROST It's been a long time, hasn't it, "old friend"? 
EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - MIRACIA'S CABIN - NIGHT 
Blade is led to a plywood cabin crowded with candle-lit altars -- garish pictures of Saints and demons abound, alongside bottles of roots and herbs steeped in alcohol, human bones, voodoo dolls. 
MIRACIA 
sits on a sagging couch outside, clutching a deck of well-thumbed Bicycle playing cards. She's ancient, with a mouthful of gold-capped teeth and cataract-clouded eyes. Blind. 
MIRACIA Is something wrong, my friend? 
BLADE You're blind -- 
MIRACIA There are other ways to see. Sit. 
Blade approaches, uneasy. Miracia deals out the playing cards on a rickety table, setting them in nine piles which take on a cross formation. 
MIRACIA Perhaps you have brought me something -- an offering for the orishas? 
Blade tosses a handful of bills on the table. Miracia nods, then flips over the first card in the center pile -- a one-eyed Jack. She sighs, grave -- 
MIRACIA Hold out your hands. 
BLADE I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated. 
MIRACIA Show me. 
Blade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the table. Miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper, touching her fingertips to her lips. 
MIRACIA Sangre. Written in blood. 
She runs her hands over each line as if it were written in Braille. Some of the candles gutter, then extinguish themselves as the wind around them rises. 
MIRACIA This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.

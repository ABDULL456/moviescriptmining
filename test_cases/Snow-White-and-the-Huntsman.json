{"train": "SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN \nWritten by \nEvan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock & Hossein Amini \nStory by \nEvan Daugherty \nInspired by the Brothers Grimm's \n\"Little Snow White\" \nNovember 22nd, 2011 \n1 EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 1 \nFrom high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object. \nERIC (V.0.) Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen was admiring the falling snow when she saw a rose blooming in defiance of the cold. The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down. \nERIC (V.0.) Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and three drops of blood fell. BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach. \nERIC (V.0.) And because the red seemed so alive against the white, she thought, if only I had a child as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and all with the strength of that rose. A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby -- \n2 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 2 \nWe find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms -- until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother. \nERIC (V.O.) Soon after, a daughter was born to the Queen and was named \"Snow White.\" With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror. \nERIC V/O And she was adored throughout the kingdom as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty. \n3 EXT. WOODS NEAR CASTLE - DAY. 3 \nA wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE, aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned. \n(CONTINUED) \n3 CONTINUED: 3 \nYOUNG SNOW WHITE Pick it up, William. Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down, then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable. \nYOUNG WILLIAM It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched. Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie, calming its flapping before she picks it up. High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on. \n4 EXT. SEASIDE VILLAGE/ CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4 \nSNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens, HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS -- \nYOUNG SNOW WHITE Hurry, William! Hurry! They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead -- \n5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5 \nA single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle. \n6 OMITTED 6 \n7 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 7 \nSnow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken. \nYOUNG SNOW WHITE We found it in the woods. The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks. The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing. \nQUEEN It will heal in time. Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird. \n(CONTINUED) \n7 CONTINUED: 7 \nSNOW WHITE You did? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRAVENNA Yes. A King tore me from her arms, dressed me in lace and stole my innocence. Snow White's smile dies a bit; confused. \nRAVENNA I can never take your mother's place, but I feel that you and I are bound. (touches her heart) I feel it here. Snow White mimics, touching her own heart, and smiles at Ravenna. It should be a touching moment but something in Snow White's face - the way her smile lights up the room - gives Ravenna pause. \n12 INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY 12 \nRavenna, in a stunning dress,.walks down the center aisle. All the NOBLES in the land are present. Ravenna looks at them, on either side of the aisle. They are all smiling, nodding appreciation. But they aren't really looking at Ravenna. She follows their gaze to -- Snow White, behind, holding the folds of silk from the wedding dress. Snow White looks up, adoringly, at Ravenna. As the bride and groom reach the altar, KING MAGNUS turns and smiles, the happiest man alive. \n13 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - NIGHT 13 \nKing Magnus lies on the bed, drunk - half with wine and half with lust. His eyes fixed on -- Ravenna, in a sheer silk nightgown standing near the fireplace, holding a goblet. Staring a seductive hole through him. She starts slowly toward him, never taking her eyes off him. He licks his lips - can't wait for her to arrive. \nKING MAGNUS (Gazing at her lustfully) Who are you? \nRAVENNA The bane of Kings. When she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed, rolls him on his back, straddles him and offers the goblet. \nRAVENNA Sup, my lord. King Magnus drains the goblet, tosses it and gropes her body. \n(CONTINUED) \n13 CONTINUED: 13 \nRAVENNA Now you are mine. Her eyes gleam in the firelight. Magnus tries to playfully wrestle her off, but she grabs his hands and holds him down firmly. \nRAVENNA I will destroy you. \nKING MAGNUS \n(LOVING IT) Indeed, you will. She rips open his shirt then bends down and kisses him on the lips. He can't believe how good she tastes. \nRAVENNA As my people were destroyed. As my family was destroyed. As I would have been destroyed. He is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show discomfort. \nRAVENNA But when a woman stays young forever - no man can resist her - and the world is hers. He suddenly STARTS TO CHOKE, his eyes widening in surprise. As he struggles for breath... \nKING MAGNUS What...? \nRAVENNA First I will take your life, my lord. Then I will take your throne. She reaches beneath the sheets, pulls out an ORNATE DAGGER and BRINGS IT DOWN THROUGH HIM -- 13a EXT. OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM 13a Several Guards line the hallway. The door opens and Ravenna emerges. As she moves past them... \nRAVENNA The King has laid down his sword for the night. Their eyes take her, lustfully, in as she strides away and disappears around a corner. \nCUT TO: \n13b INT. GYPSY WAGON - FLASHBACK - DAY. 13b Ravenna's mother takes Ravenna's hand and holds it over a bowl of white liquid. \nRAVENNA'S MOTHER You must trust me, my love. With a small blade she nicks Ravenna's wrist. Three drops of blood fall into the white liquid - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Finn, Ravenna's brother blasts through the door. \nFINN They're coming! The King's men! \nRAVENNA Drink! Ravenna chokes it down. \nRAVENNA'S MOTHER Drink! And with it the ability to steal youth and beauty! For that is your ultimate power and only protection. Finn steps forward. \nFINN I will protect my sister! Ravenna's mother reaches out and touches her son's forehead, closes her eyes, an incantation of sorts... \nFINN So it shall be, Finn. \nCUT TO: \n14 EXT. COURTYARD/CASTLE - PRESENT - NIGHT 14 \nRavenna exits the castle and crosses the courtyard with a lantern. A portcullis opens and DARK FIGURES emerge from the shadows, entering the castle. Leading them is a tall pale-eyed warrior (FINN). He looks at Ravenna devotedly. \nRAVENNA Welcome, brother. \nA chill wind whips through the woods. Lying sprawled on the ground we see a man (ERIC) who looks like he's dead. \n(CONTINUED) \n22 CONTINUED: 22 It's only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see the empty FLAGON OF GROG by his side and realize he's drunk. His eyes flicker, as a WOMAN'S SCREAM cuts through the woods. \nFLASH TO: \nTHE SPECTRE OF A WOMAN SARA, beautiful, in pain. A patch of blood blossoms on her dress. Her mouth is open, screaming but no sound comes out. \nBACK TO SCENE - WE HEAR THE SCREAM Eric's eyes flicker and begin to open -- then he hears it again. \nROSE (O.S.) Help!!!! He rises to his feet unsteadily, his head pounding from a hangover, then grabs two THROWING HATCHETS and slides them into his harness on his back -- \n23-240MITTED 23-24 \n25 EXT. FOREST - DAY. 25 \nEric runs past trees and ducks under branches, crashing into a few, still drunk. As he arrives at a clearing he sees a beautiful girl, (ROSE), fighting off a HUGE TATTOOED WARRIOR, \n(BROCH). \nERIC Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head! BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised. \nBROCH Ale given you courage again, huntsman? \nERIC Won't take much courage to split your skull from here. \nBROCH Aye, but first you'd have to see straight. Broch advances with a grin, drawing his own axe. Trying to clear his vision and steady his aim, Eric hurls the hatchet -- and MISSES, the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened Greta's head -- Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe. Eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows, his natural skill and dexterity slowed down by all the ale he's drunk. \n(CONTINUED) \n13A \n25 CONTINUED: 25 Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the trees. He corners him against an oak and swings his axe -- only for Eric to duck at the last moment -- The blade buries itself deep in the tree, stuck. We realize now from Eric's dark smile that he lured Broch into the trap. He draws his second hatchet, but instead of using the blade, cracks Broch over the head with the handle, knocking him out. Rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through Broch's pockets. \n(CONTINUED) \n25 CONTINUED: (2) 25 \nROSE Thank you. Eric turns. Rose sees how handsome he is. Eric stares at her thoughtfully then approaches and gently lifts her chin, examining her pretty features. Rose doesn't seem to mind, looking back with an inviting smile. \nROSE I don't know how to repay you? Eric stares at her a moment, then suddenly picks her up and tosses her over his shoulders. \nERIC Don't worry, somebody else will. \n26 OMITTED 26 \n27 EXT. VILLAGE - DAY. 27 \nAnd now we see a RICKETY PRISON WAGON full of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, just like Rose, staring out furiously from behind bars. Eric and a SLAVE MERCHANT haggle over Rose who is bound and gagged, looking just as furious as the other women. \nSLAVE MERCHANT Her nose is on the large size and her chin's a little weak. \nERIC Your eyes are dim. \nSLAVE MERCHANT I'll give you two gold pieces. \nERIC After all the business we've done together? Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away. \nSLAVE MERCHANT Four gold pieces and that's my final offer! Eric doesn't even bother to turn around. \nERIC I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank you. The slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out: \nSLAVE MERCHANT Ten gold pieces! Eric hesitates, but it's not from a guilty conscience, he's just considering the price. Then he smiles, turns. They have a deal. \n14A \n28 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL - DAY. 28 \nFINN Your beating heart. Snow White grips the roofing nail even tighter as she looks at him. As he leans closer, she notices his off hand - the dagger and -- She SLASHES him across the face with the nail. Blood flies. Finn reacts, grabs his face in pain, yells and Snow White kicks him and runs for the door, locking it behind -- \n39 INT. GRETA'S CELL/ TOWER STEPS - DAY. 39 \nSnow White hurtles down the steps to Greta's cell. She is shocked by what she sees. Rose, now an old woman, looks to her. Snow White fumbles with the keys. Rose holds out both her hands. Snow White takes them, looks into her eyes. \nROSE Go. Finn stumbles to the cell door, clutching his face. \nFINN \nGUARDS! Snow White tosses the keys into an empty cell and races away. \n40 INT. CORRIDOR/ CASTLE - DAY. 40 \nSnow White runs down the steps into a corridor and sees ARMED GUARDS appear at the other end. She hurries into another tower, bolting the door shut behind her, and charges down the steps. \n41 EXT. COURTYARD/ CASTLE - DAY. 41 \nSNOW WHITE BURSTS OUTSIDE -- into the light. She almost hyperventilates at all the air, the sky. Then she runs through the courtyard toward the portcullis. The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to follow. She does and heads straight for the small opening at the base of the castle wall - the entrance to the SEWERS. As the magpies rise, she slides on one hip, plunging into the darkness below. The guards follow but can't squeeze through the opening, running towards the Portcullis instead. \n42 INT. SEWER - DAY. 42 \nSnow White splashes through the deep stinking sludge. \n43 EXT. PORTCULLIS - DAY. 43 \nThe old rebel, Thomas, with his son's body draped over a mule, looks back curiously as he hears the guards yelling -- \nCHIEF GUARD 0/S Open the gates! The Princess has escaped! He stares in surprise as riders gallop out. \n44 EXT. SEA - OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 44 \nSnow White is swept out of the sewers into the sea. Seaweed wraps itself around her limbs, pulling her deeper.into the depths, but she kicks and fights her way back to the surface -- gasping for air. \n45 EXT. BEACH -- OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 45 \nSnow White swims ashore. She looks up and sees a maze of large rocks stretching out. She sets off in one direction when the two MAGPIES reappear, urging her to follow them in another direction. She scrambles after them and sees a WHITE MARE waiting for her on the beach, lying on its side, allowing her to climb on. The mare raises itself and is away in a flash. \n46 EXT. BEACH - DAY. 46 \nGalloping hooves skim the surf, RIDERS pursuing Snow White. \n47 EXT. DECIMATED VILLAGE - DAY. 47 \nSnow White rides towards the village -- only it's unrecognizable now -- most of the cottages have been razed to the ground or boarded up. A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry, desperate - see her approach and move out to greet her. She stops her horse for a moment, gazing past tears at the devastation and the state of villagers all around her. At first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer their faces reveal dangerous desperation and -- She gallops off, looking back to see the Queen's men giving chase. \n48 EXT. FIELDS AND WOODLAND BEYOND THE VILLAGE - DAY. 48 \nThe fields and woods are even more devastated than the village. Farmland has been burnt to cinders and trees chopped down. All around Snow White the world is stubble and ash. \n49 EXT. ENDLESS MOOR - AERIAL SHOT - DAY. 49 \nSnow White crests a hill, her mare rearing as she sees -- THE DARK FOREST -- A VAST WALL OF PRIMORDIAL TREES. A mist seeps from the forest like an evil miasma. Snow white hesitates -- then sees the riders closing in and urges her mare on -- \n50 EXT. MISTY BOGS/ ENTRANCE TO THE DARK FOREST - DAY. 50 \nShadows everywhere. The mare charges into the misty bog then suddenly loses her footing. She rears -- throwing Snow White onto the safety of solid ground. Snow White tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away, not wanting to endanger her life. She tries again but the horse backs farther away from her. Slowly they're separated by the swirling fog -- As Snow White sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear. Reluctantly she turns and runs into the forest -- \n(CONTINUED) \n50 CONTINUED: 50 The riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick in terror. One guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog, frightening off the others. Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too afraid to enter the forest. \n51 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 51 \nSnow White hurtles through the trees, a ghostly fog rising up all around her, then trips over a root, landing face first in -- A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN. She coughs, trying to fan the pollen away, but it's too late. She hurries on, but the hallucinations come thick and fast now -- The trees look almost human, hooded figures peering at her through the haze. She sees owls without eyes. Black oil oozing out of tree trunks. A hanging vine reaches down and touches her like a hand and now she runs -- More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the trees. Huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark, descending on her until she finally passes out. \n52 EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF DARK FOREST -- DAY.(D4N) 52 \nFrom high above, we see the unconscious Snow White as mist whirls in a circle. 52a EXT. CASTLE BEACH - NIGHT.(D4N) 52a Vicious waves crash into rocks. Nature's anger on display. \nBROCH You owe me money from my pocket and money for the girl! \nERIC I have it right here in my pocket. If you'll just help me up. Eric holds his hand out. Broch walks over, suspicious. When he's close, Eric grabs his arm and kicks with both feet in Broch's chest. Broch flies back, then strides to Eric and kicks him in the side. Hurts. \nBROCH I want my money! \nERIC Actually, I seem to have drunk it all. You're welcome to it when it comes out again. Broch hauls him back up to his feet. He takes a swing but somehow the drunken Eric dodges the blow, swinging back at him. Everyone has come out of the Inn to enjoy the fight. Eric lands a body blow to Broch, who doubles over. Eric comes in for the kill, winds up and swings - Missing Broch but hitting a HORSE on the ass. It kicks its legs, sending him flying. He lands in a heap and drops his head back. Hands lift him and -- Drop him in a horse trough. He's underwater for a few seconds before he comes to and lifts out his head, eyes still closed. \nERIC \n(MUMBLING DRUNKENLY) Perfume? He opens his eyes to see Finn gazing down at him. \nERIC Royalty. That explains it. \nFINN The Queen demands your presence. \nERIC Can't you see I'm having a bath? \n56 OMITTED 56 \n57 MOVED TO 55 57 \n27A \n58 INT. THRONE ROOM - CASTLE - DAY. 58 \nRAVENS perch on the ledges and LURCHERS scamper about. Eric, still drunk, filthy, damp clothes, face bruised, enters the room, eyes the ravens, then looks at -- Ravenna on her throne. She watches him curiously. He's more interested in the aged scullery maids, including Rose, who are staring at him accusingly. He has no idea who they are or what he's done wrong. Finally he comes before the Queen, sizing her up like a tavern beauty. \n(CONTINUED) \n58 CONTINUED: 58 \nRAVENNA My brother tells me you are a widower, a drunkard and one of few who has ventured into the dark forest. Finn looks on, standing nearby. \nRAVENNA One of my prisoners has escaped there. \nERIC Then he's dead - \nRAVENNA She. She shoots Finn a pointed look then looks back at Eric. \nERIC Then she is certainly dead. \nRAVENNA Find her. Bring her to me. Eric holds her gaze, uneasy at the request. \nERIC I've been to the Dark Forest enough times to know I'm not going back. \nRAVENNA You will be rewarded handsomely. \nERIC Coin's no good to me if I'm lying dead with crows picking at my eyes. Ravenna steps off her throne now, approaching him. \nRAVENNA There may be more than gold in the offing. \nERIC Why is her life of such value? \nRAVENNA That is none of your concern. \nERIC I'll determine what concerns me, thank you. She smiles, moves even closer to him. \nRAVENNA You will do this for me, Huntsman. \n(CONTINUED) \n28A \n58 CONTINUED: (2) 58 \nERIC And if I refuse? Ravenna nods to the Guards, who pull their swords. Dying to cut him to pieces. Eric eyes them, then looks to her and, in complete honesty -- \n(CONTINUED) \n62-63OMITTED 62-63 \n64 EXT.TREES/ DARK FOREST - DAY. 64 \nSnow White finally shakes free of the vines, jumps up and senses she's being followed. She looks up at the trees but all she sees are vague shadows. The wind picks up, ghostly voices howling in the breeze. She's rooted to the spot for a moment, then loses her nerve and runs -- 64aEXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 64a Eric, Finn and the Guards move through a dark copse of trees. VOICES AND WHISPERS-call to them from the wind. Eric stops, looks around. \n(CONTINUED) \n64a CONTINUED: 64a \nERIC Pay them no mind. One of the Guards leans over a pool of water to drink when he sees a GHOSTLY REFLECTION gazing back at him. He stares in surprise, leaning closer. Suddenly a BARBED TAIL shoots out of the water -- skewering him -- and drags him into the depths. The others turn as they hear a scream but there's no sign of their companion now, just the bubbling water. Only Finn looks unconcerned. Eric stops senses something, holds up a hand. Then darts ahead, leaving them flat-footed. Finn makes a decision to follow and waves for his Guards to go ahead of him. They reluctantly follow Eric. \n65 EXT. DARK FOREST - MOMENTS LATER - DAY. 65 \nEric moves quickly then stops, listens - we see his hunting skills - as he hears the noise of cracking branches in the distance, he blasts away, moving like lightning. \n66 EXT. TREES/ DARK FOREST - DAY. 66 \nSnow White feels like the whole forest is pursuing her. Running out of breath, she hides in some bushes. As she stares into the mist, she sees a sinister figure appear through the haze. Eric stops and looks around, sensing his prey is close. Snow White stays low, trying to quieten her breathing. Eric studies the forest floor. He sees Snow White's footprints, then looks up at an area of disturbed undergrowth. Snow White peers through the bushes and sees the huntsman's boots approaching. She looks around for something to defend herself with when the sound of the footsteps fades. She can't see anyone now. She looks relieved when SUDDENLY STRONG HANDS \nGRAB HER BY THE FEET AND DRAG HER OUT OF THE BUSHES. She fights to get away but he pins her with a foot, reaches down and turns her over. His first look at her gives him pause. Her face, her spirit, her youth. She slaps at him - he pulls out his knife with one hand while he pins her with the other. Then grabs, lifts her. \nSNOW WHITE Let me go! \n(CONTINUED) \n32A \n66 CONTINUED: 66 She bites him. He grimaces and grabs her tighter and starts trudging back. \nSNOW WHITE She's going to kill me! The Oueen! He ignores, keeps moving. \nERIC Sure she is. \nSNOW WHITE Believe me! Her brother tried to cut out my heart. He stops, looks at her. \nSNOW WHITE I swear it. He somehow believes her. New game. Then... \n(CONTINUED) \n66 CONTINUED: (2) 66 \nFINN (O.S.) Quick work! Eric looks up to see Finn and his men approaching. Snow White gasps at the sight of Finn. \nSNOW WHITE Him! He's the one! He came at me with a knife! Eric holds her tight, one arm around her neck. \nFINN Well done, huntsman. Hand her over. \nSNOW WHITE You can't trust him! \nERIC What do you intend to do with her? \nFINN Why do you care? Finn nods and the Guards approach. Eric grips her tighter. \nERIC \n(TO FINN) You want her. Give me what I was promised. \nFINN Come now huntsman, you did your job well. Keep your word and hand her over. \n(CONTINUED) \n66 CONTINUED: (3) 66 \nSNOW WHITE He'll betray you - \nERIC Shut up! - \nSNOW WHITE He'll kill us both - \nERIC Well,it's a long way, through the forest, and that... that's a dangerous road, I couldn't even consider it for less than thirty gold pieces... \nSNOW WHITE A hundred. Deliver me safe to the Duke. I give you my word. \n(CONTINUED) \n36B 67b CONTINUED: (3) 67b Deep quandary. Still suspicious.. \nERIC Who are you? She looks at him levelly. \nSNOW WHITE Maybe that's a question you should have asked the queen. Stand-off. \nSNOW WHITE Do we have a deal? \nERIC I don't trust you Billy Goat. \nSNOW WHITE I've given you my word. He spits on his hand. She puts out her hand. He shakes it. \nERIC I still don't trust you. \nSNOW WHITE I don't trust you either. She wipes it on her skirt. Behind them, a commotion. They run off. \n(CONTINUED) \n67BCONTINUED: (4) 67B 67c OMITTED 67c \n68 OMITTED 68 68a EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 68a Tree roots gleam with an eerie phosphorescent light. The mist closes in. Snow White looks around the forest, unnerved by the haunting silence and the deep shadows. Reluctantly she focuses on Eric, trying to take her mind off the terrors around her. He sits on a log for a breath. \nERIC We'll stay the night here. \nSNOW WHITE You haven't answered me. \nERIC I don't recall a question. \nSNOW WHITE Where are we going? He takes a stick, draws in the dirt. \nERIC Queen. Mountains. Dark Forest. Here. Past. There's a village. She takes the stick, points to a different spot in the dirt. \nSNOW WHITE I'm going to the Duke's Castle. He grabs the stick back. \nERIC You'll go where I take you. \nSNOW WHITE You'll take me to the Duke's castle or I'll go alone. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n37A 68a CONTINUED: 68a SNOW WHITE (cont'd) (beat; looks around) As soon as you get me out of the forest. \nERIC You're rather demanding, and not all that endearing, you know? \n(CONTINUED) \n68a CONTINUED: (2) 68a \nSNOW WHITE There's a reward that awaits you. There are noblemen there, an army. \nERIC \n(LAUGHS) An army? The Duke fights? He hides behind walls. I know sheep that have more fight in them. (after a beat) How much? (off her look) Reward? Just for argument's sake? \nSNOW WHITE How much do you want? Eric considers this, not sure how or if to negotiate. \nSNOW WHITE Two hundred gold pieces. Do we have a deal? More, a lot more, than he was expecting. \nERIC I'll deliver you to safety m' lady. \nSNOW WHITE Swear it. \nDUKE HAMMOND And I cannot afford to lose my only heir! You do not know the dark forest! \nWILLIAM Then I'll find someone who does. William pulls away. \nWILLIAM I will not abandon her a second time. \n74 EXT. PLAINS BEYOND DUKE HAMMOND'S STRONGHOLD - DAWN. 74 \nWilliam gallops away from the castle walls under the cover of the breaking dawn. 75 MOVED TO 68a 75 \n76 OMITTED 76 \n77 OMITTED 77 \n78 EXT. STABLES/ INN/ VILLAGE - DAY 78 \nA motley crew of woodsmen stand side to side. Finn is eyeing them, sizing them up, picking a crew. \nFINN Which of you knows the dark forest? A powerfully built Yakut tracker, ALDAN, and BROCH both nod. \nFINN You. You. You. You. He's selected Aldan, Broch and points to others. As we move down the line we see -- William, hat low, trying to look tough. Finn selects a few more. \nFINN Load and prepare. You ride for bounty. Into the dark forest. The rest of you. Away ! As they disperse.. William sets his jaw, and heads off.. \nCUT TO: The men ride out of the village. Suddenly they stop. Standing up ahead is William, blocking their path. He calls to them. \nWILLIAM You need a bowman? FINN calls back. \nFINN I have a bowman. Away. WILLIAM stands unblinking. \nFINN I said away, damn you! WILLIAM doesn't move. Finn turns to the bowman. \nFINN Kill him. \n(CONTINUED) \n41A \n78 CONTINUED: 78 The bowman smiles, draws his bow. BEFORE he can loose an arrow: \nTHWACK! THWACK!! Two arrows strike the bowman in the throat, lifting him off his horse, stone dead. FINN turns. WILLIAM lowers his bow. \nWILLIAM I said do you need a bowman? Finn studies William with dead eyes. \n79 MOVED TO 80A 79 \n80 OMITTED 80 \n(CONTINUED) \n80 CONTINUED: 80 80aEXT. VILLAGE ROAD - DAY. 80a In the pouring rain, a group of fierce BOUNTY HUNTERS ride on horseback, when another rider appears, blocking their way. It's William. \n(CONTINUED) \n80a CONTINUED: 80a \nBROCH Clear the road. But William doesn't budge. One of the other mercenaries grins, then rides towards William, drawing his sword. He raises it when William unslings his bow and loosens two arrows at close range, hitting him in each thigh and knocking him off his horse. Broch draws his enormous battle axe, about to charge, when Finn rides forward and stops him. \nFINN Wait! Finn sizes up William. \nFINN You're quick with a bow. \nWILLIAM I want to ride with you. \nFINN Why? \nWILLIAM You are paying well and I need the coin. \nFINN Have you traversed the Dark Forest? \nERIC Now hold it - business end pointed at me. \nSNOW WHITE Why are you?-- He lunges at her and she raises the blade. \nERIC Which is your lead foot? \n(CONTINUED) \n46A 83b CONTINUED: 83b \nSNOW WHITE What do you mean? \n(CONTINUED) \n83b CONTINUED: (2) 83b He jumps at her again and she puts her right foot forward, knife in right hand pointed. He starts to slowly move toward her. One step at a time. \nERIC Now stay back. You're too small to attack. You have to parry; use your opponents strength against him. Raise your opposing forearm. She does. He comes closer. \nERIC With it you block and deflect an opposing thrust. You'll lose meat but you won't die from it. Wait until I'm close. He steps forward. \nERIC Not yet. Watch my hands, not my eyes. He moves even closer. \nERIC Not yet. Not until you can feel my breath. He moves right up to her. \nERIC Now. Their faces are inches apart. \nERIC This close. Drive it through me. To the hilt. Now look in my eyes. \n(SHE DOES) Don't pull it out 'til you see my soul. Their eyes are still locked. \nSNOW WHITE Why do I need to learn how to kill? He looks at her. \nERIC There's a lot you need to learn lass. Eric backs away. \nERIC Keep that. She nods, now-focused on him in a way other than as an instructor. He turns and walks away. \n(CONTINUED) \n83b CONTINUED: (3) 83b \nSNOW WHITE Where are you going? \nERIC Fumee. \n84C EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 84C \nA single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree. Ravenna, looking weaker than before, stares at it quietly, as if she were gazing at Snow White. She reaches out and crushes the blossom in her hand, turning it into ash. Her look is one of conviction. \nRAVENNA Find her. \n85 MOVED TO 10A 85 \n86 MOVED TO 13A 86 \n87 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 87 \nFinn reacts as if he heard Ravenna's words. He did. They have that kind of connection. Spooked, he continues on. The other trackers follow, William looking tense. At the back of the group, one of the mercenaries slows down, sensing something in the forest. William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling CRY behind them. The mercenary's horse gallops out of the trees without its rider, a gaping wound in its side. William and the others look shaken but Finn doesn't even turn around, riding on. 87a EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 87a Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens -- the bridge LEADS OUT OF THE DARK FOREST -- and birds circling on the distant horizon. Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope. They hurry through a sea of mist when suddenly Eric stops. \nSNOW WHITE What is it? \nERIC It can't be this easy. He quietly unsheathes a hatchet. \nSNOW WHITE Is this the end of the Dark Forest? \nERIC (not paying attention) Uh-huh. \n(CONTINUED) \n87a CONTINUED: 87a \nERIC I don't know, but keep smiling. A beautiful LITTLE GIRL, LILY, moves away from her friends and offers her hand. Snow White stops, looks down at the girl, trying not to stare at her scar. 90-93a OMITTED 90-93a 93b EXT. BANKS OF THE LAKE/ FENLAND VILLAGE - DAY. 93b Eric sits by the lake, ANNA bandaging his wounds. \nANNA You have travelled far Huntsman. With a heavy burden. Snow white is playing with Lily. They are making little dolls from straw. \nERIC I've had worse jobs. And anyway, she's not that heavy. \nANNA You mean... you do not know who she is? His eyes narrow. \nERIC What do you mean? He looks over. \n(CONTINUED) \n52aA 93b CONTINUED: 93b \nERIC Who is she? \nACROSS THE WAY Snow White draws eyes upon the doll. Snow White's eyes fill with tears. \nLILY My father showed me how to make them. But he's gone away. Lily takes a stick and marks the dolls face with a scar.. \nLILY Here. She's finished. She hands it to her. \n(CONTINUED) \n52A 93b CONTINUED: (2) 93b \nSNOW WHITE She's beautiful. Lily smiles and runs off to play. Behind her Eric appears. \nSNOW WHITE These women... This place.. It's very peaceful. But it makes me very sad. \nERIC Why didn't you tell me? She stops. She knows. \nERIC Because I'd think it too fell a task? You'd be right. She looks at him. Shakes her head. \nSNOW WHITE That's not why. It's because I've never said the words. She looks at Lily playing. \nSNOW WHITE I'm not sure I believe it myself. I never felt like a.. (She stops.) Alone in a dark cell. For years. Fighting to cling to memories. What he looked like. Smelled like. The kind man with the big arms and the wonderful smiles.. To me.. he wasn't The King. He was my father. Eric doesn't know what to say. In time, he reaches in his pocket. \nERIC Here. \nSNOW WHITE What is it? \nERIC I've carried it a long time. \nSNOW WHITE What is it made of? \nERIC Gristle from a stag's heart. (off her look) \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n52B 93b CONTINUED: (3) 93b \nERIC (CONT'D) The stag's the most timid animal in the forest but there's a bone in it's heart that gives it courage in it's hour of need and makes it the bravest in of all God's creatures. It's a protection charm. \n(HE SHRUGS) Or so they say. They share a look. \nSNOW WHITE Was it hers? It's the most honest and emotional he's been with her. \nERIC Take it. She does. \nSNOW WHITE Thank you, huntsman. He looks at the sky. \nERIC It's getting dark. He walks away. \n(CONTINUED) \n93b CONTINUED: (4) 93b \n(TO ANNA) Run! Snow White faces off with the Mercenary. She does as she's been taught - waits for him to approach. When he's close enough to grab her slashes at him with the knife. The huge mercenary knocks her to the ground and advances on her. -- when an arrow strikes him in the shoulder. He falls, revealing a young warrior holding a bow. It's WILLIAM. Snow White stares at him through the flames, with a mixture of recognition and uncertainty. It's as if for a moment everything stops as she comes \nFACE TO FACE With something from the past. Almost like a ghost. Or a vision.. He nods to her in recognition. She stands perfectly still. \nSUDDENLY Anna pulls Snow White away, as they move through the smoke and the fire. William starts to follow, a curtain of smoke swirling around him. \n113 EXT. FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT. 113 \nEric arrives to see the village in flames. He rushes to the centre of the village, pulling a mercenary off his horse and running him through with his own sword, then fighting and killing TWO MORE MERCS as he makes his way forward. \n55aA \n114 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT. 114 \nFinn sits astride his horse like a demon king in the firelight. He spots William in the distance, searching for Snow White and rides toward him. \n55A \n115 EXT. FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT. 115 \nSnow White looks back through the distant flames as she runs, when suddenly powerful arms grab her. She flails with the knife but it's only Eric -- \n(CONTINUED) \n115 CONTINUED: 115 \nERIC Come on! \nSNOW WHITE We must help them! Anna sees Snow White fighting off Eric and shouts -- \nANNA You will! Go! Eric holds her firmly, pulling her away against her will. \n116 OMITTED 116 \n117 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT. 117 \nWilliam jumps on his horse again, looking for Snow White through the clouds of billowing smoke. Finn and Aldan ride up. \nFINN Have you seen her? \nWILLIAM No, my lord. Finn spits fury and continues to race around, frantic. \n118 EXT. MARSHES OUTSIDE FENLAND VILLAGE/ LAKE - NIGHT. 118 \nEric pulls Snow White onwards, the blazing fires from the village lighting up the marsh. He sees a lake up ahead when a figure appears, blocking their way. It's the giant BROCH. Grinning, he unstraps his huge axe, ready to face Eric one more time. Eric doesn't even slow down, letting go of Snow White and unstrapping his own hatchets. It looks as if it's going to be an epic fight, but as Broch swings, Eric ducks and drives both hatchets into the giant's ribs, killing him instantly. They escape into the darkness. \n118A OMITTED 118A \n118B INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT. (MOVED FROM 84A) 118B \nRavenna walks up the spiral staircase. She passes an old woman who glances at her. She walks past a few steps, thinks she hears a whisper, then turns on a heel. \nRAVENNA What did you say? Then she's right in her face -- \nRAVENNA \nWHAT DID YOU SAY! The \"old woman\" just stares at her, shakes her head. There's something in the woman's eyes that terrifies Ravenna. She backs up, retreating, then scurries away. \n118C INT.ANTE ROOM - ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT (MOVED FROM B4B). 118C \nRavenna sits alone, naked. Her spine stretches through her taut skin. In front of her sits the CROWN on a dark cushion, a matted tuft of HAIR caught on the gilded edge. She stares at it, then slowly raises her hand to a bald patch at the side of her hair. \nRAVENNA \nFINN!!!!!!!!! The word echoes in the palace -- \n119 EXT. FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT 119 \nFinn, surrounded by smoke and fire, is beyond frustration. He screams to the heavens in despair. \nGUS Nothing, Miss. It's just... you been the prettiest thing I ever did seen. He smiles, almost sweetly, disarming her. Snow White looks at her other captors now, noticing a blind dwarf, (MUIR), who sits with his son (QUERT), also gazing at her. \n(CONTINUED) \n124a CONTINUED: (3) 124a \nERIC Just tell me what I've done wrong? \nBEITH Tell me what you've done right first? \nERIC I saved this girl from the Queen. Out of the goodness of my heart. Snow White gives him a look. He calms her with a look of his own. \nBEITH Doesn't sound like you, huntsman. \nERIC People change. \nNION People, not ruttish swine. Nion gives Eric another smack around the head. \nMUIR Quert? Quert jumps to and helps his father as he makes his way to Snow White. He touches her face and something happens in him. His demeanor softens and the hint of a smile lands on his lips. Meanwhile... \nGORT So what's the verdict? \nCOLL Leave 'em to rot. \nDUIR Yeah. Or skewer him and leave her to rot! \nCOLL That would work, too, but my way's cleaner. Note: Coll and Duir have this \"at each other but we're comrades\" relationship. Coll also has an incessant cough. \nMUIR No! (a beat for emphasis) She is destined. They all trade looks. Muir is the spiritual leader of the group and they dare not speak against him, even Beith. \nGORT Destined?... \n(CONTINUED) \n124a CONTINUED: (4) 124a \nGUS \n(SMITTEN) She is. \nBEITH Are you? \nSNOW WHITE Do you hate the Queen? \nBEITH Hate's a strong word. \n(BEAT) But not strong enough in this case. \nSNOW WHITE My father was King Magnus. This carries weight with the group. Impressed. \nMUIR No one listens to me. \nSNOW WHITE If you accompany us to the Duke's castle you will be paid handsomely. \nERIC We don't need their help. \nBEITH You were already lost seeing that you found us. \nGORT How handsomely? \nSNOW WHITE Your weight in gold. Each of you. The dwarves trade glances, literally sizing each other up. \nERIC That's more than you offered me?! \nBEITH Goodness of your heart, eh, Huntsman? \nDUIR (whispers to Coll) I get more than you. \nCOLL True, but because of your size you eat and drink more, which costs more, so... \nGUS Aye! The other Dwarves trade looks. Nion, the last, shrugs. As Snow White strokes the hart's neck, the golden light brightens, engulfing her. \n-- SUDDENLY AN ARROW FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- AND PIERCES THE \nWHITE HART'S FLANK. The HART roars in pain and bolts. The fairies and animals scatter in all directions now, their sanctuary violated. Eric looks up to see ALDAN the Yakut emerging through the trees on horseback, notching another arrow to his bow. A FIERCE WIND rips through the sanctuary now, shadows spreading where there was once light. Eric sees FINN appear on horseback, looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness. The huntsman grabs his axe. So do the dwarves, pulling on their battle masks. WILLIAM emerges through the trees to see ALDAN aiming his bow at Snow White. He rides into the Yakut's horse, knocking him off balance just as he fires -- The arrow narrowly misses Snow White, thudding into a tree. Gus grabs her by the hand. \nGUS Come on! He runs with her into the forest. Aldan turns on William furiously, drawing his curved sword, but before he can swing the dwarves attack both men -- Eric only has eyes for Finn. They stare at each other in the roaring wind, then Finn gallops into the forest after-Snow White Eric RUNS in the same direction -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) William fends off the furious dwarf attack then rides off in pursuit of snow white -- Aldan sees him but is too busy defending himself against COLL and DUIR to give chase -- \n132 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 132 \nAll around the forest the shadow of death is spreading. Gus runs, dragging Snow White behind him. Galloping through the trees, WILLIAM spots them up ahead, riding faster. \n133 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 133 \nBow and arrow at the ready, Eric runs after Finn. All around him the forest is darkening. He follows the sound of galloping hooves when suddenly they stop. He stops too, notching an arrow to his bow, peering into the gloom and listening. There's a tense silence, then SUDDENLY HE HEARS A NOISE. He spins around, ready to fire, when he sees it's only Finn's riderless horse galloping past -- He realizes too late that it's a trick -- FINN EXPLODES OUT OF THE DARKNESS, catching him a glancing blow with his sword -- \n134 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 134 \nColl and Duir leap up at Aldan, trying to drag him off his horse, but he's a ferocious fighter, driving them both back -- \n135 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 135 \nWilliam spots Snow White up ahead. She disappears into the trees and he rides faster. She erupts from behind a branch and pulls him off his horse. Gus races over and raises his axe -- \nSNOW WHITE Gus, no! Gus's axe stops inches from William's eyes. Snow White recognizes the young warrior, staring at him in surprise. \nSNOW WHITE I saw you at the village. William looks up at her, out of breath: \nWILLIAM It's me. William. Snow White stares in disbelief, tears of surprise welling in her eyes. Gus looks even more confused, lowering his axe. William slowly rises to his feet, gazing back at Snow White, when THEY HEAR A TWIG SNAP -- Gus hears it too, spinning around -- \n(CONTINUED) \n135 CONTINUED: 135 -- To see ALDAN with an arrow notched to his bow -- \nGUS \nPRINCESS! Gus launches himself -- and takes the arrow meant for Snow White. Before Aldan can load another arrow -- William fires an arrow of his own, striking him in the chest. The Yakut topples over, dead at last but still astride his horse. Snow White falls to her knees in anguish, cradling the dying Gus. He smiles weakly, holding her gaze, then whispers: \nGUS I shan't leave you, Miss. \n136 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 136 \nEric charges into Finn with a cry of rage. Finn deflects the blow and hurls him back into the trees. Driven by fury, Eric charges again, but Finn uses his anger against him, ducking under the vicious blow and landing a brutal one of his own -- Eric crashes into another tree. His eyes are still full of hatred but his body is weak. Finn smiles in contempt from a few yards away. \nFINN I captured many girls, but your wife was special. \nERIC What?! \nFINN She fought and then she begged. For her life. Please?!!! You should know she called for you. Your Sara. \nERIC How do you know her name?! Eric is shocked, desperate. \nFINN She told me. Just before I slit her throat. \n-ERIC Bastard... .- Eric notices a fallen TREE TRUNK behind Finn -- dead branches STICKING UP LIKE SPIKES. Finn steps toward him... \nFINN Now you can look for her in the other world and beg for her forgiveness. \n(CONTINUED) \n71A \n136 CONTINUED: 136 Finn smiles and raises his sword for the death blow -- when ERIC LUNGES. He throws himself at Finn, his momentum carrying them both into THE DEAD TREE'S SPIKED BRANCHES -- The branches pierce Finn's body, their tips digging into Eric's flesh. Finn howls in agony -- \n137 OMITTED 137 \nSNOW WHITE Leave him, huntsman. He's our friend. He glares but his eyes glisten with tears. Snow White is still bowed over Gus's body, sobbing, mourning. The prayer chant ends. Nion spits with anger and walks away. \nNION We need to convene. They all follow him a few steps away, where they have privacy. \nBEITH What is it, Nion? \nNION This is what happens when dwarves mix with men. We always come out worse. We have big hearts and we'll fight for any cause -- but for what? For some new Queen to call us runts and turn us out of our homes again? \nGORT I've nothing against the girl, but I'm not willing to risk my life for her either, like poor Gus. Beith considers quietly, the other dwarves listening too. \nDUIR (whispers to Coll) Does this mean we're not fighting the Queen? \nCOLL \n(WHISPERS BACK) Not sure yet. \nQUERT What about the gold he promised us? \nNION What use is gold if you're dangling by your bony neck, you jackdaw?! \nBEITH Aye, the Queen will flay us alive for helping her! \n(CONTINUED) \n144 CONTINUED: (2) 144 \nMUIR The White Hart blessed the girl. Nion shakes his head and rolls his eyes, but Beith listens. \nMUIR Even our own legends speak of the redeemer who will heal the land. \nGORT That little mutton? \nMUIR All the lions and wolves in the kingdom have tried to defeat the Queen and failed. Why not a mutton? The dwarves stare at him incredulously. \nNION Gus lost his life because of her! \nMUIR No. He gave his life for her. As will I if necessary. Look at us. Look at what we've become. They trade looks. They know where he's going with this. \nMUIR We were once proud, now we pilfer and drink and dream of when we didn't. I am willing to die for a chance at becoming the man I once was. And that is the last word. Quert puts his arm around his father and kisses his forehead. Beith and Gort trade a nod and a smile. \n145 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 145 \nQUERT sings a CELTIC MELODY OF LOSS as Gus is laid out on a funeral pyre. All around him, THE BRIGHT COLORS OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST HAVE FADED and there are no animals and fairies to be seen. It's as if Ravenna's shadow has passed here too. The tough, battle hardened dwarves shed tears like children. Snow White looks heartbroken as Beith lights the pyre. As the flames rise, a HAUNTING LAMENT carries us into the next scene --- \n146 OMITTED 146 \n147 EXT. HILLS - DAY. 147 \nQuert's SONG CONTINUES as the group make their way across the barren hills and into the mountains -- \n148 EXT. HIGHLAND HILLS - DAY. 148 \nWilliam walks alongside Snow White, glancing at her tentatively. He waits until the others are out of earshot. \nWILLIAM I'm sorry I left you. She looks over and sees the remorse in his eyes. \nSNOW WHITE You didn't. \nWILLIAM If I'd known you were alive I would have come sooner. \nSNOW WHITE We were children, William. You're here now. They reach some steep rocks and Eric turns around, offering Snow White his hand. She takes it and he helps her up the slope. William looks on, feeling jealous. Beith follows Duir and Coll up to the summit of the hill, then looks at the surrounding peaks. \nBEITH We'll rest the night at the top of this hill. 148a INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - ROYAL PALACE - DAY. 148a From above - Ravenna stands in the center of the room, surrounded by ravens. She raises her arms and they take flight, circling above her. She lowers her arms and their swirling pattern lowers, until she is completely surrounded by them - a tornado of ravens. She has become them, and they her. \n149 EXT. CAMP SITE/ MOUNTAINS - NIGHT. 149 \nA FIRE CRACKLES. The dwarves have set up camp. Coll and Duir sit on a rocky outcrop, Coll braiding Duir's hair while Duir sharpens his axe. \nCOLL That's not how you sharpen an axe. You sharpen downward. Not upward.. \nWILLIAM The same way you led me when we were children. I followed you everywhere. Ran when you called. I would have done anything for you. She looks touched by his words, smiling softly, trying to make light of them. \nSNOW WHITE That's not how I remember it. \nWILLIAM No? \nSNOW WHITE No... They gaze into each other's eyes, close enough to kiss. \nSNOW WHITE I remember we were always arguing. And fighting. And... She trails off, lost in his gaze. He stops, leans closer and kisses her gently. They stay like that a moment, then William pulls away, holding something in his hand. Snow White smiles as she sees that it's an APPLE. With a mischievous smile, William holds out the apple for Snow White, just like he did when they were children. \nSNOW WHITE I remember this trick. \nWILLIAM (With mock innocence) What trick? Snow White holds his gaze, then snatches the apple from him before he can take a bite, raising it to her lips with a smile. As she bites -- 150b OMITTED 150b 150c OMITTED 150c 150d EXT. CAMP SITE/ MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150d. Eric, startled,- awakens. \n150e EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150e As Snow White chews, a flicker of a smile crosses William's face. Snow White stares curiously, then suddenly gasps, struggling to breathe -- 150f EXT. CAMP SITE/ MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150f Eric stands up, looks around, dwarves still asleep. He shakes William, who wakes at the ready. They walk into the trees and follow -- \nA SINGLE SET OF TRACKS. 150g EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150g Snow White staggers back and collapses in the snow, choking from poison. Her eyes water and her vision blurs. The false William kneels beside her and slowly she sees Ravenna's features burning through, her cold blue eyes gleaming in \nTRIUMPH -- A SCREAM fills the air -- not Snow White but dozens of birds shrieking in the sky above -- \n151-157 OMITTED 151-157 \n158 EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY. 158 \nEric and William hear the panicked bird cries and run -- 158a EXT. SILVER BIRCH TREES/ MOUNTAINS - DAY. 158a Snow White's limbs are petrified, frost spreading across her cheeks -- but her eyes are open, taking in everything. Ravenna leans over her, smiling. \nRAVENNA You see, child, love always betrays us. A sigh escapes Snow White's lips, condensing into steam. \nRAVENNA By fairest blood it was done and only by fairest blood can it be undone. You- were the only one who could break the-spell and end my life, and the only one pure enough to save me. She draws away, unwrapping her sacramental dagger. \nRAVENNA You don't realize how lucky you are, never to know what it is to grow old. \n(CONTINUED) \n158a CONTINUED: 158a She raises the knife, about to cut out Snow White's heart - \nWHEN SUDDENLY HER BODY SHATTERS INTO A FLOCK OF SHRIEKING \nRAVENS -- And now we see the HUNTSMAN STANDING THERE, AXE IN HAND, THE \nRAVENS FLAPPING AROUND HIM -- William blasts with a sword at the screeching birds -- Eric goes after her now, swinging his twin hatchets. The ravens scream and pluck at his eyes but he hacks at them fiercely, William joining in, until the shrieking birds finally take to the sky and vanish on the horizon. Eric and William rush to Snow White's side now. The dwarves arrive too, hurrying through the snow. William cradles Snow White in his arms, trying to revive her, but it's no use. Eric stares in dismay as he sees the poison drain the color from her lips. He kneels down and gazes at her. William turns to the dwarves. \nWILLIAM What are you looking at? Help her! The dwarves stare back at him gravely but don't respond. He's desperate now, irrational -- \nWILLIAM You are dwarves, healers, save her! He grabs the blind seer, MUIR, shaking him. \nWILLIAM Do something! Muir stares back at him with his empty eyes, tears glistening in them. William collapses in prayer, the light in Snow White's eyes almost gone. Eric looks over, sees William's grief is as great as his own, and finally stops fighting. Snow White looks up at William as if she wants to say something, then the light in her eyes goes out. The dwarves are heartbroken. Eric looks dazed. William leans down and kisses Snow White gently on the lips. He pulls away,.hoping against hope. And then -- Nothing happens. She lies there, lifeless and white as the falling snow. On all the faces - realizing that she is truly gone. \n(CONTINUED) \n81A 158a CONTINUED: (2) 158a \nGORT What do we do? \n(CONTINUED) \n158a CONTINUED: (3) 158a \nBEITH What we promised. \n159 OMITTED 159 \n160 EXT. ROYAL CASTLE - DAY 160 \nA flock of ravens whips across the sky, swooping into -- \n161 INT. MIRROR ROOM - DAY. 161 \nThe ravens burst into the mirror room and \"crash\" to the ground. Their swirl becomes -- Ravenna, on all fours, looking worse for wear, surrounded by dead ravens. The effort depleted her. She GROWLS as she crawls toward the mirror. \nColl and Duir wade through the sewage, their axes held up in front of them, not a flicker of emotion on their faces. \nDUIR Seven dwarves against an army. \nCOLL I like them odds. Behind them, Beith covers his nose from the stench, Gort and Nion look like they're about to be sick, and Muir and his son bring up the rear, the brown slime almost at Quert's mouth. \nQUERT Times like this I wish I was taller. \n183 EXT. SAND DUNES OVERLOOKING RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 183 \nCrashing waves break against the rocks, washing over the sand. Duke Hammond stares at the RISING TIDE in concern. \nDUKE HAMMOND We don't have much time. \n(CONTINUED) \n183 CONTINUED: 183 \nSNOW WHITE Then we should ride now. They'll have the portcullis up by the time we arrive. Duke Hammond considers, then raises his sword. Snow white glances at the huntsman. He breaks rank and rides closer to her. There's a tense silence, then the Duke BRINGS DOWN HIS SWORD and his riders charge down the dunes. \n184 EXT. BALCONY - RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 184 \nRavenna stares out confidently, her eyes still fixed on Snow White's distant banner. \n185 EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAWN. 185 \nThe trap door in the courtyard rises and we see Beith's head pop up, his expert eyes scanning the courtyard until they spot the portcullis. Ravenna's guards hurry past without seeing him, taking their positions on the battlements. Beith slips back down into the sewer. \nBEITH The gatehouse is fifty yards away to left. Half a dozen guards and fifty armed soldiers. Archers on either side. \nDUIR (Pulling out a huge knife) Give us a couple of minutes. \nCOLL Four tops. \n186 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 186 \nSnow White rides across the dunes. All around her, riders gallop along the surf, waves crashing around them. Ravenna's castle comes into the view, the portcullis still down. \n187 EXT. COURTYARD/ CASTLE - DAWN. 187 \nColl and Duir move stealthily through the busy courtyard, so small and fleet they're almost invisible. \n188 EXT. BALCONY/ RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 188 \nRavenna looks on as her archers take their positions and her artillery men load missiles onto their trebuchets. \n189 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 189 \nSnow White suddenly sees tiny dots of firelight on the castle walls. Eric realizes what they are and rides faster. The pinpoints of light soar up in the air, growing larger and brighter, until we realize they're FIERY MISSILES. Eric forces Snow White's horse out of the way as a fireball explodes yards from her. \n(CONTINUED) \n189 CONTINUED: 189 Fire rains down on the Duke's army now, panic spreading in the ranks. Snow White takes her father's banner and holds it aloft, rallying the men and riding on. \n190 EXT. GATEHOUSE - DAWN. 190 \nTwo unsuspecting guards collapse outside the gatehouse. Before the other guards can react, Coll and Duir are on them, moving fast and hard, the assault over in seconds. \n191 EXT. SEWER MANHOLE/ COURTYARD - DAWN. 191 \nBeith sees Coll and Duir signal from outside the gatehouse. \nBEITH Come on! \n192 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 192 \nWaves crash over the rocks. Fireballs explode in the sand. Snow White sees men falling all around her, tears welling in her eyes, but she never falters. As William rides on, he sees the castle walls through the smoke, the portcullis still down. \n193 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 193 \n207 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY. 207 \nSnow White storms into the throne room. She is breathing heavily, a mix of fear and determination. \nKNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK The raven claw ring, taps, resonating through the halls. Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs, the mirror room behind her. Snow White approaches. \nSNOW WHITE It ends today... I have come for YOU! \nRAVENNA \n(MOCKINGLY) My rose has returned (looking at Gus' small sword) .with a thorn! 207a OMITTED 207a \n(CONTINUED) \n207a CONTINUED: 207a \n208 OMITTED 208 \n209 OMITTED 209 209a INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY. 209a Eric, William and a dozen men rush in. Ravenna smiles, raises her hand. \nRAVENNA I'll show you thorns! In a terrifying tremor, the black ceiling of the throne room starts to shatter into millions of shards. Snow White turns back to see William, Eric and Hammond's men - the shards fall down like razor blades. The men try to protect themselves. Some are caught out and skewered to the stone floor. Ravenna looks down at them in complete satisfaction. \nThe millions of black shards circle around Eric and his men, completely blocking them and keeping them away from Snow White. \nRAVENNA Come! ... Avenge your father, who was too weak to raise his sword. The millions of shards assemble themselves into three seven foot tall, razor sharp creatures. The DARK FAERIES: Ravenna's ultimate soldiers. Snow White looks at Eric and William - unable to help her. \n(CONTINUED) \n209a CONTINUED: 209a Eric, William and the other men are completely surrounded by these creatures; they move so fast. Eric tries to step away from them... to no avail. One of the creatures rises in front of William. William tries to slash the creature. His sword goes through and the creature reforms itself right away. The Dark Faerie opens it's mouth and screeches. William gets smashed aside, saved only by his shield. The Dark Faerie grabs the soldier right behind William and sends him crashing into the wall. Snow White walks up the stairs, torn and powerless. She looks at Eric one last time. Eric looks back as he fights off a Dark Faerie with his two shields. He knows he does not have much time left but he is ready to make the final sacrifice. \nERIC (battle cry!) Kill her! 209b INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 209b Snow White braces herself and promptly follows Ravenna into the mirror room. Now Snow White is exactly where Ravenna wants her to be. The two women circle each other like heavyweight boxers. \nSNOW WHITE Ten years you locked me away! Ravenna seems to relish this. \nRAVENNA And every day, every hour led you to this ,moment. It burned inside you. It drove you forward, and here you are.. Listening only to her heart, Snow White lunges towards Ravenna and tries - strikes at her with her sword. Ravenna steps aside and with very little effort - throws her to the other side of the room. \nRAVENNA That's it. Fight. Fight for your land... for your loss and for Hope! \n(CONTINUED) \n96A 209b CONTINUED: 209b Snow White slams and slides across the floor, she stops under the archway at the top of the stairs. She is dazed. Ravenna treads on her back, then grabs her hair, pulls her head up to see William and his men being massacred. \nRAVENNA Watch them die. You gave them hope and they believed you. You have lead them to their deaths. How foolish your followers. \n209c INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME - DAY 209c Eric is trying to stay alive. He rams a Faerie into a pillar. Shredding the stone, the Faerie explodes in shards and reforms immediately behind Eric. Grabbing the first man in sight, the Faerie throws the poor soldier to the other side of the room. on the opposite side another Faerie slides faster than the blink of an eye, grabs the man in flight extending it's cutting limbs and claws the soldier to his death. It is like carnage in slow motion. 209d OMITTED 209d 209e MOVED TO 209B 209e \n210 INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME - DAY. 210 \nWilliam is being overrun by a school of shards. The shards shape up into a Faerie taking William up high. In a violent arm blow, the Faerie projects William onto the banquet table six feet lower. The table shatters in splinters, William bouncing like a rag doll. Spinning around on it's way down, the Faerie skewers a soldier and impales another one into a pillar. The Faerie drags him ten feet up, tearing and digging deep into the stone column. \n211 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 211 \nEnraged, Snow White jolts her body and frees herself from Ravenna's grasp. She swings her sword at Ravenna. She parries every attack with her bare hands. Snow White is breathless. One more strike... but Ravenna blocks it again, and this time she doesn't let go. \n(CONTINUED) \n97A \n211 CONTINUED: 211 \nRAVENNA (face to face with Snow White) You were never ready for this princess! Snow White struggles to get out of her lock. Ravenna is too strong. Snow White's wrist is twisted. She holds her sword tight but can't use it. Ravenna forces the twist. Her fragile bones crack. Snow White screams in pain. The sword drops on the ground. \nSNOW WHITE \n(GRUNTING) I will... defeat... you... I am the only... \nRAVENNA Oh... please! Ravenna back hands Snow White, sending her crashing to the wall. SLAM! Cuts on her face. Ravenna looms closer, through the fire in the middle of the room. She stands IN the fire, unaffected. For Snow White it is a vision of pure hell. So much power, so much hate. \nRAVENNA I have lived many lives. Ravaged entire kingdoms, I have been given powers you can't fathom. You cannot defeat ME? .you are but a child! \n", "test1_input": "ROSE I don't know, princess. Rose shakes her head, still gazing at Snow White, then hears the distant cries of other female prisoners. \nROSE What will they do to me? \n33 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 33 \nRavenna sweeps into the great hall. The Generals and Finn snap to attention. She stops and stares at TWO MEN, the captured insurgents. THOMAS, a grizzled old rebel, looks badly bruised and beaten, while his handsome son, LAIN, is unmarked. They both stare at her defiantly. Ravenna faces the two rebels. A SOLDIER steps forward. \nSOLDIER My Queen, these two were captured leading an ambush of our supply caravan. Ravenna seems intrigued, steps forward, eyeing them. \nRAVENNA You left your home, your family, the bosom of my protection, to aid my enemies? Why? \nTHOMAS Because under your rule we have lost everything. We will not stop until this kingdom is free. \nRAVENNA Lost everything? \n(REGARDS IAIN) Your son? She moves to Iain, right up to his face. \nRAVENNA Very handsome. \n(TO THOMAS) Obviously a debt owed to your wife. She reaches out and touches Iain's strong jaw. He struggles against the Guards that hold him back. \nRAVENNA There was a time I would have lost my heart to a face like yours -- and you would have no doubt broken mine. In a flash Iain grabs a Guard's dagger and rams it into Ravenna's chest. She makes a pained face, looks down at the dagger, then up to Iain. \nRAVENNA You would kill your Queen? She pulls the dagger out - there is no\"wound, no blood - and drops it on the ground. Iain and Thomas are shocked. \n(CONTINUED) \n33 CONTINUED: 33 \nRAVENNA (admiring; to Iain) You have beauty. And courage. But how strong is your heart? She smiles, almost regrettably, then places her hand on his chest. We hear HIS HEART START TO HAMMER -- LOUDER AND LOUDER. He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling his ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead. Thomas falls to his knees in horror, trying to revive his son. Finn draws his sword to behead him when Ravenna raises her hand. \nRAVENNA No. Let him return to the Duke and speak of the generosity of his Queen. With that she sweeps out, followed by Finn. It's only now that we see the lines on her face. Finn takes her by the arm as she falters. \nFINN Are you alright? Ravenna pulls her arm away furiously. The General and the others stare, alarmed. \nRAVENNA \n(TO ALL) \nOUT!!!!! They quickly exit, all save Finn, who watches, concerned, as Ravenna leans against the wall for support. She pulls herself together, looks at Finn. \nFINN Magic comes at a lofty price. \nRAVENNA And the expense grows. \nFINN You look... \nRAVENNA old?... \nFINN Tired. \nRAVENNA My powers... fade. This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber. Then he turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE. A GUARD appears and Finn nods. \n33a INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - ROYAL PALACE 33a Ravenna walks into the room. Eyes the mirror, afraid to look at herself. \nFINN (O.S.) I have something for what ails you. She turns to see -- Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles. Rose holds her gaze defiantly. Ravenna walks over, admires her face, smiles, then takes her by the throat and -- LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET. Rose opens her mouth to scream but instead of sound, ENERGY pours out. Ravenna opens her mouth, DEVOURING GRETA'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Like a flower blooming, her lines vanish. Like a flower wilting, Rose AGES until she's as old as the scullery maids. \n34 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL 34 \nSnow White hears approaching footsteps and watches as a Guard opens Greta's cell and tosses someone in. \nSNOW WHITE Rose?...

It was wise to have kept her close for the innocence and purity that can destroy can also heal. Hold her heart in your hands and you shall never again need to consume youth. You shall never again weaken or age. Immortality without cost! Ravenna laughs, overjoyed. Finn appears out of the shadows. All he sees is his sister laughing, giddily into her mirror, no sign of the mirror man, as if it exists only in her head. \nFINN Yes, Queen?... \n36-37OMITTED 36-37 \n38 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL - DAY. 38 \nSnow White paces in her cell, frantic. Two magpies appear in the window. She looks at them and watches as they flap their wings. Like they're trying to tell her something. She moves toward them. They jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside the cell window, hovering there. She is confused but notices -- A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover. Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the loose nail. Her fingers move it back and forth as it, bit by bit, breaks free. She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when -- The Magpies flutter again and blast away, as if afraid -- \n(CONTINUED) \n38 CONTINUED: 38 Snow White hears FOOTSTEPS down the hall. She steadies herself, yanks once, twice and the nail comes loose. she jumps down, lies in her bed again just as -- Finn unlocks her door, leaving the key in the lock, and walks into the cell. He stands there until she turns her head slightly to him. She doesn't move, grips the nail in her closed hand as she tries to lure him closer with her eyes. \nFINN Did I wake you? Snow White shakes her head gently. \nFINN Are you always awake when I watch you? \nSNOW WHITE \n(HOARSELY) Yes. She looks away. \nSNOW WHITE You've never come in before. \nFINN My Queen won't allow it. She wants you all to herself. \nSNOW WHITE I'm afraid of her. \nFINN Not of me. \nSNOW WHITE No. He can't help himself, reaches out and touches her arm. \nFINN It's alright, princess. You will never again be locked in a cell. \nSNOW WHITE What does she want from me? His finger move from her hair to her cheek, stroking it gently, and then to her chest.

The two of them smile then join in the singing. A drunken GORT takes a swig of ale and staggers over to GUS. \nGORT Play louder, you whey-face, I can still hear those harpy fairies. He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice, out of tune, trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies. Snow White and the huntsman look on, smiling. \nERIC Legend has it dwarves were created to uncover all the riches hidden on earth. Not just gold and precious stones, but the beauty in people's hearts. \nSNOW WHITE Really? \nERIC Ask me, they've lost the art if they ever had it. When the Queen seized their mines she stole their treasure but more than that she stole their pride. And as if to prove it, GORT and NION sing and share from a flask of rum before they tumble to the ground-near Muir as the song ends.

Gort and Nion eye her. \nSNOW WHITE Thank you so much, sir. \nMUIR It's only a log, no need to praise me. \nSNOW WHITE No. For before. For defending me. \nMUIR Your father was a good man. The kingdom prospered. Our people prospered. \nSNOW WHITE There were more of you? \nMUIR Aye. And that is all Muir will say on the subject. Gort fills in. \nGORT One day the group you see before you went down into the mine for a month long shift. Gus was only a boy. When we came back to the surface... nothing. The land was black, everything, everyone... dead, gone. We searched but... Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit. Muir helps out. \nMUIR That was the month your father died. \nSNOW WHITE I'm so sorry. \nMUIR As am I, princess. As am I. GUS walks over to Snow White. \nGUS I know I'm a bit spongy to look at, Miss, but would you care to dance-with a little 'un? \nSNOW WHITE I'd be honored. Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up. \n(CONTINUED) \n130 CONTINUED: (3) 130 Nion and Gort watch her dance with Gus.

Gort is still melancholy... \nGORT Just you and me,... do you think there are any of us left? Do you think perhaps they were merely banished? \nNION As long as the Queen's in charge we'll never know. \nGORT Well, maybe that's the point, isn't it? (beat; out of the blue) I feel funny.

If I had any sense I'd have abandoned her long ago. Beith eyes Eric as he watches Snow White dance. \nBEITH Muir says she's destined. Question is, huntsman, for whom? Gus and Snow White are still dancing. \nGUS (As Snow White treads on his toes) You don't mind me saying, you got two left feet for a princess. \nSNOW WHITE I don't mind at all, Gus. I haven't danced in a long, long while. She feels eyes on her - turns to see the huntsman watching her with a slight smile. She smiles back and breaks away. \nSNOW WHITE Do you mind, Gus? \nGUS Not at all. Snow White walks over to the Huntsman, holds out her hand. \nSNOW WHITE You've taught me to fight, surely I can teach you to dance. Eric trades a look with Beith, who nudges him on.

Snow White sits amazed, drinking in the sights and sounds. Animals emerge from the forest -- SQUIRRELS, BEAVERS, FOXES, BIRDS. Slowly they make their way towards the ruins, gazing at Snow White. \nTHE NIGHT SHIMMERS WITH FAIRY LIGHT AS THEY OBSERVE HER. Snow White feels the light on her face and to her surprise, she sees the two MAGPIES who watched over her at the castle. Two BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the magpies' bodies, beaming at her. As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE. As she walks animals fall in alongside her. A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light crosses his face and he wakes up. As he opens his eyes, he stares in wonder, then quickly wakes the other dwarves. They all stare in amazement now, even the blind MUIR. Eric is the last to wake up, wondering what the fuss is all about. They rise and follow to -- \nAT THE TREE She stands BENEATH THE GIANT TREE, facing a MAJESTIC WHITE HART. The air around the mystical creature shimmers with a golden light. \nBEITH No one's ever seen it before. The excited Muir grabs his son Quert by the arm. \nQUERT The white hart bows before the princess, father. Sure enough, the HART lowers its head before Snow White.

I will defend them with my last drop of blood but I will not abandon these walls. I cannot afford to believe in miracles. He suddenly stops as the SHOUTS outside the tent get louder. He goes to the flap, opens it to see -- Snow White , still dressed in her white funeral robes, stands at the top of the stairs that leads down into the courtyard. 171a EXT. COURTYARD - DUKE HAMMOND'S CASTLE 171a Everyone comes out of their tents and stands beneath Snow White. Her heart pounding, she makes her way down the stairs. All are riveted by the sight of her, as if they're looking on an angel or a living miracle. Eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he, too, is stunned as he slides in next to the dwarves in the crowd. \nBEITH It's a miracle! Duke Hammond, embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of her, walks up the stairs to greet her. Several Generals follow him but stay a few steps below them. Hammond takes her by the hands as they speak. \nDUKE HAMMOND Your highness... (He can't believe his eyes) We thought you... \nSNOW WHITE No, my lord. William, below, stares at her in joy while his father still looks dazed. \n(CONTINUED) \n171a CONTINUED: 171a \nDUKE HAMMOND You must rest - \nSNOW WHITE I have rested long enough. Her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction. \nSNOW WHITE I am ready to ride by your side, my lord, when you face the Queen in battle. The Duke looks speechless for a moment. \nDUKE HAMMOND There will be no battle, your highness. The best thing you can do for your people is stay safe behind these walls. \nSNOW WHITE That is all I thought to do when I escaped. But I have come to learn there is no peace while others suffer. Have you not learned that? \nDUKE HAMMOND The Queen cannot be defeated. She cannot be killed. And therefore there can be no victory. Snow White hesitates, her heart pounding, then replies: \nSNOW WHITE I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the only one. She told me so herself. Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now her feet, lead her down the stairs to her people. When she reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks... \nSNOW WHITE I have been told that I represent you, that it is my place to inspire you. That is wronct. I am not a Queen, not a leader, not a warrior. Absolute silence in the courtyard as people, lords, knights hang on her every word. \nSNOW WHITE You represent me, who I've become - your hopes,: your courage, your will - inspires me. \n(BEAT) I have also been told my place is not to fight but to stay here, safely behind these walls. I will not. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n86A 171a CONTINUED: (2) 171a SNOW WHITE (cont'd) I hold life sacred, even more since I've tasted freedom, but I've lost my fear of death. \n(CONTINUED) \n171a CONTINUED: (3) 171a Heads nod, people murmur approval. She has them in the palm of her hand. \nSNOW WHITE If Ravenna comes for me, I will ride to meet her. And if she doesn't, I will ride to meet her. (looks back at Generals) Alone if I must. (back to people) But if you would join me, I will gladly give my life for you. For this land and its people have lost too much. Eric and the dwarves couldn't look prouder. Duke Hammond stares at her for a moment, then BOWS. A beat, then William follows, then all the Lords and Knights. His eyes fixed on Snow White, Eric bows too. Then Beith. Then Muir and his son, Quert. Then Coll and Duir. And finally even Gort and Nion.

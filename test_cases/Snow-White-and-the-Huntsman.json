{"test1_input": "62-63OMITTED 62-63 \n64 EXT.TREES/ DARK FOREST - DAY. 64 \nSnow White finally shakes free of the vines, jumps up and senses she's being followed. She looks up at the trees but all she sees are vague shadows. The wind picks up, ghostly voices howling in the breeze. She's rooted to the spot for a moment, then loses her nerve and runs -- 64aEXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 64a Eric, Finn and the Guards move through a dark copse of trees. VOICES AND WHISPERS-call to them from the wind. Eric stops, looks around. \n(CONTINUED) \n64a CONTINUED: 64a \nERIC Pay them no mind. One of the Guards leans over a pool of water to drink when he sees a GHOSTLY REFLECTION gazing back at him. He stares in surprise, leaning closer. Suddenly a BARBED TAIL shoots out of the water -- skewering him -- and drags him into the depths. The others turn as they hear a scream but there's no sign of their companion now, just the bubbling water. Only Finn looks unconcerned. Eric stops senses something, holds up a hand. Then darts ahead, leaving them flat-footed. Finn makes a decision to follow and waves for his Guards to go ahead of him. They reluctantly follow Eric. \n65 EXT. DARK FOREST - MOMENTS LATER - DAY. 65 \nEric moves quickly then stops, listens - we see his hunting skills - as he hears the noise of cracking branches in the distance, he blasts away, moving like lightning. \n66 EXT. TREES/ DARK FOREST - DAY. 66 \nSnow White feels like the whole forest is pursuing her. Running out of breath, she hides in some bushes. As she stares into the mist, she sees a sinister figure appear through the haze. Eric stops and looks around, sensing his prey is close. Snow White stays low, trying to quieten her breathing. Eric studies the forest floor. He sees Snow White's footprints, then looks up at an area of disturbed undergrowth. Snow White peers through the bushes and sees the huntsman's boots approaching. She looks around for something to defend herself with when the sound of the footsteps fades. She can't see anyone now. She looks relieved when SUDDENLY STRONG HANDS \nGRAB HER BY THE FEET AND DRAG HER OUT OF THE BUSHES. She fights to get away but he pins her with a foot, reaches down and turns her over. His first look at her gives him pause. Her face, her spirit, her youth. She slaps at him - he pulls out his knife with one hand while he pins her with the other. Then grabs, lifts her. \nSNOW WHITE Let me go! \n(CONTINUED) \n32A \n66 CONTINUED: 66 She bites him. He grimaces and grabs her tighter and starts trudging back. \nSNOW WHITE She's going to kill me! The Oueen! He ignores, keeps moving. \nERIC Sure she is. \nSNOW WHITE Believe me! Her brother tried to cut out my heart. He stops, looks at her. \nSNOW WHITE I swear it. He somehow believes her. New game. Then... \n(CONTINUED) \n66 CONTINUED: (2) 66 \nFINN (O.S.) Quick work! Eric looks up to see Finn and his men approaching. Snow White gasps at the sight of Finn. \nSNOW WHITE Him! He's the one! He came at me with a knife! Eric holds her tight, one arm around her neck. \nFINN Well done, huntsman. Hand her over. \nSNOW WHITE You can't trust him! \nERIC What do you intend to do with her? \nFINN Why do you care? Finn nods and the Guards approach. Eric grips her tighter. \nERIC \n(TO FINN) You want her. Give me what I was promised. \nFINN Come now huntsman, you did your job well. Keep your word and hand her over. \n(CONTINUED) \n66 CONTINUED: (3) 66 \nSNOW WHITE He'll betray you - \nERIC Shut up! - \nSNOW WHITE He'll kill us both - \n", "test1_true": "ERIC \n(TO FINN) I'll keep my word when the Queen keeps hers. Finn shakes his head and laughs. \nFINN You are a drunk and a fool. My Queen has many powers; she can take life or sustain it. But she can't bring your wife back from the dead. \nERIC \nI WANT HER BACK! His face tells us how much Eric wanted, needed to believe. The Guards keep inching toward Eric. Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts slowly backing up. Finn pulls his own sword and approaches. Four against one. As they burst toward him he tosses Snow White to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife into the chest of one of the Guards, who crumbles. Eric reaches behind, grabs both hatchets and faces off with the others. They all rush at once. Eric fights off the guards as he raises a hatchet, throws it -- Right into Finn's chest. Just like Ravenna, no blood, no wound. Finn pulls it out, laughs and throws it at the huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree. Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest. They notice her exit but keep fighting. Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn manages to plunge a sword in his side. \n(CONTINUED) \n66 CONTINUED: (4) 66 Eric grunts and falls back. Finn races forward to finish him off but Eric lunges and -- Flips Finn onto his back and into a grove of mushrooms. Eric covers his nose with his arm and looks at the other Guards, who look from Finn, who is dazed, to Eric, who is hurt. Finn struggles to his knees, shakes his head, hallucinating a bit. \nFINN Butcher him! Find her! The Guards, also trying to cover their noses, move forward. Eric has a decision to make. Bad odds. And he's injured. Eric decides in an instant, grabs his knife out of the dead Guard, as well as his hatchet from the tree and runs after Snow White -- \n67 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 67 \nSnow White crashes through the woods. Then a HAND grabs her shoulder-- Eric. He slaps a palm over her mouth before she can scream and slides down a steep slope into undergrowth. 67a EXT. DARK FOREST - FINN - SAME 67a Finn is on his feet but still hallucinating - stumbling about. The Guards are spooked as they look all around. \nFINN This is not finished! The words echo through the dark forest. 67b EXT. DARK FOREST - ERIC AND SNOW WHITE - SAME 67b Eric removes his hand from Snow White's mouth. At once she PUNCHES HIM WITH ALL SHE'S GOT. He steps back, licks his bloody lip. She takes another swing. This one he manages to grab. \nSNOW WHITE Get your hands off me. She draws his dagger. He backs off. Eyeball to eyeball: \n(CONTINUED) \n67b CONTINUED: 67b \nSNOW WHITE Get away. \nERIC Who are you? What the hell's going on? \nSNOW WHITE Get away from me. \nERIC Why does the Queen want you dead? \nSNOW WHITE She wants us all dead. All of us- \nERIC Then what makes you so damn valuable? \nSNOW WHITE You should know. You're the one hunting me. He backs away. Paces. \n(CONTINUED) \n36A 67b CONTINUED: (2) 67b \nERIC \n(TO HIMSELF) Never get involved in the Queen's business and what do I do? Get involved in the Queen's business... Without warning, he walks off. Leaving her alone. She follows him. \nSNOW WHITE Where are you going? \nERIC Away from you, love. You're trouble. \nSNOW WHITE I need to get to the Duke's Castle. There's an army there. I'll be safe. \nERIC The Duke? I've seen sheep with more fight in them. Desperate, she takes a chance. \nSNOW WHITE Take me, you'll be rewarded. I'm valuable. Isn't that why you're here? \nSHE APPEALS: \nSNOW WHITE You're dead if you return without me. And I'm dead if you leave me. He turns, exasperated with her. \nERIC (Then -- wearily:) Just for argument's sake. (Shakes his head) How much? \nSNOW WHITE How much is enough? Eric \"reluctantly\" prices up the job. \n", "test1_id": 1269, "test2_input": "(TO ANNA) Run! Snow White faces off with the Mercenary. She does as she's been taught - waits for him to approach. When he's close enough to grab her slashes at him with the knife. The huge mercenary knocks her to the ground and advances on her. -- when an arrow strikes him in the shoulder. He falls, revealing a young warrior holding a bow. It's WILLIAM. Snow White stares at him through the flames, with a mixture of recognition and uncertainty. It's as if for a moment everything stops as she comes \nFACE TO FACE With something from the past. Almost like a ghost. Or a vision.. He nods to her in recognition. She stands perfectly still. \nSUDDENLY Anna pulls Snow White away, as they move through the smoke and the fire. William starts to follow, a curtain of smoke swirling around him. \n113 EXT. FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT. 113 \nEric arrives to see the village in flames. He rushes to the centre of the village, pulling a mercenary off his horse and running him through with his own sword, then fighting and killing TWO MORE MERCS as he makes his way forward. \n55aA \n114 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT. 114 \nFinn sits astride his horse like a demon king in the firelight. He spots William in the distance, searching for Snow White and rides toward him. \n55A \n115 EXT. FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT. 115 \nSnow White looks back through the distant flames as she runs, when suddenly powerful arms grab her. She flails with the knife but it's only Eric -- \n(CONTINUED) \n115 CONTINUED: 115 \nERIC Come on! \nSNOW WHITE We must help them! Anna sees Snow White fighting off Eric and shouts -- \nANNA You will! Go! Eric holds her firmly, pulling her away against her will. \n116 OMITTED 116 \n117 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT. 117 \nWilliam jumps on his horse again, looking for Snow White through the clouds of billowing smoke. Finn and Aldan ride up. \nFINN Have you seen her? \nWILLIAM No, my lord. Finn spits fury and continues to race around, frantic. \n118 EXT. MARSHES OUTSIDE FENLAND VILLAGE/ LAKE - NIGHT. 118 \nEric pulls Snow White onwards, the blazing fires from the village lighting up the marsh. He sees a lake up ahead when a figure appears, blocking their way. It's the giant BROCH. Grinning, he unstraps his huge axe, ready to face Eric one more time. Eric doesn't even slow down, letting go of Snow White and unstrapping his own hatchets. It looks as if it's going to be an epic fight, but as Broch swings, Eric ducks and drives both hatchets into the giant's ribs, killing him instantly. They escape into the darkness. \n118A OMITTED 118A \n118B INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT. (MOVED FROM 84A) 118B \nRavenna walks up the spiral staircase. She passes an old woman who glances at her. She walks past a few steps, thinks she hears a whisper, then turns on a heel. \nRAVENNA What did you say? Then she's right in her face -- \nRAVENNA \nWHAT DID YOU SAY! The \"old woman\" just stares at her, shakes her head. There's something in the woman's eyes that terrifies Ravenna. She backs up, retreating, then scurries away. \n118C INT.ANTE ROOM - ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT (MOVED FROM B4B). 118C \nRavenna sits alone, naked. Her spine stretches through her taut skin. In front of her sits the CROWN on a dark cushion, a matted tuft of HAIR caught on the gilded edge. She stares at it, then slowly raises her hand to a bald patch at the side of her hair. \nRAVENNA \nFINN!!!!!!!!! The word echoes in the palace -- \n119 EXT. FENLAND VILLAGE - NIGHT 119 \nFinn, surrounded by smoke and fire, is beyond frustration. He screams to the heavens in despair. \n", "test2_true": "121 EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY. 121 \nEric and Snow White are far down river. They make their way to the bank, drenched and exhausted. Snow White's hands shake - distraught over the violence at the village. Eric looks at her guiltily. \n(CONTINUED) \n57A \n121 CONTINUED: 121 \nSNOW WHITE Why did you come back? \nERIC I led them there. I am to blame. Snow White looks at him with empathy. He's in pain, too. \n(CONTINUED) \n121 CONTINUED: (2) 121 \nERIC I will take you to Duke Hammond's. Snow White slowly nods. Eric lies back and looks up at the sun flickering through the trees. It dances on his face and then -- A HUGE SHADOW blots out the light. Before he can react, fists and boots lay into him. As he protects his face, we catch glimpses of brutal figures in battle masks. Eric kicks a couple of them away, but more of them swarm over him, pinning him down in leg locks and choke holds. Snow White is treated just as roughly, powerful arms and legs pinning her down. She bites one of her captors and he twists her arms behind her back. A noose is slung around Eric's ankles and he's hauled up - hanging upside down. Snow White, also tied up, sits on the ground beside him. A line of DWARVES stand before them and pull up their grotesque BATTLE MASKS. The dwarf leader, Beith glowers. \nBEITH Well, well, well... the miscreant huntsman. \nERIC Come on, Beith! Is this how you treat a friend? The dwarf leader, BEITH, glowers. \nBEITH No, you horn beast, this is how I treat a friend! He smacks Eric with a gnarled stick. \n122 MOVED TO 84C 122 \n123 OMITTED 123 \n124 OMITTED 124 124a EXT. WOODS - LATER - DAY. 124a Snow White and the huntsman are still trussed up like chickens now. The dwarves are grouped together, arguing and occasionally throwing angry glances toward Eric. As they bicker the dwarves slap and bite at each other - like animals. \n(CONTINUED) \n124a CONTINUED: 124a \nSNOW WHITE \n(WHISPERS) What did you do to them? \nERIC I tried to collect the bounty on their heads. A few times. \nSNOW WHITE Is there no one you haven't wronged? Eric nods at her. \"You.\" \nERIC But there's always tomorrow. \nGORT Shut it, you hedge pig. The Dwarf confab breaks up and they approach. \nBEITH This is my lucky day, the puttock I loathe most in the world lands in my lap. \nERIC It is your lucky day, Beith. I've got enough gold to keep you in ale for a year. Cut me down and I'll -- NION, Beith's right hand man and a fervent dwarf supremacist, clips Eric around the ear. \nNION Shut your ugly mug, huntsman. You had any pennies they would have fallen out your pockets by now. \nERIC It's hidden. Back there, in the woods. A short distance. They get the reference, don't like it. Nion slaps Eric again. \nNION Pull the other one, you lying dangler. \nSNOW WHITE Tell them the truth, huntsman. The youngest of the dwarves, GUS, is beaming at Snow White with his dirty teeth. \nSNOW WHITE \n(FIERCELY) What are you looking at? \n(CONTINUED) \n59A 124a CONTINUED: (2) 124a \n", "test2_id": 1270, "test3_input": "GUS Nothing, Miss. It's just... you been the prettiest thing I ever did seen. He smiles, almost sweetly, disarming her. Snow White looks at her other captors now, noticing a blind dwarf, (MUIR), who sits with his son (QUERT), also gazing at her. \n(CONTINUED) \n124a CONTINUED: (3) 124a \nERIC Just tell me what I've done wrong? \nBEITH Tell me what you've done right first? \nERIC I saved this girl from the Queen. Out of the goodness of my heart. Snow White gives him a look. He calms her with a look of his own. \nBEITH Doesn't sound like you, huntsman. \nERIC People change. \nNION People, not ruttish swine. Nion gives Eric another smack around the head. \nMUIR Quert? Quert jumps to and helps his father as he makes his way to Snow White. He touches her face and something happens in him. His demeanor softens and the hint of a smile lands on his lips. Meanwhile... \nGORT So what's the verdict? \nCOLL Leave 'em to rot. \nDUIR Yeah. Or skewer him and leave her to rot! \nCOLL That would work, too, but my way's cleaner. Note: Coll and Duir have this \"at each other but we're comrades\" relationship. Coll also has an incessant cough. \nMUIR No! (a beat for emphasis) She is destined. They all trade looks. Muir is the spiritual leader of the group and they dare not speak against him, even Beith. \nGORT Destined?... \n(CONTINUED) \n124a CONTINUED: (4) 124a \nGUS \n(SMITTEN) She is. \nBEITH Are you? \nSNOW WHITE Do you hate the Queen? \nBEITH Hate's a strong word. \n(BEAT) But not strong enough in this case. \nSNOW WHITE My father was King Magnus. This carries weight with the group. Impressed. \nMUIR No one listens to me. \nSNOW WHITE If you accompany us to the Duke's castle you will be paid handsomely. \nERIC We don't need their help. \nBEITH You were already lost seeing that you found us. \nGORT How handsomely? \nSNOW WHITE Your weight in gold. Each of you. The dwarves trade glances, literally sizing each other up. \nERIC That's more than you offered me?! \nBEITH Goodness of your heart, eh, Huntsman? \nDUIR (whispers to Coll) I get more than you. \nCOLL True, but because of your size you eat and drink more, which costs more, so... \n", "test3_true": "124a CONTINUED: (5) 124a \nBEITH Alright, we'll take you, but the huntsman can hang - \nSNOW WHITE Both of us. Eric looks surprised by her loyalty. So do the dwarves. Suddenly Duir calls out: \nDUIR Riders! The dwarves look round to see a DOZEN SILHOUETTED HORSEMEN appear on the crest of a DISTANT HILL. \nERIC Those are the Queen's men, Beith, better decide quickly. \nBEITH One dwarf's worth a dozen tallsters, I'll take my time thank you -- He suddenly stops as dozens more RIDERS appear on the hill. \nERIC You were saying? \nBEITH Cut him down! MOVE OUT! Nion roughly cuts the line and the Huntsman drops to the ground as Gus gently lifts Snow White. They all hurry down the hill. \n125 OMITTED 125 \n126 EXT. ROCKY HILL/ CAVE - DAY. 126 \nThe dwarves and their captives arrive at a rocky outcrop. Duir and Coll pull back a large root exposing a cave entrance. \nERIC Ah, a short cut. All 8 dwarf heads spin at him - pissed off. Enough with the short jokes. Nion raps Eric's knee with the flat of his dagger. \nERIC Owww!!! Gus cuts Snow White loose. \n(CONTINUED) \n62A \n126 CONTINUED: 126 Nion hesitates, then reluctantly frees the huntsman. DUIR and COLL lead the way into a cave. Gus pulls Snow White to safety just as the enemy riders appear. \n127 INT. CAVE COMPLEX - DAY. 127 \nFrom their hidden vantage point, Eric, Snow White, and the dwarves watch the riders searching for them. Some gallop on, but a small troop remain behind. Realizing they have no choice but to retreat further, Duir and Coll signal and the dwarves follow them deeper into the cave system. \n128 INT. CAVE - DAY. 128 \nA shaft of light pours through the cave roof high above, BATS circling. The dwarves move effortlessly down the labyrinth but Snow White and the huntsman have to squeeze through the cracks. \n129 EXT. SANCTUARY - DAY. 129 \nSnow White and the huntsman emerge from the cave to see a shimmering landscape of glistening moss and sunlight. It's like a mirage. The air is filled with specks of pollen and a strange HUMMING NOISE echoes like music. For Snow White, it's the most beautiful sound she's ever heard. Next to her, Nion, snorts: \nNION Blasted fairy music. Wish I had some wax to stuff my ears. \nGORT There's plenty of moss. GORT scoops up a handful of moss and moulds himself some ear plugs, sticking them in his ears. Snow White is still mesmerized by the fairy music and the shimmering haze. \nSNOW WHITE What is this place? The huntsman looks just as dazzled. \nGUS They call it Sanctuary, my lady. The Enchanted Forest. It's the home of the fairies. And slowly the hazy curtain gives way to an enchanted forest -- as different to the dark forest as one could imagine -- Life grows everywhere -- LUSH GRASS, PROUD TREES COVERED IN \nBUTTERFLIES, BUBBLING STREAMS, MOSS COVERED TORTOISES, FOXES AND \nRABBITS SIDE BY SIDE, EXOTIC FLOWERS AND EVERYWHERE THE LIFE- \nGIVING POLLEN-- Snow White sees tiny figures flying behind the trees -- almost too fast to spot -- the pollen following them in long trails -- \nGUS Fairies. \nGORT Pests. Of the other dwarves, only the blind MUIR seems to appreciate the beauty around him, enjoying the vibrations on his face. \nBEITH set up camp. \n130 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - SUNSET. 130 \nHEARTY, SOULFUL SINGING. Seated among the ruins, the dwarves sing a Celtic ballad as old as time, GUS playing the fiddle. Coll and Duir sit away from the others, gazing out with the thousand yard stare of hardened war veterans. \n", "test3_id": 1271}

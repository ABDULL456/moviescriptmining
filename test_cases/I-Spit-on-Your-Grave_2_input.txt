The reservoir is much calmer at these parts. Sheriff stands on watch as- Stanley and Andy come from the water in waders having just searched the water. Matthew stands where they just came from. He stays, staring at the swamp like water as if Jennifer was somewhere in there. Johnny finishes off a cigarette and flicks it.

ANDY Nothing. Not a damn thing. 
JOHNNY Well, what now? Storch takes another look down the river, scanning it. 
SHERIFF STORCH The body'll turn up. One way or another. Every day we check the ravine, from the bridge, straight through down here, then back. Two shifts a day until we find something. 'Cause with no body, you're all as fucked as she is. 
STANLEY For how long? 
SHERIFF STORCH 'Til I say! Okay?! Andy, you go back to the cabin and get rid of her shit. All of it! Burn it. And we need to sanitize that place something good. I don't want so much as a stray hair left. 
(TO JOHNNY) Get her car to the shop. Strip it down to its last damn nut. 
JOHNNY I'll buff out the serial numbers too. Sell the parts at salvage. Storch nods in approval as his eyes wander to the camera. 
SHERIFF STORCH .and give me that. Sheriff Storch rips the camera from Stanley's hands. He pulls out the tape. He throws the tape to the ground and stomps on it, smashing it to bits. Stanley opens his mouth to say something, thinks better of it, and closes it quickly. 
SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) The fuck were you saving that for moron? 
(BEAT) Swear to Christ.

SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) I need all you on point. I mean, on fuckin' point. We clear? 
(BEAT) Now let's go, we got shit to do. Matthew continues to stare off into the distance, waist deep in the water. 48 ER's. WOODS - DUSK 48 CLOSE UP on a match. Dirty fingers pull the match across the flint on the side of a matchbox. The match explodes to life. A hand drops the match on top of Jennifer's belongings: her clothes, laptop, the dry goods she purchased at the store. It's all piled up on the grass. Johnny, Stanley, and Andy watch quietly as the flames and smoke from the fire reach into the sky. Andy throws a metal container of gasoline onto the ground. 
ANDY So that's everything. Right down to her little tit sling. 
JOHNNY And there was no trace at all? Nothing in the woods? In the shallows? Andy shakes his head. Stanley rubs his eyes hard. 
STANLEY I'm starving, man. 
JOHNNY Well ain't that the headline. Soon as we finish this and haul her car into the garage, you can stuff your face 'til you puke. 
(TO ANDY) What the hell happened to Matthew? 
ANDY Idiot wanted to stay there. He was walking around in the water, looking for her like some crazed dog after a bone. 
JOHNNY Jesus Christ. He's not playing with a full deck as it is.

JOHNNY (CONT'D) The last thing we need is him getting squirrelly on us. (looks at the two of them)

JOHNNY (CONT-D) We all got to make sure he keeps it together, okay?

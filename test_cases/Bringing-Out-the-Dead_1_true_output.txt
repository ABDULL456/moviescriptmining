FRANK (CONT'D) That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime. 
NOEL Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy. (heads for the next car) Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series. 
Noel hauls back, lays into a Volvo: glass shatters. Noel holds the bat out, extends handle towards Frank: 
NOEL (CONT'D) Here, you try. 
FRANK No, I'd better not. 
NOEL Sure, sure, give go. 
FRANK Yeah? 
Frank, intrigued by Noel's suggestion, has forgotten Walls' plan. He takes the bat as Tom sneaks behind Noel, crouching. 
FRANK (CONT'D) What the hell. (spits into hands) The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate. 
NOEL Oh man, Bucky. 
FRANK The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster. 
Frank cocks the baseball bat, relishing every moment, swings into the Volvo's side window. Shattered glass flies on his hands and clothes. 
Walls, fed up with this, stands: 
WALLS Frank, what the hell are you doing? 
Noel, seeing Walls, grabs the bat, flees down an alley. 
WALLS (CONT'D) You go down those stairs there. Meet me back here if you can't find him in ten minutes. Call out if you see him. Get with the program, Frank. 
Walls takes off after Noel. Frank, taking out his flashlight, enters second alley, walks down dark stairs which hopefully circle around to Noel. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ALLEY--NIGHT 
Mini-flashlight leading the way, Frank steps gingerly down the refuse-strewn alley. Ahead: footsteps. 
He kicks something, thinking it's trash, looks down; a body rustles, pair of sleeping eyes look up. 
Suddenly everything seems silent. He passes a row of glowing red doors. Shadows flash in the distance. He hears a woman crying, shoots his flashlight her direction: nothing. 
Frank hears the voice again: Rose's voice: 
ROSE'S VOICE Why did you kill me, Frank? 
FRANK I didn't mean to. 
ROSE'S VOICE You should have helped me. 
FRANK I tried to help. I wanted to. 
Shadows like hands extend against the wall ahead. 
ROSE'S VOICE Don't you love me? 
Frank moves toward the reaching arms. The shadows swing like baseball bats. Noel SCREAMS. 
Suddenly, before him, a blurry mass of bloody dreadlocks-- Noel goes flying to the ground, Walls standing over him swinging the bat, hitting him, killing him. 
WALLS I got him, Frank!

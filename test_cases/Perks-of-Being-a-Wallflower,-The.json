TUNNEL - NIGHT                                             1 \nThe titles begin over black. We hear the sound of an old typewriter. Someone reaching out to us. The bell dings, announcing the end of a line, and we see our title... \nTHE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER \nMusic begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city. Downtown Pittsburgh. Looking out of the back window like a child in the back of a station wagon. \nWe see lights on buildings and everything that makes us wonder. We see the bridge. And the river below. And then we enter... \nThe Tunnel. \nWe keep moving backwards, watching the lights. Golden, alive, and hypnotic. The music carries us as we float out of the tunnel. Onto another bridge. And over the highway. \nWe move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a window, and into... \n2   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  2 \nIt is a neat and tidy little room. Few posters or books. CHARLIE is 15. He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable to everyone but his classmates. He sits at his desk, writing a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the radio on his cassette boom box. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend, I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I don't want you to do that. I just need to know that people like you exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't think I was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you nervous. \n3   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                            3 \nCharlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban split level house. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) I hope it's okay for me to think that. You see, I haven't really talked to anyone outside of my family all summer. \nCharlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football game. Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine. Charlie waits for them to notice him. And waits. And waits. \n4   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      4 \nCharlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) But tomorrow is my first day of high school ever, and I really need to turn things around this year. (hopeful) So, I have a plan. \n5   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LAST DAY                      5 \nWe see it in Charlie's mind. Slow motion and wondrous. The kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in the air like a New York confetti parade. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) As I enter the school for the first time, I will visualize what it will be like on the last day of my senior year. \nCharlie walks down the hall.   Triumphant.   Confident.   Happy. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Unfortunately, I counted, and that's... \nSMASH CUT TO: \n6   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - FIRST DAY                     6 \nReality. The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from Charlie's POV. A SENIOR BULLY leads the ritual, making dozens of freshmen hop down the hall. \nSENIOR BULLY Hop, freshman toads. Hop!    Move it, boys! \nAs seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) ... 1,385 days from now. \nVARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS pass, wearing their letter jackets. \nLINEBACKER Man, you got big. \nNOSE TACKLE Worked out all summer.   Rock hard, dude. \n", "test1_true": "BRAD HAYS Would you guys get a room? \nThey laugh. Charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them. Trying to make himself as small as possible. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) (trying to be optimistic) Just 1,385 days. \n7   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                  7 \nCharlie moves down the lunch line with his sister. CANDACE KELMECKIS is 17 and a beautiful type A, straight A priss. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek would have let me eat lunch with their earth club. \nCANDACE Seniors only. (barks to Derek) What are you doing with a plastic spork? \nCandace turns to her boyfriend, DEREK, 17. Derek is such a pussy, the most masculine thing about him is his pony-tail. \nDEREK I don't want to bring back silverware-- \nCANDACE Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer. \nDerek takes the silverware like a beaten dog. Charlie watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria. \n8   INT. CAFETERIA - LATER                                           8 \nCharlie sits in the corner alone, observing everyone having a great time with their friends. He sees a pretty girl with blonde hair having the best first day. This is SUSAN, 14. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) When my sister said no, I thought maybe my old friend Susan would want to have lunch with me. \nCharlie catches her eye and waves, but she looks away. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) In middle school, Susan was very fun to be around, but now she doesn't like to say hi to me anymore. \nCharlie turns his attention to the quarterback, Brad Hays. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And then there's Brad Hays, who's the quarterback of our team. Before my brother went to play football for Penn State, he and Brad played together. So, I thought maybe he'd say hi to me. But Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so... who am I kidding? \nBrad catches Charlie staring at him.   Awkward. \n9   INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY                                           9 \nCharlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) On the bright side, one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead of the freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's legendary goatee with a grease pencil. \nMeet PATRICK (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over high school. He is the class clown, performing a perfect imitation of the teacher, Mr. Callahan. \nPATRICK Boys, the prick punch is not a toy. I learned that in 'Nam back in '68. \"Callahan,\" the sergeant said, \"put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks.\" \nThe laughter suddenly dies as the real MR. CALLAHAN (57) walks up behind the oblivious Patrick. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) But you know what happened? That prick punch killed my best friend in a Saigon whorehouse. \nPatrick suddenly feels Mr. Callahan behind him.   Oops. \nMR. CALLAHAN I heard you were going to be in my class. Are you proud being a senior taking freshman shop, Patty-Cakes? \nPATRICK My name is Patrick. You call me Patrick or you call me nothing. \nMR. CALLAHAN Okay... Nothing. \nThe class laughs. Except Charlie.   He watches Patrick take the long walk back to his seat. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't saying the impersonation to be mean or anything. He was just trying to make us freshmen feel better. \nMR. CALLAHAN Everyone open your safety guides. Nothing... why don't you read first? \nPatrick opens the book. \nPATRICK Chapter 1. Surviving your fascist shop teacher, who needs to put kids down to feel big. (to the class) Oh, wow. This is useful guys. We should read on. \nCharlie smiles.   He loves him already. \n10   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING                                    10 \n", "test1_id": 1218, "test2_input": "PATRICK (CONT'D) I mean, I have no idea. This collection of presents is so gay that I think I must have given them to myself. But despite that distinct possibility, I'm going to have to go with... drum roll... Charlie. \nCharlie holds up his hands.     Yay!   They all cheer. \nSAM Alright, Charlie... it's your turn. \nCharlie and Patrick switch places.       Charlie stands. \nCHARLIE Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth. \nPATRICK Huh.   Now, why do you say that? \nCHARLIE I don't know. She bosses people around sometimes. \nThe gang cracks up.   Mary Elizabeth is pissed. \nMARY ELIZABETH What the hell is wrong with you? \nCHARLIE Sorry. \nPATRICK Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually... me. \nCHARLIE You got me clothes?     Why? \nPATRICK Because all the great writers used to wear great suits. Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve into our facilities. Emerge a star. \nCharlie gives Sam a sack of presents. \nCHARLIE Can you hand these out while I'm gone? \nMARY ELIZABETH Wait a second. There's only secret santa presents. There are rules, Charlie. \nPATRICK Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas? Hand them out, Sam. \nSam gives out the presents. The group rips them open. Alice looks at a book about Martin Scorsese with the inscription... \nALICE \"Alice, I know you'll get into NYU.\" \nAlice turns to Mary Elizabeth who holds up a card with... \nMARY ELIZABETH 40 dollars. (reads card) \"To print Punk Rocky in color next time.\" \nBob blows soap bubbles into the air.   Stoned.   Mesmerized. \nBOB He knows me. He really knows me. \nSam looks at her present. An old 45 record of The Beatles classic \"Something\" with a card. She reads the card. Holds it to her chest. Very moved. \nSAM Come on out, Charlie. \nThey all chime in. \"Let's go, young man!\" \"Charlie! Charlie!\" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his entrance play off their faces. The reverse angle reveals... \nCharlie dressed in his suit. Like the best of English mods in the 60's. For those of you who know the book, this is the cover. They all clap. It's magic. \nPATRICK Yeah!   What a display of man I have ever seen! \nSam and Charlie look at each and smile. \n66   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - LATER                                       66 \nThe door opens.   Sam and Charlie walk into the dark room. \nCHARLIE Where are we going? \nSAM It's a surprise. \nSam flips the switch, bathing the room in light. Sam's room is so cool. A shrine to music. A xerox that says \"The Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves.\" Virgin Mary icons. Snow globes. Kitsch. \nCHARLIE Is this your room?    It's so cool. \nSAM Thanks. \nSam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk. \n", "test2_true": "SAM With all that help on my Penn State application? Of course I did. Open it. \nCharlie lifts up the box to reveal an OLD MANUAL TYPEWRITER. \nCHARLIE I don't know what to say. \nSAM You don't have to say anything. \nSam goes over and types. \"Write about us sometime.\" He smiles and types back. \"I will.\" They look at each other. We can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs. \nSAM (CONT'D) I'm sorry we can't be here for your birthday. \nCHARLIE That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad. \nSAM I'm in such a great mood, I don't think even he could ruin it. I feel like I'm finally doing good. \nCHARLIE You are. \nSAM Me? What about you? When I met you, you were this scared freshman. And look at you in that suit. You're like a sexy English school boy. I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out. \nCHARLIE (innocent laugh) No. \nSAM Innocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see you coming. And parents love you. That's like... extra danger. \nCHARLIE Well, it hasn't worked so far. \nSAM Come on. You've never had a girlfriend? Not even a 2nd grade valentine? \nHe shakes his head. \nSAM (CONT'D) Have you ever kissed a girl? \nCHARLIE No.   What about you? \nSAM Have I ever kissed a girl? \nCHARLIE (laughs) No! Your first kiss... \nSam gets this strange look in her eyes.    A little haunted. \nSAM My first kiss? I was 11. His name was Robert. He would come over to the house all the time. \nCHARLIE Was he your first boyfriend? \nSAM He was my dad's boss. \nCharlie goes silent. \nSAM (CONT'D) You know Charlie, I used to sleep with guys who treated me like shit. And get wasted all the time. But now... I feel like I have a chance. I could even get into a real college. \nCHARLIE It's true.     You can do it. \nSAM \nCHARLIE My Aunt... she had that same thing done to her, too. And she turned her life around. \nSAM She must have been great. \nCHARLIE She was my favorite person in the world... until now. \nSam smiles.   She's very moved. \nSAM Charlie, I know that you know I like Craig. But I want to forget that for a minute. Okay? I just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you. Okay? \nCharlie nods. And with that, Sam leans over and kisses him. It starts softly, then Sam wraps her thin arms around him. Holding on for lonely life. When the song crescendos, and they part, Charlie and Sam look at each other. Finally... \nSAM (CONT'D) I love you, Charlie. \nCHARLIE I love you, too. \n67   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                           67 \nThe porch lights are as golden as Charlie feels right now.

CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY                                  138 \nCharlie sits on his bed, finishing the letter. \nCHARLIE Especially because ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria, it's been getting worse. And I can't turn it off this time. \nCharlie puts down the letter. \n139   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                               139 \nThe kids pass their copies of The Great Gatsby up to the front, where Bill collects them for next year's freshmen. The class is buzzing loud. \nBILL Guys, you want to pass your copies of Gatsby up to the front please? And I know it's the last day, but if we could just keep it to a dull roar, I'd appreciate it. \nThe class quiets down. \nBILL (CONT'D) Thank you for such a great year. I had a blast. I hope you did, too. And I hope you have a great time this summer on your vacations. Now, who here is going to be reading for pleasure this summer? \nCharlie looks to see if anyone is watching... then, decides to raise his hand anyway. Bill is proud. \nBILL (CONT'D) Very good, Charlie. Who else? \nCharlie looks at the Smart Ass Freshman who tormented him all year. She sighs. Nothing left to say to him. \n140   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - LATER                                   140 \nThe last kids exit the classroom. Charlie walks down the aisle and stands in front of Bill. \nBILL Last day. \nCHARLIE Yeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my business, but have you decided... are you going to New York? \nBILL Well, my wife and I like it here, and I think I might be better at teaching than writing. \nCharlie is relieved.    Bill is staying. \nBILL (CONT'D) So, uh Charlie... I was thinking maybe I could still give you books next year. \nCHARLIE Yeah.   Yeah. \nBILL I think you could write one of them one day. \nCHARLIE (fragile belief) Really? \nBILL I do. \nCharlie is quiet.   Then... \nCHARLIE You're the best teacher I ever had. \nBILL Thank you. \nHe gives Bill a shy sideways hug. The two men say nothing else. Charlie waves and leaves. Bill smiles to himself. \n141   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                 141 \nTimes Square has nothing on these seniors. Charlie watches the gang on their last day of high school. When the clock hits 10 seconds to 3pm, all the students chant... \nSAM & COMPANY \nSTUDENT (O.S.) Oh, my God, get me the hell out of here! \nALL \nThey all cheer and hug each other. Patrick loses his mind with joy and charges down the hallway. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n142   EXT. MILL GROVE FOOTBALL STADIUM - SUNSET                         142 \nA brilliant sunset. We see the gang. In silhouette. Running up the bleachers after the sun. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend... I wanted to tell you about us running. There was this beautiful sunset. And just a few hours before, everyone I love had their last day of high school ever. And I was happy because they were happy, even though I counted, and I have 1,095 days to go. \n", "test3_true": "Prom night. Charlie sees Candace posing for Dad's camera. For a moment, we think Candace went to prom with Derek. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) I kept thinking about what school was going to be like without them as they \nAs mom and dad move out of the way, we realize Candace is standing with her 3 best girlfriends. They look beautiful. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) My sister finally decided to break up with Derek and go stag with her girlfriends instead. \n144   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - SUNSET                           144 \nProm night continues. The antique limo is so garish, it's great. Charlie snaps pictures with Sam's mom and Patrick's dad. Mary Elizabeth is with her boyfriend, Peter. Alice stands with Patrick, dashing in his Mod Suit Tux. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) And then there was Sam... \nThe image moves to the front of the house, where Sam emerges. She wears a vintage flapper dress from the 20's. Radiant. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I've looked at her pictures since that night. I like to see how happy she was before she knew. \nSam joins Craig. They kiss for the cameras, then run with the rest of the gang to the limosine. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) They were in a hotel suite after prom when the truth came out... \nThe gang poses for more pictures in front of the limo. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Basically, Craig has been cheating on Sam the whole time. When I heard that, I kept thinking about the happy girl in these pictures. Because she doesn't have 1,095 days to go. \n145   EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON                                    145 \nGraduation Day. The place is packed with graduating seniors and families.

Get against the railing and try to look suave! \nThe kids line up for the picture they will always remember. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) Yeah, this is the one. That's going to be a great angle. \nPatrick bows to reveal the top of his cap reads, \"Nothing Hates You.\" The parents line up cameras. \"Cheese!\" Snap. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n146   INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               146 \nThe grandfather clock reads 9:30pm. The room is festive under streamers wishing Sam luck at Penn State. The kids sign each other's yearbooks. Charlie sees Sam smile at old photos. He misses her already. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) At her going away party, I wanted her to know about that night we went through the tunnel. And how for the first time, I felt like I belonged somewhere. \nCUT TO: \n147   INT.

And tomorrow, she's leaving. So, I wanted to give her a part of me. \nCharlie watches Sam pick up his present. She carefully peels the tape to reveal that Charlie gave her all of his books. \nSAM Are these all your books, Charlie? \nHe nods.   They lock eyes and do not speak. \n148   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      148 \nThe pictures are down. The dressers empty. The suitcase is open on the bed. Charlie watches Sam fold clothes and put them in her suitcase. He has promised himself he will not cry. Even when she packs away his Beatles 45 of \"Something.\" \nInstead, he looks at her and tries to remember every detail. Her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice. \nSAM Thanks for staying up with me. \n", "test3_id": 1220}

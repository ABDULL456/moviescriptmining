{"train": "THE PERKS OF BEING a WALLFLOWER \nWritten by \nStephen Chbosky \nFinal Draft \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                             1 \nThe titles begin over black. We hear the sound of an old typewriter. Someone reaching out to us. The bell dings, announcing the end of a line, and we see our title... \nTHE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER \nMusic begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city. Downtown Pittsburgh. Looking out of the back window like a child in the back of a station wagon. \nWe see lights on buildings and everything that makes us wonder. We see the bridge. And the river below. And then we enter... \nThe Tunnel. \nWe keep moving backwards, watching the lights. Golden, alive, and hypnotic. The music carries us as we float out of the tunnel. Onto another bridge. And over the highway. \nWe move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a window, and into... \n2   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  2 \nIt is a neat and tidy little room. Few posters or books. CHARLIE is 15. He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable to everyone but his classmates. He sits at his desk, writing a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the radio on his cassette boom box. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend, I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I don't want you to do that. I just need to know that people like you exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't think I was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you nervous. \n3   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                            3 \nCharlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban split level house. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) I hope it's okay for me to think that. You see, I haven't really talked to anyone outside of my family all summer. \nCharlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football game. Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine. Charlie waits for them to notice him. And waits. And waits. \n4   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      4 \nCharlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) But tomorrow is my first day of high school ever, and I really need to turn things around this year. (hopeful) So, I have a plan. \n5   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LAST DAY                      5 \nWe see it in Charlie's mind. Slow motion and wondrous. The kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in the air like a New York confetti parade. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) As I enter the school for the first time, I will visualize what it will be like on the last day of my senior year. \nCharlie walks down the hall.   Triumphant.   Confident.   Happy. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Unfortunately, I counted, and that's... \nSMASH CUT TO: \n6   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - FIRST DAY                     6 \nReality. The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from Charlie's POV. A SENIOR BULLY leads the ritual, making dozens of freshmen hop down the hall. \nSENIOR BULLY Hop, freshman toads. Hop!    Move it, boys! \nAs seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) ... 1,385 days from now. \nVARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS pass, wearing their letter jackets. \nLINEBACKER Man, you got big. \nNOSE TACKLE Worked out all summer.   Rock hard, dude. \nThe kids pass back paperback copies of To Kill A Mockingbird. Charlie opens his Trapper Keeper, takes a pencil out of the plastic pouch, and writes... \"ENGLISH CLASS... DAY ONE.\" \nCHARLIE (V.O.) My last class of the day is advanced English, and I'm excited to finally start learning with the smartest kids in the school... \nA SMART ASS FRESHMAN girl with braces smiles at him. \nSMART ASS FRESHMAN (whispers) Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot. \nThe kids around him laugh. Charlie's ears turn red. At the blackboard, the teacher writes his name... Mr. Anderson. But you can call him BILL (27). Bill is an idealist. \nBILL Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to Teach for America, I'm going to be your teacher for freshman English. This semester, we're going to be learning Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Genius book. Now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz? \nAll hands go up.   Except Charlie's.   Bill paces the rows. \nBILL (CONT'D) I'm shocked. Alright. You can skip the quiz if you tell me which author invented the paperback book. Anyone? \nAs kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats. \nBILL (CONT'D) He's British. He also invented the serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3 of his first novel, he had a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence, the term cliffhanger. Anybody? \nFRESHMAN GIRL Shakespeare. \nBILL That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare didn't write novels. Anybody else? (off their silence) The author was... \nBill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has already written... Charles Dickens. \nBILL (CONT'D) ... Charles Dickens. However, if you and I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can you imagine that? We would have put those pennies in a metal box, which the ushers would lock in the office. And that's where we get the term... anyone? \nKIDS (O.S.) \"Office Depot!\" \"Office Supplies!\" \nCharlie writes down Box Office, then looks up to find that Bill is staring at him. Waiting for him to raise his hand. \nBILL I'll give you a free \"A\" on anything but the final term paper if you get it right. \nCharlie looks down.   He's not going to answer. \nBILL (CONT'D) Box office. \nThe kids groan. They should have known.     Charlie smiles to himself. He's going to like this class. \n11   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - LATER                                      11 \nThe bell rings. The students chatter their way out of class. The last to leave is Charlie. \nBILL You should learn to participate. \nCharlie stops and turns to find Bill erasing the board. \nBILL (CONT'D) Why didn't you raise your hand? (off Charlie's shrug) They call you teacher's pet? Freak? (off Charlie's nod) I used to get spaz. I mean, come on, spaz? \nCharlie smiles.   Bill takes a moment.   Then... \nBILL (CONT'D) So, I heard you had a tough time last year. But they say if you make one friend on your first day, you're doing okay. \nCHARLIE Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that would be sort of depressing. \nBILL Yeah.   I could see that. \nCHARLIE Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.     I'm okay. \nBill nods and watches Charlie exit.   He gets swallowed up by the hallway as the bell rings. \n12   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     12 \nCharlie looks through the thick office glass. He sees Patrick use his charms on MRS. SMALL, (58) the Principal. \nPATRICK (to Mrs. Small) I would happily not take shop... \nOut of nowhere, the SENIOR BULLY grabs Charlie's book. \nSENIOR BULLY Hey, Freshman Toad. \nThe bully rips the cover. He throws it on the ground as his friends laugh and disappear down the hall. Charlie walks up and picks up his book. \nThe reading is done. Charlie proudly puts To Kill a Mockingbird on his newly dubbed \"Shelf of Fame.\" \n19   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                   19 \nThe songs continues as we see glimpses of Charlie's day to day life over the next few weeks. Charlie exits his English class. FRESHMEN BULLIES wait for him, led by... \nSMART ASS FRESHMAN Did you already do the term paper on To \nSilence. They grab and drag him into the boy's room.     We hear the toilet flush for the swirly. \n20   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                       20 \nCharlie looks at the new bottle of prescription Wellbutrin. He puts a pill in his mouth and washes it down with RC cola. \n21   INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                              21 \nCharlie watches his brother and the Penn State Nittany Lions on TV. He looks over at his father, but his dad is too busy building Charlie's clock for shop class to notice him. \n22   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                     22 \nCharlie carries his tray through the intimidating cafeteria. Not giving up. Looking for somewhere to sit. \nCUT TO: \n23   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                     23 \nCharlie sits by himself in the corner. He looks around the cafeteria, wanting to break in. Not knowing how. After a moment, he returns to his book. The song ends. \n24   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT              24 \nFriday Night Football in Western, PA. Charlie buys his Coke and nachos and wanders to the bleachers. He sits alone, trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students. When the Mill Grove Devils recover a fumble, he hears... \nPATRICK Come on Devils! Woooooo! \nCharlie looks up at Patrick, cheering his head off.    TWIN SENIOR GIRLS pass him, taunting. \nTWIN SENIOR GIRLS Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing. \nPATRICK Suck it, virginity pledges! \nCharlie wants to go up to Patrick so badly. After driving himself crazy, sitting up and down twice, he approaches. \nCHARLIE Hey... Patrick. \nPATRICK Hey! You're in my shop class, right? How's your clock coming? \nCHARLIE My dad's building it. \nPATRICK Yeah. Mine looks like a boat. (off Charlie's awkward silence) You want to sit over here, or are you waiting for your friends? \nCHARLIE No.   I'll sit if that's okay. \nPatrick motions for Charlie to sit.   Charlie sits.   Elated. \nPATRICK Thanks for not calling me \"Nothing\" by the way. It's an endless nightmare. And these assholes actually think they're being original. \nBrad Hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field. Charlie dries his hands on his pants. So nervous. A 5 second silence that feels like a year. Think of something to say. Anything. \nCHARLIE So, uh... you like football? \nPATRICK Love it. \nCHARLIE Then, maybe you know my broth-- \nPATRICK Hey, Sam. \nCharlie looks up. Standing there is the prettiest girl he's ever seen. SAM (17) would make every mother proud and every father nervous. She is alive, adventurous, and a world class flirt. Great attitude. Great taste. Great banter. \nSAM Question. Could the bathrooms here be more disgusting? \nPATRICK Yes, they call it the men's room. \nSam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick. Charlie tries to remain casual. Hang in there, buddy. \nSAM Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo. \nCHARLIE Are you sure it's okay that I come? \nSAM Of course. Just remember, Charlie... Bob's not paranoid. \nPATRICK \"He's sensitive.\" \nSam knocks. The door opens, revealing BOB (20). Bob was the cool high school kid, who never quite left. He's stoned so often that people can't tell the difference anymore. \nBOB Sam... that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease. Will you marry me? \nSAM Only if I have Patrick's blessing. \nBOB Patrick? \nPATRICK You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute. So, I'm going to have to say \"no\" on that one, but nice try. Charlie? \nPatrick leads Charlie inside, leaving Bob staring at Sam. \nBOB Touch\u00e9. \n35   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER                              35 \nPATRICK Charlie... this is a party. \nThe music blasts. Charlie's eyes are our guide. As they walk through the crowd, you can smell it. Stale beer and cigarette smoke. High school parties. The room is packed with kids playing quarters. Others pouring vodka into a watermelon. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) This is what fun looks like. \nPatrick smiles when he spots two friends. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) You ready to meet some desperate women? \nMARY ELIZABETH and ALICE (both 17) sit on the sofa together. Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely bossy. Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in college. Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary Elizabeth's \"beta female.\" \nPATRICK (CONT'D) Here, have a seat. Hey, ladies, meet Charlie. Charlie, meet ladies. \nThey shake hands and say their hellos. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) This is Charlie's first party ever. So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow jobs from both of you. \nMARY ELIZABETH Patrick, you're such a dick. \nPATRICK Where the hell did you go? \nMARY ELIZABETH The dance was a little boring, don't you think? \nPATRICK You're so selfish. We looked everywhere for you. You could have told someone. \nMARY ELIZABETH Cry me a river. \nPATRICK How is it that you got meaner since \nMARY ELIZABETH Just lucky I guess. \nPATRICK I think you're doing something wrong. \nMARY ELIZABETH Or something very right. \nPatrick and Mary Elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as Sam calls out from the other side of the room. \nSAM (O.S.) Hey!    Look who's here! \nThe party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback, enter with Sam and Bob. Patrick approaches them. Charlie sits on the beat up couch next to the girls. He's shocked. \nCHARLIE Is that Brad Hays? \nALICE Yeah.    He comes here sometimes. \nCHARLIE But he's a popular kid. \nMARY ELIZABETH (offended) Then, what are we? \nCHARLIE Charlie.     Charlie.   Weird. \nCharlie wanders down the hallway, a little lost. He finds the door to the master bedroom and opens it. He sees Patrick and Brad Hays... kissing. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Woah. \nPATRICK Charlie? \nBRAD HAYS (nervous) Who is that kid? \nPATRICK Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine. Stay here. \nPatrick closes the bedroom door and follows Charlie. \nCHARLIE I didn't see anything. \nPATRICK I know you saw something, but it's okay. \nPatrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to know... wait, are you baked? \nCHARLIE \"Like a cake.\" That's what Bob said. And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us. And everyone laughed, but I don't know what's funny. \nPATRICK Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad. This has to be our little secret. \nCHARLIE Our little secret.     Agreed. \nPATRICK Thank you.     We'll talk later. \nCHARLIE I look forward to that big talk. \nPatrick laughs, goes back to the room, and closes the door. \n39   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - NIGHT                                         39 \nThe party has thinned. Sam watches Charlie drink his milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth. \nCHARLIE Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice? It's even better than the first one. \nPatrick walks downstairs.    Sam motions him over. \nSAM (barely audible whisper) I need to talk to you. Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself. I don't think he has any friends. \nPatrick turns to look at Charlie. He feels so bad for the kid. Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd. \nPATRICK Everyone.     Raise your glasses to Charlie. \nCharlie looks up.   A little paranoid.     Everyone is staring. \nCHARLIE What did I do? \nPATRICK You didn't do anything. We just want to toast our new friend. (off his look) You see things. And you understand. You're a wallflower. \nCharlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants.     He looks around the room at the nods and friendly faces. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) What is it? What's wrong? \nCHARLIE \nPATRICK Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet. So, everyone... \nSAM & EVERYONE To Charlie. \nThey all drink.    Sam approaches him.    A knowing smile. \nSAM Welcome to the island of misfit toys. \nCharlie smiles, and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n40   EXT./INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                        40 \nCHARLIE Yeah. \nALICE Don't you write poetry, Craig? \nCRAIG No.     Poetry writes me.   You know? \nCharlie sighs. Craig's upbeat song begins to play. He dances over to Sam. Charlie's heart breaks as he watches Sam hug on Craig. \n56   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     56 \nIn a mirror image, Candace hugs on Derek near the lockers. Charlie closes his own locker and moves down the hall. \n57   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING                                    57 \nThe bell rings.    Charlie sets down his On the Road paper. \nBILL Wow.    That was fast.   You want another one? \nCharlie nods. Bill smiles and reaches into his desk. He hands Charlie a copy of A Separate Piece. Charlie takes the book and starts to walk out, but he turns back. \nCHARLIE Mr. Anderson... can I ask you something? \nBILL Yeah. \nCHARLIE Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date? \nBILL Are we talking about anyone specific? \nCharlie nods. Bill looks straight at him. Not preaching. Coming from a history of personal experience and pain. \nBILL (CONT'D) We accept the love we think we deserve. \nCHARLIE Can we make them know they deserve more? \nBILL We can try. \nCharlie smiles. \n58   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - MORNING                         58 \nCharlie waits nervously at a booth. He sees Sam enter. He fixes his hair, then pretends to read his SAT PREP BOOK. \nSAM Hey, Charlie. \nCHARLIE Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in.     You want to work on probabilities and statistics? \nSam nods. They open their books, and a Christmas song begins. In a quick passage of time, we see them study next to Halloween decorations. Then, Thanksgiving. And finally, Christmas decorations. \n59   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   59 \nThe song continues. Charlie's mom and sister hang the Christmas ornaments as Charlie helps his dad find that \"one \nCHARLIE Hey, dad.    Can I have 30 dollars? \nFATHER (old joke) 20 dollars? What do you want 10 dollars for? \nCHARLIE Sam is doing secret santa. It's her favorite thing in the world. Please. \nCharlie's father reaches into his pocket and hands Charlie a bill. It's a fifty. Dad winks, in a great mood. \nFATHER Have fun. \nCHARLIE Thanks. \n60   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY                               60 \nLockers are opened by Charlie. Sam. Patrick. Wrapped gifts are deposited. Mischief smiles. Lockers closed. Everyone loves getting their presents except Charlie - who got socks. \n61   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                                 61 \nBill hands Charlie a well worn copy of The Catcher in the Rye. He smiles. \nBILL Charlie... this was my favorite book growing up. This is my copy, but I want you to have it. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) I mean, I have no idea. This collection of presents is so gay that I think I must have given them to myself. But despite that distinct possibility, I'm going to have to go with... drum roll... Charlie. \nCharlie holds up his hands.     Yay!   They all cheer. \nSAM Alright, Charlie... it's your turn. \nCharlie and Patrick switch places.       Charlie stands. \nCHARLIE Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth. \nPATRICK Huh.   Now, why do you say that? \nCHARLIE I don't know. She bosses people around sometimes. \nThe gang cracks up.   Mary Elizabeth is pissed. \nMARY ELIZABETH What the hell is wrong with you? \nCHARLIE Sorry. \nPATRICK Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually... me. \nCHARLIE You got me clothes?     Why? \nPATRICK Because all the great writers used to wear great suits. Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve into our facilities. Emerge a star. \nCharlie gives Sam a sack of presents. \nCHARLIE Can you hand these out while I'm gone? \nMARY ELIZABETH Wait a second. There's only secret santa presents. There are rules, Charlie. \nPATRICK Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas? Hand them out, Sam. \nSam gives out the presents. The group rips them open. Alice looks at a book about Martin Scorsese with the inscription... \nALICE \"Alice, I know you'll get into NYU.\" \nAlice turns to Mary Elizabeth who holds up a card with... \nMARY ELIZABETH 40 dollars. (reads card) \"To print Punk Rocky in color next time.\" \nBob blows soap bubbles into the air.   Stoned.   Mesmerized. \nBOB He knows me. He really knows me. \nSam looks at her present. An old 45 record of The Beatles classic \"Something\" with a card. She reads the card. Holds it to her chest. Very moved. \nSAM Come on out, Charlie. \nThey all chime in. \"Let's go, young man!\" \"Charlie! Charlie!\" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his entrance play off their faces. The reverse angle reveals... \nCharlie dressed in his suit. Like the best of English mods in the 60's. For those of you who know the book, this is the cover. They all clap. It's magic. \nPATRICK Yeah!   What a display of man I have ever seen! \nSam and Charlie look at each and smile. \n66   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - LATER                                       66 \nThe door opens.   Sam and Charlie walk into the dark room. \nCHARLIE Where are we going? \nSAM It's a surprise. \nSam flips the switch, bathing the room in light. Sam's room is so cool. A shrine to music. A xerox that says \"The Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves.\" Virgin Mary icons. Snow globes. Kitsch. \nCHARLIE Is this your room?    It's so cool. \nSAM Thanks. \nSam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk. \nGANG \"Merry Christmas!\" \"Good luck at your dad's!\" \"See you at New Year's!\" \nPatrick approaches Charlie in the doorway. \nCHARLIE Have a good time at your mom's. \nPATRICK Thanks. And Charlie... since you were born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents. So, I thought you should have my clock. From the heart. \nCHARLIE Thank you, Patrick. \nSam gives Charlie one last hug.       Patrick and Sam watch their friends leave. \nPATRICK I love you guys! \n68   EXT. DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH - NIGHT                                     68 \nWe fly as high as Charlie feels.      Above the city on Christmas Eve. \n69   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         69 \nThe front door opens, revealing Charlie's dad. \nFATHER Hey!   Look who's here! \nHe moves out of the way, and standing there is Charlie's older brother, CHRIS KELMECKIS (19). Chris is handsome, charismatic, and an all around winner. \nCHRIS Come here, little sister. \nCANDACE Hey, Chris. \nBig hug.    Chris smiles big and \"son flirts\" with his mom. \nCHRIS Ma, you look so thin! \nMOTHER 10 pounds... Weight Watchers. \nBig kiss.   When he lets go, he sees Charlie and smiles. \nCHRIS Charlie... \nChris and Charlie look at each other in silence. Then, hug. As the family moves into the dining room to celebrate, Chris gives him a quiet... \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Happy birthday. \n70   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                           70 \nMOTHER Make a wish, honey. \nWe move closer to Charlie as he makes his wish and blows out his 16 candles. \nMATCH CUT TO: \n71   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                            71 \nThe wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags. The suburb is quiet. Not a creature is stirring. Except... \nCharlie. He fills a brown paper bag with    sand and a candle. He lights the candle, making the bag glow   like a beautiful lantern. He looks down his street, where    families are out with their kids, doing the same luminaria   ritual. \nMATCH CUT TO: \n72   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          72 \nThe same street. Christmas Eve. Many years ago. Aunt Helen and the kids finish their luminaria bags. Aunt Helen lights up the candles. They glow. \nAUNT HELEN Can you see it, Charlie? The luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus. \nThe image goes wide. All of these bags glowing.     Beautiful. Aunt Helen rattles her keys. Whispers. \nAUNT HELEN (CONT'D) Keep an eye out for him with your brother and sister. I'll be right back. \nShe bends down and whispers into his ear. \nAUNT HELEN (CONT'D) I'm going to get your birthday present. \nThe song ends. The cast bows. Sam and Patrick push Charlie in front for his own curtain call. Everyone cheers. It's the night he'll never forget. \n95   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                   95 \nThe wind whips. That bracing February cold. Charlie helps Mary Elizabeth carry the costumes outside to her car. \nCHARLIE Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something? \nMARY ELIZABETH We're filled up now, but they'll need people after we leave for college. I could put in a good word for you. \nCHARLIE That'd be great. Thanks. \nThey put the box in her trunk. Snap it closed. We can't help but notice the \"Keep Your Laws Off My Body\" bumper sticker as Mary Elizabeth tries her best to flirt. \nMARY ELIZABETH Charlie... have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance? \nCHARLIE The one where the girl asks the guy. \nMARY ELIZABETH Yeah. Well, obviously, it's completely stupid and sexist. It's like, \"Hey, thanks for the crumb.\" And normally, I'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture. But, you know, it's my last year, and... would you maybe want to go with me? \nCHARLIE You want to go with me? \nMARY ELIZABETH I'm sick of macho guys. And you looked really cute in your costume. So, what do you say? \nCharlie thinks and thinks and... \n96   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK                                       96 \nDing dong. Charlie's mom opens the door for MARY ELIZABETH. Charlie straightens out his church suit. So nervous. \nMOTHER You must be Mary Elizabeth.    It's so good to meet you. \nMARY ELIZABETH You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis. \nFATHER (shit eating grin) Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist. \n97   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - FIREPLACE - DUSK                           97 \nCharlie and Mary Elizabeth stand next to Candace and Derek. \nFATHER OK, a little closer together. That looks nice. Buddhist, I need you to smile a little bit more. There you go. Nice. \nCheese!   White flash.   The picture of 4 kids.   Smiling big. \n98   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                 98 \nCharlie and Mary Elizabeth slow dance to an 80's love song. Sweaty palms. Awkward. Hands on hips. Horror. \nCharlie looks around the gym. He sees Alice dancing with her date, an EFFEMINATE GOTH KID (17). We'll never meet him, but he'll make us laugh once. \nCharlie then watches Patrick dance with Sam. He follows Patrick's gaze across the floor to Brad, who dances with a SENIOR GIRL (18). Charlie sees the boys look at each other. For one moment, it's like they're dancing together. \n99   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - LATER                 99 \nMary Elizabeth is at the punch bowl with the gang. Charlie sees Sam, standing by the wall, looking sad. He approaches. \nCHARLIE Are you having a good time? \nSAM Not really. How about you? \nCHARLIE I don't know. This is my first date, so I don't know what to compare it to. \nSAM Don't worry. You're doing fine. \nCharlie joins her at the wall.   Mary Elizabeth gives them a quick, jealous look. \nCHARLIE I'm sorry Craig didn't come. \nSAM Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to some stupid high school dance. Can't say I blame him. \nCHARLIE I don't know. If you like it, he should come. \nSAM Thanks, Charlie. Have a beautiful first date. You deserve it. \nShe gives him one last kiss.      Content, she lays down on his lap. Peaceful. \nMARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I didn't know how it was going to go tonight, but it was really nice, huh? \nCHARLIE Yeah. \nMARY ELIZABETH I can't believe it. You of all people. I just can't believe you're my boyfriend. \nWe land on Charlie's face.       \"What?\"   And then, we hear the GARAGE DOOR OPEN. \nMARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Oh, shit!     My parents! \nThe mad scramble for clothes begins. \nCUT TO: \n103   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          103 \nMary Elizabeth's car pulls in front of Charlie's house. Charlie gets out. Wanting to say he's not her boyfriend. Not knowing how. Mary Elizabeth smiles. Smitten. \nMARY ELIZABETH See you Monday. \nWith that, she backs out of the driveway. We see him from the back of her car, getting smaller and smaller. His stomach already filling with acid. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend... I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but things are a total disaster. \n104   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                         104 \nSam, Patrick, and Alice are seated around the table. Mary Elizabeth has her arms around Charlie. Smothering him. \nMARY ELIZABETH We're literally making out, and I'm in my bra. Hello! And the front door opens. It's my parents! I'm scrambling to get my dress on. It was crazy. Right, babe? \nCharlie nods, tortured. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) I probably should have been honest about how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n105   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING              105 \nAsh Wednesday. Charlie gets out of the school bus to immediately find Mary Elizabeth waiting for him. She sees the cross of ashes on his forehead. She thinks his ashes are a smudge. She cleans it. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person underneath the part of her that hates everyone. And since I heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy, I tried hard to love her like I love Sam. \nMARY ELIZABETH Can you believe it's almost our two week anniversary? \nCHARLIE I know. \n106   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                   106 \nA double date. Craig and Sam buy the tickets to see the silent classic, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) So, I took her on double dates. \nMARY ELIZABETH (proud) Your first foreign film. \nCHARLIE \nMARY ELIZABETH Vegans don't eat butter. \nCharlie tries not to feel Mary Elizabeth's sweaty hand. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) And I tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands even when her hands are sweaty. \n107   INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S DEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   107 \nJust like Sadie's except... the fire in the fireplace is out. We move from the fireplace to Charlie, touching Mary Elizabeth's breasts over her sweater. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) And I had to admit something really upsetting. But I am tired of touching her boobs. I thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music once in awhile, we might have a chance. \nCharlie looks at the Ani DiFranco Mix on the stereo.   Sighs. \n108   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                          108 \nThe gang is there.   Walden rests on Charlie's lunch tray. \nPATRICK How is your first relationship going? \nCHARLIE It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't have to break up with her. \nPATRICK Charlie?   Truth or dare? \nCharlie blinks.   It was all fantasy. \nCHARLIE Dare. \nPATRICK I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips. Notice I charitably said girl and not person because let's face it... I'd smoke all you bitches. \nAlice hits him. Laughter. Charlie thinks. He looks at Mary Elizabeth, then turns to Sam. Before Sam can even react... Charlie plants a kiss right on her lips. When he opens his eyes, he looks around, and realizes the magnitude of his mistake. Everyone stares. After a horrible silence... \nPATRICK (CONT'D) Now that's fucked up. \nWithout a word, Mary Elizabeth just stands, dignified, and goes into the kitchen. \nCHARLIE Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.     I'm-- \nAlice follows Mary Elizabeth.    Sam is close behind. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Sam?! Sam! I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry. \nSam turns and looks at him.    She doesn't even recognize him. \nSAM What the hell is wrong with you? \nCharlie is devastated. \n113   EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         113 \nThey move to the driveway.     Charlie feels awful.   Panicky. \nCHARLIE \nPATRICK Trust me.    You don't want to go back there. \nCHARLIE But, I... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to do anything. \nPATRICK I know you didn't, but look... I hate to be the one to break this, but there's history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam. Other guys. Things that have nothing to do with you. But... it's best if you stay away for awhile. \nCHARLIE (crushed) Oh. Okay. How long do you think? \nSilence. Charlie looks over at Patrick, who wears a grave expression. It's going to be a long time. We hear the sound of the typewriter. \n114   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING                                    114 \nCharlie sits at his desk. It looks like he's barely slept. He begins typing. The keys up close and loud. Clak. \nCLOSE UP TYPING: \"Dear friend, I have not seen my friends for 2 weeks now. I am starting to get bad again.\" \nCharlie stares at the typewriter.    And remembers. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n115   INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          115 \nLittle Charlie pops his head around the corner from the hallway. He looks at something we can't see yet. \nBACK TO: \n116   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING (PRESENT)                          116 \nPresent.   Knock.   Knock.   Charlie's mom opens the door. \nMOTHER We're going to be late for Easter Mass. \nCHARLIE I'll... I'll be there in a minute. \nCharlie forces a smile, then looks back at the typewriter. And tries to shake off the memory. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nBOB Don't worry about it.   Hey... you hear from Patrick? \nCHARLIE No.   He told me to stay away. \nBOB Oh... you don't know? \nCHARLIE (concerned) Why? Why? What happened? \nBOB Brad's father caught them together. \n125   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING                 125 \nAs kids open lockers and move to morning period, Charlie stares at Brad. He has a black eye and cuts on his face. He look like he was beaten up badly. Students whisper gossip. \nGOSSIP WHISPERS (O.S.) \"Some Lebo kids jumped him outside the O.\" \"It was some kids from North Hills.\" \"That's not what I heard.\" \nBrad moves into the arms of CHARLOTTE (18), cheerleader cute. As Brad kisses her, Charlie sees Patrick down the hall, watching them. Patrick closes his locker. Hurting. \nCHARLIE Are you okay? \nPATRICK Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry. \nPatrick storms off. \n126   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                          126 \nCharlie sits at his table, alone. He watches Patrick leave the lunch line, passing a chorus of... \nTWIN SENIOR GIRLS \nPatrick says nothing. He's too sad to fight the mob today. He just moves to his table when the Nose Tackle sticks out his leg. Patrick falls on his tray. The kids laugh. \nNOSE TACKLE Oops.   Sorry, Nothing. \nPatrick smiles to himself, dusts off, and turns to Brad. \nPATRICK You going to do something? \nBRAD HAYS What are you talking about? \nPATRICK Your pet ape just tripped me.    Are you going to say something? \nBRAD HAYS Why would I? \nPATRICK You know why. \nIt's too far.   Brad can feel people staring. \nBRAD HAYS This is pathetic, man.    Your fixation on me. \nBrad's friends laugh.   Patrick's eyes narrow. \nPATRICK Do you want your friends to know how you got those bruises? Really? \nBRAD HAYS I got jumped in a parking lot. \nPATRICK Where? In Schenley Park? Do they know about Schenley Park? (to Brad's friends) Do you guys know about Schenley Park? \nBrad stands and gets right in Patrick's face. \nBRAD HAYS I don't know what kind of sick shit you're trying to pull. (real warning) But you better walk away now... Nothing. \nPATRICK Fine.   Say hi to your dad for me. \nPatrick turns and leaves.    And then, as an afterthought... \nBRAD HAYS Whatever... faggot. \nBrad's friends laugh.    Patrick stops and turns.   Last chance. \nPATRICK What did you call me? \nBRAD HAYS I called you a faggo-- \nMary Elizabeth looks at us because she wants us to know... \nMARY ELIZABETH I'm dating Peter now. \nShe motions to PETER.    College.   Glasses.   Good looking-ish. \nMARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D) He's in college with Craig. He's opinionated, and we have intellectual debates. You were very sweet, but our relationship was too one-sided. I know this is hard for you. \nCHARLIE I'm just glad you're happy. \nMARY ELIZABETH Okay. \nMary Elizabeth joins Peter.    Charlie looks at his friends. \nthat says, \"They forget. I don't.\" After a beat, Patrick comes downstairs. He looks sad with his bruises. \nPATRICK Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon. \nMARY ELIZABETH We're going to miss the movie. \nCRAIG Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step. \nAs Craig moves upstairs, Patrick approaches Charlie. \nPATRICK Hey... you wanna get out of here? \nCHARLIE Sure, Patrick. \n130   EXT. WEST END OVERLOOK - NIGHT                               130 \nPatrick drives Sam's truck up the hill to the overlook. \nPATRICK (V.O.) I'll tell you something, Charlie. I feel good. You know what I mean? Maybe tomorrow I'll take you to this karaoke place downtown. And this club off the strip. They don't card. And the Schenley Park scene. You gotta see the \"fruit loop\" at least one time. \n131   EXT. WEST END OVERLOOK - NIGHT                               131 \nCharlie and Patrick walk the lighted path, howling at the moon. Patrick holds a thermos, filled with who knows what. \nPATRICK Oh, my God. My life is officially an after school special. Son of a bitch! \nCHARLIE (laughing) It kind of is. It so is. \nMore laughter.   They arrive at the lookout.   They drink. \nPATRICK So, you ever hear the one about Lily Miller? \nCHARLIE I don't know. \nPATRICK Really? I thought your brother would have told you. It's a classic. \nCHARLIE Maybe. \nPATRICK So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker. And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity. So, she did it really proper. She packed a picnic. Stole a bottle of wine. Everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms. So, what do you think happened? \nCHARLIE I don't know. \nPATRICK They did it with one of the sandwich bags. \nThey start laughing and screaming. \nCHARLIE Ew!   That's disgusting! \nPATRICK Yes! It is! Let's keep the train rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie! \nPatrick points to Charlie, who thinks... \nCHARLIE Uh. Well... there was this girl named Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the 4th grade-- \nPATRICK Mosquito bites. Promising.     Go. \nCHARLIE And she let some of the boys feel them. \nPATRICK That's your suburban legend?     Did you at least cop a feel? \n138   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY                                  138 \nCharlie sits on his bed, finishing the letter. \nCHARLIE Especially because ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria, it's been getting worse. And I can't turn it off this time. \nCharlie puts down the letter. \n139   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                               139 \nThe kids pass their copies of The Great Gatsby up to the front, where Bill collects them for next year's freshmen. The class is buzzing loud. \nBILL Guys, you want to pass your copies of Gatsby up to the front please? And I know it's the last day, but if we could just keep it to a dull roar, I'd appreciate it. \nThe class quiets down. \nBILL (CONT'D) Thank you for such a great year. I had a blast. I hope you did, too. And I hope you have a great time this summer on your vacations. Now, who here is going to be reading for pleasure this summer? \nCharlie looks to see if anyone is watching... then, decides to raise his hand anyway. Bill is proud. \nBILL (CONT'D) Very good, Charlie. Who else? \nCharlie looks at the Smart Ass Freshman who tormented him all year. She sighs. Nothing left to say to him. \n140   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - LATER                                   140 \nThe last kids exit the classroom. Charlie walks down the aisle and stands in front of Bill. \nBILL Last day. \nCHARLIE Yeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my business, but have you decided... are you going to New York? \nBILL Well, my wife and I like it here, and I think I might be better at teaching than writing. \nCharlie is relieved.    Bill is staying. \nBILL (CONT'D) So, uh Charlie... I was thinking maybe I could still give you books next year. \nCHARLIE Yeah.   Yeah. \nBILL I think you could write one of them one day. \nCHARLIE (fragile belief) Really? \nBILL I do. \nCharlie is quiet.   Then... \nCHARLIE You're the best teacher I ever had. \nBILL Thank you. \nHe gives Bill a shy sideways hug. The two men say nothing else. Charlie waves and leaves. Bill smiles to himself. \n141   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                 141 \nTimes Square has nothing on these seniors. Charlie watches the gang on their last day of high school. When the clock hits 10 seconds to 3pm, all the students chant... \nSAM & COMPANY \nSTUDENT (O.S.) Oh, my God, get me the hell out of here! \nALL \nThey all cheer and hug each other. Patrick loses his mind with joy and charges down the hallway. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n142   EXT. MILL GROVE FOOTBALL STADIUM - SUNSET                         142 \nA brilliant sunset. We see the gang. In silhouette. Running up the bleachers after the sun. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Dear Friend... I wanted to tell you about us running. There was this beautiful sunset. And just a few hours before, everyone I love had their last day of high school ever. And I was happy because they were happy, even though I counted, and I have 1,095 days to go. \nCHARLIE Sure. My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner. You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night. It's a tradition. \nSAM That sounds like fun. \nCHARLIE Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore. \nSAM Yes, I will. \nSam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room.   They stand next to each other. Close. \nSAM (CONT'D) I had lunch with Craig today. \nCHARLIE Yeah? \nSAM He said he was sorry, and that I was right to break up with him. But I'm driving away, and I just felt so small. Just asking myself why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing? \nCHARLIE We accept the love we think we deserve. \nHe says it sober. Without judgement. Sam lets it sink in. Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing. Then, she turns to him. \nSAM Then, why didn't you ever ask me out? \nCharlie didn't expect that.       He is silent.   Heart pounding. \nCHARLIE I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted that. \nSAM Well, what did you want? \nCHARLIE I just want you to be happy. \nSAM Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel that. It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. I don't want to be somebody's crush. I want people to like the real me. \nCHARLIE I know who you are, Sam. \nSam waits.    And Charlie finally speaks from the heart. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I know I'm quiet, and I know I should speak more, but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant. How much we are alike. And how we've been through the same things. And you're not small. You're beautiful. \nHe can't contain himself anymore. He moves to her and kisses her. They stand. Move to the bed. Kissing. Charlie's heart pounds. They sit on the bed. Still kissing. \nWe see her fingertips. Her hand on Charlie's knee. When she touches him, Charlie pulls away from her. Shocked. Like he's seen a ghost. It hits Charlie like freezing water. \nSAM What's wrong, Charlie? \nCHARLIE Oh, ah... nothing. \nCharlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues \n149   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                          149 \nIt's like a dream for Charlie. He watches Sam hug Alice and Mary Elizabeth goodbye. But Charlie is somewhere else. \nSAM I'll call all the time. \nMARY ELIZABETH Promise. \nSAM And we'll all see each other in New York. \nSAM'S MOM Come on, Sam. \nCharlie can't take it. He moves to the side of the truck and puts in the last suitcase. He looks over at Sam. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n150   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      150 \nQUICK FLASH...

SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                          151 \nCharlie snaps himself out of it. He turns back as Mary Elizabeth and Alice part ways. Charlie locks eyes with Sam. They take a moment. And then they come together to hug. She kisses him goodbye, trying not to cry. \nQUICK FLASH.   Little Charlie's mom opens the door to reveal a policeman. \n165   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY (PRESENT)                             165 \nBACK TO PRESENT. Charlie is in the same entry hall in the same house 8 years later. Banging his head against the wall. \"It's my fault. It's all my fault.\" \nHe passes the photo wall on the stairs. We see the images of the family. Church. Communion. Baby pictures. Years of history staring at us. Ghosts on the wall. \n166   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                           166 \nBACK TO PRESENT. Charlie sits at his desk. We see him from behind. Perfectly still. Trying to keep himself calm. \nCHARLIE Stop crying. \n167   INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY (FLASHBACK)                           167 \nQUICK FLASH. Charlie thinks everyone is staring at him. His sister and her friends. His brother and mother. Mary Elizabeth and Alice. And worst of all... Sam and Patrick the night they toasted him. A paranoid nightmare. \n168   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                             168 \nBACK TO PRESENT.   Charlie's falling to pieces.   The tears run down his face. \nCHARLIE Stop crying. \n169   INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - VARIOUS TIMES (FANTASY)                   169 \nQUICK FLASH. Derek hits Candace.   Patrick hits Brad.    The cafeteria erupts into violence. \nAnd Charlie remembers what he's blacked out. \nWe see him in the cafeteria. Terrifying. He thinks he sees Aunt Helen as he breaks the Linebacker's nose. Hits another in the throat. And pushes another. Charlie looks at his hand, covered in blood. The whole school staring at him. \n170   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                             170 \nBACK TO PRESENT. Charlie holds his head. Trying to stuff the pictures back in his brain. But he can't. They keep coming and coming, faster and faster. Sam's hand, Little Charlie on top of the stairs, the police telling him Aunt Helen is dead. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) It'll be our little secret. \nWe go behind his head. The image moves closer and closer. Until it feels like we are inside Charlie's mind. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n171   EXT. HOUSE SWIMMING POOL - DAY                                     171 \nWe see Candace hanging out with her girlfriends at a friend's backyard pool. Her FRIEND (18, pretty) holds the cordless. \nCANDACE'S FRIEND Candace... your brother's on the phone. \nCandace casually picks up the phone. \nCANDACE Hello. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Hey, Candace. \nCANDACE Charlie? \nCHARLIE Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just can't stop thinking something. \nCANDACE What? \nCHARLIE Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I? She died getting my birthday present, so I guess I killed her, right? I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't. She keeps driving away and dying over and over. \nCandace looks like she got hit with ice water. She knows her brother. She knows this voice. Candace covers the phone. \nCANDACE Call the police and send them to my house. \nCHARLIE And I can't stop her.   I'm crazy again. \nCANDACE No, Charlie, listen to me. Mom and dad are going to be home with Chris any second. \nCHARLIE I was just thinking... what if I wanted her to die, Candace? \nCANDACE What?    Charlie... Charlie! \nCharlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement. \nCHARLIE She was... insane. \nThe minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today. \nDR. BURTON Charlie, are you going to let me help you here? \nCharlie cries and nods. \nCHARLIE Okay. \nDR. BURTON Do you remember anything before you blacked out? \nCHARLIE I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home... \nWe move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off. \n175   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                      175 \nThe sun creeps through the windows. We can hear birds outside. The intercom is quiet. Charlie is alone. He looks at Sam's typewriter. \"Dear Friend\" is already typed. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't go into detail about all of it. But I will say there were some very bad days. And some unexpected beautiful days. \nCharlie picks up a get well card from Sam. \n176   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                       176 \nDr. Burton walks Charlie's parents down the hallway. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) The worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me. \nIn the distance, we see Charlie's mom and dad stop.    Shocked. \n177   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                       177 \nCharlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway. \nMOTHER Honey? \nHis mother comes to hold him. \nMOTHER (CONT'D) I'm so sorry. \nFor a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the sports page, before he chokes it down. He walks over to his son and kisses his forehead. \n178   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                   178 \nCharlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) The best days were those when I could have visitors. My brother and sister always came for those until Chris had to go to training camp. He's going to be first string this year. And my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job. \n179   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                              179 \nCharlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand.    His mother waits in the hallway with Dr. Burton. \nDR. BURTON There he is. So, I'll see you Thursday at 6, right? \nCharlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there. I know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together. \nDr. Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital. \n180   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT                             180 \nThe family sits at the dinner table. \nFATHER God bless this food that we are about to receive. We thank You for this bounty in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. \nAfter they say \"Amen,\" the room falls silent. The family is on pins and needles. No one touches their food. Until... \nCHARLIE How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad? \n", "test1_input": "SAM You could write about us. \nPATRICK Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon.      Make us solve crimes. \nSam laughs.   Charlie smiles. \nCHARLIE You guys look happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend? (off their laughs) What? \nSAM He's my step-brother. My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago. \nPATRICK But Sam's not bitter.     Make no mistake. \nSAM Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic.      I'm a bulim-ist. \nThey laugh at their inside joke.    Charlie has no idea what's so funny. \nCHARLIE I'm sorry.     I don't know what that means. \nPATRICK She just really believes in bulimia. \nSAM (cracking up) I love bulimia. \n26   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      26 \nCharlie hops out of Sam's old truck.    The music blares. \nPATRICK Thanks for paying, Charlie. \nCHARLIE (so eager) No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey... maybe I'll see you around in school? \nSAM (distracted - to Patrick) God, would you turn that down? You're going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie. \nPATRICK Bye, Charlie. \nCHARLIE Okay.   Bye. \nCharlie waves as the truck leaves. The look on his face. The happiness from one night of company. \n27   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      27 \nCharlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news. He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty. He hears the TV playing downstairs in the basement. \n28   INT. DOORWAY TO BASEMENT - NIGHT                                  28 \nAs Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting. \nDEREK (O.S.) I'm sorry. I can't do anything about it. Please talk to me. \nCANDACE (O.S.) Maybe your mom and I should have a \"drive us to our hair appointment\" contest. Then, I could spend a Saturday with you. \nCharlie looks through a slit in the open door to find... \nDEREK There's nothing I can do-- \nCANDACE Do you always want to be a mama's boy? \nDEREK I am not a mama's boy-- \nCANDACE Yes! You are! Every time I go to your house-- \nDEREK Shhh.   Shut u-- \nCANDACE -- your mom says, \"Don't go to Columbia with Candace. Go to Pitt, Derek. Mommy needs you to stay at home because she can't drive herself.\" She's only 51. \nDEREK SHUT UP, CANDACE! \n29   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS                   29 \nCharlie enters, wanting to stop the fight. Derek's neck is red. Dangerous angry. Candace keeps digging. \nCANDACE And you just stand there like a little bitch dog. \nSNAP! Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face. It's not a movie slap. It's a real slap. Dead sound. And after it, silence. Candace turns and sees Charlie. It sobers her up. Charlie moves at Derek. Candace stops him. \n", "test1_true": "She pushes him out of the room and closes the door. \n30   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                       30 \nCharlie sits at his desk. So disturbed. He hears a car start outside. He moves to his window and looks down at Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes. Derek is crying. Candace comforts. After a beat... they kiss. \nCharlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face. \nMOTHER (V.O.) Hey, look who's here... \nFLASHBACK TO: \n31   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                                  31 \nThe door opens to reveal Charlie's mom and AUNT HELEN entering the house. Aunt Helen carries a suitcase. The children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad. They just know they love her. Little Charlie stands at the top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their Sunday clothes. There are balloons. And streamers. \nLITTLE CANDACE Welcome home, Aunt Helen! \nAUNT HELEN Oh.   Look at you all, dressed so nice. \nAunt Helen smiles at Little Charlie on top of the stairs. \nMATCH CUT TO: \n32   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (PRESENT)                                    32 \nCharlie stands at the top of the stairs as Candace enters the house. She is startled when she sees Charlie. They whisper. \nCHARLIE What are you doing? \nCANDACE Look, I egged him on. You saw it. He's never hit me before. I promise he'll never hit me again. \nShe's about to go back downstairs when... \nCHARLIE Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends? \nA silence passes between them.   Then... \nCANDACE Charlie... this is Pony Tail Derek.   I can handle him. Will you trust me? Please, don't tell mom and dad. \nWith a desperately confident nod, Candace goes downstairs. Charlie stands in the entry hall, troubled. \n33   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                          33 \nThe Homecoming Dance is in full swing. God bless everyone. Especially Charlie. He's alone at the wall, dressed in his Sunday suit. To us, adorable. To himself, in living hell. \nCharlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek. As happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the right thing by keeping quiet. The song ends to applause. \nAfter a beat, Charlie turns away. That's when he sees Sam and Patrick at the punch bowl. We hear the first notes of \"Come On, Eileen\" by Dexy's Midnight Runners. \nSAM Oh, my God. They're playing good music. \nPATRICK Holy shit. They are!   They're playing good music! \nSAM (total mischief) Living room routine? \nPATRICK Living room routine! \nCharlie watches Sam and Patrick run to the center of the floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is. It starts slow. \"So over it\" hand moves. A little shoulder. And then, the best of swing. 30 seconds of genius. \nCharlie takes a breath. Then, he tries desperately not to look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them. He bobs his head like a dork. And once he gets close, Patrick and Sam turn and find him. \nSAM & PATRICK Hey! \nWithout a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a circle. Their own island. After a moment, Sam moves around Charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance. \n34   EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         34 \nThe party rages inside this mansion in the rich part of town. Patrick and Sam walk up the steps with Charlie tailing. \nSAM God, it's freezing. \nPATRICK But you wore that toasty costume. It's not like you're trying too hard to be original. \n", "test1_id": 1218, "test2_input": "44   INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON                                         44 \nThe xerox spits out copies of PUNK ROCKY! Halloween Issue! Alice staples while Mary Elizabeth works her like a sled dog. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Her best friend Alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school. She also steals jeans from the mall. I don't know why because her family is rich, but I'm trying not to be judgemental. Especially since I know how they were all there for Patrick last year. Patrick never likes to be serious, so it took me awhile to get what happened. \nSam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life. \n[Note: The following sequence will come from Charlie's POV of Patrick and Brad's activities over a weekend.] \n45   EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT                                    45 \nBrad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the field as Charlie, Patrick, and Sam cheer. Moments later, Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field. \nCHARLIE When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around. \n46   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                           46 \nPatrick whispers while the gang studies their SAT books. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Then, Monday in school, Brad would say, \"Man, I was so wasted. I don't remember a thing.\" This went on for 7 months. \n47   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING                   47 \nCharlie sits with his family in itchy church clothes. He turns to see Brad with his father and mother. Proper family. Brad's dad gives him a pat on the back. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) When they finally did it, Brad said he loved Patrick. Then, he started to cry. CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) saying his dad would kill him. And saying he was going to hell. \n48   INT. LIBRARY - DAY                                              48 \nWe see Patrick and Brad walking in the library. They reach the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they simply... PASS EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him. \nBrad sits down with his football pals. Patrick joins Charlie and Sam at their table. Charlie looks over at Sam, studying hard for her SAT's. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I think that I understand because I really like Sam. I asked my sister about her, and she said that when Sam was a freshman, the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties. I guess she had a reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate for her to judge me based on what I used to be like. \n49   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                   49 \nWe see Charlie making a mix tape on his boom box. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) So, I've been making her a mix tape so she will know how I feel. \nThe two cassettes run. The song is just about to finish when... the side runs out of tape and snaps off. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Ah, shit! \n50   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT                 50 \nThe marquee announces it's time for the... \n51   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT                 51 \n... Rocky Horror Picture Show! The ROCKY EMCEE, dressed as Riff Raff, whips the crowd into a frenzy. \nROCKY EMCEE                           CROWD Gimme an R! Gimme an O!           R-O-C-K-Y!   Rocky!

DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER                      52 \nThe movie is in full swing. Charlie watches Sam as Janet in the Floor Show. Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly. Especially the body. She winks at Charlie as \"Fanfare/Don't Dream It\" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in full drag is... Patrick. \nPATRICK Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same. \nPatrick is a rock star. He approaches Charlie. Putting his ass in his face. Charlie is freaked out and laughing! Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling. \nPATRICK (CONT'D) Give yourself over to absolute pleasure. Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any measure. And sensual daydreams to treasure forever. Can't you just see it? Woah oh oh! \nCharlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick, Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia), CRAIG (21), an art student with a model's body (as Rocky)... and of course... Sam. Charlie watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt). \n53   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT                     53 \n", "test2_true": "ALICE It's gorgeous, Craig.    What did you use? \nCraig is impressive to high school kids. He's a little pretentious. But his art school life. His red wine. His loft. Wow. Right now, he holds court in the wine line. \nCRAIG Color film, but black and white paper for the printing. My professor gave me an \"A,\" but for the wrong reasons. Most of them are idiots. You'll see what I mean when you get to college. How were your SAT's by the way? \nALICE (worried) 1150. I think I'll get into NYU. \nCRAIG Yeah, I hope so. \nMARY ELIZABETH (cruel to Alice) 1490. Harvard. Face! \n54   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                     54 \nCharlie sees Sam alone on the loft steps. She looks a little down. He hands Sam a plastic cup and sits next to her. \nCHARLIE Hey.    Are you okay? \nSAM Yeah.   Yeah. But I got my SAT results back.   Oops. \nCHARLIE You can take them again. \nSAM Yeah, it's just if I'm going to Penn State main campus, I have to do much better. I wish I would have studied freshman year. I was a bit of a mess. \nCHARLIE I'll help you study for the next one. \nSAM Will you? \nCHARLIE Yeah, of course. \nSAM Thanks, Charlie. \nCharlie summons his courage.      He hands her the mix tape. \nSAM (CONT'D) What's this? \nCHARLIE Just a mix tape. No big deal. My parents have a pretty good stereo. It's all about that night in the tunnel. I couldn't find that song we were listening to, but I'm still searching for it, so-- \nSAM It's okay. These are great.   You have really good taste, Charlie. \nCHARLIE Really? \nSAM Yeah. Way better than me as a freshman. I used to listen to the worst top 40. \nCHARLIE No. \nSAM Yeah, I did. But then I heard this old song. Pearly Dew Drops Drop. And I thought someday I would be at a party in college or something. And I'd look up and see this person across the room. And from that moment, I'd know everything was going to be okay. You know what I mean? \nCHARLIE (devastated in love) Yeah. \n55   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER                              55 \nThe tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad. Charlie watches Sam sway to his music like a serenade. Like she is dancing with him. But she isn't. A wider angle reveals that she is slow dancing with... Craig. \nCharlie is 15 year old CRUSHED. No filter. Just feeling. Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth watch Sam across the room. \nALICE So, what do you think? \nPATRICK I don't know. \nALICE I hope it works out. Craig would be a big step up from her last boyfriend. \nMARY ELIZABETH No, shit.     Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser? \nPATRICK I just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys. I keep telling her... don't make yourself small. You can't save anybody. \nCraig dips a smiling Sam as the song ends. Sam goes into the kitchen. Craig approaches Charlie. Turns off his mix tape. \nCRAIG Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid. How about something a little more upbeat? \nCraig grabs a record from the pile and slaps it down. \nCRAIG (CONT'D) Sam tells me you want to be a writer. \n", "test2_id": 1219, "test3_input": "SAM (CONT'D) Isn't it quiet? \nCHARLIE Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you? \nSAM All the time. So, you want to put on these glasses? They'll protect you. \nSam puts her arm around his shoulder. Protecting him. Charlie looks through the glasses. The sky bends like a globe. When he breathes, the sky ripples. \n78   INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        78 \nCharlie wanders through the party, tripping out of his mind. He sits down on the sofa. The world unbends as Charlie takes off the glasses. Kids walk around the party, leaving ghosts of themselves behind. \nCharlie looks upstairs to find... Sam and Craig kissing. Craig leads her to the bedroom. \nCharlie looks back at the party as kids gather for the New Years countdown. Patrick leads the charge. \nPATRICK \n79   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                       79 \nIn a QUICK FLASH, we see 7 year old Charlie with Aunt Helen on Christmas Eve.

Charlie lays down and starts moving his arms in the snow. The memories begin to haunt him. \n82   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                         82 \n7 year old Charlie waves goodbye to Aunt Helen as she drives away through the landing strip for Santa Claus. \n83   EXT.

AUNT HELEN'S CAR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                         84 \nAunt Helen drives past a tall snow drift. She looks down at the 45 of The Beatles in the seat next to her. She smiles at Charlie's birthday present. Then, she looks up as the headlights of the semi truck smash the windows with a CRASH! \n85   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          85 \nCharlie's mother opens the door, revealing a POLICEMAN. He turns to Charlie in his party hat. 7 years old and confused. \n86   EXT.

He is terrified and does what any kid would do. He lies his ass off. \nPOLICEMAN Did your older friends pressure you? \nCHARLIE No one pressured me into anything. I would never do drugs, officer. Never. \nPOLICEMAN Then, how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6 in the morning? \nCHARLIE Well, um... I was really tired, and uh... I was feeling feverish. So, I went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air. And I started seeing things. So, I passed out. \nHe waits to see if this worked.

The Stranger. \nCHARLIE Did you have fun on your break? \nBILL More fun than you're going to have today, Sinatra. \nBill pats his shoulder and moves on.

Craig flaked out on us again. I need a Rocky. Brad? \nBRAD HAYS (scared) No way. There are people out here. \nThe group is deflated. They all start thinking.

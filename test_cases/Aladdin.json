{"test1_input": "ALADDIN:        Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found her. I've been looking all over for you. JASMINE:        (whispering) What are you doing? ALADDIN:        (whispering back) Just play along. PROPRIETOR: You know this girl? JASMINE:        Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little crazy.  (He circles his finger around his ear. She is shocked.  The PROPRIETOR grabs him by the vest.) PROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan! ALADDIN:        She thinks the monkey is the Sultan. \n(ABU is picking a pocket.  He hears this, then straightens up. JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.) \nJASMINE:        Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you? ABU:            Well, blah blah blah blah. ALADDIN:        Tragic, isn't it?  (He leans forward, picking up another apple from the cart with his foot.) But, no harm done.  (Walks over to Jasmine.)  Now come along sis. Time to see the doctor. JASMINE:        (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor. How are you? ALADDIN:        No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan. \n(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he's stolen from the cart falls out.) \nPROPRIETOR: Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here, you little thieves! \n(Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab.  IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre contraption.  At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.) \nIAGO:       (huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm? JAFAR:  Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the SULTAN's ring in the contraption.) IAGO:       Yes, o mighty evil one. \n(IAGO runs faster.  A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing into an hourglass below.  The sands begin to swirl.) \nJAFAR:  Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can enter the cave.  (The sand in top forms the Cave of Wonders.  It falls through into a storm, but it shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) Yes, yes! There he is.  My diamond in the rough! IAGO:       That's him?!?!   That's the clown we've been waitin' for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked into the gears.) JAFAR:  Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we? \n(IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.) \nIAGO:   Swell. \n", "test1_true": "ALADDIN:    Almost there. \n(JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms. She stands up.) \nJASMINE:    I want to thank you for stopping that man. ALADDIN:    Uh, forget it.  (He grabs a pole.)  So, uh, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh? \n(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.) \nJASMINE:    Is it that obvious? ALADDIN:    Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her, still in love.  She returns the look.  But he realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.) I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned down, she vaults over his head.  He looks back in surprise.  She tosses the pole to him.  Both ALADDIN's and ABU's eyes bulge.) JASMINE:    I'm a fast learner. ALADDIN:    Right.  C'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof of a building, dodging planks and beams as they go.)  Whoa.  Watch your head there.  Be careful. JASMINE:    Is this where you live? ALADDIN:    Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please. JASMINE:    Fabulous. ALADDIN:    Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and exposes the palace) but it's got a great view. Palace looks pretty amazing, huh? JASMINE:    Oh, it's wonderful. ALADDIN:    I wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and valets... JASMINE:    Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how to dress. ALADDIN:    It's better than here.  Always scraping for food and ducking the guards. JASMINE:    You're not free to make your own choices. ALADDIN:    Sometimes you feel so-- JASMINE:    You're just-- BOTH:       (in unison) --trapped. \n(They look at each other, realizing that they're perfect for one another.  But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the look.  He takesthe apple out of ABU's hand and rolls it down his arm into the hand of JASMINE.) \nALADDIN:    So, where're you from? JASMINE:    What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not going back. ALADDIN:    Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted look on his face.) ABU:        Why you! \n(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.) \nJASMINE:    My father's forcing me to get married. ALADDIN:    That's--that's awful.  (ABU appears from behind the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu! \n(ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.) \nJASMINE:    What? ALADDIN:    Abu says that--uh--that's not fair. ABU:        What? JASMINE:    Oh did he? ALADDIN:    Yeah, of course. JASMINE:    And does Abu have anything else to say? ALADDIN:    Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help. ABU:        Oh, boy! JASMINE:    Hmm, tell him that's very sweet. \n", "test1_id": 21, "test2_input": "(He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and the CARPET begins to follow again.  Again, ABU turns back, but the CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.) \nABU:        Aladdin!  Aladdin! ALADDIN:    Abu, will ya knock it off? \n(Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet jumps to the other side.  It reaches down with a tassel and pulls ABU's tail.  When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other side.  This time, ABU lands in a karate stance.  CARPET reaches down and plucks ABU's hat off, then puts it on himself.  ABU sits thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his face.  ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away.  ABU tackles ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.) \nALADDIN:    Abu, what are you--crazy? \n(The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.) \nALADDIN:    A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.  I'm not gonna hurt you. \n(The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts it off.  It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to him.  ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulder.) \nALADDIN:    Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite. \n(The CARPET again picks up ABU's hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes his fist and screeches at it.  CARPET begins to walk away, \"sadly.\") \nALADDIN:    Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Maybe you can help us.  (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies over and wraps around the pair.)  Hey, whoa!  You see, we're trying to find this lamp.  (CARPET motions for them to follow it.)  I think he knows where it is. \n(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant underground cavern.  In the centre of the room is a tall pillar, with a staircase going up to it.  It is surrounded by water with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge.  At the top of the pillar is a beam of light.  ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.) \n", "test2_true": "(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a giant ruby.  ABU is hypnotically drawn to it.   ALADDIN climbs the stairs quickly.  CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.) \nALADDIN:    This is it?  This is what we came all the way down here to--  (He looks down and sees ABU break free of CARPET's hold and lunge toward the jewel.)  Abu- NO! \n(ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to shake.) \nCAVE VOICE: Infidels! ABU:            Uh oh! CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you will never again see the light of day! \n(ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock is exploding.) \nALADDIN:    Whoa!  Carpet, let's move! \n(Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.) \nALADDIN:    Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off his head and sees they are flying into a wall.) Start panicking. \n(CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top, within reach.) \nALADDIN:    Help me out! OLD MAN:    Throw me the lamp! ALADDIN:    I can't hold on.  Give me your hand. OLD MAN:    First give me the lamp! \n(ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.) \n", "test2_id": 22, "test3_input": "(JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop. ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.) \nALADDIN:    Abu?  Abu!  (He looks back at a shivering pile of snow.)  Oh, this is all my fault--I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.  (He digs out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.)  Abu! Are you okay?  I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of everything, somehow.  I gotta go back and set things right.  (He starts to walk through the snow, and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET.) Carpet!  (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by the pillar.  He tugs to try and free CARPET.  He can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the base of the pillar.)   Abu, start digging!  That's it!  (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and the pillar begins to roll.  ALADDIN runs away, looks back, then slides into place.  The pillar rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by the window of the pillar.)  Yeah!  All right!  (He looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU. CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick them up.)  Now, back to Agrabah!  Let's go! \n(We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.) \nIAGO:       Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker. Shove 'em all right down your throat.  Here, have lots! \n(JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.) \nJAFAR:  Leave him alone! \n(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.) \nJAFAR:  It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.) A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen... \n(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.) \nJASMINE:    Never! JAFAR:  I'll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he raises his hand to slap her.  Then he stops.)  No. Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.  I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me. \n(We see ALADDIN race back into town.) \n", "test3_true": "(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to play along.) \nJASMINE:    (She stands and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar!  I never realized how incredibly handsome you are. \n(The GENIE's jaw drops.) \nJAFAR:  That's better.  (He pulls the GENIE's jaw up like a shade.)  Now, pussycat, tell me more about...myself. JASMINE:    You're tall, well dressed... \n(JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE sees them.) \nGENIE:  Al!  Al, little buddy! ALADDIN:    Shh! GENIE:  (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.) Al, I can't help you--I work for senor psychopath, now.  (His head turns into JAFAR's, then back.) ALADDIN:    Hey--I'm a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE's mouth.)  I'll improvise. \n(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.) \nJAFAR:  Go on. JASMINE:    And your beard...is so...twisted!  (She has her arms around him.  She pretends to twist with her finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN to come over.  He makes his move.  IAGO sees him.) \nIAGO:       Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.) JAFAR:  And the street rat? JASMINE:    What street rat? \n(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.) \nABU:        Yuck! JAFAR:  That was--(he sees ALADDIN's reflection in her crown.) You!!  How many times do I have to kill you, boy? \n", "test3_id": 23}

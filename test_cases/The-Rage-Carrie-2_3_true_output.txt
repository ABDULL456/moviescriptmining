THE FRONT DOOR as RACHEL opens the door. 
RACHEL What'd you forget your-- There's nobody there. 
(WEAKLY) --keys? She looks around, closes the door, locks it, wraps her towel tighter. 
LIVING ROOM As she crosses back to her room. There's a KNOCKING on the kitchen back door. She frowns, goes to the back door, looks through the glass. No one there either. Now she's worried. 
. ' RACHEL (calls through the door) Boyd? Emilyn? She turns when the DOOR HANDLE on the front door JIGGLES once. She stops dead. Spins as... The BACK DOOR handle starts JIGGLING. She backs into the living room and spins as-- Something starts TAPPING on one of the living room WINDOWS. Like a wave moving around her, a WINDOW on the other side starts TAPPING. RACHEL turns a full circle, scared, surrounded by TAPPING and JIGGLING, which grow increasingly loud r. She puts her palms against her temples, as if struggling to keep something bottled inside: 
RACHEL Oh, god, oh, god. Not now. Stop Suddenly all goes silent. She jumps as... The PHONE RINGS near her. She scoops up the cordless. Beat. 
RACHEL Hello? 
There's a long pause on the other end. 
MALE VOICE (V.0.)

HER BEDROOM where a bandaged WALTER is on the bed, looking alarmed. RACHEL keeps backing up, nearing her open closet door. 
RACHEL I'm calling the police. She hangs up, dials 911, fumbling with the knife.

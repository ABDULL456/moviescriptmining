The Photographer and his Assitant start to move off with their equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the hall. 
RAYMOND What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson? 
THOMPSON Millions - if anybody wants it. 
RAYMOND The banks are out of luck, eh? 
THOMPSON Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right. 
ASSISTANT "Venus," Fourth Century.  Acquired 1911.  Cost twenty-three thousand. Got it? 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Okay. 
ASSISTANT (patting the statue on the fanny) That's a lot of money to pay for a dame without a head. 
SECOND ASSISTANT (reading a label) No. 483.  One desk from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado.  Value $6.00. 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Okay. 
A flashlight bulb goes off. 
SECOND ASSISTANT We're all set to get everything. The junk as well as the art. 
Thompson has opened a box and is idly playing with a handful of little pieces of cardboard. 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN What's that? 
RAYMOND It's a jigsaw puzzle. 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN We got a lot of those.  There's a Burmese Temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall. 
Raymond laughs. 
PHOTOGRAPHER Yeah, all in crates. 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it. 
PHOTOGRAPHER I wonder how they put all those pieces together? 
ASSISTANT (reading a label) Iron stove.  Estate of Mary Kane. Value $2.00. 
PHOTOGRAPHER Put it over by that statue.  It'll make a good setup. 
GIRL (calling out) Who is she anyway? 
SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN Venus.  She always is. 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN He sure liked to collect things, didn't he? 
RAYMOND He went right on buying - right up to the end. 
PHOTOGRAPHER Anything and everything - he was a regular crow. 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell? 
Thompson has turned around.  He is facing the camera for the first time. 
THOMPSON Charles Foster Kane. 
Another flash bulb goes off.  The Photographer turns to Thompson with a grin. 
PHOTOGRAPHER Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry? 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN (to the dancers) Turn that thing off, will you? It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud? 
PHOTOGRAPHER Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry? (to the Third Newspaperman) That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry?  Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry? 
THOMPSON No, I didn't. 
The music has stopped.  The dancers have come over to Thompson. 
SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN Say, what did you find out about him, anyway, Jerry? 
THOMPSON Not much. 
SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN Well, what have you been doing? 
THOMPSON Playing with a jigsaw puzzle -   I talked to a lot of people who knew him. 
GIRL What do they say? 
THOMPSON Well - it's become a very clear picture.  He was the most honest man who ever lived, with a streak of crookedness a yard wide.  He was a liberal and a reactionary; he was tolerant - "Live and Let Live" - that was his motto.  But he had no use for anybody who disagreed with him on any point, no matter how small it was.  He was a loving husband and a good father - and both his wives left him and his son got himself killed about as shabbily as you can do it.  He had a gift for friendship such as few men have - he broke his oldest friend's heart like you'd throw away a cigarette you were through with.  Outside of that - 
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN Okay, okay. 
GIRL What about Rosebud?  Don't you think that explains anything? 
THOMPSON No, I don't.  Not much anway. Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it.  Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. No, I don't think it explains anything.  I don't think any word explains a man's life.  No -  I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece. 
He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his watch. 
THOMPSON We'd better get along.  We'll miss the train.

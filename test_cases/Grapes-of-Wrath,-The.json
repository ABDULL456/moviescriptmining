{"test1_input": "TOM (shaking hands) If this don't beat all! (Chuckling) Well, I see you been busy already! \nROSASHARN (gasping) You do not see either!--not yet! \nAt the whoop of laughter that goes up from all, she turns in a fine simulation of maidenly mortification, and throws herself into Connie's arms, hiding her face against his chest. After a moment of surprise, a slow, happy, fatuous grin begins to broaden his face. He beams, whereupon their delight increases, the men roaring and jeering and slapping their legs, the women making modest efforts to suppress their amusement. \nOMNES Lookut his face! Y'see his face? Lookut Rosasharn! Y'ever see anything like her face when Tom said it? Look around, Rosasharn! Let's see it again! \nAn automobile horn sounds sharply. Their laughter halted as though cut by a knife, they look off. A TOURING CAR has stopped in the road by the house, the engine still running. One man drives, the other talks. \nMAN Hey, Joad! John Joad! \nIn the BACKYARD the people are silent, their faces without expression, as all gaze toward the touring car. \nMAN Ain't forgot, have you? \nJOHN We ain't forgot. \nMAN Comin' through here tomorrow, you know. \nJOHN I know. We be out. We be out by sunup. \nThe touring car's engine is still heard after the men drive off. The Joads watch the car, their heads turning, their eyes following, expressionless. \nThe scene dissolves to the BACKYARD just before dawn. Now and then a rooster crows. A couple of lanterns light the scene as the man load the truck. It is nearly done, the body piled high but flat with boxes, and more tied on running boards. Al has the hood open and is working on the motor. \nNoah, Casy, Uncle John, Connie, Pa, and Tom are at various tasks. They talk as they work. \nTOM (to Pa) How you get all this money? \nPA Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that. \nTOM (dryly) Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they? \nAL (proudly closing the hood) She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride! \nPA Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? (He casts a critical eye over the truck) \nINSIDE THE CABIN, Ma sits on a box in front of the stove. The fire door is open and the light shines out. The room itself has been pretty well stripped, with only trash and discarded things left. In Ma's lap is a pasteboard shoebox and she is going through the meager treasures stored in it, to see what must go and what she can take with her. Her eyes are soft and thoughtful as each item brings a memory, but not sad. Occasionally she smiles faintly. She pulls out a letter, looks at it, starts to throw it into the fire, then puts it back in the box. Her hand pulls out a PICTURE POSTCARD. We see it in Ma's hand. It is a picture of the Statue Of Liberty. Over it: \"Greetings from New York City.\" She turns it over. It is addressed: \"Mrs. Joad RFD 254 Oklahomy Territory.\" In the space for a message: \"Hello honey. Willy Mae.\" \nMA, after a moment of studying it, throws the card into the fire. She lifts the letter again, puts it back. She pulls out a worn NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. We see it in Ma's hand. The headline is: \"JOAD GETS SEVEN YEARS.\" \nMA drops the clipping into the fire. Rummaging around, she pulls out a small CHINA DOG. We see it closely as before. On it is printed: \"Souvenir of Louisiana Purchase Exposition-- St. Louis--1904.\" \nMA studies the dog, smiling, remembering something that it meant in her life. Then she puts in in a pocket in her dress. Next she pulls out some pieces of cheap jewelry; one cuff link, a baby's signet ring, two earrings. She smiles at the ring, then pockets it. The cuff link too. The earrings she holds for a moment longer, then looks around to make sure nobody sees, then holds them to her ears, not looking into any kind of a mirror, just feeling them against the lobes of her ears, as once perhaps she wore them. Her eyes are grave. \nTOM (from the door) How about it, Ma? \nMA I'm ready. \nTom disappears. Ma looks at the earrings, and then at the contents of the box. She lifts out the letter again and looks at it. Then, without drama, she drops it into the fire. She watches it burn. Her eyes are still on the flame as she calls. \nMA Rosasharn honey! Wake up the chillun. We're fixin' to leave. \nThe flame dies down. \nIn the BACKYARD it is grey dawn. There is a thrill of quiet excitement as they all stand around the loaded truck, hats on, putting on coats. The ones missing are Ma, Rosasharn, the children, and Grampa. Pa is in charge. \nPA (as Ma comes out of the cabin) Where's Grampa? Al, go git him. \nGRANMA (trying to climb in the front seat) I'm gonna sit up front! Somebody he'p me! \nTom easily lifts her up the step. The two children come running out of the house, chanting. \nRUTHIE AND WINFIELD Goin' to California! Goin' to California! \nPA You kids climb up first, on top. (all obey as he directs) Al's gonna drive, Ma. You sit up there with him and Granma and we'll swap around later. \n", "test1_true": "PA Connie, you he'p Rosasharn up there alongside Ruthie and Winfiel'. (Looking around) Where's Grampa? \nGRANMA (with a cackle) Where he al'ays is, prob'ly! \nPA Well, leave him a place, but Noah, you and John, y'all kinda find yourself a place--kinda keep it even all around. \nAll have obeyed and are aboard but Pa, Tom, and Casy, who is watching the springs flatten out. \nTOM Think she'll hold? \nCASY If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture. \nGRAMPA'S VOICE Lemmo go, gol dang it! Lemmo go, I tell you! \nAll turn. In a CORNER OF THE HOUSE Al is pulling Grampa gently but firmly, the old man holding back, and furious. He flails feebly at Al, who holds his head out of the way without effort. \nAL He wasn't sleepin'. He was settin' out back a the barn. They's somepin' wrong with him. \nGRAMPA Ef you don't let me go-- \nAl permits Grampa to jerk loose and sit down on the doorstep. The old man is miserable and frightened and angry, too old to understand or accept such a violent change in his life. Tom and Pa come up to him. The others watch solemnly from their places in the truck. \nTOM What's the matter, Grampa? \nGRAMPA (dully, sullenly) Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all. \nPA What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay. \nGRAMPA I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'. \nPA But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out. \nGRAMPA All but me! I'm a-stayin'. \nTOM How 'bout Granma? \nGRAMPA (fiercely) Take her with you! \nMA (getting out of the truck) But who'd cook for you? How'd you live? \nGRAMPA Muley's livin', ain't he? And I'm *twicet* the man Muley is! \nPA (on his knee) Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute. \nGRAMPA (grimly) And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do. (Angrily) And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California! (Picking up some dirt) This here's my country. I b'long *here*. (Looking at the dirt) It ain't no good-- (after a pause) --but it's mine. \nTOM (after a silence) Ma. Pa. (They move toward the cabin with him) Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt. \nGRAMPA (loudly) And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'. \nAll watch him worriedly. \nINSIDE THE CABIN: \nTOM Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here. \nPA Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self. (After thought) Reckon we could git him *drunk*? \nTOM Ain't no whisky, is they? \nMA Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here. (In the trash in the corner) It put the chillun to sleep. \nTOM (tasting it) Don't taste bad. \nMA (looking in the pot) And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup... \nTOM That's right. And douse some in it. \n", "test1_id": 1107, "test2_input": "RUTHIE AND WINFIELD huddle together in THE TRUCK, eyes wide with excitement. \nRUTHIE This here's the desert an' we're right in it! \nWINFIELD (trying to see) I wisht it was day. \nRUTHIE Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you. (Trying to see too) I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place. \nWINFIELD Man bones? \nRUTHIE Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones. \nMA AND GRANDMA are seen again. The old woman lies still, breathing noisily. Ma continues to pat her. \nMA (whispering) 'S awright, honey. Everything's gonna be awright. \nThen we see the TRUCK still churning along Highway 66 by night. CASY is asleep in the truck, his face wet with sweat. CONNIE AND ROSASHARN are huddled together, damp and weary. \nROSASHARN Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd. \nCONNIE (sullenly) Women is always tar'd. \nROSASHARN (fearfully) You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey? \nCONNIE (slowly) No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work. \nROSASHARN (pleadingly) But we can still do it, honey. \nCONNIE (sullenly) I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this. \nHer eyes widen with fright as he avoids meeting her glance. \nMA AND GRANDMA lie side by side. Ma's hand is on Grandma's heart. The old woman's eyes are shut and her breathing is almost imperceptible. \nMA (whispering) We can't give up, honey. The family's got to get acrost. You know that. \nJOHN'S VOICE Ever'thing all right? \nMa does not answer immediately. Her head lifted, she is staring at Granma's face. Then slowly she withdraws her hand from Grandma's heart. \nMA (slowly) Yes, ever'thing's all right. I--I guess I dropped off to sleep. \nHer head rests again. She lies looking fixedly at the still face. \nThe scene dissolves to an INSPECTION STATION, near Daggett, California, at night. Obeying a sign that reads: \"KEEP RIGHT AND STOP,\" the Joad truck pulls up under a long shed as two officers, yawning, come out to inspect it. One takes down the license number and opens the hood. The people aboard the truck bestir themselves sleepily. \nTOM What's this here? \nOFFICER Agricultural inspection. We got to go over your stuff. Got any vegetables or seed? \nTOM No. \nOFFICER Well, we got to look over your stuff. You got to unload. \nMA gets down off the truck, her face swollen, her eyes hard. There is an undercurrent of hysteria in her voice and manner. \nMA Look, mister. We got a sick ol' lady. We got to get her to a doctor. We can't wait. (Almost hysterically) You can't make us wait! \nOFFICER Yeah? Well, we got to look you over. \nMA I swear we ain't got anything. I swear it. An' Granma's awful sick. (Pulling him to the truck) Look! \nThe officer lights his flashlight on Granma's face. \nOFFICER (shocked) You wasn't foolin'! You swear you got no fruit or vegetables? \nMA No, I swear it. \n", "test2_true": "Ma climbs back up beside Granma. \nTOM Okay, cap. Much oblige. \nThe truck starts. \nMA (to John) Tell Tom he don't have to stop. Granma's all right. \nThe TRUCK moves away on Highway 66. \nThe scene dissolves to the TEHACHAPI VALLEY, by day. Taking it from the book, there is a breath-taking view of the valley from where Highway 66 comes out of the mountains. This is the California the Joads have dreamed of, rich and beautiful, the land of milk and honey. It is just daybreak, with the sun at the Joad's back. They have pulled off the side of the road and stopped, just to drink in the sight. They are looking almost reverently at the sight before them as they climb stiffly out of the truck. \nAL Will ya look at her! \nPA (shaking his head) I never knowed they was anything like her! \nOne by one, they climb down. \nTOM Where's Ma? I want Ma to see it. Look, Ma! Come here, Ma! \nHe starts back. MA is holding to the rear of the truck, her face stiff and swollen, her eyes deep-sunk, her limbs weak and shaky. \nTOM (shocked) Ma, you sick? \nMA (hoarsely) Ya say we're acrost? \nTOM (eagerly) Look, Ma! \nMA Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. (Her knees buckle and she sits down on the running board) \nTOM Didn' you get no sleep? \nMA No. \nTOM Was Granma bad? \nMA (after a pause) Granma's dead. \nTOM (shocked) When? \nMA Since before they stopped us las' night. \nTOM An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look? \nMA (nodding) I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped. \nWith the valley for background, Ma looks down on it. \nMA (softly) So it's all right. At leas' she'll get buried in a nice green place. Trees and flowers aroun'. (Smiling sadly) She got to lay her head down in California after all. \nThe scene fades out. \nA TOWN STREET, by day, fades in. Down a town or small city business street, with quite a bit of traffic, comes the Joad truck being pushed by the Joad men. At the wheel, aiming at a corner gas station, is Rosasharn, frightened and uncertain, with Ma beside her on the front seat. In the back Ruthie and Winfield are delighted with this new form of locomotion. Crossing the street, a policeman falls into step with Tom. \nPOLICEMAN How far you figger you gonna get *this* way? \nTOM Right here. We give out a gas. \nIt is a two-pump station and one of the pumps has a car, with the attendant servicing it. The Joad truck stops by the other pump and Tom, wiping his face with his sleeve, grins and address himself to the policeman. The others stand listening solemnly in the background. \nTOM Where's the bes' place to get some work aroun' here? (Pulling out the handbill) Don't matter what kin' either. \nPOLICEMAN (patiently) If I seen one a them things I must a seen ten thousan'. \nPA Ain't it no good? \nPOLICEMAN (shaking his head) Not here--not now. Month ago there was some pickin' but it's all moved south now. Where'bouts in Oklahoma you from? \n", "test2_id": 1108, "test3_input": "AT THE GATES the heckling from the bystanders is spasmodic, not continuous, as the six jalopies in line pass through the gate into the Hooper ranch. Two men stand beside the gates with shotguns. They keep calling. \nMEN Go on, go on! Keep movin'! \nThe Joad truck passes through the gates. IN THE HOOPER RANCH the six jalopies are halted at the end of a camp street. The houses are small, square blocks, set in line. One, a little larger, is a grocery store. Casually about are men in pairs with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands. Two bookkeepers are already passing down the cars and jotting down information. \nBOOKKEEPER Want to work? \nTOM Sure, but what is this? \nBOOKKEEPER That's not your affair. Name. \nTOM Joad. \nBOOKKEEPER How many men? \nTOM Four. \nBOOKKEEPER Women? \nTOM Two. \nBOOKKEEPER Kids? \nTOM Two. \nBOOKKEEPER Can all of you work? \nTOM Why, I guess so. \nBOOKKEEPER Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away. \nHe moves to the next car. The Joad truck starts... \nAT HOUSE 63, as the Joad truck pulls up, two deputies approach. They look closely into each face as the Joads pile out. One of the deputies has a long list in his hand. \nFIRST DEPUTY Name. \nTOM (impatiently) Joad. Say, what is this here? \nSECOND DEPUTY (consulting list) Not here. Take a look at his license. \nFIRST DEPUTY 542-567 Oklahoma. \nSECOND DEPUTY Ain't got it. Guess they're okay. (To Tom) Now you look here. We don't want no trouble with you. Jes' do your work and mind your own business and you'll be all right. (The deputies walk away) \nTOM They sure do want to make us feel at home all right. \nMa and Rosasharn step inside the house. It is filthy. A rusty tin stove resting on four bricks is all the one room contains. Ma and Rosasharn stand looking around at it. Finally: \nROSASHARN We gonna live here? \nMA (after a moment) Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out. \nROSASHARN I like the tent better. \nMA This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains. \nOUTSIDE, a clerk with glasses appears, pushing a cart loaded with three-gallon buckets. \nCLERK Name? \nTOM (patiently) It's still Joad. \nCLERK (doling out the buckets) How many? \nMA (at the door) Six. (To Tom) All y'all go. Me an' Rosasharn'll unload. \n", "test3_true": "The scene dissolves to the INTERIOR OF HOUSE 63 at night, a lantern lighting the scene. Sitting wherever they can, the Joads have finished their supper of hamburgers. And grateful they are too, for the meat. \nTOM (wiping his mouth) Got any more, Ma? \nMA No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth. \nPA That! \nMA They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place. \nTOM I ain't full. \nMA Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty. \nPA (rising) You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back. \nTOM Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me? \nPA No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed. \nAL Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl. \nTOM Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious. \nJOHN I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there. \nTOM (laughing) Okay. I be back a little later. \nMA You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything. \nTOM (leaving) Okay, Ma. Don't you worry. \nIN THE RANCH STREET. There is a faint moonlight, but not much, and little sound from the other houses as Tom strolls down the street. \nNEAR THE GATE: beyond, cars pass. As Tom approaches the gate a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises from a box. \nGUARD Where you think you're going? \nTOM Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it? \nGUARD Well, you just turn around and walk the other way. \nTOM You mean I can't even get outa here? \nGUARD Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back? \nTOM I'll walk back. \nThe guard watches him as he walks back and then douses his flashlight. \nAt a SECTION OF WIRE FENCE, watching his chance, moving silently, Tom drops on the ground, on his back, gets his head under the bottom wire, and pushes himself under and outside. Rising, he crosses the paved highway. \nAN EMBANKMENT across the road from the wire fence: Tom clambers down it, moving quietly. He picks his way down the shallow ravine. \nA TENT: there is a light inside and there are the shadows of figures. In the background, beyond the tent, is the silhouette of a small concrete bridge spanning a small stream. Following a trail, Tom enters and approaches the tent. (The opening is away from him.) IN FRONT OF THE TENT, a man sitting on a box looks up suspiciously as Tom enters. His name is Joe. \nTOM Evenin'. \nJOE Who are you? \nTOM Jus' goin' pas', that's all. \nJOE Know anybody here? \nTOM No. Jus' goin' pas', I tell you. \nA head sticks out of the tent. Until he speaks, Tom does not recognize Casy. \n", "test3_id": 1109}

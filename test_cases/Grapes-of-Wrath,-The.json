{"train": "TOM Didn't you hear? It was in the papers. \nCASY No, I never. What? \nTOM I been in the penitentiary for four years. (He drinks) \nCASY Excuse me for asking. \nTOM I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash. \nCASY And you ain't ashamed? \nTOM (shaking his head) He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole. \nCASY Ain't you seen your folks since then? \nTOM (putting on his coat) No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going? \nCASY (putting on his sneaker) It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other. (Rising) I'll go your way. \nThey pause at the edge of the shade, squint up at the sky, and then move off. \nThe scene dissolves to the SURFACE OF A DIRT ROAD by daylight. Leaves are scuttling across it. The top soil begins to fly up. It is not a hard wind as yet, but it is steady and persistent. Tom's and Casy's feet walk into sight. \nTOM Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas. \nCASY I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that. \nTOM (worriedly) Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'! \nCASY Shore it is. It always is, this time a year. \nTom, holding his cap on his head with his hand, looks up... The TOPS OF THE TREES are bending before the wind. TOM AND CASY continue walking. \nCASY Is it fur? \nTOM (still looking back) Just around that next bend. \nTOM AND CASY are almost being blown along and dust is rising from the road. \nCASY (lifting his voice above the wind) Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist. \nTOM (pointing ahead) That's our place. \nThe JOAD CABIN is an ancient, bleak, sway-backed building. There is neither sign of life or habitation about it. \nCASY (looking back) And it ain't any too close, either! We better run! \nA DUST STORM, like a black wall, rises into the sky, moving forward. TOM AND CASY are running, but looking back over their shoulders as the DUST STORM nears. Dust rises from the ground to join and thicken the black wall. \nTOM AND CASY are seen racing down the road to the cabin, the wind whipping up the dust. The two men smack open the door and slam it shut after them. The screen begins to grow dark as the storm sweeps over the land. It becomes black. \nIn THE CABIN, it is black too, but the sound is different. In addition to the sound of the wind there is the soft hissing of sand against the house. \nTOM'S VOICE Ma?... Pa?... Ain't nobody here? (After a long silence) Somepin's happened. \nCASY'S VOICE You got a match? \nTOM'S VOICE There was some pieces of candle always on a shelf. \nPresently, after shuffling about, he has found them and lights one. He holds it up, lighting the room. A couple of wooden boxes are on the floor, a few miserable discarded things, and that's all. Tom's eyes are bewildered. \nTOM They're all gone--or dead. \nCASY They never wrote you nothing? \nTOM No. They wasn't people to write. \nTHE MAN You know who owns the land--the Shawnee Land and Cattle Company. \nMULEY Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny? \nTHE MAN It ain't nobody. It's a company. \nSON They got a pres'dent, ain't they? They got somebody that knows what a shotgun's for, ain't they? \nTHE MAN But it ain't *his* fault, because the *bank* tells him what to do. \nSON (angrily) All right. Where's the bank? \nTHE MAN (fretfully) Tulsa. But what's the use of picking on him? He ain't anything but the manager, and half crazy hisself, trying to keep up with his orders from the east! \nMULEY (bewildered) Then who *do* we shoot? \nTHE MAN (stepping on the starter) Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame! \nMULEY (angrily) Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off! \nThe scene dissolves to the BACK ROOM. The sound of the storm is heard again as Tom and Casy watch Muley. \nTOM (angrily) Well? \nMULEY (without emotion) They come. They come and pushed me off. \nWe see MULEY at close range. \nMULEY They come with the cats. \nTOM'S VOICE The what? \nMULEY The cats--the caterpillar tractors. \nThe scene dissolves to a MONTAGE OF TRACTORS: tractors looming over hillocks, flattening fences, through gullies, their drivers looking like robots, with goggles, dust masks over mouth and nose--one after the other, crossing and recrossing as if to convey the impression that this was an invasion of machine-men from some other world. \nMULEY'S VOICE And for ever' one of 'em ten-fifteen families gets throwed outa their homes--one hundred folks with no place to live but on the road. The Rances, the Perrys, the Peterses, the Joadses--one after another they got throwed out. Half the folks you and me know--throwed right out into the road. The one that got me come a month ago. \nThe scene dissolves to MULEY'S FARM. We see the backs of Muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them. It is at some distance. Muley holds a shotgun. His son has a baling hook. The son-in-law has a two-by-four. Behind them is their cabin. Frightened and huddled together are the women and children. The roar of the tractor comes closer. \nMULEY (shouting) You come any closer and I'm gonna blow you right outa that cat! (He lifts his shotgun) \nThe TRACTOR continues to lumber along, its driver goggled and black of face where his dust mask doesn't cover. MULEY lifts his shotgun to his shoulder, and aims. \nMULEY I *tol'* you! \nThe TRACTOR stops. The driver takes off his goggles and dust mask. Like the others he's a country boy. His face is sullen. Muley is lowering his shotgun. There is a surprise in his face as he recognizes the driver. \nMULEY Why, you're Joe Davis's boy! \nHe moves forward, followed by his son and son-in-law in the TRACTOR. Davis is wiping his face as they walk toward him. \nDAVIS I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me. \nMULEY Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people? \nDAVIS For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout. \nMULEY But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand? \nDAVIS (putting his goggles back on) *Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now. \nWe see THE WOMENFOLKS. A small girl pulls her mother's dress. \nGIRL What's he fixin' to do, ma? \nMA Hush! \nMAN (in car) Muley? (After a pause) He ain't here. \nThe car moves on. \nTOM, CASY AND MULEY lie flat, listening to the sound of the car going away. \nTOM Anybody ever 'tol me I'd be hidin' out on my own place...! \nHe whistles, as the scene fades out. \nDRIED CORNSTALKS, seen by daylight, fade in. The cornstalks, their roots blown clean and clear of the earth, lie fallen in one direction. This is what has happened to farms that were once rich and green. Then Uncle John's cabin comes into view. It is just after sunup. The air is filled with country sounds--a shrill chorus of birds, a dog barking in the distance. The cabin is of the same general appearance as the Joad cabin but even smaller. Smoke curls from the chimney. \nWe see a PLATTER ON A TABLE, inside the cabin. The platter is filled with sidemeat. Over the scene comes Ma Joad's voice. \nMA'S VOICE Lord, make us thankful for what we are about to receive, for His sake. Amen. \nAs she speaks, a man's scrawny hand reaches forward and sneaks out a piece of sidemeat. \nFive people are seated around the breakfast table on chairs or boxes. They are Pa, Grampa, Granma, Noah, and Uncle John. Two children, Ruthie and Winfield, stand to the table, because there are no more chairs. Their heads are all bent as Ma, standing with a fork in her hand between the table and the stove, ends the grace. Heads lift and there is a bustle as Ma turns back to the frying pork on the stove and the others truck into their food. Granma points a spiteful finger at Grampa. \nGRANMA I seen you!--You et durin' grace! \nGRAMPA (indignantly) One little ole dab!--one teeny little ole dab! \nRUTHIE AND WINFIELD, though they are shoveling it in, are grinning at Grampa. \nRUTHIE (in a snickering whisper to Winfield) Ain't he messy though! \nGRANMA (viciously) I seen him!--gobblin' away like an ole pig! \nGRAMPA Whyn't you keep your eyes shet durin' grace, you ole... \nNOAH is solemnly studying a handbill. Over his shoulder the HANDBILL can be read: \"800 PICKERS WANTED--WORK IN CALIFORNIA\" \nWe see NOAH AND UNCLE JOHN. \nNOAH (who is a half-wit) What's it say again? \nJOHN Says plenty work in California-- peaches. Eight hundred pickers needed. \nNoah frowns at the print. \nGRAMPA (who has mush on his mouth) Wait'll I get to California! Gonna reach up and pick me an orange whenever I want it! Or grapes. That there's somethin' I ain't *never* had enough of! Gonna get me a whole bunch a grapes off a bush and I'm gonna squash 'em all over my face and just let the juice dreen down offen my chin! \nGRANMA (in a feeble bleat) Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory! \nGRAMPA (expanding) Maybe I get me a whole *washtub* fulla them grapes and jest sit in 'em and scrooge around till they was gone! (Sighing) I shore would like to do that! \nRUTHIE AND WINFIELD are snickering. Ruthie has smeared her face with mush. She pulls Winfield around to see. \nRUTHIE (whispering) Look. I'm Grampa! \nShe begins to slobber in mimicry. Winfield snickers. At that instant Ma enters, unobserved, and without a word give Ruthie a fine wallop. Nobody else pays any attention to the slap as Ma, a bucket in her hand, moves on toward the door. We see her now in the BACKYARD, first at the door, then moving toward the well. She stops dead still, her eyes gazing outward. \nTOM is looking at the household goods piled around the yard, to be taken to California. Casy is in the background. Then Tom looks up and see Ma (out of the scene). His face softens. He moves toward her. \nMA (softly--her eyes closed) Thank God. Oh thank God. (In sudden terror as he approaches) Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you? \nTOM No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers. \nWith a sigh and a smile, and her eyes full of wonder, she feels his arm. Her fingers touch his cheek, as if she were blind. Swelling with emotion, Tom bites his lip to control himself. \nMA I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again. \nTOM I'd a found you, Ma. \nCASY, with great politeness, turns his back to the scene and keeps well away from it. \nTOM (shaking hands) If this don't beat all! (Chuckling) Well, I see you been busy already! \nROSASHARN (gasping) You do not see either!--not yet! \nAt the whoop of laughter that goes up from all, she turns in a fine simulation of maidenly mortification, and throws herself into Connie's arms, hiding her face against his chest. After a moment of surprise, a slow, happy, fatuous grin begins to broaden his face. He beams, whereupon their delight increases, the men roaring and jeering and slapping their legs, the women making modest efforts to suppress their amusement. \nOMNES Lookut his face! Y'see his face? Lookut Rosasharn! Y'ever see anything like her face when Tom said it? Look around, Rosasharn! Let's see it again! \nAn automobile horn sounds sharply. Their laughter halted as though cut by a knife, they look off. A TOURING CAR has stopped in the road by the house, the engine still running. One man drives, the other talks. \nMAN Hey, Joad! John Joad! \nIn the BACKYARD the people are silent, their faces without expression, as all gaze toward the touring car. \nMAN Ain't forgot, have you? \nJOHN We ain't forgot. \nMAN Comin' through here tomorrow, you know. \nJOHN I know. We be out. We be out by sunup. \nThe touring car's engine is still heard after the men drive off. The Joads watch the car, their heads turning, their eyes following, expressionless. \nThe scene dissolves to the BACKYARD just before dawn. Now and then a rooster crows. A couple of lanterns light the scene as the man load the truck. It is nearly done, the body piled high but flat with boxes, and more tied on running boards. Al has the hood open and is working on the motor. \nNoah, Casy, Uncle John, Connie, Pa, and Tom are at various tasks. They talk as they work. \nTOM (to Pa) How you get all this money? \nPA Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that. \nTOM (dryly) Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they? \nAL (proudly closing the hood) She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride! \nPA Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? (He casts a critical eye over the truck) \nINSIDE THE CABIN, Ma sits on a box in front of the stove. The fire door is open and the light shines out. The room itself has been pretty well stripped, with only trash and discarded things left. In Ma's lap is a pasteboard shoebox and she is going through the meager treasures stored in it, to see what must go and what she can take with her. Her eyes are soft and thoughtful as each item brings a memory, but not sad. Occasionally she smiles faintly. She pulls out a letter, looks at it, starts to throw it into the fire, then puts it back in the box. Her hand pulls out a PICTURE POSTCARD. We see it in Ma's hand. It is a picture of the Statue Of Liberty. Over it: \"Greetings from New York City.\" She turns it over. It is addressed: \"Mrs. Joad RFD 254 Oklahomy Territory.\" In the space for a message: \"Hello honey. Willy Mae.\" \nMA, after a moment of studying it, throws the card into the fire. She lifts the letter again, puts it back. She pulls out a worn NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. We see it in Ma's hand. The headline is: \"JOAD GETS SEVEN YEARS.\" \nMA drops the clipping into the fire. Rummaging around, she pulls out a small CHINA DOG. We see it closely as before. On it is printed: \"Souvenir of Louisiana Purchase Exposition-- St. Louis--1904.\" \nMA studies the dog, smiling, remembering something that it meant in her life. Then she puts in in a pocket in her dress. Next she pulls out some pieces of cheap jewelry; one cuff link, a baby's signet ring, two earrings. She smiles at the ring, then pockets it. The cuff link too. The earrings she holds for a moment longer, then looks around to make sure nobody sees, then holds them to her ears, not looking into any kind of a mirror, just feeling them against the lobes of her ears, as once perhaps she wore them. Her eyes are grave. \nTOM (from the door) How about it, Ma? \nMA I'm ready. \nTom disappears. Ma looks at the earrings, and then at the contents of the box. She lifts out the letter again and looks at it. Then, without drama, she drops it into the fire. She watches it burn. Her eyes are still on the flame as she calls. \nMA Rosasharn honey! Wake up the chillun. We're fixin' to leave. \nThe flame dies down. \nIn the BACKYARD it is grey dawn. There is a thrill of quiet excitement as they all stand around the loaded truck, hats on, putting on coats. The ones missing are Ma, Rosasharn, the children, and Grampa. Pa is in charge. \nPA (as Ma comes out of the cabin) Where's Grampa? Al, go git him. \nGRANMA (trying to climb in the front seat) I'm gonna sit up front! Somebody he'p me! \nTom easily lifts her up the step. The two children come running out of the house, chanting. \nRUTHIE AND WINFIELD Goin' to California! Goin' to California! \nPA You kids climb up first, on top. (all obey as he directs) Al's gonna drive, Ma. You sit up there with him and Granma and we'll swap around later. \nPA (watching) Better give him a good 'un. He's awful bull-headed. \nMa is already pouring coffee into a can as GRAMPA is seen. \nGRAMPA (mumbling defiantly) If Muley can scrabble along, I can do it too. (Suddenly sniffing) I smell spareribs. Somebody been eatin' spareribs? How come I ain't got some? \nMA (from the door) Got some saved for you, Grampa. Got 'em warmin' now. Here's a cuppa coffee. \nGRAMPA (taking the cup) Awright, but get me some a them spareribs, too. Get me a whole mess of 'em. I'm hongry. \nHe drinks the coffee. Pa and Tom watch him. He notices nothing. He takes another dram of the coffee. \nGRAMPA (amiably) I shore do like spareribs. \nHe drinks again. \nThe scene dissolves to the TRUCK. It is just after dawn. Pa, Tom, and Noah are lifting Grampa into the truck. He mumbles angrily, but is unconscious of what is happening. \nPA (fretfully) Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John. \nGRAMPA (mumbling) Ain't a-goin', thas all... \nPA Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck. (Looking around) Ever'body set now? (A chorus of responses) Awright, Al, letta go! \nThe engine rattles and roars shakily. Grinning with excitement, Pa sits down and pats Grampa clumsily. \nPA You be awright, Grampa. \nThe truck starts to move heavily. Casy stands watching it. \nCASY Good-by, an' good luck. \nPA Hey, wait! Hold 'er, Al! (The car stops) Ain't you goin' with us? \nCASY (after a pause) I'd like to. There's somethin' happenin' out there in the wes' an' I'd like to try to learn what it is. If you feel you got the room... \nHe stops politely. Pa looks from one face to the other in the truck--a swift, silent canvass--and though no one speaks or gives any other sign, Pa knows that the vote is yes. \nPA (heartily) Come on, get on, plenty room! \nOMNES Sure, come on, Casy, plenty room! \nQuickly he climbs aboard. The truck rattles into motion again. \nPA (excitedly) Here we go! \nTOM (grinning) California, here we come! \nAs they all look back the deserted CABIN is seen from the departing truck. \nNow we see the FAMILY IN THE TRUCK, as it snorts and rattles toward the road--a study of facial expressions as the Joad family look back for the last time at their home. Connie and Rosasharn, whispering, giggling, and slappings, are oblivious of the event. Ruthie and Winfield are trembling with excitement. But Tom's and Pa's smiles have disappeared, and all the men are gazing back thoughtfully and soberly, their minds occupied with the solemnity of this great adventure. \nIn the FRONT SEAT OF THE TRUCK. Al is driving. Granma is already dozing. Ma looks steadily ahead. \nAL (grinning) Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look? \nMA (coldly shaking her head) We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California. \nAL (sobering) That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before. \nMA I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life. \nShe continues to stare straight ahead. The TRUCK is lumbering up onto a paved highway. \nThe scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: Almost filling the screen is the shield marker of the U.S. Highway 66. Superimposed on it is a montage of jalopies, steaming and rattling and piled high with goods and people, as they pull onto the highway, to indicate as much as possible that this departure of the Joad family is but part of a mass movement of jalopies and families. The signs of towns on U.S. Highway 66 flash past-- CHECOTAH, OKLAHOMA CITY, BETHANY. \nThis dissolves to a HIGHWAY. It is late afternoon. The Joad truck pulls of the paved highway and stops. The men leap down quickly from the truck, all but Pa, who lifts Grampa in his arms and then lowers him slowly, gently into Tom's arms. \nGRANMA I tell ya I gotta git out! \nThe cop looks startled, puzzled, but Tom shrugs a disclaimer for responsibility in that quarter. \nTOM (mildly) She's kinda ol'-- \nGRANMA (whimpering) I tell ya-- \nCOP Okay, okay! \nGRANMA (triumphantly) Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory! \nAs Ma helps Granma out the other side, Tom and the cop exchange a glance and snother shrug at the foibles of women and then look studiedly into space. \nThe scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: superimposed on the marker of U.S. Highway 66 an assortment of roadside signs flashes by: Bar-B-Q, Joe's Eats, Dr. Pepper, Gas, Coca Cola, This Highway is Patrolled, End of 25 Mile Zone, Lucky Strikes, Used Cars, Nutburger, Motel, Drive-Inn, Free Water, We Fix Flats, etc. \nA HAND-PAINTED SIGN reads: \"CAMP 50\u00a2.\" It is night. We hear the sound of guitar music. In the CAMP GROUND a small wooden house dominates the scene. There are no facilities; the migrants simply pitch makeshift tents and park their jalopies wherever there is a space. It is after supper and a dozen or more men sit on the steps of the house listening to Connie play a road song on a borrowed guitar. The music softens the tired, drawn faces of the men and drives away some of their shyness. In the dark, outside the circle of light from the gasoline lantern on the porch, some of the women and children sit and enjoy the luxury of this relative gaiety. The proprietor sits tipped back in a straight chair on the porch. \nWe see the JOAD TENT. Behind their truck, a tarpaulin is stretched over a rope from tree to tree. Granma lies asleep on a quilt, stirring fitfully. Ma sits on the ground at her head, fanning her with a piece of cardboard. Rosasharn lies flat on her back, hands clasped under her head, looking up at the stars. The music comes to them pleasantly. \nROSASHARN Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby? \nMA Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy. \nROSASHARN Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside. \nMA Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow. \nROSASHARN But will it--hurt the baby? \nMA They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it. \nROSASHARN You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma? \nMA (thoughtfully) Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n-- (simply) --I'll do it. \nROSASHARN Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think? \nMA (quickly) No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that. (After a pause) That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together. \nAs the music ends we see a GROUP ON THE PORCH STEPS. The men murmur approbation of Connie's playing. \nPA (with quiet pride) Thas my son-in-law. \nFIRST MAN Sings real nice. What state y'all from? \nPA Oklahoma. Had us a farm there, share- croppin'. \nTOM Till the tractors druv us out. \nFIRST MAN We from Arkansas. I had me a store there, kind of general notions store, but when the farms went the store went too. (Sighing) Nice a little as you ever saw. I shore did hate to give it up. \nPA (profoundly) Wal, y'cain't tell. I figure when we git out there an' git work an' maybe git us a piece a growin' lan' near water it might not be so bad at that. \nOTHER MEN Thas right... Payin' good wages, I hear... Ever'body got work out there... Can't be no worse... \nAs they talk, a SECOND MAN, standing on the edge of the group, begins to grin bitterly. He is much more ragged than the others. \nSECOND MAN You folks must have a pot a money. \nThe GROUP turns to look at the Man. \nPA (with dignity) No, we ain't got no money. But they's plenty of us to work, an' we 're all good men. Get good wages out there an' put it all together an' we'll be awright. \nThe Man begins to snigger and then to laugh in a high whinneying giggle which turns into a fit of coughing. All of the men are watching him. \nSECOND MAN Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches? \nThe scene dissolves to a MONTAGE superimposed on the shield marker of U.S. Highway 66 and the Joad truck. Signs flash by: FLAGSTAFF, WATER 5\u00a2 A GAL, WATER 10\u00a2 A GAL, WATER 15\u00a2 A GAL, and finally, NEEDLES, CALIF. \nIn the foreground, their backs turned, the Joads stand on and about their truck looking in a long silence at what can be seen of California from Needles. Their silence is eloquent. The faces of the Joads are blank with dismay, for this is an unattractive sight indeed. \nPA (finally) There she is, folks--the land a milk an' honey--California! \nCONNIE (sullenly) Well, if *that's* what we come out here for... \nThey look at each other in disappointment. \nROSASHARN (timidly, to Connie) Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty. \nTOM (rallying them) Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off. \nPA Course not. Come on, let's get goin'. She don't look so tough to me! \nThe Joads and the landscape are seen again. Then the scene dissolves to the BANK OF A RIVER. The camp at Needles is on the bank of the Colorado River, among some willows. We see the man of the family sitting chest-deep in the shallow waters, talking, occasionally ducking their heads under, reveling in this relief. In the background are the towering mountains. \nTOM Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out. \nPA (to Al) How's Granma since we got her in the tent? \nAL She's off her chump, seems to me. \nNOAH She's outa her senses, awright. All night on the truck keep talkin' like she was talkin' to Grampa. \nTOM She's jus' wore out, that's all. \nPA (worriedly) I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in. \nNOAH (lazily, after a silence) Like to jus' stay here myself. Like to lay here forever. Never get hungry an' never get sad. Lay in the water all life long, lazy as a brood sow in the mud. \nTOM (looking up at the mountains) Never seen such tough mountains. This here's a murder country, just the *bones* of a country. (Thoughtfully) Wonder if we'll ever get in a place where folks can live 'thout fightin' hard scrabble an' rock. Sometimes you get to thinkin' they *ain't* no such country. \nThey look up as a man and his grown son stand on the bank. \nMAN How's the swimmin'? \nTOM Dunno. We ain't tried none. Sure feels good to set here, though. \nMAN Mind if we come in an' set? \nTOM She ain't our river. But we'll len' you a little piece of her. \nThey start to shuck off their clothes. THE MAN, excluding those undressing, form another scene. \nPA Goin' west? \nMAN'S VOICE Nope. We come from there. Goin' back home. \nTOM Where's home? \nMAN'S VOICE Panhandle, come from near Pampa. \nPA (in surprise) Can you make a livin' there? \nMAN'S VOICE Nope. \nThe man and his son sit down in the water. \nMAN (continuing) But at leas' we can starve to death with folks we know. \nThere is a long silence among the Joads as the man and his son splash water over their heads. \nPA (slowly) Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that. \nTOM Me an' you both. \nRUTHIE AND WINFIELD huddle together in THE TRUCK, eyes wide with excitement. \nRUTHIE This here's the desert an' we're right in it! \nWINFIELD (trying to see) I wisht it was day. \nRUTHIE Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you. (Trying to see too) I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place. \nWINFIELD Man bones? \nRUTHIE Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones. \nMA AND GRANDMA are seen again. The old woman lies still, breathing noisily. Ma continues to pat her. \nMA (whispering) 'S awright, honey. Everything's gonna be awright. \nThen we see the TRUCK still churning along Highway 66 by night. CASY is asleep in the truck, his face wet with sweat. CONNIE AND ROSASHARN are huddled together, damp and weary. \nROSASHARN Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd. \nCONNIE (sullenly) Women is always tar'd. \nROSASHARN (fearfully) You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey? \nCONNIE (slowly) No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work. \nROSASHARN (pleadingly) But we can still do it, honey. \nCONNIE (sullenly) I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this. \nHer eyes widen with fright as he avoids meeting her glance. \nMA AND GRANDMA lie side by side. Ma's hand is on Grandma's heart. The old woman's eyes are shut and her breathing is almost imperceptible. \nMA (whispering) We can't give up, honey. The family's got to get acrost. You know that. \nJOHN'S VOICE Ever'thing all right? \nMa does not answer immediately. Her head lifted, she is staring at Granma's face. Then slowly she withdraws her hand from Grandma's heart. \nMA (slowly) Yes, ever'thing's all right. I--I guess I dropped off to sleep. \nHer head rests again. She lies looking fixedly at the still face. \nThe scene dissolves to an INSPECTION STATION, near Daggett, California, at night. Obeying a sign that reads: \"KEEP RIGHT AND STOP,\" the Joad truck pulls up under a long shed as two officers, yawning, come out to inspect it. One takes down the license number and opens the hood. The people aboard the truck bestir themselves sleepily. \nTOM What's this here? \nOFFICER Agricultural inspection. We got to go over your stuff. Got any vegetables or seed? \nTOM No. \nOFFICER Well, we got to look over your stuff. You got to unload. \nMA gets down off the truck, her face swollen, her eyes hard. There is an undercurrent of hysteria in her voice and manner. \nMA Look, mister. We got a sick ol' lady. We got to get her to a doctor. We can't wait. (Almost hysterically) You can't make us wait! \nOFFICER Yeah? Well, we got to look you over. \nMA I swear we ain't got anything. I swear it. An' Granma's awful sick. (Pulling him to the truck) Look! \nThe officer lights his flashlight on Granma's face. \nOFFICER (shocked) You wasn't foolin'! You swear you got no fruit or vegetables? \nMA No, I swear it. \nTOM Sallisaw. \nPOLICEMAN I come out from Cherokee County--two years ago. \nROSASHARN (pleased) Why, Connie's folks from Cherokee County-- \nPOLICEMAN (stopping her wearily) Okay, ma'am, let's don't go into it. I already met about a hundred firs' cousins an' it mus' be five hundred secon'. But this is what I got to tell you, don't try to park in town tonight. Keep on out to that camp. If we catch you in town after dark we got to lock you up. Don't forget. \nPA (worriedly) But what we gonna *do*? \nPOLICEMAN (about to leave) Pop, that just ain't up to me. (Grimly he points to the handbill) But I don't min' tellin' you, the guy they *ought* to lock up is the guy that sent out *them* things. \nHe strolls away, the Joads looking concernedly after him, just as the gas station attendant comes briskly to them after disposing of the other car. \nATTENDANT (brightly) How many, folks? \nAL (after a pause) One. \nThe attendant regards him in disgust. \nThe scene dissolves to HOOVERVILLE, by day. A large migrant camp, a typical shanty town of ragged tents and tarpaper shacks, jalopies and dirty children. A dozen or more children pause to watch as the Joad truck lumbers down a dirt incline from the road and stops at the edge of the camp in front of one of the most miserable of the shacks. The Joads regard the camp with dismay. \nTOM (shaking his head) She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else? \nMA On a gallon a gas? (As Tom grins at her) Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew. \nThe truck moves into the camp through a lane of children. \nThe scene dissolves to the JOAD TENT. In front of it, Ma is on her knees feeding a small fire with broken sticks. On the fire is a pot of stew. Ruthie and Winfield stand watching the pot. About fifteen ragged, barefooted children in a half- circle are now around the fire, their solemn eyes on the pot of stew. Occasionally they look at Ma, then back at the stew. Presently one of the older girls speaks. \nGIRL (shyly) I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am. \nMA (gently) You want to get ast to eat, hunh? \nGIRL (simply) Yes, ma'am. \nMA Didn' you have no breakfast? \nGIRL No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along. \nMA Didn' none of these have no breakfast? \nThere is a long silence. Then: \nBOY (boastfully) I did. Me an' my brother did. We et good. \nMA Then you ain't hungry, are you? \nThe boy chokes, his lip sticks out. \nBOY (doggedly) We et good. (Then he breaks and runs) \nMA Well, it's a good thing *some* a you ain't hungry, because they ain't enough to go all the way roun'. \nGIRL Aw, he was braggin'. Know what he done? Las' night, come out an' say they got chicken to eat. Well, sir, I looked in whilst they was a-eatin' an' it was fried dough jus' like ever'body else. \nPa and John enter. \nPA How 'bout it? \nMA (to Ruthie) Go get Tom an' Al. (looking helplessly at the children) I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here? \nShe is dishing the stew into tin plates. The children's eyes follow the spoon, and then the first plate, to John. He is raising the first spoonful to his mouth when he notices them apparently for the first time. He is chewing slowly, his eyes on the children, their eyes on his face, when Tom and Al enter. \nJOHN (standing up) You take this. (Handing plate to Tom) I ain't hungry. \nTOM Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today. \nDEPUTY Hmmm. (Giving Floyd a looking over) Seems like I have. Seems like I seen him hangin' around that used car lot that was busted into. Yep, I'd swear it's the same fella. (Sharply) Get in that car. \nTOM You got nothin' on him. \nDEPUTY Open your trap again and you'll go too. \nAGENT (to the men) You fellas don't wanta lissen to troublemakers. You better pack up an' come on to Tulare County. \nThe men say nothing. \nDEPUTY Might be a good idea to do what he says. Too many of you Okies aroun' here already. Folks beginnin' to figger it ain't maybe *safe*. Might start a epidemic or sump'n. (After a pause) Wouldn't like a bunch a guys down here with pick handles tonight, would you? \nAs the agent gets into the coupe FLOYD'S thumbs hook over his belt and he looks off, away. TOM'S look away is an answer. His thumbs also hook over his belt. \nDEPUTY (to Floyd) Now, you. \nHe takes hold of Floyd's left arm. At the same time Floyd swings, smacks him in the face. As the deputy staggers, Tom sticks out a foot and trips him. Floyd is already running through the camp. The deputy fires from the ground. There is a scream. A WOMAN is looking down at her hand, the knuckles shot away. \nThe COUPE is seen as the agent steps on the gas to get away. As Floyd gets in the clear, the DEPUTY, sitting on the ground, aims his pistol again, slowly, carefully. Behind him Casy steps up, gauges his distance, and then kicks him square in the base of the skull. The deputy tumbles over unconscious. Tom picks up the pistol. \nCASY Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait. \nTOM (angrily) I ain't gonna run. \nCASY He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole? \nTOM You're right! \nCASY Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles. \nAs Tom strides away there is the distant sound of a siren. Casy empties the gun and throws cartridges and gun aside. The men, aghast, have been standing back, worried and excited and apprehensive. They wish nothing like this had happened. The women have gathered around the wounded woman, who is sobbing. Now at the sound of the siren everybody begins to move uncomfortably toward his tent or shack. Al looks admiringly from Casy to the unconscious deputy. \nEverybody has disappeared into his tent but Al and Casy. The siren draws nearer. \nCASY Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'. \nAL How 'bout you? \nCASY (grinning) *Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know. (Shrugging) An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around. \nAL But ain't no reason-- \nCASY (savagely) Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary. \nAL Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though. \nCASY Sure. Why not? \nAl heads for the Joad tent and Casy kneels down and lifts the deputy. He wipes his face clean. The deputy begins to come to. An open car curves off the highway, stops in the clearing, and four men with rifles pile out. The deputy sits rubbing his eyes and Casy stands. \nSECOND DEPUTY What's goin' on here? \nCASY This man a yours, he got tough an' I hit him. Then he started shootin'-- hit a woman down the line--so I hit him again. \nSECOND DEPUTY Well--what'd you do in the first place? \nCASY I talked back. \nTwo of the men have helped the deputy to his feet. He feels the back of his neck gingerly. \nCASY They's a woman down there like to bleed to death from his bad shootin'. \nSECOND DEPUTY (to assistant) Take a look at her. (To deputy) Mike, is this the fella that hit you? \nDEPUTY (dazedly) Don't look like him. \nCASY It was me, all right. You just got smart with the wrong fella. \nMA, PA, AND AL (together) Al's tryin' to go away... She jus' got sassy... All I aimed to do... \nTOM (taking the jack-handle) Awright, you can fight it out later. Right now we got to hustle. Where's Connie? \nThere is a silence that stops Tom in his rush of preparation. \nMA (quietly) Connie's gone. (Indicating Rosasharn) Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this. \nPA (angrily) Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be-- \nMA Pa! Shh! \nPA How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he? \nTOM (looking to Rosasharn) Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck. (He kneels beside Rosasharn. Gently) Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright. \nROSASHARN (uncovering her face) Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live. \nTOM Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. (He pats her awkwardly) \nThe scene dissolves to HOOVERVILLE, at night. The jalopies are lumbering up on the road, one after the other, as the migrants scatter before the threatened invasion. \nIN THE JOAD TRUCK, Tom is helping Rosasharn into the front seat, beside Ma. The others are aboard except Al. Tom hands Al a wrench. \nTOM Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it. \nPA (from truck) I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'. \nTOM (to Al) Give 'im a fryin' pan. (He gets into the driver's seat and starts the truck) \nIn the FRONT SEAT of the truck, Tom drives, Ma sits in the middle, Rosasharn on the other side. \nROSASHARN (hopefully) Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us. \nMA Maybe that's jus' what he done. \nTOM Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad. \nMA Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me. \nTOM I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency. \nMA You promised, Tommy. \nTOM I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am. \nMA You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear. \nTOM What's that--detour? \nAs he slows down the truck, we see that half of the ROAD is blocked with boards and red lanterns. a group of men swarm around the Joad truck as it stops. A leader leans in Tom's window. \nLEADER Where you think you're goin'? \nIn the FRONT SEAT of the truck Tom's hand reaches for the jack-handle on the seat at his side but Ma's hand clutches his arm in a steel grip. \nTOM Well-- (then in a servile whine) --we're strangers here. We heard about they's work in a place called Tulare. \nLEADER Well, you're goin' the wrong way, an' what's more, we don't want no more Okies in this town. We ain't got work enough for them that are already here. \nTom's arm trembles as he tries to pull it away, but Ma holds on tight. \nTOM Which way is it at, mister? \nLEADER You turn right aroun' and head north. An' don't come back till the cotton's ready. \nTOM Yes, sir. \nAT THE GATES the heckling from the bystanders is spasmodic, not continuous, as the six jalopies in line pass through the gate into the Hooper ranch. Two men stand beside the gates with shotguns. They keep calling. \nMEN Go on, go on! Keep movin'! \nThe Joad truck passes through the gates. IN THE HOOPER RANCH the six jalopies are halted at the end of a camp street. The houses are small, square blocks, set in line. One, a little larger, is a grocery store. Casually about are men in pairs with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands. Two bookkeepers are already passing down the cars and jotting down information. \nBOOKKEEPER Want to work? \nTOM Sure, but what is this? \nBOOKKEEPER That's not your affair. Name. \nTOM Joad. \nBOOKKEEPER How many men? \nTOM Four. \nBOOKKEEPER Women? \nTOM Two. \nBOOKKEEPER Kids? \nTOM Two. \nBOOKKEEPER Can all of you work? \nTOM Why, I guess so. \nBOOKKEEPER Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away. \nHe moves to the next car. The Joad truck starts... \nAT HOUSE 63, as the Joad truck pulls up, two deputies approach. They look closely into each face as the Joads pile out. One of the deputies has a long list in his hand. \nFIRST DEPUTY Name. \nTOM (impatiently) Joad. Say, what is this here? \nSECOND DEPUTY (consulting list) Not here. Take a look at his license. \nFIRST DEPUTY 542-567 Oklahoma. \nSECOND DEPUTY Ain't got it. Guess they're okay. (To Tom) Now you look here. We don't want no trouble with you. Jes' do your work and mind your own business and you'll be all right. (The deputies walk away) \nTOM They sure do want to make us feel at home all right. \nMa and Rosasharn step inside the house. It is filthy. A rusty tin stove resting on four bricks is all the one room contains. Ma and Rosasharn stand looking around at it. Finally: \nROSASHARN We gonna live here? \nMA (after a moment) Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out. \nROSASHARN I like the tent better. \nMA This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains. \nOUTSIDE, a clerk with glasses appears, pushing a cart loaded with three-gallon buckets. \nCLERK Name? \nTOM (patiently) It's still Joad. \nCLERK (doling out the buckets) How many? \nMA (at the door) Six. (To Tom) All y'all go. Me an' Rosasharn'll unload. \nCASY What's the matter? \nTOM Casy! What you doin' here? \nCASY Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy? \nTOM Thought you was in jail. \nCASY No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in. (He pulls Tom into the tent.) \nINSIDE THE TENT, three other men sit on the ground as Casy brings Tom in. One's name is Frank. \nFRANK This the fella you been talkin' about? \nCASY This is him. What you doin' here, Tommy? \nTOM Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about? \nFRANK This here's a strike. \nTOM (puzzled) Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat. \nFRANK Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents? \nTOM Sure. We made a buck since midday. \nCASY (after a long silence) Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids... (After a pause) So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five? \nTOM I dunno. Payin' five now. \nCASY (soberly) I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight? \nTOM I aim to. \nCASY (earnestly) Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out. \nFRANK (suddenly) You hear sump'n? \nThey listen. Then: \nTOM I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today. \nCASY Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five! \nTOM They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else. \nCASY But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five! \nFRANK (bitterly) An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum. \nTOM Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business. \nCASY (reluctantly) I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know. \nTOM We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate? \nCASY (sadly) Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*. (Shaking his head) I don't. I got to *ask*. \nJOE (sticking his head in tent) I don't like it. \nCASY What's the matter? \nJOE Can't tell. Seems like I hear sump'n, an' then I listen an' they ain't nothin' to hear. \nFRANK (rising) 'Tain't outa the question, y'know. (He exits) \nCASY All of us a little itchy. Cops been tellin' us how they gonna beat us up an' run us outa the country. Not them reg'lar deppities, but them tin- star fellas they got for guards. (After a pause) They figger I'm the leader because I talk so much. \nROSASHARN No'm. \nMA Stand by the door. \nRosasharn takes her post at the door as Ma kneels on the floor beside Tom, puts down the rag bundle, and gets a basin. Tom, who is under a quilt, is with his back alone visible. She speaks softly, guardedly, as she bathes his face. \nMA How's it feel, Tommy? \nTOM Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear? \nMA Looks like you done it. \nTOM (soberly) I kinda thought so. Felt like it. \nMA Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella. \nTOM They killed Casy first. \nMA That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust. \nTOM (after a pause) They know what--this fella looks like? \nMA They know he got hit in the face. \nTOM (slowly) I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it. \nMA It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you. \nTOM I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks. \nMA (angrily) Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us. (Thoughtfully) They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn-- (a glance at the girl) --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me. \nTOM (tiredly) Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay. \nROSASHARN Here come a lot of people. \nTom puts his head under the quilt. Ma turns, faces the door, her body protectively between Tom and whatever threatens. \nBOOKKEEPER'S VOICE How many of you? \nMIGRANT'S VOICE Ten of us. Whatcha payin'? \nOUTSIDE HOUSE 63, the bookkeeper has encountered the newcomers. \nBOOKKEEPER House 25. Number's on the door. \nMIGRANT Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'? \nBOOKKEEPER Two and a half cents. \nMIGRANT (angrily) Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that. \nBOOKKEEPER Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it. \nMIGRANT But--but how we gonna eat? \nBOOKKEEPER Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it. \nMIGRANT (sullenly) Which way is House 25? \nTOM (slowly) That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too. \nMA Comes night we'll get outa here. \nAt night, the TRUCK is backed up to the door of House 63; it is already loaded. Ma is speaking in a low voice to Tom, who is peering out from under a mattress in the truck. \nMA It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out. \nTOM She's hotter'n a heifer. \nAL Fan-belt's shot. \nHe pulls out the pieces. Tom gets out and takes off the radiator cap. There is a geyser of steam. In the back of the truck the others stand looking on, sleepy-eyed. \nTOM (looking around) Picks a nice place for it, too, don't she? \nThey all look around. At first they find nothing in sight. Al and Tom look at each other in disgust. \nTOM Any gas? \nAL Gallon or two? \nTOM (whistling) Well, looks like we done it this time awright! \nROSASHARN (standing in truck) Tommy. (Pointing) Some smoke up there. \nAll look. Tom climbs on the running board the better to see. \nTOM Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it? \nAL She got to make it. \nMA (as they get back in) What is it? \nTOM Don't know--but it's better'n this. \nAs Al starts the truck, the scene dissolves to a weather- beaten wooden sign: \"PERMANENT CAMP NO. 9\"  \"DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE\" \nWe see the GATE TO THE GOVERNMENT CAMP, a wide gate in a high wire fence, with a caretaker's shack to one side of the gate. The caretaker stands beside his shack as the Joad truck swings off the road, hits an unnoticed rut that bounces the whole truck off the ground, and stops. \nCARETAKER (mildly) You hit 'er too fast. \nIn the FRONT SEAT Al leans angrily out of the driver's window. Tom is keeping his face away from the caretaker's line of vision. \nAL What's the idea of that? \nCARETAKER (chuckling) Well, a lot a kids play in here. You tell folks to go slow and they liable to forget. But let 'em hit that hump once and they don't forget! \nAl starts climbing out. Pa jumps down from the truck. \nAL Got any room here for us? \nCARETAKER (nodding) You're lucky. Fellow just moved out half-hour ago. (Pointing) Down that line and turn to the left. You'll see it. You'll be in No. 4 Sanitary Unit. \nMA What's that? \nCARETAKER Toilet and showers and washtubs. \nMA You mean you got *washtubs?* An' runnin' water? \nCARETAKER Yes, ma'am. (To Al) Camp committee'll call on you in the morning and get you fixed. \nAL (quickly) Cops? \nCARETAKER No. No cops. Folks here elect their own cops. (To Ma) The ladies' committee'll call on you, ma'am, about the kids and the sanitary unit and who takes care of 'em. (To Al) Come inside and sign up. \nAs Ma, Pa, and Al look at each other in almost incredulous bewilderment, Tom climbs out of the truck. \nTOM Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign. \nPA We gonna stay, ain't we? \nTOM You're tootin' we're gonna stay. (He follows the caretaker into the shack) \nINSIDE THE SHACK, Tom enters warily, alert for any indication that either his name or his scar may have been learned and telegraphed here. But the caretaker obviously attaches no significance to either. The shack is bare but for a cot, a table, a chair, and an electric light. The caretaker is seated at the table, pen in hand, a soiled ledger open, when Tom enters. \nROSASHARN An' you won't let nobody touch me? \nMA No--an' look what I got for you. \nSmiling mysteriously, Ma fishes in a pocket in her dress and brings out the envelope of her treasures. From it she produces the earrings and holds them up in front of Rosasharn's wide eyes. \nMA (softly) I used to wear these--when your pa come callin' on me. (Then as she puts them on Rosasharn's ears) You'll look pretty in 'em tonight. \nThey smile at each other, proud in the luxury of ornaments. \nDown the road from the GATE a touring car with six men pulls of the pavement and stops. Three men get out. They are bareheaded and dressed similar to the other migrants. They stroll down the highway toward the gate. The other men, deputies, sit watching them. \nWITHIN THE GATE: \nWILKIE They tell me you're half Injun. You look all Injun to me. \nJULE No, jes' half. Wisht I was full- blooded. Gov'ment'd be lookin' out for me an' I'd be ridin' around in a Buick eight. \nThe three men from the touring car are at the gate. Wilkie and Jule watch them. \nCOMMITTEE MAN Who give you the invitation? \nMAN Fella named Jackson--Buck Jackson. \nCOMMITTEE MAN Okay. Come on in. \nThe three men stroll past Wilkie and Jule, whose eyes follow them. \nJULE Them's our fellas. \nWILKIE How you know? \nJULE Jes' got a feelin'. They're kinda scared too. Follow 'em an' get a holt of Jackson. See if he knows 'em. I'll stay here. \nWilkie moves after them. \nWe see the DANCE FLOOR. The musicians are at it and the fiddler is calling turns. \nFIDDLER Swing your ladies an' a dol ce do. Join han's roun' an' away we go! Swing to the right an' a swing to the lef'. Break, now break--back to back! \nWell in front, among the older folks and children who surround the floor, are Ma and Rosasharn, clinging close. A young man stops in front of them. \nMA (quietly) Thank you kin'ly but she ain't well. \nAs Rosasharn's eyes drop. Ma bends toward her, a shy smile on her face. \nMA Maybe you wouldn't think it, but your pa was as nice a dancer as I ever seen, when he was young. (With a little sigh) Kinda makes me think a ol' times. \nThe three men stroll into sight and stand watching the dancing. One glances at Ma and Rosasharn but does not speak. Ma has smiled back at him. \nWILKIE AND JACKSON are seen; removed somewhat from the dance floor they are peering in the direction of the three men. \nJACKSON I seen 'em before. Worked at Gregorio's with 'em. But I never ast 'em. \nWILKIE Awright. Keep your eye on 'em. Jus' keep 'em in sight, that's all. (He moves quickly away) \nWe find ourselves INSIDE TIM WALLACE'S TENT.  The five members of the central committee, Tim Wallace, chairman, look grave as a 15-year-old boy reports. \nBOY I seen 'em, Mr. Wallace. A car with six men parked down by the euc'lyptus tree an' one with three men on the main road. They got guns, too. I seen 'em. \nTIM Thank you, Willie. You done good. (As Willie exits) Well, it looks like the fat's in the far this time. \nFIRST MAN (angrily) What them deppities want to hurt the camp for? How come they can't leave us be? \nSECOND MAN What we oughta do, we oughta git us some pickhandles an'-- \nTIM (quickly) No!  That's what they want. No sir. If they can git a fight goin', then they can run in the cops an' say we ain't orderly-- (He stops as Wilkie enters followed by Tom) \nAL (angrily) You an' who else? \nBehind the three men a solid wall of migrants are closing in quietly, Tom and Wilkie in the middle. \nLEADER Don't gimme no argament-- (A shrill whistle sounds in the distance) --you little-- \nHis fist goes back, his left hand reaches for Al's collar. At the same instant Tom grabs him, Wilkie claps his hand over the leader's mouth, at least fifteen other men have similarly collard the other two invaders, and they are all lifted bodily. There is not a sound as the three men, held in iron grips, are whisked from the dance floor and into the crowd. \nTwo touring cars have stopped in front of the closed GATE and the deputies have drawn guns. \nDRIVER Open up! We hear you got a riot. \nCARETAKER Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you? \nDRIVER Deputy sheriffs. \nCARETAKER Got a warrant? \nDRIVER We don't need a warrant if it's a riot. \nCARETAKER Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot. (Waving toward the dance floor) Look for yourself. \nAs the deputies, puzzled and uncertain, look toward the DANCE FLOOR, we see the music, the dancing, the gaiety continuing as if nothing had happened. \nWITHIN THE JOAD TENT at night, several hours later: the tent is black, Tom strikes a match. From a piece of wood on the ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts and lights it. While he is doing so, he lifts his head suddenly, and listens. \nIn the CAMP STREET we catch sight of legs walking, the ground lighted from a flashlight. Two pairs of the legs wear state policemen's leather leggings. The third pair are the caretaker's. They stop behind a car. The flashlight plays on the license plate. One of the state cops leans down to copy the license number in a booklet. Then they move on. \nTOM has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle, enough to see out by flattening his head on the floor. The LEGS are now seen at the Joad jalopy. The light is on the license plate. The cop leans over and copies the number. They move on. \nTOM, lowering the edge of the tent, sits up. Quietly he pushes aside the piece of carpet that covers him. He is wearing his clothes. We see the policeman's CAR at the caretaker's hut. The two policemen get into the car. \nCARETAKER You got no right to arrest anybody without a warrant, you know. \nFIRST COP We'll have a warrant--just as soon as we check with headquarters. \nThe car drives off, leaving the caretaker looking somberly after it. \nWITHIN THE JOAD TENT, his cap on, fully dressed for travel, Tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle. Rising, he slings it across his shoulder. As he tiptoes toward the door: \nMA Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye, Tommy? \nFor a moment he looks into the darkness in her direction. \nTOM I didn't know, Ma. I didn't know if I ought. \nShe has risen, pulling the quilt around her. He takes her by the hand. \nTOM Come outside. \nThey go out. Tom leads Ma around BEHIND THE TENT, to a SECTION OF WIRE FENCE. There is a bench there. Tom leads Ma to it and sits her down. He sits beside her. \nTOM They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n. \nMA (softly) It had to come, I reckon, soon or later. \nTOM I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya-- (smiling) --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But-- (shaking his head) --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now. \nMA I could hide you, Tommy. \nTOM (touching her hand) I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too. \nMA (touching his face with her fingers) Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do? \nTOM (thoughtfully) You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it. \nMA He was a good man. \n", "test1_input": "THE GRAPES OF WRATH \n\"THE GRAPES OF WRATH\" \nScreenplay \nby \nNunnally Johnson \nBased on the Novel \"The Grapes Of Wrath\" \nBy \nJohn Steinbeck \nAN OKLAHOMA PAVED HIGHWAY in daylight. At some distance, hoofing down the highway, comes Tom Joad. He wears a new stiff suit of clothes, ill-fitting, and a stiff new cap, which he gradually manages to break down into something comfortable. He comes down the left side of the road, the better to watch the cars that pass him. As he approaches, the scene changes to a roadside short-order RESTAURANT on the right side of the road. From it comes the sound of a phonograph playing a 1939 popular song. In front of the eatery is a huge Diesel truck labeled: OKLAHOMA CITY TRANSPORT COMPANY. The driver, a heavy man with army breeches and high- laced boots, comes out of the restaurant, the screen door slamming behind him. He is chewing on a toothpick. A waitress appears at the door, behind the screen. \nWAITRESS When you be back? \nDRIVER Couple a weeks. Don't do nothin' you wouldn't want me to hear about! \nWe see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right side. Getting behind the wheel, he is releasing the handbrake when Tom appears at the driver's seat window. \nTOM How about a lift, mister? \nDRIVER Can't you see that sticker? \nHe indicates a \"No Riders\" sticker on the windshield. \nTOM Sure I see it. But a good guy don't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck. \nAfter a moment of hesitation the driver releases the brake. \nDRIVER Scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend. \nAs Tom scrunches down on the running board the driver throws the truck into gear and it moves. \nThe scene dissolves to the CAB OF THE TRUCK. It is day, and Tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing him, trying to confirm some suspicion--an inspection which Tom ignores at first. \nDRIVER Goin' far? \nTOM (shaking his head) Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out. \nDRIVER Lookin' for a job? \nTOM No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time. \nDRIVER (after a curious glance) Oh! \nCautiously, the driver's eyes drop to Tom's feet. We see TOM'S SHOES. They are prison shoes--new, stiff and bulky. \nCuriosity is in the eyes of the DRIVER as they shoot a swift glance at Tom. TOM is looking straight ahead, with the dead- pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal something. The DRIVER'S eyes take in Tom's hands and the stiff coat. \nDRIVER Been doin' a job? \nTOM Yeah. \nDRIVER I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time. (After a pause) Got a trade? \nTOM (evenly) Why don't you get to it, buddy? \nDRIVER (uneasily) Get to what? \nTOM You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been? \nDRIVER I don't stick my nose in nobody's business. \n", "test1_true": "DRIVER (a little frightened) I stay in my own yard. \nTOM (without emotion) Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else? \nDRIVER You ain't got to get sore. \nTOM (coldly) Go ahead. Ask me anything you want. \nDRIVER I didn't mean nothing. \nTOM Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all. (After a pause) See that road up ahead? \nDRIVER Yeah. \nTOM That's where I get off. \nWith a sigh of relief the driver puts his foot on the brake. The TRUCK stops and Tom gets out. He look at the uneasy driver contemptuously. \nTOM You're about to bust to know what I done, ain't you?  Well, I ain't a guy to let you down. (Confidentially) Homicide! \nThe driver throws the truck into gear. He doesn't like this at all. \nDRIVER I never asked you! \nTOM (as the truck moves away) Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you. \nHe looks indifferently after the truck and then starts on foot down the dirt crossroad. A wind has begun to blow. \nThe scene dissolves to the roadside under a WILLOW TREE in daylight. The wind is still blowing. Sitting on the ground, his back against the tree, Casy, a long, lean man in overalls, blue shirt, and one sneaker, is fixing something on the other dirty sneaker. To the tune of \"Yes, Sir, That's My Baby\" he is absent-mindedly singing. \nCASY Mmmmm he's my saviour. Mmmmm my saviour, Mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now. (Looking up as Tom comes down the road) Howdy, friend. \nCarrying his coat under his arm, TOM wipes his face with his cap as he cuts off the road to acknowledge the greeting. \nTOM Howdy. \nHe stops, grateful for the momentary relief of the shade. \nCASY Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy? \nTOM (surprised) Yeah. On my way home now. \nCASY Well, I do declare! (Grinning) I baptized you, son. \nTOM (staring) Why, you're the preacher! \nCASY *Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call. (Reminiscently) But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em! (Sighing) But not no more. I lost the sperit. \nTOM (with a grin) Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher. \nCASY I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things. \nTOM Maybe you should a got yourself a wife. \nCASY (shakes his head sadly) At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me. \nTOM I never let one go by me when I could catch her. \nCASY But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls. (Fervently) I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say. \nTOM (after a moment, figuring there is no percentage in continuing this philosophical discussion, pulls out a flask, which he extends) Have a little snort? \nCASY (holding the flask) Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food-- (shaking his head) --but my heart ain't in it. (He takes a long pull) Nice drinkin' liquor. \nTOM Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck. \nCASY (handing back the flask) Been out travelin' around? \n", "test1_id": 1107, "test2_input": "BILL Kinda pie y'got? \nMAE Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple. \nBILL Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java. \nFRED Make it two. \nMAE Two it is.

Beside him Ruthie and Winfield have their noses flattened against the screen. Mae looks at Pa. \nMAE Yeah? \nPA Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am. \nMAE This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with. \nPA I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry. \nMAE Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges. \nPA (embarrassed) I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it.

We only got fifteen-cent loafs. \nBERT (an angry whisper) Give 'em the bread. \nMAE We'll run out 'fore the bread truck comes. \nBERT Awright then, run out! \nMae shrugs at the truck drivers, to indicate what she's up against, while Bert mashes his hamburgers savagely with the spatula. \nMAE Come in. \nPa and the two children come in as Mae opens a drawer and pulls out a long waxpaper-covered loaf of bread. The children have been drawn to the candy showcase and are staring in at the goodies. \nMAE This here's a fifteen-cent loaf. \nPA Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth? \nBERT (a clinched teeth order) Give 'im the loaf! \nPA No, sir, we wanta buy ten cents worth, thas all. \nMAE (sighing) You can have this for ten cents. \nPA I don't wanta rob you, ma'am. \nMAE (with resignation) Go ahead--Bert says take it. \nTaking out his pouch, Pa digs into it, feels around with his fingers for a dime, as he apologizes. \nPA May soun' funny to be so tight, but we got a thousan' miles to go, an' we don't know if we'll make it. \nBut when he puts the dime down on the counter he has a penny with it. He is about to drop this back in the pouch when his eyes fall on the children staring at the candy. Slowly he moves down to see what they are looking at. Then: \nPA Is them penny candy, ma'am? \nThe children look up with a gasp, their big eyes on Mae as she moves down behind the counter. \nMAE Which ones? \nPA There, them stripy ones. \n", "test2_true": "MAE Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny. \nPA Well, give me two then, ma'am. \nHe places the penny carefully on the counter and Mae holds the sticks of candy out to the children. They look up at Pa. \nPA (beaming) Sure, take 'em, take 'em! \nRigid with embarrassment, they accept the candy, looking neither at it nor at each other. Pa picks up the loaf of bread and they scramble for the door. At the door Pa turns back. \nPA Thank you, ma'am. \nThe door slams. Bill turns back from staring after them. \nBILL Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy. \nMAE (belligerently) What's it to you? \nBILL Them was nickel apiece candy. \nFRED We got to get goin'. We're droppin' time. \nBoth reach in their pockets, but when Fred sees what Bill has put down he reaches again and duplicates it. As they go out of the door... \nBILL So long. \nMAE Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'. \nBILL'S VOICE (from outside) What's it to you? \nAs Mae watches them through the window, her eyes warm, Bert walks around the counter to the three slot machines, a paper with figures on it in his hand. The truck roars outside and moves off. Mae looks down again at the coins. \nMAE (softly) Bert. \nBERT (playing a machine) What ya want? \nMAE Look here. \nAs he looks we see the COINS ON THE COUNTER. They are two half-dollars. \nMAE (reverently) Truck drivers. \nThere is a rattle of coins as Bert hits the jackpot. In his left hand on the machine is a paper with three columns of figures on it. The third column is much the longest. He scoops out the money. \nBERT I figgered No. 3 was about ready to pay off. \nThe scene fades out. \nThe ARIZONA BORDER, in daylight, fades in. It is in a gap in the mountains and beyond can be seen the Painted Desert. A border guard halts the Joad truck. He is not as tough as his words indicate, just curt and matter-of-fact. \nGUARD Where you going? \nTOM (who is driving) California. \nGUARD How long you plan to be in Arizona? \nTOM No longer'n we can get acrost her. \nGUARD Got any plants? \nTOM No plants. \nGUARD (putting sticker on windshield) Okay.

It is a cheap toilet and it is a loud flush which eventually ends in a long refilling of the tank just as loudly. There is a paralyzed silence. Then: \nRUTHIE'S VOICE Now you done it! You busted it! \nWINFIELD'S VOICE I never-- \nTerrified, Winfield comes dashing out of the unit but Ruthie grabs him just outside the door.

Then Ruthie begins to walk away with what she fancies is an innocent, nonchalant stroll, yawning casually. Sniffling a little, Winfield mimics her, a very innocent walk and yawn indeed. \nThe scene dissolves to a DITCH. Alongside the ditch are some lengths of concrete pipe. Tom and the two Wallaces are in the ditch, Tom and Tim picking, Wilkie shoveling. \nTOM (exulting) If this don't feel good! \nWILKIE (chuckling) Wait'll about 'leven o'clock, see how good she feels then! \nTOM Seems like a nice frien'ly fella to work for, too. \nTIM Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas.

I belong to the central committee. I got to know. \nTHOMAS Don't you ever tell I told. \nTIM What is it? \nTHOMAS (angrily) Well, the association don't like the government camps. Can't get a deputy in there. Can't arrest a man without a warrant. But if there was a big fight, and maybe shooting--a bunch of deputies could go in and clean out the camp. (Unfolding a newspaper) Like last night. Lissen. \"Citizens, angered at red agitators, burn another squatters' camp, warn agitators to get out of the county.\" \nTOM (sick of the expression) Listen. What *is* these reds? Ever'time you turn aroun' somebody sayin' somebody else's a red. What is these reds, anyway? \nWILKIE (chuckling) Well, I tell you. They was a fella up the country named King--got about 30,000 acres an' a cannery an' a winery--an' he's all a time talkin' about reds. Drivin' the country to ruin, he says. Got to git rid of 'em, he says. Well, they was a young fella jus' come out an' he was listenin one day. He kinda scratched his head an' he says, \"Mr. King, what *is* these reds you all a time talkin' about?\" Well, sir, Mr. King says, \"Young man, a red is any fella that wants thirty cents a hour when I'm payin' twenty-five.\" \nTHOMAS (fretfully) I ain't talkin' about that one way or the other. All I'm saying is that there's going to be a fight in the camp Saturday night. And there's going to be deputies ready to go in. \nTOM But why? Those fellas ain't botherin' nobody. \nTHOMAS I'll tell you why. Those folks in to being treated like humans. Suppose the Government closes its camps. Suppose too many people pass through 'em. Well, when those people go back to the squatters' camps they'll be hard to handle. (Wiping his brow) Go on back to work now.

(Grimly) An' they ain't gonna be no fight, either. \nThey shake hands. \nThe scene dissolves to the GATE TO THE CAMP, at night. It is Saturday evening, the night of the dance. Glaring electric lights hang over the open gate. Parked jalopies line the highway as the invited guests, small farmers and migrants from other camps and their families, arrive to be greeted and checked by a committee of three men. \nCOMMITTEE MAN Ev'nin', ma'am. Who'd you say invited you? \nGUESTS Mister an' Mizz Clark, they ast us. \nCOMMITTEE MAN Yes, ma'am. Come right in, ma'am. \nThere is an air of eager anticipation, of gay celebration, and everyone is in his or her best--the men in clean washed overalls, clean shirts, some with ties, their hair damp and slicked down, the women in their nicest. Through the gate, inside the camp, can be seen the outdoor dance floor, brightly lighted, with the camp musicians already tuning up, and around the dance floor scores of wide-eyed children. \nINSIDE THE GATE TO THE CAMP, we see Wilkie and a dark- complexioned man named Jule standing among a group inside watching the arrivals. They watch sharply, eyeing everyone, listening to every credential. As his employer, Thomas, comes through the gate with his wife, Wilkie grins and greets him with a handshake. \nWILKIE Hidy, Mr. Thomas. Hidy, Mizz Thomas. \nTHOMAS (sotto voce) You watching out, ain't you? \nWILKIE (grinning) Don't you worry. Ain't gonna be no trouble. \nTHOMAS I hope you know what you're talking about. (He moves away, Wilkie grinning after him) \nWe see the DANCE FLOOR, and after three pats of the foot, to get the tempo, the home talent dance orchestra swings into music. \nINSIDE THE JOAD TENT, Rosasharn dressed in her nicest, sits gripping her hands together, the music seeming to bring her to the verge of tears. \nROSASHARN Ma... (Ma turns from drying dishes) Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way. \nMA (trying to cheer her) Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy. \nROSASHARN (miserably) I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy. \nDrying her hands, Ma sits beside Rosasharn and takes her in her arms. \nMA (tenderly) You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly.

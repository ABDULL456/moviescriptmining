RIPCORD Don't yell at me! 
SCARLETT'S VOICE Teine. Ripcord takes a breath, stealing his nerves. A RED FUEL LIGHT starts beeping on his control board. Rip does his best to ignore it, focusing on the missile as it begins to disappear into the lower atmosphere. The light beats faster and louder. 
RIPCORD Teine! The LASER PULSE fires, blasting straight at the missile which is lost in the atmospheric haze below. For a moment, he can't tell if he hit it or not. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
The tracking in the control room provides the answer. 
BREAKER You missed! The warhead has entered the lower atmosphere! 
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY 
Ripcord realizes this as he enters the lower atmosphere himself. The spread of WASHINGTON D.C. Far below him now. 
INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY 
In the operating chamber, the stand-off reaches its boiling point now. McCullen slowly approaching Duke who keeps Ana's pistol on the Doctor, Ana still in Duke's arms. 
MCCULLEN Did you think she loved you? 
DUKE Stay back! 
MCCULLEN Did you imagine your life with her? 
DUKE I said stay back! 
THE DOCTOR Don't you know you've lost, Duke? 
DUKE All I know is that neither of you deserves her. McCullen suddenly lifts the STEEL HOSE in his right hand-- --A BURST OF FLAME tears out at Duke who reflexively fires the PULSE PISTOL at it. The intense air blast from the pulse pistol catches the flames midway between them and blows them back onto McCullen. McCullen SCREAMS as his face is literally burned off. The Doctor freaks and drops the PDA, then yanks McCullen out into the corridor. Duke fires after them, then grabs the PDA, removing Ana's screen with a sigh of relief. 
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVE - SKIES - DAY 
Above Washington, Ripcord guns his aircraft after the falling drone. Getting real close this time. No way he can miss. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
They see this on the screens in the control room. 
BREAKER You're too close, Rip. Back up. 
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY 
Ripcord gets eerily calm all of a sudden. 
RIPCORD Actually, I think I'm just about close enough... 
(PAUSE) .teine. The PULSE LASER fires point blank. The missile EXPLODES right in front of him. Ripcord flies through the flames, the CLOUD OF NANO-MITES latching onto his wings. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
The drone disappears from their screens now. 
SCARLETT Ripcord? What happened? Rip! 
INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY 
Ripcord is now struggling mightily with his controls as the NANO-MITES swiftly eat his plane. His FUEL LIGHT flashes at him alarmingly. He angles the Night Raven upwards, giving it all he's got, NANO-MITES everywhere. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
They see his plane angle back up into the upper atmosphere.

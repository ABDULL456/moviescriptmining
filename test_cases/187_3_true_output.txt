RITA (shaken) You gotta problem?! 
CESAR Yer fuckin' maestro, 'at's my problem! 
RITA I don't know what yer talkin' 'bout! 
CESAR Garfield killed Benny! 
Rita looks at him like he's insane.    Cesar's entourage gathers around them. 
RITA Yer crazy. 
She turns her back and starts to leave.       Cesar grabs her again... 
CESAR Don't turn yer back on me when I'm talkin' t'you, bitch. You think yer better than everybody else. Well you ain't! You ain't nuthin' but a whore! 
RITA Fuck you, asshole! 
CESAR What? You forget about the time in the bungalows? We all had our turn wit you, man! 
RITA Shut up! 
CESAR (gets in her face) What the fuck you been fuckin' a nigger for? Huh? You think he's gonna protec' you? Stop me from doin' whatever I want wit' you? Stop any of us from doin' what we want wit' you?! 
Rita just stands there, destroyed and sobbing now.

RITA Fuck you, Cesar. 
CESAR No, fuck you! 
He grabs her blouse and rips it wide open. His eyes glisten with fervor now as he punches Rita (with his good hand) square in the face. She crumbles to the ground as Victor bursts through the crowd and restrains Cesar. 
As Rita gets to her feet and flees into the Quebradita crowd... 
CESAR Garfield better watch his back!

125   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                        125 
Standing room only.    An impassioned crowd. 
ANGLO WOMAN ... I wanna know if this boy was killed and whether it was gang- related. 
The audience erupts in unanimous support... 
ANGLO WOMAN (playing to crowd now) As a mother and a taxpayer, I have a right to know. And if it was gang-related then I want tighter security... 
At this point she's drowned out by the crowd. 
On stage the discipline committee, including Trevor, Childress, Hyland and Quinn sit at the dais. Garcia stands at the podium, waiting for silence. MRS. FORD, the assistant principal, a full-figured black woman in her mid-fifties, stands alongside him, gesturing for the crowd to settle down. 
MR. GARCIA The death... (too noisy) The death of Benito Chacon is not gang-related. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
125   CONTINUED:                                                       125 
MR. GARCIA (CONT'D) That's something you heard on the news. It's wrong. It's misinformation. 
HISPANIC MAN (shouting out) Who says? How can you be so sure? You're talking about my kid's safety. 
MRS. FORD Please, everyone just calm down. 
Audience settles. 
MR. GARCIA Thank you, Mrs. Ford. (now) ... The police at this point aren't even sure if it's a case of murder. The reason we're having this meeting tonight is to quash all the rumors floating around out there. Okay. Here's what we do know. Benny Chacon ultimately died from a drug overdose, technically it was morphine. (volume rising again) Which is what heroin breaks down into... 
STEVIE (O.S.) ... Dat's bullshit! Benny was no junkie! I know who did it! 
Heads turn... 
... Ellen quietly enters now and stands just inside one of the doors at the back of the hall... 
Up at the dais, Trevor notices her. 
STEVIE It's not the gangbangers y'gotta worry about. It's the teachers! 
MR. GARCIA That's exactly the type of rumor we don't need, Mr. Littleton. 
Stevie deliberately stands and points at Trevor with vitriol in his eyes... 
(CONTINUED) 
125   CONTINUED:                                                           125 
STEVIE ... It was Garfield. 
The audience grows silent. 
MR. GARCIA (losing his patience) Say one more word and you're suspended. 
MRS. FORD ... Sit down, Stevie. 
Trevor doesn't even flinch.       Childress scrutinizes him with a glance.

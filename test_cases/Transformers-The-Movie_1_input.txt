EXT. SPACE - SAME TIME 
The massive Junkion ship and the corkscrew cruiser piloted by Hot Rod and Kup race through the dark void. 
HOT ROD I don't believe it. 
INT.   THE QUINTESSON SHIP - SAME TIME 
Hot Rod, Kup, Springer, Arcee and Daniel as they also look through canopy, astonished 
DANIEL Wow! 
THEIR P.O.V. - UNICRON Destroying CYBERTRON 
HOT ROD (V.O.) Doesn't it remind you of something, Kup? 
RESUME ON KUP, DANIEL AND HOT ROD 
as they MOVE CLOSER STILL. Kup is glassy eyed. 
KUP (entranced) Nope, never seen anything like it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HOT ROD I knew there had to be a first time.... (using intercom) Battle stations! 
LONG SHOT- HOT ROD'S CRUISER AND THE JUNKION SPACE SHIP 
as hatches open and the Dinobots start FLYING OUT. 
INT. - CRUISER 
Hot Rod shoves joystick forward and Cruiser DRIVES TOWARD UNICRON whom we see turn to take a swat at it through glass canopy 
ON JUNKION SPACE SHIP 
as it pulls up beside Hot Rod's Cruiser so they are both in a line.....The Dinobots behind both ships ...all diving toward Unicron's nose 
INT. JUNKION SHIP - WRECK-GAR AT CONTROLS 
As Wreck-Gar also has joystick shoved down and watches Unicron's face loom closer, closer, closer 
LONG SHOT- CRUISER, JUNKION SHIP AND DINOBOTS IN FORMATION 
as Unicron smiles and cups both hands together, preparing to catch the lot of them as soon as they get within reach 
UNICRON'S CHEST Galvatron, the matrix hanging around his neck. Transforms to Cannon and fires up at... ... A bright panel on Unicron's chest... 
BLAAAM! 
He hits the panel and lights and sparks fly out, causing the gigantic robot to flicker momentarily. 
ANGLE ON UNICRON 
The monster lets out a ROAR! Then, reaches down, picks up Galvatron and drops him into his mouth like a raisin. 
ANGLE ON GALVATRON 
He drops into the deep pit of Unicron's mouth, narrowly avoiding both a torrent of fire, and his sharp, crushing teeth. 
EXT. THE SPACE BATTLE - SAME TIME 
As they Junkion cruiser comes close, Unicron lets out a burst of fire... ... Flames lick the ship, but when the fire subsides, nothing has happened. 
WRECK-GAR (V.O.) Patented enamel resists fire, rain and corrosion. Five year warranty, satisfaction guaranteed. 
OTHER JUNKIONS Or your money back! 
The ship fires back, dumping rays into... ... Unicron's face, but not really doing any damage. 
UNICRON AND JUNKION CRUISER 
Unicron grabs the Junkion cruiser with both of it's hands and... 
CLOSER ... tears it in half. 
WRECK-GAR (V.O.) Unshakable, unbreakable, unbeatable. And for a limited time we include... 
INT. CRUSHED JUNKION SHIP 
As Ultra Magnus, Perceptor and the others watch in amazement... 
WRECK-GAR (CONT'D) Free bonus surprise!

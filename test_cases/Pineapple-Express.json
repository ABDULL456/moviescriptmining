{"train": "PINEAPPLE EXPRESS \nWritten by \nJudd Apatow, Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg \nNovember 28, 2006 \nEXT. FARMLAND - DAWN \nIN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland. The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates. Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road and through a massive field of emptiness. \nThe car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field. GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of the car. \nAlthough there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the General scans his surroundings with concern. \nTITLE CARD UP: THE PAST \nAgent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL HATCH in the ground. Both men walk down the hatch and into the earth. \nINT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER \nThey descend a metal staircase and walk with great urgency down a narrow corridor. The hallway spills into a hauntingly huge metal room with a lone SCIENTIST standing in the middle. The Scientist immediately begins leading them across the room. \nGENERAL BRAT When did it start? \nSCIENTIST At 05:00. We're seven minutes in. \nINT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS \nThe three men enter a large room divided by a one-way mirror. \nOn their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject on the other side of the mirror. \nThe subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT. \nHe takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts into a coughing fit. \nThe scientists begin to scribble profusely as their devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone in the corner. \nSCIENTIST (into microphone) Private Miller, we are now going to ask you several questions. How do you feel? \nHis voice booms through large speakers on Miller's side of the room. Miller leans towards the microphone. \nPRIVATE MILLER Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But... It's good. Good queer. (beat) Sir. Good queer, Sir. \nThe scientists scribble madly. One of them mumbles into General Brat's ear. \nPRIVATE MILLER (CONT'D) But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir, I should mention that I'm also feeling quite gay...so, a little queer, but mostly gay. \nSCIENTIST Private Miller. When you think of your superiors, what emotions do you feel? \nPRIVATE MILLER (holding out the joint) This went out...Sir. \nSCIENTIST We will send someone in. Now answer the question. \nA door opens beside Private Miller and an AGENT steps out wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door that he came from. He slowly walks toward the Private, who looks at him in shock. \nSCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S) (through speakers) Private Miller? Answer the question. \nPRIVATE MILLER Oh...um...what was the question again? \nThe Agent in the strange suit reaches the private and holds a lighter up to the joint. \nSCIENTIST (O.S.) (through speakers) What are your emotions towards your superiors? \nMiller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. The Agent exits the room. \nPRIVATE MILLER COUGH   COUGH  Fucking shit. (beat) Well, now that I think of it, it's strange that they are called my `superiors'. Does that make me their `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked up. \nGeneral Brat scowls. \nGENERAL BRAT (curtly to the scientists) I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him. This never happened. \nInstantly, the scientists start packing up their equipment. Staring at Miller, General Brat grabs a RED PHONE and dials. Two Agents in the scuba-like suits emerge from behind Miller and start aggressively dragging him away. \nPRIVATE MILLER (freaking out) Hey! What the...what are you guys doing! Let go of me! (desperately looking at the mirror) Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!! \nGENERAL (into phone) This is General Brat. We've reached a final conclusion on Item 9. (beat) Illegal. \nHe hangs up the phone. \nSaul passes Dale the joint. \nSAUL Yo, so, like, what have these people done that you go after? \nDALE Let's see...tonight I'm going after- \nDale pulls a blue envelope out of his pocket. \nDALE (CONT'D) Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his- \nSAUL Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in town. Maybe it's him! \nDALE I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot of Ted Joneses's out there. \nSAUL Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's what I want to be one day. He's like the \"Jesus of Weed\". So...I guess he's like Jah. Or Scarface. \nSaul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a conversation burnt out with the joint. They sit in awkward silence. Dale gets up. \nDALE Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks. \nSAUL No worries dude, peace. \nThey slap each other five and Dale exits. Saul turns on the TV. Saved By the Bell is on. It makes Saul chuckle. \nINT. DALE'S CAR - NIGHT \nDale cruises down side streets and locates Ted's house. It is a large well-to-do home. Having difficulties, Dale parks in between two cars across the street. He turns off the engine and starts smoking a joint. SUDDENLY - FLASH! Two head lights appear up the street. Holy shit! It's a COP CAR! \nHe sits still, holding the joint between his legs as the cop car drives past and...parks a few cars down! The FEMALE COP walks up the block - TOWARDS DALE'S CAR! \nDALE Oh shit on me. \nFortunately,   the COP crosses the street and walks towards Ted's house.   Confused, Dale watches as she is let in. Dale waits a   moment and then re-lights the joint. He tries to see   into Ted's house as he takes a MASSIVE TOKE. \nBANG! A SILENCE SHATTERING BLAST comes from Ted's house. Dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he focuses on the large front window. SUDDENLY, the drapes are torn down by an ASIAN MAN as he falls forwards and crashes through the front window! \nDale watches in horror as a LARGE GREY-HAIRED MAN and the Female Cop step forward and shoot the Asian man! BLAM! BLAM! Blood splatters! \nDale starts COUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY! He starts the car and, in a panicked fit, tries to pull out. CRASH!!! He smashes directly into the car in front of him! He flicks the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse - CRUNCH!!! He backs into the car behind him! Still hacking his lungs out, Dale drives away! \nThe Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S ROACH! He brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips open the paper and examines the weed closely. \nTED Pineapple Express. \nINT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nSaul is laying on his couch watching Saved By the Bell, laughing so hard that he's crying. \nSAUL Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech. \nSuddenly, the BUZZER sounds repeatedly. \nSAUL (CONT'D) (mumbles) Fucking hell. \nHe grudgingly walks to the intercom and presses talk. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Hello? \nHe presses listen. \nDALE (O.C.) (through intercom) ...me in! Let me in! Let me in!    Let me in! It's Dale! Let m-- \nSaul casually presses the talk button. \nSAUL (annoyingly casual) Denton? Dale Denton? \nHe smiles to himself, then presses listen. \nDALE (O.C.) (through intercom) ...the love of shit, let me in! Pleeea- \nAnnoyed, Saul buzzes him in and unlocks the door. \nSAUL (to himself) ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you can't handle it. \nA moment later, Dale, completely freaking out, BURSTS through the door and SLAMS it shut. \nSAUL (CONT'D) (startled) Dude, whoa. What the fuck are- \nDALE He fucking killed him, man! \nSAUL Be quiet, man, I got neighbors- \nDALE And am I the only guy you gave it to? \nSAUL Yeah. So, we're the only guys. \nDALE But, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if they found a roach of it, right? \nSaul thinks for a moment. \nSAUL I could. Why? \nDALE (panicking) We should go, we shouldn't be here! We should go! \nSAUL No...seriously, why? \nDALE I left a roach of this weed in front of Ted's house! \nSAUL So what? I leave roaches all over fucking town. \nDALE No, listen - they could find the roach and say, \"This is pineapple weed, Saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did - let's go kill him.\" \nFinally, Saul understands. \nSAUL Mother of fuck! \nHe SPRINGS to his feet and BOLTS for the door. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Let's go! \nDale grabs Saul and stops him. \nDALE Wait! \nSAUL Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck out of here! \nDALE Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff. \nSaul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack. They run for the door. \nDALE (CONT'D) Are you sure you're not forgetting anything? \nSAUL Yes! Come on! \nINT. SAUL'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nSaul and Dale run to the elevator and frantically press the button, terrified for their lives. \nSAUL Fuck! I forgot something! \nSaul runs back to his apartment, leaving Dale alone and frightened. Saul BURSTS back out of his apartment holding his cell. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Dude, I was so scared going back, I thought there was gonna be guys there, and then you'd be gone, and there was this music in my head- \nDALE We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster. \nThey scramble towards the distant stairwell. Almost at the door, they hear the DING of the elevator arriving. \nDALE (CONT'D) Go back! Go back! \nThey DASH back to the elevator. Dale shoves his arm between the doors and they hop in. Saul rapidly presses the LOBBY button as the doors shut. They're both on the verge of hyperventilating. \nDALE (CONT'D) Okay, man. We gotta try to relax. \nSAUL Why?!? \nDALE We don't want to draw attention. \nSAUL (freaking out) Whose attention!?! You think they could be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?! \nDALE I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be cool. \nDING  The elevator SUDDENLY STOPS on the second floor. \nDALE (CONT'D)                     SAUL Oh my god!!!                  Ahhh!!! \nThe doors OPEN! There's no one there. The doors close. \nSAUL What the fuck was that? \nDALE That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm! \nThe elevator stops at the lobby and the doors open, they step out, bumping into two rough looking guys. \nPleased, Saul pats Dale on the back. \nDALE You're right. You are. I'm just being paranoid. Sorry, dude. \nSaul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial. We hear someone pick up. \nRED (O.S.) (through phone) Ow! Hello? \nSAUL Yo, Red. You okay man? \nRED (O.S.) Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe. \nRed sounds nervous. \nSAUL Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the house. But Red, I gotta get straight to brass tacs, I need a favor. \nRED (O.S.) Sure man, anything. I'm Red. \nSAUL You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know how you gave me some of that pineapple express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave it to me. \nRED (O.S.) Sure man, no problem. Red swears it, hombre. \nSAUL So, can I come on over now? \nDale waves his hands in front of Saul's face. \nDALE (louldy whispering) No! We should do it tomorrow! \nSAUL (covering phone, talks to Dale) I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's just go and get this shit over with. \nDALE Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared shitless. I want to think things through before I do anything. Let's go in the morning. Please. \nSaul looks around the dark forest. \nSAUL Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in the day. \nDale nods. \nSAUL (CONT'D) (into phone) Red? \nRED (O.S.) (talking to someone else) -I can hear him talking to someone, so- Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the morning? \nSAUL Yeah, right after I see my grandma. \nRED (O.S.) Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow! Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is that the one on Granville and 41st. \nSAUL Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be chillin' by noon. \nSaul gives Dale the thumbs up. \nRED (O.S.) Well, cool brother. Noon it is. \nSAUL We should definitely hit up the casino again sometime. \nRED (O.S.) For sure. We should definitely hit up the casino. \nSaul hangs up the cell. \nSAUL Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the house. \nINT. RED'S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRED, 30, stalky and short, sits between the BUDLOFSKY and MATHESON \nBUDLOFSKY Why isn't he coming now? What did you say? \nRED (incredibly afraid) I didn't say shit, man! There was another guy there and he said tomorrow! \nMATHESON Why did he mention the casino? The Asians run the casinos. Is Saul Asian? \nRED No, man! \nThis worries the thugs. \nMATHESON This might be more than we thought. \nBUDLOFSKY Than you thought. I thought it would be more than you did. I'll call Ted. \nEXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS \nSAUL I always liked smoking weed in the forest. \nSAUL (CONT'D) You ever see that movie where all the people are in the woods and they slowly get killed? \nDALE The \"Blair Witch Project.\" \nSAUL No...Shit. That one's way scarier than the one I was thinking of. Mine had Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm thinking of the fucking Blair Witch. \nThey inch forward, nervous. \nDALE (whispering) Stop! \nThey both freeze. \nSAUL (whispering) What- \nDALE (whispering) Sshh! \nSAUL (whispering) What is- \nDALE (whispering) Sshh! Can you hear that? \nSAUL (whispering) What? \nDALE (whispering) Just listen. \nSaul listens. \nSAUL (whispering) I literally hear nothing. (gasp) Wait... \nSUDDENLY, Saul SPRINTS off into the darkness! \nDALE SAUL!!! \nDale looks in horror as Saul vanishes amongst the trees. \nSAUL(O.S.) (screaming in pain) ARGHHH!!! \nDale hears a loud THUD. \nScared for his life, he SPRINTS in the opposite direction! He weaves in between the trees, avoids some rocks and tree roots, stumbles on some loose dirt, then SLAMS half his body against a tree and FALLS HARD. \nANGLE ON: SAUL \nSaul gets up, covered in dirt. Panting, he looks around the forest and sees no one. He thinks he hears something and SPRINTS off! WHAM! He trips on a tree root and SLAMS into the ground. \nANGLE ON: DALE \nDale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe the dirt off his suit. \nDALE Shit. \nSaul hears Dale and whips around, breaking a twig - CRACK \nDale looks towards the noise, then SPRINTS off. \nSaul hears someone and BOLTS in the opposite direction. \nLike chickens with their heads cut off, they both scramble through the woods trying to evade their imaginary enemies. \nDale spots his car! He jumps in and SLAMS the door shut. He's about to turn the ignition, but stops. Panting and wheezing, he sinks into his seat. \nBAM! Something slams into the car. \nDALE (CONT'D) AAAAAHHHHHHH!!! \nDale sees Saul BANGING against the passenger side door. \nSAUL (muffled through the window) Let me in! Let me in! \nDale unlocks the car and Saul JUMPS in. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Let's go! Go! \nDALE Is there anyone even out there?!? \nSAUL I don't know! \nDALE If you don't know then why the hell did you run like that?!? \nSAUL I don't know! I'm freaking out, man! Let's just go! \nDALE No! We're not going anywhere! \nDALE (CONT'D) (pissed off) I think the battery's dead. \nSAUL Are you fucking serious? \nHe tries again. \nDALE It's dead. \nSAUL It's dead? \nDale shoots Saul an angry look. \nSAUL (CONT'D) What the fuck happened? How did this happen? \nDALE How? We fell asleep! \nSAUL Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put people to sleep. \nFrustrated, Dale tries to gather his thoughts. \nDALE We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's. \nSAUL For real? \nDale opens his door and hops out. \nDALE Yeah, \"for real\". We'll be late, but we'll get there. Then we can fix this insane situation. \nMONTAGE: \n- Dale and Saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road, each smoking their own joint. \n- Saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf. Dale is grossed out. Saul pokes the caterpillar and then blows weed smoke onto it. \nDALE (CONT'D) Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave that thing alone. \n- They emerge at the highway and try to hitch a ride. \n- Dale notices Saul has his thumb sticking out of his zipper. \nSAUL It's like, my thumb is my cock! \nDale doesn't laugh. \n- Bored and tired, they wait.   Saul lights a joint. Dale notices. Saul shifts his body   away from Dale. Just then, an eighteen wheeler slows for   them. Saul snubs out the freshly lit joint and puts it   in his pocket. \nEXT. RED'S HOUSE - LATER \nDale and Saul get out of the eighteen wheeler. \nSAUL (to the driver) Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid. \nSaul shuts the door and he and Dale run towards Red's house - a small, dilapidated place in a rundown part of town. Exhausted, Dale and Saul reach Red's door. Saul knocks. \nDALE So, what's this guy like? \nSAUL I don't know. He's short...and stout. So he's like a tea pot. Hehe. \nDALE Well, do you think he'll be there? \nSAUL I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight hours late. (beat) That's actually pretty late. \nRED (O.S.) (through door) Who is it? \nSAUL Red! It's Saul. Open up. \nRed opens the door. He has a SPLIT LIP and has clearly been CRYING. He tries to act normal. Dale immediately suspects something is up. \nRED (sniffling) Who's this guy? \nDALE Dale. Nice to meet you. \nRed ushers them in and shuts the door. \nRED Dale who? \nDALE I think it's    better if you don't know my last- \nSAUL (oblivious) Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries. \nRed notices their dirty clothes. \nRed PUNCHES Saul in the face! Saul SCREAMS and drops to the ground. \nSAUL (CONT'D) WHY!?!?! \nDale snatches the phone and scurries into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. \nINT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDisoriented, Dale scans the small bathroom. Saul and Red can be heard fighting outside. \nSAUL (O.S.) Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked off that shit again!?! Ow! \nRED (O.S.) I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please don't fight! \nA loud CRASH is heard from the other room. \nSAUL AAAHHHHHH!!! \nDale throws the phone in the toilet bowl and smacks down the seat. He runs back to help Saul. \nINT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nRed is BEATING the shit out of Saul. \nSAUL Why, man!?! Why! \nRED I'M SORRY!!! \nSaul manages to stand up when Red boots him in the BALLS! He SHRIEKS and stumbles backwards. Dale dashes into the room and LEAPS onto Red's back. Red wobbles forward, then starts RUNNING BACKWARDS. He trips on his coffee table and CRASHES Dale through it, landing on top of him. Red gets up, sprints into the bathroom and locks the door. With great effort, Dale and Saul manage to get up. \nDALE He's going for the phone! Bathroom! \nINT. RED'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nFrantically searching for the phone, Red flips the toilet seat up and grabs it. He begins to dial as Dale and Saul sprint down the hall. \nJust as Red is about to finish dialing, Dale and Saul CRASH into the bathroom door! They knock it completely off it's hinges, SLAMMING it directly into Red! The phone flies into the bathtub. \nDALE (pointing at the phone) SAUL!!! Phone!!! \nSaul jumps into the bathtub and begins STOMPING the phone. Dale continuously SLAMS his body against the door in an attempt to keep Red pinned down. \nSAUL What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is going on!?! \nRED I don't know!!! They're going to kill me!!! \nSAUL You didn't stub your toe, did you? \nRed stops struggling and tries to catch his breath. Dale kneels on top of the door, keeping him pinned. \nDALE Now tell us- \nRED They're gonna come back and kill me!!! \nIn an impressive show of strength, Red shoves the door off him, knocking Dale aside. He runs. \nINT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nSaul chases Red and TACKLES him into a wall. Dale follows seconds later, and notices Red's LARGE GLASS BONG. He looks back to see Saul getting pummelled. \nSAUL DALE! HELP! \nDale grabs the bong and swings around - CRASH!!! It shatters on the back of Red's head. \nRed falls to the ground moaning, blood dripping from his head. Dale and Saul stand over him, out of breath, bruised and battered. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Red, you motherfucker. \nDale, lost in thought, starts to seriously freak out. \nDALE It's happening! It's actually happening! He knows my name! Red knows my name! \nSAUL We should beat it out of his sellout brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck the Casino! Go alone! \nDALE This is fucked, what do we do now, he knows my name!?! \nSAUL He knows my name too! \nDALE Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them! \nSAUL We're not gonna have to kill him, are we? I don't think I could do that. \nRED The...the Koreans, I think. Everyone just calls them the Asians. \nDale and Saul exchange an even more worried look. \nSAUL What else? \nRED I swear to god that's all I know...I swear... \nDALE Alright. We should...tie him up and...and get the fuck out of here. \nSAUL I made a gravity bong here once. I know where his duct tape is. \nSaul runs off. Dale puts on Saul's backpack and looks at the battered Red moaning on the floor. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Come on, let's tape this piece of shit up. \nDale pulls Red's hands behind his back. Saul is picking at the tape. \nSAUL (CONT'D) I can't find the edge. \nDALE What? \nSAUL I can't find the, oh...wait... \nSaul rips open the DUCT TAPE. He quickly BINDS Red's hands and feet. SUDDENLY, there's a KNOCK at the door. They stop, silent. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. Red starts thrashing and trying to scream. \nSAUL (CONT'D) (whispering) Shit. They're actually here to kill him. \nDALE (whispering) What do we do? \nSAUL (whispering) I don't know. \nKNOCK! KNOCK! \nDALE (whispering) Fuck. Oh, man. \nFrozen in terror, they don't know what to do. \nRED (whispering) Guys, guys...listen to me- \nKNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! \nRED (CONT'D) (whispering) I'm fuckin' sorry. Okay? I fucked up. I'm a son-of-a-bitch. I forgot bros before hoes, even though these guys aren't hoes. You know what I mean. But I can fix this. (MORE) \nRED (CONT'D) I know these guys, it's cool. Just head out the back, I'll stall `em. Won't tell `em nothing. You can count on me! \nSAUL Thanks, Red. \nRed frantically tries to wriggle out of his bonds while Saul leads Dale out the back door. SUDDENLY, the door is KICKED open! Budlofsky and Matheson enter, guns drawn. They see Red. \nRED Dale Denton! It was Saul and some dude named Dale Denton! They just ran out the back! \nEXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS \nDale and Saul run like hell. Saul spots a dumpster. \nSAUL In here! \nSaul jumps into the dumpster. \nDALE No. I've got to get to a phone! \nSAUL We should hide! \nDALE But, if Red tells Ted's guys my name, then they'll go to my apartment and find out about Angie! \nSAUL I think we should stay! \nDALE Why?! \nSAUL Because I'm in the dumpster already! Shit! Fine! \nSaul hops out of the dumpster and follows Dale. \nINT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nBudlofsky dashes back into the apartment. \nBUDLOFSKY They're long gone. \nMatheson stands over top of Red, talking to Ted on the phone. \nSAUL Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I want to go with you! \nDALE Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally be five minutes. Please. \nSAUL Fine. But hurry. \nDale runs up to the front door and frantically knocks. Angie answers the door. \nINT. ANGIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nDale dashes in. \nDALE Angie! \nAngie opens the door with a smile, the phone in hand. Her attention is towards the phone conversation she is having. Dale enters her apartment. \nINT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nANGIE It's Dale! You came. \nDale freezes in horror: ANGIE'S PARENTS (SHANNON and ROBERT) are pleasantly eating at the dining room table. \nSHANNON Hi, Dale. Nice to meet you, sit down and have some couscous. Can I get you a drink? \nRobert sees that Dale is DIRTY, DISHEVELLED, BRUISED and BATTERED. \nROBERT What the hell happened to you? \nANGIE Dale?   What happened to you? \nRobert and Shannon exchange worried looks. \nDALE Nothing, I was in the woods and... (turns to Angie's parents) ...Hi, I'm Dale. Uh...it's nice to finally meet you both...I apologize for my appearance. Robert, Charlotte- \nSHANNON (not amused) Shannon. \nDALE Yes! Shannon. I've heard a lot about both of you. \nDale walks to Robert and extends his DIRTY, BLOODY HAND. \nDALE (CONT'D) Very nice things. \nRobert smugly declines Dale's hand shake. \nANGIE You were in the woods? \nDALE (at a loss for words) Alright, now, here's what's happened - I've been thrust into a kind of, ah...situation. So, uh, if we could all just start to evacuate... \nDale starts gathering all their jackets and shoes. \nDALE (CONT'D) ...that'd be really, really good right now. I'll answer all your- \nANGIE Is this a joke? \nROBERT What is this Angie? \nSHANNON I think it is a joke. \nDALE (deep breath) Listen. There are people after us and they could come here. I'll tell you anything you want, just please, let's go! \nROBERT He's serious? \nDALE Yes, I'm serious. Super serious! We have to get the \"F\" out of here! \nThe Anderson's stare at him dumbfounded. Robert gets up and stands tall. \nROBERT Get the hell out of my house. \nDALE Okay, Mr. Anderson, look, here's the deal - I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I was working...this morning. The cop shot the guy then saw my car drive off, and I think they might have seen my license plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the woods, so... \nThey stare at Dale as though he were crazy. \nEXT. ANGIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nSaul sees a car nearing. He sees Budlofsky and Matheson are in it. \nSAUL No fucking way. \nHe runs like hell towards Angie's. \nINT. ANGIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nDale looks at the pandemonium as everyone tries to be heard. \nDALE Guys! Please! We have to get out of here. Robert, Angie...Mrs. Anderson- \nSAUL (whispers to Dale) It's Shannon. \nDALE I know! Look, we have to get out of here. I'm sure everything is going to be fine but better safe than...not. \nSHANNON Is this...for real- \nDALE Yes. Terribly real. \nDale and Saul lead Angie and her parents towards the back door. \nEXT. ANGIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nBudlofsky and Matheson are now at the front door. They've each got a gun drawn and are preparing to burst in. Budlofsky is loading his bullet cartridge. \nMATHESON Ready? \nBUDLOFSKY No. One sec. \nBudlofsky puts in the last few bullets. \nMATHESON Hurry the fuck up. \nBUDLOFSKY Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't helping. \nBudlofsky cocks his gun and nods at Matheson. \nINT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nBAM! They kick open the doors and run into her house. No one is there. Budlofsky cautiously walks over to the table and touches the food. It's still warm. Matheson bends down and picks up a bloody fork. \nMATHESON Ew! It's a bloody fork! What are these people doing? \nINT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nDale, Angie, her parents, and Saul burst into the garage. Robert is fumbling with the keys. He manages to open the car. Saul pulls up his shirt to look at the stab wound. \nSAUL Fuck. Look at that. Fuckin' mashed potatoes in my wound. \nROBERT Baby! Get in the car quick. Angie, in the car! \nThe Andersons get in the car. \nANGIE Dale - get in the car! \nROBERT (to Dale) You stay the fuck away from my family! \nANGIE Shut up dad! \nDALE (glances at Robert) I...I think it would be best if I didn't go with you. I don't want to put you in any more danger. \nANGIE What are you going to do? What should we do? \nROBERT Angie, get in the car! \nDALE Alright, baby. Here's the plan - go to the Holiday Inn downtown and use a fake name. Something like... (looks around, focuses on Robert's car) Car...lyle. \nANGIE Carlyle? (beat) I...I have so many questions. I just...how can this be happening? Where...where are you going? \nDALE I have to stop this. I don't know how, but don't worry. I'll keep you safe. (beat) But still, watch your back. You never know where they might be, whoever they are. \nAngie gets in the car. Dale pecks her on the lips. \nDALE (CONT'D) I love you. \nBeat. \nANGIE Uh...thanks. \nAngie gets in the car. Dale pecks her on the lips. \nDALE Um...you're welcome. And nice to meet you guys. \nShe shuts her door and the Anderson's pull out. Dale watches them depart with great concern. \nSAUL Why aren't we in that car? \nDALE Let's run, man! Run! \nDALE Thanks, man. (beat) You know, my last dealer was a total dick. You're by far the coolest dealer I've ever had. \nSAUL (sincerely) Wow. Thanks, man. I seriously appreciate that. \nDALE Yeah...like, the time before last time, I totally had weed. I just kind of wanted to chill with you. \nSAUL (over-joyed) Really? That's awesome, man. That means a lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes come in to buy and pretend to be all buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm always, like, \"you don't like me, you like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!\" You know? And just so you know, I totally could have lit that cross-joint on my own. I'd just have to use candles, but, like, I've never smoked one of those with anyone before. \nDale passes Saul the joint. \nDALE So, do you think we should leave town? We could just get on a bus and go, right? \nSAUL We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't think that could even pay for one ticket. \nSaul rubs the roach out in the dirt. \nDALE What about your sack? \nSaul rubs his balls again. \nSAUL Oh man. It's still fucking killing me. \nDALE (laughing) No dude, your sack of weed. Can't we sell some? \nSAUL Of course. That's my bread and butter. We just have to go to a highschool. It's the easiest market. Chester A. Arthur is like, a block a way. \nDALE No way, man. I'm not going to sell to kids. \nSAUL Why? They're gonna get it from somewhere. I mean, we got it from guys like us. \nDALE Well, then not kids at that school. \nSAUL Well, there's a bunch of private ones nearby, but they're into way crazier shit than weed- \nDALE I can't do it, man. I'm not going to a high school is there anywhere else we could go? \nSAUL (thinks, then-) We could go to Crackhead Park. \nDALE What's that? \nSAUL It's a park. Really close, actually. Full of crackheads. They smoke weed too, though. \nEXT. CRACKHEAD PARK - NIGHT \nThere are several tarp-houses set up, garbage all over, and crazy/dangerous homeless people milling about the park. A deranged looking homeless man walks over to another one and starts pissing on his leg. They begin fist fighting. Suddenly, a half eaten hamburger hits Dale in the face and a bag lady comes up to Saul and starts poking him. \nSAUL Hey, stop it. Stop it. You wanna buy some weed, or, like, what? \nThe bag lady runs off. \nSAUL (CONT'D) See, that's the problem around here. Target demographic has a real, uh, fickle attention span. You gotta wow `em. (beat) Hey! Who wants some weed!?! \nDALE Fuck this place. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL - LUNCHTIME - THE NEXT DAY \nAt the same high school Angie goes to, Dale and Saul walk up to four thirteen year old students. (DESMOND, WALT, ACK and BLAKE) \nSAUL Yo. `sup. You guys want some chronic? \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND A CONVIENANCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER \nDale and the four kids all laugh hysterically as Saul marches around pretending to be Godzilla, blasting weed smoke out of his nose and mouth as though it was fire. Saul passes Ack the joint. He takes a puff and starts coughing. \nDALE (very stoned) Man, this is great. \nACK Cough   Cough  What's it called again? \nWALT Pineapple express. They said it, like, eight times, you fucking `tard. \nACK Oh, so sorry if I- \nBLAKE Come on, man. Puff, puff, pass. \nSAUL You know, I went here for a year. Kicked me out for having a swiss army knife. Everyone has a swiss army knife! \nDALE I got like, thirty for my Bar Mitzvah. \nDESMOND My Bar Mitzvah sucked. \nShe walks towards her car as Dale sits on the ground. \nANGLE ON: Saul \nSaul merrily turns into the alley holding TWO RED SLURPEES, when he jumps back in terror! He sees the cop car up the alley. He ducks back behind the corner. \nSAUL They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck... \nANGLE ON: Dale and the Police Liaison \nShe looks at her car computer. The screen reads: \nDALE DENTON: OUTSTANDING WARRANT - DOUBLE HIT AND RUN. \nShe looks back at Dale and types into her computer. \nINT. CAROL'S COP CAR - CONTINUOUS \nWe see Carol (who is in fact Ted's evil accomplice) speeding down the road. Her police computer beeps. She looks at the screen. \nCAROL (smiling) Denton. \nEXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS \nThe Police Liaison stuffs Dale in the back of her squad car. \nDALE What is this for? What did that thing tell you? What did I do? \nPOLICE LIAISON Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double, actually. You hit two parked cars two nights ago. \nA look of crippling horror comes across Dale's face as she throws him in the back seat and slams his door shut. \nANGLE ON: Saul \nHe peaks down the alley and sees Dale in the back of the car and the FEMALE Police Liaison getting in the front. \nSAUL The lady cop. She's gonna kill him. \nThe car slowly makes a three point turn. \nINT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS \nDALE You don't understand! You have to let me go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please! \nThe Police Liaison ignores Dale. \nDALE (CONT'D) This...this lady cop, and these guys Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for Ted Jones, and- \nPOLICE LIAISON (suddenly interested) Ted Jones? \nDALE Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know what I'm talking about. He lives near Evergreen Heights. He- \nPOLICE LIAISON Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and a police office shoot someone? \nDALE Yeah. An Asian someone. \nThe Police Liaison ponders as she finishes her three point turn and drives toward the exit of the alley. \nPOLICE LIAISON Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you down to the station. \nDALE (ecstatic) Yes ma'am. \nEXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS \nSaul peeks out and sees the approaching cop car. He looks at the two red slurpees and thinks, then suddenly jumps out and THROWS himself onto the hood of the cop car! \nThe Police Liaison and Dale see a body SLAM against the car and RED LIQUID SPLATTER everywhere, covering the windshield. They SCREAM. \nWHAM! In the impact, we clearly see Saul's BALLS getting ROCKED on the car! The Police Liaison slams on the brakes, causing Dale to SMASH into the metal cage. \nPOLICE LIAISON Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god! \nShe puts the car in park. As the Police Liaison gets out of her car, Saul can be seen crawling around the back of the vehicle, clutching his testicles. The frightened Police Liaison looks at the windshield. \nShe notices the two slurpee cups on the ground and quickly turns around. She sees Saul jumping into the drivers seat. \nSaul sees a SHOTGUN beside the passenger seat. The Police Liaison reaches for her GUN! \nDALE NO! What are you doing!?! \nSAUL Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and Cash! \nSaul's hand flails around, grasping everything. He feels the SHOTGUN and accidentally pulls the trigger- \nBOOM! The blast blows through the roof of the car and hits an overhead TRAFFIC LIGHT - shredding it to pieces! \nSAUL                          DALE JESUS!!!                         SHIT! \nCarol flies into the intersection on a collision course with Saul and Dale. \nCRUNCH! A car smashes into the side of the Carol's cruiser. \nAs Dale and Saul speed off, Carol emerges from the smoking wreckage, a look of hate in her eyes. \nEXT. QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nThe stolen cruiser screeches to a halt and Saul hops out. \nSAUL Run! \nHe starts running up the block at top speed. \nDale, still handcuffed in the back of the cruiser, starts thrashing and screaming. \nDALE Saul! Saul! I'm locked in! \nDale continues to scream as Saul obliviously bolts to the end of the block and just keeps going. \nDALE (CONT'D) You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!! \nDale sits in the car, helpless. He has a look of utter disbelief on his face. After a moment of silence he starts wildly kicking the door window. He soon gives up. \nJust then, Dale notices Saul, over a block away, running back towards the stolen car. Saul soon arrives, completely out of breath, and opens the door. \nSAUL So... huff ... huff ...fuckin' sorry... huff ...forgot... \nDale flops out of the car and onto the grass. Saul tries to help him to his feet, but Dale pulls away. \nDALE Don't touch me, you asshole! \nDale wiggles to his feet runs for it. Saul follows. \nINT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY \nDale and Saul enter the hardware store, walking very close together so that no one sees Dale is handcuffed. They receive a few odd looks as they search and locate what they are looking for: saws. Saul quickly finds a sturdy looking hack-saw. \nSAUL Okay, only one way to do this, hard and fast. Bend over. \nDale gets on his knees and bends over, pressing his face up against the wall. Saul begins to manically hack away at the cuffs. \nDALE Ow! Ow! Hurry! \nSAUL I am! \nSuddenly, Saul sees a store clerk coming and shoves the saw underneath Dale's suit jacket. \nDALE Which saw do you like most? \nSAUL The brown ones nice, but the metallic ones seems more... \nThey watch the clerk walk off and immediately return to sawing the handcuffs. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HARDWARE STORE - SOON AFTER \nDale stretches his arms. The handcuffs are still on his hands, but no longer attached. \nDALE (relieved) Okay, I'm going to go call Angie. Be right back. \nSAUL A thank you would be nice! \nEXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER \nDale is on the phone. \nDALE Could I have the, uh, Carlyle room, please? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAngie is watching TV alone in a hotel room. The phone rings and she picks it up. \nDALE Saul! I'm sorry, man! I didn't mean all that! Saul! \nA sad Dale starts picking up the money. \nINT. TED'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nCarol, who is a little bruised up from the car crash, sits with Ted. They are both furious. \nCAROL Guy drove like a mother-fucker. It was amazing. \nTED This is not good. We should have this under control. We haven't heard shit from the Asians. Got these lunatics after us. Shit. \nCarol checks her watch. \nCAROL We should probably get to the farm. \nMUSIC UP: THE END by THE DOORS \n- Saul gets on a bus and sits down, sad and deject. \n- Dale sits against the phone booth, crying like a baby. He buries his hands in his pocket and pulls out his baggy of weed. He hurls it away. He gets up to retrieve it. \n- Saul is in a really shitty fast food restaurant, nearly crying as he eats his burger and fries. \n- Dale stares at a joint in his hands, thinks for a moment, and then, crying profusely, lights it and starts smoking. \nA solitary tear rolls down his cheek and drips directly onto the tip of the joint, putting it out. Dale hears the sizzle and looks at the joint. He continues crying. He puts the joint down, beside three large roaches. \n- Walking down the street, Saul sees the Point Grey Retirement Home. \n- Dale feverishly looks through the phone book. He finds what he's looking for: Belogus. \n- Saul, hiding behind a bush across the street, surveys the retirement home. Seeing the coast is clear, he walks towards the entrance. As Saul enters the building, Budlofksy and Matheson pull up. \nINT. RETIREMENT HOME - CONTINUOUS \nSaul casually walks into the lobby. The elderly residents of the retirement home are milling around the massive common room. \nELDERLY WOMAN(O.S.) Solly? \nSaul turns and sees an ELDERLY WOMAN. \nSAUL Hey! Mrs. Mendelson! \nSaul peers over her shoulder and sees Budlofsky and Matheson walk in! \nSAUL (CONT'D) HOLY SHIT!!! \nSaul runs for it, and they chase after him. He maneuvers through the elderly like a pylon course, the thugs right on his ass. He bursts into another room. \nINT. CAFFETERIA - CONTINUOUS \nHe tears through the room, filled with old people eating. Budlofsky and Matheson pursue him. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nAs Saul runs through the hall, Budlofksy and Matheson appear. \nMATHESON Eat it! \nMatheson whip out his gun and fires - BLAM! The bullet whizzes past Saul and two elderly men, who don't even flinch, and then shatters a distant window. Saul turns the corner and- \nBAM! He slams into someone, sending the person crashing to the ground. \nINJURED PERSON OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow! \nSaul looks, terrified he's hurt an old person, but sees it is a young male nurse. He runs for it and sees an open door with chatter coming from inside. He runs into- \nINT. TEA ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA dead end! Several startled OLD WOMEN look up from their Majong. One of them instantly recognizes Saul- \nMRS. CORBER Solly Silver?!? \nSAUL Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me! \nThe Budlofsky and Matheson bursts into the room. Saul looks around, sees a teapot and grabs it. He hurls it at Matheson and nails him in the face. The tea pot shatters and hot water pours all over his face and hand. \nMATHESON AHH!!! FUCK!!! \nBudlofsky GRABS Saul and knees him in the balls. \nAs Matheson ushers Saul through the foliage, Saul notices a strange suit that resembles an old fashioned scuba diving uniform (the one from the 1930s intro) hanging on a wall. \nSAUL What the hell is that? \nThey arrive at a door. Matheson opens it and shoves Saul in, causing him to almost trip. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Ow. \nIt is the same room Private Miller was in. Matheson shuts the door. \nINT. RED'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nBAM! Dale kicks open Red's door and dashes into Red's, ready for anything. \nDALE Hello? Anyone here? Red? \nDale starts looking around. He hears music and then sees he's stepping in a pool of blood. \nDALE (CONT'D) Oh my god. \nDale follows the music into the bathroom. \nINT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDale enters and is shocked to see Red lying on the floor, clenching his bloody gut with one hand and a joint and beer in the other. The music is coming from a small boom box. \nRED (a little out of it) What? Who the fuck! \nRed turns toward Dale and picks up a kitchen knife with his bloody hand. \nRED (CONT'D) Stay the fuck back, Denton! I didn't do shit! I'll gut ya if I have to, tooled ya once, tool ya again! \nDALE (utterly shocked) I...what? I'm not here to fight, man, I- \nRED Good, man. I'm fuckin' tired. \nRed drops the knife and then takes a puff of his joint and a sip of his beer. \nRED (CONT'D) I'm dyin', Denton. Fuckin' shot. Right here- (he points at his wound) (MORE) \nRED (CONT'D) I'm having a little going away party and I don't remember inviting you, cocksucker. So I'm gonna ask you to leave. In my dying moments, I don't want some asshole I barely know around. \nDALE Go to the hospital, man! Are you crazy. You don't have to die. \nRED Yes I do! What? I go to the hospital, I'm gonna end up in But that doesn't matter `cause once Ted finds out, which he will, I'm dead wherever I am. I'm fucked through and through. Now if you'd be willing to give a dying man his wish, could ya run on into the other room and pop in disc two of Tu Pacs \"All Eyez On Me\". I want to listen to it while I die. \nDALE You don't have to die. \nRED Will you stop saying that, I've excepted it, man. I'm at peace.  cough \nRed takes a hit and coughs. It clearly brings terrible pain to his bullet wound. \nDALE Red, I need you to tell me where Ted's base is. He took Saul, and I can't bail on him. I'm going to get him back. \nRed stares intensely at Dale. \nRED Fuckin eh, amigo. \nRed heroic-ish-ly rises from the floor. He hobbles over to the hall and opens a cabinet on the wall. Dale looks in and sees several hand guns inside. \nRED (CONT'D) Blaze of glory, motherfucker. \nINT/EXT. RED'S CAR - NIGHT \nDale and Red are in Red's car, a FORD FIESTA, driving through the countryside. Dale stops the car 100 yards from the barn. \nRED This is awesome! We're so gonna show those motherfuckers. Think they can kill me? Fuck no, you can't! Not how I roll. \nRed gets out and walks to the drivers side. Dale gets out, gun in hand. Red gets in the drivers seat. \nDALE What are you doing? \nRED So, this is the backside of the farm. If you stay low in the grass you should be fine. If someone is shooting at you with an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes you harder to hit. \nDALE You're not coming to help? \nRED Fuck no! I've been shot. By these guys. I was in shock before, but the air on the drive cleared my mind, I should get to the hospital. You saw Reservoir Dogs, right? I got shot in the best spot possible. I could have a long and fruitful life ahead of me. Full of possibilities. Go get `em, slugger. \nDALE But how do I get out of here if I rescue Saul? \nRED I've no idea. I'm sure it won't be that hard. Kill some dude and take his car, or just take it or whatever. Good luck, amigo! \nINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nThe barn door slides open. Ted and Carol walk in. \nTED You have them? \nBUDLOFSKY Got them downstairs. \nCAROL Where did you find them? \nBUDLOFSKY We found Saul at his grandmother's and Dale Denton busted in here like a madman, armed to the teeth, and- \nBudlofsky looks over at the man he shot. \nBUDLOFSKY (CONT'D) Yeah, he just plugged Frank and then I disarmed him. We got `em both holed up downstairs. \nTED He shot Frank? Jesus. Fuckin' Frank. \nCAROL Who the fuck is this Dale Denton? \nEXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nFive Asian men lay on their stomachs in the tree line dressed in black and armed with machine guns. One of them stares through a pair of night-vision binoculars while utilizing a listening device. We see his view of Ted and hear what he hears. \nTED Well, we'll torture these two bastards and find out everything they know. What about the shipment? Ready to move out? \nBUDLOFSKY We'll be good to in 10 minutes or so. \nThe Asian leader nods and does some hand signals to his men. The acknowledge they understand. He holds up a flashlight and flashes three times. From the opposing side of the barn two other flashlights blink back. They all get up and start to slowly move towards the barn. \nINT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS \nDale and Saul are still \"humping\" away. \nDALE This isn't working. Turn around. I'm using my mouth. \nDale drops to his knees and starts gnawing at the tape on Saul's hands. Suddenly, they hear approaching footsteps. \nSAUL (whispering) Someone's coming! \nDALE (whispering) Yo - if I cough, I'm going to make a move, if I cough twice, you take the lead. Got it? \nSAUL (whispering) What? No! What if you actually cough? \nDale stands up just as Matheson walks in, gun drawn. Dale looks at Saul and notices that he's managed to free his hands. \nDale COUGHS TWICE. Saul shoots him a worried look and shakes his head. Matheson notices. Saul COUGHS TWICE. Dale shoots him a confused look. Saul motions at him and COUGHS TWICE MORE. \nMATHESON Hey man, whatever you're doing, I get it, okay? So just stop it, alright? Just cut it- \nDALE CHARGES DIRECTLY AT MATHESON!!! \nBLAM! Matheson shoots at Dale's head! Dale falls to the ground, specks of blood hitting Saul as he dives forwards, TACKLING Matheson into the wall! \nThe Matheson's gun slides across the room, hitting Dale's motionless body. Saul scrambles for the gun and grabs it. Matheson gets to his feet. Saul turns and- \nBLAM! He shoots Matheson in the gut. \nMATHESON (CONT'D) AAAHHHHH!!! \nSAUL Holy shit, man! I'm sorry! \nMatheson writhes in pain. \nMATHESON AAAHHHHH!!! ARGH!!! YOU SHOT ME! I'VE NEVER BEEN SHOT! HELP! HELP! AAAAAHHHHH!!! \nSaul turns to see Dale lying face down. \nINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nTed and Carol talk as Budlofsky and the thugs silently stands by. Ted is holding a large hunting knife. \nTED Has anyone seen my bigger knife? (beat) Do you guys hear that? \nSUDDENLY, there is an EXPLOSION and a hole is blown in the barn wall. Budlofsky is blasted back and badly torn up. \nBUDLOFSKY Arg... \nAsian assassins start pouring into the barn. One of them sees the wounded Budlofsky and blasts him away with a machine gun. \nTED BUDLOFSKY!!! \nSAUL (pointing across the room) There's some dudes in here. I saw them when I got dragged down. And there's some kind of super-suit or something. \nDALE Were they armed? \nSAUL (whispering) I don't think so. \nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Dale and Saul both scramble along a row of weed planets as bullets ricochet all around them. They continue running and then stop. \nDALE I can't hear them. \nSaul spots an air vent in the middle of the room. \nSAUL You could boost me up! We'll sneak out. \nBLAM! BLAM! They are being shot at again. \nDALE Shoot back! \nSAUL Really? \nDALE YES! \nSaul hesitantly takes aim and pulls the trigger. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! \nDALE (CONT'D) Now run! \nThey run and turn several corners when Saul suddenly trips over a dead thug. \nSAUL                             DALE AH!!!                         WHOA!!! \nDALE (CONT'D) Nice. You got him. \nDale picks up the thug's machine gun. Suddenly, a thug appears behind Saul. \nTHUG 7 Lance? Holy fuck! You sons-of- \nDale shoots right over Saul's shoulder and nails the thug several times. \nDALE Holy shit. I killed him. \nSAUL About time you killed somebody. You're the one whose supposed to be saving me, and I`ve killed two bad guys already. \nSaul looks to the vent in the middle of the room. Dale looks at the pipe, sizes up Saul and himself, and takes a deep breath. \nDALE You'll never be able to pull me up, but I'll boost you up there and you just fucking run for it, man. \nSAUL What? No fucking way, Dale. What about you? \nDale cocks his gun. \nDALE Don't worry about me. \nSAUL Whoa. That was awesome. \nSaul tucks the gun in his belt and awkwardly climbs atop Dale's shoulders and tears the vent off. \nSAUL (CONT'D) You're a good man, Dale Denton. \nSaul lifts himself in. SUDDENLY, Dale sees Ted enter the room and immediately go for his gun. \nDALE Hold on! \nSAUL Wha- \nDale walks out from under Saul, raises his gun, and unloads - RATA-TAT-TAT!!! Ted ducks as the plants around him are torn asunder. Dale runs out of ammo. \nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Ted shoots at Saul, who narrowly avoids the gunfire as he pulls himself into the vent. Ted redirects his attention to Dale, who is running through the bushes. Ted blasts off a few shots before Dale vanishes into the foliage. \nTED Denton!!! \nINT. VENT - CONTINUOUS \nSaul wiggles his way through the vent. He turns a corner and- \nSAUL AHHH!!! \nThere is a skeleton wedged in the vent. A grate leading out is directly above the corpse. Saul squeamishly crawls over the skeleton. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Ew. Gross, man. A fuckin' dead guy. \nHe spots dog tags around it's neck as he crawls by. They read: Private Greg B. Miller. \n", "test1_input": "RADIO DJ 3 What gives you the right to say that? \nDALE Everything! They should be able to collect garbage TWICE a week. Why not? (MORE) \nDALE (CONT'D) As a tax payer, can't I say that? Come get my garbage a bit more! Is that so f- ing crazy? I'm not asking for free beer Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city would be more aesthetically pleasing and smell better. And don't pretend you can't smell it. Ever been to New York? Great place, smells like piss, though. (takes a hit and starts coughing) Twice a week,  cough  might fix that. (starts coughing harder) Hold on one sec. \nEXT. HOSPITAL - LATER \nDale gets out of his car, followed by some plumes of smoke, and goes to his trunk. He chuckles as he takes out a lab coat and walks towards the hospital. \nINT. HOSPITAL - SOON AFTER \nDale, looking very professional in his lab coat, rushes to reception. \nDALE I need Dr. Terrence, immediately. \nRECEPTIONIST Of course. One moment. \nThe receptionist immediately picks up the phone. \nINT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER \nDR. TERRENCE runs towards reception, where Dale is still waiting. \nDR. TERRENCE (to Dale) Hi there, I don't think we've met, I'm- \nDALE Dr. Edgar Terrence. You're the guy who repeatedly refused to take care of the monkey tree that spills onto your neighbors property. And now, because of that, you've been served. \nINT. DALE'S CAR - LATER \nDale hits a pipe. It is clear he strongly disagrees with what the DJ is saying. \nTALK RADIO DJ ...stay in your own country. Five simple words. And stay the hell out of mine! I'm not a racist, per se, but I'm not some hippy tree humper. \nWe see his ear piece and hear that he is on hold. \nDALE Let me through, damnit. \nEXT. HOTEL - VALET \nDale, wearing a chauffeur hat, stands by the main entrance holding a sign that reads: JOSH CORBER. A man walks out of the hotel and, seeing the sign, approaches Dale. \nCORBER My name's Corber. \nDALE You're Joshua Aaron Corber? \nCORBER (overjoyed) Get out of town! Clarice did this, didn't she? I was just telling her before I left how I've never been in a limo. Can you believe it? 35 and I've never been in a limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it? \nDale hands him a BLUE ENVELOPE. \nDALE Sorry, but you've been served. \nDale walks away. CORBER opens the envelope and reads it. \nCORBER Ah fuck! (reads more) Fuck! You fucking asshole!!! FUCK! \nDale completely ignores Corber as he dumps the sign and walks out of the airport. Then, a huge smile comes across his face. He has noticed a nearby Burger King. \nDALE (excited) Hey! Nice. New chicken fries. \nHe happily walks toward the food. \nINT - DALE'S CAR - DAY \nDale sits in his car   outside a high school. An array of Burger King wrappers   surrounds him as he rolls a joint with the last of his   weed on top of a Batman comic. He lights the joint and   turns on the radio. \nRADIO DJ ...3:09 in the PM and we- \nDale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then snubs out the joint. He then pulls out a small leather kit and sifts through it's contents: handi-wipes, hand sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, Visine, mouthwash and breath mints. \nDale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in his blazing red eyes. Frustrated, he squirts Visine all over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes. He uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some cologne, and then gets out of the car. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS \nDale walks towards the school. \nANGIE Dale! \nDale turns to see his attractive 19 year old girlfriend, ANGIE ANDERSON, walking towards him with her group of friends. She kisses him. \nANGIE (CONT'D) Mmm. Minty. \n", "test1_true": "DALE Hey Kyle. (to Angie) So, should we head back to my place and finish up the trilogy? Matrix: Revolution. Whose it gonna be, Angie? Man or machine? \nANGIE Of course. But can we just head to my locker first? I left some stuff by mistake. \nDALE Sure. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - SOON AFTER \nDale and Angie walk hand in hand towards the locker. \nANGIE So, are you going to come over for dinner tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning to think I made you up. \nDALE Well, yeah, I really want to meet them. Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...let me think. \nANGIE You don't have to feel weird about it. They know how old you are and they're fine with it. They just want to meet you and see that you're a cool guy and that I'm not dating you just because you're older. \nDALE Of course. I know that. It's just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole bunch of cases that I can finish tomorrow. It's probably going to take me into the night. \nANGIE Fuck. Well, then you have to just come over sometime this week or something, okay? `Cause it's getting weird for them. \nDALE I will. I promise. I'm not trying to avoid this, for real, I've just been crazy busy. \nTEACHER Hello? Can I help you? \nDale and Angie turn to see a TEACHER, a guy about the same age as Dale. \nDALE Pardon? \nTEACHER You can't just waltz in here and hit on the students. Get out now before I- \nANGIE Mr. Edwards, he's my boyfriend. \nMr. Edwards looks at Dale, then shoots Angie a confused look. \nMR. EDWARDS This is your boyfriend? How old are you, \nDALE \nMR. EDWARDS And you're dating an 18 year old? \nANGIE I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco. \nDale doesn't know what to make of Mr. Edwards comments and looks. \nMR. EDWARDS Alright, well this school is for students and faculty only. Friends can't just stop by. \nDALE Dude, you may be a teacher here, but we're about the same age, so don't get all high and mighty. It's not that weird. Frankly, it's natural. \nMR. EDWARDS Well, in that case, get off school property or I'm calling the Police Liaison officer. Angie, no offense to you, but if this guy's dating someone your age, it's because nobody his age will date him. \nThen, four HANDSOME AND FIT STUDENTS walk by. \nHANDSOME STUDENT Hey Angie. You were hilarious in drama today. \nAngie smiles at the guys. Dale doesn't like how all this is going down. \nDALE I'll wait in the car. \nINT. DALE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nDale and Angie sit in the parked car making out. \nANGIE So, do you want to get some food? \nDALE No...actually I can't. I have to go serve a guy. \nANGIE Now? \nDALE Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang out later though. You can come over. \nANGIE We'll see if Neo is truly the one. \nThey share a long kiss, and Angie gets out of the car. Dale watches her walk away, then whips out his cell phone and hits speed dial. \nSAUL (O.S.) (over phone) Yo? \nDALE Yo. It's Dale. Mind if I come by and pick up some shit? \nINT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - LATER \n", "test1_id": 456, "test2_input": "SAUL SILVER is constructing a CROSS-SHAPED JOINT (two joints that intersect one another). Pot and paraphernalia are scattered all over the coffee table. A large \"Scarface\" movie poster hangs on the wall. There is a knock at the door and Dale enters. \nDALE What's up, Saul. \nSAUL (unpleasantly surprised) What the fuck?!? \nDALE What? \nSAUL I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here? \nDALE Whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me in. I- \nSAUL That's fucked up, man! This building is filled with fuckin' assholes. What else is the buzzer for? Fuck. \nDALE I'll buzz next time, man. I'm real sorry. I'm just not familiar with your, uh...protocol yet. \nSAUL Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro. We're always cool. It's those fuckin' jaggoffs. \nDALE Um...sure. \nDale awkwardly sits down on the other side of the couch. \nSAUL Brass tacs. I've got this new bud. Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but fortunately, it's hands down the dopest fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've smoked some dope fuckin' shit. \nDALE Better than that Blue Oyster weed? \nSAUL Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso Snowflake had a baby, and then by some miracle those babies met, and fucked - then this would be the shit they'd birth. \nSaul pulls out a big bag of weed. He places it on the coffee table as though it was his child. He pulls out a large bud. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Smell it. \nDale takes the weed and looks at it. It looks spectacular. Bright red hairs and large crystals, huge purple and blue leaves - just spectacular! Dale smells it and is taken aback. \nDALE What is this? It's spectacular. \nSAUL It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red told me it's when this Hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the only guy in the whole city who has it. And, its only ten bones more for a quarter. \nDALE So...can I get a quarter? \nSAUL No doubt. Just let me grab my scale. \nSaul walks into another room. Dale looks around anxiously; he clearly wants to go. \nA moment later, Saul comes back into the room and sits down. Dale notices that he didn't bring anything back from the other room. Saul notices Dale looking at him strangely. \nSAUL (CONT'D) What's with the look? What? \nDALE Where's the scale? \nSAUL Oh shit! The scale. Be right back. \nSaul hustles into the other room. \nSAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D) (from other room) You know what's weird? How sometimes, your brain just chooses to like, not keep things in it, you know? (beat) Fucking scale. (beat) Shit. Where is it? \nDale checks his watch and then looks at the door; suddenly, something catches his eye - it's the cross- joint Saul was constructing. \nDALE Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing? \nSaul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on the coffee table. \nSAUL (nonchalantly) Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen one of these? Not surprising. They are, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. NASA built the first one in the eighties. \nSaul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the scale. \nDALE You can actually smoke that contraption? \nSaul puts Dale's weed in a baggie. \nSAUL You light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a \"trifecta\" of smoking power. It's like, three times as powerful as a normal joint. \nDale hands Saul some money and Saul gives him his weed. Dale lingers for a moment. \nDALE Well, be careful with that thing. \nDale gets up and heads to the door. \nSAUL Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with me? \nDale turns around. He clearly wants to smoke it, but he tries to play it cool. \n", "test2_true": "Dale sits back down on the couch, giddy as a schoolgirl. \nDALE (excited) Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what do I do? \nSaul gathers three lighters from the coffee table. \nSAUL Alright. Firstly you light these two ends. Then I will light the tip, making the trifecta complete. Are you ready? \nDale nods and they light the joint. Saul tokes hard; plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a COUGHING FIT. \nDALE Holy... \nDale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a coughing fit. \nSAUL It's...uh, it's good to cough.  COUGH  It opens the  COUGH  capillaries...gets you twenty-five percent higher. (MORE) \nSAUL (CONT'D) And that, combined with the pineapple weed, and the cross-joint  COUGH  you're a good thirty to forty times higher. I don't know the exact math, but, pff, you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You know what I mean? \nSaul takes a toke. Dale coughs HARDER and HARDER. He seems like he might throw up. \nSAUL (CONT'D) It's crazy. The better the weed, the more I wish I could think of how to explain what's so good about it, but the...uh, the better it is, the less shit I can think of in total, you know? \nSaul passes Dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all over his suit. Slightly agitated, Dale brushes it off. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Okay, so, like, you've been buying from me for, like, a few months now and I really gotta ask. (beat) What's with the suit? \nDALE I'm a process server. \nSAUL You`re a servant? Like, a butler. \nDALE No, process server. \nSaul looks confused. \nDALE (CONT'D) I'm hired to give people papers they don't want. It's pretty much the easiest job on earth. \nSAUL Nice, man. Where'd you get that job? \nDale takes a big hit from the joint. \nDALE Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree two years ago, then I did nothing for a year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked me up. \nThey both revel in the thought. \nDALE (CONT'D) I got it pretty sweet, though. Today? I smoked like five joints, gave out some pieces of paper, and I ate some Burger King- \nSAUL Hey man, did you get those new chicken fries? \nDale passes the join to Saul. \nDALE Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot- boxed my car and then...got some action from my girlfriend. \nSaul laughs at this. \nSAUL Does she smoke pot? \nDALE A little. She's in high school. \nSAUL That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're like Jerry Lee Lewis. I just read his biography. \nDALE No, no. She's 19. \nSAUL (dissappointed) Oh. It's still cool I guess. \nDALE Yeah, it's awesome, although I think she's getting old enough where she's realizing I don't do much. And these high school guys these days. They're all roided out and going to Harvard. Even on my best days, I look like a fat, dumb piece of shit next to them. \nSAUL Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it pretty good. I wish I had a job that easy. Fuck. \nDALE Dude...you've got, like, the actual easiest job in the world. \nSAUL Hey! You're right, man. I never thought of it like that. \nDALE You can actually do whatever the hell you want. You get to sleep all day and people come buy weed at night. \nDale passes Saul the joint. \nSAUL That's totally true. Except tomorrow. Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I gotta go change my grandma's clocks forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't figure it out. \nDALE Sorry to hear that. \n", "test2_id": 457, "test3_input": "RED (to Matheson's corpse) You just got killed by a Ford Fiesta motherfucker!!! How you like me now!?! \nSAUL R...Red? \nRED Saul! `sup! Dude, me and that Dale guy are rescuing you. And getting revenge on those whose shot us in the gut. \nBLAM! Red gets shot in the gut and drops! \nSAUL RED!!! \nSaul spins around to see Carol standing behind him, a machine gun aimed. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Oh no... \nCAROL Oh yeah! \nINT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS \nTed and Dale grapple violently on the ground. His gut jiggles as he lunges forwards, punching Dale in the throat! Dale falls to his knees, gasping for air. Ted kicks him in the head and picks up his GUN. \nANGLE ON: AN ASIAN ASSASSIN \nBarely alive, the Asian Assassin with the briefcase drags himself down the corridor and enters the grow room. He opens the briefcase and we see that it is a bomb. The assassin inserts a key. \nTed stands over Dale, aims the gun to his head, and- \nKA-BOOM!!! THE BRIEFCASE EXPLODES!!!. Flames sweep over the room as Dale rolls for cover. Ted gets blasted back. \nINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nSaul tries to be brave as Carol takes final aim. \nCAROL Now prepare to eat shit and die- \nKABOOM!!! The explosion BURSTS UP from the hatch with incredible force. Saul and Carol get blown back as Red's Ford Fiesta is sent flying up in the air. The flaming car lands DIRECTLY on Carol and explodes. The entire barn is now engulfed in flames. \nINT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS \nThe air thick with weed smoke, Dale slowly rises to his feet. He sees Ted slumped against the wall, dead, partially aflame. Dale walks over to Ted's body and takes the gun out of his hand. \nDALE Sorry, Ted... \nHe pulls a small BLUE ENVELOPE out of his pocket and drops it on Ted. \nDALE (CONT'D) ...but you've been served. \nDale turns to see the exit blocked by a wall of fire. The air is thick with smoke and he can barely breath. Dale looks around desperately. He spots the FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He looks at the flames. He takes a deep breath, picks up the fire extinguisher, hurls it with all his might at the fire, and then quickly whips out his gun and shoots at it! \nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He hits the extinguisher and it explodes, blasting out the fire in the hallway towards the barn. Dale runs like hell. \nAs he bolts down the hallway, the flames rush back in and chase after him. \nINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nThe barn starts to buckle, when Dale suddenly leaps out of the trap door, flames licking his heels. Coughing profusely, Dale stands in the barn, then realizes his pants are on fire. \nDALE Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Aaaahhhh!!! \nDale wriggles out of his pants and kicks them away. \nDALE (CONT'D) Ow. Ah. Ow. Okay... cough   cough \nHe starts to walk out of the barn when he suddenly trips over someone. \nDALE (CONT'D) Saul! \nHe grabs one of the unconscious Saul's feet and starts to drag him out of the barn. Just a they exit, the barn COLLAPSES in on itself, crumbling into a massive heap of burning wood. Dale pulls Saul onto the grass. Saul starts coughing. \nDALE (CONT'D) Saul!  Cough   Cough  You're okay! \nSAUL (confused) Cough   Cough  What the fuck happened? \nDALE We... Cough ...we did it. We beat them. We won. \nSAUL No fucking way. Seriously? (pointing at the fire) How did that happen? \nDALE I have absolutely no idea. \nSAUL They were fighting Asian dudes, man. \nDALE Asian dudes? So, okay...maybe this is revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted kill. \n", "test3_true": "DALE What's cool is that you came back for me man. You did, right? You weren't just captured again, were you? \nSAUL Hell no! I was scott-free. But how the hell was I going to leave you there after you came to save me? Fuck that. \nThey take a few deep breathes and each cough a bunch. Suddenly, they see something moving in the rubble. RED emerges, lightly crisped with his clothes on fire. He roles around in the dirt trying to put himself out. \nRED Motherfuckers. Motherfuckers. Light me on fire? Kill my Fiesta? Fuckers. \nDALE Red? You okay? \nRed pats out the flames and stands up, all charred and covered in dirt. \nRED Fuck yeah, I'm fine. I'm Red. You're makin' me feel like a broken record. Now can we get the fuck out of this shit hole. \nThey all stand up. Red puts his arms around Dale and Saul for support. They start to hobble towards the forest. \nSAUL What should we do now? Can we go home? \nDALE I've gotta get downtown, try and win Angie back. \nSAUL Tell her you cut off your ear for her, like that crazy artist. (beat) But, seriously dude, your joking right? She'll never take you back, ever. Just grow up and date a woman your own age. \nDALE Do you think we should have looked for the ear? They probably could've re- attached it, eh? I mean, this ear thing kind of fucking sucks. \nRED Oh my god, they blew your ear off, man! Fuck that's gross. Can you dudes switch sides? I don't want to look at it. \nSAUL Don't worry, man. Look at Evander Holyfield, he looks totally normal. And plus, I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel, they can actually grow ears, like, in a petri dish, or even on the side of a mouse. And you only need half of one. It'll be a fuckin' cinch. \nDALE I just realized I've 100% lost my job by now. I haven't called in for days. \nSAUL Who fuckin' cares? I thought you wanted to be a talk radio dude anyways? And, like, I never said anything, but you do have the voice. Like, when I didn't know what you did, I kind of thought you might have been doing cartoon voices, you know, like that Shrek shit, and that's why you wore a suit. \nRED You do have a good talk radio voice. I love that shit, too. I...wait, say something again? \nDALE What? Why? \nRED You're that dude whose always calling KSTAR about havin' two garbage days. I totally agree with you, man. I work out of my house, and it's, like, one of my main concerns, garbage pile up. \nDALE Saul, what're you going to do? \nSAUL Work at a bong shop. \nRED I'm still selling weed. Fuck you guys. \nThey walk together in silence, delighted at their new prospects. After a brief moment, Saul suddenly seems afraid. He starts nervously looking back towards the barn. \nSAUL Do you hear something? \nDale motions at his wounded ear. \nDALE All I hear is ringing. \nSAUL Dude, I'm kind of freakin' out. Like...I don't know...like, there might be someone out there. I mean...how do we know we got them all? \nRED What the fuck are you guys talkin' about? I don't hear shit. \nDale starts getting nervous, but tries to hide it. \nDALE Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of fire, and we probably each inhaled about ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just, you know- \nDale suddenly looks over his shoulder, but sees nothing. \nDALE (CONT'D) ...a little paranoia. \nSaul grabs Dale. \nSAUL (whispering) Stop! \nThey freeze. \nRED (whispering) Are you guys fuckin' with me? \nDALE (whispering) What- \nSAUL                               RED (whispering)                      (whispering) \nSshh!

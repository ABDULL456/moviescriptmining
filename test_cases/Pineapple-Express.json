{"test1_input": "DALE And am I the only guy you gave it to? \nSAUL Yeah. So, we're the only guys. \nDALE But, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if they found a roach of it, right? \nSaul thinks for a moment. \nSAUL I could. Why? \nDALE (panicking) We should go, we shouldn't be here! We should go! \nSAUL No...seriously, why? \nDALE I left a roach of this weed in front of Ted's house! \nSAUL So what? I leave roaches all over fucking town. \nDALE No, listen - they could find the roach and say, \"This is pineapple weed, Saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did - let's go kill him.\" \nFinally, Saul understands. \nSAUL Mother of fuck! \nHe SPRINGS to his feet and BOLTS for the door. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Let's go! \nDale grabs Saul and stops him. \nDALE Wait! \nSAUL Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck out of here! \nDALE Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff. \nSaul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack. They run for the door. \nDALE (CONT'D) Are you sure you're not forgetting anything? \nSAUL Yes! Come on! \nINT. SAUL'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nSaul and Dale run to the elevator and frantically press the button, terrified for their lives. \nSAUL Fuck! I forgot something! \nSaul runs back to his apartment, leaving Dale alone and frightened. Saul BURSTS back out of his apartment holding his cell. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Dude, I was so scared going back, I thought there was gonna be guys there, and then you'd be gone, and there was this music in my head- \nDALE We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster. \nThey scramble towards the distant stairwell. Almost at the door, they hear the DING of the elevator arriving. \nDALE (CONT'D) Go back! Go back! \nThey DASH back to the elevator. Dale shoves his arm between the doors and they hop in. Saul rapidly presses the LOBBY button as the doors shut. They're both on the verge of hyperventilating. \nDALE (CONT'D) Okay, man. We gotta try to relax. \nSAUL Why?!? \nDALE We don't want to draw attention. \nSAUL (freaking out) Whose attention!?! You think they could be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?! \nDALE I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be cool. \nDING  The elevator SUDDENLY STOPS on the second floor. \nDALE (CONT'D)                     SAUL Oh my god!!!                  Ahhh!!! \nThe doors OPEN! There's no one there. The doors close. \nSAUL What the fuck was that? \nDALE That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm! \nThe elevator stops at the lobby and the doors open, they step out, bumping into two rough looking guys. \n", "test1_true": "Dale and Saul quickly leave as the bikers enter the elevator. \nINT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nThe rough looking guys, BUDLOFSKY and MATHESON, kick in Saul's door and dash into the room, guns drawn. Matheson spots a smoldering joint in the ashtray. \nMATHESON Look. \nBudlofsky whips out his cell and hits speed dial. \nBUDLOFSKY Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I think he knew we were coming. \nINT. DALE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nDale peels out of his spot and down the road. \nDALE Okay, what do you know about Ted? \nSAUL What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's tracking us with space satellites right now! He's got grey hair, that's all I knew. \nSaul checks behind them. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Let's go to your place. \nDALE No way! What if they did see my license plate!?! \nSAUL Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a motel, or a Holiday Inn. \nDALE Well, how much money do we have? \nSAUL All I've got is the seventy-five you gave me. \nDALE That's it!?! \nSAUL Well, how much money do you have? \nWhile Dale gets out his wallet, Saul opens Dale's change tray. It's full of roaches. \nDALE Uh...nine bucks. \nSAUL Well, shut up then! I've got more than you! \nDALE Fine. Forget the hotel. \nA tense beat. \nSAUL I wish we could just go nowhere. \nDALE Okay...where's nowhere? \nEXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS \nThe car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon-lit woods. Dale paces back and forth as Saul walks over. \nDALE So what do we know? Nothing. We may or may not be followed because we don't even know if he found the roach or not. And, we could just be completely crazy. But, the question is this: even if he found the roach, how could he know where you were? \nSAUL (thrilled) He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit, but I mean- \nDALE No, what I mean is, if Ted found the roach and identified the weed, how could he connect it to you? \nSAUL There's no way. He could only find out from Red. \nDALE Who is this Red guy? \nSAUL Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted and guys like me. And we're mad fucking tight. One time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand-job within, like, five minutes of me meeting her. \nDALE But let's say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say you, because...why wouldn't he? \nSAUL Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have called me if that happened. A hand-job, Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand job by now! \nDALE Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug dealer. \nSAUL So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you don't trust me then? \nSaul stares at Dale, who doesn't know how to respond. \nDALE Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him. \nSAUL Thank you! \n", "test1_id": 456, "test2_input": "DALE Thanks, man. (beat) You know, my last dealer was a total dick. You're by far the coolest dealer I've ever had. \nSAUL (sincerely) Wow. Thanks, man. I seriously appreciate that. \nDALE Yeah...like, the time before last time, I totally had weed. I just kind of wanted to chill with you. \nSAUL (over-joyed) Really? That's awesome, man. That means a lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes come in to buy and pretend to be all buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm always, like, \"you don't like me, you like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!\" You know? And just so you know, I totally could have lit that cross-joint on my own. I'd just have to use candles, but, like, I've never smoked one of those with anyone before. \nDale passes Saul the joint. \nDALE So, do you think we should leave town? We could just get on a bus and go, right? \nSAUL We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't think that could even pay for one ticket. \nSaul rubs the roach out in the dirt. \nDALE What about your sack? \nSaul rubs his balls again. \nSAUL Oh man. It's still fucking killing me. \nDALE (laughing) No dude, your sack of weed. Can't we sell some? \nSAUL Of course. That's my bread and butter. We just have to go to a highschool. It's the easiest market. Chester A. Arthur is like, a block a way. \nDALE No way, man. I'm not going to sell to kids. \nSAUL Why? They're gonna get it from somewhere. I mean, we got it from guys like us. \nDALE Well, then not kids at that school. \nSAUL Well, there's a bunch of private ones nearby, but they're into way crazier shit than weed- \nDALE I can't do it, man. I'm not going to a high school is there anywhere else we could go? \nSAUL (thinks, then-) We could go to Crackhead Park. \nDALE What's that? \nSAUL It's a park. Really close, actually. Full of crackheads. They smoke weed too, though. \nEXT. CRACKHEAD PARK - NIGHT \nThere are several tarp-houses set up, garbage all over, and crazy/dangerous homeless people milling about the park. A deranged looking homeless man walks over to another one and starts pissing on his leg. They begin fist fighting. Suddenly, a half eaten hamburger hits Dale in the face and a bag lady comes up to Saul and starts poking him. \nSAUL Hey, stop it. Stop it. You wanna buy some weed, or, like, what? \nThe bag lady runs off. \nSAUL (CONT'D) See, that's the problem around here. Target demographic has a real, uh, fickle attention span. You gotta wow `em. (beat) Hey! Who wants some weed!?! \nDALE Fuck this place. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL - LUNCHTIME - THE NEXT DAY \nAt the same high school Angie goes to, Dale and Saul walk up to four thirteen year old students. (DESMOND, WALT, ACK and BLAKE) \nSAUL Yo. `sup. You guys want some chronic? \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND A CONVIENANCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER \nDale and the four kids all laugh hysterically as Saul marches around pretending to be Godzilla, blasting weed smoke out of his nose and mouth as though it was fire. Saul passes Ack the joint. He takes a puff and starts coughing. \nDALE (very stoned) Man, this is great. \nACK Cough   Cough  What's it called again? \nWALT Pineapple express. They said it, like, eight times, you fucking `tard. \nACK Oh, so sorry if I- \nBLAKE Come on, man. Puff, puff, pass. \nSAUL You know, I went here for a year. Kicked me out for having a swiss army knife. Everyone has a swiss army knife! \nDALE I got like, thirty for my Bar Mitzvah. \nDESMOND My Bar Mitzvah sucked. \n", "test2_true": "DALE You touched a tit when you were twelve? \nWALT Lubell? Are you joking? Those are the finest tats in the grade! \nACK Fuck that, dude. Angie in 12th grade has, like, the sweetest tits ever. \nDALE Hey! \nWALT What? You know her? \nDALE Yeah. She's my girlfriend. \nDESMOND Whoa. You're that dude. You lucky fucker. \nDALE (proud) Yeah. She's pretty sweet. \nSAUL And we're all high, that's hilarious. \nBlake passes the joint to Dale. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Alright gentlemen, it's time for me to teach you some business. Brass tacs - this is the best weed you've ever smoked, agreed? \nThe kids all nod in agreement. \nSAUL (CONT'D) So I'm gonna make this simple. How much did you get between you? \nBLAKE A hundred and seventy eight. \nSaul pulls out his impressive bag of weed. The kids GASP. \nSAUL Alright. You gimme all your money, you can each take two handfuls of weed. That treat ya right? \nThe kids cheer as Desmond takes two BIG handfuls. \nDESMOND That's fucking awesome! \nSAUL I know. Keep it on the down low. \nThey pay Dale and take their weed. Happy as hell, they run off, stuffing HANDFULS OF WEED into their pockets. \nACK (to Walt) Jason'll never believe this...until I show him all this weed! \nDale holds the un-lit joint as Saul takes the pot and the money. \nSAUL And we, my good man, are officially scott fuckin' free. \nDALE There are still people trying to kill us. \nSAUL But at least now we can afford to run. I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks. Let's have us a little mardi-gras fiesta. \nSaul laughs as he puts on his backpack and walks around the corner. Dale re-lights the remaining roach and casually smokes. He blows some smoke rings, coughs a bit, stretches; for a few moments, looking completely relaxed, but then- \nA COP CAR screeches to a halt right in front of Dale! A female POLICE LIAISON OFFICER (who is not Carol) gets out of the car. Dale freezes in horror. \nPOLICE LIAISON Don't move! \nShe walks towards Dale. He seems prepared to run, but she places her hand on a can of pepper spray. \nPOLICE LIAISON (CONT'D) Don't move! This stuff hurts. What's in your hand? \nDALE. I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's weed. I'll get rid of it right away, I was just smoking this. I...I thought it was decriminalized. Or something. For medical purposes. I have epilepsy. \nPOLICE LIAISON Selling pot to my students isn't \"decriminalized.\" I'm the liaison officer for this school and I just caught four students showing off handfuls of marijuana to their friends. They told me they got it back here. Put your hands up. \nShe cuffs Dale's hands behind him! \nDALE Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I have is this little joint. \nPolice Liaison takes the large joint out of Dale's hand. \nPOLICE LIAISON You call this little? \nShe throws it on the ground and smears it around with her foot. \nDALE I don't even have any money! How did I sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I was just smoking it. I swear. Please. \nShe pats him down, finding only his wallet. The Police Liaison sees he only has nine dollars. She pulls out his DRIVER'S LICENSE. \nPOLICE LIAISON It's possible you're telling the truth. I'm going to run a check and if it turns out you don't have any priors and all you've got is this small amount of marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine. Take a seat. \n", "test2_id": 457, "test3_input": "SAUL (pointing across the room) There's some dudes in here. I saw them when I got dragged down. And there's some kind of super-suit or something. \nDALE Were they armed? \nSAUL (whispering) I don't think so. \nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Dale and Saul both scramble along a row of weed planets as bullets ricochet all around them. They continue running and then stop. \nDALE I can't hear them. \nSaul spots an air vent in the middle of the room. \nSAUL You could boost me up! We'll sneak out. \nBLAM! BLAM! They are being shot at again. \nDALE Shoot back! \nSAUL Really? \nDALE YES! \nSaul hesitantly takes aim and pulls the trigger. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! \nDALE (CONT'D) Now run! \nThey run and turn several corners when Saul suddenly trips over a dead thug. \nSAUL                             DALE AH!!!                         WHOA!!! \nDALE (CONT'D) Nice. You got him. \nDale picks up the thug's machine gun. Suddenly, a thug appears behind Saul. \nTHUG 7 Lance? Holy fuck! You sons-of- \nDale shoots right over Saul's shoulder and nails the thug several times. \nDALE Holy shit. I killed him. \nSAUL About time you killed somebody. You're the one whose supposed to be saving me, and I`ve killed two bad guys already. \nSaul looks to the vent in the middle of the room. Dale looks at the pipe, sizes up Saul and himself, and takes a deep breath. \nDALE You'll never be able to pull me up, but I'll boost you up there and you just fucking run for it, man. \nSAUL What? No fucking way, Dale. What about you? \nDale cocks his gun. \nDALE Don't worry about me. \nSAUL Whoa. That was awesome. \nSaul tucks the gun in his belt and awkwardly climbs atop Dale's shoulders and tears the vent off. \nSAUL (CONT'D) You're a good man, Dale Denton. \nSaul lifts himself in. SUDDENLY, Dale sees Ted enter the room and immediately go for his gun. \nDALE Hold on! \nSAUL Wha- \nDale walks out from under Saul, raises his gun, and unloads - RATA-TAT-TAT!!! Ted ducks as the plants around him are torn asunder. Dale runs out of ammo. \nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Ted shoots at Saul, who narrowly avoids the gunfire as he pulls himself into the vent. Ted redirects his attention to Dale, who is running through the bushes. Ted blasts off a few shots before Dale vanishes into the foliage. \nTED Denton!!! \nINT. VENT - CONTINUOUS \nSaul wiggles his way through the vent. He turns a corner and- \nSAUL AHHH!!! \nThere is a skeleton wedged in the vent. A grate leading out is directly above the corpse. Saul squeamishly crawls over the skeleton. \nSAUL (CONT'D) Ew. Gross, man. A fuckin' dead guy. \nHe spots dog tags around it's neck as he crawls by. They read: Private Greg B. Miller. \n", "test3_true": "Thirty feet from the barn there is an air vent sticking out of the ground. The top flies off and Saul emerges. He flops onto the ground, then immediately scampers to his and pulls out his gun. Saul looks to the open road to freedom, then back at the barn. \nSAUL Fuck... \nINT. GIANT UNDERGROUND GROW ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDale frantically runs through the rows of plants, when SUDDENLY he sees the strange scuba suit out of the corner of his eye and swings his gun at it, nearly opening fire. \nDALE (whispering) Oh god. \nDale slows down to catch his breath, staring at the strange scuba suit. Then, he gets an idea. \nANGLE ON: Ted, quietly walking through the room \nTed raises his gun as he spins around a corner. \nTED Where are you, you son-of-a-bitch? \nTed turns another corner and sees the strange scuba suit. He starts to walk past it, when he stops himself. He creeps back and looks at it, suspicious. He walks closer, breathing as quietly as he can, his gun clenched tightly. He slowly reaches his hand out to lift the face-hatch. He gently takes hold of the latch and is about to open it, when- \nDale jumps out from behind him and swings a FIRE EXTINGUISHER at Ted's face - SLAM!!! Ted drops his gun as he falls to the floor. \nDALE Ha! \nTed leaps upwards and uppercuts Dale hard!!! \nEXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nSaul inches towards the barn, hearing a melee of gunfire and screams as he nears it. He cautiously peers in and watches as Carol shoots an assassin in the chest then spins around and shoots at another assassin who desperately runs with a METAL BRIEFCASE handcuffed to his wrist. Carol hits him several times; he lurches over and falls through the trap door. She smiles and drops her empty gun. \nSaul watches Carol as she heads towards the trap door. He takes a deep breath and CHARGES into the barn, unleashing a barrage of bullets at her! BLAM BLAM BLAM! CLICK. \nCLICK. CLICK. None of the bullets hit her. She turns and sees Saul, who drops his empty gun. \nSAUL Fuck tha po-lice. \nThey both SCREAM in rage and CHARGE, fists flying as they collide. Carol whips Saul around by his collar and hurls him to the ground. She runs up and kicks him in the gut, time and time again. \nCAROL I'm a fucking cop, you moron. \nSAUL AAAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHH!!! \nSaul leaps to his feet and PUNCHES Carol in the face. He PUNCHES her again. She reaches for her mace, so Saul kicks her in the groin and grabs it for himself, then sprays her in the face. \nSLAM! He punches her in the face. \nINT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS \nTed and Dale are squared off. Both are bloody lipped and bruised. Dale continuously shucks and jives on the spot as they talk. \nDALE You can't fucking take me. I'm young. Virile. Prime of my life. You're old. Old and dying. \nTED I don't know who you are, Denton, or why you're trying to ruin my life, but you're fuckin' dead! \nTed rips off his shirt, revealing dozens of fearsome tattoos and scars. Dale quickly picks a grow light up off the ground. Ted does the same. The humming of the grow lights is heard as the two men walk in a circle, squared off. \nTED (CONT'D)                      DALE AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!              AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!! \nThey both swing and their grow lights collide, sending shards of glass everywhere. \nBoth receive several small cuts. The immediately charge at each other and are soon grappling on the ground. \nINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nCarol writhes on the ground as Saul runs towards her with a plank of wood. SMASH! He shatters it over her head. Carol drops, unconscious. \nSaul drops to his knees, exhausted. \nSAUL Crazy  huff   huff , psycho bitch... \nMATHESON (O.S.) Hey Saul! \nSaul turns around to see Matheson clutching his bleeding gut with one hand and a loaded gun with the other. \nMATHESON (CONT'D) I owe you one. In the gut. Then the balls, and then the- \nCRASH!!! Red's car SMASHES through the side of the barn and SLAMS into Matheson, PULVERIZING him!!! \nIt lurches to a stop directly ON TOP OF THE HATCH leading underground. Red steps out of the car. \n", "test3_id": 458}

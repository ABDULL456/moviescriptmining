observing from a block south on the bridge sees the police assault, raises night-vision binoculars. 
YERO'S POV:  HE SEES CROCKETT + ISABELLA 
behind structures on the jetty.  Crockett fires with the MPD SWAT. 
INT. SUBURBAN - YERO 
pushes "send" on his satellite phone... 
CUT TO: 
INT. GUAJIRA PENINSULA COMPOUND, COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - ENCRYPTION 
The technicians are eating in the next room.  We hear the recording... 
YERO (in Spanish) Isabella.  The gringos are police. She's their informant...! 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBURBAN - YERO 
YERO Go! 
EXT. STREET + BRIDGE - YERO'S SUBURBAN 
pulls out, racing to get away from the firefight.  But BRIGHT LIGHT freezes it...heavy rounds slam into the engine, crack the block, stream sprays, it seizes up.  Suburban crashes into a car at the curb.  Yero bails out. 
EXT. SKY - HELICOPTER - TUBBS 
half out of his seat, a Galil in full auto on his shoulder, hovering above Yero and the Suburban. 
PA (loud hailer) Freeze!  You're under arrest.  Down on your knees.  Put your hands on your head... 
CLOSE:  YERO 
does none of that.  Enraged, he pulls up a 9mm H+K SMG to fire up at the helicopter 
ON TUBBS 
aiming down at CAM.  The assault rifle unloads in three-shot bursts. 
OVER TUBBS DOWN TO YERO IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT 
The pavement, the car and Yero are cratered by the 7.62mm rounds.  Yero goes down.  Dead. 
EXT. STREET - WIDE:  HELICOPTER 
lands.  Tubbs bails, grabbing his duffle bag and the rifle and turns down the street towards the firefight and Crockett... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JETTY - CROCKETT 
holding Isabella down, FIRES past a Toyota.  It's turned into a sieve.  He tells Isabella to stay behind the engine block. Then he ASSAULTS the ambush. 
SWITEK 
is shot in the calf, spins, goes down, gets up, limps to cover, keeps firing. 
EXT. SCRAP FREIGHTER - COLEMAN 
...taking and returning FIRE from Crockett and Zito and from his left flank from the SWAT team on the bridge...knows every moment more he's here, more MPD assets are coming in.  He wants to finish it faster. 
LOW + WIDE:  COLEMAN 
bails off the freighter onto the dock.  DARK-HAIRED ARYAN BROTHER with a full auto AK is with him.  They move from cover to cover, their heavy Kevlar body armor absorbing rounds.  And they attack Crockett and Zito, who are outgunned. 
CROCKETT + ZITO 
run for cover, fire three-shot bursts, run and cover.  But... 
ISABELLA 
runs from cover into the clear with her handgun firing at the crazy whites, furious at the betrayal by Yero.  She's shouting in Spanish.  It's insane.

TERESA'S TRAILER \nDesmond notices a picture hanging on the wall.  Takes the picture down and looks at it thru his magnifying glass. (more) \nINSERT - PICTURE \nTeresa Banks is wearing a ring. \nBACK ON THE SCENE \nStanley returns with his equipment.  Desmond shows him the photograph. \nDESMOND Take a look at this. \nSTANLEY She's wearing a ring. \nStanley studies it. \nDESMOND My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway. \nSTANLEY (squinting at the picture) May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond? (takes a look, then looks at Desmond) There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring. \nCarl leans in from the outside. \nCARL I'm gonna make myself some Good Morning America.  You want some? \nBoth nod \"yes\". \nDISSOLVE TO: \n27.     INT.  TERESA'S TRAILER - LATER \nStanley is finishing up his work.  Carl brings them their coffee. Desmond tastes the coffee under Sam's watchful eye. \nDESMOND You weren't kiddin'.  This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend. \nCARL That's right.  That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here. \nSTANLEY (watching Desmond drink) We really do need a good \"wake me up\", don't we, Agent Desmond? (after a long look from Desmond) We really do need a good \"wake me up\", don't we, Agent Desmond? \nA WOMAN sticks her head into the trailer.  She has an ice pack over one eye and a load of idle curiosity.  Desmond notices her. \nDESMOND Did you know Teresa Banks? \nShe just nods in the negative and leans back out.  Behind her is Deputy Cliff, who looks into the trailer. \nCLIFF Hey, how's J. Edgar doin'? (to Carl) Bet you appreciate them bustin' your mornin' in half, eh, Carl?  Bet they woke you up. \nCARL They're only doing their job. \nDESMOND What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy? \nCLIFF Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that? \nDESMOND Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered? \nCLIFF You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses. \nCARL Maybe if you did a little less partyin' that little girl would still be alive. \nCLIFF Is that right, Mr. Jack Daniels? \nDESMOND Did you know Teresa Banks? \nCLIFF Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her.  That's it.  By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman?  I could ask you the same question. \nDESMOND No you couldn't. \nChet steps towards Cliff who looses his balance and has to step off the trailer steps. \n28.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - SAME \nDesmond stands in the doorway of the trailer and watches Cliff get into his car and drive to work. \nStepping away from the trailer Desmond spots something underneath. He bends down and retrieves a Titleist Golf Ball. \nDESMOND Is there a golf course around here? \nCARL Not a lot around here, no.  Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls. \nDesmond drops the ball in a plastic bag and gives it to Stanley who puts it in his kit.  Desmond turns to Carl. \nDESMOND Thanks for your help, Carl.  Sorry we woke you up. \nCARL That's alright.  I was having a bad dream.  I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline. \nDesmond and Stanley nod to Carl and walk to their car. \nSTANLEY I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer.  You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond? \nDESMOND He's not the murderer. (after a beat) But he's a bozo. \n", "test1_true": "Desmond walks around the car to the drivers' side and gets in. \n29.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - MIDDAY \nThe FBI MOBILE CRIME VAN sits outside as Desmond and Stanley pull up. \n30.     INT.  WAITING ROOM, SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY \nCable and Cliff meet Desmond and Stanley as they come in the door. The CRIME VAN DRIVER sits nearby.  The secretary is behind her desk. \nCABLE What the hell is that thing doing out there?  You're not taking that body anywhere. \nDESMOND We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it. \nCABLE Maybe not _a_ thing, but maybe _two_ things. \nDESMOND Teresa Banks had a ring.  Any idea what happened to it? \nCABLE We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring. \nDESMOND (turning to Stanley) Sam, get the body and put it in the van. (to Cable) Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered? \nCABLE (flexing the muscles in his arm) My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel. \nHe reaches out and stops Stanley from going out to get the body. Cable smiles menacingly at Desmond. \nCABLE (continued) Cliff told me you asked him the same thing.  Why don't we step around back and we'll have our final \"discussion\" out doors. \nCable exits followed by Cliff and the giggling secretary. \nSTANLEY (coming close to Desmond) When he says, \"Discussion\", how do you take that, Agent Desmond? \nDESMOND I don't take it, Sam.  I give it. \n31.     EXT.  BEHIND THE SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY \nDesmond, Cliff, Stanley, Cable, the secretary and the FBI van driver all have stepped outside by the pile of iron bars. \nCABLE Now, J. Edgar, I'm going to take off my badge, here.  Do you mind? (takes his badge off) The only way you're going to get that body is over mine. \nHe picks up a steel bar and bends it ala the picture in his office. \nCLIFF (to Desmond) You try that you little monkey. \nDESMOND I think I'll take off my badge as well. \nDesmond takes his coat and badge off.  Cable takes his shirt off and Desmond follows.  Cable is bare-chested and Desmond is in FBI issue underwear. \nDesmond goes to pick up an iron bar and Cable hits him with a sucker punch.  As Desmond bends away from this Cable rushes at him.  Desmond stops him with a few well placed punches to his face.  Cable falls down and Desmond stands over him.  Chet picks up the steel bar and bends it.  He then tosses the bar away. \nCable stands up and rushes at Desmond who flips and flops him around. Cable tries one more grand roadhouse punch which Desmond expertly ducks. \nDESMOND (eyeing Cable's glass jaw) This one's comin' from J. Edgar. \nDesmond blasts him in the jaw and Cable goes over - lights out, all systems down. \nThe no longer giggling secretary and Cliff stand and stare.  Desmond looks at them. \nDESMOND Who's next? \nAfter a moment of unbearable humiliation they shuffle away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n32.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - AFTERNOON \nStanley and the driver finish loading the body into the van.  Desmond and Stanley talk. \nDESMOND Take the van back to Portland, Stanley. I'm going to take one more look at the trailer park. \nThey walk towards the van until Stanley stops. \nSTANLEY (confidentially) One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner.  Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring? \nDESMOND Faulty wiring. \nSTANLEY Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond? (extends his hand) I'm Sam Stanley.  If you ever need me. \nDESMOND Thanks, Sam, for the good work.  You have a good eye for detail. \nSTANLEY We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond?  Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose? \nDesmond smiles at Stanley as they shake. \nDESMOND'S POV \nAs he enters the van, Desmond can barely make out what Stanley says as he points to the driver. \nSTANLEY (very muffled) 83,000 dollars. \n33.     EXT.  THE TRAILER COURT - DAY \nDesmond is standing in front of Teresa's trailer with Carl Rodd. \nCARL (motioning behind and to the right of Teresa's trailer) And that's Deputy Cliff's trailer over there.  The red one. \nCHET Right. \nCARL I'll be in my trailer if you need me. \nCarl walks away towards his trailer.  Desmond walks over and around Cliff's red trailer.  He gets a strange feeling.  He looks past Teresa's trailer to the edge of the trailer park, where he sees a HAND appear in the window of a trailer.  Then the hand disappears. \nDesmond walks to that trailer.  He knocks on the door but no one answers.  He looks under the trailer and sees a _mound_of_dirt_with_ _a_small_indentation_at_the_top_.  In the indentation is _Teresa_ _Bank's_ring_.

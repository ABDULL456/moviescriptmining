HIGHWAY, FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA - DAY \nA school bus.  TWO very buxom PROSTITUTES are being handcuffed by a plain clothes special agent, CHESTER DESMOND.  Another AGENT has his gun to the spread eagled BUS DRIVER's head.  The KIDS inside the bus are screaming.  The phone inside Chester Desmond's car starts to ring.  Desmond walks to the car. \n5.      INT.  DESMOND'S CAR - DAY \nDesmond picks up the ringing phone. \nDESMOND \nYes... \nINTERCUT WITH: COLE \nCOLE CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND...  OREGON. \nDESMOND OK, Gordon. \nCOLE NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE.  OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON.  I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET. \nDESMOND (little louder) OK, Gordon. \nCOLE OREGON.  A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED.  SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS. \nDESMOND (very loud) Okay, Gordon!!! \nDesmond electronically lowers the aerial adjusting the volume. \nCOLE GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.  BETTER BRING A POLE. \nDESMOND Smell something fishy, huh? \nCOLE I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU.  ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT. \n6.      EXT.  SMALL AIRPORT OUTSIDE OF PORTLAND - DAY \nSmall government plane lands. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nDesmond exits the plane. \n7.      INT.  SECURITY LOUNGE OF THE AIRPORT - SAME \nDesmond enters.  Cole and another man, SAM STANLEY, walk towards him. \nCOLE (motioning to the man standing there) CHET, GIVE SAM STANLEY THE GLAD HAND.  HE'S COME OVER FROM SPOKANE. \nDesmond and Stanley shake. \nSTANLEY It's a pleasure.  I've heard a lot about you. \nCOLE SAM'S THE MAN WHO CRACKED THE WHITEMAN CASE. \nDESMOND Congratulations.  I heard about that. \nCOLE (plowing ahead) YOUR SURPRISE, CHET.  HER NAME IS LIL. \nLIL walks to them from another room.  She goes into a contorted dance. \nStanley rides along quietly for a while. \nSTANLEY What did Gordon's tie mean? \nDESMOND What?  That's just Gordon's bad taste. \nSTANLEY Why couldn't he have just told you all these things? \nDESMOND He talks loud.  And he loves his code. \nSTANLEY I see.  He does talk loud. \nDESMOND Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation. \nSTANLEY It must be a high priority situation. \n12.     EXT.  HIGHWAY - SAME \nDesmond's car drives off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n13.     EXT.  DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION - AFTERNOON \nDesmond and Stanley arrive.  The Sheriff's Station is in a sorry state outside...  They walk up to the old steps and enter. \n14.     INT.  DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nAgent Desmond and Stanley walk into a very small reception area.  At the counter Desmond shows his badge to CLIFF HOWARD, the Deputy. \nDESMOND Good afternoon, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond.  I'd like to see Sheriff Cable. \nCliff just smiles for a long minute. \nCLIFF Why don't you folks have a seat.  Make yourself at home.  It's gonna be a while. \nDesmond stays standing and Stanley sits.  After another long moment, Cliff joins the SECRETARY in a conspiratorial giggle over the long wait they are planning to give the FBI.  In the middle of a giggle Cliff smiles up at Desmond. \nCLIFF (continued) Why don't you have some of that coffee. It was fresh two days ago. \nCliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary pretending to look at some paper work.  They both laugh. \nDESMOND Okay, that's it.  I've had enough of the waiting room now. \nCLIFF (still smiling) Oh. \nDesmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to Sheriff Cable's office. \nCliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to do something.  While they stare eye to eye, Desmond's hand goes up slowly towards Cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way.  Cliff tries to knock Chet's hand away.  Chet counters by grabbing Cliff's nose and pinches a nerve to its side injecting Cliff with a great amount of pain. \nCLIFF (continued) AAAHHHHHHHH... \nDesmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of the office and then still pressing the nerve guides Cliff down into a chair. \nWhile the Deputy's eyes tear copiously Desmond turns to the secretary. \nDESMOND You can start that FRESH pot of coffee right now. \nDesmond stalks to Sheriff Cable's office.  Stanley remains behind continuing to observe every detail. \n15.     INT.  SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY \nSHERIFF CABLE looks up from his work. \nCABLE How the hell did you... \nDesmond shows his credentials. \nDESMOND Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. \nCliff, still holding his nose, appears just behind Desmond, who turns to him. \nDESMOND (continued) That's all right, Deputy, Sheriff Cable can take it from here \nCable signals Cliff to leave. \nDESMOND (continued) I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks. \nCABLE Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here.  I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods.  In fact, when the state boys called me about a \"J. Edgar\" coming up I think I said, \"So what?\" \nDESMOND Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government. \nCABLE You're lucky I am not wasting you. \nDESMOND Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be \"Federal\".  With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased. \nCable retrieves a box with the paper work and some personal effects. He throws it to Desmond. \nCABLE A basic kill.  Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her.  My boys have been all over this.  It's a dead end. \nDESMOND That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body? \nCABLE Out back in our morgue \nDesmond starts to leave. \nCABLE (continued) It's 4:30.  We close at five. \nDESMOND We've got our own clock.  We'll lock up. \nAs Desmond turns to leave he notices on the wall a framed Newspaper clipping with picture. \nThe caption reads: \n\"CABLE BENDS STEEL\" \nDESMOND We're not.  You and I are going to get some food. \nSTANLEY Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten.  I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond? \nDesmond takes a long look at Stanley. \nSTANLEY (continued) You've got your own M.O., don't you, Agent Desmond? \nDesmond gets in and starts the car. \n19.     EXT.  HAP'S DINER - LATE NIGHT \nEstablish. \n20.     INT.  HAP'S DINER, MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT \nDesmond and Stanley talk with JACK, the manager who has black wavy hair with a black full mustache to match, shiny silk shirt with silver strands sown in and an Indian turquoise belt.  He has a sign on his shirt that says, \"Say 'Goodbye' to JACK\". \nA GUY in the room is working on a light that keeps buzzing and shorting out.  He doesn't really know what he's doing so he is poking at the wiring. \nJACK Had the FBI here once before.  Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place. \nDESMOND Where's Hap? \nJACK He's dead - good and dead. \nDESMOND Sorry to hear it. \nJACK He didn't suffer. \nDESMOND I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks \nJACK Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks.  She worked nights for a month.  That's it. \nDESMOND Any friends? \nJACK No. \nDESMOND Ever see her with someone else? \nJACK No. \nDESMOND Did she ever mention any friends? \nJACK No. (pointing) Ask Irene over there. \nHe gestures thru a door that leads out to the diner, pointing out a woman behind the counter. \nJACK (continued) Now, her name _is_ Irene and it _is_ night. Don't take it any further than that. There's nothin' good about it. \n21.     INT.  HAP'S DINER - SAME \nThey sit at the counter and IRENE comes over to them.  Behind her is the coffee and she is working on a cigarette.  Lipstick smeared on the coffee cup. \nIRENE Take a good look around.  There's nobody in this place - you're meetin' the reason why.  What'll it be? \nDESMOND How come Jack let's you work here? \nIRENE Jack and I are united in holy matrimony. \nDESMOND Say no more. \nStanley is casing the restaurant as Irene pours them a couple of cups of coffee. \nDESMOND (showing credentials) Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond.  I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her.  How well? \nIRENE She only worked here a month.  Nice girl.  Never seemed to get here on time though.  Ask me she had a little problem with -- \nShe makes a sniff to indicate a \"cocaine problem\". \nIRENE (continued) Came looking for a job with a friend of hers.  Pretty girl.  Could've been her sister. \nDESMOND What happened to her? \nIRENE There was only one job.  Teresa took the job.  Her friend took a hike.  Never saw her again. \nDESMOND Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine? \nIRENE No. \nDESMOND Do you take cocaine, Irene? \nIRENE No, I do not.  I never took cocaine or any other drugs.  I don't take drugs. \nSTANLEY Nicotine is a drug.  Caffeine is a drug. \nIRENE Who's Shorty?  Those drugs are legal. \nDESMOND He's with me. (back on the track) Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out? \nIRENE I've thought about that.  I think her death is what you would call a \"freak accident\". \nDESMOND Thanks. \nAn OLD GUY, long and skinny, smoking, gets Desmond's attention. \nOLD GUY You talking about that little girl that was murdered? \nDESMOND You have something to tell us? \nOLD GUY Yeah. \nDESMOND What? \nOLD GUY I can tell shit from shinolah.  Gets me along way down that road. \nDESMOND She must have known someone. \nDesmond notices her personal effects on the dresser, but no ring. \nDESMOND (continued) You better dust this place, Sam. \nSTANLEY I'll get my kit. \n25.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT \nStanley walks towards the car.  He writes in his note book. \nSTANLEY (to himself) 5,600 dollars. \n26.     INT.  TERESA'S TRAILER \nDesmond notices a picture hanging on the wall.  Takes the picture down and looks at it thru his magnifying glass. (more) \nINSERT - PICTURE \nTeresa Banks is wearing a ring. \nBACK ON THE SCENE \nStanley returns with his equipment.  Desmond shows him the photograph. \nDESMOND Take a look at this. \nSTANLEY She's wearing a ring. \nStanley studies it. \nDESMOND My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway. \nSTANLEY (squinting at the picture) May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond? (takes a look, then looks at Desmond) There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring. \nCarl leans in from the outside. \nCARL I'm gonna make myself some Good Morning America.  You want some? \nBoth nod \"yes\". \nDISSOLVE TO: \n27.     INT.  TERESA'S TRAILER - LATER \nStanley is finishing up his work.  Carl brings them their coffee. Desmond tastes the coffee under Sam's watchful eye. \nDESMOND You weren't kiddin'.  This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend. \nCARL That's right.  That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here. \nSTANLEY (watching Desmond drink) We really do need a good \"wake me up\", don't we, Agent Desmond? (after a long look from Desmond) We really do need a good \"wake me up\", don't we, Agent Desmond? \nA WOMAN sticks her head into the trailer.  She has an ice pack over one eye and a load of idle curiosity.  Desmond notices her. \nDESMOND Did you know Teresa Banks? \nShe just nods in the negative and leans back out.  Behind her is Deputy Cliff, who looks into the trailer. \nCLIFF Hey, how's J. Edgar doin'? (to Carl) Bet you appreciate them bustin' your mornin' in half, eh, Carl?  Bet they woke you up. \nCARL They're only doing their job. \nDESMOND What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy? \nCLIFF Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that? \nDESMOND Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered? \nCLIFF You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses. \nCARL Maybe if you did a little less partyin' that little girl would still be alive. \nCLIFF Is that right, Mr. Jack Daniels? \nDESMOND Did you know Teresa Banks? \nCLIFF Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her.  That's it.  By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman?  I could ask you the same question. \nDESMOND No you couldn't. \nChet steps towards Cliff who looses his balance and has to step off the trailer steps. \n28.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - SAME \nDesmond stands in the doorway of the trailer and watches Cliff get into his car and drive to work. \nStepping away from the trailer Desmond spots something underneath. He bends down and retrieves a Titleist Golf Ball. \nDESMOND Is there a golf course around here? \nCARL Not a lot around here, no.  Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls. \nDesmond drops the ball in a plastic bag and gives it to Stanley who puts it in his kit.  Desmond turns to Carl. \nDESMOND Thanks for your help, Carl.  Sorry we woke you up. \nCARL That's alright.  I was having a bad dream.  I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline. \nDesmond and Stanley nod to Carl and walk to their car. \nSTANLEY I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer.  You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond? \nDESMOND He's not the murderer. (after a beat) But he's a bozo. \n34.     INT. GORDON COLE'S OFFICE, PHILADELPHIA - DAY \nCole and ALBERT ROSENFIELD talk. \nCOLE EVERY SYLLABLE OF EVERY WORD IS THE SOUND OF TWO HANDS CLAPPING.  IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID, ALBERT? \nALBERT Six to eight hands clapping.  I was referring to the possibility of a little silence. \nThe phone rings and Cole answers it. \n35.     INT.  PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICES \nAGENT DALE COOPER, in the doorway across the hall, talks to DIANE in the next room.  While he talks he does some isometrics against the door frame. \nCOOPER I know you haven't changed your hair and I've seen that beautiful dress before, but I must say, Diane, you look sensational today. \nDiane says something else that we cannot hear. \nCOOPER (enjoying this) No, I am not trying to buy time.  It's Thursday and I know you have changed something in the room...  and this time you've done very well... (stalling) And I am going to tell you exactly what it is...  in a moment...  you have moved... (snaps his fingers) Got it!  It's the clock, you've moved it 12 inches to the left. (a laugh) Another triumph for the dashing Agent Cooper.  And you, Diane, now have to clean the coffee cup, get fresh ground coffee from Sally and make a damn great pot of coffee. \nCooper with a triumphant smile walks over to join Cole and Albert. But Cole's stern look takes his smile away. \nCOOPER What is it, Gordon? \nCOLE COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED.  GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW. \n36.     INT.  SAM STANLEY'S APARTMENT, SPOKANE - DAY \nAll around the walls of Stanley's apartment are work benches with adding machinery sitting on top of them.  In the middle of the room is a portable plastic pool, with milky white water and crystallized salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks.  From one odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend into the pool. \nCooper's eyes go to the pool and back to Stanley as Sam talks about Desmond. \nSTANLEY Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time.  He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did.  It was 105 miles. \nCOOPER Anything else? \nSTANLEY Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil? \nCOOPER I'm up to speed, Stanley. \nSTANLEY Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant. \nCOOPER And neither will I. \nSTANLEY (understanding) Oh, alright. (reflecting) You know, I liked Agent Desmond.  He had his own M.O. \nStanley turns to one of his work tables and shows Cooper the Whiteman machine. \nSTANLEY I cracked the Whiteman case with this. \nCOOPER (trying to stop him) Stanley, I heard all about it. \nSTANLEY No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this. \nCOOPER Tell me about the letter. \nSTANLEY Take a look at this.  Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail. \nCooper looks under the microscope to see the letter they found on Teresa. \nCOOPER And no one found the ring? \nSTANLEY No, sir, we did not. \nCooper straightens up from the microscope.  Stanley extends his hand. \nSTANLEY I'm Sam Stanley, if you ever need me. \n37.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAY \nCarl Rodd shows Cooper to Teresa's trailer. \nCARL GOD.  I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system.  Don't you folks talk to one another.  That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing.  Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer (gestures to the red trailer) ...which I showed him.  I went back to my trailer... (gestures back to his) After that I never saw him again. \nCOOPER Thank you, Carl. \nCooper starts walking in the opposite direction from Cliff's trailer picking up on the same odd vibe that struck Desmond. \nCARL (turning back) That's not the way to Cliff's trailer.  I told you. \nCOOPER I am not going to Cliff's trailer. \nCARL Well, where are you going? \nCOOPER I am going over here. \nCARL (coming along with him) God damn, you people are confusing. \nCooper reaches a pack of dirt which is now creased with tire tracks. \nCOOPER What was here, Mr. Rodd? \nCARL A trailer was here.  What the hell do you think? \nCOOPER Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer? \nCARL An old woman and her grandson. \nCOOPER Can you tell me what their names were? \nCARL Chalfont.  Weird.  Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did.  Two Chalfonts. \nCooper kneels to examine the tracks left by the exited trailer. As he kneels and inspects the tracks he is overcome by the presence of SOMETHING. \nCooper struggles to his feet and looks around.  Under a tree and close to the tracks is a car. \nAlbert stands up. \nALBERT Phillip? \nJeffries moves into the room.  Cooper steps into the office. \nCOOPER Phillip? \nCOLE COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES.  YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY. \nJeffries stares at the threesome. \nJEFFRIES I'm not going to talk about Judy.  Keep Judy out of this. \nCOOPER But... \nCole calms Cooper. \nCOLE STAND FAST, COOP. \nJEFFRIES (pointing at Cooper) Who do you think that is there? \nALBERT (trying to calm Jeffries) Suffered some bumps on the old noggin', eh, Phil? \nCOLE WHAT THE HELL DID HE SAY? (pointing at Cooper) THAT'S SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER. (focusing on Jeffries) ARE YOU OKAY, JEFFRIES?  WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? \nJEFFRIES I want to tell you everything, but I don't have a lot to go on.  But I'll tell you one thing:  Judy is positive about this. \nALBERT How interesting.  I thought we were going to keep Judy out of this. \nJeffries stumbles to a chair. \nJEFFRIES Listen to me carefully.  I saw one of their meetings.  It was above a convenience store. \nALBERT Who's meeting?  Where have you been? \nCOLE FOR GOD SAKES, JEFFRIES, YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR DAMN NEAR TWO YEARS. \nJEFFRIES It was a dream. (takes Albert by the arm) We live inside a dream. \nALBERT And it's raining Post Toasties. \nJEFFRIES (shouting) NO, NO.  I found something...  in Seattle at Judy's...  And then, there they were... \nAlbert is about to say something, but is stopped by Cole's gentle pressure on his arm. \nJEFFRIES They sat quietly for hours. \n53.     INT.  ROOM ABOVE THE CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY \nSIX PEOPLE in a large, barren, filthy room.  Cheap plastic storm windows flap in the cold wind.  In the foreground the Man From Another Place (Mike) and BOB sit at a formica table.  Behind them on plastic torn chairs huddle MRS. TREMOND and her GRANDSON.

BACK IN THE FBI OFFICE \nJEFFRIES I followed. \nJeffries begins to cry quietly at his table. \nJEFFRIES (to himself) The ring...  ring... \nCOLE (hinting) ALBERT, I'LL TAKE THAT SECOND MINERAL WATER. \nDONNA (a pal) Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week.  You remember the... \nLAURA Don't tell me now.  Tell me right before the test.  I won't be able to remember long enough. \nDONNA You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen. \nLAURA Thanks. \nLaura tweaks Donna's cheek. \nDONNA James called me last night looking for you. \nLAURA When? \nDONNA The usual, 9:15. \nLAURA He probably wanted to drive over. \nDONNA Were you with Bobby?  Or are you two still fighting? \nLAURA No, and yes.  I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby.  I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him. \nDONNA Are you going to tell him about that \"someone else\"? \nLAURA I don't know what to do. \nDONNA You know what your problem is? (smiles) You're just too adorable... \nLAURA (smiles back) You know, I think you're right.  I'm just too adorable. \nDonna grabs her and shakes her shoulders. \nDONNA (sing-song) Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable. \nLAURA (joining her - laughing) I'm just too adorable.

A cool MIKE NELSON snaps his fingers ala Bobby for Donna to come to him.  Without missing a beat Donna changes directions.  Mike has to hustle to catch up with her. \nMIKE (putting his arm around Donna) That's why you need a real man, Babe, you're tough to handle. \nDONNA And you're the real man? \n61.     INT.  OUTSIDE THE GIRL'S BATHROOM \nJAMES HURLEY moves up behind Laura and pushes close to her. \nLAURA James... \nJAMES Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed. \nLAURA Okay. \nJames smiles and walks off.

It does. \nLAURA No, it doesn't...  just kiss me. \nJAMES It does matter.  We're in love. \nLAURA James, you don't know what you are talking about.  Quit trying to hold on so tight.  I'm gone...  long gone like a turkey through the corn. \nJAMES You're not a turkey.  A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth. \nLAURA (small smile) Gobble, gobble, gobble. \n71.     INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - DAY \nLaura comes into her room and drops her books on her bed.  She goes to the window and opens it - takes a package of cigarettes out, pulls one out and lights it. \nShe goes to her \"public\" diary which she keeps on her desk.  Opens it to page one takes out a packet full of cocaine.  Like a pro she takes out her \"cocaine gadget\" from her purse and takes a snort.  Then another.  Big sigh of relief. \nNow she moves to her \"private\" diary behind her dresser - gets a pen, ready to write and starts to freak out.  Pages are missing.

He's been \"having\" me since I was 12. \nStunned, Harold doesn't know what to do. \nLAURA (continued) The diary was hidden too well.  He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now.  He's real He speaks to me. \nHAROLD What does Bob say? \nLAURA (whisper) He wants to be me...  or he will kill me. \nHAROLD No...  No... \nLAURA (strangely) Oh, yes...  yes... \nLaura starts towards him frightening Harold. \nHAROLD What?  Please. \nShe allows the feeling of Bob to come over her and she begins to scream.  Harold steps back, but Laura grabs him.  To his face with a horrifying expression on hers. \nLAURA FIRE WALK WITH ME. \nShe buries herself on his shoulder. \nLAURA (whispers) The trees...  the trees... \nThey break. \nLAURA (continued) You have to hide the diary, Harold.  You made me write it all down.  He doesn't know about you.  You'll be safe. \nShe stares at Harold.  Her eyes widen, terrified with suspicion. \nLAURA You're not Bob are you, Harold?  If you are, you can kill me right now.  Kill me right now, if you are. \nHAROLD Laura, no, I'm not.  I'm not Bob. (begins to shake and cry) Poor Laura.  I wish I could help you. \nHe holds her. \n82.     INT.  TRUCK - SAME \nThe TRUCKER smiles.  Eager. \nTRUCKER Friend of Leo's, right?  Partyland? \nLaura begins to unbutton her blouse.  Turns and sneaks a toot of cocaine. \nTRUCKER (continued) (catching her) Wait a minute.  Leo says this is my party. \nLaura puts her hand between his legs. \nLAURA If you can fuck and drive the party starts right now. \nMomentarily taken aback, the trucker stares at her.  Laura takes his hand and puts it on the gear shift. \nLAURA (continued) You shift that one.  This one's mine. \nShe climbs over on top of him. \n83.     EXT.  THE TRUCK - SAME \nThe stack blows.  The truck rolls away onto the road.  We watch it as it moans into the distance - the sound slowly diminishing and fading. \nNatures' nighttime sounds take over.  Finally, we hear the _hooting_ _of_an_owl_. \n84.     EXT.  PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICE - DAY \nReestablish. \n85.     INT.  OFFICE - DAY \nAlbert and Cooper. \nALBERT Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads.  Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works? \nCOOPER The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association.  The world is a hologram, Albert. \nALBERT Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper? \nCOOPER Albert. \nALBERT You said, \"Teresa Banks\", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder? \nCOOPER Yes.  Either right now or right when I thought of it.  The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me.  Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it.  And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it. \nALBERT Let's test it for the record.  Will the next victim be a man or a woman? \nCOOPER A woman. \nALBERT What color hair will she have? \nCOOPER Blonde. \nALBERT Tell me some other things about her. \nCOOPER She's in high school.  She's sexually active.  She's on drugs.  She's crying out for some help. \nALBERT You're describing half the high school girls in America. (off Cooper's look) What is she doing right now? \nCOOPER (closing his eyes to see a mental picture) She is preparing a great abundance of food. \nAlbert lets go a small laugh of disbelief and shakes his head in exasperation. \n86.     EXT.  DOUBLE R DINER - AFTERNOON \nEstablish. \n87.     INT.  DOUBLE R DINER - AFTERNOON \nLaura comes out of the kitchen stacking some of her \"Meals on Wheels\" on the counter. \nOn screen it reads: \n\"FRIDAY - SIX DAYS BEFORE\" \nNORMA JENNINGS and SHELLY JOHNSON watch from the cash register. Shelly is ringing someone out, handing back their change. \nNORMA Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the \"Meals on Wheels\"? \nSHELLY I'm kind of busy, Norma. \nNORMA You're not busy, sweetheart, now go. \nWith a little squeeze of the hand and a gentle shove, Norma moves Shelly towards Laura who is at the end of the counter. \nThe door opens to the Diner and ED and NADINE HURLEY come in.  Nadine stops when she sees Norma. \nNADINE I changed my mind, I don't want any coffee, Eddie. \nNadine goes out.  As she walks past Ed he looks at Norma and makes a \"What can I do\" gesture. \nED Sorry, Norma. \nEd goes out. \nSHELLY AND LAURA \nShelly approaches sheepishly. \nSHELLY Can I give you a hand getting the dinners together? \nLAURA That's alright, Shelly.  I know you have better things to do. \nSHELLY (disregarding the jab) Norma asked me to give you a hand. \nLaura is coming apart, sobbing.  Behind her, on the sidewalk, a NEIGHBOR has noticed her. \nWOMAN Laura... \nA closer look reveals how upset Laura is. \nWOMAN What...  Laura are you all right? \nLaura turns away so the woman can't see her crying.  The woman takes a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass. \nLAURA (trying to hold it together) I...  lost my necklace...  it must have fallen. \nLaura mimes that she has found her gold half-heart necklace.  She pretends to be clasping her gold half-heart necklace which was already around her neck. \nLAURA (clumsily) Oh, here it is. \nWoman moves back to the sidewalk. \nWOMAN Well, I'm glad you found it, darling. \nSlowly, Laura stands and moves away - leaving Mrs. Tremond's picture on the grass under the tree. \n96.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE \nLaura stands in front of her house.  Terrified. \n97.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE - SAME \nNo Bob.  Listens to the house...  stands in the entrance way. \n98.

What's wrong? \nLAURA I just want a friend.  Just one friend for just one minute... \nDONNA Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life? \nLAURA Yes, that's what I want.  Thanks D. \nDONNA Okay, L. (looks into Laura's eyes, a step toward confronting something unspoken) I am your friend...  always.  But sometimes...  lately...  I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight. (off Laura's look) No, I am uptight.  I hate it...  I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't...  I mean...  I'm your friend no matter what way you are. \nLAURA You know, even when I think about your face I get happier. \nThey go in and sit down on the couch. \nDONNA Do you want to talk? \nLAURA No, I want to smoke. \nShe digs for a cigarette in her purse. \nDONNA I'm in a mess today, too. (takes a breath) I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think? \nLAURA (still looking for a cigarette) Donna, you are such a crack up.  You don't even like Mike.  Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight. \nDONNA This is about sex, not like. (yells to the kitchen) Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins. (to Laura) You want a muffin? \nLAURA If I can smoke it. \nDONNA You want a muffin? \nLAURA Donna, you are a muffin. \nThey hear DOC HAYWARD in the kitchen.  He walks in with a magician's handkerchief.  With a flourish he tries to pull something out of it. Instead he stands there empty handed. \nDOC The red rose.  Where is the red rose? (frustrated) You know the light at Sparkwood and 21?  It worked right there.  I just did it right there. \nLaura finds a cigarette finally and lights it. \nDOC (stands and stares at Laura smoking) Why is it that you can't smoke at your home and I'm a doctor and I don't allow smoking in my home and I let you smoke in my home? \nLAURA (smiling her killer smile) Because you love me so much. \nDOC I do love you, you little smoking whipper snapper. \nEileen Hayward brings out the muffins on her lap in her wheel chair. All four have muffins. \nEILEEN These muffins each have at least seven full huckleberries in them. \nLELAND How do you know what she doesn't like? \nA beat then a return to what is normal. \nSARAH Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner. \nLELAND Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands. \nLeland sits stoically.  Laura rises from the table. \n104.    INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nAs Laura washes her hands, she stares at her reflection.  Terrified. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n105.    INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM \nLAURA'S CLOCK \nIt says:  10:35. \n106.    INT.  LELAND AND SARAH'S BEDROOM \nSarah and Leland get ready for bed.  Leland stops, stands frozen for a moment, then begins to cry. \nSARAH What is it, Leland? \nLeland can barely speak. \nLELAND I can't remember the last time I told Laura that I loved her. \nSarah goes to Leland.  They embrace, tenderly, across the many years of their strained marriage. \nSARAH Well, honey, go in and tell her now. \n107.    INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM \nLaura stares at the hands of the clock.  With a start, she looks up. Her father is in her room.  He stands in the doorway. \nLELAND Laura, honey... \nHe moves to her and touches her face. \nLELAND (continued) I love you.  I love you so much. \nLaura can hardly speak.  She squeezes his hand. \nLELAND Goodnight, Princess. \nHe leaves the room.  Laura watches the door close.  She sits frozen for a moment, with a tear in her eye, then she remembers something. \nMRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE \nThe picture lies there in the night dew under the tree in the neighbor's yard. \n108.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE, OUTSIDE LAURA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLaura goes down the trellises and runs across the lawn. \n109.    EXT.  NEIGHBOR'S LAWN - NIGHT \nLaura hunts around the tree for the picture, finally finds it.  She runs back towards her house. \n110.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLaura climbs through the window and hangs the picture on a little hook on the wall and crawls into bed.  She turns off the light and stares at the picture in the dark. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n111.    INT.  LAURA PALMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nShe is asleep. \n112.    MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE \nWe hold on the picture.  As if by magic, we suddenly begin to move into the picture - into the room in the picture and thru the dark doorway in the room in the picture. \nOn the other side of the dark doorway there is another room. Mrs. Tremond is standing in that room.  She is beckoning us towards her and beyond her thru yet another doorway.  We move thru the second doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room. \nMrs. Tremond's grandson is standing in that room.  He is holding his hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary glass ball.  As we move towards the space between his hands a ring of fire appears there and we move thru that into... \n113.    INT.  RED ROOM \nThe MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE walks into the red room to a table. A ring lies upon the table. \nCOOPER ENTERS THE RED ROOM.  The Man From Another Place turns toward Cooper. \nMAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE Is it future?  Or is it past?...  Do you know who I am?...  I am the Arm...  And I sound like this... \nThe Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and makes an Indian Whooping sound. \nThe Man From Another Place picks up the ring and moves it very close to us.  We recognize it as Teresa Banks' ring.  The symbols on the ring are identical to the symbols of Owl Cave. \nCooper seems concerned. \nCOOPER (to camera) Don't take the ring...  Laura, don't take the ring. \nThe Man From Another Place moves the ring towards us till the ring fills the screen. \n114.    BACK IN LAURA'S ROOM \nLaura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise.  She tries to move her left arm, but it has fallen asleep.  She moves it with her right arm. \nSFX: THE NOISE \nLAURA Mom...  what are you wearing? \nSarah looks down.  She is wearing the sweater that she is looking for. \nSARAH My god, I am going to have another breakdown.  God, god. \nLAURA Mom, take it easy. \nLaura starts down the stairs towards her mother. \nSARAH No, no... this can't be happening. \nLaura holds her mother. \nLAURA Mom, you're not having a nervous breakdown. \nSarah pulls away from Laura and wanders into the living room.  Laura watches her go feeling helpless. \n119.    INT.  JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - DAY \nLEO JOHNSON is ragging on Shelly.  He is down on his hands and knees showing her how to scrub the floor. \nLEO Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is.  Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is. \nSHELLY Lay off the bennies, Leo. \nLEO (continuing his tirade) Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere.  To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface. (shouting) WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY. \nHe scrubs more. \nLEO (continued) That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, - HOW TO CLEAN.  It takes scrubbing, Shelly.  There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY. \nSHELLY As if I didn't know. \nLEO I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it. \nSHELLY Come off it, Leo.  I'm late for work... \nLEO What did you say? \nLeo goes over the top pulls Shelly down to the floor. \nLEO Shelly, I am not fooling around anymore. The first thing you've got to WORK on is a good attitude.  That's the key. Anybody will tell you that. \nGives her a good shot to the back of the head.  Shelly falls to the floor.  The phone rings.  Leo gets up to get the phone. \nLEO Don't even _think_ about going anywhere, Shelly.  I'm not finished with you. \nHe answers the phone. \nLEO What are you doing calling me here?... No way, you already owe me money... Five thousand, to be exact. \nLeo looks over at Shelly suspiciously.  (Did she hear him mention the five thousand?) \nSHELLY (silently mouthing it) Five Thousand??? \n120.    INT.  DOUBLE R - DAY \nBobby is calling from the pay phone at the diner.

(a warning) And you're not coming. \nDONNA Come on, Laura.  I'm your best friend. \nThey move back into the living room. \nLAURA (change of subject) Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike? \nDONNA Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink? \nLaura shoots her a look. \nDONNA Where are the Cookies? \nLAURA You mean Fred and Ginger? \nDonna starts making out with Buck. \n133.    EXT.  BORDER TRUCK STOP - NIGHT \nEstablish.  Tommy takes the car like a rocket into the parking lot and does a complete three sixty before rocking to a stop.  Several big rigs shadow the lot.  They all pop out of Buck's car sporting \"long necks\". \nLaura takes a hit of cocaine and looks up to see Donna watching. Buck circles Donna with his big arm and puts a toot under her nose. \nDONNA No. (turns to Laura) I don't need to take this to be you friend. \nLAURA YES YOU DO, DONNA.  What a downer you are!!! \nBUCK (pointing to skid marks behind a heat popping car) Hey, Tommy, Jacques beat us here. \nTOMMY Hold on, I'm chokin' the farm fed. \nTommy stands in the lot with his back to them, pissing. \n134.    INT.  BORDER TRUCK STOP - NIGHT \nThe front room is a bar and restaurant with about THREE PATRONS. Above the bar is a sign that reads: \nCAN - A - DO and U.S. OF FUCKIN' \"A\" \nThe BARTENDER presses a release underneath the counter that allows Laura to take her three friends thru a door over which a sign hangs announcing in red neon letters: \n\"PARTYLAND\" \n135.    INT.  PARTYLAND \nThe group enters a large room with the filthiest wall to wall carpet imaginable.  In the back corner is a small stage.  On it a three piece HELL-METAL BAND is building up toward oblivion.  The LEAD SINGER is dressed in a buffalo skin complete with at least half the buffalo head and horns.  He wears spray painted, day glow orange cowboy boots. \nSome HALF DRESSED GIRLS and COWBOYS are dancing to the band.  In darkened corners away from the stage other groups are racing the band to oblivion. \nLaura leans over to Donna noticing her shocked look. \nLAURA Don't expect a turkey dog in here. \nJacques Renault comes up to the group. \nJACQUES Hey, slow pokes, guess what?  There's no tomorrow. \nHe grabs Laura up and gives her a big, sloppy wet kiss. \nJACQUES Baby, you know why?  Cause it'll never get here. \nLAURA Hey, Jacques... \nJACQUES (slurred) No \"Jacques\".  I am the Great Went. \nLAURA (for Donna) I am The Muffin. \nJACQUES And what a muffin you have. \nThe two truckers laugh with Jacques.  He mimes a gun with his right hand and pointing it to his forehead pulls the trigger with a weak, slack cheeked puff sound. \nJACQUES (slurred) I am as blank as a fart. \nLaura winks at Buck as he SECRETLY drops a red depth charge into Donna's beer. \nLAURA Hey, Donna, chug-a-lug. \nAs the cowboys gather around and begin to chant, both Laura and Donna chug down their drinks.  They finish and Laura smiles and pushes Donna out onto the dance floor. \nThey start to dance expertly and smile at each other.  Soon Buck and Tommy cut in separating the two. \nBuck dances Laura over to ANOTHER of his buddies.  The two of them start to unbutton Laura's blouse as they dance. \nThe hell-metal band kicks into high gear.  In the pulsating red and black light Donna sees Laura now topless dancing and kissing with Buck and his friend.  Donna stops.  Jacques sweeps in. \nJACQUES Oh, Laura's friend.  I am \"The Great Went\". \nJacques holds her head in his huge hands. \nJACQUES (continued) There is no tomorrow. \nDONNA'S POV \nThe room starts to spin. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWE MOVE AROUND THRU THE EVENING \n136.    INT.  ROADHOUSE \nDONNA \nA completely stoned Donna is being dances around by Tommy, who is falling in love with her.  Through some dancing legs and feet she spots Laura's blouse on the floor.  Teetering she leans over, picks up the blouse, and ties it around her waist. \nRONETTE PULASKI, flying high, makes her way through the crowd to Laura.  They spot each other and give each other a hug. \nRONETTE You smell nice. \nLAURA Haven't seen you since I was thrown out of One Eyed Jacks. \nRONETTE (trying to focus on Laura) What else did we do together?  Oh, I remember... (tries to dance with Laura) Hey, you know what?  It's been a year. She's been dead a year...  she's been dead a year. \nJacques comes up to them. \nJACQUES The party twins.  My high school sandwich.  Let's put some meat inside... \nThe three of them move around together. \nRONETTE She's been dead a year. \nEnd of Flashback. \n151.

What people think? \nJOSIE I don't want to offend the customs of your country. \nTRUMAN Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country.  For instance, I don't eat fish eyes. \nJOSIE Fish eyes? \nTRUMAN Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye. \nJOSIE Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry? \nTRUMAN I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle.  He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat.  I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble.  His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver.  I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy.  They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling.  Splat!  It just stuck up there and spread out.  It was about the size of a half dollar.  And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes. \nHe plays the guitar for Josie.  Then stops. \nTRUMAN (continued) I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel.  It's the custom thing I was thinking of.  In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides.

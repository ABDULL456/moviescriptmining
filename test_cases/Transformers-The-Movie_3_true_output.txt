WHEELIE (folds arms across his chest) Wheelie say, find friends today! (nods defiantly) Grimlock and Slag react as we 
CUT TO: 
THE QUINTESSON "COURTROOM" 
Kup and Hot Rod stand on the platform over the Sharkticon pit. They are "bound" by restraining bolts. 
ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON JUDGE 
QUINTESSON JUDGE Before we deliver your verdict, would you like to beg for your lives? 
ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD 
Kup turns to Hot Rod. 
KUP Remember when you put me together today? 
HOT ROD (sarcastic) Sure, that's all I got to think about. 
KUP I know what part you forgot. 
QUINTESSON JUDGE (V.O.) Silence or I'll hold you in contempt of this court. 
HOT ROD I have nothing but contempt for this court. 
ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON JUDGES 
Suddenly, their heads swivel around to deaths heads. 
ON KUP AND HOT ROD 
The platform drops away and they tumble... 
KUP AND HOT ROD - TRACKING 
Suddenly, Kup in double-jointed fashion slips out of the restraining bolt...

CONTINUED: 
KUP That doohickey you lost was part of my shoulder socket. Watch this, lad... without it, I'm double jointed as Houdini. 
Then, he transforms to humanoid mode and shoots off Hot Rod's bolt. 
HOT ROD Wish you'd figured that out a little sooner. 
KUP Better late than never! 
ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT 
In full humanoid mode, they land, their weapons drawn. 
ANGLE ON ALL 
Kup and Hot Rod fire, driving some Sharkticons back. 
HOT ROD They've got more Sharkticons than we have photon charges! 
Kup transforms to Auto mode. 
KUP Let's hold a demolition derby! Then, he roars into a bunch of them, slamming a massive stack into the wall. 
ANGLE ON HOT ROD 
He transforms, too and does the same thing. 
ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT 
As fast as the Autobots can run the miserable things over, new swarms of them come out. 
ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD 
They clear out a circle in the center of the pit and transform to humanoid mode. 
HOT ROD Didn't even bend a fender. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KUP Yeah, but look. There are a lot more of those cam dinging, grill-crackin' things. 
WHAT HE SEES 
is a wave of larger, more powerful Sharkticons. 
HOT ROD We can't hold out forever, but we can give them one whopper of a repair bill. 
ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICONS

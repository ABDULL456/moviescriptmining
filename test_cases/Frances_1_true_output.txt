WARDROBE MISTRESS (cool) This is the suit we fitted on you, Miss Farmer. 
FRANCES (friendly) Oh, I know that. But it could look more realistic, don't you think? 
WARDROBE MISTRESS (looking her over) It'll do. No one will notice. 
FRANCES I'll notice. 
We HEAR a man conspicuously clearing his throat. Both women turn as Mr. Bebe steps forward. 
WARDROBE MISTRESS Oh, Mr. Bebe, good morning. 
He nods imperceptibly. 
BEBE Come along with me, Fanny. 
She hesitates, then goes. 
FRANCES That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook. 
BEBE (leading her off) You see: We've got to change that name. 
EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY 
Frances and Bebe come through the sound stage door into the light. He gestures to indicate what direction they're going, but remains silent, watching her. She's uncomfortable, blinking like a bird. 
BEBE I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich -- 
FRANCES Thank you -- 
BEBE I intend to make a great deal of money off you. 
Frances is taken aback. This is all rather blunt. 
BEBE Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It." 
FRANCES Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific -- 
BEBE Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude. 
They hear a ruckus in the distance and turn and look: PICKETERS are fighting with POLICE. It is raucous, brutal. Bebe turns back to her with a stern look: 
BEBE Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I? 
FRANCES But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe. 
BEBE (fierce but very muted) No, I'm concerned with everything. 
FRANCES But I'm the one up there on the screen. 
BEBE That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act. 
She's about to reply, but he quickly takes her hand and raises it to his lips. Kisses it very formally, like a suitor. Then turns and walks into the sumptuous executive office building. 
She watches him go.

FADE IN: 
EXT. THEATRE MARQUEE - NIGHT 
Brightly colored bulbs flashing, causing the wisps of fog around them to glow. The bulbs spell: 
"COME AND GET IT" WITH SEATTLE'S OWN FRANCES FARMER 
A noisy CROWD is gathered outside the theatre, straining against velvet cordons. Big black limos disgorge couples in formal evening wear, to the applause of the crowd. All slightly small-town, off-key. 
Harry, now sporting a mustache, hat pulled down over his face, stands across the street. 
HARRY (puffing his cigarette) Not bad, Farmer. 
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 
Two limousines streaking through the night. 
INT. SECOND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
Frances sits next to a faceless STUDIO EXECUTIVE. She's all dolled up. She looks uncomfortable. Silence. She glances up at the limo ahead of them. 
INT. FIRST LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
Dick sits between Lillian and Ernest A REPORTER and PHOTOGRAPHER crouch in front of them. 
LILLIAN I guess it's no secret that I'm proud. Only twenty-one years old, and look at all she's done. (confidentially) As for her looks, I flatter myself that she gets them from me. 
DICK Obviously. 
He winks at the reporters. 
LILLIAN And not only has Frances come home a star; she's also brought me this big handsome lug of a son-in-law! 
REPORTER Mr. Farmer, what was your reaction when Frances told you she had married...

DAVIS I've got something here. 
STUART Let's have it. 
DAVIS There's an unconfirmed report of a distress call made from a plane that crashed. 
STUART That's really, really interesting, but (gestures around) -- kind of old news, don't you think? 
DAVIS This call was supposedly made from a plane that crash landed. After it landed. 
STUART (waves it off) Sounds like they got it wrong. Next time you interrupt my work make sure it's something I can use. 
INT. MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY 
Gabe and Maggie cautiously move along a single ledge -- finally, some light can be seen, thirty feet ahead, as they round a corner. 
GABE (smiling) Come on -- we're almost out. 
The crack narrows, and Gabe straddles it, putting his feet on the opposite edge to walk faster. But before he can go on -- 
A HAND 
grabs one of Gabe's ankles from below and yanks him down -- Gabe tumbles painfully, braking himself in front of 
KYNETTE 
bruised and bloody, who has survived the earlier fall and made his way out. His look is not a forgiving one. 
KYNETTE Miss me? 
Kynette smashes Gabe's face with a devastating, brass-knuckled punch -- 
GABE 
falls back, desperately grabbing at the walls to stop himself from going all the way down -- as he weakly tries to get up -- 
KYNETTE 
calmly opens his knife, and re-laces his fingers into its brass-knuckle handle. 
TOWER FACE 
The gang and Hal watch the mountain top, with very different expectations and hopes -- their vantage point keeps them from seeing where the crack actually comes out. 
QUALEN (looks to Hal) You might say a few words for your friends -- this is the one that will bury them. 
BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT 
Ready to blow -- 0:10 -- 0:09 -- 
IN THE CRACK - MAGGIE 
can only look down helplessly at 
GABE AND KYNETTE 
fighting -- Gabe is on his feet, but Kynette, slashing at him with his knife, is forcing Gabe to back up -- the crack is getting wider, and finding footholds while crab-walking backwards in the dark isn't east. 
Gabe's in a rotten fighting position -- as he has to spread his feet out wider as he backs up, he's always lower than Kynette. 
Gabe throws a punch at Kynette's stomach, but there's no power to it. Kynette hits Gabe with a brutal knuckle-duster punch -- Gabe flies back several feet, somehow managing to straddle the crack walls -- which are now four feet apart. Kynette moves in for the kill. 
BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT 
The LED counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- but doesn't detonate. A green light starts flashing, but the bomb hasn't gone off. 
IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY 
Kynette moves in over Gabe and swings down with the knife -- But Gabe grabs his knife hand, and adding his own force to the swing, imbeds the knife to the hilt in the rock wall, trapping Kynette's hand in the brass-knuckle handle. 
Gabe stabilizes himself on Kynette's trapped arm and gets a little payback -- three solid roundhouse punches to Kynette's face -- he then climbs up his pinned opponent, stepping up on Kynette's stuck hand as if it were a piton. 
TOWER FACE 
Qualen's smirk is wiped off his face. The bomb didn't work? 
TRAVERS What happened? 
QUALEN I'm not sure -- I set the timer -- 
Qualen gestures helplessly, putting the radio in Hal's reach. Hal takes advantage of this, throws off Travers, and grabs the radio. 
HAL (keying radio) Gabe, it's a dud -- 
But the second Hal transmits -- 
BOMB NUMBER TWO 
detonates over the central part of the crevice, and as promised, it's even bigger than the first -- 
INSIDE THE CRACK 
The bomb instantly blasts tons of rock down the crevice -- 
GABE AND MAGGIE 
The RUMBLE of the approaching rockslide is unmistakable -- Gabe shoves Maggie forward -- 
GABE Move! 
Maggie doesn't have to be told twice -- she and Gabe move out the narrowed crack quickly, but under the circumstances, this "running" looks damn slow -- 
KYNETTE 
struggles with the stuck knife as the cave-in knocks him off the wall and buries him instantly -- 
GABE AND MAGGIE

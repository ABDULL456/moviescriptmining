LETOUR I love you. 
LETOUR is alone. He pulls his pants on. Looking for his socks, he peruses Marianne's personal things. He examines her cosmetics, her underclothes. He dabs her perfume on his cheek. 
Buttoning his shirt, he retrieves his beeper from suit jacket. Activated, it disgorges messages. He checks his watch: 9:00 p.m. 
CUT TO: 
GET ON OUT 
Nine-thirty: Ann's apartment building. Trash stacked high. 
LETOUR presses the buzzer. 
LETOUR, exhausted, unfocused, enters Ann's apartment. ANN is immediately upon him: 
ANN Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee? 
LETOUR There was a mix-up -- 
ANN How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.'s got some conference in two days. The holiday's over -- ragheads everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel -- little creeps with lapel pins. Even I've been out. This is where our money is: Europe, Asia, not the streets -- you wouldn't know crack from crackerjacks. 
LETOUR Where's Robert? 
ANN Busting his ass. He's out doing your job. 
LETOUR It was a confusion. 
ANN Get confused on your day off. 
LETOUR When is that? 
ANN Don't get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There's a list on the TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss it. 
LETOUR (pecks her cheek) I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me. 
CUT TO: 
AU BAR 
LeTour's sedan waits between limos. 
Inside, JOHN passes the MAÎTRE D', looks around: he's known here. Au Bar, a restaurant/club open 9:00 p. m. to 4:00 a. m., caters to the young, the rich, the European. 
He spots TIS with THOMAS, twenty-five, his handsome trainer, and TWO MODELS at a second-floor table. They exchange nods. 
LETOUR scans the room: suspicion is second nature. 
A laughing man (GUIDONE) at the bar catches his eye. He seems to blend: Italian, twenty-eight, silk suit, impeccable hair, accent -- but something's not right. His black shoes have rubber soles. LETOUR looks for a gun bulge, dirty hands. The ITALIAN turns; LETOUR glimpses his face: too pale. The ITALIAN averts his eyes. Glancing back, LETOUR walks up the stairs to Tis' table. 
TIS Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas. They're here for a show. 
The MODELS respond in respective accents. THOMAS extends his hand. JOHN shakes, remains standing. 
LETOUR Enchanté. (to TIS) How'd it turn out?

MARIANNE (CONT'D) OK. Well, this is me. 
BRANDON nods, hovers by the subway, awkward and yet- 
BRANDON This is you. 
They stand heady from the wine and a little awkward. 
MARIANNE Thank you very much Brandon. 
BRANDON Thank you very much MARIANNE. We should do this again. 
SILENCE 
They loiter on the edge of something more. 
MARIANNE Right. 
SILENCE 
BRANDON hovers, momentarily fragile, the sting of uncertainty. MARIANNE descends into the depths of the subway, with a half wave. 
BRANDON So, is that a yes? 
MARIANNE (O.S.) Maybe, yeah. 
69   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                             69 
The CLICK of the door- 
BRANDON enters. The sound of the record player, which had finished hours ago, rotates empty on the turntable. 
Pulling off his jacket- 
BRANDON Hello? Sissy? 
SILENCE- 
BRANDON puts the needle back in it's dock. HE hangs up his jacket, takes his bag, heads towards the living room. He spies all SISSY's crap spilling out across the floor- 
He sighs. 
Heads to the kitchen and gets a can out of the fridge. 
70   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                             70 
The lock of the front door rotates. Someone is entering the apartment. 
Darkness- 
SISSY bursts through the door, in a hurry. 
After a moment the bathroom door opens, cutting a slit of light into the darkness. 
From the blackness we see BRANDON framed, masturbating in front of the bathroom sink. 
SISSY, shocked, stands with her hand still on the door handle, transfixed by a naked BRANDON. 
As BRANDON instinctively turns, SISSY runs from view. 
SISSY slams the door shut. 
BRANDON (O.S.) Oh! Fuck! 
SISSY (SNIGGERS) Fuck! 
BRANDON looks at himself in the mirror, full of shame and bewilderment and deep embarrassment. 
Slowly but surely these expressions turn into rage. He hits the wall in frustration. 
SISSY (CONT'D) Fuck! 
71   INT. LIVING ROOM CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                71 
BRANDON opens the bathroom door, with towel tied around his waist, looking for SISSY. 
BRANDON What? Are you fucking spying on me? 
SISSY (LAUGHS) Lock the fucking door, Brandon.

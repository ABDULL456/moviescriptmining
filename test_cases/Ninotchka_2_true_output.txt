During Swana's speech Ninotchka has found herself completely. 
NINOTCHKA I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here. 
SWANA Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous! (with a glance toward the living room) Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.

LONG SHOT -- LIVING ROOM -- TOWARD BEDROOM DOOR 
By the bed stand Ninotchka and Swana. Swana starts toward the living room, Ninotchka following her. 
SWANA (as she reaches the threshold) How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette. 
NINOTCHKA If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude. 
SWANA Don't worry, you were quite rude enough. (during the following speech, she draws the curtains and opens the windows) Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least. 
NINOTCHKA (regaining her usual firmness) Please come to the point. What is it you want? 
SWANA I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you. 
NINOTCHKA We have nothing to discuss. 
SWANA Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull. 
NINOTCHKA Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization. 
SWANA That's all right... I grow on people. 
NINOTCHKA I must ask you to leave. 
SWANA Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty. 
NINOTCHKA (puzzled) Madame, if you... 
SWANA Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time. 
NINOTCHKA (still not understanding) If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd? 
Ninotchka's words for the first time sting Swana out of her apparently superficial attitude. 
SWANA (bitterly) My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had... (with emphasis) but nothing more -- I warn you. 
NINOTCHKA (simply) People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning. 
SWANA Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox. 
NINOTCHKA It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony. 
SWANA My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels? 
The word diadem startles Ninotchka. She starts to remember the night before, and she looks toward the safe. 
INSERT OF THE DOOR OF THE SAFE, which is closed by now. 
CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND SWANA 
Ninotchka stares in the direction of the safe as Swana chatters on. 
SWANA You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight! 
NINOTCHKA (desperately) I must insist that you leave. 
SWANA Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow. 
NINOTCHKA In that case I can only say good-by. 
Abruptly she walks toward the bedroom. 
TRAVELING SHOT OF NINOTCHKA 
She enters the small room connecting the living room and bedroom and closes the door to the living room. She walks into the bedroom toward the bed and glances at it. The diadem is not there. After going back into the anteroom, she opens the outer door of the safe and pulls on the inner door. It has not been properly closed and opens at once. The safe is empty. Ninotchka stands staring in frozen horror for a moment, then rushes to the telephone by the bed. 
NINOTCHKA (into the telephone) Élysée 2763. 
LONG SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AT THE TELEPHONE, waiting for her connection 
In the background the door to the living room is opened by Swana. 
SWANA (standing in the door) I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest. 
NINOTCHKA I told you to go, madame. 
SWANA Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it. 
Ninotchka hangs up the receiver and stares at Swana. She walks toward her.

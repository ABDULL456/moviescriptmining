still seated in the front row, daydreaming. The RINGING CONTINUES as all the mourners and even the Rabbi discreetly check their cell phones. 
Then Ben realizes it's his, fumbles for the phone in his jacket pocket and answers it. BEN (whispers) Hello? The mourners mutter. 
CUT TO: INT. PRISON PAY PHONE - SAME TIME VITTI Guess who, you fuck! INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. CHAPEL Ben turns away from Laura. 
BEN Paul? (to Laura) I have to, uh, take this. (into phone) This isn't a good time. Vitti is disheveled, his hair messed, his shirt buttoned wrong. VITTI Not a good time? Let me explain something to you. I'm in fucking Hell right now. This is not a good time. BEN (sotto voce) I can't talk right now.     My father died! VITTI So what does that have to do with me? BEN Call me later -- VITTI Don't hang up on, Sobel!    They're tryin' to kill me! 
Ben hangs up. CUT BACK TO: 
VITTI He stands there for a long beat just staring, the DIAL TONE BUZZING in his ear. CUT TO: INT. SING SING - MESS HALL - NEXT DAY 
Vitti and another WISEGUY pass through the cafeteria line with their trays. Vitti now looks catatonic. WISEGUY #2 Ooh, they got tapioca. I love tapioca. (looks at Vitti) You all right, Paul? Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little. WISEGUY #2 Can I have your tapioca? 
A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from his post. Then he nods to someone across the room. COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in response. Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other tough Hispanic gang members. COYOTE (to Vitti) Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido? His friends laugh. Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them. COYOTE Just keep walkin', Don Corleone. There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing. COYOTE Shut up! Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic. COYOTE I said, shut up, bitch!

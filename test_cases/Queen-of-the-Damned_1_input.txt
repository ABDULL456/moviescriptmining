AKASHA You thought it was all you? (laughing) You have the ego of a king as well. I know you, Lestat. I know that you crave to have the world at your feet. I have come to give it to you. 
Akasha bites her own lip. Blood trickles slightly across her chin. Lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it, as the pulse of her blood increases... Lestat looks at it, both wanting and fearful. Wrapping her arms around Lestat, she braces him, licks his face. 
AKASHA Has your tongue lost its taste for blood? 
LESTAT (melting) Never. 
AKASHA But you didn't kill the mortal girl. 
Lestat looks caught. 
AKASHA Instead you kissed her.   Now kiss me. 
(NOTE: Shoot as practical, actor against plain night sky, as much as possible.) Akasha rises above him, hovers over Lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill into his mouth. Lestat levitates above the ground to meet her as... 
Akasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into him. Lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers in him and floods his body with an electric rush. 
AKASHA Be my King. Forget about everything else. 
Lestat looks straight at Akasha, his face flushed.    His eyes are empty of everything except her blood. 
AKASHA What's your answer?

Lestat looks at her and then smiles. Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile. Flashes of brilliant light strobe over them as Lestat moves to her, sucks again. There's a powerful rush of WIND that engulfs them as they spin together, detached from time and space. 
181   FLASH CUTS - STOCK FOOTAGE                                   181 
All INTERCUT WITH Akasha's skin, her body taut and arching. Lestat falls back in ecstasy. He shakes out his body and lets out a howl of pleasure -- feels his arms, his chest, his groin as Akasha's blood courses through his veins. Akasha watches and waits. Finally Lestat grins boyishly through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of his hand. 
LESTAT Can we try that again? 
Akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a kind of purr/growl. Lestat gazes at her as the sensual hissing seems to surround him. It is seductive and scary. Lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips. 
LESTAT Show me the world... 
Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up into the air and off into the night. 
182   INT. MAHARET DESERT MANSION - NIGHT                          182 
Mael leads Jesse down the hall. She stares ahead at what looks like statues standing in the shadows. Her eyes widen as the statues come to life: Armand, Pandora, Khayman, Marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered before Maharet's "Great Family Tree." CAMERA SWEEPS OVER the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch down the stone wall -- ACROSS the floor, filling room after room. The Ancients all stare, deeply moved. Maharet turns to them. 
MAHARET We see now what Akasha means to do. Rule as Queen again. (pointing to the great family) This is why we must fight Akasha! 
Maharet looks around, determined, challenging each of the immortals.

MAHARET For the sake of all mortals. She must be stopped, or the mortal world will end. 
The Ancients fall silent as they take this in. They gaze again at Maharet's Great Family, humbled for a moment by her life's passion. 
MAEL But is there a way?   We don't know. 
KHAYMAN When she opens herself to give her blood, she is vulnerable. 
MARIUS Then we weaken her. Drain her of almost all her blood, but leave her just one drop. 
MAHARET We can't take that chance.    We must finish her. 
ARMAND If she dies, we all die. 
PANDORA We're damned no matter what happens. 
MAHARET Perhaps. 
Maharet gazes at them, her mind working... Pandora, Khayman, Mael gaze at each other, still uncertain. 
JESSE And what about Lestat? 
MAHARET Lestat has joined with Akasha. He is lost to us now. He is never coming back. 
JESSE I don't believe that.

Beaming with a possessed look, his eyes brimming with visions.

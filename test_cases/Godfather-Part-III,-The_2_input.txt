(THEN) I've invited L berto Croce to sit in with us-because of his strong connections in Latin America and in the exile comarunity down in Florida -- and because he's a trusted and valued friend of the Corl eone family.

TONY It's a political assassination. The target is Asmanda Vidal. 
A,NQ1'8ER ANGLE Santino, whose attitude has been somewhat sardonic throughout, now breaks out in a bray of laughter. Tony turns on his cousin, then coldly and quietly: 
TONY If it's too much for you, just say so. M can break this off right now --- Santino, taken aback at the cold authority in Tony's manner, turns for support.

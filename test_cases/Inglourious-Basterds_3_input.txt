INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT ,including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting amongst the master race, waiting for showtime. 
EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle the hooded Aldo, down the red carpet, then into the alley besides the cinema. Aldo's put up against a wall. Inside the black hood, he's SCREAMING every insulting thing about Germany, Germans, German food, German shepherd... anything. 
COL.LANDA'S VOICE(OS) Shut up! The faceless black hood does. Col.Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner, says in ENGLISH; 
COL.LANDA As Stanley said to Livingston; Lt.Aldo Raine, I presume? 
I 'to. 
LT. ALDO Hans Landa? 
COL.LANDA You've had a nice long run, Aldo. Alas, your now in the hands of the SS. My hands to be exact. And they've been waiting along time, to touch you. He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's face right in the middle of the hood. Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES. 
COL.LANDA Caught ya flinching. In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck. Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform, bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant. The Truck drives off. Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels, Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down the red carpet into the cinema. Landa smiles. 
EXT TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of night. We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino. 
INT - TRUCK(MOVING) - NIGHT The two hooded prisoners, bounce along in the back of the truck. Utivich, is crying inside his hood. 
LT.ALDO Utivich? 
UTIVICH Is that you Lieutenant? 
LT. ALDO Yep. 
lyl. 
UTIVIC}I Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirchberg? The woman? 
LT.ALDO No I do not. 
UTIVICH Lieutenant, sorry I'm crying. 
LT. ALDO Nothin to be sorry about, son. This bag, get to anyone. 
UTIVICH Not exactly John Wayne, am I? 
LT.ALDO John Waynes a pampered movie star. He burst into tears, if his cook, busts his yoke at breakfast. Just try puttin a bag over his head, and hear what kinda sounds he makes. Utivich, giggles through the tears. 
LT.ALDO I just want you to know, son, I was real proud of you tonight. Learnin how to drive overnight. Driving in that Limo line. You was in the hot seat, son, and you stood up real good. Utivich Cries LOUDER. Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot on top. The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich. In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity. 
EXT- COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La Louisaiane), The two hooded prisoners, are walked inside the establishment. 
INT - COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT The hooded men are lead into the closed for business, but open for something else, rustic tavern. 
0The Nazi Guards, unlock the handcuff, then sit them down inchairs. Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF. The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now see, is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa. A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at  a impressive looking two way radio set up in the tavern. Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated American soldiers. They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene. 
COL.LANDA Italian? Really? 
(BEAT) What could you have possibly been thinking? 
LT. ALDO Well, I speak alittle Italian - 
COL.LANDA I speak a little Tagalog, but I wouldn't begin to presume I could pass for Filipino. Don't get me wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what with you losing your Germans. And I have nothing but admiration for improvisation. Still.... Chico Marx is more convincing. if the three of you had shown up to the premiere dressed in womans attire, it would have been more convincing. Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners. 
COL.LANDA 
(GERMAN) You may leave us. But stay alert outside. They exit, leaving the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the Private and a German Radio Man in the corner. 
COL.LANDA So your Aldo the Apache? 
LT. ALDO So your The Jew Hunter? 
COL.LANDA Jew Hunter, (pfuit), I'm a detective. A damn good detective. Finding people is my specialty. So naturally, I worked for the Nazi's finding people. And yes, some of them were Jews. But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck. 
UTIVICH Well you do hafts admit, it is catchy. 
COL.LANDA Do you control the nicknames, your enemies bestow on you? Aldo the Apache and The Little Man? 
UTIVICH What do you mean, The Little Man? 
COL.LANDA The Germans nickname for you. 
UTIVICH The Germans nickname for me is, The Little Man? 
COL.LANDA Or "The Little One, ether one means you. And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life. I mean, your a little fellow. But not circus midget little, as your reputation would suggest. 
LT.ALDO Where is my men? Where is Bridget Von Hammersmark? 
COL.LANDA Bridget Von Hammersmark. Oh I'm sure she's in whatever, big bubbling cesspool in hell, the devil reserves for traitors of her ilk. 
COL. LANDA

The crewmen release the lines, and the boat drops - 
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT 
The pirate group moves deeper into the caves. Will moves along unwillingly. 
PINTEL No reason to fret. It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood. 
BARBOSSA Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins. (grins) Best play it safe, and spill it all. 
PINTEL I guess there is a reason to fret. 
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT 
The Dauntless drifts into the lagoon. Norrington and his men prepare to go ashore.     h 
INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT 
Lit by torchlight. Will notices: a crack runs between the floor and the wall of the cave, widening into a ravine. 
BARBOSSA Careful, now. You could fall in and still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt. 
Will makes a decision. He intentionally stumbles. Pintel 
shoves him forward -- Will continues forward, grabs the pirate in front of him, swings him into the wall of the cave. Catches the pirate's torch, and uses it to ward off the others. 
WILL You deserve to be cursed -- and remain cursed! 
He steps to one side -- and drops into the ravine. The wall of the ravine becomes a loose gravel slope; Will hits it, and tumbles down, disappears into black. 
BARBOSSA Blast him! A pox on him, and his father, and the whole damnable line! Fan out! Find him! 
INT. DAUNTLESS - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT 
Elizabeth looks out the Captain's small porthole -- sees boats laden with Navy men headed for shore. 
She turns away from the porthole, wishing there was something she could do. Suddenly there is a flutter at the window-- 
Cotton's parrot is there. 
COTTON'S PARROT Drink UP me hearties yo ho! Drink UP me hearties yo ho! 
The bird flutters off; Elizabeth races to the porthole, and then to the stern window to see it flyaway. 
She looks down -- and there, fastened to the stern of the ship, is a small rowboat. 
INT. ISLA DEMUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT 
Will races forward, turning this way and that. He sees a light ahead, heads for it, turns a corner - 
-- and runs straight into Jack. 
JACK Do you have any idea where you're going? 
WILL Jack! 
JACK Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me. 
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA -       THE BEACH - NIGHT 
Norrington and men land on the beach, and spread out. They silently take up positions around the main cave entrance. 
INT. CAVES - NIGHT 
Jack leads Will out of a narrow passage -- and stops, staring. Will is a few steps behind. 
WILL Are you certain this is the right way? 
JACK It's the right way. 
Will join him -- and see what Jack is staring at: 
Treasure piled on treasure, sparkling, glowing, seemingly 
endless. At the center is the moonlit clearing, and the stone Aztec chest. 
BARBOSSA Thank you, Jack Sparrow. 
The jump -- Barbossa is standing right behind them, flanked by his men. The trio whirl to run - - more pirates emerge from hiding. Nearly the entire crew of the Black Pearl is there. 
The pirates grab Will and Jack. Will struggles, but Jack does not fight at all. 
BARBOSSA (CONT'D) You couldn't have led him back more directly if you knew exactly where you were going. 
He laughs, and moves toward the stone chest. The pirates follow, dragging Will and Jack with them. 
WILL You did know where you were going! You did lead us directly to them! (Jack's silence confirms it) Why? 
Jack looks away -- as Will is manhandled toward the chest. Barbo8sa steps up to him (becoming skeletal in the moonlight) and puts the medallion around Will's neck. 
He picks up the stone knife.

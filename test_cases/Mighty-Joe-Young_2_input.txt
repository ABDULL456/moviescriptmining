61   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       61 
An exhausted Harry catches his breath at the gate around the habitat. Baker has a thoughtful look on his face. 
BAKER Put that girl in charge of the gorilla, Harry. 
HARRY What? Elliot, she's got no scientific... 
BAKER That ape is the best fund-raising tool this conservancy has ever seen. He's happy -- I'm happy. Put her on the payroll. 
Baker turns and walks away. 
62   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       62 
Gregg and Cecily watch as Jill plays hide and seek with Joe. 
Jill dashes away and runs over to Gregg. She is absolutely glowing, bouncing around with happiness.   She grabs both his arms, jumping up and down. 
JILL He's playing!    Did you see? 
GREGG (laughing) I saw. 
JILL He likes it here! Isn't it great? 
GREGG It's great. 
Jill surprises Gregg by giving him a hug. Gregg looks over her shoulder and sees that Joe is giving him the evil eye. He's jealous. Gregg stares back, equally challenging. 
Jill, unaware of the competition, lets go of Gregg and happily runs back to Joe. Gregg and Joe continue to hold each other's eyes. Cecily sighs and shakes her head. 
CECILY Sorry, babe, but in a pissing match the monkey kicks your ass.

GREGG What are you talking about? 
CECILY Oh please. I was wondering why you hadn't taken off yet. Normally, you're out the door soon as the animal's in his habitat. 
GREGG You've got an active imagination, Cecily. 
CECILY I don't think so. I think Mr. World Traveller has goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl. 
Gregg scoffs. But from the look on his face, it's clear she's hit a nerve. 
63   INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      63 
A KNOCK at Jill's apartment door. She opens it and lights up to see Gregg standing there. Gregg looks past her into the room. She's made some changes; the bed's on the floor and a few large potted ferns crowd the room. 
GREGG Like what you've done with the place. 
JILL Too bad it's always so cold -- somebody broke my window. 
She smiles at him and motions for him to come in.     Gregg steps just inside the door and stops. 
GREGG I just came by to tell you that I think Joe looks real good out there... 
JILL I know! This is working out -- better than I expected. 
GREGG ... and that I'm hitting the road. 
Jill looks at Gregg keenly.    He's acting like he's got something to tell her. 
(CONTINUED) 
63   CONTINUED:                                                    63 
JILL Where you going? 
GREGG Back to Africa. (pauses) For a couple of months. 
Jill stays light. 
JILL No kidding?   When do you leave? 
GREGG Now. 
Jill just nods. 
Gregg is struggling -- this is more difficult than it's ever been for him. He tries to be nonchalant... 
GREGG It's the job, y'know. Always on the road. It's what I like, anyway -- can't stand to be caged up... 
They meet eyes.      They both know what that means. 
GREGG You and Joe will be okay... 
Jill shrugs, acting like she doesn't care either. 
JILL Oh -- of course. 
GREGG Yeah.   Well... 
JILL                         GREGG (overlapping)                    (overlapping) See you when you get back.           I'll call you. 63A. 
63A   INT. CONSERVANCY CONDO - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION             63A 
Gregg turns and heads back down the hall.    Jill sticks her head out and calls after him. 
JILL (biting) Say hello to Africa for me. 
She slams the door to her apartment. Gregg freezes for a moment, then continues down the hallway alone. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN:

Hockstettler takes out his lighter and hairspray, launching a fire ball that illuminates the cavern below. 
Monoliths of rusted machinery, half-submerged in stagnant puddles of black mud. 
And for an instance, a CLOWN.   Pennywise. Then blackness again. 
Hockstettler saw IT, but doesn't believe it. He unleashes another fire ball. For a second we see the faces of DEAD CHILDREN amongst the monoliths. 
Hockstettler isn't sure if he's seen right. He walks in, the hair rising on the back of his neck. 
INT. CELLAR HOLD - SAME 
Hockstettler carefully maneuvers his way down into the hold. His feet, blindly tapping for purchase. 
HOCKSTETTLER I ain't afraid. Any you ghosts down here can't hurt me. 
As if it were a mantra, to make himself feel less scared. 
HOCKSTETTLER (CONT'D) I seen ghosts. I did them in their butt holes. 
And out of the darkness... 
PENNYWISE Did they float? 
He freezes.   Did he hear that or was that in his head? 
HOCKSTETTLER I, I-   Who's there? 
Hockstettler lights a ball of hair spray, it illuminates the walls near him, but nothing far away. 
HOCKSTETTLER (CONT'D) There's no one down here. There's no one that can hurt me. 
He moves down deeper. Lights the hair spray again, and for second, we think we glimpsed, deeper in the shadows, Pennywise. 
PENNWISE (WHISPERING) Patrick... Answer me. 
Now sure he's heard something, Patrick stops. His breathing starts to rapidly increase. He wants to back up, but he's frozen. 
He lifts up his hair spray can, finger shaking on the plastic nozzle, he lifts the lighter. CLINK. The flint lights up the small flame. Sputtering in the flowing air in the cellar. His breathing is arrhythmic, compressed. 
PENNYWISE Because down here, we all float. 
He sprays. The flame spits out and out of the darkness, PENNYWISE the clown leaps onto Hockstettler, tumbling him into the cellar hold, he drops the lighter and hairspray, which rolls down to the feet of a child. A DEAD CHILD. 
EXT. KEENE'S PHARMACY - DAY 
The pack of boys, Will, Richie, Ben, and Eddie come biking down Center Street and swing into RICHARD'S ALLEY. They jump off, bikes clattering to the pavement. 
WILL Okay Richie, you and... 
BEN Ben. 
WILL Ben stay here. We'll get some bandages and stuff. 
Will and Eddie race in, leaving Ben and Richie in the alley which is emblazoned with a COLORFUL MURAL about the FBI's ambush of the infamous Bradley Gang, a celebrated slice of Derry town history. 
BEN Thanks for helping me. 
RICHIE You're not the only one on Bower's shitlist. 
Ben nods, grateful for the company. He notices in the mural, in one of the windows, a CLOWN watches the ambush with glee. 
INT. KEENE'S PHARMACY - DAY 
Eddie snatches cotton balls and antiseptic and bandages off the shelf like an expert. He checks the prices. 
EDDIE Woah, that's a lot of money. Will? 
Will pulls out one crumbled dollar. 
WILL All I got.     You got an account here don't you? 
EDDIE You crazy? My mom finds out I bought this stuff for myself I'll have to spend the whole weekend in the emergency room getting x-rayed. 
WILL Well we need to do something. That kid out there looks like someone killed him. 
They glance at the mirror where MR. KEENE (70s) the grumpy, eagle-eyed pharmacist watches them like a hawk. 
BEVERLY (O.S.) You consider a diversion? 
They all turn to Beverly, who stands there sly and smiling. 
WILL Huh? 
BEVERLY Your friend there. He has that thingy he always carries around in his cute little fannypack right? 
EDDIE My EpiPen Jr.? 
BEVERLY Yeah. For when he spazzes out. 
EDDIE I don't spaz. Those are allergic reactions. Life threatening allergic reactions. 
BEVERLY Whatever. The point is he has a track record right? Of spazzing out. 
EDDIE I DON'T-- 
WILL Eds, shut up. She's on to something. 
INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Mr. Keene fills prescriptions. Eddie flops out of the aisle clutching his throat. Will and Beverly run out after.

STEPHANIE Okay, let's change the subject... She begins piling up plates and silverware. 
ALI You want to fuck? She is thrown for a loop. 
STEPHANIE Huh? 
ALI You want to know if it still works, so let's fuck and that way you'll know. He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous laugh. 
STEPHANIE Just like that? 
ALI Um, yeah. Give me that. He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the dishwasher. 
STEPHANIE I... I don't know if I can like that... 
ALI Whatever you want... You tell me... She hesitates. 
STEPHANIE Wait. She wheels herself away from the table and into the bedroom. He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table. 
ALI What do I do? 
STEPHANIE (OFF) Wait! He waits. Then: 
STEPHANIE (OFF) Come here. 
85. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM. DAY 
He enters the room. The shutters are closed. She is in bed, under the covers. She watches him sit down on the bed, undo 
his pants and turn toward her. 
ALI Okay? Ready? Unsure of herself, she pulls a face. 
STEPHANIE Let's try. He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away gently. 
STEPHANIE (a little nervous) Do you mind if we don't kiss? 
ALI No. Your breasts... can I? 
STEPHANIE Yes. He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering her. She tries to wriggle herself free. 
STEPHANIE You're crushing me! 
ALI Maybe you should stop talking now... 
STEPHANIE Okay, I'll stop. His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets herself go. She grabs hold of him. 
STEPHANIE Gently! 
86. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN. DAY 
Ali opens the fridge. He is dressed again. Stephanie appears in a robe, sitting in her wheelchair. We can tell she feels too shy to look at him. 
ALI Are you okay? How was it? She blushes. 
ALI Is it still working? 
STEPHANIE Um, yes... no... I don't really know. It's different... It's hard to tell after just one try... 
ALI Yeah but I don't have time right now. I have to go!

HAVEN Today I'd hate to tangle with a butterfly. 
CHARLIE What do you think you'll get out of running the stage line? 
HAVEN A commission on all the gold I get through. 
CHARLIE That should buy you a small beer. 
HAVEN Glad to get it. 
CHARLIE It's pretty dangerous. Even Wells Fargo locked up their station and quit trying. 
HAVEN (leveling) Who steals the gold? 
CHARLIE Who doesn't? All they have to do is put a mask on and they all look like Black Bart. 
HAVEN (rising) Give me a letter of authorization. 
CHARLIE (going to the desk) I can't bet against you twice, can I? 
As she writes out the authorization, Haven saunters to the window, then over to the desk. Charlie finishes and hands him the paper. Haven scans it, pockets it. 
CHARLIE (smiling at him) You know I forgot to ask you one thing. 
HAVEN I'm working for you now. You can ask me anything. 
Haven is moving to the door and she beside him. They pause. 
CHARLIE How do I know I can trust you? 
HAVEN You don't. 
CHARLIE Can I? 
He looks at her face, neck and hair. She looks pretty good. 
HAVEN Only with money. 
Haven looks squarely at her a moment, then smiles. He reaches out one bandaged hand and pats her shoulder. 
HAVEN (quietly) Okay, boss? 
He walks out, and Charlie remains standing there, staring after him, just a little hazily. 
DISSOLVE 
EXT. STAGE LINE DEPOT - DAY 
As Haven walks through the wide gate into a compound. There are several unhitched stages and freight wagons, one or two in partial disassembly and being serviced. A colored boy is readying a horse and buggy and beside him, overlooking the yard activities, is a bespectacled man with rubber sleeve garters. He is the manager. He has eyes like Armadillo and claw-like hands; otherwise, he could be your loan agency man. Seeing Haven he crosses to him. 
HAVEN (looking him over) Are you the manager? 
MANAGER I am. 
HAVEN My name's Haven. 
MANAGER I've heard about you. You're the fellah who took Mick Marion apart. (looking at him) Almost knocked me off my feet. But my feet ain't been any good since I followed Stonewall Jackson. (keenly) What business you got with me? 
HAVEN (handing him the note) I'm the new boss. 
The manager glances at the note, after moving his spectacles out of the way. He gives it back without a word, and turns toward the rear office door. Haven halts him. 
HAVEN Wait a minute. You're not fired. 
MANAGER I got to be. There ain't enough work around here for one man, let alone two. 
HAVEN Two can loaf as easy as one. 
Jim Goddard and Jerry enter from the rear office door. Jerry is the younger. Goddard walks a little stiffly with the aid of a cane. 
JERRY Mr. Leonard! 
They halt and look at Haven. The Manager jerks a thumb at Haven. 
MANAGER Talk to him. He just took the reins. (indicating the two lads) This is Jim Goddard. He's a regular stage driver. Jerry here runs freight to the sawmill. Boys, your new boss. 
HAVEN Hello, boys. 
JERRY (with a grin of hero worship) I gotta start out of here for the sawmill before daybreak. Is that all right, Mr. Haven? 
Haven nods, after a glance at the manager. 
JERRY I seen that fight last night. It was sure a beauty. 
HAVEN Glad you enjoyed it. 
JERRY What I liked was the way you --

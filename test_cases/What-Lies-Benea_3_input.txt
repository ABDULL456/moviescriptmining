JODY Know what I think? 
CLAIRE What? 
JODY Seance. 
CLAIRE Jody, no... 
JODY Telling you... 
CLAIRE (overlapping) ...no...no...no... 
JODY Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija. 
CLAIRE Please.  That's all I need. 
Jody shrugs, "Have it your way."  Beat. 
JODY Hey, look. 
CLAIRE'S HOUSE across the lake. 
JODY So pretty. 
CLAIRE'S POV 
A FIGURE in the turreted window of Norman's study. 
CLAIRE Someone's there. 
JODY What? 
CLAIRE In the window.  Norman's at work. 
JODY I don't... 
Claire looks over at Jody. 
CLAIRE (pointing) There.  In the study.  Don't you see-- 
She looks again-- nothing. 
CLAIRE Wow.  I'm losing it. 
JODY No, you're not. (beat) But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly. 
Claire stares back at the house. 
INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Claire walks in and sets down some packages.  She opens one and pulls out new toothpaste and...AN ENVELOPE-- the kind your pictures come back in.  She absently leafs through them, then freezes.  She gapes at one of the shots. 
CLAIRE Oh boy... 
INT.  UPSTAIRS - NIGHT 
Claire turns off the lights and crouches down.  She raises a pair of BINOCULARS. 
POV - BINOCULARS 
Claire rakes the binoculars across the Feur's house...past their car parked in front until she finds A LIGHT ON DOWNSTAIRS. 
The tall, powerfully built Mr. Feur walks into the room and sits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for one.  He eats a TV dinner, slowly chewing and staring straight ahead.  He sips from a can of beer. 
Just then...A HAND GRABS CLAIRE'S ARM.  She lets out a screech and turns to see Norman standing beside her. 
NORMAN What are you doing? 
She glances back out the window and sees Mr. Feur standing at the window, paging the curtain.  She squats down, pulling Norman with her. 
CLAIRE (shrill whisper) Get down!  He'll see. 
NORMAN (also whispers) What's going on, Claire? 
CLAIRE Shhhh. 
She peers over the sill in time to see Mr. Feur turning away from the window.  She takes Norman by the hand and leads him downstairs. 
INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
She leads Norman in. 
NORMAN (still whispering) Why am I... (full voice) Why am I whispering in my own house? 
Claire turns. 
CLAIRE He killed her.

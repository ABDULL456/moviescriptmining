Maslow sees Raizo emerge from the smoke and flames, carrying Mika in his arms. 
MASLOW Mika! 
He runs to her side as Raizo lays her gently on the ground. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) What happened? 
RAIZO She saved my life. 
Raizo puts his hand on her chest. Closes his eyes.          We can FEEL her heart-beat. Bump-thump. Bump-thump. 
Raizo opens his eyes. 
RAIZO (CONT'D) She will be all right. 
MASLOW How can you be sure? 
Raizo touches her face as she takes in a sudden breath. He smiles distantly. 
RAIZO Her heart is special. 
MIKA Medic!    Over here now! 
Several medics rush to them, Raizo gently laying her on the stretcher. 
As they immediately begin working on her, Raizo fades back. 
Maslow remains at her side. 
Her eyes flutter open. 
MASLOW Is she going to be okay? 
MEDIC I don't know...she's got a hole right through the middle of her heart...but shes not really bleeding, that badly...

She points to the right side of her chest. 
MIKA (CONT'D) ...is over here. 
MASLOW ...you gotta be fucking kidding me. 
MIKA ...Raizo? 
MASLOW He said you saved his life. 
She smiles. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) So you kept your promise. Can we go home now?

SOUNDS of a nearby argument catch her attention. 
JEREMY (OS) ...how many times I gotta tell you, man: we can't accept this! 
EMT (OS) Well, what the hell else am I suppose to do with it? 
Susan heads in the direction of the voices. 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY NEAR MORGUE 
An ORDERLY (JEREMY) argues with an EMT.  Their point of contention:  a small FORM lying on a stretcher. 
JEREMY Take it out back and throw it in the friggin' dumpster! 
EMT Not unless somebody signs for it. 
Susan walks toward them, catches sight of the tiny form. 
Her eyes go wide. 
SUSAN Oh, my God. 
Jeremy notices her. 
JEREMY Hey, you can't... 
SUSAN What's your name? 
JEREMY Jeremy... 
SUSAN Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you? 
JEREMY Lady... 
SUSAN Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!! 
Jeremy hesitates.  But if her tone wasn't enough, the stare she gives him certainly is. 
JEREMY Okay. 
Jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall. 
Susan approaches the stretcher. 
SUSAN (To EMT) Where'd you find it? 
EMT Washed up at the filtration plant on Bank street. Some asshole there thought it was a baby. They called us. 
Susan bends over it.  She covers her mouth and nose at the stench. 
EMT It's a lobster, right? 
But it's not.  What lies on the stretcher before them looks more like a demon from a Brueghel painting. 
A THREE FOOT INSECT.  It's mephitic, pink-white body is rotten, falling apart.  The head's intact, with strange, large jaws thrown wide open. The chitin on one is half gone. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM 
Josh deposits a backpack full of equipment on the floor, along with a small acrylic cage. Peter trains his FLASHLIGHT into the bank of lockers. 
Leonard, weary and pissed, looks at his watch. 
LEONARD Better hurry it up, Doc. My shift's almost over. 
Josh hands him a piece of paper. 
PETER Guess someone requested you for overtime...buddy. 
Peter braces his legs and tries to push the whole bank of lockers clear--the locker section tips and falls with an ENORMOUS BANG, which echoes loudly off the tile walls. Dust flies everywhere. 
When the dust settles and flashlights are focussed on the area of the wall where the lockers stood, we see a LARGE HOLE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MORGUE - DAY 
Using a steel probe, Susan examines the dead insect. 
SUSAN Posterior sternites are gone...half the protonum rotted off. 
Raymond lifts one of the wings.  A CLUMP OF WHITE LARVAE feasts on the flesh underneath. 
RAYMOND Maggots... 
SUSAN Near hatching.  Thing must've died about three weeks ago. 
Susan closes the mandibles and examines them. 
SUSAN Do you have a polaroid? 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBWAY TRACKS 
Water DRIPPING from overhead, ECHOING footsteps- very spooky.  Leonard leads Peter and Josh down the tunnel- 
LEONARD You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up. 
JOSH (Whisper to Peter) New York's finest. 
Monumental archways give way to naves as big as Notre Dame.

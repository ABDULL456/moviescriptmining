NIGHT FOREMAN What'd you say you did? 
SPOONER Research and Development. 
As Spooner pushes past him into... 
41   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS                                41 
...the Control Booth. Overlooking the pristine Factory Floor. The Foreman starts working the controls of a central computer. 
CALVIN All Nestors accounted for? 
The SCREEN scrolls with INVENTORY FIGURES. 
NIGHT FOREMAN (gesturing) As you can see, all properly catalogued. Your robot just isn't here. 
Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't there. She looks around. Then sees the Foreman reacting. Looks out the window at... 
SPOONER.   Walking out onto the factory floor. 
42   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       42 
Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT. Lined with NS- 2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room. 
Calvin and the Foreman.   Catching up.   Over the noise: 
NIGHT FOREMAN Like I said, sir -- we have one hundred fully assembled NS-2s housed here. That's our capacity. Last week we had one hundred. Yesterday we had one hundred -- 
Spooner, slowing.   Finally spotting what he was looking for. Points at: 
A GAP.   On the assembly belt.    ONE LEG MISSING. 
SPOONER Well today you have one-hundred and one. 
43   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       43 
A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. The sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as 101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines. 
Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands. 
SPOONER (to Calvin) You're the robot shrink. 
The Robots stand motionless.     A strange tableau.   Calvin. Takes a step forward. 
CALVIN There is a robot in this formation that does not belong. Identify it. 
101 robots answer in unison.    Their mechanical VOICES resounding: 
101 ROBOTS ONE OF US. 
CALVIN Which one? 
101 ROBOTS ONE OF US. 
CALVIN That is not a satisfactory answer! 
101 ROBOTS ONE OF US. 
SPOONER That's helpful. 
CALVIN I could always interview each one individually and cross-reference their responses to detect any anomalies. 
SPOONER How long would that take? 
CALVIN About three weeks. 
They share a look. Clearly not an option.      Then.   Calvin. Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner... 
CALVIN Or... 
...and GRABS his GUN from his holster.   He jumps back. 
CALVIN We have one hundred robots here that cannot allow a human being to come to harm... 
Their eyes lock.   Spooner, getting what she's doing. 
SPOONER And one that can. 
She raises the gun to Spooner's head.    Hand, unsteady. 
CALVIN Am I holding this right? 
SPOONER More or less.

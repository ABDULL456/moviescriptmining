Especially if we restrict his future to only watching news. Then he'll be like a timescope. \nWisdom nods. \nWISDOM You were right. This is huge. \nFERRIS This is just for starters. You want to stage a pre-emptive strike, he can tell you if you'll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong. And you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin. \nWisdom chuckles at the enormity of the potential. \nwisDOM And all he's ever done with it is a little gambling and securities fraud? \nFeRRIS I know, it's amazing; but he's not ambitious. \nWiSDOM Damn, how will we control this guy when he figures out what he's capable of? \nFerris We control him now. We just have to keep it that way. \nWISDOM Right now, sweetheart, we can't even get him to sit in a chair. \nDread suddenly washes over Wisdom. \nWISDOM We've got to think this through. Your friend could be more dangerous than the terrorists. \nFerris Aren't you running ahead of yourself? \nWISDOM With this guy, you have to.

Then I might start to feel safe. \nFerris grins uncomfortably. \nFerris You're not serious. \nWISDOM Think about it. What we're talking about here is the next step in human evolution. And I'm not gonna make the same mistake the Neanderthals made when they ran across this good-looking Homo Sapien fellow and all the lady Neanderthals said, \"He's so cute. Let's keep him around.\" \nFERRIS Can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time? \nWISDOM You mean after it's too late? \nFerris seems to come around to Wisdom's logic. \nFerris I wish you'd given me a chance to chain him up before you decided to prune him into a stump. \nThey are both filled with dread. \nwisdom You think he knows?

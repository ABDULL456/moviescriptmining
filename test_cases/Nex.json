{"train": "NEXT \nWritten by \nGary Goldman \nBased on \"The Golden Man\" \nWritten by \nPhilip K. Dick \nMay 14, 2004 \nBARE WHITE ROOM \nThirty feet square. CRIS JOHNSON, wearing a jail uniform, sits in a HEAVY CHAIR that is bolted to the floor. Mid- twenties, jaded, rebellious, handsome as a statue, Cris radiates a serene, if somewhat scruffy, charisma. \nHe faces a PLASMA SCREEN MONITOR on a bare wall. To the left of the screen, an unframed MIRROR; to the right, a DIGITAL CLOCK-CALENDAR. \nA WOMAN'S FACE appears on the plasma screen. CALLIE FERRIS. Thirty. Tailored. Angular. Kate Hepburn-ish. \nFerris on monitor Mr. Johnson, you've been sent to us by the state authorities for testing. We want to determine if there's any substance to your claims. \nCrIS Fire away. \nFERRIS ON MONITOR If we can verify your ability, we may be able to help you avoid a criminal trial. \nCRIS And \"we\" is...? \nFerris ON MONITOR Homeland Security. \nFerris' face is replaced on the plasma screen by a series of random video clips. Hang-gliding. Traffic jam. Volcano erupting. \nFerris ON MONITOR Now if you would, please look at the monitor and tell us what you see, say, five minutes from now. \nCris looks at the clock. 16:32 / March 9, 2006. He squints and the clock speeds up a little. \nFerris (o.c.) Are you there yet? \nIn a few seconds, the clock reads 16:37. \nOn the monitor. Ferris' image has been replaced by footage of surfers riding big waves in Hawaii. \nCrIS Surfers. \nFerris (o.c.) Good. Now can you move ahead ten minutes. \nVaried images fast forward on the plasma screen. He arrives at 16:47 and reports on what he sees. \ncris Ants crawling up a tree. \nFerris (o.c.) Excellent. Can you get to 1900 hours? \nCris looks ahead and squints. \nCLOCK \nMinutes whiz by. \nPLASMA SCREEN \nClips play and change almost too fast to be recognized. \nClock \nCris gets to 19:00 -- and keeps going. \nMirror \nCris has a five o'clock shadow. \nClock \nHours tick off like an accelerating metronome. \nMirror \nCris sports a three-day stubble. He struggles to get out of the chair, but he is now strapped into it, bound at the wrist and ankle. His face fills with rage. \nPlasma screen \nThe evening news zips by. Talking heads. Reportage. \nMirror \nLike a window into a time machine. Cris' beard lengthens. He grows pale. His clothes change every few seconds. Rage gives way to the panic of a man trapped on a runaway train. \nPlasma screen \nThe news dissolves into a blur. \nMirror \nCris ages before his own eyes. Wrinkles etch into skin. Hair greys, recedes. Outrage ebbs into hollow resignation as Cris watches himself waste away. \nWoman's voice Sir...Sir? \nCris' tired old eyes look up, confused. \nINT. VEGAS HOTEL COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nA perky young WAITRESS stands over him, holding a pot of coffee. \nWAITRESS Warm-up? \nOn cris \nYoung again. \ndavis (o.c.) I guess. \nPull back: surveillance room \nFerris and DAVIS, the casino's dapper CHIEF OF SECURITY, stand behind Hawkeye, the Surveillance Supervisor, and study Cris on various monitors. \nFerris Maybe she's in cahoots. \ndavis He's beaten six dealers in a row. \nferriS You're sure he's not counting? \nhawkeye We've got five decks in the shoe. And he wins more off the top than the bottom. \ndavis Moves a lot from table to table. \nOn a monitor, Cris pockets some of his chips. \nhawkeye Keeps his stacks short. \nOn another monitor, A COCKTAIL WAITRESS takes orders from the players. \nWAITRESS What's your pleasure? \nCRIS Grand Dad, rocks. \nFerris What's his name? \ndavis (shrugs) Not staying here. Pays in cash. \nHawkeye We're running him through face check. \nAs Ferris watches Cris on the monitor, he becomes still and attentive, as if sensing danger. He squints a little, the way we do when we try to remember something. \nFerris Invite him for a drink. (remembers her manners) If you don't mind. \nINT. CASINO/BLACKJACK TABLE - DAY \nAs Cris signals for another card, TWO BLACK SUITS appear behind him. \nblack suit (o.S.) Sir, would you come with us, please. \nCris takes in their grim faces. Turns to see two more pairs of goons stationed nearby. \nSNAPBACK to: \nThirty seconds ago \nThe COCKTAIL WAITRESS approaches to take Cris' order. \nWAITRESS What's your pleasure? \nThis time, Cris hurriedly scoops all his chips into his coat pocket, jostling the Waitress as he stands. \nCRIS Scuse me, sorry. \nHustling away, he glances back just as the first TWO BLACK SUITS reach his stool, but this time it's empty. They look around. One of them whispers into his mike. The three pairs of goons get instructions and split up. \nTracking shot / eye level \nCris strides crisply through the casino. Sees another PAIR OF BLACK SUITS, scanning for him. He ducks into the maze of slots. Zigs and zags from aisle to aisle, seemingly at random. A moment after each turn, a Black Suit appears ahead, behind, or to the side - where they would have spotted Cris. \nTracking shot / high angle \nA clearer perspective as TWO BLACK SUITS approach Cris' aisle from different directions. Cris has no way to see them or know they're coming, but at the last moment, he MOVES in between two aisles where neither guard will see him as they pass. \nsurveillance room \nDavis and Hawkeye wince as the Black Suits keep missing their quarry. \ndavis What's wrong with you guys? \nhawkeye He's right next to you! Aisle 63! \nFerris watches the chase, fascinated. \nPhalanxes of slot machines \nBlack Suits converge from various directions, in that fake- calm fast-walk. \nCris studies the gamblers playing the machines nearby, then heads to a particular spot - where he is sure to be spotted - except that a TEXAS-SIZED MAN repositions himself, blocking the Black Suit's view. \nThe Black Suit moves on. Cris shifts to another spot just as a different Black Suit arrives at the other end of the aisle. This time, THREE FRAT BOYS change machines and obscure Cris from his gaze. \nsurveillance room \nDavis is throwing a fit. \nDavis There! There! He's right there in front of you! Walk toward each other! \nCris slips away in the shadow of the Frat Boys. \nhawkeye Maybe he's on our frequency. \nDAVIS I don't see an earphone on him. \nhawkeye He's heading to the Convention Annex. \nFERRIS (stands) Give me a headset. I'm going down there. \nConvention annex \nArriving at the foyer, Cris sees Five Meeting Rooms. He squints then decisively enters one of them. \nFOUR BLACK SUITS arrive an instant later. Without wasting a beat, each of them goes through a different door. All except the one Cris went through. \nCris re-emerges a moment later and heads back toward the casino. \nCasino \nFeRRIS That's because they're.... \nWISDOM Right. \nOuch. \nWISDOM I'm sorry, but they're right. \nFERRIS You bastard. \nWISDOM I care about you, and I wanted to support you. But there's a limit to what I can... \nFERRIS (professional) Look, we analyzed what this ability would look like if it existed. (MORE) \nFERRIS (cont'd) I went screening for it in a highly scientific way. And now I've identified someone who matches all the indicators. So the next obvious step is to... \nwisdom Let me do my job! - Christ! Don't you ever quit? \nFERRIS No. (beat) I've got a country to protect. \nHe finds her both infuriating and irresistible. \nWISDOM Use your charm on somebody else. \nHe stalks out of the room, leaving her more thwarted than sad. \nDRIVER'S POV: TRAFFIC IN VEGAS \nAn elevated freeway. Driving behind a pick-up truck carrying a mattress and box spring. \nCris (v.O.) I'm not God. I don't see everything. Just my own future. \nExt./INT. Cris' car - DAY \nCris drives an old Camaro, muscle-y but inconspicuous. \nCris (v.O.) To me, it seems normal. The way lightning comes before thunder. \nCris changes lanes to get from behind the truck. \nCRIS (V.O.) Most of the time, I'm not paying attention. Just making sure I don't step in a mess. \nIn his rearview mirror, Cris sees the mattress fall off the truck, causing an accident. \nCRIS (V.O.) Sometimes I get a blast from far away. \nHe sees a plume of smoke in the distance. \nCRIS (V.O.) Or I can start with a glimpse of something close and keep pushing on. \nHe takes the next exit. \nCRIS (V.O.) Usually it's none of my business. \nHe turns into the parking lot of a bookie shop, THE FINISH LINE. \nINT. The finish line - DAY \nCris walks to the counter. Addresses the manager. \nCRIS Guy around? \nMANAGER You are? \nCRIS Tell him it's King Midas. \nINT. homeland security regional hq - internal security office - DAY \nTERRY BAINES, plainclothed HEAD OF PROTECTIVE SERVICES for the Facility, walks down the corridor with three of the better-trained MILITARY POLICE who have been brought in to augment the regular staff of civilian FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE POLICE. Baines is a handsome former Special Forces Lieutenant, early-forties, who takes his work very seriously. Ferris runs to catch up with him. He doesn't slow down for her. \nFERRIS Terry? Terry! - I know you've got your hands full but I was wondering if you might be able to spare a few warm bodies for an outside operation. \nShe gives him a look. There's some mutual attraction, but not a lot of affection. \nBAINES We're strictly internal. \nFERRIS That's why I need your people. Everybody else is assigned. \nBAINES Does Wisdom know about this? \nFERRIS He suggested it. \nWhile Baines arches a dubious eyebrow, an intellectual junior analyst, AMANDA, catches up with Ferris. \nAMANDA Callie. (corrects herself) Agent Ferris. I've got a face match on your subject. His name is Cris Johnson. \nFerris takes Amanda's PRINTOUT and glances at it on the run: it's a PHOTO of Cris on a WANTED BULLETIN. \nfERRIS (slows to a stop) Never mind, Terry. Pretty Boy here is wanted for murder in Nevada. \nShe hustles off with Amanda. \nINT. BACK ROOM AT THE FINISH LINE - DAY \nA smoky office with a big screen tv and a poker table, but no card players. Cris is greeted by GUY, relaxed, professional, smartly dressed, mid-forties. He's classier than the joint he runs. \nGuy Well, if it isn't the Golden Man. \nA look, a hug. A lot of history. \nGuy What brings you crawling back to me? \nCRIS I need to cash some chips. - Got tagged. \nHe starts setting them in stacks on the poker table. \nGUY You burned through your stash already? \nCRIS I've been trying to lay low. \nINT. State police STATION - dAY \nCavanaugh pours coffee for himself and Ferris. \nCAVANAUGH He's just some gambler. Lives completely off the grid. No bank account. No credit cards. No previous record. \nFerris So why'd he do it? \nCAVANAUGH Must be a wacko. He'd never met the victim. No connection whatsoever. \nFerris tries to make sense of it all. \nfeRRIS And in fifteen months, why haven't you caught him? \nCavanaugh sighs woefully. \nCAVANAUGH You saw. He's got eyes in the back of his head. He can see around corners. I even had him in custody once, and he disappeared. \nFerris Must be very embarrassing. \nA painful subject for Cavanaugh. \nCAVANAUGH And what is it you want him for? \nFerris Questioning. \nCAVANAUGH About? \nFerris Stuff that hasn't happened yet. \nCavanaugh nods knowingly. \nCAVANAUGH Well, I guess Homeland Security trumps liquor store murder. How can I help? \nExt. Suburban home - las vegas - niGHT \nA tract house, cheap, from the 60's, could be anywhere. Something sad about the place. Cris stands at the door, holding a bag of groceries. IRV, a sick old man, opens the door, wearing a knit cap and pajamas. He's hooked up to a little oxygen tank on wheels. When he sees Cris, his smile crimps the tube in his nose. \nIRV What are you doing back here? \nCRIS I came to fix you dinner. \nIRV Idiot. \nIrv pulls Cris inside. Closes the door. \nINT. irv's house - night \nThey embrace like father and son. The oxygen tube gets in the way. \nIRV This is what you get from two packs a day. \nCrIS But you quit ten years ago. \nIRV It was already too late. I just didn't know it. \nCRIS Sometimes not knowing is better. \nIrv shakes his head. \nIRV Look where you're headed, pal. The big decisions are over before you even realize you made `em. \nINT. The finish line - back room - night \nCavanaugh and Ferris chat with Guy. This time the poker game is in progress. \nCaVANAUGH Any idea where he might be going? \nGuy turns to Ferris. \nGUY I've got a little problem with the IRS. Think I could get some relief? \nFERRIS Depends how helpful you are. \nGuY Oh, I know everything about him. \nHe looks at Ferris, knowing. She turns to Cavanaugh. \nFERRIS I need to speak to him alone. \nINT. FINISH LINE - MAIN PARLOR - NIGHT \nGuy and Ferris sip cappucino. \nGUY And another thing, no woman ever turns him down, I'm serious. Mainly because he only propositions the ones he knows'll say yes, which is most of `em anyway. But does that make him happy? No. Says he's bored. Never surprised. Has to watch himself die over and over again. \nFERRIS Why'd he come back to Vegas? \nGUY Didn't say, but I'm guessin' it's this friend who's dying. An old fart who took him in when he was strung out on drugs. - He's an orphan, ya know. Been on the road since he was ten. \nINT. Irv's house / living room - night \nThe place is a mess. Piles of newspapers. Old clothes. Cris cleans up as they talk. Irv sits at a table and plays solitaire. \nIRV You want my advice? Get yourself a good lawyer and turn yourself in. \nCRIS If I tell `em the truth, you know what happens? I end up with the Feds. - And you know what they do to me? \nIRV Make you a secret agent. \nCris Don't laugh. They strap me in a chair and make me watch the news. \nIRV Dan Rather or Peter Jennings? \nCRIS It's not funny, Irv. That's all I do, day after day, for the rest of my life. Watch the news until I lose my hair and croak. \nIrv is moved by Cris' dilemma. \nIrv There's no way around it? \nCRIS Trust me, it's better if I don't. It's better if I just mind my own business. \nFerris looks at him, disapproving. \nFERRIS I'll be honest with you, Cris. That's not an option. Your country needs you. And if we don't grab you, somebody else will. \nCRIS Nobody's grabbed me yet. \nFerris You're up against more powerful forces now. \nShe lets that sink in. \nFERRIS I'd like you to come with me for some testing. Would you be willing to do that? \nCris's expression grows dark. He looks at Ferris accusingly, then BOLTS away, toward the KITCHEN. \nFERRIS Where are you going? \nCris covers his eyes and dives to the floor as STUN GRENADES shatter windows and explode with a FLASH. \nFERRIS (temporarily blinded) Shit! Cavanaugh! \nGas grenades follow. \nCris scrambles to his feet as a NEVADA POLICE SWAT TEAM bursts through windows and doors, wearing gas masks and goggles, scanning with laser-guided rifles. They find Cris, dashing for the back door. Open fire. \nCris tumbles, dodges a few bullets, then takes a hit in the shoulder, the back, the leg. Staggers forward. Absorbs dozens of bullets. \nFalls. \nLies there. \nDying. \nCavanaugh steps up to deliver the final shot. \nSNAPBACK TO: \nINT. Irv's house / living room - an hour AGO \nIRV In that case, you've gotta leave the country. \nCRIS I know, I know, I've got the place picked out. But there's something I've gotta do first. \nIRV What? \nCris doesn't answer. His gaze is distant. \nIRV Cris? \nCris focuses. \nCRIS I have to go. \nIRV You just got here. \nCRIS I know, but they're coming for me. \nCris takes the pack of cash he got from Guy, pulls out more than half the bills, and sets them on a table. \nCRIS This is for nurses and stuff, to make things a little easier. \nIRV You're gonna need it. \nCris shakes his head and embraces Irv. \nCrIS You're the only one I could trust. Ever. \nThey're both choked up. \nIRV I don't suppose you've discovered any last minute escape for me? \nCRIS I looked, Irv, I really did. I went down every path, every treatment. Sometimes there's just no... \nIRV It's okay. It's okay...Now I can relax. \nA last look. \nExt. irv's street - dAY \nCris' approaches his parked Camaro with his key out. CAVANAUGH and SIX TROOPERS spring from hiding, guns trained on him. \nCamera pans to cris \nIn Irv's back yard, watching this scene. \nExt. ALLEY BEHIND IRV'S HOUSE - DAY \nA State Trooper keeps watch, smoking. When he steps on the butt, Cris enters the frame in the background. When the Trooper turns to a wall to piss, Cris crosses the alley, unseen. When Cris passes out of frame, the Trooper finishes, unaware of what he has missed. \nExt. outskirts of vegas - night \nA Route 66-vintage highway with stop lights and tawdry commercial development. Cris stands on the shoulder, thumbing a ride. Cars and trucks pass without stopping. \nFAST FOWARD through endless traffic until an OLD CHEVROLET pulls over. Cris checks his watch. It's 8:23. \nSnapback TO: \nSIDE OF THE ROAD \nChris checks his watch. It's 7:57. \nCris (to himself) Twenty-four minutes. \nHe looks around. Sees a donut shop. Heads toward it. \nINT. Irv's house - night \nCavanaugh's State Troopers, guns drawn, are searching the place on a hair-trigger, ready to blow away anything that moves. \nLIZ Great, what do I have to do? \nCRIS You don't have to do anything. \nCris glances outside and sees the old Chevrolet drive by without stopping. He checks his watch. It's 8:23. \nCRIS But I could use a ride. \nShe knows she shouldn't. \nINT. JEEP CHEROKEE / on highway - nIGHT \nGoing fast. Johnny Cash on the CD. \nLIZ When does the luck kick in? \nCRIS It already has. \nLIZ I don't feel anything. \nCRIS Not even a tingle? \nLIZ Son, I haven't had a tingle in eight months. \nHe waits for the other shoe to drop. \nLiz (can't hold it in) Since my worthless no-good dickhead of a husband ran out on me. \nCRIS Then you're way overdue. For a reversal of fortune. \nBrake lights flare on the cars ahead. They pass an exit. \nCRIS Any kids? \nLIZ Thirty. (off his look) I teach fifth grade. \nCRIS I mean of your own. \nShe shakes her head. \nCRIS I guess that's good. Considering. \nLIZ No, that was the problem. - I couldn't get pregnant. \nTraffic is backed up. \nCRIS I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. \nLIZ You didn't. I'm just running off at the mouth. - That's why I was in Vegas. To see another doctor. \nFlashing yellow lights - a barricade. Cris is getting nervous. \nCRIS He didn't want to adopt? \nLIZ No, he had to have a Randy Junior. \nFlashing blue lights - parked cop cars. \nLIZ What, is there an accident? \nThe place is crawling with state troopers. Cris is looking around for a way out. \nSnAPBACK TO: \none MINUTE EARLIER - one mile back \nLIZ When does the luck kick in? \nCRIS It already has. \nLIZ I don't feel anything. \nBrake lights flare on the cars ahead. \nCRIS (urgent) Take this exit. Quick! \nLIZ Why? \nCRIS Just take it! \nThe dotted lines on the road are now solid. \nLIZ It's too late! \nCRIS No it's not! \nCris grabs the steering wheel and jerks it to the right, sending them over some speed bumps onto the off ramp. \nLIZ Let go! Are you out of your mind?! \nShe slams on the brakes and they screech to a stop on the right shoulder of the exit ramp. \nLIZ Get out! \nCris scrambles for an explanation. Looks, sees a quieu of brake lights from the roadblock now backed up past the exit. \nCRIS Traffic was piling up. You didn't see it? \nLIZ GET OUT!! \nCRIS We could'a been stuck there for hours. \nLIZ I don't give a flyin' goddamn! You don't grab the steering wheel! \nCris pauses for a beat. Takes a different tack. \nCRIS You're right. I'm sorry. I panicked. I get phobic sitting in traffic. It won't happen again, I promise. \nLIZ Damn straight, cause you won't be in the car! \nLIZ Hey, George. \nBartender Hey, Liz. \nLIZ I'll take the usual and he'll have a... \nCRIS Sierra Pale. \nThe Bartender and Liz exchange a look. \nBartender Two Sierras. \nAs he draws two pints, the Bartender leans toward Liz. \nBartENDER Randy's been hanging around. \nLIZ He's not here now, is he? \nBartender nods toward the pool tables, where RANDY, her ex, plays 8-ball with a pal. \nLIZ Thanks. \nShe turns to Cris. \nLIZ We gotta split. My ex is here. \nCris lays some money on the bar, and they head for the door. But before they get there, Randy sees Liz and bounds after her, holding a pool cue. He's much bigger and taller than Cris. \nRandy I gotta talk to you, baby. \nLIZ Sure, Randy. I'll call you tomorrow. \nShe tries to slide by him. Randy blocks the way. \nRandy Bullshit. I've left a dozen messages on your phone. \nCris steps between them. \nCris Excuse me. We were just leaving. \nRandy And who the hell are you? \nCris stands his ground. Locks eyes. \nLiz Don't mess with him, Cris. He used to play hockey. \nCRIS Just a friend. \nRandy Then don't get between me and my woman. \nLIZ I'm not yours anymore, asshole! \nRandy Baby, I've made a terrible mistake, and I just want to undo all the... \nRandy holds Liz by the shoulders. \nliz Let go! \nRANDY You still care for me, I know it. \nLiz resists. Cris grips Randy's arm. \nCRIS Easy, man. \nRandy hauls off to slug Cris. Cris easily ducks the blow and answers with a solid punch to the belly. \nRandy recovers and realizes he's up against a skilled opponent. He takes a stance, ready to get serious. He sticks a few jabs at Cris, who easily slips from each one, like he saw them coming a mile away. Randy goes for a hook. Cris feints and lands an uppercut to Randy's chin. Most men would go down, but Randy is so big, he stays up to take more punishment. \nCris delivers an elegant beating that humiliates the big guy and makes him look like an oaf. Cris puts an end to it by breaking Randy's nose. The big guy falls to his knees, bleeding. \nLiz rushes to Randy's side, holding her ex and glowering up at Cris like he's a sadistic brute. \nLIZ Get out of here! Get out! \nCris realizes he's blown it. \nSNAPBACK TO: \nMOMENTS BEFORE \nRANDY You still care for me, I know it. \nLiz resists. Cris grips Randy's arm. \nCRIS Easy, man. \nRandy hauls off to slug Cris, who this time makes no effort to duck. WHAM! Cris takes a sledgehammer in the mouth. Randy follows up mercilessly, punching Cris in the gut, then holding him up while he punches him again. \nLiz grabs Randy's arm. \nLIZ Stop it, Randy! Stop it! \nRandy flings her aside and finishes up   with a solid right to Cris' jaw, that puts him on the floor.   Randy pulls back his leg for a pointy-booted cowboy kick to   the ribs, when Liz rushes to Cris' side and glowers up at   Randy like he's a sadistic brute. \nLIZ Get out of here! Get out! \nRandy realizes he's blown it -- and lets himself be pulled out of the bar by a couple of buddies. \nLiz examines Cris with concern. \nLIZ Oh God, I'll take you to the emergency room. \nCRIS No ho'pital. I don' nee' ho'pital. \nLIZ God, I hate that bastard...Will somebody get some ice! \nShe strokes Cris' hair. \nExt. Liz's cottage - night \nPOLICEMAN RICK She's quite a challenge. \nEXT. PARK - daY \nLiz and Cris, still walking, holding hands. \nLIZ I swear, I can't figure you out. \nCRIS Believe me, the feeling is mutual. \nLIZ Sometimes you seem mindlessly impulsive. But other times I feel like you're utterly calculating, saying exactly what you think'll push my buttons. \nCRIS What do you mean? \nLIZ Don't you think it's kind of an amazing coincidence that neither of us can have kids? \nCRIS You want to talk to my doctor? I'll get him on the phone. No, really, I mean it. I'll have him send you my records. Because I want you to trust me. \nHe seems so sincere that she dismisses her concerns. \nLIZ Then open up. Talk to me. Where are you going with your life? \nCris seems unprepared for the question. \ncrIS Wherever it takes me. \nLiZ You never think about the future? \nCRIS All the time. - But mainly how to stay out of trouble. \nLIZ No goals? Dreams? Ambitions? \nCRIS There's only one thing I've ever wanted. \nLIZ What's that? \nCRIS A family. \nShe seems disappointed. \nLIZ That's all? Just a family? \nCRIS Well, I was, as they say, left on a doorstep when I was two. (makes light of it) Never found foster parents who could put up with me. - So to me, a family sounds like plenty. \nThat certainly pressed her buttons again. \nLIZ You've got to be making this up. \nCRIS I wish. \nShe rests her head on his shoulder. \nLIZ You poor guy. \nExt. Hillside overlooking park - DAY \nStill watching Cris and Liz as the couple get into her car. \nCAVANAUGH I say we get the whole department up here and bust his ass. \nFerris And by that time, his ass'll be long gone. \nCAVANAUGH Then why won't he see through your trap? \nFerris takes a deep breath. \nFerris Let's try this one more time. \next. old SHOPPING CENTER - daY \nGrocery, drug store, hardware, gas station. Liz and Cris get out of her Jeep. He heads for the grocery store. \nLIZ I'll meet you inside. I need to pick something up at the drug store. \nThey split up. \nExt. Across the street - unmarked car - DAY \nFerris, Cavanaugh, and Policeman Rick watch the couple go their separate ways. Ferris gets out. \nFERRIS Stay in the car. If he sees your shadow, he won't take the bait. \nCaVANAUGH We hear you. \nFerris I'm serious. This guy can smell your farts before you even eat the beans. \nrick Miss, I won't even think about beans. \nFerris gets out of the car. Cavanaugh and Rick stay put. \nRick Sounds like a crock to me. \nCAVANAUGH You haven't been chasing him for three years. \nINT. DrugSTORE - DAY \nLiz is in the female department, trying to choose between various brands when Ferris approaches. \nFerris Miss Cooper. \nLIZ Yes? \nFERRIS Agent Ferris. \nFerris shows her badge. Homeland Security. Liz, frightened, is ready to listen. \nINT. Drug store - dAY \nFerris and Liz huddle in a quiet corner. Liz is in shock from what she has just heard. \nLIZ Yeah. \nCRIS No. I think we're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the Big Bang. \nLIZ That's not very romantic. \nCRIS Oh, but it is. Think of it: For us to meet, everything from the very beginning, every sub-atomic event, every galactic cataclysm, every step of evolution, every act, every accident, every decision in the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and I could be together, right here and now. \nShe is moved by his words, but they make her strangely sad. \nCris pours two glasses of Scotch. Hands one to Liz. \nCRIS To whatever happens next. \nShe doesn't drink. \nLIZ I shouldn't. \nCRIS (concerned) Why? \nLIZ I'm late. \nCRIS Late? \nLIZ That's why I went to the drug store. To get a pregnancy test. \nOff his puzzlement, she hands him a small plastic tab. \nA SQUARE CROSS is coming into focus. \nHe recognizes the image from the Donut Shop display case just before he met Liz for the first time. \nLIZ You know what this means? \nCRIS I do now. \nThey look at each other, equally perplexed. \nLIZ How did it...? \nCRIS I have no idea. Unless...But that still doesn't explain... \nShe struggles to make sense of it. \nCRIS Liz, I really did have this problem. I wasn't lying to you. \nHe can't read her reaction. \nCRIS But this is good. This is amazing. I want this baby more than anything. \nShe looks at him, emotional. \nLIZ It's like a miracle. \nCRIS For both of us. \nShe lets him hold her. \nEXT. AROUND THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT \nState Troopers are camped out in two's and three's. Fifty of them. Plus Baines' SIX MP's, wearing different uniforms. \nINT. cabin - Bedroom - night \nLiz and Cris in bed. Her head on his chest. This time he's the one sleeping while she lies awake. \nExt. STAKEOUT SITE - NIGHT \nFerris and Baines sip coffee and wait. They find each other attractive. \nbaines Think she'll come through? \nFerris shakes her head with certainty. \nFERRIS Women hate good-looking men. Rejecting them makes us feel powerful. \nBaines And that's more important than love? \nFERRIS No. But she doesn't really love him. \nINT. cabin - Bedroom - night \nLiz eases away from Cris, trying not to wake him. He stirs...but settles back into slumber. She slithers out of bed and tiptoes to the bathroom. Silently closes the door behind her. \nINT. Bathroom - night \nLiz stands there in the dark, heart pounding. She sees that the window is open. She looks at it, deciding. \nINT. cabin - DAY \nThe morning sun on Cris' sleeping face. His foot slides in search of Liz. Not finding her, he opens his eyes. Checks the clock. 10:09 AM. \nCriS Liz... Liz? \nNo answer. He walks to the bedroom door. \nLocked. He tries to force it. Won't budge. \nTries the window. Bars across it - that weren't there before. Shakes them. Solidly bolted. Looks outside. No one's around. He's about to shout, but stops himself. \nRuns into the bathroom. Bars over that window, too. As he stands there, trapped, Ferris steps into view outside. \nFERRIS Surprise. \nSnapback TO: \nINT. Cabin - night \nCris' eyes flash open in bed. Liz isn't there. \nShe gathers her courage and steps to the open window. \nStakEOUT SITE \nEveryone is coiled, waiting for Ferris to give the word. Cavanaugh is on the radio with his men, ready to pass it on. \nFerris takes a last look through the nightvision binoculars. That's when Liz climbs awkwardly out of the bathroom window in her bathrobe. \nFerris She's coming now. (to Cavanaugh) We stay put. Tell them. \nCAVANAUGH (disappointed, via radio) We stand pat till notified. Don't make a sound. \nWhen Liz is out of the cabin, Ferris activates the remote control. \nALL AROUND THE CABIN \nDoors lock and bars slide into place almost inaudibly. \nStakEOUT SITE \nFerris shines a flashlight toward Liz, on off. She heads in the general direction of the light, but stops BEHIND A THICK- TRUNKED OAK TREE, which blocks her from their view. \nBEHIND THE OAK tree \nCris backs out from under Liz's robe. \nStakEOUT SITE \nFerris, Cavanaugh, Baines, and Rick shine their flashlights on the oak tree, waiting for Liz to reappear. \nFERRIS What's she waiting for? \nLiz steps into view from behind the oak tree. Ferris shines the light towards her again. She heads straight toward them. \nON LIZ \nAs predicted, the hem of her robe gets caught in the thorns. She tries to pull free, but she's stuck. \nStakEOUT SITE \nFerris and Baines wade into the thicket to extricate her. \nAmong the thorns \nFerris and Baines reach Liz. \nFerris You've done your country a great service. \nThe predicted words hit her hard. \nLIZ Then why do I feel like a traitor? \nFerris and Baines free her and lead her up the hill. \nBEHIND THE OAK TREE \nCris scurries away, using the sound of their rustling to cover his escape. \next. Forest - night \nCris scurries near a trio of STATE TROOPERS. He steps on a twig which SNAPS loudly. PAN BACK to find a SECOND CRIS approaching down the same path. Cris 1 dissolves as Cris 2 steps around the twig and continues undetected. \nA few steps on, Cris 2 slips on mud and slides noisily down a slope. PAN BACK to find CRIS 3, who detours onto stepping stones then rejoins the original path, undetected. \nSTAKEOUT SITE \nBaines and Ferris help Liz back to their camp. \nFerris Rick, get her some coffee. \nLiz pulls the note from her robe pocket and reads Cris' handwriting: \"Then why do I feel like a traitor?\" \nCAVANAUGH (relays a message) We've got movement in the canyon. (to radio) Where are you? \nA flashlight shines up at Cavanaugh from the canyon. \nFerris and Baines scan their infra-red scopes at the area. \nFERRIS' INFRARED POV: \nA hot human shape hurries over rough terrain with stealthy urgency. \nBACK TO SCENE \nFerris and Baines looking through their scopes. \nbAINES She told him. \nCAVANAUGH We tried it your way. \nFerris Go for it. But I want him alive. \nCavanaugh picks up the radio with evident satisfaction. \nCAVANAUGH Boys, now it's our turn. \nFIFTY SEARCHLIGHTS BLAZE ON and stab through the forest. \nFERRIS I want him alive. Tell them. \nCaVANAUGH (afterthought, to radio) And the Feds want him alive. \nFerris urgently takes Baines aside. \nFerris We need to get to him first. \nTROOPERS \nSpread out through the steep terrain. SEARCHLIGHT BEAMS sweep over the landscape. \nSNAPBACK TO: \nCris rushes the Third Trooper, who hesitates, frightened, then shoots -- and misses. Cris charges up to him, knocks his shooting arm away, takes his weapon, uses him a shield, then fires at a Fourth Trooper as he charges out from the trees. It's Cavanaugh, now covered in blood. \nSnaPBACK TO: \nCris uses Trooper Three as a shield, but when Cavanaugh comes charging from the trees, Cris DOESN'T FIRE. Instead he shoves Trooper Three at Cavanaugh, sending them both tumbling down a slope. \nStakEOUT SITE \nAnother setback. \nBAINES Damn. Fifty men might not be enough. \nFERRIS Somehow we've got to bring him down to our level. \nBaINES Got any ideas? \nFERRIS I'm workin' on it. \nIN THE FOREST \nCris crosses a ridge that leads him into steep ravine. He can't get back up. \nStakEOUT SITE \nBaines and Ferris listen to the police band. Liz stands nearby. She can hear the patter. \nBAINES He's crossed over into Maxwell Gorge. \nFERRIS Move in fast. Keep him moving. Don't let him rest. \nThen it hits her. \nFERRIS Don't give him time to look ahead. That's the key. \nEXT. MAXWELL GORGE - NIGHT \nSlowly making his way through the steep redwood-covered slopes, Cris hears a NOISE. Looks up. Sees a STATE POLICE SUV CRASHING down the cliff across the Gorge. \nSNAPBACK TO: \nMAXWELL GORGE - NOW \nCris, catching his breath against a redwood, opens his eyes and looks back toward his approaching pursuers. He looks around the gorge, searching for the cliff where he FORESAW the SUV come crashing down. He recognizes the rock formations across the gorge. He heads in that direction. PAN UP and we see that the cliff is directly under the... \nStakEOUT SITE \nBaines steps closer to the edge and looks down. \nBAINES He's heading this way. \nFerris, suddenly confident, shouts into the radio. \nfeRRIS Cavanaugh! We've got a fox hunt going in Maxwell Gorge, right beneath the stakeout. Throw everybody into it! We need to overload him! \nLiz looks around for some way to help. She spots the State Police SUV that we saw crashing down the hillside. She sidles toward it. \nMAXWELL GORGE \nThirty Troopers and Six MP's are converging on Cris. \nFerrIS (o.c.) Gentlemen, if he surrenders, fine, cuff him. But if he even shivers, shoot to kill. \nStakEOUT SITE \nLiz opens the door of the SUV, shifts into neutral, and starts pushing. - It's too heavy to budge. \nMAXWELL GORGE \nCris moves toward a field of LARGE BOULDERS. \nStakEOUT SITE \nSlowly, with great effort, Liz gets the SUV to inch forward. \nMAXWELL GORGE \nTroopers and MP's are closing in on Cris. \nCaVANAUGH (megaphone) Lie down on your stomach, hands behind your head! You've got ten seconds. Ten seconds and we shoot. \nCris climbs in among the large boulders, glances up, and waits for the future to happen. \nStakEOUT SITE \nLiz gets the SUV onto a slight downslope, and it picks up speed. \nBaines and Ferris see the SUV rumbling straight toward them. They dive out of the way as the SUV plunges over the ledge. \nMAXWELL GORGE \nTroopers and MP's are advancing toward Cris, about to open fire. \nCAVANAUGH This is your last warning. \nThirty Troopers and MP's have their fingers on the trigger when the SUV sails over the ledge and plummets straight down towards them. Cris crouches down among the boulders just as the SUV crashes on top of him, then tumbles toward his hunters, who scatter. \nCris makes a run for it just as the SUV explodes in a fireball. \nSTAKEOUT SITE \nFerris and Baines watch the events below. \nfERRIS Keep after him! Quick! Stay on him! \nWhile they are distracted, Liz climbs into the front seat of RICK'S POLICE CRUISER, cranks it up, slams into reverse, spins, and takes off down the road. \nbaines What the...? \nAs a Federal Chopper idles, Ferris marks up a ROAD MAP of the area with X's. \nFERRIS (to radio) Cavanaugh, get all your men into town. (waits) Cavanaugh? Tell them. \nBaines approaches. \nBaINES He's dead. Crashed. \nFerris winces, then moves on like a general in battle. \nFERRIS You take command of the chase. (hands him the map) Have cars block these intersection. \nShe heads over to the copter. \nBAINES Why these? \nFERRIS Get in the chopper. \nHe follows her inside, and the copter takes off. \nMOUNTAIN ROAD \nCris takes blind curves at high speed. \nCRIS Did the doctors ever say why you couldn't have kids? \nLIZ I grew up at Love Canal. \nCRIS What's that? \nLIZ A neighborhood back East built over a chemical dump. A bunch of my friends had birth defects. (looks back) I always figured I was lucky just to be sterile. \nCRIS Except you're not. And neither am I. We're different, that's all. We just had to find the right match. \nA look between them. \nLIZ And somehow we did. \nThey approach the entrance to the town. \nEXT. hendersonville - DAWN \nPolice vehicles converge on the area, systematically blocking the intersections that Ferris indicated. \nRick's Police Cruiser \nCris threads his way through town, zigging and zagging down streets and alleys. \nFROM THE HELICOPTER \nFerris sees Cris maneuvering perfectly through the maze, avoiding imminent traps and confrontation. \nBAINES (discouraged) He doesn't miss a beat. \nFERRIS (pleased, to herself) Come to momma. \nCris dodges another trap. \nFERRIS (to radio) Stay after him. Keep the pressure on. \nThe bypassed police cars chase after Rick's stolen Cruiser, which leaves town on a street that merges with a WINDY NARROW CANYONSIDE ROAD. \nBAINES (incredulous) He's driving right into it... \nUp ahead, beyond a blind curve, the road leads to a ONE-LANE BRIDGE over a DEEP CHASM with RAGING RAPIDS at the bottom. \nBAINES Sometimes looking one step ahead isn't enough. \nOn the FAR SIDE OF THE BRIDGE, out of sight, beyond a curve, EIGHT STATE POLICE CARS form a barricade across the road. \nINT. Rick's Police Cruiser - DAY \nHaving escaped from town, Cris and Liz share a glimmer of relief. \nLIZ You make it look easy. \nCris' expression darkens. \nCRIS Oh shit. Oh no. \nLiz What is it? \nCRIS I blew it. \nThey round a curve and the NARROW BRIDGE comes into view. \nFAR SIDE OF BRIDGE \nBehind the barricade, Ferris' helicopter comes in for a landing. \nINT. Rick's Police Cruiser - DAY \nCris checks his rearview mirror. A six-pack of cop cars are right behind him. To his left, a steep rock wall. To his right, a vertical drop-off into the canyon. \nCris drives on, the blood draining from his face. \nFAR SIDE OF THE BRIDGE \nFerris strides across the span, Baines in her wake. Arriving at the barricade, she approaches the biggest state police car, a HUMMER -- and flashes her badge. \nFERRIS I need your vehicle. \nShe walks through the Trooper and gets into his Hummer. \nBAINES What's the plan? \nFERRIS Playing chicken. \nBAINES Don't be stupid! He knows what you'll do! \nFERRIS I don't want to find out. \nBaines speaks to Cris via loudspeaker. \nBaines Both wrists! \nOn the rock \nCris, defeated, attaches the second cuff to his other wrist. He is lifted up into the air, hanging by both arms. \nBridge \nLiz sits, handcuffed, in the back of a second U.S. Government helicopter. Ferris approaches. \nFERRIS I was wrong about one thing. He is capable of love. \nHELICOPTER \nDescends, with Cris hanging below by a cable. MP's are waiting below with a tarp which they wrap around Cris, then tape him like a mummy, up to his neck. When he's bound as securely as Hannibal Lecter, Ferris steps close and gets her first good look at him. \nFerris Cris Johnson, we meet at last. \nCRIS Why does everybody have amnesia but me? \nFERRIS I only ask one thing from you. Give me a chance to earn your trust. \ncris I did, and you failed. \nShe seems genuinely surprised. \nFERRIS Then give me another chance. You get `em all the time. \nShe signals and Cris is dumped into the waiting helicopter. The door is slammed behind him. \nINT. helicopter - DAY \nInside, Cris is surprised to find himself alone with Liz. He edges closer so they can hear each other. \nCRIS Don't let them know you're pregnant. \nThe helicopter takes off. \nCrIS You don't have to raise him. But at least let him be born. Can you do that? It might be the only chance either of us gets. \nLIZ I promise. \nThey gaze at each other with intense longing. \nLIZ Work with them Cris. So we can be together. \nHe shakes his head, fatalistic. \nCRIS I'll get us out of here. We can still make the plane. \nShe knows it's hopeless. \nExt. HOMELAND SECURITY - VEGAS OFFICE - DAY \nComing into view by air. \next. HOMELAND SECURITY - MEDICAL LAB - DAY \nMED TECHS perform a battery of tests on Cris and Liz. Wisdom, Baines, and Ferris watch through glass in an adjoining room. \nWisdom Are you out of your mind? Did you ever play chicken before? \nFERRIS This game was different. He knew I wouldn't flinch. \nBaines covertly makes the \"big balls\" gesture with two clawed hands. Wisdom nods knowingly. \nbaINES What's new with the Code Orange? \nWISDOM It's red now. And we're out of leads. \nfERRIS Then you better hope he's what I say he is. \nWISDOM Please, make me a believer. \nWHITE VESTIBULE \nSize of an elevator. Cris stands there, bound ankle and wrist. Click, the metal shackles open automatically and drop to the floor. \nCris reaches down for them. Possible weapon. Struggles to lift them. Can't. \nFERRIS (o.c.) Electromagnets. \nINT. Observation room - daY \nFerris, Baines, and Wisdom peer down into the White Vestibule through a window. Technicians operate a control panel. \nWiSDOM Aren't you being a little over- cautious? \nFERRIS Not possible with him. \nShe leans forward, flips a toggle. Down below, in the Vestibule, a door slides open. \nFERRIS Cris, please step into the next room. \nWHITE VESTIBULE \nCris gives up on the chains and sullenly steps forward. \nWHITE ROOM \nSize of a squash court. Cris enters gingerly and peers around. Twenty feet up, an OBSERVATION WINDOW, opaque. On the other walls, RIFLE BARRELS poke through NARROW SLITS. The door slides shut behind him. \nObservation room \nFerris leans forward and speaks. \nFerris ON MONITOR (severe) Now sit in the chair. One. Two. Three. \nFerris switches the toggle. The sizzle of electricity. \nCris hops and jumps in agony. \nFerris turns away, then makes herself look. \nWISDOM Whoa, you are one tough bitch. \nFERRIS We're still in a Code Red if I'm not mistaken. \nShe turns off the juice. \nWISDOM He knew he'd get shocked, but he chose to resist. \nFERRIS He's almost never had to face consequences. (flips toggle) Cris, are you ready to get in the chair? \nCris, recovering, shoots her the finger. \nShe switches the toggle again - and leaves it on. Wisdom doesn't have the stomach to watch. \nFERRIS We need information, right? \nCris collapses, unconscious. \nFERRIS Leave him there. We'll start again when he recovers. \nINT. Wisdom's office - DAY \nWisdom and Ferris are both traumatized by the torture. \nWISDOM Okay, how do we use him to find the bombs? \nFERRIS Simple. We make him watch the news and tell us about it. \nWISDOM How far ahead can he see? \nFERRIS I don't know. But I suspect we can increase his range with practice. Especially if we restrict his future to only watching news. Then he'll be like a timescope. \nWisdom nods. \nWISDOM You were right. This is huge. \nFERRIS This is just for starters. You want to stage a pre-emptive strike, he can tell you if you'll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong. And you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin. \nWisdom chuckles at the enormity of the potential. \nwisDOM And all he's ever done with it is a little gambling and securities fraud? \nFeRRIS I know, it's amazing; but he's not ambitious. \nWiSDOM Damn, how will we control this guy when he figures out what he's capable of? \nFerris We control him now. We just have to keep it that way. \nWISDOM Right now, sweetheart, we can't even get him to sit in a chair. \nDread suddenly washes over Wisdom. \nWISDOM We've got to think this through. Your friend could be more dangerous than the terrorists. \nFerris Aren't you running ahead of yourself? \nWISDOM With this guy, you have to. Or it'll be over before it begins. \nFerris So we'll keep him in chains. \nWISDOM That may not be enough. We may have to cut off his arms and legs. Then I might start to feel safe. \nFerris grins uncomfortably. \nFerris You're not serious. \nWISDOM Think about it. What we're talking about here is the next step in human evolution. And I'm not gonna make the same mistake the Neanderthals made when they ran across this good-looking Homo Sapien fellow and all the lady Neanderthals said, \"He's so cute. Let's keep him around.\" \nFERRIS Can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time? \nWISDOM You mean after it's too late? \nFerris seems to come around to Wisdom's logic. \nFerris I wish you'd given me a chance to chain him up before you decided to prune him into a stump. \nThey are both filled with dread. \nwisdom You think he knows? Already? \nwhite room \nCris on the floor. His expression hardens. \nCorrIDORS \nFerris and Wisdom stride through the facility almost at a run. \nWiSDOM I haven't made any firm decisions. Maybe we will just keep him tied up. \nFERRIS I told you, he doesn't read minds. He sees the results. \nWHITE ROOM \nCris rises from the floor into a crouched position, like an animal ready to pounce. \nThe door flies open and A DOZEN ARMED MP's charge in, rifles at the ready, and surround Cris. Cris checks the time on the digital clock. It's 5:12 PM. \nCorridors \nFerris and Wisdom getting closer; he's on a cellphone. \nBaines gives the signal and the dozen waiting MP's charge in through the door, rifles at the ready. The foreseen attack is now beginning in real time. \nINT. White room \nThe MP's surround Cris, as foreseen. He remains in the center of them, crouched, motionless. \nFor a long beat, they just stand there, rifles aimed at their frozen quarry. \nwiSDOM (plasma screen) Cris, don't you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us? Your ability could save so many lives. \nCris suddenly attacks...and with perfect economy of movement, like a diver executing thirteen twists in the second before he hits the water, Cris executes the previous routine with a new \"finale\" and... \nElegantly slips past all the MP's into the hall - and slams the door behind him, locking them in! \nThe escape has the quality of magic. It takes a beat for the MP's to realize what has happened. \noBSERVATION BOOTH \nWisdom and Ferris are agog. \nwISDOM What happened? - You idiots! \nFerris draws her gun and charges down the stairs. \nOUTSIDE white room \nCris is waiting for her and somehow he has her gun in his hand. \nCrIS Don't make me do what I can do. \nCris spins and shoots Wisdom in the shin as he starts down the stairs. Wisdom collapses. \nCRIS Don't get too attached to your arms and legs. \nCris spins and gets the drop on Baines. \nCrIS Don't. \nBaines sets down his gun. Cris takes off. \nWISDOM Don't let him out of here alive. \nBaines opens the door to the White Room. MP's stampede out in hot pursuit. \nbaINES Isolate the building. If there's one exit overlooked, he'll know it. \nFERRIS If there's one soft heart, one slow shooter, he'll know it. \nFerris attends to Wisdom, bleeding on the stairs. \nFeRRIS Don't worry. I caught him once; I'll catch him again. \nWISDOM Be careful. I don't want anything to happen to you. \nThey care about each other more than they've let on. \ncorridors \nCris. Running. MP's and general Security Police close behind. No place to hide. Soldiers open fire. Cris dives for the floor, tumbles, gets to his feet, serpentines, and ends up behind a door that opens at the moment, as if by mental command, shielding him from gunfire. \nSecurity Police pour out from the other side. Cris reaches around and grabs someone's gun. He opens fire, buying himself enough cover to get to a doorway. \nCris stops, thinks, then charges out shooting, fighting, running -- completing a condensed burst of four impossible tasks that get him to the next point of refuge. \nHe waits, thinks, charges and, with another burst of choreographed action, makes it into an elevator whose doors conveniently open at that moment. He darts inside, keeps shooting, presses certain buttons - starting several stories up, and waits for the doors to close. \nSergeant You five, up. You five, down. The rest stay with me. \nINT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nBanks of monitors, each containing a grid of mini-frames containing the pov of a surveillance camera -- hundreds in all. LEO, the Soldier at the console, is twitchy and hyper- alert. \nLeo watches as the Security Forces split up. He scans the monitors to see where Cris will resurface. \nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY \nCris climbs up through the ceiling panel. \nINT. Elevator shaft - DAY \nWhen the elevator stops, he rips open a VENTILLATION DUCT and climbs inside. \nOUTSIDE WHITE ROOM \nDR. FIELDING approaches Wisdom with a syringe. \nWISDOM No demerol. I need to be alert. \nFERRIS Get him a local. \nAmanda, Ferris' junior analyst, rushes in with lab reports. \namanda You asked for these as soon as they were ready. \nFERRIS Not now. \namanda You might want to check this result. \nShe points to a particular page. Impatient, Ferris reads. Her eyes widen. \nFeRRIS How pregnant? \namanda A few days. \nFerris turns to Wisdom. \nFERRIS This is getting interesting. We have a mating pair. \nWISDOM Secure the female. \nAt one dim exit, he lies on the ground, charred and dead, next to the gauntlet of MP's he has tried to outrun. \nWisdom's office \nWisdom and Baines are looking at each other, appalled, then turn to Ferris. \nWISDOM You want me to threaten to kill a pregnant woman? \nFERRIS Threats don't count. When he foresees that you actually did kill her, that she's dead... (beat) He won't let it happen. - He'll come to us. Surrender. And she'll live. \nWisdom regards her with perverse admiration. \nFERRIS But it only works if we're not bluffing. Because he'll know. \nWisdom considers the decision that lies ahead for him. \nINT. NEAR THE LOBBY - DAY \nCris is still trying to get out the front door, but there's one Soldier, call him CRACK SHOT, who kills Cris repeatedly. Cris snapsback and tries various tactics, but he can't get past Crack Shot alive. \nHe gives up. Turns and runs back into the heart of the building. \nCris' mental pov expands to include the entire facility, like a crystal doll house. Simultaneously, he is observing every room, present in every room, charting the place, testing possible actions. \nThe facility is a bee hive of activity. A bee hive that accelerates to fast forward -- until all times are simultaneous. Until the simultaneous activity is made even denser by the accumulated layers of possibility. \nCris-134 spies Ferris and Wisdom walking together. He follows them for a while, until he is discovered. Cris-134 fades out. The Ferris and Wisdom who saw him fade out. But another Ferris and Wisdom continue through the building, and their trail gets picked up by Cris-62, who has detoured in order to encounter them. \nAs Cris' goals are accomplished, superfluous versions of himself fade away. \nThe surveillance of a sequence of Ferris-and-Wisdoms is continued by Cris-91, then Cris-14, who watches as Wisdom and Ferris approach two guards standing outside an INTERROGATION ROOM. We recognize them as the MP's who are guarding Liz, inside. Wisdom is let into the Interrogation Room by the MP's. Ferris proceeds into a nearby office alone. \nSnaPBACK TO: \nvENTILLATION duct \nCris comes out of his trance. Checks his watch. Sixteen minutes have passed. \nCris composes his thoughts, takes a breath, then crawls forward, leaving no Cris behind. Now it's for real. \nA moment after he rounds a corner, A FLASHLIGHT BEAM stabs into the duct that he vacated. It scans around. Withdraws. \nNOTE: \nThe situations that Cris has just previewed from the Ventillator Shaft constitute the raw material that he will now re-craft into a single narrative: the story of his actual escape attempt, staged in long takes, unfolding in almost- real time. When appropriate, to illustrate Cris' ability, we will portray several locations simultaneously via split- screens which change in number, size, shape, and placement. \nINT. HANDYMAN'S STOREROOM - DAY \nCeiling. The ventillator grill pops open. Cris drops to the floor. He grabs a backpack conveniently hanging on a hook. Without the slightest hesitation, he goes from shelf to box to drawer, loading particular objects into the backpack. \nCORRIDOR \nEmpty. A door opens. Cris steps out into the hall carrying the backpack and a foot stool. He stays close to a wall, steps on the foot stool, and spray-paints over the lens of a surveillance camera. \nSURVEILLANCE ROOM \nLeo spots Cris as he blinds one camera after another. \nLeo I've got him. Third level, building C. Pete, Brian, get up there. Kyle, block off the west staircase. Jason, bring your dogs in from the east. \nCORRIDOR \nSOLDIER PETE and SOLDIER BRIAN charge into an empty corridor and begin their search for Cris. \nA door slams open, bashing Pete in the face. Cris breaks his shooting arm, grabs his M-16, hides behind the door, and sprays bullets low, hitting Brian in the shins. He runs to Brian, breaks his shooting arm, takes his rifle. Drags Brian and Pete into an open room. Tapes their mouths. \nSURVEILLANCE ROOM \nBaines arrives and takes command. \nLeo He was on third level seventy seconds ago. \nBaINES But where is he now? \nINT. WEST STAIRWELL - DAY \nCris pours floor polish in specific places. \nSOLDIER KYLE and his TROOP charge out off the stairwell. Each one steps directly into the polish and slips. \nAs they fall, Cris punches them out or puts them in chokeholds, utilizing the elegant minimum of force or violence. Child's play. As soon as they are unconscious, Cris takes their guns, tear gas, and a gas mask. \nCORRIDOR \nSOLDIER JASON and THREE TROOPS are on the way, each with a GUARD DOG. \nANOTHER CORRIDOR \nCris lies in wait for the patrol. When they appear, he is perfectly placed to mace each dog and each soldier with a quick spritz. He goes back and sprays them again, to keep them out of commission. \nSurveillance room \nCris appears on several screens. \nLEO He's on this floor!...Shit! He's coming here! \nThe door opens. A tear gas canister flies in. A moment later, Cris charges in wearing a gas mask. \nHe opens fire at the video monitors, shattering every one. \nBy the time the MP's are ready to respond, Cris reaches and grabs Baines' handgun. He swings out into the corridor with Baines' gun in his hand...Without looking, his hand aims and shoots several times. \nCORRIDOR \nEmerging into the hallway, Cris looks down at the end of the hall and sees two MP's falling to the floor, wounded. \nCris wraps electrical tape around the door handle and a pipe on the wall, sealing the room shut, then turns and maces the last of the dogs. \nSURVEILLANCE ROOM \nSoldier He's heading this way. \nCORRIDOR \nCris charges out of the stairwell, shooting without hesitation - forward, left, right, back - efficiently targeting Security Police in the precise order of their imminent readiness to fire at him. For each bullet, one soldier dies. \nWisdom's voice comes over the P.A. System. \nWiSDOM (o.S.) Johnson, this is Wisdom. It's 5:55. You have five minutes to turn yourself in... \nCris and Ferris keep moving. \nWisdom (o.S.) Or your worst nightmare will happen. \nCris marches right up to the Interrogation Room where Wisdom holds Liz prisoner, using Ferris as a human shield. \nWisDOM (o.S.) Look ahead if you don't believe me. \nCris opens the door to the room, revealing Wisdom, Ferris, and thirty Security Police and MP's - who take aim at him and fire. Cris gets chopped to pieces. \nSnAPBACK TO: \nCris crouches on the floor outside the Interrogation Room, reaches up and opens the door. He gets off a shot at Wisdom, who lives long enough to put a bullet in Liz's heart. \nSnAPBACK TO: \nCris uses Ferris as a shield, gets off a burst of shots at Wisdom, killing him instantly. \nBut a Soldier at Wisdom's side puts a bullet in Liz's heart -- then the thirty Security personnel blast Cris and Ferris to pieces. \nSnAPBACK TO: \nSTAIRCASE - ONE MINUTE EARLIER \nCris, dragging Ferris, arrives at the level of the Interrogation Room and continues down one more flight. \nUsing Ferris as a human shield, he shoots his way into... \nINT. FORENSIC LAB - DAY \nWhere Cris previously saw the seized barrel of C4 Explosive. He guns down several armed MP's whom he knows would be present, then threatens the technicians. \nCRIS Get out! \nThey flee. Cris locks himself and Ferris inside. \nCris goes over to the bomb. Squints for a beat. IN FAST FORWARD, CONDENSED TIME, MULTIPLE SNAPBACK, he goes through the whole learning curve on bomb detonation, blowing himself up - and snapping back to life -- several times before figuring out the right way to set it off. \nINTERROGATION ROOM \nWisdom holds Liz at arm's length with his gun pointed at her head.

Then clearing. \nThe center of the building \nis gone. A jagged raw atrium extends several stories down and up. \nTo the side, on a narrow ledge of floor extending from a wall...crouches Liz. The only person remaining. She has survived by inches. Very precise. \nAs she recovers from the blast, a door opens behind her. Cris appears, extends a hand and helps her from her perch. \nExt.

JET - NIGHT \nAt the door, no one is present to greet them. Odd. \nThey continue into the main cabin, where Neal, the Showgirl, the Pilots, and the Flight Attendant are glued to the television.

The situation in Chicago is not quite as severe as in the other nine cities where the dirty bombs exploded, as prevailing winds blew the nuclear waste across Lake Michigan rather than straight into town.

Effect before cause. The pleasure, then the gesture that elicits it. \nCris explores her body until she sighs, then snapsback and goes directly to the sweet spot.

It's Czech, but we haven't nailed down the batch. \nWisdom rubs his forehead, distraught. \nWISDOM So basically we've got nothing. \nNo one disagrees. \nWISDOM You're failing your country, people. You're not trying hard enough. (looks around the table) Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you understand what I expect from you? \nThe staff exchange uncertain glances. \nWisDOM TWIST ARMS!

WISDOM'S apartment - NIGHT \nFerris and Wisdom are in night gear, getting ready for bed.

We just need to bring him in. \nWisdom doesn't have the energy to fight her any more. \nWISDOM I'll see if Baines can spare some manpower. \nShe's gracious in victory. \nFERRIs You're all the manpower I need. \nINT.

Instead, Liz points to a SHY GIRL. \nshy girl Trout. \nLIZ From the lake? \nSHY GIRL No. From the rivers. \nLIZ Right. And the Washo were so jealous of their fishing grounds that when other Native Americans came to trade for dried fish, they were only permitted to remain one night. \nLiz notices that her students are distracted and giggling. She turns to see Cris standing in the doorway, holding a box. Embarrassed, she blushes. \nLIz I'll be right back. \nLiz pulls Cris into the hall, out of sight of the kids. \nLIZ What are you doing here? \nCrIS (beaming) I brought ice cream sandwiches for everybody. \nLIZ Ice cream sandwiches? Do you have any idea how much fat they have in them? Don't you see how overweight half of them are? \nCRIS (crestfallen) I - I didn't think of it. - I thought you'd be happy to see me. \nLIZ Well next time exercise a little forethought, okay? \nHe's speechless. \nCRIS Do you want me to leave these somewhere? \nLIZ No. \nCRIS All right then. I'll just go. \nSeeing his doleful expression, Liz can't help smiling. She glances up and down the hall, then kisses him lasciviously on the lips. \nLIZ Put a few in the freezer. I love ice cream sandwiches. \nWith a mischievous grin, she ducks back into class, leaving Cris reeling, but exhilarated. \nint. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nLiz and Cris stuff their mouths with lo mein. She sets down her chopsticks, picks up a red pencil and industriously resumes marking up a stack of papers. \nLIZ You have been such a bad influence. I'm gonna be up all night grading papers. \nCris watches, bored. \nCRIS I've got a better idea. Run away with me to the South Pacific. \nLIZ Funny. We've only known each other a week. \nCRIS But we're going to be happy together for the rest of our lives. Really, I peeked. \nShe picks up the chopsticks and takes another bite. \nLIZ I think you're serious. \nCRIS Deadly. \nShe muses, tempted. \nCRIS Let's go pack your bags. We'll leave tonight. \nLIZ And what'll we do for money? \nCRIS Don't worry. That's always been easy for me. \nShe gets lost in the fantasy. He can almost taste the fulfilmment of his dreams. \nLIZ This is ridiculous. \nCRIS Why? \nLIZ Well, first of all, it's the middle of the school year. \nCRIS They'll replace you. \nLIZ And I'm in charge of science fair. \nCRIS They can pick up the slack. \nHis unbridled enthusiasm brings out her inner adult. \nLIZ It disturbs me, Cris, that you think it's okay just to duck your responsibilities. \nHe's taken aback by her sudden shift. \nCRIS I - I don't think it's okay. I'm not that kind of person. But I have this feeling, this very strong feeling, that it has to be now. We have to leave soon, or it's not gonna work out. \nLIZ I don't believe that. If it's meant to be between two people, somehow it'll happen. \nCRIS Yes, but sometimes you have to make it happen. You have to seize the opportunity before it's too late. \nHe tries to keep his desperation from showing, but she sees right through him. \nLIZ What are you afraid of, Cris?

Ready to turn the other jaw? \nCris offers his profile for hitting. \nCRIS But then you have to sign the divorce papers. \nLiZ Randy, don't you dare. \nShe drags Cris towards a YOUNG COUPLE WITH KIDS. \nLiz Paul, Janice. Have you met Cris? \nRANDY \napproaches RICK, a young LOCAL POLICEMAN who's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. \nRandy There's something weird about that jerk.

Cause I'd like you to be my guest at the Rotary luncheon. \nJanice I'm the first female member. \nCris grows distracted. Out the corner of his eye, he sees a SPORTS CAR gunning it down the street, passing a SUNDAY DRIVER to beat a red light. At that moment, a kid misses a catch and a BASEBALL rolls into a street, where a twenty-ish WOMAN JOGGER runs over to get it, just as the sports car passes the Sunday driver, sees the jogger, and skids, forcing A BUS to swerve and plow into a GROUP OF PEOPLE standing at the corner. \nSNAPBACK TO: \nA FEW SECONDS EARLIER \nPaul Cris, are you free on Tuesday?

He sees kids, but they're jumping rope. Wrong group. He scans around and finds the kids who are playing softball. Someone misses a catch. The ball rolls toward the street. The sports car is now coming fast. The woman jogger sees the errant ball and runs to fetch it. \nCrIS Miss! Lady! Don't! \nShe's wearing earbuds and can't hear him. He's too far away to grab her. He's closer to the approaching sports car. Cris picks up a rock, prepares to throw, hesitates a beat, squints.... \nHe throws. Misses. Snapback. Throws. Misses. Snapback. Again. Again. Scores a hit. Snapback. Opens his eyes and hurls the stone. \nLiz and the bystanders watch, appalled, as the rock SHATTERS the driver side window of the sportscar, which instead of skidding, screeches to a halt. The bus drives by without incident, injuring no one. \nThe Driver of the sportscar bursts from his car and furiously charges Cris. \nCrIS I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll pay for the damages. \nThe Driver curses Cris and tries to grab and hit him. But Cris deftly deflects the blows so that they seem harmless. \nCRIS I said I'll pay. \nRealizing he can't land a punch, the Driver changes tack. \nDRIVER You're damn right you'll pay! I wanna talk to the cops. \nCRIS No need for that. I'll give you cash. Okay? Will you take cash? \nHe pulls out his wallet. \nCriS Two thousand?

But I think you need help. \nShe looks down. \nLiZ And I'm...I'm not the one to help you, right now. I've got too much going on in my own life. \nCris can't let her go.

LOUISE And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach. 
THELMA Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila? 
LOUISE You do? 
THELMA Yeah, you want it? 
LOUISE Yeah. 
Thelma starts to dig through her bag again. 
THELMA It's in here somewhere. 
Louise is rubbing her face.  She looks pretty bad.  Her hands are shaking. 
LOUISE Shit.  I'm gettin' tired. 
THELMA Are you alright? 
Louise does not really seem alright. 
LOUISE I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police. 
THELMA You know why.  You already said. 
LOUISE What'd I say again? 
THELMA Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else? 
LOUISE What? 
THELMA That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead.  I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass. 
LOUISE I said all that? 
THELMA No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest. 
LOUISE (tired) Whatever. 
EXT.  ROADSIDE REST STATION - MORNING 
Louise is at a pay phone as the sky is just starting to get light.  Thelma is in the bathroom nearby.  Louise has already dialed and the phone is RINGING. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - MORNING 
The TV DRONES on in the b.g. as the phone RINGS there, everyone leaps into action again.  Max picks up the phone. 
MAX Hello. 
LOUISE (V.O.) Let me speak to... Slocumbe. 
MAX (to Hal) She wants to talk to you. 
HAL Hello, Louise. 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - MORNING 
LOUISE Hey. 
HAL (V.O.) How are things goin' out there? 
LOUISE Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'. 
HAL (V.O.) You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth? 
LOUISE Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Hal smiles. 
HAL I swear.  Louise, I almost feel like I know you. 
LOUISE (V.O.) Well.  You don't. 
HAL You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone. 
LOUISE (V.O.) Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident? 
HAL I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here. 
EXT.  PAY PHONE - MORNING 
Louise does not answer. 
HAL (V.O.) Did Harlan Puckett... 
Through clenched teeth, repulsed:

MARTHA Who? 
AGNES I don't know. 
MARTHA Agnes... 
AGNES You'll laugh. 
MARTHA I promise I won't laugh. Who told her? 
AGNES An angel, when she was having one of her headaches. 
MARTHA Did your mother see angels often? 
AGNES No. 
MARTHA Do you? 
AGNES No. 
MARTHA Do you believe she really saw them? 
AGNES (sitting up) No, but I can never tell her that. 
MARTHA Why not? (no answer) Mmm? 
AGNES She'd get angry. 
Martha moves round close to Agnes. 
MARTHA Agnes, did you love your mother? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Did you ever want to be a mother yourself? 
AGNES I could never be a mother. 
MARTHA Why not? 
AGNES Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby. 
MARTHA Why not? 
AGNES Because I don't want one. 
MARTHA If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one? 
AGNES From someone who didn't want to have a baby. 
MARTHA Like you? 
AGNES 
(suddenly frustrated) No, not like me! 
MARTHA How would that person get one if they didn't want one? 
AGNES (jumping to her feet) A mistake... 
MARTHA Agnes, how did your mother get you? 
AGNES A mistake... it was a mistake... 
MARTHA

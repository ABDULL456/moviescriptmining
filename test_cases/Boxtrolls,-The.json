{"train": "THE BOXTROLLS \nWritten by \nIrena Brignull & Adam Pava \nBased on the book \"Here Be Monsters\" by \nAlan Snow \n(0050 PRO) PROLOGUE \nEXT. CHEESEBRIDGE ALLEY - NIGHT \nLightning strikes, illuminating a vine covered wall as the camera moves across a dark alley filled with CARDBOARD BOXES and CRATES. They boxes have stylized LABELS; the box in front is labeled FOCUS FEATURES. \nSFX: FOOTSTEPS running on cobblestones and LABORED BREATHING. \nHERBERT (O.S.) No. Not my boy! \nLightning strikes again, highlighting the boxes and rubbish in the alley. Something is coming. Whatever it is, its breath is hurried and animalistic. \nSFX: A BABY CRIES out. \nStumpy CLAWED FEET wrapped in rag run past a boxed labeled LAIKA. The camera follows the shadowed figure as it runs along cobblestones to the end of the lane. The creature pauses under an arched entryway and turns, revealing GLOWING EYES, a large mouth full of wonky teeth, and a BABY SHAPED BUNDLE in its arms. \nLIGHTING CRASHES as the BABY wriggles and cries. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHEESE GUILD - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nCLOSE ON: A FIST pounds a door. \nSNATCHER (WHEEZING) Wake his lordship. \nSFX: A SERIES OF LOCKS being unlatched on the door. \nA BUTLER opens the double doors, frowns. He starts to close the doors but Snatcher pushes against the effort. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) The unspeakable has happened. (GASP) We must speak of it immediately! \nA voice calls out from behind them. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (O.S.) (TIRED) What is it, Snatcher? \nThe butler moves aside, revealing a regal man with a white hat at the top of an ornate marble staircase. \nINT. CHEESE GUILD - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND looks on from the mezzanine. The man in the red hat casts a long shadow across the gleaming checkered floors of the Cheese Guild. \nSNATCHER (GESTURING THEATRICALLY) Boxtroll monsters have stolen a child. \nCLOSE ON: Lord Portley-Rind, perfectly groomed and perfectly horrified. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (AGHAST) No. \nCLOSE ON: ARCHIBALD SNATCHER in the door, backlit by streetlights, sheets of rain falling behind him. He's a big man, but out of shape (all belly and no butt), with long shreds of greasy hair sprouting from beneath his crooked hat. \nSNATCHER (NODS) They're no doubt picking their teeth with his adorable baby bones by now! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND A horrible tragedy. (beat, flippant) Let's deal with it in the morning! \nPortley-Rind turns to go. \nSNATCHER (O.S.) STOP! \nThe Butler closes the door, but Snatcher shoves his foot in the way. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) (STRUGGLING) Oh, oof! That's not the worst of it! Next they'll come after... \nThe Butler shoves at the door, slapping and shoving Snatcher's face until the door slams shut. Snatcher opens the mail slot and yells through it. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) ...OUR CHEESES! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (GASP) My Gouda!? \nSNATCHER (LOW) They'll stop at nothing. \nPortley-Rind suddenly flings open the doors, stares wide eyed at Snatcher. He is crouched on the ground near the mail slot. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND You're the town exterminator. I'll pay whatever it takes. \nSnatcher stands slowly. \nSNATCHER Oh, I don't want money. \nHe steps into the house and into the light, REVEALING his greedy face for the first time. He smiles an oily smile. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) I want one of those. \nSnatcher points to the WHITE HAT on Portley-Rind's head. Lord Portley-Rind grabs his hat protectively. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND A White Hat? You?! Absurd! \nSnatcher turns to leave, moving towards the damp Market Square. \nSNATCHER Alright then. But prepare to say bye bye to your Brie. Cheerio to your Cheddar. Goodbye to your... \nFISH (CONT'D) (GURGLES) Oh yeah... \nFish's eyes go wide as the clock's alarm RINGS, attracting the attention of an uglier, 2-foot-2 boxtroll. \nSHOE Huh? \nAs Fish stands proudly admiring the sound of his ringing alarm clock, SHOE bounces around his feet. \nSHOE (CONT'D) (GURGLES) Gimme that! \nShoe, short and feisty, grabs the alarm clock from Fish and scampers away with it. Fish watches as Shoe climbs a stack of crates and hisses back at him, sniffing at his new prize. Fish scowls at Shoe and returns to the rubbish pile, shaking his head and muttering. \nBehind him a half-dozen boxtrolls methodically pick through an assortment of trash barrels and old boxes. It's like a troop of monkeys at the dump. They find mechanical stuff, inspect it, and then either drop it into their box to keep or toss it back into the trash. \nA filthy TEDDY BEAR WITH A MUSICAL KEY is discarded by another boxtroll, landing with a THUNK and A FEW TINNY MUSICAL NOTES. Fish turns excitedly. \nFISH (CURIOUS) Ohhhh... \nHe picks up the teddy bear and cranks a key in its back as Shoe toys with the stolen alarm clock. The teddy bear plays MUSIC. Fish gurgles along to the tune and bobs his head, enjoying the moment. \nAgain, Shoe notices Fish has found something interesting. He shoves the alarm clock into his box, stealthily sneaks up on Fish and makes a grab for the teddy bear! Fish refuses to let go and they squabble over it. Suddenly all the boxtrolls snap to attention, their ears alert-- \nEXT. CHASE ALLEY \nThe creepy RATTLING SOUNDS of the Redhats' truck returns. \nAll the boxtrolls hide in their boxes. The \"camouflage\" works. Their boxes fit in perfectly with the trash barrels and packing crates. \nThe rattling comes closer... closer... then STOPS. \nBAM! HEADLIGHTS light up the alley. \nThree men dismount from the truck and cast long shadows across the alley and all of the boxes: the giant MR. TROUT, the beanpole thin MR. PICKLES, and the short, pit bull MR. GRISTLE. \nThe boxtrolls don't run -- they just KEEP HIDING IN THEIR BOXES. \nSNATCHER (O.S.) GENTLEMEN! \nSnatcher spreads his arms theatrically and wades into the garbage-strewn alley. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) Look at all these boxes left lying about. How curious, how peculiar. I do believe... evil is afoot. \nGristle chuckles and breaks into a psychotic grin. \nMR. GRISTLE (COLD BLOODED) HAHAHA. FOOT. \nMR. PICKLES Huh. \nFish peeks out of his box momentarily, then retreats when he sees the Redhats advancing into the alley. \nMr. Trout and Mr. Pickles absentmindedly check boxes for boxtrolls, but Mr. Gristle methodically stomps and smashes every box he can. When he finds a box with a boxtroll, he uses a CRICKET BAT to WHACK it back to the others to load onto the truck. \nMR. PICKLES (CONT'D) You ever seen someone's foot be evil, Mr. Trout? \nMR. TROUT I believe the boss meant evil is nearby, Mr. Pickles. \nMR. PICKLES My foot had a pretty nasty bunion once. I wouldn't say the foot itself was evil. \nMR. TROUT No, it's just a fancy-man's word for vicinity. \nMR. PICKLES Wrinkly ol' bunion looked like my grandmum. Had to saw her off. The bunion, not my grandmum. \nMr. Gristle spots a shivering box and positions himself over it, cricket bat in hand. \nMR. GRISTLE Ah, yes.   FOOT! \nWHACK! Gristle kicks the box, and it flies toward Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout. \nMR. TROUT There's one! \nMr. Pickles scoops it up in a dog catcher's net. \nMR. PICKLES Come on, ya squirmy monster. Your days of evil-doin' are over. \nMr. Gristle finds another shivering box. He swings his bat. \nMR. GRISTLE BOOM! \nWHACK! A box slides over to Trout. A dizzy boxtroll pops out for a moment, groaning. Trout taps its head and the boxtroll retreats. \nMR. TROUT You really think these boxtrolls understand the duality of good and evil? \nMR. PICKLES They must, right? Why else would they hide from us. We are the good guys. \nMr. Pickles strolls off with both boxtroll and net. \nMR. GRISTLE (O.S.) (hitting more boxes) Nice! NICE! \nWHACK! Another box slides over to Trout. Trout scoops up the box before the creature can get away. The boxtroll's legs dangle below as it is carried away. \nMR. TROUT Yeah... I suppose we are. \nCLOSE ON: Fish and Shoe, in the shadows at the edge of the alley, gurgle to each other while the Red Hats are distracted. Their heads stay hidden in their boxes as they waddle slowly out of the alley. \nMr. Gristle is too preoccupied with smashing other boxes to notice them. He grunts and laughs with the effort. \nSnatcher spots Fish and Shoe as they exit the alley and points at them. \nSNATCHER MR. GRISTLE! \nFISH (GURGLED) Eggs? \nEGGS (low, feral growls) \nOut of the shadows waddles the small boxtroll. The first thing that comes into the light is his box with an EGGS LOGO printed on the front, then appears the dirty face of a feral- looking 2-YEAR-OLD HUMAN BOY, EGGS. \nFish flashes a wonky-toothed smile at Eggs. \nEGGS (CONT'D) Fish! \nFish plays a game of hide and seek with the found teddy bear. He makes the arm, then another arm, then the head appear from the arm and head holes of his box. Baby Eggs is enthralled. He excitedly launches himself at Fish. They play wrestle over the toy until Eggs grabs it from Fish and scampers away. \nEggs hugs the bear. So cute. Then... RIPS ITS HEAD OFF! \nHe reaches into the teddy bear's chest cavity and pulls out the MUSIC BOX. He tosses the gutted bear body away and tries to get it to work. When he can't figure it out he holds it up to Fish. \nEGGS (CONT'D) Fish? \nFish winds the music box, gurgling an explanation of how it works. Music fills the dark nook. \nEggs giggles with delight as the gears work again.    They both close their eyes and hum along to the music. \nEGGS (CONT'D) (HUMS TUNE) Do do doo do doo... \nEGGS (CONT'D) (hums along with music) \nThey stop humming when the giant clock chimes signaling the end of the boxtroll \"day\". \nCUT TO: \n(0400 GRU) GROWING UP BOXTROLL \nINT. BOXTROLL CAVERN - CLOCK \nCLOSE ON: the clock as the large hands representing the moon and the sun flip. \nINT. BOXTROLL CAVERN - SLEEPING PILE \nAs the lights go out, Knickers and the other boxtrolls gather at the center of the cavern to sleep in a big, communal stack of boxes like one big family. \nThe sleeping pile is stacked tight and high. Fish and Eggs climb to the top of the pile. Fish holds Eggs up so he can pull a chain to turn out the last light in the cavern. \nBaby Eggs lies   looking straight up. The ceiling of the cavern is dotted with   lots of small lights and slowly turning machines -- it   looks like the flickering of stars. Baby Eggs happily drifts   off to sleep, snuggling the head he ripped from the teddy   bear. \nEXT. CHEESEBRIDGE ALLEY - NIGHT \nThe boxtroll clock chimes, signaling it is night above ground and time to wake up! Eggs swings from the light bulb and YELLS! \nEGGS Wake up! \nThe box pile explodes and falls apart as all the boxtrolls are startled awake. \n- EGGS NOOK: Fish winds up the teddy bear's MUSIC BOX and adds it to a MUSIC MACHINE, built out of assorted junk and driven by the teddy bear's music box. \nEggs pounds a hammer on a typewriter at the bottom of the machine and Fish pulls out a saw and draws a bow across it. Together they play a croaking music-mechanique song. \n- Eggs rides on WHEELS' shoulders. Wheels makes gurgling sounds like he is revving his engines. They ride around the base of the CONVEYOR BELT, watching boxtrolls roll down from the CHUTES. \nWheels swerves to avoid boxtrolls as they tumble off of the conveyor belt, holding Eggs out to Fish as he rolls into view. Fish catches Eggs and runs with him held like a football. \n- Fish in the cavern nook. He pulls out a prize bit of junk - a 78 rpm album by the QUATTRO SABATINO. Eggs' eyes go wide. \nEGGS OOOH! Hee hee hee. \nFish puts the record on the player and lowers the needle. Baby Eggs holds on to the record player, shaking his bottom to the beat and dancing, while Fish plays a MUSICAL SAW with his BOW. Eggs dances and turns to Fish, beating his box approvingly. \n- CLOSE ON: A roiling pile of BUGS as boxtroll hands, and one baby human's hand, reach in and grab fists full of bugs. \nBoxtrolls munch up mouthfuls of bugs and Eggs chomps away with them, just another monster. \n- Eggs and Fish play music in the nook, their music machine is evolving. First Eggs shakes the jar of buttons, then he strikes a beat on a cowbell. \n- Eggs is chasing Oil Can. He trips on his box and falls flat on his face, popping out of his box by mistake. Oil Can sees Eggs empty box and FREAKS! \nOIL CAN AAAAHHH! \nOil Can's wailing gets all the boxtrolls in the cavern to turn, see the empty box and SCREAM! It's a collective communal melt down - Fish runs up to Eggs in a panic, crams his box back on and GURGLES the rule- \nFISH (GURGLED) BOXTROLLS NEVER TAKE OFF THEIR BOXES! \n- Baby Eggs and Fish continue to play their music in the nook. Eggs hit the cowbell expertly with a spoon and dances, smiling and laughing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n- 11 YEAR OLD EGGS laughing absolutely rocking out to the music machine with the Quattro Sabatino song mixed in. Eggs plays the WASHBOARD while Fish plays his saw. The jar of buttons and the cowbell have been added to the music machine. \n- Close on several PILL BUGS crawling on the cavern floor. Shoe pokes them and they curl into a ball. He gathers them up and growls happily from behind a pile of junk, eyeing Eggs. \nEggs hides behind a little barrier of corrugated metal with his own pile of pill bug balls. Shoe hurls a bug at Eggs and misses, hitting the metal. \nEGGS Ha! Missed me! \nEggs tosses a bug at Shoe, and Shoe smugly laughs as the bug flies into a tube. While he laughs, the bug shoots out from the tube, smacking him on his nose. OOF! \n- Eggs and Fish are grooving along to their music machine. Eggs transitions from the washboard to smashing light bulbs with a SKILLET. \nOutside of the nook, other boxtrolls bob their heads happily along with the music. \n- CLOSE ON: Eggs as he slides on a \"new\" HELMET made out of junk. It is fitted with lights so he can see in the dark. \nBRODERICK I'm tasting notes of... plum! \nBoulanger snores. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (mouth full, reading DOCKET) All good fun, but we do have this school funding initiative to vote on. Been sitting here for months. All in favor of-- \nBRODERICK --Cutting open the Roquefort next? \nALL AYE!! \nLord Portley-Rind tosses the docket behind him, giving in. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Well, okay, okay. A quick reminder, tomorrow is Trubshaw Baby Remembrance Day. (PERVY) And we all know what that means... a performance by Madame Frou Frou. \nA burst of STEAM shoots out of Boulanger's wheelchair. \nBOULANGER A VISION! \nBRODERICK Now there's a woman... \nLANGSDALE ... With some cheese on her bones! \nPortley-Rind leans in like he has a secret, and slowly caresses a piece of brie as he says: \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND A lady like that is like a fine brie. Raw. Dangerous. (DEEP SNIFF) Maybe a little stinky, but one taste and you'll be begging for... mmm . . . \nLord Portley-Rind nuzzles the brie and kisses its crust. \nWINNIE (O.S.) Father! \nSuddenly, he looks up he sees: \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND WINIFRED! \nHe SQUEEZES the cheese in his hand, which EXPLODES all over. A hunk of the brie lands on his hat. He jumps up and storms over to the door. The White hats murmur and gasp. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) Winifred go on. Off to bed. Off to bed! Come on, come on. \nWINNIE But Father! I saw boxtrolls again! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. \nPortley-Rind's eyes keep sliding back toward the room behind him, where the others are tasting another fine cheese. \nWINNIE They're right outside. They could come rip the flesh off my bones any moment! \nBehind them: LOUD grunts of satisfied tasting. \nWHITE HATS (O.S.) (IN UNISON) Would be a shame to miss this, Portley-Rind! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (CALLING BACK) Yes, yes one moment! (to Winnie, distracted) Winifred, proper girls should not be obsessing over grotesque monsters. \nPortley-Rind's attention is directed to the shenanigans going on behind him. \nWINNIE I'm not obsessed! I just can't stop imagining them gnawing off my toes and stringing them together as a necklace! Father? Father. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (NOT LISTENING) Mmm hmm. Yes. \nPortley-Rind turns back and pats Winnie on the head like she is a little dog. \nWINNIE (TESTING HIM) If they kidnapped me and slurped up my intestines like noodles, would you give up your white hat to save me? \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (still not listening) Hmm? Um. Yes, Winifred. \nWINNIE Father! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND What? Uh... White Hat? Right. (looks at his hat) What.. Oh, seems to have been smudged by a bit of brie. Be a dear and have the butler give it a wash, would you? \nHe hands a stunned Winnie his White Hat and turns her toward the stairs. \nWINNIE BUT-- \nHe closes the door on her before she can finish her thought. \nINT. CHEESE GUILD - MEZZANINE \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (O.S.) Now gentlemen, I apologize... sorry! Back to important White Hat business... Pass the Camembert! \nWinnie is hurt and frustrated. She looks down at the White Hat in her hands. Her eyes narrow. \nWINNIE I'll give your hat a wash all right. \nEXT. MARKET SQUARE - WINNIE'S BALCONY - NIGHT \nHigh on the front of the Guild, Winnie bursts through a set of french doors and onto a balcony holding the white hat, her face an angry scowl. \nShe tosses Lord Portley-Rind's hat, frisbee style, out into the night sky. The hat glows in the moonlight as it sails across the Market Square. \nEXT. MARKET SQUARE \nThe white hat hits the ground in the middle of the square. \nEXT. MARKET SQUARE - WINNIE'S BALCONY - CONTINUOUS \nShe smiles, satisfied, dusts her hands. \nWINNIE Ha! \nThen, her smile slowly melts as she realizes this was not her brightest move. She hears raucous laughter from the Tasting Room. \n(0600 SPR) SNATCHER   AND   LORD   PORTLEY-RIND \nINT. CHEESE GUILD - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT \n-- and approaches the foot of the main stairs. \nSNATCHER (CALLING OUT) Lord Portley-Rind! \nCLOSE ON the TASTING ROOM DOORS. \nSFX Muffled voices of White Hats enjoying themselves suddenly stop. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (O.S.) (MUFFLED) Did you hear something? \nWinnie winces. She turns to Snatcher who is admiring the white hat again. \nWINNIE (DESPERATE) Can I have the hat back now? \nSnatcher puts the hat behind his back, grins and pulls Winnie up the stairs by her wrist, toward the Tasting Room. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) (PLEADING) Please. \nPortley-Rind bursts out to see Snatcher ascending the stairs. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND What in Gouda's name is going on? Archibald Snatcher? \nSNATCHER Deepest apologies, your Lordship. But I found something out in the street that belongs to you. \nSnatcher gestures behind him revealing a sheepish Winnie. As he turns he also reveals the white hat. Portley-Rind rushes down the stairs to meet Snatcher half way and GRABS THE HAT. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND My White Hat! \nWinnie looks stricken. \nWINNIE Huh? \nAs Portley-Rind pulls on the hat, Snatcher refuses to let it go, so they tug each other up and down the stairs. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND I'll take that... Now, now, Snatcher one doesn't acquire a white hat by simply-- (STRAINING) --picking it up... off the street. \nPortley-Rind finally wins the tussle and grabs the hat back. He growls under his breath at the smudges left on the brim. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) (WITH EMPHASIS) A white hat indicates privilege, prestige, position! (THEN) It must be earned. \nHe removes a handkerchief from his breast pocket and dabs at the hat's brim. \nFrom the top of the stairs the other Guild members chime in. \nLANGSDALE With Valor! \nBOULANGER Chivalry! \nBRODERICK Or being rich! That's how I got it. \nSnatcher looks up at them and bows, removing his red hat. \nSNATCHER Oh, don't I know it, sirs. \nSnatcher climbs the stairs and gets face to face with Portley- Rind. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) Fortunately, we still have our little... agreeeeement. \nPortley-Rind grimaces, remembering. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Um.. ehhh... \nSnatcher opens his arms, gesturing widely, as he recites the particulars of the deal. \nSNATCHER When I destroy every last boxtroll in this town, I shall earn my white hat... and join you in the Tasting Room. \nSnatcher takes a step toward the Tasting Room door and looks longingly into its warm, inviting interior. The White Hats reach back and slam the doors shut. Snatcher's face falls. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Good lord. (twists his mustache) Not sure who should be more terrified - the boxtrolls or us. \nThe White Hats chuckle. Snatcher's expression drops into a scowl. Portley-Rind puts his hat back on. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) Now, how the devil did my hat get outside in the first place? \nSnatcher smirks and gestures toward Winnie. \nSNATCHER I was told the wind had something to do with it. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND The wind, eh? \nPortley-Rind looks at Winnie and frowns. \nWINNIE Father, I'm sorry-- \nSNATCHER (INTERRUPTING) Sorry! Can't stay. Too much work to do. (DOFFS HAT) Miss Portley-Rind, your Lordship, Sirs. I bid you good night. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other again very, very soon. \nSnatcher oozes out the door. Portley-Rind looks at Winnie and shakes his head. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (EXASPERATED) Hmmmm.. Winnie... \nWinnie is about to defend herself when Snatcher pops his head back in and points to his head. \nSNATCHER Don't forget. I'm a size six-and-a- half. Order ahead. \nAs he finally leaves, his hat gets caught in the door and he lets out a frustrated growl/groan. \nCROWD Booooo! \nEGGS But she's lying. \nA man standing next to Eggs overhears and looks down at him. Eggs pales and pulls his disguise tighter. \nMADAME FROU FROU And that's the story of the TRUBSHAW KID Don't do what Father Trubshaw did If you see Boxtrolls don't placate THEM Catch 'em and exterminate them BOXTROLLS \nFrou Frou wallops Gristle with her fan. The crowd cheers her on as she beats the crap out of him in a not-very-ladylike fashion. The crowd is whipped into a frenzy! \nMADAME FROU FROU (CONT'D) Kill those Boxtrolls! \nEggs is crushed by the furious crowd as they chant along with Madame Frou Frou. \nMADAME FROU FROU (CONT'D) Kill those Boxtrolls! \nCROWD Kill those boxtrolls! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND/WHITE HATS Don't forget about our party tonight, Frou Frou! \nEggs looks around at the frantic crowd, he sees Winnie exiting out the back of the stage. She dusts herself off and heads back into the crowded market. Eggs follows her. \n(1000 EFW) EGGS FOLLOWS WINNIE \nEXT. MARKET SQUARE \nAs Winnie makes her way across the crowded square Eggs follows her. \n- When he sees the One Man Band coming closer, he ducks down into a box shape as if he could hide like a real boxtroll. When the danger is passed he looks up and sees Winnie disappearing into the crowd. \n- Eggs runs to catch up and has to jump over a vendor pushing a cart. \nTOWNSPERSON 2 Hey? What the... \n- Eggs falls in behind Winnie a she nonchalantly circles the tent of a cheese seller. She suddenly looks back and STARES RIGHT AT EGGS! Eggs hides behind a Swiss cheese. \nWinnie ignores him and heads off down the street with Eggs still following until she-- \nEXT MARKET SQUARE - ARCADE - DAY --Lunges around a corner and disappears! Eggs runs after her, turns the corner and she's gone. Suddenly she jumps out in front of him. \nWINNIE What do you want! \nEggs, startled, instinctively hides in a barrel. Winnie peers in at him. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) You're the worst pickpocket I have ever seen. \nShe tosses him a coin. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) Here, buy yourself a book on how to be a better thief. \nShe walks away shaking her head. \nEggs climbs up out of the barrel. \nEGGS Wait! I saw you last night. \nWinnie freezes, eyes wide. She slowly turns back to him. He looks down, too scared to look her in the eye. \nEGGS (CONT'D) And they took Fish, and... I don't know where they took him... \nHe looks up and Winnie is right in front of him. \nEGGS (CONT'D) Ah! \nWINNIE You were with the boxtrolls last night? \nEggs wipes the coal dust mustache from his face. \nEGGS Yes. \nWINNIE (EXCITED) Whoah! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! \nWinnie gleefully dances about as Eggs climbs out of the barrel. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) Father didn't believe me but I KNEW IT! How did you escape?! \nEGGS We went underground and they-- \nWINNIE (INTERRUPTING) Did they drag you down to their hideous caves? \nEGGS Huh? \nEggs backs up as Winnie advances, intensely presses him for information. \nWINNIE Were there mountains of baby bones and rivers of blood? \nEGGS What? \nWINNIE Did they eat your family? \nEGGS MY FAMILY- \nWINNIE Did they let you watch?! (PAUSE) I mean, make you watch?! \nShe grabs him by the shoulders. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) TELL ME EVERYTHING! \nFreaked out and frustrated, Eggs BITES HER ON THE ARM. She freezes. They stare at each other, Eggs panting, her in shock. She looks down at her arm flabbergasted. \nEXT. INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND \nEggs reaches an intersection and stops at the street signs: MILK AVE and CURDS WAY. He looks around at the industrial wasteland. In the distance is one lone building with a bloody red top hat painted on the huge wooden door. \nEggs heads toward it. \nINT. SNATCHER'S FACTORY \nCLOSE ON Snatcher's grimy hands holding up a white hat made out of paper. \nSNATCHER Men, don your white hats. \nSnatcher lowers the paper hat onto his head. Across the table from him the Redhats replace their red hats with paper white hats. They all sit at a table set with cracked crockery and mismatched plates. \nMR. PICKLES Are you sure about this, boss? You know what cheese can do to you... \nSNATCHER (tucking a napkin into his COLLAR) Unless you are referring to how cheese brings men of respect and power together in brotherhood, no, I do not know what... (LOOMING MENACINGLY) \"Cheese. Does. To. Me.\" \nMR. PICKLES (GULPS) That's what I meant then. \nSNATCHER Marvelous! Then let us begin. \nTrout takes a little piece of cheese out of a package labeled \"EXTRA MILD CHEDDAR\". He focuses and cuts off the tiniest little sliver and puts it on a plate, inspects it and slices it into an even smaller piece... then slices it again... and again... and again... and-- \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) (YELLS) ENOUGH! \nSnatcher bangs his fist on the table. Startled, Pickles and Trout jump. Then Trout puts a tiny slice of cheese on a plate and very slowly rotates the top of the table like a Lazy Susan. It takes forever for Snatcher's plate to arrive in front of him. \nSnatcher loses patience and spins the table so that a plate lands in front of him. As he moves to pierce the cheese with his fork, the plate shifts to the left. He glares at Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles, who turned the table top. They immediately return the plate. \nThe Redhats stare nervously as Snatcher stabs the curd and raises it to his lips and places it on his tongue. He chews, relishing it, then swallows. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) (SMILING) Mmmm! \nThe Redhats relax. They take a tiny piece of cheese each and eat it. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) I say, old chaps, it's quite, um... QUITE-- \nMR. TROUT --Aromatic? Oaky? With an undertone of a mother's smile on a warm spring day? Hmm... \nSNATCHER Yes! Those things! Etcetera etcetera, big words, chummy banter... \nAs the Redhats look on in horror, red spots appear across Snatcher's face. He scratches at them absently. \nMR. PICKLES (whispered to Trout) Someone's got the cheese fits again. \nMR. TROUT (SHUDDERS) Ohhh... (whispered to Gristle) Quickly, quietly, get the leeches. \nGristle scurries away, crossing behind Snatcher. \nMR. GRISTLE QUIETLY! \nSNATCHER (SLURRED) Where is he going? Is he getting more cheese? \nSnatcher's lips instantly PUFF UP into huge, wobbly, distended FISH LIPS. The Redhats stare-- \nMR. GRISTLE Quietly! \nSNATCHER What? \nMR. PICKLES (SCARED) I think you've had enough for today, boss. \nIn the background, Eggs' silhouette appears in the soot- covered window. He wipes away the grime to look in. \nEXT. SNATCHER'S FACTORY - DAY \nEggs looks away from the window up at a large, rickety AIR DUCT attached to the side of the building. He climbs into the duct, leaving his disguise behind. \nINT. SNATCHER'S FACTORY - DAY \nBACK TO SCENE. Snatcher's face is now grotesquely misshapen and one eye has swollen shut like Quasimodo. \nSNATCHER (slurred by swollen lips) Isn't this nice? Chewing the cheddar with the big cheessses. Holding my own-- (GULPS CHEESE) --With sssophissstication and sssavoir faire! \nPickles, and Trout sit nervously at the table and stare at him. \nMR. PICKLES (SUPER WORRIED) Yup. Nothing terrifying about that. \nMR. TROUT (rubs his neck, nervously) Uh huh huh... \nSNATCHER Thisss is where I belong! \nHe leans back in his \"throne\" and begins orating again. \nMR. TROUT Spot on, as always, sir. \nEggs appears peeking out of the air duct high on the factory wall. \nMR. PICKLES (O.S.) You're not wrong, boss. \nSNATCHER (ANGRY) Well not here! In this rotten factory! \nSnatcher quickly leans forward, slams his fist on the table and stands. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) I belong up there! \nEggs shrinks back into the duct, afraid that Snatcher has noticed him. \nMR. TROUT (O.S.) I'm agreeing so I don't upset you. \nSNATCHER (NERVOUSLY) Miss Portley-Rind! What a surprise! (MORE) \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) Does your.. does your father know you're here? \nWINNIE (DISMISSIVE) No of course not! (up to Eggs) But wait til I tell him! The Trubshaw Baby! Alive! \nWinnie sees Trout towering over her. \nMR. TROUT (REGRETFULLY) Sorry, miss. \nWinnie looks at Snatcher in horror and confusion. Trout picks her up in his big hands. \nWINNIE What are you doing? Unhand me! \nSNATCHER Looks like the Boxtrolls have a new victim, miss. And her name is YOU. \nGristle remembers Eggs. He swings his bat over his head and brings it down but Eggs leaps, grabs the rope from Pickles' missed shot, and SWINGS LIKE TARZAN towards the door that Winnie opened. \nTrout panics as he sees Eggs swinging towards him. He holds Winnie up to protect his face. Eggs barrels into Trout's belly, knocking him backward and getting him wedged in the door. \n(1300 WCH) WASTELAND CHASE \nEXT. SNATCHER'S FACTORY - DAY \nEggs and Winnie tumble outside the factory and roll to a stop in a cloud of dust. \nSNATCHER They're getting away Mr. Gristle! \nWINNIE (PANICKED) What have you dragged me into? \nFish calls to them from a manhole. \nFISH Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! \nEGGS RUN! \nEggs and Winnie run. \nEXT. INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND \nStill running Eggs and Winnie suddenly hear a loud CRASH! \nBehind them Gristle comes crashing through a high window swinging on a chain. \nMR. GRISTLE I'm swinging on a chain! \nEGGS/WINNIE AHHH! \nEggs and Winnie slide into the manhole that Fish holds open. They make it in and slam it shut just in time for Mr. Gristle to face plant on top of it. \nMR. GRISTLE Stuck on a manhole! \nTrout finally pops out of the factory doorway. He and Mr. Pickles come running up to the motionless Mr. Gristle, standing over him. \nMR. TROUT Oww... \nMR. PICKLES Don't make no sense. That's evil prevailing over good. \nSnatcher arrives. \nSNATCHER (TO TROUT) If Lord Portley-Rind finds out that boy is alive, it will ruin everything I've worked for! \nMR. TROUT You mean, we worked for? \nSnatcher glares at Mr. Trout, silent. \nMR. PICKLES I think we're all saying the same thing here. \nMR. TROUT I don't think we are. \nSNATCHER (ANNOYED) Bah... \nSnatcher walks away, frustrated. \nMR. PICKLES But, just in different ways. \n(1400 FMR) FAMILY   REUNION \nINT BOXTROLL CAVERN - ENTRANCE CHUTES - MOMENTS LATER \nWinnie screams as she flies down the chutes, into the cavern, down the conveyor belt, and crashes into the boxtroll sleeping pile. \nINT BOXTROLL CAVERN - NIGHT \nWinnie lays amongst the scattered boxes. She pushes herself upright, coughing. Boxtrolls poke their heads out all around her and stare. \nWINNIE (gasp) Ohh! \nWinnie gets as far away from the boxtrolls as she can, bumping into Knickers as she shuffles backwards. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) STAY AWAY FROM ME! Someone, help!!! Wealthy girl in danger! \nShe pushes herself against a wall. The boxtrolls gather, curious. Winnie spots Shoe nearby, with worms and bugs dangling from his mouth. She hides behind a cabbage, whimpering. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) If you're going to eat me just get it over with. I'm sure I'm delicious. \nSuddenly there is the sound of happy boxtrolls gurgling and drumming their boxes. \nWinnie peeks out. The boxtrolls are surrounding Eggs and Fish and celebrating their return. No one is paying any attention to her. \nFish starts gurgling and keeps gurgling, his face suggesting that he's conveying something from long-long ago... \nFISH [GURGLE GURGLE] \nWinnie stands by Eggs, watching Fish curiously. \nWINNIE What's he saying? \nEGGS Oh, sorry. He says a long time ago there was a kind man-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \n(1500 TBB) TRUBSHAW BABY \nINT. TRUBSHAW KITCHEN (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT \nFish and Shoe stand beside a rubbish bin, tinkering with a WHIRLIGIG CONTRAPTION. \nEGGS (V.O.) -- The one man in town who saw they weren't monsters... \nSFX: A baby GIGGLES. \nFish and Shoe startle and hide in their boxes. The whirligig clatters to the ground. \nEGGS (V.O.) ... But builders... like him. \nPOV FISH: Herbert Trubshaw stands at an open window to his second-floor workshop, holding a BABY in his arms. Instead of chasing them away he SMILES at them. \nFish and Shoe slowly lift their heads out of their boxes, returning the smile. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nANOTHER NIGHT: Herbert, baby Eggs, and Fish sit on the back stoop and discuss an invention. As Herbert talks, Fish casually takes it from him and tweaks it. \nHERBERT I've tried adjusting the dongle and there doesn't seem to be any possible solut-- Oh look, you've solved it! \nFish laughs with Herbert. Herbert hands Baby Eggs to Fish, and he holds the child at arm's length. \nHERBERT (CONT'D) Who's up for a jelly break? \nFish stares at Baby Eggs as Herbert eats a spoonful of jelly. They smile at each other. \nHERBERT (CONT'D) (VOICE FADES) I tell you I could eat this stuff for the rest of my life. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nANOTHER NIGHT: Fish and Shoe enter the back yard and freeze as they step into light. \nHERBERT (CONT'D) But one night... \nIn the second story windows, menacing silhouettes of Snatcher and Gristle loom over Herbert, who clutches baby Eggs to his chest. \nSnatcher's muffled voice can be heard threatening Herbert and the baby. \nSNATCHER (O.S.) Come on! I'm being reasonable. I can be unreasonable. \nEGGS (V.O.) Snatcher wanted him to build something... \nHERBERT I-- I'm an inventor, not a killer! \nEggs (V.O.) But he refused... \nLIGHTNING CRASHES. \nFish stares up at the window.    At Snatcher's loud threat, Shoe runs away. \nEGGS (V.O.) And when the Redhats tried to take me away from him... \nSnatcher's silhouette moves menacingly towards Herbert. \nSNATCHER Maybe if I hold on to your son... \nHerbert shoves Snatcher away. Snatcher growls. \nHERBERT Not my boy! \nHerbert kicks Gristle and opens the window. He places the baby into a box pulley system that dangles from the upper floors. He untethers the rope, yelling to Fish. \nHERBERT (CONT'D) RUN! PROTECT MY--UGHH! \nHerbert is tackled by Gristle. \nFish watches the crying baby lower to the ground in an Eggs box. He is frozen with fear. \nEGGS (V.O.) And then they... \nSnatcher CLUBS Herbert across the head and Herbert goes down hard. Dead. The baby CRIES. \nSnatcher looks out the window, panting from exertion, and sees Fish staring up in shock. \nThunder BOOMS, lightning FLASHES, and RAIN POURS DOWN as Fish bolts through the gate and out of the yard with Baby Eggs still in the Eggs box. \nBACK TO: \nINT BOXTROLL CAVERN - NIGHT \nEggs holds his box, staring forlornly down at his label. \nWINNIE (O.S.) They what? \nWINNIE (CONT'D) No. \nShoe growls and walks off. \n- Bucket offers Winnie a JAR OF BUTTONS. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) Oh yes! \n- Winnie holds up the jar and selects a BUTTON. \n- Shoe offers Winnie a TOILET PLUNGER. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) No! \nShoe angrily tosses the plunger aside and storms off. \n- Fragile offers Winnie a pair of shoes. She excitedly swipes them from his hands. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) Yes! \nFragile is frightened and hides, whimpering. \nREVEAL Eggs in the broken mirror dressed in a surprisingly fashionable suit made of trash. \nHe looks like the Little Lord Fauntleroy of the junk yard. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) You look like a proper boy. \nThe boxtrolls look like proud parents. They nod and grumble in approval. \nEggs looks at his warped reflection in an old, broken mirror. He looks stunned by his own transformation. \nEGGS (TO HIMSELF) Me... a proper boy. \nEggs smiles sweetly, standing tall. \nWINNIE How do we get out of this place? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAVERN - PNEUMATIC TUBES \nA MOMENT LATER: Specs turns an ANCHOR attached to the wall. \nWinnie stands underneath the cracked bell, the mouth of the PNEUMATIC TUBES, confused. \nFWOOMP! A shocked Winnie gets sucked up a PNEUMATIC TUBE while Eggs watches, bemused. \nWINNIE AHHHHHHHH! \n(1700 PTY) PARTY \nEXT. MARKET SQUARE - NIGHT \nEggs and Winnie (woozy, her hair frazzled from the tube ride) crawl out of a manhole. \nWINNIE Come on, Eggs. \nThey climb the Guild stairs together. Winnie pats down her hair as Eggs lopes past her like a nervous boxtroll. He wipes his nose with the back of his hand, wipes it on his pants, adjusting his disguise as he reaches for the door handle. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) (SHRIEKS) STOP! \nEggs stops, eyes wide. Winnie pushes him away from the door. They stop in front of the tall guild door. Sounds of party guests can be heard. Winnie turns to Eggs. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) You don't scratch there in public! That's why they're called... (WHISPERED) ... privates. \nWinnie looks around to make sure nobody saw that. \nEGGS (WHISPERED) Okay. \nWINNIE For this is to work, there are a few things you need to know. When you meet someone, you must look them in the eye and shake hands. \nEggs OPENS HIS EYEBALLS STUPIDLY WIDE and WIGGLES HIS HANDS in the air like a lunatic. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) What are you doing?! Put those down! \nShe pulls his hands down. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) Like this. \nEggs puts his left hand out. She slaps it away. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) The other one. \nEGGS Oh, right. \nShe shoves his hand into hers -- a proper shake. \nWINNIE Then you say, (SNOBBISH) \"It's a pleasure to meet you.\" \nEGGS (IMPERSONATING WINNIE'S SNOBBISH VOICE) \"It's a pleasure to meet you.\" \nWINNIE And you say that even if you're not pleased to meet them. \nEggs looks confused, but nods yes anyway. A look of doubt comes over Winnie's face. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) (SIGHS) Just stick close, okay? \nShe opens the huge doors and the elegant sound of chamber music and civilized conversation pours out. \nSir Langsdale storms off. Eggs doesn't notice. He goes down the table, shoveling various cheeses into his mouth. \nEGGS (MOUTH FULL) Yum. Mmmthatsgood. \nBOULANGER (O.S.) (clears throat loudly) \nEggs looks up and sees two aristocrat ladies and Boulanger using forks to nibble politely. \nFEMALE ARISTOCRAT A (O.S.) Eww. \nA lady aristocrat pointedly taps her plate with the fork, signaling to Eggs. \nEGGS (MOUTH FULL) Huh? Oh! \nBLARRG! He SPITS the chewed cheese back on to a plate, grabs a fork, and gingerly nibbles at the regurgitated food. The ladybug rests on top then flies away. He shovels a forkful into his mouth. \nTHUD. Ladies faint. Eggs watches them nonchalantly while SMACKING his mouthful of cheese. \nBUTLER (O.S.) Ladies and Gentlemen... Lord Portley-Rind! \nHe puts down the plate and fork quickly as Lord Portley-Rind appears. \nEggs joins the crowd that has gathered around the Cheese Guild staircase as Portley-Rind orates. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Distinguished members of the cheese guild. We were here to celebrate the successful fund-raising for a new children's hospital! But my fellow White Hats and I decided the money would be better spent on this. I present: THE BRIEHEMOTH! \nHe whips a sheet off a giant WHEEL OF CHEESE. Everyone gasps and applauds. Eggs walks toward the stairs. Suddenly, he is grabbed from behind. \nMADAME FROU FROU Zere you are! \nMadame Frou Frou's crazily painted face looms over him. People nearby turn and stare. He/She suddenly pulls Eggs away. \nMADAME FROU FROU (CONT'D) Come. Such a naughty boy! We have so much to discuss. (SNATCHER'S VOICE) Alone. \nEggs' eyes go wide as he realizes who it is. \nEGGS YOU'RE SNATC-- \nSMACK! Madame Frou Frou covers his mouth, and hugs him close, LIFTING HIM OFF THE GROUND. \nMADAME FROU FROU (SNATCHER'S VOICE) Come to snitch on old Snatcher did you? \nAs Madame Frou Frou carries him away, he waves to people in the crowd as if nothing untoward was happening. \nSIR BRODERICK Hello, Frou Frou! \nMADAME FROU FROU Nice to see you, too! \nHe/She shoves Eggs through a curtain into-- \nINT. CHEESE GUILD - COAT ROOM - NIGHT \n--The dark corner of a closet. Madame Frou Frou advances on Eggs. \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER You really think Portley-Rind will help a nobody like YOU? In this town, you want help, you've got to help yourself! That's what a man does! \nSnatcher adjusts his dress. \nEGGS You're a liar! When I tell Winnie's father the truth, he'll-- OOF! \nEggs' tries to run out of the closet. Snatcher shoves him to the floor. \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER He'll THANK ME! Because all your little boxtroll friends are going to die - tonight. \nEGGS What?! \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER That will make me the most respected man in this town. \nSnatcher talks to himself as he rifles through the coats searching for something. \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER (CONT'D) (WHILE SEARCHING) They'll have no choice but to give me a white hat. \nSnatcher finds what he's looking for - a long SCARF. \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER (CONT'D) They'll parade me into the tasting room on their shoulders! \nHe winds the ends around each fist and snaps it tight as he stalks toward Eggs. \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER (CONT'D) And I'm not going to let that be ruined by some little boxtroll sewer rat. \nSnatcher is about to strangle Eggs when the curtain is suddenly pulled aside and light fills the closet. \nSIR LANGSDALE Yoo hoo, Madame Frou Frou... You promised your snookums a dance! \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER (deep Snatcher voice) I did? (as Frou Frou) I did! Ha! But of course! \n(1750 DAN) DANCE \nINT. CHEESE GUILD - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT \nSir Langsdale pulls Madame Frou Frou out of the closet and walks her out on to the dance floor. He gooses her. \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER Oooh! Vatch your hands, monsieur! \nSIR LANGSDALE (LAUGHS LASCIVIOUSLY) \nON EGGS, as he slowly exits the closet. He awkwardly adjusts his collar as he takes in his surroundings. Couples are joined together in a WALTZ, filling the entrance hall with activity. \nEggs looks up at Portley-Rind at the top of the stairs, then at the impenetrable wall of dancers. He tries to walk through the crowd and is nearly trampled. There is no way to get to Portley-Rind without causing a scene. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND What have you done!? \nEggs begins to speak... haltingly at first... but then growing in confidence. \nEGGS Lord Winnie's Father... \nThe crowd and Portley-Rind all turn and stare at Eggs. \nEGGS (CONT'D) People of the upper world -- Archibald Snatcher has lied to you all! \nFrou Frou/Snatcher looks at the crowd and GULPS! \nEGGS (CONT'D) He told you that boxtrolls are monsters -- that they steal children -- but they don't. They would never hurt anyone. I know because... \nEggs looks to Winnie.   She nods, encouraging him. \nEGGS (CONT'D) Because... I am the Trubshaw Baby! \nA long beat. CLOSE ON LORD PORTLEY-RIND as he seems to be thinking intensely... \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Do you know how expensive that cheese was? \nEGGS What?! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (FLIPPANT) We might as well have built a children's hospital! \nWINNIE Did you hear a word he said?! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (dismissive, to Winnie) Not now. \nWINNIE BUT FATHER-- \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (points to White Hats) Have you any idea how long it will take my men to fish it out of the river?! \nThe White Hats look worried. Boulanger rolls forward in his wheelchair and adjusts his hearing horn. \nLANGSDALE Ahh. What? \nBOULANGER Eww... the river? \nEggs moves down the stairs. \nEGGS If you won't listen to me, ask Snatcher himself. \nEggs PULLS OFF SNATCHER'S WIG. A long beat, as Snatcher looks caught. \nCROWD (SHOCK) GASP!/ Oh my! \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER (whimpers) You have me. I am not a true red head. \nLADY CYNTHIA (sympathy for Frou Frou) Poor woman. \nSIR LANGSDALE (sympathy for Frou Frou) For shame. \nNow the crowd turns ANGRY. \nCROWD MEN How rude! / The lad's fuddled! / An outrage! / The very thought! (MORE) I saw him bite a bug on a cracker!/ He must hate cheese! / He's a mad man! / I believe her's wearing a lamp shade as a sleeve! \nCROWD LADIES Nasty boy! / Oh, he's awful! (MORE) That's the one who crawled under my dress! / I knew he was up to no good the second he goosed me. / My husband is angry so I am too! \nPortley-Rind angrily climbs the stairs to Eggs. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND You insult our guest of honor? \nHe grabs the wig away from Eggs. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) Who are you?! \nEGGS (SHEEPISH) A proper boy. \nWINNIE He is with me father. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND You know this... creature? \nWINNIE He's my friend. What he said is TRUE-- \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Enough! \nWINNIE But... \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Winifred! \nWinnie gives in and bows her head. Eggs is stunned and hurt. Portley-Rind turns on him. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) (TO EGGS) I don't want to see you again, do you hear me? \nEGGS But he's not a... \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Leave my house. Now! \nEggs walks slowly down the stairs. As he passes, Frou Frou/Snatcher smiles an evil grin. \nEggs glares at Snatcher and walks past Winnie without even looking at her. She looks heartbroken. \nThe crowd shuffles away from Eggs as he walks out the door. The butler wordlessly shuts it behind him. \nThe music begins again and the crowd goes back to chatting. Portley-Rind hands the wig back to Madame Frou Frou and leads her down the stairs. \nSNATCHER Zees parties are so confusing. No? \nTwo big spot lights BLAST ON like eyes, and the mecha box drill rises up on three legs. As it rises, it tears walkways and lights from the cavern walls. \nBOXTROLLS AHHHHHHHH!!!!! \nAs it turns, it rips the intricate boxtroll clock from its stalagmite and sends it crashing down. The mecha box looks like a monstrous, giant mechanical boxtroll. \nThe mecha box's spotlight \"eyes\" cut through the dust and darkness, catching each fleeing boxtroll, making them instinctively STOP RUNNING and HIDE in their boxes! \nSnatcher's head appears out of the top. He still has his Madame Frou Frou white pancake makeup on, with a slash of crimson lipstick, making him look crazier than ever. \nSNATCHER How's that for an entrance! \nTrout, Pickles and Gristle emerge from beneath the machine. \nMR. PICKLES (CHEERING) Dramatical! \nMR. TROUT Don't you mean \"dramatic\"? \nMr. Gristle laughs insanely. \nSnatcher hits a lever and a large MECHANICAL ARM unfolds from the drill. Snatcher laughs heartily as he plays with his new toy, opening and closing the CLAW at the arm's end. He swings the claw at stalactites, sending them crashing to the ground. \nEGGS AHH! \nEggs shoves boxtrolls out of the way as the rocks fall to the cavern floor. \nSome jump out of the way and Snatcher swings again, sending the clawed arm into Eggs' nook, smashing the music machine. \nEggs drags boxtrolls towards the pneumatic tubes -- but they stay in their boxes refusing to move. \nEGGS (CONT'D) Get up! That thing will kill you! \nSNATCHER My, my, what a surprise. Don't look like your little friends wanna run, does it? (THEN) How strange, how peculiar. No, wait, it's exactly as I expected! \nEggs stacks a group of boxtrolls under the tubes, all of them still tucked into their boxes, and pleads. \nEGGS You have to get up. Please! \nSNATCHER NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, TRUBSHAW! \nEggs turns the anchor switch and the boxes start to rise into the tubes. The mecha box's claw arm GRABS the tube and rips it out of the machine. Cocoa falls! There's no way out. \nEggs jumps out of the way as the mecha claw arm drops the tube overhead. He rights himself and gasps up at Snatcher in at the mecha drill controls. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) Time to earn my white hat! \nSnatcher pulls another LEVER and releases the VACUUM ARM. It slithers toward a group of boxtrolls. Eggs whimpers as Snatcher hits the lever's BUTTON to begin the suction. \nThe boxtrolls in front of Eggs get sucked up by the mecha box's vacuum arm. He tries to hold on a boxtroll mid-suction but it is ripped away. \nEGGS No! \nThe mecha box's vacuum arm turns on other boxtrolls. \nSweets and Knickers grab hold of boulders. Knickers nearly loses his/her bottom box as he/she is hoovered up. Sweets' teeth are sucked out of his mouth, then he is sucked up. \nA panicked Eggs looks around, eyes wide. \nEGGS (CONT'D) Fish! Shoe! \nEggs grabs Fish and Shoe by their arms, where they try to hold themselves together. He tries to run with them in tow. Gristle clubs Shoe toward the vacuum arm with his cricket bat, where he is sucked up. \nEggs and Fish huddle together as Snatcher rides up, headlights blaring. Eggs has to shield his eyes from the blinding light. \nEggs picks Fish up, wrapping his arms around the box as best he can. \nEGGS (CONT'D) NO! Please! \nSNATCHER Give up, Trubshaw! Boxtrolls lost looooong time ago. These miserable pests will never be a match for a man with dream! (THEN) MR. GRISTLE! \nEggs holds Fish tightly and tries to run but Gristle fires his bolas gun after him. It wraps around them and they fall to the ground. Eggs lands hard and hits his head, knocking him unconscious. Fish peeks out of his box, fretting. \nFISH Eggs? Eggs? \nSnatcher flips levers and switches, grinding gears and sending flames out of the drill's FURNACE GRILL as the machine stands. He points to Eggs. \nSNATCHER ACQUIRE THEM! \nAs Snatcher stomps away, the Redhats step in and pull Fish out of the bolas rope. Fish's head comes out of his box and screams. \nFISH (SNARLS FEROCIOUSLY) \nHe HISSES AND BARES HIS TEETH at the Redhats! Pickles and Trout jump back! Gristle knocks Fish unconscious with the butt of his rifle. Trout and Pickles recoil. \nMR. PICKLES Never seen one do that before! \nMR. GRISTLE THAT BOXTROLL WAS MAD! \nGristle walks back toward the mecha box, laughing. Pickles look shocked at Fish's flaccid body. Trout picks up the limp Eggs and slings him over his shoulder. \nMR. PICKLES Goodness always triumphs over evil... right Mr. Trout? (Trout walks away) Mr. Trout? \nPickles picks up Fish and follows Trout. \nMR. PICKLES (CONT'D) (CONVINCING HIMSELF) I'm still sixty to seventy percent certain that's us. A couple of good guys vanquishing evil and all that. \nON EGGS in the mecha drill's CAGE. He lies passed out atop a pile of boxtrolls. As the mecha box climbs back up the hole, it pushes a huge stalagmite over and the rest of the cavern collapses down around it. \nINSIDE THE MECHA BOX CAGE, EGGS' SEMI CONSCIOUS POV: he looks at the home he once knew, now destroyed. His eyes close. \nA beat. Then... \nSNATCHER Well, good speech. \nSnatcher pulls a lever, and-- \nSMASH! The box crusher flattens the entire pile of boxtrolls. \nEGGS No! No! No! NOOOOOO! (CRYING) Fish, Shoe, Sparky... \nHerbert is smiling and mumbling the same thing over and over. \nHERBERT Look what you did. Look what you did! (laughs) \nEGGS (TEARFUL) Yeah. Yeah look what I did. They're crushed. \nSnatcher appears, coming up the stairs. Eggs looks up at Snatcher in horror. \nMR. TROUT (REGRETFULLY) Hey, Boss, your monsters are all loaded. \nSNATCHER (staring right at Eggs) All but one. \nEggs looks up, terrified. \nCUT TO: \n(2100 SAS) SNATCHER'S   ASCENSION \nEXT. CHEESEBRIDGE - WORLD VIEW - JUST BEFORE DAWN \nThe wide view of rooftops and chimneys in golden morning light is marred by the SMOKE of a coal furnace. The Mecha Box Drill makes its way slowly up the hillside town. \nEXT. CHEESEBRIDGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nSnatcher's amplified voice booms out of a scratchy loudspeaker and through the sleepy morning streets, rousing the townsfolk. Lights appear in windows. \nSNATCHER (O.S.) Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of Cheesebridge, come out of your homes! The curfew has been lifted! \nQUICK SHOTS OF TOWNSPEOPLE, the reverse of the opening scene of the movie: \n- A man OPENS his peep-hole and looks around. \n- Another OPENS his door and looks up as a shadow passes over his house. \n- A MOTHER swings her door open and a LITTLE BOY rushes outside to see: Snatcher riding atop the giant mecha drill as it lumbers up the winding streets towards Market Square. Trout and Pickles follow behind, with Mr. Gristle riding the back of the Mecha Drill. \nTOWNSFOLK BOY Whoah! What is it? \nFEMALE TOWNSFOLK 1 It's Snatcher! \nSNATCHER Fear not, the monsters have been vanquished! Your streets are SAFE! \nMR. GRISTLE (VERY MENACING) SAAAFE! \nTrout and Pickles walk along behind the machine, amongst the gathering crowd, worried. \nThe townspeople smile in relief and wonder, and step out of their doors. \nMALE TOWNSFOLK (?) The curfew is over? \nMR. TROUT Yeah... \nFEMALE TOWNSFOLK 1 That's incredible. \nThey begin to follow after the mecha drill. \nSNATCHER Join me! Your purger of pests! Your white knight who has taken back the night! \nAs Snatcher continues his ascension, all kinds of townspeople, women, children, rush to join the parade. The Mecha Drill's heavy iron legs smash into the cobblestones as it walks up the hill. \nEXT. MARKET SQUARE - CHEESE GUILD - DAWN \nThe crowd arrives at the stairs of the guild with the mecha box. Snatcher beams with pride as he calls out through the whiney loudspeaker. \nSNATCHER Lord Portley-Riiiiind! \nThe door cracks open and Lord Portley-Rind looks out. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) I come bearing the most delightful news. \nHe blinks in amazement at the scene before him - Snatcher atop a giant machine, a huge expectant crowd around him. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Mr. Snatcher, what the devil is this? \nSNATCHER (TRIUMPHANT CHUCKLE) Show him lads. \nThe Redhats release the crushed boxes from the cage so they fan out dramatically at the foot of the stairs. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) Flattened to extinction. Every last, slimy one of them. \nThe crowd applauds. \nUp at her balcony, Winnie hears the noise and comes out to investigate. \nWINNIE (GASP) \nSNATCHER Your lordship, I said I would not rest until I caught every last boxtroll and I am a man of my word. \nHe hits a switch and the mechanical arm swings around to present Eggs, wearing the evil-boxtroll costume Mr. Gristle wore in the Madame Frou Frou show. The mask covers Eggs' face and his hands are bound behind his box. His feet and hands are covered with grotesque claws. \nSNATCHER With this hat, I, Archibald Penelope Snatcher... \nTrout begins to lower Eggs into the furnace. He and Pickles are sweating, intensely reluctant to kill the boy. Portley- Rind slowly begins to lower the white hat onto Snatcher's head. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND With profound esteem for dairy and dairy products... proudly swear to uphold the dignity of the White Hat. \nThe hat creeps lower as Portley-Rind matches the last boxtroll's progress toward the flames. \nSNATCHER (repeating after Portley- RIND) (MORE) \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) Proudly swear to uphold the dignity of the White Hat. \nSuddenly, Winnie bursts out the front doors and sees Eggs moving closer and closer to death. \nWINNIE Father! Father! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Not now, Winifred! \nExasperated, Winnie runs to Pickles and Trout. \nWINNIE STOP! STOP! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (O.S.) And henceforth, whereupon and thereupon... the placing of this hat... we shall conclude by... ushering our newest member into a world of privilege, pride, and pasteurized dairy! \nMR. TROUT I can't, miss. Apologies. \nMR. PICKLES We're just doing our jobs. \nWINNIE Your JOBS? Are you pest exterminators or evil henchmen?! \nMR. PICKLES (long, hurt gasp) I knew that's how people saw us. \nON EGGS, mumbling against his mouth gag. \nWINNIE You don't have to do this! \nMR. TROUT She has a point, Mr. Pickles. This could be our chance for redemption. \nMR. PICKLES A second chapter! \nMR. TROUT People love a flawed hero! \nThe FEET of Eggs' BOXTROLL COSTUME are licked by flames as he creeps closer to the furnace. \nWINNIE (HURRIEDLY) Sure, yes, whatever! Just let him go! \nPickles and Trout stare at each other, unsure of what to do. \nON SNATCHER and the white hat hovering so tantalizingly close to his head. \nON EGGS as he shuts his lids tightly against the coal fire. \nON the One Man Band, who is looking a little tired and sweaty from a really long drum-roll. \nBack to Trout and Pickles, who smile at each other. \nMR. TROUT Yeah? (at Mr. Pickles' nod) Yeah. \nTrout stops the machine and the mechanical arm reverses it's direction, moving Eggs away from the fire. \nEGGS (behind the gag) Huh? \nSnatcher growls as Lord Portley-Rind swiftly pulls his white hat away. \nON the One Man Band as he finally stops his drum-roll, and collapses exhausted. \nTrout and Pickles turn to Winnie. \nMR. PICKLES Redeemed! \nMR. TROUT (TO WINNIE) Thank you, miss. \nGristle LUNGES IN, seizes the controller. \nMR. GRISTLE Ha HA! \nWINNIE (PROTESTS) STOP IT! \nWinnie tries to take the controller from Gristle, but he snaps his teeth at her menacingly. \nGristle turns the mecha drill arm back on! Eggs resumes his descent. \nMr. Trout pulls Winnie out of the way. \nMR. TROUT Watch yourself. \nThe tips of Eggs' boxtroll-suited feet are licked by the flames, and he pulls them up out of the way. \nGristle laughs heartily at Eggs' precarious situation. \nMR. GRISTLE Ha Ha HAAAAA! \nIn the quiet hush of the ceremony, suddenly a faint sound can be heard GROWING LOUDER. \nHERBERT (O.S.) Jelly! JELLY! Jelly! \nGristle turns to the sound. \nMR. GRISTLE Hmm? \nSHOPKEEPER LADY Herbert Trubshaw? \nMALE WORKMAN A The inventor? \nSHOPKEEPER LADY Alive? \nThe crowd murmurs angrily. \nCROWD (OVERLAPPING) Oh get out of here. / Snatcher said he was killed. / How can that be? / How is this possible? / He lied to us? \nSHOPKEEPER B Snatcher lied! \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND He lied to us and to poor Madame Frou Frou! \nEveryone turns toward Portley-Rind as he looks around for Snatcher. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) Snatcher! \nBut Snatcher is gone. \nSuddenly the shrill accent of Madame Frou Frou rises above the crowd. They look up as the mechanical arm of the mecha box drops Snatcher into the cockpit. \nMADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER (taunting in Frou Frou's VOICE) We could've been somezing special, but you've broken our agreement. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND Why is he talking like Madame Frou - Oh my God! (BOWS HEAD) I regret so much. \nSnatcher pulls levers and grinds gears again. The crowd gasps and shrinks away from him. He turns the mecha box toward Portley-Rind and uses the mechanical arm to reach for the white hat. \nSNATCHER (in Snatcher's voice) I'll take my white hat now. \nPortley-Rind ducks and weaves to avoid the huge, snapping claw. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND AHHHH! \nSnatcher gets frustrated and SMASHES THE STAIRS! Portley-Rind sprints off the stairs and out into the square. \n(2350 BTL) BATTLE REDUX \nPortley-Rind sprints off the stairs and out into the square as Snatcher SMASHES TENTS WITH THE CLAW! Snatcher drives the mecha box, stomping after him and right toward the crowd. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) RUN! \nLord Portley-Rind runs through the square and the mecha box chases him, SMASHING the tent out of the way with its giant iron fist! \nThe frightened townspeople SCREAM and run! \nARISTOCRAT MALE A The curfew's back on! IT'S BACK ONNN! \nCROWD AHHHH! \nCUT TO EGGS AND THE GANG as Fish finishes putting on his box. \nEGGS No more hiding, right? \nFISH (GURGLES \"RIGHT!\") \nFish nods. Eggs turns to Knickers. \nEGGS (DETERMINED) RIGHT? \nKnickers flashes his best `angry face' and throws down his box, preferring to fight in his FRILLY UNDERWEAR! \nKNICKERS (GURGLES a war cry) \nEGGS (to all the boxtrolls) You built that thing! You can take it apart! \nEggs charges forward with all the boxtrolls! \nEGGS AND BOXTROLLS ROAWRRR! \nCUT TO Portley-Rind cowering behind Snatcher's vehicle, holding his white hat to his head. Snatcher stalks by in the background, the mecha box drill sending cobbles flying. \nSNATCHER Loooord POORTLEY-RIIIIND! (SMASHES TENTS) Come out, come out, come out! \nSuddenly, the mecha box lurches. Snatcher loses his footing. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) Whoah whoa. \nSnatcher looks down and sees boxtrolls climbing up the legs, tearing pieces off. Shoe hisses at him. \nCUT TO shots of hero boxtrolls wreaking havoc on the machine: \n- Sweets grabs a pulley cable on one of the mecha drill legs. \nSWEETS (GURGLING SWEARS) Chmeey! @#$%&! \nEGGS (TO SWEETS) Tear it down! \nSweets bites the cable and it snaps in half. \n- Sparky and Bucket remove pieces of the motor and get SHOCKED! They look a little charred as they pull out electrical elements and throw them away. \n- Knickers rages, wailing on the side of the machine in his frilly underpants. He smashes his paws through a piece of sheet metal, pulling out a hose. It releases steam as he hold the hose triumphantly over his head. \nSNATCHER Get your grimy paws off of my machine! \nSnatcher pulls a lever and the furnace ROARS to life, spewing flames from the front grill. The boxtrolls near the grill cringe away. \nSnatcher deploys the spinning chassis. The box rotates, picking up speed as the boxtrolls try to hang on. They grab on to each other when they lose grip on the mecha box. Fish holds on to Eggs' ankles. \nSNATCHER Stop destroying my indestructible machine! \nEggs barely ducks out of the way and falls, catching a hold of the arm joint and scrambling up to the front of the box. \nSnatcher keeps swinging the wrench again - KLANG! -, tracking Eggs. He SMASHES the left headlight of the mecha drill and reels back to swing again when-- \nEggs grabs onto a lever, pulls it hard, and the mecha box tilts violently back, sending Snatcher tumbling to the edge. Smoke starts coming out of the furnace. \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) AHHHHHHH!!!! \nEggs presses the red button and THE VACUUM ARM SWINGS DOWN LIKE A GIANT ACCORDION. \nEGGS Fish, grab hold! \nON CUE, Fish and Shoe scream directions. A group of boxtrolls run up to the vacuum arm and grab hold. They form a caterpillar conga-line to stretch it toward THE CENTER OF THE SQUARE. \nFISH (GURGLES \"PULL!\") \nShoe pulls the manhole cover away from the hole. \nON EGGS as he looks out over the square.   Snatcher looms in the furnace smoke. \nEGGS That's right! Pull it over there! \nSuddenly, Snatcher appears behind him. \nSNATCHER YOU FILTHY MONSTER! \nEGGS AHHHH! \nSnatcher grabs Eggs by the shoulders and forces him down over the edge of the mecha drill control booth. \nON THE BOXTROLLS as Fish grabs the mouth of the vacuum and jumps down into the sewer, dangling ABOVE THE WATER! The vacuum can't reach! \nFISH (GURGLED) Uh oh. (GURGLED) IT DOESN'T REACH! \nWINNIE IT DOESN'T REACH! PULL IT HARDER! \nON EGGS as Snatcher grasps his neck, threatening. \nSNATCHER (with effort, strangling EGGS) You think you can win and live happily ever after! They'll never accept the likes of us! \nEggs pushes against Snatcher's chest, trying to get free. \nON WINNIE, SHOE and the others as they STRAIN to pull the vacuum arm closer. Trout and Pickles have joined in. \nWINNIE ALL TOGETHER! \nMR. TROUT Now! \nMR. PICKLES Pull! \nCLOSE ON the mecha box's legs as they are dragged toward the manhole, pushing up cobblestones as they go. \nWITH Fish as the tube reaches the water. He scrambles up the vacuum tube as it crashes into the water, hard. \nMEANWHILE, Snatcher and Eggs struggle, their hands on each others' throats. \nEGGS I'm nothing like you. You're the monster! \nSnatcher pulls him close and GROWLS. \nSNATCHER MONSTER? \nSnatcher GROWLS and rears back with the wrench! Eggs reaches over and SLAMS down the vacuum ON SWITCH! \nSNATCHER (CONT'D) (SURPRISED) Huh? \nFOOOMP! Water is sucked up in HUGE GULPS that race up the tube! \nWATER HITS THE RED HOT FURNACE! BOOM! An EXPLOSION of steam and smoke fills the screen, obscuring our view. \nON THE WHITE HAT as it sits on the cobblestones. Lord Portley- Rind picks it up with a chuckle and places it on his head. He twirls his mustache with delight. \nON THE MECHA DRILL as it stands still, steam dissipating around its carcass. The vacuum arm is now just a stump of steel and shredded canvas. \nThe boxtrolls and townsfolk stare at it through the steam. \nA LONG BEAT OF SILENCE is broken by shouts: \nWHITE HATS (O.S.) WE'VE DONE IT!/ HUZZAH!/ THREE CHEERS FOR US! \nSir Langsdale, Sir Broderick, and Sir Boulanger crest the hill at Milk Street, pushing the giant CHEESE WHEEL that rolled into the river. \nSIR LANGSDALE We got the cheese. (they see the devastated SQUARE) Lord... Portley-... Rind? \nThey stand in the entrance to the destroyed square, jaws agape. Glasses broken, an almost blind Gristle stumbles out, looking battered and worn. \nMR. GRISTLE UGH! I HAVE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD. \nGristle looks up to see Snatcher and Eggs still clinging to the mecha box as it falls toward him! He spots Snatcher and watches as the box gets closer... \nMR. GRISTLE (CONT'D) Boss? \nTimbeeeeer! The mecha box drill crashes on to Mr. Gristle and sends Snatcher and Eggs flying SPLAT! into the GIANT CHEESE WHEEL! SMOKE, STEAM, AND MELTED CHEESE SPLATTER EVERYWHERE! \nThe crowd watches while Fish runs to look for Eggs in the huge mound of cheese. Suddenly, Eggs GASPS and breaks through the cheese. Fish rushes to him. \nFISH (CONCERNED) Eggs? EGGS! \n", "test1_input": "INT. BOXTROLL CAVERN - EGGS' NOOK \nCLOSE ON the spinning Quattro Sabatinos record. \nEggs sits hunched over in despair with one finger resting on the music machine, causing it to play very, very, slowly. \nBehind Eggs we see Shoe's face appear. He stares at Eggs. \nBEAT \nShoe throws a bug at Eggs. It bounces off his head. No reaction, so Shoe does it again... still no reaction. \nBEAT \nShoe enters the nook. Eggs looks at him. Shoe holds out two hands full of yummy bugs. \nSHOE (gurgles) Bugs for dinner? \nNothing. \nShoe sighs, and puts a bug in his mouth. \nEGGS (QUIETLY) Why do we do this, Shoe... \nShoe stops eating, opens his mouth as if to answer then pauses, agape. The bug crawls out and up onto the top of his head. Shoe thinks, gurgling. \nEGGS (CONT'D) Carry on like everything is normal? They drag us away and we do nothing... \nThe lucky bug extends it's wings and flies away. Shoe doesn't react. He doesn't know what to say. \nSFX: THE CLOCK GOES OFF SIGNALING TIME TO SLEEP. \nShoe glances out of the cave as the remaining boxtrolls start to make what's left of the communal sleeping pile. \nShoe looks back and forth between Eggs and the sleeping pile. He knows he should stay, but the sleeping pile is really coming together out there. With a whine of frustration for his friend, he shakes off some bugs for Eggs to eat and leaves. \nEggs sighs and looks over to the corner where Fish's old saw and bow lean against the wall. \nThe bugs Shoe left crawl up Eggs' arm and he angrily shoves them away and notices the Quattro Sabatino's RECORD COVER. \nCLOSE ON: The faces of the four singers, each one festooned with an elaborate mustache, and then on to their orange and brown striped coats and finally focussing on their straw boater hats. Eggs lowers it to reveal-- \nINT. BOXTROLL CAVERN - DRESSING AREA - LATER \n--Eggs REFLECTION IN AN OLD CRACKED MIRROR. He is wearing a disguise based on the singers from the Quattro Sabatino's record cover (which he holds in his hand). He has made a striped jacket by sewing strips of orange fabric to an old coat and found a filthy old straw boater. He has even drawn a twirled Van Dyck mustache on his face with a lump of coal. \nEGGS (HOPEFUL) I look like one of them. (DOUBTFUL) (SIGH) Sort of. \nHe looks at the pile of sleeping boxtrolls as they snore. He looks back at the mirror. \nEGGS (CONT'D) (DETERMINED) I'll find you, Fish! \nHe tiptoes out into the cavern and sneaks off into the shadows. \nINT. SEWER - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nIn a pitch black sewer, a thin ray of sunlight shoots down from a hole in a manhole cover. \nEggs' filthy hand, wrapped in torn strips of fabric, reaches into the light. Dust motes drift around his hand and glow. The reflected light illuminates Eggs' wide eyed face. \n(0800) DAYLIGHT \nDOWN SHOT: Eggs climbs up toward the manhole. He has to squint at the bright sunlight. \nEGGS POV: Looking up at the manhole until the bright light fills the screen. \nSFX: As we go into the light, the sound of the streets of a bustling city gets louder and louder. \nEXT. MARKET STREET - DAY \nCLOSE ON: A heavy cast iron manhole as it grinds open. Blinding sunlight pours in. \nEggs' dirty face peeks out. His eyes go wide. \nEGGS (AMAZED) Wow... \nKLANG! A fat man steps on the manhole cover and slams it shut. \nEGGS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Ahh! \nA beat. The manhole opens again (KLANG!!), and again is slammed shut as it is driven over, by a CART that stops. \nEggs shoves the manhole open and clambers out. For a second he's reassured at how calm it is then the cart moves off and he is left crouching in the middle of a busy street. He looks up and is BLINDED BY THE SUN. AAARGH! \nDRUM BEATS and a CYMBAL CRASH! Eggs jumps out of the way as a ONE MAN BAND marches through, almost running him over. He's pushed and shoved by a festive crowd... \nEGGS (CONT'D) AHHHH!!! \nTOWNSPERSON 1 Outta the way! \nUntil he backs into an OLD TIMEY BACKDROP painted with lurid images of monstrous boxtrolls stealing a wailing baby. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Get yer picture taken with the Trubshaw Baby!

Once it is wound, she takes her place at center stage, a FAN poised coyly over her face. \nMADAME FROU FROU (CONT'D) Ten years ago a plot was hatched Where evil was with cunning matched Whoever left their doors unlatched Would find their infant children SNATCHED BY BOXTROLLS \nON EGGS watching the show, shocked. \nEGGS What?! \nBack to the show. \nMADAME FROU FROU Oo    no   Boxtrolls \nWinnie and Mr. Pickles, without his red hat and wearing a fake mustache, come dancing out on stage as Papa Trubshaw and Baby Trubshaw.

Then Eggs grabs a pipe on the wall and climbs toward the duct. \nThey swell up larger and larger as Snatcher's face shrinks back down to normal. They drop off one at a time and squish at Snatcher's feet. \nSnatcher flicks off the last few leeches and flips his hair.

There I was, trapped in his sweaty armpit... \nMadame Frou Frou's cabaret cart has been repainted, with a new sign reading \"WINNIE\". Winnie stands mid-stage orating her horrific tale. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) ...Until he swelled like a balloon and.. POP! -- \nBLAM! A boxtroll bursts out of the trapdoor below the stage, releasing a cloud of confetti that explodes everywhere. They perform for a mixed crowd of townspeople and boxtrolls. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) (ARMS WIDE) -- An ocean of guts exploded over us like a hurricane of YUCK! \nThe crowd applauds, townspeople clap their hands and boxtrolls drum their boxes. \nLord Portley-Rind and Lady Cynthia applaud the loudest. \nLORD PORTLEY-RIND My little angel. My weird little angel. \nWinnie curtsies deeply, head down. \nEGGS Winnie! \nWinnie looks up and spots Eggs standing at the edge of the crowd. Under his arm he is holding an old record album. \nWINNIE Huh? \nEGGS (quietly, to Winnie) Where's Fish? \nWINNIE (sotto voce, quietly to EGGS) Uhh. \nWinnie shrugs, \"I don't know\" and starts another story. \nWINNIE (CONT'D) (to the audience) And now I will tell the heroic story of the Naked Boxtrolls and the Crusher of DOOOOOOM! \nWinnie gestures to the stage curtain, which moves to reveal Knickers - wearing only his knickers - standing beneath a mock cardboard `1 TON' WEIGHT. \nEggs walks away from the stage as boxtrolls scramble to get better seats. \nCUT TO: \nThe   square is cleaned up from the battle and there are a few new   additions. Eggs spots Oil Can, hard at work lubricating the   cables for the One Man Band's kick drum. Oil Can smiles and   they both move on to REVEAL: \nA tent with a sign for SPARKY'S SCRAP SHACK - a boxtroll appliance repair service - hanging from it. \nSIR LANGSDALE stands next to his toaster as Bucket and Sparky peer inside it. \nSIR LANGSDALE It hasn't worked right in years! \nBoulanger speeds around the repair tent, making rusty squeaks with each wheel rotation. An excited Oil can squeals and chases Boulanger's wheelchair. \nSIR LANGSDALE (CONT'D) I said I like it burnt, then she says well I don't! So here I am. \n", "test3_true": "EGGS You guys seen Fish? \nBucket and Sparky grunt \"No\" and get back to work. They both raise forks and prepare to plunge them into the toaster. \nEGGS (CONT'D) Thanks! \nEggs walks away as Langsdale backs up. \nSIR LANGSDALE Oh. I... I don't think that's a good idea. \nAs Eggs walks away, a loud BZZZT sound and a bright light go off behind him. \nCUT TO: \nSpecs mans a control switch at a BOXTROLL MANHOLE exit. He throws the switch and Sweets shoots up out of the manhole, blown by a strong wind. He lands just as Eggs walks up. \nEGGS Have you seen Fish? \nSpecs shrugs `No' but Sweets brightens-- \nSWEETS (TOOTHLESS MOUTH) Mushurgle, mushmoogle, mushmushgurgle... \nHe mumbles until his teeth suddenly shoot up out of the manhole. He grabs them, jams them in-- \nSWEETS (CONT'D) Nope. \nSweets walks off. Suddenly the sound of a loud HONK! Eggs looks up as. \nHERBERT (O.S.) Ahh, there he is. \nFISH Eggs! \nSnatcher's vehicle appears. Herbert is driving and Fish is riding in Snatcher's old seat. \nA new logo has been painted over the old silhouette of a rampaging boxtroll. In its place is a kinder silhouette of a boxtroll holding a light bulb, surrounded by a circle made of three arrows - it's the prototype of the international sign for recycling. \nEggs holds up the record - a new copy of the QUATTRO SABATINO'S album from the old music machine. \nEGGS Look what I found! \nFish gurgles happily as Eggs hands him the album and climbs aboard the vehicle. \nHERBERT Brilliant, son! \nCLOSE ON: The record being put on the player on top of the vehicle. The record begins to play. \nFish sits back in Snatcher's old seat, Eggs holds on to the side. \nEGGS And now we go like this. \nFish and Eggs start rocking out, bobbing their heads to the music like they used to. Fish and Eggs hum to the tune. \nHERBERT Ahh. I've missed so much. \nHe joins them in the head-bobbing. \nWIDE: As the music swells we follow the vehicle as it winds it's way across the market and away through the arch. \nAs the music fades away, two familiar silhouettes pause from sweeping up some trash. \nMR. TROUT Aww, ain't that lovely? \nTrout empties his dust bin into a TRASH BARREL. A loud snuffle can be heard. \nMR. PICKLES Yeah... all happy `n tidy. \nShoe sticks his head out of the barrel, covered in dust. \nSHOE (GURGLES ANGRILY) \nMR. TROUT Like the end of a story, if our lives were a story. \nShoe climbs out of the barrel. He pulls Lord Portley-Rind's white hat out of the trash. It is filthy and torn. Shoe frowns at it, tears a frilly ribbon off the top, and tosses the rest back in the trash. \nMR. PICKLES (O.S.) Not sure what we'd do next, though. \nShoe looks around defensively, grunts quietly, and scampers to the center of Market Square. We follow him into the dark as he jumps down an open manhole. \n(2700 CRED) END CREDITS \n(2750 UNV) UNIVERSE \nEXT. MARKET SQUARE - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nPickles and Trout are still awkwardly standing around, not sure what to do next. \nMR. PICKLES Hmm. \nMR. TROUT Just keeping the streets clean... \nMR. PICKLES Free from evil. \nMR. TROUT Yep. \nMR. PICKLES Ya ever think about the universe, Mr. Trout? \nThe camera pulls out gradually -- \nMR. PICKLES (CONT'D) What if our world is just like a tiny speck... \n", "test3_id": 737}

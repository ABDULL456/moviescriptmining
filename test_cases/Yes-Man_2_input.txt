INT. CARL'S NEW OFFICE 
Carl's writing a list of names. The post card lies on the desk nearby. His secretary pops her head in. 
CARL'S SECRETARY The executives are gathering in the conference room to officially greet the KBI Officials. (MORE) 
CARL'S SECRETARY (cont'd) (re: the post card) Cute gorilla. 
CARL It's an elderly orangutan actually. (handing her the list) Could you please call everyone on this list and tell them to show up at Rudy's Bar & Grille this evening at 9PM? 
CARL'S SECRETARY Will do. 
Carl starts to head out and then turns around. 
CARL I just want to say, it was really great having you as my first secretary. 
CARL'S SECRETARY You're not firing me, are you? 
CARL I don't think I'm going to be working here much longer. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM 
Carl walks into the crowded room.   Korean executives and Southwest Bank executives mingle.   Carl heads towards Chris. 
CARL I need to talk to you. 
CHRIS PARKER And I need to talk to you. You mind doing a little ceremonial translating? 
CARL I don't know if I'm good enough at Korean -- 
CHRIS PARKER Believe in yourself and the world believes in you. 
SEUNG sees Carl and bows to him. Carl bows back. The Pretty Korean Banker sees Carl and coquettishly waves to him. Chris TAPS the microphone. The crowd sits down. 
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) I'd like to welcome our new partners into the Southwest family. 
Chris nods to Carl. 
CARL (in Korean, with SUBTITLES) [Welcome. You will be my partner.] 
SEUNG KIM (in Korean) [Thank you.] 
CHRIS PARKER KBI is the at the forefront of the financial world. With your help, Southwest will be as well. 
Carl takes a beat.    Chris looks at him, expectantly. 
CARL (in Korean, with SUBTITLES) [He says that you are a son of a dog and like to have the dirty sex.] 
SEUNG KIM (in Korean) [What?] 
CHRIS PARKER We look forward to working together and extending our reach across the globe. 
CARL (in Korean, with SUBTITLES) [He says in Korea you poop on the ground and that here you cannot poop on the ground.] 
SEUNG KIM (in Korean) [That is factually inaccurate] 
CARL (in Korean) [I know. But it's what the bigot believes.] 
CHRIS PARKER So with this hand shake, I make official the acquisition of Southwest by Korean Bank International. 
Chris holds out his hand. 
CARL (in Korean) [Although you have poop on your hand, I am willing to shake it so I can steal all your money, you stupid Korean.] 
SEUNG KIM No. 
CHRIS PARKER Excuse me? 
SEUNG KIM (perfect English with a British accent) We have a traitor in our midst. This man just called me a son of a dog and informed me that my hand is covered in fecal matter. He is clearly trying to sabotage the merger. 
CARL You speak English? 
SEUNG KIM You think an international bank financier wouldn't speak fluent English? For whom do you work, traitor? Shanghai Bank? Chinatrust? 
CARL For myself. 
SEUNG KIM Fine. Keep it secret. Unfortunately, I cannot approve a merger with a company so incompetent as to have a business saboteur this high up. Good day. 
Seung Kim walks out, followed by all his employees.   Before Chris can say anything... 
CARL I quit. 
Carl leaves. 
INT. RUDY'S - NIGHT 
Peter, Lucy, Rooney, Norman, Tony, Loan Recipients, several Persian Woman -- all of Carl's friends along with everyone that he's met on his Yes journey have gathered at Rudy's. 
PETER Why does he want us here? 
LUCY I have no idea. 
Kath and Seb walk in.

RAOUL AND MICHELLE 
Michelle is amazed at this. 
MICHELLE I have never seen a diamond so large! 
It almost makes Raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in his hand. 
LOUIS Into the maze!  All of you! Disperse, I command you! 
The dwarf releases the pig, poking him through a tiny break in the hedge; the critter skitters as only a pig can, eluding the first laughing lunges of the guests. 
THE PIG CHASE is a merry melee, as the maze becomes a tangle of confusion.  LOUIS climbs to a platform above the top of the ten foot hedge that forms the maze.  From his perch he looks down on all the action, and calls encouragement. 
LOUIS Are you men or mice?! 
MICHELLE squeals as the pig scurries by and Raoul dives for it.  He almost has the pig... then it kicks free. 
RAOUL The pendant will be yours! 
With that he races after the pig. 
MICHELLE tries to follow, this way, that way, through the maze.  Then she stops, face to face with the King, entering through a gate hidden in one of the maze's dead corners. 
LOUIS Michelle, isn't it? 
Speechless, she nods. 
LOUIS I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful. 
MICHELLE Sire, I -- 
LOUIS You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King? 
Her eyes go still; she understands what is happening. 
FROM BEHIND THE GATE, we see d'Artagnan, watching as Louis tries to seduce the young woman.  Even as d'Artagnan watches, the pig comes rooting through the hedge; with a deft movement d'Artagnan catches the animal's leg and lifts it with the sureness of the farm boy he once was.  The pig is quiet and comfortable in d'Artagnan's hands. 
D'Artagnan watches as the King approaches Michelle, and she allows him to touch her cheek.  The king leans to kiss her... Michelle does not move... 
WHHEEEKKKK!  The pig sails over the gate and hits the ground running, right at Louis' feet; it sets him dancing. 
The spell of the king's royal attention is shattered; as the pig scrambles away, Michelle backs away. 
LOUIS Wait!  Michelle, I -- 
Too late, he sees the shadow of the man looming above him, leaping down onto him from the observation platform.  It is the servant who offered the tray to Raoul and Michelle; he has armed himself with a knife from the carving table, and is diving now to plunge the blade into the king's throat. 
The king is helpless, frozen.  The assassin leaps, falling toward the king... and is impaled on the sword of d'Artagnan, springing through the gate to save his king. 
Michelle screams, the king gasps, and the assassin drops, mortally wounded.  They stare down at him now; the would-be assassin gurgles words through his agony... 
ASSASSIN Feed... your... people. 
Party guests, having heard Michelle scream, are running in to find them.  Michelle rushes off, to find Raoul; several people are coming up. 
ASSASSIN Your people starve...!  Feed -- 
The king snatches out his own dagger and imperiously cuts the throat of the dying man, to stop these offensive words.  The king looks at his stunned subjects. 
LOUIS A pitiful madman, nothing more. Come, let us continue our chase! Where is our unicorn? 
The King prances away.  It takes the guests a moment, but they know that only gaiety will please their King, and off they go again, laughing as if nothing happened. 
D'Artagnan stands still as the young Musketeers under his command come rushing up with swords drawn. 
YOUNG MUSKETEER Captain! 
Seeing the dead assassin, their eyes fill with admiration. 
YOUNG MUSKETEER You are the best -- 
D'Artagnan can't even listen; with a last glance at the King he turns quickly and walks away. 
INT.  FORTRESS PRISON 
The Man in the Iron Mask sits on the floor.  A key rattles in the lock and his keeper shuffles in, carrying food. 
KEEPER Food, moron. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK Thank you, Keeper. 
Not watching what he's doing, the bulbous keeper trips on something and stumbles, dropping the food.  The prisoner jumps to his feet, concerned. 
KEEPER Look what you've done!

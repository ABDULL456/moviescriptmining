MIKE (O.S.) Intimidating. Isn't it? 
Riggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Do you have any idea who walked these boards before you? (Beat.) Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando, Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... And now you. Riggan Thomson. 
Riggan, trying to hide the intimidation. 
RIGGAN Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike. I appreciate it. 
MIKE Hey. This is what we do. (Indicates a script.) So, you wrote this adaptation? 
RIGGAN I did. 
(CONTINUED) 
MIKE And you're directing the adaptation and starring... 
RIGGAN I am. 
MIKE Ambitious. 
RIGGAN Thank you. 
A sly smile from Mike. He leaps onto the stage. 
MIKE Why don't we do a bit of it? 
RIGGAN Hey, I wasn't expecting you to-- MIKE First preview is tomorrow, right? 
RIGGAN Yeah, but you can go on with the script until you feel comfortable-- 
MIKE Let's just do some of it. 
Riggan tries to hide his excitement. He grabs the script from a nearby table and walks it over to Mike. 
RIGGAN Take a look at page twenty-- 
MIKE Yeah. I don't need that. 
RIGGAN What? 
MIKE I don't need the script. Just give me a cue. 
RIGGAN What are you talking about? 
MIKE Feed me a line. 
RIGGAN I don't-- What? (CONTINUED) 
MIKE Feed. Me. A line. 
Riggan drops the script and begins the scene. 
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute." 
Mike stares at Riggan, hyper-focused. 
MIKE (Ruminating.) Am I saying that love is absolute? (He transforms.) "Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about is. The kind of love I'm talking about you-- (An intense pause.) Well, you don't try to kill people. 
Riggan is transfixed, and almost immediately intimidated. 
RIGGAN How do you know the lines? 
MIKE I have a thing, a whatever, a gift. (A beat.) Come on, I helped Lesley get off book. Hey, give me that cue again. 
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is--" MIKE Okay, can I-- Do you mind if I-- 
RIGGAN No, go ahead. 
MIKE Follow me. He says, "I'm the wrong person to ask." What's his intention? Is he fed up with the topic? Deflecting? Guilt about his wife maybe? Then four sentences all say the same thing... "I didn't even know the man." (MORE) (CONTINUED) MIKE (CONT'D) "I've only heard his name mentioned in passing." "I wouldn't know." "You'd have to know the particulars." First of all, particulars? What are you, my grandmother? But the point is, YOU DON'T KNOW THE GUY, WE FUCKING GET IT. Make it one line. "I didn't even know the guy." Right? ... 
RIGGAN You pretty much know my lines too, huh? MIKE Can we-- Are we doing something here? Come on let's go. Cut it down, give it to me again. 
RIGGAN "I'm the wrong person to ask--"

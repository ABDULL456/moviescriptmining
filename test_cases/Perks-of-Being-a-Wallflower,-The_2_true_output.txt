END FLASHBACK 
73   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                            73 
Charlie hovers over the glowing luminaria.   Something is bothering him. He shakes it off. 
74   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - NIGHT                74 
Charlie wanders through the quiet house. He turns the corner where he finds Chris sitting at the table. He's lit by a couple of candles and the blinking lights of the Christmas Tree. He's surrounded by leftovers. Charlie sits. 
CHARLIE Hey. 
Chris chews and swallows.      Famished.   They both whisper. 
CHRIS Hey. God, I missed mom's cooking.        You have no idea how good you have it.       I'm actually beginning to hate pizza. 
Charlie smiles.    Grabs a Hershey Kiss cookie. 
CHARLIE How are you liking school? 
CHRIS Not bad.    I'm no brainiac like you or Candace.    But I'm doing okay. 
CHARLIE Okay?    You're playing in a Bowl Game. 
Chris laughs. Charlie smiles.      A moment passes.      Chris changes his tone. Cautious. 
CHRIS How are you feeling, Charlie? 
CHARLIE Good. 
CHRIS You know what I mean.      Is it bad tonight? 
CHARLIE No. 
CHRIS No? 
CHARLIE I'm not picturing things anymore. And when I do, I can just shut it off. 
CHRIS (relieved) CHRIS (CONT'D) now. And maybe if it does get bad again, you can just talk to them, yeah? 
CHARLIE Yeah. Especially Sam. I'm going to ask her out at New Years. I think the time is right now. 
Chris smiles at his kid brother.   We hear the church organ. 
75   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CHURCH - MORNING                             75 
The family moves down the line to receive Holy Communion at Christmas Mass. Charlie's father, then mother, then sister, take the sacrament. Charlie is next. The PRIEST makes the motion of the cross with the communion wafer. He places it in Charlie's hand. Charlie brings the sacrament to his mouth with his fingers... 
MATCH CUT TO: 
76   INT. BOB'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    76 
We move in closer to Charlie's fingers in his mouth. When he takes his hand out, we see... a tab of LSD. The church organ is now a rock organ. And it's now... New Year's Eve. 
Charlie closes his mouth. He looks down the hall of the smoky room where Craig has his arm around Sam. Charlie turns to Mary Elizabeth, who's also dosed. 
CHARLIE How long does this take to work? 
77   EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          77 
About 45 minutes. The sound is muted thick. Slight echoes. Charlie shovels the snow. Crunch. Fascinated by his breath making fog. Sam comes outside. She's worried about him. 
SAM Shoveling snow, huh? 
CHARLIE I have to get this driveway clean. Then, I have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it. 
SAM You said that an hour ago. 
CHARLIE Was that tonight? God. I was looking at this tree, but it was a dragon, and then 
SAM Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out. Just give me the shovel. Calm down. Look up. 
She points.   Charlie looks up.   Sees the stars.

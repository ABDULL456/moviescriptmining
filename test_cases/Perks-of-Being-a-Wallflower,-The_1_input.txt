CHARLIE Sure. My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner. You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night. It's a tradition. 
SAM That sounds like fun. 
CHARLIE Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore. 
SAM Yes, I will. 
Sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room.   They stand next to each other. Close. 
SAM (CONT'D) I had lunch with Craig today. 
CHARLIE Yeah? 
SAM He said he was sorry, and that I was right to break up with him. But I'm driving away, and I just felt so small. Just asking myself why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing? 
CHARLIE We accept the love we think we deserve. 
He says it sober. Without judgement. Sam lets it sink in. Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing. Then, she turns to him. 
SAM Then, why didn't you ever ask me out? 
Charlie didn't expect that.       He is silent.   Heart pounding. 
CHARLIE I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted that. 
SAM Well, what did you want? 
CHARLIE I just want you to be happy. 
SAM Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel that. It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. I don't want to be somebody's crush. I want people to like the real me. 
CHARLIE I know who you are, Sam. 
Sam waits.    And Charlie finally speaks from the heart. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I know I'm quiet, and I know I should speak more, but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant. How much we are alike. And how we've been through the same things. And you're not small. You're beautiful. 
He can't contain himself anymore. He moves to her and kisses her. They stand. Move to the bed. Kissing. Charlie's heart pounds. They sit on the bed. Still kissing. 
We see her fingertips. Her hand on Charlie's knee. When she touches him, Charlie pulls away from her. Shocked. Like he's seen a ghost. It hits Charlie like freezing water. 
SAM What's wrong, Charlie? 
CHARLIE Oh, ah... nothing. 
Charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues 
149   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                          149 
It's like a dream for Charlie. He watches Sam hug Alice and Mary Elizabeth goodbye. But Charlie is somewhere else. 
SAM I'll call all the time. 
MARY ELIZABETH Promise. 
SAM And we'll all see each other in New York. 
SAM'S MOM Come on, Sam. 
Charlie can't take it. He moves to the side of the truck and puts in the last suitcase. He looks over at Sam. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
150   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      150 
QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers kissing Sam the night before. Her hand touches Charlie's knee. 
BACK TO PRESENT: 
151   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                          151 
Charlie snaps himself out of it. He turns back as Mary Elizabeth and Alice part ways. Charlie locks eyes with Sam. They take a moment. And then they come together to hug. She kisses him goodbye, trying not to cry.

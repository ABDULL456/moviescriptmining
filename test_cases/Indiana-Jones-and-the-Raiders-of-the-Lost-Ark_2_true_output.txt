Up at the hole, there's plenty of dissension. 
BELLOQ The girl was mine! 
SHLIEMANN She is of no use to us. Only our mission for the Fuhrer matters. 
Shliemann glances meaningfully around at the other Nazis. 
SHLIEMANN I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind. 
Belloq feels how much he is the outsider, his own vulnerability. He backs down with the wisdom of survival. He turns to look down at Indy and Marion. His manner is gallant. 
BELLOQ Goodbye, mademoiselle. (a pause, then with respect) Indiana Jones... adieu! 
Belloq and the others step back from the hole and unseen Nazis slam the heavy stone door into place. Marion screams. Her scream is accompanied by - 
A huge WHOOSH! as air is sucked out and the chamber is sealed. Half of the torches still burning go out with the sound. The remaining torches continue to extinguish at punctuating intervals throughout the following action and the snakes immediately flood into the newly-darkened spaces. Indy puts Marion down and snatches up two burning torches. He hands one to Marion. 
INDY Don't panic. There's plenty of time for that later. Wave that at anything that slithers. 
Indy holds his torch out like a lantern and begins a slow O- turn, his eyes peering into the gloom, examining every inch of wall and ceiling. 
MARION What are you doing? 
INDY Just watch the floor. 
Reminded of the encroaching snakes, Marion waves her torch at the nearest edge of their circle. She looks faint. Indy continues his slow turn. 
MARION Whatever you're doing, do it faster. 
INDY (he spots something) There! 
His head whips around, looking at the pillars around the room. He sees what he wants. He grabs one of the oil canisters, looks back to the spot on the wall he's chosen and splashes oil on the floor in that direction, then lights it. A path opens toward that wall. 
INDY Come on! 
Marion is frozen in her spot. Indy drags her after him. He splashes oil the rest of the way to the wall. It lights and Indy pulls Marion over to the wall. He pours the remaining oil in a circle around them, creating a safe zone there. 
INDY Stay here! 
MARION (grabbing him) Where are you going? 
INDY I'll be back in a minute. We're going through this wall. 
Marion looks at the wall, which looks like all the rest to her. She thinks he's crazy. 
INDY Just keep your eyes open and get ready to run. No matter what happens to me. 
MARION (panicked) What do you mean? 
Too late. Indy runs back through the path of flames to the center of the room. Snakes strike as his flying heels. Indy reaches the base of the pillar which he touched briefly on his original descent. He uses his torch to clear away the scattered snakes climbing on it, then pulls out his whip. He draws it back, then wraps is solidly around the pillar 15 feet up. With the torch in his mouth, he begins climbing the pillar. It moves ominously under his weight. 
The last two torches still burning on the floor go out. Now the only light in the chamber is provided by the torches held by Indy and Marion and the dwindling oil flames. Snakes move in and surround the base of Indy's pillar. The path between Marion and the center of the room is overrun. The circle of flame around Marion is dying down. She looks beyond it with terror-widened eyes, then up through the increasing smoke at the distant Indy. 
Near the top of the pillar, Indy's hands strain along his taut whip, which he has moves higher. A snake slithers into view there, inches from Indy's straining face. Indy turns his head so the torch in his mouth can burn it. The snake falls from the pillar. Indy's torch is dwindling. Indy works his body around so that he is on the side of the pillar away from Marion. The pillar moves, showering dust. Indy looks at the chamber wall five feet away, takes a breath and swings his legs up against it. He is now braced between pillar and wall. 
MARION (O.S.) (screaming) Where are you?!

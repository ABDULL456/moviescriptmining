CADEN AND ADELE'S HOUSE - FALL 2005 - MORNING 5 \nCaden steps out the front door in his bare feet and hurries down the driveway in the rain. He picks up the newspaper, pulls the mail from the box. As he heads back inside, he flips through the mail. There's a magazine called Attending to your Illness addressed to Caden. A diseased person on the cover. Across the street a gaunt man watches Caden, unseen. \n6INT.

CADEN AND ADELE'S CAR - WINTER 2006 - NIGHT 10 \nAdele drives and coughs spasmodically. The car swerves a bit. Caden has a bandaged head and a prescription in his hand. Olive, in her car seat, sings. Caden sees revelers in winter coats and party hats outside a house. They blow noisemakers and yell \"happy new year!\" \nOLIVE \n(SINGING) It's a beautiful day and the sun is shining and yellow.

Caden rubs his temples, then heads to the back of the house, pulling out his cell phone. He exits the theater. \n13 INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER LOBBY - 2006 - DAY 13 \nCaden passes the box office.

SCHENECTADY THEATER BOX OFFICE - 2006 - CONTINUOUS 15 \nHazel reads the first page of Swann's Way. The other volumes of In Search of Lost Time are stacked neatly nearby. She looks up and sees Caden standing outside the box office window watching her. \nHAZEL I keep reading the first line. It's a good line, I think. But I don't know much about literature. \nCADEN Maybe you should read the first line of another series of books. \nHAZEL I'm trying to better myself, Caden. Recommend me something.

Hazel looks at her book, re-reads the first sentence. \n16 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - 2006 - NIGHT 16 \nCaden sits on the toilet. He finishes, looks in the bowl. His bowel movement is dark and loose. \n17 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BEDROOM - 2006 - NIGHT17 \nAdele lies in bed asleep.

Hazel looks back from her seat at Caden and mouths the word \"yay.\" He smiles. The curtain rises on a dark stage. Tom, as Willy, gets out of the car parked center stage and walks into the kitchen. \nTOM (AS WILLY) Oh boy, oh boy. \nCLAIRE (AS LINDA) Willy! \nTOM (AS WILLY) It's all right, I came back. \nCLAIRE (AS LINDA) Why?

She backs away and gets lost in the crowd. Caden massages his temples. Suddenly Hazel is next to him. \nHAZEL I figured I'd better get in fast. \nCADEN Hey! \nHAZEL I loved it! And, by the way, Claire is trouble. And not terribly bright. Caden laughs. \nHAZEL (CONT'D) Just wanted you to know the word on the street. \n(CONTINUED) \nSYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 22. \n23 CONTINUED: (2)23 \nCADEN So you liked it? \nHAZEL Are you kidding?

I don't know how to do that. \nCADEN I want you to be sad that we had something really special and it's going away! \nHAZEL It just happened, Caden. I didn't plan it. You were with Claire. This probably isn't going to go anywhere, sweetie. I'm still your girl. \nCADENHAZEL'S VOICE Oh, Haze. C'mon. It's just dinner. He's got stories! It just seems fun. \nCADEN He has stories about me! \nHAZEL Caden, I know everything about you and it's all adorable. I love you and I always will. So don't worry. I gotta go, I'm there.

CADEN'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM - 2032 - LATER157 \nLooks like there's been a horrible struggle. The bed is covered with blood.

Hazel rolls her eyes, drives down an exit ramp. \n161 EXT. BURNING HOUSE STREET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2032 - DAY 161 \nHazel drives the golf cart down the street in a state of near completion. She stops in front of a replica of her house. \nCADEN Hank! Okay! The house begins to smoke. \nTAMMY My house! Tammy kisses Caden on the cheek and runs into the house. \nHAZEL Is there no end to your pussy kissing? \nCADEN It's verisimilitudinous. I'm thinking of that as a title. \nHAZEL Whatever. I've got work to do. Tell your girlfriend to get out here if she wants a ride back. \nCADEN She's not my girlfriend. \nHAZEL Give it a rest, Caden.

They are followed by Caden and Hazel. \nSAMMY Jeremy is playing to us. Tell him he simply needs to talk to Donna. We'll hear what we hear. Tammy takes down the note. \nCADEN Sammy's explaining too much. Feels expository. Needs to be shorthand, like, \"Jeremy big.\" Hazel writes that down. They all continue down the hall. \nTAMMY Caden? Can we stop for a second? \nCADEN Sure. \nTAMMY If Hazel's in love with Sammy and Caden's in love with Hazel, there would be a dramatic confrontation, where Caden turns to me and says, \"It's obvious he's a substitute for me.\" I think then Hazel could have a good moment where she cries or gets angry. I'm not sure which yet, but it feels dramatically sound. \nHAZEL That didn't happen, Caden. \nTAMMY I think Hazel would do that, Hazel. \nHAZEL But Hazel hasn't done it, Tammy. \n(CONTINUED) \nSYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007104. \n162CONTINUED: 162 \nTAMMYCADEN Caden?

He fucks me without crying. \nCADEN That happened one time! You fucked him? \nHAZEL Yes! And you and I only fucked one time that's why you only cried one time! I give you endless opportunities. \nCADEN What do you mean, he's available? Since when are you available? \nHAZEL Derek left. Because of you! \nCADEN When? How come you never told me? \nHAZEL I don't know, Caden. How come a lot of things? It's not like we can start fresh, like Sammy and I can. There's all this pressure on us.

(looking in book) Derek is played by Joe -- \nCADENHAZEL Stop, okay. Just stop. I don't like Tammy and she's nothing like me. How can you like her? Joe Abernathy. \nOLIVE Of course. She introduced me to myself. To my vagina and to hers. \nCADEN You have no idea how evil she is. \nOLIVE I need to forgive you before I die, but I can't forgive someone who has not asked for forgiveness. \nCADEN \nI -- \nOLIVE I have no time! I need you to ask for forgiveness! \nCADEN (long pause) Can you ever forgive me? \nOLIVE For what? \nCADEN For abandoning you. \nOLIVE \"For abandoning you to have anal sex with my homosexual lover Eric.\" \nCADEN For abandoning you to be have anal sex with my homosexual lover Eric. \nOLIVE (long hesitation) No. No, I'm sorry, I cannot.

Caden gets up and leaves. \nSYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007115. \n175 EXT. NYC STREET - SUMMER 2045 - DAY175 \nIt's sweltering. Caden sits on his stoop, holding some dead flower petals, watching the world pass by. People are sick, angry. Some people wear gas masks. Government vehicles with strange symbols and gun turrets drive by. A woman walks a naked man on a leash. He defecates on the sidewalk. A wild- eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden. As he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him, Caden sees the t-shirt has a little dot: a painting from Adele's show. It's a moment in time, a street scene very much like the one Caden's in. In the painting, a man in a white t- shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden. The flower petals blow away. Caden tries to limp after them. \n176 EXT. NYC STREET - 2045 - DAY 176 \nCaden dials his cell phone. \nHAZEL'S ANSWERING MACHINE It's Hazel. Leave a message or don't. Your dime. \nCADEN My love. I know how to do the play.

WAREHOUSE SET) - 2048 - NIGHT 177 \nCaden weeps inconsolably at the director's table, Michael the pre-Hazel assistant is back, neat and efficient-looking, but old now. Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor. The scene in the play is dull. People walk back and forth aimlessly. Various passersby on the street have hacking coughs. Tammy steps out of the bathroom, meanders over to the director's table. Hazel's sweater is on Michael's chair- back. She casually pulls it off and tries it on. Caden watches. She looks so much like Hazel now, it's unbearable. He looks away. Millicent walks by carrying a mop and bucket. \nCADEN I need a Caden for my Hazel. \nMILLICENT I... I'd very much like to play Caden. \nCADEN Um... \n(CONTINUED) \nSYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 115A. \n177CONTINUED:177 Tammy watches intently.

I think I understand Caden. \nCADEN I don't understand him. \nMILLICENT Caden Cotard is a man already dead, living in a half-world between stasis and antistasis. Time is concentrated and chronology confused for him. Up until recently he has strived valiantly to make sense of his situation, but now he has turned to stone. \nCADEN Okay. That sounds good. \nMICHAEL She's right? I didn't see that at all. I saw it all as more hopeful. \n178INT.

I'm not very bright. And since I put on that weight, I don't get the looks I used to. It's not that bad. Lots of people have it worse. I've got a job and place to stay. Adele is nice to me. And so smart and talented. I don't understand her artwork, but that's just me. I wish I'd gone to college. I feel stupid around educated people like Adele. Eric was too smart for me, too.

Ellen, in a terrycloth robe, is at the stove making scrambled eggs. Toast pops from the toaster and Ellen crosses to get it. She passes a mirror, glances at herself, seems momentarily surprised, pushes a wisp of hair behind her ear and continues to the toaster. Eric enters. He's an unhealthily thin middle-aged man. He doesn't acknowledge her, nor she him. He pours himself coffee. \nELLEN I'm making eggs. \n(BEAT) Is everything okay, Eric? \nERIC Everything's everything. \n185INT.

A child, at least. Children. Meaning. I am always on the verge, never more than a tiny shove from tears. I can feel them in my chest now. That squeezing pressure. And it is so tempting to let go, but I am afraid, the next time maybe, I will never stop crying. I miss my husband even though he is lying here. He hates me. Oh God. I have disappointed him and he hates me. The one person who should be able to see me and he won't look. He will never look again. \n188INT. 31Y WALK-IN CLOSET (INT.

She grabs her coat, tosses the note into the trash, and storms out and down the stairs. \nCADEN That's great, you guys. Sammy sits at the table and starts to write on scraps of paper. Hazel hovers behind him, watching. \nCADEN (CONT'D) Beautiful, Sammy. Caden leaves the set and steps onto his platform. \nSAMMY Caden, time out? \nCADENSAMMY What's up? I feel we need a Hazel in here. There's a whole side of Caden I'm not able to explore without a Hazel. Caden looks over at Hazel. Claire watches Caden from the street corner. \nCADEN I guess, yeah. Claire walks off in a huff. \nHAZEL I get to be a character? Hooray! \n132INT. ELEVATOR (31Y BUILDING) - 2026 - NIGHT 132 \nCaden rides up. The elevator stops.

He gets a melancholy look on his face. He lies on his back in the form. He sees a note on the night table: \nADELE'S VOICE Hi Ellen. Crackerjack job last night! Would you do sheets again? We had quite a fuck last night and it's musky and gross. Kisses, A. Caden smells the sheets, strips the bed. \nA134 OMITTEDA134 \n134INT. 31Y KITCHEN - 2026 - MORNING134 \nCaden sips coffee at the kitchen table. He's writing a note: \nCADEN'S VOICE Hi Adele. Relined the cabinets. Just wanted to let you know I won a MacArthur Grant and I'm mounting a play, which I think is going to be pure and truthful. Best -- Caden hesitates for a moment, then signs it \"Ellen.\" \n135INT. WAREHOUSE - CLAIRE'S APARTMENT SET - 2026 - DAY 135 \nCaden and Hazel watch as Claire waits in her bathrobe in the kitchen and Sammy enters the \"apartment.\" \nCLAIRE Caden, what are you doing at night? I have a right to fucking know. \nSAMMY I've been going to Adele's place. And cleaning it. Long pause. Caden rubs his eyes. \nCLAIRE Do you know what I've given up for you? For this. For you. For you. \n(CONTINUED) \nSYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 87. \n135 CONTINUED:135 \nSAMMY CLAIRE I'm sorry.I -- I thought I wanted to be just a working stage actress.

Tammy, playing Hazel, stands there. \nTAMMY Uh-oh. This looks serious.

That's good.That's all we need around here, two Hazels. \nTAMMY (CONT'D) Okay. I'll take that as my cue. Tammy closes the door and leaves. \nCLAIRE Maybe you can clean her toilet. \nSAMMY Maybe I will. \nCLAIRE It's over, Caden. \nSAMMY Claire, no. \nCLAIRE I'm not talking to you. Claire turns to Caden. \n(CONTINUED) \nSYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 88. \n135 CONTINUED: (2)135 \nCADEN I didn't say I was going to clean Hazel's toilet. He did. \nCLAIRE But you thought it. There's a silence. Hazel watches Caden closely. \nCADEN I thought it. But I didn't say it. Claire packs up her stuff. \nCLAIRE I got an offer to do Needleman in a Haystack and I'm going to take it. I want you out of the apartment. The real one. You can keep this one. Claire heads down the stairs. \nCADEN Jesus. Claire! Please! \nHAZEL Already put out a call for a Claire replacement. Would you really clean my bathroom? \nCADEN (beat, sadly) Yeah. \nHAZEL God, Caden, it's all so fucked. \n136 INT. WAREHOUSE - BATHROOM - 2026 - DAY136 \nCaden digs in his bag, pulls out a sponge, gets on his hands and knees and scrubs the floor. \n137 INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - 2026 - DAY137 \nCaden, wearing a pair of magnifying glasses that flip up and down, enters a crowded gallery of people wearing similar glasses. The paintings are microscopic. Museum visitors use the special glasses to study the paintings. There's a wall inscribed \"Small Miracles: The Paintings of Adele Lack.\" Biographical info is under. Caden squeezes his way to the wall to look at paintings. He sees one of an African female genital mutilation ceremony; \n(CONTINUED) \nSYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 89. \n137 CONTINUED:137 a woman weeping over the grave of a child; a man raping a woman. He comes to a wall titled: \"Women I Love.\" He sees a self-portrait of Adele, a portrait of Maria, a portrait of Olive, naked and covered in tattoos. Then he comes to a portrait entitled \"Ellen Bascomb.\" He steps back for a second, unable to look. The people behind him are impatient. Finally he flips the glasses and studies the painting. Ellen appears to be a chubby, 40 year old white woman, her mousy brown hair tied back in a kerchief. She is naked and spreading her vulva for the viewer. She has a kind face and what appears to be an appendectomy scar. \n138 INT. CLAIRE'S KITCHEN (NYC APARTMENT) - 2026 - DAY138 \nCaden moves boxes. Claire sits at the kitchen table with an actor. They are rehearsing lines from Needleman in a Haystack. \nCLAIRE (AS REBA) Oh, Needleman, you had such potential.

WAREHOUSE SET) - 2032 - DAY 166 \nCaden and Hazel walk past the set of the hotel she had stayed at with her family. \nCADEN Look familiar? \nHAZEL Oh my God! It's an exact replica of the Tethered Maiden Terrace! Derek and the kids and I had so much fun on that trip! \nCADEN Listen, I built this because I wanted to show you what happened -- \nSAMMY \n(CALLING) After me, Caden, there's no one left to watch you. They look up. Sammy stands on the ledge above them. \nHAZEL SAMMY (running off) There's nothing to talk Oh fuck! Sammy, Just stay about, Hazel! This is not right where you are! I'myour fault! \ncoming up! \nCADEN No fair, Sammy! She wouldn't see you jump. She never saw me! You're not being authentic. \nSAMMY This is where we part ways. This is authentic. This is what the real Caden would do. This is what real love looks like. Sammy leaps. The actors below scatter. Sammy hits hard, breaks through the fake cement, and is dead. Blood everywhere. \n167 EXT. NYC CEMETERY - 2032 - DAY167 \nSammy is buried. An enormous crowd there: all the actors from the play, Caden and Hazel in front. Hazel weeps. Caden looks at the assembled group, from face to face. \n(CONTINUED) \nSYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 109. \n167 CONTINUED:167 \nCADEN I know how to do it now. There are nearly thirteen million people in the world. Try to imagine that many people! None of those people is an extra. They're all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due. \n168 INT. WAREHOUSE - CEMETERY SET - 2035 - DAY168 \nThe actor playing Sammy is in the coffin. There's an enormous crowd. Tammy plays Hazel and weeps. A stand-in for Sammy as Caden stands next to her. Caden and Hazel watch from the director's table. \nCADEN Do you see what I'm saying? Hazel has her head in her hands. She looks over at Caden, imploringly. \nHAZEL Come over tonight? Please? \n169 OMITTED 169 \n170 INT. BURNING HOUSE - BEDROOM - 2035 - NIGHT 170 \nThe smoke is thick and there are flames. Hazel, in a robe, walks around lighting candles. Caden unpacks his pumps and monitors and places them next to the bed. \nCADEN We could get a place together. We could get a loft. \nHAZEL God, Caden, that sounds nice. I miss my daughter. Maybe she could come live with us. \nCADEN Yeah. I miss Olive. And the other one.

Caden walks over to her and touches her shoulder. \nHAZEL (CONT'D) Oh, Caden. I wish we had this when we were young. And all the years in between. So many years, so fast. \n(CRYING) What did we do? Caden kisses Hazel's forehead. She coughs and smiles up at him, then cranes her neck and kisses him on the lips. \nCADEN My heart aches so much for you. \nHAZEL We're here, Caden.

When it's over, they lie there quietly, with the occasional cough from both of them. Caden cries quietly. \nCADEN (CONT'D) I'm sorry. \nHAZEL It's okay. It's different crying this time. I can tell. I'm crying, too. And I cried last time. After you left. I never told you. But I cried, too. Caden kisses her again. \nCADEN I have a title. The Obscure Moon Lighting an Obscure World. \nHAZEL I think it might be too much. \n171INT. BURNING HOUSE - KITCHEN - 2035 - MORNING171 \nCaden agitatedly paces through the dense smoke. He passes a scrapbook on the table. It's open to a page with ripped-up napkin pieces glued to it. He's crying hard. There's mumbling, quiet conversation coming from somewhere. He walks into -- \n172INT. BURNING HOUSE - BEDROOM - 2035 - CONTINUOUS 172 \nHazel lies in bed. A medic hovers over her, swabs in her mouth and pulls out cotton black with soot. \nMEDIC Might be smoke inhalation. Caden just nods his head for a long time. \n173INT.

Suddenly the passenger door opens and Maria gets in the car. He glances over at her, then looks back out the windshield. \nMARIA Olive wants to see you. God knows why; the way you abandoned her. \nCADEN MARIA Oh, shut up.She's had a fucked-up life with issues, thanks to you. \nCADEN MARIA You're insane.She's dying, asshole.

Weakly, Olive points to a headset on her night table. She pantomimes putting it on. Caden puts it on. Olive puts on her own. There follows a slightly delayed and staticky translation, in an accented male voice, of everything Olive says, with a delay between what Caden says and Olive's response, as she listens in translation. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) I'm dying, as I'm sure Maria told you. The flower tattoos have become infected and they're dying. So I am, as well. This is life. Olive pulls down her hospital gown a bit to show Caden the now sickly and decayed flower tattoos. \nCADEN It's Maria. She did this. \nOLIVE Maria gave me reason to live once you left. The flowers defined me. \nCADEN Your mother and Maria took you away. I tried for years to find you. I didn't leave you. \nOLIVE You did something. Caden is affected by this. It resonates. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) I want to talk to you about your homosexuality. \nCADEN What?

On the beach, Ali and Sam eat some McDonald's. 
ALI Are you happy here? Sam nods. 
SAM Mm. 
ALI What do you like the most at Auntie's? 
SAM The dogs. 
ALI Is that all? Nothing else besides the dogs? 
SAM The truck. 
ALI The dogs and the truck. The house? Auntie? The ocean? 
SAM The dogs and the truck. Ali nods. Sam watches his Dad's fat fingers assemble the plastic toy from his Happy Meal. 
ALI We have it good here... Ali's fingers stop. Sam looks up to find his father watching some girls in swimsuits go by. They go for a swim, horsing around and making noise. 
19. INT. OFFICE - THE ALTA SECU COMPANY. DAY 
The logo is in the shape of a sheriff's badge and hangs over some filing cabinets on the wall of a modest office: "ALTA Securite". 
OWNER No criminal record? You never fucked up? 
ALI No. The boss is in his fifties. He sits behind some files. His hair is short and white, it looks like he's wearing a helmet. He is squeezed into a cheap suit and wearing a tie. He stares at Ali. 
OWNER Is that the truth? We'll be checking anyway... Ali nods. The owner reaches out. 
OWNER Your papers... Ali hands him his tattered paper ID. The owner writes down the number. Ali is 13-14 on the picture. 
OWNER What was your last job? 
ALI I worked in a slaughterhouse. Not for long. It closed. 
OWNER Ever work in security? 
ALI Yeah. I was a night watchman in a stadium for 6 months. Working for the city. In a parking lot too. I did replacements. 
OWNER Ever do any combat sports? 
ALI Karate, for 6 years. I even won Junior Division. And two years of boxing. Thai. 
OWNER You gave it up? 
ALI It was my trainer who gave up. 
OWNER Why? 
ALI He died. A beat. 
OWNER And how are you physically? You stay in shape? 
ALI Yeah. 
OWNER You don't smoke? 
ALI No.

SHOT. 
196 INT. ESPERANZA'S PLANE -NIGHT 196 
TILT UP from the PILOT'S BODY on the floor, already flecked with 
SNOW. Esperanza is at the controls, trying to SEE through the SWIRLING WHIRLWIND. Cursing, he flies with one hand; with the other he REACHES UP and FEELS ABOVE the RADIO PANEL for something he expects to be there: And it IS - one of the DISTINCTIVE 
SCRAMBLED TRANSCEIVERS. 
ESPERANZA 
(INTO IT) Eagle Nest, this is Falcon... Mayday. Eagle Nest, this is Falcon... Mayday!

ESPERANZA'S VOICE Repeat, I have lost cabin pressure. (X) Near zero visibility. I must drop out of the storm. I can land but I must land now, on the first outgoing runway. Repea , I cannot circle around to runway fifteen. PULLBACK. McClane listens, grinning. He takes the airport map from his pocket, hands it the Marvin. 
MCCLANE Marvin... you show me a shortcut to runway fifteen and you got yourself a liner for that coat.

INT. ESPERANZA'S PLANE - INTERCUT 201 
as he DESCENDS from the eye of the storm the SNOW in the cockpit ABATES a bit. Now we can SEE the airfield - and the ILLUMINATED RUNWAY which is PERPENDICULAR to the plane. 
ESPERANZA Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest. But if you could show it to me as well I would be grateful. In the church, Stuart grins at Esperanza's coo]., signals Thompson. A switch is THROWN. The FIRST RUNWAY goes OFF and a NEW RUNWAY lights up DIRECTLY IN FRONT of the plane. 
ESPERANZA Gracias', Amigos. 
202 INT. RUNWAY TUNNEL 202

MCCLANE'S VOICE Eleven W4, W5 - Bingo.

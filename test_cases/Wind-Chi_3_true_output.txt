33   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                 33 
The interior is dark. 
The girl has been thrown under the dash. It's hard to tell in this light whether she's still breathing. 
Finally she stirs, disoriented. 
She climbs back into her seat, piecing together where she is. It takes her a beat to remember him. She looks over slowly. 
He's not moving, though thanks to his seatbelt he's still upright behind the wheel. His head rests limply against the driver's window, which now looks out on nothing but snowbank. 
A link of blood trickles down the glass. 
Dead? 
She's not taking any chances. Without a sound she slips into her shoes, coat. Gropes for her cellphone among the detritus at her feet. 
Suddenly he stirs, groaning. 
She freezes. 
The seconds ticking by on the DASHBOARD CLOCK. 
When he doesn't wake, she resumes fumbling for her cell. 
Finds it.   Then eases open the creaky passenger door. 
And launches herself into the frigid night. 
34   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                      34 
She hurries down the road away from the car. Breath clouding in the frigid air. Punches in numbers on her cell phone.

No SIGNAL BARS. 
She's starting to freak now.   She hits the REDIAL button. 
GIRL ... please... please... please... 
Suddenly, from behind -- 
GUY (O.S.) What are you doing? 
She screams, spins around. 
He's standing right behind her, his face in silhouette. 
GIRL C-Calling 9-1-1. Or trying to. 
GUY Any luck? 
GIRL (shakes head `no') Can't... I can't get a signal here. 
He receives this news with a strange calm. 
GIRL (cont'd) What about yours? 
GUY I don't have a cell. 
GIRL How can you not have a cell? 
GUY (ignoring her) How're you doing? You all right? 
GIRL I... yeah, I'm okay. Nothing broken... What about you? 
GUY I don't know. Think I hit my head. 
He puts his hand to the left side of his skull and pushes on it. Like someone testing a melon for ripeness. 
Come to think of it, his speech is a little wooden.

She watches as he turns and takes a few aimless steps away. 
GUY (cont'd) What happened to the, uh, the guy? 
GIRL Who?

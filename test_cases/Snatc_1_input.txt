Are' you taking the piss again? 
TURKISH 
That's what he said, she's a nice old girl his mum. 
BRICK TOP 
You're on thin ice Turkish, and I am going to be there when it breaks. He puts the phone down and inhales. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Anything for an easy life. That fuckin pikey being difficult. Hello, we here? 
71   EXT. PAWN BROKERS 
We see Errol outside with a glass cutter. He puts it around the door and creates a circle with the sharp side, pulls it out and puts his hand through to kill the alarm. He's in. 
- ERROL 
You coming John? 
JOHN 
Is a trout's head water proof Errol? I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
(CONTINUED) 
71   CONTINUED: 
ERROL 
Get the governor John. John goes back to the car which is parked down the street. The window slides down. 
JOHN 
It looks like we are in gov. 
BRICK TOP 
Oh goodie gum drops. Get us a cup of tea would you Errol? 
72   INT. BACK ROOM PORN BROKERS 
Vin, Lincoln and Sol are arguing 
SOL 
Hold him by his legs. 
BA D BOY LINCOLN 
What do you think I am holding him by, his fucking ears? The interconnecting door opens slowly. 
BRICK TOP 
Hope it ' s not a bad moment. Sol looks at Vin, Vin looks at Lincoln: they are understandably surprised. Brick Top looks around the room the silence continues. Brick Top helps himself to the most comfortable seat. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Do you know who I am? 
BAD BOY LINCOLN 
Yeah I know. 
BRICK TOP 
Good.   That will save me some time then. 
VINNY 
Well I don't. 
BRICK TOP 
What you gonna do with your man there? You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. Apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and pile it all together. 
(CONTINUED) 
72   CONTINUED: 
SOL 
Would someone mind telling me who you are? 
BRICK TOP 
After you got six pieces you gotta get rid of 'em, of course you can't just leave it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, can ya? Pause while the black guys are still holding the body. The door opens and in walks Errol. He passes Brick Top a cup of tea in a take away container. 
VINNY 
Lincoln, who is this man? 
BRICK TOP 
And then I hear the best thing to do is feed 'em to pigs. You gotta starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk. You gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out, you could do that after of course, but you don't want to go sieving pig shit do you? Ever seen the size of one of their molars?                                        Â· 
He holds up his fist 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
They go through bone like i t ' s butter. You gotta have a few pigs though you need about sixteen they will go through a body that weighs two hundred pounds in about eight minutes that means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute,. . . Pause 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Hence the expression greedy as a pig. Pause 
VINNY 
Well thank you, that's a large weight off my mind. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
72   CONTINUED: (2) 
VINNY (CONT'D) 
But would you mind very much telling me who the' fuck you are? Other than a man that feeds people to pigs of course. The door opens and we see John, who is wearing a pair of extremely large plastic gloves, showing Brick Top the shotgu that he has found. 
JOHN

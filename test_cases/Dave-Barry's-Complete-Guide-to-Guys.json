About guys, or men or what have you -- we just didn't talk about such things then. In fact, I didn't see him naked until quite well into our marriage. When was it Albert? \nALBERT A year ago. By accident. \nLENORE Anyway. I thought I was marrying a man, but didn't know that in his heart, he was a guy. \nDAVE (O.S.) When did you first suspect? \nLENORE Not long after the wedding. But it didn't bother me. I just didn't know how to recognize the signs. But we've learned to live with it. Haven't we, Albert? (then after a beat) Albert. \nALBERT It's twelve hundred and thirty-one miles from this spot right here, to Cleveland. \nLENORE What does that have to do with anything? He holds up the device - handheld GPS. \nALBERT Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta. \nLENORE Who cares how far we are from Atlanta? \nALBERT You have a cousin there. \nLENORE Albert. There's a person here asking us questions. There's a film crew here. He looks up at the CAMERA, as if just noticing someone there. Then holding up the GPS -- \nALBERT You.

A SECRETARY'S OFFICE CUBICLE - DAY \nA young, pretty, single SECRETARY. \nSECRETARY Let me put it this way. Everyone I ever dated was a male. I mean they were all men. But only some of them were guys. You know? \nDAVE (O.S.) I see. \nSECRETARY (thinks about it) -- The guys were funnier. But the men were more responsible. You could almost half-believe them when they told you something sometimes. \nDAVE (O.S.)

Roger turns... \nELAINE I'm not asking whether you want to get married. Only whether you believe that we have some kind of a future together. That you, and I - have a future. \nJOHN MADDEN Now this is just what you want in a playoff game. You got snow, you got mud, you got a lead that keeps changing, you got two great teams that just hate each other to the bone and would rather die than give up... Roger looks...then takes the REMOTE and TURNS OFF THE TV - waving Elaine over, who cuddles into him. \nROGER I've been thinking too, Elaine. And for the first time in my life, I'm feeling like I might really be close to a lasting commitment. I haven't said anything up until now because it's always been important to me that I not mislead you. But yes, Elaine. I want to think that we dQ have a future. And with a little more time, I think I could be sure. \nELAINE Oh, Roger... He smiles. Strokes her hair and pulls her in even closer.

And they start punching again. The Dad looks up - so weary... \nDAVE \n(AT COUNTER) Here we can see where even at an early age, guy behavior is already well developed along complex patterns that social scientists have called, \"jerks.\" While girls at the same age are referred to by the same social scientists, as \"human beings.\" \nANGLE ON A TABLE FULL OF GIRLS - INCLUDING ELAINE AT AGE 8 They are all chatting nicely, passing out napkins and ketchup packets making sure everyone has what they need.

Likewise, all men have a gene in them that we scientists believe is directly related to violence. \nDAVE And what can be done about that. \nSCIENTIFIC EXPERT well, some of my esteemed colleagues are quite keen on the idea of tampering with the DNA itself - an idea with which I heartily disagree. The bastards... \nDAVE Then what would you recommend. \nSCIENTIFIC EXPERT Me? Well they can start by spreading out the funding a little bit. Let a few other scientists wet their beaks. I mean what's the point of rewarding the same tired old hacks, year after \nYEAR -- \nDAVE I meant about Guy Violence. \nSCIENTIFIC EXPERT \nOH -- (then shifting back) Well nothing, really. I mean, what can you do. Short of lobotomizing them, anyway. No I suppose we'll just have to continue to channel their aggression into socially acceptable outlets. Like professional wrestling, or the space program. \nDAVE I see.

{"train": "DAVE BARRY'S COMPLETE GUIDE TO GUYS \nWritten by \nJeff Arch \nFrom the book by \nDave Barry \nFebruary 2nd, 2004 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MIAMI - OCEAN AVE, SOUTH BEACH - DAY \nBlazing sun. MUSIC everywhere. Everybody's living la vida. \nLEOPOLD (V.0.) And we're good to go. TWO MEN come out of the BEACON HOTEL. Loud Hawaiian shirts, walking a Chihuahua. They pause; take in the scene on Ocean. Adjust their EARPIECES. \nLEOPOLD (V.0.) Proceed to first checkpoint and hold. They thread their way to the corner... across the street.. .onto the Promenade. Under fat shady palm trees, to a CLEARING -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE ROOF OF THE BEACON HOTEL - CONTINUOUS \nAGENT STEARNS has a RIFLE with a kick-ass scope. AGENT LEOPOLD watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike. \nLEOPOLD Okay sit tight. Company's coming. THROUGH BINOCULARS NOW, as TWO DEADLY MEN approach like barracudas. A THIRD GUY, BEHIND THEM, the KINGPIN they're protecting. Then as TREETOPS BLOCK THE VIEW -- \nLEOPOLD Shit. Hang on. Leopold scans, looking for them. Searching, until he FINDS -- \nLEOPOLD \nWHOA -- The Hawaiian Shirt Guys hear that. The SEE the Barracudas, getting nearer; steal a look at the roof... \nCUT TO: \nPOV FROM ROOFTOP - THROUGH BINOCULARS - A FANTASTIC BLONDE rinses off at an outdoor shower. Beads of spray skip off her like diamonds in the sunlight. \nSTEARNS Oh, mama. She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve. \nLEOPOLD She sure is taking her time... \nSTEARNS She must be really salty... \nLEOPOLD (shakes his head) It's not just the salt. She's got sunscreen on. Then the sand gets on that, and it sticks... (then still watching) Hell, one time I was in Hawaii? And these three models -- \nSTEARNS Wait a minute. (looks at him) Hawaii. \nLEOPOLD -- Shit! He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the Chihuahua. Then, walking into the spot -- \nDAVE Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something like this ever happened to you? (bends down to pet \nTHE CHIHUAHUA) Because if you're a guy - or if you know someone who is - then what you've just seen should look pretty familiar. He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it. \nDAVE Scientists call this condition \"Lust Induced Brain Freeze.\" It affects millions of guys, every day, in all walks of life -- causing anything from a mild embarrassment, to an international incident. He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS pointing GUNS at him. \nLEOPOLD Hand over the dog. \nDAVE Hey. I didn't even know it was a dog. They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA. \nGUY HUSBAND If he could hit left-handed pitching, I would. \n(THEN) Lenny. Pick up -- the Yankees got Lupenza! The IMAGE FREEZES. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A FRONT PORCH - DAY \nTwo OLD PEOPLE on a glider. LENORE talks directly to CAMERA. ALBERT'S absorbed with some device that we can't see. \nLENORE Well when I met him, I didn't know so much. About guys, or men or what have you -- we just didn't talk about such things then. In fact, I didn't see him naked until quite well into our marriage. When was it Albert? \nALBERT A year ago. By accident. \nLENORE Anyway. I thought I was marrying a man, but didn't know that in his heart, he was a guy. \nDAVE (O.S.) When did you first suspect? \nLENORE Not long after the wedding. But it didn't bother me. I just didn't know how to recognize the signs. But we've learned to live with it. Haven't we, Albert? (then after a beat) Albert. \nALBERT It's twelve hundred and thirty-one miles from this spot right here, to Cleveland. \nLENORE What does that have to do with anything? He holds up the device - handheld GPS. \nALBERT Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta. \nLENORE Who cares how far we are from Atlanta? \nALBERT You have a cousin there. \nLENORE Albert. There's a person here asking us questions. There's a film crew here. He looks up at the CAMERA, as if just noticing someone there. Then holding up the GPS -- \nALBERT You. Where do you live. \nDAVE (O.S.) Here in Miami. \nALBERT What part. Lenore buries her head. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY \nDave walks down a crowded street. Colorful day life. \nDAVE Like a lot of big cities, Miami is known for its sizeable population of guys. So we came here to take the city's pulse on the subject. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A SECRETARY'S OFFICE CUBICLE - DAY \nA young, pretty, single SECRETARY. \nSECRETARY Let me put it this way. Everyone I ever dated was a male. I mean they were all men. But only some of them were guys. You know? \nDAVE (O.S.) I see. \nSECRETARY (thinks about it) -- The guys were funnier. But the men were more responsible. You could almost half-believe them when they told you something sometimes. \nDAVE (O.S.) So, if you were to meet someone that was funny and responsible... \nSECRETARY That would be a woman. \nDAVE \n(TO CAMERA) If that was you...you're a guy. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nSHERYL CROW talks to the CAMERA before going onstage. The muffled SOUNDS of the warmup band O.S. \nSHERYL CROW Well there were always guys at my shows - right from the beginning. I mean you start out playing beer halls, right? So when you have beer, you have guys. And it sorta just grew from there. But I was okay with it. They didn't cause much trouble. \nDAVE (O.S.) And what about men. \nSHERYL CROW Men cause trouble. \n(THEN) But that's okay too. I get half my songs from that. \nDAVE (O.S.) So it all works out. \nSHERYL CROW Long as they buy the records... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIAMI PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY \nDave walks along the stacks in the ANTHROPOLOGY SECTION. \nDAVE So where did this all start? Many experts now think they know where men came from, but what about Guys? where did they come from? He stops, peels off a THICK BOOK full of science things. \nDAVE To answer this question accurately, we might have to look something up. So instead we'll travel back to prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa, and get there just in time for the Dawn of Guys. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"THE DAWN OF GUYS\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PREHISTORIC AFRICA - MOONLIGHT \nThe endless expanse. A cluster of caves. SOUND EFX of all kinds of nasty shit out there. Skittering over rocks. Slithering through the grasses. Bigger predators, circling... A ROOSTER cocks his head back and CROWS out. \nCUT TO: \nTNT. ONE OF THE CAVES PRIMATE ROGER opens one eye...SEES PRIMATE ELAINE, PRIMATE KIDS and PRIMATE IN-LAWS. Hairy grunting things, all sleeping in a protective clump... \nHe rolls over, back to sleep. But the ROOSTER CROWS again... \nCUT TO: \nTHE ROOSTER, COOKING ON AN OPEN FIRE \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CAVES - MORNING \nPRIMATE ROGER comes out. A sleepy nod at PRIMATE GENE and OTHER PRIMATES, as they take up LARGE JAGGED ROCK SLABS leaning against their caves and start off. In a few million years they'll be leaving suburban driveways this way. \nEXT. TRAIL FROM CAVE AREA - CAVES IN B.G. - MORNING \nPRIMATE ROGER and PRIMATE GENE have joined PRIMATE LENNY and PRIMATE PHIL. All carrying their slabs of jagged rocks. \nThe PRIMATE WOMEN are still, pounding roots and tending fires and dealing with climbing PRIMATE KIDS. They HEAR SHOUTS O.S.; gather and go to the ridge where they SEE \nPOV FROM RIDGE -- The PRIMATE GUYS are coming back, without their jagged slabs and without any animals. But they are having great fun: \nrunning in primitive patterns, and throwing one of the ROCKS back and forth and chasing whoever has it. It looks like the beginnings of rugby, or Australian Rules Football, in terms of all they need now is beer. The PRIMATE WOMEN watch. And trade looks. Once more, something seems to pass between them... \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRIMATE CAVE - NIGHT \nPrimate Roger and Primate Elaine try to keep it down for the Primate Kids' sake. \nPRIMATE ELAINE (grunting, subtitled) Please don't tell me you got rid of your jagged rock slab. \nPRIMATE ROGER But these are great! \nPRIMATE ELAINE But you didn't kill anything. \nPRIMATE ROGER Nobody's going with jagged slabs anymore. \nPRIMATE ELAINE But the kids are hungry. \nPRIMATE ROGER What about your pounded roots? \nPRIMATE ELAINE Pounded roots are a side dish. They need balance in their diets. (then off his look) And another thing - suppose you do start bringing animals home using this -- who's going to skin and clean them? He looks at her-the SOUND of TOMORROW'S ROOSTER CROWING as \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CAVE - MORNING \nPrimate Roger comes out of the cave, with his rock. He gives it such a look. \nThen looking up at the sky he hurls it, up as high as he can... \nAND THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THE ROCK, UP, UP, IN SLOW MOTION, \nPEAKING, THEN STARTING ITS DESCENT BACK TO EARTH -- ONLY NOW \nIT'S NOT A ROCK BUT A WINDOWS -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \n-- which ROGER is holding, across from ELAINE on the couch. \nELAINE Five hundred dollars? \nROGER It can hold a thousand addresses. \nELAINE So can my address book. \nROGER Can your address book pick up your em-ail? \nELAINE No but my computer can. \nROGER Well this can do both. \nELAINE For five hundred dollars it should give me a manicure, Roger! It should drive me home from work at night! HOW could you spend that kind of money without discussing it first? On Roger's look...the PICTURE FREEZES. Dave walks in. \nDAVE There's a whole list of things a guy is supposed to discuss first. Unfortunately, he never knows what they are until he's already not discussed them. \nNEW FATHER GENE (looks, sees the toy \nSTORE BOX) Oh I got that for Benjy. \nNEW MOTHER KELLY You were supposed to get a rattle. \nNEW FATHER GENE All the rattles were recalled. \nNEW MOTHER KELLY So you bought a tank. \nNEW FATHER GENE Wait'll you see what this can do, baby. Benjy's gonna love it. \nNEW MOTHER KELLY Oh yeah? Can he shake it? Will it rattle? \nNEW FATHER GENE Rattle? This thing'll bring down a bookshelf! She looks at him. He'll be returning the thing within seconds. CAMERA PANS to Dave, who shrugs. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DETROIT - ED'S AUTO SHOP - DAY \nA rundown place with junked cars out front. ED's an intense little guy in a Tigers' hat and a couple major tattoos. \nED Well I'm into fireworks. I like to take 'em apart, you know. And study 'em. See what makes 'em tick. \nHe shows Dave a box with ASSORTED FIREWORKS inside. \nED I just got these from Ohio. I don't think they're as good as the ones I got from Tennessee. Not as loud, you know? \nDAVE Well no, if loud is your -- \nED If you want to hear loud - listen to this. He goes over to a different box, takes out what looks like a stick of dynamite. Gets ready to light it; turns to CAMERA. \nED You may want to step back a couple hundred yards. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAVE'S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY \nAs Ed's Auto Shop recedes in the background - with a LOUD EXPLOSION accompanying - \nDAVE So when we see guys like Ed, and his fireworks - or guys shooting marine flares into innocent pumpkins, or building catapults that'll throw a Buick - we should not condemn them. We should not assume these are just pointless juvenile activities. Instead we should be convinced they are, and move on to Guys in the Workplace. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - PHILADELPHIA - DAY \nA PHILADELPHIA GIRL stands outside a CHEESESTEAK PLACE. \nPHILADELPHIA GIRL Guys at work? Or guys doing work. \n(MORE) \nPHILADELPHIA GIRL (CONT'D) I mean unless you want to talk about faxing or emailing their stupid jokes back and forth. Sick jokes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WALL STREET - DAY \nDave and a SEASONED BROKER eat HOT DOGS from a CORNER CART. \nBROKER Ten, fifteen years ago? A guy would call you up with some joke he just heard. So you wanna pass it on, it's by phone. One person at a time. Then a while later, some guy calls you up with the same exact joke. Then when group faxing came in, it really sped things up. Next thing you know there's like ten faxes on your machine, from places you never even heard of. Places around the world, I'm saying. \nELAINE I'm just saying. I don't see the four of you fighting over who can write the better sonnet. \nROGER So? \nELAINE So no one gets hurt writing sonnets. \nROGER (off her look; then) It's a sprain. \nBACK TO: \nINT. THE NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DAY \nRoger listens more agitated as the argument mounts. \nGENE When did you last run the forty? \nPATRICK Hey. I could beat you in the forty running backwards. \nTOM You couldn't even beat your butt running backwards. \nROGER (from his desk) Will you guys cut it out? They stop. Look at him. \nROGER The kid in the story's in high school. You're not. You're supposed to be adults and you're bragging about who can beat who in a stupid footrace. \nTOM No one's bragging. \nPATRICK Gene's just saying he can run the forty in under six seconds. \nROGER Hey. I can do it in under six seconds. FREEZE THE PICTURE, on their expressions. BRING UP \"CHARIOTS \nOF FIRE\" MUSIC \nDISSOLVE T0: \nEXT. CITY PARK - DAY \nThe FOUR GUYS crouch in their starting stance. A SECRETARY stands at the end of a marked-off course with a stopwatch and a whistle. She blows the whistle. They're off. \nSLOW MOTION WITH MUSIC All four guys explode off the line. Patrick gets five strides and goes down. Tom gets two more and falls, howling in pain. Then Gene and Roger, neck and neck for at least three more strides until Roger HEARS A \"POP,\" that ECHOES over the music, and goes toppling down. As Gene finishes alone - gripping his side in awful pain but pumping his fist in victory. \nMUSIC FADES AS \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nElaine comes in; Roger, limping and leaning heavily on her. \nELAINE I don't know why I listened to you. You need to see a doctor. \nROGER It's a sprain, Elaine. \nELAINE Roger you can't walk. \nROGER It'll work itself out. She gives him a look. Parks him long enough to close the door behind him. Without her support, he drops to the floor. She turns to the CAMERA. \nELAINE Why won't they go to the doctor? \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nMIA Once. I nearly lost my life. \nSIDRA They act like it's so sacred. I've seen pairs of briefs with holes in them larger than the leg holes. (as the others nod) I tried to throw a pair out once? And sneak it past him? He went out into the garbage and found them. He said he couldn't trust me after that. \nKARLA E Tell me what that's all about. \nSIDRA I don't even want to think about it. \nDAVE (off their reactions) So you agree then, that guys at least have feelings. \nMIA They just waste them. That's all. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nROGER and ELAINE get out of Roger's car. Elaine has an armload of magazines. \nELAINE Now remember. Gene's dad is real sick. Kelly says he doesn't talk about it. So see if you can draw him out. \nROGER He already did talk about it. \nELAINE Oh? What did he say? \nROGER He said his dad is real sick. She gives him a look. Gets to the door. \nROGER What are those? \nELAINE Kelly's boss is turning forty. \nROGER So you're giving her magazines? \nELAINE (a look; then) Just see if you can get him to talk. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DEN - NIGHT \nThere's a GAME on. Gene sort of stares. Roger has a SHOEBOX on his lap; goes through Gene's SEGA cartridges. \nROGER Galaxians. Far out... \nGENE (while Roger keeps \nLOOKING) Can you believe the Yankees got Lupenza. \nROGER They get everybody. \nGENE I know. They suck. \nROGER I know. Silence. Roger pulls out two cartridges, compares them. \nGENE I got to Level 24 of Arkanoids. \nROGER \n(TURNS) -- You're kidding. Gene shakes his head. He's not. This is big. \nROGER You've seen the Evil Presence? (then off his look) What's it look like? Gene shrugs; even the best of friends. Roger understands. CAMERA PANS to Dave. \nDAVE Believe it or not, ladies - that was sharing. (then nods to kitchen) And believe it or not, guys - so is \n(THEN) She could think we were being cheap. \nELAINE And how would she feel about that... \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE DEN - SAME \nRoger and Gene watch a PORSCHE COMMERCIAL without the sound. \nGENE That one has the GPS. With the screen that has maps of everything? \nROGER What about with the convertible. \nGENE It's optional on the convertible. Unless you get the turbo, then it's standard. \nROGER Phil Wonkerman got the turbo. \nGENE No shit...Phil got a Porsche? \nROGER Said it was his birthday present to himself. \nGENE \n(IMPRESSED; THEN) When was his birthday. \nROGER Beats me. Probably around the same time when he got the car. \nGENE No shit... \n(THEN) Maybe we should get him something. \nROGER (looks at him) He just got a Porsche. \nGENE Right. They look at the TV again. Then, from the kitchen doorway: \nELAINE Roger? They turn. Elaine gives Roger a look. PICTURE FREEZES AS: \nDAVE Roger met Elaine at a company event. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A HOTEL POOL - DAY \nPEOPLE with NAMETAGS mingle with drinks and appetizers. Dave comes away from the hot buffet table with a great haul. \nDAVE -- They discovered they had something in common right away. He points to ROGER and ELAINE, over by a tiki-torch. \nELAINE You're kidding! That was you? At the Burger King? \nROGER I was in fourth grade. \nELAINE I was too! But my God, you remembered that? \nDAVE (off Roger's nod) She loved that he remembered that. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT \nA GLOW-BOWL night; neon and black light and MUSIC. \nROGER'S INNER VOICE And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's eighty-seven degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a goddam garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent lowlife bastards six hundred dollars. \nCAMERA PANS TO ELAINE. \nELAINE'S INNER VOICE -- He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry too. God, I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure. \nELAINE'S OVAL IMAGE \n(TO ELAINE) You know what your problem is? You're too idealistic. You're waiting for some knight to come riding up on his white horse, when you're sitting next to a perfectly good person, a person you enjoy being with, a person you truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about you. A person who is in pain because of this self-centered, schoolgirl fantasy that you insist on clinging to. CAMERA PANS TO ROGER. His OVAL IMAGE APPEARS; at the LOCAL BAR with a beer in front of him and pool tables in b.g. \nROGER'S INNER VOICE They'll probably say it's only a ninety day warranty. That's exactly what they're gonna say, the scumballs. \nROGER'S OVAL IMAGE Let 'em say what they want. You don't have to listen. \nELAINE Roger? \nROGER'S INNER VOICE You know you're right. They want a warranty? I'll give them a goddam warranty. I'll take their lousy warranty and stick it right up their -- \nELAINE Roger. \nROGER \n(STARTLED) -- What? \nELAINE Please don't torture yourself like this. Maybe I should never have... \n(BREAKING DOWN) Oh God, I feel so... \nROGER (looks over, alarmed) \nWHAT -- She struggles to keep control. Her OVAL IMAGE disapproves. \nELAINE I'm such a fool. I mean I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse. \nROGER There's no horse? He looks up; his OVAL IMAGE SHRUGS; gets up off the stool. \nELAINE You think I'm a fool, don't you? \nROGER (reacting to the Oval \nROGER) -- no! He looks over at her; not sure who he responded to...but it appears he said the right thing anyway. \nELAINE It's just.. .well I need ...time, I think. I think I need some time. Roger looks up at his OVAL IMAGE: gone. He looks at Elaine. \nROGER -- Time. Yes. \nELAINE (moved, touches his \nHAND) Oh Roger, do you really feel that way? \nROGER What way? \nELAINE About time. Do you feel that way about time? Roger looks confused. His OVAL IMAGE is off playing pool now. He turns to Elaine; does his best to look decisive. \nROGER Oh. Well. Yes. Yes I do, feel that way. About time. \nELAINE \n(MELTS) Thank you, Roger. \nROGER -- Thank you. They smile. Look forward. He looks a little nervous. She looks serene... \nRoger and Gene get ready for some 1 on 1. Roger passes to Gene... \nROGER Check. .who passes it right back. \nGENE Check. \nRoger takes the ball, dribbles, almost starts but doesn't. Gene looks at him. \nROGER Listen. \nGENE What. \nROGER (a beat; then) -- Elaine and I. \nGENE Elaine and you what. \nROGER (a beat; then he shrugs) We sort of have this -- thing. He looks at Gene. Conveys the full impact of this. Then -- \nROGER Did she ever mention owning a horse? \nGENE Who. \nROGER Elaine. She ever talk about horses? Like, to Kelly or something? \nGENE Not that I know of. Why? Roger thinks.. .then shakes it off. Throws the ball to Gene. \nROGER What's the score. \nGENE We haven't started yet. They start to play. CAMERA FINDS DAVE, on a nearby bench. \nDAVE Roger's in love. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY \nSHERYL CROW takes a break in the MIXING BOOTH. \nSHERYL CROW I can sympathize with your friend, man. I've seen a lot of guys go there. \nDAVE Do you have any advice for a guy in love? \nSHERYL CROW I don't know - most of my songs are about guys out of love. \nDAVE I see. \nSHERYL CROW Cause you know, a guy in love - a guy who's where your friend's at, anyway - they don't know where they are. They're like an ant, standing on a truck tire. They don't know how they got there - all they know is that's not where they were a minute ago. But then they sort of get vaguely okay with it, you know? They start hangin' out there, they're feelin' pretty good. \n(THEN) Until the thing starts moving. \nDAVE What happens then. \nSHERYL CROW Well then they get crushed. Dave gulps. She shrugs. \nSHERYL CROW Rock and roll, my friend. Life in the city. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TWO OLD PEOPLE ON A COUCH - DAY \nOLD MAN November 8, 1960. The day John Kennedy beat Nixon and won the White House. That was the day I met her. His WIFE turns, looks at him funny. \nMIKE THE MOOSE Three months ago, the Marlins traded a guy named Rufino Lupenza to the Yankees, for some minor league players and cash. I grant you it was a rotten trade. I grant you the Yankees seem to have this, this knack for making brilliant deals year after year. But three months? (pops in a tape) The Marlins are over it. The Yankees are over it. The players and their families are over it -- but just check this out. \nCALLER \n(ON TAPE) The guy was a workhorse! He filled in wherever he was needed and he never got hurt! And when he got hurt, he played hurt. \nMIKE THE MOOSE \n(ON TAPE) You know I got a post card from him here at the station. He says they're all doing fine: Lucita's got the kids in their new school already and they all seem happy. She even found an Ecuadorean grocery she likes. \nCALLER Grocery -- the guy batted 340, from both sides. \n(MORE) \nCALLER (CONT'D) His on-base percentage was in the 4's, with a rocket arm on defense and an awareness of the field like nobody's business. And they trade him for minor leaguers? For untested, greenhorn punks who can barely even -- \nMIKE THE MOOSE (pauses the tape) That guy's pretty normal. He cues forward, plays. A GUY CALLER, fighting tears. \nMIKE THE MOOSE \n(ON RADIO) You just have to move on, Stan. \nCALLER .I try to - I'm trying. But I just can't make sense of this... Mike the Moose stops the tape. \nMIKE THE MOOSE These are guys you wouldn't see crying even at a funeral. Guys who can't bring themselves to hug their own children. And they're beside themselves. (shakes his head) And all over a meaningless trade... \nDAVE Meaningless? Mike the Moose looks at him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nRoger and Gene are watching the KNICKS/HEAT game. Big bag of Doritos between them. \nTV ANNOUNCER .seventy-seven per cent from the line during the regular season, and a red-hot eighty-three per cent during the playoffs. \nROGER Stop saying that! \nTV ANNOUNCER SIDEKICK -- and in the fourth quarter of the playoffs, that number is even higher -- \nGENE Stop saying that! \nTV ANNOUNCER So they really picked the wrong guy to foul, at this crucial point in such a crucial game. \nROGER AND GENE Stop saying that! \nTV ANNOUNCER He dribbles. He sets -- he dribbles again... Roger and Gene lean forward. \nROGER Come on come on come on comeoncomeon -- \nGENE Miss the shot miss the shot miss the shot come on and miss the shot -- \nTV ANNOUNCER -- and the Knicks call time out. They lean back in their seats; breathe some relief. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nElaine and Kelly are addressing INVITATIONS by hand. Dave sits on the counter, listens in. \nELAINE They don't know the players. The players don't know them - yet they idolize these people. They follow them from team to team -- and they know more about these teams than they know about their own families. They might not even know if they have families. \nKELLY I'm with you. They turn, go back to the kitchen. The celebration goes on. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"THE PUBLIC REST ROOM PROBLEM\" \nINT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY \nDave walks down a terminal corridor among hurrying PASSENGERS. \nDAVE If there's one thing women don't know about when it comes to guys, it's the public rest room problem. And we're here to clear that up right now. He stops outside a MEN'S REST ROOM, which is currently closed for maintenance. \nDAVE This room is a private hell for a countless number of guys -- yet the women in their lives are completely in the dark about it. \n(MORE) \nDAVE (CONT'D) But before we go inside, let's talk with a leading social scientist, so that what we're about to show you sounds a little more official. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RED CARPET CLUB - DAY \nDave is at the honor bar with the SAME BRITISH GUY. The words \"Leading Social Scientist\" APPEAR under him this time. \nLEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST One has to understand that the act of emptying one's bladder goes deep to the very roots of masculinity. It is an important territorial statement that males are genetically programmed to carry out. \nDAVE I see. \nLEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST In fact, many of my colleagues believe the reason that dogs howl at the moon is because they can't go up there and urinate on it -- which is not, however, a theory which I embrace. But guess who gets all the grant money every year. The bastards... He stares off into space. A bitter man. \nDAVE Um...you were saying? \nLEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST I didn't want this job. Twenty years, in the social sciences? And what was everybody else doing -- they were getting laid. They were going to bed with women. And what have I been doing -- applying for matching grants. And not getting them. \n(MORE) \nLEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST (CONT'D) Applying for any grants at all - and not getting those either. Meanwhile all the \"cool dudes\" are laughing! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. \"THE COOL DUDES WHO GET THE BIG GRANTS\" TAVERN - DAY \nHonda Accords fill the lot. TWO MORE drive up and a SCIENTIST gets out of each. They hail each other and go in together. As they pull open the door, LAUGHTER spills out from inside. \nLEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST (V.0.) The bastards... \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"THE PUBLIC REST ROOM PROBLEM\" \nEXT. A VIDEO PRODUCTION TRUCK - DAY \nThere is a SATELLITE DISH on top. Dave is with JOHN MADDEN. \nDAVE With me now is the great John Madden -- legendary coach of football's Oakland Raiders and veteran network analyst for CBS Sports and now the Fox Sports Network. John, thanks for coming by today. \nJOHN MADDEN Happy to be here Dave. \nDAVE John, you heard what our leading expert said about this particular anxiety that guys have regarding bathrooms in general and public ones in particular. Any thoughts? \nJOHN MADDEN Well he's exactly right, Dave. I mean the guy was a little loopy but he hit the nail on the head. \nDAVE (V.O.) We did that. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"GUYS AT MIDLIFE\" \nEXT. UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI - DAY \nDave walks the campus. Threads through GORGEOUS COLLEGE GIRLS who don't know he's there. \nDAVE If there's anything that causes more anguish in a guy than sports anguish, and public restroom anguish, and hardware store anguish, it's the day that he realizes that somehow his life is half over now, and no matter what he tries to tell himself, he's not young anymore and he's never going to be young again. (then he stops) And as any guy'll tell you - it sucks. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AN ELEVATOR - DAY \nA GUY IN A SUIT, alone in here. Faint ELEVATOR MUSIC plays. \nELEVATOR GUY I got used to having the Beatles and Stones called 'classic rock.' Then I heard Elvis Costello on an Oldies station. I figured, okay - who cares - at least it's on somewhere. But then I hear \"London Calling,\" on Muzak. By the Clash. On Muzak. \n(SHRUGS) But what the hell. I'm in a suit and I go around all day explaining peoples' 401K plans to them. And Sting's doing commercials for Jaguar. He shakes his head; it's hopeless. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHOPPING MALL BARBER SHOP - DAY \nThe BARBER talks while cutting Dave's hair. \nBARBER The way I see it, it's like menopause, right? Except men get it different. It doesn't show, y'see? The cramps don't come, the hot and cold flashes, and you don't have your magazines and drug stores filled with helpful stuff to do about it. But something comes, and it hits every guy who's living whether he likes it or not. Whether he knows it or not. Guy can lose his bleepin' mind if he doesn't watch out. He gets a mirror to show Dave the back. Gives him time to get philosophical. \nBARBER But you know? Maybe it's for the better. Maybe whoever designed all this, was afraid to let the men in on what was gonna be happening. Like if we knew, we'd bail or something. You know, ahead of time. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A BAR - DAY \nThe BARTENDER wipes the bar down in front of Dave. \nBARTENDER I'm just telling you what I see. Every lousy day. A guy'll come in and sit down, right where you are. He loosens up a little and then it comes. The road not taken. Unexamined choices. An unfulfilled life. And other guys, they'll come in and don't say a word. The ones who just stare at the mirror. \nDAVE That sounds pretty bleak. \nBARTENDER \n(SHRUGS; THEN) I think it goes back to the old times. Ancient times, you know? When nobody was expected to live past forty. You got to forty? You died. \n(MORE) \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) But now that men aren't doing that, there's a lot more shit up ahead, and none of it looks good so they go freak out and make a mess of things -- they'll quit their jobs or walk out on their marriages or make some other idiot grandstand move. None of them are happy and every single one of them wishes he did something else with his life and can't figure out how it got this way. Every single one of them. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY \nA hotshot LAWYER is dictating a memo to his SECRETARY. \nLAWYER .therefore please be advised that in reference to the aforementioned subject matter, as per the original agreement dated 7 March Two Thousand, -- His Secretary stops writing. Waits. \nLAWYER ...7 March Two Thousand... \nSECRETARY Um. You said that already. \nJOHNNY LAKE Yeah right. Driving around in a rusted worthless pickup truck that's about to be repossessed anyway, while a guy like you, my own age, is going around in a Porsche Carrera. \nLAWYER But you get to fly. \nJOHNNY LAKE No, you get to fly. I get to hoof this shit up and down these godforsaken hilltops listening to stockbrokers brag about getting lap dances from college coeds, and charging the whole thing through the company expense account -- while I can't even deduct my blood pressure medication. That's what I get to do. He kicks a rock in the road, which almost feels good enough so he kicks another one -- but this one is buried in the dirt like an iceberg and doesn't budge -- \nJOHNNY LAKE Ahh, SHIT! -- and he falls down hobbling on one knee instead. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON'S OFFICE - DAY \nJohnny Lake waits on the examining table, holding ice against his leg. The Lawyer sits on the extra chair reading EXOTIC \nISLANDS MAGAZINE. \nHe holds up a PHOTO: a Guy in a hammock, in Paradise. \nLAWYER Look at this. \nJOHNNY LAKE You got that right. The Lawyer shakes his head; flips the page. \nJOHNNY LAKE Hey. (then on Lawyer's look; he shrugs) You don't think he's gonna... \nLAWYER What. \nJOHNNY LAKE You know. Have to use the -- \nLAWYER Glove? (then off his look) You hurt your knee. He already took the x-rays. \nJOHNNY LAKE What if something's broken. \nLAWYER Well he's not going in that way. You don't do a rectal to set a guy's leg. Still the guy looks doubtful. The ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON - British, familiar - comes in, with a fresh X-RAY. \nORTHOPEDIC SURGEON Well you've done quite a number on yourself. Want to see? \nJOHNNY LAKE Why should I. I wouldn't know what the hell I'm looking at. You're the one who went to medical school. \nORTHOPEDIC SURGEON Don't remind me. (then on their looks) What. You think I like this? \n(MORE) \nORTHOPEDIC SURGEON (CONT'D) The medical profession? Owing my life to the insurance cartel while the rest of the world thinks I'm so stinking rich? \nLAWYER Well.. .aren't you? \nORTHOPEDIC SURGEON Of courseIam - I'm an orthopedic surgeon!Ijust don't like people assumingit! \n(THENASHIS BEEPER \nGOESOFF) And this -- I am so sick of this bloody thing I can't even tell you! Because every time it goes off it means I have to stop doing one thing I don't want to be doing, and start doing another thing I don't want to be doing. You call that a life? They look at him. Don't know what to say. \nORTHOPEDIC SURGEON -- Let me show you something. (puts down the x-ray, goes to a drawer) I've been working on this during my free time. Not like I get any. He gets an accordion-style envelope; takes out a REAM OF TYPED PAGES. Hands it over to Johnny Lake. \nJOHNNY LAKE What is it? \nORTHOPEDIC SURGEON What is it? It's a screenplay! This'll blow the lid off the orthopedic surgery industry! Look - look here -- (takes it back; flips \nTHROUGH) -- no wait, this part's better. No -- here! Here you go. Read this and tell me if you don't -- \nHe looks up. They're gone. \nDAVE (CONT'D) In fact, when modern women describe the qualities they're looking for in the ideal man, the phrase \"a real fast shooter\" is usually pretty far down the list. \n(THEN STOPPING) Naturally, it fell to guys to do something about this. So, naturally - they did. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A SKI CABIN - NIGHT \nDave stands outside while Kelly and Gene come back from walking their dog. In a hurry. \nDAVE one technique for holding back the inevitable, is when the guy - just when he is about to have his euphemism - will hurl himself violently into an iron bed railing, and raise a lump on his head the size of a golf ball. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE SKI CABIN - CONTINUOUS \nThey come in the room, shedding clothes. He lifts her, carries her to the bed -- with nothing but pillows against the wall. He stops, panicked... \nGENE There's nothing there! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS \nDave watches the LIGHT GO OFF. Turns back to the CAMERA. \nDAVE In cases where there aren't any iron railings, a good backup technique can be found right on the end of the cold wet nose of the trusted family dog. CAMERA PANS to the window where we hear: \nKELLY Yes...yes... \nGENE .yesyesyesyes...yesyesyesyes... \nKELLY .just hold on...yes... \nGENE .yesyesyesyesYEEE00000WWWW!!! CAMERA PANS back to Dave. \nDAVE There are also mental techniques -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRoger and Elaine are under the sheets. Some good early MOANING.. .as Dave comes in, holding a mike, interview style. \nDAVE One of the most time honored and reliable mental delaying styles, is the Baseball Method -- (taps Roger's shoulder) -- how's it going, Champ. Roger pokes his head out of the blanket; stays active from the neck down. \nROGER Oh - yeah hi. \n(ACKNOWLEDGES CAMERA; then to Dave) Well, the baseball thing. I mean a while ago I was into that - big time. You know, fooling around with different lineups, mixing up the batting order - like thinking about what would happen if you took your cleanup guy and made him eighth or something -- just something stupid like that, you know? Stuff you'd never really do. \nDAVE And that did the trick. \nROGER Oh hell yeah. I mean I could go all night - literally all night - just shuffling my pitching staff around, or thinking about who I might try and sign at the winter meetings. Hang on -- He goes under the blanket; pays more attention to Elaine... then comes back. \nROGER The thing is, it got stale. And I found after a while I wasn't enjoying sex or baseball that much. And you don't want to mess with that stuff. \nDAVE \n(CAN'T DISAGREE) So what do you do instead? \nROGER Math problems. \nPRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN (off their laughter) I like the smell. \nPRIMATE LUCY Of the men, or the rotten fish? \nPRIMATE KELLY There's a difference? More laughing; then they turn back to Primate Elaine. \nPRIMATE KELLY But how will we make them go along? Most of them can't even remember which cave to come home to every night. How are they going to remember rules? \nPRIMATE ELAINE We'll give them a Look. \nPRIMATE LUCY A look? \nPRIMATE ELAINE A special look. A 'Certain Look.' \nPRIMATE KELLY But we look at them every day. And they still do whatever they want. \nPRIMATE ELAINE (as the others agree) I've been working on this. Watch. She turns to Primate Blonde Woman, who is holding a gourd. On the Look, the Blonde drops the gourd. \nPRIMATE ELAINE See? And she wasn't even doing anything. Agreements and \"Wows\" go all around. \nPRIMATE ELAINE Now who's with me. \nCUT TO: \nVARIOUS SHOTS, QUICK CUTS OF THE PRIMATE WOMEN TRYING TO GET \nTHE \"LOOK\" RIGHT. EVENTUALLY, EVEN PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN \nGETS IT. . .ALTHOUGH AT ONE POINT SHE SCARES HERSELF AND DROPS \nTHE GOURD AGAIN. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRAIL BACK TO THE CAVES - DUSK \nThe Primate Guys come back lugging ANIMAL PARTS. Each now has his own ROCK, instead of the giant jagged slabs. \nPRIMATE GENE What are you doing later. \nPRIMATE ROGER I don't know. Probably just stare at the fire. \nPRIMATE GENE A bunch of us are going over to Primate Blonde Woman's cave to see what she does with those gourds. Want to come? \nPRIMATE ROGER -- Can't. Primate Elaine's ancestors are still here. \nPRIMATE GENE Bummer. \nPRIMATE ROGER Tell me about it. \n(THEN) They are so Ice Age... \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRIMATE ROGER AND PRIMATE ELAINE'S CAVE - NIGHT \nPrimate Roger watches Primate Elaine examine his NEW ROCK. Her PRIMATE MOM AND DAD hover on the edge of the discussion. \nPRIMATE ELAINE I don't get it. What was wrong with the other one. \nPRIMATE ROGER This one's better. It's an upgrade. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nDave goes up the escalator; walks through the kind of 'Home Stylings' section where no other guy would go. Everything he talks about is on display in some form. \nDAVE -- And there are thousands of standards for domestic life, involving even more totally un-guy concepts -- like curtains, bedspreads, napkins, special hangers, little soaps shaped like fruit, and decorative boxes that hold tissues that already come in a box. While guys, left on their own in the wild, will develop lifestyles that don't involve any of these things. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COLLEGE GUY APARTMENT - DAY \nCOLLEGE ROGER and COLLEGE GENE stand in their doorway. There is one window, a lot of dust and nothing else. \nCOLLEGE GENE I know just what this place needs. \nCOLLEGE ROGER \n(NODS) Hockey sticks. They turn around to go buy hockey sticks. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE SAME APARTMENT - SOME MONTHS LATER \nA RABBIT on a lawn chair drinks beer out of an ashtray. College Roger and College Gene play Indoor Death Hockey; slamming into walls, scattering NEWSPAPERS and PIZZA BOXES - as their IMAGE FREEZES. \nDAVE of course, even by the most basic standards, these two are living like savages. But they honestly don't know this -- because Guys, in their natural state, aren't any more aware of domestic standards than a trout would be aware of the stock market. And this causes women a lot of concern. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SEATTLE - E-CAFE - DAY \nSEATTLE GIRL Take laundry. To him his clean clothes are ready when he's ready to go get them. And they can dry the rest of the way in the drawer. But they don't dry the rest of the way in the drawer, they sit there in damp musty unfolded balls and he doesn't even mind, and I can't figure that out. What is the matter with folding something? What is the matter with waiting for it to be dry? \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAVE'S CURRENT BEDROOM - DAY \nDave unloads a laundry basket on the bed. Starts folding the clean clothes and making piles. \nDAVE Laundry's a big issue - and a deep and puzzling mystery to guys. My own wife Michelle, for instance, is an accomplished sportswriter and mother of an extremely young child, yet she is still able to maintain a vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen bordering on the super-human. And I'm not allowed near the stuff. \nMICHELLE (comes in with more \nCLOTHES) He's right. She dumps out the clothes, sees what he's doing and takes over, doing it better. Dave picks up a random BLOUSE, shows a LABEL with lots of printing on it. \nDAVE These are clearly secret codes, that women intuitively understand but cannot adequately explain -- just like how a lot of guys understand the Infield Fly Rule, without being able to explain that. \nMICHELLE I can explain the Infield Fly Rule. \nDAVE Because you're special, Sweetheart. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"GUY BASHING\" \nEXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY \nDave anchors a semi circle with Sidra, Mia, Karla E and Lila. They take turns focus group style. \nSIDRA Sometimes I think they're just like tapeworms. You know? I mean tapeworms are just tapeworms - that's all they are, and all they'll ever be. They're just these repulsive little parasitic beasts and nobody expects anything different from them - because people know that's their nature. And it's the same way with guys - although a tapeworm's more likely to help clean out the garage. \n", "test1_input": "SIDRA No they grow up all right -- but only just enough - you know? \n(MORE) \nSIDRA (CONT'D) Like they'll meet the absolute minimum requirements of being a man, but that's it. The rest of the time they're fourth-graders. Walking fourth-graders. \nKARLA E More like driving fourth graders. \nSIDRA With credit cards. \nLILA And a phone. \nMIA And give them ten minutes on their own? Or put them in with other guys? Now you've gone nuclear. \nKARLA E Please. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BURGER KING - DAY \nThe lot is filled with 60's and 70's cars. Dave gets out of a CHEVY VEGA; has mutton-chop sideburns, talks to CAMERA. \nDAVE In learning to understand Guys today, it's important to remember that these same guys, only yesterday, were just kids. \nCUT TO : \nINT. BURGER KING - DAY \nA table of 8 YEAR OLD BOYS: punching, eating, climbing all over each other. One poor luckless DAD with them. \nBURGER KING DAD Stop punching! \nBURGER KING KID We're not punching! \nBURGER KING DAD You are too punching - now stop! We didn't come here to punch! \nThey stop; look at him as if he's crazy. Then one of them notices ROGER AT 8 looking O.S. \nBURGER KING KID Hey Roger's got a girlfriend. \nROGER AT 8 I do not! \nBURGER KING KID Then what're you looking at! \nROGER AT 8 Nothing! And they start punching again. The Dad looks up - so weary... \nDAVE \n(AT COUNTER) Here we can see where even at an early age, guy behavior is already well developed along complex patterns that social scientists have called, \"jerks.\" While girls at the same age are referred to by the same social scientists, as \"human beings.\" \nANGLE ON A TABLE FULL OF GIRLS - INCLUDING ELAINE AT AGE 8 They are all chatting nicely, passing out napkins and ketchup packets making sure everyone has what they need. While the MOTHER that brought them quietly reads a novel. \nDAVE See? Humans. He walks past with his takeout order. As ELAINE at 8 notices Roger, blushing, taking all this punishment because of her. \nBURGER KING DAD (as Dave exits) Will you please stop punching! \nCUT TO: \nINT. NOTED PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nDave sits across from a BRITISH GUY with a SUBTITLE saying, \"Noted Pediatrician. \" He has a laser pointer and a powerpoint presentation. \n", "test1_true": "SCIENTIFIC EXPERT Well first, one must understand the inherent differences in DNA and cell structure as relates to men and women. \n(CLICKING SLIDES) For example, all women have a gene that makes them have the need for meaningful conversations. Likewise, all men have a gene in them that we scientists believe is directly related to violence. \nDAVE And what can be done about that. \nSCIENTIFIC EXPERT well, some of my esteemed colleagues are quite keen on the idea of tampering with the DNA itself - an idea with which I heartily disagree. The bastards... \nDAVE Then what would you recommend. \nSCIENTIFIC EXPERT Me? Well they can start by spreading out the funding a little bit. Let a few other scientists wet their beaks. I mean what's the point of rewarding the same tired old hacks, year after \nYEAR -- \nDAVE I meant about Guy Violence. \nSCIENTIFIC EXPERT \nOH -- (then shifting back) Well nothing, really. I mean, what can you do. Short of lobotomizing them, anyway. No I suppose we'll just have to continue to channel their aggression into socially acceptable outlets. Like professional wrestling, or the space program. \nDAVE I see. Can I ask you a question? \nSCIENTIFIC EXPERT Certainly. \nDAVE Where'd you get that laser pointer. \nSCIENTIFIC EXPERT It's mine. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOY WORLD WAREHOUSE PLANET - DAY \nDave stands in front of the entrance. \nDAVE A lot of work has been done in the field of children's toys and how they unconsciously reinforce gender roles. Studies have found that over ninety-three per cent of this work is done by researchers who don't have children of their own. But to test the theory anyway, we're here at Toy World Warehouse Planet. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOY WORLD WAREHOUSE PLANET - DAY \nDave shepherds new father GENE up to the CUSTOMER HELP counter. \nDAVE Hi! My friend here is looking for toys for his son that are gender neutral, environmentally sound, and culturally unbiased! \nSALES GUY Here it is. He brings up a box with a picture of a spinning top on it. \nNEW FATHER GENE What's it do? \nSALES GUY It's recyclable. \nNEW FATHER GENE Where are the trucks and guns. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOY WORLD PARKING LOT - DAY \nNew Father Gene meets up with NEW MOTHER KELLY at the car. She came from GROCERY WORLD; he helps load up the bags... \nNEW MOTHER KELLY What's this? \n", "test2_input": "A JERSEY GIRL on break at a SNACK HUT. \nJERSEY GIRL What I don't get is how they can be a fully grown adult male and not be able to make a commitment to a woman who loves him like no one else - and yet the same person, at age seven, could make an unbreakable lifelong commitment to the San Francisco Giants, who do not even know him and who never will. (shakes her head) I just don't get it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SEATTLE - E-CAFE - DAY \nA SEATTLE GIRL outside the cafe. \nSEATTLE GIRL They're never \"ready.\" If you ask me, guys are in a permanent state of nonreadiness. That's where they live. If guys were turkey breasts, you could put one in a 350 degree oven on the Fourth of July and they still wouldn't be ready in time for Thanksgiving. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHICAGO - RARE BOOKS STORE - DAY \nThe OWNER arranges titles on a display outside her store. \nCHICAGO GIRL The thing is, you shouldn't even think about marrying them until you really know them. But you can't really know them until you marry them. (then after a beat) That's the thing. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"GUY FIDELITY\" \nEXT. MANHATTAN - DAY \nA Manhattan Girl gives a world-weary look. \nMANHATTAN GIRL One: A guy will have sex with anything. Two: A guy will do anything to have sex. There's your Guy Fidelity. Move on. \nCUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: \"GUY PRIDE\" \nINT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S MARRIED HOUSE - DAY \nElaine and Roger are inside, looking at the front door. \nELAINE What do you mean, it's 'supposed to be that way.' It's stuck. \nROGER It's basic physics, Elaine. Wood expands. And then, later, it contracts. \nELAINE But we can't get out. \nROGER Which also means other people can't get in. That's part of the design - it discourages burglars. \nELAINE (looks at him) The same way the toaster was designed to discourage carbohydrate consumption by bursting into flames? \nROGER That was an outdoor toaster. It was clearly not designed for indoor situations. The PICTURE FREEZES. DAVE steps in front, talks to CAMERA. \nDAVE I think it's obvious here, that Roger has absolutely no idea what he's talking about. But Guy Pride forces him to keep acting like he does know, for reasons I believe we've covered in an earlier scene. He nods his head over to the corner, where the CAMERA PANS TO SEE HUDDLED VISIGOTHS, WAITING. Then BACK TO ROGER AND ELAINE as the PICTURE UNFREEZES. \nELAINE Okay. So now we have a broken water heater and a stuck front door. \n(CONTROLS HERSELF; \nTHEN) I think it's time to call Steve. ELAINE'S IMAGE FREEZES. Roger turns to the CAMERA. \nROGER \"Steve.\" \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_true": "STEVE leaves someone's house, heads for his super-outfitted TRUCK. Haloed in golden sunlight. Strong, capable, equipped for every situation. WOMEN look out from kitchen and bedroom and living room windows, from front steps and yards and gardens, just to see whose house Steve is leaving. The women look all dreamy the way they would in a really corny musical. \nDAVE (watching; to CAMERA) As far as women are concerned, God didn't really rest on the seventh day. On the seventh day, God created Steve. As the Women all sigh... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY \nElaine stands at the basement door. CLANGING down there. \nELAINE Roger? Did you find anything? \nINTERCUT WITH ROGER IN THE BASEMENT He's in ankle deep water. Pokes a FLASHLIGHT into some of the corners where the overhead bulb doesn't reach. \nROGER Good news, honey! The basement's level. \nELAINE How can you tell? \nROGER Because I know a well built floor when I see one! We were right to buy this house. Everything works just the way it should! \nELAINE Except there's no hot water. \nROGER (aiming the flashlight) Sweetheart, don't you remember? The power company talked about this. \nELAINE How about calling Steve. \nROGER \n(HATES THIS) We'll call \"Steve,\" when we have a real problem. Okay? (then more to himself) A mouse gets the hiccups, you don't have to call Steve every time. \nELAINE (hears him whang something down there) But Roger you're such a good copy editor. You don't have to be a good repairman too! Honest! \nROGER Okay I think I found it. \nELAINE The problem? \nROGER The water heater. Elaine leans her head against the door jam. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY \nElaine sits on the step, looking blank. Kelly is with her. There are LOUD NOISES from the basement. \nELAINE I don't know why he does this. He doesn't know what he's doing down there... \nKELLY It'll be all right. \nELAINE (off a loud CLANG) It's not like some broken part is just going to be standing there, waving a flag that says \"Help me.\" Or there'll be an octopus on the compressor, and then he could say, \"Look! There's an octopus on the compressor!\" \n(THEN) Of course, how would he know it was the compressor... \nKELLY Trust me, it'll all work out. After a while, there's no more harm they can do. Roger comes around from the side door. SLOSHING feet. Holds a dripping PART. \nROGER I just need to go to the hardware store. Hi Kelly. Kelly smiles, waves. Then as Roger sloshes past, to the car. \nELAINE And what is it about the hardware store? All they do in there is buy a bunch of tools that they don't know how to use -- and no matter what the problem is, all they'll end up doing is whacking at it with a hammer until it breaks even more. \nKELLY And then they cover it all up with duct tape and then come out and say it's supposed to work that way. \n", "test3_input": "ELAINE \n(SOLIDARITY NOD) Then we have to call Steve. And they get offended. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY \nRoger waits at the counter. Talks to CAMERA. \nROGER Let me tell you something. If I had a dollar for every time I heard \"Steve's\" name, I could hire somebody better than Steve, just to shake things up. Get her one of these old semi-retired guys - someone from the pre-steroid days, with the hairy shoulders, and the butt crack. They won't be so quick to call him every ten minutes. The Clerk comes back. Hands over a 53-piece TOOL SET. \nCLERK Remember. Keep these away from anything magnetic. \nROGER \n(WINKS) Got it. He takes the tool kit from the Clerk and drops it. The Clerk watches Roger chase down all the parts: what a dolt. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nRoger puts the tool set in his trunk...then stops. \nROGER The thing is - I missed out. (turns to CAMERA) It's like everyone else was there the day they taught all this stuff. How to look inside acar.Or a furnace. Or a rocketship.But the guys like Steve, youknow.They were born knowing allthis- and now they're laughing. \n(MORE) \nROGER (CONT'D) They all go down to the Competent Guys' Tavern and compare notes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COMPETENT GUYS' TAVERN - DAY \nVANS and PICKUP TRUCKS just like Steve's are parked outside. A STEVE LOOKALIKE gets out and goes in, greeting ANOTHER STEVE also arriving. LAUGHTER pours out from inside. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY \nSteve rings the bell. Elaine tries opening the door. \nELAINE (on other side) I'm sorry - the door's stuck. \nSTEVE I can fix that. He checks it out, taps it in one place and opens the door. Elaine steps aside, enchanted -- -- as Roger drives up and sees this. And the pain in his heart is something we can feel. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S BASEMENT - DAY \nPower's back on. Steve pulls the cover off the HVAC assembly. Roger is sorting through the 53-piece tool set he bought and has no idea what to do with. \nSTEVE If you've got a minute, sir. I'd like to show you something. \nROGER (holds up tool kit) Should I bring these? \nSTEVE That won't be -- (then as all the parts \nFALL OUT) -- necessary. \nROGER \n", "test3_true": "STEVE I can fix that. Roger puts the tool kit down. Joins Steve. \nSTEVE There's your problem right there. \n(POINTS) You got calcification in your pullet- beam header grommets. \nROGER I was afraid of that. Steve looks at him. One of those sideways looks. \nSTEVE What you gotta do is jack up your laminate bolts and remove the calcification on the stress points. \nROGER (while Steve takes \nSOME MEASUREMENTS) Of course when he says \"you,\" he doesn't mean \"me.\" I don't have jacks. I don't have winches. And Steve has got like fifty kinds of each, right on his truck. If society collapsed, the Steves of the world will be living in nice sturdy shelters that they built with their own hands, eating food that they grew or caught. And I'll be getting shredded to death by wolverines. \nSTEVE Here we go. He reaches down. Pulls out a fuse assembly, holds it up. \nSTEVE Here we go. Back in business in no time. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY \nSteve is packing up his truck. Roger is about to go back \nINSIDE WHEN: \nKID Dad, look! Look what Steve made me! A working battleship made entirely out of Coke cans! Roger looks. It is a working battleship made from Coke cans. \nKID This is so neat! Thanks, Steve! The kid runs off. Roger looks at Elaine. \nROGER Do we have a kid? \nELAINE Steve got him from the truck. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STEVE'S TRUCK - TRAVELING - DAY \nDave rides up front with Steve. Talks to CAMERA. \nDAVE Just because Steve can fix things, doesn't mean he's shallow and doesn't have any concerns. All guys have concerns. Deep concerns. \nSTEVE \n(LOOKS OVER) You like SportsTalk? Mike the Moose? \nDAVE Hell yeah. Steve gives him a look. Turns on the radio. \nCALLER I'm just sayin' those owners better never run into me. Because God help 'em, man. \nMIKE THE MOOSE -- and we'll pick up on that and more, right after the news. \nCALLER I mean it, man. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

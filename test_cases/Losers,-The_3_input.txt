Roque, looking out the back window: 
ROQUE Here they come... 
Sure enough, the COBRAS are now tracking the VAN. Spotlights, swinging towards them... 
The asphalt behind them ERUPTS. CANNON-FIRE blowing HUGE CHUNKS OF ROAD into the sky! SCREAMING over the SOUND: 
CLAY Somebody shoot something! 
Cougar HEFTS HIS RIFLE. Setting up shop in the back. Sighting the choppers through his scope. Jensen, excited, and a little delirious from blood loss: 
JENSEN I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug, do you have a plan? (to the others) He's got a plan! 
POOCH (trying to steer) Stop yelling at the sniper! THROUGH THE SCOPE -- Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the chopper on the left... Smiles, PRESSES THE TRIGGER... 
And we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters. 
The bullet strikes the tail rotor DEAD CENTER -- it SHORTS and spins off -- sending the chopper itself into a spin -- COLLIDING with it's TWIN CHOPPER on the right -- they both twist and hink up -- their ROTORS SLICING INTO EACH OTHER -- both FINALLY CAREENING ONTO THE FREEWAY BEHIND 
Our guys. Driving away from the carnage of two exploding Cobra Helicopters splattered across the road... 
Safe. 
EXT. LEAR JET 550 (FLYING) -- DAY Coming in for LANDING... 
INT. LEAR JET 550 -- DAY 
As it taxis towards a HANGAR. Max straightens his suit. Wade on the phone, frowning. Bad news. He flips the phone shut. To Max: 
WADE They got away. 
MAX So? (MORE) 
MAX (CONT'D) (off Wade's look) We know exactly where they're going, Wade. Port of New York, for their big final awesome stand against the forces of evil where they die. 
He claps Wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps... 
INT. HANGAR -- DAY 
...where the TWO INDIAN SCIENTISTS wait. The Indian THUG CREW has been beefed-up to about TEN BIZARRE LOOKING, BLACK SUITED TOUGH GUYS. 
SHORT SCIENTIST Do you have the money? 
MAX Jesus, always with the money! So impersonal! How are you? How have you been? 
SHORT SCIENTIST I recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window. How have you been? 
MAX Can't complain. I'm thinking of getting satellite radio in my car... 
SHORT SCIENTIST I think you're a freak. Too much Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy football. 
Max smiles and spreads his arms... 
MAX Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby. 
SHORT SCIENTIST We have your ordinance. You have twenty four hours to get the money. 
Max looks over to Wade. 
MAX Time to go make a withdrawal... 
As he turns back to the plane... 
SHORT SCIENTIST New change of plan. You stay. 
MAX I've got to go get your money. 
SHORT SCIENTIST He'll get your money. You stay right here. 
A PAUSE as Max contemplates this little twist. 
MAX God, are you short. SHORT SCIENTIST Twenty three hours, fifty nine minutes... 
Max looks at Wade. 
MAX Get it done. 
Wade heads for the jet. Max watches him go. As Wade boards the jet Max takes a big sigh. For the first time, looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things as he would like. Max Looks back to the Short Scientist. 
MAX (CONT'D) How much do you weigh? Seriously.

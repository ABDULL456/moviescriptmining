PATIENCE 
I guess not... 
LONE 
Then -- bye, now. He sounds disappointed. As the door shuts, Patience clutches her hair, makes a SOUND of frustration, almost like a MEOW. 
INT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 
PATIENCE flings open the door, calls after Lone: 
PATIENCE 
I want you... He turns, startled. Patience has a sultry, come-hither look in her eye, her VOICE has a lower, sexier tone. 
LONE 
Excuse me? She shudders. The sexy expression turns to one of shock and anxiety -- what has she done? Then, vamping: 
PATIENCE 
I want you, um, to forgive me.   For hitting you like that. 
LONE 
No need -- woman living alone, you can't take any chances. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE nods unsurely, starts to retreat into the apartment. LONE thinks, calls out to her. 
LONE 
Listen, I was gonna grab a cup of coffee... 
CUT TO: 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
LONE and PATIENCE move from a COUNTER with COFFEE CUPS in hand. Patience has cleaned up, dressed a little sexier than usual -- she looks good. 
PATIENCE 
So, did you always want to be a policeman? (beat, rolling her eyes) God, listen to me, Conversation 101. 
LONE 
(a laugh) Hey, we gotta start somewhere. Actually, when I was a kid, I wanted to be a rock star. They take seats at a small table. 
LONE 
I was kind of a delinquent back then, got into some trouble. There was a cop who helped me out. Made a difference. I figured... maybe I could do the same. 
PATIENCE 
Plus you can still get into trouble. 
LONE 
Right, but for the good guys... So what do you do? When you're not dumpster diving or cleaning chimneys, I mean. 
PATIENCE 
Accounting.   That is, I used to, I just lost my job. 
LONE 
I'm sorry. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
Don't be, it was pretty dull.   I guess when you get down to it, I'm pretty dull. Patience realizes she's not making for a great first date. 
PATIENCE 
Let me start over. It's just... I never got into any trouble or anything -- 
LONE 
Come on, never? 
PATIENCE 
Well, when I was little, but -- after I lost my folks I... I guess I turned into sort of a scaredy- ca -- um, pretty risk-averse. 
LONE 
That's not a bad thing.   It's a pretty dangerous world. 
PATIENCE 
Sometimes I just wish I was less of a wimp. 
LONE 
You're not afraid to admit you're afraid -- that takes guts.

NIGHT.                                     68A. \nLOOKING UP PAST HER ANKLES we SEE NANCY pulled sharply down into really deep water, the dim light of the surface and bathroom beyond receding with each yank.  And yet she somehow flails and gasps and struggles back towards the surface, managing by pure panic to break the surface with her hands! \n68B.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM.                                    68B. \nMARGE rushes to the door and listens, alarmed at the wild SPLASHING audible through the locked door. \nMARGE Nancy!  NANCY! \n68C.  EXT.  UNDERWATER SHOT.  NIGHT.                                     68C. \nMARGE'S VOICE reaches to the girl, who thrusts up through main force and breaks the surface with her head and shoulders. \n68D.  INT.  BATHTUB.                                                     68D. \nGasping and choking, NANCY breaks the surface of her bathwater, like a drowning sailer getting one last chance.  Her mother's VOICE booms over her, ECHOED and frantic -- and the loud BANGING on the door finally opens her eyes.  She turns and calls gasping to her mother -- \nNANCY Mommy! \nREVERSE ON THE DOOR -- as MARGE, using the old hangar through the doorhandle truck, makes it into the room.  She rushes across to the tub.  NANCY is staggering up in the bathwater, again with solid porcelain beneath her feet. \nMARGE I told you!  Hundreds of people a year drown like that! \nThe mother throws a towel around the gasping girl, helps her from the tub and begins drying her like a child.  NANCY looks like she's likes paralized with some sort of weird dread. \nMARGE You okay? \nNANCY Great \nMARGE (not believing it for a minute) To bed with you, c'mon. \nMARGE rushes out to get the room ready.  NANCY turns and looks at herself in the cabinet mirror, then opens the medicine chest and begins a quick, furtive search. \nCLOSER as she takes out the box of No Doz and slips it into her robe. \nOMIT SCS. 69 & 70-------------------------------          OMIT SCS. 69 & 70 \n71.

MARGE follows as the girl plods obediently to her room. \nMARGE No television, forget the homework, no phone calls. \nNANCY No, Mother.  Yes, Mother. No, Mother. \n72.   INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        72. \nMARGE And no school tomorrow, either. you take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change. \nNANCY Yes, Mother.  G'night. \nMARGE offers a smile, and a little yellow pill. \nMARGE Take this, it'll help you sleep. \nNANCY Right. \nNANCY pops it in her mouth and swallows obediently.  MARGE leans to her with a kiss. \nMARGE Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite. \nMARGE goes out, relieved.  NANCY closes the door, leans against it and spits the pill into her hand.

PULL BACK to REVEAL NANCY propped up in bed, furtively watching.  Or  75. is she just thinking?  A bedside CLOCK reads 12:45 pm. \nThe girl YAWNS.

A DIVER struggles to keep facing a      75A. large circling shark. \n75B.  ON NANCY.

NIGHT.                            76. \nHIGH ANGLE, AT SECOND-STORY LEVEL.  NANCY looks directly across the street to a lighted, open window.  Its curtains, sucked out and waving in the night breeze, give the only motion to the deserted street. \nThen someone pitches out of the dark at her.  NANCY gives a YELP -- then clamps her hand over her mouth as she recognizes GLEN, balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside her window. \nGLEN Sorry!  Saw your light on. Thought I'd see how you were. \nShe gets herself together, barely. \nNANCY Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street. \nGLEN Shut up and let me in.  You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet? \n76A.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        76A. \nNANCY looks over her shoulder to make sure her mother hasn't heard.  GLEN's already through her window and planted on her bed.  NANCY points to a chair. \nNANCY If you don't mind. \nGLEN crosses to the chair and plops down. \nGLEN So.  I heard you freaked out in English class today. \nThere's no maliciousness in his voice, and the familiar frankness is actually comforting to NANCY. \nNANCY Guess I did. \nGLEN Haven't slept, have you? \nNANCY Not really. \nNANCY tries to smile, but can't fake it very well.  GLEN looks her over. \nGLEN You look dead and rained on, if you want the ugly truth.  And what you do to your arm? \nShe shrugs, trying to keep it casual. \nNANCY Burned myself in Englsh class. \nShe hazards a look in the mirror, and her jaw drops. \nNANCY M'god, I look twenty years old. (turning back to him) You have any weird dreams last night? \nGLEN Slept like a rock. \nNANCY (pleased) Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off. (off) You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen? \nGLEN No. \nNANCY You believe in the Boogey Man? \nGLEN One two, Freddie's coming for you?  No.  Rod killed Tina. he's a fruitcake and you know it. \nNANCY You believe in anything? \nGLEN I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll.  And I'm not too sure about you lately. \nNANCY thinks. \nNANCY Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask. \nGLEN Uh-oh... \nNANCY It's nothing too hard or anything. (beat) I'm just going to...

Furious, NANCY janks open the drawer before MARGE can stop her     120. and spills the bottle and hat onto the counter. \nMARGE grabs away the bottle protectively -- but it's the hat NANCY goes for.  She waves it triumphantly -- demonically. \nNANCY It's real, Mamma.  Feel it. \nMARGE (horrified) Put that damned thing down! \nMARGE lunges for it -- NANCY leaps out of reach -- \nNANCY His name is even in it -- written right in here -- Fred Krueger -- Fred Krueger!  You know who that is, Mamma?  You better tell me, cause now he's after me! \nMARGE swallows, then persists in the lie. \nMARGE Nancy, trust your mother for once -- you'll feel better as soon as you sleep! \nNANCY shoots a hard humorless laugh, holding up her slashed arm. \nNANCY You call this feeling better? Or should I grab a bottle and veg out with you -- avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded -- \nMARGE slaps her hard. \nMARGE (losing it) Fred Krueger can't be after you, Nancy -- he's dead! \nThe room falls silent, both women staring at the other. \nMARGE (CONTD) (low, raw) Fred Krueger is dead.  Dead and gone.  Believe me, I know.  Now go to bed.  I order you, go to bed. \nMARGE snatches the hat away.  NANCY is furious, betrayed. \nNANCY You knew about him all this time, and you've been acting like he was someone I made up! \nMARGE pulls away. \nMARGE You're sick, Nancy.  Imagining things.  You need to sleep, it's as simple as that. \nNANCY wheels and smashes MARGE'S bottle of gin in the sink. \nNANCY Screw sleep! \nMARGE (CONTD) Nancy! \nBut NANCY runs past her mother for the front door. \nMARGE (CONTD) Nancy -- it's only a nightmare! \nNANCY turns in the doorway. \nNANCY That's enough! \nOn the door SLAM, we \nCUT TO \n121.

We hear GLEN's VOICE and PAN UP to REVEAL NANCY and GLEN high above, two tiny figures walking across this strange white bridge in old Los Angeles.  CAMERA BEGINS A SLOW ZOOM. \nGLEN Whenever I get nervous I eat. \nNANCY And if you can't do that, you sleep. \nGLEN Used to.  Not anymore. \nGLEN jams more Big Mack into his face.  By now our ZOOM reveals he's attacking a huge bag of Big Macks, and furtively eyeing NANCY.  The girl's hair is startlingly white in the sunlight. She's reading a book, hardly paying attention. \nGLEN (CONTD) You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming? \nNANCY No. \nGLEN They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'.  So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right? \nNANCY Yeah. \nGLEN Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. (grins hopefully) They get all their art literature from dreams.  Just wake up and write it down.  Dreamskills. \nHe stops, seeing the look on NANCY's face.  Our ZOOM is much closer now, a wide medium, and still coming in on the kids. \nNANCY And what if they meet a monster in their dream?  Then what? \n", "test2_true": "NANCY What happens if they don't do that? \nGLEN (shrugs) I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens. \nNANCY Great. \nShe leans over the railing, poking her face back into her book. GLEN tips its cover and reads its title.  OUR ZOOM IS STILL MOVING CLOSER, a MEDIUM CLOSE UP NOW. \nGLEN 'Booby Traps and Improvised Anti-personel Devices'! \nNANCY I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura. \nGLEN (shocked) Well what you reading it for? \nOUR ZOOM LOCKS IN ON A TIGHT TWO ON THEIR FACES, NANCY's grimly determined. \nNANCY I'm into survival. \nShe walks away, OUT OF FRAME, leaving GLEN watching after her in astonishment. \nGLEN She's starting to scare the living shit out of me. \n122.  EXT. ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME/EVENING                               122. \nANGLE ACROSS NANCY'S \"TREE LAWN\", the grass between the sidewalk and the street, in the general direction of GLEN's home.  This ANGLE doesn't quite reveal Nancy's house. \nFOREGROUND is a utility truck in which a half dozen Hispanic WORKERS are loading tools, extension cords and hardware.  They look like they've put in one hell of a hard day's work. \nMARGE appears and hands a check to the FOREMAN of the crew, a white guy in clean coveralls and a gold chain.  He scrutinizes it. \nFOREMAN And the other... \nMARGE forks over a wad of cash, hands trembling in her half-drunk, helpless rage. \nMARGE Where's your mask and gun? \nThe FOREMAN counts the money swiftly. \nFOREMAN Don't bust my chops, lady. If the city found out I put 'em in without inside releases I'd loose my license. \nHe shoves the money in his pocket and climbs in his truck.  MARGE EXITS FRAME for her house. \nPAN WITH THE TRUCK as it pulls away, THEN PICK UP NANCY, walking across the street from the corner.  Alone.  Dispirited.  She lifts her eyes to her home and stops in her tracks. \nNANCY Oh gross... \n123.  WIDENING TO REVEAL THE HOUSE as NANCY walks across her front       123. yard.  Every single window has been covered with brand-new ornamental iron bars, bolted deeply into their frames. \nCLOSER, AT A WINDOW.  NANCY gives a set of bars a powerful shake.  They don't budge.  Then girl looks up and sees even the window to her second floor bedroom is barred.  And the rose trellis has been ripped down and heaped at the foundation in a tangle of wood, thorns and broken flowers. \n124.  INT.  MARGE'S ROOM.  EVENING.                                      124. \nANGLE ON THE DOORWAY INTO THE HALL.  Easy listening MUSIC wafts through the air.  NANCY appears in the doorway. \nNANCY (OS) Mom, what's with the bars!? \n125.  REVERSE to MARGE, propped against the headboard of her bed, a      125. crooked shadow in the gloom.  A fresh bottle of Gin glints in her hand. \nNANCY Oh, Mom... \nThe girl crosses and reaches gently for the bottle.  MARGE snatches it away. \nMARGE 'S'mine... \nShe rocks the bottle in her arms. \nNANCY What's with the bars? \nMARGE S'curity. \nNANCY sits on the bed, a surprising compassion entering her voice. \nNANCY Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger. \nMARGE Dead and gone. \nNANCY I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy. \n", "test2_id": 2170, "test3_input": "MARGE gives a laugh -- a rasping chachination from deep in her chest. \nMARGE (CONTD) Your father the cop.  That's a good one. (colder) Forget Fred Krueger.  You don't want to know, believe me. \nNANCY I do want to know.  He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know! \nMARGE blinks at her a moment, then cracks a terrible, crooked grin. \nMARGE All right. \n126.  INT. NANCY'S CELLAR/NIGHT                                          126. \nMARGE drags NANCY headlong down the cellar stairs and across the room with a crazy fury, twisting her down near the foundation. And she thrusts her face so close to her daughter's that NANCY reels from the alcohol. \nMARGE You want to know who Fred Krueger was?  He was a filthy child killer who got at least twenty kids, kids from our area, kids we all knew.  It drove us all crazy when we didn't know who was doing it -- but it was even worse when they caught him. \nMARGE draws herself up with a shake. \nMARGE (CONTD) Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that. \nNANCY So he's alive? \nMARGE smiles grimly. \nMARGE He wouldn've stopped.  The bastard would've got more kids first chance he got -- they found nearly ten bodies in his boiler room as it was.  But the law couldn't touch him. \nAt the mention of \"boiler room\", NANCY gives a shake.  MARGE misses this, too busy taking a pull on the bottle that's never left her hand. \nMARGE (CONTD) What was needed were some private citizens willing to do what had to be done. \nShe reels slowly, looking at NANCY is defiance. \nNANCY (hushed) What did you do, mother? \nMARGE cradles the bottle. \nMARGE Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go.  Found him in an old boiler room, just like before.  Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side... \nNANCY (dreading it) Go on... \nMARGE reaches over and taps a dusty two-gallon jug of gasoline near the lawn mower. \nMARGE We poured gasoline all around the place, left a trail out the door, locked the door, then... \nShe mimes striking a match -- \nMARGE (CONTD) WHOOSH!!! \nHer arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that fire.  There's awe in her voice.  Then she drops her arms. \nMARGE (CONTD) (hushed, remembering) But just when it seemed not even the devil could live in there any more -- he crashed out like a banshee, all on fire -- swinging those fingerknives every which direction and screaming he... he was going to get us by killing all our kids... \nShe stops with a sudden quake and drinks for a long moment.  But the intake doesn't hide the image.  Her face bathed in tears, she looks at her daughter and shakes her head. \nMARGE (CONTD) There were all those men, Nancy, even your father, oh yes, even him.  But none could do what had to be done -- Krueger rolling and screaming so loud the whole state could hear -- no one could take your father's gun and kill him good and proper except me. \nShe sweeps her hand across the air in a terrific slash, then stops, her hand shaking, her voice hoarse and terrified.  She looks at her daughter, begging. \nMARGE (CONTD) So he's dead Nan.  He can't get you.  Mommy killed him. \nFor someone who started this film at a very young seventeen, NANCY's now the battle-tempered veteran as she takes her mother in her arms and rocks her. \nNANCY Who was there?  Were Tina's parents there?  Were Rod's? \nMARGE sags back. \nMARGE Sure, and Glen's.  All of us. But that's in the past now, baby.  Really.  It's over. (slyly) We even took his knives. \nThe woman twists around and opens the door on an old furnace -- a furnace unused since the newer gas one nearby was put in.  She fishes inside the cavity -- as then we hear a touch of the familiar 'SCRRIITCH'.  Next moment she pulls out an object wrapped in rags, opens it and displays the long, rusted blades and their glove-like apparatus. \nMARGE (CONTD) See? \nNANCY stares at the damn things, chilled. \nNANCY All these years you've kept those things buried down here?  In our own house? \nMARGE (CONTD) Proof he's declawed.  As for him, we buried him good and deep. \nMARGE shoves the knives into their hiding place, closes the little iron door. \n", "test3_true": "She lurches up and staggers upstairs. \nNANCY shivers and looks down at her arm.  The cut beneath her bandage has begun to bleed again.  And from inside the furnace, as if from deep below, the PULSING of the boundless nightmare-boiler room can be faintly heard. \n127.  EXT.

Hi, how y'doing? \nNANCY looks out the window and touches her hair. \nNANCY (CONTD) Fine.  Stand by your window so I can see you.  You sound a million miles away. \nIn the lighted window across the way, she can SEE GLEN move into sight.  In his shot, we can SEE NANCY step into her window behind the bars. \nNANCY (CONTD) Much better. \nGLEN I heard your ma went ape at the security store today.  You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something.  How long's it been since you slept? \nNANCY Coming up on the seventh day.  It's okay, I checked Guiness.  The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to. (beat) Listen, I... I know who he is. \nGLEN Who? \nNANCY The killer. \nGLEN You do? \nNANCY Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next. \nGLEN is appalled. \nGLEN Me!?  Why would anyone want to kill me?! \nNANCY Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out. \nGLEN pales. \nGLEN Bring him out of what? \nNANCY My dream. \nGLEN How you plan to do that? \nNANCY Just like I did the hat.  Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up. \nGLEN Me? (switching back to a more comfortable reality) Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream! \nNANCY If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts. \nGLEN I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway. \nNANCY Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out. \nGLEN What!? \nNANCY (simplicity itself) You heard me.  I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up.  We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him.  Clever, huh? \nGLEN You crazy?  Hit him with what? \nNANCY You're a jock.  You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile... \nGLEN (weakly) Meanwhile..? \nNANCY Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep.  Midnight. \nShe hangs up.  GLEN's eyes bug out. \nGLEN Holy shit!  Midnight.

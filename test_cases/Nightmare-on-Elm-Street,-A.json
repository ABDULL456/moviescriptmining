{"train": "A Nightmare on Elm Street, by Wes Craven \nWes Craven's \nA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET \n1A.   INT.  (MONTAGE).                                                   1A. \nNIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME begins as we FADE UP on a SERIES OF SHOTS, all CLOSE and teasing. \n-- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking through a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash- dusted place.  A huge BOILER ROOM is what it is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal. Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten, reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL. \n-- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight razor, until its fingertips are off. \n-- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives out of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin, curved, gleaming sharp. \n-- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen his face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal being assembled with crude tools, into some sort of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus, against a background light of FIRE, and a deep rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY. \n-- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove. \n-- Then the BLADES attached to all of it. \n-- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like apparatus, filling it out and transforming it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened fingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing it to shreds. \n1.    EXT.  LOS ANGELES.  NIGHT.  (2nd Unit)                             1. \nA PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW.  MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed RUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS.  CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a HIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from within by a strange GREENISH LIGHT.  TITLES BEGIN. \nCAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of light. \nCUT TO: \n2.    INT.  CONCRETE PASSAGEWAY.                                         2. \nTITLES CONTINUE as TINA GRAY, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor.  Her steps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves free. \nA subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC. Distant insane LAUGHTER.  Slamming iron DOORS.  A bleating animal CRY.  A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and on into the dark.  No reason why it's there. \nThen another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of something like fingernails across slate.  It sets our teeth on edge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running. \n3.    INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 3. \nSuddenly TINA's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam pipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone.  She stops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly turns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN. \nThen she hears RIPPING FABRIC. \nSomeone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas, approaching TINA. \nCLOSER ON THE CANVAS.  The long curved fingerblades suddenly punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh. They make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND. \nTINA rushes away, hands over her ears. \nANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards.  Then the canvas flaps free.  The blades are gone.  The TITLES END, and everything goes silent. \nCAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes.  The light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress, leaving her naked and vulnerable.  Then a deep, ragged VOICE whispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE. \nVOICE (O.S.) One two, Freddie's coming for you... \nTINA opens her mouth to scream but only a dry, yellow dust pours out.  And at that precise moment a huge shadowy MAN with a grimey red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred face lunges at her.  And it's his fingers that are tipped with the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator. \nTINA dodges away, her legs suddenly elephantine and slow.  The MAN seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back. \nThe MUSIC shrieks as TINA manages to tear free -- the MAN lurches after her with a hoarse SHOUT as we -- \nSMASH CUT TO: \n4.    INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      4. \nTINA convulses in bed with a SCREAM, looking around wildly. Someone is KNOCKING on her door. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) You okay, Tina? \nTINA'S MOTHER sticks her head in with a worried look.  TINA sits up and blows out a breath, groggy. \nTINA Just a dream, Ma... (more to herself) Damn dream, is all... \nThe woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room.  A MAN hovers BACKGROUND.  TINA'S mother waves him away without looking, shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes.  She appraises her daughter. \nTINA'S MOTHER Some dream, judging from that. \nANGLE ON A MODEST HOME; no car, just a couple of BIKES in the drive.  Every light in the house and yard is turned on.  We HEAR the rock group MADNESS played at a 'No adults home' volume. \n9.    INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  9. \nON GLEN, dialing.  Nancy and TINA are watching, giggling. \nTINA I can't believe his mother let him come over here. \nNANCY Right.  Well, she didn't, exactly... \nGLEN shoves a cassette into TINA's Ghetto Blaster. \nGLEN (to TINA) See, I got this cousin who lives near the airport, that it's okay for me to stay with, right?  So I found this sound effects tape at Licorice Pizza, and... \nThe phone is answered.  GLEN jerks the tone arm off the record with a SCRUUPT!! \nGLEN (CONTD) Hello, Mom? (pushes the 'play' button) Yeah, out here at Barry's. \nA JET PLANE begins to make itself heard on the tape.  GLEN moves the machine closer to the phone.  It's a big plane -- sounds like a 747 coming in for a landing. \nGLEN (CONT) Huh?  Yeah, noisy as usual.  Glad we don't live here -- huh?  Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello. \nThe Jet is SCREAMING IN now, full flaps and howling like a monstrous banshee.  NANCY and TINA dissolve into muffled giggles. \nGLEN (CONT) (shouting over the din) Right, right -- I'll call you in the morning!  Right!  Huh?  Yeah, sure, I, huh?... \nSuddenly the tape goes silent.  GLEN blanches.  Next moment another ENGINE is heard, but this one is a FORD LOTUS screaming by at 180 mph. \nGLEN (CONT) (reacting to his mother's reaction) Uh... some kid's drag racing outside, I think... \nThe sound effect changes abruptly to a SPEEDING SEDAN -- and the ages-old SCREECH of BRAKES, last-second SCREAM and horrible COLLISION.  NANCY gamely tries to find the right button to turn it off, but misses.  There's a loud SCREEK of fast-forward mayhem -- Glen improvises desperately. \nGLEN (CONT) Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I think there's been an accident out front -- I -- \nNANCY jumps back from the cassette player -- WORLD WAR II bursts out at top volume -- MACHINE GUNS, HAND GRENADES, DIVING BEARCATS and SHOUTS of charging Huns.  GLEN makes a last-ditch dive and flings the cassette out of the machine. \nBlessed silence at last. \nGLEN (CONT) Right.  I'll call the police.  No, just some neighbors having a fight, I guess.  I'm fine, I'm fine! Call you in the morning! \nHe hangs up and sags back. \nNANCY Worked like a charm. \nGLEN Jesus. \nTINA shoves another cassette in, and MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THRILLER' blasts from the STEREO.  The kids relax, the CAMERA GLIDES PAST THEM TO THE WINDOW. \nThe WIND is moving the bare TREE BRANCH outside.  CAMERA PANS BACK to the comfortably threadbare room, uneasy.  We see NANCY poking at a flame in the hearth as TINA comes FOREGROUND to draw the drapes. \nNANCY Nice to have a fire. \nTINA Really.  Turn 'er up a little. \nNANCY turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs brightly over its artificial log.  TINA joins her, heartened. \nNANCY Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too.  He might get jealous. \nTINA Rod and I are done.  He's too much of a maniac. \nGLEN He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him. Like a hand grenade. \nTINA laughs despite herself.  NANCY brightens. \nNANCY See?  You've forgotten the bad dream.  Didn't I tell you? \nTINA shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten. \nTINA All day long I been seeing that guy's weird face, and hearing those fingernails... \nNANCY looks up with a flinch. \nNANCY Fingernails? (blinks, laughing) That's amazing, you saying that. It made me remember the dream I had last night. \nTINA looks up. \nTINA What you dream? \nNANCY I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me.  Sort of ...obscenely.  Then he walked out through the wall on the other side.  Like he'd just come to check me out... \nNANCY Rod... \nBut ROD's already got himself and TINA halfway through the living room, heading into the darker part of the house. \nROD We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest. \nANGLE BACK ON GLEN AND NANCY. \nNANCY We should get her out of here... \nTINA darts to the front door, her blouse half out. \nTINA Hey -- you guys're hanging around -- right? (fake laughing/whine) Don't leave me alone with this lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY! \nShe disappears.  GLEN looks at NANCY.  Too innocent. \nGLEN So we'll guard her together. Through the night. (moving closer) In each others' arms like we always said. \nNANCY Glen.  Not now.  I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves. \nShe kisses him lightly, then pushes him back. \nGLEN (frustrated) Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway? \nNANCY Because he was scary, that's why. \nGLEN Who was scary? \nNANCY turns and looks at him. \nNANCY Don't you think it's weird, her and me dreaming about the same guy? (GLEN looks away; NANCY stares closer) You didn't have a bad dream last night, did you? \nGLEN gives her a funny look. \nGLEN Me?  I don't dream. \nHe takes her inside.  Over the SOUNDS of locks falling shut we \nFADE TO BLACK \n13.   INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  13. \nFADE UP ON an old 50's CLOCK, one of those set into the black plaster body of a stalking panther.  It's just past 2 AM. \nPAN the cold hearth and darkened living room to REVEAL GLEN on the couch, cacooned in sheets.  He's listening miserably to the SOUNDS OF LOVEMAKING coming from the next room.  TINA peaks, ROD howls.  Then silence. \nGLEN Morality sucks. \nCUT TO: \n14.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             14. \nThis is a slightly larger room than TINA's.  Adult.  Female. Spare in its appointments.  The streetlight throws the narrow bed into broken shadow and light.  TINA AND ROD lie in each other's arms in the middle of the big bed.  Satiated. \nTINA I knew there was sometihng about you I liked... \nROD yawns into the pillows, happy. \nROD You feel better now, right? \nTINA Jungle man fix Jane. \nROD No more fights? \nTINA No more fights. \nROD (sleepily) Good.  No more nightmares for either of us then. \nHe pulls the covers over his head.  He's almost out already. \nTINA (beat) When did you have a nightmare? \nROD (under the blankets) Guys can have nightmares too, y'know.  You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something. \nHe rolls over, practically snoring, and pulls another cover over his head.  A dirty red and yellow cover. \nTINA (sleepily) Where'd you get this snotty old thing? \nSNORES from ROD.  TINA yawns, turns off the light and snuggles against ROD, pulling the cover gingerly over herself, too. \nNext moment the exact same shambling MAN from her nightmare staggers into view fifty feet behind her.  TINA falls back into the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion.  The MAN turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his right hand as he spreads his arms wide.  He starts scraping the steel FINGERNAILS along a cinderblock wall.  Orange sparks spurt out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the alley to the other -- and TINA is cut off from her home! \nCLOSE ON HER as the SCRAPING of the blades gets louder and closer.  She begins to shake uncontrollably. \nTINA Oh, shit, please God... \nKILLER (softly, approaching) This is God... \nHe holds up his steel-tipped hand like a surgical-steel spider. TINA runs for her life. \n27.   WIDER ANGLE IN THE ALLEY -- a terrifying, all-out footrace         27. between the girl and her pursuer.  The MAN is fast; the distance between them closes with each heartbeat.  TINA overturns ashcans -- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a window.  Ashen FACES appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and disappear in fright. \n28.   EXT.  TINA'S STREET.  NIGHT.                                       28. \nTINA runs out onto front lawns, SCREAMING for help.  No help comes.  In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on the block to be turned off.  The MAN roars out from behind a tree -- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl! TINA runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be trapped against its locked front door. \nShe hammers against its thick wood. \nTINA Nancy!  Open the door -- Nancy! \nThe MAN slows.  He has TINA now and knows it. \nMAN She's still awake.  Nancy can't hear you. \nTINA turns and looks full at the approaching MAN.  Smudged by deep shadow, he's big and hideous.  He wears the same dirty yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin over his misshapen face.  And on his fingers are the steel talons. \n29.   CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index   29. finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand.  Then another.  We SEE the PIECES OF FINGERS fall past TINA'S face in SLOW MOTION. \nANGLE ON THE GROUND of the FINGERS squirming on the ground, one flopping onto TINA's naked foot. \nTINA leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they were huge bugs. \nThe MAN snaps up his arm and the FINGERS fly back into place on his hand.  He leers at TINA -- then suddenly lunges at her, sweeping with his cutting hand! \nTINA's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines, and grabs the MAN's ugly face with her other hand.  But the face only slides off to the bone.  The MAN presses in, and TINA contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder -- cutting her deeply. \n29A.  TINA staggers backward, GROANING, her foot now inexplicably        29A. caught in bedclothes!  She falls over her bed's conformter, twists away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her! The skull-faced MAN crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling -- punctuated by his GRUNTS and the girl's DEAFENING SCREAMS -- and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until they're beneath it, fighting for life and death. \n30.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      30. \nROD lurches up into CLOSE UP in the lightless bedroom, half-awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere, somehow inside the dark bed.  ROD grabs groggily, lifting the blanket. \n30A.  IN HIS POV we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket -- see     30A. TWO SHADOWY FIGURES flailing and clawing under the bedspread -- TINA and the MAN -- or a shape that could be a man -- raging against each other. \nROD drops the blanket and leaps from the bed, scared full awake and terrified.  Then the horrible TINA's GASPS change to the CRIES of a terribly wounded victim.  ROD instantly jerks back the bedspread. \nIN HIS POV we SEE TINA struggling and flailing along on the sheets, the MAN nowhere in sight. \nROD T-tina!? \nSuddenly TINA -- eyes turned inward to her tormentor -- give an awful jolt -- her arms and legs are spraddled as if by overwhelming force and pinned to the bed.  Next instant, her nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her torso.  From no visible instruments!  A huge irrigation of blood floods the bed. \nTerrified, ROD dives for the light -- but at the same moment something invisible grabs TINA, wielding her body in the air and bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks ROD crashing into the light -- smashing it to bits. \n31.   CLOSER ON HIM as he struggles around.  In the blue FLASHES OF      31. ELECTRICITY ROD sees TINA sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark smear, dragged feet first! \nANGLE ON ROD -- paralized by terror! \nANGLE ON TINA'S DYING EYES -- moving with her up the wall and bumping around the corner onto the ceiling.  She's just looking at who's dragging her, eyes glazing. \nREVERSE IN HER POV -- to the shadowy, horrendously ugly MAN, dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body.  SEEN in FORCED PERSPECTIVE, the SHOT carries her across a great distance without seeming to get anywhere -- as if the ceiling is an endless plane. \nANGLE DOWN ON ROD -- on his hands and knees -- the lamp next to him blurting blue SPARKS and STROBING the nightmare room.  ROD'S screaming up at TINA'S invisible tormentor. \nROD What the hell's going ON here! Tina! \nANGLE ON TINA -- upside down, clawing at the hanging swag lamp above her mother's dressing table -- desperate for some anchor. But she's dragged away from it.  The lamp swings back, it's wires gushing more SPARKS. \nCLOSER along the ceiling as TINA rakes a long furrow in the ceiling with her fingernails.  But her eyes are glazing, glazing.  And then they fall closed. \nWIDE, UP ON THE CEILING, as her body suddenly flops loose, hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed. \nREVERSE ON ROD -- staring like a terrified child. \nROD Tina -- \nREVERSE IN HIS POV -- as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto the devastated bed, in SLOW MOTION, striking with a huge splash of blood.  A sick, awful GIGGLE floats around the room, then ECHOES off into infinity.  ROD staggers up, staring around as if hoping to see this phantom. \nROD You motherfucker!  I'll kill you for that! \nLT THOMPSON Terrific.  What the hell was she doing there? \nPARKER She lived there. \nLT THOMPSON OMIT 37.              I don't mean her --                           OMIT 37. \n38.   INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  38. \nTHOMPSON enters his office and confronts NANCY and her mother, MARGE SIMSON. \nLT THOMPSON (CONTD) I mean you. (accusingly, to Marge) What the hell was she doing there? \nMARGE SIMSON is in her middle thirties; a good-looking woman despite the hour and circumstances. \nMARGE Hello to you, too, Donald. \nTHOMPSON stops, the steam suddenly out of him.  The girl is a wreck and he winces to see it. \nLT THOMPSON Marge. \nTHOMPSON glances at PARKER and the other UNIFORMED COPS who are in the room.  As a man they head for the door.  There's no question who the boss is here.  THOMPSON turns to NANCY.  She fumbles a smile. \nLT THOMPSON (CONTD) How you doing, pal? \nNANCY Okay.  Hi, dad. \nNANCY's dress is dark with dried blood, her skin clammy and the color of paste.  MARGE shoots her ex-husband a worried glance. THOMPSON pulls a chair close to NANCY. \nLT THOMPSON I don't want to get into this now, god knows you need time. (hotter) But I'd sure would like to know what the hell you were doing shacked up with three other kids in the middle of the night -- especially a delinquent lunatic like Lane. \nNANCY weaves. \nNANCY Rod's not a lunatic. \nLT THOMPSON You got a sane explanation for what he did? \nThe girl is shredding a Kleenex, staring off. \nMARGE Apparantly he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina. \nNANCY (quietly) It wasn't that serious... \nMARGE Maybe you don't think murder's serious -- \nNANCY sits bolt upright in her chair, her eyes flashing. \nNANCY She was my best friend!  Don't you dare say I don't take her death seriously! (lower, near tears) I just meant their fights weren't that serious. \nThe girl holds the woman's eyes a moment, then looks away. \nNANCY (CONTD) (to herself) She dreamed this would happen... \nLT THOMPSON What? \nNANCY She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone. \nA tear splashes off the arm of her chair. \nMARGE She's been through enough for one night.  You have her statement. \nThe mother and daughter rise; THOMPSON raps on the door and PARKER opens it. \nLT THOMPSON (to MARGE) I suggest you keep a little better track on her -- she's still a kid, y'know. \nMARGE wheels on him. \nMARGE You think I knew there were boys there!?  You try raising a teenager alone. \nThen she and the girl are gone.  THOMPSON glares at PARKER. \nLT THOMPSON (low to PARKER) See they get home okay. \nPARKER shoves his hands in his pockets.  ON HIS FACE we \nFADE TO BLACK \n39.   INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  MORNING.                                   39. \nBURN ON \nNANCY The door was locked from your side. \nROD grabs her hard.  His muscular body tenses. \nROD Don't look at me like I'm some kind of fucking fruitcake or something, I'm warning you. \nVOICE (O.S.) Morning, Mr. Lane. \n42.   The boy jerks around.  NANCY's father, his .38 leveled right at    42. ROD's belly, eases out of the bushes. \nLT THOMPSON Now just step away from her, son. Like your ass depended on it. I'm warning you. \nROD backs away, looking once at NANCY with a look of terrible sadness.  Then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell. \nTHOMPSON snaps his revolver to fire -- but instinctively NANCY jumps between -- \nNANCY No! \nTHOMPSON jerks his gun into the air, furious. \nTHOMPSON Jesus -- are you crazy!? \nHe plunges past the girl. \n42A.  EXT.  STREET.  DAY.                                                42A. \nROD races like a frightened animal across the lawns -- but is soon cut off by the PLANECLOTHESMAN NANCY saw watching her before -- and then TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, who close from another angle.  The chase is short and pitifully off-balance, and ROD is soon wrestled to the ground.  Next moment one of the cops is holding ROD'S knife into the air for THOMPSON to see.  THOMPSON looks at NANCY, as if to say 'I told you.' Background, ROD'S SHOUTS can be heard as he's shoved into a SQUAD CAR. \nROD (O.S.) I didn't do it -- ! (fading) I didn't kill her, Nancy! \nThe car's door slams and ROD is gone.  NANCY turns to her father, livid. \nNANCY You used me, daddy! \nLT THOMPSON (exasperated) What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night! \nNANCY spins angrily and walks away. \nLT THOMPSON Nancy!  Hey! \nBut she just keeps going. \nFADE TO BLACK \n43.   INT.  CLASSROOM.  DAY.                                             43. \nFADE UP ON an ENGLISH TEACHER and CLASS, NANCY among the kids, trying to concentrate. \nTEACHER According to Shakespeare, there was something operating in Nature, perhaps inside human nature itself, that was rotten -- a canker, as he put it. \nThe TEACHER'S eyes glance across the room.  ANGLE ON NANCY; yawning but listening. \nTEACHER (CONTD) Of course Hamlet's response to this, and to his mother's lies, was to continually probe and dig -- just like the gravediggers -- always trying to get beneath the surface.  The same was true in a different way in Julius Caesar. Jon, go ahead... \nShe nods to a SURFER who's been waiting uncomfortably in front of the class.  He squints at his book and begins, the recitation a struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the Bard. \nSURFER (reading aloud) Uh, In the most high and palmy state of Rome... \nWISEGUY STUDENT (O.S.) California's the most high and palmy state, man. \nThe SURFER halts with a grin; KIDS snicker. \nENGLISH TEACHER Can it. \nShe glares them back into silence.  The SURFER starts over, as we CUT TO NANCY. \nShe's nodding off now, barely able to keep her eyes open in the warm, close boredom of the classroom. \nSURFER (O.S.) In the most high and palmy state of Rome, a little ere the mightiest Julius fell... (NANCY's head pitches forward; she jerks it back up, barely awake) The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the Roman street... \n44.   NANCY's head has sunk again, eyelids drawn as if by enormous       44. weight.  By the time her cheek's against the desk, the SURFER'S VOICE is ECHOED and DISTANT.  But another voice, TINA'S, is very near, very much present.  A sad, thin plaint. \nTINA (O.S.) Nancy. \nNANCY gives a start.  Her eyes lock onto something. \n45.   REVERSE.  TILTED SIDEWAYS, IN HER HEAD'S POV, we look straight     45. out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall. There, standing in a black pool of fluid, is a full-sized rubber body bag.  Dark red and yellow.  Weaving slightly, the merest suggesting of movement within it. \n46.   BACK ON NANCY, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes,    46. shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter.  She looks back out the door. \nWIDER ANGLE.  EVERYBODY is staring at NANCY as if she's gone mad.  The ENGLISH TEACHER rushes over, herself frightened by the terror in the girl's eyes. \nTEACHER Okay -- Okay, Thompson!  Every- thing's all right now -- Nancy!. \n60.   NANCY jerks around with panicked eyes, expecting the killer to     60. leap from any direction.  But there's only the sea of staring eyes. \nNANCY begins methodically picking up her books. \nTEACHER I'll call your mother. \nNANCY No!  No, really, I'm fine.  I'll go straight home.  I'm okay. \nShe marches for the door. \nTEACHER You'll need a hall pass! \nBut the girl's gone. \n61.   EXT.  THE SCHOOL.  DAY.                                            61. \nNANCY walks out of the building, shaken.  Then she pauses at one of the big pine trees out front, stops and rests her head against its bark, teeth set.  NANCY starts to shake, and next second she's sobbing like a broken-hearted, frightened child.        OMIT 61A. OMIT 61A. 62.   But she shakes herself silent.  Wipes the tears away with a slash  62. of sleeve.  She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then reacts in surprise and pain.  She lifts her arm and stares at the spot she's touched. \nINSERT ON HER ARM and the BURN there; about the size and shape of a half-dollar. \nWIDER ON NANCY.  Utterly, chillingly confused. \n62A.  TINA, against the tree inches from NANCY, (SC 7) -- turns to her and says -- \nTINA Couldn't get back to sleep at all. (beat) What you dream? \n63.   EXT.  A BUSY STREET.  DAY.                                         63. \nNANCY is walking quickly, head erect, jaw set.  Then she enters her father's Police Station. \n64.   INT.  VAN NUYS POLICE STATION.  DAY.                               64. \nNANCY crosses directly to the GARCIA. \nNANCY My dad here? \nGARCIA looks up from his paperwork. \nSERGEANT GARCIA Lieutenant. \nLT THOMPSON emerges from another room, uneasy to see NANCY. \nLT THOMPSON Decide to take a day off after all? \nNANCY Dad, I want to see Rod Lane. \nTHOMPSON doesn't miss a beat. \nLT THOMPSON Only family allowed, Nancy.  You know the drill. \nNANCY Just want to talk to him a second. \nLT THOMPSON He's dangerous. \nNANCY You don't know he did it. \nLT THOMPSON No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag. \nNANCY flinches; her father shows the first signs of color in his neck. \nNANCY I just want to talk to him. (beat, lower) Please, Dad. \nTHOMPSON shifts almost imperceptibly towards GARCIA, then turns back to NANCY. \nLT THOMPSON Make it fast. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n65.   INT.  CELL AREA.  DAY.                                             65. \nA GUARD exits pushing a cart of food trays.  NANCY waits warily until he's gone, then looks back to ROD LANE.  ROD looks more like a captured coyote than a human; haggard, ribbed, expecting poisoned bait.  His hair is wet, his clothes are borrowed jeans and work shirt. \nNANCY (low) And then what happened? \nROD I told you. (reluctantly) It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her. \nMARGE (OS) (through the door) You're not falling asleep, are you?  You could drown, you know. \nNANCY Mother, for petesakes. \nMARGE (OS) It happens all the time. (brighter) I've got some warm milk all ready for you.  Why don't you jump into bed? (fading) I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too.  C'mon, now. (then she's gone into another room) \nNANCY (low) Warm milk.  Gross. \nShe slides down to water level again, and sings softly, thoughtfully to herself. \nNANCY (CONTD) One, two, Freddie's coming for you, three four, better lock your door, five six, grab your crucifix, seven eight gonna stay up late, nine ten, never sleep again... \nThe next instant she's jerked with incredible violence straight down beneath the surface of the tub -- as if the bottom had suddenly dropped out and she was in a bottomless well! \n68A.  EXT.  UNDERWATER SHOT.  NIGHT.                                     68A. \nLOOKING UP PAST HER ANKLES we SEE NANCY pulled sharply down into really deep water, the dim light of the surface and bathroom beyond receding with each yank.  And yet she somehow flails and gasps and struggles back towards the surface, managing by pure panic to break the surface with her hands! \n68B.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM.                                    68B. \nMARGE rushes to the door and listens, alarmed at the wild SPLASHING audible through the locked door. \nMARGE Nancy!  NANCY! \n68C.  EXT.  UNDERWATER SHOT.  NIGHT.                                     68C. \nMARGE'S VOICE reaches to the girl, who thrusts up through main force and breaks the surface with her head and shoulders. \n68D.  INT.  BATHTUB.                                                     68D. \nGasping and choking, NANCY breaks the surface of her bathwater, like a drowning sailer getting one last chance.  Her mother's VOICE booms over her, ECHOED and frantic -- and the loud BANGING on the door finally opens her eyes.  She turns and calls gasping to her mother -- \nNANCY Mommy! \nREVERSE ON THE DOOR -- as MARGE, using the old hangar through the doorhandle truck, makes it into the room.  She rushes across to the tub.  NANCY is staggering up in the bathwater, again with solid porcelain beneath her feet. \nMARGE I told you!  Hundreds of people a year drown like that! \nThe mother throws a towel around the gasping girl, helps her from the tub and begins drying her like a child.  NANCY looks like she's likes paralized with some sort of weird dread. \nMARGE You okay? \nNANCY Great \nMARGE (not believing it for a minute) To bed with you, c'mon. \nMARGE rushes out to get the room ready.  NANCY turns and looks at herself in the cabinet mirror, then opens the medicine chest and begins a quick, furtive search. \nCLOSER as she takes out the box of No Doz and slips it into her robe. \nOMIT SCS. 69 & 70-------------------------------          OMIT SCS. 69 & 70 \n71.   INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             71. \nNANCY emerges from the bathroom yawning.  MARGE follows as the girl plods obediently to her room. \nMARGE No television, forget the homework, no phone calls. \nNANCY No, Mother.  Yes, Mother. No, Mother. \n72.   INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        72. \nMARGE And no school tomorrow, either. you take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change. \nNANCY Yes, Mother.  G'night. \nMARGE offers a smile, and a little yellow pill. \nMARGE Take this, it'll help you sleep. \nNANCY Right. \nNANCY pops it in her mouth and swallows obediently.  MARGE leans to her with a kiss. \nMARGE Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite. \nMARGE goes out, relieved.  NANCY closes the door, leans against it and spits the pill into her hand.  She tosses it straight out her window and takes a NoDoz. \nFADE TO BLACK \nGLEN makes the Twilight Zone sound. \nNANCY Okay? \nGLEN Okay, okay. (beat) I think. \nShe comes very close to him. \nNANCY You won't screw up, right?  I mean, a whole lot might depend on it. \nThe way she's looking at him gives him the creeps. \nGLEN Okay, I won't screw up. \n77.   Nancy takes a deep breath.  Then without another word turns off    77. the TV and the light. \nGLEN (IN DARK) Jesus, it's dark in here. \nNANCY Shhh.  Now listen, here's what we're gonna do... \n78.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          78. \nFADE UP ON NANCY, still in her pajamas, walking through the shadowy streets near her home, listening for the slightest sound.  We MOVE with her.  But nothing, not even the dog barking earlier, is there now.  NANCY peers into the darkness of lawns and trees behind her. \nNANCY (stage whisper) You still there? \nAcross the street and a distance away, GLEN steps from behind a tree. \nGLEN Yeah.  So? \nNANCY Just checking -- keep out of sight! \nGLEN throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of sight.  NANCY turns and looks down between the houses, deep into a dark alleyway.  Then she forces herself to walk into it. \n79.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               79. \nMOVING WITH HER as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into shadows.  Each time she pauses and waits, the MUSIC grows more threatening and expectant.  The feeling is of immense tension -- we're sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any second. \nBut he doesn't.  In fact absolutely nothing happens, and NANCY emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed.  The only thing strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to \n80.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      80. \nThe Police Station.  It takes her a little by surprise, it just seems to have appeared. \nMUSIC creeps into the NIGHTMARE THEME as NANCY whispers hoarsely back down the dark alley. \nNANCY (CONTD) Still there? \n81.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               81. \nWe only HEAR the DISTANT VOICE, slightly ECHOED. \nGLEN'S VOICE (OS) (yawning) Still here! \nNANCY On your toes, right? \nNANCY stares into the dark trying to see him, but she can't.  She turns back and makes up her mind to move without him in sight. \n82.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      82. \nMUSIC MOUNTS as we MOVE WITH NANCY across the lawns to the police station, creeping to the first lighted window she sees.  It's a low, barred basement window, and NANCY reacts as soon as she looks through it. \n83.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          83. \nNANCY'S POV down into ROD LANE's cell.  The boy is on his rough cot, twitching in disturbed sleep.  And a long SHADOW is sliding across the wall. \nA big SHAPE appears in the shadowed corridor outside the boy's cell, and as IT walks closer NANCY can barely see it's the shambling, grimly scarred man with the filthy red and yellow sweater and strange slouch hat pulled across his brow.  The KILLER from all of their nightmares. \nAnd this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the cell, like so much evil Jello.  Halfway through he pauses, turning to check over his shoulder.  We see the bars clearly penetrating his body, going in his head, passing out his ankles. Then he turns back to ROD and moves forward, and within another heartbeat is beside the boy. \n84.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      84. \nNANCY draws back sharply, swallowing in terror.  She looks behind her for help. \nNANCY (CONTD) Glen. \nNo answer. \nNANCY (CONTD) (louder) Glen?! \nThey lay ROD at NANCY's feet; a strange Pieta.  NANCY's father looks at her in spooked suspicion. \nLT THOMPSON How'd you know he was gonna do this? \nNANCY says nothing. \nFADE TO BLACK \n105.  EXT.  FOREST LAWN CEMETERY.  DAY.                                  105. \nBURN ON: \nTHE FOURTH DAY \nFADE UP ON a stark afternoon.  On a hill of sere grass overlooking the valley, the casket of ROD LANE is lowered into its grave. \nA small group of FAMILY and FRIENDS watches soberly as the MINISTER raises his hand in benediction. \nMINISTER Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God be with this young man's soul. \nON THE FACES of MARGE, LT THOMPSON, TINA'S MOTHER and ROD'S PARENTS.  Just for a second or two, in looks too rapid for an outsider to even notice, these adults exchange looks.  Furtive, quick glances that suggest an immense something that they all share, something beyond even this second death among their children.  Then they are all staring ahead again, as if the others weren't even there. \nMINISTER (CONTD OS) His life and his death attest to the Scripture's warning that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword. \nANGLE ON GLEN, watching -- \nNANCY, standing alone, not believing it for a minute. \nMINISTER (CONTD OS) But let us recall also our Lord's admonition that we 'Judge not, lest we be judged.'  Let us attempt only to love.  And may Rod Lane rest in peace. \nNANCY (quietly) Amen to that much. \nThe mourners walk away from the grave, MARGE among them.  She pauses near a MAN and two WOMEN in black -- TINA'S MOTHER, ROD'S PARENTS.  They almost, it seems, speak.  Then MARGE hurries on. \nWE MOVE WITH HER as she's joined by LT THOMPSON.  Both are worn and on edge.  THOMPSON absently lights another cigarette, offering one to MARGE. \nLT THOMPSON How's Nancy doing? \nMARGE I don't think she's slept since Tina died. (shakes her head) She's always been a delicate kid. \nTHOMPSON lights her cigarette, attempting some sort of nonchalance. \nLT THOMPSON She's tougher than you think. Any idea how she knew Rod was gonna kill himself? \nMARGE No.  All I know is, this reminds me too much of ten years ago. \nTHOMPSON blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks away. \nLT THOMPSON Yeah.  Well... Let's not start digging up bodies just because we're in a cemetery. \nHe gives her a look that could cut stone.  MARGE toses down her cigarete and crosses to NANCY.  The girl is simply staring off over the valley. \nMARGE (very gently) Time to go home, baby. \nShe moves her away from the brink of the hill. \n106.  EXT.  CEMETERY PARKING AREA.  DAY.                                 106. \nMARGE opens the door of the station wagon for NANCY.  NANCY turns to them both, speaking in a still, small voice. \nNANCY The killer's still loose, you know. \nShe has a wild, Cassandra aspect that sends a chill right up MARGE'S spine. \nLT THOMPSON You saying somebody else killed Tina?  Who? \nNANCY smiles a weird sort of smile. \nNANCY I don't know who he is.  But he's burned, he wears a weird hat, a red and yellow sweater, real dirty, and he uses some sort of knifes he's got made into a sort of... glove.  Like giant finger- nails. \nAs NANCY has described this monster from her dream, unseen by her, \tthe faces of MARGE LT and THOMPSON have drained completely of color. \nLT THOMPSON (low, even, to MARGE) I think you should keep Nancy at home a few days.  'Til she's really over the shock. \nMARGE I got something better... (to NANCY) I'm gonna get you help, baby. So no one will threaten you any more. \nShe takes the girl by the arm and guides her into the car, locking the door from outside.  NANCY never taking her eyes from her father's as the car bears her away. \nFADE TO BLACK \n111.  A MONTAGE OF SHOTS, of the EKG GRAPH, its inky needles calming,    111. of a METER tracing the quieting of NANCY's pulse, and of OTHER INSTRUMENTS, indicating life processes we can only guess.  All smoothing out. \n112.  CLOSE ON NANCY on TV MONITOR, asleep like the child she is.        112. Innocent. \nMARGE lights a cigarette, angry at her helplessness. \nMARGE What the hell are dreams, anyway? \nDR KING Mysteries.  Incredible body hookus pokus.  Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares... (leans closer) Did you know that in the last three years twenty Philipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died. \nHe gives a \"Ah don' know\" shrug.  MARGE looks out into the sleeping room.  NANCY is a motionless bundle in the middle of the bed. \n113.  ANGLE ON A NEEDLE on an EKG dipping to a lower reading.            113. \n114.  WIDER ANGLE -- the mother and DOCTOR watching.                     114. \nMARGE What happened?  That needle sank like a rock. \nDR KING (quietly) She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed.  All normal. She could dream at any time now. (beat) Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet.  Waiting to see what shows up. \n115.  INT.  THE SLEEPING ROOM.                                           115. \nWe can see NANCY drift from the initial stage, over the brink into deep sleep.  Her hair falls into her eyes; her face relaxes; her shoulders curl round her like comforters.  THE MUSIC DEEPENS, and begins to hint at the tones of the NIGHTMARE THEME. \n116.  INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.                                          116. \nDR KING and MARGE watch the instruments' every move. \nOne of the machines begins a slight CHIRPING.  KING scans it, liking what he sees. \nDR KING Okay, she's started to dream. \nHe leans forward in his chair, like a pilot starting an instrument approach.  MARGE THOMPSON licks her dry lips, fighting a turn of nausea. \nMARGE How can you tell? \nDR KING R.E.M.'s.  Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this -- \nHe prods a dial with his pencil and scribbles the time on a note pad. \nDR KING (CONTD) Beta Waves are slowing, too. She's dreaming, all right. A good one, too. \nMARGE watches the TV MONITOR.  It's in extra-close on NANCY's eyes -- and they're darting beneath the lids, reacting to events lost behind a skein of flesh and neurons. \nKING points to a moving graph.  A needle's begun waving lazily between plus and minus three.  The DOCTOR nods, assured. \nDR KING (CONTD) Typical dream parameter.  A nightmare, now, would be plus or minus five or six; she's just around three point -- \nHe stops.  Outside, visible through the glass, NANCY twists around.  Eyes still closed, she's nevertheless holding her head in the attitude of prey listening to the first faint sound of the predator's approach. \nMARGE looks from her daughter to the DOCTOR, color draining from her face. \nMARGE What the hell's this?  She awake or asleep? \nThe needle of the graph gives a jagged pitch up, plunges, then surges well above the eight mark.  A strange MUSIC CUE -- disonant and threatening, creeps in -- the NIGHTMARE THEME slurred into awful minors and weird disonance.  KING stares at the gauge in disbelief, rapping his finger on its glass. \nDR KING Can't be.  It never gets this high... \nThe needle swings even higher, benind. \nDR KING (CONTD) Jesus H. Christ. \nHe's cut off by the high-pitched KEENING of the girl, the SOUND cutting through the double thickness of the glass like a lasar. A warning BEEPER has begun, the instruments light up like a Christmas tree -- and outside in the sleeping room, NANCY is contorting as if shot through with a thousand volts.  KING knocks over his chair in his sprint for the door. \n117.  INT.  SLEEPING ROOM.                                               117. \nThe DOCTOR and MARGE come in on the run -- NANCY's flailing and screaming as if the devil himself were after her.  KING grabs her to shake her awake; \nANGLE ON NANCY (eyes open) -- looking in terror -- SOUND ECHOED STRANGELY. \nIN HER POV -- dressed in KING'S clothes -- the horribly scarred MAN reaches out. \nWIDER -- (NANCY'S eyes closed in sleep) as the girl's fist shoots out with incredible force and knocks DR KING flying! \nThe NURSE and MARGE both descend on her -- \nand again in her SLEEPING POV we see the MAN stagger for her. \nWIDER ON NANCY -- (still in her nightmare) -- fighting like a tiger with both MARGE and the NURSE -- sending the NURSE sprawling -- leaving MARGE hanging on for dear life. \n120.  Furious, NANCY janks open the drawer before MARGE can stop her     120. and spills the bottle and hat onto the counter. \nMARGE grabs away the bottle protectively -- but it's the hat NANCY goes for.  She waves it triumphantly -- demonically. \nNANCY It's real, Mamma.  Feel it. \nMARGE (horrified) Put that damned thing down! \nMARGE lunges for it -- NANCY leaps out of reach -- \nNANCY His name is even in it -- written right in here -- Fred Krueger -- Fred Krueger!  You know who that is, Mamma?  You better tell me, cause now he's after me! \nMARGE swallows, then persists in the lie. \nMARGE Nancy, trust your mother for once -- you'll feel better as soon as you sleep! \nNANCY shoots a hard humorless laugh, holding up her slashed arm. \nNANCY You call this feeling better? Or should I grab a bottle and veg out with you -- avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded -- \nMARGE slaps her hard. \nMARGE (losing it) Fred Krueger can't be after you, Nancy -- he's dead! \nThe room falls silent, both women staring at the other. \nMARGE (CONTD) (low, raw) Fred Krueger is dead.  Dead and gone.  Believe me, I know.  Now go to bed.  I order you, go to bed. \nMARGE snatches the hat away.  NANCY is furious, betrayed. \nNANCY You knew about him all this time, and you've been acting like he was someone I made up! \nMARGE pulls away. \nMARGE You're sick, Nancy.  Imagining things.  You need to sleep, it's as simple as that. \nNANCY wheels and smashes MARGE'S bottle of gin in the sink. \nNANCY Screw sleep! \nMARGE (CONTD) Nancy! \nBut NANCY runs past her mother for the front door. \nMARGE (CONTD) Nancy -- it's only a nightmare! \nNANCY turns in the doorway. \nNANCY That's enough! \nOn the door SLAM, we \nCUT TO \n121.  EXT.  SHAKESPEARE BRIDGE.  DAY.                                    121. \nANGLE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET.  We hear GLEN's VOICE and PAN UP to REVEAL NANCY and GLEN high above, two tiny figures walking across this strange white bridge in old Los Angeles.  CAMERA BEGINS A SLOW ZOOM. \nGLEN Whenever I get nervous I eat. \nNANCY And if you can't do that, you sleep. \nGLEN Used to.  Not anymore. \nGLEN jams more Big Mack into his face.  By now our ZOOM reveals he's attacking a huge bag of Big Macks, and furtively eyeing NANCY.  The girl's hair is startlingly white in the sunlight. She's reading a book, hardly paying attention. \nGLEN (CONTD) You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming? \nNANCY No. \nGLEN They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'.  So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right? \nNANCY Yeah. \nGLEN Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. (grins hopefully) They get all their art literature from dreams.  Just wake up and write it down.  Dreamskills. \nHe stops, seeing the look on NANCY's face.  Our ZOOM is much closer now, a wide medium, and still coming in on the kids. \nNANCY And what if they meet a monster in their dream?  Then what? \nMARGE gives a laugh -- a rasping chachination from deep in her chest. \nMARGE (CONTD) Your father the cop.  That's a good one. (colder) Forget Fred Krueger.  You don't want to know, believe me. \nNANCY I do want to know.  He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know! \nMARGE blinks at her a moment, then cracks a terrible, crooked grin. \nMARGE All right. \n126.  INT. NANCY'S CELLAR/NIGHT                                          126. \nMARGE drags NANCY headlong down the cellar stairs and across the room with a crazy fury, twisting her down near the foundation. And she thrusts her face so close to her daughter's that NANCY reels from the alcohol. \nMARGE You want to know who Fred Krueger was?  He was a filthy child killer who got at least twenty kids, kids from our area, kids we all knew.  It drove us all crazy when we didn't know who was doing it -- but it was even worse when they caught him. \nMARGE draws herself up with a shake. \nMARGE (CONTD) Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that. \nNANCY So he's alive? \nMARGE smiles grimly. \nMARGE He wouldn've stopped.  The bastard would've got more kids first chance he got -- they found nearly ten bodies in his boiler room as it was.  But the law couldn't touch him. \nAt the mention of \"boiler room\", NANCY gives a shake.  MARGE misses this, too busy taking a pull on the bottle that's never left her hand. \nMARGE (CONTD) What was needed were some private citizens willing to do what had to be done. \nShe reels slowly, looking at NANCY is defiance. \nNANCY (hushed) What did you do, mother? \nMARGE cradles the bottle. \nMARGE Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go.  Found him in an old boiler room, just like before.  Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side... \nNANCY (dreading it) Go on... \nMARGE reaches over and taps a dusty two-gallon jug of gasoline near the lawn mower. \nMARGE We poured gasoline all around the place, left a trail out the door, locked the door, then... \nShe mimes striking a match -- \nMARGE (CONTD) WHOOSH!!! \nHer arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that fire.  There's awe in her voice.  Then she drops her arms. \nMARGE (CONTD) (hushed, remembering) But just when it seemed not even the devil could live in there any more -- he crashed out like a banshee, all on fire -- swinging those fingerknives every which direction and screaming he... he was going to get us by killing all our kids... \nShe stops with a sudden quake and drinks for a long moment.  But the intake doesn't hide the image.  Her face bathed in tears, she looks at her daughter and shakes her head. \nMARGE (CONTD) There were all those men, Nancy, even your father, oh yes, even him.  But none could do what had to be done -- Krueger rolling and screaming so loud the whole state could hear -- no one could take your father's gun and kill him good and proper except me. \nShe sweeps her hand across the air in a terrific slash, then stops, her hand shaking, her voice hoarse and terrified.  She looks at her daughter, begging. \nMARGE (CONTD) So he's dead Nan.  He can't get you.  Mommy killed him. \nFor someone who started this film at a very young seventeen, NANCY's now the battle-tempered veteran as she takes her mother in her arms and rocks her. \nNANCY Who was there?  Were Tina's parents there?  Were Rod's? \nMARGE sags back. \nMARGE Sure, and Glen's.  All of us. But that's in the past now, baby.  Really.  It's over. (slyly) We even took his knives. \nThe woman twists around and opens the door on an old furnace -- a furnace unused since the newer gas one nearby was put in.  She fishes inside the cavity -- as then we hear a touch of the familiar 'SCRRIITCH'.  Next moment she pulls out an object wrapped in rags, opens it and displays the long, rusted blades and their glove-like apparatus. \nMARGE (CONTD) See? \nNANCY stares at the damn things, chilled. \nNANCY All these years you've kept those things buried down here?  In our own house? \nMARGE (CONTD) Proof he's declawed.  As for him, we buried him good and deep. \nMARGE shoves the knives into their hiding place, closes the little iron door. \n130.

The moon is above the horizon.  A cool wind slides a bank of white fog inland.  The valley and its lights stretch forever, an endless net of illumination and darkness.  A coyote HOWLS on the dark hill. \n132.  EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      132. \nA palm frond scuttles across the center of the parking lot.  LT THOMPSON arrives in an unmarked car. \nCOP (passing) Lieutenant Thompson -- what you doing in at this time? \nLT THOMPSON Can't sleep, thought I'd come break up the poker game. \nThe COP laughs and goes his way.  THOMPSON's smile evaporates. \n133.  INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      133. \nTHOMPSON enters and checks the log.  Nearby, SGT GARCIA pours coffee. \nSERGEANT GARCIA If it was any more quiet we could hear owls farting. \nLT THOMPSON Is quiet, isn't it? \nSERGEANT GARCIA (too casually) How's your girl? \nTHOMPSON looks at the Desk sergeant a moment, then tosses down the log. \nLT THOMPSON She's sensible.  She'll sleep sooner or later. \n134.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          134. \nThe neighborhood is utterly still, most of the homes already dark.  But not NANCY's.  Or GLEN's. \nZOOM TO GLEN'S LIGHTED LIVING ROOM WINDOW. \n135.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  135. \nGLEN's father watches eleven o'clocks news, a dreary FILM CLIP (STOCK) of war and refugees in a far-away land. \nMR LANTZ takes a pull on his Bud. \nMR LANTZ You'd think they'd have some- thing 'bout the Lane kid hanging himself. \nMRS LANTZ walks through the room, drying her hands on a dishtowel. \nMRS LANTZ Maybe we're all making more out of it than we should. \nShe heads upstairs.  MR LANTZ pops the automatic tuner.  CARSON blinks ON. \nCARSON (TV) I wouldn't touch that line with a ten foot pole. \nED MCMAHON and the AUDIENCE laugh in delight. \n136.  INT.  GLEN'S HOUSE/UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR.  NIGHT.                      136. \nMRS LANTZ comes along the upstairs hall and knocks gently at a closed door. \nMRS LANTZ Glen?  you all right? \nShe puts her ear to the door and listens. \nMRS LANTZ (CONTD) Glen honey? \nNo answer. \n137.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         137. \nGLEN lies sprawled across the bed, long legs flung over the end, head not visible. \nHis mother enters.  She looks at the boy, turns off the TV. Looks at him again. From this angle she can see his head, earphones crammed over it rasping their tinny noise.  But no movement from the kid at all. MRS LANTZ crosses and pokes him in the ribs.  GLEN lurches up, arms windmilling. \nGLEN Whuu? \nHe refocuses his eyes, takes off his earphones. \nMRS LANTZ How can you listen to Carson and a record at the same time? \nGLEN swings his legs over the edge of the bed and shakes his head to clear the cobwebs. \nMR LANTZ Know what I think?  I think that kid's some kinda lunatic. \nThe woman spoons more sweetness into her mouth and rubs her forehead. \nMRS LANTZ Shouldn't say such a thing about the poor child.  If you mean the bars, Marge's just being cautious, her being alone and Nancy acting so nervous lately. \nThe woman rises and pulls him gently towards the living room.  As he goes inside he takes one last look. \nMR LANTZ (CONTD) Well, she ain't gonna hang around our boy no more. \nOnce the two are inside, the door is locked. \n148.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        148. \nCLOSE ON NANCY's face.  VERY CLOSE.  Her eyes stare ahead, red-rimmed, anxious.  She picks absently at the thick bandage covering her forearm.  The long cuts from Fred Krueger's fingers are bleeding again, but she doesn't even care anymore.  Too late to sweat the small stuff.  She crosses the room. \nOn the bedside table with the nearly empty Pyrex coffee maker, the empty cup and the empty box of No-Doz, is her old fashioned alarm clock, and a phone. \nNANCY pours herself the last of the coffee and drinks it to the dregs, then looks to the clock. \nINSERT CLOCK -- ten minutes to midnight. \nNANCY'S eyes go to the door. \nWIDER.  Fully clothed and in a jacket now, she creeps to the door and cracks it, just to make sure.  Then freezes. \n149.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE NANCY'S DOOR.                                149. \nIN NANCY'S POV through the door we see MARGE, rummaging around in the linen closet not fifteen feet away.  There's no way NANCY can get past her.  The woman pulls out a full bottle of gin in satisfaction and begins fumbling with its cap. \n150.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        150. \nNANCY eases the door closed again and sinks to the key hole, watching through it with a sinking heart. \nNANCY (very quiet, very intense) Hang on GLEN... \n151.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         151. \nGLEN, coat now on, goes to his window, checking. \n152.  INT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          152. \nGLEN'S POV -- NANCY'S porch is deserted; front door closed, lights out.  No sign of NANCY. \n153.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         153. \nGLEN shrugs, takes off his jacket and plops back onto his bed. \nGLEN Well, I'm not gonna risk sneaking out until she does. \nHe puts the earphones back on. \n154.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        154. \nAbsolutely frustrated, NANCY turns from the keyhole to the window. She opens the blind and eases back the curtain. \n155.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT. \nIN NANCY'S POV THROUGH THE BARS we ZOOM directly across to GLEN's window. \n156.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         156. \nGLEN lies on his bed, fully clothed, earphones over his ears, CARSON droning from the TV.  And the boy's eyes begin to droop. \n157.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     157. \nNANCY picks up her phone, bites her lip, then begins dialing. \n158.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         158. \nTIGHT ON PHONE as it begins RINGING loudly. \nWIDER SHOT, revealing GLEN asleep BACKGROUND, the MUSIC still LOUD in his earphones. \n159.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  159. \nRINGING here, too, just as MR LANTZ is turning out the lights for bed.  He stops in the dark, scowling. \nMR LANTZ Who at this hour? \nShe races to a porch window and throws it open, shaking and banging on the bars like a mad woman.  But there's no getting through.  She staggers back, stymied and furious.  Then somebody moves behind her in the dark. \nVOICE (OS) Locked. \nNANCY jumps around in shock.  Her mother has posted herself on the couch with her bottle. \nNANCY (furious) Give me the key, mother. \nMARGE I don't even have it on me, so forget it. \nThe word is final.  NANCY runs past the woman to the back door, to one window after the other, shaking bars and slamming locks and SCREAMING in teenage fury.  But it's no good.  The house is her prison. \nMARGE (CONTD) (drunk satisfaction) Paid the guy damn good to make sure you stayed put.  You ain't goin' nowhere, kid.  You're gonna sleep tonight if it kills me. \nNANCY clenches her fists and screams at the top of her lungs, a heart-wrenching, eardrum-breaking cry of love in despair -- \nNANCY GLEEENNNNNN! \nSMASH CUT TO: \n164.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         164. \nCLOSE ON GLEN'S FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE.  The MUSIC is tinny from the earphones, the TV SOUND DISTANT AND ECHOED.  The boy is breathing deeply now, slowly and gently.  Then, unmistakeably, he begins to SNORE.  Very faintly, far in the background, we can hear NANCY. \nNANCY (OS) Glen!!  Don't fall asleeeeeep! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK AND STRAIGHT UP as the SNORES merge with a weird, unsettling MUSIC CUE.  The boy lies sprawled, still clothed, in the middle of his bed.  Save for the bedside lamp, the room is dark. \nFULL WIDE ANGLE FROM THIS HIGH SPOT looking down at him as from the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling.  THE MUSIC REACHES A TERRIFYING PITCH OF ANTICIPATION -- THEN STOPS ABRUPTLY. \nThere's a heartbeat's pause.  Then with tremendous force, two powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and grab GLEN around the waist! \nNext moment the young man's body is dragged straight down into the bed, as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him down!  His feet and his arms shoot up -- there's another hauling yank -- and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers -- down into the pit in the middle of the bed!  His hands are last to go, clawing for a hold.  But soon they vanish as well, dragging blankets and bedsheets, wires and stereo across the caved-in bed and into the abyss. \nThere's HIDEOUS SCREECHING of MUSIC jamming in with GLEN's ECHOING SCREAMS -- then an unholy, sudden silence. \nNext moment what's left of GLEN is vomited up from the pit of the nightmare bed...a horrible mess of blood and bone and hair and wires...streaming out and over the bed.  Then the pit in the bed is gone as if it were never there. \nDrawn by the terribly screams and struggle, GLEN's mother bursts into the room.  The women stares for one moment of horrified disbelief, then reels back and lets out the most god-awful SCREAM imaginable.  The cry splits the night. \n165.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          165. \nThe SOUND of the SCREAM CROSS-FADES WITH the WAIL of the AMBULANCE as it screeches to a halt at the curb, followed by two BLACK AND WHITES and an UNMARKED CAR.  Uniformed POLICEMEN spill out FOREGROUND. \nLT THOMPSON and PARKER exit the unmarked car.  By habit or by premonition THOMPSON glances at the house that was his home.  His eye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs window, white-haired, hollow-eyed, looking down on him through her bars.  She gives a little wave. \nUnnerved, THOMPSON waves back, then walks rapidly for GLEN's home.  MR LANTZ, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we can hear the mother's WAILING inside. \n166.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        166. \nCLOSE ON NANCY'S BIG OLD WINDUP ALARM CLOCK.  Its big and little hands sweep together at midnight. \nBURN ON: \nTHE NINTH DAY \nThere's a BABBLE of POLICE RADIOS, SIRENS WINDING DOWN, RUNNING FOOT-STEPS, SHOUTS, NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS and DOGS BARKING as CAMERA LIFTS TO NANCY'S FACE.  Set.  Unafraid.  Ruthless. \nThe girl pulls the window shade on it all, then looks at her bed. \nNANCY Okay, Krueger, you bastard. We play in your court. \n167.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM/NANCY'S KITCHEN -- INTERCUT.  NIGHT.      167. \n168.  LT THOMPSON is halfway across the living room when he stops.       168. Something dark and red is welling from a crack in the ceiling. One of his men is rigging a bucket beneah to catch the leaking. The telephone rings and PARKER picks it up. \nPARKER Lieutenant.  It's your daughter. Says it's urgent. \nTHOMPSON turns away from the dripping. \nLT THOMPSON (low) Tell her I'm not here, tell her... \nPARKER Uh, she just saw you, sir... \nTHOMPSON nods, crosses and picks up the telephone.  SCREEN SPLITS; we see both. \nLT THOMPSON (CONTD) Hello Nancy. \nNANCY Hi daddy.  I know what happened. \nThe CORONER gives a sweaty, grim smile. \nCORONER (CONTD) Only place I ever heard of such a thing before was ten years ago.  Remember that fucker Fred Krueger? \nLT THOMPSON has just knocked PARKER sprawling in his race to the stairs. \nPARKER Hey -- your daughter's acting kinda -- ! (THOMPSON'S gone) Strange... \n201.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        201. \nCRASH as NANCY breaks another window and presses against the bars.  The house shudders and glows orange behind her.  She sees her father bursting out the front door of Glen's house! \nNANCY DAD!  GET US OUTTA HERE! \nLT THOMPSON Oh, Jesus -- Nancy! (to his men) Hey!  We got a fire! \n202.  ANGLE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR.  Many MEN batter the door down as     202. black smoke pours from the windows and NANCY's SCREAMS and SHOUTS fill the air.  Within moments they've destroyed the door and LT THOMPSON has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms. But NANCY immediately fights free and darts right back to the front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild woman. \nNANCY I got him -- I got Fred Krueger! \nTHOMPSON stares at his wild little girl in astonishment, then runs in after her.  The others follow, coughing and choking. \n203.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         203. \nTHOMPSON collides with NANCY as she brakes, frozen.  THE SMOKE IS BELCHING OUT OF THE CELLAR, but whoever was locked in there certainly isn't now.  The door is flat on the kitchen floor. \nLT THOMPSON What the hell are you talking about, Nancy? \nNANCY wheels without answering.  A series of tiny, isolated fires burn across the living room and up the stairs.  Firesteps. \nNANCY (CONTD) He's after Mom!  Come on! \nShe darts across the living room, following the flaming footprints of FRED KRUEGER up the stairs before THOMPSON can stop her. \nLT THOMPSON NANCY! \n204.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     204. \nNANCY STOPS IN THE SPLINTERED DOORWAY -- a ragged gold-red light splashing her horrified face. \n205.  REVERSE IN HER POV -- FRED KRUEGER, literally a man of fire, has   205. a screaming MARGE pinned to the bed and is crawling all over her!  NANCY gives a banshee's howl, snatches up a chair and brings it down over the back of the firey beast, stunning him. \nBy the time LT THOMPSON races into the room NANCY'S seized a heavy blanket has thrown over both of them, fighting the flames. The father joins his daughter without a second thought, heaving another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the flames. \nNANCY He's under there!  Watch it! \n206.  THOMPSON pushes the girl back -- yanks out his .38 and pulls off   206. the first cover.  No movement.  He pulls back a second one, ready to fire.  But the only thing he sees is the blackened half-skeleton of his ex-wife, smoking and seething and sinking into the fluid-like mattress, sinking right down through it as if she were sinking into a lake.  A blackened, gnarled hand goes last, then the bed solidifies over the place she's disappeared. And it's as if no one was ever there. \nNANCY turns and looks at LT THOMPSON, her face white as her ghostly hair.  THOMPSON shoves his .38 back in its holster and finds a cigarette, his hands shaking so badly he can barely manage. \nNANCY Now do you believe me? \nPARKER barges in.  The room is filled with smoke, the bed is stripped, but other than that, the place seems normal. \nPARKER You find him? (looking closer at THOMPSON) Sir? \nLT THOMPSON just walks by him.  PARKER chases after. \nPARKER (CONTD OS) (fading) Sir -- here, let me light that for you -- Lieutenant?  What happened? (gone) \nWIDER, ON NANCY alone in the room.  She turns and looks at the bed.  MUSIC slips in and builds.  The bed has changed color. It's now an ash-darkened red and yellow. \n207.  CLOSER ON NANCY from the direction of the bed.  MUSIC SUDDENLY     207. STOPS, and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in its center that keeps raising, raising until it's a hump that's a head and shoulders, still raising until it looms over NANCY. \nThen FRED KRUEGER's entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and red mass -- and the garish head, smoking and seething, pops through. \nNEW ANGLE -- KRUEGER, a burned, sizzling black hump of a killer, clumps onto the floor between NANCY and the door. \nNANCY falls absoltely still, and her face goes through a strange, almost sublime transformation. \nNANCY (quietly) I know you're there, Krueger. \nShe turns and faces him. \nFREDDIE You think you was gonna get away from me? \nNANCY shakes her head. \nNANCY I know you too well now, Freddie. \n", "test1_input": "NANCY darts into her unlit bedroom, slams the door and locks it. \nSafe at last. \nShe listens at the door.  Nothing.  She crosses to her bed.  Next second the KILLER dives through her window and seizes her in a shower of shattered glass! \nNANCY twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat. \nThe two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing onto NANCY's bed.  Her grip is broken -- the MAN stabs -- NANCY twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls.  Defenseless, she snatches a pillow up; the KILLER lashes out -- disemboweling the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying.  NANCY dives for escape in a virtual blizzard. \nThe KILLER manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers. \nANGLE AT FLOOR LEVEL -- CLOSE ON NANCY'S AND THE KILLER'S HEADS. The blades inch towards the girl's face -- the drool of the grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her eyes.  Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane! \nBut just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to NANCY's head goes off with a jarring RINGGGGGGG! \n96.   Instantly the MUSIC STOPS.  And a moment later the room is         96. light. \nWIDER as NANCY reels up, blinded by the sudden light, SCREAMING AND FIGHTING on her bed. \nANGLE ON GLEN, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening noise.  He discovers NANCY pressed in terror against her headboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a straw. \nIt's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight. \nNANCY stares incredulously at GLEN, then around the room, untangling herself from her bedclothes.  Wary and furious, her voice hoarse. \nNANCY Glen, you bastard... \nThe boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm.  She's absolutely livid, more angry than he's ever seen her, and more strange. \nGLEN What I do? \nHe reaches for her -- she flattens against the wall, eyes hard, and terribly hurt, too. \nNANCY (low) I asked you to do just one thing. Just stay awake and watch me -- Just wake me if it looked like I was having a bad dream. (eyes wild) But you.  You shit -- what do you do -- you fall asleep! \nShe stops herself, wiping a bit of spittle off her lip, alarmed at how out of control she's become.  And suddenly she breaks, sinking into her \ttorn bedclothes and rubbing her head. \nNANCY (CONTD) (mostly to herself) I must be going nuts... \nMARGE (OS) Nancy? \nHer mother's door opens OS. \nGLEN Oh, shit. \nNANCY composes her voice as best she can. \nNANCY Yes, mother? \nMARGE's flip-flops approach outside the door.  GLEN barrels out the window -- NANCY dives for the bed, jams off the light and disappears under the covers.  MARGE, bleary eyed herself, opens the door and flicks on the light. \nMARGE (beat) You okay? \nNANCY (weakly) Yeah.  Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep. \nMARGE (beat) Okay... You need anything, just call. \nNANCY Okay. \nMARGE closes the door.  NANCY immediately sits up and looks at the window.  A single bone-white feather floats down in the moonlight.  Then it's sucked outside and is gone. \n97.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      97. \nGLEN's CADILLAC CONVERTABLE careens into the parking lot and SCREECHES to a stop.  GLEN and NANCY jump out and head for the station. \nGLEN You mind telling me what's going on? \nNANCY's races into the station without answering. \nGLEN (CONTD) Oh, I see.  That makes it all perfectly clear. \n98.   INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      98. \nNANCY goes straight to the SERGEANT's desk. \nNANCY Garcia, I want to see Rod Lane again. \nGARCIA winces. \n", "test1_true": "NANCY It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod. \nSGT GARCIA It's three in the morning. Your mother know you're out this late? \nNANCY (faking it) Of course -- look, at least go back and look at him.  Just see if he's okay. \nGARCIA glances at GLEN. \nGLEN (faking it) We have reason to think there might be something weird going on. \nLT THOMPSON (OS) Oh, no argument on that. \nNANCY jumps around at the sound of her father's voice.  LT THOMPSON emerges from his office, rumpled and yawning. \nNANCY Dad -- what you doing here? \nLT THOMPSON It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder.  I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour?  You're supposed to be getting some sleep. \nGLEN Listen, sir, this is serious. Nancy had a nightmare about Rod being in danger, or something, and so she thinks... \nHe trails off, loosing it under LT THOMPSON's glare.  Besides, he doesn't know exactly what the hell's really going on himself. GARCIA puts his beefy hand on NANCY's shoulder. \nNANCY I just want to see if he's okay! \nSGT GARCIA Take my word for it, Nancy.  The guy's sleeping like a baby.  He's not going anywhere. \n99.   INT.  CELL BLOCK.  NIGHT.                                          99. \nANGLE ON ROD in his cell.  He's asleep, all right, but not safely so.  His bedsheet has come alive.  It twitches, pulsates, then snakes towards his throat. \nROD stirs, the sheet falls still; ROD slips into deeper sleep, and the sheet moves again, completing the noose around his neck! \n100.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        100. \nNANCY makes a move for the cell block -- \nNANCY This isn't your average nightmare, Daddy -- damn it! \nThe door's locked; she hauls on it in desperation. \nLT THOMPSON Now look, Nancy, don't push it.  You've already rubbed my nose in sex, drugs and violence -- don't start throwing in insanity! \nNANCY takes that one to heart.  She wheels on him and pleads, her intensity sobering even to him. \nNANCY Just go back and check -- please! \nThe man takes a beat, then shrugs and nods towards SGT GARCIA. \nLT THOMPSON Okay, Garcia.  What the hell. \nSGT GARCIA Right... (feeling in his pockets) Now where'd I put the key... \nHe mumbles backs towards his desk.  MUSIC BUILDS as we HOLD ON NANCY'S FACE. \n101.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          101. \nWith a terrible SNAP ROD's sheet jerks tight around his neck. The startled teenager is hauled upright -- eyes popping, face purple.  He claws at the sheet, but despite his strength he can't get his fingers between the noose and his windpipe.  He's dragged backwards across the cot. \n102.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        102. \nGARCIA finally has the keys.  Urged on by NANCY he fumbles with the lock. \n103.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          103. \nROD'S being dragged backwards, gasping and struggling in vain against the powerful pull -- right across his cell and up the wall, too.  He clutches blindly at his throat at the far end of the sheet coils around the bars of the high window.  Then there's a powerful wrench of the sheet, and ROD'S neck SNAPS.  The kid's body sags lifeless. \n104.  ANGLE THROUGH THE BARS as NANY, GLEN, LT THOMPSON and GARCIA       104. appear in the corridor outside, the girl sprinting ahead. \nNANCY Rod! \nBut it's too late; NANCY sinks back in horror as her father and GARCIA rush into the cell. \nLT THOMPSON Gimme a hand, dammit! \nGLEN, pale as the sheet that's killed ROD, climbs to the bars and unties the knot.

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS, NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                           180. \nLOW ANGLE UP STAIRS as NANCY appears at head.

NIGHT.                                      180A. \nNANCY appears at top of these stairs, hesitates, then comes down. \nWIDER as NANCY approaches center of room, stops in CU, then turns eyes.  We HEAR the distant SOUND of the boiler room now, faint but unmistakeable.  NANCY MOVES, and CAMERA PANS HER to the cellar's side WALL, where another, new doorway is REVEALED. NANCY opens this door and looks down.  FIRELIGHT is on NANCY'S face now, and the SOUND of the Boiler Room is very clear.  NANCY goes through the door. \n180B. INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 180B. \nNANCY decends like Orpheus into hell, but without weapon save her wits. \nShe decends a steel stair to the lowest level, then hears the SOUND of the knives from down another shaft.  She sees there's an even deeper place down there.  She starts down. \nAgain, and then again, NANCY decends, each ladder narrower or more twisting, each level deeper, wetter, darker, more airless. Soon she's gasping for air, but still she pushes herself on. She doesn't stop until she breaks out at last at the very bottom of the place, a wet, firelit sump deep in the bowels of the place. \nCAMERA NOW PANS AROUND WITH HER, and for the first time we SEE the vast maul of the empty boiler behind her. \nShe stares at it.  It's seething with some dark WIND that soughs and whines like a huge dying dog. \nNANCY crosses to it, touching the pile of old, coal-dusted dirt at its base.  It looks almost like an old grave. \nShe turns suddenly, listening.  Then, hearing nothing, she looks down. \nNANCY'S POV as she picks up GLEN's earphones. \nWIDER as she suddenly drops them, staring at her fingers. They're dripping blood. \nThere's another BEEP. \n180C. INSERT ON NANCY'S WATCH -- the COUNT-DOWN a blur of black digits   180C. counting down to zero.  They've just crossed the ten minute warning. \n180D. CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She speaks into the night.                 180D. \nNANCY (quietly) Come out and show yourself, you bastard. \nNo sooner are these words off her lips than the huge bulk of FRED KRUEGER lurches up behind her!  The man is even more hideous hatless, his bald head and tormented face veiled in skeins of ruined flesh, his ragged teeth barred, the great spider of razor-blades flashing from his fingertips. \nHe leaps, but the girl leaps just as fast, a fierce jump, that sends her out over black space and down into a huge, dark sump of blackness. \n180E.

NIGHT.                                         180E. \nCLOSE ANGLE ON NANCY as she curves like a swan though her apogee, and begins falling, diving, planing through black air, the wind ripping at her hair and eyes.  Suddenly the complex, glittering skein of light that is the San Fernando Valley seen from the air slides INTO FRAME, and we see she's falling from high, high over the earth. \nNANCY falls, falls in slow motion against the spinning lights, free as a sky diver freefalling -- a giddy, acrophobic plunge. \n181,182,183,184 OMIT                                    OMIT 181,182,183,184 \n185.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                            185. \nNANCY crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just outside her own front door, rolling out at its bottom scratched and bloodied.  If she were in any normal reality she'd be a mass of broken bones -- but somehow she's able to claw her way up and look at her watch once more. \nINSERT.  Just a few seconds from zero. \nShe staggers for her house's front door -- but a moment later KRUEGER crashes down atop her!  NANCY struggles to her knees just as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades.  But instead of running, she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes him in a desperate bearhug! \nThe surprise move sends him pitching backwards, her still on him --and they fall into the jumble of torn-down trellis of roses beneath her window.  Almost at that very second we HEAR the jarring, deafening RINGING of NANCY's alarm clock! \nSMASH CUT TO: \n186.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     186. \nNANCY sprawls out of her bed onto the floor, twisting from the jabs of the already vanished thorns, briars and brush.

She sits on the bed, turns on the bedside lamp and re-examines her room.  No one there but herself. \nIt's a terrible blow, despite the fact that she's safe.  Her face is covered with tears, she's shaking and breathless.  She rattles her head in confusion and despair, realizing her own madness. \nNANCY I'm crazy after all... \nAt that very instant FRED KRUEGER leaps up from the far side of the bed with an EXPLOSIVE SHOUT of rage! \nHe lunges across the table for her, missing by inches as NANCY pitches backwards and scrambles for the window.  But she's stopped by the bars. \nKRUEGER, incredibly fast, regains his feet and leaps again -- the girl wheels and shatters the coffeepot over his head.

NIGHT.                                             187. \nMARGE, knocked flying by NANCY'S charge, hits the floor hard, knocking the wind out of herself.  NANCY sees what she's done, jumps over the body and slams the door and throws the new bolt home.  Next instant she gingerly ties a string to the door's knob, a string that trails down from the ceiling, attached to something up there that's still just barely out of sight. \nNext instant she's dragging her MOTHER towards the woman's bedroom as fast as she can. \nKRUEGER is already splintering the doorway behind her as NANCY dips and makes it into MARGE's room, SLAMMING the DOOR behind her and locking it in a flash. \nThe MANIAC breaks the bolt and rips open the door. \nBut the in the very act of doing this he of course unknowingly pulls the string attached to the outside doorknob with terrific force. \nCLOSE ANGLE ON THE CEILING.  The string jerks against a single-edged razor, which in turn cuts a tight wind of cord holding a heavy wedge of steel to the ceiling. \nWIDER as the thing falls free, pivoting at the hinge at the far end of its handle, and drives straight into KRUEGER'S groin with a terrific blow.  As he catapaults backwards with an incredulous shriek, the twenty pound sledge hammer swings back and reveals to camera just what it is! \nANGLE DOWN ON KRUEGER, clawwing his way up despite his agony, lurching and cursing forward like an enraged bull. \nWIDER ANGLE IN THE HALLWAY as KRUEGER roars out -- only to immediately strike the length of WIRE strung across the hallway, catching it just above the thigh.  He cartwheels head-over-heels and lands flat on his back! \nInstantly the DOOR to NANCY's MOTHER's bedroom flies open and NANCY brings a brass lamp down over KRUEGER's head with all her might!  It sounds like a line-drive caroming off a metal flagpole. \nNANCY SLAMS the DOOR as KRUEGER struggles up, clutching his head. \nEnraged, the huge man CRASHES against the door with terrific force, and rears back and starts smashing against the door like the utter homicidal lunatic that he is. \nCUT TO: \n188.

The AMBULANCE is pulling away with a tremendous WAIL of its SIREN as NANCY SCREAMS down, trying to make herself heard. \nNANCY Help!  Hey -- Daddy -- I got him trapped!  Where are you!? \n189.  ANGLE ON the street.  PARKER, assigned to guard the house, sees    189. NANCY -- hair white, eyes wide -- pounding on the bars and screaming like a lunatic.  But her meaning is utterly lost in the noise of the ambulance next to him. \nPARKER (yelling up at her) Everything's going to be all right!  Everything's under control! \nANGLE at the window.  Close on NANCY's face, incredulous at his response. \nNANCY Get my father, you asshole! \nPARKER does a little take.  That almost sounded sane. \nPARKER (OS) You heard what I said!  Now get back inside or I'll tell your dad! \n191.  Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS.  NANCY whirls around just in time   191. to see KRUEGER bull in!  NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped against the bars and has nowhere to go.  The man bunches his knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing.  NANCY closes her eyes -- \nThen from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two. \nMARGE No! \nShe blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives. Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars behind. Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand, keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter! \nMARGE Nancy -- for god's sake's run! \nBut NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father. \nNANCY Daddy!  Where are you! \n192.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          192. \nPARKER, just about to turn back to the business at GLEN's house, sees NANCY and SOMEONE else fall just inside the window. Something begins to dawn on the man.  Just a little. \nPARKER Poor woman's got her hands full with that kid.  Maybe I better tell the lieutenant. \nHe turns and jogs towards GLEN's house. \n", "test3_true": "ANGLE ON KRUEGER, hauling MARGE up in rage, knocking her senseless across her bed and climbing after her with his knives raised.

She flips the monster the bird, her eyes wild with pain and fury. \nNANCY Hey fuckface -- can't catch me! \nThe bait works -- KRUEGER leaves MARGE and howls after NANCY. \n194.  INT.

The man lies in a smoking heap.  NANCY runs to the windows and screams out again. \nNANCY (CONTD) Hey -- Daddy!  Hey!  I got the bastard! \nKRUEGER roars up behind her -- she throws herself sideways -- he crashes into the window frame, smashing glass and wood to bits. \nNANCY turns SCREAMING and runs deeper into the house. \n196.

Before the man can realize what she's up to, she ignites the whole box and throws it in KRUEGER's face. \nThere's a blinding WHOOSH -- and KRUEGER goes up in a terrific BALL OF FIRE.

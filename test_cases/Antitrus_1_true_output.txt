MILO He's working backwards, too. (to Lisa) Let's do number five? 
LISA Longitude 66. 
Milo types. 
INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS 
Gunther and Riman rip down the barricade, reach the door. They whip it open, guns drawn. They see: 
An empty supply room. [The barricade was a decoy.] 
INT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The Rent-A-Guard has joined Milo et al in here. He tries to slide a heavy shelf in front of the door, but it's not yet in place. Lisa has dialed 911. She's scared. 
LISA Come now. They've got guns! 
OS, we can hear Gunther and Riman pounding at the door. 
GUNTHER (O.S.) Open the door, Milo! 
BRIAN (to Milo) You there yet? 
MILO (typing) One more second. 
He hits enter. The door is kicked open. Gunther & Riman enter, Gunther with a gun, Riman still carrying the light stand. 
He immediately bashes the KNQR computer with it. Lisa looks devastated. 
BRIAN Hey, hey, relax, relax! 
He holds up the computer cable, to show Riman it was never plugged in, anyway. 
LISA Oh my God. 
BRIAN (to Gunther) Should I call Phil? Or do you? 
Gunther knits his brow. He notices Milo: still staring at the TV screens. 
BRIAN Milo? Wake up. Our regular programming will not be preempted tonight. 
Milo's gaze stays fixed to the screens. Riman grabs him by the shirt. But Gunther's concerned by Milo's behavior: 
GUNTHER (staring at Milo) Wait. 
As Milo watches the screens, a pixilated, ghostly image begins to appear on all of them: the animated Skywire logo (lightning strike, etc.). 
Brian lurches across to the laptop, ejects the CD-ROM. It's beige-colored, says Outpost Word. 
BRIAN ...When did you know? 
MILO (still watching the screens) You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects. 
LISA Milo? Who's got Skywire? 
INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Gary and Phil watch as the Skywire logo gets steadily stronger on Gary's TV's. Phil is confounded: 
PHIL If Milo didn't launch Skywire, who did? 
We hear a low steady hum. 
CUT TO: 
A CABLE plugged into a dusty wall-port that doesn't even have a plate on it. Panning along the cable, we widen to show: 
INT. UNFINISHED STUDIO (#21) - CONTINUOUS 
In dim construction light, not far from the Sears generator, Len sits on the concrete floor. The second data tower is patched into a laptop. The distinct silver jewelcase lies by the CD-rom drive. Shrot paces: 
SHROT Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit! 
LEN I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite. 
CUT TO: 
FOUR TV SETS 
Each shows the standard Outpost desktop: Outpost logo, fonts, colors. [This is the all-purpose interface Lisa created for to Milo.] A window at the top shows a succession of Obituaries with photos Lisa has downloaded from newspapers: "Programmer Dies in Highway Crash;" "Programmer Among Cult Suicides;" "Programmer Victim of Racial Killing," etc.) The obituaries -- eight of them -- fade up and down in a continuous cycle. Meantime: 
Lower on the screen, the material from the day-care data tower appears, following the same succession we saw when Milo brought up Teddy's data, i.e., footage of a young Programmer at college, surveillance footage of him typing away (from behind), medical records that describe his vulnerability or a crime primer that describes his scenario. Between the obits and the primers, cause and effect is (eventually) established. 
The crowning note is the audio, Gary in VOICE OVER, gleaned (by Lisa) from the audio version of his own book: 
GARY'S VOICE OVER Most of us who write software achieve our greatest work before age 30. As I grow older I know how important it is to access fertile young minds! 
REVERSE ON 
Gary watching.

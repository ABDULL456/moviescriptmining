The warm-up man starts the applause. 
TALKBACK V/O ....three, two, one... 
Cheering and music. Prem switches on his charm. 
PREM Welcome back to Who Wants to be a Millionaire! Our contestant, Jamal Malik, Call Centre Assistant- from Mumbai, is on sixteen thousand rupees and has already used one lifeline: Ask the Audience. So, my friend: are you ready for the next question? 
JAMAL Yes. 
PREM Then, let's play. 
Portentous music. The lights dim. 
PREM (CONT'D) For sixty-four thousand rupees. The British architect Frederick Stevens designed which famous building in India? Is it: A) The Taj Mahal. B) Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. C) India Gate. D) Howrah Bridge. What do you think, Jamal? Are you one of those tea-boys with a penchant for architecture? 
41   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   41 
Known to everyone as VT station, this monument to Victorian railway architecture is a dangerous place to be at rush hour.

41   CONTINUED:                                                  41 
Even before the train has stopped, men are jumping from the open doors, or vaulting out of the windows or from the roof of the train to join the tens of thousands of Mumbaites streaming to and from work. A seventeen-year old Jamal squeezes himself out of a train and shoves through the crowds. He checks the time. The digital numerals flick to five O'clock. Looks around the tide of humanity. 
42   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         42 
PREM So, what's it to be? Walk away and this cheque for sixteen thousand rupees is yours. Look, it's even got your name on it. 
He produces a cheque and waves it at Jamal. 
JAMAL I don't have a bank account. 
Laughter from the audience. Prem is momentarily wrong- footed. 
JAMAL (CONT'D) But I'll take cash. 
More laughter, this time with Jamal, rather than at him. Prem gets up and starts rummaging theatrically through his jacket pockets and trousers. 
PREM Nope. Looks like the Producer's stolen my wallet again- 
JAMAL - I'll play. 
Nobody was expecting this. Least of all Prem who has to rearrange his features into one of surprised delight. He sits down. 
PREM You'll play? 
JAMAL Why not? 
PREM Well, well, well. We've got a wild one, here. 
Prem tears up the cheque with theatrical slowness. 
(CONTINUED) 
42   CONTINUED:                                                42 
PREM (CONT'D) For sixty-four thousand rupees, Ladies and Gentlemen, the question once again.... 
43   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   43 
The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the descending river of people out of his way, the eighteen year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps that cross the platforms. He pushes to the middle of the footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He scans the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her: the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly beautiful, over the other side of the station. A world away. She is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is. 
JAMAL Latika! Latika! 
But though he is screaming her name, his voice is swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her. 
JAMAL (CONT'D) Latika! 
Frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one figure against an army of white-robed people. 
JAMAL (CONT'D) Latika! 
JAMAL V/O Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. 
PREM V/O Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Sure? 
JAMAL V/O I think so. 
PREM V/O You think so. A brave man, Ladies and Gentlemen, a brave man. 
44   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   44 
The commuters have mostly gone. Jamal is pacing the platform desperately. He stops, stares blankly at the statue in front of him- a proud, rather pompous figure in a Victorian frock coat. The plaque reads: Frederick Stevens. 
45   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                           45 
The Inspector, Srinivas and Jamal are staring at the video recorder. 
JAMAL Yes. Final answer. Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. 
PREM Is the right answer! Sixty-four thousand rupees to you, Sir! 
Applause and music. The Inspector presses pause. Stares at Jamal. 
INSPECTOR And did she come back? 
Jamal smiles sadly.

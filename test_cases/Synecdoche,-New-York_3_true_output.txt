CLAIRE I don't know what it means. 
ARIEL Can me have a nickel if I doesn't play with my pee-pee no more? A hovercraft glides down the street with searchlights.

CADEN How about The Flawed Light of Love and Grief? 
CLAIRE I'm not sure. Sammy jots something in his book. 
118INT. CLAIRE'S BEDROOM (NYC APARTMENT) - 2025 - NIGHT118 
Caden and Claire have sex. Sammy watches from a chair in the corner. Ariel sits on his lap. They finish and Caden glances at Sammy. 
119EXT. CLAIRE'S FIRE ESCAPE (NYC APARTMENT) - WINTER 2025 - 119 
LATER Caden and Sammy watch the city: fires in the distance. Human wailing. Christmas decorations in windows across the way. Occasional explosions. Claire pokes her head out. 
CLAIRE I'm going to work in my journal. You guys need anything? 
CADENSAMMY No, thanks.No, thanks, Claire. 
CADEN Claire? I want you to drop your study of Mrs. Kranstein. 
CLAIRE CADEN Caden -- I want you to play yourself. Sammy's going to move into your apartment set as me. 
CLAIRE CADEN It's just that I've made suchAs the vision reveals itself, enormous strides as Jocelynwe all have to be willing to and -- adapt, honey. 
SAMMY It'd be my honor to play your husband, Claire. You're an amazing actress. I saw you in Bernarda Alba last year at The Roundabout. 
CLAIRE Yeah? That was a fun play. Emotionally tough, but fucking fulfilling.

CLAIRE (CONT'D) And I loved working with so many strong female actresses. Ugh, Lorca's a genius. Okay. I'm going to start thinking about myself. Claire exits. 
SAMMY Start, huh? Caden chuckles. 
SAMMY (CONT'D) 
(BEAT) Why did we leave Adele, Caden? 
CADEN She left us. You know that better than anyone. Except me. 
SAMMY Amazing artist though. The best living artist. There's no one who stares the truth in the face like she does. A sweet pussy, too. Caden looks at Sammy, confused. 
CADEN How do you know that? 
SAMMY Oh. I read it. 
CADEN Anyway, I don't know where she is. A strange dirigible flies very low overhead. 
SAMMY Maybe she's got a sublet in New York. Maybe the Met's doing a retrospective. Maybe, baby. He hands Caden a slip of paper. 
CADEN Why are you giving this to me? 
SAMMY I want to follow you there and see how you lose even more of yourself. Research. For the part. Partner.

120 EXT. CITY STREET (NEAR 31Y BUILDING) - FALL 2026 - NIGHT 120 
Dark, deserted part of town. The wind blows wet leaves. A kid walks by in a Hallowe'en costume, looking lost. Caden finds the address: an old, narrow, very tall, very dark building. There's a piece of looseleaf paper with the handwritten note "Death in family. God relieve our grief." taped to the front door. He approaches the tenant buzzers and buzzes 31Y. The name on the apartment is Capgras. The door buzzes.

122 INT. ELEVATOR (31Y BUILDING) - 2026 - MOMENTS LATER122 
It's small. The walls are panelled with ancient, scarred wood. Caden presses "31." The doors close; the elevator ascends, swaying and creaking. The doors open on 17; nobody gets on. As they begin to close: 
FAINT FARAWAY VOICE Hold it. Hold it, please. Caden reaches for the "door open" button but doesn't press it. The doors close and the elevator continues its shaky ascent. The doors open on 31 and Caden exits. 
123 INT. 31ST FLOOR HALLWAY (31Y BUILDING) - 2026 - CONTINUOUS 123 
Sound of the elevator descending. Caden heads down the long hall, looking at apartment numbers. He gets to the end and is only at 31J. He turns and heads back. The elevator is ascending again. As he passes the elevator door, it opens and a very old, feeble-looking man or woman steps out. 
OLD PERSON I asked you to hold the door. 
CADEN OLD PERSON I'm sorry. I pressed it, butYou didn't press it. I think it was too late. Caden continues to walk down the hall. The old person walks behind him. Caden looks behind him and smiles awkwardly. 
CADEN Have a good night. He picks up his pace, trying to be casual about it. He arrives at 31Y, glances over and sees the old person knocking feebly on a door down the hall.

OLD PERSON Frances, I need to go to the clinic. Something's terribly wrong with my nose. Caden knocks on 31Y. No answer. He knocks again. Down the hall, the door opens and another old person steps out into the hall. This person examines the first old person's nose. 
OLD PERSON #2 Oh yes. I see. Old Person #2 squints over at Caden. 
OLD PERSON #2 (CONT'D) Are you Ellen? Ellen?!

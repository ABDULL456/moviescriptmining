She lurches up and staggers upstairs. 
NANCY shivers and looks down at her arm.  The cut beneath her bandage has begun to bleed again.  And from inside the furnace, as if from deep below, the PULSING of the boundless nightmare-boiler room can be faintly heard. 
127.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          127. 
WIDE ON THE STREET AND BOTH HOUSES, GLEN's on the right, NANCY's on the left.  A TELEPHONE RINGS.  ZOOM IN ON GLEN'S UPSTAIRS BEDROOM WINDOW. 
128.  INT.  GLEN'S & NANCY'S BEDROOMS - INTERCUT.  NIGHT.                128. 
129.  GLEN, yawning, crosses and picks up his telephone.                 129. 
GLEN Hello? 
NANCY (telephone) Hi. 
GLEN Oh.  Hi, how y'doing? 
NANCY looks out the window and touches her hair. 
NANCY (CONTD) Fine.  Stand by your window so I can see you.  You sound a million miles away. 
In the lighted window across the way, she can SEE GLEN move into sight.  In his shot, we can SEE NANCY step into her window behind the bars. 
NANCY (CONTD) Much better. 
GLEN I heard your ma went ape at the security store today.  You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something.  How long's it been since you slept? 
NANCY Coming up on the seventh day.  It's okay, I checked Guiness.  The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to. (beat) Listen, I... I know who he is. 
GLEN Who? 
NANCY The killer. 
GLEN You do? 
NANCY Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next. 
GLEN is appalled. 
GLEN Me!?  Why would anyone want to kill me?! 
NANCY Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out. 
GLEN pales. 
GLEN Bring him out of what? 
NANCY My dream. 
GLEN How you plan to do that? 
NANCY Just like I did the hat.  Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up. 
GLEN Me? (switching back to a more comfortable reality) Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream! 
NANCY If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts. 
GLEN I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway. 
NANCY Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out. 
GLEN What!? 
NANCY (simplicity itself) You heard me.  I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up.  We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him.  Clever, huh? 
GLEN You crazy?  Hit him with what? 
NANCY You're a jock.  You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile... 
GLEN (weakly) Meanwhile..? 
NANCY Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep.  Midnight. 
She hangs up.  GLEN's eyes bug out. 
GLEN Holy shit!  Midnight.  Baseball bats and boogemen.  Unfucking real.

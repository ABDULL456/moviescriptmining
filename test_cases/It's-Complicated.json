{"train": "The SUV pulls to a stop, Jane gets out. Gabby starts pulling cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes. JANE Gabby, you're leaving now? I thought you were going in the morning? \nGABBY I know but my friends are all there and they wanted me to come tonight. \nJANE But honey, it's gonna get dark soon. You can't see out the back window. It's Saturday night. People will be on the road drinking... \nLAUREN Mom, she'll be there in a couple of hours, she'll be fine. \nGABBY Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here. I'll be back for it in a few days. \nJANE Want me to drive it down in the morning? (Gabby's BLACKBERRY BUZZES, she laughs, thumbs flying) I could be there by lunch. We could go to that big Bed, Bath, and Beyond, buy kitchen stuff... Gabby, can you look up from that thing?? \nGABBY (looking up) I got it covered, Ma. (to Harley) Hey gangsta, help me carry these... \nHARLEY (exhausted) Yep.... \nGabby and Harley CARRY THE BOXES back into the house.   Jane seems worried as she watches them. \nLAUREN Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the house alone? \nJANE What are you....? No! (Lauren looks doubtful) -- I'm not! One of you is always moving out... (Gabby re-joins) But I am wondering who I'm gonna watch The Hills with? \nGABBY (huge hug) Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you. \nJane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard. Harley joins the group. GABBY Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing this. (walks to her car) Mom, you don't happen to know where Dad is, do you? I tried calling him to say goodbye... \nJANE He was at Sally and Ted's. \nHARLEY He was? How was that? You and them at the same -- (Jane turns to him) -- not that it's in any way, any of my... was just... JANE -- It was.... (notices both girls wait for her answer) -- whatever. It was fine. \nGABBY Was her lunatic child there? \nJANE (laughs) Not this time. Gabby, call me when you get there. Do NOT forget. (MORE) JANE(cont'd) (Gabby texts, deep in convo ) Gabby! GABBY I will. I'll call you! LAUREN Knock `em dead, little one. \nHARLEY And call us when you get there, too. And no texting and driving. \nJane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and starts off. \nHARLEY (puts his arm around Jane's shoulder) They grow up so friggin' fast. I hate it. Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight. LAUREN Maybe you should get a dog. \nJANE Oh my God.     Goodbye you two.   Love you. \nHARLEY (heading for their car and getting into the passenger seat) Love you boss! \nAs Lauren and Harley drive off,    Jane turns and looks at her suddenly very empty nest. \n4   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                    4 A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years. Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath! \n5   INT. KITCHEN                                                      5 Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen.      The Kids have left a few glasses and plates on the island. \nJane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses, allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of it. \n7   INT. THE BAKERY - MONTECITO - DAY                             7 This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get in. \nA very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and friendly. \nJane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass- through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker. \nJANE Reynaldo... (nods to the muffins) \nADAM And you don't think in the future you might want a his? \nJANE Oh, God, we're talking code about my life, right? \nADAM (laughs) No, no, didn't mean to be. \nJANE The truth is, in my current bathroom, I have two sinks and sometimes the other sink makes me feel bad. \nADAM One sink. Not a problem. Can we schedule a meeting for next week? Does Tuesday work for you? JANE Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too early? At the house? \nADAM I'll be there. \n9   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING                              9 Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room. The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR ENTERS. \nJANE Hi. \nDOCTOR Hi. I'm Dr. Moss. \nJANE (shaking his hand) Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted to start with... and please don't take this the wrong way but I'm the type of person who kind of makes fun of people who get plastic surgery. \nDR. MOSS I understand. \nJANE You do? Good, because, you know, some women can look a little fake and plasticky. And in my opinion -- worse. \nDR. MOSS I agree. \nJANE Oh, that's good, so, well, as against the whole thing as I am, I do have a problem that's been bugging me. My left eyelid is really saggy. I find I'm sometimes holding it up when I'm watching TV or reading and I was wondering if that's something you could fix. \nDR. MOSS (looking at her closely) It's resting on your eye lashes. JANE Is it? \nDR. MOSS (measures her lids with a very tiny ruler) Actually you have the same amount of excess skin on both sides. \nJANE I do? Well, I'm only interested in fixing one eye. DR. MOSS Jane, what you need to fix this is a brow lift. \nJANE A brow lift? Wh-what is that exactly? \nDR. MOSS We surgically cut at your hair line. Incision goes right across here. (demonstrates on himself by indicating a line drawn like a headband) Then we just lift the skin up a little tighter across the skull. (Jane nods, already hating this) We staple it back in place right above your ears. Recovery isn't all that bad but you could be fairly numb and you'll probably have a headache that lasts anywhere from say 3 to 6 months. \n10   INT. ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING                               10 Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button.   The elevator moves down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility Center. Helping Couples Become Parents. \nJane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously mid-argument. \nAgness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up when they realize Jane is in the elevator. \nAGNESS Jane! \nJANE -- Hey.. JAKE Hiii. \nJANE Hello. \nAGNESS (pushing the Lobby button, mumbles) -- Perfect. \nPEDRO Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake. \nJAKE Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to someone. \nPedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the elevator. \nAGNESS Pedro, up! Now!! (she snaps) \nJAKE I know but I always wondered so... \nJANE Little jealous? \nJAKE Yes. \nJANE The man's married now. \nJAKE I don't care. How long? \nJANE Eight months. \nJAKE (surprised) Long.... \nJANE Not long. \nA23   LATER                                                      A23 The bar is now crowded. Jane and Jake are finally eating but still drinking. Jake is telling Jane a long story and she can't stop laughing. \n23    OMIT                                                        23 \n24    BRANDY TIME                                                 24 A DJ spins for the after dinner crowd. Couples dance on the dance floor. Jane and Jake both react to the song. \nJAKE This song reminds me of your birthday party... the one in our old house... JANE -- Oh, yeah. That was such a fun night. JAKE So fun. You wore that white halter dress.... JANE (remembering) Oh, yeahhhh.... (remembering it all, looks at Jake with a longing for her own past...) JAKE Want to dance? JANE -- No...! \n25   THE DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          25 Jake and Jane are dancing...it's familiar yet with the blush of the new. Something's going on here. Jake starts singing. Jane joins in. This is by far, the loosest we've seen her. Of course, it helps that she's drunk. They dance around one another without inhibition. A mating dance.... \nJANE (astonished, laughing) You're married to someone else...! \nJAKE Tell me about it! \nThey both laugh then Jake pulls Jane close. JANE (sexy....) Hey.... I know you. \nJAKE (looking deeply into her) And I know you.... \nCUT TO: \n26   INT. JAKE'S SUITE - LATER                                    26 They're in bed and they've done it. They're not even entirely undressed. They're spent, sweaty, breathing heavily. Jake cups his hand on Jane's vagina, gives it a solid pat and hold. \nJAKE Home sweet home. \nJANE Oh......God......... \nJane covers her face. \nJAKE That was one crazy ride...thought we were going to break the bed. \nJANE (not looking good) -- I'm having an out of body experience. \nJAKE Totally. You're so great, Janey. I forgot how great. Holy shit. \nJANE Please shut up.    I'm so dizzy. \nJAKE And the pilates are payin' off by the way. \nJane moans, OPENS THE NIGHT TABLE DRAWER, leans over and throws up into it. \nJAKE Oh no! \nJane woozily sits up on her side of the bed, her back to Jake. Jake looks over at her. JAKE You okay? \nJAKE -- Janey, I take my hat off to you. \nJANE Okay, Jake. Thank you. Out of nowhere, sudden appreciation. But thank you. Really. \nJAKE Not totally out of nowhere, Jane...if you know what I mean. \nJANE (quickly) Which I don't...but... \nLAUREN What's he...? \nJANE -- Have no idea. Let's move on, shall we? Jane holds up her droopy left eye. \nGABBY I'd like to say something too. For real. No offense to the lovely Agness or her charming offspring... (the Kids stifle laughs) \nJAKE -- Not nice. \nHarley stops laughing. \nGABBY I know. I'm sorry. But I just want to say I really loved today, just being with the original five... (Luke nods in agreement) -- plus Harley, but he's like one of us. I don't think we've ever done this before... Had a meal together. And hung out like this... \nLAUREN You mean other than the first 13 years of your life. \nLUKE I know what's she saying. It's been awesome....just for a whole day to be just... us. \nThey all reflect on that one. \n31   INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - LATER                          31 The Adlers are at the Reception Desk. Jane and Jake are next to each other, signing their credit card receipts, the Kids chat behind them. \nJAKE (to Jane) Something feels right in the universe again, doesn't it? \nJane looks at him but doesn't answer.    She turns to the Kids. \nJANE So who's coming home when?   No one's told me the details. \nJake's CELL RINGS. Jane half listens to his conversation. \nJAKE (into cell) Hey. (turns away) How's Pedro feeling? \nDistracted, Jane focuses on Lauren. \nLAUREN (responding to \"Pedro\") Okay, we're gonna help pack Luke up, the three of us leave day after tomorrow and Luke's home the end of the week. \nJAKE (rejoins, finishing his call) -- I will. Call you when I land. (slips cell away, not missing a beat) Janey, what flight are you on? \nJANE I'm on the uh, the four o'clock. JAKE Ah, too bad. I'm on the five o'clock. \nLUKE That's nuts, why don't you try to get on the same flight? \nJAKE Yeah, I could try. \nJANE It's been...great, but let's not ... push it. \nLAUREN He was just trying to be nice. \nJANE I know. Okay, I've got to hit the road, guys. (MORE) JANE(cont'd) (kisses each kid as they line up) Thanks for staying. So proud of you. Be good. Call me if you need me. (she arrives at Jake, pauses, speechless) \nJAKE (kisses her cheek) It was really fun. \nJANE (painfully) It was. \n35   EXT. HOUSE - LATER                                         35 Blue prints are spread on a garden table.   Adam is drawing as Jane watches. ADAM -- So if we move this wall back a bit, that can bring the arch forward, which is where you really want it, right? JANE Yes, I'd love that. \nADAM (sketching) Thought so. \nJANE I have an idea... what if we move my bedroom like six or eight feet so I can get more of the morning light? (MORE) JANE(cont'd) (sees Adam hesitate) Not possible? \nADAM -- Yes, but you'll wake up in the morning, open your bedroom door and fall 12 feet into your kitchen. \nJANE Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up there! \nADAM But I get where you're headed. Let me see what I can do... This property is so great... Have you lived here a long time? \nJANE About ten years. I bought this place right after my divorce but it's taken me until now to be able to finally do this.... Jane and Adam are distracted when a Porsche noisily pulls up and Jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude. \nJAKE Good morning! (to Jane) Am I interrupting...? \nJANE (thrown that   he's here) Hi. No, well, we   were just about done. Adam, this   is my ex-husband, Jake. Jake, this   is Adam Schaeffer, my architect. \nJAKE Hi. \nADAM (they shake hands) Good to meet you. \nJAKE (re: plans) Can I take a look?   Do you mind? \nAdam looks to Jane for approval but too late, Jake's already looking. \nJANE Everything's not 100% worked out yet... \nJAKE Wow. You're finally getting the kitchen you always wanted... JANE Yeah... \nJAKE Huge bedroom. JANE It's not huge. (suddenly insecure) Why don't I show these to you when we get a little closer. \nJane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little. Adam finishes for her. She thanks him with her eyes. \nADAM So, I think next we should stake out the addition... see how it all feels - size wise... JANE Sounds great. ADAM I'll e-mail you and we'll set it up. We did good work today. Jake, nice meeting you. \nJake smiles and waves as Adam exits, walking to his car. JAKE (turns to Jane) Got time for a cup of coffee? \nAdam can't help but sneak a look back at them.   Jane waves, a bit embarrassed. \n36   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                          36 Jane moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge, taking out juice... \nJAKE Why haven't you returned any of my calls or e-mails? \nJANE Jake, come on. This is just too weird. We have to just never do what we did - ever again. You're an adulterer and I'm an awful person, basically. I haven't slept in days. What we did was just so wrong on so many levels. \nJAKE And it was so right on a couple of levels too. Admit it. \nJANE (finally settles) No! It wasn't! On no levels was it right! \nJAKE You can't say we didn't enjoy each other's company. Sitting at the bar, dancing...after dancing... (she doesn't want to be reminded) Come on, you and I haven't had fun like that in a hundred years. JANE Yes! Because we're not supposed to have fun like that! We're divorced!   Are you like, what? Unhappy at home?   Does she not \"understand\" you? Did you just want to know what it would be like with someone my age? What is this? \nJAKE I'd be lying if I said I never think about you, Janey. I think about you. A lot. And no, it's not perfect at home. Obviously. Look at me. I've got three grown kids and I'm going to kindergarten interviews. I'm a walking cliche. \nJane shrugs.   She agrees. \nJAKE And I can't, literally can't stop thinking about what happened in New York. Fate brought us together once, maybe it happened again. (she pauses...) And I know... you've moved on with your life, I get it, but you can't deny something real and honest happened that night. Can't we just go with it, see where it takes us. No one has to know. (Jane shudders) You were so great. So loose and sexy. How often do you get to be like that?    You can run and open restaurants and build your perfect kitchen but what about having someone to hold you in the middle of the night...? \nJANE Not high on my list these days. \nJANE (laughs at Adam) Feels perfect. \nADAM I thought so too. JANE (taking it all in) This is heaven! ADAM It's gonna be cool.    Want to go upstairs? \n43   JANE AND ADAM ATOP SIDE BY SIDE LADDERS                     43 ADAM So if you were lying in bed, this would be your view. \nJane breaks into a smile. \nTHEIR POV - IN THE DISTANCE -- THE OCEAN \nOver this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses, then pushes \"IGNORE\" and then promptly loses her balance. Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her. \nADAM You okay? \nJANE (grabs her heart) Yeah. \nCUT TO: \nWATER RUNNING OUT OF A FAUCET \n44   INT. BATHROOM - JAKE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                    44 Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness calling his name in anger. He leaps. \nJAKE Coming! \nJake quietly UNLOCKS THE BATHROOM DOOR and EXITS to find his path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at him. \nPEDRO What were you doing in there? \nJAKE Going to the bathroom. \nPEDRO The toilet didn't flush. \nJAKE Yes it did. \nPEDRO Why were you in the shower with your clothes on? \nJAKE (making sure Agness doesn't hear) What are you talking about? \nPEDRO I heard the shower door close. \nJAKE What do you have, x-ray ears? \nAgness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking through. She holds a broom. \nAGNESS What's up Pedro? \nPEDRO Jake took a shower with his clothes on. \nJAKE Pedro!    Darling... AGNESS What's he talking about? \nJAKE I don't speak Pedro.   That's your department. \nAGNESS (to Pedro) Don't go in the kitchen, P, I broke something. (to Jake, annoyed) Yo. Can you help? \nAgness EXITS back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake. \nCUT TO: \n45   TWO GORGEOUS CROQUE-MONSIEURS - COMING OUT OF AN OVEN       45 These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are carried to Jane's counter. We're: \nJANE No.... (starts to say something.) No. \nADAM No? \nEXT. JANE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window. He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet, he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME. \n51   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - A BIT LATER                               51 Jane walks Adam to the door.    He holds rolled blueprints. \nADAM This was so nice and relaxing and the lavender ice cream was actually the best dessert of any sort I've ever had... like, in my life. \nJANE Aw, thank you. I always make ice cream when I can't sleep, so I'm glad someone was here to eat it. (opens door) \nADAM (pauses...) Great getting to know you a little. \nJANE (nods) It was really fun. \nAdam waves, Jane waves. Definitely a little sweet/awkward. Jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for the kitchen, when there's a QUICK KNOCK on the FRONT DOOR. \nJANE Woops!   Coming! \nJane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find: \nJAKE \nleaning in the door frame. \nJAKE O.M.G. I thought he'd never leave. (entering) Hello Jane, you look very beautiful tonight. \nHe takes her in his arms. \nJAKE Mmmmm. Love when you smell like butter. \nJANE (easing away) What are you doing here? \nJAKE Missed you. \nJANE It's nine o'clock. Where does your wife think you are? \nJAKE At yoga.   Shall we do some downward facing dog? \nJANE Not tonight big guy. \nThey CROSS INTO THE KITCHEN. CAMERA TRACKS. \nJAKE Is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes? I won't think less of you, you know. \nJANE Really, Jake, I'm a little tired, I was just gonna take a bath. \nJAKE Good. So, we'll just hang out. (now IN THE KITCHEN, he SEES the dinner dishes on the counter) Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur? Who's plate is this? Yours or his? \nJANE Mine. \nJAKE (eats her leftovers, savors the taste) Oh my God, just as I remember it. \nJANE Don't you ever eat at your house? \nJAKE Pedro dictates all meals and he has a very limited palate. (sees melted ice cream) What kind of ice cream is that? \nJANE Lavender Honey. \nJAKE (looking down at her, smiles) Tell the truth, Janey is this a great affair, or what? \nJANE I don't know. It's my first. \nJAKE (climbing down) We don't even have to have sex and it's fun. (arrives next to her) I wish I could sleep over. \nJANE I gotta tell my shrink about this. This is a lot to handle. I guess you should go ... I'm sure yoga's probably closed by now. (MORE) JANE(cont'd) Oh, you got a little ice cream on your shirt. Let me get that out. \nJAKE It's okay... \nJake takes Jane in his arms and gives her a deep hug. He lingers, kissing her neck, smelling her skin. She kisses him on the cheek. He slides her robe off her shoulder. He softly caresses her shoulder, kissing it, then makes his way up her neck.   Jane gives in and kisses Jake fully on the lips. He pulls her close, her robe falling. \nJANE Wow, wow, wow...what's happening, Jake? \nThe Phone RINGS.   Jane pauses. JAKE Don't get it. JANE I always get it. I have three kids. (Jake wishes she wouldn't. She hesitates, picks it up) Hello. Hiii... (makes an I told you so face) You still on the plane? How was Luke when you left? Oh, that sounds like fun. Let me know what I can bring..... No! Don't have any idea where he is. (points to Jake) Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow. (hangs up) Now I'm lying...... Lauren and Harley are giving Luke a graduation party this weekend. Sweet, huh? \nJake's CELL PHONE RINGS, sees it's Lauren calling. \nJAKE (into phone) Hello stranger. Welcome back. \nJane OPENS THE DOOR and Jake darts over for a quick kiss and then EXITS toward his car. They wave to one another. \nJAKE (into phone) -- Just getting in my car. This weekend? Sounds great. Let me know what I can bring... \nJake looks to Jane. She shakes her head -- he's shameless. Jake shrugs. Jane watches as Jake drives off, talking on his cell. \n54   EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET - EARLY MORNING                  54 Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from her bakery.   She's clearly waiting for someone. \nShe spots a comfortably dressed MAN IN HIS MID FORTIES holding the leash of an Airedale and approaching the building's entrance. \nJANE (approaching him) Dr. Allen! \nDR. ALLEN (surprised to see her) Jane. Hi. Am I seeing you today? JANE No, I just need to talk...and I was wondering if there was any chance you could squeeze me in for an emergency session. I'm sort of desperate for some advice. I brought you some of that coffee cake you like. Not as a bribe or anything... \nDR. ALLEN (checks his watch) I only have twenty minutes until my first patient. \nJANE That's fine. I'll talk fast. \n55   INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER          55 Jane, Dr. Allen and the Dog walk the corridor. \nJANE (whispering) So, at this point, I just need some sound, unbiased guidance. Is having an affair with you know who a good thing or a bad thing? (they stop at Dr. Allen's office door) It's a bad thing, right? How could it be good? \nDR. ALLEN (opening his door) It's not good. It's not bad. \nOh, man.   Not what she needs to hear. \n56   INT. OFFICE                                                56 Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair.   Dr. Allen turns on a few lamps as his dog settles. DR. ALLEN You know, things happen in life and our job is to find out why. What we have to do is take a real look at this. Are you ready to do that? \nJANE I am. Definitely. I've made a list of what this can possibly be about...at my end. Can I read it to you? \nDR. ALLEN (taking his seat) Of course. JANE (digging out her Blackberry) Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself. (reads from Blackberry) Okay. Am I still trying to figure out why the marriage failed? Do I want to get back together? Do we have unfinished business? Is this about revenge?   Am I just... lonely? Or, is it my \"caretaker\" thing? (MORE) JANE(cont'd) You know, the kids are finally gone and now all of a sudden Jake's back and I get to take care of him in some way... \nDr. Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done. JANE And, listen, I get how therapy works, I do... We look at things, we examine them, weeks turn into months, what....? we're going on eight years, right?.... and I'm okay with that, I like it... but in this case, I need to know what you really think. Like, I'd like you to say... Don't do this, it's absolutely wrong or go ahead, you'll be fine. I actually want to be told what to do. \nDR. ALLEN What's interesting is I'm already seeing you open up more than I have in some time. I'm thinking, through this affair, you may learn to view the world in a different way. \nJANE I'm sorry. I need more concrete. Are you saying I should keep seeing him? Because, honestly, if the guilt and fear could go away, maybe I could let go a little and figure this out. \nDR. ALLEN I wouldn't resist looking at this. \nLAUREN (turning) Who did you just see? \nLuckily Jake is now gone. \nHARLEY No one. Thought it was your cousin...but... \nHarley falls silent as he SEES JANE ENTER THE HOTEL AND CROSS TO THE RECEPTION DESK. After a sec, she's pointed toward the same elevator. HARLEY Ohhhh my sweet Lord.... \nLAUREN (looks up from her salad) Now what? \nHARLEY Honey, I totally forgot I have a conference call at 1:15, I gotta get back to the office. Waiter! Honey, stop eating, get the waiter. Call the one over there. (pointing her away from Jane) \nLAUREN Harley, we can't leave, we're meeting with the Wedding Specialist. \nHARLEY (watches as Jake waits for Jane around the corner) Yeah, you know what? Today's not a good idea to do that. (Sees Jane join Jake, they step into the elevator and immediately fall into each other's arms and kiss) Oh my God...!!! \n61   INT. JAKE AND JANE'S HOTEL ROOM - UPSTAIRS - SAME TIME      61 The curtains are drawn,   the lights are low. Jane, in a hotel robe, slips a cd in the   cd player and we hear a mellow song, perfect for love in the   afternoon. The Bathroom Door OPENS and Jake EXITS, also in   a hotel robe. \nJane stands across the room from him. They smile at one another. From behind, we see Jane untie her robe, letting it fall to the floor. Jake looks at her, from head to toe and back. They smile at one another, then something comes over Jake. His eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses against the wall. \nJANE Jake!!! \n62   INT. LOBBY CAFE - SAME TIME                                 62 The Hotel's Wedding Specialist has joined Lauren and Harley's table. She holds a binder filled with photos. Harley is a mess, knowing what's going on upstairs. \nWEDDING SPECIALIST I adore October weddings. Let me show you what we did last October. \nShe opens her Book of Photos for Lauren. Lauren gasps. \nHARLEY (rising) Honey, I'm gonna make that phone call from the... \nLauren and the Wedding Specialist don't look up and don't hear him. They keep talking to each other. \nHARLEY (nods) -- Okay. Good. You just keep doing that and I'll... They still don't look up. Harley nervously HEADS FOR THE LOBBY when he spots the HOTEL DOCTOR, bag in hand, arriving at the Reception Desk. \nHOTEL DOC What's the room number? \nRECEPTION CLERK 408. Adler. His wife said he's conscious now... \nHOTEL DOC (taking off) On my way. \nHarley stops in his tracks, freaking.   Adler??? \n63   INT. JANE AND JAKE'S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER           63 Jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure cuff around his arm. Jane, still in her robe, paces. The Hotel Doc sits on a chair next to Jake's side of the bed. \nHOTEL DOC Your blood pressure's good. \nJANE How's his heart? \nHOTEL DOC Do you have a heart condition, Mr. Adler? \nJAKE No.   And I just had a check up. \nJANE You did?   Oh, that's good. \nHOTEL DOC (listening to his heart) Deep breath. So, no chest pain? \nJAKE None. \nHOTEL DOC When you got dizzy, did you feel your heart was beating funny? \nJake doesn't answer.    Jane turns, looks right at him. \nJAKE Only if she initiates it. \nJane GROANS. JAKE I'm trying not to rock the boat at home until you and I figure this out. (sees her reaction) This is a little trickier at my end than yours. \nJANE Right. Yeah. Okay.... (rises...) Now I know you're gonna think I'm leaving because of what you just said, but I'm not. I really have to get back to work. \nJAKE (takes Jane's hand) We got really close there for a moment. \nShe knows he's right. Jane's Cell RINGS.     She lets it ring again, then answers it. \nJANE (into phone) Hello? \n66   ADAM - AT HIS OFFICE                                        66 ADAM (into phone) Hi, hope I'm not interrupting anything. \nINTERCUT JANE AND ADAM \nJANE Adam! Oh!     Hi. \nJake is instantly jealous.   He rises, crosses to the closet, starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very engaged by Adam. \nADAM I just found out there's a French Film Festival in town and that made me think of you so I was wondering if you'd like to go to the opening night tomorrow night. (a little nervous... will she accept?) \nJANE Oh, that sounds so fun... (Jake rolls his eyes) Let me think, tomorrow's what? \nJAKE (desperate, whispers) -- Say you're busy. Agness has a dinner thing tomorrow, I can come over. (Jane hesitates) Please. \nJANE Oh, um, you know, I'd really love to, but, my son is coming home from college the next day and I have a bunch of things I have to do to get ready... (hates lying, Jake crosses to her, smiles) I'm so sorry. \nADAM No, don't worry. No problem. Maybe we can see something another night. \nJANE Absolutely. I would love that. Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her. \n67   ADAM HANGS UP                                              67 We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets. He looks at them then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker. \nADAM Melanie, how would you and your husband like two tickets to the opening of the French Film Festival? Reserved seats...VIP parking... \nFEMALE WORKER Seriously? \n68   INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              68 Jane and Jake are finishing getting dressed, moving about, putting on shoes, blouses, ties, jackets, belts... JAKE You'll make the whole thing?    The roast chicken, the--- \nJANE -- mashed potatoes, sauteed string beans and double fudge chocolate cake. I know your favorite dinner, Jakey. \nJAKE (touched) You haven't called me Jakey in 10 years. This has been a great day for us. So, do we have a date? JANE (fixes Jake's hair) We have a date. Jake grabs his heart. Jane leans on him, a smile on her face as we begin to HEAR MUSIC. \n69   EXT. JANE'S PATIO -    LATE DAY - MUSIC OVER                 69 Music plays from the outdoor speakers. Jane sets the table in her courtyard. She's singing along with the music. \n70   A PERFECT CAKE - MUSIC OVER                                  70 sits on the Kitchen Counter. Jane finishes off icing the cake like the pro she is then peeks into the oven, looks at her perfect roast chicken. \n71   OMIT                                                         71 \n72   INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - MUSIC OVER                             72 Jane clips the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off its hanger. \n73   A CLOCK ON A NIGHT STAND                                     73 tells us it's 8:45. \nON JAKE \nHis eyes glued to the clock. We are IN JAKE AND AGNESS' BEDROOM. Jake and Agness lie on their bed, both doing paper work. Pedro is asleep between them. Jake gets up, slipping his cell into his hand. AGNESS (not looking at him) Why are you taking your cell to the bathroom? \nJake's cell RINGS.    He turns his back to take it. \nJAKE (into cell) Hi Ag... Just got here. \nJane has a hot flash.    Starts fanning herself. \nJAKE (into cell) Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know. (turns back to the family) I'm sorry guys, I gotta hit it. \nJANE Bye-bye. \nThe Girls look to Jane. \nJAKE I have to stop at the market. Agness is making some pasta thing and she ran out of olive oil. \nGABBY Hey, at least she's finally cooking. \nJAKE So...see everybody at the party tomorrow... LAUREN Yeah.   It's gonna be so fun. \nJANE (to Lauren) I told you I'm bringing someone, right? \nLAUREN No. Who? \nJANE Adam.   My architect. \nJAKE You're bringing your architect? \nJANE Yes I am. \nJAKE Like as a date? \nJANE (looking right at him) Yeah. \nGABBY I like the idea. \nJANE Me too. \nHARLEY Yeah, seems like it should round out everything really nicely. (pouring another drink) Nobody wants wine but me? \nLuke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands it to Jake. \nLUKE Here, now you can stay another five minutes. (catches Jane's eye) You have three bottles in there. \nJAKE Janey, can I talk to you privately? Just for a sec. \nJane heads out still holding the carving knife.   Harley slips the knife out of her hand. \nHARLEY There you go.... (to Kids) Somebody's talkin' graduation gift. \n78   INT. COURTYARD                                             78 Jane and Jake stand in the courtyard off of the Living Room. \nJANE What is it, Jake?   What? \nJAKE I don't get not calling me back. \nJANE `Cause I don't care what your excuse is. (shuts the door to the living ) \nJAKE She didn't go out, Jane. She cancelled her plans and every time I tried to call or write, she caught me. I wanted to be here. \nJANE You know what, Jake? You were worried about rocking the boat at home? Well now you're rocking my boat and I don't like it. \nShe OPENS THE DOOR A LITTLE WIDER and we NOW SEE she's eating a gi-normous piece of cake. \nADAM (trying not to react to that, ENTERS, handing her the gift.) This is for you. \nJANE Really? Thank you! Come on in. (takes a huge bite of cake) Can you hold this for a sec? (hands him the cake plate) Oh my God... (takes another bite) -- this could be the best cake I ever made. You want a piece? It's like... beyond... \nADAM I think I'm good. \nJANE (focusing on the gift) I can't believe you brought me a gift?! So nice! \nJane unwraps the gift, turns it around, looks at it. \nJANE An appointment book? \nADAM I sort of assumed you didn't have one. \nJANE --Because I never remember our... Awww.... \nADAM I took the liberty of filling in our next two meetings. And marked them with post-its and wrote them in red and then highlighted them in neon yellow. \nJANE Thank you! \nJane kisses Adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the kiss lands on his lips. \nJANE Sorry. \nADAM I'm not. (Did he really say that? Then, he licks his lips) Wow, that cake is good. \nJane laughs a little too hard. \n83   INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT                          83 JANE So, let me ask you something and please don't think I'm weird or out of line or anything... but do you by any chance poke smot? ADAM Do I...?? \nJANE I mean do you smoke pot?! I haven't asked anyone that question since I was twenty-two. \nADAM Uh. No, I don't. But I have. But I don't think I've had any since my kids were born...so not in like 27 years. \nJANE Oh my God, we have kids the same age! And I haven't had any since my kids were born either!!! Except for tonight. I had one hit off of this. \nJane pulls the joint out of her purse, just as they pull up next to a Police Car. \nADAM You might not want to hold that quite so... (nods) Hello Officer. \nJANE (turns, SEES the Cop Car, GASPS and DROPS THE JOINT, then TURNS to Cop, waves, then:) I actually know him! Blueberry scone and a latte. (the Cop nods, pulls away) Oh my God! That was horrifying. I instantly saw myself in a mug shot. My heart is leaping out of my... (then distracted) Wow... This is the most insane dashboard I've ever seen. It's like we're in a cockpit. It's spectacular. Adam, what kind of car is this? \nADAM Jane? \nJANE (turns to him) Hi. \nADAM Did you get this high from one hit? \nJANE Yes! I don't know what they've done to pot over the last 30 years but it rockkkkks! \n84   EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                    84 From OUTSIDE, we can see lots of folks in the Living Room. Candles dot the path up to the cottage door. Several Couples and College Kids are walking toward the house. \n85   ANGLE - BEHIND NEARBY BUSHES                                85 Jane and Adam are sharing the joint.   Jane takes a tiny, lady- like hit, passes it to Adam. \nJANE (whispers) Don't take too much, it's really strong. \nShe blows out the smoke. Adam, on the other hand, takes a huge hit. \nJANE (whispers giddily) I'm stoned. \nJAKE What?! You smoked the joint I gave you? \nJANE You told me to!    It's a-mazing!!! \nJAKE But you weren't supposed to smoke it with him, you're supposed to smoke it with me! \nJANE Somebody's jealous.... \nJAKE Yes, of course. Why shouldn't I be... you're my... \nJANE -- What?   What am I, Jake? \nJAKE You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest friend and girlfriend. \nJane blurts out a laugh. \nJANE Okay. You're hilarious. And because of that, even though I kind of hate you/love you, I'm going to let you have some... \nJAKE You love me? I mean, I heard \"hate\" had top billing, but... \nJane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands it to Jake. Just as she does that, THE DOOR OPENS and HARLEY ENTERS, thinking the bathroom is free. Jake quickly yanks him in, shuts the door, locks it. Harley is now caught between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke. \nHARLEY Oh my God, you're smoking weed in the guest bathroom. \nJAKE Yes we are and we'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this. \nHARLEY No. Never.     Adding it to the list. JANE Care for a toke? \nHARLEY I don't really smoke marijuana. \nJANE (blowing out smoke) Me either. \nHARLEY Okay, one hit. \nJANE (looks at herself in the mirror) (MORE) JANE(cont'd) Oh, my God. Is that what I look like? \n89   EXT. BACKYARD PATIO - MOMENTS LATER                          89 A small group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio. Adam and Agness are dancing together. They're totally into it. Jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends and The Beach Boys \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" begins. Jake follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning Gabby on his way. Jake takes Jane's hand...dances with her. Harley arrives next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their parents. \nLAUREN They must be hammered. \nHARLEY Or something like that. \nAdam glances over and sees Jane and Jake. \nADAM (to Agness) Sweetest divorced couple in the world..! \nAgness is surprised by how happy Jake looks with Jane. \nJANE (spotting Adam) Hey..! (to Jake) Jake, I'm gonna.... Jane and Adam cross toward one another. Jake dies a little as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam. Jake doesn't notice Agness is watching him.. Jane, now dancing with Adam, looks from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look back at Jake again. \nJake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away. Agness has her eyes firmly on Jake, not missing any of it. \n90   INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT                             90 Adam drives Jane home.   Clearly the end of a great night. JANE Wow. Fun is not overrated, is it? \nADAM You know what's great? \nJANE What? \nJANE (explains) Cooking scar.... From a very hot batch of caramel... \nADAM Ooooo. What about that one? \nJANE That one's from boiling sugar...I wasn't very skilled in the beginning.    And that one is from a large French... \nAdam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar. \nJANE -- Saute pan. \nAdam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as Adam moves closer. \nADAM Would it be okay if I...? \nJane nods.    He kisses her great. \nADAM I was going to say, kiss you. \nJANE I figured. \nADAM If you feel this is in any way wrong because we're working together... \nJANE ... I don't ... \nHe smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and kiss again. \n94   OMIT                                                         94 \nINT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice.\" Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt and boxers. JANE Hey sleepy! What time did you get in? \nLUKE Have no idea. Lauren and Harley drove me home. \nLAUREN (joining) I'm surprised you remember that. \nJANE (turns to see Lauren) Hi. I didn't know you slept here. \nLauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top, takes out a box of cereal. \nLAUREN We were playing Scattagories with Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell asleep on the couch. \nHarley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt. \nLUKE Sweet. \nHARLEY I got cold in the middle of the night. \nLauren and Jane laugh. \nJANE Okay, who wants what? (noticing Gabby entering) Hi baby... GABBY (looks out the front window) What's Dad doing here? \nEveryone LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and SEES Jake sitting in his Porsche. \n96   EXT. FRONT PORCH                                             96 Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's had a rough night and has something on his mind. Jane cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are all open. \nJANE (quietly) Everything okay? \nJAKE I left Agness. \nJANE No, don't say that. \nJAKE What's the difference? I was drowning over there. I'm not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure myself out. Janey, let's use these couple of days to see if we can make this work. \nJANE We can't, Jake. I told you this the other night. Please listen. \nJAKE But you were all pissy because you thought I stood you up. Things are different now. I'm a free man. (then) Can we just hug? I hate that you're being so distant. It's literally giving me a pain in my stomach. \nJANE Oh, God... \nJane reluctantly hugs him.      He tries to kiss her. \nJANE See!    Too much! \nJAKE Okay!    Good note. \nJane can't help but smile. \nJAKE Can I help with what you're doing? Hold your basket or... \nJANE I'm fine.... \nJAKE Okay... I'm going to go to the video store and get us all a dvd to watch tonight. We'll have movie night. Just like old times. How's that? I'll make the popcorn. Just then Jane's Cell RINGS. \nJANE Fine. (into phone) Hello... \nJAKE (whispers) I love knowing I'm coming back here. \nJANE (nods, turning slightly) Oh, hi... I slept great. How `bout you? \nJake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back. \n99    INT. FAMILY ROOM - JANE'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT                 99 The Adlers are watching The Graduate. The lights are low. Jake, shoes off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn. Jane sits in a club chair. Harley's on the floor and the Adler Kids are on one long sofa, all covered in a blanket. Jake hands them popcorn then squeezes back in, between the Girls. \nON THE FLAT SCREEN - BUCK HENRY AND DUSTIN HOFFMAN \nBUCK HENERY Are you here for an affair, sir? \nDUSTIN What? \nBUCK HENRY The Singleman party, sir? \nJane cringes as the Kids laugh. She looks over at Jake snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing. He catches Jane's eye and mouths. \nJAKE I'M SO HAPPY!!! \n100   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT - EST.                 100 \n101   INT.

(takes out an armful of Tupperware) \nJAKE Any of that noodle thing left? (Gabby hands it to him.) Where's Mom? She disappeared so fast after the movie. \nGABBY She's probably sleeping. \nLUKE I think she's on her computer. \nThey all nibble out of Tupperware, leaning against various counters. \nJANE And kinda girly. \nADAM (taking it off) Not what I'm going for. (holds up a sweater) Gray sweater. Very old. JANE But cute. \nADAM (slips it on) You sure? You don't have to say you like it just because you nixed the last 20 things. \nJane likes this man. \nJANE Keep it. It's cozy.   Boy, you have a lot of clothes. \nADAM (looks at the floor) Uh, not anymore. Okay, we're almost done. You are helping me so much by the way. \nJANE -- Adam, I really have to pee. \nADAM Oh good. Me too. Meet you back in thirty.... (lifting the laptop) Putting this on my desk.... \nON JANE'S SIDE \nJust a shot of Jane's Pillows on her bed. \nJANE'S VOICE I'm not in there... \nON ADAM'S SIDE - AN ISIGHT FRAME OF AN EMPTY DESK CHAIR. \nADAM'S VOICE Can't hear you. \n103    INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - WIDE - SAME TIME                      103 Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the room. He hears Jane in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly, quickly squirms out of his boxers and T-shirt, then, DROPS HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE -- elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He changes his smile to a smoulder. \nJake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of his privates. He smiles, ready to be discovered. \nJANE \nA104   dries her hands at the bathroom sink.                      A104 \n104    INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME                             104 Adam crosses through the room on his way to his laptop. \n105    JANE ENTERS HER BEDROOM, SEES JAKE and lets out a SCREAM. 105 \nSimultaneously, ADAM PLOPS DOWN IN HIS DESK CHAIR, LOOKS AT HIS SCREEN and instantly YANKS HIMSELF AWAY in disgust. \nADAM Mother of -- (looks again) Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!! \nJake LOOKS DOWN AT THE SCREEN,    SEES ADAM'S SCREAMING FACE AND SCREAMS BACK. \nJANE What are you doing in here?!!! \nADAM (covering the screen with his hands) Get it off!!! \nJAKE (covering himself) I wanted to see you. \nJANE Why are you naked!?! \nJAKE (sits up straight, the lap top shooting even more directly at his groin) Why do you think? \nADAM Okay, I'm gonna be sick. \nJake LEANS IN, covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of course, does nothing. \nADAM Not working! Big close up! \nJANE Knowing how to be divorced is next to impossible... and sometimes over the years, I've thought that your Dad and I weren't quite finished. And, as it turns out, we weren't. So I went out of my comfort zone, which, I found out, if you're really honest with yourself, isn't all that comforting. So, I experimented with a part of myself. I wanted to find out if, after all these years there was still something there between us. \nLAUREN And was there? \nJANE There kinda was. \nLauren smiles with her eyes. \nGABBY But Mom, you have to understand how bonkers this sounds to us. For two people who for years couldn't be in the same room together...to then have an affair??? You and Dad...! \nJANE I know...it was hard for me and I was doing it. I hope you'll forgive me for confusing you or betraying your trust, but I did this for me and for him and I realized even though your Dad and I once had something extraordinary... we no longer really fit together. But he is a part of me and always will be. \nLUKE So it's over now? You guys are back to being divorced. \nJANE For better or for worse. \nLauren takes her Mom's hand. Harley joins them, sitting on the other side of the bed, holding back tears. \nHARLEY Group hug? \nAnd as they all move into hug, we: \nCUT TO: \n126   A MOVING POV - INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY              126 REVERSE ON JANE walking through Adam's firm.    She arrives at: \n127   ADAM'S OFFICE                                              127 Adam is on a phone call. \nADAM (into phone) Yeah no problem...we can definitely do that... (notices Jane) -- James, can I call you back, someone just... Thanks. (rises) Hi. \nJANE Hi. May I come in? \nADAM -- Sure. \nJANE I didn't call you last night because I wasn't sure you would take the call and then I thought that could go on for months and... ADAM -- I would have taken the call. \nJANE Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to say these things in person. Adam, the man I was seeing was... \nADAM I think I'm up to speed on that part. \nJANE I want you to know it didn't last long and you're divorced, so maybe you understand, when marriages end, there's doubts and hurt, and you've got kids and sometimes you wonder if you did the right thing and when the moment presented itself... \nADAM -- I get it. I could imagine it...I could... \nJANE I told him it wasn't going to work between us but I guess he didn't believe me and unbeknownst to me, he showed up at my house yesterday. He left Agness and... \nADAM -- Jane. I actually think I understand what happened but...uh...you know I'm not as macho as I appear and I think it's probably best for us not to get any more... involved because your relationship with Jake isn't really done and I know you're saying it is, but he's in love with you and for everyone's sake, that should probably get resolved. \nJANE Wow.   So that's how grown ups talk. \nAdam smiles. \nJANE Please tell me you're not going to quit my job and ask Peter to take over because then I'll never get to see you and... \nADAM I was thinking of asking Peter to step back in. \nJANE Oh... I hope you don't... \nADAM Thanks. \n", "test1_input": "IT'S COMPLICATED \nWritten by \nNancy Meyers \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MONTECITO, CALIFORNIA - DAY                1 A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara coast line frame this party of old friends.

She knows 50 is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this woman's appearance screams \"solid.\" \nThe years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks, his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his glass of champagne. JAKE Happy happy happy... \nJANE (reminding him) -- Anniversary. \nJake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile. \nJAKE Some things never change. \nSALLY Thank God. \nJANE I thought maybe you were drifting. \nTED He was pausing. \nJAKE Exactly.... (sighs, raising his glass) Happy... Anniversary. You two have led an extraordinarily blessed life. (MORE) JAKE(cont'd) As long as I've known you both, you've always managed to somehow do everything entirely right. \nJANE -- That's so true. \nJAKE But, honestly, how can it be thirty years!?!   When did we do that trip to Spain? (looks to Jane) It was for both of our what..? \nJANE -- Fifteenth anniversaries. \nJAKE God, that was a great trip... \nThe Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21 YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver puts his arm around his Mom. \nJANE Ollie, how was graduation? \nOLIVER It was fantastic. I can't believe I'm not in school anymore. When's Luke's graduation? \nJAKE Next week. \nJANE (correcting him) It's in three days! \nJAKE Sorry!   I mean this week. \nTED Are the girls going? \nJANE They can't wait. Jane glances across the party and sees AGNESS, A FREE SPIRITED PRETTY WOMAN in her thirties, wearing a sarong over a bathing suit and walking directly toward them. She carries a slice of cake. Jane becomes instantly distracted and uncomfortable. \nOLIVER How long is Luke home before he has to go back for work? \nJANE -- Only a week... SALLY Aw, that's it? JANE I know, I hate it. Well...

Lookin' forward to it. \nJANE Good.    Well.... \nAGNESS -- Jane, what are you wearing to the graduation? \nJANE Oh, a suit or dress, probably a suit. \nAGNESS Fancy.    Okay. \nJane smiles tightly, raises her eyebrows to Sally. \nJAKE See you there, Janey.    Where are you staying again? \nJANE We're at The Park Regent. You said you were at The Four Seasons, right? \nJAKE I don't know. (to Agness) Where are we? \nAGNESS We're at The Park Regent too. JANE (hates    this) Oh. Good.     That'll be convenient, actually.     Okay, so, see you soon.. (waves    awkwardly) \nSALLY -- I'll walk you out. \nAs they WALK AWAY, they HEAR: \nAGNESS So, Ted, do you think you can help us get Pedro into El Montecito for kindergarten? \nANGLE - JANE AND SALLY - WALKING INTO HOUSE \nSALLY (laughs) I thought it was sweet how well you and Jake were getting along. Felt like old times. \nJANE Yeah, well, we know how to do this by now. It has been ten years. SALLY That's crazy. \nJane hugs Sally good bye, her eyes landing on Agness affectionately rubbing Jake's back. \nANGLE - THE FRONT DOOR \nas it closes after Jane. \nON JAKE - AS HE TURNS BACK \nand sees Jane is gone. \nCUT TO: \n3   TWENTY-THREE YEAR OLD GABBY                                   3 in jeans and a tank top CARRYING A CARTON OF BOOKS, A YOGA MAT AND A SMALL LAMP. Gabby is Jane and Jake's middle child. But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered from being ignored. Not a possibility with Jane as your mother. We are: \nEXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY \nThe house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in the lush green hills of Santa Barbara. Neat rows of vegetables dot the landscape. \nGabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her OLDER SISTER, LAUREN, 26, is trying to fit everything into the trunk. Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and has an air of maturity about her. \nLAUREN Gabby, stop...you're never going to fit all this in... you can come back for the rest tomorrow. \nGABBY I can't come back t--- \nGabby looks up to see HARLEY, LAUREN'S FIANCE, in a T-shirt and over-the-knee gym shorts, lugging a huge suitcase down the front path, a duffel strapped across his chest. GABBY Oh, God...that's all my clothes. \nHARLEY (sets the suitcase down as he sees an SUV heading to the house) (MORE) HARLEY(cont'd) Okay, your Mom is home. She'll figure this out. \n", "test1_id": 1026, "test2_input": "DIANE Okay. I don't know if this is true, but I read on line about this woman who hadn't done it in so long her vagina closed up. \nJANE What!!!    Get out of here. \nAll the Women SCREAM. \nDIANE I swear to God. It grew back together. \nJOANNE Wait. Was it ever one piece? \nDIANE All I know is, she had to have a vaginaplasty. \nTRISHA Ouch!!!! JANE Oh my Goddddddd. \nJane flops over on the table, laughing, resting her head. JANE (lifts her head, then talks as if she's in the doctor's office) \"Dr. Moss, Hi. I have a little situation that needs fixing....\" \nTRISHA Bubbee, you want to fix your situation? Just date someone. Seriously. Anyone. \nAs Jane takes that in, we: CUT TO: \n16    EXT. THE PARK REGENT HOTEL - NYC - DAY                        16 CAMERA BOOMS DOWN ON Park Avenue to find Jane, the Girls and Harley, just out of a Cab. The Bellman is taking their luggage as the Girls spot their brother, LUKE, heading toward them. \nLauren and Gabby run to Luke, hug him, commenting on his hair, his shoes, his jeans, his tan. Jane lights up when she sees her son, hugs him incredibly hard, kisses his cheek, then another tight squeeze. \nJANE Love when we're all in the same time zone. \nA17   INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER                A17 They all cross THROUGH THE LOBBY toward the RECEPTION DESK. HARLEY So, what's up Luke?      Did you decide to have the party? \nLUKE Oh, yeah.    Big time. JANE What party? \nLUKE Are you guys gonna sleep over? \nLAUREN If you give us your bed and change the sheets. \nThey arrive at THE RECEPTION DESK. \nJANE You're having a party? When? (to Reception Clerk) Hi. Adler. Two rooms...hopefully next to each other. \nRECEPTION CLERK I have an Adler, J. in a Superior Suite, Park Avenue view. Oh, I'm sorry, here it is. Adler J -- two Standard Doubles. Sorry about that. \nJANE Yeah, we're not the ones in the Superior Suite. Have the other Adlers checked in yet? Just wondering. \nRECEPTION CLERK No, they haven't, ma'am. Not yet. Now I just need a credit card and your signature. \nAs Jane takes out her credit card... \nLUKE -- Mom, is it okay if the girls come with me now and help me set up? \nHARLEY And by girls he means the three of us. \nJANE Wait. Hold on. Set up what? I have reservations for all of us for dinner. That's not happening now? \nLUKE I don't know. Me and my friends are having this huge thing at our apartment and the girls said they'd help us set up.. (sees her disappointment) We're going to be together all day tomorrow. \nGABBY -- Mom, it's his last night before graduation. \nJANE Okay, okay.    Do you want me to help or... \nLUKE (super sweetly) -- Love your credit card.... \n", "test2_true": "18   INT. JANE'S ROOM - 20 MINUTES LATER                      18 Two double beds. Jane lies on top of one of the beds, fully dressed, shoes off, eyes wide open. \n20   INT. HOTEL BAR AND RESTAURANT - TOP FLOOR - NIGHT        20 Jane ENTERS the hotel's posh bar/restaurant. JANE (to Host) Hi. Adler. One. \nHOST Hi. Your table's almost ready Mrs. Adler. Would you like to wait at the bar? \nJANE (trying to read upside down reservation list) Sure. You don't happen to have another Adler coming in, do you? Adler for two? \nHOST (perusing) No... You're our only Adler this evening. \nJANE (relieved) Thanks. \nANGLE - THE BAR Jane takes a seat next to Two Hot Younger Women. \nJANE (to Bartender) Pinot Noir, please. No, you know what? I'll have a Tanqueray Martini very dry with a twist. Jane strums the bar top, checks out the room. It's fun being in a big city. Her martini arrives, she takes a sip and HEARS something very familiar. Jake's laugh. She looks across the bar and sees Jake talking to the bartender. He seems to be alone. Jane waves. Jake notices her and smiles. \nJANE Where's your....?? \nJake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next to Jane. \nJAKE Pedro got the stomach flu so I'm flying solo. \nJANE Really? Didn't know you knew how to be by yourself. \nJAKE Any chance you could just go easy on me? Just a one night free pass. (noticing her) You look good, Janey. \nJANE Yeah.... JAKE You do. You always do.   Your hair's shorter. JANE Longer. JAKE I like it. \nThe Host joins them. HOST Mrs. Adler, your table's ready. \nJAKE Want some company, Mrs. Adler? \nJane gives Jake a doubtful look. \nJAKE -- We both have to eat. (sees Jane is hesitating) When's the last time we ate a meal together? \nJANE (thinks for a sec) Just the two of us? Alone?      1999. JAKE So, come on. Once every ten years. \n21   A HALF HOUR LATER                                          21 New drinks arrive for Jane and Jake. Physically, they're sitting as close as they've been in a decade. JANE So...how are things in the fertility world? \nJAKE (checks watch) I can't believe it took you this long to bring that up. \nJANE (trying not to laugh) Sperm issues? \nJAKE Apparently. Yes. \nJANE A baby?! Really Jake? So...the next time you go to a graduation, you'll be what? Fifty-eight plus... (tries to do the math) \nJAKE -- I think the number you're looking for is 79. \nJANE Okay.     So. Seriously, how is that good? \nJAKE Why are we talking about this? I thought we were going to have fun. \nJANE Where'd you get that idea? \n22    A BOTTLE OF WINE IS OPENED                                  22 and poured. The bar has filled up and Jane and Jake are sitting a little closer together. JAKE -- Just tell me, how long were you seeing him for? \nJANE Oh, please, it was five years ago. \n", "test2_id": 1027, "test3_input": "JAKE You've gotten a little nuts. \nJANE (slipping into her robe) Jake, I think it would be really good for us to not talk for a few days. Okay? JAKE (turning back to her) You know what I think -- just for the record? I think we're doing something kinda brilliant. All the things that tore us apart aren't issues anymore. I'd say our problems actually went away. \nJANE What..? JAKE Didn't you always say you felt you weren't being heard? Wasn't that our big issue -- both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated. Look at us now. You're so much more together, you're not exhausted all the time, you're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and I'm calmer, less obsessed about work. I'm a partner. I'm there. We grew into the people we wanted each other to be! And I don't know... I appreciate things about you I couldn't even see before. \nJANE (not wanting to get into it) Really? (MORE) JANE(cont'd) Well, you know, I'm not as good as you at remembering all the details of our... \nJAKE (getting dressed) -- Do you remember never having time for sex? Now look at us. We've already done it two times this week and it's only Tuesday. I swear to God, if half the couples who got divorced, could get back together 10 years later, their problems would be solved. I think we're on to something. \nJANE Not sure I agree and...also, we're not back together. JAKE And I know other divorced people think about this...they wonder - what if.... (fixes his tie) I think this is very French of us. \nJANE How is this French of us? \nJAKE I have a young wife but I'm having sex with my old wife. Not old, you know. Ex! (Jane nods....) I didn't mean old... \n39   Jane tosses Jake his jacket. They EXIT the BEDROOM and head toward THE FRONT DOOR. \nJAKE You're doing that thing where you act like you're not listening... but think about what I'm saying, okay? (then) Do you have any of your homemade granola here? I haven't had it in so long. \nJANE You miss it? \nJAKE So much. \nJANE We sell it for $6.50 a bag at the store. \nJAKE Yeah, why give it away when you can... (Jane OPENS the front door and moves him outside) Kiss good bye? \nJane kisses him on the cheek. \nJAKE She wants to be courted! (as he heads for his car) I can do that! (turns back) And honey, thanks for the.... (indicates sex with his fingers) -- Coffee.... \nJane can't close the door fast enough. \n40   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                40 Jane carries three beautiful homemade pies, arriving in THE LIVING ROOM where her Friends are gathered. Platters of food and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table. \nTRISHA Oh my God, now what?   Three pies?! This is a feast! \nJANE I don't know what's going on, I have so much energy lately which I think is probably a result of... all the sex I'm having. (the Ladies LAUGH) Yeah. I'm actually not kidding. I'm having an affair. (They stare at her) With a married man. \nDIANE What? When did this happen? Where'd you meet him? \nJANE Well, it... started in New York. \nDIANE In New York??? Last week? \nJANE Yeah, we did it once there and once here. Maybe more than once there, I was drunk so... \nTRISHA You had drunken sex with a married man in New York when you went for Luke's graduation? \nJANE (laughs, embarrassed) Turns out I'm a bit of a slut. (re: pies) Apple, Blueberry or Plum? DIANE Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.... You're not saying!!!! \nJOANNE (clueless) -- What? \nTRISHA (catching on) No! You're not! \nJANE Oh, God, but I am. I'm having an affair with Agness Adler's husband. \nThe Women all SCREAM as Jane fans herself. \n", "test3_true": "JOANNE But also sort of wrong. \nJANE I know. \nDIANE Oh, please. Not that wrong. \nJANE I know! I'm so happy to be able to tell someone. This is the most out of control thing I've ever done. Literally. You know me. \nDIANE Yes we do. You don't do anything wrong, or bad. Ever. So you're allowed this one. I'm sorry ... I kinda love it. \nJOANNE He was yours first. \nJANE True. Not that I want him back by the way. \nTRISHA Of course not. You can do better than Jake. \nJANE (a little insulted) Thanks. \nTRISHA I mean you've outgrown him. You've blossomed, you feng shuied your whole life... Just please, don't let him talk you into saving him. \nJANE I won't... (wonders what that means) \nDIANE There is something kinda perfect about this. You don't have to cook for him or clean up after him or actually even sleep with him.... \nJANE Yeah, I have an Ex with benefits... \nJANE (CONT'D) But, girls, what about the fact that I'm now the other woman? I'm the one we hate. \nTRISHA Oh, forget that.    Agness is still the one we hate.    Even in this scenario. \nDIANE Yeah, karma is the ultimate bitch on this one. \n41   INT. BAKERY KITCHEN - DAY                                 41 Jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper. Her shirt is a little more fitted. Her make up, a little prettier. She crosses to the head Baker who's just taking a tray of cookies out of the oven. JANE Reynaldo, I'm changing the breakfast menu, want to give it a little more life... (shows it to him, he seems distracted) What do you think? \nREYNALDO (distracted) -- What'd you do? Something to your hair? \nJANE I don't think so. \nREYNALDO Something about you looks different. Little more \"caliente.\" JANE Caliente? \nAnother Chef in the kitchen nods in agreement. \nREYNALDO You see it Eddie? \nEDDIE Whatever it is, it's workin'. \nHe winks at Jane as he stirs cookie batter.    Jane blushes as her cell phone rings. \nJANE Hello. (listens) No! I didn't do this again! \n42   EXT. JANE'S OPEN FIELD   - LATE DAY                         42 CAMERA MOVES IN on Adam, waiting by a ladder in the middle of the field. Jane's addition is staked out with orange tape. REVERSE - ON JANE \nRushing toward Adam. \nJANE Adam, I'm so sorry.   My mind is just... Forgive me. \nADAM If I were your shrink I'd say maybe you don't really want to build this house. \nJANE That's completely not true.   I'm really sorry. (looks at taped off addition) Oh! I like it already! ADAM Yeah, it's feeling really good. So, this becomes your office. We come down your new hallway, the windows are all along here... JANE Great. Love it. ADAM And from here to there...wait, let me get the door for you... (opens a piece of tape) Your kitchen. (they ENTER) We're in the eating area. How's the size?

Thought it was your cousin...but... \nHarley falls silent as he SEES JANE ENTER THE HOTEL AND CROSS TO THE RECEPTION DESK. After a sec, she's pointed toward the same elevator. HARLEY Ohhhh my sweet Lord.... \nLAUREN (looks up from her salad) Now what? \nHARLEY Honey, I totally forgot I have a conference call at 1:15, I gotta get back to the office. Waiter! Honey, stop eating, get the waiter. Call the one over there. (pointing her away from Jane) \nLAUREN Harley, we can't leave, we're meeting with the Wedding Specialist. \nHARLEY (watches as Jake waits for Jane around the corner) Yeah, you know what? Today's not a good idea to do that. (Sees Jane join Jake, they step into the elevator and immediately fall into each other's arms and kiss) Oh my God...!!! \n61   INT. JAKE AND JANE'S HOTEL ROOM - UPSTAIRS - SAME TIME      61 The curtains are drawn,   the lights are low. Jane, in a hotel robe, slips a cd in the   cd player and we hear a mellow song, perfect for love in the   afternoon. The Bathroom Door OPENS and Jake EXITS, also in   a hotel robe. \nJane stands across the room from him. They smile at one another. From behind, we see Jane untie her robe, letting it fall to the floor. Jake looks at her, from head to toe and back. They smile at one another, then something comes over Jake. His eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses against the wall. \nJANE Jake!!! \n62   INT. LOBBY CAFE - SAME TIME                                 62 The Hotel's Wedding Specialist has joined Lauren and Harley's table. She holds a binder filled with photos. Harley is a mess, knowing what's going on upstairs. \nWEDDING SPECIALIST I adore October weddings. Let me show you what we did last October. \nShe opens her Book of Photos for Lauren. Lauren gasps. \nHARLEY (rising) Honey, I'm gonna make that phone call from the... \nLauren and the Wedding Specialist don't look up and don't hear him. They keep talking to each other. \nHARLEY (nods) -- Okay. Good. You just keep doing that and I'll... They still don't look up. Harley nervously HEADS FOR THE LOBBY when he spots the HOTEL DOCTOR, bag in hand, arriving at the Reception Desk. \nHOTEL DOC What's the room number? \nRECEPTION CLERK 408. Adler. His wife said he's conscious now... \nHOTEL DOC (taking off) On my way. \nHarley stops in his tracks, freaking.   Adler??? \n63   INT. JANE AND JAKE'S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER           63 Jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure cuff around his arm. Jane, still in her robe, paces. The Hotel Doc sits on a chair next to Jake's side of the bed. \nHOTEL DOC Your blood pressure's good. \nJANE How's his heart? \nHOTEL DOC Do you have a heart condition, Mr. Adler? \nJAKE No.   And I just had a check up. \nJANE You did?   Oh, that's good. \nHOTEL DOC (listening to his heart) Deep breath. So, no chest pain? \nJAKE None. \nHOTEL DOC When you got dizzy, did you feel your heart was beating funny? \n", "test1_true": "Jane holds up her weak eyelid. \nHOTEL DOC -- Well that's nice to hear after all these years... (winds up his stethoscope) Did you forget to take any of your medications today? \nJAKE Took `em all. \nHOTEL DOC What all did you take? JAKE Uh....Lipitor, baby aspirin.. (whispers) Flomax. \nJANE (sitting on the bed) Flomax? \nJAKE (embarrassed) Yes, otherwise I pee 40 times a day. \nHOTEL DOC How long have you been taking the Flomax? \nJAKE Not that long. And I only take it sporadically. I have to sneak it actually. (explains confidentially) It reduces semen and that's not good for my wife right now. (to Jane) Sorry. \nHOTEL DOC (looks over at Jane) Really..? \nJANE Yes, I prefer a lot of semen. Always have. (rises) Okay, well, thank you so much for coming. Looks like he's gonna live, so... \nHOTEL DOC (packing up) Yeah, my guess is Flomax is probably the culprit here. It can definitely give you a sudden drop in blood pressure so I suggest you stay off it for a few weeks, which apparently your wife will appreciate. (holds in a chuckle) \nJANE Yeah.   Really good for me. \nThe Doctor snaps his bag shut, rises. \nHOTEL DOC And I suggest you rest quietly for the rest of the afternoon. (to Jane) No hanky panky, Mrs. Adler. \nJANE No chance. I assure you. \n64   INT. LOBBY                                                64 Harley sits on a bench with his head between his legs. Lauren arrives, joins him on the bench. \nLAUREN Are you acting like this because of the wedding? Tell me the truth? \nHARLEY (head down) Not at all. Swear to God. \nLAUREN Because I don't want to be one of those couples where the guy goes into a coma the whole time we plan the wedding. It's not worth it to me. \nHarley looks up, sees the Hotel Doc walk by the Reception Clerk. The Doc gives her a wink and a \"thumbs up\" and keeps on walking. \nHARLEY (deep sigh, rises) Okay! We're back in business! \n65   OPRAH - CLOSE - ON TV                                    65 In Jane and Jake's room. \nREVERSE - JANE AND JAKE \nSitting up in bed, in their robes, watching Oprah and eating chicken soup on trays. Jake reaches for the salt. Jane eases it away from him. Jake looks over at Jane, oozing with love and appreciation. \nJAKE See. Just that move...you have no idea. Not everyone's like that... \nJANE (mutes Oprah, then:) Jake, I have a confession to make. Back when we broke up... I knew it wasn't all your fault. \nJAKE You mean that?   You've never said that to me before. JANE I know. Because when you cheated, I didn't have to. But I think in some way, I gave up on us and I'm not sure you ever really did. \nJAKE I still haven't. \nJake takes Jane's hand. She looks down at his wedding ring, then turns her eyes back to Oprah. A beat, then: \nJANE Are you and Agness... still having sex? \n", "test1_id": 1026, "test2_input": "Jake doesn't answer.    Jane turns, looks right at him. \nJAKE Only if she initiates it. \nJane GROANS. JAKE I'm trying not to rock the boat at home until you and I figure this out. (sees her reaction) This is a little trickier at my end than yours. \nJANE Right. Yeah. Okay.... (rises...) Now I know you're gonna think I'm leaving because of what you just said, but I'm not. I really have to get back to work. \nJAKE (takes Jane's hand) We got really close there for a moment. \nShe knows he's right. Jane's Cell RINGS.     She lets it ring again, then answers it. \nJANE (into phone) Hello? \n66   ADAM - AT HIS OFFICE                                        66 ADAM (into phone) Hi, hope I'm not interrupting anything. \nINTERCUT JANE AND ADAM \nJANE Adam! Oh!     Hi. \nJake is instantly jealous.   He rises, crosses to the closet, starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very engaged by Adam. \nADAM I just found out there's a French Film Festival in town and that made me think of you so I was wondering if you'd like to go to the opening night tomorrow night. (a little nervous... will she accept?) \nJANE Oh, that sounds so fun... (Jake rolls his eyes) Let me think, tomorrow's what? \nJAKE (desperate, whispers) -- Say you're busy. Agness has a dinner thing tomorrow, I can come over. (Jane hesitates) Please. \nJANE Oh, um, you know, I'd really love to, but, my son is coming home from college the next day and I have a bunch of things I have to do to get ready... (hates lying, Jake crosses to her, smiles) I'm so sorry. \nADAM No, don't worry. No problem. Maybe we can see something another night. \nJANE Absolutely. I would love that. Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her. \n67   ADAM HANGS UP                                              67 We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets. He looks at them then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker. \nADAM Melanie, how would you and your husband like two tickets to the opening of the French Film Festival? Reserved seats...VIP parking... \nFEMALE WORKER Seriously? \n68   INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              68 Jane and Jake are finishing getting dressed, moving about, putting on shoes, blouses, ties, jackets, belts... JAKE You'll make the whole thing?    The roast chicken, the--- \nJANE -- mashed potatoes, sauteed string beans and double fudge chocolate cake. I know your favorite dinner, Jakey. \nJAKE (touched) You haven't called me Jakey in 10 years. This has been a great day for us. So, do we have a date? JANE (fixes Jake's hair) We have a date. Jake grabs his heart. Jane leans on him, a smile on her face as we begin to HEAR MUSIC. \n69   EXT. JANE'S PATIO -    LATE DAY - MUSIC OVER                 69 Music plays from the outdoor speakers. Jane sets the table in her courtyard. She's singing along with the music. \n70   A PERFECT CAKE - MUSIC OVER                                  70 sits on the Kitchen Counter. Jane finishes off icing the cake like the pro she is then peeks into the oven, looks at her perfect roast chicken. \n71   OMIT                                                         71 \n72   INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - MUSIC OVER                             72 Jane clips the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off its hanger. \n73   A CLOCK ON A NIGHT STAND                                     73 tells us it's 8:45. \nON JAKE \nHis eyes glued to the clock. We are IN JAKE AND AGNESS' BEDROOM. Jake and Agness lie on their bed, both doing paper work. Pedro is asleep between them. Jake gets up, slipping his cell into his hand. AGNESS (not looking at him) Why are you taking your cell to the bathroom? \n", "test2_true": "AGNESS Carry him to his bed, will you? \nJake carefully lifts Pedro off the bed. \nAGNESS (while reading) And hurry back. I'm ovulating. \nJAKE You are? \nAGNESS Why do you think I cancelled my dinner? \nAgness pulls her t-shirt over her head... she is gorgeous. \n74   INT. PEDRO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               74 Jake gently lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers. Pedro takes Jake's hand, holds it to his chest, looking up at him. Jake offers a comforting smile and Pedro closes his eyes. \nJake sits on the bed and lets Pedro fall back asleep, holding onto his hand. \n75   EXT. JANE'S PATIO - NIGHT                                  75 Candles are lit on the table, but are now low. The table is set with flowers from the garden. The wine has not been opened. CAMERA CRANES to FIND Jane INSIDE THE KITCHEN, still dressed for dinner and deep in thought. She then sighs very deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by room, the house becomes dark. \n76   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY - 6 P.M.                  76 The Kids cars are in the driveway. \n77   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME                        77 Jane, Gabby, Lauren and Harley are in the kitchen, cooking, setting the table, opening wine, chatting. \nLAUREN -- Oh, Mom, I keep forgetting to tell you about our meeting at The Stanhope. We went there for lunch two days ago and met with their Wedding Specialist....I think that could be the place, Mom.... JANE Two days ago you went to The Stanhope...for lunch? HARLEY Yes and guess what?    We saw nothing. Jane and Harley connect.    He immediately looks away. LAUREN What is that supposed to mean? HARLEY Who wants wine? Anyone? (starts pouring) GABBY (looking in the fridge) Mom, you have an insane amount of food in here, even for you. \nJANE (taking out last night's roast chicken) I knew you were all going to be here for the weekend so I made a bunch of stuff last night. \nLAUREN Looks like Jake Adler's favorite meal to me. \nJANE (laughs) Very funny. \nHARLEY Very. Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn HONK. Jane LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and sees JAKE'S PORSCHE PULL UP with Luke in the passenger seat. The Girls rush out the Kitchen door. Harley sees Jake getting out of the car and pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him. JANE Harley? Just then, Luke enters and Jane lights up. JANE Yay!!!! (hugs Luke) \nLUKE (surveying all the food) Mom, this looks amazing. \nHarley and Luke hug, talk the talk. `Sup? Yo... \nJAKE (sheepishly joins the group, eyes on Jane) Hi. \nJANE (briskly) Hey. \nHarley takes a huge gulp of his wine. JAKE (holding Luke's backpack) Where should I put this...? \nJANE (turns her back on him, making herself busy) Wherever. \nHarley watches their interaction tennis match style. Jake looks at the table set for five, wishes he was joining them. He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs. Jane slices the roast chicken. \nJAKE That looks incredible. Jane looks up at him, knife poised.    Is he kidding? \nJANE Thanks. \nShe goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg. Jake flinches. \nHARLEY Jake?   Glass of wine? \nJAKE Uh, sure.    Thanks. \nHARLEY Jane? \nJANE (not looking up) No thank you. \n", "test2_id": 1027, "test3_input": "JANE (explains) Cooking scar.... From a very hot batch of caramel... \nADAM Ooooo. What about that one? \nJANE That one's from boiling sugar...I wasn't very skilled in the beginning.    And that one is from a large French... \nAdam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar. \nJANE -- Saute pan. \nAdam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as Adam moves closer. \nADAM Would it be okay if I...? \nJane nods.    He kisses her great. \nADAM I was going to say, kiss you. \nJANE I figured. \nADAM If you feel this is in any way wrong because we're working together... \nJANE ... I don't ... \nHe smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and kiss again. \n94   OMIT                                                         94 \nINT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice.\" Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt and boxers. JANE Hey sleepy! What time did you get in? \nLUKE Have no idea. Lauren and Harley drove me home. \nLAUREN (joining) I'm surprised you remember that. \nJANE (turns to see Lauren) Hi. I didn't know you slept here. \nLauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top, takes out a box of cereal. \nLAUREN We were playing Scattagories with Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell asleep on the couch. \nHarley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt. \nLUKE Sweet. \nHARLEY I got cold in the middle of the night. \nLauren and Jane laugh. \nJANE Okay, who wants what? (noticing Gabby entering) Hi baby... GABBY (looks out the front window) What's Dad doing here? \nEveryone LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and SEES Jake sitting in his Porsche. \n96   EXT. FRONT PORCH                                             96 Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's had a rough night and has something on his mind. Jane cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are all open. \nJANE (quietly) Everything okay? \nJAKE I left Agness. \nJANE No, don't say that. \n", "test3_true": "JANE Saw what? \nJAKE That I'm still in love with you.   I admitted it, I told her about us and I've left her. For you. \nJANE No, no, no.... What do you mean??? Jake, this is crazy! (worried the kids will hear, whispers) Are you telling me the truth? \nJAKE (nods) This feels so right Jane. \nAs Jane is about to respond, Gabby EXITS the house in her PJ's, looking confused. \nGABBY (from the porch) What's going on? \nJANE Nothing. Honey, set the table, I'll be right in. \nGABBY Mom, you're the only one who cares if the table's set. \nJANE Okay, then do it for me....just go in please. \nLuke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch. LUKE What's up, Dad? \nJAKE Having some problems on the home front, just wanted to talk to your Mom for a sec. \nJane shakes her head.    Why did he have to say that?   Harley joins the Kids. LAUREN Problems on the home front?   Is one of you seeing someone else? \nHearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake. \nJAKE (off Jane's cue) No, it's nothing like that. I just need to find a hotel or something for a few days `til I get my head together. \nGABBY It's that serious? \nJake nods. \nLUKE Mom, can Dad stay here for a few days? He can share my room. \nJANE I don't think that's the best idea, Luke. \nGABBY Daddy, are you crying? \n93   ON JAKE - TEARS WELLING UP                                 93 He turns away from the kids.

FRONT PORCH DINING AREA - A LITTLE LATER              97 Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been lifted. His energy is in full bloom. \nJAKE Mommy's the best cook in the world! \n98   EXT. VEGETABLE GARDEN - LATER THAT DAY                     98 Jane is working in the garden. A shadow falls over her.    She looks up, Jake stands before her, a cute smile breaking across his face. \nJAKE Thank you for saving me Janey. \nJANE Jake, you knew the kids were all here. Shouldn't we have talked about this? Agreed this was the right thing to do? This is so typical. Only thinking about works for you. \nJAKE I'm sorry, I guess I should've called before showing up. \nJANE -- And I'm not sure you even left Agness. Maybe she saw something last night and threw you out... \n", "test3_id": 1028}

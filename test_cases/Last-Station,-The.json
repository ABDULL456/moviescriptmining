NIGHT.                   30 \nSofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining room. Valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea. \nSOFYA I see a fine young man before me. Clear eyes. Nice features, rather handsome in a peculiar way. \nVALENTIN Thank you, Countess... \nSOFYA Call me Sofya Andreyevna. We don't stand on formality here, as you may have observed. (beat) Many young men ruin their looks by loose living. You're a real Tolstoyan, I can tell! \nVALENTIN I admire your husband immensely. \nSOFYA That's excellent. He likes that. \nVALENTIN His ideas are beautiful...social justice...the idea...Don't you think? \nSofya drains her tea cup, signals for more. \nSOFYA He's very grateful for the help you've been giving him. He told me so himself. I think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent. When he was your age, he was whoring in the Caucasus. \nValentin's eyes are wide. She nods. \nSOFYA He wrote it all down. He even gave me a copy, so I could read all the details... \nVALENTIN Thank you. \nSOFYA You've read War and Peace? \nVALENTIN Many times... twice. \nSofya smiles at his honesty. \nSOFYA When he was writing it, long before Chertkov created that monstrosity at Telyatinki, before all this \"new religion\" and revolutionary nonsense... (beat) What do you think of Chertkov, by the way? \nVALENTIN He's given me an extraordinary opportunity. \nSOFYA But you see what a fool he is, a self-serving puritanical idiot. I have to say, it's been extremely pleasant since they've locked him in his house. \nSofya smiles. Valentin is nonplussed by her directness. \nSOFYA When my husband was writing it, in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me pages to re-copy everyday. I was the only one who could read his handwriting. I could read his intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd drink tea and discuss changes. \"Natasha wouldn't say that to Prince Andrey,\" or \"Pierre's too simple here. He's not stupid.\" \nShe smiles at the memory. \nSOFYA But I don't count anymore. \nSilence. She sips her tea. She glances out the door to see Sasha hovering nearby. Listening? Sasha walks away. \nSOFYA You must help me, Valentin Fedorovich. I want only what is best for my husband and my family. I could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me What I can not do is sit back while they steal my children's inheritance. Do you know I was the only person. I could understand his intention. \nVALENTIN I don't believe anyone wants to do that. \nSofya gives him a condescending smile.

You've been listening to your friends at Telyatinki... (beat) Write what you see. That's always the place to begin. (slowly) What. You.

A number of the disciples are outside working. There is the ringing of metal on wood. He looks for the source. As the way clears a little, he sees Masha chopping away with an axe. He stops his horse to watch her. \nMASHA You're finished for the day? \nVALENTIN He didn't need me this afternoon. \nHe gets down off his horse. Masha continues to chop. He picks up an axe, holds it awkwardly. \nVALENTIN Leo Nikolayevich disapproves of women doing physical labor. (beat) Don't you find that reactionary? \nMASHA No, I find it sweet. I find you reactionary. \nShe laughs. Valentin picks up a log, sets it on end and begins to chop. He doesn't do it well. Masha smiles at his struggle. \nMASHA He admires you, I believe. \nWhat's she saying? \nMASHA Sergeyenko told me. He's miserable about it. \nVALENTIN Tolstoy's kind to everyone. \nThe log is stuck to the blade of his axe. He's really struggling now. \nMASHA What do you talk about when you're with him? (beat) Why are you blushing? \nVALENTIN We talk about me. \nMASHA Really. \nVALENTIN He wants to know everything about me, my parents, my relations with women, my experience of god - \nHe looks up to see Masha smiling at him. \nMASHA And what relations are these? \nValentin blushes, goes back to trying to chopping. Almost immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe. He bangs it, bangs it trying to free it. He glances up to see her still looking at him. He pounds again and again. \nShe stops, reaches for his axe, touching him as she does. She lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head, bringing it down hard. The log splits. She hands the axe to him. \nMASHA I had a lover before I came here... headmaster of a school where I taught. He was married - happily married. It was difficult. We could make love only at school. \nThis is somehow more than Valentin had bargained for. \nVALENTIN At school? \nMASHA In the gymnasium, after the girls had gone. There were straw mats on the floor. \nVALENTIN I see... \nHe looks away to hide his confusion. \nMASHA Have I upset you? \nHe looks at her. \nVALENTIN No...I appreciate your frankness \nMASHA But you disapprove of me.

And now we have to put up with her petty grasping. \nVALENTIN It doesn't seem petty to me. \nCHERTKOV I beg your pardon? \nVALENTIN He`s her life. The work, in her mind, is theirs...together. \nCHERTKOV And you're her advocate? You've been taken in by her celebrity.

An ominous silence. \nCHERTKOV I have another task for you, my dear. \nVALENTIN Please. \nCHERTKOV You'll keep a diary for me. \nHe hands Valentin a notebook. \nCHERTKOV I need to know everything that goes on at Yasnaya Polyana. Let me know who visits the house, any talk of the copyright to his work, any contact with the church, what letters come and go.

TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. MORNING.       11 \nWhere Tolstoy, awake and dressed, sits on his bed, pen in hand, writing in his diary. Dushan sits next to him, taking his pulse. \nTOLSTOY Nothing's working... Hand me my other boot, my friend, will you? \nDUSHAN Let me finish. \nTOLSTOY It doesn't matter. If my heart had stopped beating, I'd still go riding today. \nDUSHAN Your pulse is my responsibility... (MORE) \nDUSHAN (cont'd) and if you must ride, I insist you wear a coat. Even the sun is cold today. \nHe puts Tolstoy's arm down and hands him his riding boot. Sofya comes ranting into the room carrying several Russian and international dailies. \nSOFYA This is impossible! It really is! These people are parasites! Look... (reading) \"Countess Tolstoy has become estranged from her husband. They barely speak.\" \nShe throws the paper on the floor. \nSOFYA You know who spreads all this rubbish.... \nShe opens another paper, a French daily. \nSOFYA C'est la meme en France. They gossip about us in Paris... \"They do not share a similar view of either religion or politics.\" Incroyable! \nTOLSTOY (smiling) Peut-etre. You think that's inaccurate? \nSOFYA I think it's none of the world's business. \nShe looks at Dushan who is transcribing every word into his diary. He does it with all the master's conversations. \nSOFYA What are you doing? Don't do that. \nTOLSTOY (smiling) Dushan Petrovich, you're scribbling again? \nTolstoy moves with energy and purpose toward the door. \nSOFYA Darling, where are you going? \nTOLSTOY Riding with Sasha. Don't expect us for lunch. \nSeven miles from Tolstoy's estate, this is Telyatinki, a communal center created by Chertkov dedicated to the study and practice of Tolstoyism. \nSERGEYENKO Telyatinki was created by Vladimir Grigorevich as a center for the movement. Just last week we had a visitor from India. We talked to the group about the healing properties of cobra venum. \nVALENTIN Oh, goodness..It's a beautiful day. \nSERGEYENKO Yes, but we will pay for it. \nSergeyenko, Chertkov's joyless secretary, and Valentin stand on a second storey porch looking out across the central lawn where a number of young Tolstoyans tend the garden, work to put up a chicken coop. \nSERGEYENKO The meeting room is behind us. This is the tool shed. The dormitory ahead. \nHe points out a larger building across the way. \n17   INT. TELYATINKI. SLEEPING AREA. NIGHT.                  17 \nThey enter the building. \nSERGEYENKO Telyatinki is a place of freedom. Nothing is forbidden here. \nExcept everything. \nSERGEYENKO Each man is alone with his conscience and his God. (beat) The kitchen is below. You'll be expected to assist with meals at least twice a week ...and to give a hand in the garden. We're all equals here, you know...as Tolstoy teaches us. \nThey start up the stairs. \nINT.

VALENTIN'S ROOM: NIGHT                      18 \nSmall, sparse, perfect for the novice ascetic.   Valentin nods his approval. \nSERGEYENKO Vladimir Grigorevich is anxious that you begin your reports as soon as possible. You have the notebook he gave you? \nVALENTIN Of course. \nSERGEYENKO You understand we must keep the existence of the diary a secret. \nValentin smiles. \nSERGEYENKO What is it? \nVALENTIN Just that...secrecy doesn't seem to me the essence of Tolstoy's thought. \nSERGEYENKO But you'll admit, you're no expert. \nVALENTIN Yes, I...I'll see you in the morning. \nSERGEYENKO If we're spared. \nSergeyenko leaves Valentin to his bare, little room. \n19   EXT. TELYATINKI COMPOUND. MORNING.                           19 \nThe sun rising. Already, disciples are at work the gardens. \n20   INT. TELYATINKI. VALENTIN'S ROOM. MORNING.                   20 \nValentin sleeps in his tiny room. A knock on the door. \nVALENTIN Come in. \nA lovely girl at his door. She's tall, twenties, high cheek bones, short blonde hair. This is MASHA. \nMASHA I've brought you a glass of tea. \nVALENTIN That's very kind of you. \nMASHA It's your first day. Enjoy it. \nTolstoy nods. \nTOLSTOY I've become convinced that all the world's religions have a single organizing principle. Can you guess what it is? Love! Love! Simple... Now, I want to talk about you. How are you? How was your journey? Come, sit down. \nTolstoy sits on the old sofa. Valentin follows suit. \nTOLSTOY You know, I was born on this sofa... \nValentin gets right back up. Tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa. \nTOLSTOY Sit. Sit. \nValentin sits down. \nTOLSTOY Myself, my brother, my children, at least five or six of them, right here. (beat) Now, I've read your essays. How`s your work progressing? \nValentin looks into the great man's kind old face. He tries to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep. \nTOLSTOY My boy, what is it? (beat) I upset you in some way. Was it the sofa? It's only a sofa. \nValentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears. \nVALENTIN I'm very happy. You are very kind. I'm no one and you are... you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask me about my work. \nTolstoy takes Valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa. \nTOLSTOY You rest for a moment and I'll fetch you a glass of tea. Rest, because there's work for both of us together. \nHe smiles and goes, leaving Valentin to contemplate his fortune. \n25   OMITTED                                                       25 \n26   OMITTED                                                       26 \n27   OMITTED                                                       27 \n28   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY.                           28 \nSofya, Sasha, Valentin, ANDREY, Tolstoy's son, and Tolstoy all clustered around a table taking tea. Dushan stands near the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small table. \nSOFYA These people have nothing. \nDUSHAN It really is the most extraordinary thing. \nAbsolutely ignoring him. \nSOFYA It's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty. They have no will power and they drink too much. \nTOLSTOY I'm not suggesting they be given land. Private property is the root of the problem... We should be giving ours away. \nANDREY Give it to whom? \nSOFYA It's all ridiculous. You think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior. \nTOLSTOY I believe that wealth corrupts us all, yes I do. \nA pause.   Valentin fills the silence. \nVALENTIN It's a keystone of the movement. \nSOFYA Oh, I know all about the movement. \nA pause. Valentin notices that people from the front lawn have moved up to watch all this. Life in the fishbowl, the Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care. \nTOLSTOY If the peasants had money, they wouldn't surround themselves, as we do, with footmen costing ten rubles a month. \nSOFYA No, they'd spend it on drink and whores. \nTOLSTOY Valentin Fedorovich, do you think fifty years from now, people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot? \nValentin doesn't know what to say. A giggle from Dushan. \nDUSHAN Oh, that's good...that's good. \nDushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get down Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table. Sofya flushes with anger. \nVALENTIN I think...(sneeze) \nSASHA (irritated) God bless you. \nVALENTIN I'm sorry. Sometimes I sneeze when I'm nervous. \nShe regards him like an animal in the zoo. Ivan appears at the door. \nSASHA What is it? \nIVAN It\u00b4s a note, for him. \nHe nods toward Valentin. \nSASHA Well, give it to him then. \nValentin reads the note. \nVALENTIN It\u00b4s from your mother. She wants to see me. \nAs Valentin goes, \nSASHA She is looking for allies. Pay attention. This is war. \n30   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.                   30 \nSofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining room. Valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea. \nSOFYA I see a fine young man before me. Clear eyes. Nice features, rather handsome in a peculiar way. \nVALENTIN Thank you, Countess... \nSOFYA Call me Sofya Andreyevna. We don't stand on formality here, as you may have observed. (beat) Many young men ruin their looks by loose living. You're a real Tolstoyan, I can tell! \nVALENTIN I admire your husband immensely. \nSOFYA That's excellent. He likes that. \nVALENTIN His ideas are beautiful...social justice...the idea...Don't you think? \nSofya drains her tea cup, signals for more. \nSOFYA He's very grateful for the help you've been giving him. He told me so himself. I think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent. When he was your age, he was whoring in the Caucasus. \nValentin's eyes are wide. She nods. \nSOFYA He wrote it all down. He even gave me a copy, so I could read all the details... \nVALENTIN Thank you. \nSOFYA You've read War and Peace? \nVALENTIN Many times... twice. \nSofya smiles at his honesty. \nSOFYA When he was writing it, long before Chertkov created that monstrosity at Telyatinki, before all this \"new religion\" and revolutionary nonsense... (beat) What do you think of Chertkov, by the way? \nVALENTIN He's given me an extraordinary opportunity. \nSOFYA But you see what a fool he is, a self-serving puritanical idiot. I have to say, it's been extremely pleasant since they've locked him in his house. \nSofya smiles. Valentin is nonplussed by her directness. \nSOFYA When my husband was writing it, in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me pages to re-copy everyday. I was the only one who could read his handwriting. I could read his intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd drink tea and discuss changes. \"Natasha wouldn't say that to Prince Andrey,\" or \"Pierre's too simple here. He's not stupid.\" \nShe smiles at the memory. \nSOFYA But I don't count anymore. \nSilence. She sips her tea. She glances out the door to see Sasha hovering nearby. Listening? Sasha walks away. \nSOFYA You must help me, Valentin Fedorovich. I want only what is best for my husband and my family. I could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me What I can not do is sit back while they steal my children's inheritance. Do you know I was the only person. I could understand his intention. \nVALENTIN I don't believe anyone wants to do that. \nSofya gives him a condescending smile. She produces a package from the table beside her, hands it to him. \nSOFYA I have a little gift for you \nVALENTIN I don't. Not at all...I think sexual activity...how men and women combine their physical parts is completely neutral. \nMASHA Listen to you. You're a prig. Just like Sergeyenko. Why else would they have hired you? \nVALENTIN That's not fair \nMASHA I don't care if it's fair. It's true...neutral...my God... \nVALENTIN I'm going. \nHe puts down the axe. \nMASHA Do as you like. \nShe goes back to chopping. We track in front of him as he walks toward the house. The chopping stops. \nMASHA Valentin Fedorovich. \nHe stops, relieved and turns to face her. \nMASHA You forgot your horse. \nVALENTIN Yes. You know, I think that I... never mind. \nHe hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. Her back is to him. She begins to chop again. The color rises in his face as he tries to salvage a little dignity. \nHe grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings, trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. Red faced, he rights himself. The chopping behind him remains constant. Sergeyenko watches him from the porch. \n32    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY                           32 \nCLOSE on the CABLE MACHINE.

I was distracted I think...I had a dream last night, about a Tartar girl I knew in the war. \nVALENTIN A girl who died? \nTOLSTOY No, no...A girl I had sexual intercourse with... Sometimes we did it twice a day. \nValentin sneezes. \nTOLSTOY God bless...I've never forgotten our time together, the position of our bodies, the taste of her... \nVALENTIN You shouldn't torture yourself. It was a long time ago. \nTolstoy laughs out loud. \nTOLSTOY Torture? You are a virgin, aren't you. \nVALENTIN I try to...you know, to... \nTOLSTOY To be what, a good Tolstoyan? \nTolstoy smiles. \nTOLSTOY You see, I myself am not a very good Tolstoyan. You should think twice about asking my advice about anything... Torture... (he laughs) \nVALENTIN Are you alright? \nTOLSTOY Kalya, her name was...She's an old woman now, white hair, old body like me. She'd hardly remember my name, I suspect. She may even be dead. (beat) Do you think that meant something? \nVALENTIN What do you mean? \nTOLSTOY I mean that little romance. Was there some meaning to it? \nCHERTKOV Sofya Andreyevna, I'm happy to see you. \nValentin watches her match him smile for smile.                    * \nSOFYA And I'm happy to make you happy...always. \n40   OMITTED                                                       40 \n41   EXT.

How do you think you're getting on? \nVALENTIN (a little nervous) I hope my work is pleasing to Leo Nikolayevich. \nCHERTKOV Yes. He seems satisfied and that's good. The reports I've received from you however... There seems to be some confusion. \nVALENTIN What do you mean? \nCHERTKOV You send me never ending commentary on Tolstoy's writing. That's all very interesting but not very useful. I need to know what goes on with Sofya Andreyevna. You must see by now she's committed to undermining her husband's best intentions. \nVALENTIN It's not quite so obvious to me. \nCHERTKOV Because she is duplicitous. You are very bright. Too bright to let her into you. \nChertkov fixes the boy with his intense gaze. \nCHERTKOV You value our work? \nVALENTIN I do. \nCHERTKOV The ideals we share? \nVALENTIN That's why I'm here. \nCHERTKOV Good, of course it is. (beat) Do you think the Countess suspects something? \nVALENTIN Well, I think the Countess is very suspicios by nature. \nCHERTKOV How so? \nVALENTIN I don\u00b4t think she likes you very much. \nCHERTKOV What does she say? \nVALENTIN It\u00b4s a tone I\u00b4ve picked up. \nCHERTKOV We simply want to distribute Tolstoy's work to the widest audience possible. She just has no understanding what it is we are trying to do. There\u00b4s nothing in it for any of us but a real chance to increase the world\u00b4s happiness. \nHe takes Valentin's hand. \nCHERTKOV I can only be of limited help to the master if I don't know what's going on. Any effort she makes to shore up control of the copyright, I must know. The survival of our movement depends on it. Remember who your friends are. What you've come here to do. \nChertkov turns away to watch the countryside.

She puts two fingers to her lips and walks toward him. She carries a candle which reveals her short hair, her lovely eyes. \nSOFYA Let me make you crow. \nA pause, then a huge laugh comes up from the very center of him. He twists his neck, thrusts his head upward, crows like a rooster. \nHe virtually runs to her, embraces her, kisses her. She is a giddy girl in his arms. He breaks the embrace and begins strutting around the room. \nSOFYA Let me make you sing. \nHe takes her in his arms, again, begins to kiss her neck. \nSOFYA Do you love me? \nTOLSTOY I do. \nSOFIA I want you to love me. \nHe stops kissing her, looks her in the eye.

A voice from the darkness. \nMASHA I'm not supposed to do this either. \nHe locates the speaker by the glow of her lit cigarette. \nVALENTIN Masha. You are not supposed to smoke at Telyatinki. \nMASHA You wouldn't look at me. \nVALENTIN It was difficult in front of the others. \nMASHA But it wasn't difficult in your bed... When it was only you and me in front of God. \nVALENTIN I'm not sure I was conscious of God. \nMasha emerges from the shadows, but keeps her distance. \nMASHA So, I made you forget God? \nVALENTIN No... \nMASHA Yes, only for a moment. You forgot your rules and remembered love. \nVALENTIN You make it sound very simple. \nMASHA It is simple. What we did is what men and women do, have done, will continue doing. What could be more simple? We touched each other-- stayed close together. Something passed between us. Something real. That is a betrayal of what? Of nothing. (MORE) \nMASHA (cont'd) But you're afraid... All your ideas. What are you afraid of? \nVALENTIN I'm afraid I've hurt you, haven\u00b4t I? \nMASHA No. I feel a little sad, but it is not for me.

See how the papers will like that! \nAs he goes, we hear. \nTOLSTOY (O.S.) This is unbearable. You don't want a husband. You want a Greek chorus. \nSofya is taken aback by his response.

And now we have to put up with her petty grasping. \nVALENTIN It doesn't seem petty to me. \nCHERTKOV I beg your pardon? \nVALENTIN He`s her life. The work, in her mind, is theirs...together. \nCHERTKOV And you're her advocate? You've been taken in by her celebrity.

It was a strange day. Leo Nikolayevich,...I love to listen to him. I love nothing more... \nHe moves closer to her. \nVALENTIN But today I could hardly concentrate. \nHe's very close to her, now. \nVALENTIN All I could think of was you. \nMasha shakes her head, moves away from him. Begins to gather the pole, to refill the spilled bucket. Stops her, turns her to him. \nVALENTIN What's wrong? \nMASHA I think I've confused you. I've confused us both. \nVALENTIN No. No. You didn\u00b4t confuse me..I was stupid. I was afraid, but I'm not afraid anymore. \nValentin wants to fight through the awkwardness. He tries to kiss her. She won't have it. She pulls away. \nVALENTIN I love you, Masha! \nMASHA Maybe you could help me a little. \nIn silence, he gets the filled buckets balanced on the pole. Without another word, Masha starts toward the buildings. He doesn't know what to do. He's losing her. He shouts. \nVALENTIN Masha... \nShe turns \nVALENTIN Before the other night...I'd committed the act of copulation many times in my heart. \nHe has her attention now, as well as that of a number of the disciples who look up from their work in the yard. \nMASHA Yes... \nVALENTIN I think about you all the time. In my heart I\u00b4ve comitted the act of copulation many times.

She steps into the hall in time to see Tolstoy, Chertkov, Valentin and Sasha disappear into the library, ducks back into her room to avoid being seen \n68   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. HALLWAY. DAY                           68 \nSofya approaches the door, listens. She can make out only a few words. \"Mama cannot find out\", Chertkov shushing her, whispers. We push in on Sofya's anxious face. \n69    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY.                         69 \nChertkov, Sasha, Dushan, Valentin and Tolstoy sit in a little clump by his desk. Tolstoy his head in his hands, looks at the floor. \nCHERTKOV I hate to say it but the Countess has become more and more dangerous. \nTOLSTOY Not dangerous... She's concerned for the welfare of the family. \nCHERTKOV (to Tolstoy) And we're concerned for the welfare of mankind. (to Bulgakov) Take this down. \nValentin records the conversation in his diary. \nTOLSTOY It\u00b4s a terrible thing you ask. I can\u00b4t do it. \n70    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. DAY.                 70 \nSofya, still in her dressing gown, climbs out her bedroom window onto a narrow ledge that runs along the second floor. \nSASHA Mama, please... \nShe rips the book away and after brandishing it above her head, throws it through the open doors with a guttural, rumbling growl. She turns on her tormentors. \nSOFYA Now... \nTOLSTOY (mumbles) Can I not...Can I not have... \nHis face is red, his body rigid with anger. \nSASHA You'll kill him, Mama. That's what you want, isn't it? You want him to die!\" \nShe helps him up, takes him to his bedroom. Valentin follows. \nShe looks at Chertkov. \nSOFYA You! Don't think you deceive me for one little moment! I know exactly what you're doing. I want to see the will. It's my right, in the name of god. \nCHERTKOV What are you afraid of? \nSOFYA You.   I'm afraid of you. \nChertkov looks at her with undisguised disgust. \nCHERTKOV The press is bloodthirsty. Had I wished, I could've demolished you and your family. You make it easy. \nSOFYA Tell them anything you like. Go ahead. Ruin us. \nCHERTKOV I have too much respect for Leo Nikolayevich. You're lucky. \nSOFYA Why can't my husband see you for what you are? \nChertkov's face is red. He starts to speak, stops. He walks to the door, then very deliberately. \nCHERTKOV If I had a wife like you, I would have blown my brains out long ago. (beat) Or gone to America. \nHe leaves the room. Sofya sinks back to the floor, a flower wilting. She begins to weep. An Aria from Madame Butterfly comes over \n78   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DINING ROOM. NIGHT.                    78 \nFrom a record on the gramophone. The table is set for ten, although no one is at dinner but Sofya Andreyevna and Valentin. He is visibly uncomfortable. An awkward silence. \nVALENTIN I hope you're feeling better. \nSOFYA Do you like the opera? \nVALENTIN I took singing lessons for years. I thought about a career in music. The only thing I lacked, in the end, was talent. (beat) I'm sorry about everything. \nShe smiles. \nSOFYA This aria is very beautiful.. It is about a woman who is abandoned by the man who loves her...Everyone is very moved by that...in the opera. \nA long pause. The clink of soup spoons.   Tolstoy enters. He doesn't sit. \nTOLSTOY Our life together has become intolerable. \nStifling a sneeze, Valentin gets up to leave,tries to flee the inappropriateness of all this. \nSOFYA Sit down, Valentin. \nVALENTIN Really, I'm expected at Telyatinki. \nShe waves it off. \nSOFYA No, no, no. Enjoy your dinner. We've had a disagreement. No more than any other married couple. \nTOLSTOY I didn't come for more recrimination. Despite good cause for alienation between us, I have never stopped loving you. \nSOFYA Of course... \nTOLSTOY God knows you don't make it easy. \nSOFYA Why should it be easy? I'm the work of your life. You're the work of mine. Its what love is. \nAside to Valentin. \nSOFYA Everything with him is hysterics \nVALENTIN What? \nHe gets up, goes to her. \nMASHA Chertkov spoke with me this afternoon. He says I could be more useful there...which means... \nValentin shakes his head. His lip trembles. \nVALENTIN This is him punishing us, punishing me for befriending Sofya Andreyevna. For not... This is Chertkov. \nMASHA We've both disappointed him. \nVALENTIN I don't care. You can't go away. I'll talk to him. I'll make him change his mind. i\u00b4m going to make you stay. \nMASHA No, I want to go. \nVALENTIN What? \nMASHA I'm leaving the movement. \nVALENTIN You can\u00b4t leave Tolstoy. \nMASHA I am not. Look, when I read his Confession, it moved me, Valya. He was searching for freedom. Freedom from anger. Freedom from attachment. Freedom from all the superstition and nonsense of the church. It moved me so much. I thought that's what it would be about. Isn't that what it's about? Freedom and love? But they mix it all up. \nMasha reaches out and puts her arms around him. Her head falls against his shoulder. \nMASHA Come with me. Please. \nBulgakov doesn't know what to say. The silence gets more awkward as it gets longer. Slowly, she disengages herself from him,looks him in the eye. She nods. \nMASHA I'm going to my room. \nAs she starts away. \nVALENTIN Don't leave me, Masha... I need you. \nShe turns back for a moment. \nMASHA I know you do...I know. \nThen she's gone. \n82   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY. DAY.          82 \nSofya in her bed. A team of doctors hover over her. One of them peers into her eyes with a sextant-like instrument. \nWe move into the hall to find DR. ROSSOLIMO, an expert in mental illness, conferring in the hall with Tolstoy and Dushan. \nROSSOLIMO I believe the Countess suffers from a mental degeneracy, paranoic and hysterical, chiefly the former. \nDUSHAN Yes. \nThe doctor walks back into the bedroom. Tolstoy red in the face, walks away down the hall. Dushan catches him. \nTOLSTOY Why did you bring him here? \nDUSHAN He's an old friend, you know, from Rome. \nTOLSTOY And astoundingly stupid in the way of all scientists. \nDushan is wounded by his uncharacteristic lack of generosity. \nTOLSTOY I'm sorry, my friend, but this is all very upsetting to me. \nDUSHAN Yes. \nTolstoy sits on a small staircase at the end of the hall. Bulgakov is already there on the step above him. \nTOLSTOY Take them downstairs. Thank them for me. Offer them a drink. \nDUSHAN You'll be alright? \nTOLSTOY Valentin Fedorovich will stay with me, won't you, boy \nValentin nods. Dushan goes to collect the doctors. \nMOMENTS LATER-Tolstoy goes to Sofya's bed. He takes her hand. She looks at him with all the love of a new bride. Tears come to his eyes. He kisses her hand. \nVALENTIN Do you love your wife? \nTOLSTOY \" Your youth and your desire for happiness reminds me cruelly of my age and the impossibility of happiness for me.\" When I was courting Sofya, she was so young and pure, it seemed impossible that I'd ever have her. I didn't want to tell her how I felt and I wanted to tell her nothing else. So I wrote down a string of letters and asked her if she could decipher them. She looked completely confused, thinking it was a game or... \nTolstoy looks into the middle distance, remembering his love. \nTOLSTOY I gave her one clue. The first two Y's, I said, stand for \"your youth\" and then the most miraculous thing happened. She simply spoke the phrase, my phrase... \nTolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some explanation of the miraculous. \nTOLSTOY ...as if she had read my mind. In that moment, we both knew we would always be together. For those first years, we were incredibly happy, terrifyingly happy. \nHis old eyes are wet. \nTOLSTOY And now this. \nTolstoy reaches into his boot, extracts his SECRET DIARY. He takes a pen from his shirt, begins to write. Valentin is amazed. HE HAD A PEN ALL THE TIME. \n85   INT. TELYATINKI. MEETING ROOM. NIGHT.                          85 \nValentin exhausted, sits at the long table.   Chertkov appears at his office door. \nCHERTKOV Thank you again, Valentin Fedorovich, for your forethought. \nVALENTIN I'm a secretary, after all. \nChertkov let's it go. \nCHERTKOV You know I had thought for a time to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich look for someone else. But...he said no. He said \"He reminds me of myself when I was young.\" \nHe goes. After a moment, Valentin gets up and goes to the study door. \nVALENTIN I'm leaving Telyatinki. \nCHERTKOV Really. \nVALENTIN I am going to Moscow. \nCHERTKOV She is leading you around the nose. \nVALENTIN Look, you say the movement's about love- \nCHERTKOV Yes... The love he tells us to practice, the love of the Gospels. Why do I have to explain this? Perfect love. Eternal love. The love that binds mankind together. \nVALENTIN But I've never met mankind, only men and women, imperfect men, imperfect women. \nCHERTKOV Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us love can not be weakminded. Go. You won't be missed ...a naive sentimentalist \nValentin looks at him for a long moment, then bursts out laughing, walks away \nCHERTKOV Why are you laughing? You think I'm ridiculous. \nVALENTIN I'm laughing because I didn't sneeze. \n86   OMITTED                                                    86 \n87   OMITTED                                                    87 \n88   OMITTED                                                    88 \n89   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY STUDY/BEDROOM. DAY.            89 \nTolstoy has fallen asleep at his desk, his SECRET DIARY open before him. Sofya enters without knocking. He bolts up groggily, tries to hide the little book. Sofya, meanwhile, holds up the letter in her hand. \nSOFYA Lyovochka? Prozeveskeny wants to purchase the rights to your work after your death. \nTOLSTOY Then I shall try and die as soon as is convenient. \nSOFYA Don't be silly. They've offered one million rubles. \nSilence. \nSOFYA How can you not be pleased? \nTOLSTOY I don't write for publishers. I write for people. \nHe gets up from his desk. \nTOLSTOY Essentials only. Nothing that isn't absolutely necessary. \nValentin struggles to close a case full of books and papers. \nTOLSTOY Please...we must hurry. \nVALENTIN Where will you go? \nNo one responds. Dushan comes to Tolstoy, sits down and begins the ritual taking of the pulse. Meanwhile, Sasha wraps a heavy fur coat around his shoulders. She smiles at him. \nSASHA Absolutely essential. \nDUSHAN A lantern, I think. It's very dark tonight. (beat) And the apparatus for giving an enema. \n96   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. NIGHT.                        96 \nThe horses are hitched to the droshky, the bags are up on the back. \nSASHA Everything's ready. \nDushan climbs into the carriage. Tolstoy turns abruptly and walks back toward the house. \nSASHA Papa...? \nDUSHAN He's changed his mind. He's going back to the house. \nThey watch as Tolstoy kneels on the wet grass, bending low to rub his hands against the earth. After a moment, Valentin goes to him, kneels next to him. \nVALENTIN Do you want to go back? \nTOLSTOY When I was a boy, my brother Nikolai once brought me to a place when I was a boy. He told me he'd found a green stick with some words on it... the secret to happiness for all men everywhere. He hid it in the ground. I looked for it very often. I've looked for it all these years. I really believed I would find it here...but I never did. \nTolstoy looks at him. \nTOLSTOY I never did...but this life is behind me now. \nHe kisses the ground of his beloved home, gets up and they walk back to the droshky. \nTOLSTOY Help me up, will you? \nAs they go, he hands Valentin an envelope. \nTOLSTOY Give this to Sofya. \nVALENTIN I will. \nThey reach the carriage. Sasha embraces him, kisses him over and over. \nSASHA Be well. Be well. \nTOLSTOY Don't cry. I'll send for you when I can. \nThey help him up onto the droshky and the carriage starts slowly away from the old house. \n97   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. MORNING                       97 \nOut in front of the house, an old peasant woman pulls the feathers off a chicken. Over her impassive face, we hear deep, heavy sobs. \n98   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. DAY.                     98 \nSofya is in a rage. Sasha sits nearby. \nSASHA I'm simply telling you what happened. He's gone. I have no idea where. Nobody does. \nSOFYA You're a liar. (beat) Liar! \nSasha won't rise to the bait. \nValentin comes into the room. \nSOFYA So, he's gone. (to Bulgakov) For good. \nVALENTIN I think so, yes. \nThere is a pause. Sofya suddenly smiles, becomes solicitous. \nSOFY Darling Sasha, where is your father? I know you know. Please, please. Don't play games with me. Now it\u00b4s not the moment. \nIvan looks at Sasha for approval. \nSASHA I see no harm in it. Let's get her to bed. \nValentin nods. Ivan appears beside him. \nIVAN Life returns to torture her for awhile. \nHe laughs out loud,then walks away. \n101   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DINING ROOM. DAY.                      101 \nSasha walks into dining room. Valentin pours them tea. \nSASHA She's exhausted herself. She's slept for nearly four hours. \nVALENTIN I'm glad she can sleep. The pain subsides a little. \nSASHA The noise subsides a little. \nThey smile at each other. \nSASHA Well, a little. \nIvan comes down the stairs. He stops in the doorway. \nSASHA Come in. \nIVAN A message, miss. \nSASHA For me? \nIVAN No, for your father. From the Countess, miss. \nSASHA She's allowed to send a note to my father. I just don't know where to tell her to send it. \nIVAN She's addressed it to train number 9. That's the train the master took. The station master told me... \nSASHA Why are you giving it to me? She is allowed to send my father a note! \nIvan steps forward and hands her the note to inspect. Sasha can't help but laugh. \nSASHA She never gives up. (reading the note) \"Dearest papa. Return at once. (MORE) \nSASHA (cont'd) Sasha.\" She signed it with my name. \nVALENTIN Ingenious. \nSASHA Obvious. \nShe pockets the note. Ivan continues to stand there. Sasha looks at him. \nSASHA Yes? \nIVAN He gave me this as well...the stationmaster. A note for you. \nSasha opens it, reads. She looks up, flushed with excitement. \nSASHA He's with my aunt.      At the Shamardino. \nSasha runs out of the room. \n102   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY                          102 \nSasha, on horse back, rides up and by the camera and away down the alley of trees that lead away from the house. \nSOFYA (O.S.) They've all gone \n103   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY.                         103 \nSitting at his desk, Valentin looks up to see Sofya standing in the doorway. She looks exhausted. \nVALENTIN I'm here. \nShe walks to his desk. \nSOFYA You're writing to your girl. That's lovely. \nSOFYA APPEARS in her handsome traveling clothes. An unctuous little orthodox priest follows her out of the train. \nORTHODOX PRIEST If the Count should have a change of heart...if in the last moment he chooses to confess, mother church is there to embrace him with open arms. \nShe nods. \nSOFYA I'll see what I can do, father. \nShe moves with purpose across the tracks and through the throng Reporters pelt her with questions. \n126   INT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. DAY.                 126 \nChertkov, Sasha and Valentin watch through the window. \nSASHA She's coming this way. \nChertkov starts to put on his coat. \nCHERTKOV Not before she stops to tell them lies, catalogue my atrocities. \nVALENTIN Let me speak to her. \nHe heads toward the door. \n127   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY                               127 \nSofya has reached the edge of the platform where DUSHAN gives his medical update, temperature and pulse, to the press. She pulls Dushan aside. Reporters surround them. \nSOFYA I want to see my husband. \nDUSHAN Yes I'll...uhm... \nSOFYA I want to see him. Now! \nDushan is terrified. Valentin arrives at the platform. \nVALENTIN Countess! \nSOFYA Valentin...Will you help me?    I have to see him. Please. \nVALENTIN Of course. But I'm not certain if it\u00b4s the best time, Countess. \nShe starts toward the building. \nSOFYA It is.   It's the right time for me. \nVALENTIN Sofya Andreyevna... (to the crowd) Stay back, stay back. \n128   EXT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. DAY                    128 \nAs Valentin arrives outside the door, he see Sofya physically recoil. She is confronted by Chertkov and Sasha blocking the door. \nSOFYA I want to see my husband. \nMembers of the press, crowd `round trying to listen. \nSASHA He's too weak now, mother. \nSOFYA But he's not too weak to see you. Not too weak to see that... \nShe gestures in Chertkov's direction. The passion attracts more onlookers. \nCHERTKOV Do you really want to do this here? \nShe does her best to ignore him. \nSOFYA I am the leper outside the gate, while he sleeps with the devil himself. \nSASHA Vladimir Gregorovich is here because father asked him to be here. \nThis stops Sofya for a moment. She looks to Valentin. \nSOFYA Is that true? \nValentin nods.   She tries another tack. \nSOFYA Have you told him I nearly drowned in the pond? \nValentin goes to Tolstoy. He's in a kind of panic. Chertkov comes into the room. \nTOLSTOY She's come, hasn't she? She`s here. \nHe points to the corner.   But it is nothing, a gray shape thrown by a coat rack. \nCHERTKOV You're imagining things. \nDUSHAN It's true, Leo Nikolayevich. \nTOLSTOY Sasha...where's your mother? \nTolstoy's eyes fill with tears. Valentin looks to Sasha. She looks from him to Chertkov. \nCHERTKOV She's at home. \nTOLSTOY If she wanted to see me I couldn't refuse her. (beat) Is she going to come here? \nAll eyes are on Sasha. \nSASHA I don't think so...I don't know, Papa. There's no way to... \nTOLSTOY To what? \nWill she waiver?    A long, agonizing beat. \nSASHA She's at home. I'm sure of it. \nValentin looks at the floor. \nTOLSTOY At home. \nSASHA Yes, Papa. \nTolstoy nods, pats Sasha's hand. \nTOLSTOY Very beautiful isn't it? \nSASHA Our home? \nTOLSTOY Yes. \nHe leans back against the pillow and drifts again. Sasha gets up and goes outside. After a moment, Valentin follows. \n135   EXT. ASTAPOVO. STATION MASTER'S HOUSE. DAY                   135 \nValentin sees her leaning against the wall.   She's in pain. \nSASHA He said to me once...\"you're like your mother. You're so full of anger.\" \nShe turns to him. \nSASHA I know it's terrible...but who will protect him? I don't want him to die. \nValentin touches her face, goes back inside and into \n136   INT. ASTAPOVO. STATION MASTER'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY. 136 \nWhere Chertkov has made a makeshift office. He pores through the cables, letters and telegrams that litter the station master's dining table. He holds one up for Valentin. \nCHERTKOV Kind thoughts from George Bernard Shaw. \nValentin walks to the table. \nVALENTIN You lied to him. \nCHERTKOV Keep your voice down. \nVALENTIN He wants to see her.    You heard him say it. \nCHERTKOV What exactly do you think she will bring him? \nVALENTIN I don\u00b4t know, they\u00b4ve been married for 48 years. \nCHERTKOV I\u00b4ll tell you what she\u00b4ll bring...Vanity, fuss and noise. \nVALENTIN She promised me- \nSASHA I can't do this anymore. \nCHERTKOV He won\u00b4t know who she is anyway. \n142   INT. ASTAPOVO. TRAIN CARRIAGE. NIGHT.                      142 \nEveryone sleeps but Sofya. There is a knock on the door. Sofya opens it. It is Sasha. A pause. \nSOFYA Has he asked for me? \nSASHA I want you to come.    Take a coat. It's cold. \n143   EXT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.               143 \nSofya and Sasha walk to the door. The reporter calls out \nREPORTER Countess...Countess...Do you have any information? Countess...Is he dying? Is he dead? \nSasha takes her mother's hand. \n144   INT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.               144 \nShe steps into the room. For a moment, she seems overwhelmed at the sight of him. She looks at Valentin, who nods at her as if to say go on. Sofya walks past Chertkov without acknowledging him. Dushan lets go his hold of Tolstoy's wrist and gets out of the chair, out of her way. She approaches her sleeping, husband, the love of her life, her cross, her everything. \nSOFYA Lyovochka! \nThere is no response.    She throws her arms around him. \nSOFYA Please forgive me, my darling! \nSASHA Mother... \nSOFYA I'm a fool.. I'm a selfish woman. But I love you. Please believe me. Please understand me. Please forgive me for all my weakness and badness. Please! Please! Love me! \nSASHA Mother! \nSasha takes her hand, whispers. \nSASHA Control yourself. \nSOFYA Was I shouting? \nSASHA You have to control yourself. \nSofya looks around and sits back. Strangely, she does control herself. She becomes very still. She takes her husband's hand, begins quietly to speak to him. \nSOFYA You don't speak, but I hear you. \nShe carries on two sides of an impossible conversation. \nSOFYA \"Do you love me, Lyovochka.\" (beat) \"Never stopped, my little bird.\" (beat) \"And you will never stop\" (beat) \"Never.\" (beat) \"Nor ever leave me again.\" (beat) \"Never, ever again. (beat) \"Good...good... let's go home\" \nShe sits very still holding her husband's hand. Then, it seems she feels the slightest of movements, the slightest squeeze of her hand. She looks down to see Tolstoy open his eyes. He looks at her for a moment, the hint of a smile, then closes his eyes again. \nValentin sees it, glances at Sasha.   Then, he begins to fight for breath. \nDUSHAN First cessation. \nA general sense of panic at the proximity of death. Tolstoy fights for a last breath. \nDUSHAN Second cessation. \nSofya whispers quietly to her dying husband. \nSOFYA Please forgive me if I cry a little now. \nTolstoy continues to struggle, then silence, silence. \nSasha starts to sob. Sofya reaches out to her daughter. Sasha comes to her mother who holds her. \nShe feels someone next to her.   She looks up. It's Chertkov. \nCHERTKOV I am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna. \nThe most unlikely thing, she pats his hand. \nSOFYA It's alright. What happens from now on... it will never really matter. Not really.

SECOND CLASS CARRIAGE. COUNTRY SIDE. DAY.                2 \nLeo Tolstoy (80), sits writing on his lapboard. He is quite simply the greatest living writer in the world. His devotion to pacifism, his rejection of the trappings of Orthodoxy in favor of a simple Christian lifestyle convince many to regard him as a living saint. With him are his much younger wife, the COUNTESS SOFYA, favorite daughter SASHA, and his personal physician DUSHAN MAKOVITSKY. Sasha and Dushan write in their diaries. Sofya looks from one to the next a little impatient. The train begins to slow. \nSOFYA Why are we slowing down? \nNo one responds. Slower. Slower. \nSOFYA We're stopping. Why are we stopping? \nSASHA I don't know, mother.    No idea. \nTolstoy look up from his work, asks a passing conductor. \nSOFYA Excuse me, why has the train stopped? \nCONDUCTOR It's the crowd, ma'm, the people. They're blocking the track. \nIn the distance we can here voices. \nVOICES (O.S.) Long live Tolstoy! Long live the old warrior! \nSOFYA But if they block the track, the train can't go...YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM MOVE. \nThe conductor shrugs, walks away. She goes to the window to investigate. A crowd of a hundred peasants, students surround the engine, block the track. They carry a huge cloth banner honoring Tolstoy. We can hear voices chanting \"Tolstoy. Tolstoy. Tolstoy\", voices crying \"You are the truth.\" \"You are the hope of the Russian people.\" \nSOFYA Oh, they won't move. We are gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and say something to them. It's the only way we are gonna get out of here. \nThe chanting grows in intensity. Tolstoy gets to his feet, walks to the window, shows himself to the crowd. A great shout goes up. Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence. Gradually, it comes. \nTOLSTOY I have seen your banner. And I\u00b4ve heard what you say. You think I\u00b4m the hope of Russia, do you? Well, that\u00b4s not true. You are the hope of Russia. The hope of all the world. You say, you want a new way to live? Well, you are not gonna find it making a fuss over me. So, I suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his. \nThe cries begin. \"Clear the tracks. Let them pass. Let them go.\" Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the train pulls away. \n3   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE.

This is VALENTIN FEDOROVITCH BULGAKOV. He can't contain his enthusiasm. Over the noise of the train. \nVALENTIN Do you know who that is? That is the greatest man in the world. \nThe train pulls away into the distance. \nTITLE OVER BLACK: SPRING 1910 \n4   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DAWN.                                   4 \nThe ancestral home of the Tolstoy family in the first budding of spring. \nMuzhiks (peasants) gather wood, carry water to the house. A cart arrives loaded down with mail bags. \n5    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. DAY.                   5 \nA handsome room, walls covered with generations of family photographs. Religious icons are given pride of place, a testament, not to piety, but to an ingrained social conservatism, a certain position in the world. \nCountess Sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make shift altar. Wiping away tears, she leaves the room. \n5A   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY/STAIR. DAY.                     5A \nSofya walks down the stairs and through the entry passed an old servant asleep in a chair. She continues to the basement. \n", "test1_true": "Tolstoy has moved himself out of the refined upper floors into a simple vaulted room he uses as both bedroom and study. The walls are bare except for a portrait of his daughter. The furniture is simple, some of it hand made: a small bed against the wall, a little writing desk in one corner stacked with books, littered with papers, more mail, opened and unopened. Pairs of rude homemade shoes line a work bench. \nTolstoy sleeps in his bed. Though it's late March and still cold, the window is open. Sofya closes it. She stands very still, watching Tolstoy sleep. Sitting on the bed, she gently touches his hand, whispers. \nSOFYA Darling. \nShe lies next to him, something girlish, hopeful in her face, as if waiting for him to wake up and adore her, but he sleeps on. She carefully takes his arm, positions it under her neck, and rolling toward him, wraps it around her. The image of love's intimacy, of wedded bliss. \nHis hand slips off her shoulder, once, twice. She moves awkwardly to replace it. He moves a little toward her. She kisses his neck, his cheek. We don't know if he's awake, but even this shadow of intimacy penetrates her soul. \n7    OMITTED                                                       7 \n8   INT. MOSCOW. STUDY. DAY.                                      8 \nA handsome study in the Moscow townhouse of VLADIMIR GRIGOREVICH CHERTKOV, Tolstoy's most articulate and dedicated disciple. He's interviewing Tolstoy's newly appointed secretary, VALENTIN BULGAKOV, the young man we met near the train, who, at the mention of sex, blushes a little. \nCHERTKOV But sex... You are twenty three. Not an easy age for abstinence, is it? \nVALENTIN Tolstoy does not approve of sexual relations. I know this. \nCHERTKOV He despises them, in fact... \nChertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax. \nCHERTKOV I don't want to belabor the point, but I arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids just like that. He was very upset. \nVALENTIN This would not be a problem. I'm celibate. I'm also a strict vegetarian. \nChertkov nods his approval, begins to worry his moustache. \nCHERTKOV Yes, I've heard many good things about you. I've even read what you`ve written. So has he. \nValentin's face flushes with pride. Chertkov steals a glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase. One side of his moustache droops a little. He tugs awkwardly at it. \nCHERTKOV My dear boy, if you were to become Tolstoy's private secretary, you would be given a great gift. You'll be with him every day, eat together, walk in the forest by his side. \nIt's difficult to contain himself. \nVALENTIN Believe me, since becoming a Tolstoyan, I have become so eager to learn, so comitted to discussing ideas, improving my very soul. \nCHERTKOV (smiling) Well, we have a lot to do if we are to get his work to the people. \nVALENTIN We? \nThey both laugh. \nCHERTKOV Yes, we. If we can encourage the spread of passive resistance...just think of it Valentin   thousands of ordinary Russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political oppression- \nVALENTIN In the name of truth and freedom. \nCHERTKOV Truth and freedom, yes but still, my boy, there are so many enemies- \nVALENTIN Enemies? \nChertkov walks to the window, signals Valentin to follow him. He points to \nTWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES standing in the street below. \nCHERTKOV The Czar's police...You'll be followed when you leave here...and the church will stop at nothing to bring him back into the fold. His children can't be trusted... only Sasha... and then of course there is the Countess... (beat) Well, one doesn't like to come between married people whatever the circumstances, but her dogged attachment to private property, her public criticism of our movement... (MORE) \nCHERTKOV (cont'd) (beat) The point is, he needs a man of your intellectual gifts around him. Someone who can help him with the new work. Someone who understands his goals. \nChertkov returns to the desk. \nCHERTKOV And although they've allowed me to return to Russia, I can't see him. They keep me under house arrest... They might as well keep me in a cage. \nClearly upset, Chertkov pauses to get control of himself. He picks up a package, hands it to Valentin. \nCHERTKOV So, I need you to put these letters directly into his hands. One can't be sure what gets through to him. \nValentin looks at him, quizzical. \nCHERTKOV Sofya Andreyevna does not respect his privacy. \nVALENTIN She wouldn't open his private correspondence... \n", "test2_input": "VALENTIN (O.S.) At the moment, I'm indisposed. \nSERGEYENKO Yes, well...Leo Nikolayevich is here. He want s to see you. \n49B   INT. TELYATINKI. VALENTIN'S ROOM. DAY.               49B \nValentin blanches. \nVALENTIN Tell him... I'll be down at once. \nSERGEYENKO (O.S.) Yes..and tell Maria Filipovna we could use another hand in the kitchen. \nThey look at each other. \nVALENTIN If I see her I will... \nSERGEYENKO (O.S.) If you see her...yes. And if you're going to behave like rabbits, you should go live in the woods. \nValentin is up, immediately. \nVALENTIN Let me go out first...give me five minutes... \nMasha just looks at him. \n50   EXT. TELYATINKI COMPOUND. DAY.                               50 \nA Tolstoyan photo op. A delegation of orphans have come to pay their respects to Tolstoy. He sits in a chair beside Chertkov beneath a large banner : \"Leo Tolstoy, Friend of the People.\". Behind him, the disciples lay out a vegetarian feast on a plank table. Photographers and a cinematographer are strategically positioned to record the event. \nEach child gives Tolstoy a flower. Chertkov, in turn, hands each child a photograph of the Count giving money to the poor. \nValentin enters, flushed and blushing. He pauses beside Dushan who records the scene in his diary, tears in his eyes. \nDUSHAN Look at the love in him, like Jesus..suffering the children...all that... \nTolstoy greets a little boy affectionately, rubs his knuckles over the boy's shaved head. A little girl approaches, takes a photograph. He bends forward to kiss her head but she pulls away. \nTOLSTOY An old man is a very ugly thing. \nTolstoy sees Valentin, lights up. \nTOLSTOY My dear boy. Come and kiss me. \nValentin, beet red, goes to him. He is warmly embraced. \nTOLSTOY Now, who is this? Maria Filipovna. \nMasha comes to stand beside him. She glances at Valentin but he won't make eye contact with her. \nTOLSTOY You're both looking so well. Life here at Telyatinki obviously agrees with you. \nValentin sneezes mightily, moves a little away. \nTOLSTOY God bless you, boy. What are you nervous about, now? Sit down. Sit down. \nValentin takes the chair beside him. \nTOLSTOY Dear Masha, Valentin tells me you're the great treasure of Telyatinki. He claims you're a very gifted teacher. \nSergeyenko lifts an eyebrow \"Indeed.\". Valentin is in agony. \nMASHA We're happy to have you with us. \nTolstoy notices a mosquito on Valentin's cheek. He takes the bug between his big fingers, squeezes until it pops. Chertkov watches in horror, whispers loudly. \nCHERTKOV What are you doing? \nTOLSTOY What do you mean? \nHe motions to the photographers. \nCHERTKOV You've killed a living thing. \nChertkov hears a laugh behind him.   It is Masha who has over heard the whole thing. \nCHERTKOV Do you have something to say? \nMASHA It's absurd. That's all. \n", "test2_true": "VALENTIN What are you saying? \nMASHA I'm sorry but- It's a mosquito. \nTOLSTOY Forgive him. He can't help it. He's a better Tolstoyan than I am. \nShe can't help laughing again. Valentin sees the color rise in Chertkov's face. \nCHERTKOV It's not the message we want to send. \nSasha suddenly appears. She holds a cable in her hand. \nSASHA From my mother \"Nerves dreadful. Stop. Insomnia. Stop. Pulse 100. Stop. Please come home. \n51   INT. TELYATINKI. CHERTKOV'S STUDY. DAY.                      51 \nChertkov is there. Tolstoy, Valentin and Sasha. \nSASHA Don't give in to her, Papa. It'll never end...I swear to God, that woman has an instinct for knowing when you're just about to enjoy yourself \nA knock on the door. Valentin opens it. It's Dushan with another cable. Tolstoy gestures for him to read it aloud. \nDUSHAN From Sofya Andreyevna. \"I beg you. Stop. Unwell. Stop. Hurry back.\" \nSASHA Who taught her to use that damned machine? \nValentin starts to sneeze, stifles it, starts again, stifles, starts, explodes. Guilty. \nCHERTKOV Perhaps Sasha's right. Encouraging this may not be the best thing. \nSASHA It's a trick, Papa. She'll drain you. You'll be miserable. \nTolstoy looks from one to the other, gets up from his chair. \nSASHA Then, let me go with you. \nTOLSTOY No, my dear, I'll go alone. \n52   OMITTED                                                       52 \n53   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.                 53 \nClose on Sofya lying in bed. She looks ravishing in the candle light. In the background, Tolstoy arrives in the bedroom door. \nTOLSTOY Sofya. \nA sly smile on her lips, the tension gone from her face, she seems twenty years younger. \nTOLSTOY Sofya, are you ill? \nShe rolls toward him making it clear she's quite naked under the sheets. This is no sick bed. \nSOFYA I'm fine...now that you're home. \nTOLSTOY It's no good, you know, all this. You frightened everyone. \nSOFYA Did I really? I don't believe it. Not you. I'm your little bird. You know the sounds I make. \nTOLSTOY That was some sort of love call? \nSOFYA It brought you back to me. \nShe reaches out her hand to him. \nSOFYA Come out of the dark... where I can see you. \nHe takes a step toward her, then stops. \nTOLSTOY Why? Why? Why, do you do it? We live in the country and you insist on making it an opera house. What's wrong with a little peace now and then? \nSofya laughs. \nSOFYA Look at me. This is who I am. This is what you married. We're older, maybe we're old, but I'm still your little chicken (beat) You're still my big cock. \nShe smiles at him. \n", "test3_input": "DUSHAN I know. Stay back. \nTolstoy stirs. \nTOLSTOY Where are we? \nDUSHAN It's alright. Everything's fine. \nHe reaches out to touch Tolstoy's forehead. He goes pale. \nTOLSTOY Where are we? \nDUSHAN Let me take your temperature. \nThe old man lifts his shirt, takes the thermometer under his arm. Dushan reaches for his wrist. Valentin and Sasha look at each other, wait for the vital signs. He takes the thermometer from Tolstoy, reads it. \nHe's clearly shaken. \nTOLSTOY Good old Dushan,...you needn't worry. Remember, you are my doctor, not my angel. Whatever happens, it's not your fault... I'm feeling much better now. I just need to sleep. \nDUSHAN Good, good. Yes. \nHe drifts off again, Dushan stares at the thermometer. His eyes fill with tears. \nDUSHAN He will be fine. \n114   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY                                 114 \nThe train pulls into a small, dusty station, ASTAPOVO. \nValentin and Dushan support, help him off the train.   Sasha looks at the sad, empty platform. \nSASHA We've come to the end of the world. \n115   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY.                                115 \nDushan and Tolstoy sit on a bench on the platform. Sasha and Valentin appear. \nVALENTIN The stationmaster says we may have his house for as long as we need it. There are no inns nearby, so we're lucky. \nTOLSTOY Very lucky. \nDUSHAN Yes. \nThey help Tolstoy up. A little bearded man, the station master, waits to escort them. \nSASHA You'll be comfortable here, papa. The rest of us...we'll find cots or sleep in the station. \nTOLSTOY And then we'll be on our way. \n116   OMITTED                                                      116 \n117   OMITTED                                                      117 \n118   INT.

Outside the station master's house, Dushan gives an update, temperature, pulse. \nValentin emerges from the telegraph office, telegrams and cables in his hands. A long passenger train pulls in from the north. There's general commotion at the new arrival. \"The Countess.\" \"Is it the Countess?\"... More press, a cinematographer lugging his gear and CHERTKOV. He spots Valentin. There is no greeting, no embrace. \nCHERTKOV Bulgakov! Where is he?    Take me to him. \nAs they make their way across the tracks, Chertkov can barely contain his glee. \nCHERTKOV He left...astonishing...He actually, finally left. \nVALENTIN He wasn't well enough to travel. It's very cold. \nChertkov doesn't hear, He's basking in his victory. \nCHERTKOV It's a triumph for the movement. \n122   INT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE.

Several news cameras are set up near the stationmaster's house. Tents have been erected as make shift shelters and offices. Reporters struggle to get into the telegraph office. Word goes around something big is happening. \nAt the platform, we see the highly polished private train pull in. The Countess has arrived. \n"}

A hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG moving in. KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures. A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a bench nearby. The Girl looks up, claps her hands. 
GIRL Monkey! OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then another. And another. 
REVEAL THREE DOZEN APES EMERGING FROM THE FOG, MAKING THEIR 
WAY DOWN THE SLOPE. suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure. 
PEOPLE START TO NOTICE - GRAB THEIR KIDS. The Mother looks up from her book. SOMEONE SCREAMS. 
GIRL (CONT'D) Mommy? The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't get to her. 
MOTHER April! Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up and puts her down out of harm's way. Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where he's going. SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
Fog rolls in off the bay. Will's strapped into his seat, looking down at the city below. 
HUFFS You see them? 
WILL No, I can't see - 
STEWART Oh my god. Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW: it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl - chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along parallel streets... She realizes something. 
STEWART (CONT'D) I know where they're going.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY 
A SIGN: THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO. FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors. The fun is interrupted by the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS sweeping low overhead. Faces turn skyward... 
A moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos. PEOPLE scatter. SCREAM. Released balloons float lazily upward. 
INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY 
Will watches Caesar moving the apes down the zoo's pathways, dodging people, jumping over benches. 
WILL He's going to release the apes. Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off - but hesitate. The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS. 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY 
As the apes pass other enclosures, the ANIMALS GO NUTS. Lions ROAR. Giraffes run back and forth. 
INT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO/APE ENCLOSURE - DAY 
WRANGLER What the hell am I supposed to do when they get here?! An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know something's coming. Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers, turns to see Caesar and his apes. Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth. The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys. 
SOUND OF BOLTS AND LOCKS CLICKING OPEN. 
INT./EXT. APE ENCLOSURE/ZOO - DAY 
All kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from their separate enclosures. Caesar's apes are waiting for them. Caesar makes eye contact with the GRIZZLED OLD MALE CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit. 
By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY. Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some News Crews. 
INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY 
Apes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the street. 
DODGE That's him! The one with the white on his shoulder! A SNIPER takes aim at Caesar - the BULLET RICOCHETS OFF THE 
SIDEWALK.

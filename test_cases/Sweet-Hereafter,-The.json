SUMMER COTTAGE -- DAY \nA young family together in bed.  It is a bright summer morning.  Father, mother, and a three year old girl are still asleep.  They are naked.  A light breeze drifts into the room.  The scene is serene and softly suspended. \nHead credits appear over this idyllic image.  The little girl turns in her sleep.  A dog barks outside. \nCUT TO \nINT./EXT.  CAR WASH. -- NIGHT \nFrom the peaceful tableau of the sleeping family, the scene shifts to a vehicle entering a car wash.  The image is shot through the windshield, from the driver's point of view. \nThe car enters the lathered world of spinning felt wheels and gushing water. \nCUT TO \nINT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT \nInside the car MITCHELL STEPHENS, a man in his mid-fifties, listens to a stirring piece of music.  The sound of the car wash is filtered out by the strains of music. \nCUT TO \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nThe phone booth is located in a rundown area of a large city.  A young woman, ZOE, enters the booth and lifts the receiver. \nCUT TO \nINT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT \nMITCHELL STEPHENS is going through the wash.  The automatic mops and buffers embrace his car with water and suds.  The cellular phone in the car rings.  MITCHELL picks it up. \nMITCHELL Yes?  Yes, I'll accept the charges. \nCUT TO \nINT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT \nZOE is on the phone.  There's a figure outside the booth waiting for her. \nZOE Daddy, it's me...How are you doing? That's great...Where are you? What's that sound? \nCUT TO \nINT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT \nMITCHELL in his car, playing with the volume on his radio. \nMITCHELL I'm in a car wash. \nCUT TO \nCUT TO \nEXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY \nA group of men are setting up the ferris wheel for the country fair.  SAM and NICOLE walk into the shot, eating ice cream cones.  SAM waves at someone he recognizes in the distance. \nSAM Let's sit down. \nNICOLE nods, her mind elsewhere. \nCUT TO \nEXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY \nSAM and NICOLE are sitting at an outside table, finishing their cones. \nA school bus pulls up into the fairground.  NICOLE watches as young children spill out of the bus and gather outside. \nNICOLE smiles at this scene.  SAM notices, turns around to see the children, then turns back to NICOLE. \nSAM What's so funny? \nNICOLE Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life. \nANGLE ON \nDOLORES DRISCOLL, a warm and cheery woman in her forties, leading the young children into the large exhibition barn on the fair site. \nDOLORES Alright, kids.  I want you all to listen to me.  Rule number one  No one is allowed to stick their fingers into the cages.  I don't care how cute some of these animals may be, the fact is they don't like being here, no matter how many ribbons some of them have won... \nCUT TO \nINT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING \nMITCHELL STEPHENS is having a meeting with WENDELL and RISA WALKER in their livingroom behind the reception area. MITCHELL has a pad of paper and is taking notes. \nWENDELL Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work. \nMITCHELL In what way? \nWENDELL Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough. \nMITCHELL Any criminal record? \nWENDELL Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more. \nWENDELL Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze. \nMITCHELL How does the family survive? \nWENDELL Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by. \nMITCHELL looks at RISA, who has remained silent. \nMITCHELL What about Doreen? \nRISA She...she was a friend of mine. \nMITCHELL When? \nRISA At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle... \nMITCHELL That's the local bar? \nRISA (nodding) ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and... \nRISA hesitates. \nWENDELL Taking it out on her. \nMITCHELL stops taking notes, and looks at the WALKERS. \nRISA You don't know that. \nMITCHELL Have they ever been busted? \nRISA No. \nWENDELL You don't know is what you mean. \nMITCHELL regards the tension between RISA and WENDELL as he continues to make notes. \nMITCHELL'S cell phone rings.  He answers it. \nMITCHELL Yes, I'll accept the charges. \nMITCHELL stands up. \nMITCHELL (CONT'D) Do you mind if I step outside for a moment?  It's a private call. \nThe WALKERS nod as MITCHELL moves outside. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK \nMITCHELL speaks into his cellular phone. \nMITCHELL Zoe...Zoe, where are you? \nCUT TO \nINT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY \nA newscaster is giving a report on the television screen of a first class airplane cabin.  The image is silent. \nThis scene takes place two years after the accident. \nMITCHELL STEPHENS is playing with his headset, which doesn't seem to be working.  He summons a STEWARDESS over. \nMITCHELL I'm not getting any sound. \nThe STEWARDESS checks the headset and confirms the problem. \nSTEWARDESS I'll find you another pair. \nThe STEWARDESS leaves. \nA young woman seated beside MITCHELL hands him her headset. \nALISON You can have mine. \nMITCHELL takes ALISON'S headset.  Their eyes lock for a moment. \nALISON (CONT'D) Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones. \nMITCHELL Alison Jones. \nALISON \nI was a friend of Zoe's.  We went to school together.  I used to come to your house. \nMITCHELL (pretending to remember) Yes. \nALISON Ally.  That was my nickname. \nMITCHELL Ally.  That's right. \nALISON How are you? \nMITCHELL I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you? \nALISON I'm fine.  Still working with my father. \nMITCHELL frequently looks over to ABBOTT during his conversations with DOLORES.  ABBOTT is always watching him like a hawk, making MITCHELL uneasy. \nDOLORES Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'. \nMITCHELL What do you mean by that, Dolores? \nDOLORES About the Ottos? \nMITCHELL Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'? \nDOLORES I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing... \nMITCHELL Do they have any reputation for drugs? \nDOLORES No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers. \nMITCHELL And they loved Bear. \nDOLORES Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott. \nMITCHELL turns around to find the picture of BEAR. \nIt is right behind ABBOTT'S head, so MITCHELL has to divide his attention between the cute PHOTOGRAPH of BEAR clutching a prize rabbit at last year's county fair, and ABBOTT'S glaring eyes. \nANGLE ON \nThe PHOTOGRAPHS of various children with their pets.  Some have ribbons. \nDOLORES (CONT'D) (voice over) Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show. \nMITCHELL For rabbits? \nDOLORES (nodding) \nAbbott used to breed them 'til he had the stroke.  Bear won first prize.  Just look at the smile on his face. \nDOLORES He was one of those children that bring out the best in people.  He would have been a wonderful man. \nANGLE ON \nMITCHELL as he stares at the photo of BEAR. \nCUT TO \nEXT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING \nThe camera is outside the bus, looking at BEAR as he finishes waving to his parents. \nANGLE ON \nBEAR'S P.O.V. of WANDA and HARTLEY disappearing as the bus pulls away. \nCUT TO \nINT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING \nThe camera moves inside the crowded bus, peering at the childrens' activity as they play with each other in the bus. \nANGLE ON \nJESSICA and MASON ANSEL are seated at the back of the bus, looking out the rear window, waving at someone. \nCUT TO \nEXT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING \nJESSICA and MASON are seen waving at... \nBILLY ANSEL, driving behind them in his pick up truck.  He waves back at his children. \nDOLORES (voice over) Billy Ansel started honking at us up around Upper Hat Creek.  He always started to do that when he caught up to the bus.  He'd wave at his kids, Jessica and Mason, who always sat at \nHELICOPTER AERIAL SHOT \nThe bus and the pick-up are travelling through a beautiful mountain pass. \nCUT TO \nINT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY \nMITCHELL continues his conversation with ALISON as they eat dinner. \nALISON I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay. \nMITCHELL Are you still in touch? \nALISON Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago. \nMITCHELL Which one? \nALISON Which one? \nMITCHELL Which clinic? \nALISON I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach. \nMITCHELL Sunnyridge.  That was a long time \nago. \nBeat.  ALISON proceeds cautiously. \nALISON So there were others? \nMITCHELL (as he eats) Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units... \nALISON Then...when did she get better? \nMITCHELL She didn't. \nALISON But you said... \nMITCHELL That's where I'm going.  To see her. \nALISON She's in trouble? \nMITCHELL Yes. (beat) Do you find there's something strange about this meat? \nALISON stares at her plate.  MITCHELL summons the STEWARDESS. \nSTEWARDESS Some more wine? \nMITCHELL I'm afraid this meat is overdone. \nSTEWARDESS I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish? \nMITCHELL What is it? \nSTEWARDESS Poached salmon. \nMITCHELL considers this.  He is polite, but slightly edgy. \nMITCHELL Do you have a cold plate? \nSTEWARDESS We do. \nMITCHELL Is there shrimp on it? \nSTEWARDESS Yes. \nMITCHELL If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp... \nSTEWARDESS (smiling) I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate. \nWANDA You've been retained? \nMITCHELL Yes. \nWANDA Their child died, and they got a lawyer. \nPause.  MITCHELL assesses WANDA'S energy. \nMITCHELL It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief. \nWANDA Who did they get for that? \nMITCHELL You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your \nweapon against whoever caused that bus to go off the road. \nWANDA Dolores? \nMITCHELL It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus. \nWANDA You think someone else caused the accident? \nMITCHELL Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before. \nHARTLEY returns with the tea. \nHARTLEY But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to... \nMITCHELL How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning? \nMITCHELL takes the cup of tea. \nMITCHELL (CONT'D) Someone calculated ahead of time what it would cost to sacrifice safety.  It's the darkest, most cynical thing to imagine, but it's \nabsolutely true.  And now, it's up to me to make them build that bus with an extra bolt, or add an extra yard of guard rail.  It's the only way we can ensure moral responsibility in this society.  By what I do. \nPause. \nWANDA So you're just the thing we need. \nMITCHELL Excuse me? \nWANDA Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best? \nMITCHELL Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best. \nAs we're sitting here the town or the school board or the manufacturer of that bus are lining up a battery of their own lawyers to negotiate with people as grief-stricken as yourselves.  And this makes me very, very mad.  It's why I came all the way up here.  If everyone had done their job with integrity your son would be alive this morning and safely in school.  I promise you that I will pursue and reveal who it was that did not do their job. \nMITCHELL Who is responsible for this tragedy. Then, in your name and the Walkers' name and the name of whoever decides to join us, I shall sue.  I shall sue for negligence until they bleed. \nPause. \nWANDA I want that person to go to jail. For the rest of his life.  I want him to die there.  I don't want his money. \nMITCHELL nods sympathetically. \nMITCHELL It's unlikely that anyone will go to prison, Mrs. Otto.  But he or his company will pay in other ways.  And we must make them pay.  Not for the \nmoney or to compensate you for the loss of your son.  That can't be done.  But to protect other innocent children.  You see, I'm not just here to speak for your anger, but for the future as well. (beat) What we're talking about is an ongoing relationship to time. \nPause.  HARTLEY looks at MITCHELL'S teacup. \nHARTLEY I didn't ask if you wanted milk. \nMITCHELL No.  A little sugar though. \nHARTLEY We've only got honey. \nMITCHELL I'll...take it straight. \nMITCHELL maintains his eye contact with WANDA. \nCUT TO \nINT. GAS STATION -- DUSK \nBILLY is playing his electric guitar in the same garage that MITCHELL walked into at the beginning of the film. \nThis is the gas station/repair shop/car wash that BILLY runs. \nBILLY checks his watch, and takes his guitar off.  He leaves the garage. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK \nBILLY is walking along a path behind the hotel, making sure that he is not seen.  He sneaks into Room 11. \nCUT TO \nINT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING \nBILLY is sitting in a chair in Room 11, smoking a cigarette. The room is dark.  After a while, RISA enters through the door and slips inside. \nRISA Have you been waiting long? \nBILLY A while. \nRISA Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking. \nBILLY gets up to put out his cigarette in the toilet.  He notices some work tools in the washroom. \nBILLY What's all this? \nRISA \nWendell put some fresh enamel on that break in the tub. \nBILLY Does this mean I can't take a shower? \nRISA No.  It should be dry by now. \nBILLY nods.  He turns around, looks at RISA, and begins to unbutton her shirt.  RISA stops him, smiles, and kisses BILLY.  After a moment, she pulls away, unbuckles her belt, and slips off her jeans.  She moves to the bed. \nBILLY What time's he coming home? \nRISA When the game's over, I guess. \nBILLY moves to the radio and turns it on, tuning into a hockey game.  RISA laughs.  He lowers the volume.  RISA takes off her shirt, and moves behind BILLY, kissing his neck.  BILLY closes his eyes. \nCUT TO \nINT. BILLY'S HOUSE. -- EVENING \nJESSICA and MASON, BILLY'S children, are being read to sleep by NICOLE.  She reads from Robert Browning's THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN. \nNICOLE The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty... \nMASON What's a ditty again? \nNICOLE It's like a song. \nMASON Oh. \nNICOLE \nWhen begins my ditty, Almost five hundred years ago, To see the townsfolk suffer so From vermin, was a pity... \nMASON What's vermin again? \nNICOLE Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats... \nMASON Nicole? \nOMITTED \nDOLORES (voice over) They had walked to their places on the main road from the smaller lanes \nDOLORES and private roadways that run off it.  Bright little clusters of three and four children - like berries waiting to be plucked. \nCUT TO \nINT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY \nDOLORES is continuing her conversation with MITCHELL. \nDOLORES (smiling to herself) That's the way I thought of them sometimes. \nMITCHELL Berries. \nDOLORES Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children. \nPause.  MITCHELL stares at DOLORES, disturbed by this image. DOLORES looks back at him. \nDOLORES (CONT'D) Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring. \nMITCHELL Berry-picking. \nDOLORES Yes.  The old-fashioned way. \nMITCHELL And what's that? \nDOLORES With our hands. \nMITCHELL nods, stealing a glance ABBOTT, who stares at him intensely. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING \nThe bus pulls up across the road from the Bide-A-Wile Motel. DOLORES watches as RISA walks her little boy, SEAN, across the road to the bus. \nDOLORES (voice over) Anyhow, my next stop was across from the Bide-A-Wile, which is owned and operated by Risa and Wendell Walker. \nRisa walked her little boy, Sean, across the road, which was customary.  Sean had some kind of learning disability. \nDOLORES He was behind all the other kids his age in school and was too fragile and nervous to play sports. \nCUT TO \nINT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY \nDOLORES continues to talk to MITCHELL, who takes notes. \nDOLORES (smiling) A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six. \nMITCHELL Were his parents...attentive to him? \nDOLORES What do you mean? \nMITCHELL You mentioned that he had a learning disability. \nDOLORES That's right. \nMITCHELL Did his parents attend to that? \nDOLORES What do you mean? \nMITCHELL Did they give him special care? \nDOLORES The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING \nEXT. BILLY'S PICK-UP -- MORNING \nBILLY waving back at his children.  His expression suddenly changes as he sees... \nCUT TO \nEXT. ROAD. -- MORNING \nFrom BILLY'S point of view, the schoolbus smashes through the guardrail and the snowbank.  It plummets down the embankment to the frozen-over pond. \nStill upright, the bus slides across the ice to the far side.  The ice lets go and the rear half of the yellow bus is swallowed at once by the freezing water.  The sound of the ice breaking is terrifying. \nDOLORES (voice over) It emerged from the blowing snow on the right side of the road.  It might have been a dog or a small deer or maybe even a lost child.  It might have been an optical illusion or a mirage.  Whatever it was, for the rest of my life I will remember that red-brown blur... \nAn eerie silence as the camera stares at the scene of the accident. \nCUT TO \nINT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- MORNING \nThe camera is high above the bed, looking down on a sleeping family. \nThis is the same image as from the beginning of the film. \nA FATHER, a MOTHER, and a THREE YEAR OLD GIRL, naked in bed. \nMITCHELL (voice over) Every time I get on one of these flights to rescue Zoe, I remember the summer we almost lost her.  She was three years old.  It happened in the morning, at this cottage we used to rent.  We were all sleeping together in bed.  It was a wonderful time in our lives.  We still thought we had a future together, the three of us.  Did you ever visit the cottage? \nCUT TO \nINT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT \nMITCHELL is telling the story to ALISON. \nALISON I...don't think so. \nMITCHELL I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face. \nALISON What happened? \nMITCHELL I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was. \nALISON stares at MITCHELL, taken by his need to chronicle and detail this irrelevant stranger. \nCUT TO \nINT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- MORNING \nFATHER (YOUNG MITCHELL) is on the phone.  The camera is behind his head. \nIn front of him, MOTHER (KLARA) is breast-feeding the THREE YEAR OLD GIRL (ZOE). \nMITCHELL (voice over) He surmised that there was a nest of baby black widow spiders in the mattress.  He told me they had to be babies, or else with Zoe's body \nweight she'd be dead.  He told me I had to rush her to the hospital.  He was alone.  There was no ambulance available.  'Now you listen', he said, 'There's a good chance you can get her to me before her throat closes, but the important thing is to keep her calm.'  He asked if there was one of us she was more relaxed with than the other.  I said, 'Yes, with me.' \nCUT TO \nINT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT \nMITCHELL continues telling the story to ALISON. \nMITCHELL Which was true enough, especially at that moment.  Klara was wild-eyed with fear, and her fear was contagious.  I was a better actor than she was, that's all.  Zoe loved us equally then.  Just like she hates us both equally now. (beat) The doctor told me that I should hold her in my lap, and let Klara drive to the hospital.  He asked me to bring a small, sharp knife.  It had to be clean.  There was no time to sterilize properly.  He explained how to perform an emergency tracheotomy.  How to cut into my daughter's throat and windpipe without causing her to bleed to death.  He told me there'd be a lot of blood.  I said I didn't think I could do it.  'If her throat closes up and stops her breathing, you'll have to, Mr. Stephens.  You'll have a minute and a half, two minutes maybe, and she'll probably be unconscious when you do it.  But if you can keep her calm and relaxed, if you don't let her little heart beat too fast and spread the poison around, then you might just make it over here first.  You get going now', and he hung up. \nCUT TO \nINT. CAR -- MORNING \nA little girl staring innocently into the lens as a male voice sings a lullaby to her. \nIt is now recognized as MITCHELL'S voice, singing to his daughter as she is driven to the hospital. \nRISA ...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough. \nBILLY You believe that? \nRISA I have to. \nBILLY Why? \nRISA Because I have to. \nBILLY Well I don't. \nBILLY gets up to leave. \nRISA Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed? \nBILLY Yes. \nRISA Why did you do that, Billy? \nBILLY You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing. \nRISA is crying.  BILLY opens the door. \nBILLY (CONT'D) You know what I'm going to miss? More than making love?  It's the nights you couldn't get away from Wendell.  It's the nights I'd sit in that chair for an hour.  Smoking cigarettes and remembering my life before... \nBILLY stares at RISA painfully, then leaves. \nCUT TO \nEXT. GAS STATION -- NIGHT \nMITCHELL is videotaping the bus with a portable camcorder. \nThe bus is badly damaged, though essentially intact.  Most of the windows in the rear have gone.  There is a ghostly quality to this image, as though the video light is searching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck. \nMITCHELL turns off the camcorder and stands in the silent night, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus.  He hears a truck approaching the garage from the distance.  It's BILLY ANSEL.  MITCHELL retreats to his parked car as BILLY stops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the truck. \nBILLY leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows over the inside passenger seats.  BILLY stares at the bus a long time.  MITCHELL approaches him. \nMITCHELL I'm here about your children, Mr. Ansel. \nBILLY takes a moment, then turns around to face MITCHELL. The two men stare at each other. \nMITCHELL (CONT'D) My name is... \nBILLY Mister, I don't want to know your name. \nMITCHELL I understand. \nBILLY No you don't. \nMITCHELL I can help you. \nBILLY Not unless you can raise the dead. \nMITCHELL hands BILLY a card. \nMITCHELL Here.  You may change your mind. \nBILLY looks at the card. \nBILLY Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do. \nMITCHELL No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you. \nBILLY Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help. \nMITCHELL You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group. \nBILLY Case? \nSAM leaves again. \nJENNY Mommy says you need to lock the boys out. \nNICOLE What boys? \nJENNY I don't know. \nNICOLE stares at JENNY, as MARY comes back into the room. \nMARY So do you like your new room? \nNICOLE It's interesting. \nMARY Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect. \nNICOLE I feel like a princess. \nSAM comes back and begins to work on the door.  NICOLE watches him.  She notices a new computer on a desk. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Is this mine? \nMARY Yes.  It's a present. \nNICOLE From you? \nMARY No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were. \nNICOLE Who's Mr. Stephens? \nSAM He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer. \nNICOLE You and Mom have a lawyer? \nSAM Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too. \nNICOLE My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer? \nMARY Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something? \nNICOLE No.  What's this lawyer business? \nMARY turns to JENNY. \nMARY Jenny, why don't you go and play outside? \nJENNY looks at NICOLE. \nJENNY He's given me some stuff too.  Toys, and some books... \nMARY Jenny. \nJENNY turns to leave.  When she's outside, MARY continues. \nMARY (CONT'D) He's a very kind man.  And he knew that you'd need a computer for doing schoolwork. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BURNELL HOME. PORCH -- DAY \nNICOLE wheels her chair to the exterior porch, where she watches her sister climb a tree.  SAM follows her outside. \nSAM It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included. \nNICOLE But you didn't lose me. \nMARY No, honey.  And we will thank the Lord for that every day and night \nfor the rest of our lives.  But you almost died, and you were badly injured, and you won't be...you can't... \nNICOLE I can't walk anymore. \nMITCHELL Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe. \nZOE You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer. \nMITCHELL Tell me your news, Zoe. \nZOE Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood. \nMITCHELL That's not news, Zoe. \nZOE No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood. \nCUT TO \nINT. CAR -- DAY \nImage of ZOE as a little girl in MITCHELL'S lap.  Her face is swollen.  She is being driven to the hospital. \nMITCHELL is singing her a lullaby. \nMiTCHELL's conversation with ZOE continues over this image. \nZOE Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register? \nMITCHELL Yes. \nZOE I tested positive. \nMITCHELL Yes. \nZOE Welcome to hard times, Daddy. \nPause. \nMITCHELL What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want. \nZOE I need money. \nMITCHELL What for? \nZOE You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money. \nMITCHELL Do you have the blood test? \nZOE You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me? \nMITCHELL Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another \ntest.  In case the one you got...was wrong. \nZOE I like it when you don't believe me, Daddy.  It's better you don't believe me but have to act like you do. \nPause. \nZOE (CONT'D) I can hear you breathing, Daddy. \nMITCHELL Yes.  I can hear you breathing too. \nZOE begins to cry over the phone. \nZOE Oh God, I'm scared. \nMITCHELL I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you. \nCUT TO \nINT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT \nMITCHELL is still staring at the sleeping figure of ALISON. \nALISON'S blanket has fallen to the side. \nNICOLE I won't lie. \nMITCHELL I don't want you to lie. \nNICOLE The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame. \nMITCHELL There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this. \nNICOLE You seem very sure about that. \nMITCHELL I'm absolutely positive. \nNICOLE turns to face SAM.  She stares at him. \nNICOLE No matter what I'm asked, I'll tell the truth. \nSAM looks back, expressionless. \nMITCHELL That's fine.  I want you to be absolutely truthful.  And I'll be right there to advise and help you. And there'll be a court stenographer there to make a record of it, and \nthat's what'll go to the judge, before the trial is set.  It'll be the same for everybody.  They'll be deposing the Ottos and the Walkers, the bus driver... \nNICOLE Dolores. \nMITCHELL Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last. \nNICOLE Why? \nMITCHELL So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that? \nNICOLE nods. \nSAM When do they award damages? \nMITCHELL Depends.  This could drag on for quite a while.  But we'll be there at the end, Sam.  Don't you worry. \nNICOLE (voice over) At that moment, I hated my parents - Daddy for what he knew and had done, \nNICOLE and even Mom for what she didn't know and hadn't done.  You told me it wasn't going to be easy.  But as I sat there, staring at Daddy, I knew it was going to be the easiest thing in my life. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING \nREPLAY of the scene of SEAN WALKER entering the bus.  He turns around to face his mother. \nSEAN \nI want to stay with you. \nRISA Go on now.  Go on. \nSEAN hesitantly turns to face the inside of the bus.  He sees NICOLE BURNELL, who pats the seat beside her. \nMASON leaves his place beside NICOLE to make way for SEAN. \nNICOLE C'mon, Sean, sit next to me. \nANGLE ON \nDOLORES as she watches SEAN move towards NICOLE. \nCUT TO \nINT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY \nDOLORES gives her deposition.  A stenographer takes notes. MITCHELL listens, along with SCHWARTZ, the opposing lawyer. \nDOLORES He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened. \nMITCHELL Why would he be frightened? \nMARY That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us. \nSAM Did he say what about? \nMARY No. \nSAM Was he drinking?  Could you tell? \nMARY Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed. \nJENNY Mom... \nSAM Come on, Jen.  I let you watch your nature show. \nJENNY reluctantly kisses her father goodnight, then NICOLE. As she leaves the room, MARY starts clearing the table. \nSAM (CONT'D) Is he coming over now?  Right away? \nMARY That's what he said. \nSAM is anxious.  He looks over to NICOLE. \nSAM What are you up to, Nicole? \nNICOLE Nothing. \nSAM Nothing good on your T.V.? \nNICOLE As opposed to this T.V.? \nNICOLE stares at SAM. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Besides, I'd like to see Billy. \nNICOLE stares at the television. \nANGLE ON \nOn the television screen, an image of a studio audience applauding.  The image is silent.  The T.V. is on MUTE. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) That wasn't true.  I didn't want to be seen by anyone whose kids had been killed by the accident. Especially not Billy Ansel. \nNICOLE turns her attention back to her parents. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Actually, now that I think about it, I'd just as soon stay in my room. \nNICOLE shoves her wheelchair towards her room, as the camera remains on her face. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) I remembered all the times I had tucked Jessica and Mason into bed. How they loved to have me read to them before they slept.  There was nothing for me to say to Billy, except I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that your children died when my parent's children didn't. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT \nBILLY pulls up to the BURNELL home.  He gets out of his pick up and approaches the house. \nCUT TO \nINT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT \nFrom her room, NICOLE watches as BILLY approaches the house. \nHe leaves her view as a knock is heard at the door.  NICOLE wheels over to the door and presses her ear to the door so that she can hear the conversation. \nCUT TO \nINT. BURNELL HOME.  KITCHEN. -- NIGHT \nSAM Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off. \nMARY Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left. \nSAM It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole. \nBILLY I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids. (beat) That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community. \nSAM I'm sorry. \nBILLY stares at SAM. \nBILLY I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away. \nMARY Billy, please.  The children. \nBILLY The children. \nBILLY looks at SAM and MARY, s strange smile on his face. He moves to leave.  He pauses at the door of the kitchen. \nBILLY (CONT'D) How is Nicole?  Is she around? \nMARY She's resting.  In her room. \nBILLY Say hello for me. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT \nBILLY walks to his car.  SAM and MARY watch him from the porch/ramp. \nSAM (calling out) We're getting on with our lives, Billy.  Maybe it's time you got on with yours. \nBILLY turns around, looks at SAM one final time, then moves to his pick up. \nCUT TO \nINT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT \nNICOLE is watching BILLY from her window.  She is crying. \nANGLE ON \nNICOLE'S P.O.V. of BILLY driving away. \nCUT TO \nINT. BURNELL HOME.  NICOLE'S BEDROOM. -- NIGHT \nNICOLE is lying in her bed.  A knock at the door.  SAM enters the dark bedroom and sits on the bed beside her. \nSAM Are you sleeping? \nNICOLE No. \nSAM Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over. \nNICOLE Great. \nSAM You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to. \nNICOLE \nWe used to talk a lot, didn't we, Daddy.  About all the things you were going to do for me. \nSAM What do you mean? \nNICOLE I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now? \nSAM turns away from NICOLE. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely. \nSAM Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you? \nWorried about this new information. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) It was when Sean Walker got on.  He was crying and didn't want to leave his mother.  Mason Ansel was sitting beside me.  I asked him to move, so I could quiet Sean down.  When the bus started up, a car came around \nthe corner and almost hit Sean's mother.  She was okay, but it really scared Sean, because he watched it out the window. \nSCHWARTZ And was this incident caused in any way by anything the driver of the bus did? \nPause.  MITCHELL is nervous. \nNICOLE No, she hadn't even started to move the bus.  It was the car's fault. \nMITCHELL is relieved. \nSCHWARTZ There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior? \nMITCHELL I object to that form of question. Note that. \nNICOLE (answering the question) No. \nSCHWARTZ Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up? \nNICOLE Yes. \nSCHWARTZ You remember that much? \nNICOLE As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it. \nMITCHELL is worried. \nMITCHELL Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.' \nSCHWARTZ Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto \nthe Marlowe Road at what's called Wilmot Springs? \nNICOLE Yes. \nNICOLE There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly. \nSCHWARTZ (eyebrows raised) You are? \nNICOLE Yes. \nMITCHELL (worried) Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'. \nSCHWARTZ And what was the weather like at this time? \nNICOLE It was snowing. \nMITCHELL Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question. \nSCHWARTZ I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time? \nNICOLE Before the actual accident? \nSCHWARTZ Yes. \nNICOLE stares at her father as she responds. \nNICOLE I was scared. \nSCHWARTZ Why were you scared? \nSCHWARTZ This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking? \nNICOLE Yes, I understand. \nSCHWARTZ Why were you scared? \nNICOLE Dolores was driving too fast. \nMITCHELL (in a low voice) You'd make a great poker player, kid. \nNICOLE wheels herself over to her father. \nNICOLE Let's go, Daddy. \nEXT. COMMUNITY CENTRE -- DAY \nNICOLE is in the car in front of the community centre.  She stares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps. \nNICOLE (voice over) Daddy took a long time.  I guess he wanted to have a few words with you. He must have tried to tell you that I was lying.  Then you would tell Daddy that it didn't matter if I was lying or not, the lawsuit is dead. \nAs NICOLE'S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and MITCHELL arguing is seen. \nThe movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLE'S voice over. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) Everyone's lawsuit is dead.  Forget it.  Tell the others to forget it. It's over.  Right now, Sam, the thing you've got to worry about is why she lied.  A kid who'd do that to her own father is not normal, Sam. \nSAM comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down at the driver's seat.  NICOLE stares at him as he starts the car. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) But Daddy knows who lied.  He knows who the liar is.  He knows who's normal. \nSAM stares ahead, not knowing what to do next. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (speaking to SAM) I hope he lets us keep the computer. \nSAM turns to look at NICOLE. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) I'd like an ice cream. \nCUT TO \nINT. AIRPORT. -- MORNING \nMITCHELL is at the baggage section of the arrival area, waiting for his luggage. \nHe watches PETER, the man he met in the washroom changing his daughter, playing with the little girl. \nPETER is full of love as he swings the little girl into the air as she laughs. \nMITCHELL is caught in a daydream, smiling at the happy image of father and daughter.  ALISON approaches him. \nALISON Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens. \nMITCHELL Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally. \nALISON Alison. \nMITCHELL Alison. \nALISON Say hi to Zoe. \nMITCHELL I will. \nALISON I hope she gets better. \nMITCHELL I'll tell her that. \nALISON shakes MITCHELL'S hand, and leaves. \nCUT TO \nEXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY \nSAM wheels NICOLE along a path away from the same concession stand that was seen at the beginning of the film.  NICOLE is licking an ice-cream cone.  Around them, people are setting up the bandstand. \nNICOLE Daddy, can we come to the fair? \nSAM Yes. \nNICOLE How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time. \n", "test1_input": "Around the practising band, various carpenters and technicians are making final preparations for that evening's big event. \nOne of the people watching the band is SAM BURNELL, a man in his early forties.  He watches his daughter, NICOLE, as she sings into the microphone.  NICOLE is sixteen. \nNICOLE stares at her father as she sings. \nANGLE ON \nSAM looking back at his daughter.  He is intensely proud of her.  SAM is a carpenter, working on at the fair site.  He gets back to his work, hammering a supporting beam into the grandstand. \nCUT TO \nINT. AIRPORT. WASHROOM -- AFTERNOON \nCLOSE UP of a three year old girl, staring up into the lens. Her face is full of sweetness and trust. \nANGLE ON \nMITCHELL STEPHENS in a crowded airport washroom, watching a young father, PETER, trying to change the diaper on his three year old daughter. \nMITCHELL stares at the little girl, his face registering a wistful smile.  PETER is having a hard time trying to find the towel from the toddler's bag and keeping an eye on her at the same time. \nMITCHELL Need a hand? \nPETER Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there... \nMITCHELL comes forward and searches through the toddler's bag. \nMITCHELL You always think you're prepared for these things. \nPETER Tell me about it. \nMITCHELL How old is she? \nPETER Almost three. \nMITCHELL (finding a towel) Is this it? \nPETER Perfect. \nMITCHELL Here we go. \nPETER Thanks. \nPETER lays the towel across the counter, and dries the little girl.  MITCHELL watches as PETER puts a new diaper on her.  The toddler stares up at MITCHELL, her eyes are playful. \nMITCHELL stares at the girl's face. \nCUT TO \nINT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT \nTIME CUT back to MITCHELL honking the horn of his car, trying to get someone's attention.  No response.  MITCHELL picks up his cell phone, and dials the operator. \nMITCHELL Yes, operator, I'm in a strange situation.  I'm calling from my car, and I appear to be stuck in a car wash...A car wash, yes...Is there anyway you could...Hello?...Hello?... \nThe line has died. \nMITCHELL searches for an umbrella, finds one, and tries to get out of the car without getting soaked. \nANGLE ON \nMITCHELL as he leaves the car, trying to protect himself from the onslaught of water with his umbrella.  He is immediately soaked by a large mop.  The camera watches MITCHELL as he makes his way towards light at the end of the wash. \nCUT TO \nINT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT \nMITCHELL walks into the office of the car wash.  No one is there.  There is an ominous buzz coming from another room. \nMITCHELL moves towards the garage of the car wash/auto repair establishment.  He moves into a larger room, full of discarded auto parts.  The buzzing noise is coming from an electric guitar, which has been left on, and is on the verge of screeching feedback. \n", "test1_true": "MITCHELL Hello? \nNo response.  MITCHELL picks up the guitar, which begins to produce a terrifying electronic feedback. \nCUT TO \nEXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY \nSAM and NICOLE wander through the fairground.  Various rides and concession stands are being set up.  SAM has his arm around NICOLE. \nSAM That was great. \nNICOLE Really? \nSAM You're going to blow everyone away. \nNICOLE You mean it? \nSAM Of course. \nNICOLE You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure. \nSAM I am.  Really.  It was awesome. \nNICOLE assesses SAM.  Sensing his sincerity, she throws her arms around him in a gesture of unabashed excitement. \nNICOLE I'm so happy, Daddy. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK \nMITCHELL STEPHEN'S car pulls into the parking lot of this run-down roadside motel.  In the fading light, a magnificent mountain range is seen in the background. \nCUT TO \nINT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING \nMITCHELL enters the reception area, and rings a bell on the desk.  After a few moments RISA WALKER appears.  She is an exhausted looking woman in her mid-thirties, once attractive but very run-down.  RISA stares at MITCHELL'S soaked clothes. \nMITCHELL Hello. \nRISA \nIs it raining outside? \nMITCHELL No, I...had an accident. \nPause.  RISA stares at MITCHELL, her expression somewhere else. \nMITCHELL (CONT'D) Do you have a room? \nRISA Will you be spending more than a night? \nMITCHELL Hard to say.  I might have...some business here. \nA voice is heard from the darkness beyond the desk. \nWENDELL Are you a reporter? \nMITCHELL No. \nWENDELL WALKER, RISA'S husband, appears from the darkness. \nWENDELL You here about the accident? \nMITCHELL stares at WENDELL'S haunted eyes, then looks back at RISA.  He immediately knows their story. \nMITCHELL Yes.  I'm a lawyer.  I realize this is an awful time, but it's important that we talk. \n", "test1_id": 2217, "test2_input": "CUT TO \nINT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING \nPresent time.  Night.  RISA is sitting on the bed, naked, her legs crossed.  She looks to the side, lost in thought. \nBILLY is behind her, putting on his clothes. \nBILLY What are you thinking? \nRISA Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me. \nBILLY That's because he misses you. \nRISA Yes. \nBILLY It's natural. \nRISA Your kids never cry. \nBILLY Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus. \nRISA They can look forward to that. \nBILLY Sure. \nRISA Just like we look forward to this. \nBILLY looks at RISA and smiles at her with affection.  He moves to the door. \nRISA (CONT'D) You're leaving. \nBILLY I better get back. \nRISA nods. \nRISA Good night, Billy. \nBILLY Good night. \nBILLY leaves.  RISA, still naked, moves to the washroom. She stares into the tub, noticing that the white enamel that WENDELL has applied has been washed away from BILLY'S shower. \nRISA picks up a tube of the enamel, and begins to re-apply it. \nCUT TO \nINT. BILLY'S HOUSE. -- EVENING \nNICOLE shows BILLY the clothes she has chosen.  BILLY stares at the selection. \nNICOLE Are you sure? \nBILLY Yeah. \nNICOLE It just seems...kind of weird. \nBILLY Why? \nNICOLE I don't know. \nBILLY Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it. \nNICOLE No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her. \nBILLY And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or... \nBILLY trails off, suddenly consumed with sadness. \nNICOLE What do you mean 'outgrown it'? \nBILLY I'm not sure. \n", "test2_true": "NICOLE turns to leave, taking the clothes with her. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Goodnight, Mr. Ansel. \nBILLY Goodnight, Nicole. \nNICOLE leaves the house and walks towards the car where her father is waiting. \nCUT TO \nINT.

BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT \nSAM drives up the driveway to the Burnell home.  He opens the door, and takes a blanket from the back.  NICOLE gets out as well.  The two walk towards the barn. \nNICOLE (voice over) Once more he stept into the street, And to his lips again Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane; And ere he blew three notes such sweet soft notes as yet musician's cunning Never gave the enraptured air - There was a rustling, seemed like a bustling Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling, Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, \nLittle hands clapping and little tongues chattering, And, like fowls in a farm-yard when the barley is scattering, Out came the children running. All the little boys and girls, With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls. Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after The wonderful music with shouting and laughter... \nInside the barn, SAM and NICOLE are engaged in a sexual embrace.  The camera glides past them as NICOLE's voice continues to read from the poem. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) (voice over) When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side, A wondrous portal opened wide, As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed; And the Piper advanced and the children followed, And when all were in to the very last, The door in the mountain-side shut fast... \nCUT TO \nINT. BUS -- DAY \nCLOSE-UP of NICOLE in the bus as it makes it's way to school.  She seems to be listening to her own voice as it reads from the poem. \nNICOLE (voice over) Did I say, all?  No!  One was lame, And could not dance the whole of the way; And in after years, if you would blame His sadness, he was used to say,- 'It's dull in the town since my \nplaymates left! I can't forget that I'm bereft Of all the pleasant sights they see, Which the Piper also promised me. For me led us, he said, to a joyous land, Joining the town and just at hand, Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, And flowers put forth a fairer hue, And everything was strange and new... \nOn this last line, NICOLE's lips begin to move, as she repeats the line out loud to herself. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) Everything was strange and new. \nCUT TO \nEXT.

Will you let me do that?  Will you let me do my duty? \nSuddenly, ABBOTT says something.  He twists his face around his mouth, purses his lips on the left side and emits a string of broken syllables and sounds.  After this outburst, DOLORES looks at MITCHELL, a comforted smile on her face. \nDOLORES You heard what Abbott said? \nMITCHELL Yes. \nDOLORES Anything you didn't understand? \nMITCHELL There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure. \nDOLORES Abbott said that the true jury of a person's peers is the people of her town.  Only they, the people who have known her all her life, and not twelve strangers, can decide her guilt or innocence.  And if I have committed a crime, then it's a crime against them, so they are the ones who must decide my punishment. \nMITCHELL stares at ABBOTT, who stares back. \nMITCHELL That's what he said, is it? \nDOLORES Yes.  Abbot understands these things. \nCUT TO \nEXT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY \nMITCHELL leaves the DRISCOLL house, watched by DOLORES. \nINT. HOSPITAL -- MORNING \nNICOLE BURNELL is in bed.  A doctor, DR. ROBESON, is touching her forehead.  NICOLE'S family (SAM, her mother MARY, and her little sister JENNY) \nDR. ROBESON The mind is kind. \nThe camera fixes on NICOLE'S expression as she stares ahead. \nNICOLE (voice over) They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident. \nSAM Don't even try to remember. \nMARY You just think about getting well, Nicole, that's all. \nThe camera is always fixed on NICOLE'S face when her voice over is heard. \nNICOLE \n(voice over) I know I'm as well as I ever can be again.  So shut up, Mom.  To stay like this, to live like a slug, I'm going to have to work like someone trying to get into the Olympics. \nSAM Just wait till you see what we've got waiting for you at home. \nCUT TO \nINT. HOSPITAL -- DAY \nNICOLE, in a wheelchair, is being led down a hallway with her family. \nNICOLE (voice over) It's an incredible relief to be leaving the hospital.  I'm so sick of looking at my doctor, listening to Frankenstein ask me stupid questions about what I was feeling... \nCUT TO \nINT. HOSPITAL. LOBBY. -- DAY \nNICOLE is being wheeled to the front door of the hospital. \nNICOLE (voice over, continuing) He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster. \nMARY Isn't it a lovely day? \nNICOLE What happened to summer? \n", "test3_true": "NICOLE And winter? \nMARY Well, winter's far behind us now. \nNICOLE How was it? \nMARY We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam? \nSAM nods. \nNICOLE Good thing I was in Florida. \nMARY doesn't know quite what to make of NICOLE'S joke.  SAM flashes NICOLE a smile.  She doesn't return it. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY \nNICOLE arrives at home.  The car pulls up in front of the modest house. \nSAM opens the door and puts the wheelchair up next to it. He points out the ramp he has built for NICOLE. \nThe ramp is painted green. \nSAM How do you like it, Nicole? \nNICOLE The ramp? \nSAM Pretty slick, eh? \nNICOLE Very slick. \nSAM Do you like the colour? \nNICOLE It's okay. \nSAM And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see. \nCUT TO \nINT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY \nInside the house.  The interior of the house is dark and somewhat tawdry.  The BURNELL'S are almost poor. \nBut SAM then leads NICOLE into the special room he has built for her.  It seems like another world.  Every detail has been lovingly attended to.  No expense has been spared to make this room as attractive and inviting as possible. \nA room that a guilty, abusive father might dream up for his crippled daughter. \nSAM What do you think? \nPause.

{"test1_input": "CUT TO \nEXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY \nA group of men are setting up the ferris wheel for the country fair.  SAM and NICOLE walk into the shot, eating ice cream cones.  SAM waves at someone he recognizes in the distance. \nSAM Let's sit down. \nNICOLE nods, her mind elsewhere. \nCUT TO \nEXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY \nSAM and NICOLE are sitting at an outside table, finishing their cones. \nA school bus pulls up into the fairground.  NICOLE watches as young children spill out of the bus and gather outside. \nNICOLE smiles at this scene.  SAM notices, turns around to see the children, then turns back to NICOLE. \nSAM What's so funny? \nNICOLE Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life. \nANGLE ON \nDOLORES DRISCOLL, a warm and cheery woman in her forties, leading the young children into the large exhibition barn on the fair site. \nDOLORES Alright, kids.  I want you all to listen to me.  Rule number one  No one is allowed to stick their fingers into the cages.  I don't care how cute some of these animals may be, the fact is they don't like being here, no matter how many ribbons some of them have won... \nCUT TO \nINT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING \nMITCHELL STEPHENS is having a meeting with WENDELL and RISA WALKER in their livingroom behind the reception area. MITCHELL has a pad of paper and is taking notes. \nWENDELL Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work. \nMITCHELL In what way? \nWENDELL Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough. \nMITCHELL Any criminal record? \nWENDELL Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more. \nWENDELL Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze. \nMITCHELL How does the family survive? \nWENDELL Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by. \nMITCHELL looks at RISA, who has remained silent. \nMITCHELL What about Doreen? \nRISA She...she was a friend of mine. \nMITCHELL When? \nRISA At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle... \nMITCHELL That's the local bar? \nRISA (nodding) ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and... \nRISA hesitates. \nWENDELL Taking it out on her. \nMITCHELL stops taking notes, and looks at the WALKERS. \n", "test1_true": "RISA nods.  MITCHELL crosses the LAMBSTONS off of his list. He looks up at RISA and WENDELL. \nMITCHELL (CONT'D) You see, to do this right, to actually have a chance at winning - of getting some money to compensate you for the loss of your boy - we need folks like you.  Sensitive, loving parents.  People with no criminal background or history of trouble in town.  Do you understand? \nThe WALKERS nod. \nMITCHELL (CONT'D) Now, of all these parents you've told me about whose kids were killed, who would you consider to be good upstanding neighbors? \nRISA stares hard at MITCHELL. \nRISA What do you mean? \nMITCHELL People who will help our cause. \nPause. \nRISA Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton. \nWENDELL (caustically) Yeah, right. \nBeat.  MITCHELL looks at WENDELL, waiting for an explanation. \nWENDELL (CONT'D) \nI mean, everyone knows Joey steals antiques from summer cottages. Resells them to dealers in the city. He's been doing that for years. \nMITCHELL regards WENDELL with a slight smile of admiration. \nMITCHELL That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on. \nRISA There's the Prescots... \nWENDELL That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car. \nRISA But Charlene... \nWENDELL Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts. \nMITCHELL is taking notes. \nWENDELL (CONT'D) Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred. \nRISA The Ottos. \nPause.  MITCHELL waits.  No response from WENDELL. \nMITCHELL Tell me about the Ottos. \nRISA Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian. \nMITCHELL Indian? \nRISA Yes. \nMITCHELL That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos. \nAs RISA talks, MITCHELL takes notes. \nRISA They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago. \nMITCHELL What do they do? \nRISA Crafts. \nMITCHELL Crafts? \nRISA Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall. \nWENDELL Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed. \n", "test1_id": 2217, "test2_input": "MITCHELL stares at DOLORES. \nMITCHELL Dolores, people have to know that you've suffered too. \nMITCHELL And they won't understand until you let me clear your name - your good name - once and for all.  Will you let me do that?  Will you let me do my duty? \nSuddenly, ABBOTT says something.  He twists his face around his mouth, purses his lips on the left side and emits a string of broken syllables and sounds.  After this outburst, DOLORES looks at MITCHELL, a comforted smile on her face. \nDOLORES You heard what Abbott said? \nMITCHELL Yes. \nDOLORES Anything you didn't understand? \nMITCHELL There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure. \nDOLORES Abbott said that the true jury of a person's peers is the people of her town.  Only they, the people who have known her all her life, and not twelve strangers, can decide her guilt or innocence.  And if I have committed a crime, then it's a crime against them, so they are the ones who must decide my punishment. \nMITCHELL stares at ABBOTT, who stares back. \nMITCHELL That's what he said, is it? \nDOLORES Yes.  Abbot understands these things. \nCUT TO \nEXT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY \nMITCHELL leaves the DRISCOLL house, watched by DOLORES. \nINT. HOSPITAL -- MORNING \nNICOLE BURNELL is in bed.  A doctor, DR. ROBESON, is touching her forehead.  NICOLE'S family (SAM, her mother MARY, and her little sister JENNY) \nDR. ROBESON The mind is kind. \nThe camera fixes on NICOLE'S expression as she stares ahead. \nNICOLE (voice over) They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident. \nSAM Don't even try to remember. \nMARY You just think about getting well, Nicole, that's all. \nThe camera is always fixed on NICOLE'S face when her voice over is heard. \nNICOLE \n(voice over) I know I'm as well as I ever can be again.  So shut up, Mom.  To stay like this, to live like a slug, I'm going to have to work like someone trying to get into the Olympics. \nSAM Just wait till you see what we've got waiting for you at home. \nCUT TO \nINT. HOSPITAL -- DAY \nNICOLE, in a wheelchair, is being led down a hallway with her family. \nNICOLE (voice over) It's an incredible relief to be leaving the hospital.  I'm so sick of looking at my doctor, listening to Frankenstein ask me stupid questions about what I was feeling... \nCUT TO \nINT. HOSPITAL. LOBBY. -- DAY \nNICOLE is being wheeled to the front door of the hospital. \nNICOLE (voice over, continuing) He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster. \nMARY Isn't it a lovely day? \nNICOLE What happened to summer? \n", "test2_true": "NICOLE And winter? \nMARY Well, winter's far behind us now. \nNICOLE How was it? \nMARY We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam? \nSAM nods. \nNICOLE Good thing I was in Florida. \nMARY doesn't know quite what to make of NICOLE'S joke.  SAM flashes NICOLE a smile.  She doesn't return it. \nCUT TO \nEXT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY \nNICOLE arrives at home.  The car pulls up in front of the modest house. \nSAM opens the door and puts the wheelchair up next to it. He points out the ramp he has built for NICOLE. \nThe ramp is painted green. \nSAM How do you like it, Nicole? \nNICOLE The ramp? \nSAM Pretty slick, eh? \nNICOLE Very slick. \nSAM Do you like the colour? \nNICOLE It's okay. \nSAM And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see. \nCUT TO \nINT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY \nInside the house.  The interior of the house is dark and somewhat tawdry.  The BURNELL'S are almost poor. \nBut SAM then leads NICOLE into the special room he has built for her.  It seems like another world.  Every detail has been lovingly attended to.  No expense has been spared to make this room as attractive and inviting as possible. \nA room that a guilty, abusive father might dream up for his crippled daughter. \nSAM What do you think? \nPause.  NICOLE wheels around, trying to control her emotions as she inspects the room.  A phone rings in the background. MARY goes to answer it. \nNICOLE fixes her gaze at the back of the door. \nNICOLE The door needs a lock. \nSAM (taken aback) Sure.  I'll fix it right away. \nSAM goes to get his tools.  JENNY stares at NICOLE. \nJENNY Can I come and visit you here? \nNICOLE You better.  And you can sleep in my new bed with me too. \nNICOLE grabs her sister's hand, and JENNY moves in close to her.  SAM comes back with the tools.  He starts to screw in the hook. \nNICOLE (CONT'D) That's too high.  I'll never reach it. \nSAM (nervous) Oh.  I better get some spackle. \n", "test2_id": 2218, "test3_input": "MITCHELL Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe. \nZOE You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer. \nMITCHELL Tell me your news, Zoe. \nZOE Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood. \nMITCHELL That's not news, Zoe. \nZOE No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood. \nCUT TO \nINT. CAR -- DAY \nImage of ZOE as a little girl in MITCHELL'S lap.  Her face is swollen.  She is being driven to the hospital. \nMITCHELL is singing her a lullaby. \nMiTCHELL's conversation with ZOE continues over this image. \nZOE Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register? \nMITCHELL Yes. \nZOE I tested positive. \nMITCHELL Yes. \nZOE Welcome to hard times, Daddy. \nPause. \nMITCHELL What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want. \nZOE I need money. \nMITCHELL What for? \nZOE You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money. \nMITCHELL Do you have the blood test? \nZOE You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me? \nMITCHELL Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another \ntest.  In case the one you got...was wrong. \nZOE I like it when you don't believe me, Daddy.  It's better you don't believe me but have to act like you do. \nPause. \nZOE (CONT'D) I can hear you breathing, Daddy. \nMITCHELL Yes.  I can hear you breathing too. \nZOE begins to cry over the phone. \nZOE Oh God, I'm scared. \nMITCHELL I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you. \nCUT TO \nINT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT \nMITCHELL is still staring at the sleeping figure of ALISON. \nALISON'S blanket has fallen to the side. \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO \nEXT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY \nMITCHELL drives up to the BURNELL home.  He gets out of his car and walks to the front door. \nSAM has repainted the ramp. \nIt is now red. \nCUT TO \nINT. BURNELL HOME.  KITCHEN -- DAY \nMITCHELL meets NICOLE.  SAM and MARY are also seated at the table. \nThe meeting takes place in the kitchen/diningroom. \nMITCHELL Well, Nicole, I've been wanting to meet you for a long time now.  Not just because I've heard so many good things about you, but because, as you know, I'm the guy representing you and your mom and dad and some other folks here in town.  We're trying to generate some compensation, however meager, for what you have suffered, and at the same time see that an accident like this never happens again.  You're central to the case I'm trying to build, Nicole.  But you'd probably just as soon let the whole thing lie.  Just get on with your life as quickly and smoothly as possible. \nNICOLE nods.  Pause, as MITCHELL waits for her to go on. \nNICOLE I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and... \nMITCHELL You hate that. \nNICOLE nods. \nSAM What she means, Mitch... \nMITCHELL silences SAM with a gesture of his hand. \nMITCHELL People can't help it, you know. They really can't.  When they see you in this wheelchair, knowing what your life was life eight months ago, people are going to feel sorry for you.  There's no way around it, Nicole.  You and I just met, and already I admire you.  Who wouldn't? You're a brave tough smart kid. That's obvious.  And I didn't know you, know how exciting and promising \nyour life was before the accident. But listen, even I feel sorry for you. \nNICOLE You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky. \nMITCHELL That you didn't die?  Like the other children? \nNICOLE Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and... \nMARY Nicole! \nNICOLE It's the truth. \nMITCHELL regards MARY with calm authority, as though he's telling her the time. \nMITCHELL It is the truth. \nPause.  MITCHELL looks back at NICOLE. \nMITCHELL (CONT'D) It would be strange if you didn't feel that way. \nNICOLE (after a slight pause) What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens? \nCUT TO \nINT. BURNELL HOME.  LIVINGROOM. -- DAY \nTIME CUT fifteen minutes forward.  The scene shifts to the livingroom. \nMITCHELL and NICOLE are alone in the room.  SAM comes back from another room, as MARY appears from the kitchen with a plate of cookies. \nNICOLE (voice over) \nThat got you talking about depositions and lawyers.  By the time Daddy came back from the washroom and Mom came in with her tea and cookies, you were going on about how tough it would be for me to answer some of the questions those other lawyers would ask . \nMITCHELL They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side. \n", "test3_id": 2219}

SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN 
Belle rubs her hands over her rounded ass and flicks her tongue at Boss Man. 
BELLE You wanna see, baby? 
BOSS MAN Hell yeah. 
BELLE How much you got? 
BOSS MAN How much I got, what? 
BELLE How much you got to see the show? 
BOSS MAN You don't understand, sweety. Daddy doesn't pay. Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this. 
She cringes and backs up a little. 
BELLE What? 
BOSS MAN You can't expect a man to buy a car without a test drive first, can you? 
BELLE Um, hmm -- 
BOSS MAN Now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising. 
SECOND FLOOR 
Bozo barks into the CB. 
BOZO Repeat. We need help. SOS. Calling all cars! Calling all cars! We need help at the United Nations Tav -- 
The CB is JERKED from Bozo's hands and slams into the wall. 
BOZO Shit! 
Bozo aims the gun at the wall. Chewing sounds begin. 
BOZO Double shit! 
He backs up to the door. 
OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
BOZO (O.S.) Okay, I'm ready to come out now! 
Bartender confidently turns the key. CLICK! It breaks off in the lock. 
BARTENDER Oh! 
SECOND FLOOR 
BOZO "OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean? 
Bozo knocks on the door hard. 
BOZO HEY! OPEN IT!!! 
OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
Bartender looks to Coach. 
BARTENDER Wha? 
SECOND FLOOR 
BOZO OPEN THE DOOR!!! 
A thunderous CRASH! Boards fly off the wall. 
SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN 
Belle, hearing the crash, jerks back from Boss Man. 
BELLE What was that? 
CRASH! Sister Beast #1 and Sister Beast #2 punch through the tiny wall fan and GRAB Belle by the scalp. She is JERKED against the wall. 
She's slammed against it repeatedly and then -- RIP! Belle's skin is TORN from her head and torso. Boss Man jumps back.

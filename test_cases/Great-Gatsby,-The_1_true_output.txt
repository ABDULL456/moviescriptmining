He looks squarely at himself, and repeats a mantra. 
YOUNG GATSBY Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. A pleasure to meet you, sir. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CODY'S YACHT - DAY 
Young Gatsby stands at the bow, as the yacht cut across the clear blue ocean... He turns to Cody and calls... 
YOUNG GATSBY She looks well, doesn't she...!? Old sport. 
HIGH AND WIDE: The yacht sails toward the golden sun... 
NICK (V.O.) Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody's fortune... But when Cody died, Gatsby was cheated out of his inheritance by Cody's family... He'd been left with an ability to play the gentleman, but he was once again dirt poor. 
SLAM CUT TO: 
NEWSPAPER MONTAGE. 
Piles and piles of New York City newspapers swirl rapidly TOWARD CAMERA, and we read their headlines: 
"GATBSY'S STAGGERING WEALTH - MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!" 
NICK (V.O.) By midsummer Gatsby was front page news... 
"GATSBY BUYING OUR CITY? INVESTMENT MONOPOLY FUELS CONCERNS" 
"JAY CASHES IN! GATSBY STRIKES WALL STREET GOLD!" 
"GATSBY INVESTS IN SKYSCRAPERS!" 
"JAY PAYS FOR EVERYTHING: PARTIES, GALAS, PARKS, SCHOOLS!" 
"WALL STREETS KING? MEET JAY GATSBY!" 
A final newspaper COVERS FRAME: 
"WHERE'S THE MONEY FROM!? MYSTERY MILLIONS SPARK WILD RUMORS" 
We PUSH TOWARD the paper and DISSOLVE TOWARD: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - NIGHT 
Another glittering party. 
NICK (V.O.) Where did the money comes from? 
FADE IN: Decadent, grotesque images of drunken revellers... 
NICK (V.O.) That's what all of New York wanted to know. And it was the same question on Tom's mind when he accompanied Daisy to one of Gatsby's glittering parties... 
DISCOVER: Gatsby leading Tom, Daisy and Nick to the top of the terrace stairs. 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TERRACE/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 
GATSBY We've got a great band here. Have a look around... Excuse me... 
He turns briefly to talk to Senator Gulick... 
TOM (mutters to Daisy) A lot of these newly rich people are just filthy bootleggers. 
DAISY Not Gatsby. He's a businessman. 
TOM (SNORTS) Hah! A businessman... 
DAISY He owned a lot of drug stores. 
Gatsby gracefully introduces Senator Gulick to the group... 
GATSBY May I introduce Senator Gulick? This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs. Buchanan... 
DAISY Delighted... 
GATSBY And Mr. Buchanan... (a moment's hesitation) The polo player. 
TOM (OBJECTING QUICKLY) Oh no. Not me. 
SENATOR GULICK (shaking hands, nods) Always a pleasure to meet a Buchanan. 
Gatsby bids the Senator farewell, while Tom glowers to Daisy: 
TOM I'd rather not be the polo player. 
DAISY Oh Tom... You should be proud of your achievements. 
GATSBY INTERJECTS-- 
GATSBY (to the group) May I show you around? 
He guides them down the stairs... 
GATSBY (CONT'D) You must see the faces of a lot of people you've heard of. 
DAISY Absolutely! 
TOM (SCOFFS) We don't go around very much. I don't think I recognize a single person... 
GATSBY Perhaps you know that lady there? 
Gatsby indicates a lovely, orchid of a woman: MARLENE MOON, the silent film star. 
DAISY (taking Gatsby's arm) Its Marlene Moon... I adore her pictures... 
As Gatsby leads Daisy, we catch Tom repeating to Nick...

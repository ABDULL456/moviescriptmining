Terrible. Tell me something. When you talk to Miss Cross the other 
day, did you get the feeling- 
The hall monitor Mr. Holstead comes down the hall toward Max. He is a big, sturdy man about fifty years old. He wears a striped tie and his sleeves rolled up. 
MR HOLSTEAD 
(loudly) 
Do you have a telephone pass? 
Max holds up his hand for Mr. Holstead to wait a minute. He covers his ear so he can hear Mr. Blume. 
Mr. Blume is looking in the windows of different classrooms. Kids look out at him curiously. 
MR. BLUME 
I got to tell you, Max. I don't know what you see in her. I don't think she's right for you. 
MAX 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Mr. Blume sees Miss Cross inside teaching her class. He stares at her in a glance. He whispers: 
MR. BLUME 
Well, she's not that beautiful. She's not that interesting. I mean, sure, there's something about her. But I see you with someone- 
MAX 
Look, Mr. Blume. Your comments are valuable, but let's get to the point. Will she see me again? Yes or no? 
MR. BLUME 
(pause) 
No. 
MAX 
I'm going to go see her. Hang on. 
Max looks to Mr. Holstead. 
MAX 
I'm talking on the telephone. 
Mr. Holstead reaches over and hangs up the phone. 
MAX 
Come on, man. That's rude. 
INT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Mrs. Whitney watches from her classroom window at: 
Max opens a red metal door on to the empty concrete courtyard. He looks left and right. He sneaks across the courtyard to the bike racks, quickly unlocks his bike, and rides away. 
EXT. RUSHMORE - DAY 
Max rides full speed through the gates on to the Rushmore campus. He flips one leg off his bike and glides in toward the bike racks standing on one pedal. 
Max locks up his bike and walks across the lawn. 
MAGNUS 
You better beat it, laddie. 
Max looks up at Magnus Buchan sitting in a tree smoking a cigarette, hacking at a branch with a pocketknife. 
MAX 
I hope you fall out of that tree and get stick in the ass, Buchan. 
MAGNUS 
You know, I've watched you, Fischer. Showboat, always talking, picking a kid like Dirk cause his mother's a great piece and then getting nowhere. Like everything you do. Big show. No results. 
MAX 
And what do you call getting a hand job from Mrs. Calloway in her Jaguar? 
MAGNUS 
A bloody lie. 
MAX 
You think I got kicked out for just the aquarium? Nah. That ain't it. It was the hand job. And I'll tell you another thing. It was worth it. So eat your heard out, mick. I got business to attend to. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
Miss Cross comes out the door of the lower school with a basket of books and papers. She stops in front of her wagon and digs in her bag for the keys. 
MAX 
Or do you want me to go? 
MISS CROSS 
(looks around, sighs) 
You can talk to me. 
Miss Cross goes over to him. She stops a few feet away and they stand there in silence. 
MAX 
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner. 
MISS CROSS 
That's OK. 
MAX 
No, it's not. And please apologize to what's his name for me. 
MISS CROSS 
I will. Are you OK? 
MAX 
I'm fine. But I miss Rushmore. I miss the seasons. And watching the leaves change. 
MISS CROSS 
But it's only three blocks away. 
MAX 
I know. I miss seeing you. 
MISS CROSS 
(pause) 
I miss you, too.

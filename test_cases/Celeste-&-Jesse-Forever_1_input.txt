Celeste bursts in with all types of nervous energy. 
CELESTE The thing is, I have been having a really hard time in my life, everything is sort of falling apart and when you said that thing about contempt and investigation, it just sort of hit a nerve and... 
RILEY Just, shut up for a minute. 
Riley is in tears. 
RILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD) I just found out my boyfriend cheated on me. 
CELESTE Oh. God, I'm sorry. I didn't even know you had a boyfriend. 
RILEY Nobody knew. He didn't want anybody to know. Fucking ass hole. And now, my career might be over because you put a penis in my logo. Thank you for that. 
Riley is clearly destroyed. 
RILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD) I didn't know who to call. 
Celeste gives Riley a big hug. 
CELESTE So you called the smartest person you know. 
Riley smiles through her tears. 
CUT TO: 
87 INT. RILEY'S HOUSE- HOLLYWOOD HILLS-LATER THAT NIGHT 87 
Riley is asleep on the couch with a blanket over her. Celeste is up, watching "Great Sports Moments of 2008" on ESPN Classic. 
It is a recap of Matthias Steiner's Olympic weight lifting triumph after his wife died. Jesse's favorite. Celeste is crying. This wakes Riley up. 
RILEY Are you crying? 
Celeste turns off the television. 
CELESTE Oh, yeah, this just reminds me of someone. 
RILEY A guy? 
CELESTE Yeah. A guy. 
RILEY You miss him? 
CELESTE Yeah, I do. 
RILEY They all fucking suck. 
CELESTE Kind of. 
RILEY So it never gets better? 
CELESTE No, it doesn't. But you do. You're gonna be fine. 
88 INT. DRY CLEANER'S-MORNING 88 
Celeste is runs into a dry cleaners. She is out of breathe. The long line of impatient people to see this dragon breather who has broke the silence. She looks at her watch. She stands diligently in line. 
Celeste's phone rings loudly. She picks it up. 
CELESTE Hi...I know I won't...no I'm on the road already! Near...Bakersfield? Of course I'll be there...love you too. 
She hangs up and was clearly lying. She must do something. Something she does not want to do. She looks at the stoic woman in front of her. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I'm so sorry but I am the maid of honor and I am supposed to be at the wedding real far away, would you mind if I just got in front of you?... 
The woman reluctantly waves her to pass. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Thank you so much, I really do appreciate...sir? 
A disinterested man barely acknowledges Celeste. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I'm incredibly late for this wedding and my dress is here, is there any way... 
He moves aside. The next man just stares at her. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Hi. I'm sure you heard me ask the last guy but... 
The camera pulls out. A wide shot of Celeste, imprisoned by her own rules, asking every person to cut. It looks tedious and ridiculous.

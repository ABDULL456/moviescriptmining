{"train": "Three Men and a Baby \nWritten by \nCOLINE SERREAU and \nJAMES ORR and \nJAMES CRUICKSHANK \nNovember 1986 \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nTHREE MEN AND A BABY \nFADE IN: \nJACK God, what a woman! Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car. JACK Wanna share a cab? Paul Yeah, sure! A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him. JACK She's so beautiful! I've never been so in love before. Can you believe she gave me her phone number... Oh, Christ -- where is it?... Oh, no, don't tell me I lost it... It's a matter of life and death... Oh here it is -- thank God! All the while    Jack has been rambling on, a beige car on the other    side of the street has slowed down. Paul notices it.     In the beige car, a narcotics agent, GRATON, is behind the    wheel with one of his colleagues sitting beside him. GRATON They're slowing down.    Take a picture. The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to be standing near the black Ford, including Jack and Paul. The black Ford pulls out. The beige car follows it. Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye. PAUL Listen, I need a favor, I got \na little problem. JACK Yeah, sure... Hey, look, will you -- look at that sparkling beauty. \nA very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with cart overflowing with luggage. One of them falls off. PAUL Yeah... I mean, it's like... There's this little package... JACK She'll never make it with all that luggage she's got. I gotta give her a hand. Look at the colors in her hair! Christ, I've never seen a woman like her before... He's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm. PAUL Jack, listen, can I... JACK Sure you can, no problem... Listen, I gotta go now, I'm gonna see if she'll share a cab with me.  You take the shuttle, okay? PAUL But I gotta explain to you about... JACK Come over to my place tonight. We're having a huge party. Come around 9, okay? See ya later. \nJack races toward the woman and begins to help her with the fallen luggage. We see him talking to her and we can hear a little of what he's saying. JACK As exquisite as you are... I think I'm gonna faint. He kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart. The young woman is flabbergasted. A lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus. \n3   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                    3 A large, stylishly decorated apartment in Manhattan. A tremendous living room. A party's going on. Very LOUD JAZZ is PLAYING. The lights are dim. There are about 30 guests. Lots of young pretty women. Gourmet buffet. People are sitting on couches talking, others are eating, drinking or dancing. In a dimly-lit corner, Jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair. She is laughing as she listens to him. JACK (whispering passionately) This is no line and I'm not trying to get you into bed. This is something completely different. This is 'love at first sight.' Oh, I'm so happy... Let me go get you a glass of champagne. I'll be right back. Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. As soon as he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running toward the other end of the apartment. On the way he passes MICHAEL, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement conversation about modern art with a girl called SOPHIA. They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy- ing it. SOPHIA Are you saying that's art, are you really saying that's art? Well then you explain why. MICHAEL It goes back to prehistoric man. They had comic strips on their walls, for God's sake. JACK (whispering in Michael's ear) I'm having a hard time.    I'm working on two at once. MICHAEL (very interested) Oh yeah, who? JACK The brunette in the armchair in the living room -- her name's Rosalie... MICHAEL \nAnd the other one? JACK Clementine -- she's waiting for me in the den. \nHe moves away towards the den. MICHAEL (to Sophia) Wait one second for me, I'll be right back. Michael walks off in the direction of Rosalie. Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack, he sees PETER who is talking with another young woman, NICOLE. Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com- pletely uninterested in the conversation. NICOLE You guys have a beautiful place here. But the rent must be a killer. Peter isn't paying attention. NICOLE Isn't it a killer? PETER What?... PETER (CONT'D) Oh,    the rent... yeah, it's high but    split between the three of us    it isn't that bad, as long as    we don't eat. Nicole laughs. PAUL Hi Peter, I'm looking for Jack, have you seen him? PETER Oh hi, Paul, how are you doing? Yeah, sure, I'll take you to Jack. (to Nicole) Excuse me for a minute. They move away. PETER You're a lifesaver, I've been trying to get away from that woman \nfor 20 minutes. That sonofabitch Carl is moving in on my Natalie. Gotta go... bye. PAUL Wait -- What about Jack? \nPETER (in a hurry) He's around somewhere.     Check under all the couches. Paul walks off in Jack's direction. We STAY WITH Peter, who reaches Natalie. She is talking with a very styl- ishly-dressed, tall, young man, CARL. \n5   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                     5 In the kitchen Peter is straightening up. Michael joins him, dumping the ashes. Peter begins washing the glasses. PETER Where's Jack?    Did he leave? MICHAEL No, he's cuddling up with a blonde named Clementine... PETER That's not Clementine. I saw him doing his famous routine with Christie... \nMICHAEL No, it is Clementine, the one with the tits this big... PETER Christie's got tits that big, too... MICHAEL Yeah, but he was with Christie at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with Rosalie and then with Clementine. And since I stole Rosalie away from him... Are you following this? \nPETER I'm not. Jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing. JACK Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you try... Any scotch left? PETER Yeah, here, I just put it away. JACK Sorry I can't give you guys a hand, but I've got something cooking. PETER I thought you were leaving at dawn for South America? JACK I am, the night's still young!... It's gonna be a lively one. I'm gonna make us a little snack. He makes up a tray with sandwiches. MICHAEL So, who is it anyway -- Christie or Clementine? JACK Maxine.    Beautiful, enchanting Maxine. Peter and Michael look at one another surprised, mouthing silently, \"Maxine?\" \nJACK Hey, Michael -- how'd it go with Rosalie? MICHAEL Well, things were going great until... JACK Your old friend Sophia appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime Rosalie took off with someone else. MICHAEL How did you know? JACK I dunno -- lucky guess... MICHAEL Well, I don't give a damn anyway, I have 24 drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and I gotta work all night anyway... So it was all for the best. But you better not leave that Maxine's phone number lying around because when I'm done... JACK Don't worry, I'll leave you her phone number on the hall table. If she's really terrific I'll put a big 'X' next to it. 'Bye, guys -- love ya. I won't wake you tomorrow morning. See you in three weeks... \n6   INT. APARTMENT - DAWN                                       6 Jack and Maxine noiselessly exit the   apartment. Jack is wearing his pilot's uniform. Maxine    pushes the button for the elevator. Jack sneaks back    into the apartment and leaves a note on the hall table   that says: \"Maxine 227-2013.\" Next to the number Jack    has put a big \"X.\" \n7   EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF APARTMENT - DAWN                    7 Jack and Maxine exchange a brief kiss and go their separate ways. \n8   EXT./INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PLANE                            8 \nJack is in the cockpit with his copilot, RON. The ENGINES are REVVING. Jack is checking gauges. He looks out the window idly and sees: The crew of another plane walking across the tarmac. Paul is one of the crew. Paul sees Jack and begins to gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise of the ENGINES. Just seeing Paul is enough to remind Jack about his package. JACK Damn! I forgot to tell them about the package! (to Ron) I gotta make a quick phone call. I'll be right back. RON (knowingly) Jack, there'll be plenty of girls where we're going. JACK Oh, c'mon, I've really got to make a phone call! What do you think I'm going to do, pick up one of the New Jersey delegates to the I.B.M. convention? Jack walks back towards the phone. As he walks we see that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen. \n9   INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY                            9 In the architecture firm of which Peter is one of three partners. The whole staff, about 15 people in all, is gathered around a large model, the project for a big amusement park. They all seem worried about something. JERRY, one of Peter's partners, seems particularly angry. JERRY The model's not finished, the blueprints are a mess and you may as well forget the specs, they're a disaster! I know we're talented. I know we're good. Then why is it we can never get organized? Why is it we're always behind schedule? JAY Look, Jerry, architects since Leonardo have always been behind schedule. It's a tradition, for \nPETER She lives in Miami for Christsake. She can't stop the baby crying from Miami. MICHAEL Well, just to ask her advice... PETER No, he said not to tell anyone... MICHAEL But this is an emergency! PETER No! No way! You know what a pain that woman is -- she'll be on the next plane here to move in with us... MICHAEL Maybe I should call my mother... PETER No, please -- leave the mothers out of this, okay?! It's only four days. We should be able to handle that, besides you know the rule around here: it's fine to have a woman over once in a while, but... Michael finishes the sentence in unison with him. PETER AND MICHAEL ... never for more than one night at a time! PETER And that includes mothers! Peter steps over the basket and heads towards the elevator. MICHAEL Where are you going?! PETER I'm going to the store to buy some baby food. MICHAEL What am I supposed to do while you're gone? PETER Pick her up and hold her. \nMICHAEL (panic-stricken) Whaddya mean, pick her up? I've never held a baby -- I'll drop her! \nPeter is already gone. \n12   INT. SAFEWAY - DAY                                           12 Peter enters the store and rushes right over to a store CLERK. PETER What aisle's baby food on? CLERK Down there by the meat section. Peter heads for it purposefully. When he    gets to the right aisle, he stops short, taken aback:    a vast range of products extends before him. He starts    examining the baby food jars and cans of formulas, going   from one to the next, not knowing where to begin. \n13   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                         13 Michael is still in the hall holding Mary very clumsily in his arms. He is anxious. He realizes she's soaked. This disgusts him. He holds her at arm's length; she squirms. He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom, spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the baby down on it. MARY SCREAMS -- she much prefers Michael's arms to the couch. A panicky Michael picks her up again, grumbling. MICHAEL Okay, okay, don't cry like that... I'll hold you, I'll hold you. He tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around the child. Obviously Michael is very put off by the smell coming from Mary. \n14   INT. SAFEWAY - DAY                                           14 Peter is talking with a Safeway CLERK, a woman in her 50's, who is tall and heavy, somewhat gruff and masculine in appearance, and wearing slacks and a smock. PETER So what's the best brand? \nSTORE CLERK Depends on what your pediatrician recommends. PETER Oh right, the pediatrician... But which one sells the most? STORE CLERK (pointing to a can) This kind. PETER Oh, so this is the best kind? \nSTORE CLERK It's the cheapest. PETER Then it's the worst kind? STORE CLERK They're all good, sir. PETER (pointing to another can) Oh, okay, then I can take this kind. STORE CLERK It's got iron in it. PETER Oh.   Is that good or bad? STORE CLERK It's very good. PETER Well, why don't they all have iron in them? STORE CLERK Some babies are allergic to iron. PETER (pointing to yet another can) Oh, okay, well I'll take this kind then. STORE CLERK That kind doesn't have any milk in it. \nPETER Oh, I see, there's milk with no milk in it? STORE CLERK Some babies are allergic to milk. \nMICHAEL No, it's not me, I mean she's not mine... MANAGER Oh, so it's Peter's? MICHAEL No, no, it's Jack's, I mean it's not Jack's, it's... someone loaned it to us, I mean someone... MANAGER And what's the little girl's name? MICHAEL Mary. MANAGER Ooh, what a pwetty wittle name, Mary! I didn't know you had a baby... MICHAEL Yeah, well, I have to put her to bed now. MANAGER You have to put her to bed?    Where's Mary's mommy? MICHAEL She's... she's not here.   She'll be back soon. Michael starts to close the door.    She pushes it back open and holds out the package. MANAGER Oh here, this just came for you. They just dropped it off. Can I hold her for a second? MICHAEL Well, like, y'see... she doesn't like to be held by strangers... The apartment Manager has already given Michael the package and grabbed Mary. She covers her with kisses. Mary smiles. Michael absent-mindedly looks at the package. \nMANAGER She loves to be held by strangers! Hey, she's soaking wet hmm, no I think it's number 2. Want me to give you a hand changing her? \nMICHAEL Oh no, don't worry, I'm used to it. (faking a smile) Well, so long, Mrs. Razzolini. MANAGER 'Bye, Mary, I'll come back to visit. \nMrs. Razzolini regretfully hands the baby back. No sooner is MARY back in Michael's arms than she SCREAMS her head off. He closes the door; his smile instantly fades. MICHAEL What a leech! And that other idiot isn't back yet! He throws the package onto an armchair in the hall. MICHAEL So you love to be held by strangers, do you? \n18   INT. SAFEWAY - DAY                                         18 In the baby food aisle there are now five women arguing. Peter, his arms still laden with cans, looks uncomfort- able. WOMAN #2 This guy doesn't even know how old his baby is and you don't find that strange? WOMAN #1 This guy asked for advice,   I'm giving him advice, Okay?    If you're so paranoid, why don't you   run home and chain your kid to   his crib? WOMAN #2 Anyway, I think someone should call the cops. WOMAN #1 \nThe cops, the cops -- I bet you call the cops every time your cat pisses on the carpet. Peter slips away. \n19   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                      19 Peter comes in with bags in his arms. Michael, holding the baby, dashes toward him, extremely pissed off. MICHAEL What the hell were you doing? You've been gone for hours! This damn kid's been crying the whole time. I've got a lot better things to do with my time! You're a real pain in the ass! PETER (flabbergasted) Hey, how dare you speak to me like that! You've never spoken to me like that before... MICHAEL Well, what the hell took   you so long? What'd you do, go    out for breakfast or something?    I didn't even have time for a cup   of coffee, for chrissakes. PETER Will you please cut it out for a second, huh? I didn't have any coffee either, it took me forever at the goddamn Safeway. MICHAEL Okay, well, here -- take the kid, I've got work to do. PETER Whaddaya mean, take the kid? I can't hold her and make her bottle at the same time. And why should I be the one to hold her? MICHAEL 'Cause, it's your problem.    You found this kid. PETER Hey, asshole, I'm the one who found \nher because I'm the one who was gonna get you some bagels for your breakfast, and... MICHAEL Jesus, there she goes again!      We gotta feed her something. PETER Yeah, well you just don't feed a baby. First you gotta look and see if she has any teeth or not. MICHAEL Why? \nPETER To figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her, that's why. Peter attempts to look into Mary's mouth but she squirms. MICHAEL Do you look on top or bottom? PETER How do I know? MICHAEL Try feeling with your finger. Peter slides his finger over Mary's gums. PETER I can't feel anything -- I'll give her the stuff for newborns and hope she's not allergic to it. Peter starts off toward the kitchen, Michael follows. PETER And then we'll    have to  see if she's allergic    to iron,  to soy or to milk --    you can't  imagine how much stuff    they can  be allergic to! MICHAEL She's soaking wet -- did you buy any diapers? PETER Diapers? MICHAEL \nMary is wearing only a diaper.   Peter wraps her in one of his sweaters. \n24   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                        24 Michael is throwing a heap of used cotton and dirty diapers into the garbage can. He's rather disgusted by them. \n25   INT. LVING ROOM - DAY                                     25 Peter is cutting apart a plastic bag and lining the bottom of the basket with it as a protective sheet. \n26   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                        26 Michael is washing out a bottle. \n27   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                    27 Peter is rocking the basket by its handles to put Mary to sleep. \n28   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                       28 Michael is washing Mary's clothes. \n29   INT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY                                   29 PETER (on the phone) I need to reach Jack Collins, he's one of your pilots... No, I don't know exactly where he is, but he was supposed to be flying the Miami-Caracas-Rio route... The guy who proposed to you?... Oh, did he?... Well, congratulations. Please... listen to me... you must contact him and tell him he's got to call home immediately. Okay? It's an emergency, a family problem... No, don't worry, he's not married to someone else. It's another kind of family \nproblem... Of course he still loves you. But he's been really busy lately. So anyway, please try to get in touch with him, it's real important... I can count on you then?... Good. Thanks. Goodbye!... Right, see you at the wedding. Peter hangs up. \n30   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                           30 Michael and Peter are finally drinking a cup of coffee at the kitchen table. In silence. \nHe discreetly reveals a switchblade knife he's carrying. PUNK #1 (to Punk #2) Start the bike. Punk #2 is about to get on the motorcycle.   Peter stops him. PETER But I'm telling you, I've got the real package in my pocket. PUNK #2 (to Punk #1) Watch it, the cops! Peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket. A patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car in which Graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the action. GRATON (to his partner) Terrific! I bet these morons screw up everything. One of the COPS gets out of his car and comes over to the Punks and Peter. Peter is scared stiff. PUNK #1 (whispering) If you called the cops on us, pal, you're a dead man. COP #1 All right, what's that doing on the back of the bike? No one answers. COP #1 You wouldn't by any chance be intending to drive with a baby basket on your motorcycle, would you? PUNK #1 Of course not, Officer. We'd never do something like that. \nCOP #1 So why did you strap it on in the first place if you had no intention of driving with it? PUNK #2 So it wouldn't fall off. COP #1 Very funny. As he speaks, Peter undoes the bungie cord from around the basket and takes it off the motorcycle. PETER No, really, Officer, they weren't gonna drive off with it -- They were just watching it for me while I was doing a quick errand. (to the Punks) Thanks, guys. Punk #1 gives him a dirty look. COP #1 All right, let's see some identification, everybody. The punks exchange a glance.   Suddenly Punk #1 shouts: PUNK #1 Go! They take off running in different directions. Cop #1 charges after Punk #1 and yells to his partner who's still in the car: COP #1 Watch the guy with the basket! Cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand. Peter stiffens with fear. COP #2 Freeze! All right, asshole, let's see some I.D. PETER (urbanely) Listen, Officer, let's stay calm now. I haven't the slightest intention of running. I am not a criminal. I'm an architect. COP #2 (calming down \na little) Your I.D., let's see it. PETER I'm terribly sorry, Officer, but I don't have any identification on me. I just came down with my baby to run a quick errand. I haven't committed any crime. COP #2 All right, let's go, in the car. I'm taking you down to the station. PETER Oh, c'mon, that's impossible -- you see I have a baby. I have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes, I can't go anywhere. I live right in this building -- let me go up to my apartment and I'll get you my license immediately... You can even come with me if you like... COP #2 All right, lead the way. They disappear inside the building. Peter is carrying the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched on the horrible package hidden in his pocket. Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed. Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show- ing him his badge. GRATON (angry) Inspector Graton, Narcotics. It just so happens I was tailing those two guys and now because of you clowns I lost them, probably forever. Thanks a lot! COP #1 How could we know? GRATON Forget it. Listen, your partner went in here with the guy and the baby. He lives up on the tenth floor. I can't go in because if he sees me, my cover is blown. So could you please try not to lose this one, okay? He's someone who's \ngotta be watched very closely. I've called for backup and it's on its way. \n60   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                      60 \nThe elevator doors open, Peter and Cop #2 exit. PETER (key in hand) This is it. Please come in... can I get you a cup of coffee or something? COP #2 No thanks.   I'll just wait out here. Peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through the house, carrying the basket. As soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running like a madman down the corridor. He runs into Michael who was just coming to meet him. MICHAEL Hey, what's happening? What were those cops doing... Peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and leads him into his room, closing the door behind them. Peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he can hardly breathe. PETER Michael... Michael... we're in deep trouble. The package... The package... MICHAEL Yeah?   What? PETER There's a cop on the doorstep... He didn't see you... He mustn't see you... We're in deep trouble, Michael... MICHAEL Tell me what... PETER The package  they came for wasn't the baby, it  was dope, drugs, a shitload of  dope! We were stopped by some cops  down on the street. \nMICHAEL But did the cops see the dope? PETER No, it's right here. \nHe takes out the package. MICHAEL Shit! PETER We'll get twenty years if the cops find this on us! Climb down the fire escape and hide it... anywhere! Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to climb out it when Peter stops him. PETER Hey, whatever you do,   don't lose the goddamn dope, we   gotta be able to return it to   those dealers or we're dead. Those    guys are serious. MICHAEL Don't worry. He starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back. MICHAEL Oh, by the way, I put some water up to boil for her bottle. Michael disappears. Peter picks up Mary, grabs his  wal- let and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall,  he discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is whispering something. Peter holds his license out  for them to see. PETER Here's my license. COP #1 I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment. The narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now. They want to ask you a few questions. PETER Narcotics squad? What do they want with me? I don't even use aspirin! \n61   INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY                                     61 Michael is buying a pair of scissors, glue and a roll of Scotch tape. Then he buys a box of large diapers -- he chooses the ones that come in a box. Michael leaves the supermarket, whistling. \nPETER (pointing) Sure.   This is Jack Collins. AGENT #1 Oh yeah?   Now that's interesting. Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket, observed by the five cops. He now sits down, cheerful and bubbling over with enthusiasm. MICHAEL So! Can I get you something to drink? Agent #1 totally ignores him. AGENT #1 So, who's the baby belong to? PETER It's Jack's daughter. AGENT #1 And why are you two taking care of her? PETER Because her mother's in Europe for six months, and since Jack had to be away for two weeks, I took my vacation to take care of her, I love kids. MICHAEL Yeah, Peter and I just love kids! AGENT #1 Now that's interesting. Well, we'll be seeing each other again soon, in fact very soon. In the \nmeantime, I'd appreciate it if you didn't leave New York in the next few days. All the cops head for the door. Michael accompanies them, putting on a very urbane act. \nMICHAEL Come back anytime, gentlemen. You're always welcome here. We have no particular plans to leave New York in the near future, so don't worry about us now. 'Bye now. Once the cops are gone, Michael races back to the living room. Peter has collapsed into his armchair. \nPETER (in a low tone) Christ, what a mess! They'll be on our tails around the clock! How the hell are we gonna get rid of the goddamn dope?! By the way, where is it? MICHAEL (also speaking in a low tone) It's cool, don't worry, I got it stashed. PETER Where? Michael points to Mary's bottom. PETER Huh? MICHAEL This way it's close at hand! PETER Are you out of your mind?? MICHAEL Relax, will you. MICHAEL (CONT'D) I diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing! PETER I told the cops we were taking care of her. You realize we're now stuck with the kid till Jack \ncomes back. There ain't nobody coming to pick her up, and I have to go back to the office today! MICHAEL Wait a minute. You're not gonna stick me with this kid! Tell them you need a maternity leave, tell them anything, but we've got to go 50-50 on this! PETER And that's not all -- we haven't heard from the punks yet either! \n66   EXT. STREET - DAY                                     66 Hidden within a parked car, three men are keeping a close watch on the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's build- ing. The two uniformed cops emerge, get in their car, and pull away. \n67   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                        67 PETER (on the phone; things are heating up) That's right, you heard right: I'm not coming in to work for two weeks... No, I can't explain why... (in a louder tone) ... Because I can't, that's all!... NO, this has nothing to do with chasing ass! Jerry... Jerry! Will you stop screaming for a minute and listen? I'm in trouble, you understand? Deep trouble... I know... I know... PETER (CONT'D) (yells) ... Goddammit, Jerry, of course winning the competition is important to me! The firm's my whole life if you must know. No, no, please -- don't send anyone over here... Don't you come either. No, Jerry... Okay, listen, I'll be there in a half-hour, but I can't stay long. No! Don't come here! I'll be right over. He hangs up.   Michael enters the room, with his coat on. MICHAEL \nI gotta go over to    Mr. Oxman's -- he just called and    he's freaking out. He says if I     don't bring some cartoons over    now, the deal's off. \nPETER You're going now? MICHAEL Yeah, but don't worry about it, I'll be back before it's time for her next bottle. She's asleep now. PETER Terrific, just terrific! Jerry just called: I have to go to the office right now. MICHAEL Well, call him back. Tell him you'll come later. PETER There's no way. I can't, he's suicidal. Why don't you call Oxman and tell him you'll be there in a few hours. MICHAEL You're crazy. Oxman is leaving in an hour. If I don't meet him before then, I blow my 15,000 dollar contract. PETER Oh shit, I can't take this anymore! MICHAEL Look, maybe we could pawn her off on Mrs. Razzolini, just for a couple of hours -- she's crazy about her! PETER Good idea!    Let's go. \n72   INT. PETER'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   72 Peter is in bed, completely out of it. Michael is changing Mary very carefully. He puts one diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. He lays Mary down in her basket, then places the basket on the bed, nestled between the wall and Peter's body. Michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out. Once he's alone, Peter leans over the basket. Mary and he stare at each other intently and seriously. Peter switches off the light. \n73   INT. APARTMENT - DAWN                                       73 The DOORBELL RINGS. Michael, asleep on his mattress on the    floor in the middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges    from sleep and glances at his clock: it's 6:10 AM.      He staggers to the front door and opens it. The door is     being held together with a string. Agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other cops backing them up. Mrs. Razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide- eyed, a look of horror on her face. MICHAEL Morning, officers. Can I help you? AGENT #1 (holding out a piece of paper to him) Search warrant. MICHAEL \n(playing  the gentleman, waving  away the paper) I believe you,  officer. Go ahead, we have nothing  to hide. Hello, Mrs. Razzolini! \nMrs. Razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away. The cops enter the apartment. MICHAEL You'll have to excuse the mess... We had a few friends over last night... AGENT #1 (looking at the devastation) Oh, really? Well, if I were you I'd get myself some new friends! Peter comes in, in his bathrobe, furious. PETER What the hell are you guys looking for, anyway? AGENT #1 Probably the same things your friends were looking for last night! Didn't Mrs. Razzolini bring you a package last Sunday? PETER You mean the chocolate Easter bunnies? We ate them already. He starts to walk away. PETER Anyway, you have no idea how many packages we've been getting lately. It's hard to keep track of them. AGENT #1 Maybe we can help. (to his colleagues) Let's get to work! All the cops enter the apartment. \n74   INT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY                             74 Peter is in bed, with the basket beside him. A narcotics AGENT is rummaging through his scattered belongings. AGENT Would you mind if I look in your \nbed? PETER (big smile) My pleasure. Try not to make a mess. \nPeter gets up, takes the basket off the bed and keeps it in his hands. The Agent searches the bed. AGENT I'll look in the basket, if you don't mind... PETER Be my guest. \nHe picks up Mary with her huge diaper.   The Agent searches the whole basket. AGENT Thank you very much, sorry about this... He goes out.   Peter, undaunted, pats Mary's big behind. \n75   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                       75 The cops are leaving. AGENT #1 Well, there's obviously been a mistake. As far as you're concerned this investigation is closed. We apologize again. MICHAEL (big smile) Oh, don't mention it! It was a pleasure having you here! I hope you'll find what you're looking for very soon! AGENT #1 (looking straight at him) So do we. Michael closes the door and races into the living room where he discovers Peter putting on his jacket. MICHAEL (softly) Did you hear that? He said there'd been a mistake and they weren't going to bother us anymore. \nMichael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti- tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside him. He puts the clean diaper on her. Graton, nervous and wary,   watches Michael and the passersby. Just then, two    punks (Peter and Jack) come running up to Michael. He    ostensibly takes the brown package out of his plastic   bag and gives it to them. The two punks immediately take off with the package. Graton leaps up, shouts \"let's get 'em\" and takes off after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes detectives, who'd been hiding all around. Michael quickly gets up,    picks Mary up and discreetly deposits the dope-filled    diaper in a trash can, giving the punk on the bench an    intent look. Then he goes off in the direction of the    cops. The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and goes off in the opposite direction. The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put up no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them. MICHAEL What's going on? GRATON Inspector Graton, Narcotics. Do you admit you gave these men this package? MICHAEL Sure. I gave it to them, just a moment ago. GRATON (to one of the cops) Officer, will you please open this package in front of these witnesses? The cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate Easter bunnies. Graton is mortified. He crushes all the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate inside them. MICHAEL Is it against the law to give a box of candy to my friends? Peter and Jack take off their glasses. GRATON Oh, it's you guys! \nPETER What's the problem? GRATON You guys must think you're pretty smart, don't ya? (suddenly freezes) Holy shit! The diaper! Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain. He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the garbage around like a lunatic. \nGRATON The goddam diaper! What a jerk, what a goddam schmuck I am! Peter, Michael, Jack and the 10 plainclothes detectives watch Graton going bananas. MICHAEL (to the cops) I think that guy needs a vacation. JACK He should try South America. PETER Yeah, I hear it's nice there this time of year. \n89   INT. GRATON'S BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY                         89 The Chief is standing behind his desk, red-faced with anger, and Graton sheepishly faces him. CHIEF Let's face it... Graton... You've got shit for brains. GRATON I'm sure the dope was in the diaper. Can I go on tailing them? CHIEF Forget it. I have solid information your three suspects never had anything to do with the dealers or the dope. GRATON I'm sure the dope was in the diaper. CHIEF \nCase closed. GRATON I'm sure the dope was in the diaper. CHIEF (screaming) Did you hear me, Graton?   Case closed. GRATON I'm sure the d... CUT TO: 90   INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - EVENING                        90 In the devastated living room Peter, still disguised as a punk, and Michael, both very high, are dancing around in circles with each other and laughing. They are singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har- monizing. Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael, holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to him and starts turning around in circles with him. MARY, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is LAUGHING her head off. In the b.g., in the hall, Jack, also still in his punk getup, is on the phone. He's got a glass in his hand and is a little smashed. JACK Paul, hi, it's Jack! Hey, listen, I brought you back a little present from South America. Can I see you right away so I can give it to you? ... Yeah, the sooner the better! I can't wait to let you have it. How about 67th and East River? 91   EXT. EAST RIVER - EVENING                                   91 A broadly smiling Jack arrives at the riverside. Paul is sitting on a bench. When he sees Jack, he gets up and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand. Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and  sends him with a forceful shove flying into the water.   Paul lands on his back with a big splash, and comes back  up to the surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over   the water and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit  drunk. JACK That was for your 'little' package, and consider yourself lucky I didn't turn you in to the cops! And get one thing into your thick skull: I have never touched dope, \nand I never will. You and your shit-dealing, you can go straight to hell, and you can take the money you make from it and stick it up your ass! So long. \nJack turns his back on Paul and staggers off. PAUL Hey, come back! -- how'm I gonna get out of here? JACK Crawl. \n92   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                     92 In the living room, Michael is sitting in front of the TV. He's not really watching -- he's eavesdropping on Jack's phone conversation. JACK (very aggravated) Listen, Sylvia, you've got to come back. I travel, I can't take care of her... Yeah, but you're her mother... I'm her father -- what makes you so sure I'm the father!? The dates coincide! Big deal! That doesn't prove a thing... But she's still your kid, so do me a favor, get your ass back here immediately and take her off our hands... 'Cause we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, okay? Sylvia?... Hello! Hello! Sylvia, goddam it! JACK (CONT'D) (he slams the receiver down like he was hammering a nail) Shit! That bitch hung up on me! Women! I could kill them! MICHAEL Why don't you call her back? JACK I don't have the number. I got a message to her through her agency, they won't tell me where she is. I don't even know where she was calling from. And you better believe she's not going \nto call back! The PHONE RINGS.   Michael answers it. MICHAEL Hello?... No, it's Michael... How are you?... Oh, she's doing just fine, she's in great shape. We're taking very good care of her, you have nothing to worry about. 'Bye. He hangs up. JACK Who was that? \n96   EXT. HOUSE (MIAMI) - DAY                              96 A cab slowly pulls up in front of Jack's mother's house. There is a big red convertible filled with four jovial senior citizens. Jack comes out of the cab with the basket and stares at his mother, MARGIE, who's just locking her door. Next to her, holding her luggage is Steve (a man in his sixties). They head toward the trunk of the car. JACK Hey, Mom! MARGIE (hits Steve) Hey, he finally made it! MARGIE (CONT'D) (to Jack) Do you have any idea what time it is? It's four. You said two. JACK But, Mom, I missed the plane. MARGIE Yeah, but now I have to go. JACK Where are you going? MARGIE On a cruise around the world. JACK But why didn't you say so on the phone? MARGIE Because you never would've come. Now let me see her. (she grabs Mary and covers her with kisses) Oh, my little strudle! STEVE \nHey, Margie.   We're a little late... MARGIE Bye-bye, sweetie love... I'll bring you back presents from all over the world. (to Jack, giving back Mary) Four o'clock. She runs into the car and they pull away.     Everyone waving goodbye. JACK (holding Mary) 'Bye! \n97   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   97 Jack comes in with the basket; he's in a vile mood. He's got a bottle ready in his hand. Peter, who had been working in his room, rushes to the hall. PETER You're bringing her back? JACK Yeah... she's starving. I gotta heat this bottle up right away. They go into the kitchen together. Peter immediately gets busy; he heats the bottle up quickly while Jack soothes the hungry Mary by carrying her in his arms. PETER So what happened? Did you two have a fight? JACK (grim) Goddamn cruises... PETER Didn't she want to take her? JACK Sure she did, but she was just leaving for some stupid cruise around the world. The entire fucking world! With some bimbo boyfriend of her's... and a bunch of retired bozos. PETER \nThe apple doesn't fall far from the tree. JACK What? \n98   INT. APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON                            98 The DOORBELL RINGS. Jack goes to the door. At the door stands a rather distinguished-looking woman, with her hair tied back very properly, a suitcase in her hand. It is MRS. BRETSAWS, who speaks with a British accent. MRS. BRETSAWS Good afternoon. I'm Mathilda Bretsaws, from The Second Mommy agency. JACK (very eager, very gracious) Oh, yes, I was expecting you. Won't you come in... They disappear into the living room. Jack shuts the door behind him. Michael peeks into the hall, then goes and looks into the living room through the crack in the door. Peter, too, peeks in. PETER Who is it? MICHAEL Must be some nanny he found through an agency. Peter shrugs and walks away. Jack comes out of the living room. JACK (softly, to Michael) She wants to see Mary. MICHAEL She's asleep. JACK Well, she wants to see her anyway! He heads toward Peter's room. \nPETER (returning from the kitchen) What do you want? JACK Nothing, nothing. PETER Don't go into my room, she's asleep. JACK Yeah, but the nanny, Mrs. Bretsaws, she wants to see her. \nPETER No, damn it, no! You're gonna wake her up! It already took me an hour to sing her to sleep... JACK Yeah, but she wants to see her. PETER All right, I'll go explain the situation. JACK (holding him back with both hands) No, no, Peter, please, really, don't go, don't bother, I'll go explain it to her myself... PETER It's no bother, Jack.    I'll be glad to do it. He rushes toward the living room. JACK (sighing, to Michael) Wanna bet she's out of here in ten minutes slamming the door behind her? They tiptoe over to the living room door and eavesdrop. \n99   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                         99 PETER ... A sleeping child should not be awakened. If you don't know that, then you're not fit to be a nanny. \nMRS. BRETSAWS (tense, but still calm) I never said that I wanted the child to be awakened, sir. I only asked to see her. If I'm going to be taking care of the child on a round-the-clock basis, then... PETER 'Round-the-clock'? Whaddya mean 'round the clock'? Are you intending to sleep here? MRS. BRETSAWS Absolutely, sir. A second mommy is a second mommy. PETER And where are you going to sleep? MRS. BRETSAWS Well, I expect you to show me to my quarters. PETER Well, I don't know where Jack intends to stick you... That's his problem... Maybe in his room... But I'm warning you, Mrs. Brestshow. MRS. BRETSAWS Bretsaws. PETER There are three of us sharing this place and we're all real studs. \nWhose shift is that? MICHAEL Well... I thought you might do it... \nPETER Not a    chance! I'm not doing the night    shift. I absolutely refuse. I have    too much work to catch up on for    the competition. JACK Well, needless to say I refuse, too! \nMICHAEL Listen to me, you selfish bastards! My shift is eight hours in a row. No way I'm gonna do nights too. After 6 P.M. she can scream all she wants, I don't give a shit. PETER You know, Jack, you're a real slime ball! We give you the easiest shift: the morning. She's always in great shape in the morning, isn't she? We've got to work like crazy to save our jobs and you have the nerve to refuse nights. Goddamit, she's your daughter. Are you that horny? JACK (extremely pissed off) Hey, horny yourself! I don't give a shit. I don't need you guys. I'll find some other way to do it. And I won't take the New York-Washington shuttle! He exits, furious. \n104   INT. CHARTER COMPANY - DAY                            104 Jack is coming out of   an office that says \"EXECUTIVE OFFICES.\" He is grim    and sullen-looking. He runs into his friend Paul, who   jumps three feet away to avoid a potential mishap with   Jack. PAUL (shyly) Hi, Jack, something wrong? \nJACK (who hadn't noticed him) Oh, hi... Nah, nothing's wrong. PAUL What were you doing in the boss's office? JACK I was asking to do the New York- Washington shuttle for a few months. PAUL Oh, and he said 'no,' huh? \nJACK (barking) As a matter of fact, he said 'yes.' Paul backs up against the wall, protecting his face with his arms. Jack leaves, disgusted. Paul watches him go, totally confused. \n105   INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 105 Jack is sitting on his bed, wearing a dressing gown. He's got a sleeping Mary in his arms. The basket is on the floor beside the bed. Jack attempts to put Mary back in her basket but she shudders and he immediately sits back down again and doesn't move. Mary falls back asleep. Jack looks at her skin, her hands. Very gently, he kisses her forehead. Mary smiles in her sleep. \n106   INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - MORNING                                  106 Michael is working at his drafting table.      Jack rushes in, wearing his uniform, ready to go out. JACK Okay, I'm off. She's well fed and she's sleeping now. We hear MARY CRYING. JACK Shit, she's crying.      I'll go pick her up... Peter passes him in the corridor.      He, too, is ready to go out to his office. PETER \nLet her cry, she's just trying to get to sleep, she'll stop in a couple of minutes. JACK No, she needs to burp -- I've gotta rock her for a little... PETER I'm telling you, the more you pick her up, the longer it'll take her to get to sleep. JACK Thanks for the advice -- now why don't you just shove it? I know you let her scream for hours but I can't. PETER (in a state of shock) I never let her scream for hours! JACK You'd resort to any theory to not take care of her. Just because you've read some books... PETER Can you believe what he just said to me... I read those books bec... JACK It's not your shift, anyway. Piss off, will ya? MICHAEL Come on, guys, cool it! It's my shift now. (to Jack) I'll rock her for a few minutes... (to Peter) ... and then I'll put her right to bed. So off to work, both of you. He pushes them both out. \n111   INT. JACK'S ROOM - NIGHT                                111 The Brunette is listening to the male chorus, totally amazed. BRUNETTE This guy's totally whacko. She gets up, slips on a T-shirt, and exits the bedroom. \nShe stops at the door to the living room and contemplates the three men who are singing earnestly around the crib. BRUNETTE (in a loud voice) Hey, choir boys, you gonna keep it up all night? Peter and Michael stare at her, scandalized. Jack gestures wildly to her to shut up and go away. BRUNETTE Oh my God! There's a baby in there! I'm sorry... She goes back to Jack's room. \nPETER (hissing) Who the hell's that broad? JACK Watch your mouth, will you? I'm in love with that young lady. PETER Can't she speak softly like everyone else? JACK (getting angry) Listen, at night I'm in charge. So get off my back, will you? MICHAEL (exasperated) Will you quit fighting all the time? She just fell asleep, for Chrissake. JACK Oh, Michael, go to hell! I'm sick and tired of your little 'Father Knows Best' number! PETER Yeah, you're right, I'm fed up with it, too! MICHAEL (terribly upset) Okay, that's it. Into the kitchen. He exits, furious. Peter and Jack follow after him. Fuming, they file one after the other down the corridor past the stunned Brunette in her T-shirt who was waiting \nfor Jack by the door to his room. The three guys close the kitchen door and start yelling at each other. They all talk at once. MICHAEL I've had it with you assholes! I won't be the buffer between you two anymore... JACK I didn't ask you to get up, I know what I have to do. PETER I don't mind getting up, that's not the point... \nMICHAEL I'm not a punching bag!   You assholes! JACK If I can't bring a girl back here anymore, just say so. And I'm gone. I'm outta here. With Mary. PETER You can bring whoever you want as long as they speak softly like everyone else! MICHAEL One thing I know: I can't goddamn wait till Sylvia gets back! PETER Yeah, you can say that again! JACK And again, and again, and again... Meanwhile, the Brunette has put her clothes back on and gathered up her belongings. Now she enters the kitchen. BRUNETTE Sorry to disturb you guys, but I'm splitting. I didn't come here to be a bedwarmer. 'Bye. JACK (running after her) No! Wait, please don't go... it's all over now, I'm coming back to bed... BRUNETTE (at the front door) \nYou're very nice, but I don't feel like it anymore now. Some other time, okay? 'Bye. She kisses him goodbye and leaves. \nJack is very depressed. \n112   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                    112 Peter, Michael and Jack have guests over for dinner. CLASSICAL MUSIC, a very fancy table, candles: they're at the tail-end of the dinner, before dessert. Everyone is very fashionably dressed. \nNatalie is sitting between Peter and Carl. Jay and Jerry, Peter's partners, are also there with their wives. Michael and Sophia are having a vehement discussion as usual, Jack is between two gorgeous models: CHRISTIE and CAROLINE. CARL Have you seen the latest bi-annual at the Whitney? Incredible! Have you seen it, Peter? PETER No, I haven't had the time lately. CARL Ah... working hard on the competition, are you? You may as well throw in the T-square, old friend, you haven't got a chance. JERRY (somewhat harshly) I only wish he was working hard on the competition, but unfortunately, that's not the case... NATALIE Really? What's he doing then? He's always so busy. CARL Maybe he's working hard on women! Some people have to work really hard to get anything! Natalie bursts out laughing. Peter's about to respond, but stops himself suddenly. In the b.g., a BABY can be \nJERRY What if you just put her back to bed? NATALIE Right -- she's just throwing a temper tantrum, put her to bed... PETER We already tried... \nJACK It's her teeth... NATALIE (to Jerry) Do you have any kids? JERRY'S WIFE Yeah, but they're grown up now, thank God! CHRISTIE (to Jay) And do you have kids, too? JAY What? CHRISTIE I said... and do you have kids, too? JAY No, we both have careers. The guests remain silent, MARY CONTINUES to CRY. CARL So, do you think we'll get to taste that three-tiered cake tonight? PETER What? CARL (to Natalie, sarcastically) Oh, nothing, nothing -- I was just trying to liven up the \nconversation... PETER What? CHRISTIE Gosh, my ears are ringing, I can't hear anybody. CAROLINE I must say, a crying kid is kind of hard to take... PETER What? \nCARL (loudly) We were just saying that this baby's conversation is actually rather limited... and a touch annoying. Don't you think? PETER Well, she's not the only one with a limited conversation. At least she has an excuse, she's a baby! What's yours? CARL I frankly don't know what you mean. PETER I mean, I've been listening to your pompous drivel about the latest trends for the last two hours, and frankly, it's a crock of horseshit. JERRY Come on, Peter, be nice... JAY Listen, go put the baby to bed and you guys cool it, will you? CARL It's okay. I'm used to it. Peter's always been a sore loser. PETER (totally out of control) You motherfucker, get out of here! Get out of my house right now or I'll kick the shit out \nof you! You snobbish scum- sucking snake! JERRY Peter, cut it out! \nJACK Stop it, Peter. Give her to me, I'll put her to bed... PETER (beside himself) No, I'll go. (to all the guests) And you can all go fuck yourselves! Go back to your asinine conversations! He exits with Mary.    Jack, embarrassed, follows him. MICHAEL (trying to recover) Well... umm... How 'bout if I get the cake now, okay? He exits. CARL Well. It seems our beloved hosts are going to be busy playing mother for a while, so if you'll excuse me, I'll just slip away... (to Natalie) ... Natalie, may I invite you to spend the rest of the evening in a more hospitable place? NATALIE Gladly. (to the guests) Goodbye. They exit. JAY (to Jerry and his wife) Is he out of his mind or what? JERRY He was absolutely obnoxious. CHRISTIE (drunk, getting up and tottering) Hey, Caroline, I think we should \ngo, too. I don't feel so good... I think I'm gonna barf... CAROLINE (running to help her) Oh, God, no! Hold it back! CHRISTIE (starting to cry) I wanna go home... CAROLINE Okay, we're going... (to the others) Sorry... say goodbye to Jack for us... They exit.   Christie is hanging on to Caroline. JAY (to Jerry) Look, there's no point in our staying any longer. I think it's best we leave. JAY'S WIFE (to Jerry) Tell Peter if was a wonderful party. JERRY (sad) Okay... 'Bye... SOPHIA Can you drop me off near Soho by any chance? JAY Sure. SOPHIA Thanks! (to Jerry and his Wife) 'Bye... Say goodbye to them for me... Sophia, Jay and his Wife exit. JERRY'S WIFE Well, we might as well go, too. I think the evening's over. She gets up, so does Jerry. \nMichael, very playful, comes back in carrying an enormous three-tiered cake. MICHAEL Ta-da! Will you look at this? Is this a cake or what? Can someone make a little room on the table so I can... Are you guys leaving? JERRY Yeah, we're beat. MICHAEL Hey, where is everybody? \nJERRY'S WIFE Well, the atmosphere wasn't exactly festive... JERRY Sorry about the cake, Mike... It looks great! MICHAEL Oh, never mind, don't worry... Good night... Jerry and his Wife exit. Michael is left standing there with his cake. Jack comes in, full of beans. JACK Well, she's asleep at last! We sang in har... Hey, where is everybody? MICHAEL Gone. Can you make a little room for me on the table to put the... JACK You mean they're all gone? MICHAEL Yeah, all of 'em, hey, can you make a little room for me to... JACK (going back out, furious) Peter! Peter, goddamit, get out here! Peter comes back in with Jack. JACK They're all gone! \n117   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                        117 Peter's giving Mary her bottle, Jack is carefully putting all her stuff into a bag -- bottles, nipples, cereals, etc. In the doorway Sylvia, with reddened eyes, silently watches them. JACK (to himself) Let's see, the five bottles, the little bottles for water, the strainer for her cereal... (to Sylvia) ... Do you have a blender? SYLVIA A blender? JACK For bananas and carrots and stuff. It's time for her to start eating them... SYLVIA No, I don't have a blender. JACK \nOkay, you can have ours. He stuffs the blender into the bag. Mary has now finished her bottle. \nSYLVIA (to Peter) Do you want me to take her? PETER No, I have to burp her first. With dexterity, he places Mary face down on his shoulder and walks around in the kitchen, patting her on the back. \nJACK (to Sylvia) Here, could you give these to Michael so he can pack them with the clothes? He hands two bibs to Sylvia. Sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front of Michael's room, where she looks strangely at the changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and the baby's toilet articles. Sylvia enters the living room. Michael has spread all of Mary's clothes, neatly folded and ironed on the couch. He is packing them in a big bag. SYLVIA Here are the bibs. Jack told me to give them... MICHAEL (taking the bibs) Thanks... I put the woolen things on the bottom and the diapers and lighter things on top, because you'll need those first... SYLVIA (her mind is elsewhere) Yeah, sure... Michael bustles about. Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the living room. Music boxes, little booties and stuffed animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white tulle frames the crib. \nMICHAEL You'll have to come back and get the crib later. SYLVIA Yeah... \n118   EXT. STREET - DAY                                         118 A taxi is there. Behind the    wheel the driver sits waiting. Sylvia is sitting    in the back, on the side nearest the sidewalk, and on   her lap is Mary, whom she's gently fondling. On the sidewalk, beside the   open trunk of the cab, are all Mary's belongings:    some bags, the playpen, a stroller, the baby bathtub,   the changing table, etc. Peter is attempting to pack it all in the trunk.    Michael is handing the things to him. PETER (tense) Give me the playpen first... MICHAEL (equally tense) Then where are you gonna put the tub? PETER (annoyed) Just give me the playpen. CAB DRIVER Need some help? PETER No, no thanks... I'd rather do it myself... Jack is standing beside the back door of the cab, leaning over toward Sylvia, who is holding Mary. He is trying unsuccessfully to sound angry. JACK You really screwed us over but good -- you know that... SYLVIA I know, I'm sorry. JACK Really. Our lives have been out of control for the past six months. \nSYLVIA Yeah, I bet... Actually, that was kind of the point... But I'm the one who really got screwed... She starts to cry again. \nJACK Don't cry, c'mon... you're taking her back now, it's great... SYLVIA (wiping her eyes) Yeah, it's great... JACK D'you have enough money?     Can you manage all right? SYLVIA Yeah, sure... I'm not loaded, but it's okay -- I'm working, I've got modeling jobs lined up... JACK Do you have a boyfriend? SYLVIA No. That's the last thing I need. I've got my work. And now I've got her. She rubs noses with Mary. Peter and Michael approach. PETER That's it, we fit it all in... JACK Okay, then... well, 'bye... The three men are lined up on the sidewalk. Mary stares at them, looking a little lost. They wave their hands and: PETER, MICHAEL AND JACK 'Bye, Mary! MARY LAUGHS and waves. SYLVIA (with a big, sad smile) Okay, well, thanks again -- 'Bye! PETER, MICHAEL AND JACK \n'Bye! The CAR STARTS up, pulls away, and disappears FROM VIEW. JACK (playfully) Well, that's that! MICHAEL Yeah... PETER Right... That's that. They head back to their apartment building. \n125   INT. APARTMENT - EVENING                               125 Peter enters the apartment with Natalie. A bunch of crepe paper streamers are hanging in the hall, as well as posters with various things written on them: PETER'S #1! CONGRATULATIONS, PETER! HURRAY, HURRAY, HURRAY! Jack comes running in with a bottle of champagne, he POPS the CORK. Jack hugs Peter tightly as Michael comes in with glasses and tries to catch the champagne that's flowing all over. They all shout and go bananas celebrating. \n126   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 126 Peter has his arm around Natalie's waist. She's a little drunk. He kisses her and leads her into his room, clos- ing the door behind him. Michael and Jack, who were spying on them, tiptoe over to the door. They are silently exulting over Peter's second victory. \n127   INT. LOBBY OF OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                    127 \nMichael enters a fancy building on 5th Avenue.   He's carrying a big portfolio and is full of beans. In the lobby, he pushes the button for the elevator and looks around absentmindedly. \nHis gaze suddenly freezes on something. By the guard's desk he notices a stroller. Inside, look- ing pretty bored, is MARY. Michael is overwhelmed. He walks toward Mary and through the sea of people -- they exchange an intense look. He looks around and suddenly sees Sylvia and two men deep in discussion coming out of an elevator. Michael, startled, runs and hides behind one of the elevators, staring out wide-eyed. Sylvia is dressed in a very chic, tight black suit, with a veiled little black hat and spiked heels. One of the men is carrying a bunch of cameras. They walk out toward the front door, and Sylvia suddenly stops. She seems to have forgotten something. She kisses them goodbye and heads toward the elevator. Once she's out of their sight, she turns and waits for them to leave. When they're gone for sure, she rushes toward Mary and showers her with kisses. SYLVIA Here you are, my angel... Are you okay, honey? Mommy's finished now, you've been a very, very good girl. (to Guard) Thanks a lot for looking after her. GUARD Oh, she's been great! She wheels the stroller over to the door and quickly takes off her high heels, and her hat, and stuffs them into a big bag. She takes out a pair of old shoes and a comfortable jacket, and slips them on. She removes the pins from her hair -- she looks like her normal self again. She leaves, pushing the stroller out the door. Michael stands frozen. \n128   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT                                      128 Jack, in the corridor of a large modern hotel somewhere \nin the world. He is full of energy and playful excite- ment. He's with a few of his colleagues, both men and women. They say good night to each other. Everyone goes into his or her own room. \nJack's the last one, he goes into his room alone. His smile drops. For a moment he stands there just looking. He sits down on the bed: on the pillow is a little chocolate Santa Claus with a card that reads \"Merry Christmas. The Marriott Hotels.\" Jack contemplates it forlornly. \n129   INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - NIGHT                             129 \n134   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                  134 Jack and Michael, slumped in their chairs, are having breakfast. It's a gray day. It's POURING out. Peter, bending over a bowl of steaming water, with a towel over his head, is inhaling the steam. When he looks up to speak, we see his swollen tear-streaked \nface. JACK (extremely, in fact, too playful) Tomorrow, San Francisco! \nMICHAEL (grim) Say hello to the Pacific for me. JACK (even more playful) I'll be back the day after tomorrow. PETER (emerging from the bowl, congested) You'll be id a foul bood -- jet lag really wipes out you dow. JACK (annoyed) Whaddya mean, now? PETER Yeah: you didd't used to give a shit before, but dow it docks you out. JACK (very hostile) Before what? PETER (putting his head back over the bowl) How would I dow? 'Before,' that's all. JACK (on edge) It doesn't knock me out at all... MICHAEL Is there any jam left? PETER Do. Silence. PETER You eatig here todight? JACK \n(playful again) No, I'm going to the movies tonight with, uh... damn, I can't remember her name... MICHAEL Y'mean the Japanese one? JACK (suddenly very weary) No, she's from Finland. Oh damn it. What the hell's her name? They've got such weird names... Magdalena... no, Marianna... no ... oh, I can't remember -- anyway it's Ma-something or other... MICHAEL Mary? A sudden, weighty silence ensues. PETER This fuckig cold! I look like I'b cryig all the tibe but I'b dot -- it's just this dab cold. He gets up and goes out. \n135   INT. SYLVIA'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT                  135 Jack, holding a bouquet of flowers and Graton's rabbit, rings the doorbell of an apartment. On the door a card reads \"SYLVIA AND MARY.\" A chubby YOUNG MAN with thick glasses opens the door. JACK Hi.   Is Sylvia in? YOUNG MAN No, she'll be back in a couple of hours -- around midnight, she said... JACK (disappointed) Oh. YOUNG MAN Wanna come in and wait for her? JACK Sure... Why not? \nHe follows the Young Man in Sylvia's studio. It's very messy. On the table there's a big heap of books and papers. Mary, sitting on the floor, is wearing a diaper and a sweater, but her legs are bare. She's playing with an empty pack of cigarettes. She looks at Jack with a serious, unruffled expression. \nJACK Sylvia doing okay? YOUNG MAN I don't know -- I'm a med student. I'm just babysitting. I only met her a couple hours ago. JACK Oh, I see... Silence. The Young Man sits down at the table and immerses himself in his books. Mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore. JACK Listen, on second thought, I don't think I'll wait for her. Just give her this when she gets back, okay? And this is for the baby. Jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the Young Man, who plops them down on a chair. YOUNG MAN Sure, no problem. He immerses himself again in his books. Jack heads toward the door, then turns around. JACK Shouldn't the baby be in bed by now? YOUNG MAN Yeah... I don't know... When I put her to bed she cries so I just let her stay up... JACK Don't you have any tights to put on her legs? YOUNG MAN Tights?... Well, it's pretty hot in here anyway... \nJack gets out of there in a hurry. \n136   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                              136 Jack, in his pilot's uniform, is sitting on the living room couch. Michael is standing before him. MICHAEL You want me to call them?

MICHAEL You rotten bastard -- do you see me going out on any dates? PETER Look, it's with Natalie -- I've been after her for months already. MICHAEL So what! If you leave me alone with this kid, I swear I'll pack up and be outta here by morning. PETER You're a real drag, y'know? Tonight was gonna be my big night! Now I bet it's gonna be Carl's big night. \nHe exits, violently slamming the door behind him. Michael sits back down, grumbling. \n44   INT. PETER'S ROOM - DUSK                                    44 \nPeter is making a phone call.   He has Mary in his arms. He's in a foul mood. PETER Hello, Natalie? It's Peter. Listen, I'm really screwed. Jerry just called and we've run into a snag with the blueprints for the competition, it's an emergency. I've gotta go over to the office right away, I think it's gonna be an all-nighter... Of course I didn't know about this yesterday -- he just called me. Mary reaches out and begins to jab the buttons on the phone. Peter pulls her back. PETER Hello? Hello?... No, I'm not trying to hang up on you. We're having some problems with the phone, that's all... No, Natalie, there's no one else here! You're the only woman I... I swear I'm not lying to you... What? You're going to call Carl? (furious) Okay, go ahead, call him if you want. I don't give a shit... Of course I'm not jealous. What makes you think I'm jealous? \n45   INT. KITCHEN - EVENING                                      45 Peter and Michael are silently eating sandwiches at a corner of the kitchen table. Peter is fuming.

A makeshift changing table, rubber wash basin, baby clothes, baby lotion, talcum powder, soap and baby shampoo, etc. are all over the place. He drops all his purchases on the floor, sits down on the couch and picks up a book, in which he's instantly absorbed: we see from the cover that it's a book on children. \n50   INT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY                                     50 Peter is lying on his bed now surrounded by dozens of baby-care books. Many of which are open.

In fact, it won't be until the day after tomorrow at the soonest. Michael sees Mary kick over a bottle of india ink over his drawings. He winces. \nMICHAEL (into phone) On second thought, Mr. Oxman... uh, better make that the end of next week. (shouting on the other end) Please don't get upset, Mr. Oxman. I'll do everything possible to get them to you sooner... You have my word... I apologize again, Mr. Oxman... Thank you again, Mr. Oxman. Goodb... (an audible click) ... Mr. Oxman?

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  53 Peter and Michael are asleep in their bathrobes on the living room couches. Peter has a child care book over his face. MARY, in her basket, wakes up and utters a FEW LITTLE NOISES. The two men jump up and go over to her basket like robots. Mary looks at them and smiles. \n54   INT.

They stop a few yards from the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's building. \nThey are being followed by the beige Chevy that pulls ahead of them and parks just beyond them. In this car we recognize Graton sitting with a partner. The two men, who look like young tough guys (punks), get off their motorcycle and disappear into the lobby of the building. Graton gets out of his car    and heads for the building. He glances into the lobby,    then goes in. He watches the elevator floor indicator,    notes the floor it stops on, then calmly returns to his    car. \n57   INT.

Peter follows him. On the    doorstep stand the TWO PUNKS. One of them is short    and speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent. The other,    tall, thin and creepy-looking, stands behind his buddy    and doesn't speak. PUNK #1 Jack Collins live here? MICHAEL Yes, he does. PUNK #1 We came for the package. PETER Package? Oh that's cute, referring to her as a package! Anyway, you can tell Sylvia she's a lousy stinking bitch. PUNK #1 Sylvia? PETER Yeah, Sylvia! You can tell her she's got a hell of a nerve dumping her problems into our laps! PUNK #1 (nervously) Problems? Did you guys have trouble? MICHAEL (sarcastically) \nHe wants to know if we had trouble! PETER Do you have any idea what it's been like around here for the past four days? \nMICHAEL She could have at least given us a phone number or the name of someone to contact... PUNK #1 (surprised) I don't get it. Didn't they tell you we were gonna be here today? \nMICHAEL Sure they told us! So what? That doesn't make the last four days any less hellish than they were! PETER Well, anyway, they're here now, that's all that matters! Peter turns and walks toward the basket. PETER The next bottle's in 45 minutes. I made it already. It's in the basket. PUNK #1 Bottle?   Whadda ya mean, bottle? MICHAEL About an hour after her bottle, she starts yawning. Put her to bed right away or it's pure hell for the next three hours, at least that's what we've noticed. Peter has returned with the basket. The Punks look at the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief. PUNK #1 What the hell is that?   A baby? PETER (sarcastic) No, it's a very short teenager. Of course it's a baby! Now listen carefully: I'm giving you a can of the milk she's been getting. She loves it, and more importantly, \n", "test2_true": "PUNK #1 Oh! I get it!      Powdered milk!

You take it where they told you to take it. PUNK #1 Y'mean, I take it to the connection? MICHAEL Yeah, whatever you want to call it. PUNK #1 Are you sure that's the plan? \nMICHAEL You bet that's the plan! We're not keeping her one more second. PUNK #1 Okay, if that's the plan... He passes the basket to Punk #2 PUNK #1 ... Here, hold this. Okay, so long! They start to leave, pressing the elevator button. \nPETER (suddenly a little worried) Uh... listen... maybe you could leave us the address or the phone number just in case. So we can find out how she's doing? The Punks exchange a puzzled glance. PUNK #1 Oh, yeah, sure, the address. (feebly searching his pockets) Oh shit, I don't have it on me... But I'll call you. Okay, so long! PETER & MICHAEL So long! The elevator has arrived.    The Punks quickly slip inside it with the basket. Michael closes the door. Peter plops down in the armchair by the front door. PETER Aah, relief at last!    Good riddance! MICHAEL You said it! Now maybe I can get some work done. He disappears in the direction of his room. Peter is sitting    on something hard. He pulls it out from under him, it's    a package. He looks at it, casually reading: \"Care     of Jack Collins.\" He tosses it to the side. Suddenly,     it dawns on him. He leaps up, grabs the package and    runs into Michael's room. \n58   INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - DAY                               58 PETER (holding the package) What the hell is this?

PETER When the hell did this package arrive? MICHAEL Will you quit shouting! PETER (screaming even louder) When did this fucking package fucking arrive, Michael? MICHAEL I don't know... Oh yeah, Sunday -- Mrs. Razzolini brought it up... PETER Holy shit! MICHAEL What's the matter? PETER This is the package those guys came for, not the baby, you asshole. MICHAEL Hey, asshole yourself!... Oh shit! Peter nods and begins to bark orders. PETER Look out the window and see if you see them, I'm gonna try to \ncatch up with them... Michael runs to the window. Peter runs like a madman through the apartment out the front door. He presses the button for the elevator. It's in use. PETER Goddamit! He opens the door leading to the stairs and races down them, holding on to the bannister. He flies, overwhelmed by anxiety. Suddenly he trips, loses his balance and makes a spectacular crash landing. The package gets a bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder spill out of it. Peter stares at them in horror. PETER What the hell is this? He picks up a few packets and examines them. PETER Oh, God, no... dope!    That's all we need! He starts to tremble  with fear. He picks the packets up as fast as he can and  hastily puts them back into what's left of the package;  then shoves it all into his pocket and continues racing  down the stairs. \n59   EXT.

PETER (huffing and puffing) Oh, thank God, you're still here! There's been a terrible mistake. That wasn't the package you were s'posed to take. It was another one. I have it right here. PUNK #1 What do you mean? What other package? PETER I'll take the basket back and give you the other package, here. No mistake. Peter takes the package from his pocket and is about to grab the basket. Punk #1 pushes him back violently. PUNK #1 You ain't takin' nothin' back, man. PETER But I'm tellin you it was a mistake...

Okay, if you won't   talk to me, you can talk to my lawyer!    This is grounds for divorce! You're in    big trouble, the both of you. \nHe leaves.   A second later, he comes back. JACK I paid to have this place decorated, too, you know. I'm not going to let you get away with this. He leaves; a second later, he comes back. JACK It's too late to try and talk me out of it. I'm history. I'm gone. I'm outa here. He leaves.   A second later, he comes back. JACK I'm giving you one more chance to... PETER (very calmly) Would it be asking too much of you to shut your big mouth for a few seconds? There is a child here who's trying to sleep. JACK And that's another thing! I will not have a baby in this house! Babies are not part of our agreement! PETER (softly) Michael, please hold me back... or I'll kill him. Michael takes the basket handle from  Peter's hand, places the basket carefully on the bed, and  walks without a word towards Jack, who he takes by the arm  and steers into the living room. Peter softly shuts the   door behind them and follows. \n82   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    82 Michael sits Jack down in an armchair.     He speaks with forced calm. \n", "test3_true": "PETER 'La Paz, Bolivia...' He calls from ... 'I'm onto something hot.' He says. 'Did the package get there?' He says. You asshole! \nMICHAEL And the day they wrecked the apartment, Peter came home and couldn't find Mary. I've never seen him in tears like that bef... PETER (cutting him off; embarrassed) Never mind about that. Look, Jack, you got us into this mess, and you're going to help us get out of it. JACK What are you guys talking about? What narcs? What gang? And who's that fucking baby? PETER For your information, the 'fucking' baby's name is Mary. And if I were you, I'd watch what I said about her... because she just so happens to be your daughter! JACK What?? MICHAEL And it just so happens, we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, even if she's yours! Peter and Michael exit, slamming the door. \n83   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                      83 Peter is slicking his hair back with Brylcream. Jack is sitting on the edge of the bathtub, with his arms crossed. He observes Peter silently. \n84   INT. APARTMENT - MICHAEL'S ROOM - DAY                    84 Mary is lying on the bed and Michael is putting the dope- filled diaper on her. \n85   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                        85 Peter is giving a tousled-looking punk hairstyle to Jack, who is looking at himself in the mirror. JACK It's ridiculous. I look ridiculous. PETER You look completely ridiculous -- so what? \n86   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                     86 \nMARY, wearing a bonnet and coat, is lying on one of the couches, CHIRPING merrily. Next  to her, also in his coat, Michael is just finishing wrapping a brown package which he puts in a plastic bag, along with a book, a baby rattle, and a clean diaper. Peter and Jack, disguised as punks, each with punk hairstyles and wearing black sunglasses, are climbing out the window leading to the fire escape. \n87   EXT. STREET - DAY                                          87 Michael exits the building. Mary, wrapped in a little woolen blanket, is in his arms. Michael is also carry- ing his plastic bag. Graton, in his car, is speaking into the radio mike. GRATON Okay, he's coming out alone. I'll follow him. Someone else stay here to keep an eye on the other guys. \n88   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                    88 Michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with Mary on her blanket near him. Graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass, watching them out of the corner of his eye. Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby. The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around a girl. He strolls by casually. He spots Michael and their eyes meet. The couple sit down on a bench a few yards away and they begin \"making out.\" \n", "test3_id": 3023}

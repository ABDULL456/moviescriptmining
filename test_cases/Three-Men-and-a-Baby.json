PETER Where's Jack?    Did he leave? MICHAEL No, he's cuddling up with a blonde named Clementine... PETER That's not Clementine. I saw him doing his famous routine with Christie... \nMICHAEL No, it is Clementine, the one with the tits this big... PETER Christie's got tits that big, too... MICHAEL Yeah, but he was with Christie at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with Rosalie and then with Clementine. And since I stole Rosalie away from him... Are you following this? \nPETER I'm not. Jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing. JACK Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you try... Any scotch left? PETER Yeah, here, I just put it away. JACK Sorry I can't give you guys a hand, but I've got something cooking. PETER I thought you were leaving at dawn for South America? JACK I am, the night's still young!... It's gonna be a lively one. I'm gonna make us a little snack. He makes up a tray with sandwiches. MICHAEL So, who is it anyway -- Christie or Clementine? JACK Maxine.    Beautiful, enchanting Maxine. Peter and Michael look at one another surprised, mouthing silently, \"Maxine?\" \nJACK Hey, Michael -- how'd it go with Rosalie? MICHAEL Well, things were going great until... JACK Your old friend Sophia appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime Rosalie took off with someone else. MICHAEL How did you know? JACK I dunno -- lucky guess... MICHAEL Well, I don't give a damn anyway, I have 24 drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and I gotta work all night anyway... So it was all for the best. But you better not leave that Maxine's phone number lying around because when I'm done... JACK Don't worry, I'll leave you her phone number on the hall table. If she's really terrific I'll put a big 'X' next to it. 'Bye, guys -- love ya. I won't wake you tomorrow morning. See you in three weeks... \n6   INT. APARTMENT - DAWN                                       6 Jack and Maxine noiselessly exit the   apartment. Jack is wearing his pilot's uniform. Maxine    pushes the button for the elevator. Jack sneaks back    into the apartment and leaves a note on the hall table   that says: \"Maxine 227-2013.\" Next to the number Jack    has put a big \"X.\" \n7   EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF APARTMENT - DAWN                    7 Jack and Maxine exchange a brief kiss and go their separate ways. \n8   EXT./INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PLANE                            8 \nJack is in the cockpit with his copilot, RON. The ENGINES are REVVING. Jack is checking gauges. He looks out the window idly and sees: The crew of another plane walking across the tarmac. Paul is one of the crew. Paul sees Jack and begins to gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise of the ENGINES. Just seeing Paul is enough to remind Jack about his package. JACK Damn! I forgot to tell them about the package! (to Ron) I gotta make a quick phone call. I'll be right back. RON (knowingly) Jack, there'll be plenty of girls where we're going. JACK Oh, c'mon, I've really got to make a phone call! What do you think I'm going to do, pick up one of the New Jersey delegates to the I.B.M. convention? Jack walks back towards the phone. As he walks we see that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen. \n9   INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY                            9 In the architecture firm of which Peter is one of three partners. The whole staff, about 15 people in all, is gathered around a large model, the project for a big amusement park. They all seem worried about something. JERRY, one of Peter's partners, seems particularly angry. JERRY The model's not finished, the blueprints are a mess and you may as well forget the specs, they're a disaster! I know we're talented. I know we're good. Then why is it we can never get organized? Why is it we're always behind schedule? JAY Look, Jerry, architects since Leonardo have always been behind schedule.

JERRY You're damn right we are. Starting now, everybody works around the clock! Everybody! We have two weeks to be ready for the semi- final selection. And we will be ready. And we will win. You want to know why we'll win? JAY Because we're gonna cheat. PETER I'll go bribe the judges! JERRY I don't think this is a joking matter, gentlemen. PETER Come on, Jerry... A SECRETARY enters. SECRETARY There's an urgent call for you, Peter. PETER I'm not in. \nSECRETARY It's Jack -- he says it's 'super important...' Peter picks up the phone. \nPETER Hi... yeah... listen, make it quick, I'm in a meeting here... yeah, a package... okay... someone'll drop it off Sunday and pick it up Thursday... No problem ... yeah... we'll put it aside, okay... no, no, we won't tell anybody about it... Is that it?... Right, we won't tell anyone... Hey -- love 'n' kisses to the Brazilian girls, vaya con dios, old buddy. Peter hangs up, laughing.    Jerry gives him a dirty look. PETER What? \n10   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                         10 Peter, dressed in casual clothes, knocks on the door of Michael's room, and peeks in. Michael is asleep fully clothed on his bed. His drawing table is strewn with papers, overflowing ashtrays and empty coffee cups. The lamp is still on. PETER I'm going out for bagels -- how many you want, three or four? MICHAEL (opening one eye) What time is it? PETER Eleven-thirty. MICHAEL A.M. or P.M.? PETER A.M.    C'mon, up 'n' at 'em. MICHAEL Up 'n' at 'em yourself, asshole -- I just went to bed. PETER \nDid you finish? MICHAEL Nah, I didn't get anywhere. PETER Well then... nap time's over. Back to work. So how many bagels, three or four? MICHAEL Six, six! He buries his head under the pillow. \n11   INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY                            11 Peter opens the front door, he stumbles over an object, looks down; at his feet he sees a wicker basket lined with pretty pink-and-white checked gingham. In the basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently resting on a lace pillow. Peter looks at this object in amazement. There is an envelope pinned to the basket with the words, \"FOR JACK\" written on it. Peter picks up the letter -- he opens it and reads. PETER (to himself) You gotta be kidding! Abruptly he turns and races back to Michael's room. PETER Michael!    Michael! MICHAEL (still groggy) What? PETER Get your ass out here and see what's on the doorstep. (mutters) This has gotta be somebody's idea of a joke! They run to the front door. MICHAEL What is it? PETER Look for yourself. MICHAEL It's a basket with a baby in it. \nPETER No shit. (reads Michael the letter) 'Dearest Jack, here is the fruit of our love. Take good care of her. I have to go to Europe and Japan for six months, her name is Mary. Good luck, Love, Sylvia.' MICHAEL What are we going to do with it? PETER Give it back to her mother, that's what. MICHAEL But it says she went to Europe. PETER Well, we'll see about that, d'you have her phone number? MICHAEL Whose phone number? SYLVIA The girl's... Sylvia's... MICHAEL Why the hell would I have her number? I've never even heard of this chick! PETER You mean you don't know who she is? MICHAEL No way. If I had to keep track of all Jack's girlfriends, I'd have to be a full-time secretary. PETER Well, what are we gonna do? MICHAEL Hey, look, she's waking up... Hey, look, she's crying... PETER Oh no, this can't be happening! She's not gonna start to cry now?! MICHAEL \nUh-oh, now she's really crying! PETER What's her problem? MICHAEL Maybe she's hungry? PETER Well, what are we s'posed to do? MICHAEL Feed her, I guess... PETER Yeah, but what? \nMICHAEL Soft stuff... I guess. PETER (exploding) Oh no, I swear to God this is unreal! Can you believe that bastard Jack?! 'A little package,' he tells me on the phone, 'just put it aside till Thursday.' Put it aside -- can you believe him!? MICHAEL Really?   Jack said that? PETER Yeah and he also said 'don't tell anyone about it -- anyone at all.' MICHAEL Oh, so he told you about this? PETER Yeah, he told me a package would be coming today, but he didn't say it'd be this! MICHAEL (very angrily) Boy, he's got a helluva nerve! PETER Just listen to the racket she's making! What are we s'posed to do? MICHAEL (brilliant idea) Let's call Jack's mother! \n", "test1_id": 3021, "test2_input": "Michael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti- tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside him. He puts the clean diaper on her. Graton, nervous and wary,   watches Michael and the passersby. Just then, two    punks (Peter and Jack) come running up to Michael. He    ostensibly takes the brown package out of his plastic   bag and gives it to them. The two punks immediately take off with the package. Graton leaps up, shouts \"let's get 'em\" and takes off after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes detectives, who'd been hiding all around. Michael quickly gets up,    picks Mary up and discreetly deposits the dope-filled    diaper in a trash can, giving the punk on the bench an    intent look. Then he goes off in the direction of the    cops. The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and goes off in the opposite direction. The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put up no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them. MICHAEL What's going on? GRATON Inspector Graton, Narcotics. Do you admit you gave these men this package? MICHAEL Sure. I gave it to them, just a moment ago. GRATON (to one of the cops) Officer, will you please open this package in front of these witnesses? The cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate Easter bunnies. Graton is mortified. He crushes all the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate inside them. MICHAEL Is it against the law to give a box of candy to my friends? Peter and Jack take off their glasses. GRATON Oh, it's you guys! \nPETER What's the problem? GRATON You guys must think you're pretty smart, don't ya? (suddenly freezes) Holy shit! The diaper! Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain. He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the garbage around like a lunatic. \nGRATON The goddam diaper! What a jerk, what a goddam schmuck I am! Peter, Michael, Jack and the 10 plainclothes detectives watch Graton going bananas. MICHAEL (to the cops) I think that guy needs a vacation. JACK He should try South America. PETER Yeah, I hear it's nice there this time of year. \n89   INT. GRATON'S BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY                         89 The Chief is standing behind his desk, red-faced with anger, and Graton sheepishly faces him. CHIEF Let's face it... Graton... You've got shit for brains. GRATON I'm sure the dope was in the diaper. Can I go on tailing them? CHIEF Forget it. I have solid information your three suspects never had anything to do with the dealers or the dope. GRATON I'm sure the dope was in the diaper. CHIEF \nCase closed. GRATON I'm sure the dope was in the diaper. CHIEF (screaming) Did you hear me, Graton?   Case closed. GRATON I'm sure the d... CUT TO: 90   INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - EVENING                        90 In the devastated living room Peter, still disguised as a punk, and Michael, both very high, are dancing around in circles with each other and laughing. They are singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har- monizing. Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael, holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to him and starts turning around in circles with him. MARY, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is LAUGHING her head off. In the b.g., in the hall, Jack, also still in his punk getup, is on the phone. He's got a glass in his hand and is a little smashed. JACK Paul, hi, it's Jack! Hey, listen, I brought you back a little present from South America. Can I see you right away so I can give it to you? ... Yeah, the sooner the better! I can't wait to let you have it. How about 67th and East River? 91   EXT. EAST RIVER - EVENING                                   91 A broadly smiling Jack arrives at the riverside. Paul is sitting on a bench. When he sees Jack, he gets up and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand. Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and  sends him with a forceful shove flying into the water.   Paul lands on his back with a big splash, and comes back  up to the surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over   the water and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit  drunk. JACK That was for your 'little' package, and consider yourself lucky I didn't turn you in to the cops! And get one thing into your thick skull: I have never touched dope, \nand I never will. You and your shit-dealing, you can go straight to hell, and you can take the money you make from it and stick it up your ass! So long. \nJack turns his back on Paul and staggers off. PAUL Hey, come back! -- how'm I gonna get out of here? JACK Crawl. \n92   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                     92 In the living room, Michael is sitting in front of the TV. He's not really watching -- he's eavesdropping on Jack's phone conversation. JACK (very aggravated) Listen, Sylvia, you've got to come back. I travel, I can't take care of her... Yeah, but you're her mother... I'm her father -- what makes you so sure I'm the father!? The dates coincide! Big deal! That doesn't prove a thing... But she's still your kid, so do me a favor, get your ass back here immediately and take her off our hands... 'Cause we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, okay? Sylvia?... Hello! Hello! Sylvia, goddam it! JACK (CONT'D) (he slams the receiver down like he was hammering a nail) Shit! That bitch hung up on me! Women! I could kill them! MICHAEL Why don't you call her back? JACK I don't have the number. I got a message to her through her agency, they won't tell me where she is. I don't even know where she was calling from. And you better believe she's not going \nto call back! The PHONE RINGS.   Michael answers it. MICHAEL Hello?... No, it's Michael... How are you?... Oh, she's doing just fine, she's in great shape.

Mom, how would you feel if I told you you were a grandma?... SCREAMING coming over the phone. \nJACK ... Yeah... A little girl, Mary... SCREAMING coming over the phone. JACK ... I'd love you to see her. In fact, I was gonna bring her down tomorrow... today?... Great, I think there's a flight in three hours. I'll be at your place by two. See you real soon!

Jack is watching him do it. MICHAEL You'll have four already made, this'll hold till Miami. JACK Okay... MICHAEL Tell her to make sure Mary gets plenty of sleep. JACK I'll tell her. MICHAEL If her ass gets red, tell her not to listen to any pediatricians -- they're full of shit. JACK Right.     Full of shit. MICHAEL Then she should give her a bottle of water instead of the regular bottle. Works like a charm: Her ass will be white as snow in three hours. JACK (nodding) Bottle of water, white as snow... MICHAEL Peter says her clothes should be washed by hand... \nJACK Really, by hand? MICHAEL (nodding) And only in soap flakes without any artificial color or scent. And then rinsed three times in very hot water. JACK (docile) Rinse three times. MICHAEL To put her to sleep we sing in harmony -- it always works. JACK My mother lives alone. MICHAEL Solo works just as well. JACK Okay. MICHAEL Now, as for the nipples, you've got to be very, very, very careful. MICHAEL (CONT'D) As soon as the hole gets too big she's gotta throw them out -- This is extra, extra, extra-specially important -- 'cause if the hole's too big, the milk comes out too fast and it's bad for her digest...

Michael is in the living room, eating a sandwich, while looking through a magazine. \nMICHAEL I am! PETER How 'bout Jack? \nMICHAEL On his way to Miami. PETER Oh, yeah. He's got a lot of nerve! Leaving us with the kid again... MICHAEL No, he took Mary to his mother's, she couldn't wait to see her. He's gonna try to unload her on her till Sylvia gets back. I made her four bott...

Jay and Jerry, Peter's partners, are also there with their wives. Michael and Sophia are having a vehement discussion as usual, Jack is between two gorgeous models: CHRISTIE and CAROLINE. CARL Have you seen the latest bi-annual at the Whitney? Incredible! Have you seen it, Peter? PETER No, I haven't had the time lately. CARL Ah... working hard on the competition, are you? You may as well throw in the T-square, old friend, you haven't got a chance. JERRY (somewhat harshly) I only wish he was working hard on the competition, but unfortunately, that's not the case... NATALIE Really? What's he doing then? He's always so busy. CARL Maybe he's working hard on women! Some people have to work really hard to get anything! Natalie bursts out laughing.

Well, then, you explain what it is. MICHAEL Well, it's... art. I'll be right back. He gets up and goes out.    Jack watches him.

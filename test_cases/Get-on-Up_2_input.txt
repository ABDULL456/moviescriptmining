JAMES (CONT'D) A house smells good. I'm happy I stole that suit. And I thank you for having me here. 
GRANDPA Boy, pass them beans before you get your bullshit all over them. 
MRS. BYRD (Changing subject) James is going to sing with us in church this Sunday Sarah. 
SARAH BYRD Really. Well maybe we could work up a little harmony together. 
Sarah turns to James and gives a tiny wink. James stops chewing. 
52A   INT. BYRD HOUSE. NEXT MORNING.                             52A 
Bobby Byrd sleeps in his bed. James sleeps in a cot that has been brought into Bobby's room. 
Grandpa Byrd enters the room holding a suit.    He approaches the sleeping James. 
GRANDPA BYRD Jailbird! 
Startled, James and Bobby rise up from their pillows. 
GRANDPA BYRD (CONT'D) (to James) This out to fit ya. 
Grandpa Byrd throws the suit on top of James and exits. James smiles at his new suit. 
INT. BYRD HOUSE. NEXT MORNING. 
Bobby comes in with NAFLOYD and BABY ROY who are all dressed for church 
BOBBY There's coffee in the kitchen, Nafloyd. Make yourselves at home. (Calls) James! 
Bobby vaults upstairs. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) James. Come meet the band. 
Opens a door. INSIDE James has Sarah pressed up against the wall. They are having vigorous sex. James' pants are around his ankles. Sarah's church dress is pushed up her body. 
Sarah has her hand over James' mouth trying to keep him quiet. 
Bobby throws it into reverse, shutting the door. Did he just see that? A full gamut of emotions cross his face. 
Mrs. Byrd starts up the stairs. 
MRS. BYRD Sarah! I ain't tellin' you again. Get down here. 
Bobby panics.   He crosses and meets his mother at the top of the stairs. 
BOBBY She's coming, Momma. She's coming. 
MRS. BYRD Sarah! 
BOBBY Go fix Nafloyd and the boys some coffee. We got guests, Momma. 
Mrs Byrd nods and heads down the stairs. 
MRS. BYRD Nafloyd?! Where you boys at? 
INT. ST. STEPHENS CHURCH. DAY. 
A congregation watches as BOBBY, NAFLOYD, BABY ROY, SARAH AND JAMES sing righteous gospel. "Steal Away To Jesus". 
Above their heads a HOME-MADE SHEET-BANNER: "The Gospel Starlighters" 
Bobby looks to Sarah and James with a searing gaze. Sarah innocent, James really giving it up. 
James steps out front. His voice soars sweetly over the congregation. Bobby's gaze softens. 
MRS. BYRD and GRANDPA watch on. Mrs. Byrd leans forward and catches Bobby's eye. Gives a small nod of approval. Bobby's smile is...more equivocal. 
FLASHBACK: INT. SHACK. BARNWELL. DAY. 1942 JAMES 9 YRS 
James is asleep in his bed. Alone. It's been a year after his momma left. 
Suddenly, Joe approaches and throws a burlap sack at James. 
JOE BROWN Pack up. We leaving. 
James wakes and sits up in bed. Joe is clean shaven and wears his nicest shirt and neck tie. 
JOE BROWN (CONT'D) Hurry up. 
James waits a beat to make sure his father is gone. 
James gets out of bed and crawls deep underneath. He backs out holding the dead man's pair of shoes and places them in the burlap sack.

JOE BROWN You miss your momma, boy? 
James nods. 
JOE BROWN (CONT'D) We gone fix that. 
James flashes a hopeful smile.

FRANK (V.O.) You've gotta relax and stay calm in there. The cage is your home. You set the pace. 
INT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY 
Brendan and Marco grapple. They're evenly matched. Frank looks on, impressed by Brendan. 
FRANK (V.O.) You set the rhythm. Feel the Beethoven. Be smarter than him. More patient. Wait for him to make a mistake. And when he does, that's your moment. 
Brendan turns Marco and gets him in a knee bar. Marco has nowhere to go and is forced to TAP. Frank jumps in the ring, all smiles, and slaps Brendan on the chest. 
FRANK No he did not tap you! Physics teacher! That's the best in the world there, son. 
EXT. 33RD STREET TIRE YARD - DAY 
Tommy keeps pushing the giant tires until he finally reaches the end of the yard. He's ready. 
EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY 
Frank, Brendan, and group of other FIGHTERS stand at the bottom of the hill and tend to Marco Santos, who has just badly INJURED HIS KNEE. 
END OF TRAINING MONTAGE 
EXT. ST. IGNATIUS HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
An AMBULANCE pulls in front of the ER. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATER 
A sorely dejected Frank walks through an underground parking garage with Brendan. 
BRENDAN You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite? 
FRANK Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta call the boys and break the news. I'll call you tomorrow. 
Frank heads off through the lot. Brendan reaches his car, stops, considers. Calls out to Frank while jogging toward him. 
BRENDAN Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me? 
Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco. 
FRANK You talking about Sparta? Brendan, please. You got a better chance of starting a boy band. I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
BRENDAN It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do. 
Frank looks at him. Sees how serious Brendan is. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) They'll have to kill me to get me out of that cage. 
FRANK That's what I'm afraid of. 
BRENDAN Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you. 
FRANK You realize what you're asking me to do here, Brendan? We go down to AC and you get tapped out in five seconds, how does that benefit either one of us? 
BRENDAN That's not gonna happen. 
FRANK Not gonna happen. Wish I had a nickel for every time I heard that. 
BRENDAN (SMILING) It's not gonna happen. 
Frank breaks. Smiles. How can he say no? 
FRANK I'll make a call. 
Brendan grins and walks back toward his car. 
BRENDAN I love my coach!

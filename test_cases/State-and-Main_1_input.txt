State and Main 
FADE IN: 
EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY 
Ann is walking down the street.  The firedog runs out of the firehouse, she gives the dog a biscuit, and pats him on the head. 
The fireman is out front with a cup of coffee.  Ann hands him a poster. 
EXT. STATE AND MAIN - INTERSECTION - DAY 
Morris and Spud, two codgers, are about to cross the street when they hear a beeping and stop. 
As they cross, we see the tail end of a van, and the group nods in that direction. 
MORRIS You hear that? 
SPUD Yes, I hear it. 
MORRIS Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an-hour, get across the street yesterday. 
SPUD I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..." 
As Morris and Spud speak a car is coming down the street, and bounces in the pothole. 
MORRIS Y'wanna fix something, you should fix the pothole.  Yessir, they should be trussed up, thrown off some high building. 
DOUG MACKENZIE, a young Republican type, walks up to join them. 
DOUG Who's that? 
MORRIS Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand dollars, a new traffic light, you could grow old, paint your house before it lets you cross the street, and then, not fix the pothole. 
SPUD What was wrong with the old traffic light? 
INT. COFFEE CORNER - DAY 
They enter the Coffee Corner.  Carla is serving the folk, and Jack the owner is behind the counter. 
DOUG I'm glad you asked... I'll tell you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now: You want to bring business into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, no... 
ANN Morning, darling. 
DOUG Morning. 
CARLA Hi, Annie. 
Ann hands Carla a poster. 
ANN Morning, Carla. 
Doug and the two codgers move to a table by the window where Carla, the nubile waitress, brings them coffee.  Ann talks to a woman at the counter. 
MORRIS ...the damn thing... 
SPUD No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset... 
DOUG They are, yes.  I'm sure they are... 
WOMAN AT COUNTER Annie, I'm going to be a lil' late for the rehearsal, tonight. 
ANN S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...? 
DOUG ...I'm sure that people are upset... 
MAUDE I know 'em, I don't know what order they come in... 
ANN We'll work it out. 
JACK What're they talking about? 
ANN Traffic light. 
JACK Waal, no, th'traffic light's Doug's thing.  That's his thing, fine. 
DOUG Thank you, Jack, and... 
JACK But we got to talk about the pothole. 
DOUG Jack... 
JACK A public office is a public trust... This is why this is America.  Question is: who owns the street. 
Outside the front booth, on the street, the airport van cruises by. 
EXT. STATE AND MAIN - DAY 
As they walk out we hear a high pitched beeping sound at the traffic light.  We see DOC WILSON crossing the street, holding his doctor's bag.  An ELDERLY MAN approaches Doc at the crossing.  As Walt and Bill walk, the airport van follows them. 
TOWNSMAN Doc, those pills, y'gave me for my back? I'm not sure that they work. 
DOC WILSON Well, I'm not sure either, but y'don't hear me complain... come by th'office, end of th'afternoon. 
TOWNSMAN Thanks, Doc... 
BILL This is your movie, this is small town America.

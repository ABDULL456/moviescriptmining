Shifty shuts the door to Valerie's behind him. They go to walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks. He pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried on walking. 
SHIFTY Geezer, give me a minute. 
Chris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his jacket. Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to unhook the latch. The door swings slowly open, the drum 'n' bass booming out. 
73A                                                                   * INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY 
Shifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway - a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old, Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty, cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed. Shifty stares him out. 
SHIFTY Alright mate? 
OTIS Alright. 
Shifty looks about at the room. 
SHIFTY What's your name? 
OTIS Otis. 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY Where do you get your weed from? 
OTIS It aint... it aint mine, my erm, my mate left it, he left it here... I could phone him if you want, he'll sort you out... 
SHIFTY Where d'you get your fucking weed from rude boy? 
A BEAT. 
OTIS I get it from this geezer... Glen Dowdy innit. 
Shifty smiles. 
SHIFTY No, you don't. 
74   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / CORRIDOR. DAY 
Chris stands waiting, he looks uncomfortable. 
75   INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY 
OTIS No his names Glen, I'm sure it is man, his names Glen innit? 
OTIS' GIRLFRIEND Yeah, I think so. 
SHIFTY From now on you get your weed from me... 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) At half the price. 
Otis looks at his girlfriend, and back to Shifty, utterly confused. 
76   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY 
Chris watches a young mum below, she can't be more than 16, pregnant, and with another baby in a pram. He looks saddened by the girl. He turns and walks into the flat. 
77   INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY 
SHIFTY I'm gonna sell you your weed half price, and your gonna keep this noise down. 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) Yeah? 
A BEAT.

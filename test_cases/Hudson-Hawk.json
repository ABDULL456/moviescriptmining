{"test1_input": "ANTONY Welcome back, buddy ol' pal. We've got a proposition... \nHAWK Answer's no, not even if you bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario, how's the \"Family?\"  Kill any monkeys lately? \nCESAR How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, \"endearing.\" \nHAWK Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to... \nSmouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding on the hood. \nCESAR You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie... \nHAWK Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand. \nANTONY (defensively) Yeah, directions even I could understand. \nThe car squeals to a stop.  Antony bounds off.  Cesar shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling hands. \nCESAR Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas... \nHAWK If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt. \nHawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into Cesar's hands. \nCESAR What's your favorite sport, Hawk? \nHAWK Baseball, why? \nAntony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says \"Baseball.\"  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs up as Antony moves threateningly toward him. \nHAWK I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd rather go back in than whore for you... (stopping) Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars. \nA PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness. Hawk feebly calls up to him. \nHAWK Help?  Police? \nAntony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until the last second.  Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf. Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  Hawk boots up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat of the car. \nCESAR (unfazed) You need some time to think. That's cool, but next time, I'm not going to say \"Please.\" \nCesar floats into the backseat.  The Lincoln takes off. Hawk seethes... \nHAWK I don't believe this.  I've been out forty seconds... \nA BACKFIRE rings out.  Hawk hits the ground, thinking it is a gunshot. \nHAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V. \nA gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too- fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  Hawk looks up to see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best friend. \nALEX That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything? \nHAWK (getting up) Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day. \nALEX Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated. \nHawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex. \nALEX Where's the kiss?  No tongue this time, I promise. \nA laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before getting in the car.... \nHAWK Looks like you've been expanding your... \nALEX Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure. \nHAWK My next word was gonna be \"consciousness.\"  Swear to God... tubby. \nEXT. THE ROAD INTO HOBOKEN--DAY \nThe Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. \"Come Fly With Me\" is playing on the radio.  Hawk casually com- pletes an intimidating hand puzzle. \nHAWK That's your definition of \"Hard?\" \n", "test1_true": "HAWK Three minutes, 51 seconds. \nALEX Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg-- \nHAWK Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League. \nALEX Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks? \nHAWK Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo? \nALEX Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy? \nAlex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag. \nHAWK The man knows, the man knows! \nHawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff. \nALEX So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison? \nHAWK Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job. \nAlex brakes and cappuccino flies.  Hawk half-heartedly tries to lick up with his fingers. \nALEX Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu-- \nHAWK Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change.... \nEXT. OUTSIDE ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT \nThe Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the bar.  The Empire State Building beams in the background. Sinatra cuts off. \nINT. ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT \nIt's changed.  Hawk and Alex enter into what has become the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare, packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS. A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place. \nHawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high- fiving each other after missing a dartboard. \nALEX I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us \"Watering Hole of the Month.\"  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper. \nHAWK I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel? \nALEX Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss. \nAlex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it. Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out... \nHAWK This is Pizza?  Reindeer Goat cheese?  I admit, I've been known to go wild and order a Canadian Bacon in my time, but.. \nHawk lights up a cigarette.  A TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER immediately turns to him wearing a \"Yes, I mind if you smoke\" button. \nTORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER Can you read.... smoker? \nHAWK Can you take a sunrise and sprinkle it with dew? \nTORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER (Huh?) No. \nHAWK The Candy Man can, Felix.  You know, I thought this was a country where you could do any stupid thing you wanted; drive to work naked, make love to a V.C.R. Guess I'm wrong.  Maybe that's why I became a serial arsonist. \nTORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER Hey, it's okay, big guy.  Smoke all you want.  Have mine.... \nThe Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and flees.  A cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the bar saloon-style.  A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his lips until a POLICE BADGE swirls into frame and splashes into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer. \nGATES (O.S.) You're under arrest... \nHawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and cackling island of a man, OFFICER GATES, amid the sea of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by a table. \nGATES Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal... \nHAWK The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates. \nBACK OF THE BAR \nWith concern, Alex watches Hawk sit at Gates' table. \n", "test1_id": 1272, "test2_input": "ANNA My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that... \nHAWK Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse... \nANNA No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of \"watch out, Anna\" would have done nicely... \nHAWK Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners. \nAnna touches Hawk's lips and laughs. \nANNA (\"Hey, I was kidding\") Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you? \nHAWK (Serious answer? Na-a-h?) Because Danger, Doc, is my middle... \nBefore Hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere hammers him into the ground and the viewer into darkness. \nFADE IN: \nINT. VAN-TYPE AMBULANCE--NIGHT \nHawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated gurney. \nHAWK Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole cat burglar thing, it sounds bad, but I'll take the worst cloud you got... \nHawk's eyes focus.  The Mario Brothers hover over him. \nCESAR News flash.  You're not in heaven.  Yet.  30 seconds and counting, if you know what I'm saying.  Couldn't just play along, could you... \nEXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE--NIGHT \nThe ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge. \nINT. INSIDE THE AMBULANCE \nAntony raises up a mammoth gun. \nHAWK Pretty class way of covering your tracks.  I think that auctioneer landed at La Guardia. \nANTONY Subtlety was never one of our strong points. \nHAWK Neither's flossing. \nA confused Antony touches his teeth with his gun hand. Hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby trayful of syringes into Antony's face where they ghoul- ishly quiver.  Antony fires a wild shot, shattering the partition. \nFRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE \nThe Scarfaced Bodyguard/Driver, now in paramedic white, freaks at the starred windshield. \nTHE BROOKLYN BRIDGE \nThe ambulance bumper-pools off some innocent cars. \nINSIDE THE AMBULANCE \nHawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a howling Cesar, side-stepping his vibrating-on-the-floor brother, latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches it backward. \nOUTSIDE BACK OF AMBULANCE \nThe elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it. \nThe gurney wheels hit the road, sparking. \nA sheet from the gurney, caught on the door, yanks TAUGHT --Hawk is \"water skiing\" on his stomach atop the elevated gurney! \nScreeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the road. \nTHE GURNEY \nBattered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface. \nThe sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing off to the side on its own crazed volition. \nHawk skis toward a TOLL BOOTH WITH A LARGE GATE-ARM. \n", "test2_true": "He then sees he's heading toward an EXACT CHANGE lane. \nWhizzing wildly forward on the gurney, Hawk scrambles into his pocket and wiggles out some change.  He fran- tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally FLINGS the change from twenty feet away. \nTOLL BOOTH \nThe change ker-chunks into the basket and Hawk and the gurney JUST BARELY streak underneath the rising Gate-arm. \nEXT. THE AMBULANCE \nCRASHES through a gate-arm of another lane.  Hawk and the still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off. \nFRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE \nCesar pops his head through the partition. \nCESAR Make him into Roadkill! \nAntony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's. \nANTONY Yeah, run him down! \nCesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream, then all three look out the windshield and scream. \nTHE AMBULANCE \njackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a fiery ball. \nIn the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down \nA PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD \nHawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking stop. \nLit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness, carrying a steel suitcase.  He kneels before Hawk and opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara- tus.  He begins mumbling into a cellular phone. \nA malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and approaches Hawk.  Both men are dressed in outfits that seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute couture. \nOn the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word HATE.  On the other hand is the word FROG.  The Frog Hand hands a befuddled Hawk a card.  It reads: MY NAME IS KIT KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM. \nHawk looks up with a \"huh\" expression as Kit Kat chops his neck, knocking him off the gurney. \nThe sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus. \nHAWK This is the worst night... \nSNICKERS When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40. \nSnickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device.  Hawk a- a-ghs into a kneeling position.  Snickers returns to his suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in the \"outfit.\" \nALMOND JOY Almond Joy.  I know, pretty silly. But it's better than when we first started out, our code names were Diseases.  You don't know what it's like being called Clymidia for a year. (walking off) Whoops, forgot.... \nShe deftly kicks Hawk across the face.  Hawk angrily bounds back up until he sees the BIGGEST MEMBER OF THE GROUP Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them.  Suddenly, the Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney.  Laying atop Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks... \nBUTTERFINGER My name's Butterfinger. \nHAWK No shit. \nThe mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat that screams Old Time CIA.  His name will be GEORGE KAPLAN. \nKAPLAN Don't you just hate kids... \nALMOND JOY George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes... \nKAPLAN I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and... \nHAWK Don't I know you... \nKAPLAN You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended. \nHAWK Bastard, you're going to need another nose! \nHawk explodes upward.  Everyone but cool Kaplan draws a gun. \n", "test2_id": 1273, "test3_input": "With a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster through the rooftop door into another hallway, where SOVIET GUARDS TWO AND THREE are taking it easy. \nKAPLAN Create a diversion. \nSnickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards with silenced mini-Uzis. \nSOVIET GUARD FOUR rushes out a door before the agents, zipping up his fly.  Almond Joy twists his neck with an agonizing SNAP. \nTHE LONG HALLWAY \nHawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural through the windowed double doors. \nBehind the doors, they poke up to see a BESPECTACLED GUARD emerge from the darkness to check out the door. \nALEX Now that's a lock. \nHAWK Don't worry, we'll get it... \nANNA Can I sing this time, too? Please? \nHawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's eye flutter does it. \nHAWK Uh, I guess so. \nThe Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness. \nTHE BALLROOM \nThe Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them. \nDARWIN I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children. \nMINERVA (smiling) We're here to say, your government was right. \nDARWIN So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals. \nAT THE LOCK \nAlex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver. They are improvising... \nHAWK \"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt\" \nALEX \"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt\" \nAnna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and Alex can barely concentrate. \nANNA \"But we'll travel the road, Sharing the load.  Side by Side!\" \nTHE HALLWAY ABOVE \nThe CIA team saunters through corpses up to a door similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex are working on. \nSnickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly above the green light. \nSNICKERS This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created... \nALMOND JOY Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb... \nButterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange rifle.  He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased, suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel.  He fires the bomb against the door and it starts ticking. \nBEHIND THE WINDOWED DOUBLE DOORS \ncome Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting. \nHAWK That was close.... \nALEX Anna, I think you better stay.... \nHAWK You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun. \nAlex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little Sister not allowed to play.  Hawk and Alex go back through the doors. \nTHE HALLWAY ABOVE \n", "test3_true": "THE BALLROOM--SECOND LEVEL \nAnna meanders across the second level muttering to herself in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension. \nANNA \"You can be the lookout.\" \nAnna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the Mayflowers and the V.I.P.S.  She gasps and hurls herself behind the second level railing. \nTHE BALLROOM FLOOR \nA VERY DIGNIFIED SOVIET LEADER, in a SHIT HAPPENS baseball cap, addresses Darwin. \nSOVIET LEADER Before we serve you \"the main course,\" hee, hee, we need to know specifics about what you can do for us.  We-- \nDARWIN Bluntness.  How amusingly Hungarian. Listen up, for reasons I don't want to get into, I recently had to close down a petroleum factory, but I'm going to re-build it here and Madonna's going to cut the ribbon! Frozen burritos in Leningrad.  1982 fantasy.  1992 reality. \nTHE LOCK OUTSIDE THE DOOR \nHawk and Alex more frantically toil on the lock. \nHAWK \"We all had our quarrels and parted...\" \nALEX \"But we'll be the same as we started... \nThe lock clunks open.  They race through the doors into... \nINT. THE ART TREASURE ROOM \nHawk and Alex weave through the room which is crammed, with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures including an impressive array of Faberge eggs.  A solid gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall... \nHAWK AND ALEX \"Just traveling along, singing a song.  Side--\" \nHAWK Geez, this place is a mess... \nALEX Voila... \nThey rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room covered by a small curtain that has the Da Vinci Man in the Circle drawing emblazoned across it.  Hawk reaches for the curtain.  Alex puts his arm around him and speaks, not sings. \nALEX Side by side, man... \nSuddenly, the roof above them explodes.  Kaplan and the Candy Bars drop down behind them. \nALMOND JOY What the hell.... \nSNICKERS You're supposed to be dead! \nALEX I'm a ghost.  Boo. \nHAWK I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first... \nKAPLAN I wish I could think of those cute quips the way you can, Hawk, but I can't, so I'll just shoot Alex. \nKaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest.  Alex crumples backward, moaning.  Butterfinger, casually, but with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his back. \nHAWK No.... \nALMOND JOY That was pretty uncool, George... \nKAPLAN Sorry, you know he kind of reminds me of Little Eddie.  But I digress. Ah, victory is so sweet.... \nKaplan pulls back the Da Vinci curtain.  Nothing is there. \nTHE BALLROOM BANQUET \nA SOVIET CHEF lifts up a silver domed serving tray, revealing the Da Vinci helicopter model. \nMINERVA Yum.  This is the best meal I ever had... \nANNA \nbulges her eyes at the revelation.  She pulls out Alex's gun and bangs herself in the head.  What to do.... \nTHE ART TREASURES ROOM \n", "test3_id": 1274}
